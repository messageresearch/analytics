Lord Jesus to say something to the people father father I don't want it to be my thoughts Lord Jesus but I want it to be something for them Lord Jesus that you've ordained they didn't come here to

precious and wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen hallelujah while you're standing ing let's turn into the Book of Revelation I've purposed in my heart to not be long I have a timer here so when that timer expires I've expired we'll read uh from Verse 17- 18 and then we'll turn again to Romans 8:11 the scripture reads and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death I want us to keep this in our minds that this very person that says I am the first and the last he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more the same person lives in you that's right right so if he's dwelling in you and these are his capabilities the prophet would tell us that we are him she is him so if he's alive forever more what about you let's turn to Romans chapter 8 we just read the 11th word the 11th verse it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raiseth Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you Lord we want to ask a blessing over the reading of your word father we ask this in Jesus name amen you may be seated as I was chewing on what brother our pastor was preaching on this this morning and it really stood out to me when he was speaking about how we've lost our way we've lost the the the meaning for this life the meaning for this walk and it it got it got me thinking the message the bible church Wednesday Sunday two Services all these different things camp meetings and all these different things that we do and we try to do to help the people what good does it do to have all these camps all these meetings and all these things if our lives remain the same we've received the word that's supposed to cause a transformation in us but instead what it's happened is like our Pastor said this morning it's become now a thing of Association we pick and choose which parts of it that we want to identify with not that we live by but we identify with right I can chew on this side on emotions cuz I'm just you know I feel everything and I can chew on that or you come to the other side and say well I don't like to raise my hand I don't like to do nothing I just want to be a log on the bench well there there's that side as well right but what good does it do to pick a side if you don't live either we we want to be found changed we want to be found transformed and it moved just looking within my own life it's man I I don't I don't have the understanding I don't have the recognition I I don't I don't have what most of the people that have been in this message a long time have had through studying the scriptures through studying the word through studying all these different things I want to make this clear it's not important whether you understand the entirety of it our Prophet would say when when he was tall they said man I some people know the Bible better than me some people have a better understanding of the Bible but they don't know it from an intellectual standpoint I know the author right and it's important for us to get past just letters get past just tapes get past just coming to church into a building but get into the relationship with the author for he he's Desiring to do something in your life he's Desiring to do something in my life he wants to see us changed there's no reason the same person we are today we are again the next year right we want to be progressing and changing getting closer and closer to that which he has planned for us we understand like we heard this morning that God had a purpose in the seed in the beginning he placed the specific attribute that he wanted to see expressed and manifested within that seed right I you can't spend your entire life trying to manifest what this seed of God is manifesting or what that seed or watching holding a stick of manifestation well you're not manifesting what I think you're supposed to be manifesting so you've got the wrong thing you're not manifesting what I think you should be manifesting so you have the wrong thing but my Bible tells me he's a god of variety amen amen that's right some big some small some funny some not there's a difference in us all we are not all the same but the one thing that should be constant in US regardless of how we look or feel is that we can pinpoint the progression in our lives we can see the change it was interesting that he pointed out this this morning man that that portion of tape that we listened to was so beautiful because here brother Bram says since beginning of time God has been trying to transform but in the same time there was another trying to deform he couldn't create nothing all he could do was deform right well deform under what we know that the Bible tells us that God said let us make man in our image well what was that first image that he made man he made man into the spirit man and then from that point he then he made the scripture says there was no one to till the ground yet he made Man In His Image so then brother would specify and say well these are two different Creations this was the spirit man now he worked them towards the flesh Men by the Earth to till the ground and when the doubt was the only state in which the deformer could come in and do what he does best pervert change the meaning change the purpose and what happens is now we get into a state where we've allowed the spirit of the deformer to come into our minds and we're focused on the flesh man ra but that's not what God intended for us to do he wanted us to focus on the spirit man and thinking on this Within Me is the power to transform it it's not something that I'm getting from somewhere else all that's in you now are the potentials everything you'll ever be is already in you so who was the liar that told you that you had to get it from an outside Source trying to give you an alternative God didn't work in happen chance and luck no when he does something he thinks of every single possible method and he plans for it and he acts when he said let there be there was no other thought in his mind he knew what he said was perfect so when a prophet would come on the scene and say in the sermon it is the rising of the sun he says the Lord knew that there would be Sons and Daughters of God in the end well how could he know this because if you Rose if you were in him when he died and he rose that means you Rose with him you are I love the way the prophet says it a benefactor oh my man that that makes me feel good I I can partake of those blessings of what that Resurrection meant there was it was multiple meanings I just want to focus on this one meaning for a moment benefactor of that Resurrection what was he showing me when I see that it tells me that regardless of the condition that I find myself in the condition I find my brother my sister in sometimes the devil really beats up on our loved ones he really comes down on them and they start to question themselves question man do I really have this transforming power it seems as if I take two steps in the right Direction then one step back is this transforming power is it really real do I really have that thing on the inside that's going to take me all the way to the end well the one that put it there made sure when he put it there it would reach its goal it it it wasn't a chance thing he couldn't leave it the chance he's an all knowing god he's an all powerful God we get into a a place where we just we start to try to muster up a transformation we see what it looks like oh this person used to do this now they do this o let me copy what they do let me this is the funny part in in in the Sports World they say I forgot to start my timer in the sports well we're good now I'll just I'll deduct 15 minutes in the Sports World they say you can't look at where somebody is at and try to be where they're at and be jealous of where it is that they're at well this person he just has a way with the ball he's got control man how does he play like that you can watch it and you can learn about it but you'll never be able to do it because he spent thousands of hours mastering that one thing where we have problems is we see some somebody whose life has changed and we said man I want to copy what they're doing now but did you see what it took to get there you've got to go through your process right we we heard what our Pastor said this morning he learned obedience by the things he suffered in the church age book brother brandham says don't think you'll learn it any other way you'll have to suffer that's you'll have to go through things but we want to compare somebody's chapter 50 to our chapter one you got to get through the first 49 that's right transformation is not oh I'm perfect now no it's a step it's a process it's just like patience don't ask for things you don't know what you're asking for Lord give me patience it's not a drink of patience he gives you it's an opportunity to show patience you may not like that opportunity but it's presented to you all we're doing in this time is perfecting that which he already placed in you there it's it's not you're not coming up with anything on your own this this really struck me this morning as our pastor was preaching the power the law of the seed he placed it in me yes sir I'm not in charge of anything you get in the right atmosphere you feed on the right things you start becoming those things that's the law that he placed the more I eat the more I become if you eat bad things well you're going to look if you eat good things you're going to look the way you want to look you can't say man how did I get this way and you just had a Big Mac and 20 count nuggets and three fries and and all this different stuff and say man I'm I'm trying to be healthy man I'm I'm trying to live right well where's the evidence of it where's the proof of it what have you been feeding on that tells me that that's what you're going towards and we just get to a place where you you hear a good sermon man I want to be changed I want to be transformed I want to see that life within me and then you you walk out right back in the same place you were doing the very same things he just took you out of and you're expecting to change this is us I'm not preaching to you this is myself we desire these big things but these big things require a big sacrifice it requires a big work you must give of yourself to receive of him did not our Prophet say the more you surrender the more he feels and we think we'll transform any other way we oh you know what Lord I'll just give you this small portion you just give me that and I'll take care of the rest you in what army the devil did not lose his power when he fell from heaven the power he had up there he had that exact same power now if you think you and yourself and your own self-will and restraint as a man can withstand you're fooling yourself that's right you need something greater than you I need something greater than me Ben can't do it Ben was never made to do it I can't transform myself I can't make myself become something that I'm not feeding on then it got me thinking I won't be long it got me thinking of a butterfly have you ever noticed a caterpillar all it does is just eat I can attest to that all it does is just eat but there's an importance in its eating it's not just eating just because which we do but it's eating because it knows at some point before it reaches its maturity it's going to go through a season where it cannot feed and it has to have something within it to feed on that's you and I when a butterfly is in that cocoon State science says it digests itself man what that what that'll do when you look at nature just a little bit like man science knows how to preach better than we can it'll testify to the god they don't like and and you wonder why he would tell John take the book book eat the book what's the purpose of eating it son of man prophesy it's on your lips speak as you eat the word you become that word you're feeding on the god that is within you it's not an outside Source it's when you hear that word spoken when you hear the mother Eagle crying out speaking to you what is it something identifies on the inside and says I just that's me I believe that I want that that I I can attribute myself to that if that's not the CER on your heart What's blocking that way we must open up the paths to allow for the word to be spoken for the feeding to take place so that we can start becoming that which we're feeding on see the constant battle in the believer's mind is always looking to see am I transforming just as fast as this other person man we were both in sin just yesterday you have no idea ah man we were in sin but he looks more spiritual than me I don't like that comparison is the thief of Joy your transformation may be a longer process than somebody else's maybe it's because you're a little too stubborn you just like to have your way nobody knows better than you you got to be honest with yourself if you can't be honest with you the man up here will never tell you something you don't want to hear because you'll be too busy looking at the man and saying I know you what are you going to tell me get past the Veil when something hurts when it's spoken and you feel it hurt it's not a hurt that you're thinking of no one's attacking you no one comes we're not bringing hundreds of people in this building for one person to feel attacked we're trying to make it we don't want to leave not a one behind what good does it do me this this is this the mind that God wanted you to have if you have this great transformation this great thing take place in your life and you leave your brother sitting next to you knowing he's fighting and that does nothing to you that's right I want to be transformed and I want to go and be a testimony a living testimony of what that transforming power can do it's like when you plant a a a plant you put it in the ground you take the seed you throw it into the ground if you dig it up every two seconds to see if it's transforming you'll kill it it will never produce What It Wants What it's intended to produce it'll never produce but if you put the seed down you water it you give it sunlight you let nature take its course it will produce what it was supposed to produce it's the same thing with you and I we have to get out of the mindset of comparison trying to dress drag people through transformation brother bam says God can't do nothing for you till you're willing to let him do it and we just want to drag everybody along man you got to get through this didn't he say he's not going to pull you through a pipe and come out the other end amen it's a process Lord I want to be transformed Lord help me be transformed we get so one- minded thinking that I I just I have to be transformed instantaneously stop stop for a moment and look back at the footsteps look where you've been look at the things you've done I know what I'm talking about I know where I've been sir I know the things I've done in this world that I'm not proud of but you know I can look back and say Lord I'm seeing that transformation take place I may not happy with the current results but I know the same one that's been bringing me through this transformation will get me to that end point if God could do that for you yes sir how much more for those you love this is a group Affair or Pastor said it best we've dealt with the outside now it's fixing the inside Lord I just don't want to be good I want the body to be well Lord how can I be of help to this person how can I minister to this need this person has How can I visit the Widow visit the fatherless do those things which the word said you were called to do you start obeying the word the transformation follows suit Disobedience to the word just shows what's affecting you the deformer wants you to see you the deformer wants you to see your faults your mistakes your errors and he puts in your mind that if you've Fallen if you've made a mistake that transformation has stopped that that's a funny thought to think about hurricanes good or bad tornadoes good or bad tsunamis good or bad who made them all do they not serve their purpose so what's it to you if you're in a season of tornadoes a season of tsunamis it doesn't mean God's not with you that's right amen he's still with you there's a process he's trying to do something he will use whatever measure he needs to to get the attribute out of you he's Desiring we just have to be like a lamb sheer me Lord stand still just for a second I know that's interesting to say because I don't know how to stand still but Lord help me stand still when that word is going forth help me stand still take in what's being spoken so that I may go and live by it brother Brandon makes this comment is rising of the sun paragraph 109 but there has got to come one Hallelujah there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live more in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanic proves to be right there has got to be a dynamic to make it work that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead till the son said he was dead notice the things that are testifying to the condition the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it I I hope I can deliver it the way the lord gave it to me this is not just speaking about Jesus Christ this is speaking about his bride everything testified look at the church age oh it's dark nobody's living the pure word look at what's going on people are compromising they're choosing church and this they're mixing everything all together but something at the end has to testify the scripture says nature is waiting to see the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God it will testify I want to be one of the ones that it says I see a son that's a son of Adam he's coming into that maturity he's growing he's transforming he's being molded learning to surrender learning to be meek lowly humble not see himself but Christ that's my heart's desire but says until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride amen for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again in the last days this this got me feeling good you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want and deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around the Pistons got the spark to fire but no gasoline to fire it oh man what that does we we we want to recognize everything that attributes to the flesh oh man I was in that service man I just felt like my the Skin's on my hair the hairs on my skin man they were just sticking up I felt all this stuff brother Ram says it in the sermon what good does it do to Quicken everything else if it doesn't Quicken the seed the seed has to be quickened that's what the sun came for it quickens the ground around it but the purpose was for that seed don't misrepresent when you're in experience when you're having a moment with God and leave it just to the flesh leave it to just a sensation something you felt that you can go back oh that atmosphere was just something else oh my goodness but the word that gives life did you miss it were you so fixated on how everybody else was acting when the anointing came down that you missed the word what transforms you is not an atmosphere a prophet would say it takes an atmosphere but that's not what transforms you the atmosphere is created where the seed can grow but if the word isn't there you're you're doing nothing but messing with the seed the seed needs word it needs life the life is found in the word what we need more of today is feeding on the word we want to know why we aren't transforming why we aren't changing why our lives are still the same why we feel like we're stagnant is because we're not feeding on the word enough we're not praying enough we're not listening to tapes long enough they said well that's every single sermon that's preached listen to the tapes read your Bible pray well start doing it we have to this isn't just we're not here to bore you with the same information over and over and over and over again I want to see a church filled with the Holy Ghost in so much the devil don't know what to do with you I don't like seeing my brothers and sisters struggling and fighting and down thinking like they can't overcome that they can't get nowhere I don't like seeing that because that's not what God promised me a son and daughter of God would look like we need to transform out of that condition into the condition that we know when we speak something there's an authority behind to bring that thing to pass Lord transform me not just the because it's it's the spirit man we don't walk by this flesh this we heard the scripture this morning renew my mind Lord I got to think different part of the reason I'm not transforming is because my mind is wrong I think the wrong things I keep a negative confession when my Prophet told me not to do so think positive never let a negative con confession come into your mind he gives us these advice I would say it's more than an advice try it just think positive for a moment in the midst of darkness in the midst of everything seeming like it's not going your way just think positive for a second and you see if God won't move it's he's the high priest of your confession am I sick yes am I this yes but Lord your word says by your stripes I am healed see change the testimony on your tongue it's a good practice to just say what he said it eliminates you despite how you feel just say what he said you want soulless you want rest you want peace you want change just keep his words on your tongue and you watch the change will be on the prophet of God makes this comment so the bride must be paragraph 123 flesh of his flesh bone of his bone then how is this mortal flesh going to become his flesh we'll get to it in a minute how is it done how is this great transformation notice if the spirit of him God it's very simple lesson if the spirit of God that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you what we need is not to look for a transformation but look for the spirit that brings the transformation get the quickening power get him on the inside he takes care of the rest what the devil wants you to think is that you've got something to do with it oh man I felt for times today I'm late to transformation I've been going through six months of darkness numbness I go to church I hear the word it's good word being preached I can amen it but I'm just not feeling it some people feel numb for years I I want to encourage you with something there was a season in my life that I felt numb for a pretty long time but then I found something God never told me he'd be there when I felt like it he never told me he cared about me when I felt like he cared about me he said he'd never leave me he'd be with me even in me till the end so when you feel numb like he's away from you you I just don't feel your presence that's a good time to say Lord you said you'd never leave me nor forsake me but you'd be in me he didn't make that promise to take it back he made that promise cuz he knew he could fulfill it if you've ever been in that condition I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy the devil really gets in your mind turns things changes the picture all you see is your faults your mistakes your errors your lack of obedience and you have God waiting there patiently just come back just come back where you left me come back pick me right back up let's continue on that's the Christian walk it's Christ in you with you walking he's doing the transformation not you and I he says oh my the predestinated one of course like the seed laid upon the Earth the one that had life in them many of them were dead they were just rotten seed the waters and things burnt them out but you know there was a seed laying there ready for life God know it was laying there oh that's me go back in that time before you had that experience with God there was something crying out you knew you were dead and you needed something you didn't know what that thing was if you were born in this message you may have an you may have had an idea but you really didn't know what that thing was because it up to that point it was mommy and daddy's religion and if you were in the world you really had no idea what that thing was but when you finally got close to that thing and he drew Close to You CU it's two step it's a deep and a deep coming together brother says when two omnipotents meet you had a craving you had a desire for something and he came the one that can fulfill that desire desire he came into you that feeling there was a supercharge it changed your com the way you thought it changed everything you wanted to do everything for God lord I'll pray every single night I'll fast I'll do all these different things in the marriage of land brother bam says that between the the the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom he says you made a vow to God you said you'd read your Bible you said you'd pray you said you would fast you said you would do all these these things do we uphold those things we promised him we would do we said Lord if you give me your spirit I'll never gossip again I'll never lie again we made all these promises to God knowing the scripture says it's better to not make a promise than to have made one and not keep it but you know thanks be to God he's the one that keeps his promises because he said he would not lose a one he said of all that you have given me I will not lose one if you believe you are one of those ones lift your hands that's a testimony that you're showing because it's not just us here there's that deformer here as well he sits in church he sits right next to you and when something comes that hurts too much he says yeah I don't take that something comes a little bit closer to ooh wait wait hold on does he know what I'm doing does he know how I'm living does he know where I've been does he know what I said yesterday who I was talking about yesterday he's right there in your ear he will remind you constantly he doesn't make things up this this this is the funny thing he didn't make things up he goes to God and says I watched him sin yesterday God says what do you mean I I see blood I don't see what what do you something's wrong my record and yours don't make something's not aligning so we're looking from the wrong perspective of things we think our transformation is man-made no it's God he puts the blood before you he didn't see your faults he didn't see your mistakes you see them if it bothers you enough do something about it sir change what it is that you do you start to see oh one way I one day I used to do these things there was a point in my life I was doing these things and that and then it just ate at me and it killed me and all these different things then you start doing what he said apply the token go home take that thing out the house delete those apps don't go to that site oh don't oh I can manage that no don't go there delete this delete that if you really wanted to live a pure sincere life with God everything you could get rid of if you truly desired it you'd remove everything and it' just be you and him oh what change takes place then but so long as you think you can manage the serpent you can't he's slicker than you think there was a perfect Church in the beginning the Garden of Eden the serpent came in and beguiled Eve and in this day he's trying to do the very same thing and God this is now God taking his bride out of Satan's Eden but we're not careful we start messing with that serpent again did we not learn our lesson it's not the big sin it's not the big flashing red light that you run away from no it's the thing you think you can control that you ought to get away from because so long as you think you're controlling it it ain't you thinking that's a good time to look at your yourself in a mirror and say depart from me Satan cuz you're not speaking about yourself but that thought process of I can manage this you'll never manage it you can't manage it he never left it for you to manage it I want that transforming power that completely changes my being my existence everything I think about my actions I don't want to see Ben I want to see him that all consuming fire come in and just take all the things that I don't Paul said it best that which I want to do I don't do but that which I don't want to do that I do there's a law in your members but if you take this word you feed on it every day when those thoughts come in that's a good time to just let me just sing a song Lord let me just get into your word let me just do this you start reaching for the right thing our problem is we reach for the wrong thing sometimes those thoughts come in that pressure he feels like he's pressing up on you have you ever felt it it's it's it's it's it feels so real like a hand pressing on you trying to push you to do something you know you ought not to be doing that's a good time to change the atmosphere speak the word he says now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own now this is deep now be sure to catch this good now as the son was sent across the Earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also to life it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which was enclosed around the life not all men will receive Christ oh no but those which God foreordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth that's the one he comes to Quicken they're the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the Sun and say oh this sun is this old sun is so hot that rock say this old son is so hot but that little seed said that's what I'm looking for oh and it begin to Spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was not sent to Quicken The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but to Quicken the life of the seed oh that's us that's we're crying out oh I need that oh that word that hurts that stings that exposes the sin I need that I got to amen those things because that's what will cause the change but we get when something just gets too close to our life we don't want no ident we don't even want to lift a finger because we think everybody's going to notice what's going on the minister will get behind the pulpit and cast and preach on those things pornography lust and all these things and you know you're struggling you know you're fighting through those things but you don't want to amen the word you're not amening it for habitual sake you're not doing it to make the minister feel good you're doing it for yourself there's a power in an amen a sincere amen will cause the change oh my I got to find a place close these clocks don't wow Lord forgive me veram says paragraph 134 he's talking about the eagle here and I want to close with this statement he's talk he's talking about the eagle here in the hen Eagle growing up in the hen he makes a comment he says and he never tasted anything like that he just eat enough to keep him alive because he didn't like the taste of it see cuz he wasn't a chicken to begin with see we start feeding on things that we know we're not made to eat the physical food that we eat is not to to give us life it's to survive my scripture tells me man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God this is more food to you every day than the food you eat that you consume in your flesh we need this meal breakfast lunch and dinner in the natural they say this breakfast is the most important meal of the day I tell you by testimony singing in my own life breakfast is the most important meal of the day if you start your day wrong feeding on the wrong thing that's right watch the rest of that day and how it goes but when you start it right and you put him in the first place he takes care of everything else this eag was not satisfied eating what these chickens were eating he was lied to by the deformer that this is what he was but there was a predestinated seed in him that could not deny that he wasn't like them he didn't know just what he was but he knew he wasn't that he says by this time this is the mother Eagle by by this time he is time for him to be born is the time for him to be hatched out said maybe a crow some in come in picked up my egg maybe a vulture I don't know something picked up my egg but I know the egg is in my mind I got a son somewhere I got to hunt him so does God he is that great Eagle in his thoughts he knows know he'd have a church he know he'd have a people no matter what's cuddled them no matter what they was hatched out under he is hunting for his own don't let that devil lie to you for one second and say you're too far gone your loved ones too far gone if there a seed of God when God hunts he only shoots seeking missiles there's no luck he don't miss you can turn left right hide down jump up find whatever covering space you want but I I I'll give you an example of something that's dear to me to my heart that I've seen when a mother gets down to pray for her baby I don't care whether you're 20 30 however old you are you're still baby to mom when she gets down to pray for that one and if he's not living right it doesn't matter how far he goes the missile of her prayer will hit the target and when that thing strikes the story of Hatty Wright does something to me the Lord knew what she would ask for I've got loved ones I've got people that I need that seeking missile of God's word to go and find he said he will hunt you the devil has his trophy wall of people he's claimed and all this stuff I got this person I got this person you know the de the devil had a spot for your name in his wall he thought 2,000 years I've spent perfecting this I'm going to get him I'm going to get her oh that dress is just long enough it's tight enough oh no it's loose enough it's the perspective you look at it I just want to I just want her to be right by the line I don't want her to be all the way in the truth or all the way wrong if I can keep her right at the line that shirt's just low enough to where it's not scandalous it's just high enough to where it shows modest you're painting too close to the line do you know where people go to die in war in the front lines get out of the front lines and for the because I I I hear a prophet say this well in the questions and answers he was asked well brother brandom you always preach so much about the sisters the sisters the sisters well what about the brothers and he stated something he said well any husband that allows his wife to do that he's d to blame oh but you know I'm not a husband you know I'm single I don't I don't have a wife do you have sisters they don't have to be your blood sisters do you care about people do you want to see better for people would you like somebody to tell you when you're living wrong when you're too close to the edge that's the kind of love I need if you see me doing something wrong please come to me if you love me you'll tell me amen if you don't you'll let me go go on but we have to be mindful of each other get out of that front line well you know I'm not wearing makeup I just got this colored powder it's not makeup well I'm not doing this I'm not doing that we can justify anything and find an excuse for anything but if we want to transform and be different no excuses lay it all down says if there's a question about it don't do it why Lord I'm speaking to myself here I have so many things that I question yet I act on and then I wonder why the consequences present themselves I didn't heed the advice of a prophet he said if there was a question about it don't do it you want transformation in your life stop doing those things which rise questions in your mind leave them alone continue walking in what you know without a shadow of a doubt is the truth if the musicians would come he says one day The Story Goes this old eagle flew over the Barnyard she was looking everywhere and she found him oh for that Resurrection to recognize that he really wasn't a chicken after all he was an eagle and he was always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard I want us to pay attention to this who's teaching him this stuff but he heard a scream let's go back a bit he was always taught to look down look for a bug or something in the barnyard but he heard a scream that said look up this way and he looked looked above him and there was a creature with 14 feet Wings powerful than any than all the chickens there was in the barard barnyard and claimed him to be her son he said Mama how can I get to you said just jump start flopping your wings for you're an eagle see she knew she had a son somewhere no matter what he's been raised up in she's got a son somewhere if you're a daughter you place yourself there she got a daughter somewhere and God knows Hallelujah he's got a predestinated for ordained church he know he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over it that was Chief oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever not some mythical story but a reality no matter how many tried to tell him an eagle he didn't know what an eagle was yet he was an eagle he would not understand it until he seen something that reflected him that reflected rather and it jumped out of the page oh when you get a revelation where it just comes off the page and it hits you I didn't know what I was I had to see an example of what transformed looked like he had a reflection of his own we're looking not to him but we see Christ in him identifying in the Christ in him it's Lord help me Lord that I might really see my reflection in your word the deformer wants you to see your reflection in the mistakes and stuffs that you do but God wants you to see yourself in his word this is what the transformation looks like it's a Life by the word it's not a Life by your own abilities what you can must up what you can think of what you can do no it's being surrendered true transformation is complete surrender you're just learning how to give in you're learning how to give up it's not about me it's not about me nevertheless not my will but thine will be done Lord let this cup pass for me we saw an example of what it meant to be transformed and changed brother random says let's stand he says and when we see not a denom comination not a PhD not a lld not a good neighbor but a Son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the request of this day that he's the same yesterday today and forever there ain't no hen going to hold you he hunts for his mama he's an eagle to begin with he recognizes this real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why he's an eagle a eagle to an eagle the word before the foundation the word to the word oh the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position he hunts for it if you've realized your position in this hour and you've seen what it is that you want to come to what the the maturity of your transformation looks like some are called the one on office some are called to another but your desire within yourself should be Lord I want to be all that you planned for me to be I don't want to misfill anything I want to be right on the line with everything if that's your heart's desire there is a power greater than you and I that will bring you to that let's bow our heads in prayer gracious Heavenly Father Lord you gave me a simple thought Lord Jesus I pray Lord I was able to deliver the burden you put all my heart Lord father I thank you for the power of transformation I thank you for quickening power Lord father if we could but just catch what the prophet was trying to tell us Lord Jesus we didn't have to be this way he was showing us what we would come to if we would just continue walking and trusting in the path which was laid before us Lord father I I sincerely ask for forgiveness Lord I've tried my way Lord Jesus many of times and I failed every single time lord it's only in the seasons where I give it to you that I'm able to see any progress Lord Jesus father you see the people's hearts Lord Jesus you know the ones that have been looking for transformation that the devil points to faults and mistakes and says you're not headed anywhere it's just a lie Lord he's nothing but a bluff there's no truth found in Him Father you know what you're doing Lord the pths of your children are ordained Lord Jesus they will reach Final Destination Lord teach us and help us to surrender father to give in to that which is within us Lord Jesus Just Surrender Lord and let that life that's in that seed come forth Lord Jesus it's the seed on the inside that creates the atmosphere on the outside Lord that yearn that desire we didn't seek after you Lord we didn't find churches to spend time with you Lord we didn't get down and pray Lord there was a desire on the inside for those things that we didn't put Lord Jesus if it was up to us we would be doing whatever it is that we wanted Lord but you put a law within us Lord we must produce that which you had in mind since the beginning father and it's because of that you've allowed the pressures in life Lord Jesus for you said pressure causes change Lord you've put us in circumstances that have caused us to get desperate Lord Jesus to seek for a transformation lord it's your work lord it's your path Lord your plan Lord Jesus we want to surrender Lord we don't want to make it difficult father we just want to be like Lambs Lord Jesus like your Prophet would say Shear Me Lord if there's anything you find that you don't like Lord Jesus Shear me Father make me more like thee Lord Jesus that I might be able to stand on that day Lord and say this is one that overcome Lord Jesus to hear that from you Lord Jesus well done my son what a privilege it will be for us father we leave the rest of this day into your hands Lord surrendering all things into your hands we love you Lord bless your people Lord Jesus give us the hunger for your word father we can't be transformed without it Lord Jesus help us Lord we pray and ask this in the precious wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] amen chorus never promise that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be are to clim oh he [Music] never when you standing oh in the valley of decision says ging oh just hold on our Lord will show up oh and he will take you to the fire again let's raise the key a little bit [Music] amen so many times I question said circumstances things I could not understand oh and

be there every moment of every day amen did you enjoy the word amen it's not looking to the left to the right God has a process that he would take you through you know sometimes we want somebody else's process no he has a process for you butam says God knows men men don't even know themselves God knows men better than they know themselves he knows exactly where to press he knows exactly when to bring the heat he knows what he's cooking you know we we just the recipe of whatever he wants to bring and said God is do when to co he knows when to raise the heat he knows when to cool it down you know the problem with us is we we have an idea we think we want what we know what he wants at the end no we don't he he he knows what he wants with us he knows where to place us he knows all we need to do is fell in love with him and I I love just what our brother brought you you know often time people compare one another and they compare this and if we can just be surrendered all to him you know uh I I don't remember who I was fellowshipping with and um he was talking about just the brothers here at church and they were talking about this plant that when it's planted how long it takes before it even brings everything out it would take a long time all of the all of this time it's just building the foundation the roots are going deeper and deeper and deeper it's all doing that in preparation before he shoots up you know often time we we you know we the the the prophet talk says the problem is we lack patience you know we we go to church and like oh I don't see the results we get frustrated with oursel the results you're not the one bringing the result he's going to bring the result our job is just to drink in like our brother said to eat the word to eat the word let me say this the same process that you see with the natural food is the same process this word will do it's not a different process you eat the food you see it come to pass you eat well you see it you eat the word sincerely not don't eat education eat the word eat the life pray and go on your knees and let it work on you even prayer itself the moment you stand up it gives you a sweet Spirit it gives you understanding you know how to deal with problems you know how to be patient but but if you don't do that then you're not going to get the result we want to be an overnight Christian you know we we've we we call ourselves the 11h hour worker that doesn't need to do anything no you still need to go through the process whatever that work is you still need to do it we we still need to be to let God work the patience work the fruits of the spirit we need to eat the word and let the word the bread of sincerity and Lord I'm eating the word I'm eating then he's there behind and just arranging everything for you and working out bringing out the power of transformation it's in the word when you eat your word the spirit of the word works on you our problem is we eat intellect so we can go tell people what we know oh I know this and this just like our Pastor said this morning we identify ourselves with what we know rather than what we have as far as life is concerned I say my heart desire is Lord I don't care if I want to be called a ftic whatever name you want to call me I want the life I want the spirit I want the nature to be manifest I want as our brother said I want the
