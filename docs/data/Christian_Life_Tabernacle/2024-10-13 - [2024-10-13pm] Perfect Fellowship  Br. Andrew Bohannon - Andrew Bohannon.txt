Description:
Perfect Fellowship 
(Keeping Revival Constantly Revived Every Day)
Br. Andrew Bohannon
October 13, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord we're desirous of you tonight father to come and speak to us Lord and Lord it was in the evening time Lord that Adam and Eve they were able to gather around the evening meal and father you would speak to them lip to ear and Lord it would be just a delightful time together Lord and it would be a time that you can reveal yourself and to really Express Yourself father that's what we desire tonight Lord here we are Lord we've laid other things to the side that you would be the guest of honor and that you would be the husband men Lord prune out anything of the world that may be hindering our walk with you Lord Lord we want to do that pleasing to you but how be it oh God that we need Faith oh God we need Revelation so tonight father as you place this little burden on Upon Our Heart Lord we will you be The Interpreter oh god of your word to the believer that it might be spiritual food that they can grow and be full stature of Christ in this wicked hour father give us that boldness Lord to stand fast in the Lord father as we commit every heart here Lord we're so grateful for our pastor Lord to to have the burden and the vision to make a way for us Lord and to sacrifice surely he sacrificed his future in the natural Lord that we can have a place here Lord he's labored and burdened Lord even thinking about the message brother Billy preached Lord we pray you bless him Lord every Minister brother Paul and brother Leon and brother Matthew and brother Davey Lord you you know how we labor Lord because it's the love of God father we pray you'd re reward them even the musicians Lord sister Lori and oh God Brother Joseph and the different ones oh God that constantly are faithful our sister Joy Lord even the brothers in the back lord the deacons father Lord it takes every single one of us Lord to oh God make this thing go forward Lord we want to see Soul saved Lord we're at our post of Duty Lord there's those that are traveling Lord we pray your mercy Lord help them to return back to us safely what we need each one father and as we commit this little time around your word father help us Lord to get out of the way that you can have your way in Jesus Christ's name amen amen well we'll just go right to the word of God if you want to open your Bibles you turn with me there's a couple of scriptures that we'll read and then we'll have you take your seat but this thought popped in my Heart during the week and I just want to talk to you a little bit about perfect fellowship and so as the Lord leads we just want to talk to you about the importance of fellowship and not just any kind of Fellowship but perfect Fellowship amen so in Genesis chapter 17 and verse one as we heard this morning says this and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Mighty God walk before me and and be thou perfect amen praise the Lord and also you turn to me to with me to First John first John we'll start in the first verse what a privilege that God would ask us to walk with him and he wouldn't say to walk with him in that condition if it wasn't something that he planted within us walk thou perfect amen thinking about this and in 1 John 1 and verse 5 we'll read through seven it says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus his son cleanses us from all sin amen we trust the Lord will bless the reading of his word you may have your seats you know I'll say this we um we want to look into a little quote that brother brandham said and how can I overcome and this is a very familiar message that we quote but it says this in paragraph 33 he's speaking about how he wanted to speak on this subject but he says I chose this because I think the time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly reviv every day Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live we must never let Revival die within us and so as a little subject as the Lord placed this thought perfect Fellowship you know as a maybe a subth thought is keeping Revival constantly revived every day you know uh this this past week we was able to have a job that sent us out to uh streetport brother Tommy and I was doing some in installing us some cabinets and as this thought was you know pouring in my heart Tommy and I begin to Fellowship you know and sometimes God would deal with you on a certain subject and you know I got to thinking you know it's you know let's let's let's put our faith together and let's really focus down you know and that's that's what I believe believe what brother brandom's talking about you know we want to Die daily that Christ might live we have to have that Earnest expectation like our brother Billy was pointing out that God's going to speak to me not only is he going to speak to me but he wants to lead me and God leads by his word by revelation of his word amen and it's personal right but if we're not asking him if we're not dying out to what we think is right and what we know is good instead of calling upon God daily it can never be overemphasized the need for us to call upon God for Revelation amen but you know it's just like as brother Tommy and I was fellowshipping you know people in natural War when they're going to battle all of a sudden they're they got the orders they their their commanding officers told the troop hey y'all need to go out and flank out down the valley the enemy is going to come and whatever the different orders are but all of a sudden when it came down came down to the boots on the ground and now the enemy's on attack and now he's There's real live ammunition coming at you they're firing away this is no longer just training now you got to take the training and put it into action amen that's what God wants us to do he wants us to put our faith in action when we're going out though sometimes when we see the Warfare and and all of a sudden we get fatigued and all of a sudden things start draining us and we lose focus amen but that's what I want to point to tonight is we want to keep the spirit of Revival alive in us daily it doesn't matter about the disappointments or yesterday or the fear of tomorrow I have a promise of today God's promised me spiritual food in due season I have an expectation that God is here the very trial the very difficulty is because God wants to show me that he has power over this condition he wants to show me something in his word that'll Quicken and say that's me amen there's something within me that will overcome this thing that's what I want to look to and as brother Tommy and I just asked him the question I was like you know if you can ask anything and I I can't remember exactly how the question came out but oh my we had some wonderful Fellowship amen you get just thinking about God and how you want God to do something for somebody amen we just sat there and we just had a few words of uh fellowship and praying about some things in the word of God and all of a sudden it's like after some pray now we're under expectation we're on the job we're doing our job and you know what what's very powerful is as as brother Jonathan prayed he God wants to have people that are declaring manifestly the spirit of Truth amen it's not just uh H uh to to to to hear the word only but to be doers and and when you're a doer now you're worshiping like your very life the way that you treat people on the job the way that you do the details you know the way that you uphold integrity and honesty these are the kind of things that bring worship to God you are reflecting a kingdom of righteousness and all of a sudden as we were working this the the the oversight man he was just he was blown away he was just like you know I don't have to tell him you know to clean up I don't have to tell them you know like things were used with a level and a plum and things were being anchored and he was just like he was just standing back just and that's what I believe that people are doing your neighbors are doing they're standing back and said you know what there's something about that sister there's something about my neighbor there's something about my coworker man man there's something I just I want to be like them they can't put their finger on it but there's a bubble of Fountain that's bubbling up inside the believer amen we don't want to quench that with desires of the world Amen but I going say God I want to draw from you today fresh Mana Revelation not just for myself because I'm already sealed in the enemy he he can torment my flesh but my soul is saved and I want to see God do it for somebody else I want to see it do it for those loved ones even even to come to a place where my heart's in a condition that someone would want to kill me I would still want to see them Father let it not be forgive them they know not what they do I want the the kind of life that can look and and look past the person and see there's a soul there in bondage I want to say God use these eyes to see what I need to see I want to see like you see you said in your word that we would be your very expression at the end time that's the very reason you died that you can resurrect in a body amen my that's what we want we must never let the Revival die within us it's not a whole camp meeting it's not special meetings it's not Church practices it's a Revival with you and God Amen you drawing from the very Fountain of God say this is my God he's healed me oh my to think where I was God what you did for me I was I was in bondage I couldn't help myself I tried I tried I tried to use different things to make this satisf ction but nothing satisfied amen till one day Glory one day I met the king I met the master amen my where are we at praise the Lord you know it's just one of those things when you think about Fellowship you know God he said that he's provided a way for us to Fellowship you know and one of the things I think we get at least I do when I think about scriptures like be ye perfect even as your father which in heaven I think that thing kind of wors against our mind like sometimes and it echoes back and says you perfect you'll never be perfect but I want to say this tonight it just struck me it's it's a perfect Fellowship that God's provided for us that we can walk and be in an Eden condition of Heart by Rap by rapturing faith we can come to a place this is the hour of rapturing Faith like we want want to be under this expectation we want the atmosphere of that kind of Faith to be in our heart and mind and we're looking for it it's around the corner it's here tonight amen and when you think about in job I think about the the example of job in Job chapter 1 and verse 1-5 I I just want to talk a little bit about job you know job God had a a great confidence in job and we know the story how you know the devil was going to and fro and he was looking around and you know there was a conference between God and Satan and he says well have you have you uh seen my servant job oh my think about it but maybe we'll turn there in Job chapter 1 Job chapter 1 I believe there's a principle within the word of God that we can have an understanding about what God wants God wants to have a perfect fellowship with us do you believe that God desires to have perfect fellowship with you amen but job is believed to be one of the oldest books and we believe that job was a prophet of God Amen but it says this there was a man in the land of us where whose name was job and that man was perfect and a right and one that feared God and assu Evil My think about that just let that sit for a moment because that's the potentials of a Believer amen that's you that's me you you talk about a perfect Fellowship that he had he was upright one that feared God and this word assu means that he he he he uh he he avoided it he abstained from Evil you know it was a deliberate thing it wasn't like uh no it was deliberate like that I'm going this way wow that's right you know and that's the kind of thing that God wants from us and so as we go through we see there and there was born unto him seven sons and three daughters and his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 y of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East and his sons went out and feast in their houses everyone his his day and sent and called for three sisters to eat and drink with them so it was so and it was so when the days of their feasting was gone about that job sent and Sanctified them and Rose up early in the morning and burn and offered burnt offerings according to the number of all of them for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their heart thus did job continually amen oh my you talk about a worship you talk about a day he did it continually he offered God's provided way when the Tex come job could stand there and say I know my redeemer liveth cuz he kept he had perfect fellowship with God because God required death of an innocent one amen and he didn't just do it one time he did it continually amen [Music] my you know we want to do that which is pleasing to the Lord and God you know when he gives us Revelation he wants us to act on it [Music] amen you know this Fellowship that God desires is something that you know we what we want to get in tune with amen we want to connect with we want to unite our hearts with the will of God Amen and the only way we can know exactly what it is I can't go and tell you all of that you have to go before the Lord you know we can't we can't run from the presence of the Lord and give our responsibility off to somebody else or some other system or some other Church affiliation this is God pressing upon you a burden to go and know him amen excuse me amen I was thinking about the this quote in Hebrews chapter 7 but he says this in 1957 on um September 15th he said God can only work through Perfection because he's perfect blessed be his name he has to be a perfect channel that God works through cuz he can do nothing else but work through Perfection he he can't he can't stain himself in any way and then that's why Jesus came to take away our sin that we might be perfect that God could work through his church there's where the secret lies yeah amen so when you think about what God wants God wants to have this perfect fellowship and think about this God working through Perfection it's not perfection in yourself amen it's God working through Perfection because he's perfect amen that's the channel he works through the church my and that just directly takes us over to Ephesians chapter 2 when we think about the great Ephesians Church they were mature they were in a condition where God actually could have fellowship with them it wasn't just like the Corinthians where he was just trying to straighten them out with all these carnal things and these habits and different things but the Ephesian Church were mature and God could have a certain specific Fellowship because they were mature and can take deeper things amen but he says this in verse four he says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us amen wow that's amazing that by his grace year SA Sav through faith and not of yourself it is a gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast and there in verse 10 it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God ha for ordained that we should walk in them you know this perfect fellowship if you think about a work of god is perfect the the psalm says God's ways are perfect his works are perfect and if we can take these thoughts out of our mind and fight against those carnal thoughts like oh I'm not perfect and but we're in fellowship with the perfect one who was the perfect sacrifice who sent a perfect message with a perfect word that gives perfect Faith amen it's the perfect sacrifice that's what we're in fellowship with tonight amen for we are his workmanship you're his workmanship why to think that you were sin you you were the whole cause why he came so that he can pay the price that you can become his righteousness my praise the Lord that's what love did for us for his great love wherewith he loved us oh my that should set the believer's heart a flame amen verse 13 it says this but now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who have made both one and have broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enity even the law of Commandments contain ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man and making peace that he might reconcile both unto to God in one body by the cross having slain the enity thereby oh my think about it what a fellowship that God he's done this marvelous work for us that he's taken the middle wall P down wow praise God what a work of righteousness amen verse 19 it says this for now now therefore ye are no more strangers or foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God Amen and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Cornerstone amen praise the Lord whoa I thought well if we're having Fellowship God works through this channel of perfection amen that's through Christ and when you're born again by the spirit of Christ you're in Christ amen and I thank God that he doesn't look at my flesh but he looks at my representation amen praise the Lord my you know it's sometimes you know as you go through life and you experience different things and work and things like that you realize that you know there's messes and and we were the ones that created them you I don't know about you but we we have this Humanity it's not perfect and we have to have fellowship with God sometimes say hey I made a mistake you know like our Pastor said you mark that place you got to go back and you with sincerity in my heart that the enemy got me off sides on that and man I slipped up but you forgive me on that cuz that's not like Christ but but I have a blood of Jesus Christ that we can have Fellowship that I can be cleansed and I don't have condemnation in my heart because God doesn't reckon that to me but he what he reckons is that seed that's on the inside amen that I will do the will of God I will confess my wrongs amen thanks be to God that there's something pulsating on the inside that will move despite the regret I might have but oh I got Victory amen you know but Believers are creators we have atmospheres you know how it is sometimes you just love to get in fellowship with certain ones and you're just like you just go around them and you're like man I just love to be around that person because why just feel the warmth of the presence of the Lord amen isn't that wonderful that you can be that hand extended brother Braham says this in a hidden life in Christ he said atmosphere God that's right and this is in 51 he says there's something about it fear is a horrible thing did you ever notice a dog the home I'm staying in had a big Shepherd and I walked into the yard today and here comes that big Shepherd through every everybody cuz I loved him when he was in uh he says that I can't pronounce that word very good but over in Germany as soon as I met the little doggy wouldn't make up with any with nobody but here he come that little Doxon jumped on me I loved him and he knew it they knew it and if you're really in your heart love people they know it my I mean this is a reality Saints you know when you really from your heart love somebody they know it I mean don't be deceived and think that you know like transparency but but they can really tell and he says you can't fool people they're not dumb you can make like you do they can tell you that they can they can tell you're only putting on and Satan can tell when you're putting on but he knows when it's real I like that part and the only way you might impersonate it you might make a whole lot of look like but you'll never get the job done until you come into Christ oh my that's perfect consecrated God Godly love sold out Lock Stock and Barrow come to Christ that's it friends that's true oh my but it's so hard to do amen many times because we have this mindset well excuse me you know I got to get I got to get this thing in order I got to get this thing in order first and I got I just got to be perfect before I come you know I mean if only I can get this thing right and this thing right then I'll come and have Fellowship that's not the way God wants it he wants to have perfect fellowship with what he's done and how he's doing it in our lives amen oh my my again in EP in Ephesians now we'll jump to chapter 3 he says and this is in verse three he says how be it that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery oh my think of that you know it's not by intellectualism that we really can have the Life of Christ flowing amen it has to be personal it has to be God quickening it to us and that's the job of the holy spirit amen he says whereby when when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ unto me who am the least of all the saints even this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make known all men to make known all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ amen and I just boy I tell you it wraps up right there in 15 and 17 or 15 through 17 but he says this in whom all the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that we might Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which path knowledge that you might be filled with help me finish that all of the fullness of God oh my like like that's what I want God to reveal to me like you like do you wake up do I wake up in the morning and say God I'm praying that you would reveal to me the love of Christ that all of the fullness of God is within me then you're more than a match to every obstacle that comes your way if this Love Of Christ that he's speaking of there that you're rooted and grounded in love oh my you think about that scripture how perfect love cast out fear that's the kind of Christian we want to be we want to walk in with our shoulders back I'm a child of the king you know he's a king conqueror love conquered sin not just sin of the world but sin in me amen that I can be free from my past that's one of the greatest things that I've ever known is freedom from the sin of my life amen to be to worship Him and serve him with no shackles praise the Lord oh my you know sometimes in our approach to God or to situations you know sometimes we need Revelation to hit us because we've been approaching it in a certain way for a long time and that's part of the fellowship right God deals with us as sons and we're in the adoption age and it's it's not always that we figure things out on our own right how many of us figured this out on our own not me not me I I got a lot of lumps on my head but praise the Lord you know I like how that the transparency of our Prophet the transparencies of the servants that's gone before that they were willing to stand there and not just tell the good but tell the bad you know and I think about this uh testimony that brother brandham gives in a message called it wasn't so from the beginning preached in 1960 but he says and this is in U paragraph 15 he says did you ever meet a people that you just love to be with you had that and why they created that atmosphere their life the way they lived and the things they talked about they love the love they have for you you've heard my message on the pum you know and on the bees trying to sting me and the bull trying to kill me you create an atmosphere atere and that atmosphere you have to you have to be in prayer for the sick see it's the same thing it's love that casts out evil spirits you know if if what we're Desiring in the fellowship with God to Perfection like we're wanting to have we know that this is the hour of the great capping of the love of God Amen and so it's my Earnest expectation that this atmosphere of the love of of Christ would be on display like I'm looking for it not that I want to see a bull charging me or some bees swarming up on me but in the spiritual you know the very Love Of Christ like I can have an atmosphere that Christ can move upon my heart and I can speak something and I can say whatever you want just ask it right now I want to be in that condition of heart that I know it's not me speaking but I've been moved upon by the love of God Amen and so we think about this testimony there was a man named brother fander and this you know he was uh he was kind of a skeptic and he was kind of hearing about the meetings and he was hanging around with some of the people that were missionaries to some Indians and he all of the sudden was coaching somebody hey why don't you go over to the meetings and there was some sick Indians but he was like you know he was kind of standing back a little bit watching and all of a sudden he got discerned and all of a sudden he's like wait a minute yeah I did bring them over the prophet's dealing with him now and he's like yeah you brought this person and they had TB and all this and all of a sudden my he gave his heart to the Lord you know the Lord dealt with him here he was kind of kind of scoffing maybe like zakus you know hiding up in the tree or something but all of a sudden God he dealt with him and this is picking up in um paragraph I believe 20 but he said brother frandler one of them sitting back there studying to be in Ministry he says you suffer with TB right and the man that brought you a little fellow here by a certain name said he's suspicious that's done it he become a servant of the Lord not long ago we were going across the country and he said unto me he said brother brandom you know my wife don't believe this and said every night when I get when I go to church and come home and says oh she just starts balling me out as soon as I hit the door and I get her by the hand that she's little and I hold her and I try to cast that devil out as hard as I can said reminds me of the message he says I try to cast out that devil and say devil you come out of my wife devil you can't come to my wife honey you're possessed with the devil come out of her devil said oh that's fine brother fander but you go about it all wrong that's the wrong way my goodness he said well how do you do it he says well when you come home you buy her a box of candies and you give it to her you put it in the door and you put her arms around her they shall cast out Devils love cast out fear doesn't it friend love that's what the world is dying for that's one of the greatest things that we're leaving out of our Pentecostal blessings too much is the love that's mixed together the mortar that makes the gifts and all the things of God perfectly is the love one of the other this will men all men know that you are my disciples amen praise God this is the kind of Fellowship that God can you know just like a a real father or a real mother they they correct their children there's certain attitudes that we've accepted that's not perfect fellowship with God but oh my I want to get and I say God deal with my heart whatever it takes try me search me if there there be any wicked way I don't want to see myself I want to see Jesus Christ manifested once again he promised it we don't want to lower our standards you know we don't want to live below our privileges for so long the hour has come amen whoa that's Love's approach I like that oh my w yeah you know this is a very popular uh one that we repeat very much because it's so important you know it can never be overemphasized the need for us to call upon God for Revelation but out of the exposition of the church ages in Jes the revelation of Jesus Christ is how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open become yielded to the spirit and hear and know amen and that's what the burden was and the testimony the fellowship that brother Tommy and I had he was like God I I believe we believe we'll bind together we want to see you move if there's something some need or some situation that we're not privy to but we want to be those willing vessels and so as we were working this man it was on to brother Tommy's heart he just he just started talking to him about the Lord you know and it was it was marvelous and and at the end of it I mean he he was really hungry you can tell that the Lord touched his heart and we were about to leave and I said you know I said oh um you know if if if uh you know if you want prayer I mean do you have a need and oh it was just blessed you know you know how the presence of the Lord could just leave a man totally just I mean with everything open it was a it was a joyful thing but you know that's the desire because as this quote goes it's the revelation of the will of God that gives you authority over the devil you know that's what God wants to give us because we live too much in the past we won't move and ask God for something because of the failures of yesterday like oh I didn't make my bill oh I ran over the curb I busted my we're always focusing on our imperfections but God he's given us a perfect word he's given us a perfect promise that if we would just go before him lay before him that he would give us something that would Prevail over the devil in our lives the perfect revelation of God overcomes the enemy that's what we want to ask God for I want to overcome the enemy God you have a perfect Revelation for me in this season I don't want to shrink back say I got I got a revelation yesterday I need a revelation right now God he wouldn't tell us and ask us to pray for Revelation and to continually pray because he wants to give us more and more but we get caught up I get caught up The Daily Grind the Warfare we forget we lose focus but oh my just like our pastor was saying we want to have a certain focus and discern the spirits that are influencing us that keep us from going to our knees and asking God for Revelation my you know and um we'll skip some cuz we're doing good we're doing good everybody feeling okay praise the lord it's Sunday in 1 John chap 2 in verse one it says my little children these things are right unto you that you sin not and if a man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not only for ours only but also the sin of the world and hereby we know that we know we know that we know him now there's there's a twetter word right there it's right behind it says if if if we keep his Commandments amen he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected my whereby we know that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him also so to walk is even as he walked my I just think about that wonderful scripture and you can put it up there it's in Corinthians chapter uh 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and um verse 21 but you think about the work of God that God can take the bleach of the blood and your sin because red Sin and the red blood red through red is white and to think that your life if we can look at it say oh I'm not perfect but I'm not looking at my imperfections I'm looking at the work of Calvary I'm looking at what the power of the blood has transformed me amen made me what I was in the beginning see it says he that made him my I got to look that I love that this this is this is a perfect work of God Amen you think about it but it says this he ha made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might become the righteousness of God in him amen I love that so much you know and it just makes the Simplicity of God when someone would accept the work of Calvary how that transaction that Divine transaction I'm nothing I have all this sin I have all this unrighteousness but I'll accept the righteousness of the work of Calvary that unit me back to the perfect word of God Amen my I love that so much you know I just I want to encourage you with this thought and our Prophet spoke this and this is out of the message God's power of transformation and this is in paragraph 64 he says everything's under control to bring forth of its own kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stays in the right category it would be exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because he had made it that way and made a channel that anything would stay in his channel in the line of his word it will have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would would do it can't move from there it's Channel just exactly right so everything in the trust of his son that it would be that way then God said it is good so I'll just rest and each one of those seeds has the power in itself to be transformed itself into the species that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed trans forming power to make in itself in its potentials now to make out of it exactly what I want it to be and God has never changed amen oh I think that word is perfect amen God planted that seed that can transform and all the power is within it so when we pray we're not praying to something outside we're praying to something on the inside it's God in you amen that's quickening the very Life of Christ we don't have to guess about it we know it's there it's the love of God that moves us to act upon his word by faith I you know you can't explain love it can't be scientifically proven but you can see people when they love they're moving they're walking they're doing they open the door for people that maybe are rude to them you know different things you know it's manifested in different ways but you can recognize it I was mentioning this to some of the brothers I had a a customer and the customer brother Matthew referred him to me he's done some tree work and I was going to do some restoration work for him and they you know want the customer was blind he used to be in the military and he was under explosives or something you know that was part of his job and he ended up catching blindness from his occupation and he had been in that condition I I would guess presume more than 10 years and he was probably 60 years old but anyway as I was speaking with him and his current companion you know she had that blue hair and you know she was just very outspoken and you know just you know just you know worldly type person right but I found something very real about him and so I was testifying to him he was like my back hurts and I began to tell him you know God he took me from a condition of Brokenness where I had no hope you know the doctors I went to many different doctors probably close to 20 doctors and some specialist they wanted to do this and do that do this and I just so I was testifying to him about the power of God and she's there and she I could see her kind of rubbing up on her chair just like oh man she was battling so much stuff just wanting to cut me right off and just silence me just in a moment but I was just in my heart burdened for this person in this condition and when you know the power of God to be a the potentials of of Deliverance and salvation you want to you want to share it with somebody you can't shut up you I can't hold this down this is a secret mystery that there's something in me that can move upon this situation and and things be different and so I was telling them I was like you know I was in that condition but God Heen rich in Mercy I I didn't know he loved me I didn't know he paid the price for me I didn't know he bore strides but I accepted it and I think she had enough she's just straight up just said I'm agnostic I don't believe in God and she just kind of started letting me have it I said you know and so I kind of slowed down a little bit and just kind of let her say her thing you know I was in her house you know and I I don't know if he ever knew what she looked like before he met her you know and I was just kind of you know I was just you know but I I was just sitting there kind of waiting for the Lord like I'm just going to keep silent right now and just see what the Lord has and all the sudden he said something he said you know even even blindness recognize kindness something to that effect and I did I realize you know a lot of times if you'll take your stand for God God will stand for you even in the midst of your enemy amen and I got to thinking how profound was that that I was willing to just go out there and testify and then they get the tongue lashing and feel all of that weirdness but then God come and speak back to my heart through this man who I had a burden but the love of God bounced back to me and it's now speaking a greater illumination wow even blindness recognize kindness that's the Christian walk amen there we're walking in a world that's blind miserable naked and don't know it but they recognize the love of God Amen that's what we want to be soldiers of the the cross we don't want to let down and let go we want to give our heart to the Lord that he can oh God even in the midst of all this chaos there's a stabilizer it's the bride of Christ under their messenger amen You're the Only Hope left my you know there's such a a dynamic Revelation in this hour and God wants to make known by Fellowship amen you know it was God in the G The Garden of gethe you know in in things that are to be brother Bram talked about when Jesus was there praying and he was praying in such earnestness if this cup could pass if this cup could pass and you know it was at that time that he saw you in your condition in your suffering and you're struggling but he knew that if that cup would pass and he wouldn't partake of that cup that you could not be well you could not be saved you could not become the son or daughter that he's called you to be amen so he just stayed there a little longer he said not my will but thine be done and the one thing that God when he was there asking the father the one thing he prayed he prayed for your your companionship he prayed for your fellowship God wanted you to know him in his attributes as a savior as a Healer what a fellowship that God wants to have this kind of communion and fellowship with you and I amen isn't that wonderful I think it's marvelous why don't we read that in John uh John 17 you know let the words speak again amen oh what a marvelous things you know it is what it is but that's not what will be because what will be is what he prayed for you think about a powerful prayer if a man of God can come and pray for you but what about the King of Kings and the Lord of lords what kind of Fellowship can we have with his prayer in John 17 we'll just start right right there and let's let's start in verse 20 we'll just read through 26 but he says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee and they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glor Glory which thou gavest me I give it them you're Eternal your Eternal thoughts of God made flesh today it's the glory of God to take your unrighteousness your filthy rags amen and make you white as snow what a glory of God to transform you from what you were to what he always desired amen says Thou that they may be one as thou father are in me and I in the in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave is me I give them that they may be one even as we are one I and them thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom thou givest me be with me where I am my what a fellowship that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loved me before the foundation of the world world oh righteous father the world have not known thee but I Know Thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them now you talk about a a prayer you talk about a perfect Fellowship when God answers your prayer and that reality is quickened that's what I want to see the word made flesh again we don't have to back up to the devil when we make a shortcoming we have perfect Fellowship because we confess our faults and the blood of Jesus cleanses us of all unrighteousness Amen brother Brandon would make this statement and we'll try to wind down as we now are at a good time but in this in the um God's power of transformation you know I think it's important to recognize what God's doing in our lives amen and this is a you know it's just to constantly be revived every day amen but he says this and this is in paragraph 235 he says Sons and Daughters was in the beginning in God in the beginning now look if you've got eternal life you say we believe it then you've got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God that's the only thing there is eternal is God then if you got eternal life that life that is in you always was and you were in the loins of God before before there was ever a world even the word itself Jesus himself is called the word and in St John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then you were in Jesus loins and went to Calvary with him you died with him you were raised with him and today you're sitting in heaven heavly places in him filled with his Spirit Sons and Daughters of God died with him raised with him sure now then now now you can have fellowship with him see you couldn't back there because you were just a word in him a seed but now he has manifest you and now he wants to have Fellowship ship with him he wants you to have fellowship with him then he came down and was made flesh so that you can perfectly fellowship with you see the per perfect Fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of God how wonderful see God couldn't have Fellowship in the spirit so God became a man with us Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was the son because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in no man had seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father had declared him God built himself a house a body to live in come down so that you could touch him 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh seen of angels believed on and received up into heaven you being flesh him being flesh then you can have fellowship with one another cuz he was a God's attribute of love God is love is that right and Jesus was God's attribute of love and when the attribute of love was displayed which that was God himself all the attributes that hung on him came to him all that the father was given me will come to me surely they were predestinated and if you wasn't there you won't be there that's all certainly now we can have Fellowship through the riches of his word in which you are a part of you were a part of the word cuz he was the word at the beginning and you're the word now see we'll jump ahead a little bit right there and just go he says listen there's one thing I can't do I can't brag on my ancestry no I come from awful mess amen my father was an Irishman my mother was an Indian Squall half Indian her mother was an Indian draw a penion now all of them drunk almost with them most of them died with their shoots shoes on fighting gunfighters and so forth I can't brag on nothing about that cuz all my an my cuz my ancestry and my family tree is terrible but brother there's one thing I can brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus who redeemed me what a fellowship and he was and with his transforming power planted a seed by predestination and I saw it whose son am I now yeah I can brag on him I spent 33 years of my life bragging on him if he would spare me another 33 years I try to brag on him more on him see I I can brag on my ancestry Hallelujah he that redeemed me and planted the seed of life in here and let me look upon this word and send down his spirit and said here it is speak this and it'll happen do this oh my can brag on him how did he do it through the washing of the Water by the word the Waters of Separation you know that's that's the fellowship that we have so I just want to encourage you tonight you know it's one of those things that I I think that we really must focus in because the enemy constantly trying to look at our Humanity the veil he wants you to look at mine and all my faults and failures he wants you to see all yours but that's not our fellowship we're not walking in carnality we're walking in the spirit in the spirit of love to be moved on that you know it's because this love of God is actually giving us confidence in what he said that's what Galatians 5 I believe it says it says faith worketh by love amen oh wondering Stars how will you wonder Methodist Baptists Outsiders whatever you might be wanding stars from church to church from pillar to place and from television to television world to World why don't you come over he longs to have fellowship with you he is longing for you he wants to trans form you by the renewing of your mind not to be a church or a denomination but to his word which you are a part of if you desire if the desire is in you amen we invite the musicians to come and you know I think you know it's so powerful to recognize you know that God put something in you and we were fellowshipping in the back but it's one of those things that if we didn't have a thirst for God it would be like we would be without a a beacon you know shell we'd be selling on life's journey without a without any light but thank God there's a hunger on the inside that says I can't be content with these messes I'm making I want to have a different kind of Fellowship you know I I want to have to where God takes preeminence in my life that I'm not just trying to fix up all these messes I want to have a different kind of Fellowship where I go to God and then God he illuminates the path go this way son and I want to have that sensitivity I want to have that Focus that God he will fulfill what he promised and lead us by Revelation that's the kind of Fellowship he desires that it would be I in you and you and me in that day what day that's this day what a privileged people we are to be able to be led by God and to be called the sons of God the scripture says what manner of love is this that we should be called the sons of God Amen God bless you you're a privileged people may we stand [Music] [Music] amen maybe as we prepared to turn the service over to brother Billy and maybe any closing thoughts and you know it's God's desire to speak to us and I don't want my mind to be so clouded with the cares of the world the burdens of life and the pressures that are all around us that we can't get so focused that you know if there is a value to be obtained the greatest value for a Believer is revelation like we the devil's putting carrots out here and carrots out there chase after this chased after this but oh my the only thing that brings satisfaction to the believer is when the will of God is made known and we act on it because that is the satisfying portion that is what God planted in our heart and we will not be satisfied until we know thus sayeth the Lord and act on it amen if you desire that God would move in this special way and God has spoke to you and you just want to Bow your heads and you want to ask God God you moved on my heart tonight and I want to receive this Revelation this understanding that you want to have perfect fellowship with me let's pray together heavenly father it's my desire Lord Lord that what your Prophet taught and all these Witnesses in the word of God speaking of oh God to to keep in this kind of Fellowship Lord a perfect Fellowship what you've done and how you planted the seed in US Lord I pray that the realities of it would move Upon Us Lord that we would act upon it Lord and that you would meet us in those secret places Lord in the chambers of our heart maybe that we're holding to but oh Father you want to God pour out all your goodness Lord as we fellowshipped around the scripture Lord I pray that You' make it a reality that those who are hungering and thirsting those that have raised their hands father be their portion tonight in Jesus Christ name amen let's sing this the love of God the love of God is great then tongue or and ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches [Music] to the lowest the guil down with God gave me his every child he [Music] re [Music] and oh love of God how rich and how [Music] me it [Music] [Music] shall with GL re time shall pass away and Earthly throne and [Music] kingom refuse to break on rocks and Hill and mountains love so shall still how me and redeeming [Music] to the Saints [Music] think about it love of God how rich and pure how made you and it more the Saints of [Music] maybe before we sing that next verse if somebody here you want prayer and you know you're you're not satisfied with something that's bothering you or keeping you from making that next big move with the Lord all it takes is one moment in the presence of the Lord you make a move for God God Will Make a Move for you I just wanted to give an opportunity to anybody who wants to come be prayed for or you want to ask something special from God we want to invite you to come and we know that there's many times that God will deal with somebody and they just pass it by but don't pass your opportunity tonight this may be the last opportunity but God bless you and as we turn this service over to brother Billy let's sing that together could we with the ocean f [Music] oh where on earth a great oh and and every man oh a scribe I trade to R the love of God above oh and we the [Music] your and no strong cont the those R from Sky to SK oh love of God how reach and F how [Music] Angel oh shout forever more and the s name hallelujah amen I surely enjoy that amen that was refreshing Amen to just you know there's so many times we try to do things by government you know by trying to conform people do this and do that but my the greatest force of all is love that if somebody you could just transmit the love it will take care of all it's all the frustration will be taken out of it it will be with understanding you know that's what God wants us we didn't come to God because of uh some uh human Force forces or some Conformity because we thought oh if I don't do this no it was when the love was projected when we saw that what we were living at we were living below our privileges when we realized that we were in deepen we needed help we needed somebody to love us somebody to come and give his life for us it's when we realized that in the condition that we were in we needed help and he came to help us when his love became projected that's when we real realiz oh my I'm really living under my privilege and that's how we come to him and so if that's the way we came in how are we going to translate the other people how are we now going to turn around and use government forces or use some type of law or legalism to try to bring the others no it can only be done by the same love you know the prophet tells us that love is the greatest force that ever existed love the love that can forgive all things and love that can look over love that covers the multitude of sins and love that just looks and and it doesn't matter how deep in sin a person is love makes a way back I was thinking about this and I don't know if you can find it but bam says this in the message question and answer um paragraph uh preach on 54103 um I believe it's in the morning paragraph 57 he says this now I will admit that people study too much they try to go too far ahead and try to think too hard and sometimes have mental breakdown the things on the account of studying about the Lord you must quit that you don't have to do that the only thing you do the only thing you have to do is fall in love with them just think about that we say don't sin don't do that let the person fall in love with God show the love of God and let the person realize that God can do this for me that's right and that is the thing that would change anything else they would do will actually be a covering because it will be them doing it by fear by government them doing it because they don't want the results of what's going to produce and they're scared and by fear but when it's done by love it's the true conversion it says just the thing the thing the only thing you have to do is fall in love with him and just grow right on loving him amen it's not trying to push into something or make yourself something you are not just go ahead and let God use you in the way that he wants to do that he wants to just yield yourself commit yourself and walk on Happy singing rejoicing that's the way I thought you know that's the fellowship that God is looking for you know I love how bam I was telling brother Andrew you know many people will come and say oh butam you don't know your Bible it says well that might be true but I know the altar real well when you in love with the altar when you know the altar real well it straightens up everything it takes care of everything so if we can instead of this approach of by trying to uh uh uh with with go on with frustration and trying to how how come I can't do this how come I'm falling short here how come just fall in love with him let the fellowship be the fellowship by love he came down from heaven he he it wasn't by frustration no it was the love of God what greater love it is than a man will lay down his life for the other When Love Was projected everything else came on the scene and it was manifested and that's what God is asking of us tonight oh I tell you I I was so just touched within my heart I say God let me be motivated by love and not by frustration let me be motivated by love and not by my a human understanding let love be the motivation of everything that I do because with love I would win a lot more than I would with my own frustration amen amen amen let's just sing that song uh key of D amen how do you [Music] explain oh and how do you describe oh and a love that goes from me way and runs as deep as it is WI oh and you know all I hope Lord you know all I feel oh and words cannot express the love we feel but we long for you to hear oh who listen to our hearts
