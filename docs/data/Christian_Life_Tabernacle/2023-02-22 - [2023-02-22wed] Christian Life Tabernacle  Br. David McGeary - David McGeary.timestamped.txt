[33:16] with you
[33:21] or precious father
[33:25] Lord we know that's true
[33:27] that there is such a place
[33:30] because you said I go to prepare a place
[33:33] for you
[33:34] that where I am you may be also
[33:39] and father to know that
[33:42] [Music]
[33:43] it's always the last miles of any race
[33:48] that's the most difficult
[33:52] and it's been a long uphill climb Lord
[33:56] but we know that just a few more days
[34:02] any moment now
[34:04] we can be changed in the twinkling of an
[34:07] eye father
[34:09] to ever be with the Lord
[34:12] father we look up
[34:14] because we know our Redemption draweth
[34:18] nigh bless your word to us tonight
[34:21] father we ask it in Jesus precious and
[34:25] wonderful name we pray amen
[34:29] amen if you have your Bibles let's open
[34:32] to Galatians
[34:35] the first chapter of Galatians in read
[34:39] one
[34:43] verses 1 through
[34:45] 5.
[34:47] and
[34:48] um
[34:51] Paul speaking here writing to the church
[34:53] at galatia
[34:55] he said in chapter 1 verse 1
[35:00] he says Paul an apostle
[35:03] not of men
[35:05] neither by man
[35:08] but by Jesus Christ and God the Father
[35:13] who raised him from the dead
[35:18] and all the Brethren who are with me
[35:22] unto the churches of galatia
[35:26] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[35:31] father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:34] who gave himself
[35:37] for our sins that he might Deliver Us
[35:41] from
[35:42] this present evil age according to the
[35:47] will of God and our father
[35:51] to whom be glory forever and ever
[35:55] amen father we ask me to bless your word
[35:58] to us in your precious name we pray amen
[36:02] you may be seated
[36:08] the scripture tells us that
[36:11] in the last days perilous times
[36:15] shall come
[36:16] and I think that we look at Israel and
[36:20] we know about the time clock of what's
[36:24] going on there
[36:25] and we can also look at the condition of
[36:29] the world around us because the
[36:32] condition of the world around us
[36:35] testifies to where that we are
[36:38] and in every age the prophet of God said
[36:42] the Believers or the church nominal
[36:46] missed their place in that age
[36:50] and so I think that if we begin to
[36:53] understand but what is what is going on
[36:58] around us what is transpiring
[37:02] the what is finding its place and its
[37:06] position
[37:07] and so as we're going to listen to Just
[37:10] 30 minutes this evening of a portion out
[37:13] of this God of this evil age and I
[37:17] believe that brother Brandon preached
[37:19] this in the last part of his ministry
[37:23] the last year of his ministry and he
[37:27] he's warning the people of what is
[37:31] starting to take place
[37:34] that what Satan's doing how what he's
[37:38] rising to what he's taking control of to
[37:42] what it is and how that and and you'll
[37:46] hear it hear how that he's ascended to
[37:49] the place where he
[37:52] has become the object of worship
[37:55] and he said millions and millions of
[37:59] people
[38:00] Ark worshiping him and don't know it
[38:04] okay so that's our goal our goal is to
[38:08] is to establish our faith on two fronts
[38:13] Faith because we have discernment
[38:17] to see the evil of this age because it's
[38:22] been revealed to us it shouldn't
[38:25] discourage us it should build our faith
[38:29] Leslie and I were writing in the truck
[38:31] the other day and we had the news on and
[38:34] they begin to speak
[38:36] about how uh we're moving closer to a
[38:41] nuclear conflict that Russia is talking
[38:44] about making nuclear strikes and how
[38:48] that it's possible that China made
[38:52] invade Taiwan and and all this stuff
[38:56] again all and you know and it sounded
[38:59] like terrible news we're on the verge of
[39:01] nuclear war unless he said praise God
[39:04] it's happening
[39:07] men praise God it's happening
[39:10] you know what I mean and it's happening
[39:13] Church
[39:14] you understand the the move towards the
[39:18] mark of the beast the move towards uh uh
[39:21] these things are are are tremendous and
[39:26] there's all these little nuggets in
[39:28] God's word that that speaks to us and
[39:32] and tells us certain things and uh
[39:36] and so we're going to start up right
[39:39] around paragraph 70 uh
[39:43] five I believe it is and we're just
[39:46] going to go to the end of paragraph 115.
[39:49] It's just uh 30 minutes but I'd like
[39:54] just to to
[39:55] um uh Satan started out what brother
[39:59] Graham's going to start out saying to us
[40:01] he said notice how beautifully the
[40:04] scriptures tie themselves together in
[40:08] every age
[40:09] notice now
[40:12] and I think when you see these little
[40:14] statements brother Graham says notice
[40:17] now and it's almost like a signal take
[40:20] notice I'm going to say something and he
[40:24] goes on for a little bit and he he
[40:26] ministers and then he comes and he makes
[40:29] this statement
[40:32] he says
[40:34] the day we are living in you will you'll
[40:37] hear it in just a moment the day we are
[40:40] living in is called in the Bible the day
[40:43] of man man's day
[40:46] this is not God's day
[40:51] okay his Day's coming
[40:55] okay
[40:56] God is not the God of this Earth the
[41:01] Bible says he isn't he's the god of
[41:05] Heaven but this is but this is not God's
[41:10] day this is choosing day
[41:16] you understand because so to what in
[41:19] order for God to be just
[41:22] to Sodom and Gomorrah in order for God
[41:25] to be just for every other age in order
[41:28] for God to be just to eat in order for
[41:32] God to be just and he said just God he's
[41:35] got to present you with the same choice
[41:39] and he knew what choice you would make
[41:44] you understand that's why he loved Jacob
[41:47] and he hated Esau the children not yet
[41:51] being born neither having done any good
[41:54] or evil because he knew what was in
[41:57] Jacob's heart Jacob craved that
[41:59] Birthright
[42:01] he craved he craved his his life was was
[42:05] it was
[42:08] given to the value of that Birthright
[42:12] and if you ever study the birthright the
[42:15] firstborn got a
[42:17] two-thirds of The Possession the others
[42:20] got left there's blessings that came
[42:23] with the birthright and and they craved
[42:27] that now God's looking at us and asking
[42:30] ourselves do you crave the blessings
[42:33] that come with God's word
[42:36] do you crave the the the the life and
[42:40] the and the spirit that comes with God's
[42:44] word you crave the fruits of the word of
[42:48] God and and obedience to the word of God
[42:51] produces the spirit of the word of God
[42:54] that in other words the word is only
[42:58] manifested in the flesh when it's obeyed
[43:02] and we kind of went over that Sunday so
[43:05] we're moving now to to where he says
[43:09] it's choosing time so he's presenting us
[43:12] the choice but to choose this day whom
[43:16] you will serve as for me and my house
[43:19] will serve the Lord
[43:21] after and uh and Jesus challenged them
[43:25] too he says tell me where I haven't
[43:28] fulfilled the word of God you say that
[43:30] you have Moses but they are which which
[43:33] testifies of me so we're gonna watch in
[43:37] just the next 30 minutes as the
[43:40] scriptures
[43:42] before they were ever spoken years ago
[43:45] when they were spoken how they described
[43:49] the age that we're living in and what's
[43:51] going on now because we're still living
[43:54] in a scriptural world
[43:58] okay and what I mean by that is is the
[44:02] word is still coming to pass
[44:05] and and the word is still determining
[44:09] and controlling the course of man
[44:13] so command is on a a a a a road to
[44:18] describe destruction and it was
[44:21] prophesied
[44:23] and spoken of in the word of God that
[44:26] man would go down this road to
[44:29] destruction if we can sit back and if if
[44:34] nothing uh else could make a deduction
[44:38] if the scripture says they're on the
[44:40] road to destruction and this is the time
[44:43] that we're living in and this has come
[44:46] to pass how much closer must we be to
[44:49] the coming of the Lord
[44:51] occur or how much more sincere I should
[44:55] be because this is the most deceitful
[44:59] age
[45:00] and Satan has become the god of this age
[45:03] and he's got people worshiping him
[45:07] that don't even know it and it causes us
[45:11] to to to take heed
[45:14] and and and uh
[45:17] and and and Shake ourselves and realize
[45:21] that if if all these promises are coming
[45:24] to pass how much more is the promise of
[45:27] our Redemption coming to pass also and
[45:31] then I just thought I would read this
[45:33] other little statement
[45:35] because it to me it it was remarkable in
[45:41] its in its way how that uh
[45:46] how that the world testifies of the word
[45:48] of God and can't help it
[45:50] how many know that we have
[45:53] two great political movements in our
[45:57] country now
[45:59] one they referred to as the conservative
[46:02] movement
[46:04] which is a
[46:07] the people that that believe in
[46:11] traditional family uh values and church
[46:17] values and uh you know some form of
[46:23] moral uh fortitude and and that's all
[46:28] that way I can express it but listen to
[46:31] what the prophet of God said I just
[46:33] thought it's it struck me he says and
[46:36] notice he preached that kind of
[46:39] scientific
[46:41] social
[46:43] educated
[46:45] Progressive gospel to Eve
[46:50] and I thought you've got to be kidding
[46:52] me
[46:53] everything they're talking about today
[46:55] is Progressive
[46:57] I'm Progressive is the progressives
[46:59] we're progressing
[47:03] you know we're we're getting to work
[47:06] we're we're moving on and and I I just
[47:11] couldn't believe it I I I I thought you
[47:14] know there's no place they won't go
[47:16] they're passing a law
[47:19] that you can't have your dog stick its
[47:23] head out the window of a car yeah
[47:30] no that's serious
[47:32] they're going to put that to a vote that
[47:35] you can't have your dog have its head
[47:38] out the window because it might be
[47:40] damaging to the dog
[47:43] something might get in its eye
[47:45] or the wind might dry out its uh
[47:52] you know I I dogs love to stick their
[47:56] head out the window look you know
[47:58] something about a dog it won't eat
[48:00] something that's poison
[48:02] you know what I mean because they know
[48:03] it's not good for them they won't eat it
[48:06] you know what I mean and if they're not
[48:09] going to stick their head out the window
[48:11] if they think it's doing them harm oh
[48:13] but guess what
[48:14] man knows what's best
[48:17] you know I mean we're going to protect
[48:19] the dogs
[48:20] we don't care about humans
[48:22] you know what I mean we don't care about
[48:25] the all the the millions of unborn
[48:30] children we don't care about all these
[48:32] things but bless God we're going to stop
[48:35] people from having their poor dog dip
[48:39] their head out
[48:40] the window
[48:46] you know
[48:50] we used to stick our hands out the
[48:52] window to make
[48:54] hand signals how many knows what this is
[48:58] that's
[49:00] right right
[49:01] left
[49:03] this is no dog out the window
[49:08] and I want to
[49:10] I I I wanted just to add
[49:13] a touchy humor to it because I want us
[49:18] not to let
[49:20] what's happening in this world
[49:23] gobias without recognizing what it is
[49:28] what is happening can you you know they
[49:32] they say we've woke up where we've
[49:35] awakened to all the social injustice to
[49:39] all the history
[49:41] there after the classics now they want
[49:44] to get rid of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer
[49:47] and and these books and that books and
[49:50] do away with Alice in Wonderland and and
[49:53] uh uh I I don't know you know the little
[49:58] story where the girl clicks her heels
[50:01] and ends up in a tornado in Kansas
[50:03] somewhere okay pretty soon you it Kansas
[50:07] will be taken off of the map it's it's
[50:10] you understand it's absolutely insane
[50:15] what's taking place but watch it in the
[50:18] word of God
[50:20] how the prophet of God
[50:22] describes it
[50:24] how he shares with us how it's unfolding
[50:29] where it came from and and then the next
[50:33] part he talks to us how he did it
[50:37] and so we'll just listen to this
[50:39] portions very got some very strong
[50:43] um
[50:45] um
[50:46] statements in it but if you believe
[50:49] God's word
[50:51] then you've got to believe God's word
[50:54] for the age
[50:55] and and this is God's Divine
[50:59] interpretation of how the word of God is
[51:02] coming to pass in our day and I can say
[51:06] this to you a hundred percent you can
[51:08] bet your life on it I know that's not a
[51:11] good terminology to use I hope nobody
[51:14] misunderstands that but you can place
[51:17] the confidence of your life
[51:20] in this message I place my salvation in
[51:23] this message a hundred percent because
[51:26] it's the word of God so as we start with
[51:28] that paragraph and he says just watch
[51:31] how beautifully the scriptures blend
[51:34] together for each age sit back let's
[51:36] enjoy 30 minutes and we'll close quickly
[51:38] after
[51:40] and we'll be out of there and I hope
[51:44] that
[51:45] the parking lot lights help you this
[51:48] evening God richly bless you as we
[51:50] listen to the word of God
[51:54] notice how beautiful
[51:57] the scriptures tie themselves together
[51:59] in every age notice now
[52:02] and when the church world
[52:04] would not have the word of God to rule
[52:07] over them they accepted a murder
[52:11] Barabbas
[52:13] what did this do it exalted Satan the
[52:17] God of this evil age
[52:21] to the place that he's always wanted
[52:24] now listen for Satan is not spoke of as
[52:29] a god of any other age but this age
[52:33] he once spoke of the god of the age of
[52:35] Noah
[52:36] you once spoke of of the god of the age
[52:39] of Moses
[52:40] the god of the age of Elijah but this
[52:44] evil age
[52:46] he is the oh don't miss it
[52:51] he is the god
[52:54] of this evil age
[52:56] worshiped
[52:58] bye
[53:00] millions and billions of people
[53:03] and they don't know it but let's let the
[53:05] scripture uncover him this morning
[53:08] NSD then you'll know
[53:10] let the scripture as in the meetings of
[53:13] discernment
[53:15] when the Holy Spirit gets among his word
[53:18] and he clouds out this man and says you
[53:20] have no business living with this other
[53:22] woman
[53:24] what did you do that for 10 years ago
[53:26] when you run off of that man's wife
[53:29] what's he doing uncovered him
[53:32] exposing Satan that's got the man bound
[53:35] or the woman
[53:38] a woman's husband are the sins that
[53:41] they've done the things that they have
[53:43] done
[53:45] what does it do exposing the doctors
[53:48] take instruments and try to find what's
[53:49] wrong they can't do it we can't tell but
[53:52] then the Holy Spirit comes out and
[53:54] reveals what he is
[53:56] and exposes him see that's what the word
[54:00] of God is
[54:02] it is a light that shines in darkness
[54:05] and when you take a noise in the room it
[54:08] sounds mysterious
[54:10] a bunch of something working
[54:13] and you don't know what it is turn on
[54:15] the light
[54:16] quickly crickets roaches they're they
[54:21] are children of the darkness
[54:23] and when the light flashes they scatter
[54:25] away
[54:27] they went out from us because it was an
[54:30] obvious the Bible said see
[54:32] they cannot live in the light of the
[54:34] world for the god of Heaven is sent his
[54:36] light in this place they said he might
[54:38] lighten
[54:40] the path for his children's he might not
[54:43] walk in darkness and stumble but they
[54:45] might walk in the light of The Shining
[54:47] of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:49] and forever
[54:50] amen
[54:53] notice Satan not called the god of any
[54:56] other age but this age
[54:58] it was his ambition to be like God from
[55:02] the very beginning
[55:03] let's read that we just take your time
[55:05] let's go back down let's see I got Rhoda
[55:07] Isaiah 14. let's go back here to Isaiah
[55:10] 14 just a minute and see what God Said
[55:13] the god
[55:15] what Satan did Isaiah 14 12.
[55:18] and 14.
[55:22] notice
[55:24] how art thou falling from Heaven o
[55:27] Lucifer
[55:29] son of the morning how are God cast down
[55:32] to the ground which did weaken the
[55:35] Nations
[55:37] for thou has sit in thine heart
[55:40] I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt
[55:44] my throne above the stars of God
[55:48] sons of God now
[55:50] and I will set
[55:52] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[55:58] in the side of the North
[56:01] it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped
[56:05] like God
[56:07] he took two-thirds two-thirds of the
[56:09] stars of Heaven ascended himself above
[56:12] those stars and preached to them and
[56:13] deceived two-thirds of them
[56:17] you see it
[56:18] all right notice that's his ambition and
[56:22] now he is ready with his careful
[56:27] selected educated bride by his own
[56:31] knowledge
[56:33] see
[56:34] all painted up
[56:37] it is a deceit of big buildings and big
[56:41] denominations and paints of knowledge
[56:43] and Theology and smart and intellectual
[56:45] and educated
[56:47] to deceive
[56:50] the whole world and become a God that's
[56:53] what he's done
[56:54] all heading up into the person of the
[56:57] Antichrist
[56:59] which is already crowned the biker of
[57:03] God by his worldly loving scientific
[57:07] bride all dressed up in pop of
[57:11] intellectual religious education
[57:15] she is made religious like him and by
[57:17] his own interpretation of the word of
[57:20] God as it did Eve
[57:23] and as his son teen did
[57:27] now you said Satan's son show me one
[57:30] place in the Bible as a team was ever
[57:32] called Adam's son
[57:35] the Bible said he was the son of that
[57:37] evil one
[57:39] serpency
[57:42] all their cover's been took off now
[57:44] brother
[57:46] the pyramid has been opened as the
[57:48] Revelation showed
[57:51] notice
[57:53] what he will do
[57:56] is thought he thought
[57:59] God dwelled in worldly Beauty
[58:03] he did that in heaven
[58:05] sin never began in the Garden of Eden it
[58:08] began in heaven
[58:09] when Lucifer
[58:11] the son of the morning
[58:13] exalted himself in Beauty and one of the
[58:17] more beautiful kingdom than that of
[58:20] Michael
[58:21] and he thought that God dwelled in
[58:23] Beauty and noticed King
[58:25] he didn't want no blood sacrifice he
[58:28] come down and offered the fruit or or
[58:30] the fields of beauty upon his altar very
[58:34] religious done everything that just
[58:36] exactly like Ableton
[58:39] offered a sacrifice fell down before God
[58:42] In Worship
[58:43] obedient and everweight but without the
[58:47] revelation
[58:49] of the word
[58:51] and the Word was from the beginning
[58:53] God's plan
[58:54] but God revealed by Revelation the very
[58:58] thing that he Vindicated and punctuated
[59:01] or that was right
[59:02] not religion
[59:04] not an altar not belonging to church not
[59:07] making a sacrifice not being sincere but
[59:10] by the revelation of the word of God
[59:15] God revealing to him
[59:17] what that his mother did not take an
[59:21] apple that a snake Giver
[59:24] but she had a sexual affair with the
[59:27] person of Satan in the form of the Beast
[59:31] not a reptile but the most smartest
[59:34] subtlest of all the field the image of
[59:37] man the only thing that the seed would
[59:39] mix in now science is trying to find him
[59:42] and they never will find him because
[59:43] ever born in his bodies change
[59:46] but the Bible declares it to be so
[59:49] notice what this fellow will do now
[59:52] this fella he will set in the temple of
[59:56] God that is the church
[59:59] revealing himself to be God
[1:00:02] now if you want to read that that's
[1:00:03] second Thessalonians uh two three and
[1:00:06] four in Revelations 13.
[1:00:09] 4 11 and 12 were spoke both prophets
[1:00:13] both John and Paul of what he would be
[1:00:16] in the last date
[1:00:17] now you read it because I've got wrote
[1:00:21] down here but to save time now
[1:00:24] the day we are living is called in the
[1:00:27] Bible the day of man
[1:00:30] 's day this is not God's day
[1:00:36] God is not the God of this Earth
[1:00:38] the Bible says he isn't
[1:00:40] he's the god of Heaven
[1:00:43] but this is not God's day
[1:00:46] this is choosing day
[1:00:49] either live for today and die choose God
[1:00:52] and live
[1:00:53] and God is the word
[1:00:55] and the word is the word manifested for
[1:00:58] the hour
[1:00:59] and today
[1:01:00] notice the day of man if you don't put
[1:01:03] that down as go to read but first
[1:01:04] Corinthians 5 1 5.
[1:01:07] First Corinthians 4 1 5 Pardon Me First
[1:01:11] Corinthians 4 1 if I was Paul speaking
[1:01:14] of being judged by man and man's day
[1:01:17] the days what do you call it the man's
[1:01:19] day for you say it's the day that the
[1:01:22] works by the knowledge of man is
[1:01:25] glorified
[1:01:26] look what all the brag of the Communists
[1:01:30] somebody trying to get somebody to the
[1:01:31] Moon
[1:01:33] God's trying to get somebody to heaven
[1:01:35] but look how they're spending millions
[1:01:38] and billions and trillions of dollars
[1:01:40] and a wasted effort
[1:01:44] when they get there the eagle to find
[1:01:45] nothing
[1:01:48] what's the matter with them
[1:01:51] I don't care about the move I want to
[1:01:53] pass the moon so fast won't even see it
[1:02:00] just keep going higher I want to pass
[1:02:02] the milky white way go on let's keep
[1:02:04] going
[1:02:06] yes
[1:02:08] and the world today
[1:02:11] is dedicating themselves to the
[1:02:13] knowledge which came by Satan and man's
[1:02:17] day is glorified not by the word of God
[1:02:21] but by the knowledge that he has
[1:02:24] now think that that's soaking and when
[1:02:27] you play this tape back on this point
[1:02:29] you're stopped for a while and think
[1:02:33] his works are exalted above God's word
[1:02:39] and manifested works
[1:02:42] the wisdom of Satan which he give to Eve
[1:02:46] at the beginning now listen don't miss
[1:02:49] this
[1:02:50] the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the
[1:02:54] throne of worship in man
[1:02:58] above the Vindicated word of God for the
[1:03:02] hour our churches proves that
[1:03:06] bother
[1:03:08] they're seminaries
[1:03:10] schools of learning that's learned more
[1:03:13] than God's word
[1:03:15] knows about they think
[1:03:18] and there Dr so and so and teacher so
[1:03:21] and so and Professor so-and-so has
[1:03:26] exalted their own knowledge
[1:03:28] so-called from Satan
[1:03:31] truth
[1:03:33] above
[1:03:36] the Vindicated promise of God made clear
[1:03:40] right before him
[1:03:42] and man fall apart
[1:03:45] his scientific achievements
[1:03:49] trying to prove God's word wrong
[1:03:54] just think of that
[1:03:56] he he is that is the man's theology
[1:04:00] explains God's word to the people
[1:04:04] and makes it of no effect again like he
[1:04:07] had it in the denominational age when
[1:04:09] Jesus appeared on the Earth
[1:04:13] Jesus said you hypocrites
[1:04:16] you by your tradition that's their
[1:04:19] interpretation
[1:04:21] has took the word of God and made it of
[1:04:23] no effect to the people
[1:04:26] and that's the same thing they've done
[1:04:29] today
[1:04:31] it doesn't have the effect
[1:04:34] notice
[1:04:36] they the people exalt him above all
[1:04:41] that's called God
[1:04:43] don't second Thessalonians say they
[1:04:45] would do it
[1:04:46] and the authority
[1:04:49] of a denominational Church
[1:04:54] the people believing that denomination
[1:04:56] more than to believe God in God is the
[1:05:00] word
[1:05:01] they'll freed their denominational Creed
[1:05:03] above the word which exalts him above
[1:05:06] all is called God and there's only one
[1:05:09] God and that's the word
[1:05:12] all that's called God so he asked God
[1:05:16] sets in the Church of the god
[1:05:19] proving that he is God because he's got
[1:05:22] the people worshiping him
[1:05:26] God is the word
[1:05:28] and he exhausts himself above all it's
[1:05:30] called God and there's only one God and
[1:05:32] that God is the word
[1:05:33] okay and all it's called God is the God
[1:05:36] of this age
[1:05:38] has exalted himself above the true
[1:05:41] Vindicated word of God at Saint John 1.
[1:05:44] see above all it's called God so that he
[1:05:48] as God sits in the temple of God with
[1:05:51] authority look
[1:05:53] and he is praised for it
[1:05:56] oh that's the people God see that
[1:06:00] deception
[1:06:03] he is praised for it and solemnly
[1:06:06] believed by the people of this evil age
[1:06:11] ah do you see the God and his servants
[1:06:16] of this evil age
[1:06:19] uh let's watch it be manifested
[1:06:23] he says he is making a better world for
[1:06:27] them to live in by his knowledge
[1:06:30] apart from the never failing word of God
[1:06:35] but by his coming together in
[1:06:38] denominations and Creeds and
[1:06:40] intellectual and scientific and so forth
[1:06:42] he is making a better world for a man to
[1:06:45] live in and ignoring the promise of God
[1:06:48] that the only time the world will be fit
[1:06:50] to live in is in the millennium
[1:06:57] you know my feeling he's made a better
[1:06:59] world of sin in instead of living
[1:07:02] notice did he do it he legalized sin
[1:07:09] he legalized Whiskey Drinking
[1:07:12] cigarette smoking
[1:07:14] and in the church is legalized that a
[1:07:16] woman could be a member of the church
[1:07:18] with short hair
[1:07:21] now but he stopped just a minute
[1:07:24] she can wear shorts wear pants and still
[1:07:28] belong to his religious group which is
[1:07:30] absolutely contrary to the word of God
[1:07:34] he says it's all right
[1:07:36] see his knowledge what's that got to do
[1:07:38] with the woman
[1:07:39] just the same as taking a forbidden
[1:07:41] fruit or not the forbidden fruit that's
[1:07:43] what it is God said not to do it
[1:07:46] but he does it
[1:07:49] and she believes him
[1:07:51] and she loves him for it
[1:07:54] she hates God
[1:07:56] her own actions proves she does
[1:07:59] she says she loves him but she loves
[1:08:01] Satan
[1:08:03] she worships a god of fashion
[1:08:06] the god of the world
[1:08:08] the Hollywood goddesses
[1:08:11] she loves him
[1:08:13] but she hates the true word of God
[1:08:16] which is the only true God there is
[1:08:20] legalizes it
[1:08:21] in the churches there's no harm our
[1:08:23] women can do this that or the other
[1:08:26] but in the
[1:08:28] presence of the Living God she's not
[1:08:30] even permitted to come unless she's
[1:08:31] repent
[1:08:35] cease he is the god of worldly Beauty
[1:08:41] yes she wants to look beautiful
[1:08:45] and he is a god of beauty from the
[1:08:47] beginning he can and has achieved by his
[1:08:51] knowledge and Science and materials to
[1:08:53] make Beauty for his this model age this
[1:08:56] model a modern age rather of evil
[1:08:59] made Beauty notice it's noteworthy
[1:09:03] to notice at the beginning
[1:09:06] saith and his children never went the
[1:09:09] scientific way
[1:09:10] now we're going to talk about science
[1:09:12] for a few minutes
[1:09:15] if I say this not excusing my ignorance
[1:09:17] but a bunch of ignoramuses
[1:09:20] anything will deny the word of God
[1:09:25] it's noteworthy watch it
[1:09:28] SAS children never went the scientific
[1:09:31] Realm
[1:09:32] they were humble herdsmen farmers and so
[1:09:36] forth but Cain's children did
[1:09:40] why inspired by their daddy
[1:09:44] the devil change
[1:09:47] inspired by his daddy
[1:09:49] the devil and these inspired by that
[1:09:53] seed coming down what's the seed of God
[1:09:56] coming down do you ever age
[1:09:59] and what's worse heading up today
[1:10:01] Christians genuine Christians are not
[1:10:04] all about scientific research and stuff
[1:10:07] you know just a minute we'll get into
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:10] but Keynes did ask the nature of the
[1:10:13] Father the devil
[1:10:14] full of worldly knowledge Beauty and
[1:10:17] science
[1:10:19] and so forth
[1:10:20] King's Children was scientific
[1:10:23] they were educated
[1:10:25] they were the players of music
[1:10:28] instruments a modern Elvis Presley
[1:10:31] some of this stuff like at the school
[1:10:33] board let's happen up here in the lane
[1:10:35] every Saturday night
[1:10:37] Builders of City
[1:10:39] beautifying women
[1:10:42] for a personal lust
[1:10:44] as a devil giving women painting bobbing
[1:10:48] her hair put them in the shorts and
[1:10:49] things like that they as far as his own
[1:10:51] dirty lust
[1:10:56] that's pretty flat but I don't know any
[1:10:59] other way to say it
[1:11:01] now we know that Satan's gospel is a
[1:11:05] gospel of Science and progress
[1:11:09] he preached it in Eden
[1:11:12] not God
[1:11:14] Satan did
[1:11:15] the science of progress
[1:11:18] science and progress is Satan's gospel
[1:11:20] look where he's led us to today with it
[1:11:23] see
[1:11:25] notice he preached it in Eden to who to
[1:11:28] Adam's bride
[1:11:30] and she fell for it he deceived her into
[1:11:34] questioning one of God's words
[1:11:38] let's see what he might have said
[1:11:40] he must have said it is not scientific
[1:11:43] to die in this holy church
[1:11:49] or you will be schooled and educated not
[1:11:53] to believe in such unreasonable things
[1:11:55] as death I don't care if God's word did
[1:11:58] say it it's unreasonable oh look at him
[1:12:00] today
[1:12:01] God is a good god you're in his holy
[1:12:04] church why you cannot die but God said
[1:12:07] you would
[1:12:08] that settles it see him today or just
[1:12:11] belong to church think what you do or
[1:12:13] this that the other just come to church
[1:12:15] and be a good member cutting your hair
[1:12:17] that's nonsense and wearing shorts and
[1:12:19] putting on painting going to dances and
[1:12:21] a little fear once in a while won't hurt
[1:12:23] you as long as you don't indulge in it
[1:12:24] frankly I wish your children would take
[1:12:26] it so that they could learn where they
[1:12:28] liked it or not
[1:12:30] there he is
[1:12:32] the God of this age this evil age God is
[1:12:37] a good god I've heard that's the must
[1:12:39] you'll get sick
[1:12:40] amen God is also a God of Justice he
[1:12:44] ain't an old Dodie grandpa that can be
[1:12:47] pushed around his grandkids don't have
[1:12:49] any sin
[1:12:50] he's a God of Justice and holiness
[1:12:55] improved in the guard of Eden by his
[1:12:57] first children
[1:12:58] you cross that line of one of these
[1:13:00] words you're dead
[1:13:02] same thing applies today
[1:13:07] and notice
[1:13:08] he preached that kind of a scientific
[1:13:11] social
[1:13:13] educated
[1:13:16] Progressive gospel
[1:13:19] to Eve and Adam's bride believed it
[1:13:24] and he has succeeded in filling the
[1:13:28] so-called bride of Christ the Church of
[1:13:31] the second Adam with the same arguments
[1:13:35] that's right
[1:13:37] oh it's not it's not for God God is too
[1:13:40] good to do it why as long as you go to
[1:13:42] church if thou believest the devil
[1:13:44] believes
[1:13:46] not make believe but he actually
[1:13:48] believes
[1:13:49] he's not saved
[1:13:51] if thou believest
[1:13:57] he tells the second
[1:14:00] bride or the second Adam's bride
[1:14:04] the same as he told the first such as
[1:14:07] now Divine Healing
[1:14:10] there is no such thing
[1:14:13] we can prove that there's never been a
[1:14:15] case proved
[1:14:18] and this baptism in Jesus name now don't
[1:14:22] you realize that I'm the authority of
[1:14:23] the church he said we settled at it and
[1:14:26] I see a room and have three unclean
[1:14:28] spirits went out of the Dragon the false
[1:14:30] prophets and so forth we believe there
[1:14:32] is a trinity of gods hope for goodness
[1:14:35] sakes that's as Heathen as can be
[1:14:37] you never come before God but such a
[1:14:39] thing as that
[1:14:41] oh don't make any difference if you're
[1:14:43] baptized in the titles of father son
[1:14:45] Holy Ghost what differs does it make it
[1:14:48] made so much difference
[1:14:50] unto Paul commanded a bunch of Baptists
[1:14:54] that there had to be re-baptized in the
[1:14:55] name of Jesus Christ before the Holy
[1:14:57] Ghost never come on
[1:14:58] and also calls that Apostle to scream
[1:15:01] out it said if an angel comes from
[1:15:03] heaven and preaches anything else let
[1:15:05] him be cursed
[1:15:07] sure it makes a difference
[1:15:10] oh my
[1:15:12] there's no such a thing as the baptism
[1:15:14] of the Holy Ghost in these days that was
[1:15:16] only for the apostles
[1:15:19] it's past and such a thing as prophets
[1:15:21] not even knowing of Miracles they're
[1:15:24] unscientific
[1:15:25] Malachi 4 that was for another age John
[1:15:29] 14 12 oh Jesus didn't really mean that
[1:15:33] Luke 17 30 all that was just a myth
[1:15:37] see
[1:15:39] it's misinterpreted it wasn't in the
[1:15:42] original
[1:15:47] when God Almighty comes down in our
[1:15:50] midst and proves it
[1:15:52] when he says that Jesus Christ is the
[1:15:54] same yesterday and forever he proves
[1:15:56] that soul
[1:15:57] okay who says not about it God
[1:15:58] interprets his own word he said he would
[1:16:01] do this thing in the last days there
[1:16:03] will be a light in the evening time as
[1:16:05] there is
[1:16:06] what part of America
[1:16:10] the same Sun that rises in the east of
[1:16:13] the same Sun it sets in the west the
[1:16:15] prophet said there would be a day it
[1:16:16] could be called date or night it's a
[1:16:18] dismal the clouds as over the face of
[1:16:21] the Sun but said about evening time it
[1:16:23] shall come light again
[1:16:25] the same Sun
[1:16:28] these Alpha and Omega
[1:16:31] same Sun that Rose in the East was
[1:16:33] predicted to rise in the west again in
[1:16:36] the last days just before the day was
[1:16:38] over
[1:16:39] I don't know how they interpreted God
[1:16:41] interprets his own word he proves it
[1:16:44] this is the evening time
[1:16:47] sad
[1:16:48] but she sure fell for it again
[1:16:52] Christ's Pride fell for it and took the
[1:16:54] intellectual knowledge of some Seminary
[1:16:57] preacher instead of believing the pure
[1:16:59] Vindicated word of God now ministers I
[1:17:01] enter in the land word of God you might
[1:17:03] disagree with this I'm not hurting you
[1:17:04] I'm just trying I'm talking to my own
[1:17:06] group
[1:17:08] I'm just trying to if you want to set in
[1:17:10] I'll sure be glad for you to hear it and
[1:17:12] then you listen at it
[1:17:15] but I'm just telling them what they have
[1:17:16] thought they have seen it to him but God
[1:17:19] proven that it's right
[1:17:21] this is the hour
[1:17:23] don't need anybody to interpret it your
[1:17:25] worldly knowledge don't have anything
[1:17:26] you might have a b-a-d-d-a-d or whatever
[1:17:29] it might be that don't mean one thing
[1:17:31] amen God interprets his word himself he
[1:17:34] promised it and here it is
[1:17:37] but by the knowledge
[1:17:40] of Seminary
[1:17:42] denominational preaching has caused the
[1:17:46] whole world to wander add to the Beast
[1:17:49] whose deadly womb was sealed from Pagan
[1:17:51] to paffle see where she's heading up
[1:17:55] she believes it she believes the
[1:17:57] knowledge that he tells her
[1:17:58] it is I watch
[1:18:02] it is that both engaged Brides believe
[1:18:07] Satan's knowledge against God's word
[1:18:12] the Bride of Adam belief Satan's
[1:18:15] knowledge against God's word and the
[1:18:18] bride of Christ has believed Satan's
[1:18:20] knowledge and his intellectual evil age
[1:18:22] against God's word
[1:18:25] and notice Eve in the natural that
[1:18:28] believed it and plunged the whole human
[1:18:32] race to death
[1:18:35] the natural Pride
[1:18:37] Adam the natural man of the earth his
[1:18:41] pride before he got to her to be wife
[1:18:46] plunge the whole human race into death
[1:18:50] whether it's scientific or not we die
[1:18:52] just the same cause God said we would
[1:18:54] well you're in holy Eden or holy church
[1:18:56] or holy denomination whatever it might
[1:18:59] be you'll die the day you disbelieve one
[1:19:01] word of God's word to be the truth
[1:19:05] that's the day you separate yourself
[1:19:08] not just a whole
[1:19:11] she'll add one word or take one away
[1:19:13] that's the day you die
[1:19:16] notice
[1:19:18] Adam's bride
[1:19:20] calls natural death to her race the
[1:19:24] human race and the second Adam's bride
[1:19:27] Christ engaged bride has plunged the
[1:19:31] whole
[1:19:32] Church to a denominational death
[1:19:36] to take the mark of the beast
[1:19:40] by the scientific intellectual big
[1:19:44] denominations we're Baptist we're
[1:19:46] Presbyterian we're Pentecostals and so
[1:19:49] forth we got this and we own more
[1:19:50] property we we're noted by the
[1:19:52] government we're all around the world
[1:19:53] and all such things in the best of the
[1:19:55] mayor of the city and so forth comes to
[1:19:57] us even the president comes to have mass
[1:19:59] said with us and we comes to this or
[1:20:01] that the other the whole world
[1:20:04] has been plunged to a spiritual
[1:20:07] denominational death the whole church
[1:20:11] she's dead
[1:20:13] you say you're covering a lot of
[1:20:15] territory Jesus said as it was in the
[1:20:17] days of Noah horn eight Souls were saved
[1:20:21] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[1:20:23] of man
[1:20:24] in the days of life where three was
[1:20:27] brought out of Solomon
[1:20:29] at that day that is already group
[1:20:32] already out remember
[1:20:34] but as it was then when the son of man
[1:20:36] will be manifested look what look where
[1:20:38] we're living
[1:20:40] now she has called the whole world to
[1:20:43] accept the scientific leadership of the
[1:20:46] educational program that Satan has given
[1:20:49] to her under the name of a church
[1:20:53] the leadership of an educational
[1:20:55] scientific program
[1:20:59] I'm picturing to you the God of this
[1:21:01] world
[1:21:03] when she as Eve had the very feeling of
[1:21:08] God's word in her hand
[1:21:10] she could have took God's word but what
[1:21:13] did she do that instead of caring for
[1:21:15] the baptism the Holy Ghost let science
[1:21:17] prove to her that the Holy Ghost is only
[1:21:19] for the disciples
[1:21:22] instead of keeping Divine Healing going
[1:21:24] what you ought to be now raised in the
[1:21:25] dead and doing great Miracles she's let
[1:21:27] Satan under his leadership of religious
[1:21:30] man take the word of God and try to say
[1:21:33] it that it was for another age
[1:21:36] and she's believed it
[1:21:38] when the Bible said the things that I do
[1:21:42] shall you do also Jesus said that
[1:21:45] going into all the words preach the
[1:21:47] gospel to every creature we're still
[1:21:48] creatures
[1:21:50] these signs shall follow every one of
[1:21:53] them that believe
[1:21:54] she denies every bit of it
[1:21:58] she denies all the supernatural
[1:22:00] as she swapped it for his intellectual
[1:22:04] conception of the Bible
[1:22:06] where priests and holy fathers so-called
[1:22:10] or Bishops archbishops
[1:22:13] or uh District transmitters gentle
[1:22:16] overseers and so forth has put their own
[1:22:19] interpretation to it and God has let
[1:22:22] them set their dead as 12 o'clock
[1:22:28] the only things left the last days is a
[1:22:30] bunch of little Pentecostal with a bunch
[1:22:32] of music hooped up as hard as you can
[1:22:33] rub them down for speaking in tongues
[1:22:35] and shouting
[1:22:36] and having a form of godliness but
[1:22:38] denying the word thereof
[1:22:42] tell them to be baptized in the name of
[1:22:44] Jesus Christ laugh your face
[1:22:48] that that God goes right I don't make
[1:22:49] this show just the same proven his word
[1:22:51] to be so
[1:22:53] notice the tree that Satan caused Eve to
[1:22:57] partake of was a tree of Good and Evil
[1:23:02] it was a mixed treat
[1:23:05] now look at today we're living in when
[1:23:07] he's calling out a bride he's got a
[1:23:10] church that claims to be doing good when
[1:23:12] it's Evil by denying the word
[1:23:14] a mystery I won't say they they have
[1:23:17] great societies they they they help the
[1:23:20] uh this and the Red Cross and Doris is
[1:23:23] it in all the schools they look here oh
[1:23:26] but just deny one word that's all you
[1:23:28] have to do to die
[1:23:29] no matter how intellectual how good it
[1:23:31] is
[1:23:32] Jesus said a little 11 11 is the whole
[1:23:34] lump
[1:23:36] one spot 11 ruins the lump one word of
[1:23:40] God displaced spoils the whole picture
[1:23:42] what about my arm being where my foot
[1:23:44] should be
[1:23:46] what if my ear was down here where my
[1:23:48] hands should be
[1:23:49] a little eleven eleven's a whole lot say
[1:23:52] how do you know it's right God proves it
[1:23:54] right he vindicates it he said that
[1:23:56] you're in a word then he proves it
[1:23:57] that's how we know we're trying not
[1:24:00] just an eye one words all it takes to
[1:24:03] die it brought the same results in this
[1:24:05] evil age spiritual death as it did
[1:24:07] physical death to the whole human race
[1:24:14] you don't hear that side of the message
[1:24:16] a whole lot do you
[1:24:19] you you understand but you realize what
[1:24:22] you've been called out of
[1:24:24] what you've been called to what
[1:24:27] privilege that it's been given to you to
[1:24:31] see the promised word of God for this
[1:24:34] hour coming to pass he promised that he
[1:24:38] would come he promised the son of man
[1:24:40] Ministry would be here he promised Luke
[1:24:43] 17 30 he promised Revelations 10 7. he
[1:24:47] promised these things and and by God's
[1:24:51] grace you've seen it you know and so
[1:24:55] you you get a good picture of what
[1:24:59] Satan's trying to do
[1:25:02] he's trying to get on that throne and be
[1:25:04] worshiped by people choosing
[1:25:08] His science and his education his
[1:25:11] economy his civilization the you know
[1:25:15] everything that he he's offering and and
[1:25:20] we we just know that it's just not
[1:25:24] what's going to get us there
[1:25:26] what's going to get us there is the word
[1:25:28] of God and and that's what that's what
[1:25:32] we're hanging to and and
[1:25:35] it's it's hard to believe that you are
[1:25:37] actually seeing Satan Ascend to his
[1:25:41] throne
[1:25:43] and take complete control
[1:25:45] of this world
[1:25:48] and it's just going to be that little
[1:25:50] elect
[1:25:52] lady just that few as it was in the days
[1:25:55] of Noah that are going to stay free from
[1:25:58] it so you know if you're not little
[1:26:01] thought
[1:26:02] is the Father's good pleasure
[1:26:04] to give you the help to give you the
[1:26:07] kingdom and his kingdom will prevail and
[1:26:11] and so I I just feel in my heart it's
[1:26:14] it's needful
[1:26:16] sometimes to to
[1:26:19] you know and not be discouraged and not
[1:26:22] and you know I know we shake our head in
[1:26:26] wonderment
[1:26:27] uh you just you just can't believe
[1:26:29] people can come up with what they're
[1:26:32] coming up with but it just shows that
[1:26:36] it's going to go into total chaos
[1:26:38] and it's exactly been prophesied and
[1:26:42] it's hard to believe that this was in
[1:26:45] 1965.
[1:26:47] and you cannot believe how tame
[1:26:52] 1965 would look
[1:26:55] according to the way that things are in
[1:26:59] the world today but he told us didn't he
[1:27:02] so let's take heed and and there's a lot
[1:27:07] of marvelous great things for us to
[1:27:10] rejoice in so you know if if uh
[1:27:15] you know if you have a loved one out of
[1:27:17] the Kingdom
[1:27:20] pray more than you ever have before for
[1:27:23] him and just ask God and don't be afraid
[1:27:27] to testify to the things
[1:27:29] you've seen but it is it's a Satan sold
[1:27:33] them education science and knowledge
[1:27:37] instead of the word of God he gave him a
[1:27:40] substitute
[1:27:41] and I I just with all my heart uh I I
[1:27:46] just hear brother Brandon crying out
[1:27:48] more than I ever have back to the word
[1:27:51] back to the word back to the word we're
[1:27:55] not against blessings but nothing is a
[1:27:58] substitute
[1:28:00] for God's word
[1:28:02] we're not against praising we're not
[1:28:04] against shouting we're not against
[1:28:05] worshiping we're not against singing he
[1:28:09] said but
[1:28:11] if you do that and deny the power of the
[1:28:16] word and that's what our great warning
[1:28:19] is to stay with God's word God bless you
[1:28:22] let's stand together this evening we
[1:28:24] will keep you much longer and and I I
[1:28:28] just hope that
[1:28:30] that you enjoyed the
[1:28:33] the word of God and and hearing it
[1:28:36] straight to see how important that was
[1:28:41] I'm going to give you the date of that
[1:28:43] sermon
[1:28:46] um
[1:28:48] so uh
[1:28:50] it was um
[1:28:57] see if I can find the date of it here
[1:29:03] I don't know if I
[1:29:06] all right
[1:29:08] August 1st 1965.
[1:29:11] so uh yeah just think of that very close
[1:29:16] to the end of his ministry he's he's
[1:29:18] letting the world know
[1:29:21] this is where it's going church
[1:29:25] we're going to go worship Satan
[1:29:28] by the millions and by the billions
[1:29:32] I don't even know how many people are in
[1:29:34] the world back then but I think there's
[1:29:36] eight billion now
[1:29:38] and he says billions of them worshiping
[1:29:41] Satan
