heard our prayers and today our children Kurt and Twilight decided to be baptized amen praise the Lord amen amen amen I like it when it's the Lord that works amen when men die it you know it will not go far but when God touches your heart know that when you do it you will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he promised that's that's the portion of the believer that if you believe and re and do it according to his word you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we're certainly thankful for that amen let's open our Bibles this morning and uh so we're going to have baptism after service this morning so uh we'll try to be not too long man let's open our Bibles uh Ephesians chapter 2 uh let's start with there it said that and ye had we quickened who were dead in trespass and sin wherein in the time pass ye walk according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedient among whom also we all had our conversation in time pass in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of rra even as others but God who's rich in Mercy aren't you glad is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin in sins had quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved it says that and had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding reaches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by Grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of your work not of works let it let lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works it says which God had before for ordained that we should walk in them let's also turn in Hebrews 11 And1 a very familiar scripture reading it says now Faith is the sub substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things that do appear Let's uh jump to verse eight it says that by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise it says as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker was God let's also turn in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 it would say that we for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for jesus' sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness and shine in our hearts to give us to G to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ it says but we have this treasure in Earth and vessel that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubl on every side yet not distress we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed it says all always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so that so then death worketh in us but life in you it says we have the Same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believe and therefore I have spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised us raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things for all things are for your sakes that the abundance Grace might through the Thanksgiving of many re uh rebound that to the glory of God for which cause we faint not but though our outward men perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day isn't that true we get old we get wrinkled we get all of this but the Inner Man grew this by day it says for a light Affliction which is which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory I want you to remember that while it says while we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not which are not sinen are Eternal our gracious father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you may have your seats I trust you happy to be gathered in the house of God this morning I would like to speak on faith to move into the Unseen Faith to mooving to the Unseen as we read the scriptures and and and there's many more we probably would read some I want to say this God uh wants his his church uh to to move and to return to the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints we know that we know even the word of the hour the message which we have received we know that it's it's a message that was sent to return us to the original Faith of Our Father and when and when you speak about that Faith you go back you will find out that that faith has some characteristics attached to it you'll find out that Faith even as edges went by and and we see mankind today I it's amazing I can even say what people call Faith today is not even Faith it's some form of intellectual understanding that men has come up with and and they attributed it as Faith but we find out will say that faith can only come from the word of God said if you look at a tree and you you claim that if you touch a tree or a pole that by touching it something will happen it says that's not Faith why because that's just your own imagination that it will happen there's no God in it what you need the faith that really comes is what comes based on the promises that God has given that's what really faith is and I want to say as individual you can go back human if you can go back right into the Garden of Eden and and and one of the things you'll realize is God created meant to operate by faith you can go back right from Adam when he uh uh uh perhaps move a tree when he would speak and when he would name animal it was not an a an intellectual Affair it was a faith Affair it was created in the image of God God operate by faith and therefore man operated by faith God made man to live by faith to achieve by faith before the foundation even of the world when God created man we can see man in that very State he was operating by faith he didn't he didn't wonder whether his word was going to come to pass he didn't wonder what he said if it really was going to happen he knew he had a connection with his maker he was made in the image of his maker and he knew what he spoke would come to pass he didn't doubt it there was no thing as doubt and he didn't question what he was saying he knew that he was connected to the purpose of God he knew within his God that what he wanted was what God wanted he wanted he knew one thing that he was placed there to be the god of the earth to be in charge of what was around him and he knew that he was endued with power from above for him to operate and work the things that were around him he knew that it was his responsibility to keep the Earth in check to subdue and and to to bring things in the uh uh uh in the in the light and in the position that God wanted them to be and we find out that is sin that came and makx up the whole thing sin came and and and and and and and took man away from what was God's intended purpose by in the beginning but God he gave us faith in order for us to get access into the Unseen realm of God and I want to say this God gave us the the the the the faith in order to introduce us into the Unseen Realm Of Heaven that men lost in the beginning because we understand that when man lost when man fail that he was separated away from God and he began to operate by the five senses he began to think and he began to work through the five senses and coming up with his own reasoning but we understand that God placed within the man there was still a faith that God wanted to connect uh uh with a man through to use it but say we have been given Faith it's the ability that God has given us in order to uh connect with this world with this this invisible world that's around us we may not be able to see it or touch it or or be able to understand it with our own mind just exactly or be able to explain it with our own words but we know one thing that we are given the five senses it was given for us to contact the world around us but it was they were given to us the fifth sense the prophet will say in order for us to contact God so it was given to us in order to take us right back into the same condition that we were in the beginning and the five senses were given to us to touch the world that was around us we find out that it was given because this ability that God placed in man we needed a way for us to get access into it we needed a way for us to go back and the only way way we could go back it became by the faith that God introduced that the faith that God deposited into the heart of man I want to say this I was reading this uh but when I inan the message unseen it would speak and and I begin to think uh uh uh about the he speaks about the story in second king chapter 6 and this is the story of Elijah and G gah he says this and and we we know the story very well uh this is when uh the king of Syria is going to war with the king of Israel and and they they they try to set up traps so many times and and every time they will set up a trap and and the the the Elijah will will call the king of uh Israel and they will tell him and says don't don't go this direction and and stay away from this place and stay away from that place and and they would do that and the king of Syria came empty came up empty every time and he got frustrated and then this but but but when I'm he's talking about that story it says therefore it says therefore the heart of the king of Syria was soared and troubled for the thing and he and he called his servant and said unto them will ye not show me which one of us is for the king of Israel so he was frustrated because every plan that he would make he would spoil it and everything he would try to trap the king of Israel against the war he would come up and and find out that the king of Israel was able to made it and and he will say that oh he says and one of his servants said it says None my Lord it says oh King but Elijah the prophet that is in Israel he says that is in Israel he tell the king of Israel the words that thou speaketh in the bed chamber and he said go and spy where where he is and that I may send and fetch him and then it says and he was told to him saying behold he is in dayon and and therefore he send uh th horses and Chariot and a great host and they came by night and they compassed the city about and and when the servant of the man of God uh was risen and early and he passed the city he passed he passed City both the horses and the and the Chariot and his servant said unto him he says alas my master how shall we do and he answered this is Elijah now answering it and he answered he says fear not for there there be with us more than they that be with them and Elias pray and say Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and Chariots of Fire about Elijah Oh I thought oh if we can just come to an understanding this morning here is this young man and and and and and all he can see was that there were Compass about and all he could see that there were uh that the king of Syria came with Chariot and horses and they were everywhere around the city and blocking the whole city so that they can besiege them and find out where they could come and and and and find the prophet of God but here he is and the prophet now is talking and and speaking to this young man and and and is's trying to make him understand that the reality is just not what your five senses is telling you that really the the whole reality is not just what you can take and what you can touch and smell and see with your eyes and how you can add up numbers within your mind and come up with a conclusion what the prophet was trying to get this young man to do is to bring him in an understanding that there's an uncen just around the corner you may not be able to see it with your eyes but there's an unseen realm there's a host around us that's there to protect you there's a host of God I like this because the prophet didn't pray that God will change the circumstance no the prophet prayed so that the young man could not only see what he was seeing but also take into consideration that there was a Heavenly Host present the prophet didn't pray for God to come and and block this so do that no the prophet prayed so that our eyes could see the reality of what's Happening oh this morning when we run into trouble if we can only understand that they that are with us are more than those that are against us often time when we run against difficulties we cramble and and we think oh this is the end of me the young man was there looking at it and said oh I don't know how we're going to get out of the circumstance I don't know what's going to happen through us this looks like the end of us but oh my the prophet pray so that his eyes can open so he can see that the reality was not coming from his eyes the reality comes from The Unseen real what was happening in heaven in fact the prophet will say one place that when he prayed the the the reason when the prophet prayed the reason he was praying the prophet he himself he ended understanding that the angel of God in Camp around those that fear him so what he was praying is for the scripture to open up to him he wasn't praying so that God will somehow send the angels and send the Chariot and send all no those chariots were already dead to begin with the the the Chariots of Fire existed before the Chariots of Fire were already around the mountain what he needed was a revelation for him to see those and that's what happened within our life what we need is to understand that the sin that's bounding you is not the end of you what you need to know is salvation is already there but Matthew preached last Sunday they said what is greater is it sin or is it the Savior what is greater is it healing or is it sickness before sickness can come upon you there was already a God Who provided healing for it what we need is a God to bring us to open up our eyes for us to see the Unseen realm to see what God is working that's why the prophet will pray it says oh that what the will What's Done in heaven may be done on Earth so because the understanding is not us trying to necessarily uh uh change what uh uh what's happening and everything what God is wanting us to do is to come to a place where we put Heaven into the equation of what we're trying to do when when when things gets hard when the doctors say there's no option for you when when when you try everything you don't know how to get out of it don't stop there God wants you to know there's unseen resources untapped resources that exist for you and what you see with your eyes it's the devil trying to lie to you is coming from the five senses but God has given you an in Man by which you can tap into an unseen resources and come up with a different result so he he came and he prayed for for God to open up this young man's eyes he said oh God if you can open this young man's eyes that he may see and the prophet will speak about that in the message the uh looking into the Unseen paragraph 34 he says he says like Elijah told Gesa his servant a a daughter and he says why they looked they looked at around and there was a Syrian Army it says there was everything to smash them down because this man of God was able to tell the king of Israel what the king of Syria was thinking about was thinking in his bed chamber if you can put it up there it says bam says let me say this tonight my audience that God still lives and he's just the same tonight as he was then he can still know your thoughts and what you are thinking about right now and then he says then you should watch the fruits of the spirit to see that it's that it's the it's that if that God of history but it that is if it's that God of History it raised again certainly in paragraph 55 uh 35 he says and when the Great crisis come which always does then gaha being just a lukew church member when he had not seen what Elijah had seen because Elijah was used to walking by faith and he he was looking into the Unseen all the time he knew that God has said in Psalm in the Psalms that the angel of God are encamped about those that fear Him it says that was that was enough for Elijah but gazah had just gotten half believed believer believed it it says he uh he weigh just the church member so Elijah said to the Lord it said Lord God give a sign here just open this this man's eyes and let him see what's around him and when God opened his eyes he saw horses of fire drawn by Chariots of Fire and they were all around the old Prophet they were there all the time but he just didn't see them oh God you've left me no is there all the time oh God I don't know what to do he's there if you're in the fire he's there with you in the fire if you're in difficulties he's there with you in the difficulties he wants you to know he's never left you he's never forsake you that's his Word of Promise toward you oh my brother my sister what we receive in this end time is God sending the prophet to remind you that you were predestinated before the foundation of the world it's not a new message it's the oldest message there ever was it's the same thing that was brought to job when the god came to him and says where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you are you going to cry out just because there's this uh little Temptation that's upon you are you going to cry out just because this is happening that's happening don't you forget that before the foundation of the world there was a time where the sons of God shouted for Joy that's right he he doesn't want us to just fall apart when things don't work out he doesn't want us to just give in when things don't work out God is looking for people with a backbone people that will stand upon the promise whether they can see it or don't see it they know that as long as there's a God in heaven I shall [Applause] live it says and tonight I say the same thing that God who stood Yonder in chapter one of the book of act and and and and he was taken up and in the sky and and be and became under his feet that said Jesus said lo I am with you always I will never leave you nor forsake you and works and it says and the works that I do ye shall ye ye shall always the works that I do shall you always I will be with you even in you to the end of the world he wants you to know that his angels are here how many can believe that he wants you to know that God is here he's not here because I said it he's here because his word promised that he will be here and and I and I let me let me even say this God is not here just when everybody atmosphere is charged and we screaming oh God oh God then God is here there's no less God than they will be at that time there's just enough God right now than there will be if this room was all shouting and screaming a shout don't bring God he's already here our problems don't take God away he's already here your sick don't move him away whatever situation you're going on if what you need is to come to an understanding that he here because his word says he's [Applause] here we the one that have a problem we run him over here we feel like there's more of him over this side than there is less of him on this side we feel like oh if we can bring more of him on this side then he will help us that's your own mind that's doing that and I will not help you what we need is to come where we are a founded Believers that's founded upon the faith of God to stand and say I don't care what's going on God is here because he promised that he will never leave me let me just jump butam speaks about uh uh uh Christopher Columbus he said yeah he was he was given a boat and and to come and explore and everything and then he says with a boat is given a bunch of coward people that didn't want to do what he was what he wanted to do they were there a bunch of slaves that were all scared so every time they'll go they'll look at him and says oh great Rovers what if there's a snake under the water that will pull down this boat he didn't respond he said well what if we get swallowed up with the wave or what if something will happen and everything what if we fall off through the age of the Earth a bunch of CED people that didn't want to do it the prophet said he looked at all of them he says whatever happened we're going to keep selling on whatever happens we're going to keep going on if we're going to fall to the edge of the Earth we're going to fall but he but whatam said he had a vision that there was something on the other side my brother my sister that's what we need this morning whether death whatever happen the Prophet the word promises that after this life there's another life coming up so if we die we're going to live again we can't be a bunch of coward people and scared oh oh if I do this what's going to happen as long as God is with you you go do it that's what God is looking for I was talking about a Jeff the other day and you know sometimes I feel like I forgot the name of the man but if I speak the story you understand his master send him and says I want you to go up and he was at the camp and he said they said I want you to go up and cut me this Jager tree and bring it down to Camp so he goes up the hills and he cuts down a tree and goodness he can barely move it he's trying by all his strength he can't move it he looked there and he says oh God I fa completely what you send me to do looking at it they just look in the SP like I can't do it and then he looked at him and said what are you doing can you not see that stream over there it says okay just roll the roll the tree into the stream and then ride on it my brother my sister that's what God wants us to do this morning he's giving you the word you said I don't know how I'm going to live it I don't know how I'm going to fulfill the word I don't know he said what I'm asking you is to write on the word of God whatever I send you I just want you to write on it oh I need the Rapture right upon the word I need healing right upon the word he's not asking you to produce it by yourself just write on it the word will produce what the word is asking for let me say that again the word will produce what the word is asking for it's not for you to produce it it's for the word to produce it in you so yeah we are giving access into the Unseen realm and and what God is wanting is oh before you can launch and make a decision now I want to say this I may not be able to get to it what what do you what what's inside of you is more important than your flesh don't forget that you have a soul that's worth a thousand world so but says this it said when we make decisions according to this flesh we are robbing that inner man we are robbing away from the inner man so what he wants us to do when we come time to make our choices and our decisions we don't need to make it through the five senses he wants us to take into consideration the inner man who's worth $10,000 and worlds and be able to make it by day because if you make it by the flesh you shall rip what's off the flesh but if you make it according to the Inner Man you will reip an eternal benefit I I hope I really said that right so what we need to do is when we want to make a decision take into consideration that there's a heaven that's for you take into consideration that you got the whole host of Heaven for you waiting to go to battlef for you waiting to defend you waiting to do everything that you're looking for but you cannot consider that you cannot wait for that to happen if you're making that decision according to the temporal things he will say we we have to take that into consideration and I thought about here he is you think about just this this king of Israel what what a benefit it was for them to have a prophet in the camp what benefit it was to have one that was known to be a prophet in the camp just how much benefit how much life how how their lives were spare how that they want to a lot of battles because they had one who was called the prophet in the camp and and you can go and read it it's basically the whole history of Israel you you you would think how how can you how can you win a battle just by going around the walls and singing Tell me another Army that's done that how can you win a war by taking the numbers down by saying we there's too many of us we need to cut down the numbers tell me another Army that does that you see the the it was an understanding of the Unseen resources that was at their disposal they knew it very well that if we would listen to The Prophet if we would follow what God has told us through the prophet that's where our success lies and let me say this you will never be successful by not listening to the prophet I'm sorry we will never be successful outside of the Prophet you say well we follow God has ask you which God when did he speak to you because the word of God only comes to the prophet you see that's the confusion of denomination everybody thinks they have access direct to God God can talk to them no God only talks to the prophet that's the order he's established you know people have the audacity to take the Bible and try to correct the prophet who are you the scripture says it was by the prophet that Israel was called out it was by the prophet that the Lord protected them it was always by the prophet it was by the word of God and let me say this today Rapture will only come by the word of the Prophet the Lord God should do nothing except it Reveals His secret to the prophet you want to be successful follow the prophet follow the prophet in your marriage in your business in every decision you make everything include the prophet that's the success you keep the prophet out you keep God out because the prophet doesn't speak in his own word anyway he speaks the words of God whatever comes out of the Prophet butam says that Jesus came by the words of the prophet and the bride will come by the words of the Prophet so the word will say the prophet will say so faith is now given if we can come to an understanding there's this unseen real but Apostle spoke about the resources that's made available to the believer let me say this I I and and through science I believe most of us here all of us here should have the understanding to know that our eyes can't see everything that's right we and and we know that we can't hear everything you know my kids hear things that I don't hear you know they're like What's that I'm like I can't hear my eyes can't see like other eyes cannot can see so we can truly just by science we can understand that our very five senses are extremely limited not limited but extremely Limited in fact you may even hear something that don't exist and you may get confused someone say something you hear another and how can we make eternal decisions on those five senses how can we make decisions that have eternal consequences based on that butam says one place that man was not even created to think for himself he was made so that the mind that is in Christ be in him think about this the the devil is the auor of the thinking will I really die if I ate this will will this really happen God told them the day you eat you die no questions no thinking it's the devil who introduced the thinking behind and said will that really it wants to reason with him the word of God is not given for reasoning but when will say I love this this is a message of super sense paragraph uh 53 he says it says this is preached in December 27 paragraph 53 says now God gave you those senses but you are given for you as a gift and it depends on how on how it depends on how you what you yield your senses to you will be it says will be the will be will be the way that your life is controlled the way you yield those senses five senses it says what you see what you hear what you taste and smell and feel whatever those senses are yielded to they will do they will dominate you so think about that so we we we our yielding of our senses is very important now it continue it says and we are grateful to God that we have the five senses but by no no means was these five senses given to guide you he says there were given to you for Earthly contact but they were given but it says but it was given you the six sense and the six sense is beyond beyond only only the only to the belong only to the Christian and you cannot have the six sense until you become a Christian I I think that's very clear you are not born again you don't have access to the six cents if you ever thought that you were not born again but somehow no you don't it's as clear as could be access to the six cense requires a new birth so you get access to the six cense when you are born again you you said there the until you become a Christian and it says and is the only is the only way that you can ever have any more than five natural senses for your natural person but the six sense is better known to the Christian as Faith it's the only listen to this it's the one that governs and guides you and it is the superior to all the other senses it's a superior to all the senses to the other five senses so let me say this that's why I let me repeat again don't be quick to make making a decision without the understanding that the one that really does the guiding is the six sense I I thought about David uh David he goes and he goes to he comes back to the camp and they find out that all the families and everybody was taken now David could have went to war but the scripture says that David came in he he came and everybody started blaming him it's your fault if we didn't go if we didn't do this this was never going to happen in everything David went and he sat there even though he had the right to go to war he consulted with God first waited to hear from God and God spoke to him and said go to war then he went to war that's what God wants us to do whenever difficulties come whenever challenges come whenever we get ready to make a decision he doesn't want you just to run just because you are right it doesn't mean you have to do it just because this happened it doesn't mean you have to react and he wants you to consult with him he wants you to go and know what word am I standing on what what what is my six sense telling me what is it that I really have to do what is it am I doing this as a temporary decision or is it something now will take me a long way we fell we fell trapped to that many times we make decisions because we were desperate we felt like we needed it quicker we felt like if I waited it was going to take too long we feel like oh I want to we did it for self-preservation God don't want you to preserve yourself he wants you to be he wants to be the one who's preserving you he wants to be the one guiding you he wants when all is said and none he wants to be the one who's got his hand on you he continues on and it says paragraph 55 it says now I would say that I would say it says I would not say that because you have received the six sense that the five senses are no no no good for no more yes they are those five five senses were given to you by God I like the way the prophet put that things those five senses were given to you by God but they are not to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word of God then they are lying you're not saved I'm saved I don't care what my S is tell the the the saving is not a fact to the senses you you're not Sav when you feel like you're sitting in Heavenly places you could be in a hell that's right God is there everything could be going on fire god is there our emotions are not there to bring God God is already there oh if we can get beyond the five cent said and I'm speaking even to myself you know it's not because we come and the church is half empty then God is not here as much as you no remember the prophet say a spoonful of the ocean water is equal to the whole ocean if we can fix our understanding oh I say that's what the message of the end time came to do it wasn't that God was uh he came to necessarily do something new but he came to open our eyes so we can get the vision of what happened in heaven Oh my he talks about a uh Moses he says Moses stood there he had access to everything Naturally Speaking he was he had he was the prince he had if he wanted to save the children of Israel he could have just waited a couple of years until he became pharaoh and then he took them out or just let them go but that was in God's program butam says every time he stood upon the balcony when Pharaoh looked and he saw a bunch of slave every time when he looked he saw the people of God and brother says by Vision he looked at Egypt being the greatest army that there was he saw them in flame I want you to think about that yeah they are the greatest army that existed he's looking at them because why he was looking through the Unseen eyes I wonder if we look our situations to the endc I wonder if we consider the end in our decision making I wonder if we are considering that there's more than what our eyes could see will continue on in the super sense he says that paragraph 57 he says and the super sense is the holy spirit Faith the faith of God that dwelleth in you and he will it says and if you will let the five senses be yielded to the six sense it will guide you and bring all the other five senses under control control of the super sense for it says for it's for it's for it's far above the natural sense and the spiritual uh man is above the natural it says it's as far high as the heavens is above the natural man and is the five senses it says and he makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but it cannot touch the super sense that's far beyond his reach that come that come from God it's called faith and faith is that great thing that's why we need to operate faith is that great thing he wants us to operate by the six sense he wants you to know that there's an army I was thinking about this I thought yeah we are you know we live in the age of AI and all the great things that man is able to do artificial intelligence but when I'm speaks about in the countdown here is men went from horse and buggy and they went to uh uh bicycles and uh uh Automobiles and you he went to cars and airplanes and then astronaut but God says but God has a different order their astronaut has to go and be put into an isolation clothing that he can go if he breathe the air from outside he will die but our astronaut went up there without nothing man is always because remember says that man gets into and let me just let me just for the sake of time now now let me say this and then we'll get into that we we understand that we we live in what is known as the three dimension so we have time we have light we have matter so we we understand that that's that's the dimension that we are in and and we understand that there's what is known as the fourth dimension and I'm will talk about it we know uh television and radio in fact it would say that if we would have a perfect receiver here will be able to receive those things they are here there's video flying in this room there's sounds that are flying in this room our eyes are not made to see them but if we put a perfect receiver we'll be able to get them we understand that and we understand that the the The Fifth Dimension is known as the region of the lost and we know that there's the region of the Lost there's the demon spirit and then there's hell excuse me for a second is the the we we go from this three dimension that we live in which is time light and matter we move on to the fourth Dimension which is the the the signal the the the the the radio and and and the television and the signals and all those things we go in The Fifth Dimension that that representation of the region of the Lost and the region of uh of demons and then hell where where where Satan uh is H and and then we we go we understand that banam talks about the sixth Dimension which is heaven uh where where where those that are resting knows that die in Christ where they are found and then we know that that's where bam went when he went through the the the beyond the curtain and when he asked where Jesus was they said it was a dimension above which was the seventh Dimension so he would come and but he was residing in the seven Dimension so we understand those are the Realms and I want to say this the realm that we are in is the realm of manifestation so the the the demons are pricing into this realm and they need a human body in order for them to be manifested but we also understand that God's holy spirit is placing in this Dimension that's why prop will say that as Heaven is represented on this Dimension so is heaven also so hell is represented by the demons and they'll go upon the people and manifest themselves and we understand that was also say that the same way that heaven is here and heaven heaven has has to be manifested in the people amen so there's a battle going on around us at all the time why because the holy spirit is here to motivate you to entice you to move you is wanting you to cause you so you can realize you're in a great battle so when the Devil comes and he changes the vision of what's in front of you what you don't need is to broke down and fail what you need is to call for a heavenly vision to be manifested I thought about Jonah my goodness you think about impossible situation Not only was he in the ocean but he was in the Well's belly and the scripture says but but I like how it says everywhere he turned he looked I mean would you even know which way is north south or east are you looking up or are you looking down but job look and he says this is lying vanity he called it he looked at it he call it lying vanity it says once again will I look towards your Holy Temple my brother my sister let me say this in the name of the Lord the invisible the Unseen is more real than what you see let me say that again what we see what we touch is not real what's more real is what comes from the UN oh I have pain and yeah I have pain I can feel it I know you can feel it but I want you to call the heavenly vision oh if we can only move to those senses one one says in a message looking into the Unseen I know we have a baptism so I'll come to a close soon I love this and if you didn't get anything if you can only understand this if you can put it up there looking into the Unseen paragraph n the same one I've been reading preaching 58 this uh 58 October 3rd he says this N9 it says now may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word isn't it a strange thing that man who was made in the image of God and in the likeness of God was called of him to walk by faith believing that God is and would choose to walk by sight instead of by faith after his makeup his being and all that dwell in him was fashioned in the likeness of God think about it I think that's a strong statement you were not made to walk by the five senses it's isn't that even the message of the hour he's coming to let you know before you were flesh made you were Heavenly made first I I thought our prayers should be like Jesus everywhere we go we said father I want what was done in heaven to be made known on Earth everywhere we go our desire is the manifestation of what was H in heaven to be made we are representative of heaven we are not representative of this flesh of this Earth we were placed in this Earth so that the heaven can be manifested throughout yes sir it says and all that dwell in him was fashion in the likeness of God and God who is that great Jehovah who call those things which were not as though they were calling out of the Unseen into the visible realm and man was made to live with God in the in this manner and yet he chooses to walk by his sight he wanted to be his own boss he wanted no man to tell him what to do that's just the nature of man I say God take away that nature take away that nature I have surrendered my works when I got born again I have given up all my rights I don't want to have the nature of man I don't want to have the thinking of man I want the thoughts of Christ to become my thoughts let me say this you will achieve more by faith that you can ever achieve with any of your senses we can put all our heads together what we'll achieve by faith will be a lot greater than what we can achieve with our own mind God wants us to achieve by faith he wants us to come together let me say you talk about atomic bomb the Christian has a much bigger atomic bomb than what men can create tell me one thing that men can create that's greater than what can God create they're still trying to figure out how the Red Sea open they're still trying to figure out how the Sun stop was it the Earth that stopped was it the sun I don't know you go figure that out all I know is man spoke and it came to pass let's use that sense let's walk by faith and not by sight but when I'm says Abraham Abraham he went no not knowing where he was going he went from tent to tent looking and waiting for that City whose build a maker was God but when I'm says it was by the Unseen by faith he saw Isaac before Isaac could even be manifested oh my brother my sister let me say this if you walk with the Unseen this morning you will see your rapture you'll see your body change you'll see whatever you have need of you'll see that God walking next to you you'll see that victory that you are looking for you'll see the good health next to you you'll see everything now but the only way you can see it is through the Unseen it's not through your natural eyes the way it works is it comes from The Unseen into the natural how did you get here this morning how did you believe this message did you look at the message and say well let me find out if this Prophet is really true I'm going to study the Bible and prove it if that's you you're at the wrong place it was God but when says you stumble into sub Mission somewhere and you heard the preacher preaching you couldn't even remember what the preacher was saying but something within the heart was beating you said oh God save my soul oh God I have need of you and he took you from wherever you are drunken prostitute murderers whatever you were he brought you into a son and a daughter of God what did that bam says faith did that when you believe God gave you a faith to drive out of those things and if we started by faith we're going to change it later no that faith is here building up but what I'm says it's the accumulation of all the faith it's the accumulation of all that you have seen all that you have heard all that your eyes have seen everything that God has been dying doing since the beginning the foundation of the world is accumulated in this same time it's accumulated so much that we saw God in the human flesh the believer we read it it's the faith of God that moves in you those are no words to just entice our intellect that's the reality of the Living God I I don't want to do things by my strength I want the faith of God to come in my heart raise me up at a bed in the morning say you're going to go to church today you said I'm not feeling well the Faith said whether you feel well you don't feel well we're going to [Applause] church I know when when I've messed up I don't know what to do I don't want to see anybody the faith of God comes inside of you and said stand up you're not going to stay down stand up we're going to go when I don't know how to pay my bills I don't know what's going on and I don't know what what I'm going to do and everything the faith of God comes and say you don't have to worry I've got you I'm going to take care of you when I'm sick the faith of God said I'm the Lord God that healed all th diseases that's how God want us he wants fellowship and not some type of religion he wants Fellowship where we become one with him where people will looking and say you surely are crazy you said I'm crazy for Jesus amen there's nothing wrong with that I think the problem is some people don't want to be called crazy I call myself crazy to begin with so I'm not ashamed for anybody to add and call me crazy it's just going to confirm what I've been thinking for a long time let me say this we are called to walk by faith there's unseen but one says if the world with the five senses they reach out into this other dimension and they pull down things vaccine cars uh planes what where are they getting it from they're not getting in from this Dimension you know the prophet say that they're coming in they're bringing it from the other dimension he says how much more a Christian how much more untapped resources do we have we are not made to live and try to support ourselves we are made to call on things that are not as though they were and the reality that the devil is beinging before us butam says we are called to look at those things that are as though they were not if the musician could come but says paragraph 10 but man is like a sheep and the Sheep cannot find its way back I'm told when it's lost it's totally lost it says and that's the way with men when he's lost is absolutely helpless he must have a Shepherd to guide him and man when he chooses as the day goes on we find out that continually getting worse choosing rather to walk by sight then instead by faith in then instead by Faith by the Unseen and when he does that he robs the inner man which is the soul and that's the Eternal part of that man you you would think today that man will make much better decision that men in the 70s or 60s you would think think thing but today it's completely rabbish I mean it's foolishness to see the things that men is coming out of men's mouth to see the debates that you hear either on politics or other stuff you're like is this what man has turned into this is the prophet speaking it it says once he's made the wrong decision the more he continues he's only showing his foolishness continually you know it's like a man finding an error the more you push him the more you just he's just digging it right I mean it's just continually you know the best thing to do sometimes when you're wrong is just to shut up it's just digging God is saying look come you you made wrong you you made the wrong decision you walk by the flesh you walk by the five senses that was okay but now it's time to turn around now it's time to walk by the spirit now it's time to put the five senses to put the six Senses Into the equation now it's time to consider heaven now it's time to consider all the other resources that are made available and let me say this you are not made to be successful without the heaven Heaven is your success Heaven is your blueprint the word of God is how you become successful the the success that comes from the Christian is the ability to apply what the six sense is working in us let's all stand [Applause] but bam says in paragraph 11 of that same message it says men shall not leave by bread alone sayth the Lord but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and then it says and the man's physical being to take care of it is not not all the reasons God put him on here on Earth think about it to take care of your physical Reon is not altogether the reason why you are putting in here because what it does with a physical being amount to very little his soul is soul what counts it's the inward man that did not come from the earth it comes from heaven and that's the Eternal part of of the human being but yet strange that he tries to figure out his own way out and we find out so so in the scriptures that when man chooses to walk by his own way and do the and do the way that he wants to do God just let him alone he says man must not think for himself he must have he must he must let the mind that was in Christ be in him we are not to think for ourselves we are we are to call anything contrary to what is said as though it is not no matter what or I see or what our eyes claim to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe I love that I love that imagine this morning and you know the doctors is giv the notes and saying you will never amount to nothing you will die and you have cancer you will never have a child and this will happen imagine that's the what the doctors have given you imagine that's the reality that the world has presented to you yes he the prophet saying that you cannot live by that we live by what we believe oh this morning if I can say you know what the doctor say I'm going to live God said the doctor said I'm I'm going to die God said I'm going to live the doctor say I'm sick I'm well the doctor said I can't have a baby God has not said that I imagine if we can replace what the doctors are saying with what the word is saying imagine how much success will get but if we feel like we are stuck and we feel that's the outter man that's talking to you don't talk to the outer man let the inner man talk to you for a moment let that six sense talk to you let that six sense be lifted up that's why the preaching of the word is to energize the faith that's inside of us so we can contact the Unseen RAM and know that that God is living and he's here this morning and today why to make his word a reality amen if you have a it upon your heart why don't you just lift your hand up to him I want to say within my heart this morning I said Lord I I I have walked by the five senses so many times and I made decisions day in and day out by the five senses every time and you know a child is sick it's the five senses that goes out first and this happen the five senses jumps out first and this Happ in the five cents Lord I I I don't mind but I want to I want the six cents to be activated this morning Father I want when even when the five senses come I don't want to stop right there I want to include the six senses in the equation I want to include heaven in the equation I want to think for a moment about the antip resources that you have for me I want to consider what your possibility is I want to look upon the Eternal I want to know that all things are possible I want to know that this is not the end of me I want to know that there's a God and there's an army and there's everything made available to fight for me I want to consider that before I can make my final decision if that's your heart desire just lift up to him and you pray to him this morning in your own mouth and say Lord I want the six cents to be included I want the six cents to come to my rescue this morning I Want You Lord and to help me to know that the resources are made available I want to tap those re I want a taste of you and know that you are good I want a taste of heaven and Know that heaven is a reality our gracious father we're so thankful this morning father this is simple but it's to just remind us once again that Lord you said that without faith we cannot please God and Lord we come before you Lord and to ask once again and may you just come by the way of this congregation and Lord if there be

the Lord amen praise God I I tell you this is what the church was built for this is this is when the church is at best is when souls are being born that's the purpose of the soul the the church is to gather up the souls those elected ones from every generation that we bring in into the kingdom of God because remember it says this promise is to you and unto you and unto your children's children as many as our Lord God shall call so a Kurt wants to be baptized and the scripture says here in uh acts 237 it says now when they when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostle men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and and your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exort saying save yourself from this unto generation I'm so glad because this is really what faith will do we heard it this morning Faith gives you access to the other Kingdom so when our brother gets baptized there's the promise of the gift of the Holy Spirit and let me say this to anybody and and I you know especially our young people they always run it do I have the Holy Ghost you receiving the Holy Ghost is not up to you you follow the formula God is obligated to give it to you it you follow you you repent repent and you are baptized God it becomes God's obligation to give it to you in fact let me even say this what caus you to come to be baptized it's the Holy Ghost working in you it's the spirit of God working in you knocking and working and bringing the seed that was predestinated into the perfect manifestation and we are happy to see it and I told him I said now you get the six sense now you get access to that other dimension now the Unseen will be made visible for you amen Amen brother CCT we as we are commissioned to go into all the world the scripture says go into the all the world and baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and by divine revelation we have been uh uh told and we have been taught by the prophet at the end time that the name of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so therefore we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ amen there's another one so sister Twilight yes you want to say something no no okay all right so the same promise as we read it said when they heard that were pricked in the heart and they asked men and Brethren what shall we do there's only one formula repent and be baptized and you shall re in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the blessings and here's the blessings that comes with this when you are repent you you repent you are baptized you are automatically part of the kingdom and let me say this there's no other way into the kingdom except by the new birth and the new birth is not your own imagination is the obedience to the word The Obedience to the word of God that en entitles you to the Token so a sister is obeying the word of God she's been pricked within her hearts and she wants to be baptized and therefore by being baptized she will by default receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so sister tler we as I said we are commissioned to go into all the world and baptize every single one of them that will believe and there therefore we baptize you in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost which by divine revelation we believe is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ therefore we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there are two roads you may take who one by side and one by Fai take the word of God for what you [Music] see what you believe is why will be set Yours to the wind of f oh you can fly in a [Music]
