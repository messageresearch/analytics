[2:09] [Music]
[3:45] And let's all stand and sing Tonight,
[3:50] oh Lord, I come to you.
[3:55] Let my heart be changed.
[3:59] Re
[4:01] flowing from the grace
[4:05] that I found
[4:08] in you.
[4:16] Oh Lord, I've come to know
[4:21] the weaknesses I see
[4:25] in me
[4:27] will be stripped away
[4:33] by the power of your love.

[5:25] me on in the power you love.
[5:35] Oh Lord, open up in my eyes.
[5:40] Let me see you face
[5:44] to face the knowledge of your love
[5:50] as you live

[8:34] [Music]
[8:37] Oh, and it
[8:40] I
[8:43] rise up like an eagle
[8:49] and I will sore with you. Your spirit
[8:53] leads me on in the power of your love.
[9:00] Hallelujah.
[9:02] Amen. That's what we rely on. It's the
[9:05] power of his love that saves that end.
[9:07] It's the power of love that really
[9:09] brings all that God desire out of us.
[9:12] Amen. We know we can't do it by our own
[9:14] strength. What we desire is for that
[9:16] love to come and work in us. But Jerome,
[9:19] if you could just come and open our
[9:20] service in prayer. Amen.
[9:33] Let's look to God in prayer.
[9:36] Heavenly Father, we come tonight in the
[9:37] precious name of Jesus, Lord, to praise
[9:40] and to magnify your name. We thank you
[9:44] once again for strength in our body, for
[9:47] the activity of our limbs that you woke
[9:50] us up this morning, saved and in our
[9:53] right mind. We are so grateful that you
[9:56] placed the desire within our hearts to
[9:58] be assembled in the house of God. But we
[10:01] know Lord God as we assemble together as
[10:04] a body of believers, Lord God, there are
[10:06] many needs in this great house. Lord
[10:09] God, I pray and ask in the name of Jesus
[10:12] that if we would only keep our mind
[10:15] stayed upon him, Lord God, Lord, even
[10:19] now, Lord God, with the worries and the
[10:21] cares of this world, I pray even now for
[10:25] this sacred hour that we would lay all
[10:28] of our cares and our worries aside.
[10:31] The Bible says, "Cast all of our cares
[10:34] upon him before he carth, Lord." and to
[10:38] come boldly before God's throne of grace
[10:41] and to ask whatever we will in Jesus'
[10:44] name and it shall be done. There's
[10:47] strength and there's power and authority
[10:50] within your word Lord God. I pray
[10:53] tonight, Lord God, that someone would be
[10:55] delivered, Lord God. Even now, somebody
[10:58] is receiving a healing touch, Lord God,
[11:01] simply by being in your presence, Lord
[11:04] God. Those aches and pains seem to
[11:07] vanish away. All the troubles that we
[11:09] have in our families, with our
[11:11] relationships, Lord God, they seem so
[11:14] unimportant in this hour. Help us to sit
[11:18] at your feet, Lord God, and learn from
[11:21] you and not be worried about the cares
[11:24] of this world. I pray for the man of God
[11:27] tonight and for the word of God that you
[11:29] would anoint him aresh, Lord God, that
[11:32] you would use him, Lord God, for your
[11:35] glory. I pray right now for a special
[11:37] touch in his body, Lord God. I pray for
[11:40] new direction and new guidance, Lord
[11:42] God. I pray that you would cast all of
[11:46] his cares away. And I pray that you
[11:48] would open up a window in heaven. Pour
[11:50] him out a blessing, Lord God, that they
[11:53] won't be room to receive for it's in
[11:56] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[12:02] Amen. God bless you. Want to welcome
[12:04] everyone in the house of God. May turn
[12:06] around and welcome someone tonight and
[12:08] all our visitors. God bless you. Amen.
[12:15] [Music]
[12:18] Amen. God bless you. May have your
[12:20] seats.
[12:23] I'd rather
[12:25] have Jesus
[12:29] than save
[12:31] old.
[12:34] I'd rather
[12:36] be his than have riches
[12:42] untold.
[12:45] I'd rather
[12:47] have Jesus
[12:50] that houses
[12:53] all land.
[12:55] I'd rather
[12:57] be led
[13:00] by his nail

[13:59] be faithful
[14:02] to him.
[14:07] I'd rather
[14:10] have Jesus
[14:13] than worldwide
[14:16] fame.
[14:17] I'd rather
[14:20] be true
[14:22] to his holy
[14:26] name. Oh, and to be
[14:30] the king
[14:32] of a bal

[16:23] verse again.
[16:26] All that is fair
[16:30] that little
[16:33] of
[16:36] the Lord.

[16:40] than I

[16:52] bring.
[16:57] Oh, and I

[18:38] sun to shine again.
[18:42] I know the master of the wind.

[18:55] sky.

[19:01] found.
[19:03] Oh, and by an unexpected
[19:06] stor

[23:02] Let's bow our hearts.
[23:04] Gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[23:07] we count it joy to be in your house,
[23:09] Lord Jesus.
[23:12] Father, I'm reminded of David who spoke
[23:16] that he was happy when they told him,
[23:17] "Let us come into the house of the
[23:19] Lord."
[23:21] Father, in a midweek service like this,
[23:23] in the midst of all that goes on, Lord,
[23:28] sometimes we can make it a routine,
[23:29] Lord.
[23:31] I've been guilty of that myself, Lord.
[23:34] But father, if I could but just open my
[23:36] heart, Lord Jesus, the same God that can
[23:39] move in meetings. The same God that can
[23:42] move when there's plenty of expectation,
[23:45] different people come in with a fire on
[23:46] their heart. You're still the same God
[23:48] on a Wednesday service. Lord, you can
[23:51] still touch the hearts of the people.
[23:53] You can still speak life, Lord Jesus.
[23:56] Father,
[23:58] we just invite you to come, Lord Jesus.
[24:01] Be in our midst, Father. It's all about
[24:03] you. We ask you to have the preeminence,
[24:06] Lord Jesus, in everything that takes
[24:09] place. Father, bless the tithes and the
[24:11] offerings. Bless the man of God that's
[24:13] preparing to come out here and give us
[24:15] something from your throne, Lord Jesus.
[24:18] Speak those words, Lord Jesus, that we
[24:20] might leave and said, "It was good to be
[24:22] in your presence, Lord. That we might be
[24:25] able to go and tell somebody of what a
[24:27] good God we serve, what a mighty God we
[24:30] serve. Father,
[24:31] &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord Jesus. Too many times
[24:34] we forget to tell you just how much we
[24:36] love you, Lord. We just think you know,
[24:40] but Father, you like to hear it from our
[24:42] lips. So, Father, from the bottom of my
[24:45] heart, I say, "I love you, Lord. And I
[24:47] thank you for all that you do.
[24:50] Just have your way in the remaining of
[24:52] the service, Lord Jesus. We ask it in
[24:55] your wonderful, precious, holy, and
[24:56] powerful name. Amen.
[25:04] All there are to
[25:09] you may take
[25:13] all one by side,
[25:17] one path of faith. Oh, and take the word
[25:23] of God.
[25:25] Oh, what you see,
[25:29] why ter
[25:31] [Music]
[25:33] is what will be.
[25:37] Send your wings
[25:41] to the wings of faith.
[25:45] Oh, and you can fly
[25:49] in the higher place.
[25:52] [Music]
[25:54] our struggle.
[25:58] It's by grace
[26:02] set your wings
[26:05] to the wings of faith. Oh, and I watch
[26:10] your knee.
[26:13] Oh, and I watch your cry.
[26:17] Oh, watch your mountain.
[26:21] [Music]
[26:23] Hallelujah.
[26:25] Oh, and speak the word of God.
[26:30] And my and my
[26:34] Oh, you won't move.
[26:36] [Music]
[26:38] Oh, you will fly.
[26:41] Oh, set your wings
[26:45] to the wings of
[26:48] [Music]
[26:50] you can fly.
[26:53] [Music]
[26:56] Oh, I do not struggle.
[27:02] It's by grace.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand and sing it as we invite
[27:09] our pastor tonight.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, and watch the go
[27:17] [Music]
[27:18] in the sky.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:22] He does not struggle.
[27:26] He does not work. Oh, and for the power
[27:33] that makes it
[27:37] all
[27:39] [Music]
[27:41] the
[27:46] set
[27:51] of
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, where you can find
[27:58] a
[27:58] [Music]
[28:01] Oh, and do not struggle.
[28:06] It's by grace.
[28:10] [Music]
[28:17] &gt;&gt; And let us pray.
[28:19] Our gracious
[28:21] heavenly father,
[28:25] Lord, your word is ever true.
[28:28] It's eternal,
[28:32] Father. It hasn't changed
[28:35] and its promises haven't changed,
[28:38] but people changed and the world's
[28:40] changed, but you've remained the same.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you to bless our memory
[28:48] and bring us back to the ways of our
[28:51] fathers. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen.
[28:56] If you have your Bibles
[28:59] and you'll turn with me to
[29:02] uh
[29:04] Malachi
[29:06] the fourth chapter
[29:10] and the fourth verse and we'll read from
[29:12] there.
[29:16] Remember
[29:19] ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I
[29:24] commanded unto him in Horeb for all of
[29:28] Israel with the statutes and judgments.
[29:32] Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[29:35] before the coming of the great and
[29:36] dreadful day of the Lord. He shall turn
[29:39] the hearts of the fathers to the
[29:42] children and the hearts of the children
[29:44] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[29:48] the earth with the curse. Heavenly
[29:50] Father, we ask you to bless this word in
[29:53] Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And
[29:57] God bless you. You may be seated.
[30:03] I hope that you all enjoyed the meetings
[30:07] this last weekend and and the Lord had
[30:11] dealt with your hearts concerning
[30:14] the things of what it means to be a
[30:17] Christian.
[30:18] Uh we read here in the fourth verse,
[30:22] remember ye the law of Moses, my
[30:25] servant.
[30:27] You know, memory was a great part of the
[30:31] heritage
[30:33] of the Jews as they went forward from
[30:37] Israel,
[30:39] uh, as they went forward from Egypt to
[30:44] Israel,
[30:45] the land, what we call the promised
[30:49] land. And God even told him on that
[30:52] Exodus, he said, "We we want you to
[30:55] remember. We want you to mark this day.
[30:58] We want you put the blood on the post
[31:00] and we want you to eat the Passover."
[31:04] And then he said, "We want you to keep
[31:06] that Passover and eat that Passover and
[31:09] celebrate this day
[31:12] uh that it doesn't leave your memory.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Tell your children's children."
[31:19] and tell them of the day. We read of the
[31:23] stones coming across uh uh the Jordan
[31:27] River and putting that st down as a
[31:30] memorial so they wouldn't forget that
[31:34] day.
[31:36] And we find out that when the day of the
[31:41] the day gone by is forgotten,
[31:46] a piece of the foundation is forgotten.
[31:50] They don't remember what it took.
[31:53] Uh we have Memorial Day uh here to honor
[31:58] and and remember
[32:00] uh our our country and the lives that
[32:05] were given and what it took to bring us
[32:10] to where we are. The price that was
[32:12] paid, the people that served, the the
[32:17] effort that it took. Uh we are reminded
[32:21] of World War I and World War II and the
[32:24] Korean War and the people that fought
[32:28] that we could have the freedom that we
[32:31] have. But you know, people have just
[32:34] taken it for granted and they no longer
[32:38] remember. They don't re remember the
[32:40] price that was paid and and a younger
[32:43] generation comes on and they don't have
[32:46] the same values. And in fact, they they
[32:49] don't believe war is necessary and there
[32:51] shouldn't have been a war and it's all
[32:54] terrible. But they forgot the things
[32:56] that paid for them.
[32:59] You know, they forgot the work that it
[33:01] takes. They forget. They're so
[33:04] interested in the future that they don't
[33:06] want to remember the past. They don't
[33:08] want to be linked to any of the values
[33:12] or any of the choices that our fathers
[33:15] have made. And therefore the fathers no
[33:19] longer are important. Our founding
[33:21] fathers are a bunch of old fogies. And
[33:24] George Washington and Abraham Lincoln
[33:27] are are are
[33:30] just men that made mistakes. And the
[33:33] dollar is what it's all about. And
[33:36] values have continued to go downhill.
[33:40] That's the nature
[33:43] of our country is the nature of
[33:48] where we are and what we're about. The
[33:51] respect for our police department have
[33:54] gone down. Defund the police and and the
[33:57] attitude towards them and and uh we
[34:00] don't need policemen, we need social
[34:03] workers. And that's the the way and the
[34:07] trend and that's being lost and the past
[34:12] is being lost and the history is being
[34:17] lost. And so it just came on my heart
[34:21] very very strong tonight for us to
[34:28] play
[34:30] uh the video that we have called deep
[34:35] calleth
[34:37] to the deep and it shows our messenger
[34:41] in a interview and it shows him
[34:44] explaining his ministry and it gives us
[34:47] an opportunity to look at the type of
[34:50] man that he was, his humility, his
[34:54] nature, to look at his meeting and his
[34:58] preaching and to see how he prayed for
[35:02] the sick, how simple it was and what
[35:07] manner that he held himself in. And then
[35:12] maybe Sunday evening we'll play uh the
[35:17] message
[35:19] uh I think it's also uh maybe called
[35:23] deep call to the deep this tape is
[35:26] called the 20th century prophet and then
[35:30] Sunday evening we might uh look at deep
[35:35] cloth too because we found out by the
[35:38] lord dealing with our hearts that the
[35:40] way forward forward is to go back. It's
[35:43] no it's no good to go forward if you're
[35:46] on the wrong road.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Or you have the
[35:50] wrong attitude or you you have the wrong
[35:54] emphasis
[35:56] or or you're leaving something out.
[35:59] So I I hope this evening this is just uh
[36:03] I think is 19 minutes long.
[36:07] I'm not sure. but to bring us back into
[36:10] remembrance
[36:12] the foundation
[36:14] that this message was built on.
[36:18] Those meetings where he discerned the
[36:20] thoughts and hearts of the people when
[36:23] he did miracles and signs and wonders
[36:27] and the nation that he did it in. How
[36:31] that he gave the preeminence to the Lord
[36:35] Jesus. Those are the things that make us
[36:38] what we are. But now we have a new
[36:41] generation that wasn't there.
[36:44] And it's so easy for them to be brought
[36:46] into emotionalism.
[36:48] It's so easy for them to put their eyes
[36:51] and focus on preaching and and uh you
[36:56] know uh the excitement and the uh ma way
[37:02] the gospel is being preached today and
[37:06] but I want you to look at and see that
[37:09] that wasn't how that it was.
[37:13] Amen. A lot of it is things that we've
[37:15] added and and excitement that we've
[37:18] added and and ways our ways
[37:23] that we have brought in
[37:26] &gt;&gt; and how are we going to know our ways
[37:29] from his ways?
[37:31] And I think if we could just take a
[37:33] moment to go back in this tape I he'll
[37:37] pray for the sick. I want you to see how
[37:40] simple
[37:42] it was and what the humility was. I want
[37:46] you to see the nature of how that he
[37:50] preached and how different it is from
[37:54] the way that we have started to preach.
[37:59] And so I I want to go forward and I want
[38:02] to go with God,
[38:04] but I want us to be brought into
[38:06] remembrance of how that he was and his
[38:10] way. So it's just, you know, and that's
[38:14] what he says, remember, don't forget.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And so I want us to remember how brother
[38:20] Brandham was, not to forget, to look at
[38:23] him, to see him, see his humility, see
[38:27] his nature. and for us to remind us that
[38:31] that's the way that he was. Not the way
[38:34] that he's presented to us today by so
[38:39] many, but at least we've got record.
[38:43] And so let's look at the record and
[38:46] let's associate and recall and remember
[38:50] and let our minds be refreshed of what
[38:54] it really was to have the hearts of the
[38:58] children turned to the fathers. So I
[39:01] hope you enjoy this 19 minutes. I hope
[39:04] it helps you. I hope it helps us all go
[39:07] back and stay humble and catch the
[39:11] humility and catch the simplicity and
[39:14] catch the love that was manifested. So,
[39:18] God bless you as you're going to see the
[39:21] fulfillment of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30,
[39:27] and Revelations
[39:29] 10:7 this evening. God bless you. Lord,
[39:33] bless you as you watch this to see me. I
[39:36] Should we turn off the lights? Would it
[39:38] make it easier? Uh, we'll turn some
[39:42] lights down.
[40:34] May I present my wife? Honey, this is
[40:37] brother Leroy and Paul Cop of Los
[40:40] Angeles, California.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Delighted to have you in our home,
[40:43] Brother Cop.
[40:47] Brother Brandham, in your two great
[40:48] campaigns at Los Angeles, at Calvary
[40:51] Temple, we noticed that the Lord Jesus
[40:53] Christ worked with you in a very special
[40:55] manner with these marvelous gifts, these
[40:58] earning of the spirits of men's hearts,
[41:00] as well as the sicknesses of their body
[41:02] and the signs of healing and miracles
[41:04] that were wrought. We thought it was
[41:06] wonderful.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; We interested, Brother Brandham, in
[41:08] hearing more about this unique minister
[41:10] that God has given you.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Very well, brother Cop. Let's go back to
[41:15] the beginning.
[41:17] I was born in eastern Kentucky in a
[41:20] little log cabin near Burksville,
[41:23] Kentucky.
[41:26] The morning of my birth, I'm told of my
[41:28] parents
[41:31] that there was a light came into the
[41:32] room and hung over me.
[41:36] My people was not a religious people.
[41:39] They did not go to any church. Of
[41:43] course, this caused quite a stir among
[41:46] them. It's followed me all the days of
[41:49] my life.
[41:51] Recently, they took a picture of it in
[41:53] the scientific world as shown here.
[41:57] You're probably familiar with this
[41:59] picture.
[42:00] It was proven by science that it was the
[42:03] only
[42:04] supernatural being that was ever
[42:06] scientifically photographed. To my
[42:08] opinion, it's the same angel of God
[42:14] that followed the children of Israel
[42:18] from
[42:19] Egypt unto Palestine.
[42:22] You know, as a scholar yourself,
[42:25] that was the angel of the covenant, none
[42:27] other than our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[42:30] when here on earth,
[42:33] manifested in flesh, he did not claim to
[42:36] be a great person.
[42:38] He said the son can do nothing just as
[42:41] the father shows him.
[42:44] He in St. John the 5th chapter perhaps
[42:48] you're acquainted with it the scripture
[42:52] Jesus passed through this famous pool of
[42:55] Bethesda.
[42:56] He find many crippled people there blind
[43:00] halt lame waiting for the moving of the
[43:03] waters.
[43:04] It was strange that he just ministered
[43:06] to one. But if you'll notice, he knew
[43:10] where that person was. The father had
[43:12] showed him. He healed this one. Perhaps
[43:15] he he wasn't crippled. He was just
[43:18] laying on a pallet. But Jesus healed
[43:20] him.
[43:22] And then further in the chapter, we find
[43:24] about the 19th verse that he was
[43:27] questioned by the Jews.
[43:30] Perhaps it would be questionable today
[43:33] why God would pass through a place where
[43:35] all those people were lame and halt and
[43:37] blind and would not heal them all. But
[43:41] here I'll quote his words. He said,
[43:43] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[43:46] can do nothing of himself, but what he
[43:50] sees the Father do, this doeth the Son
[43:53] likewise." than according to his own
[43:56] word.
[43:57] His ministry was based upon
[44:01] visions from his father.
[44:04] Would not be strange then that his
[44:06] ministry should be carried on as he
[44:08] promised his disciples. The things that
[44:10] I do shall you do also. Greater than
[44:13] this shall you do, for I go unto my
[44:15] father. He said, "A little while and the
[44:18] world seeth me no more. Yet ye shall see
[44:20] me for I'll be with you even in you to
[44:24] the end of the world. Jesus Christ the
[44:27] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[44:31] I believe it's a confirmation in this
[44:33] last days of the resurrection of Jesus
[44:37] Christ living among his people,
[44:39] performing the same signs and wonders
[44:40] that he did when he was here on earth.
[44:43] At the age of seven, we moved from
[44:46] Kentucky to Indiana, up the road a bit
[44:49] from where we live now.
[44:51] We packed our water then from a well,
[44:55] some city block I suppose, behind the
[44:57] old country home.
[44:59] One beautiful
[45:01] September afternoon, while coming from
[45:04] the pump with some water, it was a
[45:06] stately popper tree stood about halfway
[45:10] between the pump and the home. Passing
[45:14] by there, there was a whirl of wind in
[45:16] the tree. What we call here a whirlwind.
[45:21] Why, it was nothing odd for that time of
[45:23] year in this part of the country, but it
[45:25] remained in the tree. It didn't leave. I
[45:28] stopped to see what it was, and a voice
[45:31] spoke from it, saying, "Do not ever
[45:34] smoke or drink or defile your body in
[45:36] any way, for there will be a work for
[45:38] you to do when you get older."
[45:41] Frightened,
[45:43] that's not a word for it. I ran home
[45:46] quickly, telling my mother that a man
[45:49] spoke to me out of a tree. Well, she
[45:51] thought I was nervous. She put me to
[45:53] bed. But from then on, visions begin to
[45:56] come. And when this comes up on me, it
[45:59] produces a vision. I'm able to tell
[46:02] people what's wrong with them and what
[46:05] they must do in life and the sins that
[46:07] they are holding back in their life. At
[46:10] the age of 37,
[46:12] one night, I was praying in my room.
[46:15] And when I raised up, I noticed there
[46:18] was a light on the floor and looking
[46:20] around to see where it come from. It was
[46:22] coming from above.
[46:24] The pillar of fire was hanging just
[46:27] above was throwing the light on the
[46:29] floor. I heard someone walking.
[46:33] I looked coming through the room. Coming
[46:35] into this light came a man and human
[46:38] figure. He had be about 200 lb of
[46:41] weight. He had dark hair to his shoulder
[46:43] and olive complexion. Is barefooted.
[46:47] Of course, I was frightened. And he said
[46:49] to me, "Fear not." And as soon as I
[46:52] heard that voice, I knew it was the same
[46:54] voice that had always spoke to me. But
[46:56] the first time I'd ever seen him in
[46:57] human form, he said, "I am sent from the
[47:00] presence of God to tell you that you're
[47:03] to pray for sick people. Great signs and
[47:05] wonders will be following your ministry,
[47:07] and you'll be praying for kings and
[47:09] monarchs and so forth." Well, I told him
[47:12] I was a poor man. I had no education. I
[47:15] would not be able to do this job. He
[47:17] said as Moses was given two signs of
[47:20] confirmation of his ministry that I
[47:22] would be given two signs. One would be
[47:24] the praying for the sick the miracles
[47:26] and the other would be you know the very
[47:27] secrets of the people's heart. I told
[47:29] him that I had been praying about this
[47:32] that the people told me that it was of
[47:34] the devil the ministry. He referred to
[47:37] me many scriptures such as when
[47:39] Philillip found Nathaniel and Nathaniel
[47:42] came to Jesus, what Jesus told him where
[47:45] he had been, where he was under the tree
[47:47] when Nathaniel found him. And many other
[47:51] scriptures such as the woman at the
[47:52] well, how that she was revealed her sins
[47:56] to her. When Jesus told her that she had
[47:59] five husbands, she ran into the city and
[48:01] said, "This is the Christ."
[48:04] many other scriptures he referred to.
[48:07] I told him I would go. He gave me the
[48:09] assurance that he would be with me
[48:11] always. As you know, brother Cop, and
[48:13] the world knows of the great things
[48:15] that's been taking place in the
[48:17] ministry.
[48:18] We were thinking about whether these
[48:20] visions I would remember them very long.
[48:22] Some time ago, I had one about four
[48:25] years ago to be exact of a little boy
[48:28] being dead on the side of the road,
[48:30] struck by a car and killed. and he was
[48:33] to be raised from the dead. Well, I told
[48:37] everybody about it. Prophesied
[48:39] throughout the United States and Canada.
[48:41] Thousands of Bibles had it written on
[48:43] their fly leaf that this would take
[48:45] place. One day while we were having
[48:48] campaigns in the Scandinavian country,
[48:50] we were coming down through Finland from
[48:52] Kovio and there was a group of people
[48:55] gathered on the side of the road. They
[48:57] were hovered over some sort of a farm.
[49:00] We got out to look. There it was, the
[49:02] little boy. Everything has seen just the
[49:05] way it was shown to me. I said to
[49:07] brother Moore, "Look at your Bible and
[49:08] see if this isn't the scene." "Yes," he
[49:10] said. I knelt down and asked our Lord
[49:12] Jesus to confirm his word that he had
[49:15] showed me and had told me would come to
[49:17] pass. The little boy was brought to life
[49:20] again by our Lord Jesus. He's alive and
[49:23] healthy today. Brother Cop, this is just
[49:26] a few of the things that our Lord Jesus
[49:28] is doing today in the ministry that he
[49:30] has committed to me. To my humble
[49:33] opinion is to confirm his word, the
[49:37] things that he promised that would
[49:38] happen in this day we are seeing them
[49:40] take place today.
[49:44] Now, concerning the campaigns in Israel,
[49:46] Brother Cop, I'll be very happy to serve
[49:49] our Lord in Israel.
[49:52] I believe that my ministry will be very
[49:54] effective to the Jews because as the
[49:57] scripture says, the Jews seek signs, the
[50:00] Greeks wisdom. We believe many Jews and
[50:02] others there in the Holy Land will come
[50:05] to believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[50:07] the Messiah when they see a Christian
[50:10] fulfilling the prophecy of Joel in the
[50:12] Old Testament.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Cop, I'm sure that you're
[50:16] referring to Joel's prophecy in the Old
[50:18] Testament, Joel 2:28.
[50:21] how that he prophesied, saying that in
[50:24] the last days he would pour out his
[50:26] spirit upon all flesh, the sons and
[50:28] daughters would prophesy. The old man
[50:31] would dream dreams, and the young men
[50:32] would see visions.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I guess we'll
[50:36] have to say goodbye for this time. It
[50:37] certainly has been a great pleasure and
[50:39] very edifying.
[50:41] We'll have to be running along, but we
[50:42] will see you, God willing, in Chicago in
[50:44] the next couple of days.
[50:47] Well, gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to
[50:49] have you in our home tonight. We'll be
[50:52] praying together for the success of the
[50:53] Chicago meeting. And by God's grace, I
[50:56] hope to meet you there in the next few
[50:57] days.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Would you care for some tea before
[51:02] going?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you very much, Mr. B. That'll
[51:05] be just fine.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Thanks, honey.
[51:15] Now to you who believe, the angel of God
[51:19] who has been sent to me to help you to
[51:23] believe Jesus Christ is not two foot
[51:25] from where I'm standing right now.
[51:28] If you believe me to be his servant, you
[51:30] shall take my word. I can't make you
[51:33] believe it. You only have to believe it.
[51:35] He's here now
[51:38] at the platform.
[51:41] Now the Lord bless you while I talk to
[51:43] the woman. Everyone be in prayer. These
[51:45] are sick people. Now if this lady says
[51:48] that she is a stranger to me. I never
[51:51] seen her in my life. No way at all of
[51:52] knowing her any way at all. Now I could
[51:55] not heal her no more than I could save
[51:57] her. And you know I couldn't do that.
[52:00] But Jesus Christ has already did all of
[52:03] that when he died at Calvary. But he
[52:05] sent gifts into his church. Is that
[52:07] right? Say amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And the gifts are to what? edify the
[52:12] church. Is that right? In other words,
[52:14] they see believers, unbelievers, come in
[52:16] and say, "Truly, the Bible said, "If you
[52:18] all speak with tongues and there come in
[52:20] the unbelievers, well, they'll say
[52:22] you're mad. But if there be one prophesy
[52:24] and reveal the secrets of the heart,
[52:27] then won't that unbeliever fall down and
[52:28] say, "Truly, God is with you."
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. All right. You
[52:34] believe now with all your heart that
[52:36] Jesus Christ, the son of God, is here
[52:39] now to perform and to do the things that
[52:42] he promised he would do. Lady, I just
[52:45] want to talk to you as and the the
[52:49] reason I'm doing this is to contact your
[52:52] spirit.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Will you believe with all your heart?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And if God will just reveal to me what
[52:58] is wrong with you, will you accept him
[53:01] as your healer? You would. Now, we are
[53:04] strangers, I suppose. Are we never seen
[53:07] each other in life? Nowhere. But God
[53:10] knows what's wrong with you. Isn't that
[53:12] right?
[53:13] You're one of your greatest saints.
[53:15] You're an evil also. Isn't that right?
[53:18] You believe that God will make you well,
[53:21] Lord Jesus. I pray that you'll heal the
[53:24] woman. Make her well. Father, may she go
[53:26] from here tonight and be made completely
[53:29] whole. In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it.
[53:32] Amen. Now go read rejoicing pray. Now
[53:36] that's according to your faith sister.
[53:38] See he never told me one thing. Just
[53:40] said what was wrong with you. Watch what
[53:41] he says. See what he tells you that you
[53:44] do. Now that's totally up to you. See
[53:47] you believe it. He said you'd accept it.
[53:49] Now he talk at your word. You take him
[53:51] at his word. Go testify the same. You'll
[53:53] get what? Amen. Let's say thanks be to
[53:57] God.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] I'm trust that God is blessing you all
[54:04] out there now to where you can't
[54:07] disbelieve any longer. It would be a a a
[54:11] sin for you to disbelieve now
[54:15] after God had sent his son
[54:18] and has performed this thing that he
[54:20] speaks of now
[54:23] and has done all these signs and you
[54:26] have sent his Bible, sent his preachers,
[54:29] sent his gifts and you still
[54:30] disbelieving, there's nothing left for
[54:32] you but to be condemned at the end. Is
[54:35] that right?
[54:36] But the only thing this is to do is to
[54:39] glorify God and to reveal
[54:42] Jesus Christ.
[54:45] That when he was here on earth, he did
[54:47] this very same thing.
[54:50] All Bible readers believe that, say,
[54:52] amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And he said, "When I go away and I'll
[54:56] come again a little while, and the world
[54:57] will see me no more." That's the
[54:59] unbelievers. But ye shall see me, who?
[55:02] The believers. For I'll be with you,
[55:04] even in you to the end of the world. Is
[55:08] that true?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Then it's sin to disbelieve.
[55:12] Go ye and sin no more or disbelieve no
[55:15] more or worse thing than this will come
[55:17] upon you, said Jesus. Is that true?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Then we must believe. It's got to be a
[55:23] belief or perish.
[55:26] If I was God, if they couldn't take my
[55:28] word for it, that would settle it. But
[55:31] people still don't take the word, then
[55:33] signs and wonders are added into the
[55:35] church as Jesus Christ promised to do.
[55:38] And to my honest belief, I believe he's
[55:40] finishing up right now with the Gentiles
[55:42] and we'll turn to the Jews right away.
[55:45] And the Gentiles will be left in their
[55:47] dogmas and the things that they got,
[55:49] their creeds and cold formal
[55:51] denominations, and the church will be
[55:52] raptured and tuck up and the gospel will
[55:54] go to the Jews.
[55:56] Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen means so be it.
[56:01] All right. Excuse me, sister. Have to
[56:04] relax my mind once in a while. Now, we
[56:06] are these strangers. I see that you are
[56:09] strictly a stranger to me. Yes, sir.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; You're from away from here. Yes, sir.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; You come from another city. Yes, sir.
[56:17] You've got a lot of trouble on your
[56:18] heart. You got hard trouble to begin
[56:20] with. Is that right? There's a whole lot
[56:24] of blackness. I see a black sheet keep
[56:26] following you like that. Oh, it's a lie.
[56:28] Somebody stole a lie on you. And that
[56:31] was a man was professing divine healing.
[56:33] Yes, sir.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; He said you was a witch. Is that true?
[56:37] And you got a holster in your church or
[56:39] something about it. Isn't that right?
[56:40] Your pastor's sick right now. You got
[56:42] polio. Is that right, sister? Don't pay
[56:45] no attention to what them people tell
[56:46] you. They're a lion. And the only
[56:48] thing's wrong with your heart's that
[56:50] nervous condition got your heart worked
[56:51] up. Go on home in peace. And God bless
[56:54] you. You're all right. God bless you.
[56:55] You're not all right.
[56:59] You believe with all your heart, believe
[57:01] God will heal you that even leave you
[57:02] make you well.
[57:04] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll heal the
[57:07] woman and may she get completely whole.
[57:09] I ask this blessing in Jesus Christ's
[57:11] name. Amen. Go on your road rejoicing
[57:14] saying thank you Lord and you'll get
[57:16] well. Come ladies. Almighty God, author
[57:19] of life, give this woman her perfect
[57:20] health in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God
[57:23] bless you. Just a minute.
[57:27] Something happened to you. You know
[57:28] that. You're aware of that. Is that
[57:29] right?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Why? It's all over the building. And
[57:32] every person here can be healed right
[57:34] now if you believe it.
[57:36] You believe this?
[57:39] Have faith in God.
[57:42] Are you one of the ushers, sir? All
[57:44] right, sir.
[57:46] That lady sitting right there got heart
[57:48] trouble. That speckled dress on. Stand
[57:50] up, lady. He just healed. You didn't
[57:51] have that heart trouble.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart?
[57:56] All right. There sets a lady there with
[57:58] her handkerchief up crying. Just had a
[58:00] lick on the head the other day. She's
[58:02] got a headache. It's calling it. Is that
[58:03] right? Stand up and accept your healing
[58:05] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. How may
[58:08] the rest of you want to accept your
[58:10] healing? Jesus Christ is right here now
[58:12] to heal you. Do you believe that? All
[58:14] that wants to be healed, stand to your
[58:15] feet right now. Every person in the
[58:17] building who wants to be healed, stand
[58:19] to your feet.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands like this to God.
[58:23] Almighty God, the author of life, the
[58:25] giver of every good gift, as our spirit
[58:28] is here tonight, I pray that you'll heal
[58:31] every person in this building, thy ear,
[58:34] the Holy Spirit is here. And I now as
[58:38] your servant along with these other
[58:39] servants, curse every disease that's in
[58:41] here. May the Jesus Christ, the son of
[58:44] God, heal every person in here. Satan,
[58:47] leave these people in Jesus Christ's
[58:50] name. Now let the people got their hands
[58:52] up say praise God and glory rejoice.
[59:13] God bless you.
[59:16] I just hope that this little
[59:22] demonstration
[59:23] of the Holy Spirit
[59:26] that you can see the reality
[59:29] of how that it transplant
[59:33] how it happened and how it took place
[59:37] and that you see that the simplicity
[59:41] of God and the way that it was and how
[59:46] that he did things and what that it was
[59:49] supposed to do. It never was his
[59:52] intention for any vain glory to fall
[59:58] upon him or his ministry as he would say
[1:00:02] it. But that we might see in that Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ was the same yesterday,
[1:00:10] today, and forever. And you'll see the
[1:00:14] mannerism and how that the nature of
[1:00:21] how that he did things and how that it
[1:00:24] lifted him up and what it did for him.
[1:00:29] And
[1:00:31] in doing so
[1:00:33] that you could see
[1:00:37] the person
[1:00:40] and the personality
[1:00:43] and the simplicity
[1:00:46] of God's word
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:50] what that it does
[1:00:53] for those
[1:00:55] that serve him and that we'll never
[1:00:58] forget. get that,
[1:01:01] you know, we sometimes
[1:01:03] think that things ought to be so
[1:01:06] fantastic and and you know that the
[1:01:10] supernatural is some big great
[1:01:15] thing. But yet that was
[1:01:18] the fulfillment
[1:01:21] of Malachi 4:5
[1:01:23] and Luke 17:30
[1:01:26] and Revelations
[1:01:29] 10:7.
[1:01:30] And we look for great men
[1:01:35] to do great things and mighty exploits.
[1:01:41] And yet the mighty exploits of the Lord
[1:01:45] were so simple.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And so I hope that that sets a tone
[1:01:53] for you in your hearts and that you'll
[1:01:56] see and you'll see the great things that
[1:02:00] God did and the simplicity
[1:02:03] that he did them in and the way that he
[1:02:07] did them. and we find out that it's so
[1:02:13] humble
[1:02:14] and I wanted to bring that back to our
[1:02:19] memory
[1:02:20] and to our membrance and so that that
[1:02:25] the spirit of it, the reality of it and
[1:02:28] the greatness of it would be so sweet
[1:02:33] to us and and that The humidility
[1:02:41] of it was so great and I didn't want us
[1:02:47] to forget this and that it would be
[1:02:52] always
[1:02:55] revalent to us and that we wouldn't
[1:02:59] forget
[1:03:00] the way
[1:03:02] of a true prophet. So I just ask that we
[1:03:06] did this this evening so that you would
[1:03:10] be blessed and that you would remember
[1:03:13] that. And then this Sunday evening,
[1:03:18] we'll go back and we'll pick up that
[1:03:22] meeting and those ministry and how that
[1:03:25] that gift unfolded
[1:03:27] and how things were done and how simple
[1:03:30] that they were done and what wonderful
[1:03:34] order what they were done in. and that
[1:03:38] we won't forget
[1:03:42] how this ministry
[1:03:45] was revealed to us
[1:03:48] and the simplicity of it and the power
[1:03:52] of it and it might quicken to us how
[1:03:57] these things were performed.
[1:04:01] So once again, we'd like to remind you
[1:04:06] of the simplicity
[1:04:09] and the vindication and the simplicity
[1:04:12] of what God
[1:04:15] had done in our day. So we played this
[1:04:19] for you tonight that it would be a
[1:04:22] blessing and we hope that we'd be
[1:04:24] brought to your remembrance. So Lord
[1:04:29] richly bless you and and
[1:04:33] let us
[1:04:35] uh remember these things and let's put
[1:04:39] them on our heart and let's remember the
[1:04:42] great word of God. So let us go ahead
[1:04:44] and stand this evening. God bless you
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:50] I hope that you enjoyed
[1:04:54] uh the humility
[1:04:57] and the fellowship
[1:04:59] and the nature
[1:05:02] of the message
[1:05:05] that was brought forth.
[1:05:07] Not a lot of
[1:05:10] big
[1:05:12] seemingly
[1:05:15] wildness or or emotional or or
[1:05:21] everything. It was just what God said
[1:05:24] and what God does.
[1:05:28] And I hope that it'll help you
[1:05:31] understand
[1:05:32] that it was with humility
[1:05:36] that God revealed
[1:05:39] his word.
[1:05:41] And then, you know, even when we begin
[1:05:45] to see God do the works that he did,
[1:05:50] that we'll always remember that Jesus
[1:05:53] Christ is revealed in the simplicity
[1:05:57] of the word of God. And you'll begin to
[1:06:01] see again how wonderful
[1:06:04] God was and fulfilling
[1:06:08] his visions and
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:16] and that that'll always be our portion.
[1:06:20] Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:06:25] today,
[1:06:26] and forever.
[1:06:28] Amen. Brother Billy, he'll come and
[1:06:33] then he'll
[1:06:35] lead us in worship and lead us in the
[1:06:39] things that we've seen. And then
[1:06:43] this coming
[1:06:48] week, we will see more of the great
[1:06:53] simplicity
[1:06:55] of God's word.
[1:06:57] So Lord, richly bless you. May you enjoy
[1:07:00] the simplicity
[1:07:02] and trust that the big fantastics
[1:07:08] never did much
[1:07:12] for God's word. But the humility, the
[1:07:15] simplicity
[1:07:17] of God's word, the way of a true prophet
[1:07:22] and the way that he truly did things and
[1:07:28] those things will be wonderfully
[1:07:32] brought before you. God bless you.
[1:07:40] Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Keep me true,
[1:07:51] gloriously
[1:07:53] Jesus.
[1:07:55] Keep me true.
[1:08:01] Oh, keep me true,
[1:08:06] Lord Jesus.
[1:08:09] Keep me true.
[1:08:14] Oh, and there a race that I must run.
[1:08:23] There are victories
[1:08:26] to be won.

[1:08:34] hour
[1:08:36] to be true. Sing that again. Oh,
[1:08:42] and keep me true.
[1:08:46] Oh
[1:08:48] Jesus,
[1:08:50] keep me. Is that your heart desire?
[1:08:54] Oh,
[1:08:56] and keep me true.
[1:09:00] Lord
[1:09:02] Jesus,
[1:09:03] keep me true.
[1:09:09] Oh, and there a race that I must run.
[1:09:17] There are victories
[1:09:20] to be won. Oh, give me power
[1:09:27] every
[1:09:29] hour to

[1:09:55] that I do
[1:09:59] will be pleasing
[1:10:03] to you.
[1:10:06] Oh, praise.
[1:10:12] Oh, and let everything
[1:10:16] I
[1:10:17] pursue
[1:10:20] will be pleased.
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] Lord
[1:10:27] to you. Sing it again tonight.
[1:10:32] Oh
[1:10:34] pleasing.
[1:10:38] Oh, let me be pleasing
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:44] to you.
[1:10:47] Let everything
[1:10:50] that I do, oh be pleasing
[1:10:58] to you.
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:01] Oh, praise.
[1:11:06] Oh, let everything
[1:11:10] I pursue
[1:11:14] be pleasing
[1:11:18] Lord
[1:11:21] to you.
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:26] Emmanuel,
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:39] holy
[1:11:40] savior is strong.
[1:11:46] Oh man,
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:53] God
[1:11:55] with us.
[1:11:58] Oh,
[1:12:02] [Music]
[1:12:06] his name is
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:12] Oh, Imagine.
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:45] All his son will come.
[1:12:52] Oh,
[1:12:59] his name is.
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen is our example to
[1:13:13] follow. Amen. We've seen him manifested
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:17] the scripture as the disciples will say
[1:13:20] that which was spoken and that which was
[1:13:23] in the beginning and said that we have
[1:13:24] seen light manifested and and we've lay
[1:13:28] our hands on it and we've seen it come
[1:13:30] to pass. I believe us in this generation
[1:13:33] can say the same thing. We've seen those
[1:13:36] things that were spoken in the Bibles
[1:13:39] and come to pass and we've laid our eyes
[1:13:41] on it and we've seen it. We've read it.
[1:13:44] We know that God is not is the same. He
[1:13:47] hasn't changed at all. Amen. But Andrew,
[1:13:50] if you could just come and dismiss us
[1:13:52] tonight. Amen. That's our heart's
[1:13:54] desire.
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:07] So glad we can be together again. And
[1:14:10] isn't it wonderful how faithful God is
[1:14:12] to give us that spiritual food in due
[1:14:15] season? You know, I remember
[1:14:20] when I first come into the way and
[1:14:22] things were difficult, you know, trying
[1:14:24] to share the message with somebody I
[1:14:26] love so dear. And I just remember, you
[1:14:30] know, sometimes we as human beings,
[1:14:32] we're trying to convey the message to
[1:14:34] somebody, but I just remember at some
[1:14:37] point I just said, "You know what,
[1:14:38] honey?" This is my wife. I said, "Why
[1:14:40] don't you just look at the video?" And,
[1:14:42] you know, it was very special because,
[1:14:45] you know, we see ourselves and we're
[1:14:47] short many times, but I I thank God that
[1:14:50] it's been recorded, not just audio, but
[1:14:53] we can see his mannerisms. We can see
[1:14:55] his genuiness and his care. And that is
[1:14:58] a great example of the life. And you
[1:15:01] know, like I said, though we feel short,
[1:15:03] but we saw one come to maturity.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And so we got our eyes set on the prize,
[1:15:08] the very life of Christ manifested.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to just short change
[1:15:14] where we're at now because the potential
[1:15:17] is inside of us. And so when we look at
[1:15:20] that, we recognize he run his race. But
[1:15:23] the same God that led him to the full
[1:15:26] maturity is going to lead you and me.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy? I'm so grateful.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Heavenly Father,
[1:15:35] Lord, how we thank you for the burden of
[1:15:38] a pastor, Lord, to help us to look back
[1:15:42] and recognize
[1:15:44] the pure word life in the seed that had
[1:15:49] come to expression. Lord, it does
[1:15:52] something to our hearts. Lord, it
[1:15:54] pulsates a a faith to know that you're
[1:15:57] going to do the same for us. Lord, if
[1:16:00] we'll just continue to pray and read our
[1:16:03] Bibles and experience the challenges and
[1:16:06] the trials,
[1:16:08] knowing that, oh God, we'll overcome by
[1:16:11] promise. Lord, I I look back at the
[1:16:14] testimonies of the life of your servant,
[1:16:17] Prophet William Brandom. How you brought
[1:16:19] him through so much, so many trials,
[1:16:22] very difficult, Lord. And to come to the
[1:16:25] place where what he displayed, Lord. It
[1:16:27] wasn't just an overnight
[1:16:30] deal, but Father, it was test after
[1:16:33] test, trial after trial, Lord. And you
[1:16:36] proved out, oh God, that you keep your
[1:16:38] word, Lord. encourage your children
[1:16:41] tonight, Lord, with this reality, Lord,
[1:16:43] that not only are you a promise giver,
[1:16:46] but you're a promise keeper, Lord. Lord,
[1:16:49] as we rejoice in what we've seen and
[1:16:52] heard tonight, Lord, may you go with us,
[1:16:55] Lord. And may our oh God vision not
[1:16:59] shrink down because of the world's
[1:17:01] circumstance and even our current
[1:17:02] conditions Lord but may there just be a
[1:17:05] deep settled peace that you'll bring us
[1:17:07] to that expected end that you promised.
[1:17:09] We're praying for your believing
[1:17:11] children tonight as we go Lord pray
[1:17:14] you'd go with them. Father I'm
[1:17:16] remembering even now an urgent request
[1:17:19] God for our brother John and his mother,
[1:17:23] our sister Diane. Lord, you know the
[1:17:26] condition and the circumstance, but
[1:17:28] we're just looking to you, Lord, that
[1:17:30] those stripes that you bore and the
[1:17:32] blood that you shed would effectually
[1:17:34] work on their behalf. Lord, bless their
[1:17:37] home, Lord. Bless us all together, Lord,
[1:17:40] that we can be united and unified under
[1:17:42] this one voice, Lord, in Jesus Christ's
[1:17:46] name. Amen.
[1:17:50] Amen. God bless you at this place
[1:17:52] tonight. Oh, let the weak say I am
[1:17:58] strong.
[1:18:00] Let the bold say I am brave.
[1:18:05] Oh, let the blind say I can see. Oh, and
[1:18:11] what the Lord
[1:18:14] has done.
[1:18:16] Oh, and let the we say I am strong. Oh,
[1:18:23] let the Lord say I am rich.
[1:18:29] Oh, let the blind say I can. Oh, and
[1:18:35] what the Lord has done.
[1:18:40] Ohana
