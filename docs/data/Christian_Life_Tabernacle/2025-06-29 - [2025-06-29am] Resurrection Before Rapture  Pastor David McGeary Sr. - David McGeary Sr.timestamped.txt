[33:28] prayed and all of the sudden Zakius

[33:38] could pray this morning and whatever the
[33:40] case is he will go to work. Amen. and he
[33:43] will make sure that there will be now

[33:56] health, whatever it is, and finance,
[33:59] it's the same God this morning that's
[34:01] here. And he promised he will answer to
[34:03] every need of the believers when we come
[34:05] asking the brothers that are taking the
[34:07] offerings. If you could come this
[34:09] morning. Amen.
[34:12] Amen. Brother Jonathan, if you could
[34:14] just come and take these saints before
[34:15] the church,
[34:21] [Music]
[34:28] [Music]
[34:30] let us all pray.
[34:33] Gracious heavenly father,
[34:36] Lord God, it's a privilege, Lord God,
[34:39] for us to be here this morning,
[34:42] not only in fellowship, Lord God, with
[34:44] you, but in communion and fellowship
[34:47] around your word, Lord God, and the
[34:50] saints of God, heavenly father, Lord
[34:52] God, we've come with expectation, Lord
[34:54] God, this morning
[34:56] to draw a little closer, heavenly
[34:58] father, to you and Lord God, to make our
[35:01] wrongs right, heavenly Father, and draw
[35:04] strength, Lord God, from you. And
[35:06] heavenly father, Lord God, you have
[35:08] heard each request, Lord God, you've
[35:10] seen each need, Lord God, that's on each
[35:12] heart, Lord, and the uplifted hand. And
[35:15] there's a variety, Lord God, of
[35:17] situations, Lord God, as our brother
[35:18] indicated. Uh several folks are out and
[35:22] we're trusting, Lord God, for traveling
[35:24] grace and mercy and administering, Lord
[35:26] God, to each one. and but for those that
[35:28] are here, heavenly father, Lord God, we
[35:30] just know that the the word can deliver
[35:32] and set free and and heal and conquer
[35:36] and Lord God, just smooth our pathways,
[35:39] Lord God, to what you would have in
[35:41] store for us. And that's what we're
[35:43] asking for, Lord God, this morning.
[35:45] That's our expectation,
[35:47] Lord God, this morning. And I just pray
[35:50] there'd be a confirmation, Heavenly
[35:51] Father, Lord God, that will come through
[35:53] and uh raise our faith, Heavenly Father.
[35:56] and just love you so very much, Lord
[35:58] God, for all that you've done for us.
[36:00] And uh tithes and offerings, Lord God,
[36:03] that would be taken up, Lord God, this
[36:05] morning, Lord God. You know exactly,
[36:07] Lord God, how to direct it, Lord, and
[36:09] multiply it, Lord, for the upbuilding of
[36:12] your kingdom, heavenly father. And we
[36:13] just commit it all into your precious
[36:15] hands, the remainder of uh our song
[36:18] service, Lord God, this morning. We just
[36:20] want to commit this entire service,
[36:22] Lord. All that would be done. May it be
[36:25] done. Heavenly Father, for the
[36:26] upbuilding of your kingdom, we just love
[36:28] you, Lord God, this morning and commit
[36:30] these things to you. In the name of
[36:32] Jesus Christ, we ask and pray. Amen.
[36:38] In my knees,
[36:41] you pay the price for me. And through
[36:45] your love, I have been set free.

[43:20] heaven
[43:22] and that the world would know that you
[43:25] live.
[43:29] We just ask that you would bless us this
[43:32] morning,
[43:34] be with us and help us
[43:37] as we
[43:39] just share your word this morning.
[43:42] Father, our visitors that are amongst us
[43:44] this morning, Father, may they not be
[43:48] strangers to you this morning.
[43:53] Though they may not know me or may be
[43:55] the first time they've entered this
[43:57] building,
[43:59] Father, may they be acquainted with the
[44:01] life of your resurrection.
[44:05] May they be acquainted with you, Lord
[44:08] Jesus, as their personal savior. And
[44:12] may in the presence of your Holy Spirit,
[44:15] may they feel at home. And may they know
[44:18] they're part of that great universal
[44:20] body of the Lord Jesus,
[44:23] that they're a part of the resurrection
[44:25] that's to come. and
[44:28] and may they feel at home with your arms
[44:32] wrapped around them and your love
[44:34] surrounding them. May they know that
[44:37] though they're from some other place
[44:39] that you're ever present and you can
[44:43] answer their requests this morning
[44:46] because you're the same yesterday,
[44:48] today, and forever.
[44:50] Father, we're sorry for our sins. We're
[44:53] sorry for our shortcomings.
[44:56] We're sorry that we're not
[44:59] what we ought to be. But Lord, we know
[45:02] what we're not. We're not what we used
[45:04] to be either.
[45:06] And we're grateful for that. Continue to
[45:09] move us forward. We ask it in Jesus
[45:13] precious and wonderful name we pray.
[45:16] Amen. And amen. God bless you this
[45:19] morning. It's nice to be in the house of
[45:21] the Lord. I I know there's a a lot out.
[45:25] Um but um that's good everybody vacation
[45:30] time. So some people go, some people
[45:32] come. But I'm glad he's everywhere.
[45:36] Aren't you? That I think that's what's
[45:38] so beautiful. And uh so we um this last
[45:43] week um I I know they may announced it,
[45:47] but uh brother Greg St. Hillary passed
[45:51] away. And so we want to keep his wife
[45:53] Judy in prayer um as she goes through
[45:57] this time. And then also, Brother Joseph
[46:00] Frank lost his sister uh one of the twin
[46:03] sisters. She was here visiting with us
[46:05] and and I because she had pneumonia and
[46:09] she passed away. And so we want to
[46:11] remember their family in prayer. Uh we
[46:15] know they were believers. So alls they
[46:18] did was left this world for another
[46:21] world. And we're grateful for that this
[46:24] morning. So we we um uh want to this
[46:29] morning turn in our Bibles
[46:33] um to two scriptures. Uh they're very
[46:36] familiar scriptures. We read them uh
[46:40] quite often. Um and uh the one is
[46:45] founded in uh Romans 8 and 11 and I
[46:51] think most of us have uh that one
[46:54] memorized. Um but it it's absolutely a
[46:59] cornerstone scripture.
[47:02] And then we'll read in Revelations
[47:05] 17 and 18.
[47:08] It says, "But if the spirit of him that
[47:12] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[47:16] you,
[47:18] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[47:21] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[47:26] his spirit that dwelleth in you."
[47:31] And just to make this, I want you to
[47:34] understand that the resurrection isn't
[47:38] something
[47:39] apart from you,
[47:42] right? It's the spirit that is in you is
[47:46] resurrection.
[47:48] So we want to try to break down some old
[47:51] mental thinkings that have been put in
[47:54] us for years and years and years. you
[47:58] know, uh, a a lot of times people are
[48:02] taught things uh that aren't true and
[48:06] uh, you know, and uh, and then somebody
[48:10] has to come along and bring the truth
[48:13] and then you've got to make the decision
[48:16] between what you've heard and what
[48:17] you've heard.
[48:19] And so that's how um uh we're saying so
[48:25] a lot of people look at the resurrection
[48:28] as something that's coming.
[48:32] Okay? But if that spirit's in you, it
[48:36] will quicken you. So if I had a title
[48:38] this morning, I would call it
[48:41] resurrection before rapture.
[48:44] and and we'll explain that uh try to
[48:48] also let's read in uh the book of uh uh
[48:53] revelations
[48:55] the first chapter in the 17th and 18th
[48:59] verse book of revelations
[49:03] the first chapter
[49:08] and I always go up a verse you know my I
[49:11] just got that problem I start reading
[49:13] the Bible backwards.
[49:15] Uh because it's life whether you read it
[49:18] forwards or backwards, right? You can
[49:20] even read it sideways
[49:23] and it'll bless you. You know what I
[49:25] mean? You could read verse five and say,
[49:28] "And from Jesus Christ, who is faithful
[49:31] witness, the first begotten of the dead
[49:35] and the prince of kings of the earth.
[49:38] Let him that love us and washed us from
[49:42] our sins with his own blood. And then
[49:44] you could go over to the 13th verse and
[49:47] read that verse. And then you could go
[49:48] over to the second verse. I don't care
[49:50] how you read the Bible. It's food is
[49:54] life. So uh and this is John was
[49:58] speaking as he seen the vision of the
[50:00] Lord Jesus. And and he said
[50:06] and he said and he had in his hand seven
[50:09] stars and out of the mouth went a sharp
[50:12] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[50:17] as the sun shining in his strength. And
[50:21] when I saw him, I fell at his feet
[50:26] as dead. And he laid his hands upon me,
[50:30] saying, "Fear not. I am the first and
[50:34] the last. I am he that liveth and was
[50:39] dead, and behold, I am alive forever
[50:44] more. Amen. And have the keys of hell
[50:48] and of death." Gracious heavenly father,
[50:52] we ask you to bless your word in Jesus
[50:55] precious name we pray. Amen. God bless
[50:57] you. You may be seated this morning.
[51:02] I I'd like to this morning uh and uh um
[51:08] I I know it's hard because
[51:11] uh uh we have many different languages
[51:15] in the church and uh some uh speak
[51:20] English uh fluently, some it's their
[51:24] second language, some speak English in
[51:28] broken English and
[51:31] that that's just perfectly fine. Uh God
[51:35] doesn't listen to your voice as much as
[51:37] he listens to your heart.
[51:40] And if you So he he knows what's on the
[51:44] inside and he knows what your desire is
[51:46] and he knows what you lack. So, I know
[51:50] when we play sections of a sermon, I
[51:55] know for those of you maybe that have to
[51:59] listen through the interpreter,
[52:01] uh it's difficult, but I I'm a firm
[52:05] believer that the anointing is on the
[52:08] tapes. And and though you may not be
[52:13] able to understand it straight as it's
[52:16] spoken, I know that the spirit of God
[52:19] bears witness with your spirit. And uh I
[52:23] I've been in spiritfilled meetings where
[52:27] uh people were worshiping in languages I
[52:31] didn't know and and preaching in
[52:33] languages I didn't know. But I knew he
[52:36] was there and I knew that he was here
[52:40] and I felt at home. So I I pray that you
[52:43] feel a little at home today even though
[52:46] and and uh another thing I I know that
[52:52] uh we always have some people that are
[52:54] cold and we always have some people that
[52:56] are hot. And so I think we're going to
[52:59] try to raise the temperature a little
[53:02] bit in the future. And I I would rather
[53:05] be hot than cold. How many would rather
[53:07] be hot than cold? Well, that's the
[53:10] scripture.
[53:13] All right. So, we we certainly don't
[53:15] want any uh lukewarm believers, right?
[53:20] So, let's get on fire for the gospel.
[53:24] I'd like to read a few statements and so
[53:26] you can understand this morning. Um, so,
[53:31] um, I was going to title this sermon
[53:34] different, but I I I didn't want to make
[53:39] any
[53:41] disrespect, but um, you know,
[53:47] I was going to call this sermon, eat the
[53:51] cake,
[53:53] and it come to me. I was fellowshipping
[53:56] with Matt Thomasac and we were talking
[53:59] about and we've been preaching here for
[54:02] a while, right? We want to go forward,
[54:05] right? Isn't that another I I know where
[54:08] I'm at, but I want to go further down
[54:11] the road. I want to be uh I I want to be
[54:17] more filled with the spirit. I want to
[54:20] be more led by him. And I I want to have
[54:26] uh an uncction. Every believer should
[54:29] have a holy uncction in him. And and
[54:34] that uncction is what I believe the
[54:38] prophet of God is going to refer to as
[54:41] we listen to here as the spark of the
[54:46] believer. That the believer has got to
[54:49] have the spark. And I feel that
[54:54] and I I'll point this to myself. I feel
[54:57] that in order for me to go forward,
[55:01] um I I I'm going to have something that
[55:06] ignites me, something that moves me,
[55:10] something that stirs me up. Uh Peter
[55:13] preaching, he said, "Stir up their pure
[55:16] hearts by way of remembrance." In other
[55:19] words, bring them bring them to life and
[55:22] and that every minute would count. You
[55:27] know, when you're young, you think you
[55:29] got all the future in the world. Then
[55:31] one morning you slip out of bed and you
[55:33] step and one of your knees wobbles and
[55:36] and your back's aching and you you make
[55:39] it in there and you throw water on your
[55:41] face and you look in the mirror and all
[55:44] of a sudden you realize you're bald,
[55:48] you know, and uh uh you you realize you
[55:51] don't you go to open a bottle cap and
[55:54] you think, "Well, who in the world put
[55:55] this bottle cap on here?" You know, they
[55:58] they did that on purpose.
[56:01] You know what I mean? And and so now you
[56:04] run to the cupboard because you got this
[56:06] thing that you squeeze and open the
[56:08] bottle caps, you know, and uh and
[56:11] everything becomes more difficult, you
[56:15] know. Uh, I always like it when people
[56:17] call me because when when when
[56:21] uh they text me and I try to text back,
[56:24] it takes me 10 minutes to say a text
[56:26] because every time I type the thing
[56:28] changes my words.
[56:31] And so there's a lot of things, you
[56:33] know, that life life is passing by and
[56:36] when you come to a certain time, you
[56:38] realize you don't have all the time.
[56:42] You know what? I I mean, you know, uh
[56:45] and then you think, well, what am I
[56:47] going to do with the time that I've got
[56:52] left? You know, how am I going to put it
[56:54] to use? What am I going to do with my
[56:56] life? And and I think we all want to be
[56:59] that way. We want to know how can I live
[57:03] more for the Lord Jesus Christ and do
[57:06] something for the kingdom of God?
[57:08] Because we want to separate. There's
[57:10] believers that believe, but they're do
[57:13] nothings.
[57:15] You you know what I mean? And and if we
[57:18] we talk about separating from believer,
[57:21] make believer and unbeliever. Well,
[57:23] unbelievers, they don't want to do
[57:25] anything for the gospel. The makeel
[57:27] believer, he believes and and says, "I
[57:30] believe the gospel. I believe what's
[57:32] preached." But he does nothing. He's a
[57:35] do nothing. And then there's the
[57:38] believers and he's a doer because the
[57:41] scripture says be a a not only be a
[57:45] hearer of the word, the makebeliever,
[57:48] but be a doer of the word, the believer.
[57:52] And so I I I the works that I want to do
[57:57] are the works that he did.
[58:01] Is that right? And I can't do the works
[58:05] that he did. Only by him. I can do the
[58:09] works that he did. So it's really it's
[58:13] not us that wants to do the works. We
[58:16] want to be the vessels that he's
[58:19] dwelling in that he does the works by.
[58:24] And and so and I I believe that what his
[58:28] his motives and objectives have never
[58:31] changed. His purpose for coming has
[58:35] never changed. His purpose for
[58:37] resurrecting has never changed. And
[58:40] that's why he sent them out into the
[58:43] world and gave them a commission. He
[58:45] said, "Go into all the world and preach
[58:48] the gospel."
[58:50] So one now that commission uh people
[58:54] came and said, "Well, that was just for
[58:56] the disciples." But Peter said on the
[58:59] day of Pentecost and when they came out
[59:02] of the upper room fulfilled with the
[59:05] dude with power to carry out the
[59:07] commission the first thing they did is
[59:10] they came out and they begin to preach
[59:12] the gospel
[59:15] and everybody heard them in their own
[59:17] language. So there, if that was the
[59:19] case, then there had to been a lot of
[59:22] people sharing a lot of things. And he
[59:24] said, "These are not drunk as you
[59:26] suppose." But this was what was promised
[59:29] in the scriptures coming to pass. May I
[59:32] say this this morning? There's things
[59:34] that are in the scriptures that were
[59:37] promised for this day that are coming to
[59:40] pass. And the fulfillment of the promise
[59:43] was the spark.
[59:45] Yes, that's right.
[59:47] And so they the the the commission was
[59:53] to go out into the world
[59:56] and preach the gospel and then lay hands
[1:00:00] on the sick and they shall recover. If
[1:00:03] if if they put any deadly thing upon
[1:00:06] you, it will not harm you. Right? If men
[1:00:10] repent, they lay your hands on them,
[1:00:13] baptize them in the name of the Lord
[1:00:15] Jesus Christ. And you begin to
[1:00:18] understand that that's the church went
[1:00:20] out
[1:00:22] based on the fulfillment
[1:00:25] and the revelation of the fulfillment of
[1:00:29] a promise that what he said has
[1:00:32] happened.
[1:00:36] That's that's what that sparked him.
[1:00:39] Go wait. They went and waited. You will
[1:00:42] be endued with power from on high. The
[1:00:45] power came.
[1:00:47] So Peter walked out of there and he he
[1:00:50] simply said, "Silver and gold have we
[1:00:52] none, but that which we have,
[1:00:56] we give you."
[1:01:00] So Christianity has always been based
[1:01:05] upon the believer by the teaching of
[1:01:08] Jesus Christ to freely give what you
[1:01:12] freely received.
[1:01:16] Now
[1:01:18] if we would measure ourselves
[1:01:21] so many of us
[1:01:24] believe
[1:01:26] but we don't participate
[1:01:29] in the part of freely giving
[1:01:35] and that's because of fear and that's a
[1:01:38] hundred sermons right there.
[1:01:42] But we we want to come to the place
[1:01:44] where we can sit there. Okay, you had a
[1:01:46] plan for my life. You've given me a
[1:01:48] commission. You've endued me with power.
[1:01:51] Now I want to perform those things which
[1:01:56] are spoken. And the reason that I I said
[1:02:00] I was going to call it eat the cake
[1:02:03] because we've spent so much time
[1:02:08] preaching the recipe.
[1:02:12] You know what a recipe is? A cake
[1:02:15] recipe. Two eggs. You know what I mean?
[1:02:18] A half cup of oil. You You know what I
[1:02:22] mean? A one cup of cocoa, two cups of
[1:02:26] flour, one
[1:02:30] quarter cube of butter. I always put a
[1:02:32] full cube in, you know. I mean, just a
[1:02:35] some a little bit of baking soda. And
[1:02:37] you mix this together. And you add a
[1:02:39] little water and whip it up and you got
[1:02:41] a and you you got a cake. You got to
[1:02:45] bake the cake. Well, man's just been
[1:02:49] preaching the recipe.
[1:02:53] Okay, they they just keep preaching the
[1:02:56] recipe. You got to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:59] You You got to have two eggs. You've got
[1:03:02] to have oil. You've got to have water.
[1:03:05] You know, you got to heat the oven. You
[1:03:07] got to do this. Did you? And then we
[1:03:09] come to have to a sermon. Did you
[1:03:11] remember to preheat the oven for to to
[1:03:14] 325?
[1:03:16] Then we come back. Did you remember to
[1:03:17] grease the pan? Or are you going to use
[1:03:19] a glass pan? Are you going to use a tin
[1:03:22] pan? Are you going to use a round pan?
[1:03:24] Are you going to use a square pan? And
[1:03:26] we preach the recipe. We preach the
[1:03:28] recipe. We preach the recipe. And then
[1:03:31] people start tweaking the recipe. You
[1:03:34] know, add a little bit of vanilla. Add a
[1:03:36] little bit of cinnamon. Do a little bit
[1:03:38] of this. I found that this is works and
[1:03:41] I found that that works and and but but
[1:03:44] and so and then they they say you got to
[1:03:47] put it in heaven. But nobody eats the
[1:03:50] cake.
[1:03:54] Now the cake of the resurrection is the
[1:03:57] benefits of the resurrection.
[1:04:00] That's right.
[1:04:02] Okay. There's got to come a time in our
[1:04:05] lives where all of us,
[1:04:10] every single one of us knows we're
[1:04:12] called,
[1:04:14] knows we're elected, knows where we're
[1:04:17] children. You say, "Well, I've got sin."
[1:04:19] He forgave those sins. But he's faithful
[1:04:22] and just for you to to forgive your sins
[1:04:25] if you'll confess them before the Lord
[1:04:28] Jesus.
[1:04:31] If you wait upon the Lord,
[1:04:35] he will renew your strength.
[1:04:40] But you got to wait upon him.
[1:04:44] If you if you pray in your closet, he'll
[1:04:47] reward you openly.
[1:04:50] All these principles are all based on
[1:04:54] the fact that we can show and be endued
[1:04:59] with power and do the works that he did.
[1:05:04] That we can do those works also. And
[1:05:07] you've got to put your place. You can't
[1:05:10] sit there and say, "Well, I'm just a I'm
[1:05:13] just a sister." The scripture says
[1:05:15] there's neither male nor female, bond
[1:05:18] nor free, Jew or Greek, but we are all
[1:05:21] Christs and Christ is God's.
[1:05:24] So we we've got to quit eliminating
[1:05:27] ourselves
[1:05:30] out of the program.
[1:05:32] None of us should be uh No, I'm on a
[1:05:36] diet. You know that. I'm proud of
[1:05:38] myself. I've lost 33 pounds. You
[1:05:40] couldn't believe I was that big. But my
[1:05:43] closet told me I was that big.
[1:05:48] But we're not on a spiritual diet.
[1:05:52] We want to take the book and eat it. You
[1:05:56] know what I mean? We want everything
[1:05:58] that's ours. I don't want what's yours,
[1:06:01] but I want what's mine. I want
[1:06:03] everything that's mine. I want every
[1:06:06] promise in the book that's mine. I want
[1:06:10] I want everything that he has for me.
[1:06:12] And when I hear him say, "Fear not,
[1:06:15] little flock. It's the father's good
[1:06:17] pleasure to give you the kingdom." I
[1:06:19] want to sit back and say, "What is that?
[1:06:23] Am I interested in that? Am I hungry for
[1:06:26] that?"
[1:06:28] Or do you? We don't want what the
[1:06:29] world's got. The world's falling apart.
[1:06:35] It's gone mad.
[1:06:41] You know what I mean? People are
[1:06:42] promising things that that can't be
[1:06:45] happened. People always say they don't
[1:06:47] think things through. Anything that
[1:06:49] tickles their ear, I mean, can you
[1:06:51] imagine? You want to fill your church
[1:06:53] up? I I this one preacher, they ask him,
[1:06:56] he he's got a very gigantic church, you
[1:06:58] know, a mega church. They ask him, "How
[1:07:00] come you're so popular?" You know what
[1:07:02] his answer was? We don't preach against
[1:07:04] sin.
[1:07:11] Yeah. Well, I was a Catholic.
[1:07:14] We even had a better program. You could
[1:07:18] sin all you want, then Saturday, go tell
[1:07:20] the priest all your sins. He'd forgive
[1:07:22] you and you could start all over again.
[1:07:27] They never tried to get a sinless life.
[1:07:30] Well, you can't get a sinless life,
[1:07:34] but he gave you a promise,
[1:07:38] right? That I'll endure you with power
[1:07:40] and fire. I'll send my spirit on you.
[1:07:43] I'll become one with you. I'll fill you
[1:07:46] with my spirit and I will take the
[1:07:48] desire away from you to sin.
[1:07:53] Now, our flesh wars against the spirit
[1:07:56] and our flesh many times fails us. But
[1:07:59] when you go deep down inside, if you've
[1:08:01] ever sinned, that voice on the inside of
[1:08:03] you starts begging for forgiveness and
[1:08:06] you want to move forward in the kingdom
[1:08:08] of God.
[1:08:10] So we, if I could say this, we don't
[1:08:15] need to
[1:08:17] deal with the recipe anymore.
[1:08:20] The cake has been baked.
[1:08:24] It was baked at Calvary and baked at the
[1:08:27] resurrection.
[1:08:31] If I could, and I I I know it's just an
[1:08:34] analysis and with no disrespect, but
[1:08:38] when the Lord come forth from the the
[1:08:41] the
[1:08:42] grave,
[1:08:45] every benefit of that resurrection was
[1:08:48] for the believer.
[1:08:51] And the church has got to take those
[1:08:54] benefits and start living by them.
[1:08:59] You've got to start bringing the
[1:09:01] supernatural
[1:09:03] into your life. You've got to start
[1:09:06] participating in supernatural. You've
[1:09:09] got to start using faith
[1:09:14] to mold
[1:09:16] and change the events in your life.
[1:09:25] And the reason I say that is is that
[1:09:27] we're gonna listen to this
[1:09:31] message that is 22 minutes of this
[1:09:36] sermon that it's the participation
[1:09:41] in the benefits of the resurrection.
[1:09:44] It's the living and participation
[1:09:48] of that
[1:09:51] power of the supernatural in your life.
[1:09:56] Not just running when you have an
[1:09:58] emergency.
[1:10:00] You understand? Not just getting
[1:10:01] desperate and doing, but when you can
[1:10:04] start living
[1:10:07] by the faith and power
[1:10:12] of the life of Christ in you, you've now
[1:10:15] been resurrected from unbelief.
[1:10:19] And that spirit is living in you. And
[1:10:23] that's
[1:10:25] what resurrects you and changes you.
[1:10:31] It's not living by the rules
[1:10:36] and then waiting for an event
[1:10:39] of the rapture.
[1:10:43] It's resurrecting first
[1:10:47] with quickening resurrected power.
[1:10:50] Living in that power, living in that
[1:10:53] light, living by that word,
[1:10:59] becoming in a union, an invisible union
[1:11:03] with the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:11:05] earthly bride, you becoming one.
[1:11:10] So you you you you it's not two
[1:11:13] compartments in your mind. It's not your
[1:11:16] religious life and your church life and
[1:11:18] your worldly life. It's not what you
[1:11:22] believe and what you do.
[1:11:25] It becomes your all in all.
[1:11:29] And you know that you're not living by
[1:11:32] your own strength and your own might.
[1:11:35] That Jesus isn't on call.
[1:11:40] He's not like a doctor
[1:11:43] or or an ambulance, you know, you
[1:11:45] they're waiting at the firehouse, you
[1:11:47] know, and you pick up your phone and you
[1:11:50] dial 911 and they come running to you.
[1:11:53] Uh-uh. You have it. You He's living in
[1:11:55] your house. He's living with you on your
[1:11:58] job. He's He's every place you go.
[1:12:01] You're one with him. You're walking with
[1:12:03] him. You know that that resurrection
[1:12:08] is a possession that is in you.
[1:12:14] Now I would love to get rid of the mind
[1:12:17] battle,
[1:12:18] but you've got to fight the mind battle
[1:12:21] by reading your Bible and by praying. It
[1:12:25] doesn't hurt to fast a little. It
[1:12:27] doesn't hurt to to give some time. It
[1:12:31] doesn't hurt to get into his presence
[1:12:33] and until everything's melted away and
[1:12:36] you can just look into his face and feel
[1:12:38] his glory.
[1:12:45] But we we've got to start drawing the
[1:12:48] line
[1:12:49] understanding that we are getting very
[1:12:52] very close to the end.
[1:12:56] Why would one country go try to destroy
[1:12:59] another country's ability to have a
[1:13:02] nuclear bomb?
[1:13:04] You know why? Because it's prophesied
[1:13:07] that somebody's going to blow this place
[1:13:10] up.
[1:13:18] And you know, I got a different theory,
[1:13:20] just me. But if you stop everybody else
[1:13:23] from blowing it up, you're probably the
[1:13:26] one that's going to blow it up.
[1:13:35] No,
[1:13:36] we don't live by fear.
[1:13:40] We've got a way of escape,
[1:13:43] right? It's him.
[1:13:46] It's his word. We've got to get in the
[1:13:49] ark.
[1:13:52] We've got to get in the resurrection.
[1:13:57] I am the resurrection and the life.
[1:14:03] He that believeth on me shall never die.
[1:14:08] I am the resurrection.
[1:14:13] If you and the resurrection are one,
[1:14:16] then you are the resurrection.
[1:14:19] And therefore, if you understand what
[1:14:21] I'm saying, I'm not trying to make a
[1:14:23] doctrinal statement. I'm trying to put
[1:14:26] within you an understanding that you've
[1:14:29] got to resurrect now in order to
[1:14:32] rapture. You've got to be in the
[1:14:34] resurrection. In order to rapture,
[1:14:40] and you've got to make that commitment
[1:14:42] in your heart, your mind, and your life
[1:14:45] as an individual. I I I don't know all
[1:14:48] your circumstances.
[1:14:51] I would love to know you all better.
[1:14:53] When the prophet of God said, "I'd love
[1:14:55] to go home with each and every one of
[1:14:57] you." I know what he means by that.
[1:15:00] A lot of you, I shake your hand and I I
[1:15:03] don't you you know, I don't always know
[1:15:06] faces very well and and and but I want
[1:15:09] you to know I love you
[1:15:13] and I appreciate you.
[1:15:16] But you've got, it's an individual
[1:15:18] affair. You've got to decide. I don't
[1:15:21] care if you're 13 years old this morning
[1:15:23] or or 10 years old. You can decide right
[1:15:26] now. I'm going to live my life for the
[1:15:29] gospel. I am going to get into the
[1:15:33] resurrection. I am going to get into his
[1:15:36] presence. I'm going to get into his
[1:15:38] thinking. I'm going to let this mind
[1:15:40] that was in Christ be in me.
[1:15:44] I'm going to look upon the needs of
[1:15:46] every other person other than myself.
[1:15:48] I'm going to be a doer of the word of
[1:15:51] God. I'm going to lay for myself a
[1:15:53] pattern of good works that'll glorify my
[1:15:56] father in heaven. I'm going to let my
[1:15:58] light shine.
[1:16:03] And we've got to move
[1:16:06] from do nothing.
[1:16:09] I know you believe. You've all got the
[1:16:12] recipe,
[1:16:16] but you got to eat the cake.
[1:16:20] All the benefits of the resurrection are
[1:16:22] there.
[1:16:26] You don't need to
[1:16:28] change the recipe. The recipe is repent,
[1:16:34] be baptized,
[1:16:36] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:16:38] Holy Ghost because this promise is to
[1:16:40] you. and to your children and your
[1:16:43] children and children, as many as those
[1:16:45] that are far off, as many as our Lord
[1:16:48] our God shall call. It's just a decision
[1:16:50] that you've got to make and you can't
[1:16:53] let time just keep going by.
[1:17:00] Cuz it's running out.
[1:17:03] The sand dial has been turned over.
[1:17:08] The grains are moving through.
[1:17:12] The hour's come. It's happening.
[1:17:17] You say, "Well, it what happen?" You
[1:17:19] don't know when your number's being
[1:17:20] called.
[1:17:22] The scripture says, "Oh fool, thy soul
[1:17:25] might be required of you this day."
[1:17:30] So, it it's time to be sober.
[1:17:35] So before we listen this morning, I
[1:17:38] wanted to
[1:17:40] lay just a little understanding to you
[1:17:44] of what that
[1:17:47] I that
[1:17:53] I don't know how to say this, but when
[1:17:55] we play this, I I want you to listen to
[1:17:58] what that he's saying
[1:18:03] about the spark. work about the
[1:18:06] mechanics, about the dynamics,
[1:18:09] about how we've put all this time into
[1:18:12] the recipe.
[1:18:14] You know what I mean? But we need
[1:18:15] something that takes us to that next
[1:18:19] level. I want you to listen to how he
[1:18:22] says what that was was Luke 17:30,
[1:18:26] Revelations 10:7. Won't you understand
[1:18:29] about the sheath wave offering
[1:18:32] how it had to be waved over the people
[1:18:36] and he and he and so I'd like to just
[1:18:39] read be and we're going to listen if you
[1:18:41] have um some of you I know have phones
[1:18:45] and tablets and things but we're going
[1:18:47] to start at paragraph 72 we're only
[1:18:50] going to listen to 22 minutes so it's
[1:18:54] not overbearing but I'd like just to
[1:18:57] read a few statements ahead of time.
[1:19:01] He said,
[1:19:08] and he he says this, he says in
[1:19:11] paragraph 46, he says, "But the real
[1:19:13] seal had been broken, and one who once
[1:19:17] lived as we live died as we die
[1:19:22] and risen from the dead." What a
[1:19:25] mourning. every one like it in all the
[1:19:29] history of the world. The secret was
[1:19:32] made known that he was both resurrection
[1:19:37] and the life.
[1:19:41] So he's resurrection and life.
[1:19:46] Okay? So you can't have the life without
[1:19:49] having the resurrection.
[1:19:52] You can't have the resurrection without
[1:19:54] the life. You've got to have the life
[1:19:57] before the rapture.
[1:20:00] Okay? You understand
[1:20:02] the approach that we're taking this
[1:20:05] morning?
[1:20:07] He says, he said, when he comes forth on
[1:20:11] the that morning, because I live, you
[1:20:16] live also. Not only was he the
[1:20:19] beneficiary of the resurrection, but all
[1:20:24] those seeds that was resting in God's
[1:20:28] great promise was the benefactor of that
[1:20:32] resurrection to life because he said
[1:20:37] because I live ye shall live also. That
[1:20:42] was the breaking of the seal. Because he
[1:20:46] was brought up, so will everyone that's
[1:20:50] in Christ be brought up with him. Where
[1:20:54] do you have to be?
[1:20:57] You have to be in the resurrection and
[1:21:00] life. So remember, resurrection and life
[1:21:04] before rapture. So, you can't sit back
[1:21:07] and live any way you want and then wait
[1:21:09] for the day the rapture comes. Like,
[1:21:11] it's an event on the calendar. The
[1:21:14] rapture is a condition.
[1:21:17] You say, "Well, if Brother McGary dies,
[1:21:19] I'd rather have you preach my
[1:21:21] resurrection
[1:21:22] and my rapture than my death." Oh,
[1:21:25] Brother McGary's body was changed.
[1:21:29] This is the old coat laying there. It
[1:21:31] just
[1:21:33] it wasn't very good-looking anyway. But
[1:21:36] now he's got a new one
[1:21:38] because he had resurrection.
[1:21:41] He had life. And he didn't taste the
[1:21:44] second death.
[1:21:49] We don't sorrow as others do that have
[1:21:51] no hope.
[1:21:54] But our hope isn't future. Our hope is
[1:21:58] resurrection now and life now.
[1:22:02] And then he says here
[1:22:05] he says, "And he come to redeem or to
[1:22:09] bring to life." That's paragraph 59.
[1:22:14] Bring to life those predestinated
[1:22:17] seed that God seen before the foundation
[1:22:21] of the world and put their names on the
[1:22:24] book of life. So what does he come to
[1:22:26] do? To bring you to life.
[1:22:29] What does resurrection mean? It means to
[1:22:32] be brought from death unto life. We were
[1:22:35] dead in sins and trespasses. But by the
[1:22:39] blood of Jesus Christ and the power of
[1:22:41] the resurrection that now the same
[1:22:44] spirit that raised him from the dead, he
[1:22:48] now places that spirit in you. But you
[1:22:52] can't say you have it if you're not
[1:22:54] living by it.
[1:22:56] Now, I'm preaching that myself this
[1:22:58] morning because I got a lot of changes
[1:23:00] to make in my life. A lot of changes
[1:23:03] about my attitude. A lot of changes
[1:23:05] about my thinking. A lot about changes
[1:23:08] about how I spend my time. The lot of
[1:23:10] changes about what I think about. A lot
[1:23:12] of changes about what I watch. A lot of
[1:23:15] changes about what I listen to. But
[1:23:17] praise God. Isn't that what resurrection
[1:23:19] is about? It's about change.
[1:23:24] We don't have to remain in the condition
[1:23:27] we're in. God is unchanging. And that
[1:23:31] unchanging God changes us into the image
[1:23:34] of his only begotten son.
[1:23:38] The question is, is that what you want?
[1:23:45] You can't come to church and just think
[1:23:46] you're fulfilling your Sunday
[1:23:48] obligation. You got to have a greater
[1:23:51] desire for life than that. A greater
[1:23:54] desire for power than that. You want to
[1:23:57] live by the power of the resurrection.
[1:23:59] You want the power of the resurrection
[1:24:01] to control the job site. You want the
[1:24:04] power of the resurrection to control
[1:24:06] your home. You want the power of the
[1:24:08] resurrection to control how you live.
[1:24:11] You know, in the whole tape,
[1:24:15] modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:24:17] Not once was he talking about politics.
[1:24:23] It was always about moral condition and
[1:24:28] the thinking and the direction that the
[1:24:31] world was in and how those vent events
[1:24:34] were made clear by Malachi 4:5, Luke
[1:24:38] 17:30 and Revelations 10:7.
[1:24:43] Just depends on how serious you want to
[1:24:46] get.
[1:24:50] and that that it's just got to work. I'm
[1:24:52] not here to condemn you. I'm here to
[1:24:55] encourage you.
[1:24:58] He said,
[1:25:00] whose names are in the book of life and
[1:25:03] here they are on the earth without a
[1:25:07] hope.
[1:25:09] And he come not only to be a blessing
[1:25:13] but to share the blessing with every
[1:25:17] predestinated seed.
[1:25:20] Now if the seed wasn't on the earth, it
[1:25:24] could not live. It had to be on the
[1:25:27] earth and also germinized.
[1:25:31] No matter how long it kept in darkness,
[1:25:35] it'll come forth when the sen shines
[1:25:39] upon it. Now notice,
[1:25:42] he came to share it with us.
[1:25:50] You understand it? It's there to be
[1:25:52] shared.
[1:25:56] So we can eat that. That's right.
[1:26:00] We can take that. It's ours.
[1:26:04] The same power that resurrected Jesus
[1:26:07] Christ has been placed in your hands.
[1:26:11] That you can take that power and model
[1:26:14] your life in the footsteps of Jesus
[1:26:17] Christ. As he is, so are we in this
[1:26:20] world.
[1:26:24] That's your inheritance.
[1:26:29] I had to wait till my parents passed
[1:26:31] away to get my inheritance. I don't have
[1:26:33] to wait for an inheritance now. I can
[1:26:35] sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus
[1:26:38] right now. I can become a new creature
[1:26:41] in Christ Jesus right now. I can grow to
[1:26:45] a farther level than I am right now. I
[1:26:48] can go forward for where I am right now.
[1:26:51] I'm not going to set up camp. I want to
[1:26:54] move.
[1:26:59] You can move.
[1:27:01] It's your promise.
[1:27:04] It's not mine to preach. It's yours to
[1:27:06] accept.
[1:27:13] Came to share it with us.
[1:27:16] Paragraph
[1:27:20] 63 and 64. Now if there is another
[1:27:23] gospel as Paul spoke to one of the
[1:27:26] groups I am so surprised that you've
[1:27:29] turned to another gospel which there is
[1:27:33] no other but a makebelieve gospel to a
[1:27:38] denominational fiction
[1:27:41] turning from the good news
[1:27:45] because I live
[1:27:47] you live also
[1:27:50] and I have and I live in you
[1:27:54] and the works that I do.
[1:27:58] John 14:12.
[1:28:00] The works that I do will identify myself
[1:28:04] in you.
[1:28:07] The works that I do will identify myself
[1:28:12] in you. So you understand there's no
[1:28:15] resurrection, there's no rapture without
[1:28:19] participating in the ren resurrection
[1:28:23] and the benefits thereof, you're fooling
[1:28:26] yourself. We're fooling ourselves. If
[1:28:29] you're going to sit here and say, "I
[1:28:30] believe in Malachi 4:5. I believe Luke
[1:28:33] 17:30. I believe in Revelations 10:7. I
[1:28:36] believe in baptism and name Lord Jesus.
[1:28:38] I believe all these things.
[1:28:43] And there's no evidence
[1:28:47] by works
[1:28:50] that he's living in you.
[1:28:55] You don't don't sit there and say, "Oh,
[1:28:57] I'm I'm doomed." No, you're not.
[1:29:04] Why starve to death when the cake's been
[1:29:07] baked?
[1:29:09] Eat it.
[1:29:11] Eat it. Come take a piece of it. Come
[1:29:14] try it. Come participate in it. Take a
[1:29:19] promise
[1:29:21] and apply it.
[1:29:23] Look up and say, "Lord, you promised
[1:29:25] this. I'm believing it." Watch him bring
[1:29:28] it to pass. He's the same yesterday,
[1:29:31] today, and forever. And he's alive
[1:29:33] forever more.
[1:29:39] No wonder our prophet told he said the
[1:29:42] sickest thing is the church. Why?
[1:29:45] They're living so far below their
[1:29:47] privileges.
[1:29:50] He said if you took all the water and
[1:29:53] all the world and put it in one little
[1:29:56] pipe, he said that pressure is how much
[1:29:59] God wants to bless you.
[1:30:04] And just don't believe for yourself,
[1:30:06] believe for other people.
[1:30:16] I'll get sidetracked on that.
[1:30:20] He said,
[1:30:23] he said, "I will do myself identifying
[1:30:26] you." What a message. No wonder we've
[1:30:29] had a dark world of theology. But in the
[1:30:34] evening time, there shall come light
[1:30:36] again. There will be a resurrection in
[1:30:40] the evening time.
[1:30:44] It shall be light
[1:30:47] at the evening time. Can you imagine
[1:30:50] there is a people Yes, sir. And you're
[1:30:53] going to hear him say this in just a few
[1:30:55] minutes. That is going to recognize that
[1:30:59] power because there was a sheath
[1:31:02] offering
[1:31:03] waved over the people that let them know
[1:31:07] that power was present and that they
[1:31:10] were going to mature
[1:31:12] into that power.
[1:31:17] We want to move forward. Yes, sir. But
[1:31:19] where do we want to move forward? We
[1:31:22] don't want to move forward into better
[1:31:25] explanations of the recipe. We don't
[1:31:27] want to move forward into different ways
[1:31:31] that we can cook it.
[1:31:34] We want to move forward into eating it.
[1:31:41] Taking the promise.
[1:31:46] Is that correct? By these great and
[1:31:49] exceeding precious promises,
[1:31:53] we are partakers
[1:31:56] of
[1:31:58] divine
[1:31:59] nature.
[1:32:01] By the promises,
[1:32:04] we are partakers of
[1:32:07] resurrection,
[1:32:09] divine nature,
[1:32:11] Holy Spirit.
[1:32:14] If the spirit that was in Jesus Christ
[1:32:16] dwell in you, it'll quicken your mortal
[1:32:20] body's resurrection
[1:32:23] before rapture.
[1:32:28] I trust
[1:32:30] this morning
[1:32:33] that
[1:32:34] when we listen
[1:32:37] that you will see what he's talking
[1:32:39] about. Help. This ministry came to spark
[1:32:44] you
[1:32:46] so you can live by the life by the
[1:32:51] quickening power
[1:32:53] of the life of the gospel. Folk, it's
[1:32:58] 11:30. We'll listen to 22 minutes and
[1:33:00] try to close. Do you love the Lord?
[1:33:04] I hope I don't sound like I'm yelling.
[1:33:07] But my mother told me, she said, "You'd
[1:33:09] be a pretty good preacher if you didn't
[1:33:11] yell."
[1:33:14] I just said, "Mom, that's why I couldn't
[1:33:16] be a priest. They don't yell enough for
[1:33:18] me."
[1:33:20] Yeah, I was I was going to be a priest.
[1:33:24] I like the I just chose the priesthood
[1:33:26] of Mechisedc instead of the priesthood
[1:33:29] of Rome. That's all. Amen. You love the
[1:33:32] Lord this morning. How many wants to go
[1:33:36] in the rapture? You want to go in the
[1:33:38] rapture? Get in the resurrection.
[1:33:42] I I know some of you are facing a lot of
[1:33:45] financials. You're facing a lot of
[1:33:47] difficult. You're facing a lot of
[1:33:49] decisions.
[1:33:51] But don't forget the footsteps
[1:33:55] of the righteous are ordered by the
[1:33:57] Lord.
[1:33:59] Shadrach, Meshack, Abednego. No matter
[1:34:02] how dark it was, they didn't go into
[1:34:04] that fire.
[1:34:07] They didn't yoke themselves with
[1:34:09] unbelievers.
[1:34:11] They didn't compromise. They said, "Oh
[1:34:14] king, live forever." But we will not bow
[1:34:18] down to that idol.
[1:34:21] Oh boss, oh everybody live forever. But
[1:34:25] I am not going to bow down to the
[1:34:27] pressures of this world. I'm going to
[1:34:29] let the divine power of the resurrection
[1:34:33] deliver me from every sickness, from
[1:34:36] every situation, from everything. I'm
[1:34:39] going to rely on Jesus Christ the same
[1:34:42] yesterday, today, and forever that I'll
[1:34:44] be able to stand my ground and that I
[1:34:47] can become an overcomer.
[1:34:51] If you're backslid
[1:34:53] this morning,
[1:34:57] stop.
[1:34:59] Leave those things which are behind
[1:35:03] behind.
[1:35:04] You don't have to go refix it. If you've
[1:35:07] stole, the scripture says, "Seal no
[1:35:10] more, but work with your hands that you
[1:35:12] might give."
[1:35:14] Don't start dwelling in the past. You
[1:35:17] just dwell in what the power is that can
[1:35:20] transform you and invite that power into
[1:35:23] your life this morning and you will
[1:35:25] live. God bless you. If you have your
[1:35:28] books or your phones or if if you
[1:35:31] tablets or whatever you want, you can
[1:35:32] read it on the board. 22 minutes. Just
[1:35:35] pay attention. I I I trust you believe.
[1:35:39] If I could offer you anything better
[1:35:40] this morning, church, I'd do it.
[1:35:46] But you have to understand I I believe
[1:35:48] in Malachi 4:5.
[1:35:50] I believe the Bible in this day promised
[1:35:54] that the spirit of Elijah
[1:35:58] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:35:59] Lord would come again
[1:36:03] and that he would turn our hearts, not
[1:36:07] our minds, not the recipe, but he would
[1:36:10] turn our hearts back to the faith of our
[1:36:16] fathers.
[1:36:17] And that faith was the works that he did
[1:36:20] we shall do. Also, I don't want to make
[1:36:23] it up. I don't want to try to produce
[1:36:26] it. I want to bear it.
[1:36:30] I want it to become my nature. I want to
[1:36:35] live by the promises of God. Pray for
[1:36:37] me. I have a long ways to go and I have
[1:36:41] the devil is not not a friend of mine.
[1:36:47] He don't like me and I don't like him
[1:36:51] and we don't get along and he keeps
[1:36:54] knocking me down and tripping me and
[1:36:58] setting snares for me. But I have one
[1:37:01] promise.
[1:37:02] Amen. That the Lord my God will deliver
[1:37:06] me out of every trial.
[1:37:09] Amen. You believe this morning? If you
[1:37:12] believe, you can have what you ask you.
[1:37:15] God bless you. If if you have any
[1:37:17] questions about when I mention the name
[1:37:20] of brother Brandham or I talk about
[1:37:22] Malachi 4:5 and you're a visitor, I
[1:37:25] would love to share with you the Bible
[1:37:30] and every promise that's in the Bible
[1:37:32] for our day that Yeah. We're not
[1:37:35] building arcs, are we? No. We're
[1:37:38] building and entering into a
[1:37:42] resurrection for a rapture. God bless
[1:37:45] you as you listen. 22 minutes. That's
[1:37:47] all.
[1:37:50] I understand. He proves what he said
[1:37:54] because they are a part of that seed
[1:37:57] that was represented on the book of life
[1:37:59] that he came to receive back to God
[1:38:02] again.
[1:38:05] Oh, what a message.
[1:38:08] Easter morning. Not only did he raise,
[1:38:11] but his beneficiaries raised with him.
[1:38:16] They were in Christ at his crucifixion.
[1:38:19] They were in him at his resurrection.
[1:38:22] We are his beneficials. Quicken after
[1:38:25] being dead in darkness, the darkened
[1:38:27] world of unbelief where churches and
[1:38:30] denominations and so forth have drawn us
[1:38:32] out. And there's something in us
[1:38:34] calling, "Oh, we want God. We're hungry
[1:38:36] and thirsting for God. We joined the
[1:38:38] Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal,
[1:38:40] Presbyterians. And what Lord, still
[1:38:42] there was something wrong. We just
[1:38:45] couldn't find it yet. And all of a
[1:38:47] sudden, while we was groping in
[1:38:49] darkness, the great resurrection
[1:38:53] came to us in the manifestation of the
[1:38:56] promised word of God. Like he was the
[1:38:58] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:39:01] God. I will not be a soul in hell.
[1:39:05] Neither will I suffer my holy one to see
[1:39:07] corruption.
[1:39:09] He manifested in every word of God that
[1:39:11] was promised to him. He proved it when
[1:39:14] he raised on the Easter morning.
[1:39:17] Now them who were once groping in
[1:39:21] darkness and wandering around if they
[1:39:23] should wash feet on this day or if they
[1:39:25] should keep a certain day or do a
[1:39:27] certain set of rules, all those things
[1:39:29] passed away. For that was a glorious
[1:39:32] resurrection that defied every manmade
[1:39:35] thing that man had ever done, every
[1:39:38] man-made reason.
[1:39:40] There had never been to that time a man
[1:39:42] that could lay his life down and pick it
[1:39:43] up again. He defied that scientific
[1:39:46] proof they had by raising again. They
[1:39:50] say that Jesus Christ isn't the same
[1:39:53] yesterday, today, and forever. That his
[1:39:54] power isn't the same. That his gospel
[1:39:56] isn't the same. When the Bible says it
[1:39:59] the same, God defied every denomination,
[1:40:02] ever creed and he moved forth with his
[1:40:04] holy spirit as he promised and proved it
[1:40:07] to us that he is alive.
[1:40:11] We are the benefactors of his
[1:40:14] resurrection.
[1:40:16] Quicken after being dead in the world in
[1:40:19] sin and trespasses, he has quickened us
[1:40:21] together with him. raised with him now
[1:40:25] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:40:27] Jesus.
[1:40:29] His bra his spirit brings his same life
[1:40:32] again on the earth. If the spirit of God
[1:40:36] that raised up Christ the body, the
[1:40:39] anointed body, if the spirit of God
[1:40:42] anointed that body in such a way that
[1:40:45] when that seed fell into the earth, he
[1:40:48] just wouldn't let him rest there. No,
[1:40:50] no. He quickened him and raised him up.
[1:40:54] That same spirit by the same works, by
[1:40:58] the same power, by the same signs be in
[1:41:00] you,
[1:41:02] he'll also raise you up.
[1:41:07] I'd like to read a little scripture here
[1:41:08] for you. I'd like for you to turn to
[1:41:10] another scripture I got wrote down here.
[1:41:13] It might help you a little. It's found
[1:41:15] in the book of Leviticus, the 23rd
[1:41:18] chapter, the 9th to the 11th verse.
[1:41:22] Listen close in the law, Levitical law,
[1:41:25] God speaking to Moses.
[1:41:28] Listen,
[1:41:30] all these things are types now. And
[1:41:34] we'll stop here for a few moments to get
[1:41:37] into this type. And the Lord spake unto
[1:41:40] Moses, saying, "Speak unto the children
[1:41:44] of Israel, and say unto them, when you
[1:41:48] come into the land which I give unto
[1:41:51] you,
[1:41:53] unto the place of position
[1:41:57] that I have given unto you." Now you
[1:42:00] speak to the children of Israel
[1:42:03] that when you get to this certain place
[1:42:06] that I've promised,
[1:42:10] I take you when you get there in this
[1:42:13] land, now speaking natural here, type in
[1:42:15] the spiritual
[1:42:17] and shall reap the harvest thereof, you
[1:42:20] have received what I told you thereof.
[1:42:23] Then you shall bring a sheep of the
[1:42:27] first fruits of your harvest
[1:42:30] unto the priest, and he shall wave the
[1:42:33] sheep before the Lord
[1:42:36] to be accepted for you.
[1:42:40] On the tomorrow after the Sabbath,
[1:42:44] the priest shall wave it.
[1:42:48] If there would be any holy ritual,
[1:42:51] it should come forth on the Sabbath day,
[1:42:55] which was the seventh day of the week,
[1:42:58] which is Saturday.
[1:43:01] But did you notice in this memorial
[1:43:05] they wave it on the first day of those
[1:43:09] days
[1:43:12] the sheep which was the first of your
[1:43:16] seed that you planted
[1:43:18] when it comes up and ripens you cut down
[1:43:22] this sheet and take it to the priest and
[1:43:27] let him take it and wave it before the
[1:43:30] Lord. Lord,
[1:43:32] for your acception that you are
[1:43:34] accepted, you have come with your sheep
[1:43:38] and he's to wave it before the Lord on
[1:43:41] not on the Sabbath, the seventh day, but
[1:43:44] on the first day, which we call Sunday,
[1:43:50] su n a y. Of course, that's a a Roman uh
[1:43:55] word, which they called it the Sunday
[1:43:57] for the son god. But how it is changed
[1:44:01] is not s u n anymore. It's the f o n d a
[1:44:05] y. The Sunday
[1:44:08] that that carnal week, God's first one
[1:44:12] up from the dead
[1:44:15] is to be waved over the congregation
[1:44:20] that we are his seed. And that's the
[1:44:24] first of the seed of those that slept,
[1:44:28] waved upon the first day of the week on
[1:44:31] Sunday. He raised up, waved goodbye, and
[1:44:37] ascended up on high in the presence of
[1:44:40] the people. Notice, it was the first
[1:44:44] corn of God's wheat that had been raised
[1:44:47] from the dead.
[1:44:49] God's first corner wheat by God's
[1:44:51] quickening power.
[1:44:54] God had quickened his life, raised him
[1:44:56] up from the dead, and he was the first
[1:44:58] fruits of those that slept,
[1:45:01] the first fruits. He was that sheep.
[1:45:03] That's why they had to wade that sheep.
[1:45:06] Or it was the first one that come to
[1:45:08] maturity.
[1:45:11] And it was waved as a memorial of
[1:45:14] thanksgiving to God, believing that the
[1:45:16] rest of them would come. It was a sign.
[1:45:19] And today, because he was the first son
[1:45:23] of God to come to full maturity to be in
[1:45:26] God, he was plucked up from the earth
[1:45:30] and is waved over the people. Oh, what a
[1:45:34] glorious lesson by the quickening power.
[1:45:37] The first one, although it been tied in
[1:45:40] many times, and we'll see later, he was
[1:45:42] tied. But this is really the first
[1:45:44] fruits of them that slept. He was waved
[1:45:48] over the promised seed that had promise
[1:45:53] of life. He was waved at the day of
[1:45:56] Pentecost when there came a sound from
[1:45:58] heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind
[1:46:03] and was waved over the people, the
[1:46:06] Pentecostal people that was up at
[1:46:08] Pentecost waiting for uh the blessing to
[1:46:11] come and to be waved.
[1:46:14] Again, we realize in the last days
[1:46:17] according to Luke 17:30, in the Sunday
[1:46:20] again, in the days that the S o n of man
[1:46:24] will be revealed or waved again over the
[1:46:27] people. Now, who is the son of man? In
[1:46:30] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:46:33] was with God and the word was God
[1:46:37] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:46:40] among us. Amen. And of all the teaching
[1:46:42] that we have and confirmation of the
[1:46:45] word of God by word of God by signs by
[1:46:48] wonders,
[1:46:50] we see today that in the book of of Luke
[1:46:54] here as we just quoted from the Luke the
[1:46:57] 17th chapter and the 30th verse and
[1:46:59] Malachi 4 in the different scriptures
[1:47:02] that we are acquainted with that that
[1:47:04] word again is waved over the people that
[1:47:09] the dead traditions The man is dead and
[1:47:12] the son of God stop is alive again with
[1:47:15] the baptism of the Holy Spirit right
[1:47:17] among us and giving us lifeal
[1:47:22] as Christ was the first one to raise
[1:47:26] from all the prophets and so forth all
[1:47:29] those types in many places he was the
[1:47:31] first fruits of those that slept in the
[1:47:34] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:47:36] church there'll have to be a sheep waved
[1:47:39] again the lazy.
[1:47:42] Oh my
[1:47:46] waving of the sheep. What was the sheep?
[1:47:48] The first one that come to mature. The
[1:47:52] first one that proved it was a wheat.
[1:47:54] That proved it was a sheep. Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about.
[1:48:01] Hallelujah. It was waved over the
[1:48:03] people. And the first time there will
[1:48:05] come forth for the bride age or a
[1:48:08] resurrection out of dark
[1:48:10] denominationalism
[1:48:12] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:48:15] of the word has turned back again in its
[1:48:18] full power and being waved over the
[1:48:20] people by the same signs and wonders
[1:48:23] that he did that day. All right. Because
[1:48:26] I live, ye live also. Speaking to his
[1:48:30] wife, because I live, ye live also. What
[1:48:35] a resurrection
[1:48:37] that that was. And what a resurrection
[1:48:40] this is. Amen. To be quickened from the
[1:48:43] dead, to be made alive in Christ Jesus
[1:48:48] by God's quickening power. He was waved
[1:48:51] to them. the word which he was was waved
[1:48:55] back to him on the day of Pentecost. The
[1:48:57] word made manifest now and is to be
[1:49:02] waved again in the last days. Now, for
[1:49:04] instance, you say, "Well, wait a minute,
[1:49:07] brother. I know a church that Well, I do
[1:49:10] too.
[1:49:11] But now, for instance, what if if we
[1:49:14] were going to go back to Tucson this
[1:49:17] afternoon?
[1:49:19] now. And each one of us had a was going
[1:49:22] to go in a a big Cadillac, brand new.
[1:49:27] And all of the seats were made out of
[1:49:31] dough skin, softest of the leather, soft
[1:49:35] and easy to sit in. And the floorboard
[1:49:39] were plush. The steering wheel were
[1:49:42] nickel plated and had diamond studs all
[1:49:46] over it. And the engine was mechanically
[1:49:50] tested to be exactly the right engine.
[1:49:54] And the wheels were all had bearings and
[1:49:57] greased up. And the tires were all
[1:50:02] puncturep proof and blowout free. They
[1:50:04] all been tested scientifically.
[1:50:07] They've been pushed off the assembly
[1:50:09] line. Both of them. And both of them
[1:50:11] filled up with gasoline.
[1:50:14] That's the running power.
[1:50:17] the gasoline because in it is the
[1:50:19] octane.
[1:50:21] But now when you go to start them,
[1:50:26] although both of them look just alike,
[1:50:30] but there's one of them don't have any
[1:50:32] spark,
[1:50:35] any firing power.
[1:50:38] Well, you say the power is in the
[1:50:40] gasoline, brother. But I don't care how
[1:50:43] much power is in the gasoline, unless
[1:50:46] there's a spark there
[1:50:48] to manifest that power.
[1:50:51] Unless there's a power there to confirm
[1:50:55] the death gasoline, it just might as
[1:50:57] well be water.
[1:50:59] until no matter how much theologians
[1:51:03] claim, how well you got your church set,
[1:51:06] how much education you got, how much
[1:51:08] like the Bible, until that wave sheath,
[1:51:12] until the Holy Spirit comes upon that
[1:51:17] person to quicken that word. The
[1:51:20] gasoline represents the word. It's the
[1:51:22] truth. But without the spirit, it won't
[1:51:25] move.
[1:51:29] We put too much stress on the mechanics
[1:51:33] and nothing on the dynamics.
[1:51:36] It needs the dynamic power of God, the
[1:51:39] resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon
[1:51:43] the church to manifest
[1:51:45] and to bring to pass that this is
[1:51:48] gasoline.
[1:51:52] It might be in a gasoline can. It could
[1:51:54] still be water.
[1:51:58] See, but the only proof of it is put the
[1:52:02] life on it and it'll prove work.
[1:52:07] And when you try to put the Holy Spirit
[1:52:11] in a denomination, you're as much as you
[1:52:14] get a splatter.
[1:52:17] You ruin your engine by getting it full
[1:52:20] of carbon.
[1:52:23] But oh, I'm so glad that there is a 10,5
[1:52:28] power, the word of God and a Holy Ghost
[1:52:31] to light it up and to resurrect the
[1:52:34] power of God into a man's life or a
[1:52:37] woman's life or into a church that
[1:52:40] shoved that Cadillac down the road down
[1:52:45] or the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:49] which came back to its wave over the
[1:52:50] people at the day of Pentecost.
[1:52:52] making him the same yesterday, today,
[1:52:54] and forever.
[1:52:56] There was the first sheep come up from
[1:52:58] all the prophets, which was the son of
[1:52:59] God, the king of all prophets. There's
[1:53:02] been churches, churches, brides, brides,
[1:53:04] churches, brides, brides. But there's
[1:53:06] got to come one.
[1:53:09] Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] There has to come a real bride.
[1:53:14] There must come one that's not only got
[1:53:16] the mechanics, but the dynamics of it.
[1:53:19] Hallelujah.
[1:53:20] make that church live
[1:53:25] in the power of his resurrection.
[1:53:29] Until we come to that place, until we
[1:53:32] find that place, what good does it do to
[1:53:35] polish the hugs?
[1:53:37] What good does it do to give her a
[1:53:39] facelift or a sign in our job?
[1:53:42] When there's no dynamics in it, no
[1:53:45] matter how much the mechanics prove to
[1:53:47] be right, there's got to be a dynamic to
[1:53:50] make it work. That's what he proved.
[1:53:55] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. That's what
[1:53:58] proved.
[1:53:59] He wasn't only the word, but he was God
[1:54:02] himself. the dynamics in the word
[1:54:07] that made the body of Jesus Christ whole
[1:54:11] stiff and dead in the grave shaken to
[1:54:14] life and rise again and roll away the
[1:54:18] I am he that was dead so dead till the
[1:54:22] sun said he was dead the moon said he
[1:54:24] was dead the stars said he was dead all
[1:54:26] nature said he was dead now the whole
[1:54:29] world has to recognize that he's alive
[1:54:31] again He was not only the mechanics
[1:54:35] God's word, he was a dynamics to prove
[1:54:37] it. And as he being the groove,
[1:54:42] the bride has to come forth because it's
[1:54:44] part of him. And it can only be the
[1:54:47] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:54:50] the revelations and the others that
[1:54:52] spoke of the bride. It can only manifest
[1:54:55] if it does something different from the
[1:54:57] groom. It isn't the bride
[1:55:00] because she's flesh of his flesh, bone
[1:55:03] of his bone, life of his life, power of
[1:55:06] his power.
[1:55:08] She is him
[1:55:11] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:55:14] from his side. She and taking his
[1:55:16] spirit, the feminine, his spirit coming,
[1:55:18] the flesh from his side made both
[1:55:20] mechanics and dynamics. the wife,
[1:55:24] the spirit of him and the flesh of him
[1:55:28] and put it together and made mechanics
[1:55:30] and dynamics
[1:55:32] until the church or the people all these
[1:55:35] Easter bunnies and chivalries and big
[1:55:37] churches and finally will fail and pass
[1:55:40] away until that church become both
[1:55:43] dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:55:47] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:55:49] he did. If he hit on 16 cylinders, so
[1:55:54] world
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:58] in John 14:12, he that believeth on me,
[1:56:02] the works that I do shall see you also.
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:08] Amen. I'll give him a charge of my
[1:56:10] dynamics and his mechanics
[1:56:13] that the world will not be able to
[1:56:15] withstand it and I'll raise him up again
[1:56:17] at the last city. Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] That's the Easter.
[1:56:24] The dynamics and the mechanics together.
[1:56:28] The mechanics without the dynamics. No
[1:56:30] good. Neither is the dynamics without
[1:56:33] the mechanics. You can scream and shout
[1:56:35] and jump up and down all you want to and
[1:56:36] deny this word. Amen. Amen. It won't do
[1:56:39] any good. You're just cranking around
[1:56:42] the pistings of got sparked out of fire
[1:56:44] and no old gas fire. Amen. It'll only
[1:56:47] work as they come together.
[1:56:50] Amen.
[1:56:52] So, one will sit still and the other
[1:56:53] will go up. That's the only thing there
[1:56:56] is to it. Yes, they both might look
[1:56:58] alike, both claim to be churches, both
[1:56:59] claim to be brides, but one has
[1:57:02] mechanics and dynamics. It brings it to
[1:57:06] pass. But what he said is the truth. It
[1:57:09] just won't move. No matter how good the
[1:57:12] mechanics is, until the dynamic comes.
[1:57:15] When a dynamic comes, that bar is made
[1:57:17] to connect with that octane and the
[1:57:19] gasoline. And when that explosion that
[1:57:22] causes a combustion
[1:57:25] and that combustion moves,
[1:57:29] every emotion, every move for he is the
[1:57:33] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:57:37] That's the resurrection. That's the real
[1:57:39] power of God. Mechanic with the
[1:57:42] dynamics.
[1:57:43] Notice it's the spirit that quickens.
[1:57:47] It's the It's the spark that fires.
[1:57:51] It's not the gas that fires. It's the
[1:57:53] spark that fires the gas. See, you can
[1:57:56] do nothing without me. But with me, you
[1:57:58] can do all things.
[1:58:01] As he is the word, is the father living
[1:58:03] father sent me, so stand I. As the
[1:58:05] father has fired me and pushed me into
[1:58:08] everything, I do only that which is
[1:58:09] pleasing to God. Now, as he sent me, so
[1:58:12] stand you. was the same mechanics and it
[1:58:15] takes the same dynamics to operate it
[1:58:17] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:58:19] claim to have the mechanics. The
[1:58:22] dynamics will take its place. Paul said
[1:58:24] the gospel came to us not word only,
[1:58:26] through gasoline only, but through spark
[1:58:28] also to make it move. There you are. It
[1:58:31] came to us in that manner. It's the same
[1:58:34] spirit that raised him up that quickened
[1:58:37] the true believer to eternal life. I
[1:58:40] remember potentially now watch as we are
[1:58:43] getting out of our time. Notice the same
[1:58:47] spirit. Now, Romans 8:1, let's just read
[1:58:49] that again in Romans uh 8:1. And we'll
[1:58:52] see what that says. Um
[1:58:55] all right. And not Romans I mean 8:11,
[1:58:58] I'm sorry. And Romans 8:11. But if
[1:59:03] there's a problem, there's this text.
[1:59:06] But if the spirit of him, God, the Holy
[1:59:10] Spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:59:13] dead dwell in you.
[1:59:18] Oh, there you are.
[1:59:21] If the bridegroom
[1:59:24] spirit dwells in the bride,
[1:59:35] you all have this message. If you don't
[1:59:37] have this message, we'll certainly get
[1:59:40] you a copy
[1:59:42] that you can listen to it. Uh there's
[1:59:45] there's so many avenues and things to be
[1:59:47] brought out,
[1:59:49] but just to stay on my theme this
[1:59:53] morning. I mean,
[1:59:56] uh you
[2:00:00] he he makes this statement. I think you
[2:00:02] just uh heard it like in a paragraph um
[2:00:09] 106.
[2:00:10] He says, "But oh my, I'm so glad that
[2:00:13] there's a 10,000 octane power, the word
[2:00:16] of God, the Holy Ghost, to light it up
[2:00:19] and resurrect the power of God into a
[2:00:25] man's life and a woman's life."
[2:00:29] to resurrect
[2:00:31] the power of God into a man's life and a
[2:00:34] woman's life. So it's it's like
[2:00:38] we know there's a rapture coming.
[2:00:42] You understand that? That's what we live
[2:00:44] for.
[2:00:47] I mean, we I know the world thinks we're
[2:00:49] crazy. If you would sit down and talk to
[2:00:52] somebody and say, "I believe one day
[2:00:56] that I'm going to be in about my
[2:00:58] father's business,
[2:01:01] right? and I'm going to be
[2:01:06] changed.
[2:01:07] Well, we know that if God does one
[2:01:09] thing, he does the same thing every
[2:01:12] time. Is that right? So, what was Enoch
[2:01:15] doing? Enoch was walking
[2:01:19] in the word of God and he was changed.
[2:01:22] What was Moses doing? Walking in the
[2:01:25] word of God and he was changed. What was
[2:01:29] Elijah doing? walking in the word of God
[2:01:32] and he was chained. So the pattern
[2:01:36] of the rapture
[2:01:40] was
[2:01:42] already laid out and it was people
[2:01:47] right then the ultimate rapture of
[2:01:51] course was the Lord Jesus rising from
[2:01:54] the dead and being taken up. So he says
[2:01:58] to him, he says, "Go
[2:02:03] be endued with power from on high
[2:02:08] and as
[2:02:10] you see me go, will I come again?"
[2:02:14] So now he sees the believer the patterns
[2:02:19] there that before the believer is
[2:02:22] raptured
[2:02:24] or changed he gets in the life.
[2:02:29] So he he I mean there's several
[2:02:31] statements uh I I was trying to mark
[2:02:34] them all down as I
[2:02:38] as I went uh because he keeps referring
[2:02:42] to it over and over again as this is the
[2:02:46] resurrection. He says this he says what
[2:02:49] a resurrection that was. What a
[2:02:52] resurrection this is.
[2:02:56] So it's present tense. So in other
[2:02:59] words, what the resurrection was was the
[2:03:04] manifestation of the power that was in
[2:03:08] Christ Jesus.
[2:03:10] Its ability to overcome death, hell, and
[2:03:13] the grave. So he's saying that and what
[2:03:16] he had in him to overcome death, hell,
[2:03:20] and the grave, he now makes you the
[2:03:24] beneficiary of it.
[2:03:28] So cuz so then if that spirit's in you,
[2:03:31] it will quicken your mortal body. That's
[2:03:34] right. Oh my
[2:03:37] I could there's so much you could go on
[2:03:38] and on, but we just wanted to leave it
[2:03:40] here this morning just to uh and then he
[2:03:45] makes this statement I believe again
[2:03:48] in uh paragraph uh
[2:03:53] 16. I think I I wrote it down here. He
[2:03:58] said uh
[2:04:01] uh he says it just won't move no matter
[2:04:05] how good the mechanics is until the
[2:04:08] dynamic comes.
[2:04:10] So the church world no matter how good
[2:04:12] it was until Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30,
[2:04:18] and Revelations 10:7 came.
[2:04:21] Okay. The believer just sat there
[2:04:25] with their tank filled.
[2:04:27] They had worked on the mechanics getting
[2:04:30] the church in order. They had worked on
[2:04:33] on getting filled with the spirit. They
[2:04:36] which is the gasoline. But there was
[2:04:39] nothing that came that made it so alive
[2:04:44] to the believer till they realized that
[2:04:47] they could also be participators in it
[2:04:50] and not spectators.
[2:04:55] You see, but when the spirit of God came
[2:04:58] according to the Bible promises
[2:05:01] and and now he identified himself as the
[2:05:05] son of man by standing in front of the
[2:05:08] people
[2:05:10] veiled in a human being
[2:05:15] doing the same works he did 2,000 years
[2:05:17] ago discerning the thoughts and intents
[2:05:20] of the heart telling people who they
[2:05:23] where they came from, what was wrong
[2:05:25] with them, turning his back to the
[2:05:27] audience just like he did with Sarah,
[2:05:29] talking to the church, woman being
[2:05:31] representing the church just like he did
[2:05:34] at the woman at the well.
[2:05:36] Every sign and wonder, the same ministry
[2:05:41] re-impersonated again in our day to
[2:05:45] prove that he's the same yesterday,
[2:05:47] today, and forever.
[2:05:50] He didn't do that just to do that.
[2:05:56] That was given to the elected seed whose
[2:06:01] name was written on the lamb's book of
[2:06:03] life to resurrect them and spark them
[2:06:07] into action.
[2:06:13] But if you don't believe it, you begin
[2:06:15] to look for something else.
[2:06:19] That's what he gave the church to be
[2:06:22] able to see what was promised
[2:06:26] coming to pass and know it was the word
[2:06:30] and to know because that came to pass.
[2:06:34] Every promise in the book is mine.
[2:06:39] And he goes to say he he he says it
[2:06:43] here. He said,
[2:06:47] he says, "And when
[2:06:50] it explodes, it causes the combustion,
[2:06:53] and the combustion moves every motion,
[2:06:58] every move." And he is the same
[2:07:00] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[2:07:04] the
[2:07:05] resurrection.
[2:07:11] The real power of God mechanics with the
[2:07:15] dynamics. Nothing could make it work.
[2:07:19] Now the question is when you see this
[2:07:23] picture of the pillar of fire, it it's
[2:07:27] it's not so much the picture,
[2:07:32] but it's the identification
[2:07:35] of a biblical promise that came to pass
[2:07:39] in our day.
[2:07:44] when you saw the discernment and you
[2:07:46] just saw the things that Trent You saw
[2:07:49] the Do we have that picture? I'm sorry.
[2:07:52] I walking around in circles. I didn't
[2:07:54] know if we had the picture of the cloud
[2:07:55] in the in the building. I know it's in
[2:07:59] the forer, but he said, remember last
[2:08:02] week when that vapor 30 miles high above
[2:08:06] the sky, when we see these things coming
[2:08:09] to pass, we know where we are, right?
[2:08:12] recognize the day and the message. So,
[2:08:14] we say we know where we are. We always
[2:08:17] say the end time, but I'm telling you,
[2:08:20] it's not the fact that we're at the end
[2:08:22] time. There's other signs that tell us
[2:08:25] we're at the end time. Sodom and Gamora.
[2:08:28] This is a sign to us that we can move
[2:08:33] into the resurrection power.
[2:08:39] Not just to have services and incidences
[2:08:44] of praying for the people. The church
[2:08:46] always had that. I'm talking about the
[2:08:48] believer now can walk into an overcoming
[2:08:51] life and know that they've got the power
[2:08:54] in them to overcome every sin and every
[2:08:57] devil.
[2:09:01] Lay down our depressions.
[2:09:04] Lay down our fears. laid down our
[2:09:06] doubts. He's proved us and sparked us
[2:09:11] that this is ours
[2:09:14] to lay a hold of.
[2:09:17] It's not just the end time,
[2:09:20] but it's a time for the believer to move
[2:09:23] into faith.
[2:09:27] Faith for your children, faith for your
[2:09:30] health,
[2:09:32] faith for that which is seemingly
[2:09:34] impossible.
[2:09:36] to move into a new realm
[2:09:40] of life
[2:09:42] and life everlasting.
[2:09:45] Do you love him this morning? Lord,
[2:09:48] richly bless you. I think that that you
[2:09:51] kind of understand what I'm saying is
[2:09:54] it's time for us to resurrect in Christ
[2:09:58] Jesus. You love them. Musicians come
[2:10:01] this morning,
[2:10:03] Billy Bill.
[2:10:10] I know you're certainly I appreciate the
[2:10:13] applaud, but you got to remember we
[2:10:15] wouldn't be nothing without this
[2:10:16] message.
[2:10:19] There's so many of us ministers, so many
[2:10:21] people that have benefited
[2:10:25] from what God did in this day and they
[2:10:28] don't really put the credit where the
[2:10:31] credit's due. I mean, just the I mean, I
[2:10:35] can't I mean, just a I mean, if I just
[2:10:38] showed you my my message, my book,
[2:10:42] it's just like page after page just,
[2:10:47] you know, and I I just I I I just go
[2:10:50] through it and through it. I just can't
[2:10:53] It's just so unbelievable. So, I I
[2:10:56] finally told myself, I'm going to go
[2:10:58] back and start reading the paragraphs I
[2:11:00] don't have marked
[2:11:02] because there's got to be something in
[2:11:04] there I missed.
[2:11:07] It's life, church.
[2:11:10] Eat it. Listen to it.
[2:11:14] It it'll it it'll do more for you than
[2:11:16] you can believe. And you have more power
[2:11:19] in you.
[2:11:23] Everything that was needed was put in
[2:11:26] the seed.
[2:11:28] God put in you everything that you need.
[2:11:33] So I just trust this morning that that
[2:11:37] you may be tired. You may be weary. You
[2:11:40] may look at all your shortcomings,
[2:11:43] but I want you to know this morning that
[2:11:46] there's a God that can overcome your
[2:11:49] shortcomings.
[2:11:51] There's a God that can overcome your
[2:11:53] fear.
[2:11:58] You know, if you've been faithful
[2:12:02] in
[2:12:04] giving your tithing and your offering,
[2:12:06] God promised you you wouldn't beg bread.
[2:12:08] If you haven't been so faithful in that,
[2:12:11] that might be a lot of what your
[2:12:12] problems are.
[2:12:14] Just go back to the ABCs. Go back to the
[2:12:17] basics. Read your Bible. Pray. Lay for
[2:12:22] yourself a pattern of good works.
[2:12:26] Be a Christian.
[2:12:29] Watch your life bloom.
[2:12:32] Watch the joy of the Lord. Hold no
[2:12:34] malice or no hate towards any man.
[2:12:38] Forgive them that despitefully use you.
[2:12:42] Turn the other cheek. If someone compels
[2:12:45] you to go a mile, go twain.
[2:12:50] Don't be worried about the problem
[2:12:54] when you've got the problem solver.
[2:12:58] Cast all your cares upon him, for he
[2:13:01] carth for you.
[2:13:05] Fear not, little flock
[2:13:08] is the father's good pleasure.
[2:13:12] I go to prepare a place for you, cuz in
[2:13:15] my father's house are many mansions. If
[2:13:18] it were not true, I would not tell you.
[2:13:21] And if I go to play prepare a place for
[2:13:24] you, I'll come again
[2:13:26] that you may be where I am also.
[2:13:32] I'm tired of living like the world.
[2:13:34] Aren't you, Lord? Let me get resurrected
[2:13:38] into the resurrection. Resurrection
[2:13:42] before rapture.
[2:13:45] Grant, what are you playing?
[2:13:50] There is a blood. God bless you. Let's
[2:13:53] stand.
[2:13:55] That caused the life
[2:13:59] that paid.
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:07] And when it flowed
[2:14:12] down from the cross,
[2:14:16] my sins were
[2:14:20] my
[2:14:22] [Music]
[2:14:27] think of it.
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:33] his precious blood
[2:14:37] that gave me
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:42] in three days
[2:14:46] he breathed again.
[2:14:49] Hallelujah.

[2:14:55] mighty.
[2:14:59] Oh, I come
[2:15:02] to tell you he's alive.
[2:15:07] to tell you that he
[2:15:11] never.
[2:15:15] [Applause]
[2:15:16] So I come
[2:15:19] to tell you that he sings
[2:15:24] to shout and to procla
[2:15:28] that is coming back for you.
[2:15:33] There is a blood
[2:15:37] that size
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:46] the glory.
[2:15:50] He has the power
[2:15:55] to free the land. Hallelujah.
[2:16:08] So pour it out. Oh, that you this
[2:16:11] morning pour it out on me, Lord. My
[2:16:14] soul. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:19] Hallelujah. Let that liquid glory flow
[2:16:21] glory
[2:16:25] because it is
[2:16:29] to make me whole.
[2:16:33] I owe my life.
[2:16:37] I
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:45] tell you,
[2:16:49] tell you that.
[2:16:56] Oh, you have a cheer this morning. So I
[2:17:00] come
[2:17:02] to tell you that he say
[2:17:06] to shine and
[2:17:10] that is coming back.
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:17] If you need prayer this morning, we're
[2:17:20] happy to pray for you. If you've never
[2:17:23] been baptized
[2:17:25] according to the Bible,
[2:17:31] not just put in water, but to the
[2:17:33] formula,
[2:17:35] repent
[2:17:37] every one of you, and be baptized in the
[2:17:39] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:17:42] of your sins, and ye shall receive the
[2:17:45] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:48] If you haven't ever been baptized in
[2:17:50] Christian baptism,
[2:17:53] the pool is ready this morning for you
[2:17:57] to be baptized.
[2:18:00] If you're sick and body and you need a
[2:18:03] divine touch, now I don't mean this
[2:18:06] morning if you're just, oh, I need to be
[2:18:08] a better Christian. You, that gets taken
[2:18:10] care of in your closet.
[2:18:13] That gets taken care of at your altar.
[2:18:16] But I mean, if you have a need, a
[2:18:18] sickness in your body that you need God
[2:18:20] to help you or a situation, we'd be
[2:18:23] happy to pray with you this morning. Do
[2:18:28] you believe God hears prayer? It's not
[2:18:30] my prayer, it's your prayer. It's not my
[2:18:33] faith, it's our faith. We're a body and
[2:18:37] the body takes care of the needs of the
[2:18:39] other. So, if you need him this morning,
[2:18:41] we want to offer that opportunity. I
[2:18:43] hope no one's sick.
[2:18:46] I hope nobody needs deliverance. I trust
[2:18:49] that you're all baptized and waiting for
[2:18:52] the spirit of God to continue to move in
[2:18:54] your life. God bless you this morning.

[2:19:06] far away.

[2:25:24] Amen. Brother Gary, if you could just
[2:25:25] come and dismiss us this morning.
[2:25:31] [Music]
[2:25:35] Let's bow our heads.
[2:25:38] Dear heavenly father, we just come
[2:25:40] before you once again this morning,
[2:25:41] Lord. Just thankful, Father, that the
[2:25:44] words of eternal life have gone out,
[2:25:46] Lord, this morning. That we could step
[2:25:49] into your resurrection that you've
[2:25:51] called us to, Lord God.
[2:25:53] Father, that we are a part of it before
[2:25:55] the foundation of the world, Lord God.
[2:25:58] That our names were written on the
[2:25:59] Lamb's book of life, Lord. You
[2:26:02] predestinated us to us to this, Lord
[2:26:05] God. May we just be partakers of divine
[2:26:08] nature, Lord, and go out and live this
[2:26:11] purpose that you've called us to, Lord.
[2:26:13] Lord, even in myself, Lord, I'm just
[2:26:15] ashamed of the time that I waste, Lord,
[2:26:18] on the things that are not of you, Lord.
[2:26:20] God, I just ask that you would help me
[2:26:22] to overcome those things, Lord, to seek
[2:26:25] your face and to have a purpose, Lord,
[2:26:27] in my life to do what you called me to
[2:26:29] do, Lord. Whatever that is, Lord, I ask
[2:26:31] that you would bless me and bless these
[2:26:34] wonderful people that have come out to
[2:26:35] the house of God today that Lord,
[2:26:38] whatever affliction, whatever trial,
[2:26:40] whatever thing that is in their life,
[2:26:42] Lord God, there be anything that stunt
[2:26:45] stunting them, Lord, you just said,
[2:26:47] Father, you would move heaven and earth,
[2:26:49] Lord God, for one soul. Lord, we just
[2:26:51] ask that you'd bless us, Lord. May we
[2:26:53] come back out to the house of God this
[2:26:55] evening, Lord, with an expectation that
[2:26:58] you're moving, Lord God, and that you're
[2:27:00] going to touch us and use us, Lord God,
[2:27:02] and deliver us and that we can win our
[2:27:05] family members, Lord God. And Lord, have
[2:27:08] a real impact and a real change, Lord
[2:27:10] God. And
[2:27:14] we just love you, Lord.
[2:27:17] and we want to be a vessel that you use
[2:27:20] and are pleased with, Lord God,
[2:27:24] that we find favor with you, Lord, and
[2:27:29] and can feel your presence, Lord.
[2:27:32] Lord, we just love you. We thank you for
[2:27:34] this day. We ask that you'd be with us
[2:27:36] as we go. Keep us safe. We love you and
[2:27:40] we thank you. In Jesus Christ's name we
[2:27:41] pray. Amen.
[2:27:44] Amen. Amen. God bless you while I
[2:27:47] dismiss this morning.
[2:27:49] The splendor
[2:27:51] of the king.
[2:27:56] Oh, I call in majesty.
