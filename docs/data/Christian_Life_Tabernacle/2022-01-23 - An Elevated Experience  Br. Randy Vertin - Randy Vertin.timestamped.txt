[37:02] yes
[37:03] [Music]
[37:11] is
[37:13] [Music]
[37:22] may god bless you this evening
[37:24] i appreciate the word of the lord and
[37:26] appreciate being in the presence of the
[37:27] lord and amongst believers if we'll just
[37:30] turn in our bibles
[37:32] to second peter chapter one
[37:45] you know there's certainly something to
[37:46] be said for going second on a day like
[37:49] sunday because you kind of it's like
[37:50] cheating on a test almost in a way
[37:52] you're gonna get to glean a lot from
[37:55] you know what the lord's inspiration is
[37:57] bringing and i was certainly
[37:59] blessed this morning
[38:01] by the words that were spoken and very
[38:02] encouraging and
[38:04] it's so uh powerful to me how the word
[38:07] of god
[38:08] you know it's so eternal
[38:10] and it's a paradox how it can
[38:12] the lord can both uplift you and
[38:14] challenge you at the same time with the
[38:16] same word
[38:17] you know and with it's uh with one hand
[38:20] the lord's kind of giving you a spanking
[38:22] and yet at the same time with the other
[38:23] hand he's he's you can feel him pulling
[38:25] you closer to himself
[38:27] and i certainly felt that way this
[38:29] morning
[38:31] we're just going to read
[38:33] verses 1 through 11
[38:37] here and it says simon
[38:39] peter a servant and an apostle of jesus
[38:41] christ to them that have obtained like
[38:43] precious faith with us
[38:44] through the righteousness of god and our
[38:46] savior jesus christ
[38:48] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[38:51] through the knowledge of god and of
[38:53] jesus our lord
[38:55] according as his divine power hath given
[38:57] unto us all things that pertain unto
[38:59] life and godliness
[39:01] through the knowledge of him that hath
[39:03] called us to glory and virtue
[39:06] whereby are giving unto us exceeding
[39:07] great and precious promises that by
[39:10] these he might be partakers of the
[39:11] divine nature having escaped the
[39:13] corruption that is in the world through
[39:15] lust
[39:16] and beside this giving all diligence add
[39:19] to your faith virtue and to virtue
[39:21] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[39:23] and to temperance patience into patience
[39:25] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[39:27] kindness into brotherly kindness charity
[39:30] for if these things be in you and abound
[39:32] they make you that you shall need
[39:34] neither be barren nor fruitful in the
[39:36] knowledge of our lord jesus christ but
[39:39] he that lacketh these things is blind
[39:41] and cannot see afar off and hath
[39:43] forgotten that he was purged from his
[39:45] old sins
[39:46] wherefore the rather brethren give
[39:48] diligence to make your calling and
[39:49] election sure for if you do these things
[39:52] you shall never fall
[39:54] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[39:56] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[39:59] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[40:01] christ
[40:02] and we're just going to turn
[40:04] to one more scripture quickly john
[40:07] chapter 20
[40:09] just one very short scripture here
[40:22] john chapter 20 and we'll read verse 21
[40:31] and jesus said
[40:33] then jesus said to them again
[40:37] uh actually we're going to go up just a
[40:38] little bit i'm sorry
[40:39] we'll read verses 19
[40:42] through
[40:43] 21
[40:45] then the same day at evening being the
[40:47] first day of the week when the doors
[40:49] were shut where the disciples were
[40:50] assembled for fear of the jews came
[40:52] jesus and stood in the midst and saith
[40:54] unto them peace be unto you
[40:56] and when he had so said he showed unto
[40:59] them his hands and his side then were
[41:01] the disciples glad when they saw the
[41:03] lord
[41:04] then said jesus to them again
[41:06] peace be unto you
[41:08] as my father has sent me even so send i
[41:11] you
[41:12] let's just bow our heads in the word of
[41:13] prayer heavenly father as we just come
[41:15] before
[41:16] your word this evening oh god we just
[41:18] pray that oh lord you would break the
[41:20] bread of life to us once again lord that
[41:23] you would draw us closer to you lord
[41:25] jesus lord our desire lord is not to
[41:28] leave here the same as we came in o god
[41:30] but to draw closer unto you lord we know
[41:32] the hour has grown late father we're
[41:34] truly
[41:35] at the end of all things father and we
[41:37] see that time approaching swiftly we
[41:39] just pray o god that you would get glory
[41:42] unto yourself and lord you would speak
[41:44] to your bride this evening father and
[41:46] may you just give her another portion of
[41:48] that rapturing faith that you're
[41:49] building us up to father that you're
[41:51] making us more and more into the thine
[41:53] image oh god we just pray that you would
[41:55] get glory and honor in all things and
[41:57] that your perfect will would be done in
[41:58] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[41:59] pray amen amen you may be seated
[42:04] i've just uh really been meditating
[42:07] you know on a few different things and i
[42:09] just trust the lord will help me to get
[42:11] across the thought the way he gave it to
[42:13] me
[42:17] i didn't really have a title necessarily
[42:19] for the service this evening but i guess
[42:21] the the only little phrase that kind of
[42:23] kept coming to me
[42:26] was just that two words
[42:28] uh three words i guess you'd say but
[42:32] if i was to title it i would i would
[42:34] call it an elevated experience
[42:38] because though you know i think many
[42:40] times because as we heard this morning
[42:42] because of the trials and tribulations
[42:44] that we face all of us being in the
[42:45] flesh the way that we are
[42:47] and so many times it's uh i i believe
[42:50] you probably all agree with me so many
[42:51] times it's hard to look past the mirror
[42:54] in the carnal sense
[42:55] because
[42:56] the the the wonderful revelations we've
[42:58] been given and understanding what the
[43:01] what god has required we're crying of
[43:03] his people and true holiness and
[43:05] and
[43:06] and the perfection as we heard this
[43:08] morning of
[43:10] moving beyond the basics but coming up
[43:12] to a perfection
[43:13] or a completion we could even call it
[43:15] god
[43:16] finishing the work he's begun the good
[43:18] work in you and he's now he's going to
[43:20] be faithful to complete it
[43:22] but so many times we get caught in the
[43:24] in the carnal
[43:26] mind of not being able to look past our
[43:28] own faults and our failures and those
[43:30] different things
[43:32] but when we realize
[43:34] what god's word says about us
[43:38] you know from the very beginning
[43:41] satan's goal has only been one thing
[43:45] and one thing only and that is to get
[43:47] the people of god
[43:49] to disbelieve the word of god
[43:51] that's the only goal he can have because
[43:54] the word of god
[43:56] is life itself
[43:58] he is his word
[44:00] and the word only operates by faith
[44:04] we understand without faith it is
[44:06] impossible that means it's not possible
[44:08] to please god without faith
[44:11] it's not it doesn't take the works that
[44:13] you've accomplished to please god
[44:15] it doesn't take the the perfection with
[44:18] the way you maybe you feel that you've
[44:20] walked
[44:21] over a certain period of time in your
[44:23] life according to the word
[44:24] no but it's the faith
[44:27] in that word of god
[44:29] that is what pleases him
[44:31] and if satan can do anything in your
[44:33] life
[44:34] what he would try to do is make you
[44:36] disbelieve any part of that word
[44:39] because if he could get you to just
[44:40] remember we're going back to a garden of
[44:43] eden condition
[44:44] and if that be the case then satan only
[44:47] needs to get you to disbelieve one
[44:49] portion of that word
[44:51] but the problem is
[44:53] we know that god does not change his
[44:55] mind about his word
[44:57] when he's spoken any one thing
[45:00] that very thing has to come to pass
[45:02] now it may not come to pass in the
[45:04] manner or the time or the the the
[45:06] identification or so that our conroll
[45:08] minds could comprehend or conjure up
[45:11] but god interprets his word by what
[45:13] bringing it to pass
[45:15] even now he's bringing it to pass we can
[45:18] see it all around us i believe we're
[45:19] seeing it in our own lives the battles
[45:22] the trials the tribulations that we're
[45:23] going through
[45:25] and
[45:26] you know it's it's one of those things
[45:29] where
[45:30] because we're trapped in this carnal
[45:33] flesh that we live in
[45:36] that that veil is always dangled before
[45:38] you
[45:39] the the devil is very
[45:41] quick and it's very easy for him to
[45:44] magnify all of the ways that you cannot
[45:48] cope up or uh come
[45:50] to the the place of being lined up with
[45:53] this very word of god
[45:55] because we fall short every day
[45:57] you know even the prophet would tell us
[45:59] that he backslid every day in in the
[46:01] sense that he fell short in things that
[46:03] he didn't want to fall short in we we
[46:05] look at backsliding as as oh that
[46:08] person's just out in the world doing
[46:09] whatever it is no a backslidden
[46:11] condition is just being not living up
[46:14] and not coming to a full acceptance of
[46:17] the word of god for you
[46:19] because when you're in that state where
[46:20] you can't accept the word of god and
[46:22] what he's spoken about you the devil has
[46:25] you right there
[46:26] because we know
[46:28] we have too much revelation to i believe
[46:32] really convince ourselves that we can do
[46:34] it ourselves
[46:36] but if the devil can pull that that veil
[46:39] over your eyes
[46:41] that would tell you
[46:43] that that word that he spoke because i
[46:45] believe the lord has brought us all i
[46:47] believe all of us too far to say to to
[46:50] not believe that god is true
[46:53] or that god does what he says he'll do
[46:56] because we've seen it done
[46:58] we i believe each one of us have
[47:00] testimonies that we can say that god
[47:03] fulfills his word
[47:05] but what the devil what does he try to
[47:06] do he doesn't necessarily try to get you
[47:09] to disbelieve the word in its entirety
[47:12] but what he tries to do is he he tries
[47:14] to
[47:15] pull you out of the picture and say well
[47:17] that's all fine and good but that's not
[47:20] for you
[47:22] how many of you have had that experience
[47:24] you it's easy so many times to believe
[47:27] for someone else i can say maybe brother
[47:29] jackson has a need and it's very easy
[47:31] for me to get down on my knees and say
[47:33] lord i believe for brother jackson
[47:36] but now
[47:37] flip the script and put yourself in the
[47:39] position of need
[47:41] where the trials are pressing upon you
[47:43] where the pressure is building where
[47:46] where time is of the essence and it
[47:48] seems like there's nowhere you can go
[47:50] well then it might be easy for someone
[47:52] on the outside to have the faith in that
[47:54] word but at that moment all of your
[47:56] faults are magnified all of the reasons
[47:59] why it can't apply to you become
[48:02] magnified and the devil says oh yeah god
[48:04] is absolutely true
[48:06] no doubt i mean the devils believe and
[48:08] they tremble but it's not for you you
[48:10] see you you're not part of that bride no
[48:13] that we understand the your prophet told
[48:15] you that that's that's eagle's food but
[48:18] but you're not an eagle so i'm sorry
[48:19] that just doesn't apply to you
[48:22] isn't that you know i want to i want to
[48:24] shine a light on what the devil
[48:26] does to the people of god
[48:29] because we've come too far to completely
[48:31] just say well god isn't real that that's
[48:33] not true it's not true but he'd say well
[48:35] it's not true for me
[48:37] you know what those those nights when
[48:39] you're pleading for a loved one or
[48:41] pleading for a need in your life and the
[48:43] devil's right there and say oh yeah you
[48:45] know that may be true but just it's not
[48:48] for you because of this and he'll give
[48:49] you all the reasons why that could be
[48:51] the case
[48:53] but what god
[48:55] see the more i've been meditating on the
[48:57] word and thinking about things
[48:59] in the word of god the more you start to
[49:01] realize that when christ came
[49:06] he didn't
[49:07] hoard the blessings of god to himself
[49:12] if i could say it that way it wasn't
[49:14] the lord jesus didn't come and say that
[49:17] this blessing is just for me
[49:19] and me alone because only i'd lived a
[49:22] perfect life to attain to it and
[49:24] therefore i hold it unto myself but we
[49:26] understand he's actually shared it
[49:29] with his people
[49:34] what really struck me
[49:36] is is i started to to
[49:39] think
[49:40] it may be just a little bit different
[49:41] type of a service that maybe just more
[49:43] of a talking
[49:44] in a sense
[49:47] just talking these things through
[49:49] as the scripture says come let us reason
[49:51] together
[49:52] you know let's let our reasoning
[49:55] stand upon the word of god
[49:57] and not upon anything that you've
[49:59] accomplished nothing that you've tried
[50:01] to do or failed to do or thought you
[50:03] could do or wanted to do and wish you
[50:05] could do
[50:06] because we all have desires to serve god
[50:09] you know did we not even hear this
[50:10] morning how david had this desire to
[50:13] build a house to the lord
[50:15] it was a good desire it wasn't a bad
[50:17] desire
[50:18] but it wasn't for him to do that
[50:21] and it was it was his humility to the
[50:24] word of god that would allow him to to
[50:27] fulfill the promise of god by coming
[50:31] underneath the umbrella of the word for
[50:34] his time
[50:35] to fulfill that word and that's why
[50:37] while the world would say to our sisters
[50:39] oh you know and the way the world
[50:41] preaches now about what we they call
[50:43] equality and well you know the the women
[50:46] are the same as men and they should be
[50:48] able to do exactly the same things a man
[50:50] can do and all these different things
[50:52] and in the world would look at the way
[50:54] the scripture speaks about it and say
[50:56] well they're trying to hold you down and
[50:58] do these things and you know how the
[51:00] world does has has that kind of those
[51:03] ideas
[51:04] but when you find that you're humbled to
[51:07] the word of god
[51:08] to the promise of god you find that
[51:10] there's an elevated experience to be had
[51:14] when you come to a realization that if i
[51:16] can rest in the promise of god
[51:19] there is nothing
[51:21] that i and myself need to accomplish to
[51:24] bring these things to pass
[51:26] because god will lay he's already done
[51:28] it all for you
[51:30] it's already been done when we read in
[51:33] the in first peter let's just turn back
[51:35] there
[51:36] real quickly
[51:38] and maybe go through a a little bit of
[51:40] this here
[51:44] see the devil likes to make make you
[51:45] think
[51:46] that there's something that you need to
[51:48] accomplish in order to bring about
[51:51] the promise of god
[51:56] but you see when faith anchors
[52:00] when faith truly anchors in the heart
[52:03] it brings forth of itself
[52:06] because it is a very life
[52:08] that brings it forth
[52:10] it isn't it isn't being pushed through
[52:13] that pipe it isn't being forced to
[52:15] happen
[52:16] but life just it just life just happens
[52:20] you know my wife is getting more and
[52:22] more into into horticulture and she's
[52:24] really liking plants and
[52:26] and it really amazes me how you can you
[52:28] can prune a plant or you can plant a
[52:31] seed and for for days or weeks it seems
[52:34] like nothing's there
[52:36] it would seem but as long as that
[52:38] atmosphere was right
[52:40] everything that needs to produce life is
[52:43] already present
[52:45] in the seed to bring forth
[52:48] and while it may seem you know we have
[52:51] these little we have this little thing
[52:52] they call an aerogarden now
[52:54] where it has it has like the little pods
[52:56] with different seeds and herbs in it and
[52:58] it grows in the water and it's got a
[53:00] little light and everything so you can
[53:01] have a little herb garden in your house
[53:03] and that's what we've been doing
[53:05] and and it would seem
[53:06] for a little while after we started you
[53:08] put this little pods in there and it
[53:10] starts to water and you put the plant
[53:11] food on it and the lights shining on it
[53:13] and for days it seems like nothing's
[53:15] happening and then you look down and
[53:17] you're kind of trying to look down in
[53:19] the little the little hole in the where
[53:21] the seed was and after a while you see
[53:23] the little
[53:24] the little the tiniest little thing
[53:26] just this little bit of green and all
[53:28] that brown that and what is it that's
[53:30] life
[53:32] it doesn't look like much
[53:34] to the natural eye
[53:36] but you see if you could get on the
[53:37] other side if we could start to i
[53:40] believe i remember
[53:41] our pastor was talking how if you could
[53:43] step away from the book
[53:46] and start to look at it from the other
[53:48] side
[53:49] you remember when brother david preached
[53:50] that about how if you could step away
[53:52] and look at it from the other side
[53:54] if we could see with the eyes that god
[53:57] sees with see his desire is to give you
[54:01] those same vision that he's got
[54:05] see because when when you know i marvel
[54:08] even in the natural
[54:10] at people who you know there are people
[54:12] who develop property and develop land
[54:15] and there will be a person that we were
[54:17] actually talking about this at work and
[54:19] it struck me they were talking about
[54:20] ross perot i guess he had owned like
[54:23] hundreds and hundreds of acres up there
[54:25] by alliance
[54:26] what they call the alliance town center
[54:28] now and he and he owned all these acres
[54:32] and and he started what he started to do
[54:34] was build up certain things in the area
[54:37] and then he actually
[54:39] invited people to come and move there
[54:42] and give him i think tax breaks and
[54:43] different things
[54:45] and and to try to why because it seemed
[54:48] like nonsense at the time
[54:50] but in the natural he had a vision
[54:53] that in a certain period of time over
[54:55] the course of time of what this would
[54:58] build up into
[54:59] and what it would become and now it's
[55:01] one of the fastest growing places in the
[55:03] metroplex they're building things left
[55:06] and right sprouting up like crazy
[55:09] and but what was it there it was a and
[55:11] this is just the cardinal portion
[55:13] a man that could see a bare bit of
[55:15] ground and has a vision in his mind of
[55:19] what that would become and this was many
[55:21] years ago when this happened
[55:23] and yet he would build these things and
[55:25] how much more god
[55:27] see
[55:29] when you we might look at someone in the
[55:31] natural and see nothing but a barren bit
[55:33] of dirt
[55:34] a barren bit of ground that has no life
[55:36] to it whatsoever but if we could see
[55:39] with the eyes of god
[55:42] to see the end of the thing even before
[55:44] the beginning and see the potential in a
[55:47] seed that might lay there to see that oh
[55:51] it may look like a bare bit of ground
[55:53] now
[55:54] but at the end of the thing it could be
[55:56] a great tree bringing forth fruits unto
[55:58] god
[56:00] and so is it even within ourselves see
[56:04] it's not about our own potential but
[56:06] it's about the potential of the word
[56:09] lived through a vessel that is fully
[56:12] surrendered to the word of god because
[56:16] it's not about the vessel
[56:18] it never was about the vessel
[56:21] because if it was about the vessel then
[56:23] we would have a lot to worry about in
[56:25] keeping this flesh clean
[56:27] in our in our own way to make it look
[56:30] just a certain way to the word that's
[56:32] what the world does they dress up the
[56:34] flesh
[56:35] they dress up their churches they dress
[56:37] up their pulpits they dress up they even
[56:40] dress up their experiences they give
[56:43] them now the the big bands and the big
[56:45] musics and the the educated preachers
[56:48] and the educated speakers to tickle the
[56:50] natural ears to to assault the natural
[56:53] senses
[56:56] even so much with the catholic church
[56:57] that's what draws people in is because
[57:00] remember there is a there's a desire in
[57:02] a man that knows that there is a god to
[57:05] be worshipped
[57:06] that they they know deep down inside
[57:09] that there is a breach that needs to be
[57:11] bridged
[57:13] that there is a gulf that needs to be
[57:15] spanned to get back in fellowship and
[57:17] because satan being that that deceiving
[57:21] angel that he is that that covering
[57:23] cherub that he was so beautiful in his
[57:26] ways he knows how to tease the senses
[57:30] he knows how to tease the eyes and tease
[57:33] the ears and and all those so much so
[57:36] the catholic church people get drawn in
[57:37] because of the pomp and the ceremony
[57:40] i mean we went just recently
[57:43] a little while ago to my grandmother's
[57:45] funeral that happened to be in a
[57:46] catholic church it's the first time i'd
[57:48] ever been in a catholic church that i
[57:50] could remember i think i had probably
[57:51] been in one as a child or something and
[57:54] they went through the whole thing and
[57:55] the stand-ups and the sit-downs and the
[57:58] say something and go sit down and then
[58:00] the people sang and then he got up and
[58:01] did it again and
[58:03] and and to be perfectly honest with you
[58:05] it was kind of i i hate
[58:07] this word maybe seems crude but it was
[58:09] kind of creepy
[58:12] it's very creepy to it was very it was
[58:15] unsettling
[58:17] to see because you can see having tasted
[58:22] of the true word
[58:24] you can see how how people could be
[58:26] drawn in by by a beautiful ceremony the
[58:29] church was just immaculate all this dark
[58:32] stained wood and and just beautiful
[58:36] but there's no life in it
[58:38] it's just a dead letter it's just a dead
[58:41] temple
[58:43] it's a it's a it's a worship experience
[58:46] with no shekinah glory in it no holy
[58:48] ghost to come in and quicken a life
[58:54] but see if we could have the vision of
[58:56] god to see it's so easy to see someone
[58:58] on the street
[58:59] and just bypass it and say well
[59:03] they just they're just a barren bit of
[59:04] dirt it doesn't matter anyhow
[59:06] but if we can have see the scripture
[59:08] said because iniquity would abound
[59:11] the love of many would wax cold
[59:14] and we're seeing that in our day
[59:16] the natural affection between
[59:19] man is is almost gone
[59:21] people won't even
[59:23] wouldn't even stop to help someone on
[59:25] the side of the road because they're
[59:26] afraid they get shot
[59:29] or they're afraid as they're trying to
[59:30] help that person someone else would come
[59:31] and run them over
[59:33] you know we were in our neighborhood i
[59:36] think it was just yesterday i was
[59:38] cleaning out my garage a little bit me
[59:39] and my my father-in-law in there and
[59:41] we're getting and we're just doing some
[59:43] stuff and all of a sudden you hear we're
[59:44] just in a subdivision just a regular
[59:46] subdivision
[59:47] and you hear this what
[59:50] and down the road here comes two
[59:51] four-wheelers just absolutely screaming
[59:54] down the road and my father-in-law uncle
[59:56] tries to go out the sidelines trying to
[59:57] get him to slow down i'm like you gonna
[59:58] get him to slow down because there's no
[1:00:01] natural affection there's no there's no
[1:00:03] uh uh uh natural care for for the
[1:00:07] affairs of others
[1:00:08] well but the life of christ produces the
[1:00:11] opposite
[1:00:12] where he said he said don't look every
[1:00:14] man upon your own things but upon the
[1:00:16] things of others
[1:00:17] that i care how you are i care about the
[1:00:21] state of my brothers and sisters not
[1:00:23] even so much that but i care about the
[1:00:25] state of the unbeliever
[1:00:28] did we not hear this morning where our
[1:00:30] even our lord jesus admonished him and
[1:00:32] said what does it matter you if you love
[1:00:34] if you love each other
[1:00:35] the publicans can do that
[1:00:38] that's a natural affection
[1:00:40] that should come easy to you
[1:00:43] which goes to show sometimes when we
[1:00:45] lack love one for another even within
[1:00:47] the body that there's really something
[1:00:49] wrong
[1:00:50] because if the lord he said if you can't
[1:00:52] love your brother who you do see how can
[1:00:55] you love your heavenly father whom you
[1:00:56] have not seen
[1:01:00] i don't know how i got there but we got
[1:01:01] there
[1:01:02] but now let's just read
[1:01:06] in in second peter chapter 1
[1:01:10] and let's start at verse 3.
[1:01:13] it says according as his divine power
[1:01:17] will give unto us all things that
[1:01:19] pertain to life and godliness
[1:01:21] no
[1:01:22] i purposely misquoted that
[1:01:24] because so many times we're under the
[1:01:26] assumption
[1:01:28] that we're waiting for something a
[1:01:30] future event to happen
[1:01:34] but the scripture says here
[1:01:36] that his divine power hath already given
[1:01:39] us
[1:01:41] all things that pertain unto life
[1:01:45] and godliness
[1:01:47] through the knowledge of him that hath
[1:01:49] called us to glory and virtue
[1:01:51] so the work's already done
[1:01:55] it's so simple brothers and sisters
[1:01:58] if we could see
[1:02:00] what god has spoken about you
[1:02:03] what he's spoken about me
[1:02:06] and just actually
[1:02:09] for once
[1:02:11] really just sit back and accept it
[1:02:14] truly accept it
[1:02:17] regardless of what you think you are
[1:02:20] regardless of where you think you are
[1:02:23] but accept what the word of god has said
[1:02:26] about you
[1:02:27] that you are an overcomer
[1:02:31] he said i've already overcome the world
[1:02:34] he says now you get to overcome the
[1:02:36] world
[1:02:37] he's just uh we've heard that it's just
[1:02:39] a toothless lion he goes out he goes
[1:02:41] about as a roaring lion
[1:02:44] but he's a toothless lion
[1:02:46] the lord's already taken the stinger out
[1:02:47] of death
[1:02:49] he's taken the threat out of the devil
[1:02:55] it's like when joshua
[1:02:59] first began to
[1:03:00] conquer
[1:03:02] and they took those kings
[1:03:05] and he took the heads of the tribes of
[1:03:07] the children of israel and had him each
[1:03:09] step on the necks
[1:03:11] of those kings
[1:03:13] and said do you see
[1:03:15] this situation here
[1:03:18] so will it be to all of your enemies
[1:03:22] and so has it already been to all of our
[1:03:24] enemies
[1:03:26] when christ
[1:03:27] rose from the grave
[1:03:30] he put his foot
[1:03:32] on the neck of the enemy
[1:03:35] he put his foot on the neck of the enemy
[1:03:38] he's already defeated him and now he's
[1:03:40] actually inviting you and saying come
[1:03:44] put your foot on the neck of the enemy
[1:03:47] i've already won the battle
[1:03:50] now i want you to put your foot on the
[1:03:53] neck of the enemy
[1:03:55] because your footsteps is your
[1:03:57] possession
[1:03:59] you can possess the gate of your enemy
[1:04:03] it doesn't matter what the enemy is
[1:04:06] if you step
[1:04:08] onto that land it is now yours
[1:04:12] it could be you know the lost family
[1:04:14] members we talk about all the time each
[1:04:16] one of us have those
[1:04:18] then you step on that enemy
[1:04:20] and you don't let him up
[1:04:23] too many times we step on it feels good
[1:04:26] for a little while but sometimes he
[1:04:28] takes a while to die
[1:04:31] that enemy struggles
[1:04:33] and he's not going to give up without a
[1:04:35] fight
[1:04:36] but you stand there on the promise of
[1:04:38] god because the promise is sure
[1:04:41] he said it is by faith
[1:04:43] that it might be by grace
[1:04:46] to the end that the promise would be
[1:04:48] sure
[1:04:49] to all the seed
[1:04:51] and i want you to notice the progression
[1:04:54] it's by faith
[1:04:56] it's believing in something
[1:04:58] accepting what god said about it
[1:05:01] because true faith faiths final resting
[1:05:04] places where
[1:05:05] in the word
[1:05:07] so when you it's by faith so when you
[1:05:10] can rest your faith on the word
[1:05:13] where there's no question
[1:05:15] because it comes to a point as simple as
[1:05:17] because god said it
[1:05:20] i can't accept it now
[1:05:23] that faith now he says because it's by
[1:05:25] faith now it's by grace
[1:05:28] so now that faith comes in
[1:05:30] grace can take hold
[1:05:32] and now all the excuses that you he used
[1:05:35] to have
[1:05:36] i fell short it doesn't matter because
[1:05:39] faith goes back to the word and says he
[1:05:41] paid the debt
[1:05:44] well i made a mistake faith goes back to
[1:05:46] the word and says well he already
[1:05:48] conquered my mistakes it's in the sea of
[1:05:51] forgetfulness
[1:05:52] so now grace can take hold
[1:05:55] and once grace take hold now the promise
[1:05:58] is sure
[1:06:00] that means it's sealed up
[1:06:02] it's all done it's finished he said to
[1:06:05] all the seed
[1:06:10] it's so simple
[1:06:13] but the devil gets us off track by
[1:06:15] trying to complicate
[1:06:17] and what when we think about oh we must
[1:06:20] move on past repentance from dead works
[1:06:22] and all these things remember it's not
[1:06:25] like brother billy preached this morning
[1:06:26] it's not about moving past that we throw
[1:06:28] it away
[1:06:29] but we can stand upon that foundation
[1:06:32] repentance from dead works
[1:06:34] and and move on in the new and living
[1:06:37] way
[1:06:38] to the maturity of the fact that now no
[1:06:41] matter what comes my way that word is my
[1:06:44] absolute the the the word that i've
[1:06:46] received in this hour
[1:06:48] that told me that i could be just like
[1:06:52] him
[1:06:55] correction to that that i will be just
[1:06:57] like him
[1:06:59] correction even to that that i am
[1:07:01] already just like him
[1:07:05] it's just
[1:07:06] god is waiting upon us to catch up to
[1:07:08] him
[1:07:10] he's at the finish line already waiting
[1:07:12] he's he's your biggest cheerleader
[1:07:16] telling you the work's already finished
[1:07:19] he that endureth unto the end
[1:07:21] endure hardness is a good soldier
[1:07:24] just keep pressing the battle keep
[1:07:27] walking the walk
[1:07:30] because he's already given unto us all
[1:07:32] things that pertain unto life and
[1:07:34] godliness
[1:07:36] all of it it's already been provided
[1:07:39] and even what's more than that it's
[1:07:41] already in you
[1:07:44] he that is in you
[1:07:46] is greater than he that is in the world
[1:07:48] not he that is out there somewhere
[1:07:51] but he that is in
[1:07:54] you now in verse 4 in second peter
[1:07:59] chapter 1 verse 4 says whereby
[1:08:03] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:08:05] precious promises
[1:08:08] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:08:10] the divine nature have you ever really
[1:08:12] thought of just
[1:08:14] that little phrase that you could be a
[1:08:16] partaker of divine nature
[1:08:22] if i could put it into layman's terms
[1:08:24] just our simple english that literally
[1:08:26] would mean
[1:08:27] you could you can be a part
[1:08:30] of god himself the experience of god
[1:08:35] if i could say it in that way that's the
[1:08:36] way my brain i guess comprehends it you
[1:08:38] know
[1:08:40] to be a partaker of divine you know who
[1:08:43] else was a partaker of divine nature
[1:08:45] the lord jesus christ
[1:08:48] who being fashioned as a
[1:08:50] man thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:08:53] with god
[1:08:55] he partook
[1:08:57] of divine nature
[1:09:00] another one we know our prophet
[1:09:04] partaker of divine nature
[1:09:06] and expressed it in creation
[1:09:09] in a spoken word power in a third pool
[1:09:12] ministry in the opening of the word
[1:09:15] but see that's not just for them
[1:09:18] but it is for you to be a partaker of
[1:09:22] divine nature
[1:09:24] god has if we could see the calling
[1:09:27] that god has called us to
[1:09:30] he has called us to be just like him
[1:09:34] he didn't call us to be some cheap
[1:09:37] facsimile
[1:09:39] to be some cheap knockoff
[1:09:42] no because god can't hybrid with
[1:09:44] anything
[1:09:45] when god reproduces himself
[1:09:48] it is god
[1:09:51] it's god in nature it's the same nature
[1:09:55] it's the same potential
[1:09:57] it's the same power it's the same
[1:09:59] authority it's the same life
[1:10:02] it's the same experience
[1:10:06] he doesn't cheat see the devil tries to
[1:10:08] trick the people of god into thinking
[1:10:11] that because maybe you're not a preacher
[1:10:13] or because maybe you're not a pastor or
[1:10:16] you don't do this or you don't do that
[1:10:18] that god has somehow cheated you
[1:10:20] out of an experience with him that
[1:10:22] somehow he's cheated you of a greater
[1:10:25] portion of himself that couldn't be
[1:10:27] further from the truth
[1:10:29] god has given to you
[1:10:31] the opportunity each and every one
[1:10:35] to partake of the very life and nature
[1:10:38] of god himself
[1:10:43] you know why because christ
[1:10:45] this is what i've been meditating on it
[1:10:47] has a roundabout way of getting to it
[1:10:50] but when you think about how the
[1:10:52] attributes god attributes to himself
[1:10:55] he attributes to his people
[1:10:59] he said why do you say that
[1:11:01] we read in john chapter 20 he says as
[1:11:04] the father sent me
[1:11:06] now i send you
[1:11:08] you see you start to see how
[1:11:11] the lord jesus even and throughout the
[1:11:13] scripture he starts to he's elevating
[1:11:17] his people up to a place
[1:11:19] of adoption
[1:11:21] because what was the whole point of
[1:11:23] adoption
[1:11:24] adoption the whole point of adoption was
[1:11:27] so that the father could step back
[1:11:30] and the son could walk forward with the
[1:11:33] same authority in life that the father
[1:11:36] possessed before him
[1:11:40] nothing less
[1:11:42] not not a knockoff not a deluded form
[1:11:45] but the very same authority the very
[1:11:48] same power the very same life that the
[1:11:51] father possessed is now being granted to
[1:11:55] the son
[1:11:56] if i can say now it's being granted to
[1:11:58] the bride
[1:12:02] he said as the father sent me so send i
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:06] you know it may come across as almost
[1:12:08] blasphemous to many
[1:12:10] but when he says that he's putting you
[1:12:13] on equal footing with himself
[1:12:17] as the father sent me
[1:12:20] what did he say he did
[1:12:25] are you all the things that you can
[1:12:26] attribute to christ
[1:12:28] he said as the father sent me so send i
[1:12:31] you
[1:12:33] now
[1:12:34] before you could run off and say well
[1:12:35] that means a sister can preach because
[1:12:37] jesus preached no
[1:12:38] because he's the word
[1:12:40] and it'll manifest according to the word
[1:12:43] the problem is you don't realize sisters
[1:12:45] that you preach every day
[1:12:49] and whether you're a preacher and a
[1:12:50] pulpit or not you preach every day
[1:12:52] that be brother or sister you're a
[1:12:55] preacher
[1:12:56] you're written epistles right of all
[1:13:02] men and i think about
[1:13:09] just some of the and this was just the
[1:13:10] scripture that really stood out to me
[1:13:13] jesus says in john 8 12 let's just turn
[1:13:16] there
[1:13:18] i hope i'm making sense
[1:13:21] see the lord is not calling us to have a
[1:13:24] diluted
[1:13:26] secondhand experience
[1:13:28] that is somehow inferior
[1:13:31] to
[1:13:32] what the prophet had
[1:13:35] somehow inferior to what your pastor has
[1:13:38] or what you know i say preachers because
[1:13:41] because too many the world the way the
[1:13:43] world looks at it is a
[1:13:44] ministers or some idols to be worshipped
[1:13:46] or some rock stars
[1:13:49] that's the way the world does it and and
[1:13:51] i've seen elements of that even within
[1:13:53] the message
[1:13:55] oh boy this preacher's coming we better
[1:13:57] get
[1:13:58] hyped up about it now we ought to be
[1:14:00] getting hyped up about the world
[1:14:03] regardless of who brings it why because
[1:14:06] it could be the little is no-name
[1:14:08] preacher but if your expectation is that
[1:14:10] god will come down
[1:14:12] god will come down
[1:14:15] now that's not to say that the lord
[1:14:17] gives certain gifts to different ones to
[1:14:19] you know maybe be a a special blessing
[1:14:21] in one area or another that could happen
[1:14:23] too but we there's a such a fine line to
[1:14:25] walk
[1:14:26] so john 8
[1:14:28] i say that because
[1:14:30] it's not about it's not about one
[1:14:32] greater than the other this experience
[1:14:34] is greater than this because if it
[1:14:36] doesn't line up with the word it means
[1:14:37] nothing anyway
[1:14:40] if it's not reflected in this word
[1:14:43] if it's not it's reflected in the
[1:14:44] message that we've received which is
[1:14:46] nothing but the the expression of the
[1:14:49] word
[1:14:51] that's all it is we try people we try to
[1:14:53] separate the two but the message is
[1:14:55] nothing
[1:14:56] but the interpretation
[1:14:58] of the word for our day
[1:15:01] just as much as christ's life was the
[1:15:03] interpretation for his day just as much
[1:15:06] as noah's life was the interpretation
[1:15:08] for his day moses's life the
[1:15:10] interpretation for his day
[1:15:12] and now god has called you the bride of
[1:15:15] christ to literally become that
[1:15:18] interpretation for this day
[1:15:21] it just so happens we already know what
[1:15:23] the climax is going to be when a body
[1:15:25] change comes and takes us out
[1:15:30] we know what it is now it's just a
[1:15:32] matter of sticking if i can say it this
[1:15:35] way sticking to the script
[1:15:38] we don't want to ad-lib
[1:15:40] we don't want to improvise
[1:15:42] i want to stick with the script
[1:15:44] i want to stick with the word that we
[1:15:46] received in this hour
[1:15:48] to live according to that because i know
[1:15:50] if i could it just we talked with uh our
[1:15:53] prophet taught us about the blueprints
[1:15:54] if you're gonna build it build it
[1:15:55] according to the blueprint
[1:15:58] i don't care how much that that builder
[1:16:01] building your house
[1:16:02] might have an inspiration and say you
[1:16:04] know what instead of this nice archway
[1:16:06] i'm going to put a vaulted ceiling here
[1:16:09] and when you turn the key to your house
[1:16:10] and walk in and he expects you to be
[1:16:13] overjoyed that you put a vaulted ceiling
[1:16:15] and instead of a nice archway
[1:16:17] you're like well i'm going to get a
[1:16:19] refund you didn't build it the way i
[1:16:21] wanted it
[1:16:23] so how much so god we don't need to
[1:16:25] ad-lib anything he's already laid it out
[1:16:27] for us which is wonderful because the
[1:16:29] planning the architectural that's the
[1:16:31] hard part
[1:16:33] if you could just read the blueprint and
[1:16:35] put a nail
[1:16:36] in there we're good to go
[1:16:38] that's what god is requiring now
[1:16:41] it's just laborers to labor
[1:16:45] to build the house
[1:16:47] he's built he and even then he's
[1:16:48] building the house he just wants willing
[1:16:50] vessels that'll be there to accept it
[1:16:53] john chapter 8 verse 12
[1:16:57] he says
[1:16:58] jesus again jesus spake then speak jesus
[1:17:01] again unto them i am the light of the
[1:17:04] world he that followeth me shall not
[1:17:06] walk in darkness but shall have the
[1:17:08] light of life
[1:17:09] and we also know we don't have to
[1:17:10] necessarily turn there but john 1 in the
[1:17:12] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:17:14] god the word was god the word was made
[1:17:15] flesh we understand it says in him was
[1:17:17] life and that life was the light
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:22] but then i want you to think about how
[1:17:24] god
[1:17:26] see the lord doesn't leave you out
[1:17:28] he's not oh i'm going to go over here
[1:17:32] i hope you can make it
[1:17:34] no
[1:17:34] john 5 14.
[1:17:42] he has neither he says john 5 14 ye
[1:17:45] are the light of the world amen
[1:17:49] ye are the light so in one place he says
[1:17:52] i am the light of the world
[1:17:54] but now he turns around and says ye are
[1:17:55] the light of the world.
[1:17:58] so what is what is the lord trying to
[1:18:00] impress upon us
[1:18:02] being a partaker of the divine nature
[1:18:07] it's not
[1:18:09] again i will reference what we've been
[1:18:11] hearing it's not about being a spectator
[1:18:14] and just basking in the light of it
[1:18:17] but see the lord has tagged you into the
[1:18:19] game
[1:18:21] he says it's time for you
[1:18:23] to get on the field
[1:18:25] see that was the problem with with
[1:18:27] israel in the wilderness
[1:18:29] is they wandered and wandered and
[1:18:31] wandered and when the time came
[1:18:33] to get tagged into the game so to speak
[1:18:36] where the lord says okay let's go over
[1:18:39] it's time to really get serious let's go
[1:18:41] into that promised land and they said we
[1:18:43] can't do it
[1:18:44] and the lord says all right then i'm
[1:18:46] scrapping this team
[1:18:48] i'll keep a couple captains
[1:18:50] and we'll build a new one
[1:18:53] see and that's not going to be so with
[1:18:54] the bride
[1:18:55] no matter what the devil says because
[1:18:57] we've already had a vision by a prophet
[1:18:59] who saw a bride
[1:19:01] who saw a procession of the bride a
[1:19:03] preview and though she may have gotten a
[1:19:05] little bit out of step
[1:19:07] he didn't say they ripped the pot and
[1:19:09] ripped those two out of there and threw
[1:19:10] some new ones in there no they he yelled
[1:19:12] at him to get back in line
[1:19:15] so he can't replace you why because god
[1:19:18] doesn't change his mind about his word
[1:19:21] are you his word
[1:19:22] is his seed in you then you're part of
[1:19:25] the word so he can't change his mind
[1:19:27] about you
[1:19:30] he can't do it
[1:19:31] he cannot do it and remain god
[1:19:35] because he can't change his word
[1:19:38] because he is his word
[1:19:40] so he says i am the light of the world
[1:19:42] and now he comes along and says now ye
[1:19:44] are the light of the world
[1:19:46] so what is it
[1:19:47] it is the lord trying to bring us to a
[1:19:50] place of realizing
[1:19:52] what he's called us to
[1:19:56] we're not going to go too much longer
[1:19:57] here
[1:19:59] you know
[1:20:01] we hear
[1:20:03] we know the scripture
[1:20:05] says ye are the temple of the living god
[1:20:08] know ye not that you're the temple of
[1:20:09] lord
[1:20:11] well when when a person would go to a
[1:20:13] temple
[1:20:15] what are they expecting
[1:20:18] to receive or do when they get there
[1:20:21] they're expecting to hear
[1:20:23] from god
[1:20:25] they are expecting to receive something
[1:20:28] from god
[1:20:30] and see see so the lord makes us without
[1:20:33] excuse because you are the temple of god
[1:20:38] you know
[1:20:40] i had the quote here
[1:20:43] i'll just read this here
[1:20:45] said from be not afraid
[1:20:47] he says
[1:20:49] now
[1:20:50] he don't have no hands tonight but my
[1:20:52] hands and your hands
[1:20:53] he has eyes in mine and yours
[1:20:56] that's what he's using he is the vine we
[1:20:59] are the branches is that right brethren
[1:21:01] the ministers say amen and the vine
[1:21:03] doesn't bear fruit
[1:21:05] the branches bears fruit energized by
[1:21:08] the vine
[1:21:09] and if that first branch that came out
[1:21:11] of the pentecostal vine wrote a book of
[1:21:13] hacks if that tree ever puts forth
[1:21:15] another branch it'll write another book
[1:21:16] of acts because it won't put forth a
[1:21:18] pumpkin and then a watermelon and then a
[1:21:21] pomegranate see it's not a diluted form
[1:21:24] it's not going to produce one thing in
[1:21:26] william branham and then produce
[1:21:28] something
[1:21:29] lacking in you
[1:21:31] i'm so sorry
[1:21:33] god is
[1:21:34] indivisible no matter how much they want
[1:21:36] to try to split them into oneness two
[1:21:37] and his threeness all these little
[1:21:39] variations they have he is indivisible
[1:21:43] the same god
[1:21:45] will give the same experience
[1:21:47] he will give the same life
[1:21:49] he will give the same power and
[1:21:50] authority to overcome the devil
[1:21:53] the question we have now is can we
[1:21:56] accept it
[1:21:57] in the face of all of your faults in the
[1:22:01] face of all of your failures in the face
[1:22:03] of all the pressure that is out there
[1:22:05] now
[1:22:07] i mean you see what they do to people
[1:22:08] that even talk about we know the
[1:22:10] vaccines and all the different things
[1:22:11] that are going on in the political realm
[1:22:13] that's only expressing a little portion
[1:22:17] of what's happening right now in the
[1:22:18] spiritual
[1:22:21] and it's just you know that that devil
[1:22:24] is just chomping at the bit
[1:22:26] to unleash everything
[1:22:28] he can
[1:22:30] hell hath enlarged herself
[1:22:33] it's satan's eating for real
[1:22:36] and we see you know i was talking with
[1:22:38] brother cosman last night just talking
[1:22:40] about these volcanoes you probably saw
[1:22:41] the tonga volcano that exploded
[1:22:44] they said they could feel they could
[1:22:45] supposedly you could feel the shock wave
[1:22:47] in alaska and california they had
[1:22:49] tsunamis in
[1:22:50] california and i just think about how
[1:22:53] brother branham talked about that
[1:22:54] honeycomb and i just think oh they oh it
[1:22:57] didn't look like much maybe a little
[1:22:58] flooding here and there what happened
[1:23:00] underneath the surface
[1:23:02] with that shockwave boom hitting that
[1:23:03] thing just weaken it a little bit more
[1:23:05] just waiting for that day when she just
[1:23:07] breaks off and goes into the sea see
[1:23:09] we're at the time
[1:23:11] right now nature's declaring it the
[1:23:14] whole world's declaring it i believe all
[1:23:16] of our spirits can feel it
[1:23:19] we can feel the urgency but there's a
[1:23:22] roadblock and that roadblock is simply
[1:23:26] our sometimes refusal to just accept
[1:23:29] what god has said about us
[1:23:34] if your sickness
[1:23:35] by his stripes i'm healed
[1:23:37] there's no question
[1:23:40] i'm not telling you to do any certain
[1:23:42] thing or whatnot
[1:23:44] but in your heart it should be settled
[1:23:47] that regardless of what happens from
[1:23:48] here on out i am healed
[1:23:51] the work is done
[1:23:55] you need you need
[1:23:56] the lord to fulfill a need over here
[1:23:58] he'll provide for what you have need of
[1:24:01] he's jehovah gyra
[1:24:03] it should settle right there
[1:24:05] regardless of the circumstance you set
[1:24:08] your face as a flinch and you walk
[1:24:10] forward
[1:24:11] easier said than done in this day and
[1:24:13] age where everything is nothing but a
[1:24:15] billboard of disbelief everywhere you
[1:24:17] look everywhere you think everything you
[1:24:19] hear it's nothing but negativity and
[1:24:21] disbelief the very remember it's
[1:24:23] darkness is upon the face of the earth
[1:24:25] and gross darkness the people
[1:24:28] even so much so to realize though that
[1:24:30] ye are the temple of god
[1:24:32] ye are the light of the world
[1:24:36] there's a reason why
[1:24:38] your co-workers may come talk to you
[1:24:40] sometime maybe not even about the lord
[1:24:42] in that instance but if you could see
[1:24:44] what the responsibility god has placed
[1:24:46] upon us
[1:24:48] to express him to take him at his word
[1:24:51] to
[1:24:52] to give ourselves to him because
[1:24:54] as we're going to read this quote
[1:24:55] brother branham talks you you may be the
[1:24:57] only light
[1:24:59] you will be the only light many people
[1:25:01] ever see
[1:25:03] you will be the only light to be and you
[1:25:06] say well the lord will do something for
[1:25:08] them he did by sending you
[1:25:12] the lord maybe he'll do something for
[1:25:13] him down the line but you're there right
[1:25:15] now
[1:25:16] he has no hands with your hands he has
[1:25:18] no feet but yours no mouth but yours no
[1:25:20] eyes but yours
[1:25:24] we have such a great responsibility
[1:25:29] with what we've been given
[1:25:31] but we get paralyzed
[1:25:33] because we don't fully accept what he's
[1:25:36] actually said about us
[1:25:38] that you are the light of the world that
[1:25:40] you are an overcomer that you are in him
[1:25:49] we'll just read
[1:25:50] there's a little bit of a lengthy quote
[1:25:52] here but we're going to read it's from
[1:25:53] shalom in 1964.
[1:26:00] he said and that's when he made that
[1:26:02] wonderful quotation
[1:26:04] that we have in scripture he that
[1:26:06] heareth he that believeth on me hath
[1:26:08] everlasting life shall not come into the
[1:26:10] judgment but is passed from death unto
[1:26:12] life
[1:26:13] i am the resurrection in life
[1:26:15] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:26:17] dead yet shall he live
[1:26:19] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:26:21] shall never die see never die there's no
[1:26:24] there's really no death to a christian
[1:26:27] death means eternal separation
[1:26:29] and now
[1:26:30] as we as when we are when we die like in
[1:26:33] the physical body as we are now we are
[1:26:35] separated from one another
[1:26:37] but it's really this body is the only
[1:26:39] thing that identifies us to each other
[1:26:42] because we are bound in five senses see
[1:26:44] taste feel smell in here and as long as
[1:26:47] we can see or feel one another why we
[1:26:50] have the evidence that we're here
[1:26:53] if you're blind and you can can't see
[1:26:55] then you can feel one another and we or
[1:26:57] you can hear one another and the earthly
[1:26:59] senses declare one another
[1:27:01] but really frankly
[1:27:03] we have never seen each other
[1:27:05] did you know that
[1:27:07] we have never seen one another you hear
[1:27:09] something speaking out of a body here
[1:27:11] that impersonates whatever it's on the
[1:27:14] inside
[1:27:15] so then when we talk to each other we're
[1:27:17] really not talking to the body
[1:27:20] it's the spirit inside but the body is
[1:27:23] the thing that identifies the spirit
[1:27:25] that's on the inside
[1:27:27] and therefore when we speak
[1:27:29] to each other
[1:27:31] we are quickly can understand right away
[1:27:33] whether we are christians or not because
[1:27:35] there's a fellowship in the spirit that
[1:27:38] we talk from
[1:27:39] you see that it vibrates to one another
[1:27:41] that whether we are christians or not
[1:27:43] therefore we have never seen each other
[1:27:46] now you just think about that
[1:27:48] you ever you ever you ever actually just
[1:27:50] sat there and thought about the fact
[1:27:51] that you really are just a
[1:27:53] a
[1:27:54] soul
[1:27:55] a spiritual being living in a house
[1:27:58] you know when you really actually think
[1:28:00] about it and you're aware of the fact
[1:28:01] that
[1:28:02] i know scientifically
[1:28:05] that light goes into my eyes and and
[1:28:07] that kind of gives my brain a picture
[1:28:09] but there's something
[1:28:11] that goes beyond what science can
[1:28:13] explain
[1:28:15] that that you know that there's you
[1:28:17] the real you
[1:28:19] that's looking out the windows of these
[1:28:21] eyes to see the world and to hear the
[1:28:23] world
[1:28:24] and when you start to really see what
[1:28:25] that is you start to understand why it's
[1:28:28] so important that that you are the light
[1:28:31] of the world
[1:28:32] because we only know each other
[1:28:34] naturally according to this flesh
[1:28:37] but you know
[1:28:38] when you speak to somebody that maybe
[1:28:40] there's a tug there and you can feel the
[1:28:43] pull
[1:28:44] you can see a thirst or a hunger that
[1:28:46] you can't see with the natural eyes but
[1:28:48] the real you
[1:28:50] is contacting the real them
[1:28:53] and there's a communion that can happen
[1:28:55] without anyone a carnal mind would go
[1:28:59] right over the top of it
[1:29:00] could you imagine walking in and seeing
[1:29:03] jesus and the woman at the well
[1:29:05] they just appeared to be having a really
[1:29:07] awkward conversation
[1:29:09] to the natural mind
[1:29:12] oh they're talking about water and
[1:29:13] drawing deep in the well and and all
[1:29:16] these things oh you know are you greater
[1:29:17] than our father or abraham or our father
[1:29:20] that dug this well and all these that
[1:29:21] just seem to have a really strange
[1:29:23] conversation
[1:29:25] and that it takes a real twist
[1:29:27] when the man starts saying you know
[1:29:29] we've had these husbands and all these
[1:29:30] different things
[1:29:32] to the natural mind
[1:29:34] it seems so odd
[1:29:36] but if you could see the supernatural
[1:29:39] you would see there's a communion taking
[1:29:41] place
[1:29:42] there was a bridge being
[1:29:44] there's a gulf being bridged right there
[1:29:47] but from death and life
[1:29:49] that was connecting her to the source of
[1:29:52] all life
[1:29:54] and how are we to know that that next
[1:29:56] person that you talk to see so many
[1:29:59] times the devil tries to get you in a
[1:30:01] place where if they don't end up coming
[1:30:03] to our church and they don't end up they
[1:30:05] don't end up getting baptized in the
[1:30:06] name of the lord jesus and and receiving
[1:30:09] the holy ghost and making a rapture it
[1:30:10] was all for naught
[1:30:12] you don't know
[1:30:13] how many people that you will save
[1:30:16] just by expressing to them the love of
[1:30:18] christ that that will maybe just
[1:30:21] something you said or did or or
[1:30:23] something that they even did to you
[1:30:25] remember a cup of cold water in my name
[1:30:26] won't be forgotten
[1:30:28] that might be the difference between
[1:30:31] life and death to that person yeah it
[1:30:33] may be in a white throne judgment but i
[1:30:35] don't think that they're gonna care at
[1:30:37] that time where it's at they're only
[1:30:39] gonna care that life has been received
[1:30:42] maybe because there was something that
[1:30:44] you might have said in a witnessing or
[1:30:46] just something you told him hey watch
[1:30:48] out you know you may never be a believer
[1:30:50] maybe you don't believe what i believe
[1:30:51] but you better watch out for this
[1:30:53] council of churches coming and you stay
[1:30:55] away from anything having to do with
[1:30:56] that don't join up you might that might
[1:30:58] be the difference between life and death
[1:31:01] to someone at the end
[1:31:03] you just don't know that's why we we
[1:31:05] plant the seeds that's why we shine the
[1:31:09] light
[1:31:10] you don't hold it to yourself
[1:31:12] you don't hold it under a bushel and
[1:31:14] just keep it you don't know who out
[1:31:16] there is lost and groping in the
[1:31:18] darkness could see that light
[1:31:22] and and and take hope and take hold of
[1:31:25] something
[1:31:27] why because it's so easy because we want
[1:31:30] we want to sow
[1:31:31] we want to sow we want to nurse it and
[1:31:33] we want to reap it
[1:31:34] remember he said one planet one water
[1:31:36] then another reaps
[1:31:38] but it's god that gives the increase
[1:31:40] and it's such a stage now where if we
[1:31:42] don't see someone oh you know because
[1:31:44] maybe our experience
[1:31:46] i don't for me my experience was that
[1:31:48] the lord came across the path with the
[1:31:50] word that the message and it was just it
[1:31:52] was like a atomic bomb went off but i've
[1:31:54] seen others that it took
[1:31:56] years it was you know a slow burn to
[1:32:00] burn away that veil that was before
[1:32:02] their eyes but boy you know what when it
[1:32:04] happened
[1:32:05] they got exactly what i got
[1:32:07] and they had ta man it seemed like it
[1:32:09] took them a little longer but they you
[1:32:11] know what whether you run whether you
[1:32:13] jog whether you walk or crawl as long as
[1:32:16] you get to the destination
[1:32:18] that's what matters
[1:32:23] that's why you don't give up on your
[1:32:25] family you don't give up on that loved
[1:32:27] one or the friend that that you've just
[1:32:29] you there's a burden you know how it is
[1:32:30] there's certain people in your life that
[1:32:32] the lord just it's something that hits
[1:32:34] you like a rock
[1:32:36] that it just sinks down in your soul and
[1:32:38] there's a burden for that person
[1:32:41] or those people or whoever it might be
[1:32:42] in no matter what it looks like you just
[1:32:44] can't let it go
[1:32:47] why because
[1:32:48] that's christ in you
[1:32:50] standing in the gap
[1:32:52] just like moses
[1:32:55] see christ is trying to bring you to
[1:32:56] that place where he says now i can step
[1:32:58] back
[1:32:59] and now my bride
[1:33:01] she can walk forward and you know what
[1:33:04] they're and it's not going to be
[1:33:05] anything different
[1:33:07] they're going to see the same jesus
[1:33:08] christ
[1:33:10] that was standing there before that's
[1:33:12] the beauty of the adoption
[1:33:14] it's the same character it's the same
[1:33:16] life it's the same very same in in it
[1:33:22] it just the vessel looks a little bit
[1:33:24] different maybe from the carnal mind
[1:33:28] i'm just going to continue reading here
[1:33:29] as we close
[1:33:31] jesus said no man has seen god at any
[1:33:34] time
[1:33:35] but the only begotten of the father has
[1:33:36] declared him see in other words god was
[1:33:40] identified
[1:33:41] the person of god was identified in the
[1:33:43] body
[1:33:44] the lord jesus christ so he was the
[1:33:46] expressed image of god or god expressing
[1:33:49] himself through an image see through an
[1:33:52] image man
[1:33:53] god expressed himself to us and he was
[1:33:56] god
[1:33:57] not a third person or second person he
[1:33:59] was the person god he was god himself
[1:34:02] identifying himself so we could feel him
[1:34:06] first timothy 3 16
[1:34:08] without controversy that's argument
[1:34:10] great is the mystery of godliness for
[1:34:12] god was manifested or made known in the
[1:34:14] flesh isn't that wonderful god and we
[1:34:17] could never understand god as he moved
[1:34:20] through a pillar of fire and so forth as
[1:34:22] he did
[1:34:23] but we understood him when he became one
[1:34:25] of us
[1:34:26] see
[1:34:27] when he become man then he could talk to
[1:34:30] us and we could feel him handle him
[1:34:32] touch him and everything and as the
[1:34:34] scripture plainly says that we have
[1:34:36] handled god see with our hands touched
[1:34:38] him with our hands
[1:34:40] god is in man
[1:34:43] and he's identifying himself today in
[1:34:45] his church
[1:34:47] in the born-again christian god
[1:34:49] identifies
[1:34:51] himself that he remains god
[1:34:54] see that's what we don't we fail to
[1:34:56] realize it's not it's not brother billy
[1:34:59] and bowie
[1:35:00] expressing himself to someone
[1:35:02] it's jesus christ
[1:35:04] in billy
[1:35:06] expressing jesus christ to somebody
[1:35:10] and if you that's the problem the devil
[1:35:12] oh well you are this and you are that no
[1:35:15] because if it doesn't matter i know
[1:35:17] people that led people to this message
[1:35:20] when they were in a backslidden state
[1:35:22] living with other people in adultery
[1:35:26] because whether or not they look great
[1:35:28] on the outside when the word comes forth
[1:35:32] through and and that and i know those
[1:35:35] people and god has even restored them
[1:35:37] and brought them back to a wonderful
[1:35:39] place but it just goes to show that when
[1:35:41] that seed of god is present and the word
[1:35:45] comes forth out of a vessel
[1:35:47] and expresses not their themselves but
[1:35:51] expresses christ
[1:35:53] it will produce life
[1:35:57] because life produces life
[1:36:00] and i only say that as a testimony to
[1:36:02] the power of god
[1:36:06] why those things happen or you know what
[1:36:08] we put ourselves in those positions
[1:36:10] because we get too stubborn and we kick
[1:36:12] against the pricks and it hurts
[1:36:15] because he said it's hard to kick
[1:36:16] against the pricks it's painful
[1:36:19] but i say that because it's not about
[1:36:22] you
[1:36:23] never has been about you
[1:36:25] god is bringing us to an elevated
[1:36:28] experience to where we understand and
[1:36:30] when you have a full revelation of who
[1:36:32] you are expressing
[1:36:33] oh then you start to line up a little
[1:36:35] bit better because now you realize just
[1:36:37] like the
[1:36:38] the slave that was the son of a king
[1:36:40] you're not representing yourself
[1:36:44] but you're representing him
[1:36:46] and when that love that divine love is
[1:36:48] there it causes you to walk in his ways
[1:36:51] it causes you to line up with the word
[1:36:56] he said god is in man and he's
[1:36:58] identifying himself in the church in the
[1:36:59] born-again christian god identifies
[1:37:01] himself that he remains god
[1:37:04] and the outside world will only know god
[1:37:07] as they see god in you and i
[1:37:10] that's the only way that they'll know
[1:37:12] god
[1:37:13] is when we are written epistles epistle
[1:37:17] of the scripture we are read of all men
[1:37:20] and the life that we live reflects
[1:37:22] what's on the inside of us
[1:37:24] a man see that's where we can't get out
[1:37:25] of it oh you say oh they could do this
[1:37:27] he may have been of excellent condition
[1:37:29] but you know what praise god the lord
[1:37:30] didn't let him stay there
[1:37:33] you know i notice that people think oh
[1:37:34] that just means you can go do whatever
[1:37:35] you want it'll happen
[1:37:37] well maybe maybe so in a you know if
[1:37:40] it's predestinated
[1:37:41] the lord will bring you around but
[1:37:43] you're going to suffer
[1:37:44] brother branham had to learn those
[1:37:45] lessons the hard way i believe each and
[1:37:47] every one of us have learned our hard
[1:37:48] lessons
[1:37:50] of the lord telling don't don't go there
[1:37:53] we say lord surely i can do it
[1:37:56] says okay
[1:37:58] and then when you come crawling back and
[1:38:00] you say lord why did that happen he says
[1:38:01] well i told you
[1:38:03] and you know what you get yourself up
[1:38:06] you dust yourself off why because though
[1:38:08] a righteous man falls he gets back up
[1:38:12] because the grace of god is sufficient
[1:38:14] we don't glory in our in our failures
[1:38:17] i glory in the fact that the grace of
[1:38:19] god can cover them
[1:38:21] praise the lord jesus for that
[1:38:25] he says
[1:38:27] the life we live reflects what's living
[1:38:28] on the inside of us a man is identified
[1:38:30] by the works that he does so our works
[1:38:32] should be good see
[1:38:34] always good because we are representing
[1:38:36] our lord jesus christ
[1:38:38] what a calling
[1:38:41] what a calling
[1:38:43] you've been made kings and priests
[1:38:47] of the temple of god
[1:38:49] the temple of god you are a king and a
[1:38:51] priest of the temple of god
[1:38:55] and when when the lord brings different
[1:38:57] ones across your path to receive of that
[1:38:59] light because he's made you the light of
[1:39:01] the world
[1:39:03] him in you being the light of the world
[1:39:06] then it what is it it's up to the priest
[1:39:09] to usher that person into the presence
[1:39:11] of god
[1:39:15] what a calling
[1:39:17] what a great calling that we have
[1:39:20] sisters with children
[1:39:22] when they come to you and say mama
[1:39:25] what about this what about that you're a
[1:39:27] you're a priest
[1:39:28] in the temple of god
[1:39:30] to now usher your children
[1:39:32] into the presence of god
[1:39:35] to bring them to that truth to bring
[1:39:37] them to that light that is in you
[1:39:41] my that's
[1:39:42] to me it's powerful
[1:39:45] what what a privilege
[1:39:47] what a responsibility
[1:39:49] it all it i feel it has but if it hasn't
[1:39:51] it should sober you
[1:39:54] because what what a responsibility when
[1:39:56] you look at the responsibility and the
[1:39:59] the requirements and the the the
[1:40:01] expectation from the old testament
[1:40:03] priest
[1:40:05] of how they had to live they had to live
[1:40:07] right
[1:40:08] they had to walk right
[1:40:10] they had to do these things
[1:40:13] and that for them without grace
[1:40:15] but law
[1:40:17] but now for us we have those
[1:40:19] expectations as brother branham says
[1:40:21] here the life you're living expresses
[1:40:23] what's inside he said so you should
[1:40:25] always do right
[1:40:27] but by the grace of god even when you
[1:40:28] don't praise the lord there's grace
[1:40:34] that doesn't give us excuse but it ought
[1:40:36] to give you hope
[1:40:37] because every day the devil's just right
[1:40:39] there to try to whisper in you how bad
[1:40:41] you are
[1:40:42] and how everything how everything is
[1:40:44] just upside down that's all right
[1:40:47] that's all right because when he's weak
[1:40:48] i am strong
[1:40:50] his strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:40:54] if if he if he only needed strong
[1:40:58] strong people
[1:40:59] i would have to think that most of us
[1:41:01] probably wouldn't be here
[1:41:04] it's those that can't remember the uh
[1:41:06] our prophet even said he said man god
[1:41:08] helps those who help themselves he said
[1:41:09] god helps those who can't help
[1:41:11] themselves
[1:41:12] and i count myself among them that
[1:41:14] couldn't help themselves but when he
[1:41:16] reached down his hand for me
[1:41:20] oh it looked all well and good when
[1:41:21] peter was walking on the water
[1:41:23] but then when he started to sink all he
[1:41:25] had to do is say cry lord help me
[1:41:27] and the hand reached down
[1:41:31] that's all he's looking for
[1:41:33] but now it's your hand that sometimes
[1:41:34] needs to reach down
[1:41:37] when someone's crying out there in the
[1:41:39] world or someone even in the amongst the
[1:41:41] bodies crying out he's you're his hand
[1:41:44] to reach down and to pull them back up
[1:41:46] again
[1:41:49] we put it all in the pasture we put it
[1:41:50] all in the ministry we put it all on on
[1:41:53] jesus christ but our prophet stood in
[1:41:55] the pulpit and said if christ was here
[1:41:57] right now
[1:41:58] he could do nothing for you
[1:42:00] but what he's already done
[1:42:03] if it be so then it'd be so that way now
[1:42:07] the only difference is now you are the
[1:42:08] vessel that he's using
[1:42:11] or that he desires to use
[1:42:13] to usher people into that presence
[1:42:16] he's made you a king and a priest
[1:42:18] of the temple of the living god
[1:42:23] that's why
[1:42:24] and i i don't want to go too off course
[1:42:26] here but that's why if you look at the
[1:42:27] old testament
[1:42:28] they had to dress a certain way
[1:42:30] they had to smell a certain way
[1:42:32] that's the prayers
[1:42:34] that's the incense the prayers of the
[1:42:36] saints
[1:42:37] they had to dress a certain way that's
[1:42:38] our what's our dress where the word of
[1:42:40] god
[1:42:41] the message of the hour being being
[1:42:43] clothed in it
[1:42:45] the robes of his righteousness if they
[1:42:46] had to walk a certain way talk a certain
[1:42:48] way do a certain thing to exercise their
[1:42:50] priestly duties
[1:42:52] so is it with us
[1:42:53] let's cope up with this word so we can
[1:42:55] express
[1:42:56] the priestly duties he's given to us the
[1:42:58] key you want to you want to have
[1:43:00] authorities a king or a queen that he's
[1:43:02] brought us to because he's promised it
[1:43:04] to you
[1:43:06] then we need to
[1:43:07] walk
[1:43:08] worthy
[1:43:09] of the vocation where you've been called
[1:43:12] walk worthy of the calling that you've
[1:43:14] been called to
[1:43:16] and you can't do it yourself and that's
[1:43:17] all right he's provided a lamb he's
[1:43:19] provided a sacrifice
[1:43:21] but you know what you can do is get in
[1:43:23] that prayer closet
[1:43:25] that's where the lacking is really
[1:43:26] coming in
[1:43:28] brother billy spoke about it this
[1:43:29] morning all the time he said by the time
[1:43:31] you wake up and you get done with work
[1:43:33] and you eat dinner you're waking up
[1:43:35] again the next morning and you don't
[1:43:36] know what happened
[1:43:38] how many of you had that experience i
[1:43:40] have had that experience been having
[1:43:41] that experience at different times
[1:43:45] but i believe i can't remember
[1:43:47] john wesley or one of those old
[1:43:49] powerful saints would say he said i
[1:43:51] found that the more i had to do the more
[1:43:54] i had to pray
[1:43:55] because i knew i found if i prayed when
[1:43:58] i did the things i needed to do i could
[1:44:00] get the right result
[1:44:02] but if i didn't i'd just waste time
[1:44:04] and that's what we ought to do the devil
[1:44:06] says oh you got this on your plate and
[1:44:07] that on your plate and this on your
[1:44:08] plate and that on your plate it may be
[1:44:10] true
[1:44:10] then get before the lord put it before
[1:44:12] him and you'll find that he'll he'll
[1:44:14] make the time
[1:44:16] if you'll make time for him he'll make
[1:44:18] the time for you
[1:44:20] he's the god of time
[1:44:22] he's outside of time
[1:44:26] translate a person from here to that in
[1:44:28] an instant
[1:44:29] and we think he can't make time to you
[1:44:31] got to write that check for that gas
[1:44:33] bill so you can't pray for five minutes
[1:44:36] oh the lord can provide all that you
[1:44:38] have need of if you give it to him
[1:44:41] he says what a wonderful thing
[1:44:44] that is we're closing here just got a
[1:44:46] another little paragraph and a half what
[1:44:49] a wonderful thing that is especially
[1:44:50] when an old man like me stand here
[1:44:53] and think of the life that is fading
[1:44:55] away that's gone in the past
[1:44:57] and we're facing a future of an eternity
[1:45:00] and knowing
[1:45:01] if this life only is what i had hopes in
[1:45:04] i would be a most miserable person this
[1:45:06] morning
[1:45:07] but knowing that this life has only
[1:45:10] been a shadow of what we had to come
[1:45:13] it's a reflection
[1:45:15] because it cannot be the perfect thing
[1:45:17] that god made
[1:45:19] god doesn't make anything that perishes
[1:45:21] see
[1:45:22] god is eternal
[1:45:24] and therefore
[1:45:25] this life that we now live in is only
[1:45:28] reflecting what's ahead of us
[1:45:30] the real one that cannot die
[1:45:33] the body that cannot perish
[1:45:35] the life that cannot be taken
[1:45:38] and therefore the scriptures is right
[1:45:40] when it says that we have everlasting
[1:45:42] life we have eternal life we shall never
[1:45:44] die see because you become when you're
[1:45:47] born again you become a part of god
[1:45:51] see you are forever for eternity never
[1:45:54] to fail
[1:45:56] you're a part of god because you're his
[1:45:58] son
[1:45:59] can we just accept that
[1:46:02] just accept it
[1:46:04] that's what made the faith of abraham so
[1:46:06] powerful is he just
[1:46:09] accepted he didn't think that you just
[1:46:10] know the devil was there saying like you
[1:46:12] were
[1:46:12] you were a baal worshiper an idol
[1:46:14] worshiper over there in irv for all
[1:46:16] those years and now you had this vision
[1:46:18] and saying you're going to go here and
[1:46:19] have a child and all these different
[1:46:21] there's so many things he could point to
[1:46:22] of why it shouldn't be
[1:46:24] but the only thing he knew is god
[1:46:26] promised me
[1:46:27] he says now
[1:46:29] i might take another name and say my
[1:46:31] name is some other name i might take my
[1:46:33] mother's name harvey which would be the
[1:46:35] closest to me in the world my mother was
[1:46:37] a harvey and then i might take the name
[1:46:39] of harvey but still the blood would
[1:46:42] prove that i'm a branham see
[1:46:44] because i'm part of my father and as
[1:46:47] long as i got blood in me i'll still be
[1:46:49] a part of my father see that's right and
[1:46:51] when i'm born of the spirit of god i am
[1:46:54] a part of god that's all
[1:46:56] think about that
[1:46:58] i am identified with him see
[1:47:02] that he
[1:47:03] is my father
[1:47:05] then my life should reflect him as my
[1:47:08] life reflects my earthly father in the
[1:47:10] image that he was in they say i look a
[1:47:12] whole lot like my father so then
[1:47:14] therefore it's his image reflected in me
[1:47:17] and your father reflected in you and
[1:47:19] your parents and so god our father is
[1:47:22] reflected in us when we're born and
[1:47:25] conformed here to his image
[1:47:28] amen let's all stand
[1:47:36] we heard this morning
[1:47:38] little portions of the scripture
[1:47:40] and we know the scripture where it
[1:47:41] declares he says now we see through a
[1:47:43] glass darkly but then face to face
[1:47:46] we've seen the word face to face
[1:47:50] he's revealed himself to you in this
[1:47:52] hour through the message of the hour
[1:47:55] he's unveiled himself
[1:47:58] and now
[1:47:59] there's not see god's not recalling for
[1:48:01] a distorted reflection that's for the
[1:48:02] denominations to do
[1:48:05] that if i could say it this way without
[1:48:06] sounding too sacrilegious their
[1:48:08] reflection of christ is like a fun house
[1:48:10] mirror
[1:48:11] it's twisted and distorted
[1:48:13] it has it has a shadow of the thing
[1:48:17] that was to be reflected but they put
[1:48:19] their own twists on it they put their
[1:48:20] own spin on it but here
[1:48:23] we're looking directly into the mirror
[1:48:25] of the word
[1:48:26] and all we want to see is jesus christ
[1:48:28] reflected in it
[1:48:30] we want to see him reflected in us
[1:48:33] he's called you to be a priest for the
[1:48:35] temple of god
[1:48:39] maybe we should be trying to usher some
[1:48:41] more people into his presence
[1:48:44] by having that presence with us
[1:48:47] by welcoming his presence
[1:48:50] with us every single day
[1:48:54] how many of you want that
[1:48:56] i want that i want to have his presence
[1:48:58] with me every single day i don't want to
[1:49:00] grieve him
[1:49:01] i don't want to push him away at all
[1:49:03] but from the time i wake up to the time
[1:49:05] i go to bed oh it may seem so many times
[1:49:08] in the flesh like i'm running to and fro
[1:49:10] and it feels so hectic
[1:49:12] but if you would just make time for him
[1:49:15] he will make he will literally make time
[1:49:17] for you
[1:49:19] the lord knows you have things that need
[1:49:21] to be done according to the earthly
[1:49:23] things even paul
[1:49:24] went and wrought and made tents and did
[1:49:26] those things but that wasn't what he
[1:49:29] lived for
[1:49:31] we i think sometimes about that story
[1:49:34] brother branham would tell about the man
[1:49:36] that wrote
[1:49:38] rose hogs he said everything you'd talk
[1:49:40] about with that man was hawks
[1:49:42] the time he woke up hog hog song and
[1:49:45] said life is more than harms
[1:49:48] life is more than that job you've got
[1:49:51] life is more than that class you think
[1:49:53] you got to get to at school because that
[1:49:56] education is going to fail anyway
[1:49:59] the money that you're earning at your
[1:50:00] job
[1:50:01] it's all failing as we speak
[1:50:04] it's all going down
[1:50:05] it's all going to be burned what does it
[1:50:07] profit you to gain the whole world and
[1:50:09] lose the soul
[1:50:11] and if i can say it this way what would
[1:50:13] it profit for you to also gain the whole
[1:50:15] world
[1:50:16] while others are losing their souls
[1:50:19] when god's called you to be a king and
[1:50:21] priest
[1:50:22] to be he said i am the light and then he
[1:50:24] comes and says and ye are the light
[1:50:28] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:50:29] prayer heavenly father
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:33] lord jesus our desire lord i believe of
[1:50:35] everyone here this evening
[1:50:38] is to see your very life reflected in
[1:50:40] themselves

[1:50:43] reflected in me
[1:50:45] lord i don't want to have any smudges on
[1:50:47] that that mirror i don't want to have
[1:50:48] any
[1:50:49] blemishes on that mirror i don't want to
[1:50:51] have any of my own twists and turns to
[1:50:54] it to try to conform it to an image i
[1:50:56] think it should be lord but i want to
[1:50:57] have your pure
[1:50:59] unadulterated life flowing in mine
[1:51:02] reflected in me lord
[1:51:06] lord that your scripture said
[1:51:08] let all that you do in word or deed be
[1:51:10] done in the name of the lord jesus
[1:51:12] christ
[1:51:13] lord that when we look back on our days
[1:51:15] that we go through and have to go to
[1:51:17] work and rub shoulders with the world
[1:51:20] the people that we talk to and the
[1:51:22] experiences that we have that lord when
[1:51:24] we get done with the day we could look
[1:51:26] back
[1:51:28] lord and we could see that
[1:51:30] we were doing our best everything that
[1:51:32] we had in us to to reflect you lord
[1:51:36] lord not to put a spin on anything oh
[1:51:38] god but to let your life shine
[1:51:42] in this vessel in this temple
[1:51:45] lord may you just take these each one of
[1:51:48] these temples that's here

[1:51:59] tabernacle may it be with the sprinkling
[1:52:02] of the blood of the lord jesus that
[1:52:04] cleanses from all unrighteousness
[1:52:06] lord may it be as the at the prayer of
[1:52:08] solomon's temple lord when he finished
[1:52:10] dedicating it that the cloud came down
[1:52:13] that the shekinah glory came down so
[1:52:15] thick that they couldn't even minister

[1:52:20] and every one here lord and fill each
[1:52:22] temple that's here lord
[1:52:23] so that is these temples go forth these
[1:52:25] images lord that you've formed in
[1:52:27] natural clay lord go out they can
