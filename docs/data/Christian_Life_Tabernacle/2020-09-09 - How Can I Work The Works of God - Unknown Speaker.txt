[Music] is praise the lord he's so good to us amen that might sound like a simple phrase there's just not enough phrases to describe them amen and praise the lord well i guess we're done all right praise the lord let's just turn in our bibles bro james it's good to see you i thought you were gone well that seems to be the theme lately praise the lord let's just turn in our bibles to john chapter six thankfully y'all could make it out to the house of the lord amen he's the same yesterday today and forever i believe we're looking to the unseen tonight john chapter six verse 26. so jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you you seek me not because you saw the miracles but because you did eat the loaves and were filled so this is uh when after jesus had multiplied the fishes and the loaves and then the disciples had crossed over and jesus had met them and the people went looking for him and they're they're they're saying we looking for you how did you get over here and jesus is saying unto them that uh you're not looking for me because of the miracles but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled jesus says in verse 27 he says labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god and jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent heavenly father we just approach you now thanking you lord for your wonderful love and care we thank you for your word lord just pray that you would come now and you would just have your will and way in the service lord may we all just be in one mind and one accord lord we're the enemy we try to hinder in the name of jesus christ we bind the enemy lord that your holy spirit could just have preeminence lord your bride has gathered together lord and we have a divine promise that says where two or three are gathered in my name that you would be in our midst lord i'm reminded of the disciples on the road to emmaus though they were discouraged they were downtrodden maybe they hadn't seen what had been fulfilled in the word but yet even in that scenario lord you drew near father we know that you are drawing nigh unto us this evening so now lord jesus we surrender ourselves to you the speaker and they hear that you might have your perfect will and way in the service we ask these things in your name jesus christ amen amen you may have your seats and i just was something that struck me as i read this scripture it's where they say how can i work the works of god maybe that we're just rephrasing a little bit that's what i'd like to speak on a little bit is how can i work the works of god and i think that would be the desire of of every believer is to work the works of god you know we maybe when we think of the works of god we we think of the signs and the and the wonders and the miracles and you even think of of the setting of the scripture here and these uh disciples if you will these people that are following after jesus no doubt they've seen the signs and wonders they've seen the miracles and and they're coming to jesus and they're asking them hey what what can we do to work the works of god and maybe on their mind and maybe on our minds when we would think of the works of god we think of the dead being raised we maybe think of the the loaves and the fishes and we think of turning water into wine and the halt and the lame uh standing up and all those things are the works of god and i believe that's what's been promised to the believer in this day as the restoration has come forth with the word that these signs shall follow them that believe and just looking at that scripture as we would just take a little time this evening mark 16 it says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe now something that's very encouraging if you just want to look at the order of god's word is the first step is believing and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so these signs shall follow them that believe and what is he saying this is the work of god that you believe on him who he hath sent and i just want to maybe say in the outset that you know we've we also have been sent you know we believe on him that has been sent but once you've received the message then you're a bearer of the message but you find a lot of people are running without a message a lot of people are maybe just uh following because the the signs and the wonders or the miracles if you were to look at uh the ministry of william branham and and how many people had come for that first pull and that second pull and and no doubt is here uh jesus is letting these ones that are seeking after him no he's telling him look you you you really haven't even come because of the miracles but you're coming because of something that had satisfied you naturally and so many times people are following after a gospel or they're following after a word or they're going to a church because there's some type of natural stimulation or or something intellectually that they can wrap their mind around so they're following after that instead of for the right thing instead of for the pure word of god for the revelation that god would give to you by faith and that's what we want to have as believers is is we want to have a revelation of the word and we want to be following him after the word not just because of signs and miracles or wonders or because some dynamic ministry or even looking to the past and and following after the man william branham because of such a dynamic ministry but what did that dynamic ministry introduce and that's what we want to receive is that message and once you've received that message now you have an obligation just as as william branham the prophet the messenger to the age had an obligation under the call and under the ministry that god had given him was to preach this message and reveal the seven seals and the mystery and introduce the the bride to jesus christ he had a message but he has played his part now and he has gone on but now who who's carrying on that ministry it's the bride of jesus christ now we have that same responsibility to pack this message around the world and to preach the gospel that he's the same yesterday today and forever and we know that as we believe this word it says these times shall follow them that believe and i believe that the church now is coming to the time where we're coming into the unity and we're coming to the harmony that that has been being preached over this pulpit that we're we're starting to see another book of acts that's going to be written but we got to be an expectation we got to be willing to die out and lay everything down or we got to be an expectation and looking at our brothers and our sisters and looking at each one and believing in expectation that man this can happen any moment but we we have to have a revelation of the message we got to be running for a purpose i was just having some fellowship with brother james and we we got to looking into uh samuel and and looking at the time when when absalom you know he had betrayed his father david and and he was running and he got caught there in that oak tree and he was hanging there by his by his hair and and i believe it was uh was it joab i believe it was you know uh he told one of the the the servants to go slay him he said look there the king said no way i'm not going to touch a son because of the the king's word but he he was rough and he went and slayed him anyhow and yet when when joey went to send messengers he went to send messengers unto david to give him a report on how the battle had went there was one ahima's i believe it was that that was willing to run and he was close by and he had seen the commotion and he had kind of heard what had happened and so he felt comfortable in what knowledge that he had gained and so he was willing to run he was eager to do something for the lord and i believe that's a lot of times like we are where we're willing and eager and we want to do something for the lord but oh we need a divine revelation that we can come with that authority that no matter who comes in the way that as a christian we're in the line of duty that way if the satan would come oh we would know where we're standing that we could speak the word and have thus saith the lord because we know that we're in the line of duty just as joshua was able to stand there and tell the son stay still why because he was in the line of duty and i believe it behooves us as sons and daughters of god to have a great revelation and leading of the holy ghost to know that we're in the line of duty and hirohimas he was he was eager and willing to run and yet joab said unto him you're not going to bring tidings this day he said i'm not going to send you but yet he i believe he's told cushy to go ahead and run he said cushy go ahead and run and tell the king what you have seen and so cushy went off and he started running because he he had seen what had taken place he had a first-hand experience he had a revelation that he'd experienced for himself that he could go to the king and testify to him of what had happened but you know ahima's he was he was eager and he was wanting to do something and he kept he kept after a joab i believe it was and and was telling hey i want to run i want to do something too and so he finally said you know what go ahead and run so here he takes off running you know he was a better runner than cushy so he gets out there running and here i i just you know as you may be thinking of the story here's here's cushy he's received the order he's in the he's in the battle for the lord and here he's going and he's got his marching orders and here he's coming and he's feeling good he's in the line of duty and also in here comes this other guy goes right on by him i don't know if they exchanged words or said hey man you're a little too slow i'm going to get the message to the king before you you know it feels like that we maybe feel sometimes like that as believers you know you might feel like people are running on by you and and you seem like other people are being blessed and and you're just trying to do what you know in your heart to do and it's easy to be discouraged but you know the important thing is to keep doing that what you know god has called you to do and i i thought of that you know because she could have just given up he could have said you know what's the point in me running anymore you know he's faster than me he's well more equipped you know i maybe was call i received the order but this get this guy's he's better fit for the job and uh why would i continue running with all my effort and my when by the time i get through the kings can already heard the news and i have run in vain oh you're not running in vain church you're not running in and paying little bride i don't care whatever uh a work of the lord that he has given you oh it might seem small to you it might seem so simple but but but it's it's very important because you're part of the economy of god he's called you to that specific work and and know that you're in the line of duty of being a housewife or or just being a young man or a woman raising up under the headship of your mother and father look there's there's something that god is wanting to express in that season in your life whether you're young boys or young girls or or you're studying and you're in school or you're learning some type of trait or you're a young married couple or or you've been married for a while and and maybe now the kids are coming up every single portion of your life god has a specific interest in in in in manifesting his characters and his attributes and expressing the life of christ and so here here uh he makes it into the palace you know or he's running and i believe the watchman out there he's telling david oh here comes one running and it says it looks like it's the running of ahimas and and uh then they can as he gets a little closer they look off and here comes it there's another one running and i believe king david's like oh yes these are good men they're bringing good tidings so they come into the palace there and ahimas makes it there first and i thought of this you know here he comes into the presence of that great king warrior david and now he's going to bring testimony of the whereabouts of his son and you know he he felt good enough he felt good enough to tell joel hey let me run i saw what was going on but as he was there in the presence of of that king david and the king was asking i imagine there was a presence there you think there was a presence of god around king david oh he was the anointed of god and here he is he's he's speaking to the king and i imagine in that presence when he said hey what what what happened of it with my son i would imagine in the presence that a hemo started to think you know what i speak from this moment on my life could be dependent on it and he started to think maybe you know what i really didn't see with my own eyes what happened i really didn't experience it for myself but i i so-and-so had told me and i i kind of saw the great commotion over there and then i heard the people talking about what had happened and i remember i just i respected those people and i took what they said and and and you know what and now as he's going to give his answer to the king he goes well the truth of the truth of it is is i saw a great commotion you know i i i saw a great commotion and and i wonder if if maybe a lot of people or maybe somebody sitting here is is maybe the commotion around the message has caught your attention maybe you've looked into the signs and the wonders and it's it's so different you know many people that are conspiracy theorists you know they're attracted to things like this because they're so different and so far out of the norm it piques their interests and they start coming around but i wonder if maybe if we've grown up in the church and we've we've gone to the youth meetings and we've gone to the special services and and oh we've had experiences and commotions and we've we've become satisfied with with an experience and just waited until another experience but the prophet of god said that's that that's the problem is people are are are putting their hope and their trust into experiences but he said away with experiences we got to get back to the word what does the word say about it we must believe the word and mary hema is in the presence of the king he said you know i just saw the great commotion and i really don't know what happened and i wonder how many of us are getting by on second-hand revelation how many of us have chalked up the message and we can walk through it intellectually by secondhand revelation because we've heard great teachers we've heard great speakers we've heard a great uh people orientate the word of god a gifted men so gifted that they can make the word plain but oh do you realize we got to take that word we got to take it into prayer and we got to come into a place where it's revealed to you personally i say oh god i i want to know for myself i don't want a second ad revelation but that's the first step is believing this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent the first step is believing having faith in that word of promise but you know that's what paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed i know it's a wednesday night many times we're preaching to the choir sometimes as maybe i i would lean more towards an evangelist you know you cast a gospel net and and praise god at least you get a lot of amens but you know i believe young to old the gospel is still the same have you received the holy ghost since you believed it's it's a sincere question and we need to start looking at the pattern of the word and we need to start looking at our lives and seeing if a resurrected jesus christ is living inside of me this is the time to be sober this is the time to be sincere is while you have the chance not why you're laid up in a hospital not when the squeeze is coming down but while we have a by god's grace a nice little building and we have believers of precious like faith look if you're in bondage why are you going to stay in bondage any longer tonight why because our pride holds us there you'll be in bondage to pornography you'll be in bondage to social media you'll lay there in bondage because pride doesn't want to let your brothers know that you're in bondage because you've been at it a little too long and your pride will get hurt cares about your pride i want to see a resurrected lord jesus amongst us i want to see the power of the holy ghost sweeping through the building i want to see loved ones come to jesus christ and be saved i want to be to see the sick healed i want to see these signs following them that believe but it was our pride holding back the holy ghost from moving in power and demonstration because we're too worried about our self-pride not living a sanctified life look why is it why is it when we get to the top of the mountain sort of so i know we go through valleys but why is it when we we go through rough patches and we we go through hard times and we fall down and and and because there's a predestinated seed that you're gonna get back up you'll always get back up and one day you'll you'll get up for the last time and you'll never go back down but why wouldn't you get back up and you start feeling good do you let off why do we allow that human nature why do why do we get lulled back to sleep to where we're feeling good we're we're feeling the presence does anybody know how it feels to where you could just enter right into prayer you just pick right up where you left off kind of like a love relationship you know you just pick right back up with god but has anybody ever drew back and you go to pray and it's just like man i feel like i can't even pray and you start to realize you know i need to make some things right lord forgive me i haven't been giving you the first place but i believe it's it's the time church where we come into those higher heights and we set our wings and we soar in the heavenlies in christ jesus and keep soaring but what do we do we go back to the daily routines instead of taking that fire and that sword in the and the realms of heaven back into our everyday living and continuing to overcome a possessing the gates of the enemy but then we get lulled back to sleep with with little time wasters oh we got to be redeeming the time but we want to see these same signs and these same wonders we want to see see this power and action in the church why not tonight have you received the holy ghost since you believed look you're a believer praise god that's a step in the right direction but the prophet said so many stop right there he said they stop at the water yeah you're a believer you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ but don't stop there this is the gospel this is the message i say we got to preach calvary like we've never preached it before all the blood is still more powerful than it's ever been he still heals he still delivers he still saves i think of when when i first started serving the lord i pray that oh i just know what it meant to me and i want to see the same thing that's what that's what sets you on fire for god you know you ever tasted something that's really good it's kind of funny you do the same thing with something bad i mean taste this but now you ever taste something really what's what do you want to do with something that tastes really good you want to share it you know like you almost want to share so man you're like oh man no you got to taste this i know there's only one left but you want somebody experience when you experience the grace and love of god you just got to share it with somebody and i wonder oh maybe why we're not sharing the gospel like we should be sharing the gospels because we haven't had the experience that we need we haven't come to the place of a born-again experience oh that house on fire you know like that little brook that brother branham would talk about he would come up to the little brook and say hey little brook little little spring old spring you know what makes you bubble is it is it become the deer come by is it is it because i come and drink he said no no it's not but it's something way down deep inside that just keeps pushing up and praise god when you've been filled with the holy ghost and the baptism of fire there is a well of spring water that's just springing forth from your soul that just keeps pushing you and and overwhelming you and pushing out and bringing you into his presence oh if you haven't had that experience oh you can have that experience not a one-time experience at some camp or or something but an experience where you've met him face to face and it changes you that's what jesus said in john 7 38 he said he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh that's a promise if you believe on him out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water you have something that you can impart you are now the bearer of the message you have the word of life you are now the carrier all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into his bride that's you you are now carrying that very life of god and that very word of god to go out and quick and seeds to life he says in john 4 verse 10 this is the setting at the woman at the well and says jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would us have asked of him and he would have given the living waters oh if you only knew the gift of god my if you only knew the gift of god if you only knew who was talking to you praise god she was about to find out that was the very purpose he came by by her way because jesus christ had come that he might quicken that predestinated seed to life only if oh if you only knew the gift of god you only knew malachi 4 5. you only knew luke 17 30. you only knew if you only knew revelations 10 1-7 well not intellectually no not intellectually but if you knew the true gift of god in the revelation of what god has done in this day and realized that by divine promise that he has come once again jesus christ has been resurrected among us and just like the woman at the well this word this manifesto word by divine promise he has now come to quicken a mini-member bride to life oh that's what it says it says behold i will send you look they use the predestinated we got to take ownership of that what is it sent to do this is what the you know we just look at this and maybe laboring on this we're talking about how can i work the works of god so what does this message come to do we have to believe on the message on him that was sent that's how we work the works of god oh it sounds simple god hidden in simplicity oh what are you driving at matt well you know what i think we really need to dig in and start finding out what we really believe if you really knew the gift of god of what's been delivered well we only come so far we pat ourselves on the back i mean this word is too vast it's too deep it's too rich and if you fall in love with this message it'll take you places you've never dreamed oh and it it'll open up your soul into realms and and truths and bring you into such a harmony and love with jesus christ that oh the only thing you want to do is serve them the only thing you want to do is please them and the things of this world they just don't mean as much as they used to mean anymore and you start to you start to have a heart to put your brother first you have to have a start to have a heart to live for the people around you you start to understand what it means to be sincere and and by god's grace to have a little bit humility oh god teach us humility lord oh we we love the big uh uh uh the big cliche you know words and the big terms and everything and what makes us a a group and a big happy family but what about the down-home rugged living of just being jesus christ and getting below everybody else and just being humble and preferring your brother in humility and sweetness and sincerity you know even when people are wrong you you treat them right and and finding an ability even when you may not agree with somebody and and you're just in yourself you you're not wanting to give them any uh encouragement because you just don't agree with them but when you can completely die out to yourself and with a pure heart find something to lift them up and encourage them that's dying out to yourself that's being jesus christ you don't know what it is to live in their shoes you don't know what they're going through and we can be so judgmental but oh if we could have the life of christ to look beyond all the faults and all the failures and find a common ground and then and then maybe come in there and get under and lift them up and encourage them in the lord oh that's down home liver that's living the life of jesus christ working the works of god to your brothers and to your sisters this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he has sent and it's in believing this message that our hearts are turned back to that original faith we won't be much longer we'll just be really short tonight but i want to say that he's here to perform what he's promised maybe you feel like we've been believing a long time maybe you feel like we've been hearing the same things over and over and over maybe you're going through a season where maybe you just feel like you're not hearing anything new maybe you feel like when you come to church man they didn't say nothing nothing that i didn't already know well you know i think that maybe maybe you're the problem maybe i'm the problem maybe i've been holding up the show we're all in this together church and i'm i'm with all my heart i i want to see the supernatural are you willing to do whatever it takes to start laying down those little things in your life are we going to keep playing church we're going to keep packing around baggage and have brothers and sisters suffering with afflictions and carrying certain things do you realize that you could be the very catalyst that creates a revival in this church if you just get on your knees and you start getting into that atmosphere and you start getting in prayer and you start getting expectation and you let that fire be contagious oh if the church could get in that type of of spirit of prayer and expectation and believing for one another and wanting to see christ in you and christ in you looking beyond the faults and the failures and the indifferences and being an expectation for the fullness of the power of god to sweep into the building oh i believe we're coming into that church i believe there's something we're right at the door if thou canst believe all things are possible he's here to perform what he's promised but i think so many times we we question our own calling i love i love the statement brother branham says in christ the mystery of god revealed he says we got the devil's answer well you know i was reading through that and i said well what's the devil's question i don't know what questions he's asking you but i know a lot of questions he keeps posing to me but he wants you to question your calling he wants to question you to question your position in christ he wants you to question am i the bride he wants you to question all these things where you're at in this walk with jesus christ he wants to do it in such a way to discourage you but as we labor on this and look at it if how do you work the works of god you've got to believe on him whom he said believe what he said believe what he said and i as i thought about this as brother branham keeps going on says we got the devil's answer he starts talking about you're his vindication you're his victory you know when somebody does something you know you might ask him like hey why did why did you go over there and rearrange that over there look it looks like that's not going to work but you when you tell them you know this is why and then you see it working you you you see the justification or the reason they did it and if you look at the the whole bible story about a man named jesus christ and and coming and dying and laying down his life oh somebody would look at that and say man that's a story 2 000 years ago but you realize you're you're the vindication christ in you the hope of glory the very life of the messenger the very malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 1 through 7. where's the vindication of it where is the vindication of it what was that given to do you oh brother brandon says christ in you is the revelation of the whole thing you're the very vindication of this message you're the very vindication of the bible you're the very vindication of christ that he's a living resurrected savior living here right amongst us oh we ought to be of such great expectation i was in fellowship with a brother and he he just uh uh for we we all know him uh just he was sharing us something that happened and he you know his wife has gone on to be with the lord and and he shared this i said brother that's just so inspiring to me and he said oh i had a dream the other night and he said in the dream my wife had come and and we were talking i believe she she said she she was just rubbing my faces and i was surprised you know because the resurrection was on i was surprised during the dream i knew the resurrection was on and i was surprised and she came there and touched on my face she's like and she said to me she goes are you surprised he said yes i'm surprised and she said well weren't you expecting it and the dream faded out and that spoke such depth to my heart what are we expecting church what are we looking for are we just pursuing after our educations and our jobs and and and paying our car note and our bills that all we're doing is expecting to get by all we're doing is expecting to pay the bills one more friday oh we fall into the same trap as the rest of the world but we receive such a powerful message we ought to be in such expectations oh the other day it wasn't too long ago my phone rang and it was it was brother mike mcclowsky and and i don't know i just i was just expecting him to say he's walking i just i don't know it's the first thing i thought i was like man are you walking because i'm expecting it i believe as we we we we die out to all the things of of the world and the church starts coming into a unity and a harmony that we're in such expectations for the supernatural that the devil doesn't even know what to do with us or the prophet said that you can live so close to god that the devil don't even know what to do with you if he said it i believe it i believe on the one whom he sent and that messenger spoke those words to me and by faith i say lord bring me into that place bring all of us into that place oh a mighty invincible army standing upon the word of god that we can stand there and challenge the devil look i have i have a divine commission of the lord to go into the world and preach the gospel and i believe by my faith that if you're sick we shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's not my words that's his words oh he's the same yesterday today and forever this is dangerous to pick up this book christ the mystery let me just read a statement 585 christ is risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed that god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day now we gotta we gotta take this personal he is speaking to you god in this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day glory you see it oh my when i can't stop notice then we stand justified in his presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find the stain of ink no more it went somewhere it'll never come back again and when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it his sins are demolished your sins are demolished look satan keeps trying to hold that fault over your head he keeps trying to hold you down he keeps trying to point to what you did maybe yesterday or one week ago or two weeks ago i want to tell you that by the blood of jesus christ if you have confessed your sins and you have made it right your sins are demolished oh we know sin will not have dominion over you you are justified he says it's gone it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered god forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of god in the presence of god amen and amen now we are the sons of god not will be not will be we are now we are redeemed we have satan's answer god has vindicated himself god has proved himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the headship is here who is here christ the headship the word is here i'm not looking for him to come he has come already and by divine promise he said he is here do you believe it amen christ the risen lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer oh my look at this that's the reason when this man sitting here dropped dead the other day sitting here we could say come back life because the holy spirit said so that's why it could do to that little baby yonder in mexico had been dead for about 15 hours when the vision come and said call it back call it back to life and said let the little baby live and the baby that the doctors wrote a statement died at nine o'clock that morning and 11 o'clock that night come back to life is living today what is it now this this wasn't manifested to be a story in history where we're always looking back now that's the curse of mankind we're always looking back and always looking forward and not seeing what he's doing right now but i believe that this now is it's being manifested right now if we can believe it we can have what we ask for he says what is it not them people the headship and the body has become one unit it's god's manifested it's god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer trained they're one god and his church is one christ in you god's great revelation oh christ in you is god's great revelation glory to god even bearing his name his name is jesus the anointed what does that make you you're the anointed jesus said the spirit of the lord is upon me he was anointed to preach the gospel and the spirit of the lord is upon the bride you're anointed for the job you realize you're anointed for a body change do you realize you're anointed for these signs and wonders to follow we must believe the reason he is called jesus he is the anointed is the anointed body of christ proving manifested god like that body did and that body redeemed ever of this these bodies and through there god works his threefold manifestation going to the kingdom risen paid the price we're redeemed god has proved it vindicated where in you look it's it's not a vindication of a day gone by but it has to become something personally to you i don't want to be a hemas i don't want to be just running uh with a second-hand revelation but no when you've tasted it and you've seen it and you've experienced it i think of those disciples on the road to emmaus oh oh their eyes were withholden but jesus he drew near what did he start to do he started expounding them all the scriptures and it came to a place when he did something familiar oh praise the lord when he did something familiar and he broke the bread and their eyes came open that's that's what the prophet said what restores us back what is it the very message the very thing that we believe what restores us back to that same faith of the pentecostal fathers what is it the prophet said it's these divine revealed mystery truths it's it's those the revelation of those seven thunders that we're laying in those seven seals it's these divine mystery truths and the prophet there the church age book says literally that turn the hearts back we have everything that we have need of look if you can believe it you can have it we are now seated in heavenly places in jesus christ the only thing that would be holding us back is ourselves we just need to get out of god's way we just need to surrender to him we'll just ask the musicians to come we said we wouldn't be too long but maybe just in a simple thought what we're just wanting to encourage you is how can we work the works of god believe on him whom he has sent jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me in to finish the work jesus said i don't do anything but what the father shows me to do now that's not a fancy saying that's not just some some uh a term for us to ponder and wonder but no he he's showing us something he's given us the example of how to live an overcoming life how to live a christian life what are we to do lord lord if if you said you didn't do anything but what the father chose you to do lord how can i do that how can i walk in that i i mean i don't have visions i'm not i'm not a prophet i i don't i don't got that kind of thus saith the lord i i i don't i don't understand lord you you tell me that you don't do nothing but what the father father uh shows you to do and and and i see the life of brother branham and i hear the supernatural things and and the audible voice and the angel of the lord standing there and and leading and turning you every which way but i'm just i'm just hearing lady'll see it trying to do my best to get by i don't understand lord how how can i follow you the same way that jesus christ was giving the example well praise god i got the answer because i believe on him who was sent he said right here this is the this harmony referring to john 5 19 that i do nothing but what the father shows he says this harmony now now let's let's believe this let's own this let's manifest this let's kick the devil out of here i'm not putting this off to tomorrow i'm not putting it off on the prophet but if he said it i believe it this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore there is nothing can harm her not even death i was going to ask sister julia if she could play a song for us i really struck my heart and i just feel to maybe she'd just come and and prepare to do that uh just in my study today i was just overwhelmed by the love of god i think we ought to get back in a love relationship with him yes sir when you're in love with somebody you don't have to beg and prod them and ask them to call and find out where they're at but your very whole existence is just to be with him i say god forgive me for falling out of love with you if if that be where i am lord because you're worth all my time you're worth all my attention lord i think sometimes we maybe been in the battle a little while and we we get down the road a little bit maybe we need to rekindle that love a little bit more start thinking about calvary and that precious blood and what he did for us he says you could even lightly play that song this is he says therefore there's nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this you want to know the secret how can i live a life like jesus the word is in the bride as it was in mary how did it get there he put it there he was thinking of you before he even formed the stars [Music] placed the predestinated seed there the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord we have thus saith the lord we are going in a body change we have thus saith the lord we're going in the rapture we have thus saith the lord we can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover i'm tired of putting it off to the tomorrow i want it now why because that's what the prophet this is the very secret we're always looking back we're always looking forward but what was he trying to show as a resurrected savior jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now then the word is quickened by the spirit and comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he now will fulfill through the bride that work which he left for a specific time [Music] oh my do you love them church was just in my office and just listening to the song that sister julia played i just started to become overwhelmed by by the love of god and looking at where i'd come from brother branham says in perfect faith he says and when we were sinners alienated without god in the world in that muck of mud as i talked about this morning god come to us god sought you you never saw god no man can come to me except the father draws them first and god came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand see he caught me and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when you was unlovable but he changed you just like the color sister said that time in her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but i'm not what i used to be she knowed she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't you love won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is his circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings faith [Music] then it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do how can i work the works of god just believe god and take him at his [Music] word [Music] oh thank you lord jesus [Music] when it flows my sins were gone my sins were forgotten that tried to hide [Music] this in
