[34:14] we just thank you for another
[34:16] opportunity to be here Lord just to be
[34:19] together as a great blessing to know
[34:22] Lord that you use times like this to
[34:24] speak words not just of temporary
[34:27] benefit benefit but of an eternal
[34:29] benefit Lord to your people so we just
[34:31] pray that you come in the cool of the
[34:33] evening now Lord and speak to us once
[34:36] again we pray we love you and ask these
[34:38] blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen
[34:41] amen if you have your Bibles let's just
[34:43] turn
[34:44] into
[34:46] uh John chapter
[34:49] 5 amen
[34:52] we I almost don't want to say it but I I
[34:56] I I'm going to to be short this
[34:59] evening but anytime a minister says that
[35:03] that's the only time I would say you
[35:05] probably shouldn't believe
[35:06] them because they try to be short it
[35:09] doesn't work out too well but we we just
[35:11] um just kind of wanted to share
[35:13] something on our heart um uh um we we
[35:16] had a message we wanted to preach to you
[35:19] um but I just feel that the Lord wants
[35:20] to bring that another time um so we just
[35:24] we just shifted here and and and this
[35:26] morning before Service uh something that
[35:29] was just said that was a fresh
[35:30] inspiration so I just thought we'd talk
[35:32] about that just for a moment and uh by
[35:34] God's grace we'll bring we'll bring this
[35:35] other thought another time so uh just
[35:38] reading in John
[35:40] 5:39 it it says search the scriptures
[35:43] for in them you think you have eternal
[35:46] life and they are they which testify of
[35:49] me amen you may be seated also just
[35:51] turning your Bibles to Psalms
[35:56] 23 I can really hear myself and I like
[35:59] it you know sometimes in a big building
[36:01] your voice gets absorbed into the and
[36:04] you strain your voice but uh I I can I
[36:07] can hear so maybe I can keep my voice
[36:09] for more than a couple days Psalms 23
[36:13] let's reading
[36:15] there I sure like the Psalms and I find
[36:18] out um if if if maybe the book of Psalms
[36:22] hasn't become a treasure to you um it's
[36:27] usually usually in the hard times that
[36:28] the book of Psalms really becomes a
[36:31] cherished book because many of the
[36:34] Psalms David wrote was when he was in
[36:36] dark times and he would say yay though I
[36:38] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[36:40] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[36:42] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[36:44] comfort me thou preparest a table before
[36:47] me in the presence of mine enemies that
[36:49] anointest my head with oil my cup
[36:51] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[36:54] shall follow me all the days of my life
[36:55] and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord
[36:58] forever and I just want to say that um
[37:01] uh maybe for a title I just want to
[37:02] title this they testify of
[37:05] me just bringing that from John 5:39
[37:08] they testify of me and we we know that
[37:11] faith is a
[37:12] revelation and you know Faith really
[37:15] what it does is it produces a reality in
[37:18] the believer's life you know uh we would
[37:20] hear messages preached you know
[37:22] possessing the Gate of the enemy
[37:24] possessing the Gate of the enemy after a
[37:26] trial we we know we have the gates the
[37:28] gates of the senses of the spirit and of
[37:30] the flesh but but there's another a
[37:33] sense and that's the sixth sense of
[37:34] faith and the the amazing thing about
[37:37] faith it has an ability to call those
[37:39] things that are not as though they are
[37:41] and it has ability to see the Unseen
[37:43] where everything is all around you is
[37:46] declaring something else but then faith
[37:48] has an anchor that declares a different
[37:51] reality everything says you're going to
[37:52] fail you're going to die uh there's no
[37:55] way for you to make it this is going to
[37:57] be your end but there's something else
[37:59] that's declaring uh the word of God I
[38:01] would say faith is a revelation that
[38:03] declares another reality and I just want
[38:06] to say that God God loves to test his
[38:09] children you know he allows things to
[38:11] get to a place to where it's
[38:14] impossible and not not with a
[38:17] probability as some would call it you
[38:19] know where all hope is lost
[38:22] 99.999% no he'll allows something to get
[38:25] to a place where like it's just 100 %
[38:27] sorry there there's just no other way
[38:31] you're it's just that's it and you know
[38:34] you can just look through the Bible and
[38:36] and and and find example after an
[38:38] example of the Patriarchs and and
[38:41] Abraham and Sarah and just it's just
[38:44] everything it got to a place where it
[38:45] was impossible and and that's God likes
[38:48] it that way he wants you to get to the
[38:50] place where after all of your trying and
[38:53] after all of your reasoning and after
[38:55] all of your efforts you know you finally
[38:57] say Okay I I can't do it you know you
[39:01] you you know anybody ever lost something
[39:03] and you you search your your your
[39:05] pockets a million times you might as
[39:08] well stop it's not
[39:09] there and you finally say you know what
[39:13] Lord will you help me and really that's
[39:16] what God wants you to get to a place is
[39:18] where you trust him and you're walking
[39:19] with him and and you you wonder why when
[39:22] you look at the children of Israel why
[39:23] would God lead the children of Israel he
[39:25] brings them out by a mighty hand
[39:27] and then he leads them right into a trap
[39:30] you know you know uh pharaoh and all of
[39:32] them be like you know this God had some
[39:34] power but he sure is a poor
[39:36] general you know my you know all of this
[39:39] power he had look what he did he led
[39:41] them and they're pinned uh with their
[39:43] backs against the Red Sea and here comes
[39:45] the Pharaoh's Army coming charging down
[39:47] you know a you would think that would be
[39:50] the time where the Believers would have
[39:51] said oh what's he going to do this time
[39:54] I mean look what he did out there in the
[39:56] wilderness I mean back there in Egypt
[39:57] and and now we're in a place where I
[40:00] tell you brother Billy it's impossible
[40:02] but we serve a god of the impossible
[40:05] right he he and so there should have
[40:07] been expectation there and so God does
[40:09] that in your life and in situations
[40:11] he'll allow you to come to a place and
[40:13] everybody started to murmur and complain
[40:15] and it's amazing how easy it is for us
[40:18] to get our eyes off of God and his word
[40:20] and off the promises and start looking
[40:22] at the circumstance say God did you
[40:23] bring me out here to
[40:25] die that's just the opportunity for God
[40:28] and for Faith to take hold and and
[40:32] brother Brandon would say and be certain
[40:33] of God he says you know he loves to test
[40:35] us he loves to see the reaction of your
[40:38] faith amen did you know that God likes
[40:41] to see how you'll
[40:43] react well sometimes we don't react
[40:47] right and you guess what's going to
[40:49] happen you're going to come right up to
[40:53] the same trial again because inside of
[40:56] you there is is a word
[40:59] reaction but when you're leaning on the
[41:01] Flesh in the ways of man and you
[41:03] continue to try to reason or Justify or
[41:06] you go through a season of of
[41:08] sanctification or you you you come up to
[41:10] a battle and you fall again there is a
[41:12] word reaction by faith which is your
[41:15] victory that if you allow God to be the
[41:18] one living through you that'll give you
[41:20] that victory in your life and so you'll
[41:22] come up and God loves to see how you
[41:24] would
[41:25] react he allows you to get to a place
[41:27] where it seems impossible where it seems
[41:30] like there's no way for you to win and
[41:32] get into a
[41:33] battle I'd like to maybe just give you a
[41:36] quick example of that so I I'm gonna
[41:38] have Weston ha Wyatt come up here come
[41:40] on guys just come up and stand right
[41:42] here yeah there you go right down there
[41:44] that's fine that's fine just hey that's
[41:46] pretty good and I'm I'm gonna ask
[41:47] brother Andrew come on up and hey David
[41:50] you can come on over here hey brother
[41:52] Billy why don't you go down and and join
[41:54] him hey we'll get Gary Gary go go ahead
[41:56] and go on over there and stand over here
[41:58] and hey I I got a good one brother
[42:00] Daniel come on up front come on come on
[42:02] brother Daniel we'll get you involved
[42:03] come on up you go ahead and stand right
[42:05] over here on that side of the eye and
[42:08] face these two guys right y'all are
[42:09] going to come down here y'all go go all
[42:10] over because y'all are in a fight no
[42:13] y'all are in a fight all right there you
[42:15] go all right now look come on down there
[42:17] all right now okay there you go that's
[42:19] good that's good right there you're
[42:20] facing off guys all right this this is
[42:23] the battle right here all right now I I
[42:26] mean I mean
[42:27] who will give me five no who's going to
[42:30] win this fight now let me let me
[42:33] rephrase this now now but but if you
[42:35] look at this who's going to win this
[42:37] fight we all know that if we were
[42:40] talking in the ways of Flesh this is an
[42:45] impossibility this is an absolute
[42:47] impossible task for these uh young men
[42:51] to win this battle but you know I want
[42:52] to paint a different picture right here
[42:54] you know and and this is Weston and but
[42:57] they're going to be love and faith all
[42:59] right and you know love and faith they
[43:01] work together right did you know love
[43:03] and faith work together and right here
[43:05] is standing love and faith and we know
[43:07] that love is God God is love and God is
[43:09] his word and and here's standing love
[43:11] and faith and over here is standing fear
[43:14] and depression and anxiety sorry about
[43:17] that guys I told
[43:19] you but but these are all the armies of
[43:22] the other side a and they're the Boogey
[43:25] men right they're they're they're
[43:27] they're coming to to defeat you uh but
[43:30] you know what I I love about this is
[43:32] that is
[43:34] is when fear comes David's fear now he
[43:37] gots his arms up and he's coming at
[43:39] you but how do you win this
[43:43] battle how does faith and love win this
[43:46] battle when fear comes in we have a
[43:48] promise in 1 John 4:18 that says there's
[43:51] no fear in
[43:53] love but perfect love cast out fear so
[43:57] your weapon is the word and the spirit
[43:59] of the word so when fear comes you don't
[44:02] have to you don't have to beat these
[44:03] guys all by yourself I mean there it's
[44:05] impossible for you to take all these
[44:07] down and put them in a strangle hold all
[44:09] right but if you use the word amen yes
[44:13] how did Jesus overcome he did he could
[44:15] have said the word but he was teaching
[44:18] in one place Jesus said I sanctify
[44:21] myself Jesus didn't need to sanctify
[44:24] himself but he was training and teaching
[44:26] and
[44:28] showing and he said it is written so
[44:32] when all of these big monsters over here
[44:34] start to come and fear is coming in your
[44:35] life you have to say it is written there
[44:38] is no fear and love but perfect love
[44:40] cast out fear and now Andrew the Giants
[44:44] coming oh he's got what are you going to
[44:46] do you look at the word first John 4:4
[44:48] says ye are of God little children and
[44:51] have overcome them because greater is he
[44:54] that is in you than he that is in the
[44:56] world and that giant goes tumbling down
[44:58] to the ground
[45:01] boom when sickness comes he doesn't
[45:04] leave you over here with a sickness and
[45:07] and all of these guys are and like
[45:09] there's no way for me to be well look
[45:12] they're they're already getting
[45:13] scared ain't that amazing you put one
[45:16] down and and now sickness is taking a
[45:18] seat he's saying you know what you know
[45:21] what this must be the same God that
[45:23] whipped us at the Red Sea this must be
[45:25] the same God that whipped us on C
[45:27] could it be that same God that was in
[45:29] Peter that same God that was in Moses
[45:31] that same God that was in John is in
[45:33] these little guys right here and the
[45:35] little guy stands there and also he says
[45:37] he was wounded for my transgressions he
[45:39] was bruised for my iniquity the
[45:42] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[45:44] and by his stripes we are healed
[45:48] Hallelujah that's how you
[45:51] overcome faith and love is working
[45:53] together now I'm not done with you yet
[45:57] all of a sudden Here Comes one of the
[46:00] scariest ones death death is coming what
[46:03] are you going to do in the face of death
[46:05] what are you going to do what does the
[46:08] word say the word says oh 1 Corinthians
[46:11] 15:55 oh death where is thy sting oh
[46:15] grave where is thy Victory but thanks be
[46:18] to God who give us the victory through
[46:21] our Lord Jesus
[46:24] Christ thank you Lord bless and maybe
[46:27] you get looking around and you see
[46:29] ministers and and you you you see
[46:32] deacons and and you see the elders and
[46:34] the devil starts to tell you well you'll
[46:36] never be like them you made a mistake
[46:38] you told a lie to your mommy or your
[46:40] daddy you'll never grow up to be a real
[46:43] Christian that's how the devil
[46:45] works but see how are you going to fight
[46:47] how does faith and love you work
[46:49] together and you take the sword of the
[46:51] spirit and the word of God and when he
[46:53] tells you you you'll not you're not what
[46:56] you should be
[46:58] Philippians 1:6 says being confident in
[47:01] this very thing that he which begun a
[47:03] good work in you oh come on I don't care
[47:06] how how spiritual you've ever felt or
[47:08] how ordained of God and how
[47:10] predestinated and elected you fa there's
[47:12] times you come in your life you start to
[47:14] even question if you're a child of God
[47:17] you start to question do I even have the
[47:19] go Holy Ghost you start to question why
[47:21] am I even here but oh there's an anchor
[47:23] in the soul that says being confident of
[47:26] this everything that he which be done a
[47:28] good work in you he will perform it
[47:31] until the end of the day of Jesus Christ
[47:34] amen give these people a hand God bless
[47:39] you oh the devil starts to come at you
[47:41] and he says you don't have the Holy
[47:45] Ghost you ever been
[47:48] there that probably a good good great
[47:55] chance that you got what he's trying to
[47:57] rob you
[47:59] from but he's clever he'll point to your
[48:03] your mistakes and your failers in such a
[48:06] way where you don't have the Holy Ghost
[48:09] and you say Lord if I don't have the
[48:11] Holy Ghost Lord I want it but I look
[48:13] into your word in Romans 8:30 says
[48:15] moreover whom he did
[48:17] predestinate them he also called lord I
[48:19] know you called me but you said if you
[48:22] called me you also Justified me and if
[48:24] you Justified me Lord I believe you and
[48:27] if you justify me then you've already
[48:30] glorified me Hallelujah your Victory is
[48:33] laying right there in the
[48:38] word but you see it looked
[48:42] impossible I mean that that that's an
[48:44] impossible task an impossible battle but
[48:47] you know when you look at the greatest
[48:48] battle ever fought brother Brandon would
[48:50] say and grab the faith the sword of the
[48:54] spirit thus sayith the Lord and scream
[48:57] Hallelujah you know sometimes I look
[48:59] like a mad man cuz I just I just scream
[49:02] Hallelujah I said I'll be walking
[49:03] through the house or you know the family
[49:05] knows there goes dad again I'll just be
[49:07] going along be
[49:09] hallelujah what are you shouting about I
[49:11] don't even know but Hallelujah
[49:15] anyhow right because it seems like
[49:17] everything's wrong but sometimes you
[49:19] just go to praising God like we heard
[49:20] this morning you know what I fell down I
[49:23] I made a mess of things but praise God
[49:25] anyhow he started the work he's going to
[49:27] finish
[49:30] it thank you Lord scream Hallelujah then
[49:34] cut down every enemy in front of you
[49:36] there were some enemies there but cut
[49:38] them all down there it is cut every
[49:41] enemy an old spooky Spirit making you
[49:43] feel all cut that thing away with what
[49:46] the word of the Lord but our strength
[49:50] the joy of the Lord is our strength get
[49:52] away from me whack you cut him with the
[49:54] word whether it be a demon whether it be
[49:57] an enemy whether it be a sickness
[49:58] whether it be a disease whatever it is
[50:01] take that word and pull that sword
[50:05] that's what I was I was forgetting you
[50:06] were supposed to be standing there with
[50:08] your
[50:09] Bible right using that
[50:12] word pull with the sword and if you
[50:16] whack it the first
[50:17] time and it don't seem to move whack it
[50:22] again and then give
[50:24] up no in that qu brother brand talks
[50:27] about he loves to test his children he
[50:29] said now if if if you if you say Lord I
[50:31] believe you and you're a good God and
[50:33] you healed me and then you don't get
[50:34] better and you say well that's just how
[50:36] he is you know and and you storm off
[50:38] well I guess I'm not a child of God
[50:39] anyways well I guess I'm I'm I'm never
[50:40] going to get healed no he says he can't
[50:43] use that but if you stand there with the
[50:46] word of God and that enemy is buffed
[50:48] against you over and over you hit him
[50:50] with the word and if he don't move you
[50:52] hit him again you hit him again Whack It
[50:55] Again Whack It Again whack it and whack
[50:57] it till you chip the hole through like a
[50:59] little chicken peeping itself or an
[51:00] eagle what you are peep yourself right
[51:03] on through that old Shell of sickness
[51:05] cut your way out and say hallelujah
[51:07] where's the next
[51:10] one amen that's the battle that's the
[51:13] soldier that's the soldier of the Cross
[51:14] yes sir knock every enemy
[51:21] out who's he talking
[51:25] about search the
[51:28] scriptures and then you think you have
[51:30] eternal life look if Jesus did
[51:33] it all right right then you're able to
[51:37] stand and say Search the word of God it
[51:40] testifies of
[51:43] me right so you're called to knock every
[51:46] single one of them
[51:47] out Romans 8:31 says what shall we say
[51:50] to these things if God before for
[51:54] us who can be against us I like how the
[51:59] psalmist said why should I feel
[52:01] discouraged why should the Shadows come
[52:05] why should my heart be lonely and long
[52:08] for heaven and all when Jesus is my
[52:10] portion my constant friend is his His
[52:13] Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he
[52:16] watches
[52:18] me why do you
[52:21] sing because I'm
[52:24] happy I sing
[52:27] because I'm
[52:29] free His Eye Is on the Sparrow and I
[52:33] know that I know he's watching
[52:38] me yeah but you're away from
[52:41] God you send away your day of
[52:44] Grace all of these things are true but
[52:48] you are the one that identifies with the
[52:51] other
[52:54] side no faith and love are working
[52:57] together Romans 8:35 says what shall
[53:00] separate us from the love of Christ
[53:04] shall tribulation or distress
[53:07] persecution famine nakedness Peril sword
[53:11] it is written for thy sake we are killed
[53:14] all the day long we are counted as sheep
[53:15] for the slaughter nay in all things we
[53:18] are more than conquerors through him
[53:21] that loved us for I am persuaded see
[53:24] Faith persuaded
[53:28] it can't be persuaded by anything else
[53:31] Faith's one persuasion is the word of
[53:34] God I am
[53:37] persuaded nothing else can persuade me
[53:41] otherwise for I am persuaded that
[53:43] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[53:47] principalities nor powers nor things
[53:49] present nor things to come there ain't
[53:51] no height there ain't no depth no other
[53:54] creature shall be able to separate us
[53:56] from from the love of God which is in
[53:58] Christ Jesus our
[54:02] lord so go ahead and run your mouth go
[54:05] ahead and criticize go ahead and call me
[54:07] all you want to call me you dumb devil
[54:10] go ahead and be little try to tear down
[54:12] try to point to complexes try to point
[54:14] to the veil try to say this and say that
[54:18] yeah but I can stand like Jesus stood
[54:21] and say search the scripture and them
[54:23] you think you have eternal life but the
[54:25] very one word testifies of who I
[54:30] am faith has to be persuaded in that
[54:34] when you're standing against all
[54:35] opposition because your mind will fail
[54:37] you your feelings will fail you your
[54:40] family can fail you your friends can
[54:42] fail you everything around you can fail
[54:44] you but there's one thing Hallelujah
[54:47] that will never fail the believer and
[54:50] that is the word of God and God is his
[54:52] word and it can never fail I said it can
[54:58] never fail for heavens and earth will
[55:00] pass away but God's word will never pass
[55:03] away search the scriptures they testify
[55:06] of who I am sometimes you just got to
[55:09] put up the mirror in the morning and
[55:11] walk on in and look you're the
[55:14] Rascal you made me fall yesterday and
[55:16] you're going to try to make me fall
[55:18] again but I am called to put you under
[55:20] my feet because that image I see in the
[55:23] mirror is not who I really am my image
[55:25] is in the word of God God because I'm
[55:27] the Bride of Jesus Christ and the Very
[55:29] message testifies of who I
[55:33] am there's
[55:36] faith faith in who you
[55:41] are good we're right on schedule
[55:45] here Jesus said at that day in Christ
[55:47] The Mystery of God
[55:50] revealed Jesus said at that day that's
[55:53] this day at that day when this
[55:55] Revelation is made known you will know
[55:58] that I am in the father and the father
[55:59] in me and I in you and you and me when
[56:01] the Revelation is made
[56:05] manifest I want to ask you where is the
[56:07] Revelation being made
[56:09] manifest at that day you shall know
[56:14] you you me you what this is really
[56:19] testifying of you at that day you father
[56:23] in me and I and you and you and me when
[56:25] the Revelation is made manifest at that
[56:27] day you shall know that I am the father
[56:30] uh that I and the father are one I am in
[56:31] the father and the father in me then
[56:33] when the Revelation comes
[56:36] forth where is the Revelation coming
[56:42] forth we all want to look back and say
[56:44] well that was in in the sheath wave yes
[56:47] well you know there was another sheath
[56:49] wave before brother brandom got
[56:52] here Jesus Christ is the original sheath
[56:55] wve but God wanted to have a
[56:58] family he was just getting
[57:02] started right he was the sheath wave was
[57:05] lifted up there on
[57:07] Calvary and he was wed back to the
[57:10] people on
[57:11] Pentecost but see God by Divine promise
[57:14] promised that he sent a prophet to
[57:15] restore the same
[57:19] faith and when this word is made
[57:22] manifest when this Revelation comes
[57:25] forth not just in the prophet he was a
[57:28] first
[57:29] one but now that same Revelation is

[1:01:54] that that one people they just sit in
[1:01:55] the back over there cuz they're really
[1:01:56] not a Believer who are you to say

[1:02:05] taught me that you you you you you can
[1:02:08] be entertaining Angels una of aware God
[1:02:10] could Veil himself in the grocery store
[1:02:12] clerk you mean God use a person that
[1:02:15] looks like a worldly person well I don't
[1:02:17] know how any more of the world you can
[1:02:18] get than a
[1:02:21] donkey if God wants to speak out of a
[1:02:24] donkey he'll speak out of a if God wants
[1:02:26] to speak out of what you would call a
[1:02:28] painted face jasmel Believe It or Not

[1:02:31] amen that's right he'll use whoever he
[1:02:34] wants however he wants to get your
[1:02:39] attention the question is is are you
[1:02:41] going to accept the
[1:02:43] correction but we get so high and puffed
[1:02:46] up and and so pred that's where we going

[1:02:55] lifted up we don't have the
[1:02:58] life I don't want to go that
[1:03:02] direction we're not using the word to
[1:03:04] lift oursel
[1:03:08] up we use the word to get into our place
[1:03:12] to get into our
[1:03:14] position to do
[1:03:16] battle and I tell you where the bride of
[1:03:19] Christ should really be
[1:03:20] now we should have such a Sanctified
[1:03:23] consecrated life where we're not trying
[1:03:26] to do battle just to keep a Sanctified
[1:03:28] life but we can be like

[1:24:19] know that you are
[1:24:21] special you are the elected bride of

[1:24:29] want you to walk just like anybody in
[1:24:31] the streets he wants you to be to have
[1:24:35] this in mind every day in every battle
[1:24:37] that you go through he wants you to take

[1:24:51] an enemy you know we have someone after

[1:25:04] the one we got to go after amen I love

[1:25:25] through the they sick or they have
[1:25:28] difficulties and whatever is going your
[1:25:30] word will speak into existence a new
[1:25:33] world for them that they can go live on
[1:25:37] it but if we would use it to to try to
[1:25:41] get the all the quotes and to try to do
[1:25:43] this and do that no that's not it's not
[1:25:45] going to be effective that way it's
[1:25:48] going to be effective when we use it for
[1:25:50] healing when we use it for deliverance
[1:25:53] when we use it to come together when he
[1:25:55] use it to bring us together and make us
