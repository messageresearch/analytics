Description:
God's Creative Will
Br. David McGeary
June 26, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

========================================
oil open my eyes to see oh and fill me with understandings [Music] open my eyes [Music] oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] my heart oh [Applause] [Music] amen amen i trust that's a heart desire this morning amen that by the preaching of the word our hearts may be softening it may be filled with his goodness him amen brother mike we invited mike to come and open in prayer and our psalm writing this morning certainly welcome everyone in the house of god and trust you excited to be here this morning amen god bless you [Music] let's go ahead and pray heavenly father that's our prayer this morning lord that we want all that you have for us lord we pray that our hearts would not become fallow lord that our hearts will be softened to receive of your word lord that we be sensitive to your leadership all that you have for us father we thank you for this another opportunity to come together to sit at your feet lord we look forward to lord the word that you have for us lord trust that with each word that goes forth lord you already know what we have need of lord even before we ask it lord we sometimes don't even know what to ask for what we have need for but lord the word has already been prepared lord to deal with hearts and to me needs to provide leadership guidance and instruction lord to transform lives lord we invite your presence here depending upon you to lead in guide and have your way lord from the very beginning to the very end lord may your may your spirit overrule in this place we commit the service to you we pray lord that you meet each need and we lovers 81 this morning and kind of those reading that this week there was just one verse that kind of caught my attention and it's verse 87 when it says they at all they had almost consumed me upon earth but i forsook not thy precepts you know what i was thinking as i read that who are they you know i don't know about you but a lot of times i'll read the scriptures and it'll refer to they or them and just kind of breeze right through that making kind of an assumption of who that is but you know we should be placing all things according to the scripture you know every time the word speaks of they we should be able to identify who that is and place it according to the word you know they in this case in verse 85 are the proud those who dig pits for me those that set traps for me as will read those who persecute me wrongfully those ones david said almost had consumed me in this earth in this earthly realm i got to thinking about that you know pride means to be lifted up to be exalted the exact opposite motion of what the spirit of god does you know the spirit of god is a totally different attribute it's about humbling it's about submitting not lifting up or becoming exalted you know scripturally pride is anything that exalts itself or lifts itself up above the word of god it says in second corinthians 10 5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and in ephesians 4 1 paul describes himself literally as being a prisoner of the word you know rather but you know rather than being brought into captivity or subject to the word you know the proud are they that exalt themselves their lives their agendas their thoughts what they prefer above the word you know i don't have to submit myself to the word it doesn't apply in this situation it you know it's not equitable you know it doesn't matter it's not for me it's just not fair and so they come up with a better way that spirit of the age you know those voices that culture that pressures us to do something besides or in addition to this stand still until i have thus saith the lord you know we live in a whole culture that's building a social norm a social acceptance to do something but wait on the lord they're enacting laws they're making decisions they're hiring leaders they're building accepted rules of behavior all intended to pressure a people from just waiting on thus saith the lord pride exalting itself against the word you know it uh david describes the assault in verse 83 he says that for i am become like a bottle in the smoke that's a good way to describe the age it's smoky it's hard to see it's hard to get direction it's hard to find your way but the thing about smoke you know a bottle was made of flesh in those days is sooner or later it turns it into jerky becomes hard it becomes bitter it becomes unable to absorb water as we just sang about in the song you know it's as i was reading that you know he says once again in verse 87 they had almost consumed me upon earth but i forsook not thy precepts almost but not quite almost you know i was reminded of something jesus told his disciples matthew 24 22 except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake those days should be shortened the pressure to do something besides or something except thus saith the lord will get to such a place where the lord will have to shorten the days you know we believe that when the last one is saved we'll all be going home but that will also be the hour of maximum pressure the maximum pressure to do something besides thus saith the lord jesus said also in verse 12 of matthew 24 and because iniquity everyone doing their own way shall abound be everywhere the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure to the end he shall be saved as david said in psalm 119 87 they had almost consumed me but i forsook not thy precepts you know none of us can physically cling to the word or discipline ourselves according to the word enough to withstand the pressure no amount of reading no amount of studying no amount of church services or sermons no amount of books or tapes can cause you to withstand the maximum pressure of doing something besides the word or accept the word you know david had the key to what that was and it's in verse 88 quicken me after thy loving kindness so shall i keep the testimony of thy mouth that's how i'll withstand the pressure to not do something besides or accept the word you know it doesn't matter how much you study the scriptures it doesn't matter how much you memorize doesn't matter how many church services you go to how many believers you surround yourself with it doesn't even matter how much you press play if that quickening doesn't happen you cannot withstand the pressure only by you know the lord quickens an age and he has he quickens the church and he does but he's got to quicken you he's got to quicken me or you cannot withstand the pressure of the pride only by that can you endure to the end it was interesting that david of all people recognized to this key do you know that he is the only person that ever uses that word quicken in the entire old testament nobody that's not a word old testament people used but david used it all the time in fact almost every single time he used it was in psalm 119 recognizing the importance of a personal quickening of the word to withstand the pressure so you know as we read this this morning you know my prayer is quick and thou me according to the word to withstand the pressure of the prideful age that we live in so let's go ahead and read those verses verse 81 to 88 together my soul fainteth for thy salvation but i hope in thy word mine eyes fail for thy word saying when wilt thou comfort me for i am become like a bottle in the smoke yet do i not forget thy statues how many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me the proud have dig pits for me which are not after thy law all thy commandments are faithful they persecute me wrongfully help thou me they had almost consumed me upon earth but i forsook not thy precepts quick in me after thy loving kindness so shall i keep the testimony of thy mouth amen god bless you have your seats come and sing oh jesus blind can make you free [Music] and i know yes i know [Music] yes [Music] [Music] oh [Music] for us [Music] and i know yes i know [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

have in christ amen you meant what adam is especially if it could come at this time amen god bless you saint um before i sing my song i would just like to give a short testimony yesterday i turned 25 year old and when i look back at my life and when i look at what god has done for me before i was born my parent lost two children just before me and i was the first to come and just a few weeks after i was born i died and my mom couldn't take it it was very hard on her and she called every pastor she could think of and they came as a baby they tell me the story so i wasn't there and they they called every pastor that could think of and they prayed for several hours then i came back and after that i spent most of my life in the hospital bed in and out of the hospital it started off with just something simple then something else happens then another thing i had a surgery in my head and it was just up and down i had to get special teachers at home to be teaching me so i can be caught up with schoolwork and i had many diseases i can think of i even had a skin condition that i visited almost every dermatologist i know that was really good in the congo i also traveled to uganda and east africa to try to find solution but nothing i came to the u.s even i went to many dermatologists same thing but now i'm standing here about 90 of that is gone and just to think i'm standing now

energy because i know really where i come from i know i wouldn't be here and happening and i found myself keep on praying i say that god if i can just be healthy if i can just be like normal like other kids attend school every time that i would decide to work on something that will help a lot of people millions of people i would try my best to do anything that will help people and i'm standing at 25 year old i'm almost getting my phd and at the same time i'm running an organization that is really helping a lot of people and i just i just thank god and i praise god for for just being alive

a way and i'm standing here only because you made away [Music] now i'm here looking back on where i come from because of you and i think i've done to deserve their love and mercy you've shown your grace is strong enough to pick me up and you made away and my back was against the wall and it looked as if it was over you [Music] you made a way when my back was against the wall and it looked as if

it looked as if it was over you made away [Music] and i'm standing here holy because you made a way god bless you [Applause] man aren't you glad he made a way amen if he had not been for the lord amen the psalm says bless the lord o my soul forget all these benefits who forgiveth all thy iniquity and healeth all that diseases amen we're thankful that he's able to make a way amen sister yes senior writes i asked prayer for my cousin louis rajas he said that the mercy of the lord take him out of the darkness that he's in because there's nothing impossible to him to god amen also reported john stefan writes please keep my mother-in-law in prayer her name is marta she is sick and so much pain please pray that god forgot to give her strength and courage that she waits on the healing amen i

you that's just how it is i'm sorry but that's how we feel about it so jenna god bless you so her and ben will be married this thursday so uh we we just think it's wonderful so lord bless you musicians god bless you uh this morning a lot of great changes uh going on before we stand and read our scripture this morning you know god's got really great ways of doing things and sometimes you come across things and and you you're going to preach the word of god and god gives you a message to preach and it looks like i can't preach this you know what i mean it's got so many directions in so many ways and and it can be taken so wrong and you just sit there and quiver you know and and you go back and you read it again and you pray about it again and you try to change it up a little you know you want to add some sugar to it add a little spice you know i always love going in the kitchen when leslie's cooking and maybe add a little salt or a little something and taste it and then say it's perfect like i made it you know and she bears with me and she would rather have me do that than cook because i'm a good cook but i don't know how to clean up and so you know when i get done cooking it takes a half hour to clean the stove but so anyway i'm reading this and and i'm i'm reading this part of the sermon and i look and um i said leslie listen to this and she's in bed and she's got her headsets on and i say listen to this and i read a quote to her and she flies up and she says what did you just read i said she said what are you reading from and i said the reproach for the cause of the word she said i'm reading the exact same quote right now and that just kind of let me know the spirit of the lord was there and it just encouraged me to go ahead and preach this morning i hope that everybody can take it in a real positive positive way and that we can look at the things that our messenger spoke to us and i hope it's a blessing to you this morning i prayed all morning and that whatever lord i just want to preach this in the right spirit for the right purpose so i i hope it's a a a blessing to you so let's stand this morning and open our bibles to psalm um 89 and we want to start in the 51st verse and uh read this uh the verse of uh scripture found here in in this this psalm and it reads as this remember lord the reproach of thy servant how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all thy mighty people wherewith thine enemies have reproached oh lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thy anointed blessed be the lord forevermore amen and amen father we ask you to bless your word to us in jesus name we pray amen you may be seated we're going to be reading and taking our thought this morning from the message caused the reproach for the cause of the word the reproach for the cause of the word and and as i read i'm going to read start with paragraph 77 and i want you to listen this morning as we read these quotes and understand the first part of what god is making clear to us and our messenger is making clear to us is that god has a plan god has a plan and and he knows what he's doing we read in the message uh the sermon that things that are to be he said everything's pre-planned of god so we rest in that and so as we go through this sermon this morning a little bit it'd be a wonderful sermon for you go back and listen to so i encourage you sometime this week just to take a little moment and listen to this sermon birdman starts us out in paragraph 77 he said god has a time and a reason for that time to fulfill to fulfill all his works god knows just exactly what he's going to do we don't we just had to receive it we we just had to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows and there's nothing going to go wrong with what he has planned to do it's all has to come about there has to be sometimes rugged and hard things to only bring out the real true nature of an object so you know he says sometimes rugged and hard things come our way sometimes hard decisions come and there's a reproach that comes with it but it it's what brings out what we really are right you know sometimes your life is is easy and and and and that's what the complaint about job was job everything's a blessing to you everything goes your way you've always had it your way you know everything's worked out for you and and god's got a hedge around you and the enemy came up and said man yeah he said have you considered my servant job what a what a great servant he is oh wouldn't you like god to do that about you uh i i'd have to plead the blood amen i'd have to plead the blood but and he said you built that i had your on job so what happened god said he he began to let job's world fall apart and and what was it to do it was to prove what job really really was the kind of character he really had what really was down on the inside to really prove that he was real yeah and and i think that's the the main thing that's happening now more than ever is god's proving whether or not this church is real everybody can make a claim everybody can make a statement everybody can say this and everybody can do that but he presses you through sometimes such a hard thing this is so because you you almost get to the place you can't bear it and here's job sitting on the ass sheep boiling over with boils itching rubbing his skin and scraping it and his wife says job look at just just curse god and die take the easy way out and she he stands there and said the lord giveth the lord taketh away and blessed be the name of the lord in the face of his comforters everybody trying to figure out his life for him everybody knowing how your life should go which direction your life should be what you should do what you shouldn't do and and they and they just and job went through it and finally he said though the skins won't meet my flesh though i sit here on this heat and i die and the skin worms eat my yet will i see god remember that's the end of all of our lives that's the end no matter what journey you take in this life the end of our lives is we shall see god hallelujah i have a place prepared for you if it was not so i would not tell you i go to prepare that place for you that where i am you may be also so god knows what he's doing but he says he says it's to bring out the real true nature of an object he says it takes the pounding of gold turned over and over back and forth and pounded till all the dross is taken out of it not because it shines iron pyrite what it's known as fool's gold it shines like the real gold anyway so so what's the why do you think that the the trials come why do you think those those though uh uh the things don't seem to go right because that's the only way that god can separate the real from the false and even in our our own lives we we all have parts of us that are not real whether they be our imagination whether it be a personality we try to put on uh whether we try to uh uh cover you know i i know what it's like i i grew up with such an inferiority complex that that you don't understand what miracle it took to have me stand here but to cover that inferiority complex you know i always had to be joking i always had to be in trouble always trying to do things because i was trying to hide the pain on the inside and i knew there was a love inside of me and and and it suffered but you know what it does it separates the the real from the false it separates the phony from the genuine and you know the in that listen to what he says here i think it's beautiful he says it's not because it shines because iron pirate was known as fool go sign just like gold but you put the two together you set them out from one side to another you set them apart you can hardly tell them apart but put them together you can tell it and the beater always has to beat till he sees his own reflection in the goal and i know that's what we're all trying to achieve right is to be more like him well you can't take you can't take in order to be like him he's got to separate everything out of us that's unlike him and sometimes that's painful sometimes you don't understand but what do you got to go back to god knows what he's doing everything's on time everything has a purpose everything has a reason he's in control even when we don't understand and we don't have to understand we got to believe and so we we we see that that that's that's a wonderful thing he says as we we go on to read he says and god and god sets a time and has a purpose for everything that he does there's nothing happening just accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling you don't have to be afraid if god moves you and and and you feel to do something then don't be afraid it's in god's hands you know what i mean he's in control god will get the outcome that he wants i thank god that he said that in my life i'm not talking about anybody's else's life i'm talking about my life in my life that he promised me that when i take the permissive will he'll work it back to his perfect will never want to forget who's in control and and so he he says that we're reading in paragraph 81. i don't know if they have it posted or not there's nothing happens just accidentally to those who love the lord and are called according to his calling see we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie hallelujah did he put your name on the lamb's book of life that you've got to end and again nothing it ca it won't lie you can sit back and rest on that i know this message is 100 absolutely the truth i can rest on that it'll come out just the way he said it'll come out even the critics they'll they can't figure out the cloud they can't figure out the mountain they can't figure out this they can't figure out the bear they can't figure out a lot of things they can't figure out but yet they're blind to every vindicated thing that he said that's happening right now it's going to be just the way he said it and let us read he says we are predestinated everything works out right because he cannot lie and he said that was so that everything has its time its season and it has its way that's the hard part a lot of times for us is the way god does things i think that's what we miss more than anything is the way god does things how he does things why he does it he's got a way for everything he moves everything he does oh for us not to worry about a dying world not to worry about a world we know is going to be destroyed not to worry about a world we know is going to get more and more wicked and more evil but but to set our hearts and know that god's got a will and a plan for his elected and that's where we should turn our hearts you believe that amen i most certainly believe that with all my heart i i don't know what i'd do without them amen and he says so and god is behind every move and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong is any has anybody felt that you know oh this is not going good at all you know there's there's something wrong you know and our messenger told us the sunshiny skies doesn't mean that god's for you is that right neither does the clouds and the storms mean that god's against you you've got to find your place in the word that you've got to be able to read that scripture listen to that word of god that was preached at this hour and put your name in it by his stripes david mcgeary was healed you've got to put your name in the scripture you got to put yourself in the place of the bible character when you read about peter you be peter when you read about john you be john when you read about noah you be noah you be job put yourself in there put yourself in the word of god because they were people just like you are they they ate like you they slept like you they suffered like you they got sick like you but there was something about them that they were committed to the plan of god oh my and and then we think that's everything goes wrong and it's up to us all things aren't going very good you know i i i feel that all the time we don't have a sunday school we don't have parking we don't have seating we don't have oh this lord what am i going to do it's not up to us you know what i mean we think we've got to do something you know it it's and and we we just we think oh i i've got to change the environment i've got to change the circumstance i've got to change the situation but it's not up to us those things are put upon us trials and wonderings you know i always got the trial part but it's the wonderings it's it's the wonderings that leave you helpless it's the what ifs and i always said this i put this this in my heart when i became a very young christian when i first got converted when i had hair down to my shoulders and yes and and i i i put this in my heart and i said ands if buts and wise are all satan's lies and and that's what it is and i would hear people say god said this but and such and such if and such an and you know and then why and i threw my hands up and said you know what it's just exactly what he says so hold that as we think of that and there's someone else in my heart that i put young in my heart and i still believe it to this day where there's any there's plenty and and you can walk through life with a simple heart and a simple mind the church don't need a whole lot more theology the church needs a whole lot more of the love of god shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit he says and it's the wonderings it's it's testing to see how you will react on an action a lot of things come your way and a lot of pressure and a lot of wonderings but it's there how are you going to react to that that's right yourself because satan tries to force you into decisions desperation causes you to do things you normally wouldn't do i mean it's human nature it goes for me it goes it goes for anybody you understand we we wonder we don't know what to do we we we throw up our hands and and it just say well what's our reaction to it how are we going to respond when something happens you don't understand it you wonder about it how's your response going to be i'll tell you what our response should be we should turn the other cheek we should go the extra mile we should give them the benefit of the doubt we should you know uh there's a lot of things it's hard it took me lots and lots of years and i'm i'm i'm just coming into it but i'm one of those guys that i like it done my way my way's the best way and i'm not gonna send you down the highway because i might need you later but uh just step back you know you don't know how many times now in my life that i i'm working on something and somebody steps in and sticks their hands in it while i'm working i look at like son come on now you know i know you're smarter and i am i know you've got more experience than i do i know you've got no more muscle than i do but don't forget i got a whole lot more authority than you do so at least let me do it wrong you know it's hard to step back say you want to do it go ahead you know it'll last a week or two and we'll be back to fix it again you know it's how you react right right you know what i mean how do you respond you know i i don't care what anything is jesus told us we respond with love we respond with respect we respond with support that that so that's the way we are you understand we're i'm not at war with anybody that's right i don't have to be at war you see we go back to it's up to us no it's not lord what is it to me if he tarries till i come follow me follow me that's where most people miss it follow him so he's looking for a reaction he says in paragraph 91 and i know people uh pity me because i i read quotes but don't worry i can preach i'm 72 years old and if i want to preach there's not a guy standing in this world that can preach but what good is it for you to do to have a show let's lay down some real words of the prophet of god and let them anchor in our heart and let them anchor in our soul i'll tell you emotions they don't last i used to be a schoolyard brawler i love to fight i get beat up a lot but i still love to fight and all the guys i got in fights with became my best friend because that emotion don't last don't let bitterness last don't let what other people say to you or say about you last don't get caught up in that world if god leads you to do something you're not against where you come from you're not against where you're going you're not against you follow the word of god he says now you see i believe all these things had a meaning what would you do with a power how would you see the reaction of an action sometimes that comes as an act then how do you react to that action do you understand what i mean what would you do and maybe all of this has worked up to where you are at now i don't know i just can't say but there's always been some way so be careful of your reaction and remember that the reproach of the word the word has always bore a reproach all through the ages there's always a reproach there's always a criticism there's always a negative voice out there there there's always a reproach but remember the the unelect is going to do what an elect does you know what i mean if you can't take a piece of a puzzle that used to be a joke we did as kids we take a couple pieces up from one box and throw them in another box and take a couple of pieces of those puzzles and throw them in another box you know and we'd wait down and they'd get down there and they'd have these two pieces and they couldn't make them fit hey get the scissors i'm going to make this fit you know god's going to get you where you fit the environment you want to be in the atmosphere you want to be in if that's what you want that's what you desire that's your heart's desire god gives you the desire of your heart the prophet he saw that eagle in the cage he thought man it tears me up he's not made to be there let them soar let them fly let people be where they're happy and uh and and and they feel god's moving them i don't care about that but i'm gonna preach to you what i do care about and it's the real thing he says every man that comes to christ he says you always have to stand the reproach in order to give your testing see every man that comes to christ first must be child trained for the purpose that god has ordained for you did i skip a paragraph yes let me go back and read and remember that the reproach of the word the word this is 92 the word the word has always bore a reproach all through the ages god's anointed word has always been reproached and that's the reason it's so hard for people who doesn't understand would know how to accept that reproach whoa that struck me how do we accept the reproach all these things are given for a reaction everything's to bear the reproach and he goes on to say you always have to stand this reproach you always got to stand it okay you've got to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to christ must first be child trained for the purpose that god has ordained for you and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he has called and and remember if if you can just keep quiet remember if he has called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening there is not enough devils in torment but what god's word will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators everything else but they'll never take your place right god's word will triumph now remember what triumphs what triumphs god's word now i'm setting you up will triumph it cannot fail now they feel sorry for us oh i feel so sorry for you because the spirit's not moving you're not shouting you're not jumping out your your song specials aren't a concert oh i feel so sorry for you you're dead you're misguided you're misdirected they feel sorry for you they felt sorry for noah until the creative will of god came now follow me through this morning if you would and i'll try to do my best but he said no they feel sorry for us they feel sorry for anybody that tries to hold to the word they feel sorry for you if you try to hold to what the messenger said they feel sorry for you if you only take what he said if you only believe what he said that you only trust what's on the tape they feel sorry for you you don't have the spirit they do they feel sorry for you they actually have pity for you oh i just don't know how you can work on that big old chunk of wood when god's doing all these great other other things oh they try to they they they try to say what are you doing why are you laboring in that why are you holding to that why are you sticking just with what he said why do you play tapes don't feel sorry for me because i play tapes hallelujah one day you'll realize that's what's kept you that's what's kept the spirits away that because the word correct corrects the air it's doing more for you than just hearing it satan don't like to be around that atmosphere satan don't like to be where that voice is satan don't like to be exposed that's why they don't play them because it exposed what's really going on not the facade not the front what was really going on is it was fixing to flood their life and their direction was total disaster and noah stayed with the word and he built the ark and they were feeling sorry for him oh we feel so sorry for anybody that tries to hold the word in the days of the scoffers but remember the reproach must come it's always been that way they must have thought as they did then let me finish the statement see if it's not god then it's something that man can achieve so they felt sorry for noah because noah was looking to a god that had a creative will god's will is a creative will it's not manipulating the world it's not manipulating the situations it's not conforming according to science what god's going to do he's going to create because spoken word is the original seed god's will is a creative will. are you staying with me he says what would we be able and willing to stand the reproach that went with the truth that was the reproach was staying with the truth with the creative will of god now bear with me i'm coming to something and i hope that you you said it let's take abraham now they are they're thinking poor noah poor noah these poor people they're just not with it you know the spirit's not moving you know they're they're dead we remember lazarus was dead until the creative will of god came along so abraham he said and he said now god god gave give him a very odd thing you're going to have and how could you imagine of abraham going out amongst his associates and saying we're going to what happens abraham believed it right believe that word believe that word was going to come to pass but you know what was the difference see it it it it was a reproach but abraham held to it and when he was a hundred years old he never staggered at the promise of god he still stood that reproach sure and holding on to it you you see that but notice the difference in there sarah tried to give abraham or god a little bit of help by herself that's the difference abraham said god's me and sarah can have a baby but the reproach of that was too too much they couldn't wait for the revival so they had to give god some help didn't they okay and and so that that's what she did she went out and she she tried to to give god some help if he she just you know it was just too much to believe she said okay i'm going to help god bring this promise to pass i'm going to go get hagar and oh i'm going to make it i'm going to have the baby on her knee and she's going to take it and and a a great big a great big program a great a great big thing now watch what you and and don't miss this watch this is a warning go back and read this message yourself and listen to it yourself it was a warning of what's taking place today i will stand on god's word and and she was a beautiful girl and a great and she's my maid and and she'll bring the promise see you see we always try to do something we can't wait for him we got to do something ourselves might have been all right she might have been pretty and it might have looked very good but it wasn't according to the word god told abraham the baby was going to come from sarah this revival is going to come from the word now listen listen close right here please listen to me see we always try to do something we can't wait for him we've got to do something ourselves might be all right she might have been pretty it might have looked good but it wasn't according to the word god told abraham the baby would come from sarah remember he said about the flock these signs shall follow them that believe to help that don't try to manufacture it that's the trouble what we've got today in this message is we have a manufactured revival because it's god's word and he's laying it right out to us as plain as can be and it's it's it it's it's got a magnet to it especially if you've got gifts remember he said about the little flock these signs shall follow them that believe and as it was in the days of noah so what being the coming of the son of man wherein a few even eight souls were saved those words can't fail so let's watch ourselves closely and stay with the word all right now listen to this see the people are always trying to manufacture something to take the place of god's creative will there's going to be a revival these signs are going to follow them that believe but god's going to create the revival it's not going to be a man made manufactured revival it's going to be created by the promised word of god it's not going to be a manufactured revival it'll take place by the creative word of god they don't want to wait on the creative will of god like a sheep does a sheep manufacture will no it bears wool why does it bear wool because of what it is because it's a sheep but it doesn't you can't make that sheep bare wool before it's time you can't feed it a little extra music you can't feed it a little extra boom boom you can't feel a little extra excitement that sheep will bear wall according to god's word and god's time god will manufacture the revival and it won't be manufactured it'll be created it bears it according to god's time he don't manufacture hey listen we're not supposed to manufacture the fruits of the spirit we're not supposed to manufacture the works of the spirit there's no hurry everything's moving towards god's plan we're not supposed to manufacture the fruits of the spirit we're supposed to bear the fruits of the spirit apple trees don't manufacture apples it just bears apple because it's an apple the revival will come because we're believers the revival will be created by god's creative will in his time because we are the elect lady it it it doesn't need any help and if we try to manufacture anything it'll help the cause we need to keep this thing going we need to get these signs and wonders into the church we need to have the spirit moving we need to be anointing boy we we really need to get we need to get we need to get the the thing the thing happening here you know what i mean a god by predestination calls who he will he gives the kingdom to every who he desires to give it to we learn that by nebuchadnezzar how many knows the story of nebuchadnezzar you want to go back and read some tremendous portions of scriptures you go back and read jeremiah the the 27th and to the 28th chapter god moves on jeremiah how many knows the story well i'm going to tell it because i like it god tells jeremiah go tell the king of israel of the king of judea go tell him you are going to come captive to nebuchadnezzar you're going to be brought into captivity now don't resist it so he's telling him don't stand against it don't fight against it kill your lands marry your daughters marry your sons have your children and increase do not fight against nebuchadnezzar because god has given it into his hands jeremiah gets this big wooden oak on yoke and goes in there and tells them now he tells the prophecy and then this is what he says in the verse 27 9 therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners or nor your dreamers or nor to you in enchanters nor to your saucers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon don't listen to them don't listen to him that's what he said he said for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land that i should drive you out and you should perish that's what he told them i mean my goodness this guy comes in and and and he he stands up and he preaches it see god don't need help god don't need help and so you know the stair to the story jeremiah comes there and and he comes with the yoke and then hananiah comes up and he begins to prophesy oh thus saith the lord jeremiah says don't listen don't listen to the revival talk don't listen to the ton speaking and the prophesying and the divining again all this thing don't listen to it it's going to be exactly the way god said it don't worry about a revival god's going to create the revival it's his creative will god don't need the help of music he don't need the help of emotions he don't need the help of powerful energetic preachers he don't need comparison and he don't need duplication he don't need us to duplicate what happened in 1906 he don't need to duplicate people standing up prophesying and speaking in tongues oh i like it when i know i'm standing on god's word i like it when you know and you're sitting here knowing in your heart by the word of god that there's a revival coming but it's going to be by god's creative will it's not going to be a man-made created revival not going to be worked up every time i've been in this basket since 70. i've seen movements come by the truckload and it's not long till some man rises to the forefront and he becomes the adjoining voice to the prophet i'll tell you what he meant i'll tell you what he said i'll tell you what he's getting to don't listen there's a revival coming these signs shall follow them that believe and you can't manufacture it you might see some things but they don't last but when god does it it'll be perfect he said so hananiah comes up and he he he takes it and he breaks the yolk and they were wondering what were gonna happen to the vessels he said well we'll be back in two years with all the vessels of the tabernacle right out in front of everybody we've got a revival going on we're going to join this revival what ain't the one god's going to create because there's i'm going to get to it there's a reproach that's got to come first let's join this revival it ain't a revival hanan broke the yoke and said we'll be back in two years jeremiah comes back with the yoke of iron and says now you broke the yoke i told you not to fight now it's going to be worse than it was before and he stands up and says god will break the yolk of iron this is going to be god's moving and we're going to go take the land and we've got a revival going on it's not the one god created it's not the one that god will create because these signs and wonders shall follow the bride there is a revival coming there is a great revival move that's going to take place when we get in the perfect will of god according to his word and we're doing it for a purpose these signs are not to be performed on us they're to be performed by us so here he comes he says then then then hananiah came up and grabbed the yoke off of jeremiah's neck but for all the priests and all the congregation maybe millions and a half people and took that yoke that god put upon jeremiah's neck for a sign and broke it to pieces and threw it at his feet just enthused and said thus saith the lord in two years they'll be back talking about the vessels jeremiah just looked at him it was contrary to the word so he just walked away god said go back and tell him i never spoke to him it was just enthused he took his own impressionc he never waited till actually he saw it and knew it wasn't him that it was god saying it he went back all enthused enthusiasm if it's god it's going to be according to what and what is the word for our day you have this bible but if you read this bible you'll build a boat if you read this bible you'll wait in an upper room until you speak in tongues if you read this bible you'll try to restore the gifts you'll come up with all kinds of stuff reading this bible you don't think so how many different denominations are you but there was one that came that had the mind of god and he said i will create i have a creative will think of it a creative will god's will is creative he doesn't rely on any help he doesn't need anything else he he doesn't need to duplicate a revival on past people are looking back at something that happened in the past they're trying to get the same things going the same things working the same singers anointing and everything that's all great have at it but hear me in the name of the lord god has a creative will and god will create the revival it's something she has never seen before it's going to be so good it's going to be so real it's going to be so you and him it's an invisible union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride producing spiritual sons and daughters of god you know he just it's all enthused we find it across the country today one of our tapes was being played recently in a home where a group of ministers was right then played it recently in the home where a group group of ministers was right then convicted and was coming to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and a man rose up in the room and spoke in tongues and said thus saith the lord hold on to what you got just keep on going and and i'll bless you they said well if the lord said that i guess it's that's it you see it isn't examined with the word it's got to take the word first there you are it was contrary to the word god made a promise that he would bless but then blessings are under conditions and you've got to meet those conditions to make that work now this that's the part let's just close now we find out here that these people were trying to help manufacture something hagar and saying sarah to help abraham help god to make his promise come true you can't do that there's no way at all of doing it it's against everything god's word it's it's a it's a it's against everything god's word is going to happen anyhow you've just got to stand right on the word and say it's this way and keep the word now watch to manufacture something to take the place of his word that's why the first thing you find they separate themselves from the messenger every move i've seen they always separate themselves from the messenger they rise up equal to oh we've had the message for 60 some years we know what's in there now we're waiting for the spirit to move he's not going to move outside his will and his word said that he does it with his creative will how are you going to measure it how are you going to measure whether you're having a revival you know what they measure it by the revival's gone by everybody's wanting pentecost back we're not even living in a pentecostal age we're living in a bright age what's going to be manifested in you is going to be created by the will of god but you've got your part it's it you know it's a reproach he says but and and you've got to bear the approach see everything's got its time and its purpose and its place so you must find out what god has promised you can say these signs shall follow them that believe and then go out and try to produce it try to preach an atmosphere try to sing an atmosphere like i told you before if you got up and screamed around around the church it wouldn't mean nothing to me because you're a believer big deal but when you get that guy on the street screaming because he's just had his sins forgiven and he's just been he's just been delivered from a demon and he stands up with tears running down his face with his hands in the air saying praise god praise god that's the god i know but they don't want that reproach oh i'd like to give that is that brother here anyway matt thomas that i'm going to give you a testimony is that all right i know you can do it better if i mess it up forget it it's the way i said it matt thomas he's with miles and they just kind of feel led to go by the park so they go by the park they're riding their bikes looking apart and there's the swings and the merry grounds and everything mounts and i'm going to go over and hang out you know do 200 push pull-ups on the the bar there and and i'm i'm gonna run about five laps on the merry-go-round and and uh so uh that might be a little enhanced but it's uh and so there's a there's a there's a man sitting there in the park and you know matt has got down and prayed through with the lord and he's got some commitments in his heart about witnessing and testifying so the spirit moves on and he goes over and talks to this guy and he says how you doing and and everything and and the guy got a real heavy accent he says well i speak french oh and matt goes oh good he says where do you go to church and they talk a little bit and matt goes away a little bit and mouth and then matt feels drawn to come back and he comes back to the guy and he says hey he says go on everything he says where do you go to church and the guy bows his head and says have you ever heard of william marion branham and that says i believe william marion brahms the prophet of god and i believe his message for the hour and that guy throws back and his eyes get this big and he says what he says is there a church here here's a son of god and god leads his son to his son because this guy's starving for fellowship oh that's beautiful those things don't need help but you got to know what god's promise is abraham standing on the word of god it finally was fulfilled is that right but listen now listen as i say this so we understand the enthusiasm right we don't want to be caught away with the enthusiasm we don't want to manufacture something that takes the place of god's word we understand that right do you understand that i don't care what it moves like until you know the promise and until you understand this revival will be created not manufactured so don't feel bad about yourself because there's a step there's a step to be for and this is the step we miss abrahad stood on the word of god and it was finally fulfilled oh my watch the scoffers of barrenness being scoffed and the reproach of barrenness first what comes first barrenness what do they scoff you for and mock you for they think you're barren we're not barren we're waiting for the divine creation of god's will but that's the reproach barrenness that's what had to come first he said she had to stand the reproach of being barren for all those years she was nearly a hundred years old she was 90 with the word of god this ted she would also be a princess a mother of this child she had abraham barron both of their bodies as well as dead but yet they never doubted the word one bit but they had to stand that first and then hallelujah god kept his word in the dark hour isaac was born and his seed is like the sands of the seas and the stars of heaven see god always answers his word yes baroness first then isaac it's the barrenness that's the reproach it's the waiting for the creative will of god that's the reproach that's what you get mocked for that's what you get scoffed for that's what the point the finger for that's why they call you ice cube preachers and that's why they say you have no life because you have to go through the reproach of being barren then isaac amen if you try to manufacture it if you try to go around it you'll come up with something that's man-made and everything that man makes dies the thunders died off white horse rider died off two souls died off how we could just keep on going man-made revivals always die off they don't last heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away church [Music] be able to bear the reproach don't be ashamed if you go somewhere and they talk to you and they talked about their revival that's fine praise god i'm happy for you you know what jeremiah did how many knows what jeremiah said it's it's beautiful and it just says this he he says he said uh so haman prophesies and there was uh and and jeremiah says to haman oh may it be so may it happen just according to you say it may you be blessed may it happen he said but just remember what i said he says a prophet is only known when his prophecy comes to pass this is a warning from our messenger to his bride that they're going to try to manufacture and work something but you wait you know who you are it's an individual affair when someone tells you i just feel that i'm complacent and i just feel that i i'm not excited i don't feel like i'm moving for god yeah you know how you you keep reading your bible keep praying keep having devotions you let your daily devotions go you let your daily prayer go you let your thing go you'll be like a cactus well you give a cactus water and those needles unfold you stay in god you know what the promise is but you can't manufacture it it's going to happen but it's going to be created and first he said first barrenness first going through the dry place first going through the wonderings first going through the criticism because you'll never stand in the hall of fame until you stand in the hall of critics and that's what david said oh i bear the reproach of the mighty people of god i'll bear the reproach because my enemies they don't have nothing going on huh i know what i got going on i got waiting going on i'm waiting because i got the promise of god that he will create a revival the reproach of barrenness i thought lord that's where we are that's what they think that's what they point they look at us in the message and they think what a barren group they got all kinds of stuff going on out there shows music shows concerts you know gymnasiums game rooms playrooms and everything what we're waiting for we cannot create you understand that do what you do but don't put your trust in it waiting for the creative will of god waiting is the reproach when he creates it it'll be perfect it will be his will it will be his time and it will be for a purpose now that's my question this morning go read it yourself man always tries to manufacture something and get ahead of god they're always trying to take the place of god's creative will but remember that's what makes him god because he's a creator he'll create the answer to your problem he'll create your deliverance he'll create your healing look to the creative will of god the prophet of god said do everything you can do that's your obligation but you look for the creative will of god and god's got a revival but it's a created revival and it's going to be perfect and it's going to be right on time and it's going to be his will so jump all you want shout all you want sing all you want but don't identify it as anything other than jumping singing and shouting there's preachers that can run from one into this platform to the other they can shout hallelujah praise god they make these cliche statements and i don't even think we know what they mean it's an individual fair church it's between you and him turn your heart to him turn your life to him say god whatever i'm going to be whatever fruits that are in me they have to come by your creative will and i submit to that creative will and i'm trusting in that creative will i'm not looking for nothing i believe everything's perfect everything's on time and when they say loie is here or lowey is there i'm not moved because he'll be here right on time and if you're a part of it and you've got a part to play there's no enemies in the world going to keep you from it i know right now and i want to thank you so much for your patience we don't have sunday school i know that we don't have young people i know there's a lot of programs out there we don't have a gymnasium we don't have all the things that a lot of people have we're trying to get there the best we can i know you have to walk in the hot sun i know you have to park on the dirt and i know it's hard but this is our barren time but it's to see your reaction how are you going to react because it proves what you really are proves what you really
