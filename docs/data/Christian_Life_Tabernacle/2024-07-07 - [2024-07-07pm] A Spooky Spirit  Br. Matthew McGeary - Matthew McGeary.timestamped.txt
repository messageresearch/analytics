[44:12] love your care for us lord
[44:16] it's no one has ever cared for us like
[44:19] you
[44:21] have you've looked upon all of our
[44:24] needs you've already taken care of our
[44:27] future needs Lord there's nothing you
[44:30] didn't think about Lord we just want to
[44:33] rest in your more than capable hands
[44:36] tonight and just ask that you would come
[44:39] Lord you'd have your will and way in the
[44:42] service we're depending on you Lord
[44:44] we're not looking to the ways of man but
[44:47] Lord we're looking beyond the scene into
[44:50] the Unseen realm
[44:53] Lord that you would just come and do
[44:55] what Only You Can Do Lord and that's
[44:57] take your word and bring forth
[44:59] Revelation and life and Quicken seeds
[45:02] and deliver and bring forth new births
[45:05] into your kingdom because you are the
[45:07] same yesterday today and forever so
[45:09] where we place this word into your hands
[45:13] pray that you pick up this little
[45:14] thought you would break the bread of
[45:16] life and feed your sheep Lord we love
[45:19] you we pray these blessings in your name
[45:23] the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:25] amen amen praise the Lord if you have
[45:27] your
[45:28] Bibles um turn over into Nehemiah
[45:31] chapter 8 it's going to be after
[45:33] Chronicles uh before Esther I believe
[45:36] after Ezra help you find
[45:40] it sometimes it's nerve-wracking turning
[45:43] to a chapter to a book in the Bible
[45:45] because everybody thinks you don't know
[45:47] your Bible and you're you're like man I
[45:49] know nehemiah's in here
[45:51] somewhere and then you just you get
[45:53] stuck on job and you're like well no one
[45:55] else will know I'm just going to keep my
[45:57] right here you're all laughing because
[45:59] we've all done
[46:01] it but that's okay
[46:05] Nehemiah uh chapter
[46:09] 8 we have a maybe an odd thought and
[46:12] approach to this service but we'll see
[46:15] what the Lord would have for us
[46:17] Nehemiah um y'all pray for me I'm I'm
[46:21] weak in body I'm I'm weak in voice
[46:25] um the spirit is willing that the flesh
[46:27] is weak but but he wins every
[46:32] time Nehemiah 8 verse 8 says so they
[46:35] read in the book in the law of God
[46:37] distinctly and gave the sense and caused
[46:40] them to understand the reading and
[46:43] Nehemiah which is the church cherisheth
[46:47] and Ezra the priest Of The Scribe and
[46:49] the Levites that taught the people said
[46:51] unto all the people this day is Holy
[46:54] unto the Lord your God mourn not nor
[46:56] weep for all the people wept when they
[46:58] heard the words of the law you could
[47:01] imagine a people that would claim to uh
[47:03] uh believe the law and and live by it
[47:05] when when the the book was read to them
[47:07] they realized their transgressions and
[47:11] and what was the weight that was upon
[47:13] them but he said then he said unto them
[47:14] go your way eat the fat and drink the
[47:17] sweet and send portions unto them for
[47:19] whom nothing is prepared for this day is
[47:22] Holy unto the Lord neither be ye sorry
[47:26] for the joy Jo of the Lord is your
[47:28] strength amen you may be
[47:30] seated um like I said this this might be
[47:33] an an odd approach I I was prepared to
[47:36] maybe continue along a thought that we
[47:39] ministered on previously and then I had
[47:42] maybe thought it's it's communion so
[47:45] maybe we'll do a little just a little
[47:48] short teaching uh but then the Lord just
[47:51] dealt with my heart this morning and
[47:52] then after uh this message we heard this
[47:55] morning I figured let's just keep keep
[47:56] the devil running let's just drive that
[47:59] dude all the way out of here and um the
[48:02] joy of the Lord is your
[48:05] strength um and this might seem really
[48:08] odd but the title of my sermon is a
[48:11] spooky
[48:14] Spirit a spooky Spirit you know spooky
[48:19] means a strange or unsettling or
[48:22] frightening in a way that suggest the
[48:24] supernatural it's it's Eerie or uncan so
[48:27] you know just reading in the joy of the
[48:29] Lord is a strength we'll have a quote
[48:30] we'll get to where brother Brandon would
[48:32] say that um but you know if Satan can
[48:35] ever rob you of your joy you know David
[48:37] said restore unto me the joy of my
[48:40] salvation and certainly a lot of times
[48:43] we might get into places in our lives
[48:46] and we go through trials and
[48:48] tribulations and and we don't realize we
[48:50] get worn out and we get uh uh distracted
[48:54] and we get ground down and we we for get
[48:57] the joy of the Lord and what he's done
[49:00] for us and many times all we have to do
[49:02] is just encourage oursel and the Lord
[49:04] look back of at what he did for us and
[49:06] the and the great revelation of the hour
[49:09] and remember what he done and start to
[49:11] testify about it and you'll find that
[49:13] that Joy just coming back and it'll give
[49:15] you strength to go another day uh but in
[49:18] just this thought of a a spooky
[49:21] Spirit um you know brother Brandon would
[49:24] say um he would say now I I am happy I
[49:28] get tired I get physically wore out I
[49:30] have difficults things that an ordinary
[49:32] person doesn't have you can imagine how
[49:35] Satan fights me day and night all the
[49:36] time cast those demons out and they
[49:39] haunt at you you see uh but those things
[49:43] I have a battle that no one knows about
[49:45] and he said in another place in his
[49:48] commission he said many times demons has
[49:50] followed me in the room and and I felt
[49:52] their flesh rubbing against me and and
[49:55] bells and things would haunted me half
[49:57] uh the night nearly and I just want to
[50:01] say we we could see the prophet in that
[50:03] great office how uh the enemy would war
[50:05] against him but you know we're all in a
[50:08] battle and uh just the other day I was
[50:11] out out with my family and and my wife's
[50:14] she's just hearing this for the first
[50:15] time so now she's going to know why but
[50:17] we were in the restaurant and and um I I
[50:21] I just uh you know I just felt a a a
[50:23] spirit move up next to me and and wanted
[50:26] to uh to try to uh us talk to me and
[50:29] when you when you start to do battles in
[50:31] that unseen realm you know really the
[50:33] things around you become more distance
[50:35] and you're you're really honed in to to
[50:37] do a
[50:39] pressing you're doing a real battle
[50:41] spiritual warfare and as we were leaving
[50:43] the restaurant my wife looked at me and
[50:44] she just said honey what's wrong you
[50:46] don't seem yourself and I I didn't tell
[50:48] her at the time I said oh no
[50:49] everything's okay and there's been a few
[50:52] times in my Christian walk I I remember
[50:54] one time um I was preaching some
[50:56] meetings
[50:57] and um you know a lot of times when you
[50:59] fast and pray or you're really making
[51:01] yourself available for the for the Lord
[51:04] just to come you know you're you're also
[51:06] you got to be very careful because
[51:07] you're in a vulnerable state and and
[51:10] you're you're more um in tune to the
[51:12] things maybe in the spiritual realm and
[51:14] and a brother wanted to take me out to
[51:16] eat to a restaurant we went out there
[51:17] and I tell you I'll never forget I was
[51:19] looking at his face and he was talking
[51:22] but I wasn't heing one thing he said a
[51:23] spear had moved up right beside me he
[51:25] says what do you think you're even doing
[51:27] here you have no business here you're
[51:29] out of the will of the Lord coming here
[51:30] to preach the gospel and and all of
[51:32] these things and and and I'll tell you
[51:35] what happens when when the devil starts
[51:38] starts talking and you start to hear him
[51:40] if you if you're not careful he'll start
[51:41] to change the
[51:43] atmosphere and and there'll be a really
[51:45] spooky feeling and a really eerie
[51:47] something start to come over you and if
[51:49] you're not careful and you start to
[51:51] listen and you just allow that to creep
[51:53] in the devil could be do a great damage
[51:57] and the prophet when he would start to
[51:59] preach in demonology he would say you
[52:01] know the word demon or devil it comes
[52:03] from one word and that is Tormentor and
[52:07] so the devil wants to try to torment you
[52:09] and we know the lid of hell has been
[52:11] taken off and there's 200,000,000 demons
[52:15] that are fighting against the Bride of
[52:16] Jesus Christ a and certainly he would
[52:19] want to torment you and so I I just want
[52:22] to maybe uh tell you the
[52:24] inspiration of why I'm wanting to to um
[52:28] speak on this thought because something
[52:30] that struck me is that we we every
[52:32] single one of us you know we go through
[52:34] trials we go through battles but I want
[52:37] to say it's just not for your sake it's
[52:39] for the sake of others because as you
[52:41] overcome as Christ overcomes through you
[52:43] now that trial becomes a testimony and
[52:47] uh you know just this this morning you
[52:49] know I felt uh uh you know the devil
[52:51] just press up against me and and that
[52:54] that that spooky Spirit just just try to
[52:56] start talking to me I I had to you know
[52:59] I had to get up and go do battle I I had
[53:01] to remind That Old Devil who he's
[53:02] dealing with I I had to take the word
[53:05] and start to do battle and I tell you
[53:07] every time if you if that old spooky
[53:10] spirit moves up to you and the devil
[53:11] starts to talk to you or even your
[53:13] carnal mind or your memories you must be
[53:15] quick to take the word of God and do
[53:18] battle you don't want to give him any
[53:21] place you don't have to listen to his
[53:23] lies you don't have to listen to him
[53:25] right when he opened his mouth just
[53:27] smack that guy just give him a black eye
[53:29] just say hold up wait a minute I'm a Son
[53:32] of God and I am going to do battle and
[53:35] you know Paul would say in Ephesians
[53:37] 6:12 he says for we wrestle not against
[53:40] flesh and blood but against
[53:41] principalities against Powers against
[53:44] the rulers of Darkness of this world
[53:46] against spiritual wickedness in high
[53:48] places make no mistake about it we are
[53:51] in a war we are in a real battle and
[53:55] make no mistake about out at each one of
[53:57] you if you are claiming uh to be a
[53:59] Christian and believing this message and
[54:01] you've been baptized in the name of the
[54:03] Lord Jesus Christ there is a Target on
[54:06] your back and Satan would want to take
[54:08] you down he wants to keep you from
[54:10] recognizing who you really are he wants
[54:12] to keep you from catching a real
[54:14] revelation of the message and who you
[54:16] are in Christ and you know because we
[54:19] wrestle against these uh spiritual
[54:21] wickedness in high places know you you
[54:23] can you can feel it or you can you can
[54:25] see the effect of it in the flesh and
[54:28] and many times you know brother Brandon
[54:29] would uh uh preach demonology uh In the
[54:32] Flesh realm and demonology in the
[54:34] religious realm and he'd go on to preach
[54:36] different ones so we see the effects of
[54:39] of of that of the Supernatural and that
[54:41] wickedness in different Realms but we
[54:44] also uh will see those effects you know
[54:46] doctors will give it a name it might be
[54:48] some type of sickness or or or
[54:50] depression or a fear and and no matter
[54:53] what you what you might come down to say
[54:55] it we we know that sick comes from one
[54:57] place and it's of the devil I I don't
[54:59] care what you want to call it sometimes
[55:01] we might get confused about it and
[55:03] understand well how can somebody Holy
[55:05] Ghost filled have this or or be going
[55:07] through that you know brother Brandon
[55:08] would say in one place you know while
[55:10] you're in your right mind you know give
[55:12] your life to God because you might not
[55:14] have a right mind one day there's
[55:16] there's some people that have lost their
[55:17] mind there's some people that have even
[55:19] committed suicide and and some people
[55:21] think that's the unpardonable sin but no
[55:24] no to reject the grace of God would be
[55:27] that thing that where you would cross a
[55:28] line but if you if you have your right
[55:30] mind I tell you if you're sitting here
[55:32] tonight make a conscious decision to
[55:34] serve God with all your heart repent of
[55:36] your sins uh be baptized in the name of
[55:38] the Lord Jesus Christ that you might
[55:40] receive the Holy Spirit and you be born
[55:43] again but you know we wrestle against
[55:45] these spirits and a lot of times we see
[55:47] those effects and and you know they they
[55:50] call it oh they might call it a cancer
[55:52] they might call it a depression they
[55:53] might call it an addiction they might
[55:55] call it high high blood pressure they
[55:57] might call it diabetes Well make no
[55:59] mistake about it it's the devil we'll go
[56:02] ahead and call it what it is that that
[56:04] that's no Mark upon your character no
[56:06] way that's no Mark upon you being a
[56:08] Believer what it is is you're in a
[56:10] battle and we got a family of God that
[56:12] wants to join together with you in the
[56:13] battle and beat that devil remind that
[56:17] devil that by his stripes we are already
[56:19] healed he might want to point to the
[56:21] symptoms he want to might point to the
[56:23] trial and everything you're going well I
[56:25] I don't I don't have to point to the
[56:27] symptoms I don't have to point to the
[56:29] doctor's report I'm going to point to
[56:30] Calvary I'm going to point to the word
[56:32] of God I'm going to point to thus sayth
[56:34] the Lord because that is our
[56:37] Victory and you know that the devil what
[56:39] he'd want to do these principalities and
[56:41] these Powers you know he would really
[56:43] want to try to an anoint your mind and
[56:45] and take control of your thoughts and
[56:48] and your actions as we'll just read some
[56:50] quotes out of Christ The Mystery of God
[56:52] revealed he would say this in paragraph
[56:53] 221 he'd say some people under illusions
[56:57] of things go out and become
[56:59] insane well we know that's wrong that's
[57:01] the devil trying to impersonate the real
[57:03] thing before it gets here see always
[57:06] aacy but a real man is to lose his own
[57:09] thoughts and his own thinking not come
[57:11] up blindly like that no sir you come up
[57:13] with your right senses and Christ takes
[57:14] you over and expresses himself and now
[57:17] to the world you're an insane person now
[57:19] if you're insane you're actually insane
[57:23] that the devil can can take you in
[57:25] complete complet control he'll make you
[57:27] do everything contrary to this word now
[57:31] I say we are living in an age and in an
[57:33] atmosphere we where we are seeing the
[57:35] devil take over flesh and cause people
[57:38] to do everything that is contrary to the
[57:41] word even people who claim to be
[57:43] Christians they're doing everything that
[57:45] would seem contrary to the word we're
[57:47] seeing uh the effects all around us
[57:50] we're seeing Total Insanity in one place
[57:52] brother bam say why do the people do it
[57:54] because a monster has got them groundbed
[57:57] you you wonder why people are doing the
[57:59] things that they're doing and they're
[58:01] standing for certain causes and they're
[58:03] they're marching out in the streets and
[58:06] and they're proclaiming certain uh uh
[58:08] justices and things it's because they
[58:11] have come under an anointing look you
[58:14] have to start to see that this world
[58:16] that we are now living in they they
[58:18] actually are being anointed for the
[58:21] tribulation there is an antichrist
[58:23] spirit that has anointed the government
[58:25] it's it's anointed uh the newses and the
[58:28] sports and everything you can make no
[58:30] mistake about it there is a God of this
[58:32] evil age and Satan has a bride that he
[58:35] is Anointed he has sowed his seed and
[58:37] that his seed is coming into
[58:39] manifestation in all kinds of ways and
[58:41] wickedness and we're seeing on every
[58:44] hand make no mistake about it there is a
[58:46] real
[58:48] devil and people are becoming anointed
[58:51] people are coming demon
[58:54] possessed now I I know in this title
[58:56] this might not sound like a really uh
[58:59] you know preach us happy brother Matthew
[59:02] well we're going to get there like I
[59:04] said we just we just want to put our
[59:05] shoulder behind the word that we
[59:07] received uh uh this morning and I just
[59:09] want to keep uhhh the devil running
[59:11] because you know uh like I said this
[59:14] morning I felt that Spirit come in and
[59:16] try to press itself against me again I'm
[59:18] like wait hold on
[59:20] here uh and and I I something dropped
[59:23] down into my heart and I I realized that
[59:26] what the Lord was dealing with my heart
[59:27] is that we go through things uh um that
[59:30] we can testify and and give the Victory
[59:33] and I believe that somebody here is
[59:35] battling a spirit that's trying to talk
[59:38] to you and trying to discourage you and
[59:41] trying to oppress you and you feel like
[59:43] there is a dark cloud maybe hovering
[59:45] over your life it's trying to follow you
[59:47] and I want to tell you we're going to
[59:49] we're going to deal with that spooky
[59:50] Spirit tonight and we're going to get
[59:52] the
[59:54] victory if you want to be delivered
[59:56] Deliverance is here for you you say well
[59:59] how can I overcome well you got to
[1:00:01] recognize the devil real you got to
[1:00:03] recognize that that depression or that
[1:00:05] anxiety or that thing that you've been
[1:00:08] battling that is the devil God doesn't
[1:00:10] want you to feel that way there's not
[1:00:12] there's no no there's nothing wrong with
[1:00:14] you you might call it a medical
[1:00:16] condition you might be taking medicine
[1:00:17] for it that's okay but what we want to
[1:00:19] do is recognize that God doesn't want
[1:00:21] you to feel that way God doesn't want
[1:00:23] you to feel depressed he doesn't want
[1:00:25] you to feel Mal ol he doesn't want you
[1:00:26] to have anxiety he doesn't want you when
[1:00:29] when it comes time to take decisions you
[1:00:31] you get all locked up and you don't know
[1:00:33] what to do and you start to have a panic
[1:00:34] attack I'm telling you that's the devil
[1:00:36] we're going to call it out that old
[1:00:38] spooky Spirit we're going to recognize
[1:00:40] the devil is real and then but what do
[1:00:41] we got to do once you recognize the
[1:00:43] devil's real how do you overcome you
[1:00:45] recognize that greater is he that is in
[1:00:48] me than he that is in the world you're
[1:00:50] not just sitting there all on your own
[1:00:52] but you are a Believer you are a son of
[1:00:54] God you are a daughter of God and you
[1:00:56] were going through a trial and that is
[1:00:58] just the opportunity that God wanted you
[1:01:01] to go through just like the children of
[1:01:03] Israel when they're back got against the
[1:01:04] wall when they came down to the Red Sea
[1:01:06] it looked like there was no way out
[1:01:08] there was no way to turn left no way to
[1:01:10] turn right the Egypt was charging behind
[1:01:12] them and the Red Sea was in front of
[1:01:14] them there was nowhere to go but God LED
[1:01:16] them the prophet of God said God LED
[1:01:18] them into a trap because it was just an
[1:01:20] opportunity for him to express his love
[1:01:22] I want to tell you you might be going
[1:01:23] through a trial right now you might feel
[1:01:25] depressed you might feel uh despondent
[1:01:28] you might feel some spooky spirit is
[1:01:29] talking to you I want to tell you that
[1:01:31] God has led you into this trial because
[1:01:33] he's going to lead you out of the trial
[1:01:35] this is just an opportunity for my God
[1:01:37] to prove his love to you to prove that
[1:01:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:41] forever you're going to get the victory
[1:01:43] I say you already got the victory you
[1:01:45] got the victory when he prayed you
[1:01:47] through before the foundation of the
[1:01:48] world and he put your name on the Lamb's
[1:01:51] Book of Life how you like that devil you
[1:01:53] can't stop me you can't make me miss the
[1:01:55] rapture you can't make me miss the love
[1:01:57] of God there's nothing you can do devil
[1:01:59] you've already been defeated when my
[1:02:01] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ spread for
[1:02:03] him his arms on Calvary and he said it
[1:02:05] is finished I want to say it is finished
[1:02:07] the race is already over I'm telling you
[1:02:10] we're running a race but it's already
[1:02:11] finished why because we have a
[1:02:13] forerunner what is a forerunner a
[1:02:15] forerunner is one that goes before you
[1:02:18] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:20] he's already ran the race and he's
[1:02:22] already won and greater is he that has
[1:02:24] won that is in you
[1:02:26] oh I feel pretty good watch out devil
[1:02:29] we're going to get the victory
[1:02:32] tonight evangelism won't hurt you to
[1:02:35] help you just get behind it a little bit
[1:02:38] I'm looking forward to God to do
[1:02:39] something look I went through a trial I
[1:02:41] had to do battle and I want to testify
[1:02:43] that God is Victorious every
[1:02:48] time in the world you'll have
[1:02:51] tribulation but be of good
[1:02:53] cheer oh the joy of the Lord is your
[1:02:57] strength I have overcome the
[1:03:00] world Prophet goes on to say but when
[1:03:03] Christ takes you over he'll Express that
[1:03:06] word right through you so we see what
[1:03:09] happens in the negative we see how a
[1:03:12] demon Spirit can take somebody over and
[1:03:14] express an evil spirit a a a demonic
[1:03:18] oppression where people will lose their
[1:03:20] mind and they will carry out murders and
[1:03:22] all kinds of adulteries and things and
[1:03:24] people will strip them elv down and and
[1:03:26] make them a strip teas and and run
[1:03:28] through the world and and it's all kind
[1:03:30] of insanity my if you would take this
[1:03:33] generation
[1:03:35] today back just 50 60 years ago they
[1:03:38] would lock them up in mental
[1:03:40] institutions make 100% the way the women
[1:03:45] dress the way people
[1:03:48] act this this was a nation that was once
[1:03:51] built on moral standards it was once a
[1:03:53] Christian Nation and the insan
[1:03:56] and the demon possessed people walking
[1:03:58] around our nation it would not have been
[1:04:00] tolerated but now our own government and
[1:04:02] our own police
[1:04:03] forces and I don't care call it what you
[1:04:05] want a Democrat a republic whatever you
[1:04:07] want look it's the God of this evil age
[1:04:10] has anointed the minds of
[1:04:14] men but if we see that in the
[1:04:18] negative if if we can see that gross
[1:04:21] Darkness pressing in upon the people if
[1:04:24] we can see people losing their their
[1:04:26] mind where where where where they're
[1:04:28] committing all acts of vience what about
[1:04:30] the bride of Christ but when Christ
[1:04:33] takes you over he'll Express that word
[1:04:36] right through you because it's him he is
[1:04:40] the word see and then you can see the
[1:04:42] expression of Christ not some illusion
[1:04:44] of some sort but a real genuine Christ
[1:04:48] expressing himself right through you how
[1:04:52] beautiful oh praise His wonderful name
[1:04:56] I say you must be born
[1:04:58] again not some illusion not some
[1:05:02] explanation not some
[1:05:04] religion not some our fathers did eat
[1:05:07] Mana in the
[1:05:08] wilderness here's the word made flesh
[1:05:12] fulfilling every scripture that was
[1:05:14] prophesied of the Messiah the anointed
[1:05:17] word for the hour and they're in a
[1:05:19] debate with
[1:05:21] them friends we don't need to debate the
[1:05:24] message we need to say Amen to the
[1:05:27] message I don't have to make this quote
[1:05:29] fit with that quote you can't make them
[1:05:31] all fit because if you're trying to make
[1:05:33] them fit it's the carnal mind which is
[1:05:35] enmity with God a lot of men have got
[1:05:38] their themselves in trouble explaining a
[1:05:39] quote and then when they explain that
[1:05:41] quote they run into a quote that's a
[1:05:43] little different than the way they
[1:05:44] explained it so they got to pick which
[1:05:46] quote they're going to explain away I'm
[1:05:48] not called to explain it I'm called to
[1:05:50] believe it I believe it it's thus sayith
[1:05:54] the Lord It's the anointed word of the
[1:05:55] hour and here they are debating with the
[1:05:58] anointed word of the hour which was
[1:06:00] their Messiah well you know our our our
[1:06:02] our our fathers uh did eat Mana in the
[1:06:04] wilderness he said yeah and every single
[1:06:06] one of them are dead they said oh I he
[1:06:09] gave us Mana to eat in the wilderness he
[1:06:11] said Moses didn't give you that Mana my
[1:06:14] father gave it to you and I am the bread
[1:06:17] that cometh down out of
[1:06:19] Heaven oh now they had a problem I kind
[1:06:22] of call me a fanatic but that's that's
[1:06:24] uh you know that's John 633 and I think
[1:06:26] it's kind of interesting that it was
[1:06:28] June 1933 that a voice came down and
[1:06:31] said you know as John the Baptist foran
[1:06:33] the a first coming of Christ so shall
[1:06:35] your ministry forun the second coming of
[1:06:37] Christ all I could see is the Bread of
[1:06:39] Heaven coming down
[1:06:41] Hallelujah I am the bread that cometh
[1:06:43] down out of Heaven I am Revelations 10
[1:06:45] 1-7 I am that Mighty Angel unless you
[1:06:49] eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll
[1:06:51] have no
[1:06:53] life I don't I don't need an explanation
[1:06:56] I need a
[1:06:59] revelation unless you eat the Flesh of
[1:07:01] the son of
[1:07:05] man it hasn't
[1:07:08] changed unless you eat the Flesh of the
[1:07:12] son of man and drink his blood you have
[1:07:13] no life in
[1:07:17] you brother random said he Jesus had
[1:07:20] some parasites he had to shake
[1:07:23] off he said he said you know the first
[1:07:26] well there went the there went the
[1:07:27] congregation there there went you know
[1:07:29] there went the 5,000 there there went
[1:07:31] all those that
[1:07:32] left he still had some parasites that
[1:07:35] were hanging around he said okay if that
[1:07:36] offend you what about when you see the
[1:07:38] son of man Ascend up where he came from
[1:07:40] he said okay now the now now they're
[1:07:42] with the minister early Association they
[1:07:45] left and the prophet of God said he
[1:07:48] didn't explain it because he didn't have
[1:07:52] to Hallelujah I don't need an
[1:07:54] explanation
[1:07:57] I can't I can't tell you what's
[1:07:58] happening in my soul all I know is when
[1:08:01] I heard that voice all I know when there
[1:08:03] was a deep calling to a deep there was
[1:08:05] something in there that responded my
[1:08:08] sheep hear my voice and they follow me
[1:08:10] I'm coming Lord I'm following after you
[1:08:13] I ain't got nowhere else to go there
[1:08:15] ain't nothing in the world I want there
[1:08:17] ain't nothing no career nothing nowhere
[1:08:19] there's nothing that means anything more
[1:08:20] than me than the voice of the
[1:08:23] hour I'm coming I'm following
[1:08:27] but if we're not careful we we depend on
[1:08:30] an explanation we depend on some
[1:08:33] sensation we depend on some explanation
[1:08:37] and if we're not careful we start to
[1:08:38] debate and we try to start putting
[1:08:40] things together brother brandham said if
[1:08:43] you say he's been revealed to me and the
[1:08:47] life that Christ produced here in the
[1:08:49] Bible that same life is in him does not
[1:08:52] produce itself in you then you've got
[1:08:54] the wrong revelation
[1:08:59] well let it sink in a little bit maybe
[1:09:01] I'll read it one more time he that hath
[1:09:04] an ear let him hear Look everybody that
[1:09:07] heard wasn't just a uh all a white lily
[1:09:10] and and and no sin and and when they
[1:09:13] heard the word like oh that's me no a
[1:09:16] lot of people heard the word and said
[1:09:17] man I'm a rich I'm a
[1:09:20] sinner Lord forgive me I need your grace
[1:09:24] well you can be sitting on the Pew
[1:09:26] tonight with the wrong
[1:09:29] Revelation but if you got an ear to
[1:09:32] hear and if you say he's been revealed
[1:09:35] to me then the life that Christ produced
[1:09:38] here in the Bible that same life is in
[1:09:41] him does not produce itself in you then
[1:09:43] you've got the wrong
[1:09:46] Revelation people say they believe the
[1:09:48] message but where's the
[1:09:51] life well I could I could you know I I I
[1:09:54] could I could go to preaching a little
[1:09:56] bit here but I don't want to get on any
[1:09:59] hobby horses but our our our our
[1:10:04] conduct the way we conduct ourselves the
[1:10:08] way we talk to one another the way we
[1:10:12] think about them when you're
[1:10:14] alone
[1:10:16] yeah you cannot think about your brother
[1:10:19] and sister and be like well I just think
[1:10:20] they're this way or that way shame on
[1:10:23] you love thinketh no eil
[1:10:25] evil love doesn't it's not selfish and
[1:10:28] thinking on its own and well you know
[1:10:30] that's just the way it's always going to
[1:10:31] be no but but love wants to help love
[1:10:33] wants to cover a multitude of sin love
[1:10:36] says you know what I I believe my
[1:10:37] brother or sister they're struggling I
[1:10:39] want to pray for them that God would
[1:10:40] help them some of us got the wrong
[1:10:42] revelation we can listen to anything we
[1:10:44] want to listen to we can watch anything
[1:10:46] we want to watch we can go to church
[1:10:47] whatever we want to we can read pray
[1:10:49] whenever we want to as long as we go to
[1:10:51] work and have a job and we make a good
[1:10:54] income and we drop a car and we're just
[1:10:56] as selfish as all can be and but I and I
[1:10:59] believe the
[1:11:02] message if you're not careful you're
[1:11:04] going to find yourself in Isaiah
[1:11:06] 4 oh Lord Lord you know we want to eat
[1:11:10] our own
[1:11:12] bread we want to dress any kind of way
[1:11:14] we want to dress but let us just be
[1:11:16] called by your name to take away our
[1:11:19] reproach some of us say we believe the
[1:11:21] message and it's just enough to take
[1:11:23] away the reproach of being a nominal
[1:11:28] Christian but but you you you fellowship
[1:11:30] with everybody in in in in the uh the
[1:11:33] Unseen realm of social media we're not
[1:11:35] going to keep going we're just going to
[1:11:36] keep preaching the word and not try to
[1:11:38] keep you too long but some of us we
[1:11:42] might have the wrong
[1:11:44] Revelation I I I tell you you you have
[1:11:46] to to look at the one that was given the
[1:11:49] Revelation look at the life of Malachi
[1:11:52] 4:5 and look at the life that It
[1:11:54] produced
[1:11:57] if you want to see the right Revelation
[1:12:00] and the the effects of the revelation of
[1:12:03] the hour look at the one who took the
[1:12:04] book and ate it
[1:12:08] up and the life that It
[1:12:12] produced It produced a life of
[1:12:15] humility it put a produced a life of
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:20] service it was a life of surrender it
[1:12:23] was a love slave I do nothing but what
[1:12:27] the father shows me to
[1:12:29] do if that is not the life that we're
[1:12:32] living we must be careful because we got
[1:12:34] the wrong
[1:12:37] Revelation if you sleep while the word
[1:12:39] is being preached maybe you got the
[1:12:42] roong maybe you're lacking brother don't
[1:12:44] tighten it down too much
[1:12:46] well why
[1:12:49] not I live for this man this is game
[1:12:53] seven the bases are loaded
[1:12:56] we're about to win the World Series and
[1:12:59] we're sleeping on the we're sleeping in
[1:13:01] the
[1:13:02] bleachers I I know I know we're going in
[1:13:04] a Rapture and a body change I I know we
[1:13:06] got communion tonight I I know I know I
[1:13:09] know we're living in the greatest
[1:13:11] greatest hour we've ever lived in and I
[1:13:13] know I know all the saints of all the
[1:13:15] ages are looking over the banister and
[1:13:17] and they're saying come on you can make
[1:13:18] it you're you're going to you're going
[1:13:20] to you're you're going to do it any any

[1:13:24] final step and you're going to be
[1:13:30] amen oh no I I can't help it you I I
[1:13:35] can't hear the word
[1:13:38] enough and when I'm getting a little
[1:13:40] selfish and and I'm looking at the news
[1:13:42] or I'm I'm doing things to pass the time
[1:13:44] there's a still Small Voice that says I
[1:13:47] want the word I want to be in prayer
[1:13:50] come on you bag of bones we're going to
[1:13:52] serve

[1:14:01] Bible I'm GNA pray because if you're not
[1:14:03] careful you're just listening to an old
[1:14:05] spooky Spirit but we want to get the
[1:14:08] right revelation we want to get the
[1:14:10] revelation of the hour brother brandom
[1:14:13] goes on to say now notice god making
[1:14:15] himself known not that you're supposed
[1:14:16] to make converts to Christianity by
[1:14:19] government but by the Revelation that
[1:14:22] Christ is in you as God was in Christ
[1:14:25] let's don't move over that too fast now
[1:14:28] notice god making himself known not
[1:14:30] we're supposed to make conerts to
[1:14:31] Christianity by government not that our
[1:14:34] pastor is supposed to stand in the
[1:14:36] pulpit and say sisters you must wear
[1:14:38] your skirts this low and you can't have
[1:14:40] a slip this high and you can't listen to
[1:14:44] this type of music we don't make
[1:14:46] converts and Christians by
[1:14:48] government we we don't have some
[1:14:51] legislators sitting on a board and we've
[1:14:54] elected official officials of the
[1:14:55] message who are going to tell us what we
[1:14:58] can listen to and tell us what where we
[1:15:01] can go and tell us how to dress there's
[1:15:03] only one person that does that and that
[1:15:06] is the person of the word that is the
[1:15:09] Lord Jesus Christ himself and when you
[1:15:12] actually get born again and the life of
[1:15:14] Jesus Christ comes into you he tells you
[1:15:17] how to talk he tells you how to dress he
[1:15:19] tells you how to act he tells you when
[1:15:21] to go to church he tells you when to go
[1:15:23] to work he tells tells you when to pray
[1:15:26] he tells you when to think about your
[1:15:27] brother he tells you all things because
[1:15:29] you are not a servant you are a friend
[1:15:32] you are not just a church you are the
[1:15:34] bride you are coming into a union where
[1:15:36] you are bone of his bone and flesh of
[1:15:38] his flesh life of his life and power of
[1:15:41] his power you have come into a union
[1:15:43] where you're walking with him he has
[1:15:45] come and taken complete control of your
[1:15:47] mind let this mind be in you which was
[1:15:49] in Christ
[1:15:53] Jesus that's how we make
[1:15:57] converts by one
[1:15:59] Spirit are you baptized into this body
[1:16:03] how do I again be born again how do I
[1:16:06] know how to dress right be born again
[1:16:09] how do I know what music to listen to be
[1:16:12] born again how do I know what boy to
[1:16:14] marry be born again how do I know what
[1:16:16] girl to marry be born
[1:16:20] again be born again
[1:16:25] your Doctrine and your religion it's not
[1:16:28] going to save you there's only one thing
[1:16:31] that's going to save you and that's the
[1:16:33] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and as
[1:16:35] you walk in the light as he is in the
[1:16:37] light then we have Fellowship one with
[1:16:40] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] cleanses you from all your sin this
[1:16:43] message is a message of Grace and until
[1:16:46] you get the person of the word the
[1:16:48] person of the
[1:16:52] message it'll start to rule your life
[1:16:56] it'll start to tell you what's pleasing
[1:16:58] to him it'll deal with you correct you
[1:17:02] love is
[1:17:04] corrective it's a revelation the Christ
[1:17:07] in you as God was in Christ as God was
[1:17:10] in Christ Christ in you when what God
[1:17:13] did in
[1:17:14] Christ Christ does in you what signs did
[1:17:17] God in Christ Christ does in you oh
[1:17:19] isn't that
[1:17:23] beautiful isn't that beautiful now I
[1:17:26] don't want to stop short I want it
[1:17:29] all I want to speak to the mountain I
[1:17:32] want to speak squirrels I want to do it
[1:17:33] all now I I know it's not going to
[1:17:35] manifest that way in my life but in my
[1:17:37] heart I know I've seen an example I've
[1:17:40] seen a manifestation of one being
[1:17:43] restored into his position as a
[1:17:45] manifested Son of God so that tells me
[1:17:47] as a sheath way son you're coming just
[1:17:50] keep going just keep believing just keep
[1:17:52] listening you're coming into that
[1:17:54] stature of of a perfect man and when the
[1:17:56] time comes when I need you to speak the
[1:17:58] word don't worry you'll speak the word
[1:18:01] why because it's not you it's me in you
[1:18:04] and when you have the need just like
[1:18:05] Abraham it must have been he needed a
[1:18:08] ram how he Right Said the right thing oh

[1:18:58] you this don't get old to me cuz I need
[1:19:02] this I need to be reminded when a spooky
[1:19:05] Spirit comes around and starts
[1:19:07] whispering in your ear you need to take
[1:19:10] the word of God into a strong hand of
[1:19:12] Faith you say I'm weak no let me ask you

[1:31:54] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:31:56] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:31:58] he staggered not at the promise of God

[1:32:09] as well just start giv glory to God the
[1:32:11] joy of the Lord is my strength I am
[1:32:15] predestinated my name was written on the
[1:32:18] last book of life before the foundation
[1:32:20] of the world there is therefore now no
[1:32:21] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:32:24] Jesus blessed is the man whom the Lord
[1:32:27] will not impute sin that's
[1:32:29] me that's me oh you talking about if you
[1:32:33] only knew what I was you want to know
[1:32:34] why I get happy you want to know why
[1:32:36] brother Orlando jumps up why because I
[1:32:39] know what I was but now I'm not that
[1:32:41] anymore because the grace of God got a
[1:32:43] hold of my life and he changed me now I
[1:32:45] can scream now I can shout now I can
[1:32:48] praise the Lord and there's therefore
[1:32:49] now no condemnation why because it's not
[1:32:52] me it's him and me
[1:32:58] it it it's not an explanation it's a
[1:33:03] revelation ha Thy word Lord look man's
[1:33:08] word will
[1:33:09] fail God's word will never fail that's
[1:33:12] right God's word will never fail coming
[1:33:15] towards the
[1:33:16] close I started my timer late it says
[1:33:19] I've only been 28
[1:33:21] minutes brother randam says out of a
[1:33:24] Paradox maybe we can just we're on the
[1:33:27] last leg let's bring it
[1:33:29] home Christ is the
[1:33:33] word we all know the anointing is
[1:33:38] Christ that comes on the word that makes
[1:33:41] the word live is that right that is the
[1:33:44] anointing now if you want to know why
[1:33:47] we're we're we're moving in this
[1:33:48] direction because the world's
[1:33:51] anointed so it's easy for us to see why
[1:33:54] do people go and shoot up parks and
[1:33:56] shoot up theaters and shoot up Schools
[1:33:58] they're
[1:34:00] anointed they're under a demonic spirit
[1:34:02] that has overtaken their mind and it's
[1:34:05] causing them to carry out actions of
[1:34:08] what they're Anointed
[1:34:10] with how well if you can see it in the
[1:34:14] negative you wonder how are you going to
[1:34:16] take a body change you wonder how you're
[1:34:18] going to do all things you wonder how
[1:34:20] you're going to speak to the mountain
[1:34:21] you're going to do it the same way the
[1:34:23] word world does all those things they
[1:34:25] give over to a reprobate mind you give
[1:34:28] over to the mind of Christ that has been
[1:34:30] unveiled through the revealing of the
[1:34:31] Seven Seals introducing you to the son
[1:34:34] of man that you can come in a union and
[1:34:36] that word can now be expressed through
[1:34:39] you you're being
[1:34:42] anointed you're being
[1:34:45] anointed we all know the anointing is
[1:34:48] Christ that comes on the word that makes
[1:34:50] the word live now some of us aren't
[1:34:52] living the message you believe it but
[1:34:55] the anointing or the spirit hasn't come
[1:34:58] upon the word that you believe to make
[1:35:00] it live that's okay that's not
[1:35:01] condemnation that's letting you know
[1:35:03] that there's more for you to
[1:35:09] receive that comes on the word that
[1:35:11] makes the word live is that right that
[1:35:14] is the anointing I feel some days now
[1:35:17] everybody's scared of the anointing
[1:35:19] Everybody's scared of uh uh you know
[1:35:21] it's become taboo
[1:35:23] we we got to have it that's what it is
[1:35:27] Christ is the anointed who wants
[1:35:31] it the spirit that comes upon the word
[1:35:35] that quickens the word to make it live
[1:35:39] now the word is in your heart you
[1:35:42] believe in Divine Healing whatever more
[1:35:44] see and
[1:35:47] Christ the anointing coming to his body
[1:35:50] see the connection there just like
[1:35:53] husband and wife to become one now the
[1:35:55] church has got to get to the ministry
[1:35:58] until the church and Christ become one
[1:36:01] he can anoint you listen this close he
[1:36:05] can anoint you for every blessing that's
[1:36:09] in the
[1:36:10] [Music]

[1:58:10] tonight you know you think about what
[1:58:13] the world is Anointed with and they do
[1:58:16] all that they do and as our brother said
[1:58:19] there will be just few years years back
[1:58:22] those people will be in a mental
[1:58:25] institution but will say that man will
[1:58:29] be Anointed with the devil and they
[1:58:32] would have a strength more than 10
[1:58:34] people you know even 10 people can hold
[1:58:38] them down and they would do things and
[1:58:40] is describe this woman who was basically
[1:58:43] crawling through her back and just doing
[1:58:46] things impossible he said if it would
[1:58:48] have caught him by his hand it would
[1:58:50] have broke him
[1:58:55] now we know the devil ain't close to
[1:58:58] what our God is we know he doesn't even
[1:59:01] come near to what God is his creator if
[1:59:05] the creation can do such a thing how
[1:59:08] about our creator himself anointing You
[1:59:12] by his word tonight
[1:59:16] hallu you know it just breaks my heart
[1:59:19] and I'll be honest you think the Church
[1:59:21] of the Living God will be packed T ey
[1:59:24] you think people with the needs and
[1:59:26] everything that people struggle with you
[1:59:28] think they'll run used to be a time
[1:59:31] where someone is sick you would rather
[1:59:33] take him to church than to the
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:37] hospitals what has happened to
[1:59:41] us the word is preached and God is here
[1:59:44] calling his people and wooing them to
[1:59:47] come and trying to show you that he's
[1:59:50] got everything that you have need of
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:54] but people rather run to the left and
[1:59:56] run to the right than come to
[1:59:58] him is here tonight he's here everywhere
[2:00:02] his word is being preached he's there to
[2:00:04] make it reality to you he doesn't want
[2:00:08] you to get out of here with some
[2:00:09] explanation or some words that some men
[2:00:11] said no we read the quot is preach as by
[2:00:15] a Matthew just expending and preach and
[2:00:17] preach God is here to tell you that's my
[2:00:20] word that's my word I will make every
[2:00:24] bit of it a reality if you will stand on
[2:00:27] it if you're willing to believe it and
[2:00:29] walk out of here go with it I will come
[2:00:32] everywhere I will destroy the devil on
[2:00:34] your
[2:00:36] way it's him doing it in us he doesn't
[2:00:40] say go and fight figure out how no you
[2:00:43] just take the word you just pronounce
[2:00:45] the word you go by the word you obey the
[2:00:48] word you just follow what he's saying
[2:00:50] and he's doing the battle for you that's
[2:00:56] right here we
[2:00:59] are but we know it's a promise that the
[2:01:02] very bride will only be in the minority
[2:01:05] it's not going to be a popular gospel
[2:01:08] it's only the elected that will be
[2:01:10] attracted and we want to do our best we
[2:01:13] want to do all that we can so that the
[2:01:16] Fulfillment of the prophecy that the
[2:01:19] fullness of God that was promised to be
[2:01:21] p for into us I love that the same way
[2:01:25] that the father sent him he's sending
[2:01:27] you how did the father send him the
[2:01:29] father that send him went in him all
[2:01:32] that God was poured into Christ and all
[2:01:37] that Christ was he poured into the
[2:01:39] church and now we get scared we start
[2:01:42] measuring all what do you mean by all no
[2:01:44] his body will do everything that he
[2:01:49] did If he if he have salvation his body
[2:01:53] will give salvation if he rais the dead
[2:01:56] his body will raise salv will do Sal
[2:01:58] whatever he did his body is here to do
[2:02:01] the same thing otherwise it's not that's
[2:02:04] why he said the prde has to be a word
[2:02:07] prde not another
[2:02:10] bride the same God manifested in his
[2:02:15] people yet a little while the world will
[2:02:18] see me no more but ye shall see me
[2:02:21] because I'll be in you but even in
[2:02:24] you Hallelujah the only way to see
[2:02:27] Christ is to see his people today
[2:02:30] amen oh
[2:02:32] my I just feel like we're could just
[2:02:35] continue but we have communion let's
[2:02:38] open our Bibles for our communion
[2:02:40] scripture
[2:02:41] reading 1 Corinthians
[2:02:45] 13 First Corinthians 11 I'm sorry we
[2:02:50] read that
[2:02:58] man I just feel like God has been
[2:03:01] wanting more and more to show us how
[2:03:04] close we are to this Finish Line his
[2:03:08] word I I don't know about you every time
[2:03:10] it's preached it just comes with more
[2:03:12] intensity and more power and more
[2:03:15] revealing and and and and the more is
[2:03:18] showing us so we could be ready so we
[2:03:20] can know that we are running the
[2:03:22] he doesn't want us to live by ourselves
[2:03:25] he doesn't want us to depend on our own
[2:03:27] selves he want us to depend on
[2:03:30] him amen 1 Corinthian 11 and 23 it says
[2:03:35] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:03:37] which I have also delivered unto you
[2:03:40] that the Lord Jesus Christ the same
[2:03:41] night in which he was betrayed took
[2:03:43] bread and when he had given thanks he
[2:03:46] break it he broke it and said take eat
[2:03:49] this is my body which was broken for you
[2:03:52] this do in remembrance of me and after
[2:03:54] the same manner also he took the cup
[2:03:57] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[2:03:59] the New Testament in my blood do this do
[2:04:03] ye as of as you drink it in remembrance
[2:04:06] of me it says for for as often as ye eat
[2:04:10] this bread and drink this cup ye do show
[2:04:13] the Lord's death till I till he
[2:04:16] come it says wherefore whatsoever shall
[2:04:19] eat this bread and drink this his cup um
[2:04:23] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[2:04:26] of the blood of the body and the blood
[2:04:28] of the Lord but let every man examine
[2:04:30] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[2:04:34] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[2:04:37] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[2:04:40] Damnation uh to himself not Discerning
[2:04:43] the Lord's body for this cause many are
[2:04:46] weak and and and sickly among you and
[2:04:50] many sleep for if you would judge if if
[2:04:54] we would judge ourselves we should not
[2:04:56] be judged but uh we but when we are
[2:04:59] judge we are chasen of the Lord and we
[2:05:02] that and that we should not be condemned
[2:05:04] with the world wherefore my brethren
[2:05:06] when we come together to eat Terry one
[2:05:09] for another and I think that's important
[2:05:12] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[2:05:15] home that ye may ye that ye come not
[2:05:19] together unto condemnation and the rest
[2:05:21] will set in order when I come amen you

[2:19:52] for being ended the devil having put
[2:19:54] into the heart of Judah his carot Simon
[2:19:57] son to betray him Jesus knowing that
[2:20:00] father had given all things into his
[2:20:03] hand and that he was come from God and
[2:20:07] went to God he raised it from supper and
[2:20:10] laid aside His Garment and took a tile
[2:20:14] and GED himself and after he had poured
[2:20:17] water into a basin and he began to wash
[2:20:20] his disciple feet and he wiped them with
[2:20:24] a towel wherewith he was
[2:20:27] skirted then comeing to uh Simon Peter
[2:20:30] and Peter said unto him
[2:20:33] Lord uh do thou wash my feet they said
[2:20:37] Jesus answered and said unto him and
[2:20:38] said what I do thou knoweth not now but
[2:20:42] Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said
[2:20:45] unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet
[2:20:49] Jesus answer him if I wash thee not that
[2:20:52] has no part with me Simon Peter said
[2:20:55] unto him Lord not my feet only but also
[2:20:59] my hands and my head and Jesus said to
[2:21:03] him he that is washed needeth not save
[2:21:06] to wash his feet but is clean every
[2:21:09] width ye are clean but not all for he
[2:21:13] knew who should betray him therefore he
[2:21:15] said ye are not all clean so after he
[2:21:18] had washed his feet and has taken His
[2:21:21] Garment and and was sat down again and
[2:21:24] said unto them know ye what I have done
[2:21:27] to you ye call me master and Lord and ye
[2:21:31] say well for so I am if I then your Lord
[2:21:36] and Master have washed your feet ye also
[2:21:39] ought to wash one another's feet what an
[2:21:43] example all he was bringing it together
[2:21:46] to just show them how important it is
[2:21:49] that is done unto you you do to others
[2:21:53] bringing them all the circle full around
[2:21:55] for for bringing the understanding at
[2:21:57] this final to say that all of this is
[2:22:00] symbolism is will say that men will not
[2:22:03] kneel down to wash one another's feet
[2:22:06] but at the same time the understanding
[2:22:08] of the importance of what is what is
[2:22:10] imparted to us that we should also give
[2:22:13] it to others it said uh if if if then I
[2:22:17] your Lord and Master have washed your
[2:22:18] feet ye also ought to wash one another
[2:22:20] feet and I said for I have given you an
[2:22:24] example that you shall do as I have done
[2:22:27] unto you verily verily I say unto you
[2:22:30] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[2:22:33] neither that neither he that is sent
