[25:23] again
[25:25] today try to get here every 6 months but
[25:27] it's not possible
[25:29] sometimes and
[25:31] um I uh I tried to get away from this
[25:34] but the Lord kept directing me back to
[25:36] the book of Acts amen and I know that
[25:39] everybody hasn't read it the way we
[25:40] instructed 6 months ago but you get
[25:43] another
[25:45] chance and I'm so happy that God is a
[25:49] god of variety that'll be all the music
[25:52] thank you I can't sing like the
[25:55] brother um God is a god of variety
[25:59] I can't preach like
[26:00] Matthew and believe it or not Matthew
[26:02] can't preach like me he can't stand
[26:06] still but we're happy to be here and
[26:09] know that uh things are progressing I've
[26:12] seen the church it's beautiful you all
[26:14] have done a wonderful job and uh God has
[26:18] blessed you so maybe the next time I
[26:21] come we'll be over there but uh tonight
[26:24] we want to look into Acts chapter 13
[26:27] there's got to be something in here that
[26:29] we are going to unpack you know there's
[26:32] 28 chapters and U I can't be here 28
[26:35] services in a row but um we're going to
[26:37] unpack a chapter or
[26:39] two and see what God has for someone
[26:43] here tonight if you've come under
[26:46] expectation God will speak to you his
[26:49] word is still correct it's always right
[26:53] and this is our prophet's absolute can't
[26:56] go wrong and in the first 12 chapters
[26:59] we've studied uh the growth of the uh
[27:02] early church some of the difficulties
[27:04] the church at its beginning when it was
[27:06] getting started and now we've been
[27:08] restored back to the original by a
[27:11] prophet and we're going to be restored
[27:13] all the way back to Eden not just to
[27:15] Pentecost all the way back you know so
[27:19] like I told you before God's map is all
[27:20] on one page I'm sure everybody
[27:23] understands that but of course all you
[27:24] young people with the cell phones you're
[27:27] looking at little piece but God's map is
[27:29] all one page and so he sees the entire
[27:33] picture he knows your entire life you
[27:35] don't have to remind him he knows you
[27:38] now Paul being God's voice of the first
[27:40] age then we have God's voice today
[27:43] through our Prophet the same quality of
[27:46] uh inspired word the same Bible
[27:48] doctrines and that's one thing that
[27:50] attracts our attention to this message
[27:53] is that it's
[27:54] scripture you see Paul saw that there
[27:57] was going to be problems he was a
[27:58] prophet he could see a ways down the
[28:00] road and he um he had been preaching in
[28:03] this one area called
[28:05] galatia and so then he came by a few
[28:08] months later after you know he preached
[28:11] there and baptized and he comes back and
[28:14] these people are kind of wandering off
[28:15] the path you know some other people come
[28:17] along hey you see this and that and
[28:20] start figuring things he said people
[28:23] you've been attracted to a zero you've
[28:25] been attracting to nothing this is the
[28:27] gospel here
[28:29] he said if I come back or Silas or Dave
[28:33] McGary or George Smith or William
[28:35] brandham
[28:36] anybody and doesn't preach what I
[28:38] preached it's going down so we have the
[28:42] word of God we have it in our language
[28:44] everybody doesn't have this there's
[28:47] 7,100 languages on the planet today some
[28:51] are many some are few but there's
[28:53] distinct languages the Bible is only in
[28:56] 700 languages
[28:58] so everybody doesn't have the privilege
[29:00] you have so we're we're going to see
[29:04] these people soon these people we
[29:05] talking about here they're waiting for
[29:07] us we hold the key you know and so we're
[29:11] um we're happy to be here now our
[29:13] brothers and sisters back here they came
[29:15] through some very difficult times you
[29:18] think you have problems because you know
[29:20] the baby's not ready and husband didn't
[29:23] get home from work and how are we going
[29:24] to pay the rent all these little things
[29:27] what if you had to live like these
[29:28] people it'd be a little different story
[29:30] but they came through some serious times
[29:33] persecutions encounters with the law
[29:36] some went to jail some died for it but
[29:39] um you know Jerusalem is where it all
[29:41] started I'm telling you things that you
[29:43] already know because when you teach you
[29:46] have to repeat right just like School
[29:49] repeat because he wasn't paying
[29:50] attention the first time apparently but
[29:52] you see Jerusalem is where it all
[29:54] started and there are still till this
[29:57] day annual pill pilgrimages people going
[29:58] to the upper room people going to
[30:01] Calvary they come from all over the
[30:02] world and some of you have been there
[30:05] and we had plans to be there in March
[30:07] and May and so forth but hey they're at
[30:09] War we're not going maybe December but
[30:12] um it was at Antioch which is a city
[30:14] that is now in Turkey uh that became the
[30:17] center of early Christianity and by the
[30:19] time of Acts 13 it could have been a
[30:22] city of over half a million people okay
[30:25] and it was divided into ethnic groups
[30:28] now the Great American way is to let's
[30:29] put them all together and stir it up and
[30:31] see if it works it hasn't worked all
[30:32] that great but back then they had
[30:35] separation and they had walls the Greeks
[30:38] lived over here syrians Africans Jews
[30:41] but the gospel goes beyond the barriers
[30:44] and uh brings people together in Jesus
[30:46] Christ and that's why we have this
[30:48] multi-racial church here the gospel of
[30:50] Christ is for everybody you see and so
[30:53] that brings us to Ephesians 4 where it
[30:55] says there's one body there's only one
[30:58] Heaven see there's not a Methodist
[31:00] heaven and a Baptist heaven and a
[31:03] Thundurus heaven and a black Heaven oh
[31:05] there's one heaven and we're going there
[31:08] if we live by the word so the scripture
[31:10] says one body one Spirit even as you're
[31:13] called in one hope of your calling one
[31:15] Lord One Faith one baptism so why all
[31:18] the
[31:19] division one God and Father of all who
[31:21] is above all and through all and in you
[31:23] all but un every one of us is given the
[31:25] grace according to the measure of the
[31:26] gift of Christ okay back to the book of
[31:29] Acts chapter
[31:31] 13:1 now there were in the church that
[31:33] was at Antioch certain prophets and
[31:35] teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was
[31:38] called Niger and Lucius of sirene and
[31:41] Manan which had been brought up with
[31:44] Herod the tetrarch and Saul so they had
[31:49] multi- uh ethnic leadership there was
[31:52] Barnabas he was a hel helenistic or
[31:54] Greek from Cyprus from the island he
[31:56] came from a Priestly family he was the
[31:58] leader of the new group then there was
[32:00] Simeon an African there was Lucius of
[32:02] sirene that's Libya another African and
[32:05] Manan childhood friend maybe even a
[32:07] relative of Herod that was the Herod
[32:09] that killed John the Baptist and he was
[32:12] probably a a privileged member of
[32:14] society and then there was
[32:16] Saul he was a Greek from Tarsus with
[32:20] religious training and Roman citizenship
[32:22] these were the teachers and the prophets
[32:25] in the church and so when you read
[32:27] through the book of Acts you'll see that
[32:29] this was the model Church in Antioch and
[32:31] they were blessed of the spirit verse
[32:33] two as they ministered to the Lord and
[32:36] fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me
[32:39] Barnabas and Saul for the work where to
[32:41] I have called them so God always knows
[32:44] what he's
[32:45] doing and see you see this finish church
[32:47] over here that didn't just go up
[32:50] overnight there was a lot of you know
[32:53] massaging and trial and error you know
[32:55] God is eternal his maps on one page page
[32:58] he's not guessing how it's going to be
[32:59] done you know he doesn't say well let's
[33:01] let's think this over let's see if this
[33:03] works let's try this see if it works oh
[33:05] that's not the way God works he knows
[33:07] exactly what works and he doesn't ask
[33:10] you know what do you all think about it
[33:11] either so he knew all all along God knew
[33:15] all along who Saul was that was not a
[33:18] mystery he saw I make make all these
[33:20] mistakes you know God knows what he's
[33:22] doing you see and he knew how how he
[33:25] would use him and he knows each of you
[33:28] now he's going to use you all you got to
[33:31] do is be be uh uh available yes Lord
[33:34] whatever you say no thinking no you know
[33:37] if this will please grandma if this no
[33:40] whatever God wants you see and God knew
[33:42] who you were and how he would use you
[33:44] way back when God was the last thing on
[33:46] your mind you see you can run some of
[33:50] you tried it but you can't hide he will
[33:53] get he will find you Saul was running
[33:56] now he had he had a uh it seem like he
[33:58] had a a real good reason he was uh with
[34:02] the traditions of the fathers and Moses
[34:03] said Moses said but see God doesn't
[34:06] stand still God's word moves just like
[34:08] the sun moves and so uh God called him
[34:12] so let's you know focus on this
[34:14] interesting figure uh our Prophet
[34:16] thought he was very important and so he
[34:19] was born in Tarsus but he was raised in
[34:21] Jerusalem this is
[34:22] Saul his father was a Pharisee that's
[34:25] the elite of Judaism they're at the top
[34:27] the pile the Pharisees and he was a
[34:30] Roman citizen and so um that came in
[34:33] handy but by trade he was a Tent Maker
[34:37] yeah they made tents like today we could
[34:39] say they would be uh just cheap RVs you
[34:42] know something similar and um he was
[34:46] trained by Rabbi gel one of the best and
[34:49] the training of to be a rabbi to be you
[34:52] know U what do you call it a u Pharisee
[34:56] usually began about 14 and went all the
[34:58] way to 40 years old Long training you
[35:01] know and so he became the Jewish
[35:03] council's chief agent of anti-christian
[35:07] activity and they still have that office
[35:09] over there today called anti-missionary
[35:13] activity even our friends from Salt Lake
[35:16] City are there because everybody wants a
[35:19] corner of Jerusalem everybody wants I
[35:22] got an address over here and over here
[35:23] everybody wants to you know they they've
[35:25] said to me many times why don't you buy
[35:27] that building then you can have William
[35:28] brandham Center no thank you we're not
[35:30] interested in bricks you know
[35:33] here and so the uh even the Mormons had
[35:36] to sign papers we will not go house to
[35:39] house okay but they have a nice address
[35:42] over there and um so he was very zealous
[35:46] in keeping the traditions of the fathers
[35:48] you know Moses said and every Sabbath
[35:51] which is satury right here in Dallas
[35:53] right all around the world in the
[35:55] synagogues of the Jews they still read
[35:58] the book of Moses their Prophet the
[36:01] light hasn't come on for him yet but
[36:02] it's coming okay so he was called by his
[36:05] Jewish name Saul probably in memory of
[36:08] Israel's first king and he was a member
[36:11] of The Tribe of Benjamin but after his
[36:13] conversion he started to be called Paul
[36:16] that's right here we'll read that a few
[36:18] verses here that could have been his
[36:20] Roman name you know and even though he
[36:22] was a troublemaker in the beginning God
[36:25] placed him in a position to be a Apostle
[36:28] to the Gentiles that's us he was the
[36:31] Apostle to bring the word this way and
[36:35] um now Luke he's the actual writer of
[36:37] the book but he's only a disciple see
[36:40] you're many of you are disciples you're
[36:42] followers of the
[36:43] word but Luke he was a he was a disciple
[36:47] he wasn't an apostle uh disciple is a
[36:50] follower while Jesus was on Earth he had
[36:52] 12 disciples we all know that and Jesus
[36:55] knew who Judas was from the before he
[36:57] ever called him he had to be part of the
[37:00] picture now I'm sure there's some of you
[37:02] like to put puzzles together I don't
[37:04] have that kind of patience but you know
[37:06] there's only one piece that'll fit right
[37:09] there I might not like that color but
[37:12] that's the only thing that's going to
[37:13] fit there so Judas had to be part of the
[37:16] picture in brother Brandon's Ministry
[37:18] there were people that I wish would have
[37:20] got lost but they were there they were
[37:23] there making his life miserable and he
[37:25] said I'm glad they showed up because if
[37:28] they hadn't showed up I might be in the
[37:30] wrong calling here might be something
[37:32] wrong with me so it was just part of it
[37:34] so Judas had to be there okay so an
[37:37] apostle is one that's sent out a
[37:39] missionary that's in Acts 1:8 so these
[37:42] 11 disciples they became Apostles Thomas
[37:45] was the first Apostle immediately after
[37:49] he saw the the the nail Prince he took
[37:53] off to India he was the first one that
[37:54] took off and he established the gospel
[37:57] of there he died over there and so uh
[38:01] Paul was a missionary an apostle and he
[38:03] was the first church age messenger we're
[38:06] going to get into the rest of it here
[38:07] just pay attention and so Paul you know
[38:10] this person had to have a special
[38:11] anointing to be the bridge to the
[38:14] Gentiles because Jesus told the
[38:16] disciples you're going to be my
[38:18] disciples my Witnesses only to the house
[38:20] of
[38:21] Israel the gospel the whole thing came
[38:23] to
[38:25] Israel and then eventually when to the
[38:27] Gentiles you see but somebody had to be
[38:30] the special person that being Jewish yet
[38:33] could deal with the Gentiles so as this
[38:38] Apostle and being such a stickler for
[38:40] the truth he became much more of a
[38:42] problem for the unbelieving Jews than he
[38:45] ever was for the Christian Believers not
[38:47] in violence but in ideology just in in
[38:49] the thought in the way of of saying
[38:51] things and he was always under threat of
[38:54] his life from his former colleagues the
[38:56] people he was you know fighting with
[38:58] people he was with before that they
[39:00] wanted to kill him so in a nutshell Paul
[39:03] became Christianity's leading evangelist
[39:06] and theologian now we're going to
[39:08] explain that just a minute don't don't
[39:10] tune me out when our Prophet says
[39:13] Theologian because those guys are
[39:15] projecting their Doctrine from their
[39:18] denomination a good Theologian is one
[39:20] who can very capably defend his faith by
[39:24] the scriptures amen not because somebody
[39:26] said so
[39:28] and we've got people today that are
[39:30] brandom theologians mhm I know them
[39:33] brother brand said yeah but you're not
[39:35] living it what about all these other
[39:36] things he
[39:38] said just
[39:40] saying so as his status in the church
[39:43] was Rising his perspective of himself
[39:47] diminished at first Paul considered
[39:49] himself an important Christian leader
[39:52] then later in 1 Corinthians 15 I am the
[39:54] least of the Apostles and not worthy to
[39:56] be called an apostle because I
[39:58] persecuted the Church of God all those
[40:01] people he you know murdered sent to
[40:04] prison whatever he had to live with that
[40:07] the rest of his life God didn't take
[40:08] that out of his mind he had to live with
[40:10] that stuff you know and um so he
[40:13] willingly told about his mistakes and
[40:15] his failures he didn't gloss it over um
[40:19] he didn't pretend uh he didn't always
[40:21] have a happy face he was very Stern
[40:24] sometimes and so he was very human but
[40:26] he was totally God inspired and directed
[40:29] and anointed by God just like William
[40:31] brandham brother brandom says over here
[40:33] in faith 1956 we don't care to be a big
[40:36] number of people I never want to be big
[40:39] I want to be honest I never want to be
[40:42] great I just want to be sincere I want
[40:44] to love the Lord I want to serve the
[40:46] Lord I want to help the people so
[40:49] finishing this verse up here in 1
[40:50] Corinthians but by the grace of God I am
[40:53] what I
[40:55] am now your pastor can only be David
[40:58] McGary he cannot be anybody else I can't
[41:01] be anybody else you got to be you so we
[41:04] we know what he's talking about so
[41:05] without God's Amazing Grace we would be
[41:08] totally lost without hope you know out
[41:11] of here so that's how Paul started out
[41:15] you I'm yeah God's done something for me
[41:17] I'm out here preaching later he said he
[41:19] was capable of nothing good see he keeps
[41:22] going down down that's in Romans 7 then
[41:25] in Ephesians 3 less than the least of
[41:28] all the saints oh he's getting down low
[41:32] and finally in first Timothy chief of
[41:36] Sinners he didn't keep getting bigger
[41:38] and bigger and bigger no he kept getting
[41:40] smaller so the Fearsome Pharisee of the
[41:42] Pharisees became the Fearless Apostle to
[41:45] the Gentiles his motto was to live as
[41:49] Christ to die as gain that should be our
[41:52] our uh word also so brother Rand says
[41:56] make yourself yourself little and God
[41:59] will bring you up he that exalts him
[42:01] exalts himself shall be a based but he
[42:03] that humbles himself shall be exalted I
[42:06] like that he says always keep humble be
[42:09] little be small in your own sight no
[42:12] matter what God does for you just see
[42:14] how much more humbler you can be all the
[42:16] time the more God blesses you just keep
[42:19] getting more humble all the time and he
[42:22] can continue to bless now that might
[42:24] sound like a paradox but that's what we
[42:26] care the
[42:29] level you got to keep things
[42:32] balanced you can't eat chicken every
[42:35] day oh you got to stay balanced and we
[42:38] have to balance oursel with the five
[42:40] Ministries in the scripture now you know
[42:43] what's going to happen if I see you
[42:43] going to sleep
[42:46] okay so when you consider Paul's
[42:49] testimony in Galatians one this
[42:52] transformation didn't take place
[42:54] overnight okay it took about 10 years
[42:58] for him to get it all straightened out
[43:01] yeah and so the lesson is let's be
[43:04] patient with those that are coming along
[43:06] we've got new people here we got people
[43:07] that never heard of Paul never heard of
[43:10] William Brown never heard of Malachi all
[43:12] these things that we take for granted be
[43:14] patient with them be patient with the
[43:17] kids they're coming along slowly you
[43:19] know and U so we know that God loves us
[43:23] we know that he's with us and we want to
[43:25] be patient he he knows what he's
[43:28] accomplishing and how to accomplish his
[43:29] will you see that remember it's by his
[43:32] grace that we Are
[43:33] Witnesses see if there's a wreck out
[43:35] there and police come we didn't see
[43:37] anything we heard it but we're not
[43:38] Witnesses if you're standing out there
[43:40] you can be a witness so Witnesses being
[43:43] um having a uh a personal transformation
[43:46] you know what you're talking about so
[43:49] we're not lawyers to argue the case
[43:51] Jesus Christ is our Advocate we're not
[43:53] judges because nobody qualifies no
[43:55] matter what your name is so in verse
[43:58] three they
[43:59] fasted and prayed says here and prayed
[44:02] and laid their hands on them and sent
[44:04] them away okay we're making
[44:08] progress um Paul was a missionary for 30
[44:12] years and in that time he traveled about
[44:15] 10,000
[44:17] miles he didn't have what we got outside
[44:19] but he walked maybe a rote a horse who
[44:22] knows but um so away goes Barnabas and
[44:25] Saul and their young help John Mark they
[44:28] sailed from the port of salua which is
[44:30] you know there in Turkey over to the
[44:33] island of Cyprus and after preaching all
[44:35] the way across the island they came to
[44:38] the other side to the city called
[44:41] Pathos and they encountered a challenge
[44:44] now this is the westernmost City on the
[44:46] island of of
[44:48] Cyprus and there was a an intelligent
[44:51] there man there kind of like a governor
[44:53] his name was sergis paulus and he was
[44:56] hungry for the gospel so when the gospel
[44:58] came by he made time I want you guys to
[45:00] come over we're going to talk about this
[45:02] so he ARR arranged to hear the preachers
[45:04] but there was also a magician a man that
[45:07] worked with magic worked with Crystal
[45:10] and he was from the Dark Side okay he
[45:12] was a sorcerer he was a false prophet
[45:15] and he was trying to ruin God's program
[45:17] remember every move of God has
[45:21] twins this beautiful church has
[45:24] twins God lets the twin sit here and
[45:29] prosper looks like he's one of us but
[45:32] he's here for a reason right for the
[45:35] perfecting of the
[45:38] pastor he's not leaving you know and so
[45:42] we these twins they were always there
[45:45] look at verse six for example here let's
[45:47] say and when they had gone through the
[45:50] island of papos they found a certain
[45:51] sorcerer okay they ran into this guy
[45:53] false prophet a Jew whose name was bar
[45:56] Jesus
[45:57] which was with the deputy of the country
[45:59] serg just paulus the deputy u a prudent
[46:02] man who called for Barnabas and Saul and
[46:04] desired to hear the word of God but elas
[46:07] the sorcerer that was his name by
[46:09] interpretation uh withstood them seeking
[46:11] to turn away the deputy from the faith
[46:13] now you don't want to hear this these
[46:14] people are crazy but you're okay then
[46:17] Paul whose name was called Paul Saul
[46:20] whose name is called Paul filled with
[46:22] the Holy Ghost set his eyes on
[46:25] him uh
[46:28] if a prophet sets his eyes on you're in
[46:29] trouble you see and he said oh full of
[46:33] subtility and all Mischief thou child of
[46:35] the devil thou enemy of righteousness
[46:37] will thou not cease to pervert the right
[46:38] ways of the Lord and now behold the hand
[46:40] of the Lord is upon thee and you're
[46:42] going to be blind not going to be able
[46:44] to see the Sun for a season and
[46:46] immediately there Came Upon him a Mist a
[46:48] darkness and he tried to find somebody
[46:50] to lead him then the deputy when he saw
[46:52] that what was done he believed being
[46:55] astounded at the doctrine of the lord
[46:58] well yeah things got serious really
[46:59] quick you know and it was all in God's
[47:03] plan we don't have to worry just walk
[47:06] softly before the Lord he will provide
[47:09] the answers you see and so all this
[47:12] happened right in front of the Roman
[47:13] ruler he believed so brother Bram says
[47:16] it's a cursed thing to the Church of God
[47:18] for man to put his hand upon the moving
[47:21] of the
[47:22] spirit yeah you go trying to well I
[47:25] think it should be this way you better
[47:27] zip it cuz things could happen to you
[47:30] you know and um so at this point you
[47:33] know um one of the things it's hard to
[47:37] understand you know all the supernatural
[47:39] that was done in the ministry of William
[47:41] brandham right here in Dallas don't
[47:43] worry about the rest of the world this
[47:44] right here all those people all the time
[47:47] he spent here from 58 or so on where are
[47:51] they you know but you see in the 20 and
[47:53] 21st century we're dealing with very
[47:55] intelligent three kinds of believers
[47:57] yeah so over in verse 13 they sailed up
[48:00] to perga at that point John Mark left
[48:03] the party went home we don't know all
[48:05] the reasons not important but he went
[48:07] home later with the encouragement from
[48:10] Barnabas he became a key leader in the
[48:12] early church now look at chapter
[48:16] 13:14 and when they departed from perga
[48:19] they came to Antioch in pidia and went
[48:22] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[48:24] and sat down they didn't go out there
[48:27] and beat the drums hey we're here now we
[48:28] can start but they came in quietly on
[48:30] the day of service at the right time sat
[48:33] down quietly okay now this Antioch is
[48:37] talking about here uh don't get too
[48:39] excited that's another one of 16 cities
[48:41] of that same name but it tells you which
[48:43] one of peria so let's see where we're at
[48:47] here verse
[48:48] 15 uh after the reading of the law and
[48:51] the prophets so see every Sabbath they
[48:54] read the law and the prophets
[48:58] uh the rulers of the synagogue sent unto
[49:00] them saying yeah you men and Brethren
[49:01] see they've never seen these guys before
[49:03] but they recognize little something
[49:05] different about them if you have any
[49:07] word of exhortation for the people say
[49:09] on okay they arrived at the right place
[49:12] the right time they showed humility they
[49:15] showed respect and they were asked to
[49:18] speak so 16- 41 is a great message all
[49:22] inclusive quoting the prophets
[49:24] Discerning warning let's see what it it
[49:26] says in verse 16 for example Paul stood
[49:29] up and beckoning with his hand said men
[49:31] of Israel and you that fear God give
[49:33] audience okay so he proceeds with a
[49:36] brief history and they couldn't deny the
[49:38] history it's all true what what he
[49:40] saying yeah that's exactly right yeah
[49:43] it's all right okay fast forward to
[49:45] verse
[49:46] 23 so talking about David and of this
[49:49] man's seed God according to his promise
[49:51] uh raised unto Israel a savior yeah
[49:55] Jesus when John had first uh preached
[49:58] before his coming the baptism of
[50:01] repentance to all the people of Israel
[50:04] and as John fulfilled his course he said
[50:07] whom think ye that I am I'm not he but
[50:11] behold there cometh one after me whose
[50:12] shoes of his feet I'm not worthy to lose
[50:14] I can't tie his Sho strings men and
[50:16] Brethren Children of the sock of Abraham
[50:18] and who serve among you fearth God to
[50:21] you is the word of this salvation
[50:24] sent God did all this for you for Israel
[50:29] see they didn't all just fall in line
[50:32] because there's predestinated
[50:34] numbers now the empty bench doesn't
[50:36] scare me at all I'm only concerned about
[50:38] you that did come take something home
[50:40] you know but we don't need all of Dallas
[50:42] here or Bedford anywhere else we just
[50:44] need God's people you see and so verse
[50:49] 29 and when they had fulfilled all that
[50:52] was written of him so he's he's
[50:54] basically telling them this day all
[50:56] these scriptures are fulfilled you all
[50:58] memorized all this back here it's come
[51:00] to pass and they did that according to
[51:03] what it was fulfilled what was
[51:05] written says here they took him down
[51:07] from the tree from the cross put him in
[51:09] s Seiler but God raised him from the
[51:12] dead and that was the that was the
[51:14] critical point okay so they knew they'd
[51:17] been here and knew a bunch of people got
[51:18] fed and got a bunch of people got healed
[51:20] and they killed him now you guys say he
[51:21] rose again where is he if God is with us
[51:25] where's the Miracles well look around I
[51:26] can see a lot of Miracles David's a
[51:28] miracle Les's a miracle you know I'm a
[51:32] miracle and so um uh the resurrection is
[51:37] the Cornerstone of our entire
[51:39] message brother BR says it's the
[51:41] Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no
[51:44] matter what he did if he did not raise
[51:46] again from the dead then all of it was
[51:48] in vain it proves to me that he was God
[51:52] so I don't have a lot of patience with
[51:53] some friends of mine that are the first
[51:55] thing out of the mouth Jesus wasn't God
[51:58] then what are we doing we might as well
[52:01] go get a big TV and sit home no it
[52:03] doesn't work that way you see he says
[52:06] and I think it's the great coronation of
[52:07] the Full Gospel is the resurrection and
[52:10] its Divine promises so to my opinion the
[52:12] resurrection is the greatest of all the
[52:14] promises of the things of the
[52:16] scripture and Paul says here in 1
[52:20] Corinthians if in this life only we have
[52:22] hope in Christ we are of all men most
[52:25] miserable we're we're just going around
[52:27] circles you know but there is a
[52:29] resurrection for those who have
[52:30] surrendered their entire life if you've
[52:33] come here because your mother said you
[52:34] got to come well you might want to pay
[52:37] attention but you got to come because
[52:39] it's real to you you see so those who
[52:42] been have uh surrendered their entire
[52:45] life and can say Amen to all the word of
[52:47] God you see anybody can read and repeat
[52:50] they're doing it in all the churches in
[52:52] Dallas today
[52:53] tonight they're reading and repeating
[52:55] but it's got to be something real it's
[52:57] got to have a life to it you see and so
[52:59] um but there's only a few that can take
[53:01] it serious and live it all others will
[53:04] continue to play Church the day after
[53:06] the resurrection that's the only time
[53:08] that we can retire is after the
[53:09] resurrection see and so after the
[53:13] resurrection there'll be people coming
[53:14] in here pretending because there's three
[53:17] kinds of Believers I wish I could say
[53:19] we're all going to heaven it'd be nice I
[53:21] don't know who all who all is going I'm
[53:23] going so let's go together
[53:27] so he continues the same theme verse 31
[53:32] and he was seen of many days of them
[53:33] which came up with him From Galilee to
[53:36] Jerusalem who are his Witnesses unto
[53:38] this day and we declare unto you glad
[53:41] tidings we got good news for you how
[53:44] that the promise which was made unto the
[53:46] fathers God ha fulfilled the same unto
[53:49] us uh their children in that he hath
[53:53] raised up Jesus again as it is also
[53:55] written second Psalm Thou Art my son
[53:58] this day I have begotten thee so he
[54:01] preaches a very good gospel to them and
[54:04] he could have said enclosing you know
[54:06] like some preachers do um of course what
[54:09] is the point of you saying all this here
[54:11] in Antioch well look at verse 38 it says
[54:14] here be it known unto you therefore men
[54:16] and Brethren that through this man is
[54:18] preached unto you the Forgiveness of
[54:20] sins and that's still the message today
[54:23] that's why this cross is up here that's
[54:25] why we sing these songs right the blood
[54:27] has never lost its
[54:29] power it's by faith we have such a
[54:32] simple message only believe you don't
[54:35] have to figure it you don't have to
[54:36] memorize it only believe so forgiveness
[54:40] of sins to
[54:41] Israel 39 and by him all that believe
[54:45] are Justified from all things from which
[54:48] you could not be justified by the law of
[54:50] Moses beware therefore lest that come
[54:53] upon you which is spoken of the prophets
[54:55] behold you despisers and wonders and
[54:58] perish for I work a work in your days a
[55:00] work which you shall in no wise believe
[55:02] though a man declared unto you so
[55:05] somebody has to there's people to
[55:06] fulfill each part of this message each
[55:10] part of that puzzle has a place so
[55:12] there's people that are going to deny it
[55:13] there's going to people walk away but
[55:15] there's people going to believe because
[55:16] there is a bride okay verse
[55:20] 42 where we at and when the Jews were
[55:22] gone out of the synagogue so he's he's
[55:24] said all this they they just came in to
[55:26] sit down to to visit you know hey speak
[55:28] to us so when the Jews gone out of the
[55:30] synagogue the Gentiles outside hey we
[55:34] want you to preach those things to us
[55:35] next Saturday okay now when the
[55:37] congregation was broken up many of the
[55:39] Jews and religious prelit followed Paul
[55:41] and Barnabas who speaking to them
[55:44] persuaded them to continue in the grace
[55:46] of God so the the fellowship
[55:48] continued and
[55:50] um and 44 and the next Sabbath came
[55:54] almost the whole city together to hear
[55:56] the word of God but when the Jews okay
[56:00] this is the people that was blessed last
[56:01] Saturday when the Jews saw the multitude
[56:04] they were filled with envy and spake
[56:06] against those things which were spoken
[56:08] by Paul contradicting and
[56:10] blaspheming they were
[56:13] humans they had heard it in their mind
[56:15] sounds good yeah it's good but it wasn't
[56:17] in their heart
[56:18] see and so these fanatical Jews you know
[56:22] they they had a different opinion all of
[56:24] a sudden and there's a saying among the
[56:26] Jewish people if you have two Jews
[56:28] arguing there's at least three
[56:31] opinions
[56:33] yeah so what happened here in verse 46
[56:36] says here then Paul and Barnabas waxed
[56:39] bold and said it was necessary that the
[56:42] word of God should first have been
[56:44] spoken to you but seeing that you have
[56:47] put it from you and judge yourselves
[56:49] Unworthy of everlasting life we are
[56:53] turning to the Gentiles in other words
[56:56] he he push delete I'm out of here I
[56:59] tried I give you the best we're out of
[57:01] here
[57:02] so um in 47 for so hath the Lord
[57:06] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[57:08] be a light to the Gentiles that thou
[57:11] should us be for salvation unto the ends
[57:13] of the
[57:14] Earth that's us we're at the ends of the
[57:16] Earth over here you know so very
[57:19] carefully very boldly he just spoke the
[57:21] truth and then 48 and when the Gentiles
[57:24] heard this they were glad and glor
[57:26] glorified the word of the Lord and as
[57:28] many as were ordained to eternal life
[57:30] believe so if that was the only verse
[57:32] that says that there is a predestination
[57:35] in place there are people that are
[57:37] ordained to believe and a bunch not you
[57:40] see it's right there in your Bible and
[57:43] the word of the Lord was published
[57:44] throughout all the region okay so they
[57:47] all heard about it and um things were
[57:50] happening but you see verse
[57:53] 50 uh but the Jews stirred up The Devout
[57:56] and honorable women who's that we're
[57:58] going to get to that man and the chief
[58:00] men of the city and raised persecution
[58:02] against Paul and Barnabas and expelled
[58:03] them out of their Coast out of here but
[58:06] they shook the dust off their feet
[58:07] against them and came to the next city
[58:10] Iconium and the disciples were filled
[58:12] with joy and with the Holy Ghost
[58:14] so um they they raised these false
[58:18] Witnesses you know and it was dangerous
[58:21] and we got the man that was smoked blind
[58:23] up in the other part but right here it
[58:25] says you know the honorable women
[58:26] so during the first
[58:28] century uh women were in public office
[58:31] just like today okay they ran their own
[58:33] business gaining wealth gaining
[58:35] influence the tragedy was that once they
[58:39] uh gained that political and Social
[58:41] Power they employed that leverage to
[58:43] reject the gospel to protect their
[58:46] interests sounds like America today
[58:48] doesn't it the same Spirit has come all
[58:50] the way through yeah clear back there so
[58:53] with this rejection and persecution what
[58:55] did Paul do did you know 911 please help
[58:59] no he called Jerusalem hey send us
[59:02] reinforcements did he have a pity party
[59:05] did you give up and go home no mov on to
[59:07] the next city Shake the Dust off and go
[59:09] I've done that many times when you just
[59:12] can't have Fellowship people just are
[59:14] against it seem like fine I got other
[59:16] places to go there's only 52
[59:19] Sundays
[59:21] brother brother David reminded me of
[59:23] that a long time ago he says it doesn't
[59:25] matter what you preach
[59:27] I've got 51 Sundays to straighten it
[59:31] out got to love
[59:33] him okay we got time let's go into ver
[59:36] chapter
[59:37] 14 says here and it came to pass at
[59:40] ionium the next C that they went both
[59:42] together into the synagogue of the Jews
[59:44] and spake that a great multitude both of
[59:47] Jews and also the Greeks believed okay
[59:49] so they spoke got Believers and they
[59:52] spoke freely there were converts but the
[59:55] twin is never never too far away verse
[59:57] two but the unbelieving Jews stirred up
[1:00:00] the Gentiles and made their minds evil
[1:00:03] affected against the
[1:00:04] Brethren so here's the lesson when you
[1:00:07] come across confusion whatever size it
[1:00:11] comes in whatever color turn and go the
[1:00:14] other way you're not going to change
[1:00:16] people's minds because they're not
[1:00:18] looking for a solution they're looking
[1:00:20] for converts to their
[1:00:22] confusion and God is not the author of
[1:00:24] confusion you see so just leave it alone
[1:00:28] you see so they stayed a long time says
[1:00:31] right here in verse
[1:00:32] three uh they AB Bo there speaking
[1:00:35] boldly uh the testimony and so forth and
[1:00:39] there was wonders done by their hands h
[1:00:43] now John 14:12 was in effect Jesus said
[1:00:46] back there okay you're looking at me
[1:00:48] kind of strange it's back a few P pages
[1:00:50] to the left here uh John
[1:00:54] 1412 say says very
[1:00:57] simply uh verily verily I say unto you
[1:01:00] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:01:02] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[1:01:05] than these shall he do because I go to
[1:01:07] the father and brother brandom you know
[1:01:09] straightened that out he says wasn't
[1:01:10] greater but it's just more of them so
[1:01:12] these these things were happening these
[1:01:13] weren they weren't just sitting there
[1:01:16] and if you'll notice throughout the Book
[1:01:17] of uh acts they weren't out there just
[1:01:20] repeating what Jesus said it was
[1:01:22] actually they were actually living it
[1:01:24] you know and across the page and
[1:01:26] 15:7 it says here if you abide in me and
[1:01:30] my words abide in you you shall ask what
[1:01:32] you will and it shall be done for you be
[1:01:35] done unto you so it was happening they
[1:01:37] didn't have a new testament to quote
[1:01:39] from they were living it it was being
[1:01:41] written right
[1:01:42] then so they only had testimonies they
[1:01:45] had witnesses that was their gospel
[1:01:47] because they were convinced that this
[1:01:49] was the son of God he did raise from the
[1:01:51] dead in accordance to all the scriptures
[1:01:54] back here in the Old Testament so it was
[1:01:56] God in real time living out the promise
[1:01:59] in the first
[1:02:00] church and the only hands that God has
[1:02:03] are your hands the only feet he has are
[1:02:05] your feet yes so yield what you have you
[1:02:08] see he will use you in ways you can't
[1:02:11] even imagine but the confusion continued
[1:02:14] because the troublemakers were anointed
[1:02:16] from the Dark Side determined to bring
[1:02:19] division you know the unbelieving Jews
[1:02:21] also helped the unbelieving Gentiles and
[1:02:24] they abused the missionaries they stoned
[1:02:26] them with big rocks and they were
[1:02:28] totally under control of satanic forces
[1:02:31] and those forces are now maturing in
[1:02:34] 20124 very visible I know some of them
[1:02:37] okay so Paul and Barnabas left town they
[1:02:41] move over to lisra and Derby preaching
[1:02:45] the Good News and In This Crowd where
[1:02:47] they arrived there was a crippled man
[1:02:50] now I don't know if you've ever seen one
[1:02:51] of these people but like one brother
[1:02:54] said it's like spaghetti the guy has no
[1:02:56] muscle they're just you know limp got to
[1:03:00] pick them up you know and so here's this
[1:03:02] crippled man he's never walked he was
[1:03:04] born with the defect no muscle in his
[1:03:06] legs or arms but when he heard the word
[1:03:10] spoken clearly in his language it's
[1:03:12] right there vers chapter 14 he believed
[1:03:16] so while preaching Paul discerned that
[1:03:18] he had Faith to be healed from the
[1:03:20] gospel he was hearing in his language
[1:03:22] and he said in a loud voice 14:10 a loud
[1:03:25] voice stand upright on their feet and
[1:03:28] and he leaped and walked instant Miracle
[1:03:31] now if you've ever spent a week in the
[1:03:33] hospital you got to go through Physical
[1:03:35] Therapy get the muscles going again you
[1:03:37] know right well he's never walked never
[1:03:41] in all these years and all of a sudden
[1:03:43] he's got muscle he can leap and walk and
[1:03:46] jump and so he's
[1:03:49] happy and um you know uh the reaction of
[1:03:53] the people in verse 11 let's say here
[1:03:56] and when the people saw what Paul had
[1:03:58] done he's in a foreign country foreign
[1:04:01] language interpreter no doubt they
[1:04:04] lifted up their voices saying in the
[1:04:06] speech of the lyonia the gods are come
[1:04:09] down to us in the likeness of men and
[1:04:11] they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul
[1:04:13] mercurious because he was the chief
[1:04:15] speaker then the priest of Jupiter which
[1:04:17] was before their City you know he was
[1:04:19] important person brought oxen and
[1:04:21] garlands under the gates and would have
[1:04:24] done sacrifice to the people they were
[1:04:28] serious they saw this Supernatural never
[1:04:31] seen nothing like it obviously something
[1:04:34] Big's happening here let's have a party
[1:04:35] let's have you know roast this oxen and
[1:04:38] so forth so they were totally impressed
[1:04:40] to begin to worship and they gave Pagan
[1:04:42] names to God's servants and uh it seemed
[1:04:45] like it was right to them they didn't
[1:04:46] know nothing about the Bible the pre
[1:04:49] priest is arranging for you know the
[1:04:51] oxen and so forth they were very serious
[1:04:54] you see if a man doesn't have the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost on his soul and in tune with the
[1:04:58] god of the Bible that person will almost
[1:05:02] feel
[1:05:03] comfortable with this type of
[1:05:05] worship you see now you people that come
[1:05:08] from other countries you know what it's
[1:05:10] like over there in the Catholic Church
[1:05:11] it is
[1:05:12] serious they'll give anything because
[1:05:15] that's what grandma did and Grandma did
[1:05:17] you know and so it's simple idolatry and
[1:05:20] God hates it okay but your Revelation
[1:05:24] must be in balance with with the word
[1:05:27] not with brother David's ideas or my
[1:05:29] ideas or even William bram's ideas got
[1:05:31] to be in tune with the
[1:05:33] word over 200 times brother Ram says
[1:05:35] back to the
[1:05:36] word let's pay attention Okay so it's
[1:05:41] got to be in tune with and in balance
[1:05:43] with God's written word not fanatical
[1:05:48] paganism
[1:05:50] so brother R says the real
[1:05:52] church is a real San
[1:05:57] gospel San gospel is balanced it's not
[1:06:00] over here it's not over there it's
[1:06:02] balanced you see the real church is a
[1:06:05] real s gospel right in the middle of the
[1:06:07] road it's not cold and starchy neither
[1:06:09] is it fanaticism it's real good old warm
[1:06:12] gospel heartfelt love of God going right
[1:06:15] down the middle of the road calling from
[1:06:16] both sides and how you going to get that
[1:06:19] church right out of the word the year
[1:06:21] Thum the Bible now Paul wanted wanted to
[1:06:25] get church right in the middle of the
[1:06:26] road so he went and studied three years
[1:06:28] in the scriptures that he knew therefore
[1:06:30] Paul wrote the bigger part of the New
[1:06:32] Testament God had him do that because of
[1:06:34] the coming Gentile age Matthew Mark Luke
[1:06:37] and John the four gospels they were Jews
[1:06:39] but Paul wrote most of the letters okay
[1:06:42] so the reaction of the two missionaries
[1:06:44] in verse 14 of chapter
[1:06:46] 14 uh and when the apostles Barnabas and
[1:06:50] Paul heard of all this they ripped their
[1:06:54] clothes and ran out amongst the people
[1:06:55] saying s why do you do these things we
[1:06:58] also are man like passion like you and
[1:07:01] preach unto you that you should turn
[1:07:02] from these vanities un the Living God
[1:07:05] which made Heaven and Earth and the Sea
[1:07:08] and all the things in them who in times
[1:07:10] past suffered the Nations to walk in
[1:07:12] their own ways in other words he kind of
[1:07:14] ignored it but now that's over with you
[1:07:17] know and so he's he's uh he's upset and
[1:07:21] with all that he hollered and explained
[1:07:23] they almost didn't succeed
[1:07:26] the people were just about to burn The
[1:07:28] Oxen just about to have the big
[1:07:29] sacrifice and worship them but you see
[1:07:32] no true servant of God will accept any
[1:07:35] kind of
[1:07:37] worship it's nice to send Brother David
[1:07:39] birthday card we don't worship the
[1:07:41] pastor like they do in some countries
[1:07:43] you all know that to be true right um
[1:07:46] neither will he allow worship to anyone
[1:07:48] but the Lord Jesus
[1:07:49] Christ brother brandom would not even go
[1:07:52] in privately where only a few people
[1:07:54] would have seen him
[1:07:55] and kiss the pope of Rome his ring he
[1:07:59] had the opportunity believe it or not
[1:08:02] yeah he says right over here in
[1:08:05] um 1954 he's talking it's called the
[1:08:09] India trip report I had an audience with
[1:08:12] the Pope that was scheduled and could
[1:08:14] have gone up and talked to him but when
[1:08:16] I found out you had to kiss his ring and
[1:08:19] his toe
[1:08:21] no I'll give any man his due regards as
[1:08:24] Reverend Dr whatever and take off my hat
[1:08:26] yeah but when it comes to worship
[1:08:28] there's only one that's the Lord Jesus
[1:08:31] Christ and so I will not do that he had
[1:08:34] the opportunity and for those of you
[1:08:36] might be wondering that was Pope Paul I
[1:08:39] mean Pope Pas I 12th who was in from
[1:08:41] March 39 to October
[1:08:44] 58 so once again over here in chapter 14
[1:08:48] the persecution double-minded Fanatics
[1:08:51] they have always been a fa part of the
[1:08:53] fabric of the Gospel we've got the put
[1:08:55] up with them they're they're just part
[1:08:57] of the puzzle you know um if they if
[1:09:00] they did not show up we would have
[1:09:02] reason to wonder are we in the right way
[1:09:05] Jesus said Beware when all men speak
[1:09:07] well of you well we don't have to worry
[1:09:10] about that do we no back in 1950 brother
[1:09:13] Bram said Behold the Lamb of God get
[1:09:15] ready wake up get your conscience back

[1:09:40] appearing critics infidels waxing worse
[1:09:42] and worse yeah
[1:09:44] 1950 not 2000 no 1950 we've got to put
[1:09:49] up with them but we're not looking to
[1:09:51] them we're looking to
[1:09:52] God so the twin must appear okay and we
[1:09:58] have we must have real
[1:10:00] opposition um but you must know that you
[1:10:04] know that you know you got to be solid
[1:10:06] secure and that's why the repetition
[1:10:09] that's why we sing the same songs that's
[1:10:11] why we go to the Lord in prayer to keep
[1:10:14] solid okay um your experience and your
[1:10:17] Revelation must be backed up by God's
[1:10:20] word not by popular opinions doesn't
[1:10:23] matter what everybody's saying stick
[1:10:25] with the
[1:10:26] scripture okay back to our study 14 and
[1:10:31] 19 and there came certain Jews from
[1:10:34] Antioch okay they're following them okay
[1:10:37] who persuaded the people and having
[1:10:39] stoned Paul so not only this is just few
[1:10:43] words but there's a whole package here
[1:10:45] they stoned
[1:10:47] Paul didn't he have bodyguards where was
[1:10:49] Barnabas what's going on no they got him
[1:10:52] out they stoned him and they took him
[1:10:55] took him out of the city supposing him
[1:10:57] to be dead got rid of
[1:10:59] him how be it as the disciples stood
[1:11:02] around about him he rose up yeah they've
[1:11:04] been praying for him came into the City
[1:11:07] and the next day departed unto Derby
[1:11:10] okay so these troublemakers came from
[1:11:13] the previous City got the people into a
[1:11:15] frenzy they stoned Paul and they thought
[1:11:17] he was dead but there was a great
[1:11:19] miracle he rose up so they preached the
[1:11:21] Derby and they returned by the same
[1:11:23] route confirming the faith of the
[1:11:25] Believers verse 22 says
[1:11:28] here um confirming the souls of the
[1:11:31] disciples and exhorting them to continue
[1:11:33] in the faith and that we must through
[1:11:37] much tribulation enter into the kingdom
[1:11:39] of God this is not a
[1:11:41] picnic now just because you're moving
[1:11:43] into a new church doesn't mean you can
[1:11:45] just ah relax you know maybe take a
[1:11:46] little nap no it's still the same God
[1:11:50] still the same spirit and still the same
[1:11:52] preaching so uh it's it's going to be
[1:11:55] through tribulation that we entered into
[1:11:57] the kingdom okay and um we got here 23
[1:12:01] and when they ordained them Elders in
[1:12:02] every church and had prayed with fasting
[1:12:05] they commanded them commended them to
[1:12:07] the Lord on whom they believed and after
[1:12:10] they had passed through uh pidia they
[1:12:12] came to pamilia and when they preached
[1:12:16] the word at perga they went down to
[1:12:19] atalia and so forth 27 and when they
[1:12:22] came they had gathered the church
[1:12:24] together
[1:12:26] and they rehearsed all that God had
[1:12:28] done and they uh and there they Abode
[1:12:32] long time with the disciples so God was
[1:12:36] with these people he's doing things he's
[1:12:38] attracting the predestinated seed not
[1:12:41] everybody believed just a few here and
[1:12:43] there you know and U do we have time for
[1:12:46] one more
[1:12:47] chapter all I want good we got about 20
[1:12:51] more
[1:12:52] here okay 15 we we real quick here verse
[1:12:56] one of chapter 15 and certain men which
[1:12:58] came down from Judea taught the Brethren
[1:13:00] and said except you be circumcised after
[1:13:02] the manner of Moses you cannot be saved
[1:13:05] so here comes these people putting
[1:13:06] burdens on them they can't bear and
[1:13:08] unless you conform to conform to all the
[1:13:10] Jewish Customs there's no salvation they
[1:13:12] want them to come through the Jewish
[1:13:14] ways and then eventually get to
[1:13:15] Salvation and so the 20 24 uh
[1:13:19] translation would be unless you do
[1:13:21] things exactly our way our understanding
[1:13:25] in our revelation of God's word you're
[1:13:27] out of the picture you're going into the
[1:13:29] hot place there's people preaching that
[1:13:31] tonight you have to do it my narrow way
[1:13:35] no but you see Galatians 1:8 like I said
[1:13:39] before if you're not preaching what Paul
[1:13:41] preached you're not part of the parade
[1:13:43] anyway
[1:13:45] okay brother Brown always directed us to
[1:13:48] scripture always brought directedness to
[1:13:50] the open book so circumcision was the
[1:13:53] argument they had that was a covenant
[1:13:55] that God made with Abraham back in
[1:13:57] Genesis 17 so Paul and Barnabas agreed
[1:13:59] to go up to Jerusalem to meet with the
[1:14:01] apostles and settle this question okay
[1:14:04] they stopped at the churches along the
[1:14:05] way they testified and um brought great
[1:14:08] joy to the Believers they met with the
[1:14:10] apostles and told about their Journey
[1:14:12] but again the Pharisees got involved and
[1:14:15] demanded here in verse 5 of chapter 15
[1:14:19] but there were there rose up certain of
[1:14:21] the sect of the Pharisees which believed
[1:14:23] Saying that it was needful to circumcise
[1:14:26] them and to command them to keep the law
[1:14:28] of Moses and the apostles and the elders
[1:14:30] came together for to consider this
[1:14:32] matter okay so they had a church meeting
[1:14:36] and um uh Peter you know told his side
[1:14:40] of the story verse
[1:14:42] 7 and when there had been much disputing
[1:14:45] disputing Peter rose up and said men and
[1:14:48] Brethren um you know how that a good
[1:14:52] while ago God made a choice Among Us
[1:14:55] that the Gentiles by my mouth should
[1:14:56] hear the word of the Lord word of the
[1:14:58] gospel and believe and God which knoweth
[1:15:01] the hearts bear the witness giving them
[1:15:04] the Holy Ghost as he did unto unto us
[1:15:06] he's talking about the house of Cornus
[1:15:08] in chapter
[1:15:09] 10 he says putting no difference between
[1:15:11] us you know and in verse 12 it says here
[1:15:15] and then all the multitude kept silence
[1:15:17] and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul
[1:15:19] declaring the Miracles uh and wonders
[1:15:22] God had wrought among the Gentiles by
[1:15:24] them so they're hearing from Peter
[1:15:26] they're hearing from Paul and Barnabas
[1:15:29] and um this is just a private meeting
[1:15:31] you know with two missionaries told all
[1:15:33] the things that had happened so the
[1:15:35] situation we see here is about 48 ad
[1:15:37] okay and upon hearing the good news
[1:15:40] about the Gentile Believers over here
[1:15:43] these Jewish believers they were getting
[1:15:45] a bit crusty and arrogant well to
[1:15:47] actually be saved the Gentiles have to
[1:15:50] come through Jews first in every sense
[1:15:52] of the word and they must reject uh all
[1:15:55] their uh ethnic ways and background and
[1:16:00] accept all the Hebrew
[1:16:03] religion so there's several angles to
[1:16:06] this debate and and you can read it
[1:16:08] carefully for yourself but there's Peter
[1:16:10] there's the missionaries the third there
[1:16:12] was James a timely reminder that all
[1:16:15] these events correlated with the words
[1:16:17] of prophets so here's the leader of the
[1:16:20] church okay you guys had the experience
[1:16:22] but I'm going to tell you what the word
[1:16:23] says and he's quoting from Amos 9 so in
[1:16:26] verse 15 it says here and to disagree
[1:16:30] the words of the prophets as it is
[1:16:32] written after this I will return and
[1:16:34] will build again the Tabernacle of David
[1:16:36] which has fallen down and I will build
[1:16:37] again the ruins thereof and I will set
[1:16:39] it up and um continuing 17 that the
[1:16:44] residue of men might seek after the Lord
[1:16:47] and all the Gentiles upon whom my name
[1:16:49] is called sayith the Lord who doeth all
[1:16:51] these things known unto God are all the
[1:16:54] works from the beginning of the world
[1:16:56] God can see the whole picture he sees
[1:16:59] every intent every thought he knows when
[1:17:03] the first service will be next door we
[1:17:04] don't know that yet it it'll be
[1:17:07] soon I saw a part of the family ask him
[1:17:10] today well you know sin so God knows all
[1:17:13] these things see and um so he he tells
[1:17:17] these people you know he concludes in
[1:17:18] verse 19 wherefore my sentence and my
[1:17:22] opinion here is that the trouble we
[1:17:23] trouble these people not
[1:17:25] which among the Gentiles are turned to
[1:17:27] God leave them alone they come to god
[1:17:29] let's do it let's have them but we write
[1:17:31] unto them that they obstain from
[1:17:33] pollution from Idols from fornication
[1:17:35] things strangled and from blood for
[1:17:37] Moses of old hath um of old time hath in
[1:17:41] every city them which preach him being
[1:17:43] read in synagogue every Sabbath there it
[1:17:45] is 15:21 every Sabbath they read the
[1:17:49] words of their Prophet just like we do
[1:17:52] in our
[1:17:53] church but they feel to see that the Sun
[1:17:55] moved on you see okay so he concluded
[1:17:59] that and so this pleased them they wrote
[1:18:00] a letter to the new converts and um what
[1:18:04] we have are Paul's letters written to
[1:18:07] the congregations today we have tape
[1:18:08] recordings okay so the Brethren took the
[1:18:11] letter or the epistle that they wrote
[1:18:12] read it to the Saints in Antioch the
[1:18:14] people rejoiced you know the word and
[1:18:16] the spirit and the will of God always
[1:18:18] agree you can't have the spirit and the
[1:18:21] word and the will going in different
[1:18:23] directions they will go parallel they
[1:18:25] don't cross either they they go parallel
[1:18:28] all the time okay they work in
[1:18:31] harmony so you can have a leading you
[1:18:33] can have a Doctrine and I know there's
[1:18:35] people watching on the internet thank
[1:18:37] you Lord for the miracle of the internet
[1:18:40] uh it has some good good things but you
[1:18:43] can have a leading you can have a
[1:18:45] Doctrine even a promise right out of the
[1:18:47] pages of the
[1:18:48] Bible but if it's not in the proper
[1:18:51] season flowing in the economy and the
[1:18:54] plan of God for the hour you'll be
[1:18:56] fighting the will of
[1:18:58] God okay and um you will be fleeing from
[1:19:02] the presence of the Lord and thinking
[1:19:05] you're right I mean you know people like
[1:19:07] that we are right they won't listen to
[1:19:09] anything and it's not even you know not
[1:19:11] even in the Bible but um but if you turn
[1:19:14] your back on the word maybe not openly
[1:19:18] just by indifference by a bad attitude
[1:19:22] you ever read about uh uh Zachariah over
[1:19:25] there in the New Testament John the
[1:19:26] Baptist father he was a priest he had a
[1:19:29] Priestly Duty he was doing something
[1:19:30] there at the altar and the angel
[1:19:32] appeared and he was already an old man
[1:19:34] let's say he was 60 whatever been PR
[1:19:37] praying for years for a baby angel
[1:19:39] appear and answer to his prayer he was
[1:19:43] scared just a little bit of fear and
[1:19:45] because of that couldn't speak for nine
[1:19:48] months so you don't have to just be ugly
[1:19:50] you can just be by indifference a bad
[1:19:52] attitude you'll be fleeing from the
[1:19:54] presence of God following an antichrist
[1:19:57] spirit and an antichrist Doctrine and
[1:20:00] soon you'll be an Anointed with
[1:20:02] arrogance selfishness
[1:20:04] self-righteousness respective persons
[1:20:06] none of which come from God be
[1:20:10] careful okay so if we deviate one degree
[1:20:14] off a true Center that's that's why this
[1:20:15] is important if this if this thing
[1:20:17] wasn't level I'll come back and check it
[1:20:19] over there too but see if it's if it's
[1:20:22] off just just a little bit like that it
[1:20:24] won't hit the target just just a little
[1:20:26] bit the marbles are going to roll the
[1:20:28] other way you so you can be one degree
[1:20:31] off a true Center and you won't hit the
[1:20:33] target but you can take a promise right
[1:20:36] out of context oh it says right here
[1:20:38] well let's see if it's in context let's
[1:20:40] see if it's for the time you know and
[1:20:43] take it right out of this Bible you can
[1:20:44] believe it seriously give your life for
[1:20:46] it ready to give your life but if it's
[1:20:48] not in God's timing and in perfect
[1:20:51] sequence you'll be out of the will of
[1:20:53] God you'll be fleeing from the presence
[1:20:55] of God and thinking you are
[1:20:58] right thank God for sending us a prophet
[1:21:01] fulfilling
[1:21:02] scripture but if you don't know the
[1:21:04] Bible how you going to know you have to
[1:21:06] know your word you
[1:21:08] see verse 36 of 15 we're almost done
[1:21:12] here um and some days later Paul said un
[1:21:15] barnas let's go again and visit the
[1:21:16] brethren in every city where we preach
[1:21:19] the word of the Lord and see how they're
[1:21:20] doing and Barnabas determined to take
[1:21:22] with him John who name was Mark John
[1:21:26] Mark but Paul thought it not good to
[1:21:28] take him with
[1:21:30] them because he departed over there in
[1:21:32] pamilia and went you know didn't
[1:21:34] continue with him and the contention was
[1:21:37] so sharp between these two missionaries
[1:21:39] that they departed one from another
[1:21:42] Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus
[1:21:44] Paul chose Silas and departed being
[1:21:47] recommended by the Brethren under the
[1:21:49] grace of God and he went through Syria
[1:21:51] and cicia confirming the churches so
[1:21:54] we'll take a look later you know a
[1:21:56] closer look at this disagreement but um
[1:21:59] John Mark is a case study in second
[1:22:02] chances he was apparently spurned by
[1:22:05] Paul because he'd gone home from to
[1:22:07] Jerusalem instead of continuing over in
[1:22:09] Chapter
[1:22:10] 13 but it was fortunate that Mark's
[1:22:13] cousin was Barnabas okay he was a
[1:22:15] mentoring model and he was known as a
[1:22:18] son of encouragement and uh just as he
[1:22:20] had done with Paul see the disciples
[1:22:22] didn't want they didn't want to even
[1:22:23] look at Paul
[1:22:25] but Barnabas he brought him in hey he's
[1:22:29] okay so he's a son of encouragement
[1:22:32] anyway so thanks to Barnabas John Mark
[1:22:34] turned out to be a special gift to the
[1:22:35] church he became a valued associate of
[1:22:38] Peter and later in life Paul recognized
[1:22:42] the value of John Mark and he wrote to
[1:22:43] Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:11 take Mark and
[1:22:46] bring him with thee he is profitable to
[1:22:49] me in the ministry so men filled with
[1:22:52] the Holy Ghost and we some of us have
[1:22:54] Liv long see this men filled with the
[1:22:56] Holy Ghost sometimes have
[1:22:58] disagreements yeah it can happen we're
[1:23:01] individuals we have opinions and
[1:23:03] sometimes we find it difficult to bend
[1:23:06] very stiff you know brother R says if
[1:23:08] you can't disagree with a man and then
[1:23:10] shake his hand and still have the same
[1:23:12] feelings towards him then there's
[1:23:13] something wrong with
[1:23:16] you if I can't disagree with a man
[1:23:18] bitterly from one side to the other that
[1:23:20] means all the way across bitterly
[1:23:22] disagree um
[1:23:24] and still think of him as much as Christ
[1:23:27] would then there's something wrong with
[1:23:28] my spirit so that's the stature that
[1:23:31] we're to grow into each one of us be
[1:23:33] able to disagree and still think of him
[1:23:36] as much as brother as Christ does so in
[1:23:40] verse 27 we met the um the some of these
[1:23:44] Brethren from the early church Judas
[1:23:46] Silas they accompanied Paul and Barnabas
[1:23:49] back to Antioch and um then they
[1:23:52] returned to Jerusalem but anyway it's
[1:23:54] all part of the big Fabric and I
[1:23:56] encourage you to read your Bible amen
[1:24:00] nobody wants to stay away from God you
[1:24:01] want to get closer to God well when you
[1:24:05] when you pray you're speaking to God and
[1:24:08] then you be quiet he speaks to you when
[1:24:09] you read your Bible anywhere in this
[1:24:11] Bible that you pick up and read God is
[1:24:13] speaking to
[1:24:15] you God bless
[1:24:18] [Applause]
[1:24:23] you amen
[1:24:25] not only did you get a lesson from the
[1:24:27] Bible you got a lesson in how to read
[1:24:30] your
[1:24:31] Bible you know if the Bible raises
[1:24:34] questions you study to show your self
[1:24:37] approved you know let it Let Let it
[1:24:40] speak to you and and let it let it talk
[1:24:43] to you and I you know as he was reading
[1:24:46] that uh you know a a a scripture really
[1:24:50] stood out to me and it was in the 13th
[1:24:54] chapter
[1:24:55] as we're reading in the 27th verse and
[1:25:00] and
[1:25:03] so this struck out to me because as
[1:25:07] brother George was going through the
[1:25:08] scripture there were people that heard
[1:25:12] the scriptures every day and it never
[1:25:15] meant anything to them and this is what
[1:25:18] it says and he's he's talking about and
[1:25:21] he's talking about he was talking about
[1:25:24] how now that the elders had rejected the
[1:25:27] gospel and rejected Jesus and listen to
[1:25:30] what he says here he says for they that
[1:25:34] dwelleth at
[1:25:36] Jerusalem and their uh and their rulers
[1:25:41] because they knew him
[1:25:45] not now listen nor yet the voice of the
[1:25:52] prophets which
[1:25:55] which are read every
[1:25:58] Sabbath
[1:26:01] day
[1:26:04] look they read them every Sabbath day
[1:26:07] and they never knew them they never
[1:26:10] studied they never looked at his life
[1:26:12] they never took him back to the word of
[1:26:15] God and took it back to the scriptures
[1:26:18] you know and and
[1:26:20] we're we are given in instruction when
[1:26:25] you see something study it by the word
[1:26:29] give it the word test how many did here
[1:26:31] our prophecy give it the word test give
[1:26:33] it the word test see if he's fulfilling
[1:26:35] the scriptures see if he was fulfilling
[1:26:38] the things that were spoken and and then
[1:26:41] I I just that just struck me he
[1:26:44] said which were read every day and they
[1:26:46] have fulfilled them in condemning him
[1:26:50] exactly what the word of God said they
[1:26:52] would do so I just think it's uh
[1:26:56] marvelous I I like going through the
[1:26:58] Bible like this and and studying it and
[1:27:02] uh I picked up on a lot of little things
[1:27:06] that um you know we always heard that
[1:27:09] scripture that Paul turned to the
[1:27:11] Gentiles well it was the Gentiles that
[1:27:14] were right there asking him to come
[1:27:16] preach to them he said okay I'm done I'm
[1:27:19] going to go to somebody that wants to
[1:27:21] receive it so let's come in so I we
[1:27:24] don't know uh how we're ever going to
[1:27:26] get through the book of Acts if George
[1:27:28] only comes twice a year so we might have
[1:27:31] to have them uh come a little more often
[1:27:35] and so we can get done with this book
[1:27:39] and uh go on so um you know so I mean
[1:27:44] that my goodness when we get over here
[1:27:46] we're going to it's going to be the
[1:27:48] Rapture might come
[1:27:51] before tonight amen so do you love the
[1:27:55] Lord amen keep us in prayer uh I there's
[1:27:59] just a lot of good things there I really
[1:28:01] enjoyed it I think it was placed to us
[1:28:04] good enough that we could each hear for
[1:28:07] ourselves and apply the word to
[1:28:09] ourselves so let's pray uh keep in mind
[1:28:13] that we've asked our inspector to return
[1:28:17] uh this Friday to uh give our building
[1:28:20] one more look over and I I think brother
[1:28:23] Rogers made it bug proof he's went
[1:28:26] around and filled every little hole and
[1:28:29] every little uh uh crack and everything
[1:28:34] so we hope he's happy and we've done
[1:28:37] everything that he's asked us to do so
[1:28:41] uh maybe just the spirit of the Lord
[1:28:45] would come on them
[1:28:47] H and uh he'd be gracious and merciful
[1:28:51] to us but you notice here how all these
[1:28:53] guys eyes kept falling around causing
[1:28:55] trouble causing
[1:28:58] trouble you know brother Bram said when
[1:29:00] he was they were trying to re model the
[1:29:03] Tabernacle he'd go down to the city and
[1:29:06] give him something else and go down to
[1:29:07] the city something else so that's been
[1:29:10] our lot but I think that we're ready to
[1:29:13] overcome amen how many believe we can
[1:29:16] overcome amen so just pray and if
[1:29:20] if we can get through this red tape
[1:29:24] then we have our handicap inspection
[1:29:28] coming so if we can get through that and
[1:29:31] everything worked good we were going to
[1:29:33] try to have our first service Easter but
[1:29:37] so many people were going to Camp that
[1:29:40] if possible by the grace of God we'll
[1:29:43] try to have our first service the first
[1:29:45] Sunday after Easter if everything goes
[1:29:49] well if it doesn't go well we'll just
[1:29:51] keep moving it up and until we do it uh
[1:29:56] and then we we're going to want to have
[1:29:58] service
[1:30:00] for um a few Sundays in a row to get all
[1:30:05] the U things that we don't know yet they
[1:30:09] will all rise to the surface uh there's
[1:30:12] probably problems everywhere just
[1:30:14] sitting there to come to the surface and
[1:30:19] um so uh we'll uh do that in and then
[1:30:24] after we have a few services and we feel
[1:30:27] everything's good the deacons feel they
[1:30:30] have you uh under control uh doing what
[1:30:34] they ask you to do then we will go ahead
[1:30:37] and uh set a date for our dedication
[1:30:40] service and we'll have a dedication so
[1:30:43] is everybody on board with that amen so
[1:30:46] are youall going to go home and study
[1:30:48] the book of Acts and and uh and go into
[1:30:52] it's a great book it really is it this
[1:30:56] tells you how that they lived by faith
[1:31:00] and didn't the thing that Malachi for
[1:31:03] did was to restore back the faith of
[1:31:06] these men so if you're going to see the
[1:31:09] faith of the men read the book that
[1:31:11] describes their faith and how they
[1:31:14] endured and how they pursued and how
[1:31:17] they kept going forward and how when
[1:31:19] they got knocked down they got back up
[1:31:22] how they loved their enemy how how they
[1:31:24] spread this word to anybody that would
[1:31:27] hear it and bringing the good news of
[1:31:31] the Gospel all of us should be doing
[1:31:33] that if we have their same Faith you
[1:31:35] believe that amen God bless you tonight
[1:31:38] let's stand
[1:31:47] together oh okay uh what George Don't We
[1:31:52] Tell
[1:31:54] so yesterday we went over to see Enrique
[1:31:57] he's the brother-in-law translator right
[1:32:01] yes okay adri yeah this boy was in a bad
[1:32:04] accident Sunday night he apparently was
[1:32:07] going too fast and he wrapped his car
[1:32:09] around a telephone pole you can barely
[1:32:13] see what kind of car it was the whole
[1:32:15] left side whole right side is matched up
[1:32:17] his eyes so that was hurt anyway we went
[1:32:19] to see him and as soon as we came in he
[1:32:21] started crying oh somebody actually
[1:32:23] loves me and we were able to pray with
[1:32:27] him and so he's he's got his wakeup call
[1:32:31] we expect him in here anytime soon to
[1:32:34] give his heart to the Lord so remember
[1:32:37] Enrique
[1:32:40] amen amen yeah he really was he just uh
[1:32:44] when me uh brother George and I uh came
[1:32:47] up to his
[1:32:48] bedside he just reached out his hand he
[1:32:50] said I'm so glad to see you he just
[1:32:52] started balling
[1:32:54] and everything and and then he said I'm
[1:32:57] so grateful in my heart that God let me
[1:33:01] stay here with my family he knows he was
[1:33:07] this far away and you talk about
[1:33:11] attitude you know when something when
[1:33:14] you come this close to the death your
[1:33:17] attitude towards life
[1:33:19] changes so you know it's and you know
[1:33:23] let me tell you one thing that I've the
[1:33:25] scriptures have done for me as I read
[1:33:28] them it's always been an attitude
[1:33:31] changer for me it's always been to
[1:33:35] redirect the path that I'm on and that's
[1:33:39] what the word of God's given for it's
[1:33:40] given for correction it's not given to
[1:33:44] condemn or punish it's given to alter
[1:33:48] your way and your direction so it's it's
[1:33:52] always been great so uh you know we also
[1:33:57] in seeing him in the
[1:33:59] hospital um at Baylor we went down to
[1:34:04] the they call it the truet building
[1:34:06] probably one of the first buildings that
[1:34:09] they had there and they built building
[1:34:11] after building around it but they have
[1:34:14] hands of all the great Physicians and uh
[1:34:19] cast to their hands great actors
[1:34:22] scientist all the Astros Nots all of
[1:34:25] them are a great big row then you come
[1:34:28] down the rad and then they get to Billy
[1:34:30] Graham and they have his hands in his
[1:34:33] own
[1:34:35] compartment almost like it was a
[1:34:37] reverence and a sacredness they know did
[1:34:41] you know they had one of the hands of
[1:34:44] the three Messengers that came to this
[1:34:47] age and they have his hands in a little
[1:34:50] special place there amen I just thought
[1:34:55] you know it's funny men testify to
[1:34:58] God whether they want to or not just
[1:35:02] like we read that scripture he said they
[1:35:05] read the scriptures every day and they
[1:35:08] fulfilled them by condemning
[1:35:11] him amen I don't want to be on that side
[1:35:14] of fulfilling the scriptures do you amen
[1:35:17] I want to be on the right side not the
[1:35:20] dark side but the right side so if you
[1:35:24] have somebody on your heart as we bow
[1:35:26] our heads that you'd like the Lord to do
[1:35:28] something for or maybe you'd like to
[1:35:30] have the courage to share this gospel
[1:35:34] with
[1:35:35] somebody
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:38] and and maybe you have a complex or some
[1:35:42] doubt and you just like to be free for
[1:35:46] from it then you could be a greater
[1:35:48] light
[1:35:50] and have an experience because as we
[1:35:54] read that scripture they knew him
[1:35:56] not they didn't know him but don't you
[1:36:00] want to know him deeper and and greater
[1:36:03] in a way
[1:36:05] that that you know that you've got
[1:36:08] something to
[1:36:09] share without any doubt that you've got
[1:36:13] something to share God did something for
[1:36:15] you and if there's nothing else you can
[1:36:18] share share what God's done for
[1:36:21] you Share how your candle got lit share
[1:36:25] with a great God that you know that he
[1:36:28] is people are hungering for something
[1:36:31] genuine they're hungering for something
[1:36:35] that's
[1:36:36] real somebody that knows what they're
[1:36:39] talking about and maybe you in your
[1:36:41] heart you'd like just to have that
[1:36:44] closer relation with relationship with
[1:36:49] him that when you tell somebody you know
[1:36:52] in your heart you know what you're
[1:36:54] talking about believe me they will know
[1:36:58] you know what you're talking about and
[1:37:00] the Lord will bless us so if you have a
[1:37:02] desire in your heart if you'd bring it
[1:37:04] before the Lord right now and we'll ask
[1:37:07] the Lord to bless it our graciously

[1:37:14] before you father our hands are raised
