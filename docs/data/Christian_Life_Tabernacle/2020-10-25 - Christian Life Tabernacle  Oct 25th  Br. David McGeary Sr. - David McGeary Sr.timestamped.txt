[40:19] amen our gracious heavenly father we
[40:21] certainly
[40:22] ask you to bless us this morning
[40:24] as we just fellowship around your word
[40:27] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[40:29] christ we pray
[40:31] amen
[40:32] amen god bless you may be seated
[40:39] thank you sarah for playing for us today
[40:41] sister sarah played for us today and
[40:45] uh
[40:46] we uh
[40:48] would just like to explain just a moment
[40:52] the reasons uh why that we've taken
[40:56] these last few services off
[41:00] a couple weeks ago it was brought to my
[41:03] attention that
[41:05] several
[41:07] people within the congregation
[41:10] were beginning to have
[41:13] flu-like
[41:15] symptoms and
[41:18] where john could you get the back doors
[41:20] for me please and uh uh
[41:23] and because they were having um
[41:26] these symptoms we didn't know
[41:29] uh who was in contact with whom
[41:32] and we didn't know exactly uh
[41:35] if it was flu or
[41:38] uh
[41:39] covid19 or exactly what it was
[41:43] so we've been told and we're we can only
[41:46] go on things that we're told
[41:50] so and we know that those things that we
[41:52] are told change
[41:54] rapidly
[41:56] but
[41:57] basically they say that there's a couple
[41:59] week period in which people can
[42:04] catch it so we didn't know who had
[42:06] contact with who
[42:07] we didn't know how many people in the
[42:09] congregation
[42:11] may have been contact in contact with
[42:13] the people that were sick
[42:15] a few of them tested
[42:17] a positive but they had no symptoms
[42:20] whatsoever
[42:23] others tested negative
[42:25] and
[42:26] so we just felt if we took two weeks off
[42:30] then any
[42:31] cases that would have come up or any new
[42:34] cases or anybody that was sick
[42:38] we'd give it time to manifest and then
[42:40] they could do
[42:42] what they needed to do without
[42:45] causing any spread or any
[42:49] uh
[42:50] passing along and we always try to do
[42:53] these things if you're sick
[42:55] and you're not feeling well stay home
[42:59] the scripture says call for the elders
[43:02] the church and they'll come anoint you
[43:04] with oil and they'll pray for you
[43:06] so okay you know if you have a child
[43:08] that's sick i know you love to go to
[43:10] church and that's one of the biggest
[43:12] burdens
[43:13] of having
[43:16] children is that
[43:17] they
[43:18] take your care and they take your time
[43:21] and you can't always do the things that
[43:23] you would like to do because of your
[43:25] children and sometimes they get sick and
[43:28] it's better that
[43:30] you don't bring sick children to church
[43:33] and because they make the other children
[43:35] sick and
[43:36] and so if you're not feeling well and
[43:38] you're sick then
[43:40] be in consideration for others
[43:43] and so we're still practicing what
[43:46] we've
[43:47] believed to practice
[43:49] according to our compute community so we
[43:53] do the things we do because we're part
[43:55] of the community our church is in
[43:58] bedford and we're part of bedford
[44:00] and
[44:01] so
[44:02] uh we still want to continually wash our
[44:05] hands
[44:06] you know
[44:07] wear face masks if
[44:10] if you feel like you need to i can't
[44:12] enforce face masks but they feel the
[44:15] word face mask if you try to keep with
[44:18] social distancing
[44:20] you can keep try to sit together in
[44:23] family groups when you come to church
[44:25] sit together
[44:26] in family groups that it
[44:28] less exposure
[44:30] and uh
[44:31] so it doesn't seem like any new people
[44:34] have
[44:36] contacted any sickness and
[44:39] everybody just seems to be doing
[44:42] well in that regard and we've not had
[44:45] any
[44:46] real serious
[44:48] sickness whatsoever i tested and i
[44:51] tested negative
[44:53] and uh
[44:54] and we've had other people test negative
[44:57] so if you have any questions
[45:00] uh
[45:01] and you'd like to come to church and
[45:03] you're worried just go
[45:05] take a test
[45:07] and if you come back and you're negative
[45:10] just feel free to come to church if
[45:12] you're feeling fine you don't have any
[45:14] symptoms
[45:15] feel free to come to church we'll try to
[45:17] have service again
[45:20] next
[45:21] sunday
[45:23] if you're still a little nervous then
[45:25] feel free to stay home
[45:27] and
[45:28] pretty soon
[45:30] things will
[45:31] change
[45:33] i think for the better but i just felt
[45:36] it was
[45:38] the right thing for me to do and not
[45:40] knowing and wanting to keep everybody
[45:43] safe
[45:44] and mostly the people that have problems
[45:46] are elderly people
[45:48] who have pre-existing conditions
[45:52] it's not very hard on young people
[45:55] but so we just postponed everything
[45:58] and i hope that you uh
[46:01] still are faithful to service i hope
[46:04] that
[46:05] you do stream
[46:06] the services and know what's on our
[46:09] heart and know what's on the brother's
[46:11] heart
[46:12] and so next sunday we'll uh try to pick
[46:15] up and if something happens again
[46:18] uh we might repeat this procedure
[46:21] over a pin and with limited
[46:25] seating we might go back to 50 percent
[46:28] or something like that if we don't have
[46:30] any problems we're just going to forge
[46:32] forward
[46:33] by faith amen
[46:36] so
[46:37] there's not
[46:39] there's not
[46:40] um much else that i know what to do
[46:47] it's just one of those things i just
[46:49] don't know
[46:50] how to express it to you but let's go
[46:53] ahead and and
[46:55] we'll take a moment and and
[46:58] study the word of god if uh
[47:01] if if we could do that i'd like to turn
[47:05] in the book of samuel
[47:07] if you would stand the first samuel for
[47:09] the word of the lord
[47:13] and i just have a little thought on my
[47:15] heart and a word of encouragement
[47:19] if i
[47:20] i may and
[47:23] uh
[47:25] and i this is a
[47:27] a great a little scripture
[47:31] and
[47:32] it's the wisdom
[47:34] of the lord through sam uh the lord
[47:37] speaking to samuel
[47:40] so many times we look on the outward
[47:42] appearance of things
[47:44] but god doesn't judge by the outside he
[47:47] judges by the inside
[47:49] so let's just read this little scripture
[47:52] for a text and then we'll just share the
[47:55] word of the lord with you a little bit
[47:57] this morning and hope that it's an
[47:59] encouragement to you
[48:01] and bringing
[48:02] it down to our day
[48:05] but the lord said unto samuel
[48:08] look not
[48:09] on his countenance
[48:12] or on the height of his stature
[48:16] because i have refused him
[48:19] for the lord seeth not as man seeth
[48:24] for man looketh on the outward
[48:26] appearance
[48:28] but the lord looketh
[48:30] on
[48:32] the heart
[48:33] amen heavenly father we ask you to bless
[48:35] your word
[48:36] in your precious name we pray
[48:39] amen god bless you you may be seated
[48:43] i'd like this morning
[48:45] just to
[48:47] if i could say that that god looks on
[48:50] the inward man
[48:52] he looks on the heart of man
[48:54] that he knows what's in man's heart and
[48:58] and how that man is made up
[49:02] and
[49:03] uh
[49:04] and so you know god
[49:07] uh looks
[49:08] and upon man and you know a lot of times
[49:11] we feel that god doesn't
[49:13] isn't watching
[49:15] and the prophet of god said
[49:19] in
[49:19] the word of the lord speaking to us
[49:23] he said that man does the things that he
[49:27] does
[49:28] because he feels that god's not watching
[49:32] but we know the angels of the lord they
[49:35] go to and fro
[49:36] across the earth marking them that sigh
[49:40] and cry at the abominations
[49:43] that see the way that the world's going
[49:48] and how that they're
[49:51] depressed
[49:53] if i could use that word and how they're
[49:55] discouraged and and how that they
[50:00] tremble
[50:01] in their spirits at the iniquity
[50:05] that is was upon the face of the earth
[50:08] and if it was uh just became a burden
[50:14] and i think that we all sense the
[50:17] pressure
[50:18] of the things that are taking place in
[50:23] our world and in our country
[50:26] and though we're we're not
[50:29] we're in this world but we're not of
[50:31] this world
[50:33] and we have
[50:34] many times we feel the pressure
[50:38] wondering what effects will these things
[50:41] have on us
[50:43] is our religious freedom at stake
[50:47] is
[50:49] we've already watched the things that we
[50:52] held dear the sacredness of marriage
[50:56] we've seen that
[50:58] been taken from us
[51:00] and i noticed that
[51:02] many of you
[51:06] heard this week the
[51:09] announcement
[51:11] of
[51:12] the pope
[51:14] now there are 63 million catholics
[51:17] in the united states of america
[51:20] my mother is a catholic and
[51:22] my family's catholic my relatives i come
[51:25] from a catholic background
[51:28] and
[51:30] as the catholic faith they believe that
[51:33] the pope
[51:34] is the vicar of christ
[51:37] in other words he's on earth instead of
[51:41] the lord jesus
[51:43] he's the holy one they they his his
[51:47] title is holy father
[51:49] and
[51:50] and they they hold him in
[51:52] that esteem
[51:54] that
[51:55] he speaks
[51:57] and when he speaks he has infallibility
[52:01] so he's infallible when he speaks that's
[52:04] the
[52:06] honor
[52:07] that they've bestowed upon his office
[52:10] and they hold him in that regard
[52:14] and this week you know that he made a
[52:19] declaration
[52:22] that marriage between
[52:25] the same genders
[52:28] is acceptable
[52:30] in civil court
[52:33] in other words he says
[52:35] it's it's okay if you do it
[52:38] in the court as an legal
[52:42] natural marriage it's not something that
[52:45] we will do in the church
[52:47] but we will still recognize it outside
[52:51] of the church
[52:53] and uh of course to me that's a
[52:55] compromising you know in fact
[52:58] to me it's against the word of god
[53:01] but you have the the the vicar of christ
[53:05] you have the person that they consider
[53:08] to be the head
[53:10] of the free world
[53:13] the head of the great mother harlot and
[53:15] all her daughters and you know what
[53:18] happens they will follow suit
[53:20] so in other words we've watched the
[53:24] we've watched uh our
[53:27] country
[53:28] uh
[53:29] change
[53:31] where now
[53:32] uh marriages are
[53:34] fine and
[53:36] uh so many other things that
[53:39] a
[53:40] morality have changed over the years
[53:44] and it brings me to uh a great
[53:48] a scripture and we're going to read some
[53:50] scriptures and have a little bible study
[53:53] this morning but in genesis the sixth
[53:55] chapter
[54:00] and if we read in
[54:02] genesis the sixth chapter
[54:06] it says and the lord said my this is the
[54:09] genesis sixth chapter and the third
[54:11] verse i'm sorry genesis the sixth
[54:13] chapter
[54:15] and the third verse
[54:18] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[54:21] always strive with man.
[54:24] for
[54:26] that he also is flesh
[54:29] yet his days
[54:31] shall be
[54:32] a hundred and twenty years
[54:36] and there were giants in the earth in
[54:38] those days
[54:39] and
[54:40] also after that
[54:42] when the sons of god
[54:45] come into the daughters of men
[54:48] and they bear children to them
[54:51] and the same became mighty men which are
[54:54] of old men of renowned
[54:57] and god saw
[54:59] that the wickedness of man was great in
[55:03] the earth
[55:05] and that every imagination of the
[55:09] thought of his heart
[55:11] was only evil
[55:13] continually
[55:15] now if this ever was a day of
[55:17] imagination
[55:18] it's now
[55:21] and it repented the lord that he had
[55:25] made man
[55:26] on the earth
[55:28] and it grieved him at his heart
[55:31] and the lord said i will destroy man
[55:34] whom i have created from the face of the
[55:37] earth both man and beast and creeping
[55:41] things and the fowls of the air
[55:44] for it repenteth me that i have made
[55:48] them
[55:49] but noah found grace in the eyes
[55:53] of the lord
[55:55] now in the midst of all this wickedness
[55:59] there was one that found grace
[56:02] in the eyes of the lord may i could say
[56:05] it this way
[56:06] noah was elected
[56:09] and chosen
[56:11] he was made the way that he was made in
[56:16] order to obtain his righteousness in
[56:19] order to obtain favor and god with god
[56:22] he he was made that way
[56:26] and if we go look then at the 6 the 17th
[56:29] verse
[56:32] and
[56:33] the lord had told
[56:35] noah to build a ship
[56:37] a boat that we call an ark and the 17th
[56:41] verse says and behold i even i
[56:46] do bring a flood of waters
[56:49] upon the earth to destroy all flesh
[56:53] wherein is the breath of life from under
[56:56] heaven
[56:57] and everything
[56:59] that is in the earth
[57:01] shall
[57:03] die
[57:04] amen and when we see here that
[57:09] noah
[57:10] heard this message
[57:13] you understand to know
[57:15] this was a prophecy
[57:17] okay he it wasn't a
[57:20] note in history he was telling noah
[57:23] build this boat you have found favor in
[57:26] my
[57:26] sight
[57:27] follow my instructions follow my word
[57:30] build this ship because
[57:33] thus saith the lord i'm going to make it
[57:36] rain it's going to i'm going to flood it
[57:39] didn't say he was going to rain he says
[57:41] i'm going to bring a flood upon the
[57:44] earth and destroy all flesh now
[57:48] no
[57:49] noah was elected
[57:52] to receive that prophecy
[57:56] he heard that message
[58:00] you understand god gave him a message
[58:03] and he heard that message and the
[58:05] message was i the iniquity
[58:08] has been filled in my sight i'm not
[58:11] going to allow man to live in this way
[58:15] in this condition i'm going to destroy
[58:18] him
[58:19] and so that was the message and and
[58:22] noah received and he heard that message
[58:25] now he didn't care
[58:27] what was happening in the world around
[58:30] him
[58:32] he lived by the message
[58:35] that he received
[58:37] that's what he lived by
[58:39] now can you imagine what was going on
[58:42] during that time all those years
[58:45] that he preached
[58:47] man was
[58:48] prospering man the world was changing
[58:53] the iniquity was taking on the in form
[58:57] in government
[58:59] in laws
[59:03] transgressions
[59:05] became lawful
[59:07] uh
[59:08] serving
[59:09] uh
[59:10] many gods became
[59:13] norm
[59:14] and that civilization was going on
[59:17] getting farther
[59:20] and farther away from god
[59:22] but noah had heard
[59:25] that
[59:27] that god was going to destroy it
[59:30] now
[59:31] he
[59:32] so he was chosen to hear that
[59:38] and he received it in his heart
[59:40] in fact he was created
[59:43] to receive that message
[59:47] he received it in his heart he was
[59:50] created to hear it
[59:52] he was created to receive it and he
[59:55] received it in his heart he didn't need
[59:58] science
[1:00:01] he didn't need to send the weather
[1:00:03] balloon up
[1:00:05] he didn't need science he didn't need he
[1:00:08] he didn't uh
[1:00:10] he didn't need anything to receive that
[1:00:14] message
[1:00:15] that message didn't come to him
[1:00:17] from an outside source
[1:00:20] it came to him directly and it came into
[1:00:23] his heart because he was created to
[1:00:27] receive it
[1:00:28] now you think why did he receive it
[1:00:33] and nobody else did
[1:00:35] because he was chosen
[1:00:37] because god looks upon the
[1:00:41] not the outer continents but he looked
[1:00:43] upon the heart
[1:00:45] he had found favor with god and god had
[1:00:48] extended him to the message and and he
[1:00:51] was created to receive that
[1:00:54] prophecy now i want to hold that part
[1:00:59] he wasn't created to have his eyes
[1:01:01] opened
[1:01:03] to something that
[1:01:06] was in existence
[1:01:09] his eyes weren't open to something that
[1:01:12] was present in hid
[1:01:15] his eyes were opened to prophecy
[1:01:21] not what was
[1:01:24] not
[1:01:25] what is
[1:01:27] but what is going to be
[1:01:29] he received a message of prophecy in his
[1:01:33] heart
[1:01:34] he didn't need
[1:01:37] to rely on visual evidence
[1:01:41] he didn't have to have
[1:01:43] clouds
[1:01:46] he didn't have to have wind
[1:01:49] he didn't have to have lightning
[1:01:52] he didn't have to have any proof
[1:01:57] he received it
[1:02:00] and he he lived
[1:02:03] and he
[1:02:05] worked
[1:02:07] towards the fulfillment
[1:02:10] of that prophecy
[1:02:12] and you know the revelation
[1:02:16] that was in him
[1:02:18] was greater
[1:02:21] than the doubt of the world
[1:02:23] and it was greater in the flood
[1:02:28] amen the word
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:31] word that was in him
[1:02:33] the prophecy that it
[1:02:35] was in him and given to him he was the
[1:02:39] fulfillment of that prophecy
[1:02:45] he was actually that prophecy
[1:02:48] that word manifested
[1:02:52] he was that word he became that word
[1:02:57] what was prophesied to him he he he
[1:03:01] lived that prophecy
[1:03:04] he lived because he knew there was going
[1:03:06] to be a flood
[1:03:07] he preached to him
[1:03:10] repent
[1:03:12] god's going to destroy
[1:03:15] get ready enter into the ark
[1:03:18] and they laughed at them and they mocked
[1:03:21] them and they scoffed them
[1:03:26] they thought everything's just going to
[1:03:27] go on the same
[1:03:29] but he was a recipient
[1:03:33] of the prophecy
[1:03:35] and because he lived the prophecy
[1:03:39] he became the prophecy
[1:03:42] and he became the fulfillment
[1:03:44] of the prophecy he was the fulfillment
[1:03:47] of the prophetic word
[1:03:49] the word became flesh
[1:03:53] in him
[1:03:54] you look at
[1:03:57] moses
[1:03:59] i love these bible stories
[1:04:02] because we
[1:04:06] have been such a christian nation for so
[1:04:09] long
[1:04:10] but we're no longer a christian nation
[1:04:14] only in
[1:04:17] word only
[1:04:21] but moses was chosen
[1:04:25] and like if we go to
[1:04:27] exodus the
[1:04:37] the
[1:04:38] 12th
[1:04:40] uh exodus the uh
[1:04:42] third chapter
[1:04:44] and the 12th verse and
[1:04:47] and and i hope that
[1:04:49] i can start moving toward what's on my
[1:04:51] heart
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:54] exodus the third chapter
[1:04:57] we know that moses was
[1:05:00] chosen of god
[1:05:02] we don't have to go through the story we
[1:05:06] know he was a proper child
[1:05:08] we know that he was preserved and
[1:05:11] elected and
[1:05:14] chosen
[1:05:15] but then we come here and we find that
[1:05:21] that moses was
[1:05:24] driven out of egypt and he's on the back
[1:05:27] side of the desert
[1:05:29] and he turns aside
[1:05:31] because he sees a burning bush
[1:05:34] and when he gets to that burning bush
[1:05:38] we
[1:05:39] see that god speaks to moses
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:43] moses knew
[1:05:46] that his life was
[1:05:48] chosen there was something in his heart
[1:05:52] that he wanted to do it
[1:05:54] he tried to slay an egyptian he tried to
[1:05:57] bring things about his own way he tried
[1:06:01] to use his military might in his
[1:06:03] political strength
[1:06:05] and all those things that went
[1:06:08] past and went on before
[1:06:10] but now moses comes to this burning bush
[1:06:16] and the bush tells him he says
[1:06:18] i have
[1:06:20] elected you and chose you
[1:06:24] to deliver
[1:06:26] my children
[1:06:28] now i want you to notice this prophecy
[1:06:33] and he said
[1:06:35] certainly i will be with thee and that
[1:06:38] was moses's question
[1:06:44] they're not going to receive me who am i
[1:06:47] you know
[1:06:48] all his weaknesses
[1:06:50] and you know your weaknesses isn't uh an
[1:06:54] excuse before god
[1:06:58] no neither is your stature
[1:07:01] or your continents
[1:07:04] but god looks on the heart
[1:07:07] and so he looks at
[1:07:09] moses and moses says who am i i can't do
[1:07:13] it it can lord says moses i'll be with
[1:07:16] you
[1:07:16] in other words my strength is made
[1:07:19] perfect in your weakness
[1:07:21] i'm with you
[1:07:23] i'll be with you
[1:07:25] now he giving moses
[1:07:27] a prophecy
[1:07:31] and moses was wondering
[1:07:34] if he can
[1:07:36] fulfill this prophecy
[1:07:41] and like many times you wonder if you
[1:07:43] can be the bride
[1:07:46] but you were chosen to be the bride
[1:07:49] and and he'll be with you
[1:07:54] that's so he he says here he says
[1:07:58] any in the 11th verse moses says
[1:08:01] unto god who am i that i should go unto
[1:08:04] pharaoh
[1:08:05] and that i should bring forth the
[1:08:07] children of israel out of egypt
[1:08:13] and he said certainly
[1:08:16] i will be with thee
[1:08:20] and this shall be a token unto thee
[1:08:25] that i have sent thee
[1:08:28] when thou hath brought forth the people
[1:08:32] out of egypt ye shall serve god upon
[1:08:38] this mountain
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:41] that
[1:08:42] word was living in him
[1:08:46] and he was the only one that could
[1:08:49] fulfill that word
[1:08:53] now think of that word
[1:08:55] he goes into pharaoh
[1:08:58] and he's got one prophecy
[1:09:03] and that prophecy is the token to him
[1:09:09] you think it was the stick
[1:09:11] you think it was putting the
[1:09:14] his hand in the thing all those things
[1:09:16] were signs
[1:09:19] the speaking of the
[1:09:21] of the flies and the fleas and the
[1:09:24] turning of the water and the hail
[1:09:27] and all those things
[1:09:29] all those things is what god had to do
[1:09:32] to bring the token to pass
[1:09:36] because the prophecy was you will take
[1:09:39] these children and serve me on this
[1:09:42] mountain
[1:09:45] that was what he gave moses as a token
[1:09:50] that was what was
[1:09:52] that's what the prophecy was
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:57] moses
[1:09:59] had in his heart
[1:10:01] that was the word that he received
[1:10:06] you will bring the children out of egypt
[1:10:09] and worship at this mountain
[1:10:12] amen he was the only one that could
[1:10:16] fulfill that prophecy
[1:10:20] he was chosen
[1:10:23] to fulfill it
[1:10:25] he was elected to fulfill it
[1:10:29] he was the only one that could fulfill
[1:10:32] it
[1:10:34] so it didn't matter what stood between
[1:10:36] him
[1:10:38] and the mountain
[1:10:41] because the prophecy in him
[1:10:44] the word in him
[1:10:46] he
[1:10:47] was that prophecy made flesh
[1:10:54] i've got to go
[1:10:56] and i've got to bring the children of
[1:10:58] israel
[1:10:59] because it's thus saith the lord the
[1:11:02] children of israel will serve him in
[1:11:05] this mountain
[1:11:08] all the things he did
[1:11:11] the things he had to do
[1:11:14] he spoke it because he had a prophecy
[1:11:19] living in him
[1:11:21] that had to be fulfilled
[1:11:24] he had received
[1:11:26] the word of the lord
[1:11:28] concerning him
[1:11:31] and the children of israel
[1:11:34] he had become
[1:11:36] that word
[1:11:37] that word was made flesh in him
[1:11:42] he went up the pharaoh let my people go
[1:11:45] okay go over here and work him
[1:11:49] he didn't say worship
[1:11:53] in the desert
[1:11:56] bring my people back to this mountain
[1:12:00] for they shall serve me here that was
[1:12:03] the token
[1:12:05] that rang in moses's heart
[1:12:08] that was the prophecy
[1:12:11] that drove him
[1:12:14] he had received a promise
[1:12:16] that the children would worship at that
[1:12:18] mountain and so it didn't matter
[1:12:22] what happened
[1:12:25] it didn't matter what happened around
[1:12:27] them it didn't happen that pharaoh
[1:12:29] withstood them
[1:12:32] it didn't happen that the laws of the
[1:12:34] land were against them
[1:12:36] none of that mattered
[1:12:39] he had a token
[1:12:42] a covenant
[1:12:44] a token
[1:12:46] another that the price was paid
[1:12:49] this is your token moses this is the
[1:12:53] token to you that the price is paid to
[1:12:57] deliver the children of israel out of
[1:13:00] egypt and bring them to this mountain in
[1:13:02] worship
[1:13:05] my word's a token
[1:13:09] and moses put that on display let my
[1:13:11] people go
[1:13:15] and there he was
[1:13:16] so it didn't matter what was happening
[1:13:18] around him
[1:13:20] it didn't matter
[1:13:21] that pharaoh resisted
[1:13:23] it didn't matter the brick count went up
[1:13:27] it didn't matter the people
[1:13:30] were turning against him
[1:13:34] he had something in his heart
[1:13:37] he had a prophecy
[1:13:39] that he was living
[1:13:41] he had a word that he became part of him
[1:13:44] in that prophecy became one him in that
[1:13:47] token became one so it didn't matter
[1:13:50] what happened around him
[1:13:53] he knew there was a mountain
[1:13:56] and he knew he had to worship god and
[1:13:58] serve god on that mountain with the
[1:14:01] children of israel
[1:14:03] oh would you be so
[1:14:05] thrilled
[1:14:06] if you knew that something lied before
[1:14:09] you
[1:14:13] and that's what you were living for
[1:14:15] because there was an event
[1:14:17] that set before you that had been
[1:14:19] promised to you that was a token to you
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:28] i go away to prepare a place for you
[1:14:31] if it were not so i would not told you
[1:14:34] so but i will come again and receive you
[1:14:38] that where i am you may be also that is
[1:14:42] a token to you
[1:14:47] moses didn't care what was in front of
[1:14:49] him
[1:14:54] the red sea
[1:14:56] he didn't care what was behind him
[1:14:59] pharaoh's army
[1:15:05] he only
[1:15:06] knew
[1:15:08] what was in him
[1:15:11] and the prophecy
[1:15:13] that was in him
[1:15:15] the word that was in him he that was in
[1:15:19] him
[1:15:21] was greater
[1:15:23] than all the armies of israel
[1:15:27] he that gave the prophecy
[1:15:30] was able to fulfill
[1:15:33] the prophecy in moses
[1:15:37] moses stretched out his hands
[1:15:40] the sea opens
[1:15:42] the children go up hard
[1:15:44] he closes his hands
[1:15:46] and
[1:15:49] i love that verse in the scripture i
[1:15:50] wish i'd
[1:15:52] looked it up and wrote it down
[1:15:55] but he said the armies of egypt which
[1:15:58] you fear shall be no more
[1:16:01] that prophecy
[1:16:04] was fulfilled in moses
[1:16:07] the prophecy the token that was in moses
[1:16:11] was greater than anything
[1:16:15] that
[1:16:16] was in the world
[1:16:17] you understand moses received the
[1:16:20] message
[1:16:23] he received the message from god
[1:16:26] noah received a message
[1:16:30] he received a message from god
[1:16:33] and the message that he received is what
[1:16:36] overcame the world
[1:16:40] the word in him
[1:16:42] was greater the prophecy in him was
[1:16:45] greater than the world that was against
[1:16:47] him
[1:16:48] and the same with moses
[1:16:51] what such a beautiful
[1:16:53] thing i think of david
[1:16:56] if we turn in first samuel the
[1:17:08] the
[1:17:11] 16th chapter
[1:17:14] and the
[1:17:18] 13th verse
[1:17:20] we had just taken our text from above
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:25] samuel 16 13.
[1:17:29] it says then samuel took the horn of oil
[1:17:33] and anointed him
[1:17:35] in the midst of his brethren and the
[1:17:37] spirit of the lord come upon david
[1:17:41] from that day forward so samuel rose up
[1:17:46] and went to vermont
[1:17:48] and you know it when you re
[1:17:52] you remember the the story
[1:17:55] and he says in the first verse the 16th
[1:17:58] chapter and the lord said unto samuel
[1:18:01] how long will thou mourn for saul
[1:18:05] seeing i have rejected him from reign
[1:18:08] over israel
[1:18:09] fulfill thy horn with oil
[1:18:12] and go i will send thee to jesse thy
[1:18:15] brethren for i have provided me a king
[1:18:20] amongst his sons
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] what what a a wonderful
[1:18:28] uh
[1:18:30] revelation
[1:18:32] of david's election
[1:18:37] he wasn't going to be kingly
[1:18:40] he was going to be ready
[1:18:43] and fair
[1:18:44] yeah and but god did it rejected the
[1:18:48] outward continents and he accepted the
[1:18:51] inward continents and so we find david
[1:18:54] now david was anointed to be king
[1:18:58] so there was a prophecy
[1:19:02] concerning his election
[1:19:06] because he was chosen
[1:19:10] i have chosen me a king
[1:19:14] out of the sons of jesse
[1:19:17] my choosing
[1:19:19] my election
[1:19:22] and
[1:19:23] david
[1:19:25] was out there
[1:19:26] tending sheep
[1:19:28] and he passed all the sons by and samuel
[1:19:31] sitting there going wait is this all
[1:19:33] your children
[1:19:35] i have a prophecy
[1:19:39] i have a word of the lord that i have
[1:19:41] chosen a son surely there's got to be
[1:19:44] one more
[1:19:46] and they all look at him and say well
[1:19:49] sorry but it can't be that guy out there
[1:19:53] there's no way
[1:19:55] it could be him
[1:19:58] do you ever feel that way about yourself
[1:20:01] that's how moses felt no way it could be
[1:20:04] me
[1:20:06] that's how the brethren felt about david
[1:20:08] no no way it could be him
[1:20:11] but it's his choosing
[1:20:14] he chooses the vessel
[1:20:17] some to honor some to dishonor he
[1:20:19] creates and chooses whom he's going to
[1:20:24] give the message to and depart the
[1:20:28] prophecy
[1:20:31] that was a prophecy
[1:20:35] david will be king
[1:20:37] david goes there
[1:20:39] he's anointed king
[1:20:42] from that time on david was king of
[1:20:46] israel
[1:20:48] whether anybody
[1:20:50] liked it or not
[1:20:53] he was the king of israel now can you
[1:20:56] imagine
[1:20:58] david when he comes up to goliath
[1:21:07] and
[1:21:09] david wasn't afraid
[1:21:12] goliath
[1:21:14] because he heard a message
[1:21:18] goliath was like g19
[1:21:22] in flesh
[1:21:24] not c19 g
[1:21:30] he was there and what was he doing he
[1:21:32] was defiling
[1:21:34] the armies of the living god who's whose
[1:21:38] army was that
[1:21:40] it was his army
[1:21:43] he was the king
[1:21:45] he was god's king
[1:21:47] over
[1:21:49] israel
[1:21:52] exo david comes up before goliath
[1:21:56] and he had heard the message
[1:22:00] he was to be king
[1:22:03] the prophet was in him he was that
[1:22:05] prophecy made flesh
[1:22:08] oh i hope that i can just
[1:22:10] let this sink in that prophecy has got
[1:22:14] to come to pass
[1:22:16] prophecy has to be made flesh
[1:22:20] every prophecy in the old testament
[1:22:23] concerning the messiah was made flesh
[1:22:26] and dwelt among us
[1:22:30] so he goes up to
[1:22:33] goliath you think he's afraid of goliath
[1:22:39] why shakes his big spear
[1:22:41] i'm going to put you on this tree and
[1:22:43] the birds are going to eat your eyes out
[1:22:46] david's sitting there wait a minute i
[1:22:47] got a token
[1:22:51] a prophet came
[1:22:53] and he gave me a message
[1:22:56] and he anointed me with oil
[1:22:59] and i'm to be king he had a token in him
[1:23:03] he had a prophecy in him in fact he was
[1:23:06] that prophecy made flesh
[1:23:09] that word had become flesh
[1:23:13] he was the flesh of the prophecy i will
[1:23:16] pick a king
[1:23:19] i have chosen a king
[1:23:21] that he was that word made flesh
[1:23:26] it wasn't an open-ended office
[1:23:33] wasn't something anybody else could
[1:23:35] arise to
[1:23:37] he was the only one that could fulfill
[1:23:42] that word
[1:23:46] too many times we approach the
[1:23:47] scriptures
[1:23:50] like
[1:23:51] whoever
[1:23:52] decides
[1:23:55] that the fulfillment
[1:23:57] is based on our decision
[1:24:00] the fulfillment is based on election
[1:24:06] and so here he is you think he's afraid
[1:24:08] of that giant
[1:24:10] no
[1:24:12] he was the word of
[1:24:14] prophecy the word of prophecy was in
[1:24:18] david
[1:24:20] and
[1:24:21] the word of prophecy that was in him
[1:24:26] what was spoken of him
[1:24:30] if i could just
[1:24:32] express this to you the strength wasn't
[1:24:35] in ruddy david
[1:24:39] his strength wasn't in the slingshot
[1:24:47] this strength wasn't in how
[1:24:49] nimble he was or how quick he was
[1:24:53] his strength was in
[1:24:56] the word of prophecy that was in him the
[1:25:00] word of prophecy that was in him was
[1:25:03] what was greater
[1:25:05] than
[1:25:06] goliath
[1:25:08] it was a token to david
[1:25:13] he had this prophecy
[1:25:16] and he was that elected chosen one that
[1:25:19] god said that he would make a king made
[1:25:22] flesh that's what gave him the victory
[1:25:25] it was the word of prophecy in him that
[1:25:29] was greater than the giant hallelujah
[1:25:36] you can't look at the outside continents
[1:25:39] you can't look at the outside man
[1:25:43] you got to look if you got the token
[1:25:47] if you've got the promise
[1:25:49] david heard the message
[1:25:54] you're to be king
[1:25:58] just think of that
[1:26:04] they oh you're up here because you're a
[1:26:06] naughty boy no sorry brothers i'm up
[1:26:10] here because i'm king of this army
[1:26:14] what did david do
[1:26:18] when he met goliath
[1:26:20] you know what david did he acted like a
[1:26:22] king
[1:26:25] that's how he acted he acted like the
[1:26:28] king of israel
[1:26:29] the prophecy that was given in him
[1:26:32] manifested through the flesh and the
[1:26:35] king went out to protect his country
[1:26:38] hallelujah
[1:26:42] that was his token
[1:26:45] that was his defense
[1:26:48] what god spoke of him
[1:26:52] was his victory
[1:26:54] not the circumstance
[1:26:58] how would you like to be army of that
[1:27:00] bunch
[1:27:02] king of that bunch
[1:27:04] acting like cowards
[1:27:07] but he was king
[1:27:09] he was made king
[1:27:11] he was prophesied king and here shows up
[1:27:14] prophesied word
[1:27:16] are you guys afraid of him
[1:27:19] who is this
[1:27:21] uncircumcised philistine
[1:27:23] that defies the army of the living god
[1:27:27] what was that speaking
[1:27:29] it was the prophecy speaking
[1:27:33] it was the token speaking it was what he
[1:27:37] was speaking
[1:27:40] the prophecy
[1:27:42] made him king
[1:27:45] and when he meant the challenge he meant
[1:27:47] the challenge not as a shepherd boy
[1:27:51] but as king
[1:27:52] of israel
[1:27:55] oh
[1:27:58] sons and daughters of god
[1:28:01] have you received the message
[1:28:04] have you received a prophecy
[1:28:06] have you received the promise
[1:28:10] i like daniel
[1:28:13] let's turn to daniel
[1:28:21] the third chapter of daniel
[1:28:26] in the 13th verse
[1:28:32] daniel is absolutely a wonderful read
[1:28:36] now don't try to figure it all out
[1:28:39] because those dreams and visions are
[1:28:41] something
[1:28:43] but
[1:28:44] i love this
[1:28:46] i just love to look at this and and see
[1:28:49] it and
[1:28:50] and
[1:28:51] just read it
[1:28:59] and so we know the story leading up to
[1:29:02] this
[1:29:04] that
[1:29:05] nebuchadnezzar made an image a
[1:29:08] statue and he ordered that when the
[1:29:11] sound certain sounds were made that
[1:29:13] everybody was to bow down and we picked
[1:29:16] up the story
[1:29:18] in the third chapter of the book of
[1:29:20] daniel
[1:29:22] and the 13th verse
[1:29:25] then nebuchadnezzar
[1:29:28] in his rage and fury
[1:29:31] commanded to bring shadrach meshach
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:36] abednego
[1:29:38] you know a lot of parents use that to
[1:29:40] get their kids they say shadrach meshach
[1:29:42] and to bed we go
[1:29:45] it works
[1:29:47] then they brought these men before the
[1:29:49] king
[1:29:50] and nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto
[1:29:53] them is it true
[1:29:55] o shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:30:00] do not ye serve my gods
[1:30:03] no worship the golden image which i have
[1:30:07] set up
[1:30:09] now if ye be ready
[1:30:12] that at what time ye hear the sound of
[1:30:16] the cornet
[1:30:18] the flute harp
[1:30:20] shack butt palestry
[1:30:23] and dolce mir
[1:30:25] and all kinds of music ye fall
[1:30:29] down and worship the image which i have
[1:30:32] made well but if ye worship not ye shall
[1:30:37] be cast
[1:30:39] the same hour into the midst of the
[1:30:41] burning furnace
[1:30:43] and who is that god
[1:30:46] that shall deliver you out of my hands
[1:30:54] which god would you want to have been
[1:30:56] servant
[1:30:57] huh
[1:30:59] and shout at me second of nabednego
[1:31:01] answered and said to the king
[1:31:04] o nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:06] we are not careful to answer thee in
[1:31:09] this matter
[1:31:11] if it be so
[1:31:13] our god
[1:31:14] whom we serve is able to deliver us
[1:31:18] from the burning fur furnace fiery
[1:31:22] furnace
[1:31:23] but
[1:31:24] and he will deliver us out of thy hand o
[1:31:28] king
[1:31:29] but if not
[1:31:31] be it known unto thee o king
[1:31:34] that we
[1:31:35] will not serve the gods nor worship the
[1:31:40] golden image without have set up
[1:31:44] hallelujah now i want you to notice
[1:31:46] something
[1:31:50] they may not have had
[1:31:51] a prophecy
[1:31:53] but they did have a prophecy
[1:31:56] the prophecy was the commandments of god
[1:32:02] thou shalt not worship
[1:32:05] any god i am the lord thy god thou shalt
[1:32:09] not worship any god
[1:32:13] that was their commandment
[1:32:15] when they went into captivity daniel and
[1:32:18] shadrach meshach and abednego they
[1:32:21] purposed in their heart not to defile
[1:32:24] themselves
[1:32:29] and remember the story the
[1:32:31] the
[1:32:32] master of the guard who was
[1:32:34] the chief eunuch who was in charge of
[1:32:36] their well-being
[1:32:38] he came to him and he said you guys
[1:32:40] aren't eating the king's meat
[1:32:43] i'm afraid you'll start looking sickly
[1:32:47] and pale
[1:32:50] and if you guys don't look good i'm
[1:32:52] going to be killed
[1:32:54] they said we won't need it
[1:32:57] i want you to see their resolve
[1:33:00] i want you to see their dedication to
[1:33:03] the word
[1:33:04] the word at their time was the law
[1:33:07] the ten commandments
[1:33:09] that dwelt in them
[1:33:12] the words of the prophecy of mount sinai
[1:33:16] dwelt in them the law of moses dwelt in
[1:33:19] them
[1:33:21] they lived by it
[1:33:23] it was their life and they said no just
[1:33:25] give us i think this pasta see some sign
[1:33:28] of porridge or
[1:33:30] meal i don't know exactly what it was
[1:33:33] he said we'll eat that for 10 days
[1:33:37] and after 10 days they looked better
[1:33:39] than the rest of them
[1:33:42] they were flush and they were
[1:33:44] fat and they had great hunk
[1:33:47] continents about them
[1:33:50] so the guy he said he's off the hook
[1:33:53] he just
[1:33:54] gave them the food
[1:33:56] and they hate the way they ate
[1:33:58] and so now they're not afraid to answer
[1:34:03] why they had the commandments of god in
[1:34:06] their heart
[1:34:10] o king
[1:34:12] live forever
[1:34:15] but i'm not going to break
[1:34:17] that which is in my heart
[1:34:21] i'm not going to compromise
[1:34:24] even if my life depends on it
[1:34:28] this is what i believe
[1:34:30] this is what i live by
[1:34:32] this is what i die by
[1:34:35] this is my moral fiber this is my
[1:34:39] structure this is who i am i am not
[1:34:42] going to compromise on the word and may
[1:34:45] i say say this that obedience to the
[1:34:48] word that was in them
[1:34:51] the prophecy that was in them the word
[1:34:54] that was in them the obedience that was
[1:34:57] in them was greater
[1:35:01] than the fiery furnace
[1:35:05] no matter how dark it looked
[1:35:09] the message that they received
[1:35:13] that god had commanded them
[1:35:16] not to bow down to another god
[1:35:21] they had no circumstance
[1:35:25] where it was right for them
[1:35:28] no provision was made
[1:35:34] for them
[1:35:36] they stuck with the word
[1:35:38] why did they stick with it because the
[1:35:40] word was in them and the obedience
[1:35:43] that they had
[1:35:45] to the commandments
[1:35:47] was greater than the fiery furnace
[1:35:50] and then look over at the 24th verse
[1:35:55] of the same chapter the third chapter
[1:35:58] and then nebuchadnezzar
[1:36:00] the king
[1:36:02] was astonished
[1:36:04] and rose up in haste
[1:36:06] and spake
[1:36:08] and said unto his counselors
[1:36:10] did not we cast three
[1:36:12] bound
[1:36:14] into the midst of the fire
[1:36:17] didn't we cast three guys in there
[1:36:20] fully clothed everything didn't we throw
[1:36:23] him in there
[1:36:30] and they answered and said unto the king
[1:36:32] true o king
[1:36:35] and he answered and said lo i see
[1:36:39] four men
[1:36:41] loose
[1:36:44] oh my
[1:36:46] wouldn't you like to been a part of that
[1:36:48] revival
[1:36:49] shadrach meshach walking around with the
[1:36:51] fourth man
[1:36:53] let me tell you you have that fourth man
[1:36:56] because that fourth man goes with the
[1:36:59] prophecy
[1:37:01] he is the prophecy and when you and the
[1:37:04] prophecy become one he's always there
[1:37:10] he is the word
[1:37:12] they were the word
[1:37:14] they were the
[1:37:16] manifestation of the fulfillment of the
[1:37:19] word of the lord for that day
[1:37:22] in flesh
[1:37:24] they were the commandments on in flesh
[1:37:28] they came off the tablet of stone
[1:37:31] and became manifested in flesh
[1:37:35] and that word in them was greater
[1:37:40] than the fiery furnace
[1:37:45] he says lo i see a fourth man walking in
[1:37:48] the midst of the fire
[1:37:51] and they have
[1:37:52] no hurt
[1:37:54] and the form of the fourth man
[1:37:56] is like
[1:37:58] the son of god
[1:38:00] hallelujah
[1:38:02] do you understand just the obedience
[1:38:07] to the prophecy
[1:38:09] and becoming one with the word
[1:38:12] was
[1:38:13] able to overcome
[1:38:15] he who is in you
[1:38:17] is greater than he who was in the world
[1:38:23] you say well if god didn't come speak to
[1:38:25] them the word spoke to him the
[1:38:28] commandment spoke to them they had that
[1:38:31] in their heart they wrote it upon the
[1:38:33] tablets of their heart they meditated
[1:38:36] upon it day and night they were obedient
[1:38:38] to that word they were that word
[1:38:41] he couldn't destroy them
[1:38:44] without destroying the word
[1:38:48] that's your relationship
[1:38:51] that's where you're saying let's look at
[1:38:52] daniel
[1:39:02] let's go to the sixth chapter
[1:39:09] i want you to see how that receiving the
[1:39:13] message
[1:39:14] and receiving the word
[1:39:16] and receiving the instruction
[1:39:20] and receiving the commandments
[1:39:23] is receiving the prophecy
[1:39:28] so you know the story
[1:39:31] i believe the king's name is
[1:39:33] is
[1:39:36] darius at this
[1:39:38] time and
[1:39:39] um
[1:39:41] and so
[1:39:43] his
[1:39:44] men they kind of um
[1:39:47] his uh
[1:39:49] uh
[1:39:51] what do you say is counselors
[1:39:54] they say oh king we want to make a great
[1:39:56] day and a great honor and lift you up as
[1:40:00] the great king and
[1:40:02] and
[1:40:02] the motives and objectives of their
[1:40:04] heart are totally wrong but they said
[1:40:07] let it be that for
[1:40:09] 24 hours or whatever that no man makes
[1:40:12] no petition
[1:40:14] of no god or no person or anybody but
[1:40:19] the alone
[1:40:22] you're going to have soul
[1:40:24] sovereign
[1:40:26] authority
[1:40:28] well let me tell you something god
[1:40:29] doesn't give up his authority
[1:40:32] you may think satan's in control but
[1:40:35] he's not
[1:40:37] god doesn't give up his authority
[1:40:41] the footsteps of the righteous are
[1:40:43] ordered by the lord
[1:40:47] nobody's supposed to pray
[1:40:49] nobody daniel hears it what do you think
[1:40:51] he does
[1:40:53] he goes opens the
[1:40:54] window
[1:40:57] he kneels down and he turns his eyes
[1:41:01] towards
[1:41:03] jerusalem
[1:41:04] because the word of god said if the
[1:41:07] children of israel turned their hearts
[1:41:09] and their eyes to jerusalem that god
[1:41:11] would hear their prayer
[1:41:16] do you think daniel's given that up
[1:41:18] he's got a prophecy
[1:41:22] he's got a word he received a message
[1:41:26] now he becomes that message
[1:41:29] manifested in flesh
[1:41:32] now that prophecy is going to be
[1:41:35] fulfilled because he's in the time of
[1:41:37] trouble he's got to kneel down and he's
[1:41:40] got to pray and he throws us off
[1:41:44] the windows open and he
[1:41:46] looks to jerusalem and he looketh unto
[1:41:49] the lord from whence cometh his help
[1:41:55] they come to the king and say
[1:41:59] daniel prayed
[1:42:01] do you know the king spoke on his behalf
[1:42:05] he tried to argue with them
[1:42:09] do you have mercy
[1:42:11] he
[1:42:12] hated what he'd done
[1:42:16] and they held the king they said oak
[1:42:19] darius you know the laws
[1:42:23] you wrote the laws
[1:42:25] you know you can't take it back
[1:42:28] and they held his feet to the fire
[1:42:31] and then you you reap here
[1:42:33] in the 16th verse
[1:42:37] of the sixth chapter
[1:42:40] then the king commanded
[1:42:44] they
[1:42:45] brought daniel
[1:42:46] and cast him into
[1:42:49] the den of lions
[1:42:52] now the king spake and said unto daniel
[1:42:55] thy god whom thou serve continually
[1:42:59] he will
[1:43:00] deliver thee
[1:43:05] the life
[1:43:06] that was in daniel
[1:43:10] the keeping of the word that was in
[1:43:12] daniel was greater
[1:43:16] than the king's decree
[1:43:19] in fact even the king recognized it oh
[1:43:21] daniel surely your god
[1:43:25] will spare you
[1:43:27] and then you you read it the king fasted
[1:43:30] all night he was
[1:43:33] distraught he couldn't sleep
[1:43:35] and
[1:43:36] first thing
[1:43:37] he spent the whole night the 18th first
[1:43:40] then the king went to his palace
[1:43:42] and passed the night fasting
[1:43:45] neither were any instruments and music
[1:43:48] brought before him
[1:43:50] and his sleep went from him
[1:43:53] then the king arose very early in the
[1:43:56] morning and went in hastened unto the
[1:43:59] den of lions
[1:44:01] and when he came to the den he cried
[1:44:04] with a lamentable voice unto daniel and
[1:44:08] the king spake and said to daniel oh
[1:44:11] daniel
[1:44:12] servant of the living god
[1:44:15] is thy god whom thou service continual
[1:44:19] able to deliverly from the lions
[1:44:23] then said daniel unto the king o king
[1:44:28] live forever
[1:44:30] oh wouldn't you like to be so secure in
[1:44:32] your heart that that was your feeling
[1:44:35] through this world all around us
[1:44:38] my god has sent his angel
[1:44:42] and he has shut the lion's mouth
[1:44:45] that they have not hurt me
[1:44:47] for much as before
[1:44:51] him innocently
[1:44:54] was found in me innocence was found in
[1:44:57] me
[1:44:58] and also before thee o king i have done
[1:45:02] no hurt
[1:45:06] isn't that
[1:45:09] thrill you
[1:45:12] that
[1:45:13] that word
[1:45:15] and that righteousness
[1:45:18] and that lack of fear
[1:45:21] and calling upon the name of the lord
[1:45:24] just obedience and believing and
[1:45:27] following the message of his hour
[1:45:30] how it was greater than the lion's den
[1:45:35] he went into the den
[1:45:37] they went into the fire
[1:45:41] noah went into the flood
[1:45:45] but we have a promise that the lord
[1:45:47] delivereth us out of all our afflictions
[1:45:51] it it's to understand that he heard the
[1:45:55] message
[1:45:56] he received the word of god he received
[1:45:59] that there's no other god to serve
[1:46:01] there's no other truth there's not three
[1:46:03] gods there's no other baptism there's no
[1:46:06] other evidence of the token but
[1:46:08] obedience to the word of god
[1:46:11] he what they weren't taken apart from
[1:46:13] every anointing and led this way and led
[1:46:16] that they they were steadfast in their
[1:46:18] heart not to defile themselves with the
[1:46:21] gods of
[1:46:24] babylon
[1:46:26] that was a power in a strength that was
[1:46:29] in them that was greater than anything
[1:46:32] in the world just your consecration to
[1:46:35] the word of god is greater than the
[1:46:38] world he that is in you is greater than
[1:46:41] he
[1:46:42] that is in the world
[1:46:45] and in closing this morning
[1:46:50] didn't you receive a message
[1:46:53] didn't i receive a message
[1:47:00] every single one of these
[1:47:04] messages
[1:47:06] prophecies
[1:47:08] were given to people
[1:47:12] and then manifested in their flesh
[1:47:17] and the prophecy was fulfilled
[1:47:20] through them
[1:47:22] they were elected to receive the message
[1:47:25] they were elected
[1:47:27] to become the message
[1:47:29] and they were elected to overcome by the
[1:47:32] prophecy that they manifested
[1:47:35] in flesh
[1:47:37] that's the way god always does it
[1:47:40] may i read this from the message proving
[1:47:43] his word
[1:47:44] now i want you to notice
[1:47:48] this is proving his word paragraph
[1:47:50] 122
[1:47:53] and i i believe it was preached in
[1:47:56] let me tell you the date
[1:47:59] that it was preached in case you
[1:48:02] want to look at it it was 8 16
[1:48:06] 64.
[1:48:08] paragraph 122.
[1:48:14] he says now
[1:48:16] i want you to notice
[1:48:19] he does it that way in every
[1:48:23] age
[1:48:24] he does it every time by the same method
[1:48:29] he has
[1:48:30] to take believers
[1:48:34] and then in order to have believers to
[1:48:38] meet that word
[1:48:42] so he had to have he had to have no
[1:48:47] to be there to receive the message
[1:48:49] and meet that word of destruction
[1:48:52] to provide a way of escape
[1:48:55] he's got
[1:48:58] he's got the to meet that word he's got
[1:49:01] to
[1:49:02] predestinate it
[1:49:04] to that age you see it
[1:49:06] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[1:49:10] be there to meet the challenge of the
[1:49:13] age
[1:49:15] did it get you
[1:49:17] do you feel it
[1:49:19] do you see it
[1:49:21] do you understand it that's what's
[1:49:24] happening today he's
[1:49:26] predestinated it to do this
[1:49:30] by his foreknowledge when he
[1:49:32] predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to
[1:49:36] happen
[1:49:37] when he come over and predestinates
[1:49:40] anything to happen in his word
[1:49:43] he had to prove his word to be so
[1:49:46] and when he predestinated anything to
[1:49:49] happen and says it will happen he knows
[1:49:52] that seed will be there
[1:49:55] just at that time
[1:49:57] he predestinated a bride she's going
[1:50:01] to
[1:50:02] be there
[1:50:06] going to be
[1:50:08] a
[1:50:09] rapture
[1:50:11] she's going to be there he predestinated
[1:50:15] by his foreknowledge there's nothing
[1:50:18] that's going to stop it
[1:50:21] look what's going on
[1:50:27] i'm in i'm astonished it's what's going
[1:50:29] on
[1:50:32] i'm astonished that they're they're
[1:50:35] they're legalizing
[1:50:37] full late term
[1:50:39] abortions
[1:50:43] i'm astonished the opening the prison
[1:50:46] doors
[1:50:48] i'm astonished at all those things
[1:50:52] but isn't didn't we receive a message
[1:50:59] didn't we receive a message that is it
[1:51:01] was in the days of noah
[1:51:04] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:51:06] of man
[1:51:07] didn't receive a message as it was in
[1:51:10] the days of sodom they were married and
[1:51:12] given into marriage and don't even marry
[1:51:15] at
[1:51:18] all wasn't it prophesied
[1:51:22] didn't we receive the prophecy
[1:51:26] didn't we receive the message
[1:51:30] that
[1:51:31] perilous times shall come
[1:51:34] that men shall be
[1:51:36] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:51:38] god
[1:51:40] not wishing to retain god in their
[1:51:42] knowledge
[1:51:43] that he turns them over to a reprobate
[1:51:45] mind
[1:51:47] don't you understand we've received
[1:51:51] the prophecy
[1:51:55] we've received the message
[1:51:59] and what was that message
[1:52:01] i have elected
[1:52:04] and chosen a bride
[1:52:07] she
[1:52:08] will
[1:52:09] be there
[1:52:10] there will be a rapture
[1:52:14] nothing's going to stop it you see it's
[1:52:17] the message prophecy living in us that's
[1:52:21] a deliverance from this world
[1:52:27] the message in us
[1:52:29] is greater in the world around us
[1:52:32] our deliverance
[1:52:35] is the rapture
[1:52:39] that's what we've been set aside for
[1:52:43] that's what we've been called out to
[1:52:45] we cannot stop
[1:52:47] what's happening
[1:52:50] i don't care if it's a republican
[1:52:54] or a democrat
[1:52:58] remember this
[1:53:00] satan appears
[1:53:03] as an angel of light
[1:53:08] a person might line up with every single
[1:53:11] bit
[1:53:14] of my
[1:53:15] political views and
[1:53:18] what i think ought to be done
[1:53:21] and what i don't think
[1:53:24] should be done
[1:53:25] but the word of god said don't look upon
[1:53:27] the continents of it
[1:53:29] god judges the heart
[1:53:38] we only have one set of eyes
[1:53:42] and that's the prophecy
[1:53:47] the prophecy is our democracy will not
[1:53:49] last
[1:53:51] the prophecy is that america is going to
[1:53:53] go into total rune
[1:53:56] the prophecy is this world will be
[1:53:58] destroyed
[1:54:00] that's the prophecy
[1:54:04] but along with that prophecy
[1:54:06] i'll not leave you
[1:54:08] nor forsake you
[1:54:10] you will not see the destruction
[1:54:13] that's going to fall upon the face of
[1:54:16] the earth because i will not let my
[1:54:19] bride go through the tribulation
[1:54:24] we've got a prophecy
[1:54:26] and if we're living by that prophecy
[1:54:30] and that prophecy is made manifested in
[1:54:33] our flesh
[1:54:36] then that very prophecy becomes a
[1:54:38] deliverance from the very thing we
[1:54:40] abhorred
[1:54:45] there's only one event
[1:54:48] left
[1:54:50] and that's the rapture of the church
[1:54:56] you're not going to stop it
[1:54:58] we're not going to stop it
[1:55:02] in fact
[1:55:03] when you think about it there's a whole
[1:55:05] movement
[1:55:06] in the world
[1:55:09] it's called the reset movement
[1:55:15] in other words man started down this
[1:55:17] course
[1:55:19] and of course they're going down science
[1:55:21] things are going to destroy the world
[1:55:26] they think they're going to starve to
[1:55:27] death
[1:55:31] they think they're going to pollute to
[1:55:32] death
[1:55:34] they think disease is going to come
[1:55:38] and they said we've got to stop the
[1:55:40] world
[1:55:41] and the direction that it's going
[1:55:44] and we need to reset our thinking
[1:55:47] we need to change everything
[1:55:51] we need to change the cars we're driving
[1:55:53] we need to change the buildings we're
[1:55:55] living in we need to change what we eat
[1:55:58] we've got to do this we've got to do
[1:56:00] that well i pray tell you you better
[1:56:02] consult the message that god sent forth
[1:56:05] because god's done with america he's
[1:56:08] done with the world and there's only one
[1:56:10] thing that's waiting is a judgment
[1:56:14] and if you hear the message you'll hear
[1:56:17] the ark of escape and the exodus to come
[1:56:21] out from amongst my people and be
[1:56:23] separate
[1:56:26] they're not resetting nothing
[1:56:30] their congress isn't going to change
[1:56:32] anything
[1:56:35] their president's not going to change
[1:56:37] anything
[1:56:39] and they're not going to change anything
[1:56:41] because the footsteps of the righteous
[1:56:44] are ordered by the lord
[1:56:49] and the prophet of god said if god
[1:56:51] doesn't destroy this place he'll have to
[1:56:53] raise sodom and gomorrah from the sea
[1:57:00] it's over
[1:57:04] it's
[1:57:08] over that's what nebuchadnezzar thought
[1:57:12] about shadrach meshach neve
[1:57:15] that's what darius thought
[1:57:18] about daniel
[1:57:21] you look at gideon
[1:57:26] gideon had the
[1:57:29] word of the lord
[1:57:32] kid and said oh who am i just go to
[1:57:35] judges
[1:57:36] the sixth chapter in closing
[1:57:49] see if i can find judges real quick
[1:58:03] the sixth chapter in the
[1:58:07] 14th verse book of judges
[1:58:23] let's start with the 12th verse
[1:58:29] and the angel lord appeared
[1:58:32] unto him
[1:58:33] and said unto him
[1:58:35] the lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[1:58:38] valor
[1:58:40] and gideon said unto him
[1:58:42] o my lord
[1:58:44] if the lord be
[1:58:46] with us
[1:58:47] why then has all this befallen us
[1:58:50] and where be his miracles which our
[1:58:53] father told of saying
[1:58:55] did not the lord bring us up
[1:58:58] out of egypt
[1:59:00] but now the lord hath forsaken us
[1:59:02] and delivered us into the hands of the
[1:59:05] midianites
[1:59:07] and the lord looked upon him and said
[1:59:10] go
[1:59:11] in
[1:59:12] this might
[1:59:14] and thou shalt save israel
[1:59:17] from the hand of the midianites
[1:59:20] have not i
[1:59:22] sent thee
[1:59:26] take that to heart
[1:59:29] we've been sent
[1:59:32] to be the burning light
[1:59:35] of the message
[1:59:36] that there's a rapture
[1:59:38] and a deliverance coming
[1:59:41] and it's in the ark
[1:59:42] of god's word
[1:59:47] and he said unto him
[1:59:49] o my lord
[1:59:50] wherewith shall i save israel behold my
[1:59:53] family is poor
[1:59:56] in manasseh and i am the least in my
[2:00:00] father's house
[2:00:01] and the lord said unto him
[2:00:04] surely i will be with thee
[2:00:07] and thou shalt smite the midianites
[2:00:11] as one man
[2:00:16] surely you're my bride
[2:00:18] surely i'm with you
[2:00:20] surely i go with you
[2:00:24] to him that overcometh
[2:00:28] i will give to set with me
[2:00:30] in my father's throne
[2:00:35] didn't matter how little
[2:00:37] gideon's army was
[2:00:39] he had a prophecy
[2:00:43] he had received a message
[2:00:46] and that message was living in his heart
[2:00:49] and he became that message
[2:00:52] he became that prophecy and he was that
[2:00:55] prophecy manny
[2:00:57] manifested in flesh
[2:01:00] and we have a message
[2:01:03] and that message was to call out a bride
[2:01:07] to restore the faith of the fathers to
[2:01:10] the children
[2:01:11] and the faith of the children back to
[2:01:13] the fathers
[2:01:15] we have a promised word
[2:01:18] in our day
[2:01:19] an elect word a prophecy that's
[2:01:22] manifested in the flesh
[2:01:24] and we know that that prophecy that is
[2:01:27] in us and the word that is in us that
[2:01:30] word will rapture us out of the
[2:01:33] prophesied destruction that's fixing
[2:01:37] to hit this earth
[2:01:39] you think gideon was afraid
[2:01:43] what did he rely on
[2:01:45] he relied on the message
[2:01:48] you shall save israel
[2:01:51] we rely on the message come out from
[2:01:54] amongst them my people and be ye
[2:01:57] separate
[2:01:58] and i will come again
[2:02:01] and receive you
[2:02:02] that where i am you'll be also as it was
[2:02:06] in the days of noah so shall it be in
[2:02:09] the coming of the son of man as it was
[2:02:13] in the days of sodom and gomorrah so
[2:02:16] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[2:02:19] man in the voice of the day of the
[2:02:21] seventh angel the mysteries of god
[2:02:25] should be finished
[2:02:27] behold i stand at the door and knock
[2:02:30] whoever opens up i will come into him
[2:02:34] and sup with him we have a message
[2:02:37] that will be fed will become one with
[2:02:40] the word and we'll be raptured and taken
[2:02:43] home
[2:02:44] aren't you glad that you've heard the
[2:02:47] word
[2:02:48] aren't you glad you've become a part of
[2:02:50] it
[2:02:50] aren't you glad
[2:02:52] that he lives
[2:02:54] and because he lives
[2:02:56] we live also
[2:02:58] don't forget the prophecy
[2:03:00] church
[2:03:01] the prophecy is we're going home
[2:03:04] the prophecy is will be raptured the
[2:03:07] prophecy is if we go to the grave the
[2:03:10] grave won't hold us down
[2:03:12] we'll rise first and we'll meet him
[2:03:15] together in the air ever to be with our
[2:03:19] lord don't be dismayed
[2:03:23] at the iniquity that's forming around us
[2:03:26] we have a message that we're going home
[2:03:29] god bless you let's stand together billy
[2:03:31] if you could come
[2:03:33] and lead us in a song sister sarah thank
[2:03:36] you so much for praying god bless you at
[2:03:39] home
[2:03:40] uh don't be discouraged
[2:03:45] don't worry
[2:03:46] he that is in you
[2:03:48] the prophecy that is made flesh in you
[2:03:52] he said he would have a bride he would
[2:03:54] call her out there you are sitting at
[2:03:57] home listening sitting in the church
[2:03:59] building it's been made flesh
[2:04:02] and what's been made flesh in you is
[2:04:04] greater than the iniquity
[2:04:07] that's around us in the world
[2:04:09] and just like the prophecy delivered
[2:04:12] every other believer it's the same today
[2:04:15] he predestinates the seed to be there
[2:04:18] there will be a bride
[2:04:21] nothing can stop it
[2:04:22] there will be a rapture it will happen
[2:04:25] why because the prophecies been made
[2:04:28] flesh
[2:04:30] and dwells among us and he who is in us
[2:04:34] is greater and he is in the world
[2:04:37] let us pray
[2:04:38] our gracious heavenly father
[2:04:42] we have come to the hour of the
[2:04:44] fulfillment of thy word
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:48] lord when
[2:04:50] america has
[2:04:52] spilled me out
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:57] they no longer
[2:04:59] wish to retain you in their knowledge
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:05] they put on a religious covering
[2:05:09] they act like they may be so moral and
[2:05:11] so right
[2:05:12] [Music]
[2:05:15] but yet we see
[2:05:18] the days of sodom and gomorrah and the
[2:05:21] days of noah so vividly around us
[2:05:25] and we know there's only one way of
[2:05:27] escape
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:31] is that we become
[2:05:34] the prophecy of a bride
[2:05:37] made flesh
[2:05:40] that we become the prophecy of a rapture
[2:05:43] made flesh
[2:05:45] and we live by that word like daniel and
[2:05:48] shadrach meshach and abednego
[2:05:53] we accept the challenge like gideon did
[2:05:58] we live righteous in the wicked world
[2:06:02] like noah did
[2:06:07] and we know there's a prophecy
[2:06:10] that must be fulfilled
[2:06:13] noah knew he had to find that mountain
[2:06:16] and he didn't care if egypt stood in the
[2:06:18] way he didn't care if the red sea stood
[2:06:21] in the way he didn't care how hard
[2:06:25] pharaoh's heart got
[2:06:26] [Music]
[2:06:27] he had thus saith the lord
[2:06:30] he had a prophecy that was to be
[2:06:32] fulfilled in him
[2:06:34] that he was going to go to that mountain
[2:06:37] lord and we have a prophecy that's
[2:06:39] fulfilled in us that we will meet you in
[2:06:41] the air
[2:06:43] lord and nothing can stop that from
[2:06:45] happening we become that word we believe
[2:06:49] that word and we're trusting
[2:06:52] solely
[2:06:53] that that word has been made flesh in us
[2:06:56] we were elected and predestinated to
[2:06:59] hear it
[2:07:00] and father that message
[2:07:02] that prophecy
[2:07:04] that word is in us is greater
[2:07:08] than anything
[2:07:09] that's in the world we believe it in
[2:07:12] jesus name father bless those that are
[2:07:15] at home
[2:07:19] father if they're
[2:07:22] any sickness lord we just ask that they
[2:07:24] lift their hand to you at this time
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] if they have a loved one or someone
[2:07:31] that's on their heart
[2:07:33] oh lord maybe
[2:07:35] they just
[2:07:38] like david looking at goliath
[2:07:43] maybe we know that we're anointed and
[2:07:46] commissioned
[2:07:47] to go into all the world
[2:07:51] to make intercession
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:54] and to
[2:07:55] bring our petitions to your throne
[2:08:01] and lord we fulfill
[2:08:04] the word that was spoken of us
[2:08:07] we manifested in flesh
[2:08:10] at this time by carrying out this
[2:08:13] commission
[2:08:14] and because that word's in us
[2:08:17] it's greater than anything that's in the
[2:08:20] world
[2:08:21] any challenge
[2:08:23] we ask that you grant our prayers in
[2:08:25] jesus name we pray
[2:08:28] amen
[2:08:29] [Music]
