[Music] tonight that's why we've come and open oursel to receive something from you Lord you know how we have nothing but when we consider your [Music] love when we we consider how that you loved us before when we were even unlovable when we didn't have anything we have no aspect about us but you loved us you attracted us and tonight you've invited us once again in your presence may you be in action tonight because no man can be useful to his neighbor if you are not in him if you come and don't intervene that's why oh Jesus as we believe that you are here not because we're thinking of it because you said it in your word and we know that everything that you say is true and you come to you bring it to pass and then come among us tonight Lord as we commit one each one of your children to your hands and those that are following online and our pastor all your servants wherever they are may your grace be upon each one and bless us tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we still standing I'm sorry I'm back in French today we'll open our Bibles uh in the Book of Matthew chapter 11 we'll read verse 27 to the 30th verse Matthew 11 verse 27 to 30 it's Jesus speaking all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither no man any man the father save the son and he whomsoever the son will reveal him [Music] come unto me all ye that are labored and heavy laden and I will give you [Music] rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lonely in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light you may have your seats let's also turn to the book of filon we'll read the the first three uh chapters sorry verses Fon only has one chapter so don't Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ Timothy our brother unto filon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved AIA and Arabs our fellow soldiers and to the church in thy house Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus your word has been read it's for you to preach it as we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I believe we once again happy to be in the house of God tonight and we are waiting upon the grace of the Lord you know preachers are like artist an artist when he's writing a song with something like that it's most most of the time is through something that they have inspiration from something they're going through or something that they are observing around them and as preachers we look for something and we are waiting on the Lord to H to to find something come and as brother said and most of the time we just don't come so we can say something or something so people can Rejoice or to say something so you can show that you know you have knowledge but most times the things that God places upon your heart or things that you yourself are going through and often times I know I don't like to talk about myself because I don't find it important but what the Lord placed on my heart tonight it's something that the Lord is dealing with my own heart experience and I believe it could be uh useful or helpful for someone who's also going through the same experience I was listening to a sermon that preached a prisoner [Music] and I believe it's the one preached uh uh uh July 17 1963 prisoner I even wanted to just play the tape so we can listen to brother [Music] Bram so certainly tonight I'll try to read some uh uh passage in this message uh as we go along you know the Lord will lead you in things that you you yourself you don't know you know it's been about five [Music] years that my family has been here and for the first three years I was not here most of the time was mostly in Africa and I would come every once in a [Music] while because the Lord had given me favor that in the social uh things I I I was able to get to a certain level uh accept a good level if I could say that [Music] like in my country in Congo until now I was the only one with the highest level uh um of Education in my in what I [Music] do so in if you speak about neurology as far as Congo is concerned if there has to be any references it's going to be me the Prof the professor and when I came here it was very difficult to try to make things work they asked they had asked for me uh to send the document so it could be validated and sent back so I can take the test and and and so they can compare they send the document to Congo Congo refused to to respond so which means I couldn't I can't do the test and then some days I prayed and I asked I said Lord why did you bring me here why why and one day as I was praying like that a voice spoke to me and I the voice said to me do you think you lost more than Moses Moses who had the Throne of Egypt who could have been the the the like the king of the Earth but who found him he found he find himself in the desert behind some sheeps that belong to his uh uh uh father-in-law so you didn't lose more than Moses did and the most important thing for you it's not your Ambitions it's the it's the will of God then tonight [Music] I'm going to speak about uh my title is prisoners of uh the love of Christ of Christ love yes a prisoner of of the love of Christ you know as Adam and Eve uh in our lives God God gives us choices he lets us make choices he elected us before the foundation of the world he he loved us but he he lets us make choices before different circumstances we have to choose we have to make a decision and we have to go forward and in those decisions and we have to know which is the best decision which is the best decision and when we come to the house of God is so that the Lord may speak to us that the Lord May guide us may the Lord show us his perfect will and I believe everyone of you will pray for me because all I need right now is so is what God wants me to do and what God wants me to be not what I want to be not what I wanted to be but what he wants and brother Bram will say PR like I said I'll read some portions in this message of prisoner that really comforted me and that really spoke to me parag paragraph 47 brother Bram says now we are all born a free moral agent to make any decision we would we wished [Music] to God just justly does that because he must put every man on the same [Music] basis or put the wrong man he put the first man on the wrong basis he put on free moral agency we are just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve there's no [Music] difference right and wrong sets before either of us life and death we can make our choice it's up to you to make it see it's for us has to make it that's the way Adam and Eve did and see they made the wrong choice and it says by that put the whole race a human race under death the penalty of death and God came down in the form of man and took that death and PID the penalty of [Music] death that the his subject that desired to be free could go free so Adam and Eve led us to death before the freem moral agency that they had but God he came down so he can pay for the penalty of death so that those that have the desire those that will choose those that want those that make a decision to be free could go free he already paid the price he already paid the penalty but it's for each one of us to accept the penalty that was paid and each one is free or or or free to accept that penalty or to reject it now if he if he took us without the same way that he did Adam and Eve just pull us through something and said I'll save you whether you want you want save or not then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis you see but each one of us has to choose this day between death and life we can do it and as I just [Music] expressed if your light will prove your life will prove exactly what side you are on I don't care what side you say you are on what you do every day proves what you are you've heard this old saying your life is so loud I can't hear your testimony your action is so loud it says I've always believed in shouting and jumping [Music] but I've always said don't jump higher than you live because the world is going to watch that see you must you must you must just jump as high as you live so because because somebody is watching you and that life is free it's by choice we make that by the choice we make that we walk in our life it's not the forcing it's not something that somebody is imposing upon you that's why I spoke about the prisoner of love love because when we speak about a prisoner it's somebody who lost the freedom it's someone who can do nothing and when we are prisoners of Christ it's not the same as you are prisoner of a man or prisoner of a system but today when we look at our Lives Many Times many of us will find out that you are prisoner of something today in the world we have many people that are prisoners of social media pris telephone prisoners of uh phones maybe you are crossing some dangerous areas there's people that are prisoners of the fashion prisoners of Television but what we need tonight not of whom or or or what are you prisoner of and the one who wants us to be his prisoner he said that in Matthew that if you are burdened if you are prisoner of something if you are tired F if you are loaded come unto me he said when you come to me he's going to give you a yoke you you have to sorry you have to leave a a yoke so you can come to another yoke but the Yoke that he is giving you is light is light it's filled with love it's filled with good things he's filled with the goodness of of divine goodness every all that he's asking you is today I realized that I was Prisoner of something I have this burden that I cannot get rid of that I have this thing that's Weighing on me but look at he's calling me ye that are tired ye that are heavy laden come unto me I will give you rest he's not just giving you the rest for your body but he's giving you the rest for your soul also you become a prisoner but a prisoner who's resting a prisoner who's free because he said that the spirit of truth will make you free when you become his prisoner he fills you with his holy spirit you only follow follow his will but you are the most free person there is on the planet prisoner of the love of Christ is the most free person there is on Earth because all that he does he's committing himself he commit himself he's at rest he follows the the will of the master and Paul is speaking and when when writing to filon we saw that some of the epistle that Paul was writing it was say Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ Paul Servants of Jesus Christ not according to the will of man but according to the will of God but then it comes to filon he says Paul a prison of Jesus Christ yes's Paul this young man who was filled with ambitions taught by Gia fill withal I'm sure he told himself that he was going to be among the the the the highest priest that there was the most educated ones that he was going to be the the even the high priest he was full of ambition full of zeal it was well studied in the scriptures well taught he he couldn't let somebody come and break the scriptures to where when he saw a bunch of people following Jesus with a with a uh um U St Steven yeah he he participated to his death because for him it consider them it was people that were bringing a bad name upon the word on the religion that he believed he was a great preacher and in his Zeal he takes letters and on his way to Damascus he says I'm going to go to Damascus everywhere I hear about this doctrine of these people I'm going to go fight them and here he is on the way to Damascus this young man filled with ambition and on the way to Damascus something changes he sees a light just hit him and when the light hit him he falls and he hears a voice Saul Soul why persecute me he knew when when it was a light he knew that the light was speaking he knew that there was nothing else that could do that except God and as one who knew the scriptures he knew that the same light was the same light that led the children of Israel in the wilderness and then when that light was was the light that I'm of the god that I'm serving and this light Knows My Name he called me by my name why persecute thou me who are you Lord he could have said but Lord I'm at your work I'm I'm serving you I'm actually going to fulfill your work It said who are you it says I'm Jesus and it's going to be hard to kick against the prick yes is this young man filled with ambition who was in a career who had an experience that changed his life completely he that takes all his ambition all his careers and he puts it in Brackets it said go to ananas ananas here's the new career that's starting here's what I want for you a prisoner says uh paragraph 69 and Paul had been a great scholar in his days he had great Ambitions he was a man that had been trained with by people by fellow by name of Gia which was a great teacher in his day one of the greatest schools that he had been that that he could have been went to like we say Whit or Bob Jones or some great fundamental schools he had been taught as a minister of the word he was well educated and smart an intelligent Bo with a great ambition of maybe someday becoming a a priest or high priest of his people he had an ambition then find that this great ambition that he had been trained for and spent all his life maybe uh maybe the age of about eight and or 10 up to 35 30 or 35 when had finished college and graduated he had all this diplomas and everything and stood in good and stood in good uh with well the with with all the clergies high priest at Jerusalem he had orders by him personal ers written usted with this great soul to go down to Damascus and find those and find those down there that that worship the god contrary to that was said and to B them and put them in jail if necessary he had also to put them to death if he wanted to he had great Ambitions and then and now all that he had that he had trained for God had took all out of him see and what and what his objective was and what his father has spent his money for and the ambition of his father and mother was all was all had taken away from him because God had something else therefore he was a prisoner that he had in in life he had become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who was the word and God is dealing with each one of us to show us that when we have Ambitions that when we have a trajectory if our ambition and our trajectory is the same way as the word the same the same uh uh way as the word of God or the will of God it's good sometimes our Ambitions are not contrary to the word it's something good but sometimes God will decide but now I don't want to see you here anymore I don't want to see you over there it's nothing wrong that you're doing but God decides in his goodness Divine goodness in his grace now here's where I want you to be here's the way that I want you to take and when we are prisoners we don't have questions to ask we cannot ask him but what I do here there's nothing wrong with it why are you taking me in in another situation that's a lot more difficult those condition may look harder to your eyes but he knows the end before the beginning he knows what he's taking you through look he look he show Joseph that there was 11 stars there was a moon and there was a sun that was worshiping him Joseph had that dream he was waiting maybe one day that he was going to be a great king but before Joseph could get to where he was he didn't know that he was going to find himself in a in a uh uh in a ditch that was he was going to be a slave that he had to be in prison all of those things he didn't know but as long as it was God guiding him you you may not even have committed any crime and by conclusion by confusion they accuse you and they take you to jail maybe just because there's a soul in prison that God wants you so you can go witness to that Soul so you can save him and then he will get you out and then after that you'll say oh he was innocent it's a god of paradox he does things that we don't understand sometimes as prisoners on our way we are objects of mockery sometimes they looked at us without value oh look at him he was oh now he's asso associating himself with he becomes now his and says it says regardless of the mockery in the message uh um where is [Music] it yeah impersonation of Christianity paragraph 138 he says even if they're mockers paragraph 138 but if the main spring is doing take is ticking if it's controlling every emotion then the Yoke becomes easy they can say you know what there she was there she goes she used to be a doll but but look look at her now her hair is straight back her makeup is gone she wear these uh uh modest looking I don't mean to be now like something thing coming out of the [Music] Ark I but I mean this this that you should dress decently why she used to be uh the cutest little thing we'll see her laying out in the yard with a short on taking a sunbath but she don't do it anymore something happened the main spring has got in the place where it ought to be that's right oh he used to come down and he was a p shark he he could play card he could play cards he had of these and he could direct the chip uh from here and so forth he was but he don't do it no more the main spring oh he's a roll he's a Holy Roller but the yoke is easy because we are prisoners of his love we are contemplating his love we are beneficiary of his love but the yoke is easy you know what you do with it you just like to Bear it it's just like Samson when he took the Brazen gate of G Gaza the big gate brass gate he just picked it up on his shoulder and and bore it away right that's right when the yoke is in line with the joy and peace and sweetness of Christ in your heart in your heart then you just pick up all the burdens of the world the World cast on you and Buri them on a certain Hill called Calvary and there you kneel down and pray for that for that one that was persecuting you not not rain fire out of heaven and tear up the church but you bring peace to them God be merciful to them they mocking you but because of the love of Christ this yoke is easy is is is peace is filled with love is filled with joy and when they are mocking you and when they are persecuting you I love what brother says here in go back to the message prisoner paragraph 75 says and another little quotation we might drop here you see as they make fun of the church you are the church the church is not this building when it says and they make fun of the church they are really they are not really making fun of the church they are making fun of Jesus why persecute thou me that's how we said to Paul Paul was persecuting the church how could Paul then with all his intellect believe that this was this this group that he was persecuting was the very God that he claimed to be serving when you are prison of Christ when you are in the love of Christ when somebody is mocking you or Mak of you when somebody's persecuting you he's persecuting Jesus Christ is mocking Jesus Christ and say somewhere he said that like it's saying in the beatitude happy is he that is uh persecuted because of me says that means that every time somebody persecute you he's bringing is's calling the blessing of God upon you because he says Happy happy is he that is persecuted because of every time somebody is persecuting you because of Jesus he's attracting the blessing of Jesus Christ upon you so when we are prison prisoners of Christ prisoners of his will regardless of what the world is saying we are subject and and we are exposed to that blessing I'm just going to try to read some more before I finish says paragraph 94 [Music] oh God make us prisoners like that from our own selfish ambition and from our own judgments a better way of thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ I think that was a great statement that I'm that I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ and remember he is the word see no matter what anyone else thinks it's the word it's the word see if you are prisoner to the word no denomination can sway you from it it's the word you it's the word you just you are a prisoner to it that's all you must act the way it acts now he could not go certain places that he wanted because why the spirit forbid him you you want to go but the spirit tells you don't go there prisoner you want to do something the spirit says not you remember many times that Paul was trying to go someplace thinking uh there's where I could I could have a great meeting but the spirit would forbid him now does that clearly State and prove that Paul was a prisoner prisoner a prisoner of Jesus Christ harnessed to his word by the spirit oh I like that yes he was bound he was bound by a chain it's chains and by feathers of Love they are chained but they are love I love that to do the will of God and that only he was a prisoner he was in the feathers of love he was in the Yoke of Christ he could he could yoke up in nothing uh with nothing else he was yoke up with him he was led he was led where he were LED and where the the lead went that's where he had to go regardless of how green the pasture was here on this side or the or or that side he had to go the way the leader and the Yoke went oh tonight if we as the Bram Tabernacle could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we could we could completely surrender ourselves to be yolked to him no matter what the rest of the world think what the rest of the world does we are yoked with the feds of love we are prisoners my feet are so yolked with to Christ that I won't dance my eyes are so yolked with to Christ till I When I See This Modern uh uh strip teas on the streets it turns my head my heart is so yolked in love with him till I can't have love for this world anymore we are committing ourselves to him we are just choosing to be his prisoners and because of that love and of his yoke that is easy of his yoke that is joke that is filled with love he will turn us away of all the things that are of the world is that my will is so yolked to him till I don't even know what my ambitions are I don't even know what my ambitions are my ambitions are in Christ till I don't even know what my ambitions are just whatever you wherever you lead I'll follow Lord Lord I'll be a prisoner see it continues on paragraph 114 I'm trying my best not to to go past uh 8:30 yeah I believe the musicians could come paragraph 114 he wanted to talk about Moses as a prisoner the the the this hope of Moses who became a prisoner Moses who had received instructions from his mother that he was a to be a a a liberator that he was called to to to to free Israel that he had the opportunity to go to school in Great Schools of uh military schools and and get the education and he learned everything that he needed so he could be a good uh liberator with great Ambitions when he learned all of that he tried to go and Liberate the people he killed one Egyptian and what did did do he ran away he ran away in the wilderness just killing one Egyptian with everything that he had as knowledge like everything that he has an aptitude God takes him through the Wilderness four 40 Years of emptying out and when he comes back 40 years later look at this great intellectual Moses what is it telling God I don't know how to speak God said I'll send you I don't know how to speak 40 Years of emptying out he took even away his speech says here but before I say about Moses I'd like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that will serve him truly to be his prisoner always a man has to surrender every Ambitions is God everything that he he is everything his life his soul his body will ambition and everything else and and and become a and become completely uh complete a prison of Christ who is the word to serve him to serve God you might you might have to walk contrary to your better judgment [Music] maybe in certain organization you might think that they could uh uh lift you up and give you some uh something great that you might that you might flash but what it says but what what do you find yourself and find yourself defeated defeated after while until God can get a man that's willing to become a prisoner to him God is looking for prisoners tonight God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search you might search it through the scriptures a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you are only connected with Christ and him alone only then God can use you until then you can't let's stand I know I have three more pages but I believe that we understand that God meets us as prisoners each one of us knows what you're going through you know what you are what what what is it that you are prisoner to what is it that occupies you the most than God what is stopping you to be more close closer to God what is stopping you to be more concentrated consecrated to God but God tonight he's looking for prisoners like I said in the beginning brother Beno in the office when we were back [Music] there I pray that when you're going to preach that you're going to preach something that will you know talk to me I said oh my brother I said I'm going to preach for myself first I want to be his prisoner and I believe it's the will of each one of us tonight may God help us tonight to have one principal uh OB objective one principal thought to be prisoners of Christ what is he want out of [Music] us what is his will concerning us sometimes you pray he some he seem to be quiet he may seem quiet that shouldn't discourage us that shouldn't stop us from believing it's just him he knows that during that period where he seemed to be quiet he's working on your patience maybe he wants to teach you to be patient and he's never [Music] late even even if it decides to answer your prayer 20 years later maybe he will answer your prayers two days before you die but he will hear it and it doesn't mean that everything that you went through During the period where you thought it was silent that you were in the wrong direction as long as you commit yourself to him oh Lord I commit myself to you it's your word that I want to follow Lord I'm I'm a prisoner what you say I want to conform to your word I want to follow your word whether he hears my prayer answers my prayer on a certain topic or not as long as I know I'm I'm his prisoner you know Paul knew he had a burden he said he prayed the Lord he said he prayed this is a great minister of the Gospel this great Apostle who is Healing The Sick who is fulfilling great things but he himself that he had something that he prayed the Lord many times and God didn't answer to his prayers and when he insisted the Lord tells him my grace is sufficient that's how God heard his prayer my grace is sufficient for you he told us seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness and all other things and then he didn't say Seek first the kingdom and then seek other things rest he says the rest will be given unto you so when you find that this is the most important thing he gives you he will give you the rest whether you ask or not when you are his prisoner let's bow our heads God our [Music] Father it's the Cry of my heart tonight and I believe it's the prayer of my brother and my sister we want to be your prisoners oh certainly we have we have had great Ambitions we had projects we have things we want accomplished as he said in the word that in the hearts of man there's many projects but it's really the only the the the wills of the will of the Lord that will come to pass that's why Lord here we are as your children look here we are as your prisoners tonight oh [Music] Lord if we have been prisoners of something else if we somehow privileged something else outside of your word forgive us forgive our shortcomings look at us through the blood of your son attract us closer to you even [Music] more that only your will be fulfilled that's our prayer that's our desire Lord as kid as children as you showed us when we become your prisoners we don't even know what our Ambitions are you don't know we don't know where you will take us tomorrow or where you going to take us the day after just help us listen to your voice help us listen to your guidance as we commit ourselves to you bless each one of your children oh Lord no we have desires in filled in our heart each one is probably praying with our own words in our in our heart father hear the Cry of each because we know your word when is spoken is spirit and life it will transform us it will give us life let it be that way Lord tonight as we ask it humbly and with all our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen oh Jesus all for Jesus all I am and have and ever hope to me oh [Music] Jesus J all [Music] all of my ambitions and all of my all my ambition oh I

me you know there's two prisons in this world there's the one that's presented to you of wake up in the morning work work school all these different things that this world has to offer that in itself is a prison and it's in the mind but if we can become a prisoner of Christ we don't walk like the world we don't think like the world we're in this world but not of this world that is my heart's cry to be more like him let's sing this song all I want to see is Jesus and oh I know the the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the whole me fire all my works and all my deeds and every pray set on by the knees the L before the holy consuming [Music] fire all I want to see is [Music] Jesus Oh all I want to see is heav oh and all I want to see is [Music] Jesus oh sh through

Stripes we're healed amen Lord Jesus we just thank you that we're able to come together and hear your word Lord there's many other places where the Believers don't have this privilege and opportunity because of the climate of the countries they live in there's uh anti-conversion laws and communism Lord that fights against this very word that we believe and Lord forgive us when we take it for granted to come and be with our brothers and sisters of precious like Faith it's certainly a great privilege and honor Lord what a wonderful word we heard tonight that we want to be your prisoner and Lord when we think of that thought so many times we think naturally of a prison and what a prison in the natural does is it it locks you in and it doesn't let you leave but really Lord what a prisoner of you does is it keeps everything out yes we see all the bars and all the bar wire and everything that it looks like it's keeping everybody in but Lord when we're your prisoner It's Your Love keeping everything out Lord that when the enemy would try to assel us he'd have to come through the blood and but we're your prisoner Lord there's nothing that can cross that bloodline and oh we just want to be so in love with you Lord Jesus that as our brother pointed out yes that there is a we're trading a yoke for a yoke but oh your yoke it's easy Lord the enemy wants to make us a a great have a great Taskmaster and run us so far down in the muck and Meer of sin but oh God you lift us up you Place us upon a strong Rock of Revelation Lord and and then we take your yoke and it's easy Lord It's leading us into the promised land it's leading us to a body change it's leading Us in joy and truth and righteousness Lord where all things are new father and when we wake up tomorrow Lord your mercies will be new once again father Lord we thank you for your healing touch Lord in our bodies Lord we we know that you heal us Lord and on this side we'll get sick again and but one of these days Lord we'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah Lord and soon and very soon we'll see our loved ones just coming into this Dimension and telling us it's time it's time to go home and then it all be over lord we'll all be gathered together with the messenger of the age and there will come that that great climatic moment where we look upon your face what a day that will be Lord it'll all be worth it then all the all the hardship all the heartache all the hurt all the pain oh it's just a moment Lord on this side but one of these days we'll have eternity just to talk it over and one of these days Lord you'll wipe that tear away from our eyes and say don't weep anymore enter into the kingdom we love you Lord we just thank you we see those that weren't with us tonight Lord I pray you do something special for them Lord that their heart would be so set on fire to be in the house of God that it even lift us up into higher Realms Lord we thank you for bringing our pastor
