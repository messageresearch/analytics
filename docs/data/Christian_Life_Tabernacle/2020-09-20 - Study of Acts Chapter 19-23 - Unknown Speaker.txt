morning lord in preparation lord to see you openly among us lord we're at a point in our lives lord that we realize just coming together and being seen and heard lord it's that time has passed the lord we come to have you speak directly to us lord we might have an open ear and a ready hard lord that your word can make a difference lord when there's nothing else in this world lord that can give life lord the scientists think they have it figured out and prevention of death and all these things lord but we look to you lord we know you're the the true life-giver and lord there's only one form of eternal life and that's what we're believing that we have lord and we're searching that the others that don't have it lord we can quicken it to them so we pray lord we can see the tender hand of jehovah displayed here amongst us today lord may we just lay a thought lay aside any of the thoughts that would hinder and lord even our own actions lord may it all be completely subject to the holy spirit lord that you can just woo yourself in amongst us lord and change lives lord we pray that you can or touch any that may be sick here this morning any needy lord even by the way of remote checking in lord we know that you're on this i'm a present and omniscient god lord and lord do this for your people we pray so we have needs lord lord as we sing these songs we read of your word lord we know that's where you exist and live we pray that you just be with us now lord we we thank you for what you've done for us the blessings you've given and we look forward to what you will do even in this service today lord we ask all these things believing now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen good to be gathered in the house of god i want to welcome everyone this morning i trust you excited to be gathered here amen i know that uh gatherings like this are no longer to be taken for granted amen certainly thankful that god will give us the opportunity amen let's invite brother mike for a psalm reading this morning god bless you amen that is a much longer walk good morning so you know we we all know the the story of david and goliath you know where we're taught that story many of us from the time that we're knee-high you know what you know here you have a young man still a boy before he'd ever been on the throne or before he'd ever run a kingdom or before he'd ever fought in any battles he's facing this giant you know the thing is is the giant never saw this coming you know when the giant came before the children of israel david was not even in the picture he was out there targeting their mightiest soldier their king that stood head and shoulders above all and he was expecting to show with force of strength how he could overcome with strength this challenge and what steps out is a little boy with a sling and he's just like are you kidding me i'm gonna squash you like a bug but you know the thing is is we know the story david wins a big victory there but from that moment on there's a target on his back from the moment he takes that stand against the giant he begins to be a target of the entire bloodline of that giant and his family while they weren't looking for him the first time they were looking for him from that time for the rest of his life after that you know you can read the account in second samuel 21 about how one by one each members of that giant's family came to try to take him out because he had made a stand against the giant you know and one by one many times with the help of others he overcame each time that giant came came around defeated him giant would raise up he would defeat him the giant would raise up and he would defeat him until finally toward the end of his life when that final giant was defeated for the final time david begins to raise his voice in a song of praise and the entire chapter of second samuel 22 is him praising the lord for the final defeat over the giant in the bloodline of that giant and he says an interesting thing in in second samuel 22 49 he says thou also has lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou has delivered me from the violent man you know after this entire lifeline of doing battle with assyria with that giant in his kin david sums that up as his battle with the violent man that's how he describes it you know unlike david from the very first moment that we take a stand against that giant that stands in in our flesh that big old pile of meat and bones that would through force of strength try to push us and pressure us and crush us from that life that was in it is in us but from the time that we first stand up there is a constant target on our back until we defeat that giant for the thing david speaks about quite a bit in psalm 140 verse 1 he says deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man in verse 4 he says preserve me from the violent man who would who have purposed to overthrow my goings so this violent man is defined by a very specific purpose to overthrow my goings in psalm 86 14 he says the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul not my body my soul and in proverbs 16 29 a violent man enticeth his neighbor and leadeth him into the way that is not good so you have the characteristic of this pressure of the meat and bones of our flesh that would seek to entice us to draw away to crush our soul to overthrow our goings that giant that each of us must do battle with from the very first time we step out to challenge its power you know i think that the prayer of each of us would be like david in psalm 140 deliver me from my violent man right and just like some in second samuel 22 you know the lord has anointed us to defeat that man that's right he has quickened us to overcome and just like david said in second samuel 22 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation and that bringeth bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also has lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me one he like david who had a victory over his violent man were also promised that same victory so when you make that first stand welcome to the battle and we also have a promise that we'll overcome so as we read psalm 140 today and it speaks of the violent man let's consider the struggle that we're in the victory that were promised and that the violent man the giant in our life represents a clue that we're in a victorious battle let's read that together psalm 140 deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they gathered together for war they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adder's poison is under their lips say them keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purpose to overthrow my goings the proud have hid his snare for me and courts they have spread a net by the wayside they have set jinns for me selah i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my supplications o lord o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battle grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his wicked device lest they exalt themselves say look as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover them let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits that they rise not up again let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violet man to overthrow him i know the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presence amen god bless you may be seated amen at this time again good morning amen uh we i want to bring you up to date on a few uh uh events and things that are transpiring in the church so uh we'll all have kind of a clear understanding of what we're doing as we're going forward as you know we've been dealing with the city of bedford for over a couple years trying to get a building permit and have our properties become one property well we're in the very final stage of that now we've turned in all the paperwork and everything that they need to what is referred to as platting the property so the lot next door and this lot will now become one property the property is owned by the church it is not owned by me i had purchased both properties but i have donated both of the properties to the church so the church owns the property the the churches governed by a set of bylaws that we have written that govern our church we have bylaws that everybody that's how we operate our is by our church bylaws the trustee board has a certain responsibility and the deacon board has a certain responsibility and so what we've been trying to do of course is have a place where we can sit and have space and have room for our children and and have sunday school classrooms and and uh and you say well isn't the lord coming yes but we're going to plant our potatoes we're going to be diligent in doing what we should do so we're and in in the process of doing that what that we're doing is is we're preparing for the future so we're making accommodations now in decisions now for what is going to take place in the future we have always been and i personally have always been someone that was reactionary another as a problem would come up i would react a problem would come up and i would react i never really believed much in preventive maintenance i believe when it finally wore out then deal with it but that's not always the best way to perceive so well in in our effort to prepare for the future we've undertaken a lot of different programs or different uh uh challenges that we're facing one of them is we're going to redo our complete sound system redo all our technology redo our website and just try to bring everything up to a better point brother mike parks has been placed in charge of coordinating all that effort with the sound people the technical people the deacons the musicians the ministry and building for us an internet a sound system and the technical things that all involve you know i'm not very technical so i'm not going to try to put too much in there they told me that they could do all this stuff without cables so i guess i have to believe him and so i want to introduce to you this morning a new member of our church family and um and so he's standing over here his his brother brent wetzel and he's a born-again christian he's been born again and spirit-filled since 1969 and we have hired brent and his company to offer us some security now let me i'll explain that to you in a moment but brent is a licensed and insured top-tier security guard he's certified in first aid cpa the use of defibrillators and things like that he's trained in traffic control with traffic control experience now let me explain to you well brent first of all stand up and come up here brother and i want to introduce you and uh and so this is brother brent and i want you to get to know him and he's here to to uh serve you uh he he's gonna be providing for us some comfort and some work that we have to have done uh for the city and so when you see him out there he's he's not there to arrest you uh he's not there to check your immigration papers he's not there to give you a c19 test uh he's a he's a set of eyes and uh so uh just if you get a chance to shake his hand or give him a knock or stay six feet and wave to him whatever you're comfortable with i i hope that you get used to him and understand and i'll explain to you here in a moment why that we have him and what's going so i'm sorry that i had to go help my mother i'm not sorry i had to go help my mother don't no don't misinterpret that by any means i had to apologize to brent because i didn't get a chance to introduce him properly because of some the situations and circumstances but we're trying to make that right this morning and he loves the lord and he loves god's people and i think you'll be glad to have him so brent i'm sorry i have to send you back to work brother and so um in in part of preparing for the future when it and if the lord allows us to build our new building and we always approach everything lord willing we're going to have quite a bit of territory to keep our eyes on our parking lot is going to go almost to two and a half acres of parking we're going to have over 170 parking places and what we've hired brett for is that while you're sitting here in church you know that your cars are protected in the parking lot in the past we've had people drive into our parking lot and go through our cars and so we're going to put an end for that to that also in the environment uh anybody knows when the economy goes down crime goes up and people become desperate for any number of reasons and it's important in the security world and even in your own christian lives that you never want to present yourself as a soft target you know you know somebody that's vulnerable somebody that's unsure and by providing external security it allows for people to realize that this is not a soft target in other words this isn't an easy place to come and commit a crime and so we've asked him to do that plus also he is certified in first aid so if someone was to be in the parking lot or have a heart attack or or something then he know he has the ability to respond to that we will probably get a defibrillator to be here on site along with a first responders kit and i know that we don't ever anticipate any problem and we know that if god doesn't watch the city the watchman watches in vain but that's like saying god knows what i have need of so i'm not going to pray god knows i love him so i'm not going to worship and that is not due diligence so i believe we're going to grow and if the lord tarries we have children that are growing up children are moving off your laps and off the floor onto a a seat so we we have to make preparations for those things so having somebody out there allows our deacons to do the job that they're supposed to do in the framework of the church so our deacons can be about our duty you can sit in here this morning and know that you're outside is being taken care of also it relieves us our deacons and our congregation from a lot of liability that goes with an incident so we have an insured hired security guard uh watching our outside while we're in here worshiping that is uh uh as as many of you know if you would read the first uh uh verses of uh the 13th chapter of romans the fourth fourth verse says for he is a minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil and so there's many scriptures in the bible that recognizes law enforcement and security we're very fortunate to have a a police officer that attends our church a dallas police officer that attends our church brother isaac i don't know if you're here this morning i know sometimes he has to work on a sunday but we're grateful for that and we support our law enforcement and uh and so that that's why brent's here he's he's here so i can sit in my office you can sit in this church and know that there's somebody out there that's trained watching if some something happened out there at that we know he's trained in first aid and can be there to help and we'd also like to know this morning that if any of you are come in the first responder category if any of you are certified in cpr or certified in a first aid or have some sort of first aid training some of you are doctors some are nurses if you could turn that information into brother jackson brother chris brother john one of the deacons and just write your name what you're certified in and turn it in then we can look across the congregation if we have a child fall down or something and we need somebody we'll know who to reach out to so we want to do that because we we want to we know these are difficult times and i think that we really have to be more conscious of taking care of one another than we've ever been taking care of one another so if you know that if somebody's unemployed uh then and you know they have a need i encourage you to reach out to them and help them the best that you can if you can't help then you can report back to us to myself the deacons one of the ministers such and such is in need but this is a time that we need to take care of one another more than we've ever taken care of one another that we we need to invite one and over have one another reach out one to one to another i think congregational care is something that belongs to all of us and we're a body and we're fitted and joined together and each one supplies the need to the other and so there's no program that we could ever put in place that would ever take the place of your personal love your personal care your personal words of encouragement your personal involvement in somebody's life who has a need and that was why the first church failed is they adopted nickelodeonism and they passed all the responsibility onto a group of of man and and the holy spirit is who leads our term and the spirit of god said it's the love of god shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit so i want you to be involved in that love i want you to be conscious of the leadership of the holy spirit to take care of one another to reach out to one another to look after one another to to have your ears up if you hear somebody is in a burden or a trial see what you can do to help see if you can find somebody to help you take care of them and do whatever you can and and then if you need to you can reach out to the church but let's try to take care of it at a congregational level first amongst ourselves amen another reason i also wanted to let you know why that we have uh brother brent if the city of bedford may require us to provide traffic uh assistance and uh so uh if it comes to that time we'll have to have somebody stand in the street stop cars and let people out so we're making preparations for that in the future we certainly don't uh want that also uh this last uh yesterday we had our first children's fellowship and from all the reports i've heard it was really a wonderful time with the children and so we can't have sunday school now our facility with our seating and the seating we had to move out of the sanctuary to the back it doesn't allow us to have sunday school so sunday school is i guess the best word to use is on hold until we can resume it and when we can resume it we'll resume sunday's goal in the meantime we're going to have children fellowship uh events or or saturdays where we gather all the children in provide to them some bible teaching some activities and a lunch or food it may be held here at the church it may be in a different venue but we will we will plan those and announce them as we have them we're going to try to shoot for once a month if it works easier we may do some other things but we may have some some programs according to age groups we may do an all-encompassing thing but we're going we're going to have some different things for our children in that sunday school age group as we go forward so we haven't forgotten them we are trying to do something for them that we can and and lastly we do try to have a small area in the back of the church that we can provide some form of social distancing uh for those who feel they need a little extra space and also if you want to come to church we're not as crowded on wednesday evenings and sunday evenings so that is also a time that you can come and have more space so if you have any questions you can certainly contact me uh direct uh lee and i think i sent out an email with my phone number on it and i'll be happy to answer any questions that you have and and um uh you know it's it's it's just things are different being in a big city and having a government out there and and all the things that they're requiring us to do but we're going to persevere and if god be for you who can be against you amen so um and so i just hope that you understand why we've went forward and i've discussed it with the elders of the church and and they'll encourage us in the things that we're doing i hope i have your support and your prayers and i think together that we're going to fight this battle tell our feet leave this ground amen and i don't know which way the world's going but i know we're going up amen and we don't want to leave anybody behind and so we're here we're here to nourish our souls we're here to draw closer to our lord and savior we're here to worship him and to praise him and uh and it's just when you have a body we're not an organization but we should be organized we shouldn't we shouldn't be in confusion but we should be in order and so that's what we're trying to do is place everything in order and i know a lot of these things don't cross your mind but part of my office requires me to to uh take these things into consideration and we're doing them for you so god bless you we love you so much we'll bring billy back to lead us in worship and then brother george will come out and minister the word of god to us then we can go outside and fellowship and and and love the lord and come back together this evening it at five o'clock and we have a couple baptisms after service this morning so if you can stay for the baptism we we always love to have that if you have to go just feel free to go but anyway god bless you this morning brother billy as we turn the service back to you amen amen sing the wondrous love of jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] uh [Music]

thank you lord for all your blessings lord sometimes we don't know what the future the next hour but we know that you're in control bless your people today bless brother david his family protect us lord we ask in jesus name amen you may be seated it's good to be back here after several months i was here in march maybe some of you don't remember but we were here and according to my records we got through chapter 19 of the book of acts remember that's why we're going to cover 19 again but um you know before we get started on the word just want to give you a word of um report about the missionary activities because first and foremost i'm a missionary to other countries i travel through here to encourage the saints but um we do have the church age book printed in english and spanish and it's available to you know everybody and um we also realize that there's god is still calling people um we're still here so the last one hasn't been found but there's people eagerly looking for him and her and just in the months of this year only this year there's been thousands baptized in mexico and brazil and other places so we hear about them they send us pictures sometimes and these are the brothers that are out there facing the enemy facing the trials and things but god is is with them and the gospel is still true the word is still the word it doesn't matter who speaks it um i want to thank you for the offerings that you've given and for the clothes that you've donated that we send to venezuela venezuela is very very needy went to the dollar and the dollar went high you know sky high uh hyperinflation and everything is just a total wreck because they've tried to institute socialism which they have no history of ever working any place only for the three people at the top just the way it works that's why you're here but we do send stuff every two weeks and we have a secure way of getting it to them we can't help everybody we're helping many families and the lord has blessed in in africa in malawi i was over there last year and turns out that this one group of people was thrown out of their church because the man that helped him build the church wanted it back if you come here we're going to shoot you fine we won't go there so they met under the trees for a while and then they found a piece of property that you know they had saved up about a third of the money necessary for the for the property and so they reached out said could you help us with the other two thirds and so we approached a few brothers and yeah we can send the money well by the time the money got there and everything the other people that wanted that property reached in and bought it it just so happened it was a catholic church but i told them don't worry god's got something better for you keep looking so god provided a place out of town a little ways a couple acres and um so they're busy you know leveling it and and uh you can build a church and so they're such lovely people and they said oh well we're glad that god has provided we want to call this the george smith tabernacle i said i don't think so we're going to call this walking in the light tabernacle okay so they've registered that so they're busy with that but it's one of these places that's very poor that they don't know what the next day is bringing so they're um they're very happy and also during this um pandemic i mean it's it's kind of a joke right there are people dying i first admit but they politicized it okay so these many thousands of people died well so nobody's died of cancer nobody's died of heart attacks during this time uh coming down the road you all saw the same sign i did in these ten months nine months of this year on texas roads only 243 people have died well if we had the little short italian guy in charge he would park all the cars right highway should come people got get the cars off hot road well that's not the answer why did those people die how many were on drugs how many were mad at their wife how many were on alcohol so let's go where the problem is you know but this is laodicea and the reason it's so insane is not because they don't come to this church is because a prophet said many years ago if this goes on the way it's going now which at that time it looked like it's pretty smooth but he said if it keeps going on the way it's going now in 50 years he'll be total insanity yeah that was that was six years ago so the 50 years so that's why we have these problems but we're looking up you know because um jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now the alternative to that is stay in bondage you have a choice this is america you have a choice well brother random says over here in uh 1964 knowing that you are my responsibility in other words you're under my umbrella uh and in my hands for the gospel i'll always want to keep you right in the pages of this bible brother brown didn't bring a new gospel he preached what paul preached you see so we have our anchor in the word so during this time we've also had many zoom meetings i've got another one tomorrow and it's not just you know spanish or english just in several languages like tomorrow we have a meeting that's going to be in spanish portuguese and german and so they've asked me to say a few words and that happens at least once a week so we're reaching more people and not spending near as much money because we can't go but we have the technology you know so the lord has blessed well um we don't want to stay with the alternative we don't want to stay in bondage we want to stay in the truth the truth shall make you free not brother david not brother george not jackson the truth shall make you free so we're going to take the liberty today to preach out of brother branham's absolute has anybody got a problem good start to give you a chance but um i was listening to a tape this morning unfailing realities and it's still the unfailing realities it's it's real you know and only god knows what the um what the outcome he knows who the real ones are you know brother brahm said in every congregation there's three kinds of believers all i see is believers but god knows the hearts so you just sit still and turn to page turn to page ninth or chapter 19 of the book of acts we're going to go through this we'll see how far we get maybe we'll get through does anybody know how many books there are in the book of acts how many chapters 28 but we might not get finished tonight so um in chapter 19 of the book of acts we have apollos a good baptist preacher preaching in corinth paul was traveling through there and he came into contact with some believers in the city of ephesus okay now ephesus at that time could have been a city of 350 000 people and um priscilla and aquila man and wife were there and they had a business of tent manufacturing okay that's affordable uh camp trailers let's say tents and so verse two and um he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since he believed so paul comes across these believers and they said well we don't even know there's such a thing it's the holy ghost and so um verse 3 and he said unto them and well how in the world were she baptized then well unto john's baptism that was the only truth they knew at the time they knew no more truth the light hadn't shined any farther for them but now the light is there and he posed a question and so we mis you know john's baptism uh he said paul then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance he's very good saying to the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized according to romans according to what according to acts 2 38 which is the manifestation of jesus red letter words in matthew 28 19. nowhere in the bible where are you going to find where anybody was baptized according to the exact words of jesus christ in matthew 28 19. but there's a revelation there's a it's it's a rose that opens up oh that's what it is and so these people were baptized in the name of jesus christ then paul laid his hands on them and the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all them were about 500 people no it was a little group of 12 people not even these two benches here all this over 12 people yeah mighty paul but he was dedicated he was yielded to how god was leading him okay so they were perfectly carrying out the pattern of acts chapter 2. great missionary paul baptizing 12 people mentioned that so the same was done throughout the scriptures and every place they were spreading the gospel the name of the lord jesus christ up until the catholic church had the council we're going to put this thing in order because we say so because we've got the gold and we've got the nice clothes and we say it should be this way in 325 and from then we had problems but there's always been people baptized in the name of jesus christ all the way through history but now we come into the fullness of the word and our prophet made it very simple and very obvious to us so we know god by his word and we know god by revelation right and we have an open book this is not a dead letter now see in the days of paul he had to he had to you know have fusses with the sadducees and the pharisees some of these people didn't believe in revelation they didn't believe in uh what he called the resurrection angelic means nothing all the head was dead letter but we have a living letter you know so um paul stayed in this area over two years as pastor verse 10. and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks well the predestinated herder okay and um so we're moving along and when you have time this afternoon i would suggest that you read carefully chapter three of the exposition of the seven church ages and if you don't have a book i'll bring you one tonight yeah we've got them in the car um in speaking about the early church brother adam says on page 86 their persecutions and trials and patience were not let's start over their persecutions and trials and patience were over the blessed name of jesus you know that is not at all strange for it is the word and the name that brings the enemy pouring after us like a flood that mighty word which was manifested in healing signs wonders and demonstrations caused the pharisees to scream out for the death of the true believers now these people these pharisees are not communist they're not you know no they're word people they memorize their prophet's words but where there's a manifestation of it they just couldn't handle it screaming out for the death of the true believers and now the name hated and despised by the jews is mocked by the cultured in other words the important people the arrogant people you've met some american people this week my way or no way just out of my way i've got the biggest baddest car i'll get my take what i want no the name was hated and despised by jews is mocked by the cultured as they laughed to think that anyone could be so foolish as to believe a man who died and rose again and is now seated in heaven see this was like comic books to them they couldn't believe that so here they're here where the religious persecutors the jews cursing this jesus and that caused paul to leave corinth okay who to them was a false messiah and here were the others laughing with delight and mocking sarcastically at the name of the new god who to them wasn't a god at all now here's something else that started in that age and we'll continue right down through the ages getting deeper and darker right through today that is people were repudiating that name that means refusing to recognize they were rejecting it it was not the true ephesian church that was doing it no sir it was the false apostles quoting their prophet's words be careful it was the outsider trying to get in and defile the believers the ephesians knew the name and loved it so we are in love with jesus christ he is the one that's leading this bribe okay brother branham also says over in 1955 now as moses went with that judgment stick before him that same stick tonight to the church is jesus christ if those egyptians could ever got that little stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can never get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he's got the church quipped and we've long we've lived long enough to see these words fulfilled we've got people in pulpits right this minute with this same bible quoting this same prophet but taking the deity out of the name of jesus christ and putting it over here over there over there and the church is flat and they don't know what to do with the young people and they got a lot of problems because they got it out of balance now this has got two purposes one to keep you in balance and one to keep you awake okay so may god help us that is why some followers of this glorious message seem to be whipped and powerless they're following personalities and not the god of the bible they haven't stayed in the pages of the bible the way the prophet said you know this is not a religion of convenience whatever you like okay we're in chapter 19 verse 11. and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons in other words you know cloths and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out from them in rome there's a church called the church of paul outside the walls because when they took paul's head off back in i think of 67 a.d it happened outside the walls somewhere on that street where the church is and so this church is put there in memory of him because that's where his tomb was it still is and so when we were first there in 1973 i think it was you know there was a grave marker and it was it was a stone that was it was broke it was in several pieces and so i was a tourist you know but i asked the lady so why is it like that well she says for many years people have come by here and tied a rock and a cloth to a string and let it down and when it hit it would hit the sarcophagus you know where paul's bones are and they would pull it back out and people were healed oh yeah like it says right here well in the year 2000 the pope had a great idea let's bring that out of the ground and have it here on the surface where people can reach it and that's where it's at today so it's still having an effect now um 13 through 20 has to do with vagabond jews in other words jews out of order jews that were you know out of balance and they were freelance they weren't orthodox there was a man named siva a chief priest amongst the jews and he knew his prophet's words very well i'm not teaching you against using the prophet's words but you got to keep in balance brother branham wasn't out of the scripture this message is not like the people in salt lake city that is something separate no it's all one thing same spirit you see and so he knew his prophet's words well he had seven sons okay and they were into exercising or casting out demons and spirits and so forth and they heard about the success of paul verse 11 uh that from his body were taken you know clots and people were healed and so they thought hey we should try that so they found a man with an evil spirit he was actually insane man and verse 13 we adjure you in the name of jesus whom paul preaches in other words what's going on over there we're with them they were not witnesses they were only wannabes they had no no concept of what was really about they just saw the effects of it and so what happened in verse 15 and the spirit and the evil spirit answered out of this crazy man jesus i know and paul i know but who are you guys so don't go about go don't go around repeating things unless you have an experience because the unbeliever can tell the difference and little children can tell the difference so you don't lie to little children you got to speak truth to them okay verse 16 and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on these seven guys and overcame them and prevailed against them so that what he got all their clothes off and beat them up and they had to run away that's pretty powerful yeah but in all of that confusion verse 17 and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling in ephesus and fear fell on them in the name of the lord jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds okay so such was the conviction in their heart due to the reality of christ in the preaching of the word and the miracles and so forth verse 19 many of them also used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed okay so all these magicians you know wow this is something real and they had a book burning and it was the only way to get rid of evil spirits okay i had a great revival this book burning they were really serious about following in the way they burned their stuff this is their livelihood you know and it's the only way to follow jesus christ properly it's not optional it's not popular but they were convicted by the holy ghost preaching and they got real serious okay now i knew a man a long time ago he had just come to the lord and he was just a man in the world he knew nothing about nothing but he just like people come into this church and they saw that it's real what do you think he did he went home and he was a logger and he had a 16 inch chainsaw he had a big collection of really nice albums long play records two weeks before that he had been offered three thousand dollars for that collection but now he's a believer he took that chainsaw cut all his records burned him that's the only way to get rid of evil spirits okay so the value of the books back there was um what do you say here 50 what yeah a lot of silver okay well that happens to be 50 000 days wages for one man or about the equivalent of 10 men's wages for 14 years what they once thought was valuable and a way of life was now trash in the fire anything that was contrary to jesus christ went into the fire you got to be serious you know we hear brother brandon say about throughout the tv oh but guess what we've got something better than tv now there's only 500 channels on tv we got it all here be careful where your little fingers go okay just just telling you so um they applied the token for real and uh but satan was on the scene verse 20. uh the word of god grew mightily uh-huh so with all this going on you know verse 23 uh and the same time there arose no small stir about the way i'm the way the truth and the life that one word cotton these are people of the way so people started talking about it you see and um in john 14 6 yeah i'm the way the truth and the life so um that one word stuck in their mind and as usual the other twin was right nearby it happens in this church it happens on your job everywhere when god blesses us here's that other guy it's a continual confusion to keep you in balance it's not going to be all peaches and cream no it's going to be a struggle excuse me and there was a revival people were turning from idol worship away from you know favorite personalities being baptized living right and um but the people that got upset was the ones making the idols because it was it was an industry there was people busy you know polishing and so forth and um demetrius was a silversmith in the in ephesus he crafted the the uh the elaborate shrines for the temple of diana that's the roman name artemis was the greek name and in verse 25 they had a union meeting to discuss their future okay at a union meeting verse 25 and when he called together um when he called together the workmen of like occupation sirs you know that by this craft we have our wealth this is how we all have our nice stuff because we sell these crazy idols moreover you see in here that not alone at ephesus but almost all of asia this paul has persecuted and turned away much people saying that there be no gods which are made with hands just preaching the truth you know okay let's let's be real honest here how many of you came from the catholic church just be honest we're not going to give out no prizes okay you know what it is to count the beads light the candles pray to a dead idol it's not god okay so 27 so that not only this craft is in danger to be at you know zero but also the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshipeth they had a going thing there you know 28 and when they heard these things they were full of wrath they were upset screaming and hollering confusion and cried out saying great is diana of f of the ephesians and the whole city was filled with confusion imagine that and having caught uh gaius and aristocars men of macedonia paul's companions in travel they rest with one accord unto the theater in other words they're going to bring some justice to this situation these guys are tearing up our our whole livelihood and so we got to do something and and so they brought them for you know some kind of justice but see in verse 6 and 12 and 17 there was great blessing of the lord the name of the lord was magnified but now in verse 29 there's mass confusion okay it only took two christians into custody brought them to the public area verse 32 some therefore cried one thing and some another okay so we got conflicting you know accusations here couldn't agree among themselves for the assembly was confused and the more part uh knew not where they were even come together does that sound like what we've endured in this country the last two months they don't know why they're there they're just there for the party and the blah blah blah and somebody gets killed no problem there's more it's the same confusion it's crazy verse 34 and when they knew that that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours we worship god for 20 minutes and we get tired shave that brother moses with the guitar he could have sung all i could have just sat and worshiped the lord you know but these people for two hours great as diana of the ephesians now paul wanted to go in and help he thought he could go in there and you know set some things in order but his friends and companions stopped him not like you're going to get hurt so it was a well uh calculated ruckus that's what it was and it only produces confusion that's all they had they even confess it's confusion um but um their attention was focused on this brother alexander in verse 34 when they knew that he was a jew okay so they let this guy this this guy we're going to kill you know well so what we have here is a religious riot in ephesus because of the way and what it produces what's that god fearing god living people okay they're willing to take a stand for the truth no matter what it costs you see no matter what the relatives thought about it we're going to stand for the truth and that caused confusion with these other people so these were our brothers and sisters this isn't somebody way far off no this we're the we're part of that same church you see and um they were the present day fulfillment of hebrews 13 8 because the scripture is forever jesus christ's name yesterday for today and forever didn't start with william branham it's been here all along and even back then there was no new testament they were living it out you see back in 1950 brother branham said behold the lamb of god get ready wake up lift up your heads redemption is drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing critics and infidels waxing worse and worse yeah 1950 that was a long time ago most of you weren't even alive yet you know growing wax and worse we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to god so you are wasting your time going on the internet and seeing what these people say and thinking that you and your canary brain are going to straighten it out don't go it'll take you down and you'll walk out of this church and commit all kinds of things stay with the truth okay so the believer that is secure and fortified by the word of god knows that first john 4 4 is the truth greater is he that's in me than he that's out there jesus prayed for you amen yeah jesus prayed for you believer in 21 20 here in this time neither pray i for these alone john 17 20 but for them also who believe on me through their word so these that he's talking to he knows he's gonna go out there and they're gonna repeat and they're gonna so they're gonna give testimony and he's praying for praying for us the gospel didn't come to dallas in a parachute somebody had to travel over here okay some people stayed up too late last night we don't serve coffee here so you were in the thoughts of jesus christ even before he hung on the cross he could see that there's going to be believers in dallas way back there let's see he loves you how much so much that he died and rose again on the third day and that is the gospel resurrection is the cornerstone of our message brother bram's ministry is wonderful but the resurrection is the cornerstone so in this case here in chapter 19 the mayor the town clerk he got him quieted down he explained to him you know 35 through 41. you men of ephesus calm down in other words people we have laws look at verse 35 uh when the town clerk appeased the people he said you men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshiper of the great goddess diana and the image which fell down from jupiter seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly in other words cease with the confusion for ye have brought hither these men these christians which are neither robbers of churches and they don't blaspheme your goddess wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the court is open you know we can take care of this but if you inquire anything concerning these other matters hey this this is an unlawful assembly here for we're in danger of being called into question being arrested for nonsense and when they thus spoke and you dismissed the assembly okay so that's the scene of chapter 19 chapter 20 verse 1 and after this uproar was ceased after you know they all went home paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed to go to macedonia so after the riot paul had a meeting with the faithful embraced and prayed and he moved on to another city of macedonia so the text goes on to mention several of his faithful traveling companions there were seven of them and of significance in verse six they sailed for five days to cover 200 miles they didn't have gasoline engines they didn't have diesel engines you know all they had was the wind and the rowing it's the only way to get there they were patient people they didn't have an other choice now we live in a world of many many choices i just traveled from bristol tennessee to arkadelphia was over 700 miles in 13 hours you know and i came here and you know you all travel you know what it's like in brazil on the amazon river where there's no road they have diesel-powered barges it takes six days to cover 1200 miles so you know there's all kinds of choices so they were with the believers that were there in troas for uh seven days at trials as a part of turkey today it was a roman seaport at the time and the working people gathered around the visitors to uh you know learn anything new that they were bringing and they have followed a pattern that was um from the beginning back there of coming together around the apostles teaching for fellowship daily breaking of bread which is in chapter 2 verse 42 and 46 that they came together often on a daily basis to have fellowship to commune you know and brother branham says they actually had communion every day because jesus said this due in remembrance of me and they were serious okay chapter 20 verse 7 if on the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the next day and he continued his speech until midnight imagine that i promise we'll be out before lunch but he preached long to midnight and he's leaving the next day that had a lot to say and so um uh as we've noticed throughout our study paul and his associates always made a point to go to church you know go where the jews were on the sabbath the synagogues these early missionaries took the gospel wherever whenever there was an audience chapter 16 they were down at the river that's where they met lydia remember but here for the first time it mentions that they met to break bread on the first day of the week two important points the early churches were specifically warned against submitting themselves to the bondage of any legalistic observance of the sabbath days cautions 2 16 and galatians 4 9-11 so these early churches voluntarily chose the first day of the week as an appropriate time for fellowship and worship in remembrance of the day that our lord arose okay that's how it started and it's all throughout the gospel and so it was a new day for new people a new creation and the observance of the first day is also in many early writings even to irenaeus messenger to the second church age so here's paul having communion uh having a convenience service with the saints at troas and he's leaving the next day and he's preaching to a very eager whole bunch of disciples had a lot to tell them and he was still preaching at midnight verse 8 and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together now this whole study is designed so that you will go in and read your bible because it's full of details why does that say that well guess what they didn't have these kind of lights these lights don't put off a lot of heat besides we've got a nice air conditioning got soft seats stay awake okay and he's still preaching at midnight and all these torches you know there's a lot of light they produce a lot of heat you know like when you go camping all that fun you have out there when you got a thousand dollar bed at home with air conditioning forget it verse nine and they sat and there was sitting in the window a certain young man named what was just calling bob but i see a few here that could be take his place and he went into a deep sleep didn't know what was going on he was thinking of you know going to the lake and as paul was very long in preaching he sunk down in sleep and what he fell out of the third loft onto the concrete or stones and he's dead what happens now so paul went down and fell upon him and embraced him saying trouble not yourselves there's life in him and we therefore was come up again uh and had broken bread and eaten taking a long while anyway they had church until the sun came up yeah they didn't stop church and and you know this man's raised from the dead normal procedure and they brought the young man alive and they were very comforted okay so that happened in chapter verse 20. so now he's heading up to jerusalem okay he's over troyez and in turkey going to jerusalem for the feast of pentecost which is 50 days after the resurrection and um from the text it looks like they were in a big hurry they stopped at a place called mailitas and sent a messenger to call the elders of the church in ephesus and they came down to the dock and they had you know time with uh with paul so chapter 20 18 30 through 35 is a farewell speech to these believers the church leaders and uh he felt compelled to go to jerusalem even though the saints at every stop urged him not to go fearing for his safety but the hard facts are in chapter 20 and verse 25 let's see here and now behold i know that you all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more now they didn't want to hear that you know they've been warning them don't go there they're going to hurt you and but he's telling i have to go verse 27 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god verse 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost hath made you or seers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood now this is not the way some people are doing it today you know take you know you tell them what i said and you bring the tithings to me and no they're all independent groups see 29. for i know this that after my departing after i leave grievous hungry wolves are going to come in and they're not gonna have any mercy that happens thirty also for your own self of your own selves shall men arise some of you among your own little churches speaking perverse things draw away disciples after themselves i'm the one that's got the truth now paul's gone he gave me the no he didn't therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn every one of you day and night with tears i was here with you in ephesus for three years and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all men which are sanctified i have coveted no man's silver gold clothing nothing yeah yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto you my necessities and to them that were with me i have showed you all things how that so laboring you ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive well that's a little different than some of our people today give me give me give me sit on the porch and wait for the check no it's better to when you give it's more blessed amen yeah continuing and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all just imagine here they are at the port where the boat came they'd come down from ephesus they're kneeling in prayer and they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should seek his face no more and they accompanied him onto the ship it was a sad day but it was part of god's program now look over carefully at second where we are second corinthians chapter four uh let's see what we've got here second corinthians four and um verses three and yeah four and three but if our gospel be hid it is hidden that they are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded their minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine upon them for we preach not ourselves no it's not me when you see me it's god in simplicity yes we don't preach ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ amen so this was their father in the gospel amen and so uh their messenger from god they recognized that and um they actually never saw him again only later they later they received a nice letter from prison in rome the epistle to the ephesians okay so moving right along to chapter 21. nobody's real tired those that aren't tired well they'll hear the recording later okay chapter 21 the sea journey continues so he's coming from troas turkey down trying to get to jerusalem and they came to tyre which is currently lebanon ministered to the saints there for an entire week 21 and four and finding disciples we carried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go to jerusalem same thing all the they said in these other places verse five and when we had it and when we had accomplished these those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us to the ship no way and they they all brought us on our way with wives and children until we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed you know when i read these things it just it brings us so real to us these were real people like you and i they were suffering they had families they love their messenger they're at the sea they're they're they're at the port they're they're over at the shore they're kneeling in the sand they're praying and they knew that they're never going to see him again yeah another final goodbye so verse eight they finally arrived at caesarea they stayed in the home of philip the evangelist we saw him back in chapter six and in verse nine and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy okay and of course this is a fulfillment many fulfillments one of the fulfillments of joel 2 28 your daughters shall prophesy when prophets say something it might not be universal on air everybody no but there's a fulfillment someplace of those words you just got to pay attention you see and these were all in one family verse 10 through 15 and as we carried there many days where at uh caesarea in the house of uh philip evangelist as we turned their many days there came down from judea a certain prophet named agabus okay and when he was come unto us he took paul's girdle you know one of the uh it was his clothing and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews that jerusalem bind the man that owneth the squirtle and shall deliver him unto the hands of the gentiles and when we heard these things both we and they that of that place besought him don't go to jerusalem paul please don't go and paul answered would mean you to weep and to break my heart for i am ready not only to be bound but also to die at jerusalem for the name of jesus christ and when we would not be first when he would not be persuaded we ceased we quit saying you know thy the will of the lord be done and after those days we took up our carriages our baggage and stuff and we went on to jerusalem which today is you know hour and a half journey probably took them a day or two well so so paul is on the way to jerusalem okay he wants to be there for the for the festivities and everybody says don't go but he was god's servant he knew what he was doing first corinthians 2 1 and 2 says uh let's go back over there real quick i'm sure that you should know that by now you don't come to this church without your bible but uh in first corinthians 2 it says here and i brethren when i came among you um i didn't come with excellency of speech i didn't like great knowledge or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determined not to know anything among you only jesus christ and him crucified so after many warnings from good friends very spiritual people even a vindicated prophet not to go because of possible danger paul and his associates arrive at jerusalem and verse 17 they were welcomed very warmly now we're in chapter 21 verse 17 uh they received us gladly okay verse 18. and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders present and as far as we can tell this is the james of matthew 4 21. but there were several people named james in the new testament now this is you know sunday school and there might be a test later so there's james the apostle brother to john son of zebedee matthew 10 2. there's james the apostle son of alphaeus matthew 10 3 also known as james the lesser why because he was shorter than the other james and there's james our lord's brother matthew 13 55 and there's james the father of judas the apostle luke 6 16. so in jerusalem paul meets with the apostles and the church leaders and he tells of the mighty things that was accomplished on his missionary trips now this is the end of his you know he's coming to the end of everything he's been on three missionary trips uh over the period of 30 years traveled maybe 10 000 miles um so they were pleased and glorified god and uh this could have been as late as 56 a.d uh over 20 years after the pentecost and they said now look dear brother we have a situation here in jerusalem you are aware that thousands of jews have believed and um they're they're zealous for the law but they they have been informed they know that you're here you see and so um uh they've been told that you were out there amongst the gentiles and so forth so um that you're out there telling people to forsake prophet moses that was not true and you're telling them not to circumcise your little voice that wasn't true and that they should forget the customs of the law now they know that you're here there was no secrets and they didn't have cell phones no the word gets around so they say to paul now look we have a plan we have four men here willing to take a vow take them with you purify yourselves according to the law you can pay for their haircut and then all people will know that all these other things are false if you do these things showing that you and your guys have four you know you fulfill the law and so in verse 25 answering the same questions providing guidelines for the gentile believers but look at verse 26 it says here then paul took the man and the next day purify themselves and entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that uh an offering should be offered for every one of them okay so they were obeying the law of moses following the advice of the lord's disciples and but once again there was the trend the twin is always close by you can count on it you know and so until the day that you're raptured and that's why we're here today to be rapture ready we're not just here to you know warm up the benches and get the free air conditioning no we're here to get rapture ready okay and so verse 27. and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up the people and grabbed him that said late and when it says laid hands on that wasn't god bless you no that's come with me we've got some things to talk about verse 28 and they were crying out man of israel this is the man that teacheth all men everywhere against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks into the temple and have polluted the holy place making up stuff verse 29 for they had seen before with him in the city of you know atrophymas uh in whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple okay now so here's another religious riot in jerusalem these weren't peaceful times just like now another religious riot in jerusalem great confusion they grabbed paul and they had plans to kill him on the spot this is the man who do away with him finish the problem and they were going to beat him to death yeah verse 31 where's it at here and as they went about to kill him tithings came into the chief captain of the band in other words chief of police that all jerusalem was in an uproar mainly because of a rumor a supposition and meanwhile someone went and reported the activities to the captain the chief of police and so he took a bunch of soldiers and they went down to check out what was going on see so when the writers saw him coming they quit beating paul didn't sound familiar and so the soldiers you know they restrained him put him in chains and asked who he was what's this all about so this is this is the problem guy so we're gonna we're gonna secure you change okay what's going on and so um so the crowds began shouting all kinds of accusations nothing was understood so the captain ordered him take him take him to headquarters so due to the violence of the people the soldiers were carrying paul now he's in custody for his protection they're carrying him and when they were going up the stairs into the building the people were shouting all kinds of things like he should die and so forth without any evidence only supposition all about confusion so we go back to first corinthians chapter 14 because that's when he tells a lot of this story himself first corinthians 14 and verse 33 uh for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints so when you see things that are confusing a that's not a church of the saints that is not god's spirit so put it aside because you know if you're over 10 years old that you can't change anybody they're going to do what they want to do whether it's how they quote the prophet or whatever just leave them alone because we're in a land of equal opportunity everybody's got a bible everybody's got a cell phone entire message is on the cell phone in several languages there's no excuse okay so these people were so blind to their religion uh what they thought to be truth quoting from their prophet and um they were ready to kill anyone who did not see things exactly their narrow way blind fanatics and we got them today carrying spoken word books i know them so they were ready to die and to kill for their view of a god of yesterday totally ignoring what god was doing in present tense and not interested in what may be in the future they were content with forms rituals quoting verbatim but no life and willing to kill anyone with a different view yeah way back then it only got worse okay and so the revealed word was a foreign concept to them all they cared about what did moses say i wish i had a dollar for every time somebody got in trouble uh brother george what did brother brown say about it doesn't matter at this point what brother branham said you guys are so way off the beam that's the least of your problems but very selectively ignoring parts that were not convenient to their views and of course they didn't have an actual recording so it's whatever they heard and they thought they heard okay yeah so god's word is never stagnant okay it's moving on just like here you're getting ready to build a church who would ever thought of that but things move on you know and so uh it is truth that you can depend on heaven and earth all this that you see out here all these forty thousand dollar cars everything's gonna be ashes but the word of god will remain forever my word will never pass away matthew 24 35. but the word of god is living and moving and god will find someone somewhere through whom he can make it come alive you see god has no hands but your hands he has no eyes but your eyes no feet but your feet you see no mouth but yours so we must be totally yielded to him yes lord whatever you say all my stuff is foolish whatever you say got to be yielded completely brother branham was born a seer okay you've heard all that many times he was born a prophet but god could only use him properly when he was totally yielded so you want to say what he says fine i'll say what he says he says i'm just a sinner saved by grace oh we don't want to hear that part we just want to hear the marvelous works and you know but this is him sinner saved by grace use my god because god ordained it before the foundation of the world okay so may god have mercy on us here at the end time what about us each one of us thinks something special amen okay it's time for her see that stops the snoring only thing that makes us special is that god has trusted us to live out our portion of the drama here in the age and the ending of laodicea that's the only thing makes you special you see it's by his grace and we're in the darkest of ages and some of you weren't here the last time i said it but you know brother branham has talked about 1977 for a long time so in 1959 he was preaching in the islands of the caribbean several weeks down there and one of the americans with him had about four hours with him and he reported later he says you know when we were together i asked brother and why do you say so much about 1977 which was 18 years away who cares well brother branson said it's very simple because when i was looking through the stream of time and you can't do that only a prophet and he's seeing numbers and he said by the time i got to 77 it was so dark that i didn't see how any believer could live in such darkness now we're over 40 years on this side it's very dark spiritually okay so may god help us but we are in a very dark age so all the saints of all the past ages are depending on you and me to live out our portion don't worry about luther's mistakes don't worry about what william brown said or didn't say just live your portion right now because the scripture says they without us laodicea are not made perfect so may god have mercy on us okay let's go back to our story 21 37 let's see the holy ghost will put it together for you and as paul was led into the castle and he's on the stairway he said to the chief captain uh can i speak to you and he said oh you can speak greek uh are not you that egyptian which before these days made such an uproar and led people out in the wilderness four thousand men there were murders paul said i am a man of which i am a jew of tarsus city of cilicia citizen of no mean city and i beseech you except suffer me to speak to the people and when he had given him license paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with his hand to the people that when there was you know a great silence and he began to speak to them in the hebrew tongue so he knew at least three languages okay so he begins to speak to the crowd just these people want to kill him it's only the mercy of god that the law you know rescued him now he's going up the stairs and he's speaking to the people okay so what did he look like at this point he didn't look like a preacher he was bloody he was tattered very scroungy looking he quieted the wild religious crowd without a microphone and he began to tell his story it's not lunch time yet chapter 22 verse 1 man and brethren and fathers hear ye my defense which i make and now unto you okay so they're all quiet and when they heard that he spoke hebrew whoa they were very quiet they won't hear what he had to say i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus the city of cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel okay so he's trained in the pharisee religion these are the purest of the moses disciples let's say and this training went on from 14 to 40. it wasn't a two-year course like no no it was a big deal and taught according to the perfect manner of the law and the fathers and was zealous toward god as you all are this day i was just like you zealous for what prophet said and i persecuted where we have verse four and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering unto prison both men and women now see that was one of the biggest miracles back then that this man who was taking people to prison watching him die god appeared to him turned him around now he's the apostle to the gentiles amen so he tells the whole story we'll fast forward to verse 17 and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple the other day i was in a vision and trance and i saw him saying unto me make haste otherwise hurry up get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me now these are direct words from god that he's repeating and i said lord they know that i am prison and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee and those are our family okay and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing there consenting to his death and i kept arraignment of them that slew him so he was he was in agreement he was a pharisee in training he was too young to throw stones but what he saw that day when steve was killed that was stamped in his mind and it never left him verse 21 and um he said unto me depart for i will send thee uh far hence unto the gentiles and they gave him audience unto this word and then they lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it's not fit that he should live he's breathing our air we want him gone and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust in the air more confusion the chief captain commanded him to take him into the castle and that he should be examined by scourging and he might know wherefore they cried against him so he didn't have a clue what this is all about it's a religious matter and they take him in there so he's in jail now the scourge means to harass you all what harassments right severely with no mercy yeah that's what they were doing to him we're going to get the truth out of this character so from chapter 21 paul's in jail for the protection from the religious fanatics and since the jews were so upset with him he must be guilty of something you know these police they're romans they're just keeping order they don't know nothing so in verse 25 and as they bound him with thongs which was leather straps it's like a straightjacket we've got him in a straight jacket we're whipping him with no mercy and so um the chief police does not know who he is and why the people are ready to kill him and this official is a roman officer he's just a public servant he has no revelation no interest in the fanatical religion of the jews but he's responsible for the peace in jerusalem so he has to get to the bottom of the problem 25 part 2. paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned oh we got a problem when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying hey be careful this guy's rolling then the chief captain came and said on him uh tell me are you a roman yes i am and the captain said you know with great some i obtained this freedom and paul said i was born i was born a free man you know then straight away they departed from him left him alone the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was roman and because he had bound him well uh he can't figure this out himself you know and he's got to get to the bottom of the problem somehow and he wants to know the truth of it so he calls together the high priest and his counsel the religious people now this is the sanhedrin i know this is a lot of details when you listen to it later it'll fit together but this is all facts the sanhedrin was the high court of the land okay made up of 71 members divided into three groups there's the chief priests the elders and scribes and they were the religious rulers and they interpreted the law to the people and they made the decisions but they could not issue the death penalty that had to be uh the romans so the high priest presided over the nation's highest administrative judicial body and right below this high priest in rank was an exclusive group of about 200 pure-blooded jews couldn't put a finger on them below these 200 was another 7 000 ordinary priests and all these men could trace their roots all the way back to aaron they had it together and so they were divided into 24 priestly clans and each group served a week at a time in the temple so you get the picture right these people were in charge but under the watchful eye of the romans and only the romans could have entered administered the death penalty so um it just so happens that this is the fifth occasion when these men in this council with all the power were called upon to render an official this decision regarding the claims of christ and his followers okay they wished it would all go away they wish this the whole christian thing would just disappear and we could go on with our life but that's not possible see why because jesus christ was and is the fulfillment of the words of prophets that they these guys claim to follow they knew their prophet's words by memory and here's the fulfillment and they couldn't see it and they want to kill him see so they knew it by the letter of the law and they failed to see the manifestation so when you're reading your scriptures when you're reading your spoken word books keep in mind he said it but there's a manifestation of these things okay it comes to pass okay so they were on the wrong side on the blind side of the issue and they were very good at repeating what their prophet said but zero revelation ready to punish anyone with a different viewpoint especially if there would be some manifestation of the words of the prophet why can't you guys just be normal people not be quoting this you know so this like say this the fifth time the first time they had jesus himself on the stand in luke 22 and he was on his way to calvary to die for us the second time after healing of the lame man at the gate called beautiful peter and john were questioned by the same counsel uh by what power what name have you done this now they weren't upset that the man had never walked nice walking and you know he's a product producing man of the of the city but that name please number three the apostles were having a marvelous meeting manifestations of the power of god okay look at acts chapter 5. it's worth reviewing for just a minute here acts chapter 5 and verse um where are we at verse 12 of 5. and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord and solomon's porch okay verse 16. and there came also a multitude out of the cities around about jerusalem bringing sick folks and so forth and they were healed everyone total deliverance right what happened to verse 17 of chapter five then the high priest the people in charge the one that knew their prophet's words perfectly and all they that were with him which is the sadducees were filled with joy and praise god no they were mad as all get out we got to kill these people yeah verse 18 and they laid their hands on them the apostles and put them in the prison but the angel lord came by that night opened the prison doors and brought them out and said go preach the words of this life god delivers his people you might think god forgot about you he knows exactly where you are and what you're thinking and why you wore that color today he knows all these things okay fourth occasion was the death of deacon stephen and now 20 years after the crucifixion paul is facing the same counsel different individuals of course but the same exact spirit only more corrupt and more arrogant so chapter 22 and verse 30. and on the next day because he would have known the certainty whereof he was accused of the jews in other words he want to know the truth of it he loosed him from his bonds and commanded the chief priest and all the council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them okay so the romans called for a meeting of this powerful council and put brother paul on trial and i don't see any clock here what time you got doesn't matter fine pastor said okay we're gonna we're gonna cover chapter 23 so the scene opens paul is standing before this high council the simon hedren verse 20 verse 1 of chapter 23 and paul earnestly beholding the council said man and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until today okay so his opening statement he uh establishes the foundation honestly i've been honest every day so god knows that you and i are not sinless okay and he calls for us to be honest if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us first john 1 8. so as paul stood before this hostile jewish council religious people the greatest on the planet he could honestly declare that he had a clear conscience okay now honesty and a clear conscience are not the same as perfection paul was by no means perfect but he was totally forgiven and he was honest about his failures as we'll see later so in a total fit of anger and surprise verse 2 and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smack him in the mouth knock his teeth out and all he had said i my conscience is clear and the main guy says smack him wow it's getting serious then paul remembered how brother branham described him hook nose high-tempered sarcastic jew i mean that's in the blood so totally surprised he lost his cool for a moment and in verse 3 god shall smite thee you white at wall who sitteth thou to judge me after the law and command us me to be smitten contrary to the law oh sounds bad verse 4. then one of the one of the flunkies that stood by are you speaking against god's high priest and paul said oh i didn't know he was high priest i'm sorry you know the scripture says thou shalt not speak against the ruler of thy people verse 6 and when paul perceived that one part of the sadducees and the others pharisees he cried out to the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question and when he had thus said there arose a dissension amongst them oh yeah they start arguing and the multitude was divided just like on the streets of america for different reasons for the sadducees say there's no resurrection nor angels nor spirit but the pharisees confessed both so they their doctrine was contrary to one another you know and there are rows of great cry and the scribes that were um let's see and the scribes that were of the pharisees partly arose we're fighting we find no fault in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god and when there arose a great dissension of the chief captain fearing unless paul should have been pulled to pieces he's told the soldiers take him away bring him back to the castle so got a lot of things going on here and the night following the lord stood by paul and said be a good cheer you know and it's tough paul but hey stand steady stay balanced for as thou has testified of me in jerusalem and all he said was that one phrase i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day and it caused all that he said as you have stood for me here in jerusalem so must you bear witness in rome you are going to go to rome and tell the same story yes sir well so god confirming his eternal word because in matthew 28 20 20 28 20 i am with you always even to the end of the world and we're not there yet so when things get tough hey that verse is for you i'm with you always always you know so verse 12 of 23 and when it was day you know sun came up certain of the jews banded together these people are serious and under a curse not under a blessing saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed paul wow 13. and they were more than 40 which made up this conspiracy so here's 40 tough guys saying we're not going to eat we're not going to drink till we get his head off now you try to go from right now until the sun goes down and don't drink or eat and you're going to hurt but they they said we're not going to take nothing till we kill him and they came to the chief priests and elders saying uh we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul so god's elect have been under assault since the garden of eden this isn't anything new and so they simply have a different revelation okay they believe differently and the spirit of arrogance cannot stand it when there's the least bit of opposition in their way of thinking we're right you're wrong that's the only way they can see things so the christians can mostly get along in this world you know we try to get along but the muslims have a totally different way of looking at things very very dangerous now if you make a a circle and you divide it into a thousand parts 999 are muslim and one part is jewish and they can't stand it they want to wipe them out that's how serious it is you see so the bride is not looking to just get along but you know we're not just looking to live out our part of the drama and live honest before god he's going to take us home one day we just want to be honest like paul was here you know according to his promise god will unfold his word on his schedule not ours so don't try to figure it out right when there's things that you don't understand why such as the building of the church or why we got a man with a gun out there just relax everything's okay you take care of yourself don't try to figure it out just be faithful be obedient okay so a long time ago brother branham said and you people with these saw blade tempers oh i'm sure that didn't apply anybody here because hey nice much christians in dallas you people with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth of somebody you can't put up with anything be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother or sister that's not right not to just go around and tear things down you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him kill his influence the scripture says be still in other words zip it i don't need your opinions i'm god i'll take care of things how can you kill people running your mouth without a filter yeah we're guilty in john chapter 12. turn back there a minute john 12 and verse where's it at night verse 9 12. john 9 4 john 12 and 9. much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but they might see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead it just happened but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death so they're not happy that this man is resurrected from the dead and took out of the tomb they want to kill him again because by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus imagine that well and now over here in the book of acts and nearly church they continue under that same evil anointing trying to kill and destroy and it has only gotten worse okay so these 40 plus in verse 12 they were very serious total fast until paul is not breathing let's see how this unfolds verse 14 where are we at here so they came and they asked for you know they told the elders hey we're not going to eat till we kill him verse 15. now therefore ye with the council signified to the chief captain that he should bring him tomorrow as he would like maybe to inquire something more perfectly and um where you know we'll be near him we're ready to kill him so get him out here where we can see him and when paul's sister's son so paul had a sister she's married and so this little nephew heard them that they were you know conspiring he went and told it to the castle he entered into the castle and told paul okay so he went and told uncle paul what's going on and paul called one of the centurions and said ring this boy under the chief captain for he has a certain thing to say to him and so he took him over to the chief captain and i said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man to you he's got something to say to you okay verse 19. then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him uh what has you got to say and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that they will just bring paul tomorrow morning down to the council like maybe ask a few more questions but do not yield unto them for they are lying in weight and there's 40 men and they bound themselves and so forth and they're ready to kill him so the chief captain verse 22 then let the young man go and charge you hey don't tell anybody what you said to me okay so in verse 23 we've got 200 foot soldiers okay not and these aren't little puny guys these are sturdy well fed dudes 200 foot soldiers 70 more on horse and 200 arms spear on foot 470 men verse 23 to take one preacher down to caesarea that's right there in the bible so the chief of police claudius sent a letter along with the soldiers to felix the governor that's in 26-30 they took off in the dark all 470 moving slowly to about 40 miles from jerusalem and they stopped to rest then the next day the 400 returned to headquarters and the 70 on horseback continued with paul to caesarea verse 33. uh they left the horsemen to go with him and return to the castle verse 33 who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor in other words this letter of commendation presented paul also before him and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was oh he's from cilicia he said i will hear thee and when thine accusers shall also come in others make this fair and he commanded him to be kept in herod's judgment hall so it wasn't exactly jail it was uh just a confinement with pleasant surroundings and if you come back tonight we'll cover chapter 24. god bless you we need some good musicians up here if the uh musicians could come brother billy could come you know as brother george was saying that you know a lot of what went through my mind is the statement that brother branham said that there would be another book of acts read off of this message okay i don't know if i want another book of acts right prison jail whooping you know we always look think it's going to be we're going to be empowered with miracles and we're going to go to the hospital and and no there was persecution that came with it there was testing that came with it there was commitment that came with it there was uh the proving of your faith the trying of your faith which is more precious than gold that comes with it you know anything that's not tested doesn't have any value it's the test that gives it the value that that's what makes it what it is because it's tried and true and you know we read the book of acts you know you could almost read it this was the book of the testing of the faith of our fathers it was a book of the testing of the faith of our fathers and what's supposed to be restored to us that's what's supposed to be restored to us the faith of our fathers the children are supposed to come back to that faith well how do we know it's that faith without the test so you can read the book of acts and look at the tests and the trials and the proving and the commitment and everything that's what's got to follow the life and it's like we said last time that we preached i don't know maybe wednesday night i don't know when it was but uh you know the miracles followed the attributes the attributes had to be expressed first that's right you know okay and you can't have a testimony without a test it's it's a boast until it's tested but then after it's proved it becomes a testimony and so when we read about the book of acts as brother george is going through this you know you can it gives you more of an idea of what's really going on in our lives that we're going to be tried we're going to be tested we're going to be singled out but what's also do we see the whole time that through all these tests he never forsook them amen he choose to manifest himself and and even the scripture tells when all men speak uh you know well of you take heed you know but you it just but when you're committed and you've got that revelation you just go forward amen so lord richly bless you uh brother juan where are you i've it are you gonna be baptized this morning do i hear is that right yeah why don't you come over to through this door and and brother andrew was going to help us where are you brother andrew are you could you fit with brother juan and you guys prepare for baptism and and then sister mary are you here somewhere this morning is are you gonna be baptized this morning isn't that wonderful don't you just feel good inside i just feel good inside thinking about it so god bless you i don't know who helps lord you help or someone help and then you can take sister marian and we'll go prepare to be baptized and if you need to go i understand that some have other obligations and so uh we'll dismiss those that want to go at this time and and uh and it's nice to have the sanders family with us this morning pedro good to see you and each one and uh so let us just uh bow our heads here for a moment and as we prepare for baptism and if you have to go we certainly understand it here let us bow our heads this morning as we pray our gracious father lord i just enjoyed this morning lord has all the many details and the understanding of the political climate and and the the great difficulties in the the hist the world that was taking place at that time how the gospel still prevailed and how it still got to each predestinated seed regardless and the trouble and the adversity that the believers were willing to face in order to share with others what god had given
