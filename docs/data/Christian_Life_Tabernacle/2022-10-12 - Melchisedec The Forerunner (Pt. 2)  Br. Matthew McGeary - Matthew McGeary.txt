Description:
Melchisedec: The Forerunner (Pt. 2)
Br. Matthew McGeary
October 12, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Revelations chapter one hey man are you happy to be in the house of God such a wonderful song service and uh once again happy birthday to my mom hey man what a blessing oh my I I try not to take it for granted but I figured that that's just how life is when you when you have something so precious and you never lived life without it you don't know what it's like not to have it but I I thank God for a Godly mother who stood in the gap for me means so much amen we're just reading out of Revelations chapter one we'll read verse four through six also just before we start I believe Brother Richard is here with his wife brother good to have you the Lord uh brought made our past across and um Richards come on and been working with us and uh it's been wonderful to be able to Fellowship around the word and it's nice to have your wife with us as well we pray God be your your portion she's reading out of Revelations chapter one man I need to get there myself Revelations chapter 1 we'll just read verse 4 5 and 6 would read like this John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our own from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen you may have your seats and also if you could just turn in your Bibles we'll also read out of um Hebrews chapter 6 verse 19 and 20. Hebrews in chapter 6 verse 19 and 20. would say which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into that within the Veil whether the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek so just by way of maybe launching out tonight we'll just kind of uh use this as a foundation as we ministered last time to you on Melchizedek the Forerunner if you look into your Bibles in Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18 it would say it would read like this in Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and the prophet of God would say this and who is this Melchizedek he would say notice after the battle was over Melchizedek served his Victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here in type here is in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then is when you partake of Christ become part of this being you get it Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't turn him loose until he blessed him that's right battled for life and after the battle is over then God gives you of himself that is his true communion the little bread and wafer just represents it you shouldn't take it unless you've wrestled it out and become a part of God I wonder have you ever wrestled it out and become a part of God he speaks of uh uh uh Jacob wrestling it out with the angel and he said look I'm not going to let you go until you bless me and I believe that's a place where every Christian ought to come to in their walk with God where they realize there's something inside of them they say oh God there gots to be more there has to be more than what I got there has to be a greater blessing there has to be something more you know I've gone over here and I've heard this way of thinking and I've gone to that church and I've heard that way that it's been preached I've come into contact with this this group over here and and maybe I'll I've come in contact with good people that have been living good life but Lord God there's something inside of me that's crying out I need more and you come to a place where you get so desperate and I believe when a Son of God comes to the place where he's thirsting for life and he's in desperation he's saying oh God there got to be more than this church down the street there got to be more than this experience Lord I Thank you what you've done for a man in my life so far but Lord something inside of me is crying out for more I want to tell you if there's something in your heart that's crying out for more then there gots to be more of God for you or who put that desire in there that is God that's a deep calling to the Deep there's a part of God a seed on the inside of you that's crying out to express itself health oh there's something inside of you it's crying on oh God I want more and when you come to that place where you've wrestled it out you've battled for life has anybody ever been in for a battle in life what I want to tell you it's not just a one-time thing you don't just wrestle it out one day and get up and dust off your hands and say well I got the devil whipped it's all over now you better watch out real quick we gotta stay in the word we got to stay in communion we got to stay listening to the word and listening to the prophet and coming to church and reading our Bibles and staying in prayer because if you watch out something will happen you know the prophet talks about a besetting sin or the devil got to punch coming and you got to keep yourself covered up because as soon as you think you got it all figured out as soon as you say well I got the Holy Ghost and I'm predestinated and I can't fall man and I'm just going to soar around Victorious and nothing can bother me and then you start entertaining the old things you used to entertain you start going back and talking to the same friends you used to talk to you start coming over here and start doing the little things and all of a sudden Something's Gonna Wallop you on the head you're gonna come crashing down you're going to find yourself on the ground and you're gonna start wondering god what happened did I really have an experience was it really real when I went to church and I went through the prayer line and the presence of God came and it delivered me and I claimed I had the Holy Ghost Lord I've been soaring for one week two weeks three weeks five months six months a year Lord but how did I get into this condition again and you wonder why you got knocked down it's because you got away from the very thing that got you up in the sky look we got to stay in the presence of God we got to stay in the word we got to stay feasting upon this message we got to keep listening to the voice of this Prophet oh my what is it it's life he said the words that I speak to you the words that I speak to you they are spirit and they are life and if you keep feeding on that word it's going to keep you it's going to protect you oh praise God I know what I'm talking about have you ever battled out for life and then God what does he do he gives you a part of himself my when you receive a part of himself when you've been baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost and you've been changed you become a new creature all things pass away and now you've entered into a communion where the things of the world don't matter anymore it's not a struggle you're not you're not trying to to run out and do the worldly things you're not just you're not in a in a in a battle where you're like oh my I'm nervous I'm going to give in tonight I don't want to give in to get friends that's that's not Liberty the Bible says where the spirit of Lord there is Liberty I remember when I got converted and I was down there parking cars in Dallas it had been two days serving God but I'll tell you what the way God got a hold of me praise God I God knew what I needed he transformed my life and a snap of a fingers and God can do that he can take whatever situation whatever battle whatever condition whatever sickness I line it up I don't care what it is I serve a God he's the mighty conqueror he can take care of any problem any situation any disease any sickness any bondage come on somebody knows what I'm talking about you've been in a situation where it was impossible but the one who works all things out for your good praise His Wonderful Name where it was impossible the one who nothing is impossible to came by your way and he'll change you he'll give you a part of himself oh I remember God converted me and and it was a couple days there I was I was down parking cars and my lunch break came up I'm like hey oh well that's where I'm working is right next to a pub I'm gonna go have a beer so I got about five steps I started walking away oh that's so funny I don't even drink anymore and I was happy and excited I didn't get down like oh man Christians don't drink Boomer what am I gonna do with my time now sir no you broke through into another sphere you broke through into another world you broke through the carnal Realms you've entered into the spiritual realm where old things have passed away come on I'm preaching the Bible to you it says old things pass away and All Things become new I'm talking about the Battle of life where you've battled it out and you've come to a place of change where the old Nature has passed away and All Things become new now you're in communion nothing like it so just here in just starting our text here just reading Melchizedek was the high priest or the priest of the most high God and I found it interesting thank you you know the the when when you read this out of Genesis you know the the word priest has never been used in scripture before Here Comes this one coming to Abraham to serve him uh bread and wine and communion in in scripture there's no communion there's no bread there's no wine these that these things haven't even been instituted and here I I'm the priest of the most high God there's no levitical law there's no priesthood there's nothing in the scriptures to even mention a priesthood and here comes this one Melchizedek who is the priest of the most high God and so you look into the scripture where did this come from and you start to walk it down you start the what is a priest a priest is somebody who's authorized to carry out the the religious duties in the house of God you look into the levitical law and and that priest and the high priest and the priest had the showbread and and they were keeping the lamps and and uh aligning the incense on the Altar and then once a year what would the high priest do he would come in behind the veil and then he would take uh the blood from the heifer and he would sprinkle the mercy see and he would come in and that was the order of of of the the priesthood under under the aeronic law but here we look into the scripture here come this one he was the priest of the most high God and if you jump into Hebrews chapter 7 verse 11. it says if therefore Perfection we're by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek now I can't preach it or say it any better than the prophet Paul preached it you follow this clear if therefore Perfection were under we're by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron by God's grace we'll get down uh to our day where we're living at for the priesthood being changed there is made a necessity change also of the law because it was the law that the priest operated by without the law without the air without the the law that Moses had given to Aaron and to the priest then there was nothing for though religious duties for the priest to carry out and what he's pointing out then so then if there's been a change if we've now come under the order of Melchizedek then the law has also changed there has to be another word or there has to be another law that we're living under and and Paul would say this in Romans 8 verse 2 he would say for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of sin and death that that's what those statutes were that's what those laws were it was a law of sin and death it was a bunch of do's and don'ts and and he's made us free from the law sin of death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh oh praise God I don't know about you I'm weak in this thing I have no ability to live the word of God in this thing and if any of you think that you have the ability to manifest the word of God and you think that you can come to some religious conception and understanding and fulfill the word of God I want to tell you if you can do anything to Grant salvation for yourself then what did the prophet of God tell you then Christ died in vain if there's anything man can do to Warrant salvation if there was any good work if there was any good word if there was anything you could do that would make you good enough for salvation then Christ died in vain now let God speak to you because the devil wants to condemn you he wants to try to tell you your life is not lining up he wants to point to all your faults and all your failures but we're not under the aaronic law I'm not under the law of sin and death I have come under a new order now I am under the order of Melchizedek this is a spiritual priesthood I have a high priest who can be touched by the feeling of mine infirmity in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son and the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in US who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit praise be to God when you've battled for life and you've battled it out and you've died to your ways of thinking and your ways of doing things and you've come to a place of desperation or you finally come to a place many times you deal with people they come through a prayer line over and over and and you deal with people who who are going through Cycles over and over and they and you realize you know they've just never got to a place where they've truly surrendered they say they've surrendered Lord I'll do whatever it takes but then they hang on to all those things they know they shouldn't be doing they hang on to those little apps and those little it's the little foxes that spoil the vine you don't think those things make a difference you think you can handle it look I love the scripture where Jesus said I sanctify myself for their sake it struck me one day I was like what did Jesus have to sanctify himself for no Jesus the prophet of God said Jesus how to write to a home he had a right to he could have done all those things he could have been like any of us but he Sanctified himself for your sake he Sanctified himself for those disciples sake because they were going to take this gospel to the world well then if Christ is living in US if Christ is living in you well you're saying well I can handle it I can watch this little show I can watch this little movie you know it's not going to bother me I'll just get a few I won't tell everybody in the church that I'm going to the movie house but you know it'll just be me and another friend and we'll go down there because you know it doesn't bother me it doesn't affect me it's not going to take me away I'll still come to church I'll still come do those things you know I'll listen to a little music you know I know it's in the gray area and it's a little rocked up and it's a little Rocky and everything and and it's called Christian music even though it sounds you know if you can't hear the words you don't know if it's the number one hit in the Rock world or if it's a number one Christian hit you don't know what it is but look I'm telling you if you luck Devils start to blend lines he'll use those things to pull you out from behind the protection of the word and then all of a sudden you'll get that Haymaker coming you'll fall flat on your face and you'll say how did I ever get here and people go through a cycle over and over and over again I wonder is it as they ever really come to a place for a battle of life look if you've ever gotten desperation is there somebody here that's ever got into desperation where you flip over every leaf you flip over every rock you say God come into my heart search it out to God search me oh God try me fine if there's any wicked way in me Lord I Want to Be Right Lord I don't want to miss it I need more Revelation Lord I got to have more of you Lord if there's something in my life that's not pleasing to you Lord please reveal it because I want to have communion with you see we go through Seasons we go through valleys we go through look we when you're on the Mountaintop boy it's easy but when you get down into the valley and what did they say you know if you stay up on the on the Mountaintop your fruit are free so you got to come down in the valley really test to see what if you really got something you know because you go through the trials and you go through the hard times and if you've ever really truly battled it out let the storms come Let The Trials come you know where you're standing but you see when you when you've accepted some Creed or you've accepted some died or you've accepted some experience and it hasn't been a reality of a change and and you're pointing back to an experience but you realize you're still having little foxes that spoil a Vine you'll come up to a trial in your life and you'll find out you don't got the goods but don't don't let the devil continue for that that's the grace of God showing you that there's more for you that's what the devil wants to do he just wants to say oh look you fell down you fell to that again you went to that website again and you fell down and then what does he want to do he wants to hold you in a state of condemnation and keep you from coming back to the house of God look the best place you can come when you fall flat on your face is come back into the house of God say oh God feed me Lord Jesus Wash Me by the water of the word Lord I need to be cleansed I need to be washed Lord I need to come into your presence Lord build me back up Lord start to build me back into the statue of a perfect man Lord I've fallen I fail Lord I got iniquities I got sin but oh God I'm pleading the blood of Jesus Christ we got to be quick to repent but the devil wants to hold you there in a state of condemnation I want to keep you from coming to the house of God but we want to walk after the spirit we don't want to walk after the ways of the flesh I like this quote here this is what we're launching from the prophet of God would say this in Melchizedek the great king the great Prince and King he says wither the Forerunner now we're speaking of Hebrews 6 20 here he says wither the Forerunner for us is entered even Jesus the Forerunner of what so what is Jesus the Forerunner the Forerunner of our Salvation physically and spiritually for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised fire iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the Forerunner of our Salvation has already entered in the Assurance already entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek now I just got a little bit excited when we started to Fellowship along these things last time when you start to look up in the scriptures you know that this is the only time in scripture the word Forerunner is mentioned now we know that John was a forerunner and God promised Malachi 4 to 5 to be a forerunner again before the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but we're just dealing with the word Forerunner would you take it back to the Greek in the scriptures it's only used one time and it's here that it's used in Hebrews 6 20 and if you look up that word you take it back to the Hebrew of the Greek whatever you take them it's only used one time and if you find another time please help me but what I found out is there's a definition on that word as a forerunner it says one who was sent before to take observation or act out as a spy or a scout boy that was enlightening to think of what God had done with those uh uh with the children of Israel when they came down to cadish barnia and it came time for them to enter into the promised land they came to a place of decision and what did the prophet do Moses he sent over 12 Spies they went over as a forerunner if you will Joshua went on over into the promised land and when they came back Joshua and Caleb gave a good report you know why because that was their land I thought about it when they came back packing all those fruits that was their fruits but those other ten spies who brought an evil report they didn't have faith to take the land so then Joshua was a forerunner that went over and said hey I want to tell you guys something it's a good land this Holy Ghost Gospel believing life this word of God this message it's a good land I'm telling you you want to come on over there well there's Giants in the land there's a lot of problems there's a lot of Heartache people have labeled that occult people have labeled that a hate message they've labeled it all these kind of things well I don't know what other people's called it but look at the grapes look at the fruit of the land look there people are being healed the dead are being raised blind eyes are being opened all the thoughts on the thoughts and the tents of the heart oh they're being discerned why don't you come on over come on over to the promised land where everybody else gave an evil report but I wonder about you when I heard the message when I heard that Scout tried to stop to tell me it was Discerning the thoughts and intents of my something inside him he said it's a good land it's a good land I want to go on over I want to take the land yeah but you find out the rest of the people didn't want to fight for it but I wonder are we willing to fight for it are you willing to fight for the message are you willing to fight for the Lord Jesus Christ are you willing to fight for your salvation are you willing to fight for your family are you willing to fight for your brothers and sisters are you willing to fight to get to the house of God you find out when you fight to get to the house of God you get a good blessing oh I tell you what I remember one time you know because we might get to the scripture but you know the scripture just tells you that you offer yourself a Living Sacrifice which is your reasonable service you don't get a star you don't get a cookie it's a reasonable service you don't need to Pat me on the back you don't need to say brother Matthew good job you made it to church brother Matthew you made it back on Sunday night brother Matthew made it Wednesday night brother Matthew made it to prayer you don't need to you don't need to lift me up and pack me up I've been lifted up Hallelujah I've been lifted up now I like it tell me I ain't gonna lie I love it when people compliment me and they they lift you up and they keep all kind of Praise but I've been lifted up by somebody else I've been lifted up by my Lord Jesus Christ who's pulled me up out of the mucking Meyer he set me upon the Strong Rock of Revelation that'll never pass away it's my reasonable service I want to serve them I want to love them I want to come to church it's my reasonable service so I say Amen to the word I don't mean to be need to be applauded employed for for doing what my reasonable Services I remember one time just going about my reasonable service I got in the car and it's when I was living in Arizona and we had a friend riding it with us and me and Gabrielle jumped in the car the friend was with us we pulled up the gas station clip the curb caught a flat tire man we love to get to church we would always get it was an hour and a half drive down the church and we got there 45 minutes early three years straight did it every time Sunday Wednesday didn't miss why because I was going to be there for my blessing I like to be in the house of God look I look at least I'm hey if I'm gonna go to a ball game I want front row seat that's just the way I am give me courtside get get me 50-yard line I want to be in the action don't don't put me don't put me don't put me at the restaurant looking at the screen if I got tickets on game seven I want to be there you ain't gonna sell me short if the doors of the house of God are all but I want to be there so man clip my tire tire went flat so man we jumped out it was it was awesome wait me and Kyle we didn't because we worked together we didn't say nothing about it I needed gas and and I was able to make it to the gas pump so I jumped out ran in real side while I'm swiping my car Kyle's popping the the the trunk flipping out the tire I'm running back he tosses me the wrench I'm breaking the lug nuts off I pull off the tire he slaps the run on he goes and throws that in the truck I slap it back on the guy and the the guy and the the the the the the gas station comes out like are y'all Nascar or something gotta get to church hop in the car down the road I go get about five miles down the road and also my spare blows out oh my my goodness now now now we're really having it I said okay I called the mechanic this is where we at well my spare I put the spare on it went bad what can we do I'll bring you a vehicle how far out you okay come on come on so we're bombing down the hill and it's like man you know we're gonna we're gonna be there late how late we gonna be well yeah by the time we get down there it looks like service is going to be close to ending so I got into church guess what there was 10 minutes left of preaching you want to know who that 10 minutes left of preaching was for I had a faith in me to believe that that 10 minutes was for me I tell you if you come with an expectation of the house of God you say oh God if I get 10 minutes that 10 minutes for me if I get 30 minutes that 30 minutes with me I've come to be in the presence of God and Lord you said we're two or three you're gathered in my name you are in the midst of God take the fivefold take the pastor take the Evangelist take the men of God and speak the word to my heart I want to be in communion with you We Made It by his grace and I do it again because I want to be in the house of God if anything just to show the devil whose side I'm on I don't like to be called you know I can't I can't think of it I I try to go back and think of of the times but you know even after surgeries and certain things and some people have found me you know I I might not have been in condition to be here but I wanted to be here people are you okay I'm here I'm here might be all on something from the doctor getting out of surgery but something inside of my heart wants to be in communion something in my heart wants to be in the house of God so just fellowshipping along this lines on this Forerunner think about this now here's the definition I want to get to it says a forerunner is one who comes in advance to a place where the rest are to follow now that just makes me happy because Jesus Christ Melchizedek the Forerunner has come to a place where the rest are to follow so you know he cannot be a forerunner if nobody is coming after him that what makes him a forerunner because he's showing up to a place he's showing up to a position he's coming to a place of maturity or manifestation and he's declaring I am the Forerunner I have now come to a place and now I got a whole family that's following after me they're coming just watch out they're coming and that's what Paul would say here just moving along in the scriptures think about this now Romans 8 29 I know we're familiar with it but he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren now he's the firstborn among many Brethren because he foreknew you because he predestinated you to become the same thing that he is to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ the Forerunner the first fruits of them that slept what does the scripture go on to say moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified look the Forerunner of our salvation physically and spiritually this isn't Up For Debate this isn't a question uh am I gonna make it this isn't a question well he justified me will my life ever become Satan no he's the Forerunner he made the way for you he he purchased your salvation he foreknew you and he predestinated you and those he foreknew he called you he Sanctified you he justified you and he said and I have already glorified them this ain't Up For Debate you're not sitting around and wondering am I ever going to make it I think I can I think I can look you ain't The Little Engine That Could I think I can I think I can I think no I just can't do I think I can I think I can and you're just thinking you can do it no this goes Way Beyond some mental conception this goes beyond something that you could think of this comes Beyond something that you can try to Manifest this is something the Forerunner Melchizedek Jesus Christ has already entered in he's already made a way for you he's predestinated you he Sanctified you he's Justified you he's already glorified you it's not up to debate this is something that God has already done yeah we'll just whip the devil with that thing come on I'm tired I'm tired of the devil trying to rob us of our joy trying to rob us of our peace trying to rob us of the gifts of God in our land I'm tired of the devil trying to tell me I'm not gonna I'm tired of the devil trying to point out my pet I'm tired of the devil trying to take my joy I'm tired of them trying to take my victory well then why don't you do something about it God's already done everything he's ever going to do for you all he wants to do is get a son or daughter of God to believe in what he did believe in what he said if you just start believing what he said about you this ain't the words of a man this is what God said about you and then we let the devil just whip us up with passion failures and faults and what happened yesterday and how you ever going to get through this trial and and the reason your family's battling this sickness is because there's sin in your life and he starts to put little lies into your heart and say well the people in the church they're looking at you a little funny and they think it's because the way you handled this and it's the way you did that and you know that that's that's the way that's the reason why your your life is the way it is is because you're suffering for your iniquities oh the devil shrewd if he could ever accomplish anything he would want to cause division in this church he would try to pitch you against the pastor he'd try to pitch you against your brother he'd want the so little some little white liar or or I you know it sounds funny but you know people are offended over hands not getting shook they get offended over where they're sat in the church they get offended over parking spots they get offended over not being invited over for dinner they get offended over everything now I'm not trying to belittle that because people have really gone through battles and heartaches because of those things and I'm just trying to say that the devil would want to use that to cause a division but I tell you we ought to look around and we ought to show the Christian character of love and look out and extend the hand of fellowship if you notice somebody ain't befriending you like they used to why don't you go up to say hey I just wanted to make sure is there something that I've done to offend you and if there is I want to make it right or are we too prideful are we too scared to go on that auction how many times has God put an unction on your heart to make a phone call or go up to somebody and you shun the holy unction and come down the road later and you find out you wish you'd have been obedient to that only option the first time now I want to be a mature church I want to be a mature Son of God I want to be a church that comes together in unity and we put out all the nonsense that we can come together and be United for a rapture he's made a way he's made a way for us just thinking along those lines look Moses Moses didn't think he could do it but I love that sermon perfect strength and perfect weakness God told Moses look at Moses I don't need your excuses and I don't need your abilities yeah he hit it from both sides Moses when you try with your abilities you produce a dead Egyptian when you try with all your intellect and all your doctrines and all your methods and you just thought you were going to be able to bring the plan of God into manifestation on your own without consulting me and you just thought you'd rise up to nope that's not how it works I'll take you out on the back side of the desert and it lets you get to a place where I've taken all of your intellectual knowledge out I've taken away your human ability all your strength and all your I think I can I think I can he'll take it all out and get you to a place where you're hurting sheep on the back side of the desert and all of a sudden you'll something will catch your attention and you get something in your heart you've been looking for something all your life and all of a sudden you come in the presence of something what is it Moses what is it it's God calling your name it's God calling you and they say look Moses you can't do it on your own yes you were born a proper child yes you are a deliverer but you're not going to serve me with your strength you're not going to serve me with your intellect you're not going to serve me with your ability you're going to serve me based upon my word oh I'm happy for it I'm I I I I've made a way for you Moses I am the I am take off your shoes where you're standing Holy Ground Moses oh but God I I I can't go down there and deliver the children of Israel I'm past my Prime I'm past any abilities I I forgot all of our war plans I forgot all the gates of the city I forgot where they kept the secret weapons my mind's failing me now I can't even re-quote the Bible I can't uh pull scriptures like I used to pull them I can't pull quotes and Page books uh like that Moses I don't need that I don't need your eye I can't speak it right I stutter when I talk Moses I don't I don't need your excuses I don't need your excuses and I don't need your abilities all I need you to do is take me at my word so here comes a man down to Egypt and I tell you what oh we've heard it dramatized several times Here Comes This old man with hair down to his waist with a stick riding on a donkey Here Comes his wife he's coming down to the most Mighty greatest nation on the face of the Earth and he's going to come up to pharaoh and say let my people go well we know one spear one bow and arrow one hammer would have just ended that whole thing intellectually but Moses had the saith the Lord that means nothing nothing could stop Moses from coming back to that mountain because look he said you will worship me back here at this mountain so Moses knew if God told me that he predested me if God told me he Sanctified my life if God glorify me then there's nothing that's going to stop me from entering in will Melchizedek has already gone where the Forerunner has already entered then I have to come with him Moses knew I'm going back there John 15 16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he will give it to you ye have not chosen me but I've chosen you he's made a way for your healing thank you he's made a way for your deliverance what's your problem what are you facing okay you're battling depression he made a way for you you don't have to stay in that condition anymore he's made a way for he chose you he elected you that anxiety that's been all over your life you don't have to live like that anymore that fear that's been chasing you around sister all your life and you've been trying to get away from it I'm telling you in the name of the Lord you don't have to live like that anymore because he's made a way for you you can receive Deliverance in the name of God why don't you stand up and claim it all his word is sharp it's powerful it's a discerner of the thoughts and intensifies you can have what you have need of tonight he's here in this moment he's here one of them need him why don't you pull on the word of God he knows what you're battling he knows what you're facing he made a way for you Deliverance is here for you why I'm Melchizedek I'm the Forerunner I'm the Waymaker I'm the Trailblazer I've entered in behind the veil I've done what no other man can do I took your sins I took him to Calvary I nailed him to the cross I went to hell I rose on the third day and I left captivity captain and I'ma send it up on high to sit down at the right hand of God Oh Glory to God hallelujah talk about a forerunner he's made a way for you Oh Praise His wonderful name we spoke about the woman at the well her situation was unfixable an unfixable situation where there was no way Jesus Christ Made A Way where there was no way no man no Priest No Church no Doctrine no Creed no doctor nobody on the face of the planet could have fixed the woman at the Wells condition she was an outcast she couldn't even have fellowship with the people in the town because of the way she lived but there came a man one day he come on down to the well said give me a drink oh you know it's not customary for you to talk to me at somebody else oh if you knew if you knew who you were talking to you would ask me for a drink because guys I'll give you a Living Waters you'll never thirst it again don't give me them Waters that's what happened just like Moses on the backside of the desert he came into the presence of the I am what did that what did that woman at the well did she came in the presence of the I am who was it it was Melchizedek the same one that Abraham came into the presence of oh my god with Abraham when it came time they were well stricken in age there was no way for them to bring forth the promise who came to the tindor Melchizedek came to the tent door and what did he say oh Abraham where is your wife wasn't even looking for Abraham why because it's time now according to the appointed time you're going to have that promise that I gave you what was it it was Melchizedek he's the Waymaker he spoke a word in that word has to come into manifestation well why don't we talk about faith a little bit you got a little bit of faith you got a little bit of faith for salvation why don't you take all the word take all the promises of God prophet of God would say this and who's this Melchizedek God vindicates that that's always been right God vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption now we're talking about where you came from we're talking about that you're predestinated you're talking about you've been ordained God vindicates it to be true so plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like they think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back now I take that Faith we're talking about and believe this for yourself Devil's gonna try to rob you right here you tell that Old Devil to shut up you're predestinated you are Redemption people might be like uh like think they are but real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right the redeem is sent to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place the prophet says hallelujah Hallelujah hey he's talking about me you're telling me Prophet when I showed up here and this sinful flesh that this wasn't my first existence no it's to bring to its original Place Hallelujah so it's only the predestinated that will be brought back because the others didn't come from there see bring back be an eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thoughts of you was only he he wanted me to stand listen to this now I can't do it justice but why don't you grab a hold of it being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted you to he wanted me to stand in the Pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the Earth to serve his purpose is that right all right then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified State it's matured and brought back again don't you realize that you are the spoken word seed of God that has stepped out of Eternity you've been sold into lady osia that you might come through a maturing process and go right back to where you came from oh that's Redemption Hallelujah that's why I get excited I've been predestinated Redemption means to be brought back where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you job there is a resurrection though the skin worms eat my flesh yeah in my flesh I shall see my redeemer My Redeemer the one to redeem and bring me back to where I was in the beginning oh then you can stand there in the trial and say let hell rage Let The Trials come let the devil roar oh the sickness come the heart it come but I know in whom I have believed him and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him unto that day oh what a redeemer Hallelujah don't let the devil rob you you're going to finish this race you're predestinated to finish that's what Redemption is that's what it's all about is to bring you back to where you were in the beginning now I love our Prophet you know that Spirit of Elijah always taken nature and making a type I'm so glad it's it's hit from the wise and prudent revealed and debate such as would learn Prophet will start talking about a dew drop start saying you know it's like a little Dew Drop you know a little do in the morning you know before the sun comes up it's just laying there cold laying there in a dark situation and just through the night air it's cold and it's just laying there and it's quivering it's cold but he said you know what watch what happens when the sun comes up to that morning dew and all of the sun rises up there and the sun rays start to hit that little Dew Drop all of a sudden that that Dew Drop he says it starts to smile it starts to get excited it starts to shake a little bit it starts to Rejoice a little bit say what you getting excited about Dew Drop well what am I getting excited about the Sun is up it's the rising of the sun I've heard from my theophany I see it's the Lord Jesus Christ I've been introduced Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world what are you getting excited about Dew Drop I know that I'm going back to where I came from because the Sun is up and it's quicker than me I'm laying in the presence of the sun it's ripening me it's taking all the dross out it's taking me through a maturing process and soon and very soon I'm going to be changed and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm gonna be gone all your trials will be over all your heartache will be over all you're wondering and all your fretting gone oh I can't wait I'm excited about it where what you're waiting for are you gonna wait for that day to get excited no I'm going to be like that little Dew Drop I'ma start screaming and shouting now I'm gonna start telling people look I've been redeemed but with a price Jesus has redeemed my whole life I am redeemed what are you talking about well redeemed means to be brought back he predestinated me and to be predestinated to me it's you be you're redeemed and redeemed means he's taken me back to Eternity where I was with him in the beginning well friend that sounds fanatical yep Hallelujah Hallelujah I know it sounds fanatical you know Moses looked pretty fanatical there was ever a nut on the earth it was Moses you imagine you imagine going up to the White House and knocking on the doors said I'm going to be president foreign you'd be talking to four walls three walls and a jail cell but if he had thus saith the Lord be nothing this government could do to stop you and I tell you it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to recognize when what Christ has done in this generation just as the logos out of that burning bush spoke to Moses God took that vessel and he apprehended that vessel and he put his words and that vessel to speak his word to the people that is none other than what we have received in this generation my Divine promise God said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man that God would send a prophet like in the Moses that would come and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart who is this Melchizedek the prophet of God would say this speaking of that Dew Drop he said and that's the way with a Christian Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back again by the power that's pulling us look there's a power pulling you you might not know it but there's a power on your life you should have been dead you shouldn't be here you should have been gone a long time ago but something's keeping you something's holding you something's pulling you when the devil wanted to Snuff you out when drugs wanted to take you out with that life you were living want to take you out when you almost got killed on the job and it was going to take you out there was a power over your life there was something pulling you in the manifestation that said look I'm not done with them I got a result I'm looking for I'm going to keep them from this I'm going to keep them from that why because I want to see my very image inside of him and when he serves his purpose then I'll take him home something is pulling you well you might as well just surrender to it maybe that's the problem with somebody here you wonder what's wrong with your life is you have not fully surrendered to the power of God that's been pulling on your heart you've never come to a complete surrender you've come around the message you've come around the things of the message something your heart knows it's right but you got one foot in and one foot out it's time look at the time it's over the time of playing church is over we're on the ark and we're preaching through the window I believe the door's open look we're in the third pool now the third pull is what to the eternally lost and to the bride we've come into the third pool we've entered into the eye but we're preaching to souls that are eternally lost but I praise God the door's still open but it could be tonight it could be tomorrow well it's this time to have a battle of life it's time to battle it out if you got loved ones get them in get them in think about Rahab get them in get them in under the token get them under and under this word I don't know if I finished that quote there's a power of God that's pulling us the little Dew Drop he glistens and shines and shouts because he knows he come from up there and that son is going to draw him right back up again and a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows Hallelujah when he come in contact with the Son of God he is going to be drawn up from yet from here someday for if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me amen oh what shall we say to these things if God before us what shall we say if he's predestinated you come on now if he's done all these things what shall we say to these things if God before you then who can be against you nothing can stop you nothing can pluck you out of his hand all the father has given me will come I was thinking about that you know you start to think about the the uh Patriarchs in the Bible Abraham no chance Sarah no chance Moses no chance they had received a promise that in themselves could never manifest but was it by faith by faith by faith by faith Abraham by faith Sarah by faith Moses by faith Enoch by faith Abel by faith Joshua by faith well you know how you're going to do it by faith by faith and then how does faith come faith comes by hearing the word so then God had to send a word to produce the faith to make you an overcomer and the prophet of God said it takes a perfect Faith or more faith than we've had in any other age to go into a Rapture then he had to send a word that would produce rapturing faith and that's what we're feeding on we're feeding on a word that's producing a faith to change our bodies it looks impossible Sarah it looks impossible Abraham it looks impossible Moses it looks impossible but by faith I have heard from Melchizedek has given me a promise it said according to the time of life you shall have a body change Oh Glory to God I'm glad I'm caught right now in the Rapture cycle of the change of my body you say brother Matthew I can't see anything no well Melchizedek he is the Forerunner of me both spiritually and physically and I tell you right now glory to God spiritually I'm seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh we are a life of his life and power of his power and soon and very soon this whole body this flesh body that my Forerunner was a forerunner for both physically and spiritually for my healing and for Divine Healing which Divine Healing is just a type of our body change and soon and very soon we're going to be changed Oh Glory to God it might sound like a mystery it might sound like a fairy tale but by faith I know that I know because it's the Sixth Sense it defies the natural senses it defies what I can see touch tasty or smell it defies my reason conscious memory affection it defies all those things because faith is more real than the reality you're looking at with your very own eyes you say what are you talking about look at Moses it made no sense for him to go down to Egypt but God had ordained him to do it and God has ordained a pride in the evening time to go into rapture wherefore sin we are compassionate about with such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight we'll try to work towards her clothes I'll just ask maybe we can sing that song again if Brother Joseph can come to the piano and I'll call for the singers here in just a moment wherefore seeing we are also compassed with such a greater cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight church is time to lay aside every weight it's time to lay aside your complexes time to lay aside your doubt time to lay aside your unbelief I tell you one person you want to want somebody I'm I'm really lately I've gotten a little tired with I'm gonna call his name out his name is Mr skeptic I really don't like that guy because he's skeptical of every promise of God he's skeptical of the message when the man of God gets up and preaches you know the message you know there's there's a preacher gives his title and he he starts to bring it well either this is ordained of God or it's not either the fightful ministry is of God or or it's not you know that Mr skeptic wants to sit there well you know I mean it's really it really not about that that's not the way it is and he starts to run his mouth you know why don't you give all Mr skeptic the word test when people try to speak against the world why do you give it the Bible test give it the word test say okay let me take it back and see what the word says it says oh therefore is there now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin he who is born of God cannot commit sin because the seed remaineth in him whose seed is it it ain't your seed it's a predestinated seed that God placed inside of you because you're part of redemption and Redemption means to bring back to where you were in the first place Glory to God why don't you shut yourself your mouth Mr skeptic I am the redeemed purchase bride of Jesus Christ I am going back to where I came from I am part of the Redemption story he shed his blood for me on calorie he prayed us today to me he placed his seed inside of me and soon and very soon I'm gonna be gone why don't we lay aside every weight that so easily besets us and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross what a forerunner despising the shame and is set down on the right hand of God on the right hand of the Throne of God looking under Jesus what does it say looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith so then if it was by faith Enoch walked with God and was not who authored that story well I'm about to get excited who authored that story Enoch didn't author that story you think Moses sat around one day and drafted up that story that wasn't Moses's idea Abraham wasn't sitting around one day and he wrote a pretty little story today Sarah what do you think about this we're going to get really old and stricken in age no that was God's story that was what God wanted to bring forth God was the author of that story but I want to tell you he is the finisher I want to tell you church God is going to finish what he started you might feel like you ain't going to finish but you ordained to finish this thing why because he's the author and he's the finisher he who begun the good work in you he is faithful he will finish it why because he's not only the author of your life glory to God he is the finisher of your life he's the author and finisher of your faith and faith is a gift of God lest any man should boast oh my if you got faith on the inside of you you got a pile of God praise His wonderful name he's the one that started this is the one that's the same one come on the same one who offered Moses story The I am he said I started it Moses I'm going to bring you out of Egypt I told Abraham I told him I'd bring him out what did he do he got him to the Red Sea everybody started crying is that what we do we come to an obstacle we come to a place in our life we come to a trial we come to a situation it seems like there's no way out it seems like there's no way around it and what do we do do we start to murmur and complain and say oh God what did you do did you bring us out here in the wilderness to die would it have been better for us to stay back and Egypt would have been better to stay back in the Sin of our flesh would have been better to stay back in denominations no who brought you to the Red Sea who brought you out of Egypt well the same one that brought you out of Egypt is the same one that brings you to the Red Sea who is it that feeds you a man in the wilderness who is the water from the rock who is the one that brings you across Jordan it's the author and the finisher of your faith the one that started it he will finish it but that's his wonderful name for if you can start playing that brother clever if you could come help me and Brianna I am the one that called you I am the one that elected you you didn't choose me I chose you no doubt Abraham and Sarah were wondering Lord when's the promise ever going to come to pass Lord I believe you gave me a promise Lord [Music] I believe I don't need to go through prayer lines anymore I don't even need to have hands laid on me anymore because I've received your promise and I know beyond a shadow of an out God you gave me the promise but Lord when are these things gonna be and all of a sudden that same one that served Abraham Bread and Wine after the battle showed up there at the tent door there he is Sarah that's him come down started to worship Him called him Lord so where's your wife [Music] I made you a promise Abraham and I intend to keep it and even while Sarah was in a condition to not believe it didn't change what God had promised [Music] oh how was it in the condition to believe this message I wasn't in a condition to come into His presence I wasn't a good candidate to preach the gospel but what I was yet in sin Christ died for me because it wasn't about what I could do it was all about what he had done and if I could just now look at my problems and look at my past and realize Melchizedek has come in the evening time then where is my bride [Music] I don't care about your past I don't care about your family situation [Music] according to the time of life you're going to bring forth the promised son and even though Sarah laughed and said how could these things be she was predestinated [Music] and the scripture would say by faith Sarah receive strength to conceive God has sent a word [Music] to produce a faith for you to conceive the message of the hour and bring forth the full manifestation of the word all the way through the Rapture cycle until we behold him in the meeting of the air well it sounds crazy brother Matthew it sounded crazy that an old man and an old woman's body would be changed to bring

there's such a cry for the church to get their lives right and to take on the the position and the promises that God has given them because there's promise to work that there would be a short quick powerful work in the hearts and the lives of God's elect and there's no other voice to this generation left but your voice there's no other light to this generation but your light [Music] how to experience today that move me deep inside started out this morning with a phone call from a woman that's got to go to Court and address the court in the sentencing of the person that murdered her daughter [Music] that I I want to forgive them but I don't know how [Music] and I thought as Matthew preached tonight [Music] it's all her heart's desire is foreign she's come back to God through it all that stuck with me in my heart and I went by [Music] to brother Tim seather's work today and he began to talk to me about the that work that the bride was gonna do how he said it wouldn't be a public show it would be something that just come out from the hearts of the believer I meditated it I walked in just sitting in the yard today and I just felt compelled to drive to this supply house and buy some hoses I I mean I it was absolutely like really I don't need houses go to this place and buy this hoses I got in there and ordered my hoses and I was ready to take them out and one of the guys that are there that works there said can I carry these hoses out to the truck for you and I thought well yeah that's nice I walked out there and he turned to me this is a worldly guy and he says do you give any counseling begin to talk to the man about his life and never before Did It Strike me how needy this world is I mean the guy's sitting there tears running down his face and he said I he needs God I need God he said he said I've quit drinking for three weeks now so that ain't very long but I'd never seen someone just so hungry and so lost and and we've got to get past where we're always the ones running to the altar you don't understand we've got to settle these issues [Music] got to come to the place like Matthew said tonight we have a purpose we have a work to do and it's not for each other it's for this world out there if we could take that power in each of our hearts that man has got such a burden on my heart and of course I invited him to the house of God but he needs God he needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost he needs the cleansing power of our God and you're the possessors The Works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than these because I go to the father and I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come again and be with you even in you tell the end church I'm looking for God really to do something for in the highways and byways aren't you
