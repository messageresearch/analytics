[16:08] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to him in prayer. Heavenly
[16:11] Father, Lord,
[16:13] we do rejoice in the praise report and
[16:16] Lord, in the your goodness to us,
[16:19] Father, it's
[16:21] how we come before you is recognizing
[16:23] who you are, that you've bid us to come,
[16:25] Lord, that in your hand is the answer to
[16:29] all things. And father, as the [music]
[16:33] praise report was read and it was
[16:36] mentioned that they had taken him off
[16:37] the life support, Father, how many times
[16:40] the end of that story is a tragedy,
[16:43] Lord, that would mark something that was
[16:48] a direction that was too far to return
[16:50] from, Lord, but you intervened, Lord,
[16:53] and you gave him breath. And Lord, the
[16:56] first words he spoke was that you're
[16:58] good. And Lord, before the report comes,
[17:00] before there's anything given, you're
[17:02] still the same. Lord, you're good to us.
[17:05] Your mercies have been everlasting.
[17:06] You're the reason we're here now. And
[17:09] Lord, for the requests that were made,
[17:10] our brother Jeff, the concern, and Lord,
[17:13] the fear that there would be. And Lord,
[17:16] we could just imagine what it would be
[17:17] at that time. But Lord, if we could look
[17:19] to you, Lord, we would know that it's
[17:22] all going to be according to your plan
[17:24] and purpose. Father, we commit that to
[17:26] you and your mighty hand. And we ask
[17:28] that you be present with his neighbor.
[17:29] [music] Lord, two requests for
[17:31] neighbors. And Lord,
[17:34] brother Tommy's neighbor, a man who's
[17:36] old in age. And Lord, you told us to to
[17:40] look to our elderly and to care for
[17:41] them. And [music] Father, that's who you
[17:43] are. You care. We ask that you would
[17:45] just give him his portion. Father, be
[17:47] [music] be a strength, Lord. May he know
[17:50] you're near. And Lord, as he has not had
[17:54] fluids, Father, may you just refresh
[17:56] him. And I pray, Lord, as we're here
[17:59] tonight, Father, it's [music] because
[18:00] you bid us to come. Lord, we've gathered
[18:03] in your name in this house. And there's
[18:04] needs that are represented, maybe not
[18:06] spoken, maybe not even represented by
[18:09] uplifted hands, but Lord, I believe
[18:11] you're mindful of each need that's here.
[18:13] [music] Lord, you're going to come in
[18:15] your word and you're going to minister
[18:17] life to us. So Lord, we just want to
[18:19] prepare our hearts to receive from you.
[18:21] And we want to give you thanks now for
[18:23] all the [music] things that you're
[18:24] doing. We love you, Lord. commit it all
[18:26] to you in the mighty name of Jesus
[18:28] Christ we pray. Amen.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just try to sing
[18:34] that? Amen. I
[18:38] heard thousand [singing and music]
[18:41] story of what they think you are
[18:47] [singing and music] that I've heard.
[18:51] and a whisper [music]
[18:53] of love
[18:56] that [music] I'm not to tell me
[19:02] why you [music]

[19:22] who I am.
[19:25] It's [music] who I am.
[19:28] It's who I [singing] am.
[19:32] Oh,
[19:36] search [singing and music] for answers
[19:40] found and wide.
[19:44] No, you're all searching for it.
[19:50] So [music]
[19:51] you cry [singing] like all I know
[19:55] just what we need you to
[20:01] see your [music] word

[20:30] your way.

[29:30] that stand on that [music] and reflect
[29:33] it. Father, the vision of what you had

[30:18] it and see uh how many of us can go.

[31:05] you remember
[31:07] when he met you.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Uh
[31:11] it might have been conviction.
[31:13] [music] It might have been sorrow. It
[31:15] might have been regret. But
[31:18] nevertheless, there's that lovely strain
[31:20] of grace. And even in my worst
[31:23] correction, I've always felt his love.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's marvelous grace [music]

[35:21] Amen. Let's just bow our heads together.
[35:24] Father, as we again come [music] before
[35:25] you this evening, we're thankful that we
[35:27] can gather together, Lord. We can come
[35:30] out, Father, of the just the busyiness
[35:32] of life and [music] take time, Lord, to
[35:35] to sit at your feet and to worship you
[35:37] and hear what [music] you have to say.
[35:40] Doesn't matter who's standing behind
[35:42] here, Father. And [music] Lord, whatever
[35:44] is said, Lord, we we want it to be
[35:46] direct from your word. We we want our
[35:48] hearts to be intent upon it, Father.
[35:52] And God, if there's correction, Lord, I
[35:54] want to accept it, Father. If there's
[35:56] joy, I want to accept it, Lord. I want
[35:58] everything that your word has for me,
[36:00] Lord. We pray because we know, Father,
[36:03] it's a deceptive hour that we're living
[36:04] in. But the beauty of it is, Lord, is
[36:07] you won't lose a one.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; And Father, we're so thankful [music]
[36:11] for the elect, Father, of this age.
[36:14] We're thankful to be able to stand here,
[36:16] Father, and stand before her. And God,
[36:18] we don't take it lightly. So, Father, we
[36:21] surrender our minds to you now and our
[36:23] thoughts and ask that you would just
[36:25] deal with your people in the only way
[36:26] that you know how [music] as we
[36:28] surrender everything now to your to your
[36:30] hand, Father, in Jesus name, we ask it.
[36:33] Amen.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love him, don't you?
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing together,
[36:38] we'd like you to turn to 2 Chronicles.
[36:41] It's definitely good to be back here and
[36:43] to see some familiar faces. And uh I
[36:47] don't think anyone here I think every
[36:49] for the most part everyone kind of knows
[36:51] me is that I don't remember names very
[36:53] well but I I I remember brother Ben and
[36:56] the reason why is because I was at
[36:58] brother Davies just to say who is that
[36:59] brother that I know brother Ben. So good
[37:03] to have you here. Good. Hey I'm glad
[37:05] you're here. Familiar face brother Matt
[37:08] and I better stop calling names because
[37:10] I'm going to forget everyone that's that
[37:13] it's good to see you. And for those that
[37:15] have come to our neck of the woods, I I
[37:18] won't even call it woods, our neck of
[37:19] the the desert of the panhandle to
[37:21] support our meetings at times. We thank
[37:23] you for doing that. And it means a lot
[37:25] to our little assembly and for brother
[37:27] David and all that he's done here in the
[37:30] work in the Dallas Fort Worth area. We
[37:33] just thank God for that. How many can
[37:34] say, "Thank you, Lord." Amen. It takes a
[37:36] special person to be called to this
[37:38] area. I guarantee it. Amen. And it
[37:41] wasn't me. I was called to the back side
[37:42] of the desert and he was called to the
[37:44] land of many peoples. So, but God bless
[37:47] you, brother David, in your work here
[37:49] and all that's here to help him.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; That's a true. Yes, you have your
[37:55] testimony. Hey, we enjoyed your
[37:57] testimony. I I I when I seen you today,
[38:00] hey, I'm just getting comfortable. Is
[38:01] that all right?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; So, when I seen you, I was like, man,
[38:04] he's aged so much. And then I realized,
[38:07] oh, it's just because I watched his
[38:08] testimony, the one in in Canada. I was
[38:10] like, ah, that's what it was. Uh, and so
[38:13] that was like that's what it was. It was
[38:15] just uh, you know, YouTube does it to
[38:17] you. I don't know. Just get it. But our
[38:20] our church enjoyed the testimony again.
[38:22] And I say if you haven't heard it,
[38:24] listen to it again. Amen. All right. Now
[38:26] that everyone is either not calm or
[38:29] nervous, let's get into the word.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Chronicles chapter 36. We're
[38:35] going to begin reading uh at verse 15
[38:39] and then we go to verse number 20.
[38:42] My I love that sound. The sound of pages
[38:47] being turned.
[38:50] Verse number 15. When you have it, say
[38:51] amen.
[38:54] And the Lord God of their fathers sent
[38:57] to them by his messengers rising up
[39:00] times early and sending because he had
[39:03] compassion on his people and on his
[39:06] dwelling place otherwise he desired to
[39:08] save them.
[39:10] Verse 16, very important. But they
[39:12] mocked the messengers of God and
[39:16] despised his words and misused his
[39:19] prophets until the wrath of the Lord
[39:22] arose against his people till there was
[39:25] no remedy or deliverance.
[39:29] Therefore, he brought upon them, notice,
[39:31] he brought upon them the king of the
[39:34] chales, who slew their young men with
[39:37] the sword in the house of their
[39:39] sanctuary, and had no compassion upon
[39:42] young men or maiden, old men, or him
[39:44] that stooped for age. He gave them all
[39:48] into his hand. and the all the vessels
[39:51] of the house of God, great and small,
[39:53] and the treasures of the house of the
[39:55] Lord, and the treasures of the king, and
[39:57] of his princes. All these he brought to
[40:00] Babylon,
[40:02] and they burnt the house of God, and
[40:05] break down the wall of Jerusalem, and
[40:08] burnt all the palaces thereof with fire,
[40:11] and destroyed all the goodly vessels
[40:13] thereof. Last verse. And them that had
[40:16] escaped from the sword carried he away
[40:19] to Babylon, where they were servants to
[40:24] him and his sons until the reign of the
[40:26] kingdom of Persia. God bless you. You
[40:29] can have your seats.
[40:32] I know this is an interesting scripture
[40:35] to read and and I pray by the end of it
[40:38] that we'll be encouraged. is something
[40:40] that I could not get away from today
[40:42] very much wrestling in in what the Lord
[40:46] would have for you tonight.
[40:48] It is said here not that the king of the
[40:51] Chaldans went against them. Notice
[40:55] &gt;&gt; but that the Lord
[40:57] &gt;&gt; brought upon them the king of the
[41:00] Chaldans.
[41:02] It was God who did this because very
[41:05] important of their constant misuse of
[41:09] the ministry given to them.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; I want this to really sink in. I uh
[41:15] because we we deal with our humanity and
[41:17] we see the face of the ministry. We see
[41:20] the face of the prophet. We see uh you
[41:22] know many people uh quite often want to
[41:25] point out his faults, right? And they
[41:27] want to say well he you know I I get it.
[41:29] He was just a man, but he was still a
[41:31] prophet of God.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And there is a five-fold ministry as
[41:34] well that are called of God.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are men, but they are still
[41:39] called of God.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Verse 16, but they mocked the messengers
[41:44] of God and despised his words and
[41:48] misused his prophets until the wrath of
[41:51] the Lord arose against his people till
[41:54] there was no remedy. And I want to say
[41:57] that word again, deliverance. till there
[41:59] was no deliverance. We're going to take
[42:01] a thought this evening for a few moments
[42:03] entitled, you've heard this statement
[42:04] before, but death by a thousand cuts.
[42:08] Death by a thousand cuts. Luke 10:16,
[42:12] Jesus is speaking and he says, "He that
[42:14] heareth you heareth me,
[42:18] &gt;&gt; and he that despiseth you
[42:20] &gt;&gt; despiseth me,
[42:22] &gt;&gt; and he that despiseth me despiseth him
[42:26] that sent me.
[42:28] My word, what a powerful statement in
[42:31] one verse of scripture.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus is bringing this uh and I don't
[42:36] want to just push it to them, but I want
[42:38] to push it to now.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Disrespect for the messenger is
[42:42] ultimately disrespect for the one who
[42:45] sent him.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Now notice we can we can bring this and
[42:49] tie this in in the dealing with Samuel.
[42:51] When Israel demanded to be like everyone
[42:53] else, Israel demanded to have a king.
[42:56] They wanted to be like everyone else.
[42:57] and and there was this uneasiness. There
[43:00] was uh the prophet was very uh disturbed
[43:03] by this and he was taken almost if you
[43:05] would the responsibility. But notice 1st
[43:07] Samuel 8:6 and it said but the thing
[43:12] displeased Samuel and it should
[43:15] &gt;&gt; it should displease the prophet because
[43:17] it wasn't the perfect will of God.
[43:20] And when they give us a king to I'm
[43:23] going to start from the beginning again.
[43:24] But the thing displeased Samuel when
[43:26] they said, "Give us a king to judge us."
[43:30] And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the
[43:32] Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the
[43:34] voice of the people." I want you to
[43:36] understand, there's many times that God
[43:39] will actually tell the ministry, the
[43:41] pastor, to do something because of the
[43:44] people. Sure.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; And and you may not understand that and
[43:48] you may not, but because so many times
[43:50] people are led astray in their prayers
[43:52] by their desire of the heart. I'm trying
[43:55] not to get into that sermon, but I just
[43:57] spoke on this at home, but often times
[44:00] we use our heart, the feeling of our
[44:02] heart, the emotion of it, and because it
[44:04] feels right and we feel uh uh it feels
[44:06] good and it feels like the right thing
[44:08] and and we pray and we pray. But God has
[44:11] been answering through the ministry.
[44:13] He's been answering through the visiting
[44:14] ministers. As a pastor, I've seen that
[44:16] especially last year so many times that
[44:18] that we would uh the whole ministry in
[44:21] our church would be ministering
[44:22] something and then a visitor would come,
[44:24] brother David, and and and not know what
[44:26] was being spoken and would go right down
[44:28] the line uh uh dealing with the hearts
[44:31] of the people, you know, and I'm sitting
[44:32] over there as a pastor going, I didn't
[44:34] say nothing to them. BUT GOD WOULD IS
[44:37] ALWAYS trying to answer. But often times
[44:40] we as people are are are listening to
[44:42] our hearts instead of the word.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; And so here they are. Their desire was
[44:47] to be like everyone else. And but they
[44:50] were to be a separated people. And he
[44:51] said, "Harken unto the voice of the
[44:53] people and all that they say unto thee,
[44:57] for they have not rejected thee, but
[45:01] they have rejected me, that I should not
[45:05] reign over them.
[45:08] Notice another thought here says, ' And
[45:11] God said to Samuel, see they have not
[45:13] rejected you, but they have rejected me
[45:16] from ruling over them. They did not want
[45:18] God to do it.
[45:20] Think about the the as it were prophecy
[45:23] that was given. I mean that this king is
[45:26] going to do this and he's going to do
[45:27] this. He's going to take your lands.
[45:29] He's going to take your money. He's
[45:30] going to take your family. He's going to
[45:32] do all of these things. And they said,
[45:33] "That's okay.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; That's all right." and prophet of God
[45:38] and Samaran church. He said how tragic
[45:40] that was. Little did they realize that
[45:44] when they were asking God to let them be
[45:46] like the rest of the world, they were
[45:48] rejecting him
[45:50] &gt;&gt; because God had ordained that his people
[45:53] act different from the world.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; That that's not being weird.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; That's not that's not just being
[46:02] legalistic, but you're to be different.
[46:04] There's a spirit of difference. There's
[46:06] a spirit in it. It's not just, hey, look
[46:08] at me. I I DRESS THIS WAY. I I NO, it's
[46:12] the attitude. It's the character
[46:14] &gt;&gt; of the word of God that is in our lives.
[46:17] So he said how bad it was. He says they
[46:21] are they are not of the world and don't
[46:24] look like the world and they don't act
[46:26] like the world. They are crucified unto
[46:29] the world and the world is crucified
[46:30] unto them. He said, you know, and he 2
[46:33] Corinthians 6:17-18, he said, "Wherefore
[46:36] come out from among them and be ye
[46:38] separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not
[46:40] the unclean thing, and I will receive
[46:42] you, and will be a father unto you, and
[46:44] ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith
[46:47] the Lord Almighty." Now, here's the very
[46:50] important part of this quote. I I mean,
[46:51] it's all important, but this is
[46:53] something I want to look to. He says,
[46:54] "You see, one difference between Israel
[46:56] and the rest of the nations was what?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; God." Hallelujah.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; I I want you to understand that the
[47:03] difference between us and everything
[47:05] else is God.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; What does he say? YOU PUT GOD TO ONE
[47:10] SIDE AND ISRAEL was like any other
[47:12] nation.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; If we take God OUT OF OUR CHURCH, WE'RE
[47:15] like any other church. We're like any
[47:17] other denomination. We remove his
[47:20] character. We become like anybody else.
[47:23] And then before you know it, it's church
[47:24] hurt this and church hurt that and and
[47:27] everyone's offended. But you keep the
[47:28] life in our homes and the life AND THE
[47:31] CHARACTER OF GOD IN OUR LIVES. WHAT CAN
[47:33] GOD DO? YOU SAY, "WELL, PEOPLE ARE ARE
[47:35] leaving and they're FALLING RIGHT AND
[47:36] LEFT." WE'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS THE HOUR,
[47:39] BUT THERE IS A BRIDE THAT WILL STAY
[47:41] STANDING NO MATTER HOW HARD AND HOW
[47:43] difficult it is.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; So, we got to keep God in our homes. We
[47:47] got to keep God in our church. We got to
[47:49] keep God in our worship. We got to keep
[47:52] God in the youth. Keep God in everything
[47:54] that's about it.
[47:56] When s Sam Samson cut off his hair, he
[47:58] was like any other man. You put the
[48:01] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[48:03] the church is nothing but the world with
[48:07] God's name attached to it.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want that in my church. I
[48:12] don't want that in my home. I don't want
[48:13] that on my family name. Oh, I want my
[48:15] name to be Mrs. Jesus Christ. I I want
[48:18] my children to desire the things of God.
[48:21] I want my my church to desire the things
[48:23] of God. I get it. We can't make
[48:24] everybody happy, but we're not here TO
[48:26] MAKE OUR FLESH HAPPY. We're here to make
[48:28] sure THE PRESENCE OF GOD IS IN OUR MIDST
[48:31] AND THAT HE'S WALKING UP AND DOWN THE
[48:32] AISLES OF OUR HEARTS ON A SIMPLE
[48:34] WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN WE'RE TIRED AND
[48:36] WE'RE BROKEN AND BATTLECAR VETERANS. BUT
[48:38] JESUS IS HERE, the great physician.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And I like it. You're here tonight.
[48:44] You're here on a Wednesday night. That
[48:45] means you want to be here.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And God will do something for you.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; See, the world and the church are all of
[48:52] the same lump. Just like Jacob and Esau
[48:55] were of the same parents, but the spirit
[48:57] of God makes the difference.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; How many can say I want the spirit of
[49:02] God in my life? Even more says it
[49:05] doesn't matter if you call yourself a
[49:06] Christian. Anyone can do that.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; The point is whether or not you have the
[49:11] spirit of God in you.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; FOR WITHOUT THE SPIRIT, you are a
[49:15] repbate and you are none of his. Amen. I
[49:19] don't want to be a repbate. I don't want
[49:20] to be someone, brother Matthew, that
[49:22] walks up to the very end, preaches the
[49:24] word, but I just decide to say enough is
[49:26] enough and throw in the towel. I say,
[49:28] God, you're going to hold me all the way
[49:29] to the end. Not been out of arrogance,
[49:32] not out of anything that we've done, BUT
[49:34] BY HIS GRACE, BROTHER, BY HIS GRACE,
[49:36] he's going to hold us all the way
[49:38] through.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; And we don't we're never going to have
[49:41] all the answers.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; The pastors are never going to have all
[49:44] the answers. The evangelists are never
[49:45] going to have all the answers. The
[49:46] teachers will never have all THE
[49:48] ANSWERS. BUT AS LONG AS WE HAVE GOD IN
[49:49] OUR MIDST, the answer is always there.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're looking for answers in
[49:54] all the wrong places.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; I like what somebody said here recently,
[49:58] and I don't know where it come from, but
[50:00] it says, "We're always asking for a word
[50:01] from the Lord." And he said, "Well, God
[50:02] gave you all the books.
[50:05] What more do you need?"
[50:07] Anyways, there you go. At least you're
[50:09] still here. I guess I haven't put the
[50:11] microphone on correctly, so I'm just
[50:12] going to keep moving it around until it
[50:14] keeps moving itself. It's all right.
[50:17] Destruction may not always come from the
[50:21] sword,
[50:25] but through the power of words.
[50:28] I want us to look at Jude chapter 1.
[50:31] There's a lot of books, a lot of
[50:33] chapters in Jude, so it's going to be
[50:34] hard for you to find it.
[50:37] Jude
[50:39] 1.
[50:41] You know, Jude is not a very fun uh uh,
[50:43] you know, chapter to read. Sometimes it
[50:46] always kind of depends on what spirit
[50:47] you're in.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 10, but these speak evil
[50:54] of those things which they know not,
[50:58] but what they know naturally as brute
[51:00] beasts,
[51:02] in those things they corrupt themselves.
[51:05] Now, I'm going to read that again. I'm
[51:06] going to read it out of a an amplified
[51:07] version. I really like how this brings
[51:09] it out. says, 'But these people
[51:12] criticize things they don't understand.
[51:16] Welcome to the church.
[51:20] They do understand some things,
[51:24] but they understand these things not by
[51:27] thinking, but by feeling
[51:31] the way dumb animals understand things.
[51:35] And these are things that destroy them.
[51:39] Now, I didn't call you a dumb animal. I
[51:41] was just reading a amplified version.
[51:44] So, take it as you will. This never
[51:45] mind. I was going to say about the shoe
[51:46] fitting. Don't do that. But the question
[51:49] of it is is how many times do we think
[51:51] we understand something
[51:53] &gt;&gt; and we begin to criticize based upon
[51:55] what we think we understand.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; But what is verse 11 tells us? It says,
[51:59] "Woe unto them for they have gone in the
[52:02] way of Cain." Woe unto those who think
[52:04] they understand. They're criticizing
[52:07] because of their thinking that they're
[52:08] understanding something, but truly they
[52:10] don't understand. And I have found that
[52:12] God doesn't tell you everything.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; There's some things we don't need to
[52:20] know.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of things you don't
[52:23] need to know
[52:24] &gt;&gt; because we weren't meant to handle to
[52:26] have all of the knowledge of the church
[52:28] problems and all the knowledge of the
[52:30] things that the pastor has to deal with
[52:32] and the ministry has to deal with. Well,
[52:34] it wasn't meant for for you to know
[52:35] everything, BUT I DEMAND TO KNOW.
[52:40] Moving on. Woe to them for they have
[52:43] gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily
[52:45] after the era of Balum for reward and
[52:48] perished in the gains of Kora. That word
[52:52] gains is contradiction.
[52:54] So they perished in the contradiction of
[52:57] Kora or otherwise saying in disputes and
[53:01] question.
[53:03] So they ran. What was his era? In the
[53:06] disputes and questions of Kora. Now
[53:10] let's tie that up with Numbers chapter
[53:11] 16. I've got a quite a few verses of
[53:13] scripture here. I trying to hurry up in
[53:15] time, but slow down for you to find it.
[53:17] Numbers chapter 16:2 says this.
[53:22] And they rose up before Moses with
[53:25] certain of the children of Israel 250
[53:28] princes of the assembly. They got a
[53:30] pretty good following. Brother David,
[53:33] 250 princes of the assembly, famous in
[53:36] the congregation, men of renown,
[53:41] and they gathered themselves together
[53:44] against
[53:45] Moses
[53:48] and against Aaron.
[53:50] So, here we find again the misuse
[53:54] of the word for their day.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, you know what? They
[53:58] had 250 princesses. Princes, princes,
[54:01] may have been some princesses in there.
[54:06] And men of renown, we got this figured
[54:09] out.
[54:11] And said unto them, you or I may say ye,
[54:15] ye take too much upon you.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And seeing all the congregation are
[54:20] holy. I mean, Moses, you've done your
[54:22] job, aren't we holy?
[54:26] Every one of them. And the Lord is among
[54:28] them. Wherefore then, lift yourself up
[54:31] above the congregation of the Lord. Let
[54:34] me just say this. Kora didn't start with
[54:37] a sword.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; He started with questions.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Aren't we all holy?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; I mean, who are you, Moses?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't we all holy? I can hear from God,
[54:50] too.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Well, this sounds spiritual, doesn't it?
[54:56] But it's actually carnally motivated
[54:58] democracy
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and not divine order.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; As much as we as much as we want divine
[55:06] order, when divine order starts to
[55:08] happen in a church, we're like, that's
[55:09] not what I was talking about.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah is right.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Because divine order is not democracy.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; There's a head
[55:22] &gt;&gt; and God is the head. Right? And he is
[55:25] the head of the church and HE PLACES THE
[55:27] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY IN THE CHURCH AND HE
[55:30] HAS THE PASTOR IN THE CHURCH AND HE HAS
[55:32] DIVINE ORDER. BUT THEN THE CHORUS STEPS
[55:34] UP AND HE DOESN'T COME WITH THE SWORD
[55:36] AND SAYS, "I'M GOING TO CUT your head
[55:37] off, Moses." He comes with question
[55:41] and and you know slowly undermining
[55:46] leadership.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's what begins to happen. That's
[55:49] what Kora was starting to do. he was
[55:51] starting. I mean, how in the world,
[55:53] brother David, did he get 250
[55:56] princes ON HIS SIDE? THIS WAS NOT AN
[55:58] overnight disgruntled moment.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; This took years, weeks, months, maybe a
[56:07] year, whatever it was. It took time
[56:11] and frustrations. I want to remind you
[56:13] that you're still in this old coat the
[56:15] prophet of God talked about. So, no
[56:17] matter how much Holy Ghost you have,
[56:19] you're still going to go through
[56:20] frustration and you're still going to
[56:22] have questions in life and and the
[56:24] pastor is not always going to rub you
[56:26] the right way
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and he is not intended to.
[56:31] Notice, brother Brandham says why it had
[56:32] to be shepherd. Paragraph 153 says,
[56:35] notice they complained about God's
[56:38] provided way
[56:40] and that was the reason they died. Now,
[56:43] said closely, don't miss these last few
[56:45] remarks. They complained.
[56:49] Maybe I should ask a question. Yeah, I'm
[56:50] going to ask a question. How many's ever
[56:51] complained before? My hands are up,
[56:53] sweaty and all.
[56:56] I've complained.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I complained from with the divine order.
[57:02] But you see, the difference is is who
[57:04] you are.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to go through those
[57:06] moments of questioning and complaint.
[57:08] David had error in his life, did he not?
[57:11] But it what what showed who he was, the
[57:13] man after God's own heart was when HE
[57:15] MADE A MISTAKE. HE DIDN'T JUST KEEP
[57:17] DOUBLING DOWN AND digging a ditch and
[57:18] get deeper and deeper. And in his
[57:20] mistake, he recognized, "I have sinned.
[57:23] I HAVE FAILED GOD." AND HE REPENTED. AND
[57:26] HE CAME BACK EVEN THE GREATER IN WORSHIP
[57:28] AND ADORATION towards the things of God.
[57:30] Not trying to keep proving why you're
[57:33] right. Like a teenager.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Notice he said they complained. says,
[57:39] 'What made them die in the wilderness?
[57:41] THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT GOD'S PROVIDED
[57:43] WAY. WHY DO WE GOT TO KEEP EATING THE
[57:45] same mana every Sunday? We got to hear
[57:47] this old guy.
[57:49] Now, that's wasn't disrespectful. I'm
[57:51] trying to prove a point.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; That wasn't disrespectful. That wasn't
[57:55] stepping on your toes. He's a young man.
[57:58] But every day, we got to LISTEN TO THE
[58:00] SAME GUY, THE SAME MANA,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; but it's God's provided way.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the only time we get excited
[58:08] I'm I'm being a pastor now is when we
[58:11] have a visiting guy come. Now, not you
[58:13] know what I'm talking about. You ever
[58:14] seen that in your own church? It's like,
[58:16] oo, we're going to have brother David
[58:18] McGaryi Jr.
[58:20] I'm using everybody that's up here.
[58:24] He's going to be the guy. No, no, that's
[58:26] not what it is. God, whomever you have,
[58:28] whatever's provided at that moment, God,
[58:30] you have something for me. I'm going to
[58:32] eat the mana. I need this mana. It's a
[58:35] mana provided for me. But you see,
[58:37] notice they complained about God's
[58:39] provided way by a one-man message, a
[58:42] prophet, a leadership of one man. TELL
[58:44] ME WHERE GOD ever used a group to lead.
[58:47] You won't find it in THE BIBLE. THE WORD
[58:49] came to Moses.
[58:52] Kora, we all know that he got himself
[58:54] together and complained about God not
[58:56] being just. And to do a thing like that,
[58:58] make one man with the message. He said,
[59:00] "We're all holy. We Why can't we have a
[59:03] denomination? Why can't we set up this
[59:05] and do this and do that? GOD TOLD MOSES,
[59:08] "SEPARATE yourself from him. I've had
[59:10] enough of it." And remember, Jude speaks
[59:12] the same thing in the last days. That's
[59:14] right. They perished in the gain sayings
[59:16] of Kora. We also know what happened to
[59:19] Kora. And the rest that qu that question
[59:22] of God's word and God's wisdom of that
[59:24] one man leadership, every one of them
[59:26] perished.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Satan knows how to
[59:34] belittle
[59:36] by the little.
[59:39] By the little. He doesn't always come at
[59:42] you the great big sword and the great
[59:45] big ugly demon looking. Bible talks
[59:48] about the angel of light.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Notice even Jesus. No. Okay. Again, I
[59:54] want I want you to understand this.
[59:55] There there's there's a point to this
[59:56] tonight. Jesus in Mark 6:4 said, 'And
[1:00:01] Jesus said unto them, a prophet
[1:00:04] is not without honor, but in his own
[1:00:07] country and among his own kin and in his
[1:00:09] own house. Now, if you don't understand
[1:00:11] what that is saying, that basically
[1:00:12] means he was more respected outside of
[1:00:14] his area than his own area. Prophets are
[1:00:18] respected. Notice he's saying prophets
[1:00:20] are respected everywhere except in their
[1:00:22] own hometown and by their relatives and
[1:00:24] their family.
[1:00:26] Jesus was saying that now you don't have
[1:00:28] that problem here. Thank God you're
[1:00:30] perfect and everyone's on their way to
[1:00:31] glory. But there's other places that
[1:00:33] have this difficulty where it seems like
[1:00:36] sometimes you can leave your area and
[1:00:38] God can do more because we become
[1:00:41] common. We allow ourselves to become
[1:00:43] common with the mana. Now I'm not
[1:00:44] calling the ministry mana. Please
[1:00:46] understand that. I'm trying to use this
[1:00:47] as a type. God uses the five-fold
[1:00:49] ministry to bring the mana to bring the
[1:00:51] word of the hour. But it sometimes seems
[1:00:54] to be that God can use A MAN MORE
[1:00:56] OUTSIDE of his own country, HIS OWN
[1:00:59] DALLAS FORT Worth area, his own
[1:01:00] Amarillo, his own this area, his own
[1:01:02] that area. WHY? BECAUSE WE GET COMMON
[1:01:05] WITH THE FAITH in front of us. MOSES,
[1:01:08] WHO DO YOU think you are? We put our
[1:01:10] pants on the same way you do. We we have
[1:01:12] to eat the same way you do. Who do YOU
[1:01:14] THINK YOU ARE? WE'RE NOTHING WITHOUT
[1:01:16] GOD. Ministry gives us no elevation. It
[1:01:19] should actually MAKE US MORE HUMBLE. WE
[1:01:21] WE ARE NOTHING WITHOUT HIM.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; But there are times WE HAVE TO STAND
[1:01:25] UPON THE WORD AND PREACH THE WORD
[1:01:27] WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR WHETHER IT hurts
[1:01:29] feelings or not.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Because we're not in this for our
[1:01:32] feelings. We're in this for THE BLOOD OF
[1:01:34] JESUS CHRIST AND THE SALVATION OF OUR
[1:01:36] HEARTS.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; I say I say brothers and sisters, LET'S
[1:01:38] THROW AWAY THE VICTIM MENTALITY AND DIVE
[1:01:41] INTO the word of God.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; No matter who stands here.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Mark 6 verse 5. We're going to continue
[1:01:49] in this what he said. said, and he said,
[1:01:50] "And he could do there,
[1:01:53] and he could there do no mighty work,
[1:01:56] say that he laid his hands upon a few
[1:01:58] sick folk and healed them." And he
[1:02:02] marveled
[1:02:04] because of their unbelief, and he went
[1:02:06] round about the villages teaching.
[1:02:11] Dishonor
[1:02:12] and lack of respect limits the
[1:02:15] supernatural
[1:02:17] in the body.
[1:02:21] Who could ever think to just say, "Oh,
[1:02:24] that was that's just Jesus,
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; right? You know who Jesus is, right? Who
[1:02:30] could ever think that's just Jesus?" But
[1:02:32] that's the way they became when he was
[1:02:35] there because they seen him grow up,
[1:02:38] right? They seen all they they've seen
[1:02:40] his face and all it was, that's just
[1:02:42] Jesus.
[1:02:43] So I want you to understand that before
[1:02:45] you know it it's well that's just
[1:02:46] brother David
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and that's just that's just brother Matt
[1:02:50] and that's just listen I I I all of the
[1:02:54] ministers that are here I have you all
[1:02:55] raise your hands that's just this one
[1:02:57] and we do we begin to lose respect with
[1:02:59] one another
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; because we're all called of God I don't
[1:03:02] want to just leave the ministry in this
[1:03:04] we're all called of God and before you
[1:03:05] know it as the elect we forget that we
[1:03:08] are to be elect and the person sitting
[1:03:10] next to YOU COULD BE ELECT also and we
[1:03:12] SHOULD NOT LOSE OUR RESPECT FOR THAT
[1:03:14] INDIVIDUAL EITHER. AND WE'VE ALL SINNED
[1:03:17] AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. AND
[1:03:18] WE ALL NEED THE MERCY and grace of God.
[1:03:20] And we all at times need to RECOGNIZE
[1:03:22] THAT WE'RE EAGLES, NOT FLYING WHERE WE
[1:03:24] NEED TO BE FLYING. BUT BY GOD'S GRACE,
[1:03:27] THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE THAT GAVE US A
[1:03:29] WORD AND DUE SEASON. AND WE BEGIN to eat
[1:03:31] upon that meat so we could start SOARING
[1:03:33] THE HEIGHTS AS WELL. GOD MAY WANT TO USE
[1:03:35] YOU TO DO THE SAME FOR the person
[1:03:37] sitting next to you instead of with the
[1:03:39] attitude of I knew you would do that.
[1:03:42] No, there's something in our heart as an
[1:03:44] eagle that says, "I want to help my
[1:03:46] brother. I want to help my sister."
[1:03:48] Whereas the eyes of the enemy says, "I
[1:03:50] knew you were going to be that way. I
[1:03:52] knew you were going to have that
[1:03:52] reaction. I knew this was going to be
[1:03:54] the way it is." And all we're doing is
[1:03:56] looking upon that when we need to turn
[1:03:58] around to our OWN AND SAY, "GOD, I NEED
[1:04:00] YOU. I'm nothing without you."
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But here is Jesus.
[1:04:05] Jesus. and he couldn't hardly do
[1:04:08] anything
[1:04:10] with his own family. And if I can say
[1:04:12] this, his own church, if I could, if you
[1:04:15] could allow me to use that way.
[1:04:17] [snorts] Do you know that the cut
[1:04:19] doesn't always bleed at first?
[1:04:22] You see, most disrespect doesn't start
[1:04:24] as open rebellion.
[1:04:26] It's in the size.
[1:04:29] the private complaints, the little jokes
[1:04:31] about leadership,
[1:04:33] like paper cuts, small but painful and
[1:04:36] easily infected.
[1:04:38] Then the little things begin to
[1:04:40] accumulate and unchecked criticism and
[1:04:42] passive indifference and failure to pray
[1:04:44] for leadership, dismissing God's word
[1:04:47] because of the vessel it comes through.
[1:04:51] That's all it is. It's just the simple
[1:04:53] things that begin to happen. the lack of
[1:04:56] respect for the children, for the
[1:04:57] parents or it listen and it starts at
[1:05:00] home. If there's no respect built at
[1:05:03] home, it's hard to get the respect in
[1:05:04] the church. That's why you see America
[1:05:07] becoming the way it's become because
[1:05:09] somewhere along the way they've lost the
[1:05:11] teaching of respects. So now there's no
[1:05:14] teaching for respect of authority.
[1:05:16] There's no teaching of true respect. Oh,
[1:05:18] but brother Jeremy, don't you know
[1:05:19] there's there's crooks out there in the
[1:05:21] authority? Absolutely. There's crooks
[1:05:23] out there in the authority. No, I I'm
[1:05:25] not saying that we worship them, but but
[1:05:27] there's authority out there and we
[1:05:28] render to Caesar what Caesar, but it's
[1:05:30] not being taught in the homes. And
[1:05:32] because it's not being taught in the
[1:05:34] homes, it shows and manifests in the
[1:05:36] church to where when the pastor actually
[1:05:38] has to say something that's cutting,
[1:05:40] then we go home and like, "Oh, that was
[1:05:42] just brother brother David and you know,
[1:05:44] he's just going on a rant."
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; That rant could save your child.
[1:05:51] Yes, sir.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; That rant could save your soul.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And so, instead of it just dismissing it
[1:05:57] as a rant from brother David because,
[1:05:59] you know, that's just who he is. I say,
[1:06:01] let's look at it a little bit deeper.
[1:06:02] It's not just a rant from the prophet OF
[1:06:04] GOD. I SAY WE START LISTENING to a
[1:06:06] little bit more of his rants. I don't
[1:06:08] don't think me disrespectful, but I love
[1:06:10] listening to the prophet of God's rants.
[1:06:12] I like listening to say, "OH, SPEAKING."
[1:06:14] WHY? BECAUSE IT'S RELEVANT TODAY. IT
[1:06:16] WASN'T JUST RELEVANT for 1963 or 64 or
[1:06:19] before. It's still relevant today. IN
[1:06:22] FACT, IT'S more relevant now than it was
[1:06:23] then.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Instead of googling everything, I think
[1:06:27] the message of the hour kind of gives us
[1:06:28] a pretty good idea of where we are.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we find that so many
[1:06:35] people are googling so many things and
[1:06:36] then when it comes to the prophet of
[1:06:38] God, we're like, "OH, IT'S WRONG." DO
[1:06:39] YOU RECOGNIZE that Google could be
[1:06:40] wrong, too?
[1:06:47] Christ is the mystery of God revealed in
[1:06:48] Jeffersonville,
[1:06:50] uh, Indiana. This was, uh, paragraph 86.
[1:06:52] He said, "If the brother," maybe we
[1:06:54] ought not to read this one. No, I think
[1:06:55] this is a good one. If you think he's a
[1:06:58] little wrong, or the sister
[1:07:01] say, "Lord, I knew it. They were wrong."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; No, everyone knows this quote,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; but it's hard sometimes to put it in
[1:07:10] action.
[1:07:12] Lord, don't never let ha uh uh don't let
[1:07:15] me never have the root of bitterness
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; spring up
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; because it'll affect him.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my, this is the next part is very
[1:07:25] important. It'll take the Christ right
[1:07:27] out of my life.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You said it ain't possible. Yes, it is.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit's timid.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I love the paradox there. It's timid,
[1:07:39] but it's also powerful.
[1:07:41] But you see, I want you to say, notice,
[1:07:43] I'm just reading what the prophet is
[1:07:44] saying. You do with it what you will.
[1:07:45] It'll take the Christ right out of my
[1:07:47] life. That poison acids of malice and
[1:07:51] jealousy and hatred that will just TAKE
[1:07:54] THE HOLY SPIRIT RIGHT AWAY FROM YOU.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm the elect of God and I'm the I
[1:08:01] understand you ARE, BUT IF YOU'RE THE
[1:08:02] ELECT OF GOD, YOU'LL LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S
[1:08:04] SAYING AND YOU'LL get it right. We're
[1:08:06] not just going to sit on our spiritual
[1:08:08] uh couches AND BECOME SPIRITUAL COUCH
[1:08:10] POTATOES. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE WORD OF
[1:08:12] GOD. AND WE'RE going to recognize, I've
[1:08:14] got a family THAT'S AT STAKE. I'VE GOT A
[1:08:16] HUSBAND THAT'S AT STAKE. I GOT A WIFE
[1:08:18] THAT'S AT STAKE. I'VE GOT UH BROTHERS
[1:08:20] AND SISTERS that are at stake.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And we we come to the house of God and
[1:08:26] we want the pastor to fix everything for
[1:08:28] our family. But then we go home and we
[1:08:30] go back to the same exact thing that we
[1:08:31] were doing.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; That don't work.
[1:08:37] I'm Phil freedom tonight. So, we're just
[1:08:40] sometimes sometimes you just got I will
[1:08:42] just tell you that this whole trip was
[1:08:43] was wasted on what I actually came here
[1:08:45] for. I went there I went there to do
[1:08:48] what I was supposed to do with my van
[1:08:50] and they said, "Oh, you can't do that."
[1:08:51] So, you mean I traveled all the way here
[1:08:53] after doing all of this and it's for
[1:08:54] not? Yep. You can't do that. Okay. Well,
[1:08:56] at least I got good fellowship and I'm
[1:08:58] here tonight with you. So, it's not
[1:09:00] wasted after all.
[1:09:03] the poison acids of malice, jealousy,
[1:09:05] and hatred that'll just take the Holy
[1:09:07] Spirit right away from you. It will run
[1:09:09] him from the tabernacle.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; IT'LL KILL THE SPIRIT OF GOD. WHAT?
[1:09:15] MALICE, JEALOUSY, HATRED, or drive it
[1:09:19] from here. It'll hurt your pastor. Ah,
[1:09:22] we don't care about that. He's strong.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; It'll do everything. See, he said,
[1:09:29] "Don't you do that.
[1:09:32] You just waxed that much closer
[1:09:35] together.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, Christian Life Tabernacle,
[1:09:40] you're going to be tested for this
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; time and time again.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Not just once, and you'll overcome it,
[1:09:47] and you're going to get tested again.
[1:09:49] God allowed, Brother David uh uh to do
[1:09:51] something, and it will just not fit our
[1:09:53] fancy
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; and you'll be tested again. And God will
[1:09:58] allow something to be done and the
[1:09:59] deacon will make a decision and this one
[1:10:01] will do that and before you know it
[1:10:03] we'll be tested again.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Why? The the prophet of God's warning us
[1:10:08] just get closer together.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Love one another anyhow. Talk nice about
[1:10:13] one another. Say nice things about one
[1:10:16] another. And then God will bless you.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Think about it as it was uh Solomon
[1:10:22] spoke of the small foxes. They can spoil
[1:10:26] our lives and squaltch the fruit that we
[1:10:28] could be be uh producing. Because if we
[1:10:31] continue to leave these things unchecked
[1:10:35] in our lives, not even speak. We might
[1:10:38] not even speak but think.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; God knows the very thoughts.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And uh sometimes we're like, "Woo, at
[1:10:46] least I didn't say it." But you thought
[1:10:47] it.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; How many times did the prophet of God
[1:10:50] said, "Your thoughts will be played."
[1:10:53] Listen, I want to get them under the
[1:10:54] blood now.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I want to get everything now because I
[1:10:57] don't want them ever played that day
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; because I know as THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:11:01] CHRIST, they they this is my judgment.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; This is my time of judgment right here
[1:11:06] and right now. SO I SAY, GOD, YOU KNOW,
[1:11:08] SOMETIMES WE JUST DON'T WANT THE PASTOR
[1:11:10] TO come up here and and get on our
[1:11:11] Listen, I would RATHER GOD USE A PASTOR
[1:11:14] TO RAKE US OVER the coals than stand ON
[1:11:16] THE WRONG SIDE OF THE THRONE THAT DAY.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I say, GOD, BRING IT ALL OUT. OPEN NOW.
[1:11:22] GOD, TEAR EVERYTHING OUT NOW. EXPOSE
[1:11:25] EVERYTHING NOW SO MY HEART CAN BE OPEN
[1:11:27] BEFORE you now because I want to BE
[1:11:28] STANDING WITH YOU that day.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; We forget that the ministry
[1:11:37] stands in the gap. God has called the
[1:11:40] true five-fold ministry to stand in the
[1:11:43] gap.
[1:11:44] that ministry is in the front lines of
[1:11:47] defense and yet they can be the most
[1:11:50] criticized and lonely.
[1:11:53] I've heard the I've heard the jokes
[1:11:55] throughout my whole growing up of
[1:11:57] ministries and ministers and oh they
[1:12:00] must have an easy life and they're this
[1:12:01] and they're that and oh you know and
[1:12:04] what all this little criticism they
[1:12:05] don't know that the very person they're
[1:12:08] criticizing has actually been standing
[1:12:10] in the gap that week for them
[1:12:13] has been actually bearing burdens for
[1:12:16] them that week. We forget that God uses
[1:12:20] the ministry. Not the ministry is not to
[1:12:22] just come at the moment. Oh, I'm only in
[1:12:24] the ministry when I'm behind here.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Uh, no. If you're truly called of God,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about running without a
[1:12:33] message. I'm talking about truly called
[1:12:34] of God. This is a daily grind
[1:12:37] spiritually for you,
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; right? For you. And and it might not be
[1:12:44] the same person. God might use this one
[1:12:46] and God might use this. We all help one
[1:12:48] another. We all have burdens and we're
[1:12:50] all praying for one another. I'm not
[1:12:51] leaving you out of this. This is just
[1:12:53] what God's asked for me to speak
[1:12:54] tonight. I'm not leaving any one of us
[1:12:56] out. But I'm saying sometimes we lose
[1:12:58] the resp we forget the spiritual warfare
[1:13:01] that's going on behind the scenes.
[1:13:06] I've seen so pastors throughout my life
[1:13:09] and ministry weakened by their own
[1:13:13] congregation.
[1:13:16] not weakened by fall. Many ministers
[1:13:18] don't fall from scandal, but from being
[1:13:20] worn down,
[1:13:22] emotional fatigue, discouragement, and
[1:13:25] spiritual drain. And don't you one
[1:13:27] minute argue with me about that because
[1:13:29] you go look at the prophet of God. Well,
[1:13:31] he was a prophet of God. Listen, I'm not
[1:13:33] placing anybody in that level, but a
[1:13:36] ministry, a God- called ministry has to
[1:13:39] fight the that a battle as well. and
[1:13:42] it's and it's fatigue and it's tiresome
[1:13:45] and it's worn out, but all we can see is
[1:13:48] the face. If the enemy can just get us
[1:13:50] to look at the face and we can get us to
[1:13:52] look at the faults that we see as faults
[1:13:55] in and this brother, we actually don't
[1:13:57] pray for them.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; This is something that is this is
[1:14:01] something that is not just a simple
[1:14:03] local problem. This is a national
[1:14:05] problem. This is a world issue. This is
[1:14:07] a problem all across the world. We lose
[1:14:10] sight of the spiritual warfare that is
[1:14:13] actually going listen right now. Have
[1:14:15] you forgotten the spiritual warfare
[1:14:16] that's happening in this church right
[1:14:18] now? No. The the angels are not just
[1:14:21] sitting here. THERE IS A BATTLE THAT IS
[1:14:23] GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR
[1:14:25] YOU. THERE'S A SPIRITUAL WARFARE THAT IS
[1:14:27] HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO CATCH YOUR
[1:14:29] attention and to get you OFF FROM
[1:14:31] HEARING EXACTLY WHAT YOU need to hear.
[1:14:33] But there is also those angels THAT ARE
[1:14:35] CAMPED ABOUT US that love THE LORD THAT
[1:14:37] ARE FIGHTING FOR YOU AND ARE WORKING for
[1:14:39] you so that you can receive a word from
[1:14:42] the Lord tonight.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; There is discouragement and there's
[1:14:47] spiritual drain and there's emotional
[1:14:49] fatigue
[1:14:50] and you think, "Oh, not my pastor.
[1:14:54] He's the he's, you know, he's up there.
[1:14:56] He doesn't have this." And I'm not
[1:14:59] speaking for him, but I'm sure there's a
[1:15:01] battle. There's emotional fatigue. I
[1:15:05] wouldn't say ask his wife. She probably
[1:15:07] would know, but she's not left out of it
[1:15:09] either. She fights the same things. She
[1:15:13] fights those emotional the the fatigue
[1:15:15] and the tiredness. She might not preach
[1:15:17] a sermon, but she's taking that same
[1:15:20] warfare in that sense. You understand?
[1:15:22] Because the gift is called they're
[1:15:23] called together. I
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I might not be saying it the way you
[1:15:26] want me to say it, but I think you
[1:15:28] understand.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Notice what happens here in Numbers
[1:15:31] 20:10. And I'm trying to hurry here.
[1:15:34] Says, "And Moses and Aaron gathered the
[1:15:35] congregation together before the rock."
[1:15:37] Now, we're trying to prove a point here.
[1:15:39] And he said unto them, "Hear now, ye
[1:15:42] rebels."
[1:15:44] Now, why would Moses say that, Brother
[1:15:45] David? He was fed up.
[1:15:49] He was tired.
[1:15:51] He was worn out of dealing with what?
[1:15:53] People.
[1:15:56] You never get that way here. Now, you
[1:15:59] rebels, must we fetch you water out of
[1:16:01] this rock? Now, let me ask you this.
[1:16:03] Wasn't Moses called? Was not he a
[1:16:06] prophet? Was not he a minister to the
[1:16:08] congregation? Was not he told what to
[1:16:10] do.
[1:16:12] What did he do? He got tired. Emot. I'm
[1:16:15] just going to throw this in. Emotionally
[1:16:17] fatigued,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; worn down.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And he called the people rebels.
[1:16:23] Brother Brandham even had to apologize
[1:16:25] for I think one time he he remember how
[1:16:27] many he called them Rickys and
[1:16:28] Rickettettas and he said I believe he
[1:16:31] said he told me you ought not to do
[1:16:32] that.
[1:16:35] Think about it.
[1:16:37] Moses lifted up his hand with his rod.
[1:16:39] He smoked the rock twice and the water
[1:16:41] came out abundantly and the congregation
[1:16:43] drank and their beasts also. Why?
[1:16:45] Because he was a prophet of God and God
[1:16:47] honored that. But he didn't do it the
[1:16:49] right way because he was tired.
[1:16:53] Now again, I'm not speaking for your
[1:16:54] pastor and I'm not speaking for your
[1:16:55] ministry. Maybe they don't get tired,
[1:16:58] but we get tired and we get worn down.
[1:17:01] You get tired, church. You get tired.
[1:17:04] We're all written epistles. We're out of
[1:17:06] all men and we get tired and we get worn
[1:17:09] down.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just want to call
[1:17:12] everyone rebels.
[1:17:15] How many times did Moses fight?
[1:17:20] How many times did he fight for those
[1:17:23] trying to undermine his God-given
[1:17:25] authority?
[1:17:27] How many times did he stand in the gap
[1:17:30] for the very ones that was cursing him,
[1:17:33] making fun of him, telling him he was
[1:17:35] nothing? Let me just say this.
[1:17:40] You know, I can take this paper and I
[1:17:41] can just do one single cut and it does
[1:17:44] nothing.
[1:17:46] I mean, the paper still stands,
[1:17:50] but you take another one.
[1:17:52] I'm only I'm only one cut, but then you
[1:17:55] take another one. And then you have a
[1:17:57] conversation at home, and then you get
[1:17:59] with this one, and then you get with
[1:18:00] this one, and oh, and you get with this
[1:18:02] one, and before you know it, it's just
[1:18:05] all shreds.
[1:18:08] I'm not saying your pastor is in that
[1:18:09] way. I'm just talking about we death by
[1:18:12] a thousand cuts. Simple little you. What
[1:18:16] you said was razor thin.
[1:18:19] What you said did not rock the world.
[1:18:23] Did not change the world. But it was one
[1:18:26] cut in the sheet of paper.
[1:18:30] Single cut is small, but if you make a
[1:18:32] thousand cuts in the same paper, it will
[1:18:34] eventually fall apart.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; How many REVIVALS HAVE DIED NOT FROM
[1:18:39] SIN, BUT from familiarity with the
[1:18:42] anointed?
[1:18:45] Think about what this word death by a
[1:18:47] thousand cuts comes from. It comes from
[1:18:49] the word lingchi. The word was used to
[1:18:52] describe the prolonging of a person's
[1:18:54] agony when the person was being killed.
[1:18:59] Let me put you this way. The ministry,
[1:19:01] true ministry only wants and desires the
[1:19:05] salvation
[1:19:07] of you.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; That's all they want. They truly want to
[1:19:13] see you succeed in the word and in
[1:19:16] growth. There is no big eyes and there's
[1:19:19] no little 's. There is only the
[1:19:21] anointing for it. So it has nothing to
[1:19:22] do, listen, I could be brother Jeremy
[1:19:24] that wasn't called to preach the word. I
[1:19:26] could be that, but it because I was
[1:19:28] called to this doesn't make me big or
[1:19:30] anything. It has nothing to do with
[1:19:33] that. IT'S ONLY GOD USING a vessel that
[1:19:36] is broken and IT NEED TO BE PUT BACK
[1:19:38] TOGETHER TO DO WHAT? TO JUST GIVE A
[1:19:40] WORD. LISTEN, we talked about the
[1:19:42] foolishness of preaching.
[1:19:45] This is foolish. Think about what we're
[1:19:48] doing. I'm standing be IN FRONT OF A
[1:19:49] BUNCH OF PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW. SPITTING
[1:19:51] and yelling and saying all kinds of
[1:19:53] things. IT'S FOOLISH. I DON'T KNOW your
[1:19:55] life. I don't want to be up here.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I I mean that. I don't want to be up
[1:20:03] here. I'd rather be sitting over there
[1:20:05] with my wife,
[1:20:08] but I'm doing what God wants me to do.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And it's not easy for you to stand
[1:20:13] sometimes with your friends in the world
[1:20:16] and on your job and take a stand for the
[1:20:18] things of God. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN
[1:20:20] THAT POSITION, BUT YOU WERE CALLED TO.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CALLED NOT TO DO IT WITH
[1:20:24] ARROGANCE AND NOT TO DO IT WITH PRIDE,
[1:20:26] BUT TO DO IT WITH HUMILITY THAT YOU
[1:20:28] SAID, "BY THE GRACE OF GOD, LOOK AT WHAT
[1:20:30] HE'S DONE FOR ME. I WILL NOT STAND FOR
[1:20:31] THOSE THINGS." HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; We stand for the truth for our family.
[1:20:35] We show up on Wednesday nights.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; We show up ON SUNDAY MORNINGS. WE SHOW
[1:20:40] UP ON SUNDAY NIGHTS.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; We do these not because I DON'T WANT TO
[1:20:44] BE PREACHED AT, BUT WE DO IT BECAUSE
[1:20:46] THERE'S SOMETHING IN OUR HEART. I
[1:20:47] BELIEVE A TRUE BELIEVER DESIRES TO BE IN
[1:20:50] THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYTIME THEY CAN AND
[1:20:52] THE doors are open.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Other than that, it's a cut.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; It's a cut.
[1:21:06] God works in mysterious ways.
[1:21:10] God works in mysterious ways.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; God works in mysterious ways.
[1:21:17] God works in mysterious ways.
[1:21:21] Who would have thought you and your life
[1:21:23] and your sins and your faults would be
[1:21:25] sitting in a pew tonight hearing the
[1:21:27] word of God, worshiping God with your
[1:21:29] hands raised, set free from ALL YOUR
[1:21:31] PAST. GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS. I
[1:21:33] DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR IT. I DON'T
[1:21:35] NEED AN ANSWER FOR IT. BUT I CAN TELL
[1:21:36] YOU THIS, the only answer I can say is
[1:21:38] IT'S JESUS. AND IT'S NOT BY ME, BUT IT'S
[1:21:41] BY HIS GRACE AND MERCY.
[1:21:44] Isaiah 58:12 says, "And they that shall
[1:21:47] be of thee shall build the old waste
[1:21:49] places. Thou shalt raise up the
[1:21:52] foundations of many generations, and
[1:21:53] thou shalt be called the repairer of the
[1:21:56] breach, the restorer of the paths to
[1:21:58] dwell in." It's not just critics and
[1:22:00] casualties.
[1:22:02] It's not just about being critics and
[1:22:03] casualties, but it's about restoration
[1:22:05] and healing that can come. WE'RE NOT
[1:22:07] HERE TO OUTDUEL preaching and outdo this
[1:22:10] and be the best church this and look at
[1:22:12] me. No, we are here to be restorers. We
[1:22:16] are here to be healers. Not that I'm a
[1:22:18] healer, but the healer is within me. And
[1:22:21] the healer can speak through the words.
[1:22:23] I'm done trying to be a little blade
[1:22:25] that is JUST PROBING AND PRODDDING
[1:22:27] BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK my way. I SAY,
[1:22:28] GOD, LET ME BE A RESTORER OF MY FAMILY.
[1:22:31] LET ME STAND up for my children. Let me
[1:22:33] stand up for my family.
[1:22:35] God still has people who will honor his
[1:22:37] word and cherish his messengers and
[1:22:39] rebuild what others have torn down. IF
[1:22:42] YOU'VE MADE CUTS, HE CAN HEAL. IF YOU'VE
[1:22:45] BEEN CUT, he can restore. I say, let
[1:22:47] this be known AS THE PLACE WHERE HONOR
[1:22:49] FLOWS. We're not here to lift up a man
[1:22:52] and say, "Oh, we've got the greatest
[1:22:53] general in the in the message." No,
[1:22:55] we've got messengers THAT HAVE BEEN
[1:22:57] CALLED A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY, AND LET
[1:22:59] HONOR FLOW IN THIS CHURCH. Whoever it
[1:23:01] is, I say let honor flow and let's
[1:23:04] respect one another.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Respect the message that God has given
[1:23:08] to one another. We might not understand
[1:23:10] one another and we might listen. You
[1:23:12] might not like fishing. You might not
[1:23:14] like golfing. We weren't always all
[1:23:17] meant to sit across the table and have a
[1:23:19] chat, but God PLACED ALL OF US TOGETHER.
[1:23:22] God has play Listen. And there is a
[1:23:23] friend that stickketh closer than a
[1:23:25] brother. Oh, I got no friends here.
[1:23:30] Where's Jesus at?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE GREATEST FRIEND OF ALL. YOU CAN
[1:23:34] GET MARRIED AND STILL BE LONELY. You can
[1:23:36] BE IN A CROWD AND STILL BE LONELY. BUT
[1:23:37] AS LONG AS YOU HAVE JESUS, YOU HAVE ALL
[1:23:40] THAT YOU NEED.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I say this in this church. I get it. We
[1:23:46] all have broken pieces
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; that can be mended,
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; but we have to let it be healed.
[1:23:54] We all have things in our life we do not
[1:23:56] understand,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; but God can use them for his glory
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; if you will just allow him to heal you.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's not about us. It's about
[1:24:08] him working through us. It's allowing
[1:24:10] the God that knows healing to mend our
[1:24:13] lives for us to be the best that we can
[1:24:16] be.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And I want to I want to bring this to a
[1:24:19] close with this with this principle. The
[1:24:21] scar, think about this. Scars are not
[1:24:24] just flaws to be ashamed of.
[1:24:29] They're marks of victory.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; The Kugi principle.
[1:24:37] This concept is beautifully illustrated
[1:24:39] by kugi, the Japanese art of repairing
[1:24:42] repairing broken pottery with lacquer
[1:24:45] dusted or mixed with powdered gold.
[1:24:48] The philosophy is that the piece is now
[1:24:50] more beautiful and valuable for having
[1:24:53] been broken and repaired
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; with the gold lines highlighting
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; not hiding the breakage.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Your scars
[1:25:05] are not the devil might want to put it
[1:25:07] in your life and say well you've got to
[1:25:08] hide your scars were not meant to be
[1:25:11] ashamed of
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; your scars are a sign of healing in your
[1:25:14] life
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and they're the gold lines.
[1:25:18] Hallelujah. That the devil can't take
[1:25:20] away from you because he didn't heal
[1:25:21] you.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't put you back together.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; But I know a healer of broken pieces.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know a healer of the
[1:25:29] scars.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And what is it? It's empathy and
[1:25:32] testimony. The healed scar NOW BECOMES
[1:25:34] THE MOST POWERFUL PART OF YOUR STORY. It
[1:25:37] allows YOU TO RELATE TO OTHERS who are
[1:25:40] currently in the same wound that you
[1:25:42] were. And it GIVES YOU AUTHORITY BECAUSE
[1:25:45] YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH it before. And
[1:25:47] listen, I MADE IT THROUGH IT. YOU CAN,
[1:25:49] TOO.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan WANTS TO KEEP YOU
[1:25:52] DOWN AND DEPRESSED AND BROKENHEARTED AND
[1:25:54] PLAYING THE VICTIM BECAUSE HE CAN STOP
[1:25:56] YOU FROM HELPING SOMEONE ELSE. I SAY
[1:25:58] IT'S TIME TO CLAIM OUR authority of
[1:26:00] healing. I'VE BEEN HEALED. I'VE BEEN SET
[1:26:03] FREE.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And there's nothing like
[1:26:06] that healing and power. I'll give you an
[1:26:08] example, the greatest example of all.
[1:26:10] And his name was Christ. Jesus Christ.
[1:26:12] The most profound example is Jesus
[1:26:14] Christ who could have risen with a
[1:26:16] perfect unmarred body, but he chose to
[1:26:19] retain his scars. Those scars were not a
[1:26:22] sign OF DEFEAT, BUT TRIUMPH AND PROOF OF
[1:26:25] HIS LOVE, SACRIFICE, and victory over
[1:26:27] death. And what did those scars do?
[1:26:29] Those scars helped someone who was
[1:26:31] doubting.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; He could have came up with no scars, but
[1:26:34] he kept the SCARS FOR ME. LISTEN, GOD IS
[1:26:37] going to allow you TO KEEP THOSE SCARS
[1:26:39] BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT YOU CAN
[1:26:40] HELP. THERE'S someone that you can help
[1:26:42] along the way. But you've got to stop
[1:26:44] BEING A VICTIM AND LET THE HEALER heal
[1:26:47] you.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But start moving forward and
[1:26:50] seeing those scars.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me. Help you. Help us all,
[1:26:55] Lord.
[1:26:59] [snorts]
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; These scars were lessons learned.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Things that we might have made mistakes
[1:27:03] in our own life, but God allowed it.
[1:27:06] Brother Matthew, I've I've I've even
[1:27:08] remember as a teenager going, "What can
[1:27:10] God get out of what I just went
[1:27:11] through?"
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Some 10, 15 years down the road, I'm
[1:27:15] standing in front of somebody
[1:27:17] encouraging them. I went through exactly
[1:27:19] what you went through.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Healer of the broken pieces.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Those small foxes, the little cuts, the
[1:27:29] little jabs. This is not becoming of the
[1:27:32] elect lady.
[1:27:34] We as believers are responsible and are
[1:27:37] should start taking accountability for
[1:27:40] the word that's been given in our life.
[1:27:43] I'm accountable. I'm not a I'm not a a
[1:27:47] snot-nosed teenager that has it all
[1:27:49] figured out. I'm sorry teenager. I don't
[1:27:50] mean that. Listen, we're in the age
[1:27:52] where it's not just teenagers.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know it all, but I know one
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; who is still working on me,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; still healing me.
[1:28:03] And I want to say the enemy wants to
[1:28:05] handcuff the true five-fold ministry,
[1:28:07] but let us let it be what God has
[1:28:11] intended it to be in this final days.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Preach the word.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Preach the word.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; We don't deviate from the message.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; We don't deviate from what the prophet
[1:28:22] said
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; because a prophet didn't deviate from
[1:28:25] the five-fold ministry.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; We stick with the word of God. We stay
[1:28:29] humble. Listen, each and every one of
[1:28:30] us, we all carry a ministry.
[1:28:33] Hallelujah. And whatever that ministry
[1:28:35] is, if it's only for one, I'm going to
[1:28:36] ask you, is one soul worth your entire
[1:28:38] life?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Is one soul worth it? I say let's say
[1:28:41] because you might be, I've never helped
[1:28:42] anyone, you just wait. Your life is
[1:28:45] about to help someone.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And that's why Satan is trying so hard
[1:28:49] to break you and to weaken you. But I
[1:28:51] say, you have a healer tonight. We don't
[1:28:54] need to leave this place again WITH THAT
[1:28:56] VICTIM SPIRIT. I SAY, let's leave this
[1:28:57] place knowing THAT I'VE BEEN HEALED AND
[1:29:00] I've been set free. I'm throwing down
[1:29:02] that little blade. I'm not jabbing
[1:29:04] anymore. I'M NOT CUTTING ANYMORE. BUT
[1:29:06] I'M SAYING, GOD, I'M GOING TO BACK THE
[1:29:08] MINISTRY IN PRAYER.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sit in a church and and
[1:29:11] wait for them to make a mistake.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to say, God, lead them
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; to lead me.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Musicians can come.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "And God sends a
[1:29:27] representative,
[1:29:28] and he anoints this representative and
[1:29:31] sends it into the world and the people
[1:29:33] must obey that representative.
[1:29:37] It's always been that way all down
[1:29:40] through the Bible.
[1:29:43] And it hasn't changed today.
[1:29:46] I want to say this. I'm not lifting any
[1:29:48] up man up. I don't believe that's what
[1:29:50] we're here for. But I'm lifting up the
[1:29:52] divine order of God.
[1:29:55] And the divine order of God, however it
[1:29:58] is. Listen, our only food is should not
[1:30:01] only be on a Wednesday night or not on a
[1:30:04] Sunday morning, but we feast daily upon
[1:30:07] the word by pressing play and listening
[1:30:10] to the message and reading the message.
[1:30:12] And then when we come to the house of
[1:30:13] God on the services that the doors have
[1:30:15] been open to because we do call
[1:30:17] ourselves a part of this church, I
[1:30:18] believe we should act like it and that
[1:30:20] means I get it. People are sick and I
[1:30:22] understand that. But it is the most
[1:30:24] discouraging thing to someone who is
[1:30:26] striving and praying and working and
[1:30:28] burdening for the souls [music] to see
[1:30:31] souls that just don't care.
[1:30:36] And then we come and we shake their
[1:30:37] hand. Oh, God bless you. I really
[1:30:39] enjoyed that sermon. I really enjoyed
[1:30:41] that. You just really touched my heart.
[1:30:43] And then the next service we're just
[1:30:44] don't show up. I'm not talking just
[1:30:47] simply about being in these pews because
[1:30:48] you can be here and not be here. [music]
[1:30:51] When we come here we worship. Now, we
[1:30:53] all worship different. I understand we
[1:30:55] don't all stand and we don't all this,
[1:30:57] but we come and we at least have a Did
[1:30:59] we forget it's a sacrifice of praise?
[1:31:04] God bless you [music] for being here.
[1:31:06] Those that are online that couldn't be
[1:31:08] here because of the sickness, God heal
[1:31:10] you. Go into your home and and bring
[1:31:14] forth the healing in your life.
[1:31:17] The enemy is brutal. He's brutal against
[1:31:20] the the fathers and he's brutal against
[1:31:22] the mothers and the [music] the
[1:31:23] children. But there's a healer tonight.
[1:31:26] And I can't promise a a flowery bed of
[1:31:29] ease. Trust me, I know that. But one
[1:31:32] thing I can promise is you have a friend
[1:31:34] that'll stick closer than a brother. And
[1:31:37] he said he'd never leave nor forsake
[1:31:38] you. And he wants to be with you. And he
[1:31:41] wants to be in you. And he wants to lead
[1:31:42] you and guide you. But you've got to
[1:31:44] take his divine order to heart.
[1:31:50] Lord, as we come before you,
[1:31:53] Lord, my desire, my heart's desire,
[1:31:55] Lord, and I pray that I'm just not the
[1:31:58] only one, but my heart's desire is,
[1:31:59] Lord, help me to stand in your divine
[1:32:01] will,
[1:32:04] Lord. I don't want to be in a
[1:32:05] permissive, well, I've been in it
[1:32:06] before. I don't ever want to be there
[1:32:08] again, Lord.
[1:32:10] Lord, if if something happens in my
[1:32:13] life, Father, [music] Lord, I'm praying
[1:32:14] this prayer because I need your help,
[1:32:16] Lord. But I I want to be able to react
[1:32:19] as a believer, respond as a believer. I
[1:32:23] I want to be able to to be the elect
[1:32:27] bride that you've called me to be, Lord.
[1:32:30] And God, I know that there's there's a
[1:32:32] lot of cuts perhaps in the church
[1:32:34] tonight. There's maybe some broken
[1:32:36] pottery, Lord, in the building tonight.
[1:32:38] But Lord, may they admit, Father, their
[1:32:42] condition. And may they stand before you
[1:32:45] as it were spiritually and say, "Lord, I
[1:32:47] I'm nothing without you. I need you."
[1:32:51] May there be [music] honest hearts
[1:32:52] tonight.
[1:32:55] I I want to ask you, Life Tabernacle
[1:32:58] this evening, as our heads are bowed,
[1:33:01] would you want to be honest with him
[1:33:03] this evening? and maybe simply of the
[1:33:05] uplifting of hand or standing in his
[1:33:07] presence and say Lord there is some
[1:33:09] healing I need in my life father [music]
[1:33:12] and and I want to give it to you father
[1:33:14] and I want to I want to admit it not
[1:33:15] please don't just do this out of
[1:33:16] tradition from your heart
[1:33:19] I want to be able to help Lord and and I
[1:33:23] want you to lead me but father I've
[1:33:24] allowed maybe and I'm just saying all
[1:33:26] kinds of things so you're not just
[1:33:27] standing for this but maybe there's
[1:33:29] someone that has allowed some jealousy
[1:33:31] maybe there's someone that has allowed
[1:33:32] some malice
[1:33:33] Maybe there's been a lot of questions in
[1:33:35] your mind and and it's been weakening
[1:33:37] you. Say, "Lord, here am I. I don't I
[1:33:41] actually realize I don't need all those
[1:33:42] answers. [music] I just need to trust
[1:33:44] you. I just need to take you at your
[1:33:47] word tonight. I don't need to know how
[1:33:49] everything's going, Lord. I just need to
[1:33:51] trust you. I just need to Listen,
[1:33:53] there's things we don't need to know.
[1:33:55] Life tabernacle,
[1:33:57] we just need to trust him. Do you
[1:34:00] believe God has called you to this area?
[1:34:02] Do you believe God has called you to
[1:34:04] this message? [music] If you believe God
[1:34:06] has truly called you to this message and
[1:34:08] you know who you are in this word, then
[1:34:10] you simply have to take him at his word.
[1:34:12] He didn't bring you this far to leave
[1:34:14] you. He's not going to drop you at the
[1:34:16] end. He's going to take you all the way
[1:34:18] through. We're not dying tonight. I'm
[1:34:21] being healed.
[1:34:24] And these scars in my life, God's going
[1:34:27] to get the victory for them. Will you
[1:34:30] claim that tonight? Lord, you see the
[1:34:31] hearts that have been the hands [music]
[1:34:33] that were raised, those that have stood.
[1:34:35] Thank you for their honesty. Father, we
[1:34:37] pray. Lord, we ask that you would just
[1:34:39] move now as we step into this mode of
[1:34:41] worship, Lord. Lord, we do not do this
[1:34:43] out of tradition, but Father, because we
[1:34:46] recognize as believers this evening how
[1:34:48] much we need you and how much we're
[1:34:50] nothing without you. Let's sing it now.
[1:34:52] Healer of the broken [music and singing]
[1:34:54] pieces. Can we stand together and
[1:34:57] worship the Lord?
[1:34:59] You touched my [music] heart and made it
[1:35:03] new.
[1:35:05] [music]
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; My whole life. [singing]
[1:35:10] Will you surrender again tonight?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Just [music] do it one more time.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; My [singing] heart to you.
[1:35:22] Love [singing]
[1:35:23] that sought [music] before I knew you.
[1:35:28] Hallelujah.
[1:35:30] Has [music] brought me near to where
[1:35:32] [singing] you are.
[1:35:39] Now I live to praise [music and singing]
[1:35:41] you.
[1:35:43] Ever may I praise you,
[1:35:47] healer [music] of my Oh, sing it again
[1:35:50] now. Healer of the broken pieces.
[1:35:53] Oh, healer of the [singing] broken
[1:35:56] [music] pieces.
[1:36:01] You [singing] touched my heart and made
[1:36:04] it new. [music]
[1:36:06] Oh, thank you for doing that, Lord.
[1:36:09] Now my [singing] whole life I surrender.
[1:36:13] Lay it down [music] before the men.
[1:36:17] Lord, I give [singing] my heart all to
[1:36:20] you.
[1:36:24] Love that [music and singing] song
[1:36:26] before I knew you
[1:36:32] has brought me here to [music] where you
[1:36:35] are. [singing]
[1:36:40] Oh, now I [music and singing] live to
[1:36:43] praise you.
[1:36:45] Ever I praise you, the healer
[1:36:49] [music and singing] of my heart.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Love that song before I knew you. Aren't
[1:36:53] you glad he was seeking you? Love
[1:36:55] [music and singing]
[1:36:56] this song before I knew you.
[1:37:02] [music]
[1:37:03] Brought me to where you are.
[1:37:11] Oh
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; my praise.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:16] [music]
[1:37:17] May I praise you,
[1:37:20] healer of [singing] my [music] heart.
[1:37:24] The key of F or F. Either way is fine.
[1:37:28] You know the song, Consume Me, Lord.
[1:37:29] [music] I might sing it a little
[1:37:31] different, but let's just try. Consume
[1:37:32] me Lord with the fire of your spirit.
[1:37:34] Consume me Lord and make me more like
[1:37:36] you. Amen. Consume
[1:37:41] me [singing] Lord
[1:37:45] with the [music] fire of [singing]
[1:37:48] your spirit.
[1:37:50] Maybe your heart now consume
[1:37:52] [music and singing]
[1:37:54] me Lord
[1:37:58] [music]
[1:37:59] and make [singing] me more like you.
[1:38:05] Oh, and raise [singing and music]
[1:38:09] me, Lord,
[1:38:13] and bless the broken [music]
[1:38:17] [singing] pieces
[1:38:19] of my life.
[1:38:26] Oh, [singing and music] let me be used.
[1:38:30] Is that your [music] desire tonight? Oh,
[1:38:33] by
[1:38:35] you. Do you really know what you're
[1:38:36] singing? You're asking [music] for a
[1:38:38] lot, but mean it from your heart now.
[1:38:40] Oh, [singing] consume
[1:38:44] me, Lord.
[1:38:46] God bless you, church. [music]
[1:38:48] With the fire of your spirit.
[1:38:54] Oh, consume [music and singing]
[1:38:58] me, Lord.
[1:39:02] and make me
[1:39:09] [music]
[1:39:12] Lord
[1:39:16] and bless the broken
[1:39:19] pieces [music]
[1:39:21] of my life.
[1:39:28] Can we be [music] you?
[1:39:35] [music]
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] You know, [music] I I just thought as
[1:39:45] brother Jeremy preached
[1:39:48] how blessed we are.
[1:39:52] You know, [music] can you imagine
[1:39:56] a five-fold ministry
[1:39:59] just ran by men?
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't know where to go or or who
[1:40:04] to follow.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; But we've all been purchased [music]
[1:40:09] with the same price.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Didn't pay more for you than he paid for
[1:40:16] you. And we all have an absolute.
[1:40:20] We all have the same absolute. [music]
[1:40:24] And if I had a message book, I'd hold it
[1:40:26] up. The We all have the same revealed
[1:40:30] word of God that we can all listen to
[1:40:33] [music] and follow together. That's what
[1:40:37] does away with all the big eyes's and
[1:40:40] the little U's.
[1:40:43] Is the absoluteness of God's word.
[1:40:45] [music]
[1:40:47] And if all of us would just commit our
[1:40:50] hearts and our lives
[1:40:52] to that word, we'd all be living
[1:40:57] like little messiahs,
[1:41:00] praying and helping and because [music]
[1:41:03] we know where we come from. And even in
[1:41:06] the statue of the perfect man, I thought
[1:41:09] [music] how Peter said, "A man that
[1:41:11] doesn't add these things can't see a far
[1:41:15] off." [music] and has forgot where he's
[1:41:18] come from. So that's the beauty of our
[1:41:22] unity.
[1:41:24] That's the beauty of our calling.
[1:41:27] It wasn't something we could join. It
[1:41:30] was something we were elected to, that
[1:41:33] we've been called to. [clears throat]
[1:41:35] And we all have the same voice
[1:41:38] that we can hear. That ought to cause
[1:41:41] the greatest unity and love amongst one
[1:41:44] another. and
[1:41:47] and through life, you know, it [music]
[1:41:49] never never hurts for you to
[1:41:53] go out and bear somebody's burden.
[1:41:57] Tell them, you know, I know you're going
[1:41:58] through a lot. I [music] I want you to
[1:42:00] know I'm praying for you. Is there
[1:42:03] anything I can do to help you? You know,
[1:42:07] don't ever cast draw circles and put
[1:42:10] people out. Draw circles and bring them
[1:42:13] in closer. Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You know, [music] cuz it won't
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; really
[1:42:21] what can hurt me.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; My feelings get hurt, but I I possess
[1:42:26] something that I know was given to me by
[1:42:29] God.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And that's one thing the devil can't do.
[1:42:34] I like that saying, "Sticks and stones
[1:42:36] may hurt, may break my bones, but the
[1:42:40] devil will never deceive me."
[1:42:43] Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; I made that up.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; But that's how we feel.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; So you you I just hope that you see what
[1:42:54] Brother Jeremy is saying. We have
[1:42:56] something above all our feelings and
[1:42:58] above all our emotions that we can rise
[1:43:02] up to. That's life. And it it's not just
[1:43:06] you. It's the people he's put around
[1:43:08] you. [music] He's purchased with the
[1:43:10] same price and given them the same
[1:43:12] absolute. That ought to be a fellowship
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; one for another. And the spirit of
[1:43:19] Antichrist is a spirit that breaks
[1:43:21] fellowship.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; So, we just have such a thing to draw
[1:43:24] together around [music] and lift this
[1:43:27] word up and lift this message up. I
[1:43:30] think it's it's wonderful tonight.
[1:43:33] [music] And the closer you get to the
[1:43:35] word, the more that you listen and the
[1:43:38] more that it teaches you, the more you
[1:43:41] become Christlike and more the character
[1:43:45] of [music] Jesus Christ is identified in
[1:43:48] you. Amen. Let's sing this song as that
[1:43:52] we turn it. Amen.
[1:43:54] Oh, I know the time is near where
[1:43:59] everything that I hold dear
[1:44:04] before.
[1:44:06] [music]
[1:44:12] All my words [music] and all my deeds.
[1:44:15] [singing]
[1:44:16] Every
[1:44:18] on my knees
[1:44:21] before
[1:44:23] [music]
[1:44:25] to be [singing] fire.
[1:44:29] All I [music] want to see
[1:44:33] is Jesus.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:38] All I [music] want to see
[1:44:41] is in me.
[1:44:46] All I [music and singing] want to see is
[1:44:50] Jesus
[1:44:54] shine [music]
[1:44:58] through [singing] me.
[1:45:03] burden shelf [music] afflicted [singing]
[1:45:05] pain and everything that I thought gave
[1:45:11] away before [music]
[1:45:13] the holy
[1:45:15] cons [singing]
[1:45:22] [music]
[1:45:28] [singing and music] before the Lord.
[1:45:30] Holy
[1:45:32] shing
[1:45:34] fire.
[1:45:36] All [music and singing] I want to see is
[1:45:40] Jesus.
[1:45:43] [music]
[1:45:45] All I want to see
[1:45:48] is

[1:46:50] Oh, and all I want to see

[1:51:09] Brother Matthew, forget your comment.
[1:51:10] That's this tonight.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your holy name. Hallelujah.
[1:51:30] Lord, we
[1:51:32] we're just humbled to be in your
[1:51:33] presence tonight.
[1:51:38] Lord, we know that there would be no
[1:51:40] flesh that could stand in your presence,
[1:51:44] Lord. for
[1:51:47] there's no righteousness of man that
[1:51:50] could ever be good enough or qualify to
[1:51:52] be in your presence.
[1:51:55] Lord, your grace and your mercy made a
[1:51:57] way that a a sinner could be forgiven.
[1:52:01] Not just forgiven, but we could be
[1:52:04] justified. That
[1:52:07] we never did it in the first place.
[1:52:11] Lord, we thank you for that revelation
[1:52:13] in this hour that
[1:52:15] allows us the freedom and the liberty to
[1:52:18] know that in your presence is fullness
[1:52:20] of joy and life. And [music] with a pure
[1:52:24] heart, we can worship you in spirit and
[1:52:26] in truth. And we're not victims. We
[1:52:29] don't have to
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; worry about the hardships and the hurt
[1:52:34] and the pain that we've gone through.
[1:52:37] Lord, your word says that
[1:52:40] all things work together for good to
[1:52:43] them that love God and are called
[1:52:44] according to your purpose. Lord, there's
[1:52:47] none good but you. And Lord, by
[1:52:51] revelation, we see that it's just the
[1:52:53] perfecting of our character. And
[1:52:56] Lord, that it's your life that's being
[1:52:59] molded and developed inside of us.
[1:53:02] Lord, though we feel cut and we feel
[1:53:04] wounded, we feel bruised.
[1:53:07] Lord, you said, "Marvel not that the
[1:53:09] world hates you, for they hated me,
[1:53:13] Lord." So, we realize that this is just
[1:53:16] part of the journey on this side as a
[1:53:19] Christlike character is being molded in
[1:53:21] us, Lord. And I thank you for the
[1:53:23] message that we've heard tonight,
[1:53:26] Lord, that gives us the ammunition
[1:53:29] needed to realize that a lot of the
[1:53:33] pain, a lot of the suffering and the
[1:53:36] hurts and things that we've gone
[1:53:37] through, [music] Lord, is just
[1:53:40] opportunities for a Christlike character
[1:53:42] to be developed in us.
[1:53:44] Lord, just as you kept your scars, Lord,
[1:53:47] it was your very scars that you would
[1:53:49] say to Thomas, Thomas, see the scars.
[1:53:53] Reach your hand to my side. I am the
[1:53:56] Christ, a risen Lord. And Father, we
[1:53:59] maybe have been bruised. We've been
[1:54:01] hurt. We've been battered. We've come
[1:54:02] from uh uh uh what would seem to be
[1:54:05] wrecked lives and family backgrounds,
[1:54:07] Lord. But but it was your grace and your
[1:54:09] mercy that's pulled us up out of the
[1:54:11] muck and out of the mire. Maybe lives
[1:54:13] that have been seemed to be torn apart
[1:54:16] by family situations and maybe ruined by
[1:54:19] drugs and alcohol. Oh, but your grace
[1:54:22] and your mercy, you reached out into the
[1:54:24] ashes. You reached out into the muck.
[1:54:27] You reached out into the mire, Lord, and
[1:54:30] you resurrected a people out of the
[1:54:32] mire, Lord. And you set us up upon a
[1:54:35] strong rock of revelation that you're
[1:54:37] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:54:39] And now, Lord, this isn't the time to be
[1:54:41] the victim. This is the time to shine
[1:54:44] the greatest light that has ever shined
[1:54:46] unto mankind. And to declare unto a
[1:54:49] dying generation that you are alive and
[1:54:52] what you did for me, you could do for
[1:54:54] others. Lord, let us go into the
[1:54:56] highways and into the byways and say,
[1:54:58] "Christ is alive. He is risen amongst
[1:55:02] us, the [music] same yesterday, today,
[1:55:04] and forever. You are not dead, but what
[1:55:06] you've done for me, you can do for
[1:55:08] others. Lord, we thank you for such a
[1:55:11] message. We thank you for a word. We
[1:55:13] thank you coming and visiting us tonight
[1:55:15] to know Lord that you care.
[1:55:18] Lord, you're mindful of our needs, Lord.
[1:55:21] I can testify there's situations and a
[1:55:24] and lives present amongst us, Lord. And
[1:55:27] you took the gift. You took the
[1:55:29] five-fold ministry and you spoke words
[1:55:32] of life and healing and deliverance,
[1:55:34] Lord. that we can walk out of our
[1:55:36] prisons and we can walk away uh uh from
[1:55:38] a victim mentality and know that we
[1:55:41] truly are set free and we have a liberty
[1:55:43] by the Holy Ghost to go forth as a a
[1:55:46] victorious conqueror in the name of
[1:55:49] Jesus Christ. Lord, we love you. We just
[1:55:52] commit, brother Jeremy, to you and his
[1:55:54] wife. May you continue to build them up,
[1:55:56] Lord, and and to strengthen them and
[1:55:58] continue to give life prevailing
[1:56:00] revelation. May you strengthen their
[1:56:02] little flock there in Amarillo, Lord.
[1:56:04] how much we love them and appreciate
[1:56:06] their light that they're shining. Oh
[1:56:08] God, it could be there that they catch
[1:56:10] the last one. Could be here. Lord, may
[1:56:13] we have a heart for the lost ones, Lord.
[1:56:17] Look out upon the needs of one another,
[1:56:19] especially those of the household of
[1:56:21] faith. We love you, Lord, and we just
[1:56:23] commit the assembly to you, Lord, and
[1:56:26] ask that you would be with those that
[1:56:28] weren't able to be here, Lord, in the
[1:56:30] needs that were represented amongst us.
[1:56:32] We know Lord Jesus that you're mindful
[1:56:34] of them all. We just ask that you go
[1:56:36] with us now. May you be our portion.
[1:56:39] Just pour back into our precious brother
[1:56:41] who poured out Lord 100fold. I pray we
[1:56:44] love you. We ask these things in your
[1:56:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:56:50] Amen. God bless you are dismissed.
