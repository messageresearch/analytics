[32:44] gracious Heavenly Father you are still
[32:46] taking the things which are wrong and
[32:48] making them right
[32:49] father we stand on the this side of the
[32:52] Fall where sin is entered in and or
[32:54] there's many things that we don't
[32:56] understand that don't make sense and
[32:58] father there's a day that we'll talk it
[33:00] all over when it's all clear and we have
[33:04] a perfect understanding and we no longer
[33:07] look through a glass Darkly but we
[33:09] clearly understand
[33:10] the way we went and why we went those
[33:14] ways and father we know now that it's
[33:16] all to your glory
[33:18] and maybe even why we don't understand
[33:19] it you're still working things to your
[33:21] good father the
[33:24] the things that were meant for wrong you
[33:27] will take and use them for the right
[33:30] Lord we thank you that we can stand here
[33:32] that we can
[33:34] Fellowship around the things of
[33:38] Eternal value Lord that lives can be
[33:40] changed and Lord you can draw near us
[33:43] and walk and talk with us along the way
[33:45] Commit This service to you father we ask
[33:48] that you would have the preeminence that
[33:49] it wouldn't be man that we could step
[33:51] aside father this is your bride that you
[33:54] could speak to her
[33:56] Lord we long to hear your voice Commit
[33:59] This service to you Jesus Christ name we
[34:02] pray amen amen if you have your Bibles
[34:07] may do a couple scripture readings but
[34:10] we'll just
[34:11] let the Lord have his way we're going to
[34:13] read out of the Book of Genesis
[34:16] the first chapter
[34:26] 26th verse
[34:32] and God said let us make man in our
[34:34] image after our likeness
[34:37] and let him have dominion over the fish
[34:39] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[34:41] and over the cattle and over all the
[34:44] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[34:46] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[34:49] man in his own image
[34:51] in the image of God created him Mel and
[34:54] female
[34:55] created he them
[34:57] God bless you you may be seated
[35:06] there's two books of the Bible that the
[35:09] devil hates the most it's the Book of
[35:10] Genesis in the Book of Revelations
[35:13] because in the Book of Genesis we see
[35:16] the beginning of all things we see
[35:19] things
[35:20] as they're intended to be Jesus would
[35:24] even say because of the hardness of your
[35:26] heart you sought to put away your wives
[35:29] but from the beginning it wasn't so and
[35:32] he's he's speaking back to
[35:35] things that are spoken right in the Book
[35:37] of Genesis HID from the wise and prudent
[35:41] and even in that that scripture reading
[35:43] where Jesus says that he he confounds
[35:46] them
[35:47] you know they they brought to him a
[35:49] parable and they said hey this man he's
[35:53] been married
[35:54] seven times or this what woman's been
[35:57] married seven times one to each brother
[35:59] and just on down
[36:01] who's who's bride will he will she be in
[36:06] eternity
[36:08] not knowing they're speaking to the very
[36:10] author of The Plan of Salvation the one
[36:13] who's had a heart intent in how Man was
[36:16] created and he answers them
[36:19] the sons of God are neither married nor
[36:21] given into marriage but we see uh that
[36:25] here that's
[36:27] um
[36:28] that was free so we'll just hopefully
[36:31] proceed in the thought we want to
[36:32] Fellowship around the image of God and I
[36:35] believe there's a lot of Liberty that we
[36:37] can have a freedom we could have an
[36:39] understanding uh whose image we're made
[36:41] in there's a a turmoil as as you grow
[36:46] and you find that you have something
[36:49] that is uh made after a different nature
[36:53] and you can definitely say well I don't
[36:57] believe that to be the image of God God
[37:00] doesn't steal God doesn't cheat God
[37:03] doesn't bear fault with false witness
[37:05] but I find that
[37:08] when I was growing up I for some reason
[37:10] when I was at the Piggly Wiggly that
[37:13] pack of gum looked really good
[37:15] and I took that pack of gum now
[37:20] my mom knows I didn't have any money
[37:23] and now Davey Jr is chewing on some gum
[37:29] where did you where did you get the gum
[37:34] you know I don't even remember what I
[37:36] said but it didn't take her long to
[37:37] figure out that you know I'd taken it
[37:39] and in the I get taken back to apologize
[37:42] to the store manager but where did that
[37:44] nature come on come in what was that
[37:46] image what is that image declaring
[37:49] and that causes I think a lot of
[37:52] confusion for us as growing up because
[37:54] we don't understand sin nature we don't
[37:57] understand why that has to be a part of
[37:59] who we we are but we're set in a battle
[38:03] and the the word of God has given to us
[38:06] for us to overcome so we just want to
[38:08] Fellowship around what your true image
[38:11] is and it
[38:14] the desire to manifest that if you uh
[38:17] look over in the Book of Genesis just
[38:20] maybe across the margin in chapter two
[38:23] you'll find that there's
[38:25] a further creation
[38:28] and the brother Branham speaks to this
[38:31] beautifully and questions and answers on
[38:33] the Book of Genesis he walks us through
[38:36] the very creation of God I believe that
[38:40] was preached in 53.
[38:43] um
[38:43] might have the date in here
[38:47] somewhere but
[38:48] questions of books about questions and
[38:51] answers on the Book of Genesis
[38:53] these two creations of Adam are pondered
[38:56] at by theologians by men and I had a
[38:58] friend Brother Scott Walker he's going
[39:00] to Baylor
[39:02] having to do seminaries a minimal
[39:05] class and they look at these two
[39:09] scriptures and they think it must be two
[39:11] different authors and these books have
[39:13] just been combined together because in
[39:15] second chapter
[39:17] there's another creation
[39:19] and that you can read in the in the
[39:21] fifth verse it says God
[39:23] had not caused the rain it had not
[39:27] caused it to rain upon the Earth and
[39:29] there was not a man to till the ground
[39:32] so here's Adam created
[39:36] male and female created he them he's in
[39:39] the image of God we know God is a spirit
[39:41] the truth that this message has brought
[39:45] us
[39:46] in the it
[39:49] we take it for granted I mean we just
[39:52] we've been given the very thought intent
[39:55] heartbeat of God
[39:57] by a god-ordained prophet who can open
[40:02] and I I'm probably gonna do a bit of
[40:04] reading because this is one of my
[40:05] favorite
[40:07] uh
[40:09] Mysteries being revealed
[40:11] of the understanding of this scripture
[40:14] so now Adam has made
[40:17] and the Lord formed man of the Dust of
[40:20] the ground and breathed into his nostril
[40:23] a breath of life and Man became a living
[40:26] soul
[40:27] so you have a spirit man
[40:31] you have to understand that your
[40:33] Spiritual Beings there was an image of
[40:36] God that was created that was a spirit
[40:38] man
[40:39] male and female created he them
[40:42] then he creates a body out of the Flesh
[40:46] of the Earth the dust of this Earth
[40:50] what is it of the Earth
[40:53] the dust of this Earth
[40:54] and then he breathes into it and gives
[40:56] it life that Spirit now Tabernacles into
[41:00] a body
[41:02] the beautiful thing is is this is God
[41:04] unfolding
[41:07] and he follows this pattern
[41:10] right onto where he takes Eve
[41:13] out of Adam
[41:15] so it's gonna hopefully uh
[41:18] try to read some of this
[41:24] God created man male and female created
[41:27] man male and female now that's think
[41:30] about the first point now in Genesis 2 7
[41:32] it was he formed
[41:34] underscored but first he created
[41:40] Hallelujah
[41:41] he got then he got that underscored and
[41:44] he's talking about the question
[41:45] Man Out of the Dust and breathed into
[41:48] his nostrils and so forth now what is
[41:51] the difference or where is the
[41:53] connection to the above scriptures
[41:54] they're they're asking how can this atom
[41:57] be created and then this atom be created
[42:00] and and how can they be connected I find
[42:02] we ask ourselves the same question still
[42:05] to this day how can this thing right
[42:08] here
[42:09] how can this be David McGeary when
[42:11] there's something else inside of me that
[42:14] has another identity
[42:16] that's in the image of God but
[42:19] what's this
[42:22] amen
[42:24] so I'll be skipping around a bit I hope
[42:26] you could try to keep up with me
[42:28] but I I am going to be reading probably
[42:31] primarily from here
[42:34] amen
[42:39] 15th uh
[42:42] chapter there he says well now if you'll
[42:44] notice close Genesis 1 28 6 let's get
[42:48] the first part of this God said let us
[42:51] let us now let us us
[42:54] make man in our own image of course we
[42:57] realize he's talking to someone
[43:00] so he even steps back
[43:03] and follow the pattern
[43:06] there was something unfolding already at
[43:09] that point now that man's ran off and
[43:11] and made three persons of a trinity
[43:14] but this is a pro prophets view now we
[43:18] get to go with him
[43:19] into a mystery that was to be revealed
[43:23] at this last time if you notice in
[43:25] creation the first thing was created of
[43:27] course was light
[43:28] you come on down through creation the
[43:30] last thing was created what was man and
[43:32] woman was made after man all right first
[43:36] last thing that was created God creation
[43:38] is mankind but when God made his first
[43:42] man if you notice he made him in the
[43:44] likeness of himself he was made in the
[43:47] image of God and what was it God now we
[43:50] find out God
[43:52] a kind of man he was made he goes
[43:55] through he talks about
[43:57] how God's a spirit
[43:58] down in the 20th he says now the next
[44:01] verse is I want God is a spirit and they
[44:03] that was that worship Him must worship
[44:06] Him in spirit and in truth now if God
[44:09] created man on his in his own image in
[44:11] his own likeness what kind of man did he
[44:14] create as Spirit man
[44:17] amen
[44:21] he had made all creation and created a
[44:23] spirit man the close reading of this now
[44:26] and the question that God give dominion
[44:28] of the cattle the fishes and everything
[44:30] to the man but his making up there he
[44:34] made man in his own image to lead the
[44:35] cattle
[44:36] lead the Beast of the field like the
[44:39] Holy Spirit leads the believer today
[44:42] so what was the pattern Dominion
[44:45] what are we to be led by the spirit
[44:47] what's it to have dominion and you you
[44:50] catch a vision when you start to think
[44:53] of a man who's going to go and have
[44:54] dominion over a field he's going to be
[44:58] wanting to express something in the way
[45:01] he would have dominion you know you know
[45:03] today the Sheep should go up on the hill
[45:06] I you know what I I want to I see this
[45:10] move this way do this and he's speaking
[45:13] to the very creation because he's
[45:15] orchestrating something that is pleasing
[45:18] to him what is our desire to be pleasing
[45:22] to the Lord we want the Holy Spirit to
[45:25] if something's out of order when Christ
[45:27] was here he comes upon a tree that's not
[45:30] bearing fruit
[45:31] it's not even in its season it's not
[45:33] supposed to bear fruit but if it's the
[45:36] Creator what was it given
[45:38] to be pleasing to him
[45:41] he's the only one who could sit there
[45:43] this isn't pleasing to me
[45:45] you're not manifesting what I would
[45:47] desire you to manifest and he curses it
[45:51] and and that's the Dominion we have
[45:53] we're very the nature itself is subject
[45:55] to us that's the image of God the and
[45:58] the Dominion we're to have
[46:00] amen
[46:01] now this is where he gets gets beautiful
[46:05] now if God created man his own image in
[46:07] his own likeness he created them God
[46:09] give dominion cattle 22. he was in other
[46:12] words Adam was the first man in the
[46:14] lower creation the first creation of God
[46:16] himself out of God came to logos which
[46:19] was the son of God then out of the logos
[46:21] which was the word the beginning of the
[46:23] word the word was with was God the Word
[46:25] was God the word was made flesh and
[46:27] dwelt amongst us out of the logos came
[46:30] forth the man
[46:31] oh I got a beautiful picture in my mind
[46:34] now I can take a little trip with me
[46:36] take a look can you take a trip with me
[46:41] and go back a little while
[46:43] let our minds right now
[46:46] we're going to talk about
[46:48] and he takes us back a hundred million
[46:51] years before there ever was a star
[46:54] a moon
[46:55] or anything in the world to do that we
[46:58] understand now what the the speed of
[47:00] light is
[47:01] you know you you we look at it this way
[47:03] you know if you can see it you know 10
[47:06] million light years out there and that
[47:07] light is just getting to you then that
[47:09] light took 10 million years to get to
[47:11] you he's saying let's just speed up now
[47:13] he steps past the speed of light he
[47:17] steps back into before there was a
[47:20] molecule or anything and he's going to
[47:22] tell us how this creation started to
[47:25] come about how God could say let us how
[47:29] can he say let us what what transpired
[47:31] at the before the very book of gen when
[47:34] he's saying let us make man in our in
[47:36] our image now he's going to reveal that
[47:39] mystery because we're not trinitarians
[47:43] but that's our scripture
[47:45] it's been manhandled it's been perverted
[47:48] but we need we can see the true word of
[47:51] God
[47:53] amen
[47:57] now
[47:59] looking at beyond the banister see what
[48:01] things happening now no man has seen the
[48:03] father at any time no man can see God in
[48:07] the body form because God is not a body
[48:09] God is a spirit no man has seen the
[48:12] father but the only begotten of the
[48:13] father have to clear them
[48:15] but notice there's nothing just space No
[48:19] Light
[48:20] no Darkness there's nothing
[48:25] nothing
[48:28] you can't comprehend nothing if you
[48:31] think you're following me I still don't
[48:32] understand nothing all right
[48:34] but we by faith can say things we don't
[48:37] understand
[48:39] we believe it
[48:42] all right
[48:43] God supernatural being Jehovah God who
[48:47] covered all space of all things all time
[48:50] he was Everlasting from ever outlasting
[48:53] he's the beginning of the creation
[48:54] that's God
[48:56] amen by him all things are made amen
[49:00] can't see nothing
[49:02] can't hear nothing nothing
[49:05] not a move of an atom in the air not
[49:08] nothing
[49:10] no nothing but yet God was there
[49:13] Hallelujah
[49:15] now watch a few minutes
[49:17] Hallelujah
[49:19] that's the father
[49:22] it's nothing to express them
[49:26] has it even started to form anything yet
[49:29] you see a loneliness there I mean
[49:31] there's nothing
[49:33] but there's now a heart and tent is
[49:35] going to start to unfold
[49:39] down in 30.
[49:41] now no one has seen God now the next
[49:45] thing we begin to see by the eyes of
[49:46] Supernatural looking amen we got
[49:49] Supernatural eyesight by a supernatural
[49:51] message amen
[49:53] see a little light forming out there
[49:56] what was that that was called by the
[49:59] Bible readers logos the anointed or the
[50:02] anointing as it was going to say the
[50:05] part of God being developed into
[50:07] something so human beings could have
[50:10] some type of an idea of what it was
[50:14] a little light
[50:17] moving that was the word of God
[50:21] amen
[50:22] now God gave himself birth to the son
[50:24] which was before there was even an atom
[50:28] now we have sonship now we have father
[50:30] amen
[50:33] the heir to make an atom see Jesus said
[50:36] glorify me father with the glory that we
[50:39] had before the foundation of the world
[50:41] see way back Yonder now
[50:46] I'm going to move on down I I could uh
[50:49] we could just play the tape I agree but
[50:51] this is this is life to me there's some
[50:53] that some things I just want to
[50:55] highlight and then we'll just let the
[50:56] Lord have the Liberty but just follow me
[50:57] now we're setting the platform on what
[51:01] we just want to Fellowship about the
[51:02] image that we're made in
[51:04] and to understand it you really do have
[51:07] to go back
[51:08] and see it in the in the beginning so
[51:10] we're just going to step through it
[51:12] 34th paragraph and when he did an atom
[51:15] bursted and the sun came into existence
[51:18] when he said let there be light just
[51:20] before he says I can hear him say let
[51:22] there be light and what did that come
[51:24] from we know that came from Christ
[51:27] and then he said Adam bursted into the
[51:29] sun came into existence she Whirled for
[51:32] a hundred of millions of years forming
[51:34] clinkers burning
[51:37] then down in 35 now watch now beautiful
[51:39] he made the Sun and then the first thing
[51:42] you know a big clinker fell off of it
[51:44] weighed about as much as the Earth went
[51:49] then the logos here now the Son of God
[51:51] is watching it amen
[51:54] is watching his creation unfold he says
[51:59] 100 Millionaires and he stops it
[52:02] the same God who hung the stars and told
[52:05] them where to shine is the same God who
[52:07] can say stop
[52:08] no further don't go anymore you could be
[52:12] at a point in your life and many will
[52:13] testify to it that there came a point
[52:15] where it was stopped that's the last
[52:17] time
[52:18] my brother Matthew tells a testimony of
[52:20] where he he was not in the place he was
[52:22] supposed to be doing things he wasn't
[52:24] supposed to be doing yet God could
[52:26] apprehend that falling star that clinker
[52:28] that's just shooting off and say stop
[52:31] no more we were all going straight we
[52:34] were just traveling through space we
[52:36] were a little light we didn't know where
[52:38] we didn't even know how we're to be hung
[52:41] our position
[52:42] the place we would be we're just
[52:45] going through space and time no
[52:47] understanding but God had a picture and
[52:50] he said stop
[52:52] right there he hung you right there the
[52:54] same creation pattern a principle
[52:58] he takes things that seem to make no
[53:00] sense have no order
[53:03] and he hangs him right where he wants
[53:05] him to be he's forming the very Stars
[53:07] you look out in the sky the same way
[53:10] and what are they doing
[53:12] now he's got something in his mind what
[53:15] is he doing he's writing this first
[53:18] Bible
[53:19] Hallelujah
[53:21] the first Bible was ever looked at in
[53:23] the Stars was the Zodiac and it's
[53:25] perfect
[53:26] it's just dovetailed with the Bible it
[53:28] starts out first through a virgin the
[53:30] second then he comes the line of the
[53:32] tribe of Judah draw it all out the
[53:34] cancer age and everything gone down now
[53:37] he put that all in the sky and placed it
[53:39] all all these meteors
[53:42] he goes in and he says science today
[53:44] will try to tell you those things and
[53:46] they'll go land on it you know they do
[53:48] it now they go land on a I guess a
[53:50] meteor an asteroid and they
[53:53] grab some of the dust from it and drill
[53:56] and get a Core sample and they take it
[53:58] back to Earth and they say
[54:02] this is a million billion years old
[54:06] there can't be no Creation in seven days
[54:08] they just didn't hear the message
[54:13] they didn't understand how God formed it
[54:16] he didn't their the them in their wisdom
[54:18] it's been hit from them
[54:21] amen
[54:25] paragraph 42 and now we get to Genesis 1
[54:28] we get to the Bible out of the picture
[54:30] Genesis the world was formed and void
[54:33] water upon the face of the deep and the
[54:36] spirit of God moved upon the Water
[54:38] Hallelujah
[54:40] he Broods
[54:42] how does he do it how does he start to
[54:44] cause something to to take form by his
[54:48] spirit
[54:49] he brewed he's a brooder I mean he
[54:52] reflects that all through nature our
[54:55] Prophet taught us you could take a puppy
[54:56] dog and tie it down on an egg and it'll
[54:58] create the right atmosphere to hatch an
[55:00] egg what do we believe in we believe in
[55:02] the Holy Spirit coming brooding over his
[55:04] word
[55:05] allowing it to come to pass you you have
[55:09] to have atmosphere
[55:13] you have to have the spirit he created
[55:16] the very Earth that way
[55:18] it's in a time it's in a season it's
[55:21] unfolding God has principles he has
[55:23] patterns amen
[55:29] amen
[55:32] 43
[55:34] and he got all these things together
[55:36] made all these things all the animal
[55:37] life the birds the bees the monkeys and
[55:39] whatever it was put all of it in the
[55:41] earth and he asked the question let us
[55:43] who Father and Son make man in our own
[55:46] image
[55:48] 45 now the man
[55:51] led the cattle and everything just like
[55:54] the Holy Spirit leads a real True
[55:55] Believer today the voice of God out
[55:57] there the voice of man rather could
[55:59] speak and say call the cattle this way
[56:01] call the Sheep over to the pasture call
[56:03] the fishes to the water amen
[56:06] now he was laying there 47. you can have
[56:10] a picture Adam standing this way see him
[56:13] standing there like a tree God made him
[56:16] he was dead as he could be
[56:19] this is and to he's referring to the
[56:23] Genesis 2 now
[56:27] he was dead as he could be his toes like
[56:29] Roots sticking into the ground and God
[56:31] said let there be breathe the breath of
[56:34] life into him and he jumped came to
[56:36] himself he was breathed the Breath of
[56:39] Life in him he became a living soul
[56:43] amen
[56:46] he made the butter the we'll just read
[56:50] this out and then God taken from his
[56:52] side a piece of a rib and made a woman
[56:55] where did he get the spirit of a woman
[56:58] see
[56:59] in 126. let us make man in our own image
[57:03] after our own likeness created he them
[57:06] man and female
[57:08] he made the Burly Spirit of the man he
[57:11] made the tender little delicate feminist
[57:13] spirit for the woman
[57:15] I want to pause here because this is the
[57:17] pattern that we see repeated at Calvary
[57:20] when Christ was crucified
[57:23] they took a spear they pierced his side
[57:25] that was the bride being taken from the
[57:29] side of Christ and were to be bone of
[57:31] his bone
[57:32] were to be of his spirit and we're to
[57:35] reflect the very nature of Christ
[57:39] that's
[57:41] our image that's where we're from there
[57:44] we don't have a part in this without
[57:46] them
[57:48] if you if you want to know who you are
[57:51] you're hitting Christ your position is
[57:54] in Christ you're seated in Heavenly
[57:56] places in Christ Jesus you don't have a
[57:58] place outside of Christ matter of fact
[58:00] everything that doesn't have an eternal
[58:02] representation anything that wasn't in
[58:05] him in the very beginning it has no it
[58:08] has no Eternal representation How can
[58:11] there be those who are Eternal that they
[58:13] were never part of them
[58:15] so what you want to know is who you are
[58:18] in him you don't want to know who you
[58:21] are in this
[58:22] you're being led by something else
[58:24] anytime you're letting this Define you
[58:26] and you think you're fine in a reality
[58:28] it's blind leading blind
[58:31] you think you're doing something that
[58:34] you be you
[58:37] you be dead
[58:39] you have no Eternal representation you
[58:43] you're you know
[58:46] you're not going to be there that this
[58:49] flesh
[58:50] is a fallen nature
[58:52] if it's not redeemed it perishes
[58:56] with the Earth
[58:58] there's a Redemptive Redemption plan so
[59:01] we've covered where we came from
[59:04] a Heavenly image
[59:06] an image of God and it's beautiful
[59:09] because we see ourselves there
[59:13] I'm going to skip down to 54.
[59:21] he you know when he made a covenant with
[59:23] that Adam with with Abraham
[59:26] he it was a Grace Covenant
[59:29] he it wasn't dependent
[59:32] on anything Abraham would do but he said
[59:35] I've intended this
[59:39] so he knew he was going to have some
[59:42] women so he just made their Spirit right
[59:45] there amen
[59:48] there's your representation
[59:50] right it's the it's talking of the Bride
[59:54] I'm seeing myself
[59:56] I'm a part I couldn't be separate I
[59:58] can't be separated from him I'm a part
[1:00:00] of them
[1:00:01] he can't be complete in the whole
[1:00:03] without me he didn't make Adam
[1:00:07] a man
[1:00:09] he said he made Adam male and female
[1:00:12] created he them
[1:00:14] yeah Adam wouldn't have been complete
[1:00:16] without what the prophet's now saying
[1:00:19] the Bible said he did First Genesis 1 26
[1:00:23] he created him man in the prefigure male
[1:00:27] and female Amen in the pre-figure he
[1:00:30] made the woman and the man before their
[1:00:32] ever formed Out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:39] glorious
[1:00:51] when God made man
[1:00:53] not his own image the body's not the
[1:00:56] image of God this body is the image of
[1:00:59] Beast
[1:01:01] and that you can go and study that out
[1:01:03] he takes Ephesians 1 he says but he he
[1:01:07] talks about now I think it's good for us
[1:01:10] to understand is is sin nature
[1:01:13] and he says a man without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:15] is a beast so you have a flesh that is
[1:01:20] he says in many cases worse than nature
[1:01:24] it could be even worse than nature even
[1:01:27] though nature is already in a fallen
[1:01:28] State the the the the Infidel a man can
[1:01:31] be can be worse than nature itself
[1:01:34] but we've been chosen in Christ
[1:01:37] Ephesians 1. according to death he has
[1:01:40] chosen us before the foundation of the
[1:01:42] world now the first man 61 he made the
[1:01:46] first man in His image and we are
[1:01:48] returning back to that image that's
[1:01:51] right to the first created image
[1:01:53] hallelujah our hope
[1:01:56] is understanding a theophany body and
[1:02:00] and getting a new body it's it's
[1:02:02] something this message tells us about
[1:02:05] we Fellowship around it but it's not
[1:02:08] that we have to abide in this sin nature
[1:02:10] but we've been given the first fruits
[1:02:12] that testified that there's an image
[1:02:14] that God had of us before the foundation
[1:02:16] of the world that was perfect and
[1:02:18] blameless before him in love that we are
[1:02:21] the very image of God so the purpose of
[1:02:25] it the heartbeat of it was Fellowship
[1:02:28] it's the only way he can have communion
[1:02:32] it's you it's a perfect type of man and
[1:02:35] wife in Christ in the church
[1:02:37] it was so he could how think of Adam now
[1:02:42] being able to look upon a very
[1:02:44] expression a part of him and he's not
[1:02:47] looking at someone as if he didn't never
[1:02:49] know him he could actually understand
[1:02:51] Eve
[1:02:54] as
[1:02:56] a part of who he was
[1:02:58] he had a complete understanding
[1:03:01] of who he was now she was made a
[1:03:04] byproduct of a man
[1:03:06] for a purpose
[1:03:08] and
[1:03:10] this teaching as brother Branham would
[1:03:12] go through it he lets us understand now
[1:03:15] that that's where it started now we've
[1:03:18] come it now through the fall we're in in
[1:03:21] sin 72 now hear God just exactly between
[1:03:25] the Oneness the Trinity you've got this
[1:03:27] thing exactly right now between him he
[1:03:29] says it's neither of them when God
[1:03:31] dropped unfolded himself down till he
[1:03:33] come down to this man now man sinned not
[1:03:38] in his spirit
[1:03:39] but in his body
[1:03:42] that we know this I lust passion and
[1:03:46] when he sinned he separated him from
[1:03:48] himself from the maker and then God the
[1:03:50] logos the creator of him came down and
[1:03:53] made the image of the man man was made
[1:03:55] in the image of God and then was made
[1:03:58] the image of the Beast he fell
[1:04:00] Hallelujah God came down in the image of
[1:04:03] man
[1:04:05] in the man Christ Jesus to suffer pain
[1:04:08] God could not suffer pain in the spirit
[1:04:11] how would he suffer physical pain in the
[1:04:14] spirit he couldn't do it so God unfolded
[1:04:17] himself and was made in the image of man
[1:04:19] to redeem man that was lost and then
[1:04:22] God's suffering In the Flesh First
[1:04:25] Timothy 3 16 without controversy that
[1:04:29] argument great is the mystery of
[1:04:31] godliness for God was manifested in the
[1:04:34] flesh scene of angels preached on to the
[1:04:37] Gentiles and believed and received up
[1:04:39] and I
[1:04:41] he didn't say Gentiles he paused it
[1:04:44] the right hand of the Father God himself
[1:04:47] came down and lived in a human body and
[1:04:49] suffered temptation
[1:04:51] God in Christ
[1:04:53] reconciling the world to himself
[1:04:57] now it's important to recognize your
[1:05:01] position in Christ because
[1:05:04] Christ came in the flesh
[1:05:06] and was Victorious
[1:05:08] he conquered it all
[1:05:10] so your Victory is not you're not
[1:05:14] hanging your hat on this
[1:05:17] you're you're you are trusting in the
[1:05:20] righteousness of the Lamb the body that
[1:05:24] would that overcame it for you was
[1:05:25] Christ Jesus who came in the likeness of
[1:05:27] sinful flesh was tempted In the Flesh in
[1:05:30] every manner as we were
[1:05:32] and if you don't see yourself in him if
[1:05:34] you don't reconcile yourself crucified
[1:05:36] with Christ if you don't see your
[1:05:38] position in Christ you have no part of
[1:05:41] them
[1:05:42] the Revelation the the the new birth
[1:05:45] brother Brandon would say is a
[1:05:46] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:05:48] personally as your savior no man can
[1:05:51] confess he is the Christ saved by the
[1:05:52] spirit you can't have a revelation of
[1:05:55] Jesus Christ as your savior but by the
[1:05:57] spirit of God so you have a lot of
[1:05:59] confession
[1:06:01] but they don't even know who he is
[1:06:04] they have no true understanding of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ they don't have an understanding
[1:06:08] of the logos they don't have this
[1:06:10] message because if you were the word
[1:06:13] you you had as a Son of God Son and
[1:06:16] Daughter of God you had representation
[1:06:17] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:19] job where were you when the foundations
[1:06:22] were laid when the Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:24] God shouted for Joy where were you and
[1:06:27] he's now going to counsel job and tell
[1:06:29] him that
[1:06:31] you don't think you got the grasp on
[1:06:32] this that you think you got
[1:06:35] right right because we see from this
[1:06:37] vantage point we have five senses
[1:06:40] has anybody seen their theophany
[1:06:43] God is a spirit you couldn't see it
[1:06:48] when he made the first Adam it was a
[1:06:51] logos word representation was there but
[1:06:54] that's a spiritual still representation
[1:06:58] we weren't even comprehend it with these
[1:07:01] five senses
[1:07:03] so he's he's uh revealing himself
[1:07:07] to a bride
[1:07:09] that's going to be bone of his bone
[1:07:11] flesh of his flesh
[1:07:13] Hallelujah but let me
[1:07:16] yeah I'm gonna just skip through this
[1:07:20] it's Rich amen
[1:07:22] I love this
[1:07:23] view that we have
[1:07:26] into the beginning of the creation of
[1:07:28] God brother Branham would pick this up
[1:07:30] this is early in the ministry if you
[1:07:33] will but I don't see any difference he
[1:07:35] was a prophet then I think the trumpet
[1:07:38] was sounding the word was going forth
[1:07:39] the Mysteries were being revealed
[1:07:42] this is this is prophetic insight
[1:07:46] that is the mind of God being revealed
[1:07:50] to a predestinated people that would
[1:07:53] receive it
[1:07:55] and it recognized their position in
[1:07:57] Christ amen
[1:08:06] Hallelujah
[1:08:12] what I would
[1:08:15] think that we would all be able to do
[1:08:16] and identify with
[1:08:19] night it's because he's made us this way
[1:08:23] is in that type of taking Eve out of
[1:08:25] Adam
[1:08:27] and that is the very
[1:08:30] reflection of calvary
[1:08:32] as we look there
[1:08:36] if you're wondering why you desire on
[1:08:40] the inside and feel there's a call and a
[1:08:43] burn in a drawing it's because
[1:08:46] it's that relationship with Christ
[1:08:50] that has to satisfy that
[1:08:53] we've been given a way to understand and
[1:08:55] comprehend the invisible things of God
[1:08:57] are clearly made manifest in the visible
[1:08:59] things around us he gave us a way to
[1:09:02] comprehend
[1:09:04] his principles and the way he works he
[1:09:07] declares himself in nature and from the
[1:09:09] very beginning the very thing he desired
[1:09:12] most reflect himself in was the type of
[1:09:14] man and wife in Christ in the church he
[1:09:16] did that with Adam and Eve
[1:09:18] so if you don't you don't have to be
[1:09:20] very spiritual I would not think
[1:09:22] to understand that the why is that
[1:09:26] attacked most in this day
[1:09:29] you know love wins and you got these
[1:09:32] this idea of it's a perversion
[1:09:36] what is it attacking it's attacking the
[1:09:39] very heartbeat of God the thing he chose
[1:09:43] to reflect himself in
[1:09:46] and what
[1:09:48] he is love
[1:09:49] right everything else is a perversion
[1:09:52] he's love
[1:09:56] and in that
[1:09:58] we find our position
[1:10:00] because
[1:10:02] it's not a popular gospel but the woman
[1:10:05] is subject to the man
[1:10:08] there has to be a headship
[1:10:11] when we're a part of the body of Christ
[1:10:13] we don't have a nature
[1:10:16] we should not have a nature that is not
[1:10:19] uh a dove and lamb nature
[1:10:24] uh
[1:10:26] we should have the nature of Christ that
[1:10:29] he's pleased to be with and pleased to
[1:10:30] dwell with
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:33] and one of the things that
[1:10:35] we find
[1:10:37] that the image is so tarnished now
[1:10:42] you'd you'd probably brother Branham
[1:10:45] says in one place he says it's hard to
[1:10:46] see a real lady anymore
[1:10:50] it says in back in paragraph 49 he says
[1:10:52] that when you see a woman acting like a
[1:10:54] man
[1:10:55] she's got out of her place you see
[1:10:57] in the beginning all right she's
[1:10:59] supposed to think it's a shame for a
[1:11:01] woman
[1:11:03] has it's a shame that woman has lost her
[1:11:05] dainty feminist place it's a disgrace I
[1:11:08] tell you
[1:11:09] it looks like you know I'm talking about
[1:11:12] you women here but of course it hurts it
[1:11:15] just does but look
[1:11:17] let me ask you something it used to be
[1:11:19] that a woman was so feminist tell a man
[1:11:21] would go
[1:11:24] foreign
[1:11:32] would go talking to them and they would
[1:11:34] blush
[1:11:36] you know I I'm not
[1:11:38] worried about women so much right there
[1:11:41] well one of the ways the Lord first
[1:11:43] showed himself to me was the way he seen
[1:11:45] my life before
[1:11:47] I was so impure
[1:11:50] and I wonder sometimes if we've lost our
[1:11:53] blush when he comes our way
[1:11:55] does his voice still mean everything to
[1:11:58] us
[1:11:59] church he loves us so much I hear the
[1:12:02] word
[1:12:03] come to us and speak and Minister life
[1:12:08] and only the way he can and it's Love
[1:12:11] Letters to us he's telling us constantly
[1:12:14] you're my bride You're My Chosen One
[1:12:16] You're Mine do we get
[1:12:20] desensitized to it does he still mean
[1:12:22] something to us do it oh that's him he's
[1:12:25] speaking to my heart does it cause a
[1:12:28] blush in us anymore
[1:12:31] say Lord I I want to have the right
[1:12:33] nature father
[1:12:35] I still want to be wooed by you father
[1:12:38] if when you I want to be sensitive I I
[1:12:41] want to know your will before you speak
[1:12:43] it I want to be moving I want to do the
[1:12:46] things that you want me to do before you
[1:12:48] even ask I want to do more for you
[1:12:50] father there's got to be a cry in the
[1:12:54] bride of Christ to be pleasing to him
[1:12:56] these things are it's a type it's just
[1:12:59] an unfolding if you can't you know
[1:13:04] I know that seems like sisters get a
[1:13:06] hard time but that's
[1:13:08] the men brother Brandon says that you
[1:13:11] know the the uh the wife's not gonna
[1:13:14] have to answer for her husband
[1:13:18] she's not going to have to you know this
[1:13:21] is the man you gave me but you know it
[1:13:25] and
[1:13:28] but the husband answers for the wife
[1:13:32] he doesn't you know the
[1:13:35] in our high our hiding place our resting
[1:13:38] places in Christ and if you've chosen
[1:13:41] headship outside of him
[1:13:44] if you really think you're your own
[1:13:45] person and you're going to go be your
[1:13:48] own thing
[1:13:52] you're just not going to be there
[1:13:55] and as the bride of Christ there's a
[1:13:58] nature that's supposed to be reflected
[1:14:01] it has to be bone of his bone it has to
[1:14:03] be Spirit of his spirit and you want to
[1:14:05] know who that is when Christ go look at
[1:14:07] who Jesus Christ was it was when the
[1:14:09] prostitute came
[1:14:11] go thy way sin no more thy sins be
[1:14:13] forgiven me
[1:14:15] there's a nature that we have to live
[1:14:17] out and declare as the bride of Christ
[1:14:20] because we're the same we're not
[1:14:21] different
[1:14:23] you're if you're the bride of Christ
[1:14:24] you're you're a part of them
[1:14:27] amen it's not a different uh
[1:14:33] a different
[1:14:34] this is a in the pergamian church age
[1:14:39] he says and when the bride will get back
[1:14:41] to being a word bride she will produce
[1:14:43] the very works that Jesus produced the
[1:14:46] word is God the spirit is God they are
[1:14:50] all one one cannot work apart from the
[1:14:54] other if one truly has the spirit of God
[1:14:57] he will have the word of God that is how
[1:15:00] it was with the prophets you can't
[1:15:04] separate the spirit and the word they
[1:15:06] are one you can't separate Eve from Adam
[1:15:10] when she was in them in the beginning
[1:15:12] it wouldn't have been Adam if Eve wasn't
[1:15:14] there it won't be Christ without the
[1:15:17] bride
[1:15:18] sorry because that's who the church was
[1:15:21] taken from his side we're built into it
[1:15:24] the contract
[1:15:26] we're we're secure in Christ Jesus what
[1:15:29] do I want to know I want to know the
[1:15:31] riches of the glory I have in Christ I
[1:15:34] want to know the fullness of his stature
[1:15:36] why that's who I am
[1:15:39] that's me
[1:15:42] I miss Jesus Christ I miss Grace
[1:15:45] you know the Capstone Grace Grace that's
[1:15:48] me the the love
[1:15:50] representation
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:56] and this is all
[1:15:58] expressing out
[1:16:00] from the very beginning it was an image
[1:16:01] right God became expressing the very
[1:16:04] person of Jesus Christ Jesus was the was
[1:16:06] the expressed image of God again John 1
[1:16:09] 4 and now the word was made flesh and
[1:16:11] dwelt amongst us amen
[1:16:16] Hallelujah I have no idea how long the
[1:16:19] time has been
[1:16:21] but
[1:16:22] we're just gonna hopefully get to a
[1:16:24] stopping place here
[1:16:27] the
[1:16:29] hope that we have
[1:16:31] is not that we're gonna
[1:16:33] uh
[1:16:34] keep this sinful body but that this
[1:16:37] corruptable will put on incorruption
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:41] that we have a tabernacle waiting for us
[1:16:43] that if this Earthly body be dissolved
[1:16:46] we have one waiting for us that's
[1:16:48] Corinthians 5 1. if the body be
[1:16:50] dissolved the Earthly Tabernacle we have
[1:16:52] another one see we have bypass that
[1:16:55] comes straight from God that attribute
[1:16:58] to flesh to be tempted and tested by sin
[1:17:01] now now it's starting to make sense why
[1:17:04] if I had a perfect representation in
[1:17:06] Christ and I was completing him and I'm
[1:17:08] now dancing before the Lord with job I
[1:17:11] mean couldn't I just stay there
[1:17:13] that'd been great
[1:17:15] but there was something to be have
[1:17:17] dominion over what was it he saw the
[1:17:20] land there's no man to till the ground
[1:17:23] here's the Earth beautiful
[1:17:25] I perfect representation like the Earth
[1:17:29] was perfect
[1:17:31] but it was still lacking something it
[1:17:34] didn't have someone to have dominion
[1:17:36] over it
[1:17:38] so now
[1:17:39] you've been given a place to have
[1:17:41] dominion
[1:17:42] you're put back on the same place where
[1:17:45] it's you have dominion over this flesh
[1:17:49] you've been given the spirit and the
[1:17:51] power as a Son of God to have complete
[1:17:53] dominion over this flesh it's your enemy
[1:17:56] it's the Giant in your land
[1:17:59] it doesn't matter how big you want to
[1:18:00] know where it wakes up with you in the
[1:18:02] morning
[1:18:03] the first thing you need to have
[1:18:04] dominion over is this flesh
[1:18:06] it's sin nature we have the a perfect
[1:18:10] understanding that that is not Who We
[1:18:12] Are
[1:18:13] I don't have to accept this flesh and
[1:18:16] the uh
[1:18:18] that I somehow read over it but
[1:18:25] brother Branham talks about how
[1:18:28] the uh
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:33] if I could find it it's just it's a
[1:18:35] beautiful
[1:18:40] yes
[1:18:41] it's in paragraph 92 he says all right
[1:18:45] now that's the connection when God makes
[1:18:47] up his mind to do anything it has to be
[1:18:49] Satan spoiled this picture by sexual
[1:18:53] desire by a woman to bringeth forth
[1:18:54] children he spoiled it so go ahead and
[1:18:57] make it that's right this habitation is
[1:18:59] to pick up these cause the only thing
[1:19:02] that you can do in this life is pick up
[1:19:05] your form and image what you are if
[1:19:08] you're redheaded now you'll be redheaded
[1:19:10] then if you're black-headed now you'll
[1:19:12] be blockheaded then now that catch this
[1:19:15] see what you was at your best and if
[1:19:18] Satan interrupted the picture
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:25] he's interrupted the picture
[1:19:28] there's that you have to understand
[1:19:30] there's things because of sins fall
[1:19:33] that he's interrupted the picture
[1:19:35] you didn't even get and he stops
[1:19:42] what God intended you to be
[1:19:45] you'll be
[1:19:47] amen I'm so thankful for that
[1:19:50] oh glorious there's your man
[1:19:54] Saints it means so much to me
[1:19:57] there's things that you this this life
[1:20:01] I've been things in in Ukraine I've seen
[1:20:05] one of the I think it might be called
[1:20:06] elephantitis or something like that
[1:20:08] you've heard of the Hunchback of Notre
[1:20:10] Dame I've seen somebody was grossly
[1:20:13] disfigured
[1:20:14] you can't tell me that was as Heavenly
[1:20:16] the body his representation what
[1:20:19] happened Satan disrupted the picture
[1:20:21] what have we been given a foretaste of
[1:20:24] you know why there's healing
[1:20:26] you want you want to know why because
[1:20:28] it's testifying
[1:20:30] on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:20:35] Hallelujah and why do we want it to why
[1:20:39] do I want it to be declared why do I
[1:20:42] want to see healing why do I because I
[1:20:44] want the faith
[1:20:45] it's temporal temporal blessing but what
[1:20:48] is it declaring I've got an image I've
[1:20:51] got a body I've got a home what Am I

[1:21:04] so many pictures of it because it's
[1:21:05] perfect you just arrived

[1:21:14] honestly
[1:21:16] I didn't hope that it offend nobody I
[1:21:18] didn't mean that but we don't want to
[1:21:20] glorify this flesh we want to make sure
[1:21:22] that we're pointing to something that's
[1:21:24] Builder and maker is God you know I'm
[1:21:27] I'm discouraged by this thing guys I get

[1:21:55] away in Christ that's not me that's not
[1:21:57] my representation I don't have to bear
[1:21:59] that guilt I don't have to bear that
[1:22:01] shame I don't even have it's sorry
[1:22:06] I don't know who you're talking about
[1:22:09] I mean you haven't you know what they
[1:22:10] say they got these guys they're really
[1:22:12] good at you know that you have the right
[1:22:14] to remain silent
[1:22:16] anything you say can and will be used
[1:22:18] against you in the court of law
[1:22:20] sometimes we should just shut up
[1:22:32] keep your mouth shut
[1:22:34] he'll fight your battle
[1:22:36] just keep your mouth shut I mean the
[1:22:38] devil's got to get scared when you're
[1:22:39] sitting there just going
[1:22:46] yeah just let the joy of the Lord be
[1:22:47] your strength
[1:22:49] the battle's the Lord's
[1:22:52] stand on his word
[1:22:55] you know let's let's face it we got an
[1:22:58] enemy
[1:22:59] he tries to make himself so great
[1:23:03] and he's conquered
[1:23:05] he doesn't even have arrows in his
[1:23:08] quiver
[1:23:09] he's a bluff
[1:23:12] death where's your sting
[1:23:14] you know the the thing that you would
[1:23:16] think it would be the ultimate climatic
[1:23:18] proof
[1:23:19] of your demise death
[1:23:23] I'll show you
[1:23:26] and what happened the Stinger of death's
[1:23:28] been taken out
[1:23:29] the confidence we have and that's what
[1:23:31] I'm trying to Fellowship on is is that
[1:23:33] if this Earthly body be dissolved we
[1:23:36] have a perfect image of us in Christ
[1:23:39] Jesus I'm like Lord dissolve it quickly
[1:23:43] it less of me more of you you know what
[1:23:46] there's more of him to display in this
[1:23:48] hour we will take on a body change
[1:23:52] so that the very likeness that he had of
[1:23:56] us in the very beginning Hallelujah the
[1:23:59] image he predestinated us to truly be in
[1:24:02] not this born in sin
[1:24:04] image
[1:24:06] that you put a name on and that's
[1:24:08] capable of getting sick and going bald
[1:24:15] right
[1:24:17] not I haven't lost the one
[1:24:20] amen
[1:24:23] I think was
[1:24:24] reading somewhere but that that's I love
[1:24:27] that
[1:24:28] all right
[1:24:31] how do we come into that image
[1:24:39] and if this early body Earthly body be
[1:24:41] dissolved this Tabernacle we have
[1:24:42] another one
[1:24:44] so we have bypassed that with straight
[1:24:46] from God that attribute to be fleshed to
[1:24:49] be tempted and tested in sin like Adam
[1:24:50] but when tested of his word
[1:24:55] is over then we are taken up
[1:24:57] this body that was prepared for us
[1:25:00] before the foundation of the world in
[1:25:02] pardon in the world there that we
[1:25:05] skipped to come right around down here
[1:25:08] to be tempted and tested if we'd have
[1:25:10] come through that we would had no
[1:25:14] temptation he's talking about the body
[1:25:16] we're going to have if we would have
[1:25:18] just come into that body there would
[1:25:21] have been no temptation
[1:25:25] we would have node all things
[1:25:27] that's the reason Jesus knowed all
[1:25:30] things because he was word before he was
[1:25:34] flesh
[1:25:36] then we become the word
[1:25:40] flesh
[1:25:42] becoming word
[1:25:44] he was the word
[1:25:46] made flesh and knowed all things how are
[1:25:49] we going to start to know all things you
[1:25:51] know what's given to us amen
[1:25:53] in this day it's given to us
[1:25:57] that's our inheritance that's who we are
[1:26:00] here we are formed the word image to be
[1:26:04] a partaker of the word feed on the word
[1:26:07] b-e-b being predestinated since the
[1:26:10] beginning you see the little spark of
[1:26:13] life that you had in you from the
[1:26:14] beginning then you started your journey
[1:26:17] many of you can remember it you join
[1:26:20] this church and join that church you try
[1:26:22] this and tried that nothing satisfied
[1:26:25] that's right but one day you recognized
[1:26:28] it right and he goes in and it doesn't
[1:26:32] hurt to tell the story but he talks
[1:26:34] about the eagle in the barnyard
[1:26:35] how it was tied down they hear it it had
[1:26:39] a birth you have to recognize in use a
[1:26:42] spiritual nature it's that of an eagle
[1:26:45] it's that of an overcomer it's that of
[1:26:47] the of someone who has dominion over sin
[1:26:50] that is a that's perfect blameless
[1:26:53] before Christ in love and that's in you
[1:26:56] now you have a liar
[1:26:58] and it's mainly you
[1:27:00] it's this flesh
[1:27:02] what's testifying to it otherwise and
[1:27:05] that's that's just because that's sin
[1:27:06] nature but we've been given dominion
[1:27:08] over it
[1:27:10] that's the way it was with the gospel or
[1:27:13] the word or the power of Jesus Christ
[1:27:15] when a man has been predestinated to
[1:27:18] eternal life he hears the true Ring The
[1:27:21] Scream Of God nothing can keep him from
[1:27:24] it amen now what's testifying to it
[1:27:28] there's something else saying the days
[1:27:30] of Miracles has passed you can't be an
[1:27:32] overcomer there's you you know that just
[1:27:36] runs in the family you know you're going
[1:27:38] to have a temper you know uh you're
[1:27:41] you're your great-grandfather was this
[1:27:43] way yeah whatever it is no I have an
[1:27:47] image
[1:27:48] a man was made in the image of God
[1:27:51] the the the things that man can do is
[1:27:53] amazing
[1:27:55] that you'll you'll see people are
[1:27:57] talented gifted artists and and they can
[1:28:00] just do something that there's an
[1:28:02] attribute in them to do it you know
[1:28:04] brother Brown talked about if I was
[1:28:05] D'Angelo I guess I'd be a D'Angelo I
[1:28:09] there's a guy some of you may know him
[1:28:11] in your time is J Earl Tolkien
[1:28:14] I read his books
[1:28:16] all right this guy wrote Middle Earth
[1:28:19] uh Wired Magazine did an article they
[1:28:21] said he was the first creator of of
[1:28:25] Middle Earth or or virtual reality
[1:28:28] that's what they said so this is before
[1:28:30] computers by the way they said this guy
[1:28:33] created virtual reality reality and it's
[1:28:37] pretty astounding here's this man he
[1:28:40] would sit down and he would write out
[1:28:41] complete lunar calendars he would create
[1:28:44] a solar system
[1:28:45] and then so he can construct time
[1:28:48] he sat down he wrote out plant species
[1:28:51] and gave him scientific names he would
[1:28:53] sit and he would give he would write out
[1:28:55] family trees and genealogies he would uh
[1:28:58] he created elves and dwarves
[1:29:02] trolls and he was a linguist he gave him
[1:29:05] languages that were truly constructed
[1:29:10] incredible
[1:29:12] you know why he could even have the
[1:29:14] capacity to do that
[1:29:17] because we know someone who did
[1:29:21] it was all in God's thinking before he
[1:29:24] ever started to create and what general
[1:29:25] Tolkien said he said he would step into
[1:29:27] the reality and right from there
[1:29:30] that's why he created it but God in his
[1:29:33] thinking he knew exactly the time that
[1:29:36] he would send Jesus Christ he created
[1:29:39] the the time and the season for it and
[1:29:43] he came in that
[1:29:45] in the and there's a fullness of time
[1:29:48] the uh
[1:29:52] No One's Gonna have to tell me the time
[1:29:53] all right
[1:29:56] but the
[1:29:59] thought that I maybe could finish on
[1:30:01] just looking for a place to stop
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:22] this is maybe an encouragement to you
[1:30:26] because uh
[1:30:28] we have to have a faith in our calling
[1:30:30] and in our election
[1:30:35] and he says this
[1:30:45] is trying to find a place to start
[1:30:50] not every man that saith unto the Lord
[1:30:53] that say unto me Lord Lord shall enter
[1:30:55] into the kingdom of heaven but he that
[1:30:57] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[1:31:00] heaven many will say unto me in that day
[1:31:03] Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:31:06] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:31:09] devils and in thy name done many
[1:31:11] wonderful works
[1:31:13] and then I will profess unto them I
[1:31:16] never knew you
[1:31:18] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:31:21] Jesus does not deny that they did Mighty
[1:31:24] works that only the Holy Ghost can
[1:31:27] accomplish by the way of men but he did
[1:31:31] deny ever knowing them
[1:31:34] these weren't backsliders these weren't
[1:31:36] Wicked ungenerate reprobates
[1:31:40] these were the seed of Satan
[1:31:47] our resting place is the seed
[1:31:55] it's a it's the only this the only
[1:31:57] difference that's the only hope we've
[1:31:59] got
[1:32:00] is that the work he started in US he'll
[1:32:03] finish
[1:32:03] it's the seed he put in US
[1:32:07] and there it is you can't claim that
[1:32:09] manifestation of the evidence of being
[1:32:11] Spirit born Spirit-filled no sir I will
[1:32:13] admit the true manifestation is the
[1:32:16] evidence of the holy spirit is doing the
[1:32:17] mighty acts but it's not the evidence of
[1:32:21] the individual being Spirit-filled
[1:32:24] so yes
[1:32:25] the Lord moves he moves sovereignly and
[1:32:29] he does mighty Miracles dead or raised
[1:32:32] blinded eyes are open that is a general
[1:32:34] outpouring of the rain
[1:32:37] it's not the sign of Salvation to the
[1:32:40] individual
[1:32:42] being Spirit-filled even though the
[1:32:43] individual has the abundance of those
[1:32:45] manifestations the evidence of receiving
[1:32:47] the Holy Ghost today is just the same as
[1:32:50] it was back in the day of Our Lord It's
[1:32:52] to receive the word of Truth for the day
[1:32:55] in which you live Jesus never did stress
[1:32:58] the importance of works
[1:33:00] he did the word
[1:33:03] amen
[1:33:06] he knew that if the people got the word
[1:33:08] The Works would follow amen
[1:33:13] Hallelujah
[1:33:15] praise the Lord
[1:33:17] that's our inheritance The Works is ours
[1:33:20] there they're ours to perform why are we
[1:33:24] not confused why is it important because
[1:33:26] when we see someone squatting on our
[1:33:29] land
[1:33:31] saying their seed
[1:33:34] and not producing the fruits that in the
[1:33:37] love affair we have with Christ we're
[1:33:39] like but that ain't pleasing to him
[1:33:42] how come they how can they get to call
[1:33:45] themselves by his name and get to live
[1:33:49] in the blessings
[1:33:50] are they really
[1:33:53] his bride
[1:33:55] they seem to call themselves Christians
[1:33:58] and they they get the results don't they
[1:34:01] are I mean they listen to that music and
[1:34:04] I
[1:34:05] I can't do that I can't live the way
[1:34:09] because you're he doesn't know them
[1:34:13] you're a part of them walk pleasing to
[1:34:16] them
[1:34:17] have the nature that you're supposed to
[1:34:20] have as the nature of the bride of
[1:34:22] Christ
[1:34:23] don't model yourself after the world
[1:34:27] it's not pleasing to them
[1:34:29] like our eyesight our spiritual
[1:34:31] understanding and our eyesight of what's
[1:34:33] pleasing to God
[1:34:35] is one that is known in
[1:34:37] in the intimacy
[1:34:40] and that should be personal
[1:34:43] and if it's not a liberty for you to do
[1:34:45] don't do it
[1:34:47] if you know it's not pleasing for the
[1:34:48] Lord in your walk don't do it
[1:34:52] it may not be the same for me I know
[1:34:54] some people who don't drink coffee
[1:34:57] I probably could do with less coffee
[1:35:01] but you know what I'm not going to tear
[1:35:04] down their standard and like come up
[1:35:05] with the doctoral
[1:35:07] every seed bearing plant you know I'm
[1:35:09] going to tear down their standard
[1:35:12] the Lord knows maybe there's a reason
[1:35:15] you know he they actually could be
[1:35:17] protecting them from something
[1:35:20] you know you the last thing you want to
[1:35:22] do
[1:35:24] is compare yourselves one to another
[1:35:28] walk with the the love of Christ shed
[1:35:30] abroad in your lives with the nature and
[1:35:33] the spirit of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:34] in a way that's pleasing to him that
[1:35:37] glorifies your heavenly father
[1:35:39] and let's not lose our blush when he
[1:35:42] comes
[1:35:44] it should mean everything to us
[1:35:49] when he the preeminence he should have
[1:35:52] you know that which we set aside the
[1:35:54] church building we it's you know it's a
[1:35:57] place where the unbelievers should be
[1:35:58] able to come into our midst right
[1:36:02] and recognize
[1:36:05] there's something different you know
[1:36:08] that one sign for an unbelievers it's
[1:36:10] it's reverence
[1:36:13] you know that's we we reverence this as
[1:36:15] a place that people meet God
[1:36:18] that's why we the message is different
[1:36:20] have you ever been to a Baptist Church
[1:36:23] hi Johnny good to see you
[1:36:27] that in the sanctuary
[1:36:30] there's just a different mode what are
[1:36:32] we trying to give the preeminence to
[1:36:33] Christ what are we saying if he comes
[1:36:36] that'll be the difference
[1:36:39] Lord just one touch from you if one word
[1:36:42] could be said if your spirit could come
[1:36:45] then all's well
[1:36:48] when Jesus comes
[1:36:53] and he he can pass by your way at any
[1:36:56] time
[1:36:57] amen
[1:36:59] we'd invite the musicians to come
[1:37:08] it's the Difference Maker
[1:37:10] Adam would have sat there just a dead
[1:37:12] body
[1:37:15] if it life wasn't breathed into his
[1:37:17] nostrils
[1:37:20] it's really amazing that's the same
[1:37:23] thing today
[1:37:26] you could be there living a life
[1:37:28] you think you're alive but you're really
[1:37:30] dead
[1:37:31] scripture you even would say a woman
[1:37:33] that lives in sin is dead while she
[1:37:35] liveth
[1:37:36] you could go through the scripture you
[1:37:38] could see it's a principle
[1:37:40] if you are not born again
[1:37:42] if you don't have eternal life if the
[1:37:44] Life of Christ is not in you
[1:37:47] you have no
[1:37:49] reality you you're you don't have true
[1:37:52] life
[1:37:53] but when he comes he could Quicken that
[1:37:56] seed that's in you
[1:37:57] and make all things new
[1:38:03] try to sing that song
[1:38:06] I said speak to the
[1:38:08] speak to the mountain I'm going to need
[1:38:10] the words to that

[1:38:44] behind the piano and sing it that's my
[1:38:46] wife I could stand by her
[1:38:48] I've got a portable microphone too
[1:38:53] I've never sung this before but this
[1:38:56] song's just been on my heart it's been a
[1:38:57] blessing I think it has been sung but we
[1:39:00] don't believe that songs belong to
[1:39:01] individuals starting to still this
[1:39:05] why would I worry when Giants come
[1:39:10] calling my name
[1:39:15] foreign
[1:39:21] [Music]

[1:42:24] Saints
[1:42:27] Giant in our land is really just this
[1:42:29] False Image
[1:42:31] it's this thing that tells us every day
[1:42:33] that we can't attain a full inheritance
[1:42:35] in Christ and we could speak to that and
[1:42:39] say no
[1:42:41] I'm going to declare Christ in his
[1:42:43] righteousness I'm going to shine forth
[1:42:45] the glory of my Lord in this day it's
[1:42:48] been given to me to be an overcomer I'm

[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:55] Lord please
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:09] everything
[1:46:12] that I knew
[1:46:16] me please
[1:46:20] [Music]
[1:46:43] let's sing that one more time tonight
[1:46:50] amen
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:47:05] friends
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:21] foreign
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:47] cannot comprehend how beautiful the body
[1:47:50] of Jesus Christ is
[1:47:53] she's Eternal because she's part of him
[1:47:58] how those quotes and all those things
[1:48:00] that were right it just really blessed
[1:48:02] me because it shows how important she is
[1:48:04] to him
[1:48:05] it's a marriage
[1:48:07] it's a love relationship that you can
[1:48:10] have with him every day
[1:48:12] every day there's new food every day
[1:48:15] there's new life
[1:48:17] and the more you're in that life the
[1:48:19] more you're in that presence the more
[1:48:21] you become that presence
[1:48:23] and then our very word now becomes the
[1:48:26] word of God
[1:48:28] because I don't want this man to speak
[1:48:31] when this man speaks and makes up stuff
[1:48:33] and all of a sudden comes to this
[1:48:35] imaginary way of describing things and
[1:48:38] you're out there talking about stuff
[1:48:39] that don't even matter
[1:48:41] but the word of God should be on our
[1:48:43] lips at all the time because it's a
[1:48:46] spirit of Prophecy
[1:48:48] so the more I speak this word
[1:48:51] the more I become this word because now
[1:48:54] it's a revelation inside of me and you
[1:48:56] professing the very thing we believe
[1:49:00] but it's got to be spoken because it
[1:49:03] needs to be overcome
[1:49:04] you have to see the fruits of the very
[1:49:07] word you're speaking
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:11] because he wants to be revealed inside
[1:49:12] of you it wants to show you that has an
[1:49:15] effect
[1:49:17] it could cast out fear
[1:49:19] okay cast out depression
[1:49:22] it could cast out outward thinking the
[1:49:25] lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh
[1:49:27] the pride of life
[1:49:28] all those things
[1:49:30] because nothing matters
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:34] other than his life
[1:49:37] that's who we are
[1:49:39] we're bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:49:41] flesh Spirit of a spirit that means we
[1:49:44] have to live the very thing we profess
[1:49:46] we are
[1:49:48] Oh What a Beautiful gospel
[1:49:51] I don't know any other gospel that makes
[1:49:53] this bride look this beautiful as this
[1:49:55] message
[1:49:57] and that's because the the Bride of
[1:49:59] Jesus Christ came through that word that
[1:50:01] that spoken word that she's becoming now
[1:50:05] and she's an expression of it amen
[1:50:08] amen let's just sing this song
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] you unravel me
[1:50:16] with a melody
[1:50:20] years around me with a song

[1:54:29] lord it's not because of you Lord that
[1:54:32] we are that way Lord It's because we get

[1:54:41] business
