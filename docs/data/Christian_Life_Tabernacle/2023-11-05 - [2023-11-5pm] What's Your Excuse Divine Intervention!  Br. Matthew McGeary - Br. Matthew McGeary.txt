you hear me okay I was saying isn't that your prayer that you'd just be drawn closer to him amen I believe that's all of our heart's desires that we'd be close to him and I really think what's lacking in that equation is is he's always near we just fail to recognize him you know we we we say draw me near to him and he's doing everything on his part I want to do my part and I pray it's in a a service like like this we we don't plan to be lengthy try to be very quick and turn it over to uh brother Billy for the the uh communion service but we just maybe want to say something by way of testimony that might encourage you why don't we just go before him Lord we we love you and we're thankful that we have a heart that wants to be close to you there's many that say they want to be close to you but but they just don't want the reproach of sin as we read in Isaiah 4 that they just want to be called by your name but they want to do the things that they want to do and believe what they want to believe but Lord I believe I'm gathered together with the people tonight Lord that we don't want our own thoughts or ideas we don't want our own Ambitions Lord we we want to lay it all down at your feet that you could just draw us closer to you Lord we know that you're willing may we be be more willing Lord to love you and to surrender everything that we would put in front of you Lord we know that you're a perfect gentleman and you always wait for your turn so many times we leave you in the corner with dirty feet and we we ask you forgive us for that Lord that so many times we're selfish and we fail to give you the glory and the honor and the place that you deserve Lord and as we're in your presence tonight may we may we give you that place that rightful place the the first place upon our heart and so we just ask that you'd come Lord Maybe by away a testimony or a few scripture readings or quotes May the people be blessed to be in thy presence we love you pray your blessings upon the communion service Lord we just remember our pastor as you continue to strengthen them we ask these blessings in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have your bibles if you can turn with me to Psalms chapter 23 I had a little conversation with myself in the back I wasn't really feeling up to being here and wasn't really feeling up to saying anything and I saw myself in the mirror and then I got a little inspired I said you're the Rascal so I started to rebuke myself a little bit and I looked at myself in the mirror and you know this just happened about 120 seconds ago I said get behind me Satan so you know we all go through that you know you it's it's easy to to feel a certain way but I'm I'm so thankful that this gospel isn't based on feelings if you reading your Bibles in Psalms chapter 23 very uh special portion of scripture that's become very dear to me in my heart it reads the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you may be seated just want to read a quote brother Brandon would say this in who do you say this this is he says and look at the world today what a tension the whole world lives in you go down the street it's not even safe to drive it's not safe to be on a four-lane highway and we got like a 10 Lane Highway everybody's at attention snapping what's the matter quietening down where are you going that's what's making the insane institutions fill up that's what's got the church in such a turmoil they're so headbound on a certain thing they won't stop and consider God's word in the hour that we're living all under a strain and attention and now we know we are aware the Earth has just went through some great birth pains and the church is going through through some birth pains had to go through birth pains before it could give each one of the prophets when they come into the world it was a birth pain to the church the world has went through a first world war a second world war and now it's ready for a third world war and it's in birth pains again but there's only one thing that can bring peace and that's Christ we certainly know that brother brandham is is speaking of the condition of the age in the church this is the same formula for the individual there's only one thing that can bring peace in your life and that would be Christ all of our schemes and our ideas and our ecclesiastical buildups and all of our politics and all of our science and everything it's been proved that it's nonsense and then we pray that God to help us to intervene come in and do something for us and then when he does I just wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even even would we consider it I just had a little thought on my heart and was thinking upon that word intervene you know intervention is the act of interfering with the outcome or course especially of a condition or process as to prevent harm or improving function intervene and you know just in thinking about this service this morning as we would read there in Luke 14 verse 18 you know the great invitation was given and many of them started to making excuses of of why they couldn't be there you know I've boughten some oxen I'm going to get married some had had pledged and given um their word that they would they had to be somewhere and you know I I was just thinking about that you know I remember one time I heard a brother one time he he was going to do something um that was contrary to the word he I think he was maybe moving somewhere or going somewhere and and it just didn't seem like it was quite fitting in with the program of God and and I I remember the rebuttal was was well I gave them my word that I would go well I thought in my heart well why don't you just tell them you lied I mean because God's not a man that he should lie but we make mistakes and and if you have made an oath or vowed something that's contrary to the word of God you can repent for that and ask somebody to forgive you you don't don't feel like you're Duty Bound by Your Word well I I I made a promise that I would break the word of God I I got to keep it you know I thought well I I was kind of baffled by the excuse because when they were confronted with the word like well you know that was their their their their reasoning for us was that but I gave him my word that I would do it and I thought well God said I'd never see the righteous forsaken or begging bread and and God's not a man that he should lie I would just rather say Lord forgive me tell the individual look I I'm sorry you know I I I I told you that I would go there or I would do that but I realize it's contrary to the word of God and I'm I'm going to ask that you forgive me for that I I would rather air on that side than somebody calling me a liar because if somebody calls me a liar I can say you're right I am a liar I'm a no good down dirty rotten Sinner and I just need the blood of Jesus Christ to wash me and cleanse me forgive me for the mistakes and the errors that I've made I don't want to continue down a path and somehow think that my justification is because I gave my word but you know just thinking about all these people they they made excuses about why they would not uh uh go to the great invitation and and just thinking about the long uh a the lines of of excuses I thought you know I don't have a thought coming I only got one excuse that's valid and that's the word of God the word of God is my excuse I have no other hope I have no other plea i h you know how do I know God loves me he loves me because he said he loves me you know it's it's I couldn't even we could maybe come up with an a million excuses of of of why uh we should we shouldn't be here why we shouldn't be the you know the bride and why we're not quite fit for this but you know uh the reason I'm standing here is because God intervened in my life and and I'm going to try to move towards a a thought here just maybe to give to you before we go into the communion of what is your excuse divine intervention we want to maybe try to come from the other side on something brother brandom says that speaking about brother Brandon about brother uh about Moses when he called him he said and God called him to be his prophet and sent him down there nothing in his hand but a Crooked Stick To Face an army mechanized units that conquered the whole world but with that stick in his hand as God told him to hold that stick in his hand that he would Israel and he went down and did it because God promised it how is he going to do it I will be with you he said show me your glory Lord I'm slow of speech I can't talk right and I he had a million excuses but he said I'll be with you and that's all it took amen that's all it took well you know just take the word to the present hour that we we live in you know the promise that God has given you is no more crazy than what he told Moses to do I mean God told an old man to take a stick and walk down before the most Mighty Army the world had on the face of the planet to deliver his children out of that was Insanity there was no ability that Moses had to produce it he had actually already tried it when he would have been at the height of his ability to do if there was ever a time that Moses would have been able to deliver the children of Israel it was when he was in the palace it was when he had his strength it was when maybe he had he had the proper relationships and and he had maybe some of the guards and the army that were at his command and maybe he could have deceived and he could have manipulated and he could have worked his way in and he could have knocked off pharaoh and he could have gathered the Army and he could have rode in there but all of that would have done is give the glory to a man but when he tried on his own he failed and found himself out there in the wilderness and when he finally came to the place of of of of grasping of what his call really was and to accept the challenge that God had placed before me he had all of his excuses that I I have no ability to bring this to pass I can't even talk right well you know you we can't even talk right but yet the problem have said that that the that you have the mind of Christ that the word is in the bride and you have thus sayith the Lord you know you know what he wants done with the word well we immediately want to start making excuses well but I but I but I we all have a million excuses but I'll be with you just as Mary when she was given that great promise she said how how can this be once again The Impossible right the the no ability what do you mean I'm going to bring forth the Christ I'm going to bring forth the Messiah even seing that I've known no man how could this ever come to pass well the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that is how you are bringing forth every promise of God that has been made to you in this hour because the Holy Ghost has been overshadowing your life to bring forth every single promise that God has made to you he said I will be with you he said show me your glory Lord I'm slow of speech I can't talk right had a million excuses but he said I'll be with you and that's all it took he went taking God's word no matter how dangerous the task seemed Moses continued to believe God and God proved his word through Moses to be the truth because regardless of what took place Moses stayed right with the word so what is your excuse we many times look at that on the negative but I want to kind of look at it from the positive for a little bit what is your excuse divine intervention as we were just reflecting back on the morning service how there were many that made excuses not to go uh maybe they had made a purchase or they had a wedding or something but I I I I thought what about the other side because there are people that went there are other people who had similar obligations and no doubt all of these people who you said you would be there you said you would do this they had to give an account or give an answer also of why they were accepting this invitation it goes both ways if you think about it like that you were GNA be in one place or the other here you you had a Divine in invitation the to a wedding supper and you had to decline the invitation and accept to go on with the natural course that was set before you or there were some people that had the natural course set before them and they realize you know what I'm going to esteem this invitation more valuable I I'm going to realize that regardless of what was set before me it might be your college career it might be somebody that you're interested in there might be these obligations and things that set before you but all of a sudden something's calling from Another Side and you realize you know what I want to I want to esteem that greater than everything else that's been laid out before me and when people would ask you and say why did you give up your college career why did you give up your scholarship to play basketball why why did you uh not follow through with the these things and and your what would your excuse be I want to say your excuse would be divine intervention Hallelujah something got a hold of your life and changed the course you were going One Direction your life was heading One Direction you were going One Direction but all of a sudden Hallelujah divine intervention got a hold of your life and it changed the outcome you know excuse is something offered as justification so once again we're trying to swing this around on the on the positive it's the reason why you can or can't do something you know and as I reflected on that I I just that's what I about brother Adrian's testimony how the the odds were stacked against him you know he had he he he works for a corporation and and and they they' made a a position for him out there in Chicago and a and they asked him you know we'd like to have you there will you go and you know he felt with things that were happening in circumstances he thought maybe this was the opportunity that God was opening up that would be maybe an answer to the season of life he was in and he he told him yes I'll go I I'll go to that job and and there that the the company spent money and then they they had uh spent the resources and allocated funds and they had made a position for him and they had got all things ready and it was getting down to the very uh uh week I I believe uh once some brothers we went away and had some fellowship on a weekend though that next week he was getting back I believe he was supposed to supposed to move and if you if you I love his testimony because he he was what what what he was about to do he was thinking you know Lord I you gave me this job and if this is if this is the way I'm I'm I'm supposed to go and but he but deep in his heart he still had a question that there was something in his heart that he he just wasn't quite settled and and and and I love it because his testimony is is that you know you know God came to him and asked him what is your heart's desire and he answered that uh that the my heart's desires to be in Fellowship here with my brothers and sisters and the Lord spoke to him said thus sayith the Lord according to the desire of your heart that's according to the word you shall have what you've asked for and it was divine intervention because if it wasn't for God intervening our brother would be would have moved but but I I'm I'm trying to move a little further than that because because now he was in a place he had to give an answer if I could say it like this he he had now accepted the invitation the invitation was as you can have the desire of your heart if you want the desire of your heart that's according to the word you can have it and the brother stood there said that's what I want and the Lord said you can have it now he had to give an answer and if I could say it like this now he has to answer back to the corporation and they're going to ask him what is your excuse and if I could put it in these words his answer would be divine intervention what is your excuse divine intervention I realize that I I I will be happy over there it's not it's not according to God's desire and the things for my life what changed all because God intervened on my behalf what is your excuse divine intervention an excuse is an offering or something that you would offer for justification I want to say his excuse was the word come on his excuse was I've received an invitation that I can have the desire of my heart to be in fellowship with my brothers and sisters to continue in the work that God called me to I believe that should be all of our excuses maybe your family wants to ask you why you don't do something or why you don't live away certain way what's your excuse the word of God why can't you go to the company function why can't you go to the company party how many times have you work for a corporation you work for a company they want you to come to the Christmas party well it might be all it'd be all right to go probably for 15 minutes and then it's time to go come on there's reasons you don't go to you know uh I I have a a good friend I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm believing for him that that he would that he'll be born again and come into the fold but just to show the respect he he had for me he he he told me later he goes Matthew I wanted to ask you to be my best man but I I just I didn't I did didn't want to force you with having to make that decision and I told him I appreciate you because I know you would have tried to compromise for me I mean they're going to be worldly and he knows that if I come he has at least the the common decent respect for me to to not curse around me or not to smoke around me and if if I whenever may we we see each other or talk to each other if he ever makes a slip he apologizes that's a good friend you know what I'm saying I I apologize and and they're and they're recognizing but look if if if I go onto their turf or I go onto their grounds you know you ought to offer the same respect to them you know don't don't don't go over onto their grounds and be like man why why you know it goes both ways but I respected that but I I realiz I could I can't go to that event I can't go do those things people people know that and and for you you ought to have an excuse that says you know what I I appreciate you invite me to your wedding I appreciate that you invited me to to be the best man or be this but look if if if it's not going to bring God Glory then what are we doing you have an excuse what is an excuse it's what you offer for justification and I want to say your only justification is the word of God your only justification is the blood of Jesus Christ that he shed for you you have no other justification outside of the Lamb of God that is your excuse is divine intervention that's what I love about testify or testimonies is because it's the recognition that God intervened on somebody's behalf that's what you like to hear about somebody giving their testimony and if you maybe you're a young person and you you don't feel like you have a testimony why don't you get a get get in the presence of God and ask God to clarify that for you or or or to help you to understand what your testimony really is maybe maybe your testimony is the very fact that you're still sitting here you your your testimony doesn't have to have the contrast of going out in the world and living in sin that that's no Vindication of a testimony your testimony could be that I grew up on a message Pew and I want to say what a greater testimony that you never had to go out into the world but yet you experienced the grace and love of Jesus Christ and know him in the power of his resurrection I say what a testimony now you didn't have to go out there and have scars and have the contrast so you could be able to say what I was once out there but now I'm this you don't have to have that that's that that doesn't bring uh what brings God glory is when you recognize him and his person and that you're in an individual Union with Jesus Christ and you've recognized that you're a sinner and all have sinned and come short of his glory and that you've become born a new and filled with the Holy Ghost that's a testimony I'm not so much interested in how you get there as long as you get there there ain't no big eyes and little 's there ain't no big sins and little sin we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God intervention just trying to maybe summize this quickly but just thinking of divine intervention I I thought of brother brandom how he was out there on Hurricane Mountain that time and he was confident in his abilities as a hunter as a trap Trapper or as a guide and he got on what they called the Death March he got to walking around in circles and then he come back to the same place he tried to muster up the you know I I I got this I'm you know come on you're not lost I'm a Hunter I'm a guide you're not lost and sure enough he came right back to that same place and then he KN then he knew he was in trouble because he said well I normally would have just you know being being an Outdoorsman of that that caliber he could have crawled under anything and and let it pass over but but he had a wife and a baby down in a cabin in freezing temperatures and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if he left them there in that condition they would die so he didn't have that choice to weather out the storm he had to make it back down that mountain to that cabin and he when he realized all of a sudden he was lost it wasn't so much being lost that he would lose his own life life but he was responsible for his wife and his baby and that was the reality that was setting into to him because now uh he had that responsibility and he he got to that place to where he started to get desperate and started to get urgent and he started to hear that that voice say I I am the Lord and ever presentes help in the time of trouble and to think here the prophet who must have heard his voice a thousand of times would have the Mind battle like I'm just that's just I'm just hearing something and it kept coming a little louder I am the Lord thy God and everpresent help in the time of trouble and once again he's like am I am I losing I'm losing my mind I I need to get this right okay I need to figure this out and it came again I am the Lord and ever presentent help in the time of trouble and then it struck him he fell on his KN oh God forgive your stupid servant I I thought I was something I thought I was a Trapper I thought I could make my way out of this trial I thought I could do it but Lord I'm lost because on his own ability his wife and baby girl baby boy were going going to die and I tell you that he would have died also trying to get there but he gathered himself together and he thought okay Lord just I'm just going to walk by faith and he thought you know I'm just going to perceive it's this way and he started to walk and as he is walking all of a sudden something a hand come on his shoulder and turned them around and all a sudden all the clouds and everything parted because there was a blizzard set and you couldn't see but maybe 3 feet in front of your face the clouds parted and all a sudden he saw a clear bath and you can see that tower that he hung that wire on that ran down in the cabin and he said I was walking Plum out into Canada I was walking a certain death but something grabbed my arm and turned me around and showed me the way to go what was it it was divine intervention did that the prophet was surely going to die his wife and his baby was surely going to die but something intervened oh can't you test the of the same thing in your life that you were going a certain direction you were doomed to die in sins and trespasses but God intervened on your behalf divine intervention changed the outcome oh thank God for his grace thank God for his mercy and then when he does I just wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even would we consider it I try to skip some things here but just starting in the beginning thinking of Adam and Eve and there that decision had been made that they must go out of the Garden of Eden you could see Eve just weeping there and Adam starting to walk out with Eve and her saying how sorry she was and Adam just loving her and put his arms around her saying it's going to be okay it's going to be okay I'm with you and the prophet of God would pick that up and he would say now I can see them standing there and Adam those great manly shoulders the blood of them sheep skins running down his legs I can see Eve standing there in her beautiful form and all this Blood running over now Adam crying and Eve crying mixing with tears as it run down their bosom like that Eve leaning over on his shoulder and God depart out of my presence oh he couldn't stand it he went but when his children went to walk away let's take a little drama here for a minute I can hear something going like this clap clap clap what is it it's the old bloody sheepskins beating against Adam's big manly legs as he went walking out of the presence of God God couldn't stand it all that great eternity there come down to four letters l o v e God so loved he couldn't see his children go out in that kind of condition separating from him he stopped and said wait a minute I'll put enity between your seed and the serpent seed promising a savior I want to say what did that divine intervention did that the love of God intervened on behalf of his children and said wait a second I'm not willing to send you out in that condition I'm not willing to see you depart out of my my presence like that but I will promise you a savior I'm going to intervene I'm going to change the outcome I'm going to change the direction that you're going I'm going to intervene on your half I say how many times Through the Ages has God intervened how many times through the churches and in your life what did it take for you to be here tonight would you be here if God didn't intervene no but the Divine architect the one who has it all in his hands the one that knows the end from the beginning the one that knows his thoughts that he's had for you thoughts of peace to bring you to an expected end he holds it all I was just thinking along the lines of Abraham and how here Abraham is is going to sacrifice his son now what a what a picture this is is that Abraham's taking his his very promised son his only son and he he's going now to sacrifice could you imagine maybe on this journey he's going into the land of Mariah uh you know I believe uh Mariah means God's choosing and and here he God told him look go into the land of Mariah to a place to a mountain that I've that I'll show you and here he goes could you imagine somebody asking him Abraham where are you going well I'm going to sacrifice my only son I'm going to offer him up as a burnt offering you're going to do what why would you do that Abraham because God told me to do it now we know in Hebrews 11 it would it would speak of him by faith knowing that the same God that gave him could raise him up again but don't act like that belittle the trial I can't imagine I can't imag this isn't just some fancy story to your thoughts thinking there was a man that was called and by faith Abraham in obedience to God's word was going to offer his only son the promised son upon upon the mountain on on an altar and he was going to take a sharp Rock and and no doubt he was going to he was going to cut his throat and and he was going to burn his only son there on Mount Mariah But Here Comes Abraham he's coming back maybe passing through the same way and here's that individual saying oh come on now you told me that you're going to sacrifice that young lad and Abraham in the Integrity of his heart can say yes I was going to what do you mean you were going to yes I I I I I got Isaac we took all the wood up there and I prepared The Altar and no doubt if you could understand I was trying to hold back my emotions as I was weeping there and my son was asking me dad I don't understand we're we're going to offer a sacrifice but where's the lamb and I told my son God is able to provide himself a lamb and he bounded his son together uh he laid his son there on the altar in obedience to God's word you can imagine such a trembling heart such a broken heart in that moment and something in there maybe you're saying God but you said the same God that gave him he'll raise him up again Lord you told me you would number my seed and this is the promise that you gave me and and as he was going to come down with that sharp Rock he was sure to have done it but what happened God intervened God came on the scene and said Abraham stay your hand and what did he call that Place Jehovah Gyra oh he's your provider he's able to intervene on your behalf no matter what you're going through no matter how hard the trial seems God is there to intervene oh how we could go through the room right now I thought i' to call it on names after names after names to think of your condition and where you were and what that outcome was I thought of brother Dari and I sister Alana would be back there a widow with her children but no God rich and mercy God intervened on the scene how many of us could testify tonight of how God intervened oh I wanted to run down through the Through the Ages and Through the Bible characters I wanted to come up to Mount Calvary for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son God intervened this world was was doomed this world was Shipwrecked this world had rejected Malachi 4:5 utter Darkness gross Darkness had had come in upon the world the only light the world had the churches had kicked him out but there was a sunset Mountain God had a chosen Place God intervened on your behalf he wasn't willing that you would live in that gross Darkness but he gave a a promise he said arise and shine thy light has come that's all God intervening on your behalf Prophet would say in a paradox how could Abraham take his son way back three days journey probably uh n 90 miles from any civilization up on top of a mountain where the Lord had showed him go offer his own son Isaac Isaac packing the wood as we know which is a type of Christ and up on the mountain he was to offer Isaac a sacrifice and when he fulfilled everything that God told him but stabbing his own son to death through his throat when he pulled the knife out of that sheath and raised his hand to obey God to the word for the Bible said that he knew that God could not make a promise L he kept it and he received him as one from the dead that he was able ble to raise him up from the dead and give him to him again when he was ready to obey God to its fullness I like that he caught his hand and said stay your hand Abraham and there was a ram hooked in the wilderness around the vines with his thorns on top of that mountain where there was lions and wolves and hyenas and Jackal and great ferocious beasts that eat sheep and then he was way up on top of the mountain where there is no water how did that Ram get there Abraham had picked up Stones all around to build an altar but there was a ram anyhow it was a paradox and any man that believes God and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another Paradox to keep his word for Abraham called the place Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for himself a sacrifice he still can cause a paradox to happen he can do it this afternoon if you'll just take him at his word I wonder if there's somebody here that needs a paradox is there somebody here that needs a paradox to happen in your family to happen in your life to happen in your health to happen in your situation he still Jehovah Gyra as we heard this morning what's seven what Redemptive name do you have need of tonight why don't you start Believing on that Redemptive name call upon the name of the Lord you shall receive what you have need of and I hope I can do this in a a short amount of time of what maybe some of the inspiration for this was but I was having a little fellowship with uh brother Andrew and we were just talking about some of my recovery I've I've had to have a few surgeries um uh since uh the the bladder cancer was removed and just I was fellowshipping with him and and it struck me as I was talking to brother Andrew I said well you know maybe maybe these lingering symptoms and these surgeries that I've been going through through our our reminder to me of what God has done that I would consider what he did because it's so easy to run off and not take time to consider a as we would read in in Luke chapter 10 I believe it is how there was 10 lepers and and they came crying out to God and beseeching un them saying Oh Lord Would You Deliver Us from this condition and oh my god he's a god of love he's a god of compassion he's a god of Grace the that's that's why there's Church buildings filled all over the world because he's a god of love he's a god of Grace he's a god of compassion he's not selfish he has a law he heals and he provides to people who never even give him the time of day but maybe just because they asked with no intention of living right with no intention of change in the way they conduct himself but he's a good god he's a God full of love and grace and compassion and here these 10 lepers he said look be be thou cleansed and he said now go show yourself to the priest and as they were going along their way all of a sudden they were changed and the scripture say and one of them turned back with a loud voice and started to give glory and honor and praise he took time I don't know what happened to the other night maybe they were so excited they ran to their families maybe they they were so excited they ran and got in line to show themselves to the priest I don't know what happened to the other night but one of them recognized the source one of them recognized and turned and said oh Lord thank you for healing me thank you for changing me Lord than thank you and he said arise like faith has made you whole go on my way I say oh God I want my life to be one big loud voice of praise to you I want to take the time and give the consideration to the things that you have done to your grace and to your mercy that you've performed in my life not only have you written my name on the Lamb's Book of Life but you've been so gracious you've been so faithful You' you've given me so many blessings you've touched my life so many times you've done so many things oh God forgive me let me take a moment and consider what you have done thinking on that when I was a little younger and maybe not as wise I was driving my truck at a high rate of speed oddly enough coming back from some meetings I believe in Louisiana and um I get that truck going you think I drive fast now I've done really good I uh I was driving pretty quick I was with Martin Walman and uh you know you get out on those highways and you know the the truckers all stay on the right but then you know they'll get in the other lane to pass well you know if you're driving at a pretty good clip of speed when they start to get over usually you got some time to go around them and keep going because sometimes depending on how the terrain is they can get over in that left lane and it's like are you ever going to pass that other guy well you know I I was a frequent to doing that and so I'd got over and I I was cruising up and and I'd got there and that little window was closing down and it was getting a little bit narrower and narrower and and I thought I'll go ahead and do it and Mar was like Matthew don't do it and I kind of I kind of uh I I I got a little hesitant I I I committed to it and all of a sudden I instead of maybe I don't know what I had time to do alls I know is I had already gotten over and and because I had to shoot the Gap faster I had to overcorrect to try to stay in a lane and I don't know how fast I was going at that time maybe 80 90 miles per hour my truck started to fishtail and it started losing this way and then going back that way and it went all the way swinging back and hit the semi I was beside and shot me across this is on I20 shot me across the meting I was going so fast that if I wouldn't have hit that semi I would have no doubt we'd have rolled there's no question we'd have rolled because I my truck swerved all the way sideways and hit that Semite and straightened me out and shot me straight across the median into the opposite side of traffic across I20 and the next thing I saw there was a bridge with the pillars that come down the highway goes like this and you know that little concrete spot that goes like that with a little triangle my truck shot through there three more feet up you're getting the top of your car chopped off we shot through that Gap ramped out there into the air and all a sudden come down and stuck Steel I was stuck in the mud my truck had a little dent on it brother brandom is still preaching we could have died God had spared my life and spared Martin's life because he had other plans for our life but I thought about it why was I stuck in the mud because in my youth you know alls I had to do because I was facing the wrong way when I come through there I just had to throw on my blinker get back on the highway get the next overpass and drive home my truck was fine but God said no son you're going to think about it a little bit so we had to call a wrecker beautiful weather out it was fine and I still got the receipt from that recer service but it would have been so easy for me to have just threw on the blinker and said man that was a close one I sure I sure was able to maneuver through that little Gauntlet there and save us no no son if I wouldn't have intervened if I hadn't have thoughts for you if I hadn't had a plan for your life if I hadn't had lined out everything you were going one way but but I had to intervene on your behalf and so I had to take a little time and consider what had happened there and this brings me back to really where I was trying to go and just talking about considering what God has done is it was it was the year 2019 here a few years back and was one of the hardest years of my life where we had went and performed uh the wedding for my cousin charity and not a month later she went to be with the Lord and it was that same year that my brother Aaron uh moved to begin a church in Arizona and so uh that was very hard on me and just a lot of challenges in that year of 2019 and I remember when we found out we were going to have a son I going to have a baby I felt like it it it spoke of Victory I just something in my heart was like I need a I need a bright spot I I feel like I've been going through a lot of Trials and a lot of hurt and a lot of pain and and and I need some Victory and I just felt like you know the news of having a child was was that was that was that gift from God you know something that would would be a victory in my life and and I could tell the whole testimony about uh Evan how he came forth which was also a challenge in itself that's why I call him an Ephesians 28 baby because his his name really means Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are you saved through faith and that out of yourselves it is a gift of God but but I was just I remember making the statement that 2020 was going to be a year of Victory I thought hey man if if 2019 has been this hard Lord I Need A year of Victory and so as the year 2020 Came Upon Us I was having some symptoms and I realized I needed to go uh to the doctor see they have natural intervention I mean think about it they're all excited because the cowboy scored a touchdown and it's all going to burn right but if they could only have divine intervention and they'd realize all that screaming and hollering doesn't no good it's all going to burn that's why we're sitting here tonight some of you would have been watching it some of you wouldn't be in this place tonight you'd be somewhere watching a ball game but what happened divine intervention when people ask you why aren't you watching the Cowboy game divine intervention you know why why why can't you work on Wednesday night divine intervention why can't you work on Sunday divine intervention why don't you care for the things of the world divine intervention well when you take some time and just start to consider how God intervened in your life I think if they can get excited about a football game w we can get excited about God's divine intervention cuz I was going one way I I should have died under an underpass but God intervened on my behalf and so I was just thinking how I you know I wanted a year of Victory I I I I was just speaking it and claiming it and right after Evan was born I started some symptoms and I felt that I needed to go get them checked out and I went to the doctor and I remember pulling up in front of the doctor just to not to be too transparent but I was having some some blood in my urine and I it would just it was ever so often but I realize just you know you you be around a little bit you realize there's certain things you should ignore I don't care how spiritual you think you are you know but in my youth God was teaching me something because I've always you know I've never had insurance usually and and and I've always just you know you just try to muscle through things and and I remember uh thinking about some people you know like well yeah man if I had this or I had that man bless God I'm Healed why would I ever go do this and that well you know sometimes God gots to take you one way to help teach you a few things you think you know how you that's that's that's the problem with a lot of us is we always know how somebody else should handle their situation never having gone through it yourself you think you know how Brother David should run the church never having been a pastor never had to put up with the pressure never had to put up with the burden never having to honor what God Said over what he feelings and knowing that that might hurt an individual but because to be faithful to what God's told him to do but we got it all figured out well what you you walk a little what's that saying you walk a little bit in somebody's shoes you might find out it's completely different you might you might think so I I I remember sometimes in my youth thinking about doctors and things like that not never critical of anybody but just in myself I thought well if it happens to me this is the way I'd handle it I never in a a way that would have diminished or or thought about somebody else but just in my mind maybe how I thought I would handle something and and I just getting a little bit older you know I I just figured hey you know with these symptoms maybe I had go go to a doctor you know forgetting to realize that brother brandham said it's your duty to go to the doctor he says that a handful of times it's your duty to go to the doctor and so I remember pulling up in front of that doctor's office just would be just a few more minutes I apologize I thought we'd be quicker but I I remember um pulling up there in in my heart I said Lord by your stripes I'm already healed and and and and a clear voice said back to me yes but it wasn't until M was on the operating table that I intervened and I I that was profound to me I didn't know all what it meant I understood the story I understood the situation but how that applied to me it was God telling me as his son son go ahead like here's a Divine Prophet taking his wife to the doctors preaches Divine Hill he's going to the doctor I realize okay I I I'm going to go ahead I'm going to go through the process because I know God can use uh doctors he said you know it's your duty to go to the doctor and so it was on uh 220 2020 it was February 20th 2020 I went in there finally got through the certain uh doctors to the urologist and Doctor Graves great name for a doctor Dr Graves is his co- doctor Dr Ash figure that one out he took one look up there and he said that's cancer he said we got to get it out he scheduled he scheduled the surgery four days later he scheduled the chemo treatments and we were set to go and 4 days later I went in to have this tumor removed I remember the doctor came in and uh Dr Graves always appreciated that he was a Christian he came in before the surgery he laid his hands on me he prayed for me and uh then the anesthesiologist came in and uh started that process of the anesthesia and I can now having done some other surgeries this is all kind of goes in helps me understand the testimony a little bit better but I was talking to a nurse about it you know anesthesia you know that that thing's undefeated I mean you can I think it's it's to me it's I'm actually it's amazing to me because it don't matter who or what they got the tools and the ability to put you out you you just think you're hanging on keep running your mouth you know hey but but but God allowed something on my this first visit there because I had tried these other times to make it back to the uh surgery room because what happened in this first time is they gave me the anesthesia and and and I got back there and and to make it to the operating room table conscious is extremely rare because the the anesthe you don't know this but they're with you and they're trying to put you out you ain't supposed to be talking to those doctors throwing you on the surgery table and and now I know what a surgery table is it isn't a nice little comfy bed with a little pillow there and we'll get you all comfy no man you're like a science project it is a cold sterile piece of Steel and they threw me up on top of that and and I was talking talking to some of the doctors there the doctor's assistants and they looked at me and said look you ain't supposed to be awake back here it's rare that anybody ever makes it back this far he said it's time for you to go to your happy place and I and I remember so vividly I said my happy place is the word of God and I said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and I woke up I'm in the recovery room it's like wait a sec y'all haven't even done nothing like nope it's all it's all done what do you mean it's all done when the lights go out they go out and and I had I had woke up there in the recovery room and we uh just trying to wrap up quickly but I was there in the recovery room and uh they actually I guess they call it outpatient surgery for whatever reason I never know why but they sent me home that same day which in my circumstance was was was not good because we had to go to the emergency room we had excessive uh bleeding in the bladder and and it created some very big uh problems that could have been very detrimental even life-threatening if if I'd have been a little bit more intuitive I have went to the emergency room quicker and not made my wife a nervous wreck but we got there and they did the proper things they needed to do to get us stabilized and and the next day I remember uh Dr Graves coming into the room and I said Dr Graves what's going on he goes it's just the devil and I said there's the best answer from a doctor I have ever heard I mean wouldn't it be nice you come to the doctor and then you say to the doctor hey doctor what's wrong with me goes it's just the devil and I said that's exactly right best diagnosis I've ever heard he said hey I want to come check with you it seems like you're doing good everything's the recovery is now going well he said but we got the lab results coming in and I want to go down there and see the lab results and I'll never forget it seemed like he came back with with with such meaning when he came back in the room it seemed like he was in an urgency to come back cuz he came in the room he goes I had to come back and tell you he said look I've been doing this for 40 years and I've never seen this in 40 years of practice but we've gotten the results on your lab work and it says you're cancer free it said there there's no cancer life in that tumor he's like we don't even have to do a a chemotherapy cuz there's no C the life of the Cancer's gone so the surgery would have been on a Monday I believe we ended up in uh the the emergency room on Tuesday we were held over and it was a Wednesday night I believe our pastor was given a report brother Billy if you can just get ready to come take take the service but I remember it was the evening on a Wednesday night our pastor was was giv a report on my condition and I and I was just streaming in and and I remember he said these words he said he said when they were doing the surgery on Matthew uh he says God took the life out of the cancer out of the tumor and then that's it struck me it it was just as God had said he said yes but it wasn't until M was on the operating table that intervened well you know what's amazing about our carnal mind you know I struggle I I it was so Supernatural what God did on that and I accepted it and I believed that but there was this one portion of me that just I I I I couldn't understand the operating table part because ma technically wasn't on an operating table she was going in for an exam and being so carnally minded I even started looking up doctor exam tables to see if they did operations on the same table or something because God told me but here's the here's the thing is I'm trying to figure that out when why does it even matter but God because he loves us so much and I wanted an answer I just held it close to my heart as a question because I I'd given this testimony you know around uh going out preaching and everything and and and I even had considered saying it differently well maybe I'll just say and I just remember God just telling me son it wasn't the doctor that performed the operation and I just realized oh I'm sorry Lord I it wasn't the doctor's operating table it was God's operating table God can use a doctor or God can use a donkey I don't care how he does it just let him do it and when he does it I think we ought to take some time and consider what he's done has God ever intervened on your behalf what does it say back here I just want to read that before I turn it over he says and then when he does I just wonder if we would be able to understand it why don't we all just stand as we're about to read anyways I just wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even would we consider him I just wanted to take an opportunity to speak to you and just tell you in my heart that I said Lord I I recognize that you divinely intervened in my life and delivered me from what the doctor called cancer and he he did such a sovereign quick work I feel like maybe what happened is I had just kind of moved on down the road a little bit and didn't give him the proper praise take the time to consider that that battle could have been much different could have been much longer I could have suffered a lot more but God rich in Mercy he intervened on my behalf and I want to say that God's intervened on your behalf time and time again and I just want to encourage you let's just take a little time tonight as we go to the communion table and thank him for his goodness and for his Mercy for his grace and really cons the blood that was shed on your behalf because his divine intervention you could be free tonight and enjoy his blessings because we're his beneficiary God bless [Applause] you amen wonderful amen aren't you thankful for God in the things that he does for us amen you know the scripture says that Abraham he considered the greatness of the one who made the promise it's not that we are somewhat deserving of the promise but the question is who made the promise he knew that God will keep his word and and and I like to tell people you know we here it's we are here as God's testimony um the reason why we have time to even come to church you know the reason why we are here day in and day out it's not because we somewhat conquer the world and done things and then that way we are also set so we can be here here no God made a way that we could get gather here he he called each and every one of us and we we had a desire to serve him he he gave you a job that would allow you to come to church he made a way so each one our testimony is not our own strength Our Testimony is that he made a way that we could be here and all we can do is just testify God I'm so thankful oh why do you go to church three times because God made a way that I can go through three times why do you go to church because God made a way he saved me out of my trouble he saved me out of my sins he gave me a way for me to go and worship him I'm only here as a testimony I tell you that will say we're not different from the people out in the street the only difference is the grace of God has been made known and available unto us that's why we praise Him amen if the uh we'll read the scriptures in 1 Corinthians was thinking about when brother Matthew was talking about the Anastasia I remember it's such a you don't know whether you're alive or dead you're just somewhere you can't dream or or anything you're just out and then all of the sudden when you wake up everything is done amen am Man 1 Corinthians 13 we CH will'll start uh I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 11 we'll start from the 23rd it says that for I have received of the Lord if the brothers can go get the communion ready for I reive of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do in remembrance of me I want to say this it's in remembrance of his grace his his Mercy his word everything we we don't come to the table remembering somebody else we remember what is done for us so we could be here so when we eat it is an action of Thanksgiving Lord I'm thankful thank you in remembrance of me and after the same manner he he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do do the this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till I come wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and blood of the Lord he said but let every man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we would not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home and and come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come
