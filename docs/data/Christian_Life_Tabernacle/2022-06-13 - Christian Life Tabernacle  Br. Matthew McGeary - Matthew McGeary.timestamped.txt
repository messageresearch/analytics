[35:37] just speaking to you for a little bit by
[35:39] god's help if you want to go ahead and
[35:41] turn in your bibles to john chapter 16.
[35:52] amen always like to keep my bible up
[35:54] here open while i'm preaching
[35:56] there was one time i i don't know how it
[35:58] come into my mind but i went to close it
[36:00] and something said you're not preaching
[36:02] from a closed book so i said okay i just
[36:05] i like to keep it open so if you ever
[36:07] see me struggling around or whatnot i i
[36:09] just like to keep it open
[36:11] john 16 we'll be reading verses 12 and
[36:14] 13
[36:15] amen how many feel good this evening
[36:19] wonderful praise god
[36:21] john chapter 16 verse 12 would read i
[36:23] have yet many things to say unto you but
[36:25] ye cannot bear them now
[36:29] how be it when he
[36:31] so they were not able to bear it at this
[36:33] time but he's showing them that when the
[36:35] time comes
[36:36] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[36:38] come he will guide you into all truth
[36:40] for he shall not speak of himself but
[36:42] whosoever he
[36:44] but whosoever he shall hear that shall
[36:46] he speak and he will show you things to
[36:50] come amen we ask a blessing upon the
[36:51] reading of the word you may be seated
[36:54] also we'd like you to turn with us in
[36:55] our bibles to first corinthians chapter
[36:57] two
[36:59] i just love this chapter it would be
[37:02] good just to read the whole thing
[37:04] for the sake of time we'll start with
[37:06] verse nine
[37:08] amen we'll just see how the lord uh
[37:10] would lead us
[37:12] um
[37:14] right now just to uh see how how which
[37:17] want to lay a foundation and it might
[37:19] just be a foundation the whole time
[37:20] could be a lot of quotes and a lot of
[37:23] scriptures but we just want to lay it in
[37:25] there
[37:26] this thought we have on our heart and uh
[37:28] just reading in first corinthians
[37:30] chapter 2 verse 9 through 16
[37:33] would read like this
[37:35] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9
[37:38] it says but as it is written i hath not
[37:40] seen
[37:42] nor ear heard neither have it entered
[37:44] into the heart of men
[37:47] the things which god hath prepared for
[37:49] them that love him
[37:52] but i like this next verse
[37:54] but god hath revealed them unto us
[37:58] by his spirit for the spirit searcheth
[38:00] all things yea the deep things of god
[38:03] for what man knoweth the things
[38:06] of a man save the spirit
[38:08] of a man which is in him so if we were
[38:10] left to our own self if we were left our
[38:12] own devices if we were left our own
[38:14] thinking then the only thing we could
[38:16] ever think of the only thing that we
[38:18] could ever perceive would be what we
[38:19] would experience in this natural realm
[38:21] as a man and that's what the whole world
[38:24] is doing they're basing all their
[38:25] thoughts and all their ideas and
[38:28] all through life experiences because
[38:30] that's the only thing that they can
[38:32] judge their life by is by the spirit
[38:34] that's within them but he says for what
[38:37] knoweth a man the things of man say the
[38:38] spirit of a man which is in him even so
[38:41] the things of god knoweth no man but
[38:44] the spirit of god so the only way we
[38:47] could know the things of god is by what
[38:50] by the spirit of god now we have
[38:52] received not the spirit of the world
[38:54] come on we have not received the spirit
[38:56] of the world but the spirit which is of
[38:58] god that we might know the things that
[39:01] are freely given to us
[39:03] oh praises wonderful names something has
[39:05] been given to the bride in the end time
[39:08] we have received something which things
[39:10] also we speak not in words which man's
[39:13] wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost
[39:15] teaches so what what do we want to teach
[39:17] us the holy ghost
[39:19] god has ordained a five full ministry
[39:21] but it takes that great tutor it takes
[39:23] the holy ghost to take that word and to
[39:26] bring it and reveal it to your heart and
[39:27] to teach it to you which the holy ghost
[39:29] teaches comparing spiritual things with
[39:31] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[39:34] not the things of the spirit of god
[39:38] for they are foolishness unto him
[39:41] neither can he know them because they
[39:43] are spiritually discerned
[39:45] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[39:48] things yet he himself is judged of no
[39:51] man
[39:52] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[39:56] that he may instruct him who hath known
[39:59] the mind of god
[40:02] oh he
[40:04] paul lays down this question who has
[40:06] known the mind of god and if if if we
[40:08] were to maybe if we were to ask
[40:10] ourselves that question and we were
[40:12] trying to to speak from a natural man
[40:15] if we're trying to speak from the spirit
[40:17] of a man and say oh my who has known the
[40:20] mind of god but you realize that's what
[40:22] man has been doing all down through the
[40:23] church ages they've been probing at the
[40:26] mind of god with the spirit of a man
[40:29] maybe many times they're trying to to
[40:31] figure it all out and they're trying to
[40:33] say well this is maybe what he meant in
[40:34] this symbol and that type and they're
[40:36] trying to reason amongst them but oh
[40:39] when god comes by by divine revelation
[40:42] and by the holy ghost that teaches us
[40:44] these things here the messenger to the
[40:47] age paul he's saying oh who hath known
[40:50] the mind of the lord or who may instruct
[40:52] him but look at these words that follow
[40:57] what a statement
[40:59] what a declaration that that he could
[41:01] stand there and write to those
[41:02] corinthians and say
[41:04] but we
[41:06] have
[41:07] the mind
[41:09] of christ
[41:10] oh if that don't make you excited in the
[41:13] hour and the season that we're living in
[41:15] that we have
[41:17] the mind of christ i want to speak to
[41:20] you a little bit uh this evening on the
[41:22] deep things of god revealed by the
[41:25] spirit the deep things revealed the deep
[41:28] things of god revealed by the spirit and
[41:31] in the pergamy and church age the
[41:33] prophet would say this in the church age
[41:34] book i'm going to try to be measured uh
[41:37] uh focused uh not not get too excited
[41:40] try to try to plumb a line here plow a
[41:42] plow a path we'll see how that god would
[41:44] lead but in the permian church age it
[41:46] says in john 14 26 but the comforter
[41:51] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[41:53] will send in my name he shall teach you
[41:55] all things we are trying to have them
[41:58] able to bring this up for you so you can
[42:00] follow along we just maybe gonna lay in
[42:02] quote after quote and and just uh maybe
[42:04] bring something before you and then
[42:06] if god would lead maybe we'll come back
[42:08] later and and break some of these things
[42:10] down but we just feel in our heart just
[42:12] to move uh uh uh quickly through some of
[42:14] these things
[42:15] pergamy and church age in john
[42:17] 14 26 but the comforter which is the
[42:20] holy ghost whom the father will send to
[42:22] my name he shall teach you all things
[42:26] and bring all things to your remembrance
[42:29] whatsoever i have said unto you here
[42:31] again we find the word coming because of
[42:35] the spirit of god
[42:36] we find the word coming because of the
[42:39] spirit of god again in john 16 13 how be
[42:42] it when he the spirit of truth
[42:44] word
[42:45] is come he will guide you into all truth
[42:49] thy word is truth and he shall not speak
[42:52] of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[42:55] word of god
[42:57] shall that shall he speak word
[43:00] and he will show you things to come
[43:03] notice he will show you things to come
[43:05] spirit
[43:07] bringing the word of prophecy not just i
[43:10] want to highlight that and emphasize
[43:12] that the spirit bringing the word of
[43:15] prophecy i want you to note very
[43:17] carefully that jesus did not say the
[43:19] evidence of being baptized with the holy
[43:21] ghost was speaking in tongues
[43:22] interpreting prophesying or shouting and
[43:26] dancing he said the evidence would be
[43:29] that you would be in the truth
[43:31] [Music]
[43:36] the evidence
[43:37] of the holy ghost in your life is that
[43:40] you are in truth
[43:42] thy word is truth
[43:45] you would be in the word of god for your
[43:48] age
[43:49] oh hallelujah evidence has to do now
[43:52] follow this evidence has to do with
[43:55] receiving
[43:56] that word
[43:58] so that word that has come in our age
[44:00] the spirit of truth that has brought the
[44:03] word of prophecy that has come by divine
[44:06] promise the evidence that the holy ghost
[44:09] is in your life is that you're in the
[44:10] truth that god has delivered in this age
[44:13] all the deep things of god revealed by
[44:16] his spirit so we see that paul here is
[44:17] writing he said oh i have not seen
[44:21] nor ear heard
[44:22] neither has it entered into the hearts
[44:24] and minds of men's those things that god
[44:27] has prepared to them
[44:29] but god has revealed them to us
[44:32] by his spirit
[44:34] look jesus was telling the disciples i
[44:36] have many things to say to you
[44:39] i have many things to say to you but you
[44:41] cannot bear them right now it's not the
[44:44] time it's not the season this isn't the
[44:46] hour i can tell you these things that i
[44:49] want to tell you but there's coming a
[44:50] time
[44:51] there's coming a season i'm making a way
[44:54] i've got these very things these truths
[44:56] these words that i want to speak to you
[44:58] i'm going to send the holy ghost i'm
[45:01] going to send the comforter and he's
[45:02] going to lead you he's going to guide
[45:04] you into all truth and all righteousness
[45:06] then it would be the time then it would
[45:08] be the season that these things that i
[45:09] want to say to you i can't say them
[45:11] right now or maybe they're sealed up
[45:13] maybe i haven't revealed them but
[45:15] there's coming a time there's coming an
[45:16] hour there's coming a season that i'm
[45:18] going to reveal these words that i want
[45:20] to speak to you but oh it's not the time
[45:22] right now but the time is coming when
[45:25] that spirit of prophecy comes when the
[45:27] holy ghost come he's going to teach you
[45:29] and lead you and guide you into all
[45:30] truth and righteousness
[45:32] what is the evidence of the holy ghost
[45:34] it's receiving the word of your age
[45:38] which has come by what the spirit of
[45:40] prophecy is come by malachi 4 5 luke 17
[45:43] 30 revelations 10 we're walking in the
[45:46] light as he was in the light we have
[45:48] fellowship one with another and the
[45:50] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[45:52] all our sins
[45:54] and so as we as we just look back into
[45:56] the bible and and we ponder these things
[45:59] we can look at abraham the father of our
[46:01] faith and you pick up there in genesis
[46:03] 12 and abraham was a heaven
[46:07] name was abram he was a heaven
[46:10] and he come
[46:11] from a heathen family but what made
[46:13] abraham different
[46:15] god had a plan for his life
[46:18] that's what made abraham different
[46:20] abraham's name was on the lamb's book of
[46:22] life abraham was a predestinated a child
[46:25] of god that god had a purpose that he
[46:27] wanted to work out in abraham's life
[46:32] see he was just an ordinary man just
[46:34] like you or i or would be a ordinary
[46:38] if you would just maybe look at the
[46:39] world in a whole head there's many of us
[46:42] that have come from certain uh the
[46:45] same conditions and same countries and
[46:47] and people have worse stories and some
[46:49] people have better stories but sure we
[46:51] could find people we have things in
[46:53] common and oh i you know yeah i lived
[46:55] over here you lived over there oh my
[46:57] family went through this i went through
[46:58] that yes my family come from that all of
[47:00] those things but what makes you
[47:02] different
[47:04] the call of god upon your life
[47:06] and that's what made abraham different
[47:08] there in genesis 12 because there came a
[47:11] call unto abraham
[47:13] and there came a call and god made
[47:16] abraham a promise and all of a sudden
[47:18] you see something set forth in abraham
[47:20] now in genesis 12 there's a call of god
[47:23] upon his life and we can start to look
[47:25] into
[47:26] abraham's life and just see how god
[47:29] started to deal with him and god made
[47:31] him a promise
[47:34] god made abraham a promise and he said
[47:36] this promise is unto you
[47:38] and your seat after you
[47:41] and the brother brandon would actually
[47:43] take two books and he would he would set
[47:45] them up in front of the church and he
[47:46] said now i'm going to set two books up
[47:48] like this
[47:49] so that you can see that the promise was
[47:51] to abraham
[47:53] and his seed after him
[47:55] so that we can see if the way god dealt
[47:58] with abraham
[48:00] then he's going to deal with us
[48:02] we know the natural seed
[48:04] that was promised was isaac
[48:07] but the spiritual seed the royal seat
[48:09] was christ
[48:11] and the way that god dealt with abraham
[48:13] he deals with the royal seed what when
[48:15] he made him an unconditional covenant he
[48:18] made it an unconditional promise that
[48:20] said abraham it ain't about what you've
[48:22] done
[48:23] it ain't about what you can do but this
[48:25] is something that i'm doing this is
[48:27] something that i have chosen to do i'm
[48:29] making an unconditional covenant with
[48:31] you abraham that you're going to be a
[48:32] father of many nations i'm going to give
[48:35] you a promised land and there's nothing
[48:37] abraham this doesn't have to do with
[48:38] what you're going to do this has nothing
[48:40] to do with your abilities this has
[48:42] nothing to do with you bringing the
[48:44] promise into manifestation this has
[48:46] everything to do with the unconditional
[48:48] covenant that i've made with you and now
[48:50] we can actually see abraham in his
[48:52] journey in the book of genesis and how
[48:55] genesis 12
[48:57] there's a type of sanctification the
[48:59] call of god upon abraham's life and then
[49:01] you jump over it you go
[49:03] the 13th chapter 14th chapter 15 chapter
[49:06] you find now that god starts to confirm
[49:08] the covenant with abraham
[49:11] uh a type of sanctification we can see
[49:14] these types of that how god dealt with
[49:16] abraham we see a type how he deals with
[49:18] us we see a type how he deals with the
[49:20] church how he deals with the individual
[49:22] how he deals with the church ages so we
[49:24] see in genesis chapter 12
[49:26] it's justification it's a call of god
[49:27] upon his life and then comes genesis
[49:30] chapter 15 and now now he's sanctifying
[49:33] he's confirming the covenant with
[49:34] abraham and then you have a couple more
[49:36] chapters later and then now we're into
[49:38] chapter 17 and in chapter 17 now what is
[49:42] he doing he's he's changing his name
[49:44] he's given the seal of circumcision a
[49:46] type of the holy ghost a type of the
[49:48] restoration of the gifts in the church
[49:50] uh what is he doing god is moving
[49:53] his son that he has a plan for his life
[49:56] he's moving him deeper into the promise
[49:58] deeper into the manifestation i know my
[50:01] thoughts that i think towards you
[50:03] thoughts of peace not thoughts of evil
[50:05] to bring you to an expected end oh when
[50:08] god called you he didn't just call you
[50:10] call you out to say okay now you're
[50:11] identified with me make something of it
[50:16] no
[50:17] that's not what he did but he called you
[50:19] for a purpose this just comes to mind
[50:21] you i mean you don't go down to uh to
[50:23] walmart and buy a paint brush and bring
[50:26] it home and throw it on the counter and
[50:27] say well paint brush
[50:29] do your job
[50:31] and walk over just say
[50:33] you're a paint brush
[50:35] you ain't painted one thing in here
[50:38] paintbrush is going to look at you like
[50:39] you're the one who brought me home from
[50:40] the store
[50:42] i didn't buy me you bought me oh
[50:44] hallelujah hallelujah there was a price
[50:47] that i couldn't pay but god rich and
[50:50] mercy he's the one that bought you he's
[50:52] the one that paid the price oh don't you
[50:54] want to just run and scream and shout
[50:56] when our pastor read that quote look the
[50:58] only ones where the blood can be applied
[51:01] if your name was written in the lamb's
[51:03] book of life before the foundation of
[51:05] the world you're the only ones that the
[51:07] blood can be applied because you're the
[51:09] one that he died for
[51:12] then if he died for you don't you think
[51:14] he has a plan for your life he just
[51:17] shouldn't take you out of the pawn shop
[51:19] to just throw you away but no he has
[51:21] plans for he's going to take the wrapper
[51:23] off of you he's going to dip you in the
[51:25] paint bucket
[51:26] he's going to get you all soaked up and
[51:28] saturated with that good old paint and
[51:31] then he's going to what he's going to do
[51:32] he's going to take you and he's going to
[51:34] start putting the strokes on the wall
[51:36] the great master is going to put you in
[51:38] the service oh we need the holy ghost to
[51:41] pick us up and put us into service
[51:45] the problem is some of us don't want to
[51:47] come out the store
[51:50] i like i like people watching i like
[51:52] hearing the specials i like my pretty
[51:55] little rapper
[51:57] i look good in this little rapper
[51:59] 5.99
[52:01] i got value don't take that off from me
[52:03] it tells you tells everybody how much
[52:04] i'm worth
[52:06] and we're all worth what about 27 cents
[52:10] oh my i'm getting inspired now
[52:12] like that violin or it seemed like it
[52:15] had no value
[52:17] i tell you what there's a lot of crayons
[52:19] there's a lot of markers there's a lot
[52:21] of paint brush the only value it has is
[52:23] what it's made out but whose hand is it
[52:26] in oh put that in the hand of a master
[52:29] and let them go to work and it's it's
[52:31] invaluable
[52:33] it's worth ten thousand worlds
[52:36] i said god i want to be in your hand so
[52:39] here we find the journey of abraham uh
[52:42] god dealing with him through through
[52:44] through the book of genesis uh chapter
[52:47] 12 uh justification chapter 15
[52:50] sanctification chapter 17 now the holy
[52:53] ghost but the prophet i'm bringing us
[52:55] this way because i want to show you
[52:56] something because the prophet and in
[52:58] grace covenant uh the prophet would
[53:00] preach a sermon called uh
[53:02] abraham's grace covenant the the prophet
[53:06] is showing something uh it's it's really
[53:09] good so in genesis chapter seven he

[54:02] you to a place where you can speak the
[54:04] word
[54:06] the prophet would say uh abraham's grace
[54:08] company saying after he called him by
[54:10] justification sanctified him through the
[54:12] blood of the covenant
[54:14] given his own life in the 17th chapter
[54:17] the baptism of the holy ghost now what
[54:19] comes next in israel
[54:22] some of you bible scholars know
[54:25] there are no bible scholars here
[54:31] the placing
[54:33] of sons
[54:35] justification
[54:36] sanctification
[54:38] holy ghost
[54:40] but now
[54:41] we're moving in we're in the hour
[54:44] of the placing of sons we're coming into
[54:46] a maturity now
[54:47] we're we're not babes in christ anymore
[54:50] oh we don't have to be panted and petted
[54:52] and begged to come to church and
[54:55] and pleaded with and babied and and all
[54:58] this trial and that trial and getting
[55:00] all fussed up and and fighting and and
[55:03] getting in online battles with people
[55:05] you don't even know that the message is
[55:06] right quit wasting your time uh with
[55:08] those demons out there on the internet
[55:10] like you're going to talk one of them
[55:12] into even if you could talk them into
[55:14] the message guess what if their name
[55:16] wasn't on the lamb's book of life the
[55:18] blood couldn't even be applied
[55:21] oh if you want to really witness to
[55:22] somebody get in front of him
[55:24] look him in the eye
[55:26] tell him what god did for you say what
[55:28] he did for me he can do for you
[55:30] oh we're coming into maturity we move on
[55:33] down in that same service well we'll be
[55:35] reading right around paragraph 164
[55:37] he says all these years now watch the
[55:40] prophet is showing a beautiful type
[55:41] there in the book of genesis because
[55:43] he's showing look at chapter 12 and then
[55:46] it was
[55:47] a couple chapters later several years
[55:49] later chapter 15 a couple chapel
[55:51] chapters later several years later but
[55:54] then he's shown but right quick in the
[55:55] same chapter
[55:57] when the restoration of the gifts came
[56:00] there wasn't that much time watch how
[56:02] beautiful this he says all these years
[56:03] from justification to sanctification was
[56:05] a lap of years from sanctification till
[56:08] the confirmation the holy ghost was
[56:09] years but in the same chapter he placed
[56:12] him after the holy ghost
[56:14] pentecost is just something years old
[56:17] you know
[56:18] he began to place his sons
[56:20] martin luther preached justification
[56:23] years and years
[56:25] come sanctification years and years come
[56:28] the baptism of the holy ghost but right
[56:30] quick
[56:32] after pentecost did the same thing that
[56:34] the rest of them did then he began to
[56:37] pull his sons that stood for his truth
[56:43] he give them something special
[56:45] magnified and before the people with a
[56:48] certain thing that stood out see
[56:50] placed him
[56:51] see we're living in the hour of adoption
[56:54] we're living in the hour of the placing
[56:57] of sun oh don't you realize they're in
[56:59] the 1906 uh uh they're there the the
[57:03] spirit was poured out there on isuzu
[57:05] street there in los angeles and the
[57:07] spirit went to working mighty works
[57:09] through the people as there was a
[57:11] restoration of the gifts of the holy
[57:13] ghost in the church
[57:17] oh but but you look back at the church
[57:19] when when justification was preached
[57:21] then years
[57:23] 100 years later then comes
[57:26] sanctification
[57:28] 100 years later
[57:30] then come the restorations of the gift
[57:32] but then right quick
[57:34] in the same chapter
[57:36] in the same age
[57:39] in the same age that there was the
[57:41] outpouring of the restoration of the
[57:43] gift now right quick god moves in
[57:46] because what does he want to do he wants
[57:47] to bring the church or bring the bride
[57:50] into her position he wants to place the
[57:53] sons of god we're living in adoption
[57:56] time this this is the hour of
[57:58] manifestations of the sons of god the
[58:01] prophet would say this in adoption
[58:03] number four paragraph 79 he says verily
[58:05] i say unto you
[58:08] you that's the little gods
[58:10] if you'll say to this mountain be moved
[58:12] and don't doubt in your heart but
[58:14] believe that what you've said will come
[58:15] to pass you can have what you've said
[58:19] go right back to genesis to the original
[58:23] what is it now the world in nature is
[58:25] groaning crying everything's moving what
[58:28] for the manifestation of the sons of god

[58:41] together
[58:43] in a house full of true sons and true
[58:46] daughters of god

[58:51] have the mind of chris not probing here
[58:53] and they're not living a victorious life
[58:55] not living and overcoming like wondering
[58:57] what he said over there and and getting
[58:59] to get together and making a club and
[59:01] say yeah i think that's a good way we
[59:03] all can kind of see it that way no no no
[59:07] when when true sons
[59:10] born sons
[59:12] field sons speak
[59:15] and their word is packed

[59:59] maturity we've seen a first a sheaf wave
[1:00:02] coming to that maturity with the power
[1:00:05] of the spoken word speaking squirrels
[1:00:07] into existence speaking to the storm

[1:01:00] we didn't just receive a message and a
[1:01:02] prophet speaking all these things way
[1:01:04] off in the yonder
[1:01:06] and god manifesting these things in a
[1:01:08] prophet's life so we can just sit back

[1:01:34] my own life and you you're the very
[1:01:36] expression of me and if that spiritual

[1:02:05] a type in the individual and then we can
[1:02:06] look at joshua
[1:02:08] we can look at caleb and we look at the
[1:02:10] the children of israel in the exodus
[1:02:13] out of the promised land which is a type
[1:02:16] of the holy ghost
[1:02:18] and going in and possessing the land

[1:06:28] daughters of god in the end time
[1:06:32] oh hallelujah do you love them
[1:06:35] so we see these types of the restaurant
[1:06:36] oh my goodness
[1:06:38] whoa
[1:06:40] who we have we have a lot of
[1:06:42] let's go
[1:06:44] we see these types of the restoration of
[1:06:46] the church
[1:06:47] we we see it in abraham we see it in the
[1:06:49] exodus uh i'll be going back to the
[1:06:52] promised land and i just want to maybe
[1:06:54] say this because uh maybe not in this
[1:06:57] service but my heart's desire if we
[1:06:58] approach this again by god's grace i
[1:07:00] wouldn't really want to break some of
[1:07:01] these things down and and because we
[1:07:04] hear we are restoration now we hear that
[1:07:06] word all the time and we have we have
[1:07:08] new ones among us and maybe some that
[1:07:09] are younger and sometimes we use these
[1:07:11] big words and people are wondering what
[1:07:12] are you even talking about
[1:07:14] restoration why maybe if i could say it
[1:07:16] like this
[1:07:17] if you had a family
[1:07:19] but they were healthy
[1:07:21] got a good job and
[1:07:23] everybody had their strength
[1:07:24] you had a good place to stay you're able
[1:07:27] to pay the bills
[1:07:31] and you were blessed
[1:07:33] but all of a sudden maybe a sickness hit
[1:07:36] and maybe the breadwinner of the home
[1:07:40] maybe maybe he fell ill
[1:07:42] and maybe something else happened and
[1:07:44] then
[1:07:45] and then all all of this you know the
[1:07:47] home all sudden you lose your home
[1:07:49] and then you lose your car and
[1:07:51] and then everything that you had
[1:07:54] it seems like it's gone
[1:07:56] my my strong healthy family now now my
[1:07:59] my parents are sick and and i'm am i 13
[1:08:03] i i would i would go work if i can but i
[1:08:05] can't go work but see so your family or
[1:08:08] the church was in a condition
[1:08:12] where they were moving and in action
[1:08:15] they had been filled with the holy ghost
[1:08:18] the life that jesus lived the individual
[1:08:21] in the christian church was living also
[1:08:23] with signs and wonders following they
[1:08:26] were in their position now we're not
[1:08:27] we're talk we're not even talking first
[1:08:29] church age we're talking in that
[1:08:31] dispensation really before the church
[1:08:33] ages ushered in i'm talking about
[1:08:36] on the day of pentecost there come a
[1:08:38] sound like a mighty rushing wind and the
[1:08:40] great comforter come and they were
[1:08:41] endued with power on high and they went
[1:08:43] out with signs and wonders and and they
[1:08:46] were converting and all the church was a
[1:08:49] powerful church it was moving and it was
[1:08:51] action it was mark 16 in action but that
[1:08:54] anti-christ spirit come in and so god
[1:08:56] started dealing with the church it was
[1:08:58] twofold the church ages ushered in where
[1:09:00] god started to deal with the true vine
[1:09:01] and the false fine and this church that
[1:09:03] was strong
[1:09:05] and had its strength all of a sudden it
[1:09:07] started to get sick and it started to
[1:09:09] get weak and all of the power
[1:09:12] its ability to stand before men
[1:09:15] stand before denominations stand before
[1:09:18] that antichrist spirit
[1:09:19] oh he started to weave in his lies that
[1:09:22] that that antichrist spirit the white
[1:09:24] horse rider and all of a sudden the
[1:09:26] church got to a condition
[1:09:29] to where it had no more power
[1:09:32] but god promised all the years
[1:09:35] that the locust
[1:09:37] the caterpillar the canker the palmer
[1:09:39] worm i i'm going to restore that's
[1:09:41] restoration to bring the church back
[1:09:44] back to the condition it was in the
[1:09:46] beginning that that's that alpha church
[1:09:49] that alpha that alpha bride there's
[1:09:51] coming in the end time there's going to
[1:09:53] be one just like it an omega bride uh
[1:09:56] moving in the same power the same signs
[1:09:58] the same wonders so so we just we're
[1:10:01] looking at these types through abraham
[1:10:03] and and through joshua and caleb and the
[1:10:05] in the the wilderness journey going into
[1:10:08] the promised land these are all types
[1:10:10] that we can see what god was doing down
[1:10:11] to the church age and also how he was
[1:10:14] dealing with us as individuals
[1:10:16] you follow me
[1:10:18] another quote out of perfect faith i've
[1:10:20] just i love this quote here
[1:10:23] paragraph 39.
[1:10:31] i want you to get this now
[1:10:33] the church has got to lift itself in the
[1:10:37] power of god
[1:10:39] how
[1:10:40] we are too close to the end now and i
[1:10:43] believe the church is in a condition
[1:10:45] where we can teach it
[1:10:47] a little deeper things
[1:10:49] and rub out some of this make believe
[1:10:51] out see and get into something real
[1:10:57] is there somebody here that says i want
[1:11:00] to get
[1:11:01] into something real
[1:11:03] you ever heard that expression somebody
[1:11:04] come talking to you and say get real
[1:11:08] you know some of us
[1:11:09] hey
[1:11:10] has anybody ever checked your own self
[1:11:12] you're not in the world we used to you
[1:11:13] know we used to check people you know
[1:11:15] what that's about you you better you
[1:11:16] check yourself you walk into you you
[1:11:18] check them see what they're all about
[1:11:21] some of us need to go look in the mirror
[1:11:23] and say
[1:11:24] get real are you serious
[1:11:28] look it's not time to be pampered and
[1:11:30] babied well we don't we don't need a
[1:11:32] handout
[1:11:34] everybody doesn't get a trophy that's
[1:11:36] the society we're living in now but i'm
[1:11:38] sorry that's a deception everybody don't
[1:11:41] get a trophy for god so loved the world
[1:11:44] that he gave his only begotten son if
[1:11:45] your name wasn't written on the lamb's
[1:11:48] book of life you ain't getting a trophy
[1:11:52] and i just made a bunch of little
[1:11:53] leaguers mad
[1:11:55] but no we ought to get into something
[1:11:57] real the church we want to pull
[1:12:00] ourselves up into the power of god we're
[1:12:02] too close to the end now and i believe
[1:12:04] the church is in a condition where we
[1:12:06] can teach it a little deeper things and
[1:12:08] rub out some of this make-believe out
[1:12:10] and get into something real lord i want
[1:12:12] that
[1:12:13] is there somebody here that says you
[1:12:15] know what
[1:12:16] i don't care if i've accomplished a lot
[1:12:19] or i've accomplished a little lord that
[1:12:22] is me
[1:12:23] rub out to make belief lord
[1:12:26] oh i teach me the deeper things oh god i
[1:12:28] want to get into something real if i'm
[1:12:31] ever going to do something for you lord
[1:12:33] then i better get started there got to
[1:12:35] be a sincerity there got to be a
[1:12:37] desperation there got to be a cry in the
[1:12:40] heart and in the sons of god to come
[1:12:42] into that manifestation and the placing
[1:12:45] of sons and daughters in this hour that
[1:12:47] something is crying out for perfection
[1:12:51] it's got to be something that you know
[1:12:55] and if you say brother branham that
[1:12:57] isn't light

[1:15:39] truth
[1:15:41] because it comes from the word

[1:16:30] people with gifts of prophecies and
[1:16:33] prophets in the church part of the
[1:16:35] five-fold ministry but this man

[1:20:15] you couldn't be wrong my side has always
[1:20:17] declared to me that it was light see
[1:20:20] and that's the reason i believe those
[1:20:22] visions because it's always declared to
[1:20:23] me to be the truth
[1:20:25] because it comes from the word see
[1:20:27] then if he says that that settles it
[1:20:29] now when it's declared like that
[1:20:33] there's no more guesswork
[1:20:37] well we can stop there a while
[1:20:39] there's no more guesswork
[1:20:42] somebody's here is guessing
[1:20:45] yeah you think you like the girl

[1:21:24] thought she was going to look like my
[1:21:25] mom
[1:21:26] i thought she was i thought this and i i
[1:21:28] fought all that and then one day all of
[1:21:30] a sudden you get slapped upside the
[1:21:31] silly like oh my goodness i can't live
[1:21:33] without her
[1:21:35] just tear up no more there was no more
[1:21:37] guesswork
[1:21:38] and then we went through some trials you
[1:21:40] know just the season that where she was
[1:21:43] in that church you know i was just a
[1:21:44] wolf in sheep's clothing coming to
[1:21:46] distill away the daughter and i wasn't
[1:21:47] listening to their program and and so
[1:21:50] you know and so they thought oh you know
[1:21:52] what but guess what
[1:21:54] there was no guesswork between us
[1:21:57] we were in love i think that's the
[1:21:58] problem do are we all do
[1:22:02] are we impressed
[1:22:03] what i wonder
[1:22:06] if we're sufficiently impressed
[1:22:08] with his presence in our midst
[1:22:11] i wonder if we're in love with the
[1:22:12] message
[1:22:14] i wonder if we're in love with the lord
[1:22:16] jesus
[1:22:17] i wonder if we're we're looking at the
[1:22:19] revelation
[1:22:20] the seven seals those seven mysterious
[1:22:22] thunders that uh that have thundered out
[1:22:26] and i received the revelation what were
[1:22:28] those seals
[1:22:30] christ was those seals what was it
[1:22:33] revealing it was revealing christ oh
[1:22:36] my husband
[1:22:38] my redeemer there's no more guesswork
[1:22:43] no more guesswork it's going to be then
[1:22:45] you hear it's thus say the lord see
[1:22:46] because it's beyond
[1:22:48] human thinking
[1:22:51] it's up in the realms of the lord's
[1:22:54] thinking
[1:22:57] is that where you want to be
[1:23:03] all right let's try to race
[1:23:05] well the finish line is
[1:23:09] another day but
[1:23:10] let's run a little bit y'all want to run
[1:23:12] a little bit longer
[1:23:14] we got a few
[1:23:17] 6 10 right now
[1:23:18] take a few more moments so here in the
[1:23:19] first we read our text out of
[1:23:21] corinthians
[1:23:22] and this uh first corinthians two
[1:23:26] where we took our text but you know the
[1:23:28] book of corinthians is a book of
[1:23:30] a book of correction
[1:23:33] and paul was always having trouble
[1:23:35] keeping the corinthians straight
[1:23:39] he would write there and you know in the
[1:23:41] first chapter he'd say i beseech you
[1:23:44] first corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 he
[1:23:46] said i beseech you brother in the name
[1:23:48] of lord jesus christ that you all speak
[1:23:49] the same thing
[1:23:51] and there be no divisions among you but
[1:23:52] that you be perfectly joined together in
[1:23:54] the same mind and in the same judgment
[1:23:57] see the prophet of god said he couldn't
[1:23:59] teach the corinthians deep things he
[1:24:02] said they were just baby fashion
[1:24:05] one had a tongue one had interpretation
[1:24:07] one had a gift and one had a feeling one
[1:24:10] had a sensation but when it came to
[1:24:13] having a greater understanding of the
[1:24:15] word they were immature
[1:24:18] they were just babes in christ
[1:24:21] where he'd even write to him in in first
[1:24:22] corinthians chapter five he goes it's
[1:24:24] been reported to me uh that it's been
[1:24:26] reported commonly that there's uh that
[1:24:29] there's fornication among you
[1:24:33] see they were dealing with things and
[1:24:35] they were battling with things but but
[1:24:37] look don't don't get condemned
[1:24:40] the messenger of the age is writing to
[1:24:42] them
[1:24:44] but they were in a different stage than
[1:24:46] the prophet said look he couldn't write
[1:24:47] to the corinthians like he would write
[1:24:49] to the ephesians
[1:24:51] the ephesians they were they were grown
[1:24:53] and they were mature because the
[1:24:54] ephesians what is ephesians parallel
[1:24:56] ephesians parallels joshua ephesians a
[1:24:59] book of placings of sun it's a book of
[1:25:02] adoption
[1:25:03] that's what it perils so paul he
[1:25:05] couldn't write to the corinthians about
[1:25:07] that he'd write to the ephesians and say
[1:25:09] oh
[1:25:10] he has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:25:12] blessings you are seated in heavenly
[1:25:14] places in christ jesus you have been
[1:25:17] predestinated according to as he has
[1:25:19] chosen you before the foundation of the
[1:25:21] world that you would be holy and without
[1:25:24] blame before him and love the
[1:25:26] corinthians couldn't receive that
[1:25:28] they couldn't handle that they were just
[1:25:30] baby-fashioned but i believe the church
[1:25:32] now
[1:25:33] is in a condition
[1:25:35] where we can teach it a little deeper we
[1:25:37] can start to rub out some of this make
[1:25:39] belief and get into something real am i
[1:25:42] talking to somebody i say oh god forgive
[1:25:45] me for my for for my my my my faults and
[1:25:49] my failures
[1:25:52] the lord i realize what you're wanting
[1:25:54] to do you're wanting to take me into
[1:25:56] something deeper you're wanting to take
[1:25:58] me into something higher
[1:26:01] then i could rub out some of this make
[1:26:02] believe and get into something real in
[1:26:04] first corinthians chapter three
[1:26:07] verse one
[1:26:10] we'll try to just be about 10 more
[1:26:12] minutes i don't want to keep you too
[1:26:13] long we're laying in a lot
[1:26:15] and uh
[1:26:16] we can't finish any house so
[1:26:19] we'd rather
[1:26:20] leave you wanting more than
[1:26:22] saying when is this guy going to get
[1:26:23] done
[1:26:28] first corinthians chapter 3 verse 1
[1:26:30] would read like this
[1:26:32] and i brethren could not speak unto you
[1:26:34] as unto spiritual but as under carnal
[1:26:37] even as unto babes in christ i have fed
[1:26:39] you with milk
[1:26:41] and not with meat
[1:26:43] for hitherto you were not able to bear
[1:26:45] it neither yet now are you able
[1:26:48] now remember our text in john 16 12.
[1:26:52] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:26:54] but you cannot bear them now
[1:26:57] so there's a time and a season there's a
[1:27:00] growing there is a maturing
[1:27:03] i have not fed you with meat
[1:27:06] but i have fed you with milk well lord
[1:27:09] thank you for the milk
[1:27:10] if you need the
[1:27:12] the sincere milk of the word
[1:27:14] praise god it's there for you that you
[1:27:16] might grow thereby
[1:27:19] but you don't feed a baby steak
[1:27:22] there's any young expecting mothers or
[1:27:24] fathers here
[1:27:26] don't give your two-month-old steak
[1:27:31] matter of fact they recommend i think
[1:27:33] you shouldn't give them honey
[1:27:36] there there's there's certain things
[1:27:38] that a baby is not mature enough to
[1:27:41] digest
[1:27:43] so you have to you have to you have to
[1:27:46] you have to give it the sincere milk
[1:27:48] that it might grow there by but there
[1:27:50] comes a time and a season in the child's
[1:27:54] life when i say mama
[1:27:57] i'm ready for something more than milk
[1:28:03] and that's where the church is oh praise
[1:28:05] god for the sincere
[1:28:07] meal but we've come into a season now
[1:28:09] paul is telling the corinthians look
[1:28:10] i've given you milk but you can't handle
[1:28:13] the meat you weren't able to bury oh it
[1:28:15] wasn't the time it wasn't the season it
[1:28:18] was it wasn't the hour for it
[1:28:22] there has to come a time in the season
[1:28:24] look it's hot outside right now
[1:28:27] i don't really recommend planting right
[1:28:29] now
[1:28:31] i don't recommend laying sod
[1:28:34] you need to put i would
[1:28:36] probably put it down in the spring
[1:28:38] when the heat of the sun is less intense
[1:28:42] now sure i'm setting this up for a
[1:28:43] wonderful quote
[1:28:46] nobody can say it like the prophet
[1:28:49] but there was there's a time and there's
[1:28:50] a season
[1:28:52] just like in the church ages the the
[1:28:54] rising of the sun and has it as it went
[1:28:57] and went through the church ages look
[1:28:58] the the early church that they couldn't
[1:29:01] they couldn't receive the things that
[1:29:02] we've received in this age because it
[1:29:04] wasn't the time it wasn't the season but
[1:29:06] in a turn on the light in 64 paragraph
[1:29:09] 66 he says but the thing is today
[1:29:12] the church crane don't want to mature
[1:29:16] now i think we need to make that
[1:29:18] personal
[1:29:21] we need to grow up
[1:29:24] we get really comfortable
[1:29:27] being the vindicated
[1:29:30] overcoming
[1:29:31] believers
[1:29:33] who are going in a rapture
[1:29:35] who can't fail
[1:29:36] we're predestinated not to make it
[1:29:40] yes all that is true
[1:29:43] but let's quit wasting our time
[1:29:48] let's grow up
[1:29:50] and the things we're doing in our spare
[1:29:52] time and our private time let's quit ye
[1:29:56] like man let's grow up church
[1:29:58] let's get real
[1:30:00] let's get into something real i i pray
[1:30:02] we have time to get to this quote
[1:30:04] because there has been something
[1:30:07] so powerful
[1:30:09] opened up to the bride of jesus christ
[1:30:11] in this hour
[1:30:13] that if we could all get in one mind
[1:30:16] we could all get in one accord
[1:30:18] under the shed blood of god with the
[1:30:20] power of the holy ghost in action and
[1:30:22] moving amongst us watch out
[1:30:25] what could happen then
[1:30:29] but it wants to stay back in moody's
[1:30:30] time sankey finney knocks calvin
[1:30:33] they were all right they were the light
[1:30:35] of the hour but this is another hour
[1:30:37] this is another day this is the
[1:30:38] advancement of the gospel it's coming to
[1:30:42] its maturity now back to first
[1:30:45] corinthians reading uh chapter 3 verse 3
[1:30:49] but for yet ye are carnal
[1:30:52] for whereas there is among you envyin
[1:30:55] and strife and divisions are ye not
[1:30:58] carnal and walk as men
[1:31:02] are you not just
[1:31:04] living by the spirit of a man that's
[1:31:06] within a man
[1:31:07] and you're just judging and living out
[1:31:09] and doing all these things according to
[1:31:11] what you think is best
[1:31:13] or is there another mind is there
[1:31:16] another life
[1:31:18] is there another power is there another
[1:31:20] spirit is there another appeal say oh
[1:31:23] god i don't want my thinking
[1:31:25] i don't want what matthew mcgeary thinks
[1:31:28] best
[1:31:29] matthew mcgeary don't know what's best
[1:31:31] and i've proved it a lot of times
[1:31:33] but oh i don't want my mind i want you
[1:31:36] are my lord i want to rub out all this
[1:31:39] this make believe rub out all this
[1:31:41] unbelief i want to get into something
[1:31:43] real
[1:31:45] so these corinthians they were immature
[1:31:48] but here these ephesians you could teach
[1:31:50] them something maybe we'll just we'll
[1:31:52] end along these lines because there's a
[1:31:54] little bit of reading but i i'll move
[1:31:56] quickly if they can put that on the
[1:31:57] board uh out of adoption number one
[1:32:02] paul writing to those ephesians about
[1:32:05] seated in heavenly places uh uh
[1:32:07] spiritual blessings the prophet of god
[1:32:08] would say the heavenly places now not
[1:32:10] just out anywhere but in heavenly places
[1:32:15] we are assembled in heavenly it means
[1:32:18] that the position of the believer so
[1:32:20] what is heavenly places
[1:32:22] that's your position
[1:32:24] as if not some like way off thing in the
[1:32:26] yonder that one day no that's right now
[1:32:29] we're living in the hour of the
[1:32:30] manifestation of the sons of god we're
[1:32:32] living in adoption time we're living in
[1:32:34] the hour of the placing of sons of god
[1:32:39] the position i believe that if i'm
[1:32:40] prayed up now we're going to move
[1:32:41] quickly because this you could just
[1:32:43] unpack this and and and preach a whole
[1:32:46] series on it but we'll move quickly
[1:32:47] towards a close
[1:32:49] maybe revisit it later that if i'm
[1:32:50] prayed up you're prayed up or the church
[1:32:53] has prayed up and we're ready for the
[1:32:54] message
[1:32:55] and we've assembled ourselves together
[1:32:57] as saints called out baptized with the
[1:33:00] holy ghost filled with god's blessings
[1:33:03] called elected set together in heavenly
[1:33:05] places now we're in the heavenlies in
[1:33:07] our soul our spirits has brought us into
[1:33:09] a heavenly atmosphere oh brother there
[1:33:11] you are a heavenly atmosphere oh what
[1:33:14] could happen tonight
[1:33:16] what could happen tonight if we would be
[1:33:17] sitting here in a heavenly atmosphere
[1:33:20] and the holy spirit moving over every
[1:33:22] heart that's been regenerated and become
[1:33:24] a new creature in christ jesus all sins

[1:33:28] in perfect worship with our hands up to
[1:33:31] god in our hearts lifted setting in
[1:33:33] heavenly places in christ jesus

[1:33:45] have you ever said in one and you knew
[1:33:46] it
[1:33:48] have you ever said in one and you
[1:33:49] experienced it
[1:33:51] it's here for you
[1:33:53] i i don't want to move past that just so
[1:33:54] quickly the prophet's not just
[1:33:56] asking that
[1:33:58] have you ever sat in one
[1:33:59] he's asking the question because he
[1:34:00] knows what he's talking about
[1:34:02] if you ever sat in one
[1:34:04] it'll change you forever
[1:34:07] do you ever said it one oh i've sat
[1:34:08] until i would weep for joy and say god
[1:34:10] never let me leave here oh it's a
[1:34:12] blessed thing just just heavenly places
[1:34:15] in christ jesus blessing us with what
[1:34:17] now

[1:34:32] heavenly blessings and joy unspeakable
[1:34:35] and full full of glory every heart
[1:34:37] filled with the spirit walking together
[1:34:40] setting together in heaven places not

[1:34:50] another everybody's speaking in love and
[1:34:54] harmony everybody with one accord in one

[1:39:19] we're just in along along this line
[1:39:20] about make believe you know make believe
[1:39:22] is pretending
[1:39:26] i don't want to pretend
[1:39:28] i don't want to make belief
[1:39:31] without the life and without faith it's
[1:39:33] just ritual
[1:39:35] and tradition
[1:39:38] without faith it's impossible
[1:39:41] to please god
[1:39:43] and that's maybe by god's grace where i
[1:39:44] want to pick up next time is how
[1:39:46] you you could look at a abel and you
[1:39:48] could look at cain cain worshiped cain
[1:39:51] offered sacrifice but abel had
[1:39:53] revelation and then paul would start to
[1:39:55] write to those corinthians and say look
[1:39:58] look at those israelites
[1:40:00] they're an example
[1:40:02] they all came out of egypt
[1:40:04] they all were under the pillar of fire
[1:40:07] they all went through the red sea
[1:40:10] they all had a pillar of fire by day and
[1:40:12] by night
[1:40:14] and every single one of them died let
[1:40:16] them be an example
[1:40:18] to us
[1:40:23] i say oh god
[1:40:25] i want to come into that maturity
[1:40:28] i want to come into that power of
[1:40:30] overcoming life
[1:40:33] where i can receive the deep things of
[1:40:34] god
[1:40:37] is that what you want
[1:40:40] i don't know that song just come to me
[1:40:41] won't it be wonderful there having no
[1:40:43] burdens to bear
[1:40:45] how does that go
