[25:46] [Music]
[25:47] and I want to be and
[25:53] I When the Saints Go my
[25:59] Hallelujah Blessed Be His holy name what
[26:03] an assurance to be a Christian amen you
[26:06] can't wait for this to be over amen Amen
[26:11] brother Beno has a testimony amen if you
[26:14] could come at this
[26:24] time God bless you Saints
[26:28] oh I love that
[26:29] song see we sing it I want to be in that
[26:33] number
[26:34] but brother Brandon would say as a
[26:36] Believer you got to know that you know
[26:38] that you're going to be in that number
[26:40] so I sing I'm going to be in that number
[26:43] there's no wants if you don't see me you
[26:45] in the wrong
[26:48] place
[26:50] so when the Lord shows himself to you
[26:53] you got to testify of his
[26:56] goodness so today I guess yesterday
[27:00] really when I left got out of my car
[27:02] after class um I had left it I guess I
[27:05] left one of the doors open so it drained
[27:08] the battery in my car so then today
[27:12] coming to church when I tried to start
[27:13] the car it didn't start so I was like
[27:16] well Lord I want to go to
[27:19] church something got to give so happily
[27:24] the car started and I made it to church
[27:27] so I'm happy to be here but it wasn't
[27:29] easy to be
[27:31] here as I was
[27:33] driving
[27:36] um I don't know how fast that car would
[27:39] had to have been
[27:41] going but I didn't see
[27:48] him I I know I would have I would have
[27:52] already took my heavenly flight if that
[27:54] car would have hit
[27:55] me the way that car was moving
[27:59] and where I was he would have hit
[28:01] directly the driver's side and at the
[28:05] speed at which he was going it was I
[28:08] knew it was going to be certain death
[28:12] most likely on
[28:13] contact and uh I wish I was
[28:20] exaggerating but when you see the hand
[28:22] of the Lord move your vehicle out the
[28:24] way and your car doesn't get a scratch
[28:27] doesn't get a touch doesn't get anything
[28:30] you have to believe that we serve a
[28:32] living God and I don't believe in
[28:34] ironies but I believe in God appointed
[28:38] moments so as I was driving the song I
[28:41] was listening to has been blessing me
[28:43] for a while and in that song it
[28:46] says he won't
[28:49] fail he won't fail he'll never leave you
[28:53] he won't
[28:54] fail that bridge says I see it with my
[28:59] own eyes I've seen it in my own life
[29:03] he'll never forsake me he won't fail and
[29:07] if for me to not testify of what I saw
[29:10] with my own eyes today I'd be doing a
[29:12] disservice to somebody so I just share
[29:15] this testimony with encouragement to let
[29:17] you know the Lord's promises don't fail
[29:20] the scripture that says he protects the
[29:22] going and the coming back of his
[29:24] children I've seen it with my own eyes
[29:27] I've seen it in my own life and I can
[29:30] tell you he don't fail God bless you
[29:38] Saints amen aren't you glad for his
[29:42] keeping power amen we're certainly
[29:45] thankful
[29:48] amen amen our meetings are here so
[29:52] um brother Danny is in the building so
[29:54] we're certainly thankful and and I want
[29:56] to say
[29:59] um if you we we had uh I guess we
[30:03] realized that there were a couple PE
[30:05] couple of people that actually didn't
[30:06] sign up I guess they were waiting until

[30:12] down so if you have not registered yet

[31:12] uh be in prayer for the magary family I
[31:15] know even if it was expected it still
[31:17] hurts amen we certainly want to just

[31:22] will comfort each and I'm pretty sure

[31:25] on right now and we just pray that the
[31:28] whole process will go smoothly that God
[31:30] will uh certainly undertake for it

[32:25] before the Lord the brothers that are
[32:27] taking the offering if you can

[32:46] heads oh Lord what a

[33:01] yes you said when you were here in the
[33:03] flesh take you

[33:28] crust built up on their heads Lord we go
[33:31] to the Rock and knock that crust
[33:33] off or Lord you can provide IAD
[33:40] that would clear the vision of those
[33:43] here tonight Lord that we
[33:45] might find our
[33:48] way the straight and narrow path Lord
[33:51] that you want us
[33:53] on Lord there's needs that have been
[33:56] witnessed and read and shown by the

[34:02] way through these things as brother
[34:04] being testified Lord he couldn't even
[34:06] steer the car out of the
[34:08] way but Lord you saw fit to move
[34:11] it so Lord any of these things that
[34:14] would
[34:14] hinder Lord even physical
[34:18] needs can hinder
[34:20] Faith Lord we pray that you just come in
[34:22] a Great and Mighty way just absolve all
[34:25] the doubt the fear the ailment whatever
[34:28] it is
[34:29] Lord as our Prophet said
[34:32] just Lift us up in that higher
[34:36] realm that sick sense of Faith
[34:40] Lord we can look beyond the things that
[34:42] are seen look to the
[34:44] Unseen for Lord we have a provision we
[34:47] have a way already made just direct us
[34:50] to it we pray Lord Lord maybe in this
[34:53] service

[34:57] finally break through and get what they
[34:59] have need of that's what we desire Lord

[46:06] that uh I I just want to uh as you know
[46:11] my uh mother passed away this morning at
[46:14] about
[46:15] 7:30 uh San Diego time about 9:30 our
[46:20] time and uh you know everything I asked
[46:24] the Lord he granted me you know I I
[46:29] never wanted my mother to be in a
[46:31] nursing home and and uh she never had to
[46:35] be in the nursing home and never wanted
[46:37] her in the hospital and she never had to
[46:40] go to the hospital and I I never wanted
[46:44] her to be
[46:45] alone uh when she died I I didn't want
[46:48] her to be alone and and uh God granted
[46:52] the mercy uh my mom had a good night's
[46:55] sleep and
[46:57] Sharon went in to be with her in the
[46:59] morning and uh my mom was there and
[47:04] Sharon began to sing and uh play some
[47:08] oldtime gospel singing and when she put
[47:12] on Amazing Grace and was listening and
[47:15] singing Amazing
[47:17] Grace uh my mom
[47:20] uh passed away to go to be the place
[47:23] that God had prepared for her
[47:27] and and I'm thankful for that uh I I I I
[47:31] just don't know how to thank the Lord
[47:33] enough uh uh you know just a year ago uh
[47:38] this last July I had flown my mom to
[47:42] Michigan and she celebrated her 101st
[47:45] birthday in Michigan with all her
[47:49] family uh we went out to a restaurant
[47:51] together and and she said you see that
[47:54] Ballroom she said that's where we had
[47:56] our senior your
[47:57] prom and uh and she got to be with her
[48:02] sister and all her nephews and nieces
[48:04] where she grew up and and uh I I'm just
[48:10] you know I just don't know how to say
[48:12] enough you know I had 102 years with my
[48:15] mother well I didn't have 102 years I I
[48:18] only had 75 of the 102 years but she was
[48:22] here for 102 years and and I'm trusting
[48:25] that I'll spend eternity with her you
[48:29] know my mom was a Catholic and and you
[48:32] know towards the end I I could tell that
[48:36] my mom just didn't have the
[48:38] confidence in what she believed to take
[48:43] her over and I she told she looked up at
[48:46] Sharon and she said Sharon I renounce
[48:49] all my
[48:50] traditions and uh you know little things
[48:53] like that are just the things that God
[48:55] does for you
[48:57] and uh so uh but I I want to just take
[49:00] this time to thank all of you for your
[49:02] prayers and uh your well wishes and all
[49:06] the texts and uh uh calls that we've
[49:11] gotten uh we certainly appreciate that
[49:14] and I know there's many of you whose
[49:17] parents have gone on to be with the Lord
[49:19] and and uh and we'll all come to that
[49:23] place if we T but aren't you glad we
[49:27] have a God that's so good to us and and
[49:30] I I'm thankful for the hope that I have
[49:34] in a Rapture in a translation whether I
[49:39] go by way of the Grave it doesn't matter
[49:42] uh doesn't mean one thing uh I just know
[49:45] one one thing that uh when this body be
[49:50] dissolved I have one waiting for me and
[49:53] this old coat will go back to where it
[49:55] comes from but I'm not going to the
[49:58] Grave you know you can put this old bag
[50:01] of bones and this old aching back ache
[50:05] knee ache you know face ache you can
[50:09] stick that in the ground and if you want
[50:11] to sit around and ball baby that's your
[50:13] problem but I'm going to be shouting and
[50:16] dancing on the other side and I'm not
[50:19] going to be feeling sorry for you one
[50:21] bit to be honest with you I'm not even
[50:24] going to look back I don't don't believe
[50:27] in communion of the
[50:28] Saints you know what I mean so uh uh
[50:32] don't don't get sad when I'm gone you
[50:35] know what I mean in fact I want you to
[50:37] sing when I died that that's the nicest
[50:40] thing that ever ever's done for you and
[50:43] uh that would just be happy with me and
[50:46] so I don't know when my time is but it's
[50:50] appointed and I've always lived by what
[50:52] the prophet of God said he said if God
[50:55] wants you here
[50:57] there's not enough sickness there's not
[51:00] enough Devils to take
[51:03] you and says if he wants to take you
[51:06] there's not enough doctors enough
[51:09] hospitals or enough medicine to keep you
[51:12] here and that's where we rest you know
[51:15] we can rest in that brother Johan we
[51:16] don't we don't have to worry he's got it
[51:20] he's got my children he's got you I I I
[51:23] thought thinking on my mom I thought
[51:26] well you know my mom brought two message
[51:28] preachers into the world one's a
[51:31] missionary and and uh you know and uh
[51:35] she's got three
[51:37] grandchild that preach the gospel and
[51:40] many Believers and uh so you know I just
[51:45] hope that God in his great Mercy takes
[51:47] it all into consideration he promised us
[51:51] that all that we love and all that loved
[51:53] us will be there we know there's a place
[51:56] in heaven that is for the bride it's a
[52:01] city where the lamb is the light and
[52:05] it's a great pyramid City and it's
[52:08] gorgeous and we know outside of that
[52:11] City there's Believers and people that
[52:14] receive reward and and they'll labor and
[52:17] life will carry on and they'll have
[52:19] peace and they'll come into that City
[52:22] and they'll pick the leaves of peace and
[52:24] enter in so whatever place I
[52:28] am be honest with you I'll be happy I
[52:31] made it because I had a whole lot piled
[52:35] up against me that would keep me not to
[52:37] make it but one day a man went to
[52:40] Calvary a kinsman redeemer and he laid a
[52:44] sacrifice down that could paid for all
[52:46] my sins and he knew everyone that I'd
[52:49] ever commit and they all laid with him
[52:51] on Calvary and they were nail nailed to
[52:54] that tree so I I'm not grieved in my
[52:57] spirit as some would I I I don't sorrow
[53:02] as those that have no hope uh I've never
[53:05] been much for all this traditional ball
[53:08] babying and screaming and laying on the
[53:11] floor uh you know that's passed down
[53:14] from tradition I I just think it's time
[53:17] that we start breaking the traditions of
[53:19] man because we're not a religion we're a
[53:23] people we're a we're a tribe
[53:27] we're an elected predestinated people
[53:31] that was called for a purpose and we
[53:36] have his name and we have a new name and
[53:40] that's what makes us live and so as you
[53:45] know we have this flesh and this flesh
[53:47] Wars against the spirit and the spirit
[53:49] against the Flesh and they're contrary
[53:52] but God put something in us that can
[53:54] never be taken from us and that was was
[53:56] his seed and he secured it by putting
[54:00] name on the lamb Book of Life and
[54:02] sealing it with his blood and you can't
[54:07] ask for any more than that amen so we're
[54:10] looking forward to our meetings uh uh
[54:12] brother Danny's with us to uh uh speak
[54:16] the next few nights uh youth banquet
[54:19] tomorrow and that's just for the Youth
[54:21] but Saturday night uh I service at 6:00
[54:26] everybody's invited so uh everybody in
[54:29] the church is invited to that and I
[54:32] believe we'll have a little snack
[54:34] afterwards and that snacks for everybody
[54:37] and uh we're counting on brother Adrien
[54:39] making enough goodies that you'll all be
[54:41] filled up and then Sunday uh morning is
[54:45] it at 10: Sunday
[54:47] morning what 11 Sunday morning we'll
[54:50] have a service at 11: and then if
[54:53] anybody wants to come back in the
[54:55] evening and sing specials we can do that
[54:58] I know a lot of the young people like to
[55:00] sing and and so we'll just have a nice
[55:03] time this weekend and we want the social
[55:06] part of it but we really want this
[55:09] meeting to be a quality meeting for our
[55:11] souls and for our spirit and for our
[55:15] Direction in life and and the path that
[55:19] God wants us to walk and the way that he
[55:23] wants us to walk it and uh
[55:27] uh and we just pray that through the
[55:30] word of God and through uh times of
[55:34] fellowship and preaching the word that
[55:36] we'll be fortunate enough to find more
[55:39] of the perfect will than the permissive
[55:42] will and uh you know when I came into
[55:45] the message just at a young
[55:47] man I think I was 20 years old or so uh
[55:53] there was no young people I was the
[55:56] young
[55:58] people and uh uh and that's just how it
[56:02] was but now we've come such a long way
[56:04] to be able to serve our teenagers and
[56:07] our youngsters have Sunday school youth
[56:09] things so I think it's wonderful tonight
[56:13] we have brother Jeremy uh with us uh
[56:16] he's the uh only preacher that I love
[56:19] and hate at the same
[56:22] time and you know it just I just can't
[56:25] believe that he can sing and preach both
[56:28] and it wouldn't be so bad if if he just
[56:31] could you know sing better than me but
[56:33] he can preach and sing better than me so
[56:36] that just you know it it don't eat me up
[56:39] but so I've learned one thing I'm not
[56:41] going to be jealous I'm just going to
[56:42] sit back and enjoy it amen so I've asked
[56:47] uh uh brother uh Jeremy to come and and
[56:52] sing and preach for us tonight so I
[56:54] think he'll probably start off with sing
[56:56] singing and and that's good so do you
[56:58] love the Lord we're just going to let
[57:00] you remain seated he can have you stand
[57:02] when he reads the word for J Mary we
[57:04] appreciate you the work that you're
[57:06] doing and everything God bless you we
[57:09] really do love you
[57:11] brother and I just think your beard
[57:13] looks wonderful okay almost looks like
[57:16] mine not quite as gray that's the truth
[57:20] all right God bless you we're glad to
[57:21] hear here hallelujah well where do you
[57:24] go from there
[57:26] all right well I'll tell you what

[57:31] going to sing this together if you don't
[57:32] mind key of C let's stand together I do
[57:36] want to get the humanity part of it out
[57:38] of it for myself and let you know that I
[57:39] am conscious of your time and some of

[57:43] to hold you as long as uh I want to hold
[57:46] you I want to hold you as long as God
[57:47] wants amen so we the Lord's laid
[57:50] something on our heart but uh since he's
[57:52] asked us to sing he was talking about

[57:57] song is all my life you've been faithful

[1:01:53] only thing we can say is it's him and us
[1:01:56] and and that's the beauty of it it's not
[1:01:57] something that you can explain and it

[1:03:02] yesterday and uh I'm just going to say
[1:03:05] it's going to be an interesting title uh
[1:03:07] compared to what uh uh we were at lunch
[1:03:10] today and brother Matthew told me a
[1:03:12] sermon he preached recently and I just
[1:03:14] said Lord what are you
[1:03:16] doing and uh my my associate pastor at
[1:03:19] home brother Jr just said well the Lord
[1:03:20] has a sense of humor and I said I'm not
[1:03:22] laughing so we'll we'll get to this in a
[1:03:24] minute Luke chapter
[1:03:26] 1:30 and the angel said unto her fear
[1:03:29] not Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[1:03:33] God and behold Thou shalt conceive in
[1:03:35] thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[1:03:38] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[1:03:41] and shall be called the son of the
[1:03:42] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[1:03:46] him the Throne of his father David and
[1:03:48] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:03:50] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[1:03:52] be no end aren't you thankful for that
[1:03:55] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[1:03:57] this be seeing I know not a man the
[1:04:01] angel answered and said unto her the
[1:04:02] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[1:04:05] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:04:07] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[1:04:09] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:04:10] called The Son of God and behold thy
[1:04:13] cousin Elizabeth shall also uh shuh she
[1:04:17] hath also conceived a son in her old age
[1:04:20] and this is the sixth month with her who
[1:04:22] is called baren very familiar verse
[1:04:25] verse here for with God nothing shall be
[1:04:29] impossible this is also important and
[1:04:32] Mary said behold the handmade of the
[1:04:34] Lord be it unto me what according to Thy
[1:04:39] word and the angel departed from her God
[1:04:43] bless you you can be seated this
[1:04:48] evening now we believe in this message
[1:04:52] and are blessed with actually the
[1:04:55] message itself self is
[1:04:57] Supernatural it is a supernatural
[1:04:59] message it is a powerful message the
[1:05:02] fact that you're here is a
[1:05:04] miracle the fact that not not so much
[1:05:07] that you drove here but the fact that
[1:05:08] you have been able to your your heart
[1:05:11] your eyes have been open to this message
[1:05:14] listen young people I know you might be
[1:05:16] tired right now but I want to encourage
[1:05:18] you with something you're still young
[1:05:20] you're good that's that's an
[1:05:22] encouragement but the fact that that you
[1:05:24] have in this evil age the
[1:05:27] opportunity to take this message and to
[1:05:29] be a part of this message is a miracle
[1:05:31] within
[1:05:31] itself and I I want to encourage you
[1:05:34] with this thought and it doesn't sound
[1:05:36] encouraging but our thought tonight is
[1:05:37] it doesn't take a
[1:05:39] miracle and we'll get there so just give
[1:05:42] us a few moments it doesn't take a
[1:05:45] miracle now brother Matthew said he just
[1:05:47] preached a sermon called look for the
[1:05:49] miracle toward the miracle watch for the
[1:05:52] watch the miracle watch the miracle so I
[1:05:54] am not eliminating the miracle but we
[1:05:57] want to as he as he spoke what it was
[1:05:59] about I found out that we were running
[1:06:01] in the same page now let's Mary said
[1:06:03] behold the
[1:06:05] handmade this is an expression of
[1:06:08] resignation to the will of God now it's
[1:06:11] hard for human beings to actually resign
[1:06:14] ourselves to God's will because a lot of
[1:06:17] times God's will is not our will all
[1:06:20] right but this is an expression of
[1:06:22] resignation to the will of God and of
[1:06:24] faith in the promise so this is a faith
[1:06:27] in something that was spoken to her not
[1:06:29] there was not anything that was yet seen
[1:06:31] or felt we'll get to this in a minute
[1:06:33] but to be the handmade of the Lord means
[1:06:36] to be submissive and obedient and is the
[1:06:39] same as saying I fully credit all that
[1:06:42] is said and I'm perfectly ready to obey
[1:06:46] all the commands of the Lord so when she
[1:06:49] makes this she is saying nothing else
[1:06:51] matters I am putting everything upon you
[1:06:54] all right now brother ROM and believest
[1:06:56] thou this he says and notice just as
[1:06:58] soon now she didn't wait till she was
[1:07:01] positive she was going to have this
[1:07:02] child she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:07:05] before she said anything about it she
[1:07:08] started right away testifying and
[1:07:11] telling people that she was going to
[1:07:13] have this baby when there was no signs
[1:07:17] of it yet I want that to sink in there
[1:07:20] was no signs of it God give us some more
[1:07:24] Marys
[1:07:26] he said give us more mares now don't
[1:07:28] wait for signs and
[1:07:30] wonders take God at his word and start
[1:07:34] rejoicing you see the the praise should
[1:07:37] not be waiting until something happens
[1:07:39] the praise should come before anything
[1:07:41] happens because it's not about what we
[1:07:43] see when did we get to a point in our
[1:07:45] relationship that is only by what we see
[1:07:48] I how the only way I know if God's
[1:07:49] moving is if I see something happen but
[1:07:52] the word of God told her that this is
[1:07:54] going to happen she said behold the
[1:07:56] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[1:07:59] according to Thy word all right so
[1:08:02] notice what he says he says uh uh don't
[1:08:04] wait for signs and wonders take God at
[1:08:06] his word now we're not eliminating signs
[1:08:08] and wonders don't wait on them trust the
[1:08:11] word of the Lord start rejoicing and
[1:08:12] saying it's going to happen God said so
[1:08:16] now he says I believe if every patient
[1:08:17] in this building right now would accept
[1:08:19] it notice I love this upon the grounds
[1:08:22] of God's
[1:08:23] word that's what we're hearing tonight
[1:08:25] for to accept it upon the grounds of
[1:08:27] God's word not by the symptoms not by
[1:08:31] the the conditions around us not by
[1:08:33] what's happening in the area and and
[1:08:35] everything's falling apart we understand
[1:08:36] everything's falling apart what are we
[1:08:38] it doesn't matter what's going to happen
[1:08:40] in the election it doesn't matter what
[1:08:42] are we looking for some great hero no
[1:08:44] we're standing upon the word of God
[1:08:46] accept it upon the the grounds of God's
[1:08:49] word and believe it and start testifying
[1:08:51] and praise God for your healing now I
[1:08:54] don't want to just look at the this is
[1:08:55] healing uh so much in uh as physical
[1:08:58] healing but we deal with a lot of
[1:09:00] spiritual sickness a lot of mental
[1:09:03] sickness in the church in the body of
[1:09:05] Christ there's a lot of this that
[1:09:07] happens and because of the greatest
[1:09:09] battle ever fought which is in the mind
[1:09:10] and I'm talking about ministers fight it
[1:09:12] hello you're not just alone in this
[1:09:14] ministers fight it pastors fight it
[1:09:17] deacons fight it trustees fight it you
[1:09:19] fight it sitting in the Pew the greatest
[1:09:21] battle ever foughts in the mind and it
[1:09:23] wears you down and you get tired
[1:09:26] that's right you struggle you fight and
[1:09:29] and before you know it because of this
[1:09:31] you start looking for something to see
[1:09:33] you're looking for some big sign or
[1:09:35] something to take place because Satan's
[1:09:38] wanting you to look towards
[1:09:40] that it shouldn't take a miracle to get
[1:09:42] you to believe the word of God because
[1:09:45] the word has already been spoken the
[1:09:47] miracle has already come to
[1:09:49] pass oh let this sink in God is under
[1:09:52] obligation to answer his word I didn't
[1:09:56] finish this the meeting wouldn't close
[1:09:57] with one crippled person in here I
[1:09:59] believe that these meetings that we're
[1:10:01] going to have these upcoming meetings
[1:10:03] though there towards the youth that any
[1:10:05] person that steps into this building
[1:10:07] that they can leave completely healed
[1:10:10] listen I'm not going to limit it to
[1:10:11] anything I believe in the same power of
[1:10:13] God that was back in I believe he's
[1:10:15] greater today than he was 20 years ago
[1:10:17] you now he's the same God but I believe
[1:10:19] as a a believer of his word God help me
[1:10:22] to see help me to understand that you're
[1:10:25] here
[1:10:27] yes God is under obligation to answer
[1:10:30] his
[1:10:31] word now we understand that Miracles are
[1:10:34] a part of the Blessed word we understand
[1:10:36] that Miracles are a part of our our
[1:10:38] daily life but it is the word that is
[1:10:43] sustaining right now I I you say well
[1:10:46] brother Jeremy where are you at with
[1:10:47] Miracles I can tell you about all kinds
[1:10:49] of Miracles that have happened in my
[1:10:50] life I can tell you about uh you know
[1:10:53] about my daughter there's a miracle with
[1:10:55] my daughter how she was born and how God
[1:10:58] uh uh sealed the womb of my wife so that
[1:11:00] she could be born I believe that he's a
[1:11:01] uh he's a miracle workking God I uh just
[1:11:05] just at our meetings brother Matthew was
[1:11:07] there brother Bryce Collins was speaking
[1:11:09] we've had our house on the market for uh
[1:11:11] I mean for us it seemed like a long time
[1:11:13] it was uh least of seven eight months is
[1:11:16] what it was and nothing was happening
[1:11:18] Brother Bryce as the very end of the
[1:11:20] service began to testify about how uh uh
[1:11:23] and and I'm sitting in the back you know
[1:11:25] Pastor I'm I'm just burden it's towards
[1:11:27] the end of the service I'm praying for
[1:11:28] the people and I was listening to his
[1:11:30] testimony but I wasn't listening to it
[1:11:32] for me and so he began to tell about how
[1:11:35] he had had some land that that uh uh
[1:11:37] wasn't selling and and then uh uh uh
[1:11:40] just I can't remember the full part of
[1:11:42] it but all I know is that God
[1:11:44] miraculously came in and he just he just
[1:11:46] took God out of his word and he
[1:11:48] miraculously came in and sold those
[1:11:50] properties for brother Bryce well then
[1:11:52] he felt led to tell the testimony at
[1:11:54] another church and Arkansas and he was
[1:11:56] telling that testimony and his sister
[1:11:58] was sitting there and and she said as he
[1:12:00] was testifying they had two properties
[1:12:02] that were not even being looked at not
[1:12:04] even close to being looked at and she
[1:12:06] sat there and she said if if God could
[1:12:09] do that for brother Bryce he can do it
[1:12:11] for me and within two weeks I believe it
[1:12:14] was both houses were uh uh were under
[1:12:17] contract and sold and so he was
[1:12:20] testifying about this and I'm sitting
[1:12:21] there in the back and and all of a
[1:12:24] sudden just not an audible voice but
[1:12:26] something spoke to my heart and said and
[1:12:27] I can do it for you too well I I heard
[1:12:30] it but I didn't catch it and I sat there
[1:12:34] and I said what was that what was that
[1:12:37] and he says I can do it for you too and
[1:12:39] it just brought me under this thought I
[1:12:41] said okay Lord I don't know what that
[1:12:42] means I is it is it for my house is it
[1:12:45] for something else and I went up to the
[1:12:46] to the platform I don't know if brother
[1:12:48] Matthew remembered it or not but I I
[1:12:49] mentioned that testimony within two
[1:12:51] weeks we have it under had it under
[1:12:53] contract two weeks we had under a
[1:12:55] contract he said I can do it for you too
[1:12:58] right now my wife and sister Michelle
[1:13:00] are at home they drove home today to
[1:13:01] start packing because we have to have be
[1:13:03] packed and moved out by the ninth when
[1:13:05] God does something he does
[1:13:07] it so I'm not saying I don't believe
[1:13:10] that God can do these things but I don't
[1:13:12] need these things as Believers we should
[1:13:15] not need these things to keep us focused
[1:13:19] upon the word of God you see the signs
[1:13:22] and wonders of Miracle is an
[1:13:23] extraordinary event man manifesting
[1:13:25] divine intervention in human Affairs we
[1:13:28] know this and the signs are a part of
[1:13:30] the word of God they are written in
[1:13:32] there for us it says these signs shall
[1:13:35] follow them
[1:13:36] that are you're still with me these
[1:13:38] signs shall follow them that are you a
[1:13:40] Believer so then they will follow you
[1:13:44] the question it is the question that is
[1:13:47] here tonight is why do we see so many
[1:13:49] looking for these instead of Simply
[1:13:52] trusting him
[1:13:55] brother Brandon makes a statement in the
[1:13:56] great coming revival
[1:13:58] 1954 uh paragraph 11 he says now for
[1:14:01] just a few moments for your attention
[1:14:04] upon the great Revival that I believe
[1:14:05] that we're facing now he said the first
[1:14:08] thing God always brings warnings to the
[1:14:10] people before he sends a blessing or a
[1:14:12] judgment it's always been in the
[1:14:14] scriptures that God gives warnings or
[1:14:17] signs now we're taught in the Bible not
[1:14:20] to seek after
[1:14:22] signs because it would be a bad sign for
[1:14:25] us as a weak and adulterous generation
[1:14:28] to seek after signs but there's quite a
[1:14:31] difference in seeking after signs and
[1:14:34] then recognizing
[1:14:36] signs see a person that just seeks for a
[1:14:39] sign alone in other words Lord if you'll
[1:14:41] make it rain right now I believe that
[1:14:44] I'm saved see I don't have to ask that
[1:14:48] I'm saved according to God's word when I
[1:14:52] meet the
[1:14:54] conditions so I that that struck me as I
[1:14:57] was looking into this the the the aspect
[1:14:59] of seeking and recognizing the the word
[1:15:02] seek is to attempt or desire to obtain
[1:15:06] or achieve achieve something so you're
[1:15:08] always looking you're always seeking and
[1:15:11] and I and I'm for constantly seeking the
[1:15:13] word of God you follow what I'm saying I
[1:15:15] believe that we should be studiers of
[1:15:17] the word of God studiers of this message
[1:15:19] I believe that we should listen to the
[1:15:20] message daily all of these things but
[1:15:23] when we see uh when we look at the
[1:15:24] aspect of seeking for signs it's like
[1:15:26] we're always trying to obtain something
[1:15:29] and it's never enough it's not
[1:15:31] sustaining but if you look at the word
[1:15:33] recognizing it says whereas recognizing
[1:15:36] means to identify from knowledge of
[1:15:39] appearance or character so when the
[1:15:42] prophet of God says there's a difference
[1:15:44] in seeking and recognizing I want you to
[1:15:46] understand as Believers we're not
[1:15:48] seeking for these things but we
[1:15:50] recognize when the presence of God is
[1:15:53] moving why because of its
[1:15:56] character that's right you see that we
[1:15:59] we can't just look for the signs because
[1:16:01] we've been told in this day that there's
[1:16:03] going to be signs and wonders that are
[1:16:05] going to happen and it's going to look
[1:16:07] like the lord it's going to look like
[1:16:09] these things but we've got to recognize
[1:16:12] the character of the sign we've got to
[1:16:14] recognize the character of the word of
[1:16:17] God you see I don't I don't want to just
[1:16:19] say well I'm not going to do anything
[1:16:20] unless God sells my house listen that's
[1:16:22] not how I went down to that point I
[1:16:24] didn't care but we were my wife and I
[1:16:26] was like if it if it's not the will of
[1:16:27] the Lord then uh uh uh we're not going
[1:16:30] to sell it in fact this week uh uh we we
[1:16:33] have no we don't know where we're going
[1:16:34] to move yet and uh uh we we were going
[1:16:36] to look at a house when we got back and
[1:16:38] as soon as every house it's funny how
[1:16:40] this works but every house we' thought
[1:16:41] we're going to look at we're going to
[1:16:42] look at as soon as we try to go look at
[1:16:44] it it goes under
[1:16:47] contract I'm like okay and our realtor
[1:16:50] uh sent us a message and she said uh uh
[1:16:53] I can't remember but but basically Lord
[1:16:55] Jesus help us uh uh uh to find the right
[1:16:58] one you know open the door and I just
[1:17:00] sent her I said every time that door
[1:17:02] closes is the will of God it's not a
[1:17:06] negative thing it's a positive thing I
[1:17:08] want him to close the doors brother that
[1:17:11] I don't need to go through listen I've
[1:17:13] I've come too far to try to make
[1:17:16] something work I've come too far to try
[1:17:18] to force this into we we we don't have
[1:17:21] time for this anymore this is we're not
[1:17:23] here to try this out tonight we're not
[1:17:25] coming to these meetings to try and see
[1:17:27] if God can do something for us there is
[1:17:29] a word that will be spoken for you in
[1:17:32] these meetings and we need to come with
[1:17:34] preparation focused on the word of God
[1:17:37] I'm not here looking for a sign I listen
[1:17:40] Miracles can take place but it's not
[1:17:42] about that Miracle it's about the word
[1:17:44] of God that will get directly to my
[1:17:47] heart so it's recognizing the sign not
[1:17:51] seeking after these things it's it's
[1:17:53] being open to know that that because I'm
[1:17:55] a Believer these will follow me things
[1:17:58] will happen that are
[1:17:59] unexplainable you just heard a testimony
[1:18:02] tonight of something that is
[1:18:04] unexplainable these signs shall follow
[1:18:06] them that
[1:18:10] believe I want to go on the opposite
[1:18:12] side of it
[1:18:13] too what if something else would have
[1:18:15] happened he's still a
[1:18:18] Believer
[1:18:20] right you see I don't want to I don't
[1:18:23] want to belittle someone's faith
[1:18:25] because if I did that well then I would
[1:18:27] go back to the Dark Ages brother and I
[1:18:29] would say well they didn't have enough
[1:18:30] Faith to keep the to for those those
[1:18:32] mothers to keep the babies out of the
[1:18:34] the lion's mouth no they had enough
[1:18:36] Faith to keep standing to the very end
[1:18:39] and that's what we're looking at tonight
[1:18:41] is people that are going to stand to the
[1:18:43] very end it doesn't matter what Satan
[1:18:46] throws at them God already knows every
[1:18:49] situation so I want to be able to be so
[1:18:51] attentive to the word of God that I can
[1:18:54] Rec recogniz when it's his
[1:18:57] character oh let us let our hearts be
[1:19:00] open to recognize his character so we
[1:19:03] have been taught to recognize his
[1:19:05] presence by the character of what has
[1:19:08] occurred it's not pointing to a man I'm
[1:19:11] not looking to we can't be looking for a
[1:19:12] Ministry we're looking for the word of
[1:19:14] God because listen if we're just looking
[1:19:17] for something that is a miracle then uh
[1:19:20] then I would say there would be a lot of
[1:19:23] donkeys let's let's all follow the
[1:19:25] donkey's Ministry brother Danny because
[1:19:27] I mean that was a miracle for a donkey
[1:19:29] to
[1:19:29] talk have many's ever seen a donkey
[1:19:32] talk just giving you'all a
[1:19:35] second no hands went up well that was a
[1:19:38] pretty big deal but you see it didn't
[1:19:41] matter what what happened there I want
[1:19:43] you to understand what are we looking
[1:19:45] for all right now in this revealing in
[1:19:48] the revealing of the word of God comes
[1:19:51] Miracles and signs but without character
[1:19:53] this will bring error
[1:19:55] now I like it what brother brandom says
[1:19:56] in identification he said would you be
[1:19:58] with the popular folks who had the
[1:20:00] popular
[1:20:02] opinion as long as I belong to a church
[1:20:04] and and maybe because I danced in the
[1:20:06] spirit I'm all right maybe because I've
[1:20:08] spoken with tongues I'm all right or or
[1:20:10] maybe well we got a good pastor and I'm
[1:20:12] all right now those things are loyal I
[1:20:15] have nothing to say against that that's
[1:20:17] true but this Plan of Salvation is an
[1:20:20] individual affair with
[1:20:23] you speak speaking in tongues is a gift
[1:20:25] of God I'm not getting rid of that
[1:20:27] that's part of it dancing in the spirit
[1:20:29] is the presence and glory of God it's a
[1:20:32] part of it but for you to let your
[1:20:35] character be molded into the image of
[1:20:40] God that's a hard prayer to
[1:20:43] ask because he went through a lot of
[1:20:46] things notice I'm going to say it again
[1:20:48] but for you to let your character be
[1:20:50] molded into the image of God that he
[1:20:52] projects himself and you oh my you are
[1:20:57] his
[1:20:59] Idol walking on the earth the expressed
[1:21:02] image of
[1:21:04] him oh my now if that doesn't humble
[1:21:08] you then you're looking at it
[1:21:10] wrong to know what I've come from to
[1:21:14] know what I was to know what I've done
[1:21:16] to know my faults and my mistakes but
[1:21:18] I'm so glad he didn't see that that
[1:21:21] wasn't who I was I like the song he
[1:21:24] looked beyond my fault and he seen my
[1:21:26] need he recognized that that there was
[1:21:29] more listen I have to recognize that
[1:21:31] there's more than what I see because I
[1:21:34] hold myself back come on point it at
[1:21:37] yourself you hold yourself back from
[1:21:40] what God can do for you oh my then he
[1:21:43] projects himself oh I love that the
[1:21:46] expressed image of him now would you be
[1:21:49] willing to do that in the days of
[1:21:52] Noah or would you have been on the
[1:21:54] critical side criticizing both the
[1:21:57] prophet and his God sent message now
[1:22:01] think of it which side would you think
[1:22:04] in in notice in your present State
[1:22:09] now would you took now be honest that's
[1:22:12] what he says what would you have taken
[1:22:15] well you say well of course I I be I
[1:22:17] would be with him I absolutely well
[1:22:19] let's go back for a moment and let's
[1:22:20] just really look at the
[1:22:22] fanaticism of his message
[1:22:27] message because we know that as far well
[1:22:31] as far as We Know by this message there
[1:22:32] was never any
[1:22:34] rain so he's speaking of something
[1:22:37] brother that had not been existent by
[1:22:41] science so there was no sitting across a
[1:22:44] conver a table and conversating about
[1:22:46] rain right you ever tried to sit across
[1:22:49] the table and talk about this message to
[1:22:52] someone hello listen it's even hard
[1:22:55] where you can sit across the table with
[1:22:56] Believers
[1:22:59] hello I mean could you imagine the
[1:23:01] conversation now he was deemed brother
[1:23:03] McGary as a crazy guy I I'm sorry to put
[1:23:06] you in that but he was deemed as a crazy
[1:23:11] guy somebody who is can I just say off
[1:23:14] his rocker I mean here he is speaking of
[1:23:16] something and he's building a boat I
[1:23:19] don't think he was by any great oceans
[1:23:20] brother Danny I don't think he was by
[1:23:23] any Great Lakes now we're building a
[1:23:25] boat in the middle of nowhere expecting
[1:23:27] rain that we've never seen before in
[1:23:30] fact it's not even in the
[1:23:33] dictionary now be
[1:23:36] honest you see if we're not careful it's
[1:23:40] easy to get to play the message but yet
[1:23:44] get so close to the world that we're not
[1:23:47] questioned about the
[1:23:50] message think about it we get so close
[1:23:55] because we you know I I know your
[1:23:57] sisters you're thinking well not us you
[1:24:00] can do it
[1:24:01] too you're not the only ones that wear
[1:24:03] dresses right I understand it's it's few
[1:24:07] and far between maybe I'll just speak to
[1:24:09] us Brothers if we're not
[1:24:10] careful our life our actions our
[1:24:13] attitude is not lived in a
[1:24:16] manner to where we're question about
[1:24:19] what it is we
[1:24:20] believe what keeps holding you
[1:24:24] why are you still serving God why do you
[1:24:26] still show up to church on Wednesday
[1:24:28] night when you know you got to go to
[1:24:30] work the next day why do you still do
[1:24:32] this when everything falls apart when
[1:24:34] this one's this thing is happening this
[1:24:36] thing is happening I don't know why I'm
[1:24:38] doing it but I know that there's
[1:24:39] something what proof was there for
[1:24:41] Noah's time that rain would appear what
[1:24:44] proof do you have that the Rapture is
[1:24:46] almost here that we're fixing to be
[1:24:49] gone what proof do you have listen you
[1:24:53] cannot sit across the table and explain
[1:24:56] that proof to them we need to stop
[1:24:59] trying we need to live this word we need
[1:25:01] to live this life keep
[1:25:05] building I I I'm using different types
[1:25:07] you're just going to have to bear with
[1:25:08] me let him fix it later keep building
[1:25:10] the boat keep building up for your
[1:25:13] family let them say what they're going
[1:25:15] to say you can't explain this message
[1:25:18] think about it eight
[1:25:22] people there was family involved ined
[1:25:24] too right family involved that missed
[1:25:29] out what if it what if it was the last
[1:25:31] day things began to turn and and and and
[1:25:35] uh uh uh the the father-in-law
[1:25:38] mother-in-law was sitting at the table
[1:25:39] and they were having a conversation I
[1:25:41] wonder I I wonder if maybe they're right
[1:25:44] about this but after all these years and
[1:25:48] maybe they made that okay we're going to
[1:25:50] we're going to try to make this we're
[1:25:51] going to do this how many people sit in
[1:25:53] the church for year after year after
[1:25:56] year after year listen it wasn't Noah
[1:25:59] that closed the door it was God that
[1:26:02] close the door and he will eventually
[1:26:04] close the door that's why we've got to
[1:26:07] make our calling and election sure now
[1:26:09] it's no it's more than just coming to
[1:26:11] church and say I'm going to try it out
[1:26:12] or sitting around the table and say well
[1:26:14] let's see what happens I don't want to
[1:26:16] see what happens because when the rain
[1:26:17] starts the fall the door was already
[1:26:22] closed what was the proof what what did
[1:26:25] did we find in a scripture where there
[1:26:27] was any Miracles performed why don't you
[1:26:30] show us a miracle Noah no all I know is
[1:26:33] that he said it sir if that's not enough
[1:26:37] for you I can't help you well I tell you
[1:26:40] what if God will just Heal Me of cancer
[1:26:42] then I'll believe no no if God will just
[1:26:46] if God will just take care of this need
[1:26:48] then I'll know no he said it and I
[1:26:51] believe it he said it then I believe it
[1:26:54] it doesn't matter what is going on we
[1:26:56] can go through this life we might go
[1:26:58] through this life in a wheelchair go
[1:27:00] through this life fighting these battles
[1:27:02] but he said he'll be with us through
[1:27:04] those things listen are you is this is
[1:27:06] it worth
[1:27:11] it it was simply a word spoken to a man
[1:27:14] deemed
[1:27:15] crazy and he wasn't the popular
[1:27:18] opinion you see if we're not careful we
[1:27:20] become so desperate to perform or to see
[1:27:23] a perform performance in instead of
[1:27:26] Simply taking God at his
[1:27:29] word because we've gotten away from the
[1:27:31] word and it's not it's lost its effect
[1:27:33] in the church now we have to
[1:27:35] perform we're moving right back into if
[1:27:38] we're not careful into uh uh and to the
[1:27:41] uh the the shuck come
[1:27:43] on that's not the bride of Christ no
[1:27:47] we're not here to
[1:27:49] perform come on perform for me show me
[1:27:52] show me something give me something
[1:27:54] something Pastor give me something
[1:27:56] preacher I I I I really want to know I'm
[1:27:57] going to preach the word and if that's
[1:28:00] not enough then you're in the wrong
[1:28:03] place you see it's not about patting
[1:28:05] people on the back to try to get come on
[1:28:08] to try to make them feel
[1:28:10] good give them the word
[1:28:12] test oh my instead of s you've got to
[1:28:15] take them what is happening it is Satan
[1:28:18] doing it he's coming in the midst he's
[1:28:20] trying to stir us all up he's trying to
[1:28:22] get our attention and focus focus on
[1:28:24] something else instead of the word of
[1:28:26] God that has been given in this hour and
[1:28:28] he's keeping the word from the people
[1:28:32] because we're putting it back into man
[1:28:34] we're putting the power back into man if
[1:28:36] we're not careful and he keeps it from
[1:28:38] your mouth because now we come looking
[1:28:42] for a man we come looking for flesh when
[1:28:44] the word of God is in our midst right
[1:28:47] now before you is the word of God and
[1:28:49] you through the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:51] Ghost have the authority to look Satan
[1:28:54] right in the eye and say get thee behind
[1:28:56] me Satan that Authority is to you now
[1:28:59] I'm not against the laying on of hands
[1:29:01] I'm not against prayer lines I've seen
[1:29:03] wonderful things happen in that but if
[1:29:05] you go through the prayer line expecting
[1:29:08] something from a man you're missing it
[1:29:10] we come together with unity of the faith
[1:29:13] knowing that our faith combined Satan
[1:29:16] cannot stand against that faith it
[1:29:18] shouldn't take a miracle simply trust
[1:29:21] the word of God what if you never seen
[1:29:24] Miracle again what if you never seen
[1:29:26] blind eyes open what if you never seen
[1:29:28] the cancer fall off would you still
[1:29:30] stand upon the word of
[1:29:32] God it's our Authority it's our
[1:29:35] promise be it unto me according to Thy
[1:29:39] word it's time to trust in our calling
[1:29:42] it's time for Ministries to trust in
[1:29:44] their calling the Ministries are not the
[1:29:47] same We Don't Preach the same but we
[1:29:49] preach the same word of God I'm not here
[1:29:52] to preach like brother McGary or brother
[1:29:54] brother Danny or brother Ben wall I'm
[1:29:55] not here to preach like uh uh any any of
[1:29:58] the ministers that are here I'm here to
[1:30:00] be what God's called me to be I'm not
[1:30:02] here to sing like anybody or play like
[1:30:04] anybody or act like this church or do
[1:30:06] like this church I'm here to be what God
[1:30:08] has called me to be and God has called
[1:30:11] you in this godforsaken country if you
[1:30:14] would to be a light in this
[1:30:18] surrounding of just everywhere around
[1:30:20] you is just horror
[1:30:25] you got to show me a miracle no every
[1:30:28] day you wake up that's enough
[1:30:31] Miracle every day you let me go further
[1:30:34] in that every day you wake up with a
[1:30:35] desire to hear that message is the
[1:30:38] miracle every day you wake up with a
[1:30:40] desire in your heart to pray for
[1:30:41] somebody that's a miracle I'm not saying
[1:30:44] well I I'm not going to be that that per
[1:30:47] oh dear lord I don't know if I want to
[1:30:48] get on that I don't want to be that
[1:30:49] person never mind I'm not going to get
[1:30:51] on that I felt checked okay
[1:30:54] hey you get up here and and deal with
[1:30:56] what God's trying to do no it's it's not
[1:30:59] about a
[1:31:00] show God says that sometimes your
[1:31:02] prayers don't need to be
[1:31:06] told prayer closets are not always going
[1:31:08] to be in the Forefront of
[1:31:12] Facebook prayer closets are not only
[1:31:14] going to be the Forefront of Tik
[1:31:16] Tock come on no sometimes it's quiet
[1:31:20] time by yourself and God begins to deal
[1:31:22] with you Lord I don't know what what's
[1:31:24] going wrong with this sister or this
[1:31:25] brother but I'm going to pray for this
[1:31:27] one I'm going to pray for this one and
[1:31:29] you pray for him and you move on knowing
[1:31:32] that what placed that in your heart was
[1:31:33] not the devil that was God dealing with
[1:31:37] you to pray for someone and if he plac
[1:31:39] it upon your heart it is his word in you
[1:31:42] you say the prayer and you move on
[1:31:44] knowing that it's already
[1:31:46] done hallelujah feel like preaching just
[1:31:49] a little bit tonight trust in your
[1:31:51] calling trust in your purpose TR trust
[1:31:54] in God's timing it's hard for Humanity
[1:31:56] to trust in the timing of God because we
[1:31:59] want healed and we want healed
[1:32:01] now we want the house sold now we want
[1:32:04] the car repaired now we want the coffee
[1:32:10] now popcorn now we come to church get it
[1:32:14] over with now no trust in the timing of
[1:32:17] God I love how God slows things down
[1:32:21] because sometimes things need to be
[1:32:23] slowed down
[1:32:25] some I'm talking I'm not just talking
[1:32:26] about a slow sermon I'm not just I'm
[1:32:28] talking about sometimes we just need a
[1:32:30] slow down yes sir and listen to God come
[1:32:35] back to the house of God With A open
[1:32:37] heart and a desire to say God I want
[1:32:40] something more than just an emotion
[1:32:42] tonight I want something that'll go deep
[1:32:44] down in my heart I'm a young person and
[1:32:46] I'm fighting these battles and I'm going
[1:32:48] through these difficulties and God knows
[1:32:50] and he cares about your youth but you've
[1:32:53] got to open your heart to him and trust
[1:32:55] in him recognize that Satan has
[1:32:57] something out there for you that God has
[1:33:00] something far greater and it goes beyond
[1:33:03] what you can see it goes beyond what you
[1:33:06] can
[1:33:08] feel take him at his
[1:33:10] word you have a purpose you say well I'm
[1:33:12] not a preacher you still have a purpose
[1:33:15] you have to trust in his
[1:33:17] timing how long did Abraham
[1:33:20] wait long
[1:33:22] time listen the these are scriptures
[1:33:24] that you know I'm not teaching you or
[1:33:25] preaching anything new tonight I wish I
[1:33:28] could but I I'm not going to No it's
[1:33:31] it's already been spoken as we heard
[1:33:32] today in the message and I don't want to
[1:33:35] go beyond what God gave to our Prophet
[1:33:38] we're not we're not in we're listen
[1:33:40] we're not supposed to go beyond what God
[1:33:43] has already
[1:33:44] revealed I hope you understand what I'm
[1:33:46] trying to say there you can might you
[1:33:49] might you might not understand that and
[1:33:50] maybe you can I can explain it later but
[1:33:52] notice what brother brandham says
[1:33:53] greater than Solomon is here he says
[1:33:55] it's the same old devil that put a rag
[1:33:59] over our Lord's eyes in the palace that
[1:34:02] morning covered up his eyes and they
[1:34:04] took a stick those drunken brawling
[1:34:06] soldiers and hit him on the head with it
[1:34:09] and then passed the stick one to another
[1:34:11] and said we understand that you know the
[1:34:13] secrets of the heart we understand that
[1:34:15] you're a prophet if you're a prophet
[1:34:19] prophesy and tell us who hit you we
[1:34:23] we'll believe it then you see notice
[1:34:26] what he says there see that's the same
[1:34:28] old
[1:34:30] devil God don't clown for
[1:34:33] nobody this message ain't for clowning
[1:34:36] this message ain't for proving one man
[1:34:39] this message is for vindicating the
[1:34:42] Bride of Jesus Christ for this day what
[1:34:44] what are we trying to do and when she
[1:34:46] recognizes when the church or she
[1:34:47] recognizes who she is and Satan is doing
[1:34:51] whatever he can to get your eyes off of
[1:34:53] who you can be by the word listen not by
[1:34:57] Miracles not by prophecy I'm not against
[1:35:00] those things I I believe in those things
[1:35:02] but I'm telling you we've got to get our
[1:35:03] eyes back on to Simply trusting his word
[1:35:07] be it unto me according to Thy word I
[1:35:10] might not feel it I might not see it she
[1:35:13] didn't feel that life kicking in her yet
[1:35:16] but she said be it unto me according to
[1:35:18] Thy
[1:35:19] word and he said that devil he said now
[1:35:22] said that God don't clown for nobody
[1:35:24] it's the same old devil that said come
[1:35:26] off the cross let's see you perform a
[1:35:29] miracle that devil lives
[1:35:32] today God forbid we in our message
[1:35:35] churches get to a point where we start
[1:35:37] saying why don't you perform a
[1:35:41] miracle we get beyond the word of God
[1:35:43] when we do that listen I again I'm I'm
[1:35:47] not trying to belittle Miracles but I'm
[1:35:50] just saying come back to Simply trusting
[1:35:52] his word and be in his time let's go a
[1:35:56] step further in this Jesus never used
[1:35:58] his
[1:35:59] power to defeat Satan he defeated him by
[1:36:03] the
[1:36:07] word so you can look at how he defeated
[1:36:10] Satan and you and and the way he did it
[1:36:12] you can't you have no
[1:36:15] excuse because he did not come and say
[1:36:17] well this is only for prophets and they
[1:36:21] and and this is only for evangelists and
[1:36:23] is only for pastors because you know
[1:36:25] they have to perform a certain thing
[1:36:28] that's not how he defeated them he
[1:36:29] defeated them by the word that's been
[1:36:32] placed in your hands to not perform a
[1:36:35] miracle to not listen you say well I
[1:36:37] wish I could pray like so and so God
[1:36:39] didn't call you to pray like so and so I
[1:36:41] wish I could I wish I could just do just
[1:36:43] like this one God didn't call you to be
[1:36:45] like that he called you to be who you
[1:36:47] are now speak the very Living Word of
[1:36:50] God but I tell you you cannot do it
[1:36:52] until you're born
[1:36:54] again that's
[1:36:57] right notice he says in Matthew 4:4 and
[1:36:59] I'm just going to quote this uh but he
[1:37:01] said it is written man shall not live by
[1:37:03] bread alone but by every word that
[1:37:04] proceedeth out of the mouth of God right
[1:37:07] now many times we have read this and
[1:37:09] we're thinking well that's it but
[1:37:11] actually he was quoting Deuteronomy 8:3
[1:37:13] and he says and he humbled thee and
[1:37:15] suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[1:37:16] with Mana which thou knewest not neither
[1:37:19] did thy fathers know that he might make
[1:37:21] thee know that man do not live by bread
[1:37:25] only but by every word that proceedeth
[1:37:27] out of the mouth of the Lord doth Man
[1:37:30] live so Jesus went back to the
[1:37:33] word you don't need some special signs
[1:37:36] and wonders simply go back to the word
[1:37:40] what are you waiting for everything that
[1:37:42] you have every promise that you have is
[1:37:45] laying before you today yes
[1:37:48] amen and Satan's wanting to get your
[1:37:51] eyes off of it and try to look for
[1:37:54] something you see in this hour we we
[1:37:56] were given a prophet that would be
[1:37:58] Vindicated by what the
[1:38:01] word not by the signs and wonders only
[1:38:04] but by the word god used signs and
[1:38:06] wonders brother Brandon made the
[1:38:08] statement himself I wish I'd never
[1:38:09] performed a
[1:38:10] miracle look it up he made that I wish I
[1:38:14] would have never performed a miracle God
[1:38:17] didn't call me to do that think about
[1:38:20] these things what Drew your attention
[1:38:23] the
[1:38:25] word yeah the signs and wonders are
[1:38:27] wonderful and and and I want to tell you
[1:38:29] a way to increase faith is to go to the
[1:38:32] end of that tape sometimes and and hear
[1:38:35] that being called out that increases my
[1:38:37] faith too so I'm not against that I'm
[1:38:41] for it something about the power of God
[1:38:43] being used and if you and if you uh
[1:38:45] watch uh uh 20th century Prophet or deep
[1:38:48] call it to the deep and you start and
[1:38:50] the word has gone forth and then you
[1:38:52] start seeing how God begins to use the
[1:38:54] prophet through those uh uh through
[1:38:55] those people that come through listen it
[1:38:58] encourages my heart and I and this may
[1:39:01] not affect you but for me as a little
[1:39:04] boy there was always something that that
[1:39:06] that got me more than one of the that
[1:39:08] that just literally caused me to cry and
[1:39:10] I didn't understand it was the very last
[1:39:12] brother that went up for
[1:39:14] prayer and brother brandham says you're
[1:39:16] a
[1:39:18] minister and he wanted he was saying you
[1:39:20] were praying for a
[1:39:22] Revival he say that how what does that
[1:39:24] affect you I did not know what my
[1:39:26] calling was going to be but something
[1:39:28] drew me to that every single time you're
[1:39:31] not here for this you're here you want a
[1:39:32] Revival and listen if there is any
[1:39:34] pastor we want an old-fashioned Revival
[1:39:38] in our
[1:39:39] church now you see the problem with that
[1:39:42] is is we get scared of that word because
[1:39:44] we start to identify it with
[1:39:48] movements I'm not identifying that with
[1:39:50] anybody's movement or anybody's opinion
[1:39:53] but an old-fashioned Revival to me my
[1:39:55] heart is is the word of God coming forth
[1:39:58] cutting things out of the way and when
[1:40:01] the word of God begins to come forth the
[1:40:02] Bible said when the word was spoken they
[1:40:04] were pricked in their hearts and the
[1:40:07] pricking caused a reaction the signs
[1:40:10] didn't cause a reaction the word caused
[1:40:12] a reaction and if you look at that word
[1:40:15] pricking it's not
[1:40:19] tickling look it up sometime and I know
[1:40:22] you've said the church before and you've
[1:40:23] heard and you felt some pricking but
[1:40:25] it's the word of God thank God for the
[1:40:28] pricking word thank God for the word
[1:40:30] that'll come in and it'll be direct to
[1:40:33] your need direct to your heart it
[1:40:34] doesn't matter who the minister is it
[1:40:36] doesn't matter who God is using he knows
[1:40:40] how to get directly to your
[1:40:43] need notice what he says in the pergam
[1:40:46] church
[1:40:47] age uh he says but what do we have in
[1:40:51] this our day multitudes are working
[1:40:53] signs until we have a generation of sign
[1:40:57] Seekers that know little or nothing
[1:41:00] about the word you see I I if if this is
[1:41:03] heard if somebody comes in and hears a
[1:41:05] clip of of this what I'm preaching now
[1:41:07] they're going to label brother Jeremy as
[1:41:10] not believing in
[1:41:12] Miracles sounds like somebody just
[1:41:14] listening to a portion of the
[1:41:17] message and before you know it we now
[1:41:19] have all these nuggets that are are are
[1:41:22] slanted
[1:41:25] in the way that we think they should go
[1:41:28] but you know what I I'm going to sleep
[1:41:30] good tonight knowing what I
[1:41:33] believe and it doesn't matter what any
[1:41:36] of you
[1:41:37] think I know who I am and I know what I
[1:41:41] believe now you say what did you say
[1:41:43] that for because one of my battles has
[1:41:45] always been worried about what you think
[1:41:48] so I just punched that devil in the
[1:41:51] face I don't care what you think think I
[1:41:54] care what he thinks of me Hallelujah and
[1:41:57] what he thinks of me he's not going to
[1:41:59] let me get I'm so glad Brother David
[1:42:01] that there was a prophet that said get
[1:42:03] back in line because there were going to
[1:42:05] be times that Jeremy got out of line I'm
[1:42:08] not perfect but by his grace I can still
[1:42:10] hear a voice that says get back in line
[1:42:13] stay with the word of God it shouldn't
[1:42:16] take a miracle but if I can keep my
[1:42:18] heart open to the word of God
[1:42:23] that's right our true move of the spirit
[1:42:25] of God if they see blood oil and fire
[1:42:27] they're happy it matters not what is in
[1:42:29] the word they will support any sign even
[1:42:33] unscriptural ones but God has warned us
[1:42:35] about that he said in Matthew 24 that in
[1:42:37] the last days two Spirits would be so
[1:42:39] close together that that only the very
[1:42:41] elect could tell them apart for they
[1:42:44] alone would not be deceived let me just
[1:42:46] say something that is a very profound
[1:42:50] statement because we are living there
[1:42:54] now it truly takes the discernment of
[1:42:58] the Holy Spirit the studying of the word
[1:43:00] of God not
[1:43:02] intellectually but by his heart by his
[1:43:05] heart to be able to discern those two
[1:43:08] things because listen there there's
[1:43:11] signs and wonders out there but and it
[1:43:13] looks just like what it should look like
[1:43:16] God help us to understand Satan's not
[1:43:18] coming at you with worldly things
[1:43:20] because you've already overcome them so
[1:43:22] he's going to come at at you with
[1:43:23] something that looks so close that'll
[1:43:25] draw your attention and if you are not
[1:43:28] uh if you're not the elect of God you
[1:43:30] will be deceived but that's why I'm so
[1:43:33] glad the word of God did not leave an
[1:43:35] out for the elect she will not be
[1:43:38] deceived but it should help it that that
[1:43:41] that word the prophet what he pointed us
[1:43:44] to here should keep us so uh uh stable
[1:43:47] and so sober in these
[1:43:50] times sober think about it says how can
[1:43:54] you tell the two Spirits apart just give
[1:43:55] them the word test the crazy thing about
[1:43:58] that is is that everyone says
[1:44:00] that listen everyone says that well
[1:44:04] we've got the word we've got the word
[1:44:07] you see a lot of times we say we have
[1:44:09] the word but you want to know how you
[1:44:10] have it or not is by the character here
[1:44:13] we go back again to the character of
[1:44:15] what's going
[1:44:16] on character will always prove what word
[1:44:20] you have listen
[1:44:23] give them the word test if they don't
[1:44:25] excuse me if they don't speak that word
[1:44:27] they are of the evil one and the evil
[1:44:29] one deceive the first two Brides he will
[1:44:31] try to deceive the Bride of this last
[1:44:32] day by trying to get her to hybridize
[1:44:34] herself through Creeds or just plainly
[1:44:37] turning from the word to any sign that
[1:44:41] suits
[1:44:43] her well you know what this church just
[1:44:45] don't suit
[1:44:47] me yeah I would say uhoh
[1:44:50] too now this is not in the message so
[1:44:53] I'm not worried about it I'm just going
[1:44:54] to preach it because I'm this doesn't
[1:44:56] happen in the message I better repent of
[1:44:59] that it's not about what suits
[1:45:03] me and you notice how God will put you
[1:45:05] in situations that don't suit
[1:45:07] you if we keep looking for situations
[1:45:10] that suit us we're doing the wrong thing
[1:45:14] because you notice listen I we if you
[1:45:16] claim to to believe a prophet that God
[1:45:18] sent us listen to what What's Happening
[1:45:21] Here I'm going to read that again just
[1:45:25] plainly turning from the word to any
[1:45:27] sign that suits
[1:45:31] her but God never plac signs ahead of
[1:45:34] the
[1:45:35] word signs follow the word and when
[1:45:38] Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for
[1:45:42] him
[1:45:43] first can you imagine that how
[1:45:48] rude I mean don't you know how difficult
[1:45:50] it is for me Brother David I need you to
[1:45:53] do something for me prophet of God said
[1:45:56] no do this first but it's all I've got
[1:45:59] do this
[1:46:02] first you imagine can you imagine being
[1:46:05] that that woman that come in and and and
[1:46:07] Jesus loving
[1:46:09] Jesus said uh it's not for the dogs you
[1:46:12] know and or you know what I'm you know
[1:46:15] how many knows what I'm talking
[1:46:19] about I want to let that sink in that's
[1:46:21] that's a pretty potent church service
[1:46:23] right
[1:46:24] there everyone coming up and he said
[1:46:26] you're this you know you're a
[1:46:30] dog well going over to the next church
[1:46:33] this church don't suit me right that's
[1:46:37] right I'm going to ask you what you he
[1:46:38] for in the first place why'd she go to
[1:46:41] him in the first place it was it was
[1:46:43] beyond her feelings there was something
[1:46:45] in her heart that was going beyond
[1:46:47] anything else and that's why we're not
[1:46:49] in this for our feelings we're not in
[1:46:51] this to make ourselves feel better
[1:46:53] we're in this to get the word of God no
[1:46:55] matter what it takes it's not about how
[1:46:58] what makes me feel good God places Us in
[1:47:01] some sticky situations but it's for our
[1:47:04] good he allows things to come up in the
[1:47:07] church for our
[1:47:11] good because if everything was peaches
[1:47:13] and cream of course this church would
[1:47:15] just
[1:47:18] explode which I'm thankful that it's
[1:47:20] exploding but you understand what I'm
[1:47:21] saying you're with me brother scratching
[1:47:23] his head over there I don't know what's
[1:47:25] happening are we doing okay brother
[1:47:27] Davey
[1:47:28] okay signs follow the word and when
[1:47:32] Elijah told the woman to bake a cake for
[1:47:33] him first according to the word of the
[1:47:35] Lord when she did as the word said the
[1:47:39] proper sign came come to the
[1:47:42] word I'm G to say it again come to the
[1:47:45] word and then watch the miracle so
[1:47:48] brother Jeremy's not against Miracles
[1:47:51] absolutely not but it shouldn't take a
[1:47:53] miracle for me to believe the word
[1:47:56] because it's his word spoken for me
[1:47:59] through me and to
[1:48:01] me bake the cake first have faith in God
[1:48:06] only believe which means nothing Rivals
[1:48:11] it come to the word first the seed word
[1:48:15] is energized by the spirit the greatest
[1:48:18] desire in the heart of a Believer must
[1:48:21] be for the truth
[1:48:24] that should be your greatest desire is
[1:48:26] for his word in your
[1:48:28] heart beyond anything else it should be
[1:48:32] for that word notice hady Wright said
[1:48:34] that that's the
[1:48:36] truth before anything
[1:48:39] happened she was listening to what God
[1:48:42] was
[1:48:43] doing and as far as I know she hadn't
[1:48:45] seen it she heard it and that ain't
[1:48:47] nothing but the truth and her Amen to
[1:48:50] the word brought forth the greatest
[1:48:53] gift let this be a
[1:48:56] generation that takes the book I don't
[1:49:00] want to be a generation that takes a
[1:49:03] sign we cannot just be pointed to a
[1:49:08] sign we've got to that's that listen he
[1:49:11] sent us a prophet that pointed us to the
[1:49:13] word I can't remember who said it
[1:49:15] perhaps you could help me Brother David
[1:49:16] on this but I believe it was brother
[1:49:17] Perry maybe somebody who made the
[1:49:19] statement and said we didn't know what
[1:49:20] he was saying until after he was gone
[1:49:23] talking about brother
[1:49:25] Brandon we didn't know what he was
[1:49:27] saying until after he was gone why
[1:49:28] because they were focused on the signs
[1:49:32] they were focused on the Wonders they
[1:49:33] didn't hear the
[1:49:34] word that was being spoken and then when
[1:49:37] God took the prophet off the scene then
[1:49:39] they started diving into those tapes I
[1:49:41] was sitting there and I didn't hear
[1:49:43] that
[1:49:45] hello it's like it happens many times
[1:49:47] the pastor and the local body uh uh uh
[1:49:50] they're just working and they're working
[1:49:51] and they're tilling the soil and they're
[1:49:53] tilling the soil and then brother Danny
[1:49:54] steaman comes along and he preaches the
[1:49:56] same thing and somebody comes and said
[1:49:58] I've never heard that
[1:50:04] before
[1:50:07] hello thank God for the
[1:50:10] tilling but it should be the greatest
[1:50:12] desire notice what we're Revelation
[1:50:14] 10:10 you know this you're studied up in
[1:50:16] this but I just want to encourage you
[1:50:17] with this and I took the little book out
[1:50:19] of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:50:21] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:50:23] soon as I had eaten my belly was bitter
[1:50:25] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:50:27] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:50:29] and tongues and Kings this is what we
[1:50:31] need to do today is to take this word
[1:50:33] and it's going to affect us when we eat
[1:50:35] it it's going to it's going to affect
[1:50:38] our life it's not always going to suit
[1:50:40] this
[1:50:41] flesh but when we eat it and we take it
[1:50:44] we are been told to prophesy again now
[1:50:47] this word prophesy means to utter forth
[1:50:49] to declare a thing which can only be
[1:50:52] known by divine revelation so this is
[1:50:55] not something that is just coming from a
[1:50:57] church it is not something that is just
[1:50:59] coming from a religion it is not
[1:51:01] something that is just coming from a
[1:51:03] sign or a Wonder but it is coming by
[1:51:06] divine
[1:51:07] revelation the knowledge come on come
[1:51:10] stay with me we're coming to a close
[1:51:12] quickly here divine revelation of the
[1:51:14] word of God
[1:51:18] yes eat the book eat the book eat the
[1:51:21] book eat the book every day eat the book
[1:51:24] take the word take the word take the
[1:51:26] word eat it eat it you I want you to
[1:51:28] wake up in the morning say I've got to
[1:51:29] eat the book I've got to eat the book
[1:51:31] come on young people you've got to say
[1:51:33] the same thing I know you got to go to
[1:51:34] college and I know you got your jobs and
[1:51:36] I know all these things but all these
[1:51:37] things will fade away all these things
[1:51:39] will get to a point where you can't move
[1:51:40] anymore and when you get to that point
[1:51:41] where you can't move anymore have you
[1:51:43] been eating the book eat the book eat
[1:51:45] the book come on say it eat the book eat
[1:51:47] the book take it prophesy again that
[1:51:49] word's got to come forth It's got to
[1:51:51] come from you it's not just for the
[1:51:53] ministry alone but it's for the Bride of
[1:51:55] Jesus Christ to speak it again we need
[1:51:57] to get off our camels and get into the
[1:52:01] tent that's
[1:52:03] right that's a different sermon I don't
[1:52:06] know where that came from but that felt
[1:52:09] good see what are you talking about we
[1:52:11] need to get beyond all these scenes get
[1:52:13] into that place with him close the doors
[1:52:16] behind us forget about everything that's
[1:52:18] going on around us slow down time Lord I
[1:52:22] just want want to be with
[1:52:23] you I just want to be with you I don't
[1:52:25] need no signs and wonders thank thank
[1:52:27] you for the gifts that you gave me and
[1:52:28] I'm glad that he gave the gifts he did
[1:52:31] but I need more than that I need my time
[1:52:33] with you the scripture tells us that
[1:52:35] where the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:52:37] gathered together so this is not a
[1:52:39] chicken pecking
[1:52:42] meeting
[1:52:43] hello this is a gathering around the
[1:52:45] word of God it's time where we come to a
[1:52:48] unity and I'm talking about un it's hard
[1:52:49] for a church to come into Unity much
[1:52:52] less us wondering if other churches can
[1:52:54] come together we need to get our
[1:52:55] churches our own assembly to come into a
[1:52:57] Unity of the faith where we come and we
[1:53:00] push all the differences out and as our
[1:53:02] brother said uh the traditions of man
[1:53:04] and all of these things and how we
[1:53:06] perceive it should be and recognize that
[1:53:09] you're sitting next to someone that is
[1:53:11] human just like you and they may not
[1:53:13] have the understanding that you have and
[1:53:15] you may not have the understanding that
[1:53:16] they have but God placed you together
[1:53:18] for a reason God put you in this Foxhole
[1:53:22] together the Foxhole of Fort Worth Texas
[1:53:25] and whatever part of it he put you here
[1:53:27] together for a reason not to seek after
[1:53:29] signs but recognize when the word Goes
[1:53:32] Forth something's going to
[1:53:34] happen you may not see it but something
[1:53:37] is happening even now in this building
[1:53:40] and I'm not trying to spiritualize it
[1:53:42] I'm just speaking to you the word that
[1:53:44] where two or three are gathered in his
[1:53:46] name he'd be in the midst and I know
[1:53:49] that angels are encamped about around
[1:53:51] about us
[1:53:52] I don't want to I don't want you to
[1:53:54] think that I'm just trying to to uh to
[1:53:55] bring you to such a a mental spiritual
[1:53:58] aspect I want you to know it's the word
[1:54:00] of God this his word that said by his
[1:54:03] stripes I am healed I don't have to have
[1:54:06] you tell me I'm Healed his word already

[1:54:13] his word says I can be saved I don't
[1:54:16] have to tell you I don't have to hear
[1:54:18] you tell me that my children can be
[1:54:19] filled with the Holy Ghost his word says
[1:54:22] it my promise I don't need a miracle for
[1:54:25] those things I just need to take them at
[1:54:27] his word somebody here tonight needs to

[1:54:33] quit looking for some big thing to
[1:54:35] happen get back to his word and trust

[1:56:42] Sodom have to look forward to what does
[1:56:46] Sodom have to look forward to nothing
[1:56:49] what does the bride have look forward to
[1:56:51] we have a reward that goes beyond I'm
[1:56:53] glad that God allowed our Prophet to go
[1:56:55] beyond the curtain of time I'm so glad
[1:56:58] that God allowed us to have a prophet
[1:57:00] that would see things that we would
[1:57:01] never see but what did it do it gave us
[1:57:04] a little hope it goes beyond Hollywood's
[1:57:06] harps on clouds hello it goes beyond
[1:57:09] Hollywood's idea of what heaven is it
[1:57:11] goes beyond those things it goes beyond
[1:57:13] our imagination but one day brothers and
[1:57:16] sisters we'll come together and him and
[1:57:18] I will be the same age and that won't
[1:57:21] matter we'll run a we might not run a
[1:57:23] foot race together I don't really care
[1:57:25] as long as we're there
[1:57:27] together what's it matter
[1:57:30] anyways I want to really bring this down
[1:57:32] to this what's the greatest reward
[1:57:35] anyway a moment of
[1:57:38] healing a moment of
[1:57:40] pleasure a moment of
[1:57:44] satisfaction is God with someone more
[1:57:47] who had miraculous healings than someone
[1:57:49] who was still in a wheelchair
[1:57:52] I'm bringing it bringing it
[1:57:54] home you can have great faith from both
[1:57:57] sides to see someone that is still in a
[1:58:00] wheelchair said I know my redeemer
[1:58:03] lives I'm Healed Hallelujah I'm Healed
[1:58:06] I'm Healed hallelu I'm Healed come on I
[1:58:09] don't care what's going on I'm Healed
[1:58:11] I'm Healed that's
[1:58:13] Faith it's the same faith that someone
[1:58:16] who comes up and claims the word of God
[1:58:17] and that cancer falls off their face
[1:58:19] it's the same Faith it's the same trust
[1:58:21] in the word of God God is with both
[1:58:23] sides I want you to understand we cannot
[1:58:25] belittle one or the other God is working
[1:58:27] on both sides he's holding this body
[1:58:30] together and it is only him holding it
[1:58:32] together it's not a man it's not an
[1:58:34] apostle it's not a prophet it's no one
[1:58:36] that's holding this together but it's
[1:58:38] his word that's holding it together it's
[1:58:40] not the husband holding it together or
[1:58:42] the wife holding it together but it's
[1:58:44] God that's in the home that is holding
[1:58:46] it together hold on just a little while
[1:58:48] longer don't look for a miracle take him
[1:58:51] at his word
[1:58:53] you say well I I believe that God can
[1:58:54] heal me I've been praying for years you
[1:58:56] go on anyhow and claim your healing
[1:58:58] because his word is the same yesterday
[1:59:01] today and
[1:59:02] forever when the miracle came to hady
[1:59:06] right and she was given the
[1:59:09] opportunity you know the story she was
[1:59:13] given the opportunity of
[1:59:15] money
[1:59:16] healing right what did she
[1:59:20] take what did she
[1:59:24] take not a moment listen she she was
[1:59:27] poor she could have and healing is in
[1:59:29] the word of God I'm not belittling
[1:59:31] healing but I'm telling you what matters
[1:59:33] more just this little hickey of time of
[1:59:37] your heartache campaign with eternal uh
[1:59:40] uh happiness with God I tell you this
[1:59:43] life this life is worth more than
[1:59:45] anything else hold on Brothers hold on
[1:59:48] sisters young people don't throw in the
[1:59:50] towel you youve got to stand on the
[1:59:53] faith that God has placed in your heart
[1:59:55] if everyone sitting next to you walks
[1:59:57] away if this church falls apart you
[2:00:00] stand when no one else will stand that's
[2:00:04] the
[2:00:04] miracle standing when everyone else
[2:00:07] Falls away be it unto me according to
[2:00:10] Thy
[2:00:11] word oh Hallelujah Just Close Your Eyes
[2:00:14] for a
[2:00:16] moment I don't care what it is you're
[2:00:18] going through right now whatever your
[2:00:21] battle is whatever your heartache is the
[2:00:23] darkest thing that you're going through
[2:00:25] can you say it right now with all Faith
[2:00:27] be it unto me according to Thy word
[2:00:30] blessings will happen Miracles will
[2:00:32] happen in this message but can you sit
[2:00:36] right where you're at can you stand can
[2:00:38] you say without every with every ounce
[2:00:40] of Faith inside of you I don't feel it
[2:00:44] but be it unto me according to Thy
[2:00:47] word sometimes we're always praying to
[2:00:50] get out of something instead of
[2:00:52] sometimes always praying to get out of
[2:00:54] it maybe we need to come and say God
[2:00:55] what can I get out of this what can I
[2:00:58] get out of this situation
[2:01:00] Hallelujah Lord Jesus you see
[2:01:04] these this these wonderful people here
[2:01:08] tonight some have stood some are sitting
[2:01:11] whatever it is but I've asked them Lord
[2:01:12] to think about all these things
[2:01:13] musicians can come just play something
[2:01:16] softly
[2:01:17] now we're not looking for some great
[2:01:19] sign or wonder we we know that that's
[2:01:22] going to happen because we're
[2:01:24] Believers we know that if we take you at
[2:01:26] your word great things are going to
[2:01:28] happen we know that if we take you at
[2:01:30] your word we're going to see cancer fall
[2:01:32] off we know that if we take you at your
[2:01:35] word we're going to see wonderful
[2:01:38] things but if I never see it
[2:01:42] again if I never see the blind eyes
[2:01:46] open if I never see anyone run out of a
[2:01:50] wheelchair I still Trust You
[2:01:54] Lord this goes beyond this moment
[2:01:58] Church don't you see what Satan's trying
[2:02:01] to
[2:02:02] do he's trying to get you to to to reach
[2:02:05] after something that you can grasp that
[2:02:07] you can explain he pulls you into the
[2:02:10] Trap of
[2:02:12] explanation you really cannot explain
[2:02:15] this message and the love of
[2:02:18] it you say well I don't believe that
[2:02:20] brother Jeremy well let me just go I
[2:02:22] believe the natural types of spiritual I
[2:02:24] cannot truly explain to you my love
[2:02:28] relationship with my spouse yes you see
[2:02:31] us together we hold hands but you do not
[2:02:34] understand the Dynamics you do not
[2:02:36] understand you do not understand what
[2:02:38] we've gone through and what we've been
[2:02:39] through I could not sit across and
[2:02:41] explain to you how it is but I know
[2:02:43] beyond a shadow of a doubt I love her
[2:02:45] with all of my heart and I know beyond
[2:02:47] the shadow of a doubt she loves me with
[2:02:48] all of her heart and nothing can
[2:02:50] separate that and it's the same with the
[2:02:52] message of the hour there is no way we
[2:02:54] can truly explain that love but I know
[2:02:57] beyond the shadow of a doubt by his word
[2:02:59] that he loves me more than I could ever
[2:03:01] imagine yes I know beyond the shadow of
[2:03:04] a doubt that I love him more than I
[2:03:06] could ever imagine and it's not
[2:03:08] something I can
[2:03:10] explain but all I want is to take him at
[2:03:14] his word if nothing else happens in my
[2:03:17] life if the car falls apart if the house
[2:03:20] falls apart if everything is taken from
[2:03:22] me if I end up on the streets as it were
[2:03:25] I will still hold to
[2:03:27] him cuz I know he loves me and this
[2:03:30] moment is only just a quick moment of
[2:03:33] Life there is an eternal that's waiting
[2:03:36] for you get beyond the heart feelings
[2:03:38] get rid of the bitterness get rid of all
[2:03:41] this stuff that Satan has thrown in let
[2:03:43] God come in these meetings and change
[2:03:46] you let them come in these meetings God
[2:03:49] has something for you but you've got to
