Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
Br. David McGeary Jr.
October 25, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

of our infirmities so that when we would go to you in need Lord you would be moved father there's many needs that were spoken tonight just lift them up to you again we know that it's a finished work by your stripes we are healed Lord we ask that the provision that's been provided for us in your word tonight you'd Feed Us father Lord may you come and give us our daily portion we have a substance we have need of Lord Lord we're needy of you we ask that you would come now may you just stand between the lips of the speaker and the hearer may you anoint each word father may you feed your sheep we pray we commit it to you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you if you turn in your Bibles we're going to take a text from 2 Kings uh chapter 7 and verse three just continuing on uh with what I see is just a theme of what the Lord's been dealing with and uh from the servants that our pastor Min ministered out of Investments I find this as we go it hope we'll just uh compliment and go further down the line but uh 2 Kings 7:3 and there were four leprous men at the entering of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit here we die also now therefore come let let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die God bless you you may have your seats the setting here is one where I feel that these leprous men probably ask themselves I think a question that's a a common question when people come into a place where God's dealing with their heart and it was what next I I think they they looked at the scenario they they counted the cost and if you could catch the scene it's a besieged city there's an an enemy Army has has been arrayed against the city and they're selling uh food the dung of a pigeon for like four things of silver uh it you know the our minds and and what we could comprehend I don't think any of us could understand the the depravity of man but just in the previous chapter talks about uh two mothers having come to the place of such hunger they made an agreement on Whose child they would eat first and uh one of the the mothers is now beseeching the king because the mother that had agreed to go first had boiled her child and now the second mother had hid hers and and just to catch uh that place of humanity a mother the love for a child how they had gone beyond the bounds uh so the condition in the land is one where these lepers are on the outside of the gate they're on the entering end of the city they're outside of that Calamity if you will and they probably in some ways were better off than what was going on inside maybe they didn't understand even what was transpiring entirely but one of the things that they caught was the desperation of the moment the desperation of the hour they were in they they made made a fair assessment if we stay here we die and the hour we live in is no different the Calamity that is outside it's death it's most certain death if you think you have the wherewithal to withstand the enemy in this hour uh you would be doomed left to your own devices matter of fact uh it just thinking of what he's wanting to accomplish and there's no saity to it anymore it's just out in the open he's declared he set The Siege and I'm so thankful the promise that when the enemy comes in like a flood God will raise a standard up against it we're not uh we're not dismayed by the hour we were told it would be here we we've got a place of Refuge that we've uh We've sold out to and that's what these guys did they sold out they had to make the decision you know what even if we go to the to the syrians and they kill us it's really no end in the situation but there's a hope they had this vague hope that that's really the only option we have and so they committed to it they sold out they saw that there might be a place of provision there now what they didn't even understand is that they're actually playing a part in a prophecy so in their desperation they are answering now to a call to a desire and they don't even understand that they're now walking in Prophecy because Elijah had promised that before the day was over that there was going to be such plenty that you know it's just right there in the first of the the chapter verse one says then Elisha said hear ye the words of the Lord thus sayith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of flour be sold for a shekele and two measures of barley for a shekele in the gate of of Samaria So within a day span it's going to go from starvation from Calamity and the the person who sought Elisha from the on the order of the king he he has a response to this prophecy he says then the Lord of those who uh the Lord on Whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said behold if the Lord would make Windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold this is Elisha now answering back to him because his response his attitude towards the word of the Prophet was well maybe maybe if you know the windows of Heaven open and you know it was I maybe that was I a good response right I you know if you put yourself in that situation and you just could take in everything that was happening now you're trying to interpret the prophecy you're sitting there and go well you know maybe so oh if God puts windows in heaven and that's his interpretation of the prophecy is you know but because of his approach towards the word of God Elisha tells him he says it's not you won't partake of it so you know we want to have the right attitude and right approach towards the Prophecies of God towards the word of God when it's spoken sir it's you don't need to inter it this man you know I I don't know how harsh his attitude was it seems like maybe he was trying to say God's a mighty God maybe he'll open the windows of Heaven um but he because of how the prophet you could see his uh answer to it he tells him you're not going to partake of it he says behold if God would make Windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but Thou shalt not eat thereof um we want to partake we want to eat of the Bountiful things of God we don't want to just have the wrong attitude and the wrong approach that puts it off for someone else but we want to be partakers of it so the the leopards in my assessment they did some good math right they they decided that if we stay here we die and they moved on and in verse 5 that says that as they arose in the Twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they had come into the uttermost part of the camp of Syria behold there was no man there for the Lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of Chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another Lo the Kings of Israel have hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and they fled and the Twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses and E even the camp as it was and and fled for their life and when the leopards came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried then silver and gold and rainment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried hint also and went and hid it so there's such a bounty that their first approach is this is ours let's make provision for ourselves and they do this twice at this point they're kind of making like I think we're getting tired of carrying all this stuff and hiding it and we've done it twice now you know the thing the goodness of God is starting to overflow here a little bit all right and when God does a work there's more than enough so they decide they got to go tell somebody if the Lord does something for you and it's a genuine work of the Lord you can't keep it to yourself matter of fact you it's not in the formula you you try to keep it to yourself you're going to bust an NN vessel with some new wine it's not in the formula um now verse N I believe that's where we're at then they said one to another we do not we do not well this is a day of Good Tidings and we hold our peace if we tar till the morning light some Mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household so they came and called the Porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man nor horse tied and the asses tied and the tents are as they were and he called the Porter and they told the King's house within now notice the fear of the Lord if you will upon him this is beyond our own doing it would be a travesty to keep this to ourselves we've got to go bear The Good Tidings and it ended up being the salvation of the people could you imagine even in the moments they wasted there was death in the city while they were taking their treasure and packing it out and saying this is all for me praise the Lord what a beautiful thing that that the Lord's done there was people perishing for hunger and starve Starving in the city and I don't need to draw a parallel that you you know what we're what we have I mean we we're feasting there's plenty we have the spoils we have a message that just dressing us in a wedding garment you know we're we're going to sit at the banquet table and it's God's provided place and it's not just so we can hoard it up for ourselves it is not uh we want the urgency of the hour to be to to catch us we I if if it's it's gross Darkness on the face of the people it's gross Darkness every moment you wait there's someone who could just be going further into the depths of sin and you have the very thing that could keep them from being scarred that could keep them from it it it's a word that sets free we we're not ashamed of this gospel it's the power of God to deliver you know the uh the holy spirit is here to brood out over his word you're a carrier of the very life you're a Son of God whatever the devil would do to neutralize you in your testimony you you have to say boo devil we're not in this hour this late in the game to to be bench Riders we're we're not to gather ourselves together in an assembly and not think that we don't have need of a daily bread and the daily portion from us we we should become pulling we should become hungry we should come thinking Lord what is it that I have need of because if you want to be uh poured out you want to be filled you're going to have to be poured out right so there there should be something that has transpired in your walk to be here some rub some you know some challenges where you've poured yourself out in prayer for the burdens of the that's in your heart for the for the Lost there there should be something that's transpiring so that when you come to the house of God you're hungry and your expectation is Lord fill me I've been poured out if you're coming and you're you're kind of content I will say it's not for one it's because there's no want in the word but are you are you giving it out it it have you found the burden that is your lot to carry and that's kind of what's on my heart as the Lord would lead I go ahead and turn to Matthew uh chapter 16 verse 24 the very familiar scripture I believe this is really another way of what was presented to the Rich Young Ruler and uh as we know what was challenged to him was to sell all he had and he was sorrowful I don't think he did good math I think that for him being a a Rich Young Ruler the leopards somehow understood that the question was more of that of life or death than the Rich Young Ruler did he thought it was just of monitary maybe it was his status maybe it was the ease of life that he was at question but really what was a question was his eternal destination and he didn't understand what was set before him in Matthew 16: 24 Jesus said unto his disciples if a man come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul Soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul the the the challenge that is presented in in 26 there is what is a man profited it's a good question it means that you need to if you're going to do math I mean what's profit it's what you have left over in excess after you've paid the the bills after you've counted the cost of what it takes to do business profit is what you would have left over so if you're going to to sit back and you're going to assess the situation you're going to say what does it profit me what is it really going to benefit me if I was the best Mother Teresa out there I was to build a bunch of hospitals I was to meet the needs of the people I was a good man uh you did not hunger I'm I'm quite the philosopher I I can I can encourage you in the way I can do all these things for Humanity but if the soul is left wanting and lost you've accomplished Net Zero at the end of the day it's vanity the Ecclesiastes concludes the matter to fear God because all the things are going to be found out um and nothing of man really last the Calamity of man's complete we're seeing it in this very last day we what one of the benefits we have is because of the the technology is there's really no person even what was it Elon Musk couldn't fly his jet around without someone tracking it you know so he he he he like tried to pay a kid to not track his jet it the understanding of what man can accomplish is readily available and it's all Calamity you know they're they're Landing satellites on asteroids and bringing back dust and it blows my mind what must have gone into that to accomplish that they brought back dirt from space and that's what man's consumed with they they want to beat this thing somehow and in the end it's it's all dust it's all going to be burnt right and Jesus is telling them this and yet the equation somehow is lost on people and I think that's a still the humanity of man if we could come into one mind and one Accord there's one thing that we all face we're mortal when if we can conclude if you could grasp the conclusion of the matter that there's no one that's going to come any other way that we're going to come before Jesus Christ there is no other way even those who haven't met him now on this side are going to meet him one day they're going to see who he was that he was the savior he was their Refuge he was their way of Salvation and they could have everything that he was they could have had and they'll S stand in that day knowing that they spurned the very way of Salvation now for us I don't think it's any less a a challenge for us daily to count the cost to understand what's set before us and die out daily because there's only one way of Refuge that's in his Spirit there's only one one one provided place is is is by the Holy Ghost living through you shed abroad in your life there's too many times I find that well I'll let this old nature seemingly try to press in and what's the Holy Spirit do convict your heart of sin now the this this message has so fortified us to understand our position and our calling that we know we can get back up as Sons and Daughters of God and possess our inheritance this body doesn't have rule over us it's defeated it was crucified at Calvary greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world the expectation we should have because of the victory of Calvary because of the you've counted the cost I trust each one here has counted the cost and when I when I talk about uh being in the place where you've seen that there it's a choice of life or death you've decided my life is not worth living I don't want to live my life even at my best I couldn't do anything that's of Eternal value the in my life the things I swed was hurt Strife sorrow and David McGary even at my best even if I was to esteem that I could do something really amazing which I have no natural ability to do it would be vanity I'm actually comforted in the fact that this gospel gives hope to the Hopeless I mean that's what's happening with the leopards at that gate here's the Hopeless of hopeless and who's the ones who find themselves in the place of being able to be a voice of Salvation I don't care what your position is you may think you're worthless but with the voice of God in you of what he's done for you you can be the Salvation to the most desperate people this gospel is not a one that's a respector of persons you know the the good news is is that he'll take the most vile of Sinner and One Moment In His presence he's just as good and blood-washed as the minister who's been preaching for 25 years you've got of what of value in you and you have the ability to give it you can't give what you ain't got if there's one thing that would even compel you if you were to esteem uh the value of the others in your life around you that I would say if that could compel you to ask God to give you a refilling of the Holy Spirit and to set you on fire and to allow you to be used of him that would be a good cause to do it if you feel that you've arrived and you're content in your salvation and uh you know where you're going well let's get to overflowing you know let's let's get to where you can't contain it let's get to where the joy bells are ringing and you let's you know I think back just think back of where you came from you know I I look at the grace of God for me when I was a young man I think I was around I I probably around sixth grade for those who know what age that is and I'd gone to a there was a tape meeting I believe it was in Hot Springs Arkansas and it was a somewhat of a I believe like a an a uh an annual thing where they're playing a tape inside the YMCA Center where brother brandom administered I remember it uh because as a young man I wasn't in the service the the sanctuary area where they had set up the the service to play the tape was full I was sitting out in the hallway uh in some folding chairs and towards the end of the service as the Lord was moving there was a crying just pardon me find my voice but and the Lord was moving inside the sanctuary and I remember my father coming out to me he says now be reverent that's the Lord moving in there and I don't couldn't tell you what moved on me but I found myself out in the parking lot in a in a little Astro Minivan and the prayer I prayed was Lord your God if you could be in there you could be out here too and the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ dropped down into that into that van and I knew whose presence I was in it changed me the gra of God ministered at the voice to this age that the Lord would come I didn't even know there was a presence to be felt if you've never experienced the Lord you don't even know that's right so who are you coming in contact with do they know what it's like you know the song I I tried to teach it I believe to some of the young people until you know the loving hand that reaches down to fall Fallen man and picks him up from out of sin where he's gone until you know just what it's like to know that God's really real you know nothing until you know the love of God that's what you want to come in contact with that's for everybody I've seen the Lord answer prayers to just give someone a touch to know that he's real and then this becomes a new book Faith's delivered don't let that faith not be of use what you should be able to do by knowing God's real the author of this book is standing behind it when you come in contact him it says take Hands of Faith and take God's word and stand that's the expectation what's next when you've stood on God's word watch him keep his promises he he they're Bountiful if you're hungry you'll be filled amen amen you know the the thing that you find is that the choice for us is clear every day we should be trusting in God in his provided place in his word we've been given a gift of faith to do that and we should go forward in it but what's the alternative to trust in man to trust in your reasoning to trust in your logic I think sometimes we don't even understand sometimes what we're leaning to what we're hitching our wagon to we're leaning to our own understanding we're not walking by faith we've we've come into a place of comfort there's uh there's strengths that we rely on our own understanding maybe you have the ability to figure it out um and and uh you know when you've arrived at a sound understanding of something and you lean on that but in the end of the day that's not the wedding garment that we have to be clothed in it it's not you know this the scary part is is that someone could find themselves at the table and not be dressed in the wedding garment and and my question is how could you come in all that far and find another way besides Christ Jesus CU he called him friend right I mean that what's a friend someone that knows what's going on that's how the scripture describes a friend but he wasn't dressed and the wedding garment and the wedding garment's the Holy Spirit and and I have a lengthy quote I try to to read it but um I'll say it this way there's a voice that's doing the dressing in the wedding garment and it's the same voice that delivered the faith to the disciples it's the Lord Jesus Christ it's the O bleeding bloody word and there is no other place of Refuge it's that's just not I GNA be there you could actually do so good as a as the Rich Young Ruler I think the Rich Young Ruler epitomizes the same thing that kind of happens at the wedding supper where you have someone who's done all these things and they've done them but they didn't our Pastor said something that astounded me Jesus Christ looking at the finality of the matter knew the man didn't have what it took and and so he prescribed something specific to him that that told him what he needed to do sell all thou thou Hast give it all up and follow me and the man sorrowed because he because he had great wealth but how foolish and what would the challenge be to each of us I don't know it could be your it could be hey you know I this is my comfort zone whatever that is we've been asked to die to self to give it up and seek that his presence would have the preeminence in our life and that's my desire I don't I don't want to live my day dayto day thinking that it's just uh going to be the works of these mortal hands that's accounted to me on the day that I go on but I want when I cross over there to be well done my faithful servant I want to see converts that have been W to Christ I want to know that hey when I was down you were you were the one who gave a word and it was this word right you're a carrier of life and that's the the office we have as Sons and Daughters of God the greatest privilege you have is to give the gift of eternal life that's and Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word you're the very Oracles of God lived out that's the power that you possess little Messiahs little children children of God the the stands of faith that are taking place within in this very body people taking faith in God's word and standing on it is the thing that God Delights in amen and I we want to be fellow partakers in those we want to be uh part of the soldiers that are fighting those battles I'm going to read uh I'm going to try to be quick in reading this I don't know U how long I've been but I I feel that uh if you can uh it's going to be in Revelations it's preached in 60 in December 31st chapter 4 but this is a quote um now the scene is changing John's been watching patmas and now he looks up why he sees something went on on Earth these Church ages all down seven Church ages and then after he got through seeing the church ages after that after the church ages has seen ceased he heard a voice and he looked up towards heaven and he seen an open door and the first voice sounded like a trumpet all right scen changed from patmas to heaven the voice was the same voice that walked in the seven golden candlesticks same voice The Voice didn't change but the voice where was it when he heard it the first time how many remembers the first church age behind him I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day Revelations 1 1:10 he said in the spirit if you want to put that down Revelations 1:10 and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me as a voice of a trumpet and sounded like many Waters and when I turned and looked I saw one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks now after he showed him all the mysteries of the seven golden candlesticks holding the Seven Stars and the white wig on and so forth and feet like brass and eyes like fire and the symbols and he heard the same voice watch speak from heaven and he looked up and he saw an Open Door door oh Open Door into heaven how are you how do you get in by Christ Jesus that one door one way no other way one man that climbed up the other way the same as the thief and a robber in the parable of the one who climbed up and was the wedding supper without a garment on was found guilty and bound and cast into outer Darkness only one way coming to the wedding supper I believe I preached on here not long ago whenever the bridegroom when a man got got married in the old country he had to give it imitations himself he was to finish the robes him furnish the robes himself so when he met that man there him setting at the supper how many remembers the parable sure you read the Bible and he found a man at the supper table without a wedding garment on this is all in the context of the voice and what is it the bridegroom stands at the door and all comes up with an invitation no man come into the father except by me all the father has given me or invited will come to me here they come give their invitation the bridegroom so that everybody would look alike that's one thing about the good old Holy Ghost religion it makes all of them look alike whether they're rich or poor Bond or free black or white male or female they're all one in Christ Jesus the bridegroom stood at the door and received the invitation put the robe on his fellow so the rich and the poor all look alike Hallelujah I'm thank God for a Holy Spirit that'll change your life and make you look alike you see someone who just wants to be a you know I want to be branded with this Holy Spirit I want to have the identity of this gospel I want to look like Christ wants me to look I want to have the character I want to listen to the music he wants me to listen to I want to dress the way he wants me to dress when you see people who start to have more of a worldly identity than they have an identity with Christ they don't got the Rob on that's true it don't fool yourself you may think you're going to make it in but if you somehow made it all all the way to the table you're going to get cast out it we we've got too much information we've got too much of a truth to think that there's anything less than Perfection that this gospel is requiring of us in this day it there there's a there's a baptism of a holy spirit on a false seed it doesn't bear the fruits it doesn't have a meekness a g Ness a kindness a longsuffering it it it it cares more about what man thinks you know we're just going to go there if you look in Matthew and go back to Matthew 16:2 24-26 you may know Matthew 16 because of something that transpires in it brother brandham probably quotes this quite a bit but it's found in verse 17 you can back up in in verse 15 it's it's the question he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and he said Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art th Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build the church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom and of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever shall be loosed on Earth shall be loosed in heaven we know that as brother brandham would tell us the rightful dividing of that scripture it's not that Christ is the rock it's not that the church is the rock it's not that Peter is the rock but the revelation of Jesus Christ to you as an individual is the rock Revelation is the rock on which you're built amen um and just a little later is the parable but before we get there something transpires and that who knows what the time period is then he charged the disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ from that time forth began Jesus to show unto the his disciples and to how he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and to be raised up on the third day then Peter took him the man who has a revelation the man who has the keys he's got an understanding and Jesus is telling them these things are necessary that they be fulfilled this is the way it has to be done there's a death it's not pretty um I've got to be delivered it may look like failure but it's victory and here's a man with a revelation of who Jesus Christ is admonishing the Lord far be it from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for th thou savest not the things that be of God but those things that are of men we could tell ourselves that every morning amen your worst enemy is yourself when you Savor the things of men more than the things of God you have necessity that you die you have necessity that you get behind me Satan that's the challenge that we have to daily come to no one's above it we've got to Die daily we want the victory in the camp we want Jesus Christ to have a liberty we need to come having died the death we need to come oh Lord I need you on the scene I don't want to see flesh in my brother I want to see Jesus Christ there's needs in the body there's sickness there's the need of Salvation there I'm seeing the world creeping in Lord I Want Your Presence to meet us there I want the conviction of the Holy Spirit to be so present that when people come in the back doors they notice there's an atmosphere different why these people conduct themselves different in the sanctuary there's a reverence what is it almighty God meets people there the presence of the most high is in the midst there's a people with a reverence that understand the power of God's word they don't move around when the word's being spoken and we do I'm not saying that as correction we do so what's our expectation when you fulfill all these things is that God's going to move we are the people of the promise he he he didn't do all of these things um and not think about his own his promise was that he that you know he says he who doesn't provide for his own is worse than an Infidel right he he's not going to suffer that any of you are are left hungry or weak but if you don't trust him if you're not willing to die out if you're not willing to take what may be the harder way then you're not going to get to be able to reign with him you're not going to be able to participate in the benefits the way that he's promised I don't want just a general outpouring of the Holy Spirit I want a perfecting of my character I want to reign with him I want to rule with him I want the nature that Jesus Christ had and uh this is in contending for the faith as it preached back in 55 it's just a short paragraph now then the first one to introduce the message of Faith which be our Lord Jesus Christ John just introduced the Lord Jesus and Jesus was the product of what God intended for us to contend for for he was the whole of the Christian faith laid in Jesus Christ and our faith in him now if we can only understand what kind of Faith he taught what kind of Faith he PR practiced then we would see that if the early church practiced the same thing then we should earnestly contend for that type of faith for it's the commission to us to continue hold until he comes amen let's go ahead and just stand so that musicians would come you know what's next in the path you've chosen if you're running from God if you are a son of God you should be prepared to be apprehended because he's going to seek and save those which are lost if you're if you're holding on to a promise and you're believing God then expect for that to be manifested and if your faith has received it then you're going to testify and if you're testifying then your testimony is going to multiply right so the expectation is that God's word's going to accomplish that what it's sent for that he's going to perform exactly what he promised it would perform and that regardless of the condition God's word's greater and that's the reality that we're going to contend for say just play something we'll just bow our heads and go to him gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for your promises for your word Lord It's it's only by your spirit that we could obtain these things lord it's not in of ourselves there's nothing that we've obtained but faith is a gift of you Lord unless you come and you open our eyes Lord we'll just see ourselves surrounded by an enemy we'll feel that we're outnumbered and Lord there's no hope it'll just look like death as the young Widow would say that she was going to just take a little bit of meal and take it to the pot make a bread piece pie of bread that her and her son could eat it and die yet there's a prophet standing there and in obedience to that voice Lord it was life to her and her family Lord I believe this message is your provided way Lord it ministered life to me as a Young Man Lord and you're the same yesterday today and forever lord it's not to be intellectually stimulated or puffed up father but that lives would be changed by a touch for from you Lord and you're faithful to look out over your word Lord there's needs that are represented here I think of my brother John Lord testifying to your healing touch standing before your people Lord and we know the hour of Deliverance and manifestation near Lord You're the same Lord You're the provider of every good gift that's all been paid for at Calvary it's in you Lord we want to do our part to testify to take our stand to be identified with you Lord and when we've done all the stand Lord May there be that time where you come in the power of your spirit Lord Lord dry every tear and Lord may it be a time of rejoicing in you Lord May the victory that you've provided be manifested here on Earth as it is in heaven Lord just a little while longer this this vanity of this life those things which are that are not they'll fade away and as we were meant to be we'll be there with you Lord in well bodies with sound Minds father but you told us to pray on Earth as it is in heaven Lord we ask that the temporal manifestation would be manifested father Lord sure may we may get sick again Lord but this is the victory you've purchased for your people you said that you would that we' prosper and be in good health Lord we ask that our faith would rise up oh God and Lord that you would just touch Us by your spirit may we know that your promises are for us Lord and as you would come and you would deal with each heart and we'd be found in your presence Lord may we understand that your love is not changing that it doesn't fail you're not slack concerning your promises Lord that if we could be in your divine presence at at any time if we have ever been in your presence Lord then that provided place is present now Lord we may have think that our standings changed Lord but that place was provided by the shed blood of Calvary Lord and every person that would long to have a refreshing from you Lord I ask that you would come Lord may your presence move and Lord for those who don't know you Lord lest you open their eyes there's nothing that man could do Lord but we believe by your promise you said nothing could separate us from your love Lord so whatever the hindrance would be that would keep them from knowing you Lord we ask that you'd cast it down it doesn't matter if it's principalities nor height nor depth nothing could separate us from your love father we claim that now just commit those time to you we love you father I want more of you Lord more of you and I've had it all but what I need is just more of you the things I've had my f and yet I hunger still empty and be Lord here our prayer it's for more of you Lord I want more more I want more of you bless me Lord and I've had it all but what I need is just for of you oh [Music] my and yet I hunger still empty and be Lord hear my prayer more of you amen less of me more of him that's my desire is just for him to have the preeminence that there's a power to overcome that we find in his presence that he could take the very words that you've been feeding on that you've been meditating on and by spirit in faith you could take those and win victories not only in your life but for your loved ones and he's given us a message that has provided a place of Refuge that's going to dress you just the way you need to be dressed and you're victorious in him just going to turn the service over to my brother Cosman well let's sing I don't know if we know the song um but I believe where he is there's a victory do we know that song he's in
