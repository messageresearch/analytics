heard the request that was made earlier this morning and we want to send prayers for our pastor as he gets ready to head out of town that the Lord may be with him in his travel and bring him back safe we understand it's a pressing time but we serve a great God if you have any needs on your heart and you want to make it known to the Lord by the uplifting of your hands he sees that and you you got to believe that he answers ask brother Dylan to come and take these needs and may the brothers come for the tithes and offerings yes Lord we're we're coming before you tonight bringing these needs before you the need of this family that just lost a loved one there's people in here that know what that's like and even you know what that's like Lord do whenever you were whenever you chose to wait on going back to see Lazarus you know what was going to happen but you also in order to be able to be a high priest for us you had to be able to feel that pain and to know what it's like to to deal with mortality and to deal with time to deal with the limitation of time but we know that we're going to be able to see those people on the other side Lord Jesus we know that this is only a little blip in the in the grand scheme of Eternity it's like nothing Lord it just goes by like a blink of an eye we just want to commit ourselves to you Lord Jesus so that we can so that we would be able to see those loved ones again we just lift up every single need in the place tonight all the uplifted hands and all the ones that weren't lifted all the the needs behind the hearts the needs behind the hearts of the people that are on the live stream the needs of all of your children Lord Jesus we lift them up to you we commit the rest of the service to you Lord move in a mighty way speak to us Lord we've come to hear from you tonight Lord Jesus speak to us I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] where there seems to be no way he works in ways we cannot see he will make a way for me he will be my God and hold me closely to his with love and strength for each to day he will make a [Music] way God Will Make A Way Brother D testimony and also something else to keep in mind uh brother Troy was headed out with his family to go see his dad and before he could get there and say his goodbyes his father passed away so if you could keep them in prayer as well God bless you Saints it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen um I got a long testimony but I'm going to cut it down real short um about two or three weeks ago I guess it was I I messed up my knee bad at work don't even know how I did it I guess getting old is what it is but uh I'm making made a wrong move and sure enough my knee it was so bad I mean it was it was bad I almost had to crawl to the bathroom in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom it was it was horrible so anyway I went to work and uh these painters that I work with and play golf with time to time he asked me he said I said what are you going to do man you know he don't knows I don't have no insurance I said well you know and soon as he said that thing that come to my mind was when brother brandom said he had usance and I said well you know what I said I'm going to do the one thing and I can do and I said that's claim Jesus Christ has already healed me I said because I have nowhere else to go man they kind of looked at me funny you know and I I figured they would that's fine but every day they would ask me and and for like the next couple weeks I just it was it wasn't wasn't getting any better it really wasn't and um it was killing me keep me up throughout the night and whatnot and uh so anyway every day they would ask me how's it getting and how how are you better I said man I tell you I'm Healed getting stronger every day you know deep down inside they can see me I look like a walking around you I was just anyway but you can't look to what's going down you got to look to the promise you know cuz without faith it's impossible to please God and faith is the true key to uh Miracles you know and another thing Brother David was talking about this morning that I wanted to jump out of my seat for was he was talking about his truck keys well about a month ago I guess it was I lost my truck keys and uh very important you know um shop Keys tool key all that stuff was on there anyway I have searched my house upside down my wife has to I looked in the couch up the turned the couch over looking for these things they were not nowhere to be found well yesterday before I went to went to work yesterday morning and um man KNE was still killing me my wife wanted to pray say a prayer together before I left for work I said okay I said well I my knee baby I can't kneel down so I bent over the back of the couch she stayed in front of the couch and knelt down in front of the couch so we said our prayers and during the prayer I said Lord I said I you know how badly I need my keys returned and um I can't find them and I said Lord I could have thrown them things away and they could be in the city dump right now I said but I know for a fact you can bring him right back to this house and uh so I went on to work wasn't even thinking about my knee next thing I know I'm running around work like a kid man I got my knee's not bothering me whatsoever you know oh I'm sorry me back up on the way to work devil come at me going boy you're a fool you know you really believe them keys are going to reappear you've been you searched your house upside down you know and I told him I said you stop right there and you just shut up in the name of Jesus Christ he said he's going to give them back to me and you heard me Satan I said if they're in the city he's going to bring them back to my house period Well I got home yesterday feeling great my knee was just doing doing great and I called Brother D or text Brother David yesterday and said I had a testimony to give today and that had nothing to do with the keys CU I had no idea the keys had been found yet I get home and my wife's like guess what I found and I said what's that she reaches down inside the couch that I've looked in a 100 million times and she pulls out my keys and it was right exactly where we were praying and I was out this way or been over this way she was nelt the other way so let me tell you something Saints if you have a spouse don't let the devil come between you CU he knows the power that you withhold he knows it's worse only takes two to be gathered and when that two comes together they unite a a devil in hell can stop you so Lord we just thank you for this and I just want to give him all the praise the glory and the admiration and love him more and more every day and thank you Saints for all your prayers that you've been doing for me I felt them I

lord we commit the service we ask remember our pastor be with him as he's traveling we committed service to you and ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you want I welcome everyone in the house of God Amen man I believe man everything we do we do in faith right so I have faith that the Lord will certainly give us something to say that will be helpful tonight um let's open our Bibles in uh Psalm 23 amen I'm many to enjoy the the word this morning amen I tell you that that that that Bible story is the very Foundation of what a Christian is amen Psalm 23 it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me lie in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the Shadows of death I will not fear evil for thou are with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepareth a table before me in the presence of my enemy thou anointed my head with oil my cup my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever let's also turn to um a couple of pages over Psalm uh 46 says the Lord is my refuge and my strength a very present help in trouble therefore I will not fear though the Earth be moved removed and though the mountain be carried out in the midst of the sea though the water there therefore Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with swelling thereof there is a river the stream thereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacle of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the Heathen rages raged and the kingdom were moved he uttered his voice the Earth melt melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord was uh what desolate he had made in the earth he maketh War to seize unto the end of the Earth he breakthoughs and cutteth the Spears in Thunder he burneth The Chariot in the fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge let's turn one more scripture to um Deuteronomy chapter uh 31 the 3 uh first chapter we'll read um let's start from verse one it says and Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel and he said unto them I am an 120 years old this day and I can I can no more go out and come in also the Lord had said unto me Thou shalt not go over this Jordan the Lord thy God he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and Joshua he shall go over with before thee as the Lord has said and the Lord shall go shall do unto these unto them as he did to Silo and OG Kings of amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed and the Lord shall give them up before your face and ye it says that ye may do unto them according to all the Commandment which he had commanded you be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God is with thee he that he that goeth with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen I just want to for a few minutes try not to be too long uh speak based on those words we just read I want to title it um do not fear have faith do not fear have faith so as we read these words in the Bible these will look to be uh the words of encouragement there will look to be some reassuring words that God was speaking to the children of Israel he's letting them know in advance that uh it really doesn't matter what you encounter along the way um I don't want you to be fearful and if one would speak like that I believe that you will be mindful that along the way there could have been challenges that would arise and that along life Journey we would encounter things that would try to create fear in our hearts and in our lives and there would be things that we come against us where it would look like the promises are far off that we won't be able to get it but he telling them that in the midst of all of that that along the journey one of the things that's required for a Believer is to not be fearful whatever it doesn't matter what battle you're going through tonight as we're sitting here it doesn't matter what challenge you're facing as we're sitting here the promise to the believer in God's word is that I will be with thee I will I promise that I will carry you over that I will continue to be with you that no matter what the challenges before you don't be afraid be strong be of good courage as the scripture will say it says for the Lord your God is with thee and that promise was not made just for that time and we understand I can say this that promise is attached to every verse every promise in the Bible every time you read God will say I'm the Savior I'm the Healer whatever he claims that he is when you as a believer you take that word for yourself you believe it with it you have to attach the promise that don't be afraid don't be scared to believe this stand strong because if you believe my word I will come and make my promise real to you that the presence of the Lord will be with you every single step of the way that he promised to fight your battles he promised to provide for your needs that he promised to give you victory that he promised that whatever happens that you should trust in him that he will give you what you have need of now and I'll read some things that says about fear and and the things one of the things you realize that as we read the Bible you one of the things you'll realize that that when when when when we hear the word of God is uh God is wanting us to enter into uh a mindset that's different from what this world has to offer the word of God is not given for this flesh here so we can hear come to church hear the word of God and reason it up here so we can try to understand what is God really trying to say but the word of God is given to us so so we can so it can give us introduction into the land of promise so it can give us an introduction as I like what our Pastor said this morning I just made such a statement I thought Satan is here framing up everything around us how we should always consider the situation in front of us he will put the challenge he will tell you oh for you to get a good job you got to get an education you got to get this you got to do this in order for you to obtain so we all have that understanding as humans we we know that if you you work hard you you will now it's not even working hard anymore it's the one who worked the smartest if you work smart you'll get a good job you'll do this you'll do that and and if you do this this will happen so we have that as a human understanding of what the expectation is for what we put in but God is wanting us to fly way above those things he doesn't want us that everything we hear everything we ask you know if you're sick if you go to a doctor they'll give you a prescription and if to take that prescription you'll be well and we understand that God gives the doctors the intelligence for them to do those things he wants us to believe in doctors and everything but he at the same times he makes statements that are beyond what we know as humans he will tell us that if the doctors cannot help you you have the right to go to God he will tell us if you have faith in God it doesn't matter what you're looking for God will create and he will create an opportunity for you to receive what you're looking for so he doesn't want us to just be caught up in with the the the the the circumstances how the enemy is presenting it but he's wanting us to have an ability of Faith inside of us to understand it's by faith that we please God and to utilize the faith that's inside of us to obtain the promises of God because we understand we are saved by faith we are healed by faith the promises of God are not obtained by going through the human channel the things of of God are obtained by going through the faith Channel but one of them calls it the six sense that God is placed inside of a believer that you will go by the six sense and ask and receive what God has promised so when we hear the word of God is introducing Us in the land of opportunities it's a land where all things are possible it's the land where a God is taking your inabilities your abilities your fear and whatever it is that you're facing all the challenges and everything about you God is bypassing all of those things in order to give you what you are looking for so we don't say oh I got it because I'm strong or I got it because we're regardless of whatever challenge you're facing regardless of where you are in life regardless of whatever you're facing that by faith God can raise you up Faith was given so when our our normal eyesight will end when we will look and we don't know what to do anymore when we'll look and do the calculation and don't know what to do faith is given to raise us up from The Human Side and to bring us into the kingdom of God the scripture will say that God has in his economy there's untapped resources in the kingdom of God that are made available to the Believers but for us to access those uh resources what we need is faith we don't need intelligence we don't need uh strength we don't need what we need is the channel of faith for us to access those anti resources and bring them down so therefore it's by faith that we please God and let me say this fear will not help you uh fear only is there to make sure that whatever you are fearing will come to happen and and we'll touch on some of that as the prophet will say so i i t about this story but David was reading this morning about the blind man and here he is in the circumstance that he was in and and Jesus said this The Marvelous words that he said they asked him he says well wh why is this m this person blind is it because uh H uh somebody because he sinned well he was born blind so I don't understand what did he sin before he was born or after you just have to go figure that one out so they ask is it because it did sin or is it because the parent sin and all of that and I like how Jesus answered the question and says no it was born blind for the glory that it says for the reason that everything that it may be for the glory of God and I thought if we as Believers can have that type of access or that type of understanding for every circumstances that he would we can come to the house of God or within our own lives we could be assured that if something happened to me it doesn't mean God became against me or he's for me it doesn't matter I did wrong or I did right but all of this is for one purpose that God may have the glory I thought if we can have that kind of approach it will help us a lot so we can understand that it it's it's God chose to allow things to happen he can choose to for for sickness to come upon you he will let the sickness come upon you he will let circumstance he will let what whatever it is come upon you that at the end of the day that it may be for his glory that when he will come and manifest himself it will be for his glory and not yours so we can understand as children of God I don't have to fear if I'm sick today I don't have to fear and say oh why am I sick I must have done wrong and oh I'm sick because this happened I lost my job because no that we as the children of God as the people of God can be assur that God has everything everything under his control that if he let anything happens to me is for His glory and my position and my job is to worship Him in whatever States I find myself whether I find myself in Texas today in Louisiana tomorrow I Will Worship the Lord whether I everything is going good whe everything is going whatever state whatever whether it's happiness whatever whether I have it I don't have it my focus is I want to give God the glory I want to worship him for what it don't let fear creep in and start to bring things that you did years ago oh it must have been because you did that over there because you did God knows all about it and as the children of God we know when we do wrong we go back and say Aba father and when we say the scripture tells us you are forgiven when you say that it's thr in the sea of of God forgetfulness never to be remembered anymore that I don't have to go and it up and say well because I did that even though he forgave me he still wants to punish me that's not the god that we serve but when I I ask AB father and I ask for forgiveness he forgives me and that is gone whatever happens is for His glory so God because he knows that he's working everything for our good he allows men to be born blind and let me say this he allowed that man to be born blind so Jesus can come and take away the blindness and cause the situation like we heard it this morning but it's for his glory now if we get to a place where we now attribute some things to God and some to the devil to whom do we really belong you know if we can get to a place where something good happens we attribute it to God and something bad happened oh he must be the devil well the scripture will tell us it says some Sunshine doesn't mean God is always for you is is for you or rign it doesn't mean that God is against you he loves you regardless you are his to begin with the relationship that we have with God I was thinking about this when his deciple came and asked him and says how should we pray the first word that he said come out of the mouth it says our father who's in heaven he didn't say oh come and say oh oh a great Creator or whatever no he wants you to know that the very first relationship he wants you to have with him is Son and and a father and son relationship and Father and Son relationship you can punish your son but it doesn't mean you don't love him anymore you can punish you can do whatever but at the end of the day you know it's for the good of that son for you to restore them it's not that you have rejected them it's not because you have changed or you no longer love you love them today you don't love them tomorrow but the relation ship doesn't change regardless of what the circumstance is and he wants us to be aware of that so what renam will say the let me just say this before I read it says the the the the very nature in human is born with fear passed down you know I say this my wife forgive me my wife is afraid of dogs and and and so my kids they are born with the same fear like they'll see a dog and they just Ry like and and and I like dogs I grew up I with dogs and I like and my wife has been so just afraid of dogs and she's passed that on to the kids and I'm look and I'm like these guys are just so little why are they so afraid of dogs it doesn't matter the size of the dog it's just when the dog looks at them and they you know when the dog is looking the other side they can play with them the moment he turn and looks at them they run away so you you we are born with a W with with fear as part of the nature and I want to say this this is actually connected to the very uh first disobedient to the word of God because if you go read you realize that it's after Adam's sin when God came and probably read it in a moment here when Adam came and when God came down in the Garden of Eden he said Adam Adam where are he said I hear because I was fearful now before that when you go read and you go read the message you go that there was never that was not the relationship that God established with him there there was no such thing as fear when he came to God he talked to God like his father he fellowshipped with God they talked about everything they came and fellowship the moment sin came in fear came in so so that that God don't want us to be fearful to come and say well I go to church because I'm afraid I'm going to go to hell don't do that that that's not the nature God wants us to have to serve God and say well I'm fearful if I don't serve him I'm going to be lost no that's not what God wants you to do what God wants you to do is to serve him by love God wants you to serve him because your heart wants to serve him God wants to serve him because you have a heart within you that beats because you want to see him glorified there's something in you that wants to see him glorify you he's done something for you and you want in return for people to know that God has done something for me the the approach is not for us to be fearful well if I don't serve him something bad is going to happen to me so if I don't do this this is going to happen to me that's not the kind of relationship you wants us to have so so the the first inclination what of fear is is for the reason why we have fear we will find out is because we want to self preses ourselves self-preservation oh I I don't want to do that because if I do that and everything goes wrong what am I what people are going to think about me what if I do that and I fail what if I try and then I fail you know it so you find out it's more connected to the flesh than it is to your spiritual being and and we're going to get there so now I'm realizing I'm going to be long so so so so God in his word it says that uh he's made us because he wants us to trust on him in everything and the only it says and the only way to move outside uh and the only way to move outside of this fear or or this being afraid and and this relationship of being afraid is to be born again of the spirit of God because let me say this a Christian is not one who goes and memorize the whole Bible and tries to figure out what is God said and didn't say no the a Christian is one who's been born again by the spirit of God because it's only by the spirit of God that you can serve God because if you try to serve him by the in like you will fail by the intellect the relationship will be like what I'm talking about it's by fear it's by trying to understanding it's by reasoning is by all of that but if you serve him because you have his Spirit you're going to serve him by love so faith is given to us is given to us so it can remove the fear elements is given to us so we can uh uh uh stop and understand that that it's not by Our Own Strength it's by God's strength so you cannot see uh what you cannot see by the natural faith is there to give it to you now brother bam talks about this uh uh uh uh this is in the message how can I overcome uh paragraph 92 and he says this it says now now see I said this in the beginning you are born defeated you are born defeated and and that birth can never bring you to life so by by the nature itself when we look at this we can certainly say there's no way to please God by the natural birth there's no way to be a successful Christian by the natural birth it says you are born defeated you you you are born defeated and the birth and that birth can never bring you to life because you are born defeated and it says you are in a defeated World among defeated people it says among defeated Creed defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory somewh it says now we begin to explain how we get to Victory it says it's just like a lily he says a lily I like that one of the most prettiest flower that there is he says I'm very fond I'm very fond of those great kalais and Pon Lily and I think there's nothing hardly as pretty is this big Pond Lily it says call it water lily it's radiant it says now it says where does it come from it says it's a little seed down in the mo bottom of the marck MIP Pon the little seed it says yet all the radiance that's ever will shine is in it it is right in there it says right then it says when it's when it's in the mud but but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something and let me say this that's why I said you must be born again because when you are born again something within your heart tells you that there's something out there something something within your heart tells you that there's healing out there that I can obtain there's salvation out there that I can obtain there is something in the kingdom of God that I can partake of so it's the new birth it's by the new birth that we're going to obtain that so the hearts a Believer God places the seed inside of your heart and one day you hear the word of God the word of God strikes your heart and causes Faith to begin inside of your heart and by faith you believe the word of God and you are saved by the faith that you believe you are saved by believing in what you're hearing and God comes behind it and proves it to be a reality it says it's black it's dirty it's mkey it's slimy it says in that slime time that it's living in yet it prices way through the mck through the through the mud to the mck and the waters it says and stagger it stagnant places until it sticks his head above all the light and he Express and and and it expresses what's been hid in it all this time and but whatam says this it says I think that's an overcomer he says that once in sin once did the things that was wrong don't worry about it now he says once did the things that was wrong then he says now why look back into the pond again see it says in paragraph uh 95 it says God by predestination see has brought the seed into life and he presses itself see coming to light and now on top of all of that it's an overc see it doesn't Express itself down there it gets it's getting up to express it to express itself it says now it says neither did you it says in your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in did you express nothing uh did you didn't Express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a it got a chance to press itself to the light and now you are in the presence of Jesus Christ Christ with a sunlight it says and it broughts and it brings and it broughts out of uh it broughts it brought out what you really was in the beginning see what it says what you see what I mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid out your heart open now you are a lily so so the process is that you were in sin and trespass you were in the things of the world and you were dead in sin and trespass by the hearing of the word of God by the hearing of the word of God something struck your heart you got born again and you stopped the process of the manifestation or the process of the expression of what was inside of heart and let me say this the question I want to ask tonight what if the pond L said that I'm fearful I cannot do it what if the Pond Lily said well I'm looking around all I see is the mud it's the Mark is all of this and all I see is the challenges that I'm surrounded by all I see is the impossibility for me to do what I'm supposed to do I heard the word I heard that I'm called and I heard that I can do all those things but yet I know at the same time when I look at the circumstances around me there's no way for me to get there it would have stayed right there but the process is because he heard the word of God and there was a seat inside that wanted to please God there was a seat inside that says that I'm better than what I'm seeing I'm better than what I'm looking at so it press its way through the word that he had received it press his word butam says one place that the reason why it was pricing it says because the sun was calling it The reason why it was pricing is because the sun was on the other side calling and let me say this the only reason you can press is because there's the word of God that's calling on the other side but if if fear was introduced in the process there was no way to get to the result so fear is the biggest hindrance brother bam says to the church the scripture will say in Genesis 3 And1 it says and I said I heard the voice I heard that voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself that's the very first place in the Bible that word afraid is being used to be afraid means is the feeling of fear or anxiety or frighten worry that something undesirable will occur or be done the unwilling or reluctance to do something for fear or Consequences in other word Adam was there and something within him was afraid that if he showed up before God something bad was going to happen so this is the person that he talked to every night the scriptures will tell us that God came in the cool of the evening and he fellowship with them but this one day all of the sudden God shows up he's not at the meeting point and God calls for him and he said I was afraid so it's sin that introduces fear in the hearts of men I I was thinking about I was looking for it I couldn't find it and but mam talks about the I believe it was a couple of boys that were put to be put in the death row and they were I don't know if it was in Houston or somewhere where they were about to uh to go on death row and so they called for a prayer meeting and they invited brother bam to come preach and so he he came and he he was preaching and looking about the circumstance and what was happening and so he he says he makes a statement I and and if you could find it you could put it up and and I'm pretty sure most of you know so he said if you are in circumstances like this he says that fear will not help you amen it says that yeah they are you perhaps in the situation it says all fear is going to do is make sure that whatever you're waiting for will happen but it says that faith can help you in that kind of circumstance faith will change the circumstance faith can come and and deliver you uh it's like being sick and you are afraid all you're doing is you're just accelerating the process it it's like being sick or something is happening to you and and here you are and you are all worked up and everything all you're doing is causing that fear to continue the deterioration of the circumstance it will only make it worse and worse from then on you says place that fear has no virtue in it a fear will not help you fear fear is not but when you have faith faith can get you out of bed faith can save you faith says faith knows what the will and wants of God is Faith can change the circumstance faith can take something that is not and bring it into existence faith can come and take and says one place that faith can sign your pardon he says in the message the way to Fellowship paragraph 26 it says that's the trouble with men tonight paragraph 26 that's what's the trouble with people tonight we are scared that's the biggest curse there is on the Full Gospel people or any other is CA they are afraid God has made the provision God has made the provision but you are afraid to take him to take his word for it it says if you wasn't afraid tonight why he said you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing will just go Plum away from you afraid scared it says I've noticed it and that's the reason I'm such a believer in healing it says I know that if you can get away from that scare and get love in in its place something is going to happen I like that he say he he tells you the way to Healing the way to the promises of God when when we come you know it's like if you afraid you don't even know how to ask when you afraid you you don't even know how to properly phrase your words in whatever you want to ask for why because you afraid if you know somebody's not going to give you something you're not going to have the courage to go ask him why because you are fear you're afraid of the rejection why because you afraid if I ask they're not going to give me but here he is it says what you need what we need as Believers is instead of having fear what we need to have in place is to have love replace that fear is to have love within our hearts and know that God will give it to us he continues on he says there's only two faculties that govern a human one of them is Faith which brings result and the other is fear which has no value in it at all faith is of god fear is of the devil Faith listen to this fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder and if you if you was go if you was going to die in the morning what good would he do would he do to me to get all uh uh uh uh stewed up uh uh uh stirred up stirred up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning he says my life has to end in the morning he says what would what what good would it do to me to be to worry about it it says well you say what good would would it would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon sure that's the value in faith there's value in believing when when we hear the word of God the value behind faith is to know that there is someone there is the owner of that faith that you have when you believe you don't believe the words of a man you believe the words of a living God and that God is responsible for his own word he will come and make his word a reality to you the the the value in faith is if I believe faith will change the circumstances faith will come on the scene and he will bring about things that don't exist and faith will come and you will create a way faith will make sure that at the end the word of God has come to pass in your life don't be weary it says don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe and the only way you can have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for for perfect love he says get it perfect love cast out fear amen amen in the message demonology of physical R uh par uh uh preaching 56 uh 53608 paragraph 80 but Ram says this well that's something that's the same thing that take place when a demon is cast out of a sick person it says for a few days oh I feel wonderful then begin to say I'm sicker I'm sicker than I ever was and he says I'm sicker than I ever was I've lost my healing it says just as sure as Faith took it out unbelief brings it right back I thought that is scary I just think about it you come and you get prayed for and you believe you said I'm Healed thank God and you go and and and and you feel very good and you feel and all of the sudden few days later that pain starts to come back and you said oh I don't know you know and the pain comes and he says perhaps greater than he was before and and just by you starting to say that I guess I was not heal you bringing it right back that's right if you could find it just put it out there please oh I feel wonderful then be tend to say I'm sicker than I than I ever was it says I've lost my healing just as sure as Faith took it out unbelief brings it right back again it says as Faith kills it unbelief resurrects it unbelief resurrects it Jesus said says when an unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walketh in the dry places and returns back with seven other demons and if the good if the good man of the house uh isn't standing there uh to protect the home he will come right on it and the good man of the H uh the good man of your house is your faith say stay away that's right so it that's why everything in but but there's places where he says it's the same with salvation it's the same with everything if the moment you stop confessing that you are a Believer you go right back the moment you stop confessing so this positivity or or this faith is not we have faith today and we have that tomorrow no a Believer starts by faith and end by faith a Believer is one who holds on until the end a Believer is one who confesses every single day not just for two days not just for three days in the not just in the good time not just in every time whether it be good time bad times whatever the circumstances My Confession is I've been saved and God has saved my life and I'll continue to face uh to confess that until the day I'm taken out of the earth and that's how we walk so you never get to a point where because there's not going to be a time where Satan is going to give you a way in and say well you've confessed long enough and now I can leave you alone no it's confession upon confession it's confession today confession tomorrow regardless of the challenges is the continual confession it's the continual pushing of the fear out and continually standing on the word of God continually standing upon on faith that's what skips him away you you read places the very messenger who brought us this message you will say you know even in years like 63 3 6465 you'll say you know the other day the devil was talking to me and just telling me Oh nobody loves you and look at you and all of that and and he said then I'll remember meetings like this and tell him how about that time really out of all people I mean you would think you know he you just no it's made to be a continual fight every day it's made for us to continually confess to continually walk because the moment fear creps in faith is gone out you can't have fear and faith at the same time paragraph 31 he says but now you watch a patient that's healed and or ordinar he says lest in an outstanding Miracle it says which Divine Healing and a miracle is two different things Divine Healing is one thing and a miracle is another thing but an ordinary run of divine healing when an unclean Spirit un unclean spirit is cast out a cancer devil it says when he leaves a person oh it says now and say well I I I'll take something I'll take something so you can say you can see uh more visual it says I'll say the the Cataract it says what happened when that man if you notice a blind person I don't know uh it says whether I'll ever had uh uh whether I'll ever had any here or not yet the Cataract uh eye he says I'll let them stand for a few minutes why he says so that the the the shrinkage begin to take place tell them to come it says to come back give us a testimony and it says oh my they can they can see the wonderful they can see they can see wonderful oh my just as I can h i I can see things yes it says what's the matter life is gone out the body of the Cataract is shrinking well it'll it says it'll do that it'll do that way for a couple of days and oh I'm getting so well I'm getting so well so in other word this is where we the the the process is when when when the demon is cast out it's the life that goes out first the the the what the the the the the the other elements may still the growth may still there but the the the preaching of the word of the praying for the sick is to cast out demons so when the demon has gone out the growth may still there or whatever it is but as sure as God uh the word is preached when that demon is cast out whatever else happen after that it doesn't mean the healing was not there the healing process started when the demon is cast out so it's up to you to continue to believe and the growth will take place of itself so if you look at the growth and judge the the healing by the growth then you miss a point and so if the growth gets bigger it doesn't matter if the growth swells comes down that's wonderful but the regardless of what happened after that we know that the healing process as the prophet will say in other place that that the doctor will come and he will cut you open and he will do whatever and then he will Stitch you up but the healing process it says it's God that does it because it will heal back the wound and it's the flesh that heals itself and God heals it by the pro uhhh by his word because he promised that when he will do that he will come to healing but if you focus on the fact that it's bigger it's smaller it's this way it's that way that's how you determine your healing he's saying that if you do that you'll miss it in the message God projecting his love he he doesn't want us to operate by fear and I said it earlier I think if one would try to live a Christian Life by fear you will be the most miserable person there is if one will try to serve God just because we are afraid to go to hell that's not a healthy relationship if one will try to to to to serve or to do things just because you you want to do it by law and and and and I'll say this because it seems like if we're not careful we start to judge people by the measure of the law we we look at them are they dressing right are they talking right are they talking are they talking the message terminologies are they really doing this then then no it's not by that it's the love of God shed in the heart we we we look at people and and judge them one way or the other but if the relationship is by love then you begin to understand that if there's a lacking love will take care of it if there's something missing love is powerful enough to bring the fix butam will talk and will give an example evening about himself it says in the message God love projected uh God projecting his love preaching 57086 he says paragraph 14 he says love is a powerful force it said it would run a woman and a mother right into the flame of fire after her baby if she knows she's plunging herself into death there's nothing more stronger than love love will make you trust amen you might go and know that you belong to the greatest Church in all the provinces of Canada you might know that you are a charact a a a character member of the greatest Church in the nation then you will do things that you wouldn't do if you belong to a little mission somewhere if some in some corner and had the love of God in your heart love has no fear love casts out fear and I noticed in my meetings they said so many that so many so much that when I come into the into the people and it says one of the greatest thing I find among them is fear and it says and what makes fear is the lack of confidence if if you lack confidence it will make you fear and if you if you love it castes out it cast out it Cast Away that fear and it castes it castes away it says and that's the way God wants his church not so many not so many as character member he wants member that's loyal and loves and believes and has confidence in him now remember this is the same Prophet who said that if I will serve him all my life and I get to the end and he looks at me he says hypocrite It cast me away and it kicks me down into hell it said I'll still love him because by love there's Freedom there's rejoicing there's confidence there's you know that there's no other motives behind love if if if something is done with the motive of Love behind it it will produce the result but if it's done something is done in fear When You observe it you will always see the element that there's fear in it there you always see something that doesn't seem to be right but if it's done by love all the confidence is in it paragraph 15 it says for instance my wife if it says my wife is somewhere in the meetings tonight in the audience I love her with all my heart and when I get ready to go overseas now and says and if my wife if it says and if my wife I caught her by the arm and said listen here M Mrs brandham it says while I'm gone overseas thou shall not have any more husband it says and if I ever hear uh uh of you flirting with another with another man while I'm gone woe unto you when I get back and then it says and and then if she will catch me by the by the court collar and say uh it says that's that's very well Mr brandham it says but I want you to I want you to have a little law to he says if you if I hear of you going out with another woman go unto you when you come back it says now wouldn't that be a home well that's just about the way we made God's place of dwelling a dwelling some kind of legalistic law that we have to keep what does this fear lack of trust lack of confidence lack that God is going to take care of me lack that oh if I do this if I do this God is going to punish me no God is not interested in a robot God made you a free moral agend and he saves you so you can from the bottom of your heart serve him and say I'm serving him because I'm thankful not because I'm fearful so when we get there when we praise him it has to be like a sincere praise to say that I'm just thankful there's nothing more here except I'm thankful it says what do I do when I go overseas I love my wife and as long as As I love her it says I got confidence in her it says we just got we just get down in the floor and pray together and bring our little children around us they pray God take care of daddy uh God take care of daddy uh bring him back I pray God take care of my family while I'm gone I raise up kisser goodbye and kiss the babies it says and then she said Billy I'll pray for you while you are gone it says that settles it we think no more about it it says now it says and if uh if and and if I was overseas under the law I know I'll be divorced when I get back and if I went out with some uh someone else's someone else's it says and I'll be a miserable man but if I was over there it says no matter what kind of condition I was in and I knew that I could cheat on her and came back and tell her and I knew that I could cheat on her and came back back and tell her and she would forgive me for it I still wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing no sir if I know she will say Bill I understand I forgive you I couldn't look her in the face I think that's too much for her that that's the that's the heart of a Believer that's the heart of one who love is not doing it let me say this even if you know they're going to forgive you but because of the love that fled your heart you wouldn't do it that that's how God wants us to worship him he doesn't want us be bound by fear oh if I do this I'm going to look weird if I do this Bound by boundaries and I cannot do this I no God wants us to be free he wants us to worship him he wants us to serve him when he speaks to your heart you move quickly when he says this you do it why because I don't have fear I have love love within my heart I'm not doing it because I'm afraid I'm doing it because the hearts is beating with love I love God I want to serve him I want to please him I'm doing this because of what he's done for me he could have made me an animal but he made me a human oh I think about David it said one place it said that oh I believe in Psalm somewhere he said that you can have this lips and he said you could take this body and put it in the casket it said but but if you put me there it says those lips will be shut off who's going to worship you why because David knew that what I'm alive what God has given me a breath I will use every breath that he given me to praise him he knew that this lips will praise him he knew that this body will be put at his work so one thing he knew that if I could do that God will be pleased with it yes he wasn't doing it by law it says I think I'm still in the same message it says I tell you brother when the love of God comes into the human heart now this is not the human love and the human understand when the true love of God comes into the human's heart it will drive all those things it will drive all these things it says you don't have to worry about smoking drinking running to the uh uh uh uh by bioscope and it says when the love when when the love of Christ come into your heart you wouldn't do nothing to hurt him not walking around saying uh there narrow minded and and and and they are this way they are that way just let the love of God strike you once those things those things die the whole it says your whole affle your whole affection places on Christ you got eternal life then when you it says when you believe in him when you really believe in him get married to him and die out to the things of the world God he says God God project his love and his love makes you what you are oh there's many things that you could say about it it's just going to tell it says it's going to tell my my colar down it was it says for a few minutes tell you it says my Canadian friends and some of the inside it says if you just excuse me the personal testimony I want to let you know something that something on the inside of my life that I Focus because it seems very fitting right in the in this time many people wonder what takes place it says think it's some sort of uh uh of a Mystic is it it it isn't it's love it says there the main thing is love loving Christ not just saying uh uh you do but from from the hearts of God uh from your heart love him it says you seen the devil conquer see the the wild animal flow themselves in the presence of love love castes the fear away but when I'm talks about the bull and he talks about the bees I think about the bull he talks about he said he was supposed to go and he wanted to go with his gun the thing is he forgot his gun in the process and once he saw the bull he tried to reach out for his gun and realized he didn't have it think about it and he had nothing to rely on except the love and When Love Was projected it changed the circumstance the scripture says about fear in Isaiah 41 and 10 it says fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yeah I will help thee yeah I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness in Hebrews 13 and5 if you could put that up he says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things that ye have for ye for he has said I will never leave thee never forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what men shall do unto me that's the confidence he want us to have the confidence in in his promise in what he says in what he promised in the things that he said he will do he says remember them which have ruled over you who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith followed considering the end of your uh of your salvation Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in second Timothy chapter 6 it says wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou steare up the gift of God which is in the by the putting on of my hands it says for God I like this it says in verse seven it says for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love and of sound mind so this is one thing we have as Believers when we are born again of the SP spirit of God the Bible tells us that the spirit that we have received is not the spirit of fear it's not to worship God in fear is not to approach God In Fear he wants us to have the spirit of power the spirit of love the spirit of sound mind to have the power of God within us to know that I have been born again by the spirit of God the spirit in fact it says the spirit that we have received is the spirit of adoption is is the spirit that cth ABA father and know that I'm forgiven is the spirit that gives us the confidence to know that we have access to God that we can come to God and ask what we have need of is the spirit to know that no matter what he will not leave me is the spirit to know that the power of God will be manifested in my life because I believe his word but if we approach him by fear then we wouldn't get access to what it desire for us to get access to and so this word of God as we read the scripture says I like the scripture in Ezekiel 36 and22 and it speaks and says therefore say unto the house of Israel th sayth the Lord God I do I says I do this not for your sake oh House of Israel for but for mine Holy Name sake which ye have Pro profan among the Heathen where ye went now I want you to just to think about what the word of God is saying it says uh it says and I will sanctify I will sanctify my great name which was profane Among the Hidden when ye have profaned in the midst of them and the hidden shall know that I am the Lord that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in before their eyes it says I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of the countries and bring you into your own land it says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and I shall and ye shall be clean for your uh from your filthiness and from all your Idols I will clean you it says a a new heart also also will I give you and the new spirit will I put in you I will take away your Stony heart and will give you and and out of you it says the Stony heart out of your flesh and will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and will cause you to walk in my statue and ye shall keep my judgment and to do them and ye shall dwell in the land I have given you I have given your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God so when we become a Christian as a Christian here is the testimony of the word of God to the believer I am the Lord God that does this I'm the one who brought you out of the Eden it says that when you were part of the heeden you profane my name you said all kind of things belonging to my name and you you you blashe according to my name and all those things but I will bring you out of those people and I will set you up to be a people according to my name and out of you because of my name's sake I will take the Stony out out of you I will put a new Hearts within you and I will take my spirit and put inside of you and you will obey my word that's what a Christian is I I think the challenge is when we approach God and we come in by intellect because it's by the way of Flesh the element of fear will always be there did I do right today how how much right versus wrong did I do today did I do as much right as I did wrong or if I did a lot a lot more right than I did wrong thank God let me try to do tomorrow more rights than I did wrong we don't desire that in fact when our flesh trips us we we go to our knees we said Lord I I didn't mean to do that and as we say it he already knows I know you didn't mean to do that I know you didn't mean I know your heart is pure why because I took away your Stony heart I gave you a heart of Flesh Lord I I the the scripture says that even the very spirit inced for us word that cannot be author by the mouth before we can even speak it we have a such a connection with him that before we can even speak it he knows already I know you you didn't mean to say that you didn't mean to do that I I understand that you stand up you go forward and then next day we stand and we have such a boldness and we stand why because our hearts has been made pure our spirit is not longer our spirit is his spirit in us that's causing us to live that way what Ram speaks about this woman this is in the message the 20th century prophet and I thought it was so powerful and this is in a prayer line and this this woman comes before him and he looks at her and says paragraph 18 it says excuse me sister he says you have to relax it says you have to relax my mind once in a while now you'll be a stranger I see that you are strictly a stranger to me you are from a way from uh you are from a away from here you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble in your heart and you've got a lot of trouble to begin with is that right there's a lot of Blackness he says I see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody's told a lie on you and not was if somebody's told a lie on you and not was a man was professing Divine Healing the sister says yes he said you was it says he said you was a witch yes is that true and you got the you got all stirred up you got you got the whole stirred in your church and something another about it isn't that right your pastor's sick right now he got polio is that right sister don't pay no more attention to what that man that them people say to you tell you they are a liar and the only thing that's wrong with your heart is that nervousness condition go your heart it says you got your the nervousness condition got your heart worked up go it says go home in peace and God bless you so this is a person that somebody told a lie on them and all of the sudden it messed up the entire life somebody told something that was not true about them think about it and the whole life the heart condition and things happening this left and right all of that build Upon A Lie what happened the LIE caused the fear and the fear produced the result and I thought how many of us are living lives based on lies that the devil is told us how many of us walk around oh I'm no good and I'm not this so I can never do right and I can never succeed at this all of that because of some teacher somebody somewhere looked at you and says oh you never be succeed to anything oh you never good at this you will never be good at this oh you lacked such and such and you don't have this Talent you don't have that talent and all of the sudden we frame our entire life based on what one person said or based on what two people said we take that and we build that as the foundation of our whole life that's what the word of God does it comes to break the LIE of the devil the devil calls you a sinner the word says you are a son of God the devil calls you you are no good the word of God said you were predestinated to be good the devil says you are this the word of God said that the problem is you have to stop believing the LIE am you got to come to a place where you call a lie a lie you cannot believe a lie today and try to set no it's a lie anything that the devil tells you it's a lie anything that doesn't come from the word of God is a lie if you tell me I'm no good oh I just got to Rejoice then and know because you said it that means I must be good amen oh you are a sinner praise God I must be saved why because it's not man that determines who you are it's not the devil that determines who you are it's God who determines who you are I like this the prophet now he's speaking about uh job I believe he he's talking about job and oh I love this he talks about job being in the circumstance that I'm sorry not job Jonah being in the circumstance that he was in we know that he was uh uh uh uh uh sent to go preach uh uh the the word of God and he went and he he went a different direction and we understand he was swallowed up by the the the fish and and everything but when picks it up in the message signs of the end time paragraph 132 and it says this it says now we are it says we are always it's too bad and but we we always try to think and show oh Satan showing us our symptoms he says well you see you you you are not any better than this and it was yesterday see you are no better don't look at the symptoms he says andam says this paragraph 133 says and if anybody could have a any symptom it says it would have been Jonah says he says anywhere he looked there was the be Well's belly see but you look to what he says he says there was lying vanity in other words Jonah is looking at all the symptoms and he saying that they are lying vanity he says he never said I'm going to look at this and says once more he said once more I will look to your Holy Temple he says for he knew when Solomon prayed and dedicated the temple he said that if th people be in trouble anywhere and look to this holy place and pray then hear from Heaven he W he had confidence in Solomon's Prayer a man and Earthly man like you and I and then he says and he after after a while even backslide woman drawn him away from God and then it says but he prayed H he his prayer was heard from God and he could have faith under under them circumstances now brother says this then how much more faith are we to have when we don't look to the temple by built by man but but our Heavenly but our Heavenly itself when the Son of God sits on the right hand of God of his majesty with his own blood he says ever living making interception he says there's one there's there's there's none of us it says there's none of us has that kind of symptom like that we it says we see people heal in the presence of God all the time well we should never look at the symptoms that they are lying vanity look to God it says that's what that's who made the promise so here we are and it's talking about this so it's important as we hear the word of God the fear that now he could have had fear and said that oh I'm in the Well's belly but says one place he says you know when he was swallowed as any fish when he swallowed up a person he goes all the way to the Bottom of the Sea he doesn't even stay somewhere where you could say well if I move long enough it's going to take off no he went all the way to the Bottom of the Sea and all the way he looked all he could see was the the belly of the well but he remembered that there was a promise in the Bible that God when he told Solomon that out of this Holy Temple that if anybody will pray looking at this Temple I will hear the promise and I will remember my word and I will come to them now remember he says this one place the prophet said now this is a backsliding prophet praying the prayer of one who was a king who backslid it but God was obligated to hear because it was according to the promise that he made but yet we all Sons and Daughters of God we praying looking to Calvary which is a finished work that God has done a work that can never be changed but if we have fear we wouldn't do that you could have looked and say well I might as well give up I'm going to die this is the end of me and just lay there and wait till they die but he had faith that if I could only pray that God will hear the prayer because when the temple was dedicated God made a promise that if you will look to that Temple Holy Temple and pray that God will hear and I want to say this today this tonight let's not look at the symptoms let's not look at fear let's look at the promise that God has made us when we look at the promise we shall live when we look at the symptoms we will create fear we shall die if the musician could come butam says in the message the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 111 see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection but when your mind closes it itself to those things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out I said that's what I want I want my mind to close itself to everything and only allow the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it no we know that's true I said that's what I want tonight Lord let's all stand father I want want to shut off every time I hear the word and I see all the mountains of evidence of of what I cannot do and of fear of oh of fear of failure fear of this and fear of that and fear I I see all of that I say okay but I'm going to believe right now and let the spirit of the word come in and I'm going to shut off and let the word of God produce the result of what he promised it would do why because he's a faithful God what he said he will do he will do it why because as we read the the scripture he said that though I walk in the valley of shadow of death I will not fear thou are with me though whatever though the Earth be moved though the mountains be thrown in the sea I will stand I will not fear why because if I walk by fear I might as well forget it it will not produce anything it will only lead me astray but if I walk by faith if I stand in in love and faith it will produce what God promise it will produce our gracious father we're so thankful Lord and father we want to just commit ourselves to you Lord and father as Believers of your word Lord God one thing we want to do is to operate by faith and not by fear Lord Lord when we go home when we go to work and on our daily lives Lord every time and father we are in campus such about a lot of things and the devil always trying to shake us up and circumstances and this will happen that will happen this will happen but Lord in all of that we want to stand firm and not be afraid we want to stand before and say that our God will rescue us we want to stand and say that we've believed the word and only the word of God is going to come to pass Lord we want to stand and cast The Fear away and let faith in and know that it will produce the result we saw thankful Lord and we pray tonight father that if there be any tonight and I lift my hands and that's been operating by fear Lord forgive us fill our hearts with your faith and your love father come tonight and the love that can create Faith let it fill our hearts tonight Lord and that we may know that we are in the palm of your hand and nothing can take us out that we may know that if we
