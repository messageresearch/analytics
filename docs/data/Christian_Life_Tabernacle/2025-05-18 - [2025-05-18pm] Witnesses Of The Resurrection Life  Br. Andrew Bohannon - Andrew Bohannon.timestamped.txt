[21:51] Heavenly Father, how we thank you, Lord,
[21:54] just to know that we have someone we can
[21:56] rely on, someone that has been proven
[21:59] over the ages not to change, not to
[22:01] fail. And Lord, our confidence stands
[22:04] sure in your word again tonight. And we
[22:06] can come boldly before the throne of
[22:08] grace with our needs, not fearing
[22:11] because your prophet taught us to ask,
[22:12] oh God, and ask abundantly. There's a
[22:15] sister in Mexico, a sister of camp. Oh
[22:18] God, she needs your hand to touch her
[22:20] body, Lord. You are the same yesterday,
[22:23] today, and forever. So may you remember
[22:25] her need, oh God. And may we hear
[22:27] testimony soon of your greatness once

[22:32] mighty conqueror. Our brother Jose's
[22:35] wife, Lord, is going for an incision, a
[22:38] procedure, Lord, at the end of the
[22:39] month. We know that Lord, you're the one
[22:41] that guides him in the hands of the
[22:43] doctors. Oh God, may you do it again.
[22:45] And Lord, we even hear one more
[22:48] testimony for the goodness of your name
[22:50] and assist life. Lord, we thank you for
[22:52] each prayer request that was not even
[22:54] mentioned that is in the hearts of your
[22:56] people. May you, oh God, remember each
[22:59] and everyone. We thank you for this
[23:01] wonderful opportunity to be able to come
[23:03] nigh unto thee, oh God, for your
[23:05] wonderful name. We praise and be adored.

[38:16] [Music]
[38:18] Lord, my heart's

[38:29] fire. My purpose is to worship you.
[38:41] Say your
[38:44] words up my
[38:49] soul to
[38:55] worship to be a
[39:00] praise to your throne.

[39:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. You happy to be
[40:01] in the house of God? Amen. I'm so
[40:03] thankful he's not in a grave, but he's
[40:05] risen and he's alive. Praise God. Amen.
[40:09] Amen. Well, we're just so happy to be
[40:11] here tonight with the promise that where
[40:14] two or three are gathered in my name,
[40:17] I'll be in the midst of them. Amen. If
[40:19] if you have a need on your heart and you
[40:22] want to just in this moment just commit
[40:25] it to the Lord and say, would you pray
[40:27] for me that God would give me revelation
[40:29] that would meet my need? because there's
[40:31] nothing more important and it cannot be
[40:33] overemphasized the need for revelation.
[40:36] You pray for me and I'll pray for you
[40:38] and let's let God have his way in this
[40:40] service tonight. Let's pray together.
[40:41] Heavenly Father, you see, oh God, our
[40:43] heart, Lord, you know our need, Lord.
[40:46] And Lord, we're asking, God, as Lord, as
[40:49] your children, Lord, you even said in
[40:52] your word, Lord, that a father, Lord,
[40:54] just asking for bread, oh God, you
[40:57] wouldn't give them a stone or you if
[40:59] they asked for substance, Lord, you
[41:01] wouldn't give them a serpent. Lord, even
[41:02] even now, Lord, we need revelation,
[41:05] Lord. I commit your people to your
[41:06] hands, Lord. We pray your blessings upon
[41:09] them, Lord. Will you open the word to
[41:11] their heart, Lord? And may your spirit
[41:13] come and deal with their hearts that our
[41:15] lives, oh God, can be shaped and molded,
[41:18] Lord, to the very image of the sons and
[41:20] daughters of God. Father, we're asking,
[41:22] God, for mercy, Lord, we pray that the
[41:25] blood would atone and cleanse, oh God,
[41:28] of all unrighteousness and sin. Father,
[41:31] be the guest of honor, Lord. have your
[41:33] liberty and way with every heart. As we
[41:36] want to yield our heart to you now for
[41:38] the glory of God, we ask these things in
[41:40] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. We're
[41:44] so thankful to be able to be here and
[41:47] stand before you and brag on our Lord
[41:49] Jesus because he's the only one worthy
[41:51] of the works that he's done in our
[41:53] lives. Amen. Well, if you have your
[41:55] Bible and while you're standing, if you
[41:57] want to turn with me, we just probably
[41:59] take a few moments and just see as the
[42:01] Lord leads um just maybe a little
[42:04] thought about witnesses of the
[42:06] resurrection life. Amen. And so, we just
[42:09] want to go straight to the word of God
[42:10] in the book of
[42:12] Acts, chapter 1. Amen. Acts, chapter 1.
[42:17] And just try to follow in behind what
[42:19] the pastor said this morning. And I just
[42:21] it's hard sometimes to follow such a
[42:24] wonderful message, but we just do our
[42:26] best to to stay in line with what the
[42:28] spirit's speaking to the churches. Amen.
[42:30] In Acts chapter 1 and verse one says
[42:34] this, "The former treatise have I made,
[42:37] oh theopoulos, of all that Jesus began
[42:40] both to do and to teach until the day in
[42:45] which he was taken
[42:46] up after that through the Holy Ghost had
[42:50] given commandments unto the apostles
[42:53] whom he had chosen." Notice how the
[42:55] leadership changed. And when he was
[42:58] risen, now it was through the Holy Ghost
[43:01] until now you notice that he says, "To
[43:04] whom also he had showed himself alive
[43:07] after his passion by many infallible
[43:10] proofs, being seen of them 40 days."
[43:13] Think of it. After he had risen, he
[43:16] stayed there with them 40 days.
[43:19] Praise God. Oh my. Just think of it.
[43:23] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[43:25] the kingdom of God. And being assembled
[43:28] together with them com and commanded
[43:30] them that they should not depart from
[43:33] Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of
[43:35] the Father, which he saith, Ye have
[43:38] heard of me. For John truly baptized
[43:42] with water, but ye shall be baptized
[43:44] with the Holy Ghost, not many days
[43:46] hence. When they therefore were come
[43:50] together, they asked of him, saying,
[43:52] Lord, will at that uh will at will thou
[43:56] at this time restore unto the kingdom to
[43:59] Israel? And he said unto them, "It is
[44:02] not for you to know the times or the
[44:05] seasons which the Father had put in his
[44:07] own
[44:08] power, but ye shall receive power after
[44:12] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you,
[44:14] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[44:17] in Jerusalem and in Judea and to the in
[44:20] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[44:23] the earth." Amen. You may have your
[44:25] seats. We trust the Lord will add a
[44:27] blessing to the reading of his word.
[44:39] And all right, thank you for that. Make
[44:42] me kind of nervous when the things
[44:43] popping. I'm already nervous. You just
[44:45] pray for me. And Amen. So, we just
[44:48] wanted to maybe speak a little bit about
[44:51] witnesses. You know, a witness is
[44:53] somebody who's heard something or seen
[44:55] something. You know, you can't be really
[44:56] a certified witness in the law or in the
[44:59] court or any kind of setting unless
[45:01] you've heard something or seen
[45:03] something. And when they had seen the
[45:06] Lord speak to them and then they were
[45:08] told and in obedience, they wanted to
[45:10] meet together there in the upper room.
[45:12] He said, now they might have felt a lot
[45:14] of zeal to go on out, but he told them,
[45:16] he said, "But you wait until you're
[45:18] endued with power." Amen. And that was
[45:20] the thing because they were running from
[45:22] the governmental powers because they
[45:23] crucified their Lord. But oh my, just
[45:26] think when that resurrection life came
[45:28] and made themselves known, what a
[45:30] different people they were. And I just
[45:32] think about the scripture that says, and
[45:34] maybe we'll read it also, but it's in
[45:36] Isaiah, I believe it's chapter 27.
[45:40] Isaiah
[45:41] 27. and then we probably won't be long,
[45:44] but we'll just read a quote or two and
[45:48] just see what the Lord has for us. I'm
[45:50] excited. Amen.
[45:53] But it says there
[45:55] in
[45:57] Isaiah chapter
[46:00] 27 in verse one it says in that day the
[46:03] Lord with his swore and great and strong
[46:07] sword shall punish the labyrinth the
[46:10] piercing serpent even the lav the
[46:13] crooked serpent and he shall slay the
[46:16] dragon that is in the sea in the day in
[46:19] that day sing unto her a vineyard of red
[46:24] wine. I the Lord do keep it, and I will
[46:28] water it every moment, lest any heard
[46:30] it, and I will keep it day and night.
[46:33] Amen. I just so think that that's part
[46:35] of what was being spoken this morning.
[46:38] You know, God had planted something
[46:39] within us. Amen. And that seed wasn't
[46:42] just when you made a decision. Actually,
[46:44] that seed was planted there before the
[46:46] foundation of the world. Amen. That was
[46:48] the eternal thought of God that was
[46:51] planted there. And but it was by the
[46:53] Holy Spirit promise that would come by
[46:56] your way. It would come by my way in a
[46:59] certain season of life. And oh, it was
[47:01] the pressure of the age. It was the
[47:03] pressure of circumstance. There was
[47:05] something vibrating on the inside
[47:08] calling out for the resurrection.
[47:10] Something that would be different. There
[47:12] was a longing in our hearts. There was
[47:15] there was a craving of that we could
[47:18] never attain to. I remember thinking
[47:20] back and oh I when God began to deal
[47:23] with my heart and I was just um you know
[47:26] I was so hungry for something different
[47:28] and you know I turned left and to the
[47:30] right and nothing satisfied and I
[47:33] remember someone told me you know why
[47:35] don't you read this book and I began to
[47:37] say well really so I started reading
[47:39] this book on the sermon on the mount and
[47:42] oh I just the Lord just began to deal
[47:44] with my heart this must be the way
[47:46] because you know this is the thing I I I
[47:49] don't understand how some people can can
[47:51] even doubt their own prayer. I just
[47:53] remember God, I was sitting under that
[47:55] tree in my the front of my house just
[47:58] pleading to God. He said I said, "God, I
[48:01] know I'm not right, but if you're going
[48:03] to judge me according to this word, God,
[48:06] I need you to reveal it to me." There
[48:08] was some deep desire that says, "There's
[48:12] something to this book. There's
[48:14] something on the inside that is
[48:16] magnetized to this book, but I couldn't
[48:19] see it the way I needed to see it. I
[48:21] needed the eyes of my heart to be open.
[48:24] But don't you love it how God puts a
[48:26] desire in your heart, and you realize
[48:28] it's going to take God to move on my
[48:30] heart. It's going to take God to quicken
[48:32] what's what's the reality on the inside.
[48:35] I can't I can't make sense of it in my
[48:38] mind. Amen. But I believe that there's
[48:41] something on the inside that can
[48:43] magnetize to this and then there's a
[48:46] there's a life that's going to
[48:47] resurrect. Amen. And I know that you've
[48:49] seen it in your life. And just as a as a
[48:54] witness, I just want to say that I
[48:56] believe that's how God deals with sons
[48:57] and daughters. You know, we we're not
[49:00] born, you know, uh 13, 14 years old.
[49:05] We're born infants. We have to drink
[49:07] milk. And you know, you you don't start
[49:10] walking first, you know, uh with a big
[49:13] head, you start working, even you
[49:15] falling over forward, you know, but God,
[49:17] he's kind of let you talk and crawl and,
[49:20] you know, kick on your back a little bit
[49:22] and cry and fuss, you know, but then
[49:24] over a little time, then you can start
[49:26] doing a little bit of a Well, some of
[49:27] them do like this scooch backwards
[49:29] before they actually do the army crawl.
[49:31] And that's how we are sometimes as
[49:33] babes. We're desiring the sincere
[49:35] miracle of the word, man. we really want
[49:37] to run. It's like son wait there's a
[49:40] preparation to be made. Amen. Amen. And
[49:43] and this is a process you know when you
[49:45] realize that there is a call of the word
[49:48] of God inside there's something to say
[49:50] I'm just going to trust God because it's
[49:53] not me. All my good intentions and all
[49:55] my good efforts always brought it to not
[49:59] I was always a failure when I tried to
[50:01] do right. There was evil there. I
[50:05] remember I just went and I was like,
[50:08] "Okay, you know, I'm going to, you know,
[50:10] go, my friend invited me to church, so I
[50:12] I'm going to go to church." And so we
[50:14] went to church with him and his wife and
[50:16] boy, they were good people. You know, I
[50:18] love good people. You know, they want to
[50:19] direct you the right way. But really, it
[50:21] takes the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[50:23] And you know I prayed God you know lead
[50:26] me you know and and in the process of
[50:29] time when God led me to this message and
[50:31] then you can hear the narratives of the
[50:33] naysayers and different ones but you
[50:36] don't think that I go back to the place
[50:38] and say you know what God from the
[50:39] depths of my heart you lead me to truth
[50:42] you know and and I could say a lot of
[50:45] things but when God said I will lead you
[50:48] and guide you into all truth and
[50:50] righteousness well that'll harmonize
[50:52] with the word of God. Amen. I mean, many
[50:55] times people get excited and they have a
[50:58] great gift and they can, you know, see
[51:00] into the future and all kinds of things,
[51:02] but if it doesn't harmonize with the
[51:04] revealed word of the hour, just put it
[51:06] to the
[51:07] side. This is the leadership for this
[51:09] day. Amen. But the struggle, the
[51:13] struggle is the carnal mind is that
[51:15] enmity with God. And we have to battle
[51:18] against that thing because it wants to
[51:20] raise up. It's going, "Hey, you know
[51:22] what? It's reasonable. I mean, you this
[51:24] person's successful in business. You
[51:26] know, you could just sacrifice and you
[51:28] know, miss church a few times and you
[51:30] know what? Let your career take off. You
[51:33] know, then you'll really be brother, I
[51:35] tell you, there's times where I got to
[51:37] thinking stuff like that. I might pay
[51:39] off my house. And what good is a house
[51:42] that's paid off if the Lord's going to
[51:43] take us in a rapture? I mean, hey, if
[51:46] you can pay off your house and that's,
[51:48] you know, gives you comfort, well, okay,
[51:50] that's fine. But let's not substitute
[51:52] the leadership of the Holy Ghost. You
[51:56] know, we get led into these different
[51:58] things where we're pulled into carnal
[52:00] reactions and carnal thinking.
[52:03] My I'm going nowhere where I thought I'd
[52:08] go. Let me slow down for a minute here.
[52:11] I just loved it how, you know, brother
[52:14] Dave was taking that message out of the
[52:16] Easter Seal and, you know, in Matthew
[52:19] 28, the scripture was talking about
[52:22] where, you know, Martha and Mary, they
[52:24] were at the tomb. And when he
[52:26] resurrected, he went and told him, he
[52:27] said, "Go on to Galilee." You know, I'm
[52:29] going to meet you there. You know, that
[52:32] same God is is wanting to meet you where
[52:34] you're at in your circumstance of life.
[52:38] You know, you might be facing it seemed
[52:40] insurmountable. Hey, they crucified him.
[52:43] He was embombed. He was there days and
[52:45] we were going but oh with that great
[52:48] earthquake. Sometimes that's how the
[52:50] trauma is and the battle. It's like a
[52:52] great earthquake. Something's shaking
[52:54] you. It's like wait a minute. I got to
[52:57] get right. So there's something shaking.
[52:59] This world's falling apart. We can't put
[53:02] no trust and confidence in the systems
[53:04] of this world. They've rejected God. Now
[53:08] it's up to us as individuals to take
[53:11] this word and let it live. There's a
[53:14] life of resurrection trying to burst
[53:16] forth.
[53:18] Oh man, we need to get into the light of
[53:21] God. It's an individual affair. But my
[53:24] when we do the faithful thing by going
[53:27] daily praying, reading, when we come
[53:30] together, oh, you don't know how much
[53:33] the influence of you being in shakina
[53:35] glory can cause somebody to just break
[53:38] loose. Amen. Say, God, there's a
[53:41] presence around me. There's a presence
[53:43] here. There's liberty in the house of
[53:46] God. Amen. Don't you love that? To be in
[53:50] the presence of the Lord and recognize
[53:52] it. Yeah. Amen. We want to recognize
[53:55] God. Recognize it's God that's doing the
[53:58] calling. It's God saying, "You know
[54:00] what? I'm not going to leave you in that
[54:02] condition. My love is chasing after you.
[54:06] I will do everything to win you and pull
[54:09] you back into my fold. You're mine.
[54:12] You're not going to be lost. Matter of
[54:15] fact, I secured you by putting your name
[54:17] on the lamb's book of life before the
[54:19] foundation of the world where the lamb
[54:21] was slain then." Amen. Glory.
[54:25] My
[54:28] my
[54:29] Well, in the Easter Seal, just picking
[54:33] up where the prophet said this in ' 64,
[54:36] he says, "As Jesus was born the son of
[54:39] God to be
[54:40] Emanuel, God's full expression in man,
[54:44] that's right. He found him in perfect
[54:48] obedience down at the River Jordan,
[54:51] being baptized by that prophet. And as
[54:55] soon as he obeyed him, he walked out of
[54:58] the water and the heavens opened to John
[55:01] and he saw the Holy Ghost
[55:03] descending from heaven, saying, "This is
[55:06] my beloved son." See, perfect obedience.
[55:11] The spirit had sought him out in
[55:14] obedience. My I think that's what pulled
[55:16] you to church tonight. The spirit, you
[55:19] know, it speaks expressingly that at the
[55:22] end time that people will be without
[55:24] natural affections. There will be truce
[55:26] breakers in continent and despisers of
[55:29] those who want to do right, who want to
[55:32] assemble themselves to to worship God
[55:34] and to praise the only one worthy of
[55:37] giving everything for.
[55:39] But you're here, Amen. in obedience
[55:42] because it was the spirit of God picking
[55:44] you up and dragging you there.
[55:48] Praise God. You know, and the more you
[55:51] you allow God to do it and then you find
[55:53] yourself, oh, I'm so I mean, I can't
[55:55] contain these blessings, the more you
[55:57] just yield to it and you find yourself
[56:00] starting to get a little skip in your
[56:02] step. You're like, man, every time I do
[56:04] what God wants me to do, I'm freer and
[56:06] freer. One day I'm going to be so free.
[56:08] I'm going to take off out of here. Yeah,
[56:11] that's the desire of my heart. Be so
[56:13] light from the things of the world that
[56:15] one day I'm going to be gone. I'm going
[56:18] to Oh, it's going to be in a moment, in
[56:20] a twinkling of an eye. Amen.
[56:24] Oh
[56:25] my. Oh, weward man or woman this morning
[56:31] when we're sitting here, there's
[56:32] something in you telling you that it is
[56:35] right. It's the Holy Spirit seeking you
[56:38] out to bring you to the knowledge of the
[56:40] truth of this hour that we're now living
[56:43] in. Not some other hour that's gone by,
[56:46] but the hour now. You know, I just think
[56:49] about the believers that were living in
[56:50] the day of the prophecy that Isaiah
[56:53] spoke. Behold, a virgin shall conceive.
[56:55] You know, and people, they got so
[56:57] religious that they made the word of God
[56:59] of none effect by their traditions. They
[57:02] got so bound down with the way the
[57:04] normal way of doing church, the way the
[57:07] the normal rituals of the family culture
[57:10] and different things, it so displeased
[57:12] God that it became a stench in his nose.
[57:14] But then when God brought the
[57:16] manifestation of the Messiah, the virgin
[57:18] born lamb of God, there was some people
[57:21] still stuck trying to bring a lamb and
[57:24] shed in the But you know what? Once the
[57:26] the manifestation of Jesus Christ, born
[57:29] of a virgin, was on display, that old
[57:31] was done away
[57:32] with, you couldn't come and be accepted
[57:35] by God trying to offer an animal
[57:38] sacrifice.
[57:41] And I'll say this, you know, if people
[57:44] tried to live a Christian life without
[57:46] this message, Malachi 4, they're living
[57:49] on the light of another day. That's a
[57:52] mirage. This is the only light that will
[57:55] give you shalom for a great body change.
[58:00] There is no going back. That is
[58:02] dedicarian.
[58:04] We have lifted past the tongue age.
[58:07] We're in the eagle age. We can see
[58:09] beyond all of the world's system. It's
[58:12] heading toward an ecumenical council and
[58:15] a a great destruction.
[58:17] But praise God, before one bomb, one
[58:20] fire falls, I'm going to be changed in a
[58:23] moment. That's my That's the goal.
[58:25] That's what I'm looking for. Amen. I
[58:27] know it's
[58:29] yours. Amen. Boy, what a promise of this
[58:33] hour.
[58:38] Amen. Well, I got to thinking it was
[58:40] Wednesday. And I'm not used to taking
[58:42] Sunday night, but oh, I'm so happy to be
[58:44] here representing the King of Kings and
[58:46] the Lord of Lords, the one who made my
[58:49] Oh, I I tell you, I was so bound. I
[58:51] There was no hope for me. I remember I
[58:54] was so shackled. I couldn't even see a
[58:56] light of hope. But one day, that
[59:00] something on the inside says there's
[59:01] hope. I said, "Wait, what? My condition?
[59:05] No way." But oh that reasoning mind
[59:08] battling badly saying there's no way
[59:11] you're not a son of God. You're not a
[59:14] daughter of God. But something on the
[59:16] inside says I'm not going to take that.
[59:20] I can't explain
[59:21] it. But I just couldn't settle for that
[59:25] nonsense. Boy, but it still battles.
[59:28] Amen. It still tries to raise its head.
[59:30] And we must defeat the Lord the the
[59:33] enemy by the word of the Lord. Amen. By
[59:36] thus sayaeth the
[59:37] Lord. Amen. And there was thousands
[59:41] there that had obey obeying that hour
[59:44] past. But there was a present hour
[59:46] truth. There was a present hour. That
[59:49] was the hour that Jesus was to appear.
[59:52] And he stood the word. And there stood
[59:54] the word. There stood the people. And
[59:59] here was the manifestation of
[1:00:03] God taking place to vindicate. That was
[1:00:07] the truth. And as Pentecostal people
[1:00:11] today, let me say this that we're
[1:00:14] standing in the last days where God
[1:00:18] promised he would pour out his spirit
[1:00:20] upon all flesh and his sons and
[1:00:23] daughters shall prophesy. For he had
[1:00:25] said, "These signs shall follow them
[1:00:27] that
[1:00:29] believe in the hour." What? That's what
[1:00:33] makes that creation in you. Oh, do you
[1:00:36] realize there's a creation in you? Amen.
[1:00:39] Do you realize it's because of the word
[1:00:41] that was spoken in this day that causes
[1:00:44] a creation in you? That's right.
[1:00:47] You know, I tell you, when brother
[1:00:49] Brandham came, he says, "Good evening,
[1:00:52] friends."
[1:00:53] You don't know how much of a creation
[1:00:55] that that saltiness of the love of
[1:00:58] Christ on display creates a thirst. I'm
[1:01:02] so hungry for this life that I've seen
[1:01:04] on display. And that's what you become
[1:01:08] when you receive this word. When you
[1:01:10] yield to it, you become that to the
[1:01:12] world. You become the create. You are a
[1:01:15] creator.
[1:01:17] You create thirst in other people's
[1:01:19] lives.
[1:01:21] They look at you, there's something
[1:01:23] about I can't explain it. Like I could
[1:01:25] see that they're different. There's
[1:01:27] something that's drawing in an
[1:01:28] attraction. There's a billboard, but now
[1:01:31] I'm getting
[1:01:32] thirsty. Oh, but you're a witness of the
[1:01:35] resurrection life. I love that so much.
[1:01:38] You know, I used to witness a lot of
[1:01:40] things that didn't bring forth any life.
[1:01:43] It actually brought death. But today,
[1:01:45] I'm here to tell you, by his grace,
[1:01:47] we're witnesses of the resurrection
[1:01:49] life. Aren't you happy about that? It's
[1:01:52] something to be excited about. We have a
[1:01:54] hope of eternal life because what's
[1:01:57] resurrected and risen in us. That's
[1:02:00] right. Praise God.
[1:02:04] Well, we might just close here in a
[1:02:06] little bit. I don't know. I um sometimes
[1:02:09] I feel bad like we're taking too long,
[1:02:11] but you know, where are we going to go?
[1:02:14] you know, uh, you know, the word can
[1:02:16] wait. I mean, I don't know. I just, if
[1:02:20] the Lord can just give me one more, I
[1:02:22] just I want one just once more, Lord.
[1:02:24] Speak to my heart. Amen. You know, I'm
[1:02:27] not here because I have something to
[1:02:29] say. I'm here because of the call of
[1:02:31] God. Because God's word has called us to
[1:02:34] assemble together. Just like the prophet
[1:02:36] said, I I'm standing here because it was
[1:02:38] the call of God. You're sitting there
[1:02:40] because of the call of God. God is here
[1:02:43] to give us instructions in his word
[1:02:46] because there's something around the
[1:02:48] corner and we need instructions for the
[1:02:50] next step. Yes, sir. There's something
[1:02:52] that I don't know about but I haven't
[1:02:54] been there but the but the guide knows
[1:02:57] how to get us through and that's what we
[1:02:59] need. We need leadership today. Amen. I
[1:03:03] don't know how to turn the corner but
[1:03:04] I'm just going to bump along as we go.
[1:03:07] Here we go.
[1:03:09] You know, I was listening to the
[1:03:11] rejected king and there was a few quotes
[1:03:13] that stood out to me this week
[1:03:16] and I want to share it with you because
[1:03:18] I believe it'll be a blessing and it'll
[1:03:20] help with the instruction because we
[1:03:22] want to have the fellowship. You know,
[1:03:24] we have the mind of Christ. That's
[1:03:26] right. You know, we also have a mind
[1:03:28] that is carnal and those two are at war
[1:03:32] against one another so that you would
[1:03:34] subject to one or the other. This is the
[1:03:37] day of choosing.
[1:03:38] choose you this day whom you will serve.
[1:03:42] And so the battle is on. Okay. Now,
[1:03:45] every day you can fall back to that old
[1:03:48] nature and that old way of thinking, but
[1:03:51] God wants us to renew our mind day by
[1:03:53] day. If you didn't feed on the word
[1:03:56] today, do it anyway. Just don't look
[1:04:00] back. Look forward. Amen. We want to
[1:04:03] press in like never before. It's worth
[1:04:06] it. Amen. Amen. But brother Brandham
[1:04:08] said this and and he was speaking out of
[1:04:11] um Samuel chapter 8. I'll just read this
[1:04:14] just to kind of maybe lay a little bit
[1:04:17] and maybe we'll take maybe 20 or 30
[1:04:19] minutes. It's only been 25 minutes. So
[1:04:22] everybody feeling okay? Yes, sir. Praise
[1:04:24] the Lord. So in in in Samuel chapter 8,
[1:04:27] I believe it's 1st Samuel chapter 8, and
[1:04:31] I think this is
[1:04:32] um it's it's a wonderful marvelous
[1:04:35] story.
[1:04:36] in the rejected king. Brother Brand
[1:04:38] said, "Why don't you take the time and
[1:04:39] just read it all the way through?" and
[1:04:42] uh it's like a two-hour service, but um
[1:04:46] you know, I think there's a lot of good
[1:04:48] nuggets not only in this chapter, but
[1:04:52] also in that message, but in Romans or
[1:04:57] excuse me, in 1st Samuel chapter 8, it
[1:05:00] says this, and we'll just start right
[1:05:02] there in paragraph, I believe,
[1:05:09] uh let's do
[1:05:12] 5 and said unto him, Behold, thou art
[1:05:16] old, and thy sons walk not in thy
[1:05:19] ways. Now make us a king to judge us
[1:05:24] like all the
[1:05:25] nations. But the thing displeased
[1:05:28] Samuel, when they said, Give us a king
[1:05:31] to judge us. And Samuel prayed to the
[1:05:34] Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel,
[1:05:37] "Hearken unto the voice of the people in
[1:05:40] all that they say unto thee, for they
[1:05:44] have not rejected thee, but they have
[1:05:46] rejected me, that I should not reign
[1:05:49] over them, according to all the works
[1:05:51] which they have done since the day that
[1:05:53] I had brought them out of Egypt, even
[1:05:56] unto this day, wherewith they have
[1:05:59] forsaken me, and served other gods. So
[1:06:02] do they also unto thee. Now therefore
[1:06:06] hearken unto their voice. How be it yet
[1:06:09] protest solemnly unto them and show them
[1:06:12] the manner of king that shall reign over
[1:06:15] them. And Samuel told all the words of
[1:06:18] the Lord unto the people and asked of
[1:06:21] him a
[1:06:23] king. And I'll just stop right there. in
[1:06:26] that message, and I'm just going to skip
[1:06:28] around a little bit, but in that
[1:06:30] message, this is one of the things that
[1:06:32] just stuck out to me. And paragraph 91,
[1:06:35] he says, "Now, that's the way the enemy
[1:06:38] tries to do is to pluck out both eyes if
[1:06:43] he can so that people can't see what
[1:06:46] they're
[1:06:47] doing." You know, can you imagine trying
[1:06:50] to do your job without
[1:06:52] sight? Now, this is what the prophet is
[1:06:54] telling us. What the devil's trying to
[1:06:56] do to you. He's trying to do to me. He's
[1:06:59] trying to pluck out your sight so you
[1:07:01] don't know what you're doing.
[1:07:04] So, if you want to recognize the devil
[1:07:06] and what he's trying to do, okay, you
[1:07:09] want to arm up against your enemy. Okay?
[1:07:12] So, if what he's trying to do is to
[1:07:14] pluck out our both eyes, let's pay
[1:07:17] attention to what the prophet is
[1:07:20] instructing us. He says that's what
[1:07:22] Satan tries to do today to every
[1:07:24] Christian. Well, we're all included in
[1:07:26] that. Amen. He says, "Pluck out our
[1:07:29] spiritual sight that he can only follow
[1:07:32] the intellectual sense of things, not
[1:07:35] the sense of the Holy Spirit leading
[1:07:37] him." You know, uh that's that's a great
[1:07:40] sobriety to me. And and you know,
[1:07:43] anytime the Lord speaks through the
[1:07:45] prophet or or any way that I can go back
[1:07:47] to the message of the hour and he's
[1:07:49] dealing with me individually, it sets a
[1:07:51] sobriety to do inventory. You know,
[1:07:54] conviction is a good thing. Ain't that
[1:07:56] right, brother Matt? Conviction is a
[1:07:58] blessing. You know, a lot of times we
[1:08:00] don't understand conviction, but that's
[1:08:02] part of the leadership. Son, you can't
[1:08:04] get where we're going with that in your
[1:08:06] life. Sisters, you can't be wearing
[1:08:08] those high heels and walk that road. You
[1:08:11] see, God's got a perfect way. That's
[1:08:14] right. It's a way of holiness.
[1:08:19] And you can't walk that way with those
[1:08:21] things. And so, conviction brings us
[1:08:24] subject to the word of God.
[1:08:27] Amen. Excuse me.
[1:08:31] So
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:32] then when they did
[1:08:37] that, I'm I'm going to pause there and
[1:08:39] just say that, you know, it's it's it's
[1:08:41] profound to me how it's so important,
[1:08:45] you know, that we receive that
[1:08:48] leadership, that same leadership that
[1:08:51] tugged on your heart and said, you know,
[1:08:54] this is not me. I I remember going to
[1:08:57] the church for four years over there,
[1:08:59] the big mega church, and a friend
[1:09:01] invited me, but you know, I just it it
[1:09:04] ne I never really had victory over sin
[1:09:06] in my life. I wanted to do right, but
[1:09:09] there was just nothing behind it to
[1:09:11] really
[1:09:14] overcome, but oh my, you know, God knows
[1:09:17] how to build. He knows how to work
[1:09:19] things out because I had to let go of
[1:09:21] some things. Right. See, he was allowing
[1:09:24] the fow ground to be broken before the
[1:09:27] seed came. This, you know, the good
[1:09:29] sewing of the message, but I had to be
[1:09:32] willing to let go of a lot of things
[1:09:34] that I held on trying to bring from
[1:09:37] another hour. You know, truths that I
[1:09:40] accepted, saying, you know, this is true
[1:09:42] and this is true. These are principles
[1:09:44] in my life that I held is true and
[1:09:47] different things. But attached to all of
[1:09:49] those things were a lot of little subtle
[1:09:51] falsehoods.
[1:09:53] But I kept trying to pull those in. And
[1:09:55] then I began to get real sincere with
[1:09:57] God. I said, "God, if there's anything
[1:10:01] that's contrary to your word in my life,
[1:10:03] if there's any hypocrisy or untruth in
[1:10:06] my life, Lord, burn it out, Lord. Just
[1:10:08] take it out, please. And let the pure
[1:10:11] seed word drop into my heart because I
[1:10:14] I'm not going to be satisfied with
[1:10:15] manifesting anything less than the light
[1:10:18] of the day." Amen. And that's the seed,
[1:10:21] the eagle cry. Come up high here. Amen.
[1:10:25] Oh. And so when we heard the eagle
[1:10:27] scream, mama, that's me. Amen. Don't you
[1:10:31] love the Lord? Amen.
[1:10:34] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. We, you
[1:10:37] know, we think about these things and
[1:10:39] I'll just say it like the prophet did
[1:10:41] and and he said this in paragraph 40. He
[1:10:44] says or 41. He says it is it was a time
[1:10:48] that as it is in all times that people
[1:10:51] never wanted God to lead them. Now this
[1:10:55] is a blanket statement on all humanity.
[1:10:57] You know so you might say whoa whoa whoa
[1:10:59] whoa. I want God to lead. Well your
[1:11:01] nature doesn't want God to lead. They
[1:11:04] wanted their own way of
[1:11:07] leadership. And this story this morning
[1:11:10] when you go home you it's good to read
[1:11:12] the whole thing through. And during that
[1:11:15] time, the days of Samuel, the man of
[1:11:17] God, the prophet, he had been a just
[1:11:21] man, a good man, honorable, reputable,
[1:11:23] true, honest with the people, never
[1:11:26] deceiving them, telling them nothing but
[1:11:28] thus sayeth the Lord. I we've had that
[1:11:30] in this day. We've had a great prophet
[1:11:33] that's come and gave us thus sayeth the
[1:11:34] Lord. He was true, honest, reputable,
[1:11:37] all of these things, never deceiving.
[1:11:39] But the people came to a place where
[1:11:41] they wanted to change this
[1:11:44] program. They had looked upon the
[1:11:46] Philistines, the Amalocites, the
[1:11:48] Amorites, the Habites, and the other
[1:11:50] nations of the world, and they had seen
[1:11:52] that they had kings that ruled over them
[1:11:55] and governed them and guided them and
[1:11:57] fought their battles and so forth. And
[1:12:00] this seemed to be what Israel wanted to
[1:12:02] pattern themselves like these kings and
[1:12:05] like these people. Oh, what a subtle
[1:12:08] devil.
[1:12:10] to try to put in our subconscious
[1:12:11] leadership of man.
[1:12:14] My but it's never been in any age God's
[1:12:18] intention for his people to act like the
[1:12:20] people of the world or to be governed or
[1:12:23] controlled like the people of the world.
[1:12:25] God's people as always has been a
[1:12:29] peculiar people, a different people
[1:12:32] called out, separated and altogether
[1:12:35] different in their actions, in their
[1:12:37] ways, in their manner of living. And
[1:12:41] that's what the people of the world has,
[1:12:44] their appetites for things and all their
[1:12:46] makeup is. And it's always contrary to
[1:12:49] the things that the people of the world
[1:12:52] desire. Amen. You're a different type of
[1:12:55] you're a different class of people.
[1:12:57] That's right. You know, there's people
[1:12:59] that, you know, they can go and they can
[1:13:02] read the Bible and they can look at it
[1:13:05] and they say, "Jesus Christ, he's my
[1:13:07] savior. He died for me." And and we
[1:13:10] believe that, but there's more to it.
[1:13:14] He's not only savior, but he's Lord.
[1:13:16] He's a great king. You know, he's worthy
[1:13:20] to be praised and honored. You know, we
[1:13:23] can't truly serve him and worship him
[1:13:25] like truly without revelation because
[1:13:28] he's not a trinity. You know, we can't
[1:13:30] worship God as a trinity because he's
[1:13:32] one
[1:13:36] God.
[1:13:41] Amen. Now, the people of Israel came to
[1:13:45] Samuel. He says, "Now you're getting old
[1:13:47] and your sons are not walking in your
[1:13:49] ways." because they wasn't true like
[1:13:53] Samuel. They were robbers and takers of
[1:13:57] money. And they said, "Samuel, your boys
[1:13:59] are not like you. So, we want to go out
[1:14:02] and find us a king and anoint him and
[1:14:05] make us a people like the rest of the
[1:14:07] world." See, Samuel tried to tell him
[1:14:10] that that will not work. If you do that,
[1:14:12] the first thing you know, you'll find
[1:14:14] out that you're call on your they'll
[1:14:17] call your sonsh from your home and make
[1:14:19] them soldiers out on them and run before
[1:14:23] the chariots and bear arms and spears.
[1:14:25] Not only that, they'll call your
[1:14:28] daughters to make bread and and to be
[1:14:30] bakers of bread and and and take them
[1:14:33] away and to feed the army. And besides
[1:14:35] that, they'll take certain taxes off of
[1:14:37] you of your grain and all your income.
[1:14:40] He'll tax you of all that to make a
[1:14:42] certain government debts and so forth
[1:14:45] that will have to be paid. See I I think
[1:14:49] you are altogether making a
[1:14:52] mistake. My you look at the world
[1:14:55] system can't you see what exactly Samuel
[1:14:58] he was pleading as a prophet don't go
[1:15:01] that way.
[1:15:05] You know, we're in the world, but we're
[1:15:07] not of the world. And the devil tries to
[1:15:10] trick us into making commitments with
[1:15:13] worldly things that it's we we just are
[1:15:16] shackling ourselves up. We're getting
[1:15:19] into this system where we're bound to
[1:15:20] the things of this world.
[1:15:23] But I want to shake myself and break
[1:15:25] free. Where we're headed, you don't have
[1:15:28] to worry about a mortgage. Matter of
[1:15:30] fact, you don't even have to worry about
[1:15:31] a home. He says, "I've gone to prepare a
[1:15:33] place for you. We're not going to be
[1:15:35] traveling in no fort or expedition or
[1:15:39] whatever. We're going to have a new
[1:15:41] body." Amen. I'm so grateful for
[1:15:44] that. Says, "The people said, but still
[1:15:48] they wanted to be like the rest of the
[1:15:51] people. There is something about a man
[1:15:53] or a woman that they long to be like one
[1:15:56] another." Oh my goodness. I mean, this
[1:15:58] is laying right here in the word of God.
[1:16:00] You know, there's something about men
[1:16:02] and women. They want to be like the
[1:16:04] other men and women. You know, why do
[1:16:06] they why do they have American Idol? Why
[1:16:09] do they have uh Touchdown and he does
[1:16:13] his dance and all that kind of stuff?
[1:16:14] Because people want to be like that.
[1:16:16] Well, that guy didn't start out doing
[1:16:18] that. He saw Michael Jordan and these
[1:16:20] other people and like I want to be like
[1:16:22] Mike. I want to
[1:16:23] be Excuse me. Maybe I shouldn't say all
[1:16:26] the
[1:16:32] He
[1:16:36] says, he says, "And there's there's only
[1:16:39] one man that ever lived on earth that is
[1:16:42] our example. And that one that died for
[1:16:44] us all, our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ. He was the perfect example of
[1:16:49] what we should be and always about the
[1:16:51] Father's business, doing that which was
[1:16:54] right." My, that's our example. No
[1:16:57] matter how much that Samuel tried to
[1:16:59] persuade the people, continually they
[1:17:01] went after him night and day, they
[1:17:04] wanted a king. We want a man. We want a
[1:17:07] man that will say, "This is our guide."
[1:17:10] Oh, hasn't it happened today? We want
[1:17:13] this pope to be our guide. We want this
[1:17:16] president to be our guide. We want this
[1:17:19] man or this woman. Come on. Ah, but
[1:17:22] praise God, he's just over there with
[1:17:25] dirty feets. And you know, I just I'm
[1:17:28] just waiting. I'll wait here. You know,
[1:17:31] I just I'm looking for a little service
[1:17:34] and then he'll just speak a word of
[1:17:36] leadership. It's a it's a time of the
[1:17:39] personal life of Christ. Amen. He's
[1:17:41] coming in and he's giving us hunger to
[1:17:44] be led because we're created to be led.
[1:17:48] We're like sheep. We've all gone astray.
[1:17:51] We have followed after the ways of man.
[1:17:54] Amen. But praise God, there's something
[1:17:57] in us, a seed of life that says, "Lord,
[1:17:59] I'm wrong. You're right. Lead me in the
[1:18:02] way of path of righteousness for thy
[1:18:04] great name's sake." Amen.
[1:18:07] And that has never been the will of God.
[1:18:11] It never was the will of God, nor ever
[1:18:14] will be the will of God for a man to
[1:18:17] rule over another. That's right. God
[1:18:20] rules over man. God is the ruler. our
[1:18:24] king.
[1:18:26] And it's the very very much of apparel
[1:18:28] today because that man seems to have the
[1:18:32] same idea. They didn't seem to be able
[1:18:35] to grasp that God still rules man
[1:18:39] instead of man ruling
[1:18:41] man. Ain't that right? Oh, I love the
[1:18:44] word of God. It's eternal. It's for
[1:18:46] every day, every age, every time, every
[1:18:49] person.
[1:18:52] So they choose themselves a man named
[1:18:55] Saul which was the son of Kish. And he
[1:18:57] was a reputable man, honorable man, but
[1:19:00] he suited the people just right because
[1:19:02] he was a great, tall, noble stature of a
[1:19:05] man. Scripture says he was head and
[1:19:07] shoulders above any man in Israel. He
[1:19:10] was kindly looking. He was a handsome in
[1:19:12] his face. He was brilliant and an
[1:19:15] extraordinary man. Now that's the kind
[1:19:18] of man that the people want to choose
[1:19:19] today.
[1:19:21] The people does not seem to be satisfied
[1:19:23] with the way that God placed his church
[1:19:26] to be governed and controlled by the
[1:19:28] Holy Spirit. That's what somebody, some
[1:19:31] man, some denomination, some certain
[1:19:33] people govern the church that they are
[1:19:36] not able to throw themselves completely
[1:19:38] into the hands of God to be spiritual to
[1:19:42] be led by the spirit. They wanted
[1:19:44] somebody to do their religion for them.
[1:19:48] somebody to tell them just how to do it,
[1:19:52] all about it. Well, that's our nature.
[1:19:56] But we each one have to dig down. We
[1:19:59] have to go to digging. We have to go to
[1:20:02] digging. We have to dig out. Dig out
[1:20:05] more of Andrew Bohan. Dig out more of
[1:20:08] you. Dig out. Dig. Because the rain's
[1:20:11] coming. I'll pour out my spirit upon all
[1:20:14] flesh. We got to get to digging. Amen. I
[1:20:18] I've been leading the show. I've been
[1:20:20] running the show too long. Lord, I want
[1:20:23] you to lead me, God.
[1:20:31] Amen.
[1:20:38] So this man seemed to be suited the
[1:20:41] exact the place exactly because he was a
[1:20:45] very intellectual man and that's a whole
[1:20:48] lot like
[1:20:49] today. We like to choose such people too
[1:20:53] to control the our churches to control
[1:20:56] the churches the church of God. Nothing
[1:20:58] that I have to say against it is just
[1:21:02] merely making a point. It is not. It is
[1:21:05] not and it will never be the will of God
[1:21:09] for such to be. God is to rule his
[1:21:11] people to govern each individual. Well,
[1:21:15] I believe that's part of our
[1:21:16] responsibility to let God govern and
[1:21:19] rule over our individual lives. Because
[1:21:21] if we're prayed up and we're feeding and
[1:21:23] feasting, you know what? There's
[1:21:25] something not in order in the house of
[1:21:27] God. Your prayer and your subjection to
[1:21:30] the word of God is contributing to the
[1:21:32] God that's making it all orderly in your
[1:21:35] life. He'll bring it all orderly. Just
[1:21:38] do your part. Don't worry about trying
[1:21:40] to fix it with your intellect because
[1:21:43] we'll make a big mess of it. How many
[1:21:45] can testify? We make messes. But praise
[1:21:47] God, the grace of God, he'll just take
[1:21:49] it and he'll just make it all work for
[1:21:51] good. Praise God. We love the Lord. Now,
[1:21:55] in 69, it says this. He says, "But man
[1:21:58] wants to rule." I I think this is these
[1:22:01] are three things that if we can
[1:22:03] recognize this is part of what we're
[1:22:06] fighting, right? This was part of
[1:22:09] ingrained into our humanity. But he
[1:22:11] says, "Man wants to rule. Huh? I want to
[1:22:13] be the ruler of my life. I want to
[1:22:15] dictate. I want to lead. I want to do I
[1:22:17] want to present all of the what's coming
[1:22:19] at me. I want to have the certain
[1:22:21] outcome. I want to have the rule." And
[1:22:23] what's going to be the outcome? like I
[1:22:26] want to be able to dictate whether I get
[1:22:28] that or do that or do this or do that,
[1:22:31] right? I I thank God the testimony of
[1:22:34] our brother John, he he said, "Yeah, I'm
[1:22:36] willing to go out there to the job, but
[1:22:37] in his heart, he wanted to be in the
[1:22:39] household of God, but God at the end of
[1:22:41] the day, he said, you know what? I'm
[1:22:43] going to be the one that rules over this
[1:22:45] situation." And he waited on God. He He
[1:22:47] said, "I'll be willing to do it."
[1:22:49] Sometimes we just got to be willing to
[1:22:51] let go and let God, hey, I made a wreck
[1:22:53] of things. I I've gone this way and I
[1:22:55] thought I was going to orchestrate it
[1:22:57] this way. But praise God, you can work
[1:22:59] it all for good if I'll just give my
[1:23:01] lead the leadership to you. My position
[1:23:05] is a
[1:23:06] follower. Forgive me,
[1:23:08] Lord. Man wants to rule man and rule
[1:23:12] over man. Oh my. Think about Cain. Boy,
[1:23:16] you know that Cain nature trying to
[1:23:18] raise up and rule over somebody else.
[1:23:21] You're going to come subject to me. I'm
[1:23:23] the boss around here. You know, that's
[1:23:25] where us as parents, we got to watch
[1:23:27] out. You know, we can't be too iron fist
[1:23:29] with certain things. I'm going to rule
[1:23:31] you. I'm going to bring you subject to
[1:23:34] my will. Oh, we can bruise the child of
[1:23:37] God. You know, God has little angels
[1:23:39] watching out for those kids. And you can
[1:23:41] get in trouble with God if you go to
[1:23:43] spanking them too hard and with the
[1:23:45] wrong motive. You know, you can put a
[1:23:47] lion spirit on that kid.
[1:23:50] He'd be like, "So you you you're so
[1:23:52] harsh with me. I'd rather tell you
[1:23:54] something that ain't the truth so that I
[1:23:57] don't get beat
[1:23:58] down." Oh my, what a sobriety. We want
[1:24:02] to have the love of God. God didn't do
[1:24:04] us like that. God with nail scarred
[1:24:07] hands and love came and pulsated on our
[1:24:10] heart the love of God. I forgive you,
[1:24:12] son. You know what? I don't see you in
[1:24:15] that condition. Come up higher, son.
[1:24:18] Come up higher.
[1:24:19] Oh my. To think that man wants to rule
[1:24:22] over man and man wants to rule over
[1:24:26] him. He doesn't want to have God rule.
[1:24:31] Oh, that's another thing. Our nature
[1:24:34] doesn't want God to
[1:24:37] rule. My I mean, let's just get honest.
[1:24:40] Like if if we could just relax and say,
[1:24:42] you know what? In my nature, I don't
[1:24:44] want God to rule, but I'm going to
[1:24:45] subject myself. I'm going to be like a
[1:24:47] lamb and I'm going to say, "Lord, here I
[1:24:49] am. Shear me off. Shear me off, Lord. If
[1:24:53] you want me to do thus and thus, if you
[1:24:54] want me to, I Lord, I want to be your
[1:24:57] yielded vessel that you can reflect the
[1:25:01] resurrection life in me." I know that
[1:25:03] it's the desire of your heart. It's the
[1:25:05] desire of mine. Amen. And that's God
[1:25:10] calling. Praise God.
[1:25:14] My do you love the Lord? You know, if
[1:25:18] you don't know that you love him, I want
[1:25:20] you to know that he loves you. Thank
[1:25:21] you, Lord. You know, that's the thing
[1:25:24] that's calling is the love of God. You
[1:25:26] know, I God's
[1:25:29] call, the love of God so desires that
[1:25:33] not only you be a partaker of
[1:25:36] redemption, but that your life in the
[1:25:39] position and in the hand of God yielded,
[1:25:42] you actually play a part in
[1:25:46] redemption. You being a yielded vessel,
[1:25:50] now you go and witness to the world and
[1:25:52] you have the ability because you have
[1:25:54] life. You have the resurrection and
[1:25:57] life. What you say God will come behind
[1:26:00] it. Whatever you bind on earth will be
[1:26:02] bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on
[1:26:05] earth shall be loosed in heaven. Is it
[1:26:08] easier to open the eyes of the blind or
[1:26:10] to say, "Thy sins be forgiven." Think of
[1:26:13] it. God has entrusted you with a sacred
[1:26:17] trust.
[1:26:24] My well, we're just winding down now,
[1:26:26] trying to find a place to
[1:26:29] close. Now, it says this in 70. So, the
[1:26:33] sons of Kish, Saul by the name, was just
[1:26:36] the answer to what they wanted. The
[1:26:39] great stately man. Oh, he could just
[1:26:42] lead them to battle and so forth. But
[1:26:44] still, it wasn't God's way of doing. God
[1:26:47] wanted his faithful old prophet to
[1:26:49] direct them to speak his word to them.
[1:26:52] Amen. And today in our great church we
[1:26:56] live in, we think, I believe this with
[1:26:59] all my heart that we have exactly done
[1:27:03] vice versa from what God ordained us to
[1:27:06] do. The words of our savior says in Mark
[1:27:09] 16 says, "Go ye into all the world and
[1:27:12] preach the gospel to every creature. He
[1:27:15] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:27:17] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:27:19] damned. And these signs shall follow
[1:27:21] them that believe. In my name they shall
[1:27:23] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[1:27:26] new tongues. They shall lay hand they
[1:27:28] shall take up serpents and drink deadly
[1:27:31] things and it would not harm them. If
[1:27:34] they lay hands on the sick, they shall
[1:27:38] recover. There is not a man. There is no
[1:27:41] son of kish or no one else can produce
[1:27:46] the outside of the leadership of the
[1:27:48] holy spirit but we have made schools and
[1:27:52] had seminaries and made organizations to
[1:27:54] satisfy to look like the rest of the
[1:27:57] world. Now the Holy Spirit uses the
[1:28:00] leadership the leader for the nation and
[1:28:02] I'll just try to close with this thought
[1:28:04] but I think it's so profound and and we
[1:28:07] can see the fall of our nation but you
[1:28:09] know in the beginning you know our
[1:28:12] nation they fled from the persecution of
[1:28:14] the mother harlot. They they were
[1:28:17] protesting that all of the things that
[1:28:19] they made creeds and dogmas and and it
[1:28:22] was ritualistic and organized religion
[1:28:24] and if you don't bow they were going to
[1:28:26] break you. And so, but there was a
[1:28:28] people that they they had something on
[1:28:30] the inside that says, "I can't settle. I
[1:28:32] don't believe in, you know, uh, penance
[1:28:34] and the confession booth. I don't
[1:28:37] believe in, you know, the
[1:28:39] the I forget indulgences and all those
[1:28:42] kind of things, you know, and it's just
[1:28:44] like, wait a minute. We're we're looking
[1:28:45] for a promised land. We're looking to be
[1:28:49] partakers of something that that's on
[1:28:51] the deep desire. We don't want to just
[1:28:53] go to church. We don't want to just have
[1:28:57] our regular life, individual regular
[1:29:00] life. We want to be a part of something.
[1:29:03] God put it in you to be a part of a
[1:29:05] body.
[1:29:08] You know, we're we're not out living our
[1:29:10] own individual lives. We are connected.
[1:29:14] It's not because I'm saying it. It's
[1:29:16] because God did it. God placed the same
[1:29:19] thing in you that's a receiver.
[1:29:22] So he send out the scream and there's
[1:29:25] something on the inside that responds to
[1:29:27] the call. Amen. Do you want to respond
[1:29:29] to the call today and say God send me
[1:29:32] just like Isaiah he says here am I send
[1:29:35] me. Amen. My but you think about it they
[1:29:38] used to have a seat in when the our
[1:29:42] founding fathers came here for freedom
[1:29:43] of religion. They wanted to worship God
[1:29:46] according to the dictates of their own
[1:29:47] conscience. They didn't want to be ruled
[1:29:49] by man. They didn't want to rule by
[1:29:51] government. They wanted God to be their
[1:29:54] guide. They wanted God to be the one
[1:29:56] that they were under. It was in God we
[1:29:59] trust under God. All of these things
[1:30:01] were the very foundation of this nation.
[1:30:05] And they even before you know they
[1:30:07] signed the Declaration of Independence,
[1:30:09] they were all around and they left a
[1:30:12] chair there and it was empty and they
[1:30:13] said that God was that seat was for God.
[1:30:16] And you know when they were going to to
[1:30:19] conduct uh business over the nations and
[1:30:23] things they would have
[1:30:25] prayer my and to think if if we're going
[1:30:29] to get anything done we need to go to
[1:30:32] prayer we need to invite God we need to
[1:30:36] pull up an empty chair and say God come
[1:30:39] into this situation invite him in and
[1:30:42] say God I cannot resolve this without
[1:30:45] prayer without your leadership, without
[1:30:47] your counsel, without your wisdom.
[1:30:51] Oh
[1:30:53] my. When they wrote up the Declaration
[1:30:55] of Independence, there was an extra
[1:30:58] chair sitting there. And there's not one
[1:31:02] speck of doubt in my mind that the son
[1:31:04] of God sat at the table. when this
[1:31:06] nation was founded on the principles of
[1:31:09] freedom of religion and freedom to all
[1:31:12] upon the basis of God's eternal word.
[1:31:15] But we have corrupted that through
[1:31:17] politics, voting men in there under
[1:31:21] buying and selling and promises of
[1:31:23] falsehood until our nation and our
[1:31:26] politics and our democracy is so
[1:31:28] polluted until it's interwoven with
[1:31:31] communism and all kinds of isms.
[1:31:35] It's exactly what he said. It's exactly
[1:31:38] the way it is. And many times when we
[1:31:42] call into our assemblies for prayers,
[1:31:44] when the when the League of Nations
[1:31:47] meetings to have discussion in one
[1:31:50] certain great time recently, they was
[1:31:53] not even one time called for prayer. How
[1:31:57] are we ever going to settle differences
[1:31:59] without prayer? How can we ever expect
[1:32:03] in all the world to ever do anything
[1:32:06] without the leadership of the Holy
[1:32:09] Spirit? Oh, I think it's so important
[1:32:11] for that individual love affair with the
[1:32:15] leadership of the Holy Ghost. You know,
[1:32:18] that was part of the promise is that
[1:32:20] when he the Holy Ghost comes, he will
[1:32:24] lead you and guide you. You know, he's
[1:32:27] not going to lead you into destruction.
[1:32:29] He's going to leave you lead you
[1:32:31] directly into the resurrection and life.
[1:32:35] Amen.
[1:32:37] My you know and I'll just say this
[1:32:41] trying to close
[1:32:42] but this is found in in paragraph 88. He
[1:32:47] says just as soon as a man gets some
[1:32:50] kind of great doctor of divinity or
[1:32:52] great some thing behind his name he
[1:32:56] becomes more or less a knowit all.
[1:32:59] my you know that's that's where you know
[1:33:02] hey getting an education you know you
[1:33:05] can get a a bachelor's a master's or you
[1:33:08] can go through seminary all that stuff
[1:33:10] but don't never let that get you to
[1:33:13] chasing after something other than the
[1:33:15] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:18] you know my brother Brandham said in one
[1:33:21] place they try to teach God can you
[1:33:24] imagine you get to a place where you so
[1:33:26] led by man's thinking and intellectual
[1:33:28] ual understandings that you think you're
[1:33:30] teaching God. My But that's what we have
[1:33:33] to fight against. Man, God's men are
[1:33:36] humble men. Amen. God's people are
[1:33:40] humble people. When you see someone
[1:33:42] who's saying that they've received the
[1:33:44] Holy Spirit and begin to separate
[1:33:46] themselves, seemingly not having the
[1:33:48] faith, going about trying to to be
[1:33:52] something that they're not, just
[1:33:55] remember, they haven't received the Lord
[1:33:58] Jesus.
[1:34:02] You know, the scripture says as you see
[1:34:04] that day approaching, you gather
[1:34:06] yourself the more and and you you know,
[1:34:08] you recognize that some people they're
[1:34:10] saying that they're of Christ and things
[1:34:12] like that, but they're out they're just
[1:34:14] not assembling themselves. You know, one
[1:34:16] of the things that I believe that is
[1:34:19] part of the the cry of the seed is that
[1:34:22] I'm got to be connected with the body.
[1:34:25] you know, I have a a responsibility to
[1:34:28] you and you have a responsibility to me.
[1:34:31] It's not because I've been given a gift
[1:34:33] of faith or or ministry or calling or
[1:34:35] anything. It's because we're sons and
[1:34:37] daughters of God. I can't make it with
[1:34:39] you without you and you can't make it
[1:34:41] without me. So, we got to work together.
[1:34:44] We got to call upon the name of the Lord
[1:34:46] in prayer. Ask that we would speak to
[1:34:49] one another with love and
[1:34:51] grace, you know, charity. Amen.
[1:34:56] my but just think about this as he's and
[1:34:58] I'll try to wind down with this um but
[1:35:01] the deception of the world and what's
[1:35:04] coming is and I think about Saul and I
[1:35:07] think about how you know the the nation
[1:35:10] today it's like this great call back you
[1:35:13] know let's get God back you know and and
[1:35:16] as a nation you know you'll find that
[1:35:18] they they're going to start pulling in
[1:35:20] and it looks like maybe they'll even you
[1:35:22] know bring back prayer or they might
[1:35:24] bring back. Hey, let's bring back the
[1:35:26] ten commandment. Okay, but this is
[1:35:28] something so profound to me. He says now
[1:35:31] in 90, it says when we find out that the
[1:35:35] enemy sets in, he's going to come into a
[1:35:39] little bunch of God's people and was
[1:35:42] going to pluck out the right eye of
[1:35:45] every man. That's what the enemy tries
[1:35:47] to do is pluck out both eyes if he can
[1:35:50] so that people cannot see what they're
[1:35:52] doing. That's what Satan is trying to do
[1:35:54] today to every Christian. Pluck out his
[1:35:57] spiritual sight that he can only follow
[1:36:00] the intellectual sense of things and not
[1:36:03] the sense of the Holy Spirit leading
[1:36:05] him. So then when they did that, when
[1:36:10] that great defeat came, when Saul cut up
[1:36:13] the two great ox and sent them out to
[1:36:17] all the people, I wish I had I would
[1:36:19] notice. I I wish you would notice here
[1:36:23] when Saul sent the pieces of the ox to
[1:36:26] all Israel, he said, "Let every man that
[1:36:30] will not follow Samuel and Saul, let him
[1:36:34] this ox be as
[1:36:36] this." Do you see how deceitful he tries
[1:36:40] to res represent himself with the man of
[1:36:44] God?
[1:36:47] Maybe I'll read that and and and you can
[1:36:49] catch it because he's going to say it
[1:36:50] again. How uncchristian it was. The fear
[1:36:53] of the people was because of
[1:36:56] Samuel. See, the fear of of the people
[1:37:00] in your life is not because of your
[1:37:03] intellect. It's because of the seed of
[1:37:05] God that has been germinated by this
[1:37:07] message.
[1:37:09] That resurrection is in you because
[1:37:11] you've heard the eagle
[1:37:13] scream, right?
[1:37:16] because of
[1:37:17] Samuel. But Saul got them to follow him
[1:37:21] because that the people feared Samuel.
[1:37:24] Let them come after Samuel and
[1:37:28] Saul. And many times today we have heard
[1:37:32] it. We are the great church. We are the
[1:37:35] great church of Christ. We are the great
[1:37:37] church of God. We are the so and so. We
[1:37:41] make the people get a a fear and think
[1:37:44] that we're really in where God is
[1:37:46] working and that don't and they don't
[1:37:50] want the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:51] They'd rather follow men like that
[1:37:53] because they like to live their own
[1:37:57] individual
[1:37:59] lives. They like to believe what they
[1:38:02] want to believe, you know. And I just
[1:38:04] say that's a trap of the
[1:38:06] enemy, you know.
[1:38:09] I I just thought that was so profound,
[1:38:11] you know, and and you know, we don't
[1:38:13] want to be like, you know, pitchfork
[1:38:15] Christians and say, "Wow, that's for the
[1:38:17] world." But
[1:38:20] that's God's dealing with my heart. like
[1:38:23] okay so you're saying thi this is the
[1:38:26] way it is that we by nature we want to
[1:38:30] live our own individual
[1:38:32] lives you
[1:38:35] know and we like to believe what we want
[1:38:39] to believe but I believe there's a
[1:38:41] potential in every seed of God to
[1:38:44] believe the word of God and cut loose of
[1:38:46] every other thing amen we'll have the
[1:38:49] musicians
[1:38:52] Um well I thank God for his
[1:38:58] word. You know you have the potentials.
[1:39:00] I I was fellowshipping with a brother
[1:39:02] some time ago and you know you you know
[1:39:07] you if it wasn't for the seed of
[1:39:10] God you you wouldn't be able to believe
[1:39:13] this
[1:39:14] like cuz my intellect humanity
[1:39:18] intellect you cannot figure out
[1:39:21] God has
[1:39:23] to search you out he's the one that
[1:39:28] comes and shines the light on the word
[1:39:30] of God that it's the seed of God in you
[1:39:34] that he's drawing. Amen. Why don't we
[1:39:37] stand?
[1:39:40] He says this in 98. The Holy Spirit
[1:39:43] wants you to live a godly life. Every
[1:39:47] day in the week, every night, separating
[1:39:50] yourselves from the things of the world.
[1:39:52] But the church didn't want that. They
[1:39:54] wanted some man who who can interpret
[1:39:57] the Bible the way they wanted to hear
[1:39:59] it. My they wanted to listen to the
[1:40:03] voice. They won't listen to the voice of
[1:40:06] the Holy Spirit speaking through the
[1:40:07] Bible. Many of them wanted to say the
[1:40:10] days of miracles is passed and they want
[1:40:13] tickle the people. They wanted to say
[1:40:15] there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:18] The people didn't want to act way
[1:40:20] different than what the rest of the
[1:40:23] world acts. Amen. You know, that's part
[1:40:26] of the rejection that the world, but I'm
[1:40:30] so thankful. You know, there's a people
[1:40:32] that have reject this world and embraced
[1:40:35] the cross.
[1:40:37] Amen. Why don't we bow our hearts
[1:40:43] together? If the Lord spoke to you
[1:40:46] and you just feel that presence of the
[1:40:50] Lord around you and there's something on
[1:40:52] the inside just craving the leadership
[1:40:55] of God. Just want to tell you that if
[1:40:58] you respond to that that God is
[1:41:01] obligated to lead you. And if you want
[1:41:03] to lift your hand and you just want to
[1:41:06] purpose in your heart that it's only by
[1:41:10] your word that you want to follow after
[1:41:13] him with everything in you just like our
[1:41:15] brother said this morning in his prayer
[1:41:18] 100%. You want a total deliverance, it's
[1:41:22] going to require a total
[1:41:24] surrender. Let us pray together.
[1:41:30] Heavenly
[1:41:32] Father, Lord, how we love you, Lord. We
[1:41:35] recognize that you've placed something
[1:41:37] in us, Lord. And it was your love, God,
[1:41:42] to plant that within
[1:41:44] us. And Lord, we want to respond to that
[1:41:47] with everything that we have. And we
[1:41:50] want to say, God, forgive us,
[1:41:53] Lord. We ask God mercy.
[1:41:56] and we plead your blood and pray that
[1:42:00] Lord you would renew us. Oh God make us
[1:42:02] clean every wit and Lord that we can let
[1:42:07] go of things that maybe tried to beset
[1:42:10] our mind and keep us from following
[1:42:12] after you with everything Lord. Lord, I
[1:42:16] think of the rapture scripture. He says,
[1:42:18] "Seek thy face, Lord. Give us, oh God,
[1:42:21] that uncction to seek with everything
[1:42:23] that we have, Father. Lord, because we
[1:42:26] believe it's a craving, Lord." And the
[1:42:28] vitamin of your word is calling for
[1:42:30] manifestation, Lord. Help us to be
[1:42:32] faithful to feed, Lord, to water the
[1:42:36] seed that you've planted in the garden
[1:42:39] of our heart,
[1:42:40] Lord. Lord, give us strength. Give us,
[1:42:44] oh God, good health, that we can testify
[1:42:47] and be witnesses to others, Lord, that
[1:42:50] you've been faithful and that it's you
[1:42:52] that started the work and it's you
[1:42:54] that'll finish it. Father, I commit the
[1:42:56] people, desiring you'd bless them
[1:42:59] and fill them with all your goodness.
[1:43:02] Guide them, I pray throughout this week
[1:43:05] as we commit them to you in Jesus
[1:43:07] Christ's name. Amen. Let's sing this
[1:43:10] together.
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:21] Now
[1:43:23] under
[1:43:25] your
[1:43:29] wings,
[1:43:32] cover
[1:43:35] me with your
[1:43:38] mighty hands.
[1:43:42] And the ocean rise and
[1:43:48] flow. I will soar with you
[1:43:52] above the
[1:43:54] soul. Father, you are king
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] over you are
[1:44:10] God. Bless my
[1:44:16] soul. He
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:30] Christ in quiet.
[1:44:36] When the ocean rise and
[1:44:40] thunder
[1:44:42] go, I
[1:44:45] will
[1:44:46] above the
[1:44:49] stor. Father, you are king
[1:44:56] over. I will be still.
[1:45:01] [Music]
[1:45:03] Amen. As we prepare to turn the service
[1:45:05] over to our brother Billy, if you need
[1:45:08] special prayer and you want to come, we
[1:45:10] pray with you. Lord bless you this
[1:45:13] week. Amen. Let's sing that again.
[1:45:18] Oh joy, oh
[1:45:24] Lord will be
[1:45:27] my strength.
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:43] Oh, and when the oceans rise and
[1:45:47] tides
[1:45:49] roll, I will sow with you
[1:45:53] above the
[1:45:56] stor. Father, you are king
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:02] over. Oh, and I will be still for you.
[1:46:09] Oh, and when the oceans rise and
[1:46:14] time
[1:46:16] roll, I
[1:46:19] will above the
[1:46:23] storm. Father, you are king over the
[1:46:29] flood. I will still know you are
[1:46:36] God. Hallelujah.
[1:46:38] I believe we believe the word of
[1:46:40] tonight. Amen. Did he speak to you
[1:46:42] tonight? Amen. Was something said that
[1:46:45] just quickened your heart tonight and
[1:46:47] said, "Lord, thank you." You know, the
[1:46:49] scripture says that they that are led of
[1:46:51] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:46:53] God. Our identification is that we are
[1:46:56] led by the spirit of God. You know the
[1:46:59] prophet will say I can't remember what
[1:47:01] message that I in in our nature it it's
[1:47:05] natural for women to want to do the
[1:47:07] things and to look pretty and to put
[1:47:09] makeup and to do all of that. It's
[1:47:11] natural as a man to try to do things and
[1:47:14] then but when we when we are born again
[1:47:16] that nature is die is dead. We we we the
[1:47:20] Holy Spirit is to take that nature and
[1:47:23] kill it and give you a new nature that
[1:47:26] comes from God. a nature that desire for
[1:47:28] the things above. Anytime that that old
[1:47:31] nature try to come up, that old that new
[1:47:33] nature say, "No, we have given that up.
[1:47:35] We can't do that anymore." Anytime. But
[1:47:38] that Holy Spirit had to be fed the word.
[1:47:41] He He needs the word so he could
[1:47:43] continue in the fight. He needs the word
[1:47:45] so he could be there to fight for you.
[1:47:48] You can't go feed on the things of the
[1:47:50] world and expect to be an overcomer. You
[1:47:52] got to feed on the word so that nature
[1:47:55] could be there.
[1:47:57] It's it's that desire. We heard it this
[1:47:59] morning. It was the Holy Spirit. Who
[1:48:01] knew that when you were in the world in
[1:48:04] sin, something within your heart said,
[1:48:06] "This is not right." It was the Holy
[1:48:08] Spirit after you.
[1:48:10] I think that's marvelous.
[1:48:13] Now, and let me say this. One of the
[1:48:14] things we forget that there are people
[1:48:16] in this world that that doesn't affect
[1:48:19] them. That's right. That's right. That's
[1:48:22] right. They can do whatever they want.
[1:48:24] They can do it whenever they want. It
[1:48:26] doesn't affect them. But you are sitting
[1:48:29] here tonight. When you do wrong, your
[1:48:32] heartbeat just raises up and something
[1:48:34] just I can't believe I'm doing this.
[1:48:37] It's the Holy Spirit. And I don't want
[1:48:40] you to go that way. And that's what we
[1:48:42] got to feed. I love how Alberto said
[1:48:44] it's given so we could feed. We could
[1:48:46] feed on the word of God. It's a feed.
[1:48:48] And then the moment you get the Holy
[1:48:50] Spirit, it's not he he justified you. We
[1:48:53] sanctify you. Now you are put into
[1:48:55] service for you to do something for him.
[1:48:58] Not for us to just say, "Oh, thank God I
[1:49:00] have the Holy Spirit." But God is
[1:49:02] putting you into service for something
[1:49:04] that he wants you to do. We are such a
[1:49:07] blessed people. Oh, if we can only
[1:49:09] recognize that God wants to do more
[1:49:12] above what we can think or ask, that is
[1:49:15] here drawing you and and bringing you.
[1:49:17] Let me say this. the leadership of this
[1:49:19] word of God. It's the Holy Spirit
[1:49:22] speaking to you.
[1:49:25] Imagine the blindness that's out there.
[1:49:28] Our brother read it that you you have
[1:49:30] the world that even churches the eyes
[1:49:33] have been plugged out. They've
[1:49:35] substituted the leadership of the Holy
[1:49:37] Spirit with the leadership of men. And
[1:49:39] it's a blind leading the blind. Amen.
[1:49:44] Without this message, we have no sight.
[1:49:46] That's right. It's it's God giving us an
[1:49:50] eyesight. This is going to happen and we
[1:49:52] see it happen. Watch over there. That's
[1:49:55] going to happen. Oh my. Let me tell you,
[1:49:57] if he's showing us all of those things,
[1:49:59] it's not just so we can see them and and
[1:50:01] stay. It's is him leading you and
[1:50:04] letting you know that I'm taking you
[1:50:06] somewhere. I've shown you all this other
[1:50:08] things, but I'm taking you. So, our
[1:50:10] mission is greater than what we see
[1:50:12] around us. He's taking us into the
[1:50:14] rapture. Amen. But if we can only follow
[1:50:18] that leadership and know that when he
[1:50:20] speaks, oh Lord, I heard your voice. I
[1:50:22] see this. And let that leadership
[1:50:24] continue to lead me. I I don't He would
[1:50:27] speak to churches and men. He said, I
[1:50:29] can't believe there's this denomination.
[1:50:32] One will come, a man will speak
[1:50:34] something that is contrary to the word
[1:50:36] of God, but yet people will follow him.
[1:50:42] Insanity. A man will remain in the
[1:50:44] church that doesn't believe the whole
[1:50:47] word of God. He just it's like how is it
[1:50:50] who's leading you? That's why he said he
[1:50:52] makes a statement that people are being
[1:50:54] taken to churches instead of being taken
[1:50:56] to Christ. Why? Because Christ is the
[1:50:59] word of God. Christ is the reality of
[1:51:03] this hour. Once you meet him, something
[1:51:05] within your heart is beating for him.
[1:51:08] You don't want any substitute. You want
[1:51:10] him and nothing else. And that's what we
[1:51:12] desire every day that he may lead us
[1:51:15] what whatever he wants us to do wherever
[1:51:18] he wants us. We just want to play the
[1:51:20] role that he want us to play. We want to
[1:51:22] be part of his kingdom. That's the
[1:51:25] There's nothing greater than that than
[1:51:26] to be part of his kingdom and be called
[1:51:29] at his service to serve him and to serve
[1:51:31] his people. Amen. I was thinking about
[1:51:34] that song. I keep listening um for a
[1:51:37] different sound. I believe it's F. I
[1:51:39] don't know.
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:44] We hear about the
[1:51:47] wars. See famine in the
[1:51:52] land. In the children's eyes, trouble in
[1:51:57] the east
[1:51:58] again. The whole world is
[1:52:02] shaking. There's nurture place to stand.
[1:52:06] Oh, and mountful sounds I heard
[1:52:09] throughout the
[1:52:11] land. Oh, but I keep listening for a
[1:52:18] different sound. Oh, and the sound of
[1:52:22] the city that John saw coming down. Oh,
[1:52:27] and the sound of the rock united with
[1:52:32] the lamb. Oh, I keep
[1:52:37] listening. I keep
[1:52:41] listening. I keep listening for a
[1:52:45] different
[1:52:48] sound. Well, I remember the preacher
[1:52:52] saying,
[1:52:54] "Sin counter. There will come a
[1:53:00] generation that will be the light." Oh,
[1:53:04] I can't believe I'm standing here seeing
[1:53:08] the end of time. Oh, and a preacher's
[1:53:12] voice echo in my heart.
[1:53:16] All that I keep listening to for a
[1:53:21] different sound. Oh, and the sound of
[1:53:26] the sea that saw coming down. Oh, the
[1:53:31] sound of the
[1:53:35] rocked with the
[1:53:37] lamb. Oh, I keep
[1:53:41] listening. I keep listening.
[1:53:45] I keep listening for a different
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:51] sound. Oh, and I keep listening for a
[1:53:58] different Oh, and the sound of the sea
[1:54:03] that I saw coming down. Oh, and the
[1:54:07] sound of the rock united with the Oh,
[1:54:13] and the sound of the
[1:54:16] glor glory to the
[1:54:19] lamb. Oh, I keep
[1:54:23] listening. I keep
[1:54:26] listening. I keep listening for her
[1:54:31] different sound.
[1:54:35] Hallelujah.
[1:54:36] The word of God, the end time message,
[1:54:39] it's a different sound to the believers.
[1:54:42] Amen. Brother Jerel Cab, if you could
[1:54:44] just come and dismiss us tonight.
