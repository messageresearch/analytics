me Faithfully tomorrow he's guiding me constantly give it to me the reason ability there's something he told me [Music] Bible reading tonight I'm gonna read Bible stories I like everybody like a good Bible story amen amen so let's first of all open our Bibles to the gospel of James and we want to read a scripture there in James 7 uh James the fourth chapter and the seventh verse and uh I don't know really have a title I guess we could call it resisting the devil or how about tell the devil to take a hike or get behind me Satan and right so any number of those are good titles that's at this simple scripture submit yourselves therefore to God and that a good word of advice amen submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated I uh I don't know if you caught it this morning but I certainly did appreciate uh when when brother Tim felt inspired to come back and and share that with us because it was it was just such a perfect match with the word of the Lord you know and you know the the a lot of times when God moves like that a lot of those things are missed you know what I mean because everything's been so sensationalized that the Simplicity of the Gospel sometimes goes unnoticed I'd like to read this statement that uh before we go into what we're we're just going to share um you know brother Graham was taught this morning talking about how the systems of the world they've tried to build everything into a system some way to save the world instead of taking God's way of saving the world which is the word of God then he points this out and he says he says I don't see how it could get any worse than what it is now the whole thing is corrupt our political World man-made systems and the Fashions he says he says we want everything just everything so we can take it easy and retire and and take life easy life was an intended to be easy life is a struggle and anything that's got life is a struggle look at a tree how they struggle look at at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of a system and take it easy then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong and I thought you know uh that that seems to be human nature it certainly seems to be my nature you know that we like to take things easy but I'd like to go back and like I said we'll read a little but I want to go to Hebrews are very familiar chapter of Hebrews we all love and it's Hebrews chapter 11. and we we know this uh chapter mainly by two verses that are the ones that we probably all have memorized and it's Hebrews 11 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so we know that faith is not attached to any of our senses but it's attached to God speaking to our heart and giving us Revelation the other scripture that we so often refer to us but without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God Must Believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and then our chapter goes on and it says by faith Noah being warned of God not uh God of things not seen as yet moved with fear and prepared an ark to save his house so uh no I didn't see rain before he moved but he believed what God said to him and and he acted upon it and it says by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receiving for inheritance obeyed and and went out not knowing whether he went uh there's another great attribute of faith that he was told here take off you know I'm bringing to a land this land is going to be inheritance but he didn't know where he went he went by faith you know I believe that God's looking for a church that can follow him amen amen that can trust him and looking and I I believe he's building that up in us I believe we're coming to that I honestly do I believe that he's trying to set our minds to where we start looking for the supernatural and and so he talks about Abraham he talks about the faith of Sarah he comes down and he talks about Moses and and by faith how Moses chose the children of Israel uh that appeared to be slaves and mud daubers but he chose them over all the riches of Egypt to be to to make his uh identification with them and he numbered himself among them and and uh it's it's good to be numbered amongst the despised of this world Amen so we know those things about Abraham and these things but I'd like just to jump down here uh as we read in that and um and go uh who talks about Rahab but I'd like to go to the uh um 30-second verse and I'd like to read the rest of the chapter because this is another aspect of faith and I think one of the things that we've got to really start to understand is that that we're not always able to run from the Devil sometimes you just got to stand up and face them you know what I mean sometimes you just gotta call it like it is and stand and make your make your claim your your faith claim you've got to claim the land that's yours you've got to claim your inheritance we a lot of times speak it this way you got to possess the gates of the enemy that you've got to stand there and say enough is enough you know what I mean this is the day I'm standing in the sand this is the day but that I'm not going to be moved this is the day I'm going to call you what you are uh this is the day of my Deliverance this is the time that I'm not going to go any farther I'm going to stand and fight and then we start reading these great stories here that we continue to read and and it says here he said what shall what and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and a Barrack and of Samson and of uh of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who by faith subdued kingdoms Roth righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lion quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of the weakness they were out of weakness were made strong wax violent and fight turned to have flight the the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might attain a better resurrection and others had Trials of cruelly mockings and and scourging Yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment and they were stoned and they were sought asunder were tempted we're slain with the sword they they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins at being guested to The Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains in dens and caves of the Earth and all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect I thought you know uh do you think you want every scripture applied to your life you know sometimes when you really take a look at what uh people have gone through and things that have gone through you know it's amazing but the thing that I like about him and as we read just a couple of these great Bible stories here found in the Bible I want you to see that these Great Men of Faith they had to stand up to the devil you know there just comes a time you've just got to tell him to take a hike I mean it's just it she's a he's like a roaring lion he's he goes about he's always there to uh uh to try to make things difficult to withstand us and and we've got to resist him you've got to resist the devil and he will flee because we know one thing about him he's a bluff so let's turn in our Bibles and let's go to this great story as and I'm not a good reader so we'll have them put it on the board found in the Kings the 18th chapter of kings and and uh and as we uh read these uh scriptures uh uh we find out that uh in the 17th verse of the uh 18th chapter and it it says and it came to pass when ahem saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel now I want you to get the story Ahab Elijah told Ahab it's not going to rain till I call for it that's right and so they entered into a Great Famine right and in this time we know that Ahab was married to Jezebel yeah and in this famine Jezebel had turned to the gods of of pagan gods that got the gods of uh Balaam and uh so we find out that uh that they're serving a different God and so and if Eliza begins to answer and he says and he answered and said I have not troubled Israel but doubt in thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou Hast followed Balaam now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and to and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table and so Ahab sent all the children of Israel sent to all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel now you think in reading that you think that he did that by obedience no he did that because he thought his hour had come to put Elijah in his place he was confident in what he believed right he had been deceived now this story has some really tremendous turns to it so and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt eat between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word and why wouldn't they answer that that seemed like a simple question he said as me as for me in my house will serve the Lord but what does it mean to be halted between two opinions it means you're not sure right it's like sitting at a table of a used car salesman and he's trying to sell you a car and you don't know whether you should or whether you shouldn't and he's trying to talk you into it and and he's starting to tell you you know this car has been in a garage and it's never went nowhere but to the grocery store you know and it was just a little old granny that had it you know what I mean and and uh and and just drawing on you and pulling on you but you can't pull the trigger I don't mean with a gun on the salesman I mean you you can't you can't you can't go ahead and say I'll take it you know what I mean you're stuck and and they couldn't speak a word because they weren't sure you know and and the devil exists you know you can't say he doesn't exist eases he's as real as you are and you know sometimes you just got to face them sometimes you just gotta look at them and call them what he is and say you know you're the devil I've been called the devil you know at least I thought well at least that she believes there's a devil right right you know what I mean let me say that good about them but so they they couldn't answer right why are you stuck and I think that that's what we need sometimes to do is look at both sides of the picture and I'll tell you choose God right amen that's what he that's what he said he says serve God and resist the devil don't hold don't don't you know that it's a two-edged sword it isn't just serve God you know that that's the trouble we always want to serve God you know you can't be a Christian to the devil I'm sorry he's a liar he's the father of lies and there's no truth in them the only way you can be a Christian to the devil is to speak the truth and the truth is Satan you are a liar you are the lowest thing there is you are going to burn all right you know you know we we tolerate them and I'd like you to look at uh Elijah here because he ain't gonna tolerate it you understand he he's come to the point I ain't gonna tolerate it I ain't gonna put up with this devil I'm not going to put up with this lie you know what I mean it's time that this comes to an end and and because so he he says here and the people answered not a word in other words they weren't convinced they weren't sold out and then Elijah unto then set Elijah unto the people I even I alone remain a prophet of the Lord but Bale's prophets are 450 men let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one Bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other Bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under it and and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord God the the Lord God that answereth by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken that's a that's a pretty straightforward thing right if God be God then serve them if Satan be God if God have The Truth Listen to him but if Satan have The Truth Listen to him why would you listen to somebody that's a liar and you know he's a liar there's no truth in them they think someone came one time and said you know brother McGarry pray for me Satan's telling me I'm going to hell that's like a ticket yeah you know what I mean that's like a ticket to Glory you know what I mean Satan says you're lost oh thank you Jesus because he can't tell the truth yes he can't tell the truth he just can't tell the truth he can't even he's so he's so stuck just like these prophets they so believed that they were serving a God but it wasn't a God that could answer that's right Satan can't answer Satan can only pervert and and so the he this sorry goes on he says and and uh that they said you know uh uh well spoken and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal choose you one bull up for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under so he even let them make the first choice you know you you pick so I don't want you to say that I had anything to do with it I'll take what you leave over you know now I want you to uh you're you're the Elijah's of this day and they took the Bullock which was given to them and they dressed it and they called on the name of Balaam from morning until noon saying oh Baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leapt upon the altar which was made I want you to see all the carrying on doesn't move God now I don't have this on tape to um back it up in any way and prove it but my good friend Doug mchughes he sat across from me one day and he said Brother David brother Branham looked me right in the eye and he pointed at me and I'll paraphrase it the best I can he said brother Doug you can holler and scream till you have no voice left he said you can fast tell your skin and bones he says you can pray tell your knees our fullest gaps he says you can cry until you don't have any tears left he says but God's not going to do any more for you than what he said he would do for you there's one thing God can't do and that's lie he keeps every promise we've spent too much time trying to change God's mind and not accepting God's mind and asking God to change our mind I want you to see all that they're doing all could be effort all their leaping on the altar they're going on it even gets worse so they prayed for from morning till noon oh hear us oh bail right and so it says they they and there there was uh and they left upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon Elijah mocked them now I think we're we're afraid of the bluff he wasn't afraid to call Satan what he is he wasn't afraid to look I said this is the devil I'm not buying it I'm not taking it this is true it's like we we become Advocates you know maybe not on purpose but we try to justify things that don't no other explanation other than it's a devil we try to find truth for a lie we try to justify sometimes people that we love and and and and and make excuses for them that doesn't help them any the truth of the matter is the truth the truth you know God doesn't lay anything to the charge of God's elect we might as well speak the truth and go forward see in righteousness you know but we you can't give Satan any space at all if he can get his shoe in the door you know what I mean he'll be setting up camp you know what I mean if you let him in he'll you'll have a house guest that's the kind of person he is yeah he's got he's he he sucks virtue he sucks strength he sucks your time he sucked your mind he tries to dry up your faith there's nothing in it for you he's all about himself and he he doesn't know what truth is and so I like this he says and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or pre-aventure he's sleepeth and must be awakened I like that I mean this guy is not playing games he knows where he stands he knows what God told them to do he's not sitting here going to try to baby these guys along or anything he says all right you claim okay cry louder he must be asleep and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them that's how fanatical that's how far Satan will go he has no limits he'll take your children he'll do whatever he can you've got to resist the devil you've got to fight him you've got to stand against him when he creeps up in his infancy you can't let him there's not a place that that he starts that doesn't grow you've got to stop him right at the doorway in fact when you possess his Gates you don't even give him an entrance in you fortify yourself behind God's word you fortify yourself behind promises you build yourself up in the word of God you study to show yourself approved yeah you know you've got an adversary and you know he's a lion and and part of your life is a life of knowing you've got to defend him because he's coming he's coming he's gonna come lie to you so you got to be ready you got a challenge you got to let them know you're not afraid of them you've got to stand right up against them you got to speak to him you've got you gotta calm as a liar you gotta say that's just a trick of the devil when he starts working on your mind you you've got to just answer them I remember one day in Montana uh it was an experience I'll never forget I was just writing down the road coming up this beautiful Mountain Trails going up towards my house and and all of a sudden I felt the presence in my truck and I'm telling you it felt like somebody was sitting there I'd have reached over and touched it but I was too scared and all this good and it smoked it just sparked on me he said what if this isn't true what if you know what if you left California and it was a mistake you know and again just started erasing the questions just started questioning my faith just started questioning my decisions it's just you know what if it's the right thing then I'm thinking here I am a Montana you know I come out of California we're facing winter I've never lived here before uh I thought you know I I I didn't know what I was doing you know me and Leslie were just married and I don't remember if I we were expecting Sharon or not and I just remember him asking me that and I remember if I start to think that if I even consider that if I even take that in yeah and start looking at it through one Speck could have I done something else my faith would have been shattered I said get out of my truck Satan get out of my truck get out of my head get out of my life I know this is truth I know God spoke to me you're right I I'm journeying into a land I never benefit to before but I know one thing when I listen to that message he said it is I be not afraid and so I'm committing my life into his hand and and I'll tell you you'll strengthen yourself spiritually by not giving the devil any ground you'll strengthen Yourself by realizing you have a right to mock him oh that ain't Christian well you you look at I mean what did Samson do with the King in all the spoils that were brought back contrary to God's word you say well he took the king and tried to lead him to Judaism no he didn't you know what he did cut his head off because God said slay them all what did he do he slayed them all you say that's not very nice what did Jesus do when he went into the temple he said oh men and brethren it's really not a good idea that you sell on the Sabbath and that you do these things you know no what did he do he prayedeth a a rope he he sat down I could just imagine him I I played this through my mind do you play Bible stories through your mind I'm a big Daydreamer so I I've watched him raid that rope 100 times every time it gets bigger you know what I mean just tying them knots looking at them guys the scorn just in his eyes looking at him those poor little people coming up and barely got a little bit and this guy and they're just giving their money and these guys selling doves and selling offerings and putting the money in there and and ripping them off and and and all that stuff and and these people just wanting to serve God it's a whole lot like religion today what did he do he prayed it the the cord up and he went in there and he started kicking their tables over you know what I mean he didn't have room he didn't have space for the enemy he called them all the time use you Hypocrites you know what I mean uh come here give me a Hypocrites render to Caesar what Caesar into God's what's God this this idea that that we're a bunch of nobody's Christians are rugged they you got it to be a Christian you got to be rugged you got to stand up you got to be as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove and he just beat the fire out of him that's what he did he kicked their tables over and whooped them and beat him and drove them out and said you've made my father's house a den of Thieves it's hard sometimes to stand for the truth it's hard sometimes when there's people you love involved in things that you love that are involved it's hard but wrongs wrong and rights right and the gospel doesn't need to be handled with kid gloves it's the truth it's the truth that set you free one day the very truth that you speak will come back and bless your children they will the word of God doesn't return void don't give space to the devil don't give space to them let's go with my story it's not my story it's Elijah's story but it's mine too because I identify with them don't you and it came to pass when midday was passed and they had prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any answer nor any regard you know why because Satan don't regard you he hates you he despises you he has no regard for you or for what you believe or for what you stand for that's why you gotta fight for what you stand for when the world wants you to go contrary to the word of God don't compromise stand up and fight and Elijah said unto the people come near unto me all the people came near unto him and he he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broke down what do you think those guys did to that altar leaping on it and gash in on it and carrying on don't you think what's what's the Lord done in our day he's repaired our altar he's repaired it back to the word of God he told us that Satan's a bluff now look at all that carrying on how are the people sitting back waiting any minute that the a fire was going to fall and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be mine thy name and with those stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he and he put the wood in order and cut the Bullock in pieces and lay and laid it on the wood and and filled four barrels of water imported on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood and he said do it the second time and they did it a second time and he said to it do it the third time and they did it the third time justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit I mean whatever you would like to go first pull second poll third pole amen and the water ran about the Altar and he lifted the the trench also and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things at Thy Word [Music] in that what we we want to start saying I've done all the things that I do at Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that these people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou hath turned their hearts back again amen you think after all that God would have been done with Israel God's never done with his elect I don't care how far they stray I don't fear how far they go God will have a word he'll have a gospel he'll have something that'll find him he'll find something that'll reach him don't let the devil ever lie to you about your children refuse to accept his reasoning there's no reason God saved you what good reason have you given God to save you does any of you have a righteousness now that you would like to plead before the father to get in on I don't know I want to plead the blood I like that story of uh is was it Danny Henry was that who it was uh that had the dream and he come up before the presence of the Lord and he said Lord I'm Danny I'm the Evangelist I led thousands to the Lord and he started reciting all his works and he said the closer he got he he started to remember every little lie every little thing he wasn't just a hundred percent you know he didn't tell the whole story you know he he everything came to him and he said he was all he was sitting there waiting for is a voice to ring out depart from me you doer of iniquity condemned he had no righteousness to offer and then the voice rang out didn't it father he said it was the sweetest voice he ever heard father he stood for me and I promised if you would stand for me in this world that I would stand for you and God kept his word God always keeps his word there's only one thing you can count on and that's God keeping his word God cannot lie he'll keep his word let's just finish this story I I wanted to read a whole bunch more but we won't do it I would do it but we better not do it he said because he he he got and thou hath turned their hearts back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consume the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stone and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when the people saw it they fell on their face and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god that's a good place to end the story but there's something else here that I I still can't wrap my mind around in Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal let not one of them Escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook of keyson and slew them there and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain I I think I'd have just condemned Ahab I I'm amazed at his attitude right he's been worshiping but yet he said get up so Ahab went up and ate and drank and Elijah went on top of the of Carmel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees and said to his servant go up now look towards the sea and when he went up he looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say to Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not and it came to pass well that that Heavens was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain in Ahab Road and went to Jezebel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he girdeth up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of jeril Elijah is rejoicing with them because he withstood the devil yeah and by withstanding the devil He restored back Israel I'm telling you you don't realize the power that you have in standing against the devil let's don't give the devil any space I wanted to read over in Acts about Paul uh and over in Samuel about David and and Goliath and how that David withstood Goliath and Goliath am I a dog that you come out here with a sheave in other words a little stick and he said I'm going to feed you the birds oh David didn't say oh please don't do that he says no he said you've defied the armies of the Living God I'm going to cut your head off and the birds and the fowls are going to eat you they withstood it they withstood okay David withstood Goliath and and he called them what he is he said you uncircumcised Philistine how dare you defy the armies of the Living God why he believed what his inheritance was do you understand what Satan's trying to do he's trying to rob you of your inheritance he's a thief no man with no if he knew the thief was going to come in he would protect his Goods that that's what you've got to do you've got to protect your promises you've got to protect your goods you've got to protect the things that God said about you you can't let him run you down destroy your personality destroy your self-esteem put labels on you that you don't deserve he says well you're a sinner you're no good well I'm not trusting in my righteousness my righteousness is filthy rags but he's applied his righteousness to me through the blood that's what I've got to stand for that's when I got to testify to I can't let if he was he's a robber he's a thief he tries to come in in the night what is the night it's Your Darkest Hours it's your low esteem it's your low points he wants to rob you he's got nothing good to say about you or to you don't listen he told me I was ugly now I feel like the most handsome guy around it's not the outside I'm worried about it's a character on the inside you know what I mean okay just I can't express enough serve God resist the devil resist the devil fight the devil lie call him a liar doesn't matter doesn't matter what the doctor says it doesn't matter if he looked at it and said oh you know something we've never had a reading before with blood pressure so low there's no possible way you can make it and that man believed God's word he believed God's prophet he said Doctor he wasn't mad at the doctor he said Doctor you're reading medical charts I accept that he said but I'm reading the promises of God and if it comes to me to believe the medical chart or the promise of God I'm not going to Halt between two opinions I'm going to choose God's word amen amen that's what I'm going to choose no wonder Paul said study to show yourself approved you brother REM said you've got to know what God promised you've got to know what his promises are go in there he said it's like a fish being in the ocean and saying oh I better not take a little gulp of this ocean I might use it all up you can't use it uh you say oh what happens if I use up all the blessings of God and all the mercy of God he'll create more he's an abundant Fountain how many times will he forgive you 70 times 70 in one day he practices what he preaches all right you know what I mean it just comes time that we've got to accept our election we got to accept our justification we've got to do all that we can to sanctify ourselves and in the places we're having trouble we ask for help right Lord I have a very hard time with this help me the scripture says in the wise will he turn you away he promised he wouldn't turn you away I don't care what Satan says I don't care what he says why because it ain't true it ain't true how much could we ever go on to say David when he looked at Goliath Goliath just started sputing out words the scripture said that Goliath cursed him and cursed is God and spirit he had no regard you can't reason with the devil that's right you can't reason with them you can't make a deal with them he if you made a deal with him he wouldn't keep it don't make a deal I'm not suggesting you try to make a deal with them don't listen to him walk away he's no part of your life he's no part of your mind he's no part of it he's just no part of it and I just wanted to talk about David how David withstood Goliath he withstood him because Daniel wouldn't bend his knee to a false god he wasn't afraid if it came down to it he would rather be eaten by lions then give the devil one inch of ground and then the last story I was going to read you could go ahead and read it because I loved that story too and it's the story I'll just tell the story you know the story but it's the damsel that began to follow Paul around you remember that story and she starts calling out and you know what she was saying she was saying the truth oh these men are men of God that they uh that that they they're bringing the word to Salvation Paul didn't need her vindication you understand he didn't want anybody to believe him because of her he didn't want anybody to put their faith in something that God didn't vindicate Paul wanted him to believe him because he didn't come with word only but with demonstration and power of the spirit of God he didn't need this damsel's help so he turned around and he cast that Spirit out of her and she had a master that was making lots of money you know the story I think it's in Acts uh 16 if I'm I'm not mistaken and so she she's making lots of money for this guy so this guy gets mad and he grabs Paul and and who is with them and and grows up and it throws him before the magistrates and and tells them all these stories about them and lies and and so they they rip their clothes off and they beat them and they throw them into prison and now not only did they throw him in the prison they threw him in the inner prison now my point is I want you to watch Paul not take anything from the Devil now we might have taken this story a whole different way so they throw Paul in there and in the middle of the night there's an earthquake and the doors open and the jailer it's going to take a sword and slay himself and Paul yells out from the dirt do thyself no harm we're still here how many other people you think were still there there's two people left in the jail why did Paul stay you ever think white balls day so the Jailer comes in and they're still there he knows they could have left and he throws himself at his feet and he says what must I do to be saved and Paul says the scripture says maybe I could just find that one little portion foreign Paul cried with the loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here and then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved in thy house and they spoke unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house and he took them that same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he in all his house and he brought him them to his house and set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God and all his house and when it was they the magistrate sent the surgeon saying let those men go now I want you to watch Paul I want you to watch his attitude I want you to watch his stand I want you to watch the kind of guy that he was and the and the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul the magistrates have have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace and Paul said to them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being Romans and of cast us into prison and now do they trust us thrust us out privately nay but let them come themselves and fetch us out I like that that's that's my kind of guy right there you know you did all this to me and you want me to tiptoe away no Satan you come here he wasn't cutting them no slap and you think he left town no he didn't leave town he didn't run he didn't hide he wasn't just happy to get out of there alive well that's not his testimony and the and the surgeons told these words unto the magistrate and they feared when they heard that they were Romans and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of Lydia and when they had seen the Brethren they comforted them and departed yeah that's the kind of attitude we need to have to the devil Sorry Devil you get no breaks you cut no slack I don't say pick a fight with them but when he comes you fight you resist you tell him what he is you tell him what you think you tell them what you stand for you don't give them a space man Satan shows up in a lot of different ways he shows up in your friend at school with some idea he shows up and a colleague at work with some story he he shows up with some business idea I only know my own little stories how the Lord blessed me I was working one day again back in Montana and I put a quarter in a pop machine and quarters dumped out of it handfuls of quarters just poured out of it you'd have thought I was in Las Vegas or something and I remember I scooped all those quarters and I brought him into the office and the guys were begging me don't bring those into the office you know buy us all Cokes Oh I thought man I could become pretty popular I could become one of the boys no no it was the devil it was the devil anything that's contrary to the word is what Antichrist it's the devil the devil speaking everywhere he's speaking through all kinds of things he's trying to get you to compromise don't give the devil any space let's fight the devil let's make him pay foreign how do you make Satan pay not by inflicting harm by staying true to God's word that's what he hates this bride will stay true to God's word regardless so that's our lesson for tonight the devil's a liar I can say that's the word of God there's no truth in them we have nothing to do with that guy we don't listen to him he's a failure and he's going to end up in the bad place and he's going to get all burned up us yeah Alice and I I don't feel sorry for him he's done me a lot of harm I have no pity you know what I mean he I he's invited to the barbecue that's all I can say and and he's what's going to be cooked so that's what I feel about the devil God bless you tonight brother [Applause] am I getting the KFC please I bless
