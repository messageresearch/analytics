[25:28] well thank you musicians and uh so I'm
[25:32] going to give you a little update where
[25:34] we
[25:34] are uh uh they're going to start
[25:38] painting
[25:39] tomorrow and uh they're supposed to be
[25:42] done
[25:43] painting uh
[25:45] Saturday
[25:47] so now we have probably 150 different
[25:51] paint color choices sitting in here you
[25:55] know and you know I know somebody would
[25:57] probably want orange walls and pink
[26:00] ceilings but whatever we paint it we're
[26:02] painting it so it's
[26:05] inmaterial and uh so we just you know
[26:09] I'm I'm sure not everybody's going to
[26:11] like it but uh U lesie likes it and
[26:16] uh and so you know happy wife happy
[26:22] life so uh but I I think I think it'll
[26:26] be fine so uh uh we're at that place we
[26:31] got pretty much the floors cleaned uh we
[26:34] didn't quite get around to cleaning the
[26:36] Windows like we were hoping to today uh
[26:40] so I don't know if they'll have them
[26:41] taped off tomorrow or not but we'll just
[26:43] pick it up so after
[26:46] Friday after uh sat they should finish
[26:49] painting Saturday and then starting
[26:52] Monday uh we can start installing all
[26:56] the receptacles light switches all the
[27:00] lighting and uh get that done uh all the
[27:04] speakers all the security
[27:07] cameras
[27:08] um you know all kinds of stuff so it's
[27:12] just going to be a uh to try to trim out
[27:15] as quick as we can put all the doors in
[27:18] all the flooring all the bathroom
[27:20] petitions
[27:22] and and so we hope that maybe we can be
[27:26] done in about 6 weeks
[27:28] if we get some help um and then of
[27:33] course the Landscaping will be coming
[27:35] along so that's where we're at we're
[27:38] we're kind of uh as we would say we're
[27:41] on the
[27:42] downhill side of things so this is the
[27:45] time that we need a lot of help so uh if
[27:49] you can uh give some time there's going
[27:52] to be cleaning
[27:53] sweeping um window cleaning uh all those
[27:58] kind of things that
[28:00] uh that's nobody likes to do but we got
[28:05] to do it anyway so if you can if you can
[28:08] pitch in on any of those items we would
[28:11] certainly uh be happy so we're looking
[28:15] forward to a great uh next couple weeks
[28:18] uh in progress tonight um we I want to
[28:22] listen to and I feel that kind of
[28:25] pressed on my heart especially in light
[28:29] of the place that we
[28:32] are uh in the direction that we're
[28:35] moving getting a new Sanctuary I wanted
[28:38] to listen to the little message that
[28:40] brother Brandon preached called what
[28:42] house will you build me and um when you
[28:48] listen to this I want you in your heart
[28:52] uh every time that brother brandham
[28:56] mentions brother Prairie green you put
[28:59] yourself in that spot uh brother Green's
[29:03] not with us any longer but what brother
[29:06] bram's talking about is he's talking
[29:09] about a church that's not a
[29:11] building but it's a it's a church and
[29:17] that church is made up of uh of
[29:22] of spirit Le people that the church it's
[29:29] not members but it's people that are led
[29:32] by the unction of the holy spirit so I I
[29:36] feel as brother Brandon preaches as he's
[29:39] emphasizing that individual individual
[29:43] leadership of people staying true to
[29:47] what God tells them to stay true to
[29:51] right and then God takes all the people
[29:55] that he's leading into individually and
[29:58] then he places that together and
[30:01] accomplishes his will for the church the
[30:05] leadership of the holy spirit is always
[30:08] according to the word of God but so
[30:11] we're we're listening to this to catch
[30:14] the attitude of what the prophet of
[30:17] God's talking about going forward and I
[30:21] also hope that uh somehow that we can
[30:25] catch uh another
[30:27] very tremendous point that our messenger
[30:31] is bringing to us is that people that
[30:34] are led by the
[30:36] spirit often times have great sacrifice
[30:40] along with that leadership it it's not a
[30:44] bed of ease it's it's the sacrifice we
[30:49] just listened here not long ago to the
[30:52] message
[30:53] leadership and the Rich Young Ruler rer
[30:57] was led by the spirit but he wasn't
[31:01] willing to pay the price the cost so we
[31:06] have to know in our lives that when
[31:09] we're LED of the spirit the spirit
[31:11] doesn't always lead us down a Rosy path
[31:16] and the easy way it's even when the
[31:20] prophecy came to brother Brenham he said
[31:23] because thou H has chosen the narrow way
[31:26] the harder way
[31:27] a great portion of Heaven awaits you and
[31:31] so as we listen to this we hope that it
[31:35] sinks in our heart that what what are we
[31:39] building well we're not trying to build
[31:41] this a building this building doesn't
[31:45] represent anything but clay and mortar
[31:49] and God doesn't dwell in buildings that
[31:53] are made by hands that's right he dwells
[31:55] in the hearts of the people people and
[31:58] and it's the atmosphere and the
[32:01] leadership that we're all trying to
[32:04] individually come under so I I hope it's
[32:08] it's like 22 minutes long uh it it's uh
[32:13] it's really got some real nuggets in it
[32:16] so this evening if let us stand and
[32:19] they'll start playing uh I think it's in
[32:22] the uh uh out of the seventh chapter of
[32:27] the book of Acts beginning with the 44th
[32:31] verse and we'll take our seats right
[32:34] after the uh after the end of the sermon
[32:39] so we don't want to listen to it like
[32:42] brother bram's talking about Perry green
[32:46] we want to listen to it like brother
[32:48] brandom's talking to us and I hope you
[32:51] can do it take it to heart I believe
[32:54] it'll be a blessing to you and and the
[32:57] the smallest sacrifice for the Lord
[33:00] he'll reward in this life and the life
[33:04] to come hund fold God bless you father
[33:07] bless your word to us in jesus' name we
[33:09] pray God bless
[33:13] you now let us read just a a verse or
[33:16] two here out of the the seventh chapter
[33:19] of the book of Acts beginning with the
[33:21] 44th
[33:23] verse our fathers had the Tabernacle of
[33:26] witness in the the Wilderness as he has
[33:29] appointed speaking unto Moses that he
[33:32] should make it according to the fashion
[33:34] that he had seen which also our father
[33:38] came after brought in with Jesus unto
[33:43] the possession of the Gentiles whom God
[33:46] drave out before the face of our fathers
[33:49] unto the days of David who found favor
[33:52] before God and desired to find a
[33:55] tabernacle for are the god of Jacob but
[33:59] Solomon built him a house how be it the
[34:04] most high dwelleth not in temples made
[34:06] with hands as saith a prophet Heaven is
[34:10] my Throne Earth is my foot stol what
[34:14] house will you build me sayith the Lord
[34:16] or what is the place of my rest has not
[34:19] my hands made all these
[34:21] things upon this the reading of this
[34:24] scripture I want to say the few words
[34:28] that I want to say before brother Perry
[34:30] brings the morning message I find this
[34:33] one of the Great Moments of my visit to
[34:37] Tucson I come here because that I was
[34:41] led to come here I come here because
[34:44] that the Holy Spirit through a vision
[34:46] sent me here uh know that might seems
[34:51] strange maybe but he as far as I know
[34:55] anything that I know of God
[34:57] I was sent by Vision to tuon amen I
[35:00] wondered how I ever was sent to this
[35:04] desert
[35:05] place and then here where there
[35:09] is spiritually
[35:11] speaking uh over the city I don't know
[35:14] of any place that's any more spiritual
[35:18] dead in in the city of
[35:21] Kon there is war between the churches
[35:24] there is fusses between the congregation
[35:27] there's no unity in everyone grabbing
[35:30] and holding and squeezing and trying to
[35:32] get this one and
[35:33] proing it is a desert spiritually
[35:36] speaking
[35:38] also but then I read in the
[35:40] Bible that where God Called Moses away
[35:45] from his loved ones and all that was
[35:47] dear to him and sent him into the
[35:49] Wilderness to write the laws of the
[35:52] Bible that was the Old Testament the
[35:53] first four books Genesis Leviticus uom
[35:57] and exodus he um I never said them just
[36:01] in routine but that four books that
[36:03] really is the Old Testament because the
[36:07] rest of it was what the prophets said in
[36:08] the Psalms of David and so forth but the
[36:12] chronicles of the Kings but this was the
[36:16] fundamental of the Old Testament was
[36:19] Moses wrote them after he was called
[36:21] from his homeland where he had been born
[36:24] and brought up among his people and was
[36:26] sent into the desert to write this book
[36:31] of the Old Testament then I find that in
[36:34] the book of the New Testament where Paul
[36:37] which is the author or not the author
[36:39] but the writer of the New Testament he
[36:43] also was drove out from among his
[36:48] people and by the spirit into the Arabia
[36:52] where he was three and A2 years to uh
[36:56] find the inspiration and Paul is the
[37:00] chief writer of the New Testament amen
[37:03] now there is Matthew Mark Luke and John
[37:05] but they were scribes that just wrote
[37:07] what Jesus said as they followed him
[37:09] along and but you take uh the book to
[37:13] Timothy and to the Romans and to the
[37:16] Hebrews and so forth Paul received
[37:19] inspiration to write the New Testament
[37:23] taking all the Old Testament as a shadow
[37:25] and setting it in and God honored it and
[37:28] made it the New
[37:30] Testament now if the Old
[37:34] Testament had to be drove from the the
[37:38] rider had to be drove from his People
[37:41] Into the
[37:42] Wilderness to get inspiration to write
[37:46] the Old Testament and in the New
[37:48] Testament the
[37:50] writer was drove by the author into a
[37:54] desert place to get the inspiration to
[37:55] write the new Testament and the books
[37:58] are sealed with Seven Seals it would
[38:01] also require the same I believe in these
[38:04] days to open those seven SE to leave
[38:07] what you hold
[38:08] dear to watch you cherish a little home
[38:12] that was given me by the people and
[38:14] amongst all my people and friends and a
[38:16] church that was flourishing and had
[38:20] nothing
[38:22] lacking and to leave that pull right
[38:25] away from it and move away out into a
[38:27] desert where you knew no body and
[38:29] everything against you but there's
[38:33] something about God that he drives a man
[38:36] to do things that's beyond any thinking
[38:38] of his own so it can be to the glory and
[38:41] honor of
[38:43] God and I feel that not self honor but I
[38:48] I feel the privilege it it was to leave
[38:51] everything that was called dear to me
[38:53] Amen to get here into this Wilderness
[38:55] and suffer like I have never suffered in
[38:57] my life here in this Wilderness or this
[39:00] desert but I believe that in doing that
[39:03] and obeying what God commanded to be
[39:06] done God has opened to us the mysteries
[39:09] of this last days amen and we are
[39:13] here uh with this
[39:16] message now there was many people who
[39:19] followed me and that's not unusual
[39:23] usually a person we people love one
[39:26] another and love will drive you to do
[39:29] things you don't think you would do
[39:31] that's right and many of you let your
[39:33] homes you left all just to go come out
[39:35] here in the desert many has called me
[39:38] many has asked me shall we come to
[39:41] Arizona would it be a good place for us
[39:44] well as it was said about Moses and then
[39:47] it was no place of fruit no place of
[39:50] pomeg Grant here there's not much work
[39:53] to do and living is high the cost of
[39:56] living is high it's a really a rough
[39:59] place to live as Tucson Arizona wages
[40:02] are poor and and food is high and rent
[40:06] it's it's a horrible place to live in
[40:09] that manner but it's healthy it's
[40:12] dry and we sometimes we mustn't get our
[40:17] minds fashioned on things of this Earth
[40:20] we must look to the leading of the Holy
[40:22] Spirit but one thing that troubled me in
[40:25] coming here and telling people well you
[40:28] should not come or you should come that
[40:31] I leave up to each individual the way
[40:34] God leads that individual to
[40:37] do I think every one of us should do
[40:39] that be led by the spirit on what to
[40:43] do and many of you here from around
[40:45] Jeffersonville and other congregation
[40:47] there and you have uh come out
[40:51] here now the thing that bothered me was
[40:54] a place of worship
[40:58] and I realize as I read in the scripture
[41:00] here of Stevens and is addressed just
[41:03] before his death or they stoned him
[41:06] immediately afterwards for his
[41:08] message as he was speaking he said our
[41:13] fathers talking of the Hebrews in the
[41:15] early days how that they tried to find
[41:18] favor before God to build a place for
[41:23] worship he said that Solomon build him a
[41:27] house or a building we're acquainted
[41:31] with the story but I like his next words
[41:34] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[41:38] houses that's made with
[41:40] hands and another place over in Isaiah
[41:44] he said a body has thou prepared
[41:49] me sacrifice and offerings and buildings
[41:52] and so forth but a body H has thou
[41:54] prepared me well we realize that he was
[41:57] speaking then of the body where God
[42:00] tabernacled in Christ but I believe
[42:03] today that the inspiration that's come
[42:06] to to brother
[42:09] green to move here him and Sister Green
[42:12] Giving up their place back in the East
[42:16] also to back in Texas to come here with
[42:21] the start with
[42:22] nothing just simply by an inspiration
[42:26] feeling that they should do
[42:29] it I appreciate man that will follow the
[42:33] leading of Christ regardless of the
[42:37] cost they cost
[42:39] them though the whole world maybe your
[42:42] very best friends think that you're
[42:45] wrong but it isn't wrong to
[42:49] you as long as you feel there's
[42:51] something behind it that's God moving
[42:54] you it's never wrong
[42:57] and it'll always pan out
[43:00] right see this young couple a talented
[43:02] young man and S this because he's
[43:04] sitting here this young lady with her
[43:08] babies his family to raise good his job
[43:11] and everything to move
[43:13] here I realized that years ago I was
[43:17] called the ministry I've never made a
[43:20] successful Pastor because I got a Roman
[43:24] rambling spirit
[43:26] I can't be satisfied anywhere just
[43:29] wherever the spirit moves I just got to
[43:31] move with it because I have a
[43:35] message Jesus said I must preach in this
[43:38] other Town also but there are those who
[43:41] are Shepherds that watch The
[43:45] Flock I'm so grateful that brother Perry
[43:49] followed the leading of the Holy Spirit
[43:52] and today we have a tabernacle
[43:57] it's a small one that's just good enough
[43:59] to start with let's see what the Holy
[44:01] Spirit not knowing let's just move step
[44:03] by step now I
[44:07] believe if God has spoke to brother and
[44:10] sister green to come
[44:13] here and it's opened up a place where
[44:16] our children instead of on Sunday
[44:17] morning ride their bicycles and own the
[44:20] streets and run around they have a place
[44:22] to come to worship instead of us sitting
[44:24] around listening to something think that
[44:26] we've heard on radio which is all right
[44:29] but we as this group of people we have a
[44:33] message for this day we we believe that
[44:36] God has given us a message and brother
[44:39] green
[44:41] is I don't want to call you my
[44:44] associate because we are well it is also
[44:47] my associate we are together in this
[44:50] message brother green preaches the same
[44:52] thing the message that I believe in amen
[44:55] he's left his home he's left his people
[44:57] he's left his church he was a uh believe
[45:00] he's a district superintendent or
[45:01] something of one of the organizations
[45:03] and give a whole thing up when he heard
[45:05] this he left everything that was dear to
[45:08] him also to come to the desert just to
[45:10] support what God is giving to us
[45:15] now I say I believe it's a not only
[45:18] should be in our
[45:20] hearts it should be our duty to back him
[45:23] up everything that we can attend the
[45:26] services to come here to worship and to
[45:29] make this a place uh where God can
[45:33] reveal to us the things that he has for
[45:36] us to reveal and as his word said the
[45:39] message doesn't come to me through the
[45:42] giving of the inspiration as it does to
[45:46] maybe to some of us but he said I'm here
[45:49] to back up what God has
[45:52] given what a
[45:54] statement and I I believe if we will all
[45:58] cooperate together we'll put our hearts
[46:01] to
[46:02] it I'm old at each one of you if you
[46:06] feel like I
[46:08] do I am so hungry to see the spirit of
[46:13] God
[46:14] moving I just can't hardly stand
[46:18] it some
[46:20] experiences I've just had up in the
[46:23] mountain just to feel that once again
[46:28] that's something that when I was first
[46:30] saved that was so glorious to my heart
[46:33] and we can come into a place we can set
[46:36] and we see it among us that we're
[46:40] drying as we said you're in the desert I
[46:43] get among my brother they talk with me
[46:45] and I talk with them always in a little
[46:48] way of watching dealing out there with
[46:50] the spirit as it was to see just the
[46:53] condition of that brother to see what's
[46:54] wrong I I begin to feel us all reclining
[46:58] getting away from the spirit it's become
[47:00] too natural a thing to us we must
[47:04] Worship in the spirit amen for the
[47:06] spirit of God not only our message
[47:08] should be the flame of the hour it
[47:11] should be the flame in our hearts amen
[47:14] see it's got to be in our hearts or we
[47:16] can't we can't rightly present it to the
[47:20] people the spirit has to pack the
[47:22] message
[47:24] itself and I'm trusting and believing in
[47:27] every one of you to be a real
[47:29] Christian now there they need Sunday
[47:31] school teachers they're going to need a
[47:34] STA and I want to say this so that
[47:37] you'll thoroughly
[47:40] understand this is my
[47:45] church I've been here three
[47:48] years and I've had one door open to me
[47:51] that was brother Mackie asked me to come
[47:54] preach God bless him I haven't been
[47:56] invited by any other people not nothing
[47:59] against them they're all right brother
[48:02] Brock a good friend of mine brother
[48:04] Gilmore many of these Pentecostal
[48:05] Brethren here are very very deep good
[48:08] friends of mine I love them nothing
[48:10] against them I understand their position
[48:13] they can't invite me in there and then
[48:15] remain in their
[48:16] organization see they can't do it
[48:20] because if they do they're kicked
[48:22] out so you see their position huh had
[48:25] the same thing to face but mine may it
[48:29] always be seek ye first the kingdom of
[48:32] God the will of God and now that brother
[48:35] green God has sent him in here and open
[48:37] us up a
[48:38] church of like Precious faith that we
[48:41] believe him we are to be very grateful
[48:43] to God attend every service take every
[48:47] place that we can and if we're asked to
[48:51] call on to pray to seek to do let's be
[48:55] so not at the just anxious to do
[48:58] it keep the message honorable live the
[49:02] right kind of life don't let no smut
[49:03] come up on it we're living too late now
[49:06] amen we're too late in the hour let's
[49:09] live it clean on my life your life all
[49:12] of our Lives needs to be picked up
[49:14] before
[49:15] God our young people just ride around
[49:19] from place to place and show to show and
[49:22] drifting further and further away from
[49:24] God like
[49:26] now that's the
[49:28] truth I see my children there and I see
[49:32] myself getting to a place where not you
[49:35] you got to assemble ourselves together
[49:37] to worship God the Bible said so when we
[49:40] see this day approaching that much more
[49:42] come together if there's only two people
[49:44] here you be one of
[49:45] them now that's and if we come together
[49:48] and worship together then we just
[49:50] something other about it Jesus said
[49:52] where two or three are gathered in my
[49:53] name there I am in they me now as I've
[49:56] said before brother green told me and he
[49:59] said it my wife come told me what he
[50:01] said when I was
[50:02] away that uh he said this morning the
[50:07] pit was open at any time now usually
[50:10] that's open for me to speak I usually I
[50:14] had to drive all the way to
[50:15] Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message
[50:17] that God gave me Amen to bring it to the
[50:21] God gives me a message I can walk right
[50:22] here to pit and preach and feel free
[50:24] today
[50:26] and I believe by that that God Almighty
[50:29] will bless you if you will just stand by
[50:32] this church now this group of people not
[50:36] only that but let's go
[50:39] out and see if we can't get others to
[50:43] come in see let's speak to others
[50:45] everywhere speak to them about our
[50:47] church what it means what our church
[50:50] we're here we want you to come bring in
[50:52] strangers and I'm sure it'll be good for
[50:54] all of us see we have a building which
[50:57] we're thankful for we're thankful for
[51:00] this place together together but how be
[51:02] it the most high dwelleth not in temples
[51:06] made with hand see for Heaven is my
[51:10] throne and Earth is my foot stool and
[51:12] where is the place of my rest but a body
[51:15] has thou prepared me for and we are a
[51:18] body of
[51:19] Christ so as we move from one building
[51:23] to another building I believe and
[51:25] hanging our messages and we'll come down
[51:27] and have healing services and anything
[51:29] the Lord reveals to us to do we have it
[51:31] right here in the church until it swells
[51:33] out to the big we have to take it
[51:34] somewhere else and somewhere else until
[51:36] Jesus comes amen God bless
[51:45] Youk how many feel that was
[51:48] timely I mean that just I'll tell
[51:51] you there's just nothing like the voice
[51:55] did you hear it he said we're here to
[51:57] follow the message that's what we feed
[52:01] on we're not here to try to create a new
[52:04] atmosphere a new move of the Spirit uh
[52:08] some sort of sensation or uh come up
[52:13] with a interpretation we're here to feed
[52:17] on the message and it just takes all of
[52:20] us together so I hope you understood
[52:23] what I said as he talked about the
[52:25] people that sacrifice what it cost to
[52:28] sacrifice what it cost to be dedicated
[52:32] and what it cost to make yourself a part
[52:35] of something and that's kind of the
[52:38] spirit today everybody wants to be not
[52:43] tied down not dedicated they just want
[52:47] to uh be uh free they they don't want to
[52:52] they don't want to serve a master choose
[52:55] whom they're going to serve it's just
[52:57] the age of
[52:59] lukewarm and we've got to understand
[53:02] that that that's
[53:03] the spirit of uninvolvement and unattach
[53:08] and un uncommit make uh things for our
[53:12] young people and and and really to bring
[53:16] the spirit of the Lord that we can
[53:19] worship in the spirit and so when we
[53:22] come to
[53:23] Service uh you know our messenger taught
[53:26] us if we could get here a little early
[53:29] and sit down and read our Bible and pray
[53:31] and get in the spirit till you feel the
[53:35] anointing you feel the unction of the
[53:37] spirit you you can almost uh if you get
[53:41] in the spirit you could almost have the
[53:43] mind of Christ and and the minister will
[53:45] come up and you'll say oh that's just
[53:47] what I read I that's just what I was
[53:49] thinking the Lord spoke to my heart and
[53:52] you're one and I I just feel that that's
[53:55] a a really beautiful message it's
[53:57] something that you can certainly go back
[54:00] and listen to again at at and uh Listen
[54:05] to If I could say that the the the
[54:08] message uh between the lines of what it
[54:11] is he's saying and just think he said if
[54:14] I didn't come out here we wouldn't had
[54:16] those seals open you know and he said
[54:21] you know he just really he didn't say
[54:23] too many good things about TUC son you
[54:25] know but it's where God led him so he
[54:29] was willing to
[54:31] take everything that sacrifice he had to
[54:35] make in order to keep the will of the
[54:37] Lord so we just trust that it is God
[54:40] bless you tonight uh let's stand
[54:42] together and uh our next Sunday will I
[54:47] think is uh Christmas Eve and so we'll
[54:50] have one service at uh uh 10:00 we'll
[54:54] try not to keep it too long and and uh
[54:58] we won't uh have uh service that
[55:03] Wednesday before Christmas because you
[55:05] all have to go out and buy your pastor
[55:08] present so we want to leave that thing
[55:11] open for shopping no I don't need any
[55:15] stuff okay so uh you find somebody that
[55:18] doesn't have anybody or doesn't have a
[55:21] father or a a widow and you get them a
[55:25] present okay I know you love me and I
[55:28] love you so I don't need anything so um
[55:33] uh so don't uh don't get me anything

[55:39] plaques I don't need any statues I don't
[55:42] need any pictures I don't need any
[55:45] socks I I don't need anything so find

[56:29] your
[56:29] word and that you can speak to our
[56:32] hearts and speak to our attitudes and
