[11:53] we ask these things in the lovely name
[11:54] of the lord jesus christ
[11:58] amen sister linsley's got a
[12:03] testimony she wants to come at this time
[12:05] you may have your sins god bless you
[12:52] god bless you
[12:56] i'd like to give two testimonies first
[12:59] to give god
[12:59] all the praise and the glory secondly
[13:02] the testimonies are because two other
[13:04] people gave their testimonies
[13:06] so may this be an encouragement for us
[13:08] to share our testimonies no matter how
[13:10] big or small they may be
[13:12] you don't know whose life they may
[13:18] change
[13:21] about 15 years ago i backslid
[13:24] i moved out of my parents home and did
[13:26] my own thing for a few years
[13:28] during this time my grandpa had a dream
[13:32] he had a dream that i had died in a red
[13:34] car
[13:35] during that time i had gotten a red car
[13:40] not that long ago brother moses
[13:42] ministered here
[13:44] he shared a testimony about a brother
[13:45] who called him one evening
[13:47] all upset because his wife had a dream
[13:49] that brother moses died
[13:52] immediately the lord comforted brother
[13:54] moses brother moses proceeded to tell
[13:56] him that he couldn't die
[13:57] because he had already died he died to
[14:00] the world a long time ago
[14:02] he told the brother good night and went
[14:05] on to have a peaceful rest that night
[14:06] with no fear of his life being in danger
[14:09] right away the lord quickened to me
[14:13] my grandpa's dream and how the family
[14:17] and i have lived with a little fear in
[14:18] the back of our minds that getting into
[14:20] a red vehicle
[14:22] which i definitely avoided at all
[14:25] possible
[14:28] i'm sorry
[14:35] back then after a few years in the world
[14:37] the lord gave me the opportunity to get
[14:39] out of the life of sin i was living in
[14:41] and i knew in my heart it was time one
[14:44] of the very last things i did before
[14:46] leaving was get rid of the red car i was
[14:48] driving
[14:49] i believe in my grandpa's dream the red
[14:51] car was a symbol
[14:52] that i was headed to a spiritual death
[14:54] and getting rid of it was the end
[14:56] to dying of that life to rededicate my
[15:00] life
[15:00] and live a life for god after service i
[15:03] shared this with my husband and we both
[15:05] agreed
[15:06] we shared this i'm sorry we were just so
[15:09] thankful
[15:10] to the lord for this burden lift that i
[15:13] have carried for so long
[15:15] for so many years to be completely
[15:16] lifted
[15:18] the very next day we were picking up an
[15:22] suv rental for a long road trip we were
[15:24] taking
[15:26] normally where we would go you can
[15:28] choose your own vehicle
[15:30] but this time we chose to go with a
[15:32] different place because of their pricing
[15:34] when we arrived the guy only had
[15:38] one vehicle left
[15:41] and we picked up our keys walked out and
[15:44] it was a
[15:44] red suv by the grace of god we had a
[15:48] wonderful trip
[15:48] without any worries or anything
[15:54] all right if you don't mind i have one
[15:56] other one
[16:03] okay my second testimony comes from this
[16:05] past sunday evening
[16:09] first i'd like to thank the lord jesus
[16:11] for healing my husband and i
[16:12] from the awful combat demon this past
[16:16] sunday was our first sunday back to
[16:17] church by the grace of god
[16:20] and we are both doing wonderfully with
[16:23] many
[16:24] side symptoms left over such as
[16:28] still regaining our taste and smell and
[16:30] such
[16:31] but one symptom i was most alarmed about
[16:34] was some pain i had in my
[16:36] lungs right between the transition from
[16:38] exhaling to inhaling
[16:40] brother david junior opened up the
[16:42] service saying
[16:44] he was an expectation for the lord to do
[16:46] something that night
[16:47] i was grateful and because it shifted my
[16:50] mindset
[16:51] and i truly was looking for something to
[16:53] happen
[16:54] not sure i just something
[16:57] sunday night sister sarah gordon gave a
[16:59] testimony of how the lord healed her
[17:01] lungs from hurting whenever she coughed
[17:04] and she tried to go singing
[17:06] now i'm not going to sing you all know
[17:08] my husband does that
[17:12] even though my symptoms wasn't exactly
[17:14] the same
[17:15] i held on to her testimony for the lord
[17:17] to heal my lungs
[17:19] i went through the rest of the service
[17:21] not feeling much different even a few
[17:23] times having to remind myself to take a
[17:25] deep breath
[17:27] but i kept on believing when we got to
[17:30] the
[17:31] end and we were singing songs of worship
[17:34] i sang to the lord
[17:35] with a deeper sincerity that only the
[17:38] lord would have given me
[17:39] i thought maybe this was it but this
[17:42] time
[17:43] it was truly just all worshiping the
[17:46] lord
[17:47] after we got home that evening i went to
[17:49] text sister sarah
[17:51] this is what i said i appreciate your
[17:55] testimony about your lungs
[17:56] thank you so much for sharing i'm
[17:59] believing
[18:00] and have accepted my healing for my
[18:03] lungs
[18:04] as i typed the last part my lungs felt
[18:07] different
[18:09] i continued on typing another line
[18:14] something about i'm just waiting for my
[18:16] lungs to catch up to the faith or
[18:18] something like that
[18:19] but before i sent it i paused because i
[18:22] knew
[18:22] something was different i had
[18:26] taken some short breaths over and over
[18:30] because i wasn't sure if the pain really
[18:31] was gone or if i was just
[18:34] imagining it but i went ahead and
[18:37] deleted that last line
[18:39] and i sent it and i kept taking a bunch
[18:42] of breasts
[18:44] and i was not imagining it quickly my
[18:47] eyes filled with tears
[18:48] i got up and went around the corner to
[18:51] where randy was cooking up some eggs i
[18:53] believe
[18:54] and if you know anything about him he
[18:56] enjoys being in the kitchen
[18:59] i came around the corner and said randy
[19:02] with my eye my tear-filled eyes tapping
[19:05] on my lungs
[19:07] i was afraid to say anything and he just
[19:10] looks at me and asks
[19:11] can you breathe better and i just nodded
[19:15] my head and said i believe the lord just
[19:18] healed my lungs
[19:20] we just thanked the lord and went on i
[19:22] just couldn't believe it i wasn't doing
[19:24] anything special
[19:25] just simply sitting there sending a text
[19:30] but what i do know is i truly believe
[19:33] believed what i said
[19:36] you can imagine much to my amazement
[19:38] when i woke the next morning
[19:40] i still had no pain and by the grace of
[19:43] god i still have no pain
[19:46] thank you lord jesus for your
[19:48] deliverance
[19:50] and your divine healing power that is

[29:21] our hearts not burn within us while you
[29:23] speak to us father
[29:25] we just thank you lord i'm just a man
[29:28] your prophet said to open the pages of
[29:30] the bible it just requires a human hand
[29:33] or a muscle
[29:35] but for the holy spirit to interpret it
[29:37] he's the only one that can do that lord
[29:40] so take control of our beings and our
[29:42] minds
[29:43] anoint our hearts our ears to listen to

[30:02] failed the hands of the lord jesus
[30:04] christ
[30:06] amen god bless you tonight saints while
[30:09] we're standing we'll just read the
[30:11] scripture
[30:12] it's a blessing to be in the house of
[30:14] god one more time
[30:18] aren't you happy amen
[30:23] may god bless you tonight let's just
[30:25] open our bibles
[30:27] in the book of isaiah chapter 55 and
[30:34] we're going to read from verse 8 to
[30:36] verse
[30:37] 11 isaiah chapter 55
[30:42] from verse 8 to verse 11.
[30:47] that's what the word of god says
[30:51] he says for my thoughts and not your
[30:54] thoughts
[30:55] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[30:58] lord
[31:00] for as the heavens are higher than the
[31:02] earth
[31:03] so are my ways higher than your ways
[31:06] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[31:09] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[31:12] from heaven
[31:14] and returneth not heather but watereth
[31:17] the earth
[31:18] and maketh it bring forth and bud
[31:21] that it may give seed to the sower and
[31:24] bread to the eater
[31:26] so shall my word that goeth forth
[31:30] out of my mouth it shall not
[31:33] return unto me void but it shall
[31:36] accomplish that which i please
[31:40] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[31:43] to i sent it lord anointed bless your
[31:46] word in jesus name we pray
[31:48] amen you may be seated as
[31:51] we it's such a blessing to be in the
[31:54] house of the lord
[31:56] you know it's different when you're
[31:57] sitting down down there you know
[31:59] and it's different when you're standing
[32:01] up up here
[32:02] but i'm thankful to god because he
[32:05] helped me one day
[32:07] understand how this is i was in oklahoma
[32:10] and i had to
[32:11] translate for a brother and i was very
[32:14] nervous
[32:15] i said brother i i don't feel
[32:18] comfortable i just feel nervous because
[32:20] it's the word of god your feet get to
[32:22] shake and you
[32:23] start having the butterflies in your
[32:24] stomach and
[32:26] but while he was standing there about to
[32:29] preach
[32:30] something told me if he doesn't speak
[32:32] you don't speak
[32:34] so why are you worried and i thought
[32:38] about it i said why have i
[32:39] been so upset and worried for nothing
[32:43] if that brother doesn't speak i don't
[32:45] have to say anything
[32:47] so i can just stand here anyway they're
[32:49] not going to blame me
[32:52] but if he speaks and i have to say what
[32:54] he says
[32:56] he said but what is it like when we
[32:59] yield to the spirit of god
[33:02] if he doesn't speak i don't have to say
[33:04] anything
[33:06] amen so i have peace of mind to know
[33:10] that i can say let's read the word and
[33:12] we go home
[33:14] if he doesn't say anything i don't have
[33:16] to say anything
[33:17] because i cannot make up something just
[33:19] because i'm here
[33:21] but when i learn that it's all because
[33:23] the spirit of god is willing to speak to
[33:25] a child of god
[33:27] and i'm just a vessel a channel that he
[33:29] wants to use then i get quiet
[33:32] and i relax and i have peace
[33:35] because it's not my duty it's the duty
[33:38] of the holy spirit
[33:41] one day i had to come to church here
[33:43] about
[33:44] eight or nine years ago and i was in
[33:46] wichita falls
[33:48] i didn't have any money to put gas in my
[33:51] car
[33:52] but it was a sunday morning and i wanted
[33:54] to come to church because the whole
[33:55] night i was
[33:56] thinking how i'm going to be in church
[33:57] sunday morning
[33:59] but i said i don't have any money so i
[34:02] woke up that morning
[34:04] and i said well i'll just stay home i
[34:06] read the scripture
[34:07] my heart was just trouble i started
[34:10] turning on the bed and walking in the
[34:12] room i said lord
[34:13] i so i went to the bathroom and i
[34:15] dressed up and i said i'm going to go to
[34:17] church somewhere
[34:18] i say it doesn't matter where i go and i
[34:21] i dressed up i wore my shirt my pants
[34:23] put my
[34:24] tie on i was walking down the street
[34:27] but right before i made a left of my
[34:29] apartment there was a man sitting there
[34:30] smoking
[34:32] and someone said stop and have church
[34:34] without man i said no
[34:38] how am i gonna waste a whole sunday
[34:40] morning
[34:42] sitting down with this guy who's smoking
[34:44] in front of his porch anyway
[34:46] i know i better go to church and
[34:49] i started walking away from him
[34:50] something said go to church with that
[34:52] guy
[34:54] i said lord i want to waste the whole
[34:56] morning like this
[34:58] i just go back and i turn around i went
[35:00] to the guy i said how you do it so when
[35:02] he saw me i had my bible in my hand he'd
[35:04] just flip your cigarette turn it off and
[35:05] put it under his foot
[35:09] i said how are you doing he said well
[35:10] i'm not a bad man i said i haven't said
[35:14] anything
[35:17] well he still had that little puff
[35:19] coming out of his mouth so he kind of
[35:21] blew it far away pretty quick saying you
[35:22] know i used to go to church before i
[35:24] said i haven't said anything
[35:29] but you know the man in his own self
[35:31] knew he was doing something wrong
[35:34] i hadn't spoken anything yet
[35:37] but because he knows what the word of
[35:39] god says
[35:41] and i was holding the bible in my hand i
[35:43] hadn't spoken the word
[35:45] and something within him started talking
[35:47] to him
[35:50] and so he invited me and he said come on
[35:51] seven maybe we started talking he said
[35:53] you know i used to go to church before
[35:54] and i had experiences with the lord and
[35:56] something happened and i just kind of
[35:59] walked away
[36:00] you know and one thing led to another
[36:03] and i started drinking i started smoking
[36:05] said
[36:05] but i love the lord jesus
[36:09] he said you might come into my house
[36:11] tomorrow i say oh yeah i'm coming
[36:12] tomorrow
[36:14] so we started being friends i started
[36:16] visiting him and one day i come there
[36:18] he's cooking
[36:20] he said i'm cooking just for you he said
[36:23] there's been some people come here
[36:24] trying to preach to me and jehovah
[36:26] witness and everything say but i don't
[36:28] like those people i say hey i'm not
[36:30] trying to say hate somebody now i just
[36:32] want to come visit i don't know if you
[36:33] i'm different or anything
[36:35] is that there's something different
[36:36] about you
[36:38] i said okay then he goes around
[36:44] where he smokes you know where to turn
[36:46] put your ass your ass straight
[36:48] right beside the ashtray was this thing
[36:54] he said well i want to he took it off he
[36:56] started dusting it like this
[36:58] he said i want you to use this and put
[37:00] in your bible
[37:02] when i took a hold of it i said what
[37:05] i smelled it oh my goodness i couldn't
[37:07] even stand it
[37:09] i said okay i just took it i didn't say
[37:12] anything you know
[37:13] but if my mother said there's not a day
[37:16] in the world
[37:17] i'm putting that thing in my bible
[37:20] because it smells like cigarette it's
[37:22] all dirty never
[37:24] am i gonna put that in my bible but i
[37:26] took it
[37:28] i went home and one day i was reading
[37:31] and i didn't find nothing to put in my
[37:34] bible
[37:36] and i stuck it there and i forgot it and
[37:38] i started switching pages and switching
[37:40] pages and then
[37:42] one day it just hit me oh that thing is
[37:45] in your bible
[37:47] i said man let me go grab it out so i
[37:50] went real quick and i took it out i said
[37:52] oh my god i put this
[37:58] it wasn't smelling anymore
[38:01] and i smelled it again i said i wasn't
[38:05] smelling anymore
[38:08] and something hit me right there if you
[38:11] stay in the word of god
[38:14] whether you want it or not unconsciously
[38:17] the word of god begins to work on you
[38:22] brother peter was walking with jesus and
[38:24] he didn't know
[38:25] that jesus was transforming him little
[38:28] by little
[38:30] to the point where his rough language
[38:32] and way of speaking
[38:33] was changing and he didn't even know it
[38:37] and one day when he got to where they
[38:39] asked him
[38:40] were you not with him oh no i was not
[38:42] with that guy
[38:44] hmm then he went somewhere else and i
[38:48] asked him again
[38:49] were you not with that guy he said no
[38:52] then i said but you speak like one of
[38:54] them so how did they speak
[38:58] they had a particular way of speaking
[39:01] hallelujah the change was already
[39:04] happening
[39:05] because he was hanging around to change
[39:07] our lives
[39:10] and he didn't even realize the way he
[39:12] was speaking had changed
[39:14] he took somebody else to see that
[39:20] so tonight while you're sitting in the
[39:21] presence of the word of god
[39:24] be conscious that this world has power
[39:26] to change you
[39:28] this world has power to come where you
[39:30] are and meet you at the point of your
[39:31] need
[39:34] oh for my thoughts and not your thoughts
[39:39] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[39:41] lord not a man
[39:44] for as the heavens are higher than the
[39:46] earth
[39:47] so are my ways higher than your ways
[39:51] and my thoughts higher than your
[39:53] thoughts
[39:54] we have to go into that before we
[39:56] proceed
[39:57] amen as long as it's way over there
[40:01] is the thought of god as long as it's
[40:04] way out there
[40:05] we don't have access to it so it
[40:09] requires somebody to go up into that
[40:11] atmosphere
[40:12] and to catch the thought of god and then
[40:15] he has to come all the way down here
[40:16] again
[40:17] and give that thought to us
[40:21] but god is wanting to influence the
[40:23] happenings of the earth
[40:27] and being up there he has to do
[40:29] something but he put a law and said
[40:31] god cannot do anything on the earth
[40:34] without first revealing his secrets to
[40:37] his servants the prophets
[40:39] so the prophet can cast the thought of
[40:42] god
[40:43] hallelujah and bring it down to us
[40:47] so if you want to know what god is
[40:48] wanting to do on the earth
[40:50] you have to locate the prophet of god
[40:53] and he can tell you what the invisible
[40:56] god
[40:57] is trying to do on the earth
[41:02] how we follow it he's still way out
[41:04] there but somebody has access to it
[41:08] and it brings it down to you because god
[41:11] wants you to know
[41:12] what he's wanting to do
[41:17] deuteronomy says
[41:20] the secret things belong to the lord
[41:23] but those that are revealed belong to us
[41:29] he belongs to us and to our children
[41:33] so we can do the will of god
[41:36] now how can you do the will of god if
[41:38] you don't know it
[41:39] if it's hidden how would you know it and
[41:42] god's desire
[41:44] is for his will to be known by you and i
[41:48] so he's not a mysterious out there
[41:50] hidden oh
[41:52] far away god he wants to be known by you
[41:56] and i
[41:58] therefore the rain cometh down
[42:02] and the snow from heaven and return it
[42:05] not
[42:06] heather but waters the earth
[42:09] and maketh it bring forth and blood
[42:13] that it may give seed to the sower and
[42:16] bread to the eater he says so
[42:19] shall my word that goes forth
[42:23] out of my mouth it shall not return void
[42:30] so all god has to do
[42:33] is to let loose of his word all god has
[42:37] to do
[42:38] is to say one thing to your life
[42:41] because it comes from eternity he cannot
[42:44] return to eternity
[42:46] without fulfilling why god sent it
[42:51] so when you take the whole of the word
[42:53] of god
[42:54] and you hang on your whole life to it
[42:58] hallelujah that word cannot go back
[43:02] without fulfilling exactly why it was
[43:05] sent forth
[43:07] it was a sick person hear the word of
[43:09] god
[43:10] he was wounded for your transgressions
[43:13] he was bruised for your inequity
[43:16] hi let's read it in fact i'm just
[43:21] hallelujah isaiah 53 5.
[43:26] but he was wounded for our
[43:28] transgressions
[43:29] he was bruised for our iniquity
[43:33] of our peace was upon him and with his
[43:35] tribes
[43:36] we are here
[43:40] i have a grandma and wished our faults i
[43:43] met her many years ago that's having a
[43:44] testimony for another time
[43:47] so when i went to hell my back's hurting
[43:49] my neck's hurting
[43:50] pray for me my and i had to pray for
[43:53] grandma all the time
[43:55] and god healed her every time so one day
[43:58] i said
[43:58] what if i'm not here how she gonna do it
[44:02] so i said grandma what if i'm not here
[44:04] he said i'll call you
[44:08] i said what if you call me and my phone
[44:09] doesn't work should i leave you a
[44:11] voicemail
[44:12] i said what if i don't answer you i'll
[44:15] just wait and i'll call you again
[44:18] she's from kentucky so she's hardheaded
[44:23] i said well grandma i've got to talk to
[44:25] you she said what moses what are you
[44:27] going to tell me
[44:28] i said grandma sit down here you know
[44:29] i'm a nurse she said i know you're a
[44:31] nurse
[44:32] say grandma i want to give you a pee
[44:34] that works every time
[44:35] there's no overdose with this pill and
[44:38] you can take it however you want it
[44:40] he said what's that new pill you're
[44:41] going to show me
[44:44] i said grandma's not a new appeals at
[44:48] godspeed
[44:50] she said what is it i say grandma's
[44:51] isaiah 50 35. she said oh
[44:54] i know it since i was a little girl
[44:57] i said wonderful grandma you knew it but
[45:00] now you've got to use it
[45:04] so i take it in the morning in the
[45:06] afternoon at night
[45:08] let me know how it works so about four
[45:11] or five days she called me
[45:12] oh my mo can you come home i said
[45:14] grandma you took the pill
[45:17] she said hold on i'll take it and i'll
[45:18] call you back i said okay
[45:22] she hung up she never called me back
[45:27] so i called her the next day i said hey
[45:29] grandma
[45:30] how you feeling say oh i'm doing good i
[45:33] thought the pill worked she said oh yeah
[45:38] so grandma's call started dropping she
[45:41] didn't call me for that it was different
[45:42] stuff
[45:44] because you have to be anchored to the
[45:45] word of god
[45:47] in the word of god there's power to
[45:49] bring about what it says he will do
[45:56] and we let it at that
[45:59] but he says his word shall not return
[46:02] void
[46:03] but it will fulfill the purpose
[46:06] for which it's sent and it will
[46:10] prosper in the thing where onto
[46:13] head
[46:16] so if the word of god is somewhere
[46:19] hallelujah
[46:20] you can't expect it to prosper anything
[46:23] way onto its hand
[46:27] because the word of god is not
[46:28] interested to stay in the book
[46:31] the bible does not go to the rapture
[46:35] the cds are not going to the rapture
[46:39] the tape is not going to the rapture
[46:44] who then is going
[46:47] hallelujah we got kind of quiet there
[46:50] for a minute
[46:54] he shall not return to him void
[46:59] let's read another scripture
[47:02] isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14.
[47:18] i'm not very good at giving titles to
[47:20] sermon but
[47:22] as we go we just find one
[47:26] isaiah 7 14
[47:30] says therefore the lord himself shall
[47:32] give you a sign
[47:35] behold a virgin shall conceive
[47:38] and bear a son and shall call his name
[47:42] emmanuel i don't know about you
[47:45] but for the past days i've just been
[47:47] rejoicing in the world
[47:50] i'm sitting there i feel like just
[47:52] jumping through the roof
[47:54] because i can hear god speaking to me
[47:58] and i see how the spirit of god is
[48:00] walking in continuity
[48:04] because you're to say oh is it just the
[48:06] services i will travel to another town
[48:10] for morning service sunday and i'll come
[48:12] sit here sunday night
[48:14] and they are preaching to me the same
[48:16] semen i had sunday morning
[48:20] so you wonder why is he screaming i'm
[48:22] not screaming because i love to scream
[48:23] brother
[48:25] but you are sitting here sunday morning
[48:28] you travel two hours away
[48:30] and they preach to you the same sermon
[48:32] over again
[48:34] and it's not one time it's not two times
[48:37] so do you expect me to just sit back and
[48:39] say oh we're just fine and everything's
[48:41] just cool
[48:43] no because i see the spirit of god
[48:47] leading to something
[48:50] amen and you must follow the leading of
[48:54] the spirit of god
[48:58] and we see him working oh
[49:03] therefore the lord himself shall give
[49:05] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[49:07] conceive
[49:08] and bear a son and shall call his name
[49:11] emmanuel
[49:13] isaiah said over there the thoughts of
[49:15] god
[49:16] they are high over there
[49:20] and his ways are not our ways
[49:23] but now we see him again seeing a vision
[49:28] because this man of all like first peter
[49:32] says
[49:32] they did not prophesy by themselves but
[49:36] they were moved by the holy spirit
[49:39] and they prophesied so isaiah is
[49:43] watching
[49:43] something unfolding and he sees a
[49:47] young lady walking down the road let's
[49:49] say virgin he sees her pregnant
[49:52] oh wow oh then he comes down here
[49:56] and he speaks behold
[49:59] a virgin shall conceive he just caught
[50:02] the thought of god
[50:04] and now he's speaking it
[50:08] amen and that word he speaks
[50:13] then he himself he dies
[50:16] but because the giver of the word was
[50:19] god
[50:20] that word cannot fail
[50:24] and that word cannot return to eternity
[50:27] without fulfilling its purpose on the
[50:29] earth
[50:31] so it slept for a hundred years 200
[50:35] years
[50:35] hallelujah when he spoke it they say oh
[50:39] i say you've got some little problems
[50:40] there because uh
[50:41] our biology teacher didn't teach us like
[50:43] that
[50:45] in the science class that's not what
[50:47] they said
[50:49] you know you you've got to go through
[50:51] the process
[50:54] but that's not what it is isaiah what
[50:57] are we talking about
[50:59] but the word of god is not to be
[51:00] reasoned
[51:02] it's not to be a calculator it's to be
[51:06] believed
[51:08] how prophecy only believed because
[51:11] all things are possible to them that
[51:13] believe and isaiah spoke the word of god
[51:16] and he continued on and he said baby
[51:19] it's going to happen
[51:20] no no no no no he said please talk the
[51:23] word of god
[51:24] and that was it a hundred years
[51:28] 200 300 400
[51:31] that word was traveling
[51:36] do you know that that word was even
[51:38] faster than time
[51:40] time had to catch up to it
[51:44] because when god speaks his word it's
[51:46] present tense
[51:51] hallelujah that's why you can start
[51:53] rejoicing when you get a word from god
[51:57] when john ryan came to the prayer line
[52:00] the brother said
[52:01] do you believe you say yeah i believe
[52:03] said god healed you
[52:04] go to your seat he goes sit down he get
[52:07] up he said
[52:08] pastor you said i i see
[52:13] the brother said you said you believe
[52:17] so he wanted to put the revolution on
[52:19] the prophet
[52:21] and they reminded him you are the
[52:22] believer
[52:24] he kind of scratched his head but when
[52:27] he caught it
[52:28] he walked outside he said praise god for
[52:31] healing me
[52:32] came back to the meeting said extra
[52:34] extra praise god for healing me
[52:37] he was still blind
[52:40] he still couldn't see but his friends
[52:43] say i see
[52:46] because the symptoms did not define the
[52:49] word of god
[52:53] he disbelieved his symptoms and he
[52:55] believed the word of god
[52:58] and he began to testify hallelujah
[53:01] i see blind man see look at him
[53:06] praise god i can see and he goes to get
[53:09] the haircut
[53:12] oh we heard you went up there to that
[53:14] meeting over there say oh oh yes
[53:17] i didn't only go to the meeting but god
[53:19] healed me in the meeting
[53:21] and he still blind and god heard him
[53:25] testify of his greatness god heard him
[53:28] in the middle of trial holding on to the
[53:30] word
[53:32] god heard him in the middle of all the
[53:35] laughter
[53:36] in the middle of all the fun in the
[53:39] middle of all
[53:44] he grabbed onto the word
[53:48] said my god is awesome
[53:52] god is awesome god is awesome
[53:57] my god is awesome even though you're
[54:00] blind
[54:00] he's great my god is great
[54:05] my god is great my god is great
[54:11] are you serious he's awesome he's
[54:13] awesome
[54:15] god said oh i can't leave that man like
[54:17] that
[54:18] i've got to come down and all know his
[54:22] faith
[54:22] he said because he's too dead hello to
[54:25] my word
[54:26] watch me bring it to pass and his eyes
[54:28] came open
[54:33] because he believed what was told to him
[54:38] so this world begin to travel over time
[54:41] 700 something years past
[54:44] somebody could have said ah isaiah you
[54:47] prophesied some weird things though
[54:48] how many years passed now are you
[54:50] serious i knew you were always
[54:52] i knew you were wrong isaiah i knew
[54:57] and then when the time of that word
[54:59] arrived
[55:02] when the time for that word to become
[55:05] reality arrived
[55:09] heaven mobilized itself
[55:13] to bring to pass that word
[55:17] because the one that promised is
[55:19] faithful
[55:21] because the one that said it his nature
[55:24] is
[55:25] unfailingness he can never fail
[55:30] he's the very definition of faithfulness
[55:34] so when the time for that word to come
[55:36] become reality
[55:39] came heaven send some messengers say go
[55:43] and
[55:43] look for the participants of this vision
[55:46] i want you to inform them
[55:49] that they are part of this vision
[55:52] the vision only said a virgin shall
[55:54] conceive
[55:56] there was no name yet
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:01] it have no name tag to it yet
[56:04] but when the moment of present tense
[56:06] arrived
[56:07] they begin to call names now they begin
[56:10] to tag names to virgin
[56:12] is no more diversion it's not systematic
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:18] and they have to come and inform sister
[56:20] mary she's part of the vision
[56:23] maybe one day she came to church oh but
[56:25] right they preach about they say oh she
[56:26] said amen to that she go home
[56:28] but she didn't know that amen was going
[56:32] to cost us something
[56:36] when you put your aim into the word of
[56:37] god brother sister
[56:39] you are signing you are saying
[56:42] i endorse this document i endorsed this
[56:45] word of god
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:47] and when she endorsed it hallelujah she
[56:50] began to go home
[56:51] then the angel came to our sister mary
[56:54] you see that vision that isaiah spoke
[56:58] about
[57:00] you see that thing that they've been
[57:01] waiting for for hundreds of years
[57:05] is is you
[57:12] the prophet she didn't question and i
[57:15] love what
[57:16] aaron said the other day is that she
[57:17] didn't question but she wanted to know
[57:21] she wanted to give me preach to me
[57:23] brother
[57:25] amen just just pray to me
[57:28] because we walk by the word of god just
[57:30] tell me what's going to happen
[57:32] said this that shall come to you is the
[57:35] holy spirit
[57:36] himself he will overshadow you
[57:41] he said what and
[57:44] that we shall be born he's called the
[57:46] son of god
[57:49] now she went to church every day and she
[57:52] did not know
[57:54] that she was the one there were many
[57:57] virgins all over the place but she was
[58:00] the one
[58:01] to bring that promise to reality
[58:05] and when she began to hear how this was
[58:07] going to happen
[58:09] she said beat it unto me
[58:14] let what you say happen to me
[58:22] let that your will happen to me
[58:26] as you say it so she let the word of god
[58:30] come in because
[58:33] it's the vision that came looking for
[58:35] her
[58:39] she didn't go looking for the vision
[58:43] it's the vision that came and told her
[58:46] you come here but i'm a bad person
[58:50] bye but but
[58:54] when the vision called for moses hey i
[58:57] can't speak good
[58:58] you know i don't
[59:04] so he begin to preach to god now
[59:07] god let me tell you something i don't
[59:10] know how to speak
[59:12] plus they won't even believe me when i
[59:14] go over there what will i say
[59:16] and god's looking at this man doing all
[59:19] his jumping and drama and
[59:24] say so you mean to tell me that i'm not
[59:28] the omniscient god
[59:30] so you mean to inform me about your
[59:32] status
[59:34] for you mean to teach me about your
[59:36] weaknesses
[59:38] so now i don't know anything and you
[59:40] know everything
[59:42] say my love for you has overridden your
[59:45] weaknesses
[59:48] say i override everything
[59:51] hallelujah say everything that you have
[59:54] mentioned
[59:55] i cancel them all
[59:59] because it's me looking for you
[1:00:02] and in the vision i saw you
[1:00:06] it was not somebody else
[1:00:10] it was you and when mary said
[1:00:14] breathe unto me i call it to your heart
[1:00:19] that word say amen itself get into
[1:00:22] sister mary
[1:00:24] now i got into her
[1:00:27] while they were revealing to her her
[1:00:29] role in the vision
[1:00:31] they even told her about her cousin
[1:00:34] she didn't ask for that information but
[1:00:37] because she was part of the vision they
[1:00:39] gave her all the details
[1:00:42] so there are people arguing about the
[1:00:44] vision over there
[1:00:45] no when he comes he'll be a military man
[1:00:48] no when it comes to be a big pastor
[1:00:50] no when it comes it'll be this and that
[1:00:52] why in the corner over there
[1:00:54] god you're telling people you do this
[1:00:56] you do that this is your role
[1:00:58] you go here you go there
[1:01:02] i mean it doesn't take your high
[1:01:05] knowledge brother
[1:01:07] it doesn't take how many years sister is
[1:01:10] the grace of god
[1:01:13] at least any man should boast
[1:01:16] it's all the grace of god
[1:01:20] did mary say oh choose me choose me
[1:01:21] choose me
[1:01:23] no why are you here tonight
[1:01:27] you yourself you got yourself ready you
[1:01:30] entered your car you drove here
[1:01:32] what drove you here
[1:01:36] something in your heart you know
[1:01:40] you could be making over time
[1:01:44] you could be doing different things
[1:01:45] right now
[1:01:47] but because tonight the vision said you
[1:01:51] were sitting where you are sitting
[1:01:53] you were dressed how you were dressed
[1:01:55] you were
[1:01:56] oh bro you yourself couldn't help it
[1:02:03] but you had to come
[1:02:07] and when the angel goes to pastor
[1:02:08] zechariah who has been praying for many
[1:02:11] years
[1:02:12] says zechariah you're going to have a
[1:02:15] son
[1:02:16] his name shall be john and they give him
[1:02:18] the details
[1:02:21] i'm kind of old you know and my wife too
[1:02:24] so
[1:02:25] we kind of took ourselves off that list
[1:02:27] we're not on the possible list
[1:02:34] i'm just trying to make it simple we
[1:02:36] just
[1:02:37] no we say so you're preaching
[1:02:40] all these years and you're praying all
[1:02:43] this time
[1:02:45] and when the time comes you're not
[1:02:47] believing
[1:02:50] say i've got some children that come to
[1:02:52] church in expectation
[1:02:54] i don't want you to preach unbelief to
[1:02:55] them you're going to be down for a few
[1:02:57] days
[1:03:00] no more preaching for zechariah while
[1:03:03] over there there's a sister
[1:03:05] she just rejoices
[1:03:10] and she says oh i've got to go find
[1:03:12] somebody else that knows about the move
[1:03:14] of god right now
[1:03:16] i've got to go and testify to elizabeth
[1:03:20] now was she physically pregnant
[1:03:26] physically she was not swollen
[1:03:30] but she had received the word of god
[1:03:33] and there's no difference to god between
[1:03:35] that and the reality
[1:03:38] and now she began to walk over there to
[1:03:40] go see her cousin elizabeth
[1:03:42] she only spoke to elizabeth
[1:03:46] the baby that was inside sister
[1:03:48] elizabeth
[1:03:52] he said hallelujah
[1:03:56] and she felt oh what is it
[1:04:00] that the mother of a lord comes to me
[1:04:03] so she was transmitting life already
[1:04:06] just by receiving the word of god
[1:04:12] she was not a spectator no she was a
[1:04:15] participant
[1:04:16] in the vision of god
[1:04:19] one of my brother's friends who's a
[1:04:21] marine brother obi
[1:04:23] he told me a story one time we used to
[1:04:24] be roommates he he had some funny
[1:04:26] stories
[1:04:27] he said brother moses when we went to
[1:04:30] training for the marine corps
[1:04:32] we had one of the the guys there one of
[1:04:36] our trainers
[1:04:38] tried to scare us try to get us kind of
[1:04:40] afraid so we can
[1:04:41] go ring the bell and we're in the
[1:04:43] bellman you quit
[1:04:45] just so we over there in the training
[1:04:46] first day he tells us hey boys
[1:04:49] i've got to tell you all right now i
[1:04:51] want to make it clear what's the
[1:04:53] difference between a participant
[1:04:54] and a spectator he said he told us the
[1:04:58] chicken and pig story i said brother
[1:05:00] we'll be shaking the pig story
[1:05:02] he said yeah let me tell you say he said
[1:05:05] there was a farm and there was a chicken
[1:05:06] and a pig
[1:05:08] and the chicken asked the pig what are
[1:05:10] we eating for breakfast
[1:05:11] the pig say i don't know she can say i
[1:05:15] have an idea
[1:05:16] let's eat eggs and bacon
[1:05:22] and the pig oh yeah sounds pretty good
[1:05:25] i like that there you go
[1:05:29] i started thinking for a minute
[1:05:32] i'm gonna be the baker in the
[1:05:35] he's gonna lay his egg and that's it
[1:05:39] but i've got to die so we eat the bacon
[1:05:43] so no let's change the menu
[1:05:48] because he knew he was going to have to
[1:05:51] die
[1:05:53] and he was not ready to die for that
[1:05:55] chicken to eat bacon
[1:05:59] that's the difference between a
[1:06:00] participant and a spectator
[1:06:04] the chicken was a spectator but the pig
[1:06:07] was the active participant
[1:06:09] in the meal
[1:06:12] because he was gonna be on the plate
[1:06:16] the chicken just lay the eggs and that's
[1:06:17] it
[1:06:20] but think about this
[1:06:24] it sounds very simple
[1:06:28] but for us to live something had to die
[1:06:34] even if you're a vegetarian
[1:06:39] something had to die for you to live
[1:06:44] if something doesn't die you don't live
[1:06:51] so when jesus christ comes on the scene
[1:06:55] his disciples they loved him
[1:06:59] but don't forget he was in the mind of
[1:07:02] god this is the plan of god has been
[1:07:04] fulfilled
[1:07:06] so he was fulfilling a vision so now the
[1:07:10] vision itself was walking
[1:07:15] and he now begin to call some people
[1:07:17] hallelujah
[1:07:19] one day he sees peter by the seashore
[1:07:22] says you follow me
[1:07:26] and he began to follow him he didn't
[1:07:29] preach to peter long
[1:07:30] sermon brother he just said follow
[1:07:34] me and that was it
[1:07:37] peter left everything he was doing he
[1:07:40] started following him
[1:07:41] i have decided to follow jesus
[1:07:46] john james he begins to call them
[1:07:53] but now why is he calling these people
[1:07:58] he said in the book of john's i think
[1:07:59] he's 17 he's praying for them
[1:08:01] he said father i pray for these
[1:08:06] that you have given me
[1:08:10] he said i knew them
[1:08:14] before the world began
[1:08:20] so he's just coming to collect the folks
[1:08:22] he used to be with see
[1:08:24] come on come on come on come on come on
[1:08:25] follow me follow me
[1:08:27] where were they before with him
[1:08:32] so he's looking for the ones that were
[1:08:35] with him before
[1:08:37] and they begin to follow you now while
[1:08:40] he was healing the people
[1:08:41] he was awesome they could go anyone say
[1:08:44] oh do you know my god
[1:08:46] my master i follow he's a healer of
[1:08:48] disease
[1:08:49] weren't you there he can feed people if
[1:08:52] you're hungry come to my church
[1:08:56] do you want to be rich oh forget it come
[1:08:58] here
[1:09:01] you know he can multiply bread and fish
[1:09:07] he can heal the sick
[1:09:11] but they forgot he said the son can do
[1:09:14] nothing in himself
[1:09:16] but what he see
[1:09:19] the father do that doeth the son
[1:09:22] likewise
[1:09:23] so everything he was doing was something
[1:09:26] he had seen
[1:09:30] everything he was doing was something he
[1:09:32] had seen
[1:09:35] when lazarus is sick he still has the
[1:09:38] fever they call him calm your friend
[1:09:40] lazarus is sick because it's still
[1:09:41] possible to eat him come while he's
[1:09:44] still sick
[1:09:45] he just has a fever when he looks at the
[1:09:49] vision
[1:09:50] lazarus is dead he said no no
[1:09:53] i'm not going there right now so lazarus
[1:09:57] dies and they tell him
[1:10:00] if you had been here
[1:10:03] lazarus would not have died
[1:10:06] but the vision said he had to die
[1:10:12] in the vision he was dead and brought
[1:10:14] back to life
[1:10:15] so why would he heal him
[1:10:20] he will be disrupting the vision
[1:10:23] so he waits for him to die
[1:10:27] then he comes on the scene but is he
[1:10:29] late
[1:10:32] so when he gets there say lord if you
[1:10:34] had been here past tense
[1:10:38] he said no i am the resurrection he said
[1:10:40] lord i know in the future
[1:10:45] so she went she rewinded and fast
[1:10:48] forwarded
[1:10:49] but she forgot about right now
[1:10:53] say have i not told you sister
[1:10:57] say where have you laid him and when
[1:10:59] they go over there to the tomb brother
[1:11:02] when they get there he's not shaken up
[1:11:05] he's not all anxious everybody has tried
[1:11:10] and while they're crying he said just
[1:11:13] roll that stone away
[1:11:15] and when the road was thrown away did he
[1:11:18] enter there
[1:11:20] now if you say you're wrong if you say
[1:11:23] you're right so both ways kind of you
[1:11:26] kind of write
[1:11:29] because he entered there in the
[1:11:33] beginning was the word
[1:11:35] and the word was with god and the word
[1:11:37] was god
[1:11:38] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:11:41] among us
[1:11:42] so when he speaks is there difference
[1:11:44] between what he says and himself
[1:11:46] his word and him
[1:11:50] so he stood there and he sent his word
[1:11:54] he said lazarus come forth
[1:11:58] lazarus who was run brother
[1:12:02] his nose was all the way inside the
[1:12:05] worms were
[1:12:06] feasting on his body the worm's head
[1:12:10] want the worst head
[1:12:14] how the worms begin to run away
[1:12:18] his nerves begin to reconnect
[1:12:22] new heart came down begin to beat
[1:12:25] his lungs begin to breathe again
[1:12:30] the prophet said he his word went
[1:12:33] and cut him took his soul
[1:12:38] and brought it back to his body
[1:12:42] he came back to life and he began to
[1:12:45] come out of the
[1:12:49] because the word went and looked for him
[1:12:52] in the vision he had to come out of the
[1:12:54] grave
[1:12:57] amen we are going somewhere
[1:13:01] i don't want to be long where david
[1:13:03] didn't tell me when to stop it's 8
[1:13:04] o'clock
[1:13:07] my sister warned me she said you
[1:13:10] preached too long
[1:13:14] then one day he tells his disciples
[1:13:16] peter say i'm going to die
[1:13:20] but after three days i'll come back
[1:13:24] lord we've told everybody that you're
[1:13:27] going to be the one
[1:13:29] then you're going to die no lord you
[1:13:33] can't die
[1:13:36] we believe you but we've never seen
[1:13:38] somebody come back from the dead yet
[1:13:40] so if you're dying now we know for sure
[1:13:42] you're going to come back
[1:13:45] say lord i won't die with you
[1:13:49] just in case you don't come back i don't
[1:13:50] have nobody to deal with
[1:13:55] and jesus rebukes peter
[1:14:00] and he says away from me
[1:14:03] get behind me satan what if there was a
[1:14:07] brother that heard that discussion
[1:14:09] he just called peter satan whoa
[1:14:14] and we thought he was the best guy
[1:14:18] was it peter there was somebody hiding
[1:14:21] behind peter
[1:14:23] trying to push peter to do something
[1:14:25] wrong to stop what the vision of god i
[1:14:28] see
[1:14:30] and jesus who's a discerner of the
[1:14:32] thoughts of the hearts of man
[1:14:33] could see behind peter that devil
[1:14:37] so you and i can see when your brother
[1:14:39] is going wrong against you not your
[1:14:41] brother
[1:14:42] there's something that's trying to push
[1:14:44] him do something wrong to you
[1:14:46] if you can discern that you become an
[1:14:48] overcomer
[1:14:50] you take your brother you cut the devil
[1:14:54] away
[1:14:56] and peter said oh lord you can't die no
[1:14:59] say get behind me you're satan
[1:15:04] because the vision said he had to die if
[1:15:06] he didn't die
[1:15:07] peter would not have life the life that
[1:15:10] was in him
[1:15:11] could only come out if he died
[1:15:15] if the corn of wheat does not die
[1:15:20] he cannot reproduce and he had to die
[1:15:24] late on his life
[1:15:28] so when he goes on the cross and he's
[1:15:30] there they're all crying and weeping
[1:15:32] the bible says when he died they went
[1:15:34] back to their business
[1:15:39] everybody was sad depressed
[1:15:42] because nobody had come back from the
[1:15:44] dead before who would announce his death
[1:15:46] and come back to life
[1:15:48] nobody had done it before so even though
[1:15:51] this was a hard one to swallow
[1:15:55] it was difficult to accept he was gonna
[1:15:56] come back to life how are you gonna do
[1:15:58] this lord
[1:16:01] and when he dies the bible it
[1:16:07] he went down to the place where there
[1:16:09] had been some other believers
[1:16:12] who had believed him across the ages
[1:16:17] and they all saw him as he was
[1:16:21] to them and the prophet said when daniel
[1:16:24] saw him
[1:16:27] what did he see
[1:16:30] he saw him how he had seen him in his
[1:16:32] day
[1:16:35] he said when isaiah saw him
[1:16:38] say oh that's in the air
[1:16:41] he's the one i told you all about
[1:16:45] and when death food is stinging him
[1:16:47] thinking it was over
[1:16:49] trying to take it out couldn't take it
[1:16:52] out
[1:16:53] trying to take it out couldn't take it
[1:16:56] out say oh
[1:16:57] what have i done oh what have i done
[1:17:01] i've lost my sting
[1:17:04] that's why a christian is not scared of
[1:17:06] death
[1:17:08] paul said oh death where's your sting
[1:17:13] that was this thing used to scare
[1:17:15] believers
[1:17:16] is who was it elijah running away when
[1:17:20] the
[1:17:21] who killed you tomorrow as you killed
[1:17:23] prophet saw we're gonna kill you
[1:17:24] and he was running everywhere
[1:17:28] they scared everybody with death but the
[1:17:30] life had come
[1:17:32] and he himself was gonna take the care
[1:17:34] of the trouble of death
[1:17:36] and he's dealt with the question of
[1:17:39] death once
[1:17:40] and for all
[1:17:43] and when he comes back he said don't
[1:17:44] worry
[1:17:46] i'm gonna come and i'll dwell inside of
[1:17:48] you
[1:17:50] hallelujah i'm gonna leave inside of you
[1:17:53] so you too can trample over the devil
[1:17:56] and over our death over hell of all
[1:17:59] these things
[1:18:02] and they were waiting for him there
[1:18:03] waiting and waiting the vision had said
[1:18:06] by joel
[1:18:07] and he was gonna do it that he was gonna
[1:18:10] pour out his spirit in our flesh
[1:18:12] joel has seen them doing it and he spoke
[1:18:16] it
[1:18:17] and while they're sitting there he comes
[1:18:19] down the pit of fire
[1:18:20] and begins to spread on one another
[1:18:25] and when he enters them now the same
[1:18:28] brother peter who before
[1:18:31] was running away now he's not running
[1:18:34] away
[1:18:36] he's standing up there he said man and
[1:18:38] brethren
[1:18:40] here is this this is that
[1:18:46] which was spoken by joel
[1:18:49] we are the reality of what joe spoke
[1:18:52] about
[1:18:54] we are the manifestation of what joe
[1:18:56] spoke about
[1:18:58] because in him was the very one that
[1:19:00] made the promise
[1:19:05] and the brother said when he preached
[1:19:06] that sermon there was three thousand
[1:19:08] converts
[1:19:09] he said the devil did not turn on his
[1:19:11] bed

[1:19:58] of him
[1:19:59] whom he used to accompany now he was no
[1:20:02] more a spectator

[1:20:31] crying
[1:20:32] because the doctor has said he couldn't
[1:20:35] do anything else for the baby
[1:20:37] he said but he sees a lady with a brown
[1:20:39] coat
[1:20:42] who takes his hat and puts it on the bed

[1:25:36] baby and you sit in there for an hour
[1:25:40] who are you again
[1:25:46] so i waited for hour the lady wondered
[1:25:49] what
[1:25:50] all the waiting about
[1:25:54] it was an hour the lady had not come in
[1:25:56] yet and while
[1:25:57] when she come in she sat down in the
[1:26:00] place where the lady
[1:26:02] with the red sweater on was supposed to
[1:26:05] be sitting
[1:26:07] so that wasn't right and my
[1:26:11] heart was still on the bed
[1:26:14] i couldn't tell them so who could tell
[1:26:18] them
[1:26:21] hallelujah the prophet can't
[1:26:24] tell them what the wrong was he can't
[1:26:27] tell them what to do
[1:26:30] he said i couldn't tell them but they
[1:26:32] had to do it
[1:26:34] how
[1:26:38] the angel of the lord wasn't there yet
[1:26:40] that was a sign to me went to pray
[1:26:43] and they was working with the baby after
[1:26:46] a while
[1:26:46] the lady picked up my hat and laid on
[1:26:49] the radio
[1:26:50] on the television then i walked over to
[1:26:53] the bed
[1:26:54] and said thou said the lord the baby
[1:26:56] will leave
[1:26:58] started reaching out for his mother and
[1:27:00] taking the courage off of him
[1:27:02] that was it while they were weeping i
[1:27:05] slipped out the door
[1:27:07] they never knew who i was nothing about
[1:27:09] it
[1:27:14] next one i was going down the street i
[1:27:17] thought i heard some squeaking
[1:27:20] it was a wheelchair i was going right
[1:27:22] along in front of me
[1:27:24] and it was a man in a wheelchair with a
[1:27:27] bible
[1:27:28] crying and i seen him going along just
[1:27:32] rejoice
[1:27:33] so while he sees the man on the
[1:27:35] wheelchair crying with the bible
[1:27:38] that is his him going along rejoicing
[1:27:42] oh god have mercy and i see him going
[1:27:46] along
[1:27:47] just rejoicing out of the wheelchair
[1:27:50] i thought that's strange i went down
[1:27:53] institute
[1:27:54] to where there's a 10 cent store a
[1:27:56] street come this way
[1:27:57] i was over the other day looking at the
[1:28:00] place
[1:28:01] never said nothing to nobody and i
[1:28:03] looked at the place and there was and i
[1:28:05] seen
[1:28:06] i thought well this is stood there at
[1:28:10] the corner
[1:28:11] and i heard that squeaking
[1:28:14] so now it's real
[1:28:18] now the vision hadn't been over 20
[1:28:21] minutes
[1:28:24] and the man come holding a bible weeping
[1:28:27] i thought well
[1:28:28] here it is i say how did you sir
[1:28:32] and the lady that was pushing him i said
[1:28:35] what's the matter sir
[1:28:37] he said i am i said you've got a mighty
[1:28:40] fine book there
[1:28:42] he said i believe every word of it
[1:28:45] and i said do you believe it's contents
[1:28:48] all through
[1:28:49] he said i do's her with all my heart
[1:28:53] and i said what's the matter hear this
[1:28:57] said the doctor just discouraged me
[1:29:03] i've been crippled up with arthritis
[1:29:06] he tells me i'll never walk again
[1:29:14] i said the contents of that book said
[1:29:17] that there was a man died so that you
[1:29:19] can walk again
[1:29:22] he said the lord jesus
[1:29:26] and i said yes sir do you believe that
[1:29:31] he said i do i said rise up from there
[1:29:35] for thus saith the lord you shall walk
[1:29:39] and the man jumped up and they had they
[1:29:42] thought they had the salvation army on
[1:29:44] the corner
[1:29:45] i run through the 10 cent store went out
[1:29:47] the alley
[1:29:48] and back down the other way and cut my
[1:29:51] cab and went to the airplane
[1:29:53] they don't know today whatever happened
[1:29:56] see that's right they don't know nothing
[1:29:59] about it see
[1:30:00] it isn't for self-glory is for the glory
[1:30:04] of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:12] now let's rewind a little
[1:30:15] those two ladies who had to move that
[1:30:17] hat
[1:30:18] who told them what to do where was the
[1:30:22] other one
[1:30:22] before she came to that house maybe she
[1:30:25] was walking on the street
[1:30:29] and someone told her you've got to go to
[1:30:31] that lady's house right now
[1:30:33] and when you get over there just go in
[1:30:36] when
[1:30:36] you see the hat over there move it
[1:30:39] who was doing that telling me
[1:30:43] because the opponent said i couldn't
[1:30:46] tell you what to do
[1:30:50] that's where we understand what he told
[1:30:51] us he said i didn't come to create a
[1:30:54] denomination
[1:30:56] i didn't come so people can follow me i
[1:30:58] didn't come so you make a group no
[1:31:00] i came to see established a relationship
[1:31:04] between man and his creator
[1:31:08] because when you are in a relationship
[1:31:11] with a creator he can talk to you
[1:31:14] he can tell you things hallelujah
[1:31:18] he told adam things every evening
[1:31:21] he come for fellowship with adam
[1:31:24] and they would have communion they would
[1:31:27] talk
[1:31:28] one to another
[1:31:31] and brother i came to see that
[1:31:33] reestablished
[1:31:37] and that vision could not happen if the
[1:31:40] heart had not been moved
[1:31:44] now if a hat is so important
[1:31:47] that the baby had to stay sick till that
[1:31:51] hat was moved
[1:31:54] how much more is the position of the
[1:31:56] sons and daughters of god in christ
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:10] that's close i don't want to be low
[1:32:13] 8 28 okay
[1:32:22] let me close my bible
[1:32:27] malachi sees a vision and he sees a man
[1:32:34] walking and they tell him that's elijah
[1:32:38] he's going to restore the hearts he sees
[1:32:41] what he's going to do
[1:32:42] and he prophesies and he goes away
[1:32:47] and when the time for malachi 4 5 to
[1:32:49] come the life happens
[1:32:52] the whole of heaven mobilizes
[1:32:55] so that this word can come to reality
[1:32:59] and then they come and inform the
[1:33:01] prophet it's you
[1:33:03] so i only have a fifth grade education i
[1:33:08] don't think i can do this
[1:33:10] i know all of that it's you
[1:33:16] do you know the prophets that he didn't
[1:33:17] believe he could ever be a christian
[1:33:20] he said because he had a temperament
[1:33:22] that could fight a buzz saw
[1:33:24] so he never thought he could be a
[1:33:26] christian he said one time he went to
[1:33:28] school
[1:33:29] he fought with his friends they mashed
[1:33:30] up all his mouth
[1:33:33] and he had to eat his food from a straw
[1:33:37] he said the next day he got his rifle
[1:33:41] he went through the corner there was
[1:33:43] fire with him
[1:33:44] when they came he said who's gonna be
[1:33:46] the first to die
[1:33:50] and they all run away
[1:33:53] and when he pulled the trigger do you
[1:33:55] know what the trigger said
[1:33:57] the trigger said i can't say amen to
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:02] because you have to fulfill the
[1:34:03] scripture
[1:34:06] so you you yourself cannot stop it from
[1:34:08] happening
[1:34:12] because if you had killed somebody that
[1:34:14] morning
[1:34:17] we wouldn't be where we are today
[1:34:20] and one day when the trials of life
[1:34:23] became so difficult on him and hard
[1:34:25] and his wife passed away and the baby
[1:34:28] passed away and
[1:34:30] said lord i just want to die let me take
[1:34:33] away my life
[1:34:36] he tried to grab that cable the cable
[1:34:39] didn't say amen to that
[1:34:44] he said let me get my pistol
[1:34:48] and work it out the garden didn't say
[1:34:50] amen to that
[1:34:52] you know why
[1:34:58] because there was something that was
[1:35:01] written
[1:35:02] about him and he himself
[1:35:05] could not stop it
[1:35:13] isn't that wonderful
[1:35:17] that he looked at all my faults
[1:35:21] he looked at all my weaknesses
[1:35:25] he looked at all my wrongs
[1:35:28] he looked at everything do you have time
[1:35:31] for one last vision
[1:35:35] you all said it man amen one day
[1:35:38] mama hazard's child and he grows in the
[1:35:42] church
[1:35:42] i enjoy brother ben david's testimony
[1:35:45] the other day
[1:35:46] because that was what i was when he was
[1:35:49] speaking how that he grew up in the
[1:35:51] church he knew how to coach he could
[1:35:52] talk with message believers and all just
[1:35:54] get along and you just kind of slide you
[1:35:55] know
[1:35:56] easy just call quotes here there
[1:36:00] oh he's a good one
[1:36:03] and the mama raised up her child in the
[1:36:05] way of the lord
[1:36:07] and the child went away from god
[1:36:11] but she went to the neology school
[1:36:18] in theology school you better watch it
[1:36:22] because when god takes your case in his
[1:36:25] hand
[1:36:27] you cannot do anything about it
[1:36:30] when god takes your fire and begins to
[1:36:33] review your pages
[1:36:35] your mom and i can rest so young people
[1:36:38] let me just tell you right now
[1:36:41] if your mom and dad are praying to god
[1:36:43] about you you cannot do anything
[1:36:48] you can try just forget it
[1:36:51] i tried hard
[1:36:55] i'll be drinking with my friends when i
[1:36:56] hear my ear you don't have to be
[1:37:02] and there's nobody talking to you but
[1:37:05] there's somebody talking to god
[1:37:08] and this mom raised her child in the
[1:37:11] fear of the lord
[1:37:12] and he went away god in the world
[1:37:16] but when the world stung him who did he
[1:37:18] go to
[1:37:20] his friends he went back to his mama
[1:37:23] because he had experimented love true
[1:37:26] love
[1:37:27] the kind of love that wouldn't you know
[1:37:30] just
[1:37:30] put you aside the kind of love that
[1:37:32] would take you in
[1:37:33] tell you what's right but still love you
[1:37:37] and he came back home the prophet said
[1:37:40] he
[1:37:40] the mom was calling him baby a big
[1:37:44] grown man she said my baby
[1:37:48] and the whole night she began to consult
[1:37:51] heaven
[1:37:51] oh god of heaven i'm like that woman in
[1:37:55] the bible
[1:37:56] i didn't have no child you promised me
[1:37:59] this one
[1:38:00] and now here is i'm like the shunammite
[1:38:02] woman
[1:38:04] but where is your elijah
[1:38:08] where is that malachi 4-5
[1:38:12] and why she's over there talking to god
[1:38:14] she catches a thought of
[1:38:16] god and she sees a vision
[1:38:21] in that vision she sees him walking down
[1:38:24] the street
[1:38:27] his clothes he has on amen
[1:38:30] and she's looking at the whole happening
[1:38:33] and her son comes back to life oh she
[1:38:35] just said oh thank you lord
[1:38:36] she comes down when she reaches home
[1:38:40] she just walks outside and set out
[1:38:45] brother she was there from about three
[1:38:47] a.m
[1:38:48] in the morning waiting so she believed
[1:38:52] what she had seen and she was waiting
[1:38:56] for it to come to pass and while she's
[1:38:59] waiting
[1:39:01] god informs a participant over there
[1:39:06] that flight you have let's put on hold
[1:39:09] for a minute
[1:39:10] just keep walking but lord i've got to
[1:39:13] fight to catch
[1:39:14] you just keep walking left
[1:39:18] right who was telling him where to go
[1:39:23] and that mother was just sitting there
[1:39:26] just waiting
[1:39:28] and when she sees him she says how are
[1:39:31] you
[1:39:32] person so
[1:39:36] he used to be the one they asked how do
[1:39:37] you know
[1:39:39] now he's the one asking the lady how do
[1:39:41] you know i'm a person
[1:39:46] and she tells him last night i was
[1:39:49] talking to god
[1:39:51] and god showed me you
[1:39:55] god told me you are coming
[1:39:59] and she takes him in the house and the
[1:40:01] boy was crying
[1:40:02] mama is dark in the room mama
[1:40:05] is dark in the room
[1:40:09] and he said let's pray she kneels down
[1:40:12] so when he heard that mama pray
[1:40:15] he knew she knew how to pray
[1:40:19] he said he didn't have to pray long
[1:40:22] he said he just grabbed his feet and
[1:40:25] prayed
[1:40:26] then he stopped saying mama it's light
[1:40:29] in the room
[1:40:30] mama is light in the room where did the
[1:40:33] darkness go
[1:40:39] [Applause]
[1:40:41] darkness is just the absence of light
[1:40:42] that's all it is
[1:40:46] but in the vision that the mom saw
[1:40:50] her son was healed
[1:40:54] so i asked myself so even vaccinating
[1:40:57] people can be in the vision
[1:41:01] i say amen because when the grace of god
[1:41:05] looks beyond your fault
[1:41:08] and sees your need and that you were
[1:41:11] there
[1:41:13] you cannot help yourself
[1:41:17] in the vision you are not a halfway
[1:41:19] christian
[1:41:21] that's why i said be not conformed to
[1:41:23] this world
[1:41:24] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:41:27] your mind
[1:41:28] so that you
[1:41:33] may do or show was the perfect will of
[1:41:36] god
[1:41:37] but was that his will
[1:41:41] to be like
[1:41:44] jesus
[1:41:48] to be like jesus
[1:41:54] all the thigh lord
[1:41:58] to be like you
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:04] all through life's journey
[1:42:11] from earth
[1:42:22] to be like
[1:42:28] indictment the prophet said listen at
[1:42:30] that prophet standing there look at him
[1:42:33] fearless standing there upon the bunch
[1:42:36] and condemning them and indicting them
[1:42:38] said this
[1:42:39] is the scripture this is that that was
[1:42:43] spoke
[1:42:43] of the prophet of by the prophet i'll
[1:42:46] pour out my
[1:42:47] spirit upon all flesh your sons and
[1:42:49] daughters shall prophesy
[1:42:51] on my handmaids and my servants made
[1:42:54] servants
[1:42:54] i will pour out my spirit and i will
[1:42:57] show
[1:42:57] signs in the heavens above and on the
[1:43:00] earth
[1:43:00] fire and pillars of smoke and vapor
[1:43:03] proving it by the word
[1:43:05] that it was the word they laughed and
[1:43:08] made fun of it
[1:43:09] and they went to judgment and the city
[1:43:11] was burned and they eat one another's
[1:43:13] children
[1:43:14] and to there they scattered people
[1:43:16] throughout the whole world
[1:43:18] showing the holy spirit still remains
[1:43:20] the word of god
[1:43:22] to bring this word to make it to live
[1:43:25] he said jesus was the person man god
[1:43:29] hallelujah he was the manifestation of
[1:43:32] god
[1:43:33] he was god in body form to reflect the
[1:43:36] word of god for that age
[1:43:39] to make that age see god's promise
[1:43:42] for that age not hear this as we close
[1:43:46] and the holy ghost is the same thing
[1:43:48] today
[1:43:50] is the spirit of god upon the written
[1:43:54] word of god trying to
[1:43:57] find somebody to reflect
[1:44:01] itself to this age
[1:44:05] to prove that he's the same yesterday
[1:44:08] today and forever
[1:44:09] saint john 14 12 the works that i do
[1:44:13] shall you do also
[1:44:16] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:44:19] forever see
[1:44:20] constantly trying to find its way
[1:44:24] to reflect itself in this
[1:44:27] age
[1:44:32] do you love the lord amen
[1:44:36] i was in cameroon in a small town
[1:44:39] and we're preaching a simple sermon
[1:44:42] there was a nine-year-old sitting in the
[1:44:44] front
[1:44:46] and he kept staring at me so hard i was
[1:44:48] scared
[1:44:50] and he was turning me throughout the
[1:44:51] service
[1:44:53] and he wouldn't move left or right
[1:44:56] so when the service was over everybody
[1:44:58] was so blessed the wall just rejoicing
[1:45:00] and i was wondering i kept wondering why
[1:45:03] was this child staring at me like that
[1:45:06] so we got in the car and he was on his
[1:45:08] daddy's lap
[1:45:09] and the pastor asked him samuel
[1:45:12] did god show you anything or is there
[1:45:15] anything that we need to know from the
[1:45:17] lord
[1:45:18] i ask myself why are they asking a
[1:45:19] nine-year-old boy that kind of a
[1:45:20] question
[1:45:22] i didn't know i never been there never
[1:45:23] knew the boy
[1:45:25] he said yeah i saw something i said oh
[1:45:31] so when that tall brother was preaching
[1:45:34] then he pointed me
[1:45:35] so when that thought brother was
[1:45:36] preaching i saw jesus
[1:45:41] i said he said i saw jesus
[1:45:46] and the pastor asked him did you see him
[1:45:47] in his mouth or in his heart
[1:45:49] he said i don't know i just saw jesus
[1:45:53] but my memory began to go back come on
[1:45:55] man you lied yesterday are you sure this
[1:45:57] guy
[1:45:57] this cannot be because
[1:46:01] my memory is not my friend
[1:46:05] your memory is not your friend bro
[1:46:09] it will remind you of how disqualified
[1:46:13] you are
[1:46:16] it would remind you of how unworthy you
[1:46:19] are
[1:46:22] but when you lift your eyes and look to
[1:46:24] calvary
[1:46:26] and you look at the one that calls you
[1:46:28] worthy
[1:46:30] it's high time you believe what he says
[1:46:31] about you
[1:46:33] and doubt what your memory says about
[1:46:35] you
[1:46:38] because you cannot help yourself anyway
[1:46:42] he's the one that called you
[1:46:46] now if he's the one that called you
[1:46:49] who are you to disqualify yourself
[1:46:52] because paul said what can separate us
[1:46:57] from this love that came and looked for
[1:46:59] us
[1:47:01] from this love that came and called us
[1:47:04] from this love that paid the price for
[1:47:07] me
[1:47:08] he began to name all the things and
[1:47:11] there was nothing found worthy
[1:47:14] to disqualify you from the love
[1:47:17] of god in christ jesus
[1:47:21] because when he looked at the vision he
[1:47:24] saw you there
[1:47:26] and because he saw you there now he came
[1:47:28] looking for you
[1:47:32] it's not adam that look for god when
[1:47:36] adam went his way and god said
[1:47:40] adam where are you
[1:47:43] the reason why you came tonight is
[1:47:45] because god convinced you at your house
[1:47:48] there's gonna be service tonight i want
[1:47:50] to speak to you
[1:47:51] go and listen because when i look at the
[1:47:54] vision
[1:47:55] you are sitting there do you know even
[1:47:58] the color of your dress your clothes you
[1:48:00] have now
[1:48:00] god knew it
[1:48:03] so tell god god if you knew the kind of
[1:48:05] clothes that i have on tonight
[1:48:08] how much more of my needs
[1:48:12] if you know the number of hair that i
[1:48:14] have even after my hair cut
[1:48:17] how much more how much more
[1:48:21] of your desires there was a song with
[1:48:23] singing sunday it says
[1:48:24] and i want to see your desires fulfilled
[1:48:28] in me
[1:48:32] and the desire of god is to look at you
[1:48:35] with a steve
[1:48:36] and see himself the brothers say he's
[1:48:40] free he went with his friends
[1:48:41] i want to quit but he's just hard he
[1:48:43] went with friends to the junkyard
[1:48:45] and his friend was showing how he
[1:48:46] separated the cars he said they put a
[1:48:48] big
[1:48:49] magnet and they just pass it over the
[1:48:51] cars
[1:48:52] and they begin to magnetize them
[1:48:56] except but there was one there i kind of
[1:48:58] did magnetize
[1:49:00] so he asked him he said why did that one
[1:49:01] not get magnetized
[1:49:04] and because he got a big boat like this
[1:49:07] and it's bolted to the earth
[1:49:09] that one can go
[1:49:13] but as we close the prophet said you and
[1:49:16] i
[1:49:17] where do we come from
[1:49:21] we cannot be bolted to this earth we
[1:49:24] cannot be held down here
[1:49:26] he said when the rain comes down and the
[1:49:28] drops on the leaves
[1:49:30] when the sun begins to shine he said the
[1:49:33] the drops begin to rejoice you know why
[1:49:37] hallelujah because they know
[1:49:41] in the rays of the sun there is power
[1:49:44] to change them from liquid
[1:49:48] into people so when they see that
[1:49:51] sunshine
[1:49:53] hallelujah it doesn't matter if it's
[1:49:56] till 6 am
[1:49:57] they don't care because they know at
[1:49:59] some point
[1:50:00] the sun is gonna get to his intense
[1:50:02] power and it's going to transform them
[1:50:04] from that state
[1:50:06] and they'll be cut away from here
[1:50:09] one of these days brothers
[1:50:12] this is your skin that is trying to tell
[1:50:15] you oh you got covered oh you got this
[1:50:17] and that
[1:50:18] look it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:50:22] disease comes on you
[1:50:24] because there is a promise of god that
[1:50:27] is more powerful than
[1:50:28] every disease past disease
[1:50:32] present ones even future ones
[1:50:36] the brother said there's going to be
[1:50:37] disease come that it would require
[1:50:40] divine healing because there'll be no
[1:50:41] medicine for it
[1:50:45] said they are cooking up their things in
[1:50:47] their labs
[1:50:49] but don't worry god knows living either
[1:50:55] god is putting faith in people
[1:50:59] hallelujah how do we come here we
[1:51:01] recharge our bodies every day
[1:51:04] hallelujah do you think it's for nothing
[1:51:07] no god is calling us say hey there's
[1:51:09] more for you
[1:51:10] come up here don't just step down on the
[1:51:13] bench
[1:51:14] brother sister open your vessel say lord
[1:51:18] here's my vessel feel it low all the way
[1:51:22] because david said my cup runneth over
[1:51:26] he said my cup is full no
[1:51:29] if your cup is full it's for you alone
[1:51:35] but when your cup runs over
[1:51:38] whether peter is walking one day
[1:51:40] hallelujah
[1:51:41] and just cast people in the shadow just
[1:51:44] touch his shadow
[1:51:48] the prophet lost his bag with his
[1:51:50] clothes and his bible
[1:51:54] oh brother let's buy another one he said
[1:51:55] oh brother just wait don't worry about
[1:51:57] it just wait
[1:51:58] said no brother brother because if
[1:52:00] somebody gets it two things can happen
[1:52:03] if he's a believer he'll cut it all to
[1:52:05] pieces and send the pieces everywhere
[1:52:09] i don't believe that we just throw it
[1:52:10] away he said no brother just wait
[1:52:13] why because even his clothes
[1:52:20] were charged with virtue
[1:52:25] i wanted to read a quote here can i read
[1:52:27] it
[1:52:33] oh my this one just did something to me
[1:52:39] oh i wish i can find it oh
[1:52:42] it's not here this is my i think it's in
[1:52:45] my bag
[1:52:47] the prophet said what if i just
[1:52:50] paraphrased
[1:52:51] what if if we have to be like christ
[1:52:54] we must have his virtue he said what if
[1:52:58] somebody comes to you for virtue
[1:53:00] and tries to pull virtue from you and
[1:53:03] you check bounce
[1:53:08] is it insufficient funds
[1:53:12] when you have an almighty god
[1:53:16] but you have insufficient funds is it
[1:53:18] his fault
[1:53:22] oh one day was mexico there was a
[1:53:23] brother and his more music

[1:55:40] nothing
[1:55:42] it's the god of heaven the brother say
[1:55:45] he does not have any hands
[1:55:47] if it's not for your hands my brother
[1:55:50] he don't have no mouth if it's not for
[1:55:53] your mouth
[1:55:56] he don't have no ears if it's not for
[1:55:58] your ears
[1:56:01] oh we have a song to sing back home in
[1:56:02] africa say lord
[1:56:04] make me a practical instrument for
[1:56:08] you use me o lord just
[1:56:14] like the brother said the other day they
[1:56:15] said just surrender
[1:56:18] because when you surrender then he can
[1:56:21] do something
[1:56:22] and to surrender me you got to raise
[1:56:24] your hands
[1:56:26] say lord i can't fight no more lord i
[1:56:29] can't do this
[1:56:30] halfway christianity no more you're
[1:56:33] going to have to do something for me
[1:56:34] lord
[1:56:35] you being the same yesterday today and
[1:56:38] forever do something for me lord
[1:56:40] i believe your word is the same i
[1:56:42] believe you're true lord
[1:56:44] here i am for you and when brother jacob
[1:56:47] was going to meet the age of lord
[1:56:49] he went like this after the meeting
[1:56:57] but he came back limping and a prince
[1:57:02] before he went like this nothing
[1:57:06] but when god broke him
[1:57:09] he came back victorious when his wife
[1:57:12] saw him he was limping yes but something
[1:57:14] had changed about that man
[1:57:18] i believe the lord has really been
[1:57:20] ministering to us these days
[1:57:22] telling us hey there's more
[1:57:26] there's more for you come i have this
[1:57:29] these blessings for you do you want them
[1:57:32] look when i see you in the vision you
[1:57:34] you are your whole your will
[1:57:38] you're serving me you're full of my life
[1:57:40] don't stay just here
[1:57:42] come up higher
[1:57:45] as i invite the musicians to come i
[1:57:48] don't want to
[1:57:49] be used of your time either but
[1:57:51] sometimes it's just hard
[1:57:53] you have to find a way to stop you can't
[1:57:55] find it but it's because there's someone
[1:57:57] that's still hungry
[1:58:00] you can't pull the plate away someone's
[1:58:02] still eating
[1:58:03] you're a bad server if you come and take
[1:58:05] the dish away when they're still working
[1:58:07] on it
[1:58:10] but as we just
[1:58:15] bow our heads and talk to the lord this
[1:58:18] evening
[1:58:20] think about what job saw
[1:58:24] you know in that congregation there was
[1:58:25] not anybody who wasn't rejoicing
[1:58:29] there was not anybody there who was
[1:58:32] a halfway believer so all those who were
[1:58:36] there in that congregation
[1:58:38] they were singing they were praising god
[1:58:43] let's just say our song holy words every
[1:58:46] truth
[1:58:48] and as he began to look in that
[1:58:50] congregation
[1:58:52] and those people were rejoicing and
[1:58:54] praising the lord
[1:58:56] he could identify with somebody there
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:00] and that person looked very much like
[1:59:02] him
[1:59:03] that's why god sent us his word because
[1:59:06] we
[1:59:06] look in the mirror of the word and we
[1:59:09] can see ourselves
[1:59:11] and we can say god that's me
[1:59:15] god that's me
[1:59:20] [Music]
[1:59:25] as we prayed together and call on
[1:59:29] the lord i definitely know he spoke to
[1:59:32] somebody's heart
[1:59:33] he spoke to my heart
[1:59:36] in the room i was saying lord god
[1:59:40] you'd have to speak to your people
[1:59:42] because i cannot do it
[1:59:45] and i know he did speak to our hearts
[1:59:47] tonight
[1:59:48] [Music]
[1:59:51] think about the vision that god has of
[1:59:54] you
[1:59:54] not even your own because yours not
[1:59:56] you're not worthy
[1:59:58] but think about what he saw in you how
[2:00:01] he saw you
[2:00:02] oh it's wonderful
[2:00:06] let us pray heavenly father
[2:00:12] i can say that as another
[2:00:15] servant i've done my job
[2:00:19] but i've put my whole confidence in the
[2:00:21] holy spirit
[2:00:23] he's the preacher that never fails god
[2:00:27] he's the one that meets the needs of
[2:00:29] your children
[2:00:31] where they are lord there may be some on
[2:00:34] the
[2:00:35] internet listening but here we are
[2:00:38] tonight god as your children begin to
[2:00:42] open
[2:00:42] their cops say lord fill me through and
[2:00:45] through lord god
[2:00:47] lord bring me where you want me to be
[2:00:51] let your desires in you let your will be
[2:00:54] fulfilled in me
[2:00:57] father god remember my brother remember
[2:00:59] my sister lord
[2:01:01] i pray in the name of jesus christ that
[2:01:04] you would minister to our hearts when we
[2:01:06] sleep at night when we work

[2:03:30] that lord when we get over there we
[2:03:31] don't have to
[2:03:32] push no more wagons do no more
[2:03:35] struggling
[2:03:36] but you wipe our tears god we give you
[2:03:40] the glory tonight we bless you for all
[2:03:42] that you are
[2:03:44] in jesus name amen
[2:03:57] holy words
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:36] it's
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:48] amen did you
[2:04:53] find something for you to take
[2:04:55] personally tonight
[2:04:56] [Music]
[2:04:57] you know i thought it's the how perfect
[2:05:00] the
[2:05:02] word of god is you know the prophet of
[2:05:05] god said in the beginning was the word
[2:05:08] he said but the word was a thought
[2:05:12] if you could say the word was a vision
[2:05:16] a thought and then the
[2:05:20] vision was expressed became the word
[2:05:25] but then the vision was made flesh
[2:05:29] it was fulfilled so you know
[2:05:33] you're part of the vision and that was
[2:05:35] beautiful what was so
[2:05:37] beautiful tonight that that you're part
[2:05:40] of the
[2:05:41] vision of the bride so when he saw the
[2:05:44] bride he saw you
[2:05:45] right the book of life was a vision
[2:05:51] he said the reason that he could raise
[2:05:52] that little girl from the dead jairus's
[2:05:55] daughter
[2:05:55] because he knew her name was on the
[2:05:58] lamb's book of life
[2:06:00] so just think of it and
[2:06:03] and you know make how his brother moses
[2:06:06] went through that vision with the
[2:06:08] praying for the baby everybody had a
[2:06:10] part to play in that vision
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:15] you have a part to play
[2:06:18] in the vision you know moses there's
[2:06:20] nobody that's a a maverick or a loner or
[2:06:25] on their own they're a part of something
[2:06:29] because this body is fitted and joined
[2:06:32] together
[2:06:34] this vision is put together with every
[2:06:37] member supplying
[2:06:39] a need to the other
[2:06:42] so just think of it that each person has
[2:06:46] a part
[2:06:47] that they have to play in the vision
[2:06:51] so god's got to place you in your part
[2:06:55] of fulfillment nobody can take your
[2:06:59] place
[2:07:00] think of it nobody can take your place
[2:07:05] nobody could fulfill your part
[2:07:09] of the vision the vision
[2:07:12] can't go on without you that's why i had
[2:07:16] to forgive you
[2:07:18] because you were part of the vision of
[2:07:20] the lamb book of life
[2:07:22] it's just it's so beautiful and
[2:07:26] and so he has to place you
[2:07:29] in your part of the vision and
[2:07:32] don't you want to surrender to that
[2:07:36] i mean i've i've been so thrilled lately
[2:07:39] i've heard so many wonderful
[2:07:41] testimonials sister lindsey tonight
[2:07:43] people have come to me all over the
[2:07:45] church god's moving god's work and
[2:07:48] you know why he's fulfilling a vision he
[2:07:51] saw a bride didn't he
[2:07:53] without spot or without wrinkle
[2:07:56] he saw a body of believers
[2:07:59] an elect lady a bride working in unity
[2:08:03] uniting time and sign coming together
[2:08:06] one with him in the word there's
[2:08:09] something to be a part of church
[2:08:11] pray in your heart i i think our brother
[2:08:13] admonished us tonight
[2:08:15] is if you surrender he'll fulfill
[2:08:19] your part of the vision because the word
[2:08:23] has to be made flesh
[2:08:25] amen lord richly bless you is there
[2:08:28] anybody tonight
[2:08:29] that the presence of the lord is here
[2:08:32] that needs
[2:08:32] special prayer maybe you're sick or you
[2:08:36] have a special burden or something and
[2:08:38] that you would like to maybe come
[2:08:40] tonight
[2:08:41] and have special prayer if there's
[2:08:44] nobody that's good too but
[2:08:46] we just want to make the opportunity for
[2:08:48] somebody and would you all pray together
[2:08:51] this is a part of you
