brother nathan's church back in new albany that's watching by way of live stream we're [Music] grateful for that due to our weather conditions that we have we'll have no service wednesday it's supposed to snow again and get like about 19 degrees to be a high so but anyway we're glad we have tonight and we're glad we have brother nathan here to just bring us the word and sit back and enjoy

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jerusalem amen i don't plan on wearing mine very long i want to take it and lay it at his feet amen well i you almost like coming to church i tell you what oh my come out in weather like this and have church amen must be a hunger down on the inside and so i believe we can have church tonight and we'll look back at this one day as a fond memory and say i'm all my you remember that time brother nathan came and preached during a blizzard in texas but amen i pray god makes it more memorable but because of more than just that tonight but amen genesis chapter 3 thank you musicians and god bless you richly genesis chapter 3 we'll turn tonight and want to say again it's certainly an honor to be here with you um even if it's about 30 degrees colder than it normally is in texas this time of year it was good to be here i think don't worry we're going to take the cold weather and leave and it's going to be about 67 by this time next week it looks like so but uh certainly been an honor and a privilege to be here certainly appreciate the fellowship of the ones that we've got to fellowship with and appreciate brother david giving us the invitation and opportunity to come and and minister for you and uh appreciate the the spirit that god has placed in him as a pastor a shepherd over the flock here and to see the wonderful things that god has done here over the years and how he's used him and i believe god calls a man uh to an an area for the need for that area and i believe we certainly see that reflected in brother david's life and and the impact that he's had here and and um and am i it's just it's good to be amongst believers something about it you know uh you get around believers and it's it's different than just other people you come in contact with not because um that you know they're they're people just like we are they have feelings and and emotions and and cheerfulness and sadness and all the emotions that we go through but something about when you get around a believer maybe you've only known them for a few minutes or a few days or whatever it be but there's something that goes back a further history back into eternity with them and we have something in common that we rally around and that's not a personality or just a doctrine or a theology or an idea but it's the word of god and so something interesting about the word of god is it's eternal as i think i mentioned briefly this morning and and a man can begin to read something that moses wrote maybe 4 000 years ago or that paul wrote 2000 years ago and yet you can even if you're just reading it at home yourself certain times when you're reading a scripture maybe you've read that scripture three dozen times before and it was a good scripture and you could say man and and enjoyed it but you're going through something and all of a sudden you open up your bible and begin to read it or you turn on a tape and begin to listen to it maybe you listen to that tape half a dozen times before but whatever you're going through right at that moment something stands out to you in that scripture or from that tape that has such a meaning to you more than it did before that applied to write what you were going through and that's because god's word is eternal david could write psalms way back and you know on the back side of the desert there with a salt tree which was an old testament guitar is really what it was and and he could write a psalm back there and you know we we think songs you know 100 years ago 150 years ago 200 years ago maybe seems a little outdated to some people but he wrote that thousands of years ago and we pick it up and they sang this morning psalm 34 and you can feel the presence of god come in and just make it just i believe as real and as purple as when david sat there and this it's not them it's me i don't know it's something in my in my chemistry of my body doesn't like these texts and microphones but [Laughter] but they um uh you know just as real as it was when david wrote it so that's that's something more than a man can do it's something that takes a god quality to make something eternal like that but i don't want to keep you standing too long you somebody said oh you already have brother nathan but genesis chapter 3 and verse 9 and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself you notice adam says these words as far as i know the first time ever spoken by a human being i was afraid there had never been any fear before the fall no fear no shame no anxiety no depression no sickness there had never been any of these things before the fall but now adam begins to i wonder how he even knew in his vocabulary the word to describe what he was feeling because he had never felt it before i was afraid and i will look at this thought tonight with the help of the lord overcoming fear overcoming fear let's bow our heads together dear jesus lord we approach your throne again tonight lord we know it's cold and windy on the outside and snow covering the roads but lord we thank you that not only because of the heaters and the electricity and the thermostats that it's warm on the inside but we believe that the holy ghost and fire will come and and just ignite this service into something that would be pleasing to you and lord we welcome your holy spirit to move in any way that you would want it to lord we we recognize that by faith we we believe and take you it's your word that you're with us whether we feel you or whether we don't feel you we know that you're with us because your word promised that you would be but lord we want to make sure tonight that we make you welcome to move in our midst lord and to do whatever you would see fit for this moment in time and lord i thank you for these that have been able to sojourn the roads and and be able to come here tonight in this weather lord i know it's an extra effort that they put forth on a night like tonight and for those that due to distance and and road conditions couldn't be here that are listening in lord i pray that you'd give them a special blessing as well those that are listening back in indiana and kentucky lord i pray that you'd be with them tonight lord and father we we thank you that even though sometimes it's not possible to physically be in the church that you've provided an opportunity for others to still be able to participate somewhat in the service even when they can't physically be here but lord we we recognize it's not it's not the same and we thank you for those opportunities when we can be here lord we we thank you in times like this and in times of sickness that there's an opportunity to be able to listen in remotely but lord may we never use that in a as a crutch lord when it's not necessary and father i pray that you'd be with each one speak to hearts tonight and father just help me to get myself out of the way so that you can speak something lord i'm not interested in projecting the opinion of nathan bryant or the personality of nathan bryant tonight but lord may you just get me so far out of the way that the people would see jesus christ lord and not see just a man up here lord they didn't come to they wouldn't drive this this in these conditions lord and in this weather just to come out and hear a man or a personality but we come to hear the word tonight father lord i'm not depending on my ability or my intelligence or my memory lord tonight but i'm depending on you because lord if they're gonna receive something that would be worth the efforts that they put into it it'll take you to do it father we commit the service to you in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church said amen god bless you can be seated tonight david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord oh my i'm thankful you know for places that we can come some countries don't have the privilege that we do to to meet openly like this to where they have to hide out in somebody's basement from communism or they have to maybe not have a physical building maybe it's not politically that they're being oppressed but just uh due to finances or due to circumstances meet out under a tree or something like that and and so we're blessed to have even in these conditions to have a place with a roof over our head and heat blowing through the vents and and um and so we we are we are truly blessed i thank god for opportunities to come together and assemble ourselves to worship the scripture told us that we should do that even the more so as we see the day approaching and uh it's sad that you see some people that the the closer we get the less that they're interested in church and the less that they're interested in the word and we don't have any excuse in this age you know used to if you didn't have your bible with you and uh back in the 1800s and things if you had went somewhere and you walked off and left your bible in your saddlebag or you didn't have all of your concordances and things with you you didn't have the opportunities that we have now but now we're walking right around our cell phone in our pocket we've got every scripture we've got every message at the audio the text of it and yet it seems like it becomes more and more common and less and less of a desire of people to listen to it but i thank god for a desire for the word and for a love for his word i told my church a while back i it hasn't always been easy for me to live the word but it's always been easy something about it brother matthew since a little boy it's always been easy for me to believe the word and so i recognize that is something that you can't manufacture on your own that it takes god to do that but to have a love for the truth in this age when there are so many people that make fun of the truth or walk away from the truth or have no desire at all for truth to have a love for the truth you truly are a blessed people tonight as i said before adam when he comes out of the garden here and and he he feels this emotion of fear and so we recognize that that fear is actually equality that came from satan god did not place this fear on adam now we can look and we begin to recognize that well solomon said that the beginning of wisdom is to fear the lord but that's not the type of fear that adam was feeling when when we look at that word and brother bam talks about it in the sermon of respects he said i fear the lord he said i fear my wife i fear my neighbor it wasn't that he was i know there's some men that are probably afraid of their wife and the way that adam was talking but but brother bannon wasn't talking about being afraid that sister branham was going to beat him over the head with the broom but he said that's a respectful fear that he was he was afraid that he would do something to lead them astray or be a stumbling block so it was a respect and uh being able to respect god and fear him in that way but god does not want his children remember he's the type of the bridegroom and we're the type of the bride and god is it doesn't want you know you sisters if you really love your husband you're not sitting there in fear of him oh uh what if i burn the eggs will he divorce me and what if i do this will he will he smack me with his backhand or what if i do this what no it's it's not that but it's that you love him so much and respect him so much that you don't want to do anything wrong and so that's the relationship that we have with god and the type of fear that we have for god as brother brahm said he loved him so much he wouldn't want to do anything to let him down and so that's a different type of fear than what adam was feeling here when god's voice spoke in the garden and said adam where art thou he had heard god's voice many times and he had a respect for god's voice but now he is actually afraid as he hears the voice coming through the garden because of shame and because of sin and because of anxiety he goes and before where he would have welcomed the presence of god now he hides from it you realize this is why some people don't like to go to church and this is why some people don't believe in preachers it's because the voice of god actually convicts them and so they try to quiet the voice of god in their life and to try to get away from it and this is what adam thought he thought if i can just hide from that voice if i can just hide from that presence until i can get good enough until i can sow some fig leaves together but god showed him real quick that there was nothing man-made that he could do but that god had provided a sacrifice for him adam he feels afraid for the very first time now the way to have fellowship 1955 brother bannon makes this statement he said there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is faith which brings results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all i want you to think about that tonight now i'm not going to bring anything new that you haven't ever heard before probably i have no new revelation of my own i'm probably not going to bring anything a quote or a scripture that that brother david hasn't read here before i i don't have anything new but i am going to try to point you back to the word and just remind you of some of these things so don't be shocked if you don't hear anything you know fantastic tonight in the way of it being new and extracurricular and out in left field somewhere but i do hope that we hear things and recognize that they're extraordinary because it's the word so brother bannon says fear has no value in it at all all the worry that we do all the things we live in fear if there is ever an age that lives in fear it's the age that we're living in now people afraid to go out of their house people afraid to go and interact with people why because of because of a sickness and the sickness is real people will get sick and people are dying of it but you know what people were sick and dying before we ever knew anything about coronavirus i find it very interesting they said we had less flu deaths in 2020 than we ever have well isn't that strange because they count everything as coronavirus deaths now you die in an automobile accident you test positive for coronavirus and they'll count it as a coronavirus death and it it amplifies the numbers and it amplifies the anxiety and it amplifies the fear and and everything that the that the news wants to project to us what is it it's a controlled way of of keeping us living in fear that we get to a spot to where we would rather lay down our freedoms uh for a little bit of protection that oh you'll just keep us safe then we'll lay down our freedom as well i'm not interested in living that way i told somebody a long time ago when all this started i said i can honestly say i would rather die of coronavirus than to live in constant fear from it now that doesn't mean that we i believe in washing my hands amen i believe in taking precautions i i you know i believe in in these things but there's a difference in being cautious and being fearful and letting fear actually grip you and consume you i've seen some people that have actually allowed this to consume them in such a way that they're living in fear and you know brother bannon makes a statement he said even if you had cancer and wasn't afraid of it he said you wouldn't be in too bad of a condition amen so i believe that we should live our life that way not to not to live in fear he said if i knew in the morning that i was going to go out and be shot by a firing squad he said it would do me no good to be afraid there's no value in fear absolutely no value in fear i know the devil doesn't like that and he'll try to get you to intellectualize it and reason your way through it all the 973 reasons to be afraid in 2021 but there is no value in fear there's nothing positive in it at all it's just a negative and just uh something to bring you down and discourage your depression before you know you'll be hiding out in your basement afraid to come out and and i don't want to live my life that way i'm not interested in living my life that way where the spirit of the lord is the scripture says there's liberty and that word liberty means freedom so i want to be free in the holy spirit that whether wherever he leads me that i'll be able to follow that so fear has no value he said now brother bannon what if what about faith what about that he said faith could deliver me maybe the governor say we're going to kill this man in the morning and have it all set up and have the documentation have the men cleaning their guns and putting the cells in their guns to be able to go out there the next day and fire them but faith could deliver him faith could bring somebody of a higher authority on the scene to say i don't care what the governor says we're going to override this legally or to replace the governor with somebody else you know i've told people for years people get so anxious about their jobs oh brother nathan i don't know pray for me this is happening at my job in this situation and my boss doesn't like me hey i don't care if the ceo of the company doesn't like you if god gave you the job and wants you to keep the job god can change the ceo of the company there was a man by the name of joseph one time and we're a little bit off the notes but hey you know the holy ghost is better than the notes anyhow isn't he brother david there was a man by the name of joseph one time and looked like everything that could go wrong for this man was going wrong he was sold into slavery by his own brothers and he goes and they cast him into a pit and then they bring him out and sell him into slavery and he goes down into egypt and looked like it was terrible but he recognized something you go back and read those chapters in genesis where it deals with joseph there and joseph begins to recognize that even while he's in bondage that god was with him and then you know he begins in the house of pharaoh to be promoted a little bit to a higher and a higher and a higher position and looked like things was getting pretty good for him for a while and then potiphar's wife sets a trap for the man and he gets now he gets thrown into prison and looks like he's worse off than he ever was but he recognized that god was with him and it didn't matter we get so focused on the circumstance and the geographic location and the title behind our job and all these things but what really mattered to joseph he may not have recognized this right away brother david it may have taken years to recognize it but he began to recognize a pattern that if he was at home with his family god was with him if he was in the pit god was with him if he was in slavery god was with him if he was the top man in potiphar's house god was with him if he was in the prison god was with him if he was the right hand of pharaoh god was with him and he recognized you know even though his life if you had looked at a at a pie chart or a graph of of joseph's life there would have been a lot of ups and downs and ups and downs and maybe you would lay your life over top of that and it would follow a similar pound pattern of mountaintops and valleys and flat places and halfway up the mountain and halfway down the mountain but the main thing he recognized there was a consistency that it didn't matter if he was on the mountaintop or the valley god was with him that takes the fear out of it to know that god is with you it takes the fear away when you can recognize no matter my circumstance stop looking at the circumstance no matter what the pressure stop looking at the pressure no matter what the sickness stop looking at the symptom and look to the one that's walking with you through the valley amen he's been with me on my mountaintops he's been with me in my valleys he's been with me through sickness and in health he's been with me through riches and poverty he promised never to leave me nor forsake me as long as he's with me it really doesn't matter my geographic location or the amount of money in my bank you know sometimes that makes it easier sometimes that brings more trials with it it depends on what you're using it for but you know what all of that is just temporary things that come and go and rust and corrupt i've got a i've got a a a jeep that i restored a few years ago and just uh i traded my brother for it with for another old vehicle and and we you know i began a little at a time to fix it up and fix it up and i got to a spot where i was pretty particular about it brother jay and my wife would tell me it's going to burn it's going to burn my jeep is not taking a rapture amen that's we get our focus on those things sometimes but those things are just temporary things that are here today and gone tomorrow but there's one thing that's been consistent in my life he's been with me amen that takes the fear right out of it now fear is a strange thing fear is something that you know if you're not careful fear becomes something that begins to consume you and take over and and there's we call it you know the or the psychologists call it phobias people have different kinds of phobias and there's all kinds of phobias there's a there's the fear of spiders i think they call that arachnophobia and there's a fear of enclosed places and there's the fear of heights and there's all kinds of different fears but i want to look at a few of them tonight it says most phobias involving a specific object this is from wikipedia most phobias involving a specific object or situation are thought to be triggered by a traumatic experience during childhood even if the actual incident is not remembered the emotional scarring remains oh my you got a lot of people with phobias in the message because of emotional scarring some of it was emotional scarring from when they was out in the world some of it was they came into a message church somewhere and got scarred and they've got all kinds of troubles and things and maybe they don't even remember what how it actually started but now they've got photophobias now there's this one phobia called a tichophobia which is the fear of failure and there's a lot of people that they absolutely won't do anything for god because they're afraid they're going to fail moses started off like that he said god i can't do this i i'm slow of speech and i stutter and i do all these things and he began to look at himself and he was afraid of failure but god said look i'm the one that created your mouth i'm bigger than your failures i'm bigger than your personality i'm bigger than your attempts at it you just give it to me then there's a phobia called ecclesiophobia which is the fear of churches well that's going around a lot these days isn't it ecclesiaphobia the fear of churches some people are scared of church my all oh my they they're scared you know what's interesting i bump into some of them at lowe's and the lines are so crowded and people out there at lowe's in the grocery and but you know they don't seem to think that coronavirus goes to lowe's in the grocery but oh we couldn't go to church we might get sick well it's a it's a fear of churches i guess but there's a there's a phobia called nomophobia which means the fear of being out of mobile phone contact i didn't now i'm going to read you one in a minute that i made up but i didn't make that up that's an actual phobia nomophobia the fear of being out of cell phone contact now some people are actually addicted to their smartphones and they won't admit it just like a guy out there with his hands shaking with a cigarette he won't admit that he's addicted or somebody out there with a bottle oh i'm not an addict i'm not an alcoholic i can quit any time and some of them they got their smartphones out and they got they get the shakes if they don't have it every once in a while and some people come into church and after about 15 minutes of the song service they got to see what's the latest score in their football game or their baseball game or their basketball game and what was the latest thing on twitter and facebook and instagram and they might have missed something if they didn't hold onto their cell phone and check it every once in a while if the preacher goes through too long they got to get it back out and check again on something that's going on oh my don't you realize that's an addiction that if you can't get through two hours of a church service or maybe three hours like we had this morning but if you can't get through two hours without picking up your cell phone and checking out what's going on social media you might have an addiction a phobia of not being able to be without mobile phone contact for a little bit oh my there's necrophobia which is the fear of death or the dead some people are so scared of dying but you know we you know we look around it and and we see we see people dying not only physically but spiritually around us and and there's a fear of death but you know jesus says in saint john chapter 15 verse 24 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is past from death unto life brother madam said they're going to say to you one day that william branham died he said william branham died a long time ago amen all night they took me down to the branham tabernacle when i was about five years old and they buried me right there in the cold waters they buried me a long time ago brother david i've been dead for a long time but yet there's something about it people get so scared of death but brother madam said all that death can do he said death is just like a wagon that can only thing it can do is just pull you into the presence of your creator oh my and he tells us that satan cannot take us until it's hard time to go he can huff and he can puff but he cannot blow your house down until god allows him to i think it's so interesting that before satan can do anything to me he's got to go up and knock on my father's door not my earthly father back in jeffersonville indiana but he's got to go up and knock on my heavenly father's door and ask him permission before he can give me a toothache and if god allows him and gives him permission even though that toothache might hurt or even though whatever it is that you're going through might seem like a terrible thing at the time if god allowed it then he has a reason and a purpose in it maybe it's to build your faith for deliverance from and from healing or whatever it would be or maybe it's to get your attention about something or maybe it's to get you in a doctor's office at the right place at the right time so you can witness to the nurse or the surgeon or whoever it would be but god has a reason in it and so if we can trust him there's no reason for me to be afraid [Music] many of you have heard of a general in the civil war by the name of stonewall jackson and they looked at him standing out there and he would stand out right in the midst of the battle and he didn't cower down like a lot of the generals and hide out way back behind the lines but he would stand right out there or sit out on his horse right out in the middle of battle and they would say look at look at jackson how he stands like a stone wall and the reason he could do that he said i've determined that god has predetermined my death with the time and the place of it and he said so when i'm on the battlefield he said i feel just as safe as when i'm in my own living room my what a way to live already passed from death unto life and whosoever liveth saint john chapter 11 26 whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die oh my there's a fear of being alone called monophobia some people are so afraid oh my you know i couldn't serve the lord if i served jesus my husband might leave me and if i did this you know this one might leave me and this friend may go away from me and and if i say if i take a stand for god somebody might unfriend me on facebook and and they're so afraid of being alone but you know i will never be alone because jesus promised i'll never leave thee nor forsake thee so i'll never be alone so i don't have to be afraid of being alone again deuteronomy chapter 31 verse 6 be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee that's that's a promise to the believer this evening there's a fear of nightmares which is hypnophobia that's afraid of falling asleep because you're going to have a bad dream and and maybe that's something you know we've had different children and things come through prayer lines that suffering really badly with nightmares and things i encourage their parents to read the scripture over them before they go to bed at night and to not get their thoughts on fearful things but to get their thoughts on things of god and on good things but proverbs chapter 3 verse 24 says when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh oh my isn't that something be not afraid of sudden fear you know fdr made a statement at his inauguration in 1933 he said the only thing that we have to fear is fear itself well i may not have agreed with fdr on his politics but i do agree with him on that the only thing that you should be afraid of is being afraid amen the only thing we have to fear is fear itself am i what do i have to fear god predestinated me as we looked at this morning i'm going to skip ahead here and read you a quote brother bannon makes a statement here he says in identify identification of christ in all ages 1964 he said he knowed before the world began we would sit here he knowed how many times i raised my hands up and down he now he knowed the words i would say he knowed how many times you would batch your eyes what you would think before the world ever started what are we afraid about god is our father he says that's right what are we afraid about this evening oh to know that god god already knew what would take place and he was already working things in motion to be able to bring you through god knows all about it he knows what your tomorrow holds and and he's not only that but he's holding your tomorrow so why should i be afraid when my father knows all about it he knows what my plan is before i do he knows what my end is before i do and he's allowing certain things to happen to get me into a condition he still has it all in control tonight my fear not little flock saint luke chapter 12 verse 32 it says for it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom fear not jesus told jarius when they came to get him and here his little daughter was dying and the a man comes and runs and tells him so don't bother the master anymore said your little girl is already dead and jesus turns and says one of the strangest things that you would think to say you know when somebody's going through a trial we want to think of something encouraging and and a lot of times that's that's all right but really when somebody is going through something that's really devastating there's there's no words that you can say sometimes just being there is better than any words that you can say but unless it's the words of god what can you say when somebody's lost a loved one that's going to change a lot of that is is just psychology or things like that but jesus turns and he doesn't you know he doesn't give him a 10-step book on how to overcome grief when you've lost a loved one and he doesn't give him a bunch of psychology but he turns to him and says be not afraid only believe looked like if there was ever a time that jarius had a right to be afraid was right then his little daughter laying there dead and he's tried every effort that he could he's he's he's putting money into medicine and doctors and he's tried to do all that he can and finally he's got desperate enough that he doesn't care what the pharisees and the sadducees say about him he's going to get to jesus and he gets there and it seemed like he got there too late but oh let me tell you you never get to jesus too late amen somebody said oh brother nathan you don't understand i backslid and i ran for all these years and i've gone too far it's too late for me if you still have any desire for god in your heart then it's not too late to you jarius it looked like it was too late for him to get to jesus now and jesus turns and says be not afraid only believe elijah one time he goes and he had been sent of god to tell ahab that it wasn't going to rain for three years until he called for it and now he goes back out in the wilderness and god provides him a brook where he's got water and he provides him ravens to bring him food but one day the little brook dries up there and god sends him down to a widow woman's house and he tells her go and make me a meal and bring me some water and she says sir you don't understand i'm making this final meal for me and my son and then we're going to go in here and just commit ourselves to death and he said he said go and bring me a cake first because thus saith the lord the barrel won't drown dry neither will the crews go empty and and she goes in and maybe she had a right to question and oh my what about this one about that he said fear not well if there was ever a time to fear you would think that would be the time down to the last bit of meal in the barrel down to the last little bit of oil in the cruce but he tells her fear not how could she not be afraid in a time like that because she had thus saith the lord you recognize where we stand tonight there's all kinds of circumstances around us that to the outward man and to the intellectual mind it looks like we would have a right to be afraid but we're standing on thus saith the lord now this one i made up but there's a fear that i found around the message and it's called titheophobia [Laughter] the fear of paying tithes now i have a quote for that i don't have a psychological analysis to show you what that means but i do have a quote for it putting on the whole arm of god 1962 he says it comes to paying your tithes into your church you're afraid to do it a fear afraid to do it because you're afraid you'll starve to death even though god's made the promise that he would take care of you malachi chapter 3 verse verses i think 8 9 and 10 through there god comes on the scene he tells malachi said tell them that they've robbed me and they'll say have you robbed me he said you've robbed me in tithes and offerings brother david didn't ask me to say this it was just you know part of the phobia sermon here that we're talking about tonight but but he said i just ask them and tell them to prove me and see if i won't open up the floodgates and the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that they wouldn't be able to contain now i'm not here to preach your prosperity this evening i don't believe in preaching prosperity but i do believe in preaching provision amen god didn't promise that he would he would prosper me with a ferrari and a 10 million bank account he didn't promise me that he he'd prosper me with a 50 000 square foot house but he did promise very specifically that he would provide for me and he told me in saint matthew chapter 6 33 that if i would just seek first the kingdom of god that all these other things my clothing and the roof over my head and the food on my table for my children that he would provide those things if i would just seek him first young people looking for a spouse seek god first and that'll be added to you amen parents looking for a job seek god first and that'll be added to you somebody that's sick in body and looking for healing brother baby said you don't have to even be a christian to be healed but you have to be a christian to be to stay healed so there's a difference so we seek god first and we prove god i've seen him come on the scene time after time not only for myself but as a pastor i've seen you know it's so strange you think the people that had the biggest bank accounts that they would be the ones to quickly say oh my i've got so much money it's easy for me to pay tithes but usually those are the ones that feel like they make too much to pay ties and it's the poor little widow woman with a couple little orphan kids that usually she'll come down and pay her tithes faithfully and i've seen it time after time again where god has blessed it i saw a sister a few years ago i didn't know her need but she came and she paid her tithes and she had enough money in the bank account to either pay her electric bill or to pay tithes and they were going to shut off her electric and she paid her tithes first anyhow and she went home not knowing what the outcome would be and so that was on a sunday she walks out monday morning she opens the mailbox and there's a letter from her work well that's usually not a good sign so she opens that up and opens it up oh what are they going to say in this letter and they said you've done such a good job this last year we wanted to send you a thousand dollar bonus amen why because she proved god and she found out that his word you know even way down here in 2021 his word is still true oh my i've seen some people say oh my i wouldn't pay tithes i don't know what they're going to do with my money i don't know what they're how they're going to handle it hey if i was the biggest hypocrite in all the world and using my the money of god irresponsibly that that you know that god will hold me accountable for that or brother david or whoever whatever pastor or brother that it is he'll hold us accountable for that but he'll hold you accountable for did you just obey my word or not amen i've seen god move on the scene over and over again and bless people like that just by simple obedience to the word of god my i heard a man my dad tells of a pentecostal preacher one time that he had his he had his wallet and his coat and he was preaching he got hot and he took it off and he went to hand that wallet to a man sitting there and he said wait a minute he said do you pay your tithes he said because if you'd rob god you'd rob anybody tie the phobia philippians chapter 4 verse 6 says be careful for nothing now we we read some of these words and sometimes the english word it it confused us a little bit now that doesn't mean we read that and be careful for nothing we think of the word careful it's cautious and and you know i'm i'm so thankful that when brother david read that scripture he didn't interpret it that he would just you know pull out in this blizzard in front of cars and say i don't have to be careful for nothing the scripture said so so i don't believe in stop signs and stop lights i'm just going to pull out not be careful but that word careful that in the english language what it's translated into the actual greek word there is the word miramno i believe i'm pronouncing that right but i may not be to be anxious or to be troubled with cares this is what jesus was talking about when he when he went and he talked to to mary there uh and he talked about how that or martha rather how that she was so troubled and worried about the things of life but but here was mary sitting at his feet or i may have got it backwards you correct me later if i did brother david but but he's saying paul's saying here be careful for nothing don't be anxious don't be troubled with anything don't allow the devil to keep you awake at night worrying about these things be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god the devil wants to keep you up at night worried about things that you can't control and things that you can't change and brother man talks to different people in prayer lines he says now he said i see you're real nervous and you try to cross bridges before you get to them and worried about things like that and it was actually a spirit that the enemy was trying to place on them of nervous oppression to try to get them so worried and upset about things and to live in fear god does not want you to live that way amen it's okay to have a plan it's okay to to plan ahead even though sometimes god's plan is a million miles a long way farther along than anything that we could plan it's okay to plan ahead but don't stay up all night and worried and upset and getting you know stomach ulcers over things that you can't change or do anything about but like brother david said this morning give it to god just give it to god and say god i've done my part and now i'm just going to wait and depend on you to do the part that i can't do brother brandon makes this statement an expectation in 1955 he says now he's talking to a woman in a prayer line now you're suffering from a mental oppression which is nervousness you keep having strange and crazy thoughts running through your mind especially right late of the evening you get real weak many times you have to sit down when the sun's a setting you get a gloomy spell comes on you and the devil's trying to tell you you're going to lose your mind those things are true lady you were praying before you come you prayed said god if you'll give me a prayer card and put me before the platform i will believe you'll heal me that's right if that's right raise your hand that's right i see where you were kneeling there oh my i see where you were kneeling there now she was praying to god in her heart and and yet a prophet of god hears her in another dimension and sees where she was kneeling at i see where you were kneeling there he said uh let me find where i met you now god has a reward has rewarded you and your faith has healed you it's gone from you it was caused from menopause but you're going to be well so go on your road rejoicing and i bless you my sister in jesus christ's name amen people get such a mental oppression and a nervousness and anxiety and the devil coming and bombarding their mind trying to tell them you're going to go crazy you're going to lose your mind you're oh my you're just nuts and he bombards them and oppresses them and it's not something that that they've just made up it may seem something to you you think i'll just snap out of it but to them it's something that's very real that they're going through but it's not something that god intended for them to have to deal with the rest of their life brother banham tells us about how that that different ones would come to the prayer like nervous and upset and sometimes it was genetic or sometimes it was caused by trauma in their childhood or whatever it would be but yet god is god's intent is for you to live a happy life many times in the prayer line brother bran would say go and be happy and sing psalms and rejoice and we think sometimes being a christian means you got to walk around with the frown and so so pious and so zealous and and you know the pharisees had that all figured out and that's how they looked and and here comes jesus happy and rejoicing and the disciples around him and the pharisees wanted them to be sad and depressed and legalistic like they were and he said how can the how can those that are with the bridegroom be sad when he's right there with them well i want to remind you the bridegroom is right here with us walking with us he's biased he's in us he's working through us he said he never leave me nor forsake me why should i be sad when i've got the bridegroom walking right with me along life's path first john chapter 4 verse 18 there is no fear and love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love again ii timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen god gives us wisdom once again i believe i believe in safety as long as it doesn't drive you crazy as long as you don't go nuts with it i believe in and and you know looking both ways before we cross the road that's not what i'm talking about but i i don't believe in looking 80 times before before i cross the road because i'm so nervous and upset that i'm going to hit by hit by a car that i'm living under a spirit of fear there's a spirit of torment that satan tries to place on the people of god and let me tell you if he can't run to you to one extreme then he'll start working on you to the other extreme if he can't make you a fanatic then he'll try to make you cold and formal and if he can't make you be so nervous and upset that that you you're just so anxious and fearful that he'll try to push you the other way to where you just don't have a care about anything but there's a balance in the middle of the road on these things and god didn't want you to have a spirit of fear and to live under the bondage of fear but he came to bring freedom and joy and peace oh my you ever get around somebody that no matter what they're going through just seems like they're always on the mountaintop brother branham said there were those type of people that it said didn't matter you know and there was something about it that man he talks about and when he talks about how the temple was and how the tabernacle in the wilderness was and how that the man living in the outer courts sometimes it was rain sometimes it was snow like it is in in texas tonight sometimes it was sunny skies sometimes it was cloudy skies but the man that had once entered into the holiest of holies there was something about it didn't matter if it was raining on the outside or snowing on the outside didn't matter what was going on the on the outside he had drawn the veil behind him and he was standing there in the holiest of holies surrounded by the shekinah glory that's why people can look at you and you walk through life's pathway and they look at you and think you're crazy because something goes wrong it's your work and you respond differently than they do and somebody gets sick in your family and you respond differently than the person at your job does why because you're walking in an atmosphere that they don't know anything about and you're living in a dimension that the world doesn't understand because he's with you oh my something about it living in this bright age some people have tried to actually make that a different timeline but we're still in the laodicean timeline but we're living in a dimension that the world doesn't know anything out about that god has called us into a revelation of what he's done in this age and we can walk up here above the cares of the world oh my i know my redeemer liveth 1958 and if we were put here for a purpose then there's nothing can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been manifested no matter how much trouble we have much heart how much heartaches or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it there's a reason for it there's a purpose in it god doesn't do things haphazardly but he has a reason for it oh my now jesus when he faced the enemy i i love the way the lord jesus came to the earth and lived his life because he didn't have to come that way brother branham tells us he could have came as an adult he could have came as a mighty king he could have come different ways but he comes and he didn't come and take on him the nature of angels but he comes and he takes on him the nature of the seed of abraham and he comes and he's born in a little manger in bethlehem and he comes to the lowest of the low and he comes to a spot where if you if you go back and research it the the wealthier families would bring a lamb and sacrifice but the families that didn't have enough finances to own a lamb they would bring turtle doves and sacrifice it and when they dedicate jesus there and at the temple and brother bam describes it many times during the sermon expectation here mary and joseph they bring turtle doves and sacrifice it when he's dedicated because they didn't have a lamb to sacrifice and he comes and he's born in a manger he comes to a poor family he comes and he's raised up this way and he did all these things brother graham said can you imagine little jehovah crying in a manger little jehovah playing as a little boy and skin in his knee little jehovah as a teenager the little girl's laughing at him and things like that little jehovah he said oh it ought to do something to us to recognize why did he do it that way it was because he loved you enough that he wanted to understand what you were going through he couldn't understand his spirit what it meant like to be made fun of but when he went into jarius's home and he told him the little girl's not dead she's just sleeping it said they laughed him to scorn and he actually knew what it was like to feel embarrassment and he knew what it was like to stand there at the grave of lazarus and weep because a friend had died and he could go through these human emotions why did he do that so that he would be the right type of intercessor for you and i so that when we went through something and sometimes you go through something you say oh brother nathan i'm going through this trial and maybe that's not something that i struggle with at all i think why why is that a trial why is that that's never bothered me but to you it's something real and maybe i couldn't intercede for you in the right way because i think oh oh that's not a problem for me at all but he knows about it he was tempted in all manners and he knows what it's like to feel the pressures that you go through and he did all that and he comes and he stands and withstands satan there in the desert when he goes and he's tempted in the wilderness and satan comes at him now jesus had the power to just snap his fingers and satan could have disappeared or he could have ceased to exist or whatever i believe he had the power and the authority to do that but brother branham when he tells us about that interaction with with god in the jesus in the desert there after he gets baptized in the river jordan and the spirit drives him into the wilderness now satan comes and tempts him for 40 days and 40 nights and he stands there and he didn't withstand him with gifts or he didn't withstand him with supernatural power but he kept coming back it is written it is written and now satan would come against him and many times satan i want you to notice this because satan when he quoted the word to jesus he he did not come and give him some new translation he did not come and give him the book of the mormon or did not give him the quran he was actually word by word quoting what moses had said but he was taking it out of the context that it was given in sometimes people will creep right into the message and they'll come and they'll present a quote to you and say but what about this or a scripture and what about that but watch the continuity because i don't believe that quotes contradict quotes or that scriptures contradict scriptures but people's interpretation of those quotes and scriptures will definitely contradict one another so when they come and they wave it in your face like satan did there to jesus and said well i'm just quoting the prophet i'm telling you what he said yes but many times they're perverting what the continuity of the scripture was and satan waved that quote in his face and said it is written and jesus turned and said but it's also written and this scripture that moses said can't contradict this other scripture over here so your interpretation is perverted and he withstood satan that way it is written brother branham said why did he do that because he was trying to show that the weakest of christian could defeat satan any time any place under any condition now there's no disclaimer at the bottom of that quote that says except 2020 and 2021 when things get really bad and terrible and no the weakest of christian can defeat satan anywhere any place any time under any condition with thus saith the lord i want to read you a couple of quotes tonight just to build your faith a little before we close uh you know i i um i i've been pastoring there for about 10 years in the new albany area and i i have a pulpit that i can preach in i don't have to i'm not knocking on brother's door saying please let me come preach i don't have to come preach anywhere god has provided me a salary i don't have to beg people for tithes or offerings or things like that god has provided for me i don't come i didn't come here this weekend so that i could try to add to my uh 401k or so that i could try to have another opportunity to preach if it hadn't been for the weather i would have been preaching back at home this weekend so i'm not here to for myself but when i come to church i want to try to encourage somebody whether that's the people out here or the brother back here or whoever it is my goal when i come is to try to encourage somebody because if not i'm just wasting my time and your time and god's time and the pastor's time and everybody else's so my motive this weekend is to try to encourage you as the people of god so i want to drop a few things in here just to remind you of who we are because remember many times satan will come and he'll attack you and you might say oh my what what god did through brother branham was wonderful and how god uses brother david that's wonderful but i'm i'm just a nobody well in one way that's you're absolutely right so am i so is every man that's ever been born except jesus we're without jesus we're just a nobody i hope it doesn't offend you tonight but you you take away uh you take away god from moses and moses was just a man that was running from pharaoh that was a sheepherder on the back side of the desert but you added a god quality there with moses when god came and gave him a commission and all of egypt was no match for moses a one-man invasion you take david out there and all he was was just a shepherd boy but you add god to the mix and all of a sudden he was a giant slayer he was a king he was a man that wrote hundreds of psalms and he was he was wise you take you take a man like like saint paul without jesus saint paul was a persecutor of the church but you come and add jesus and paul and you had the first church age messenger you had one of the greatest ministries ever in the new testament and all down through history you take brother branham and you take jesus away from him and you just had a kentucky hillbilly that was come from moonshine and parents but you add jesus to the mix and my signs and wonders and things that was done some of these people that want to talk about him brother david i say well you you come and show me where god has used you to to have seven truckloads of wheelchairs and crutches and then maybe we'll talk but until god has vindicated you like he did him i'm not interested in hearing your complaint because all you can do is sit and complain and write a website well there's plenty of people out here that can write websites but there's not many out here that are vindicated and so we look for vindication and we look for the word made manifest oh my what was it what was the attraction on the mountain god fulfilling his word remember we look for god's word to be fulfilled and something has caught the attention of the bride in this age that when i when i look at brother branham's life to me i see malachi 4 and i see revelations 10 7. i see luke 17 30. i see all these scriptures that what is it is the word being fulfilled amen somebody said well if i you know what about this and what about you know brother branham didn't pick brother branham god picked brother branham moses didn't pick moses moses tried to run from it but god picked moses so it's not so much you look at somebody like me and and my i'm absolutely nothing without jesus but me and jesus whatever whatever the problem is you just put me on jesus's team or let me say it this way put jesus on my team we'll take care of it together amen just just put me and jesus together we've got it covered and i'm not adding much to that but you put jesus and anybody together and they've got it covered amen in a prayer line you bring up a demon-possessed person cancer whatever it is i can't do very much but me and jesus we've got it covered amen i come up against temptation i would fall flat on my face every time but me and jesus we can overcome it something about it walking with him makes the difference and so many times we get this idea of i'm nothing well you are on your own but with jesus you're more than a conqueror presuming 1962 brother baptist makes this statement the weakest of saint makes the devil tremble now you may not have realized when you came to church tonight that you made devils tremble but i just want to remind you tonight what the word says you say oh i'm just the least of the least brother nathan i'm the weakest i don't i don't have much faith and i don't have well some other time we'll talk about a positive confession and i believe in that too but it doesn't really matter what you think of yourself it matters what god thinks of you the weakest of saint makes the devil tremble again jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever 1955 the devils tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a privilege or what a power he says rather in a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them think of it you recognize now why he tries so hard to steal your time from prayer ma i tell you i've got some things that i can go do at home i can try to go out to eat with a couple of brothers the devil usually doesn't try to interrupt that at all i can try to go down and and go do something for myself go go do a hobby or whatever it is the devil doesn't try to upset that but you try to enter in and spend some time with prayer and my all hell will turn loose and try to stop you from doing that the phone will ring somebody will text oh it's urgent brother nathan please call please do this all this will happen and that will happen somebody knock at the door or something why because the devil is trembling when you go to your knees you say oh brother nathan you must think that you're somebody no if i'm the weakest of christians if i go to my needs in prayer and start having a conversation with the king of kings and the lord of lords the devils begin to tremble because they know something is going to take place he's talking to the creator again oh my maybe it's a little sister well i'm just a housewife well brother brandon said even the housewife has a ministry now her ministry was not to come and try to correct her husband and tell him what to do and how to how to run the house and it was not to come and try to correct the pastors on facebook and tell them what to do but her ministry is to be there to as a helpmate to her husband brother man said not as a doormat but as a helpmate and to be there as a minister to her little children brother baby said there's five gospels matthew mark luke john and mother he didn't say that about the fathers but he said mother was the fifth gospel she has a ministry anything i'm just i'm just nobody than anything but go to your knees one time and talk to him and see how the devils begin to tremble there was a little woman one time she was just a little washed woman that had a burden on her heart brother brandon tells herself that she went down and she'd saved her money and she had tried to do something for god and she rented a livery stable and and she'd been washing clothes on an old scrub board and saved and saved and saved enough money to go and rent a livery stable and swept it out and paid to have tracks printed up and invited a traveling preacher to come through a circuit writer preacher and have a meeting and handing out flyers on the corner and and here she was just a little widow woman not not very much to somebody's thinking of some great something or or some great popular influence or whatever it be and people would just look at them and throw them down and walk on and a little boy came up that couldn't even read and had to have her read the track to him to say what it was and she told him about the meeting that night brother bram said when they got there it was just the woman and the preacher and the little boy that couldn't read a lot of people would have said well we just you know we don't want to waste our time we'll just dismiss service there's not not a whole lot here but they didn't do that they stayed and persevered and the man preached and the little boy came to the altar that night and brother graham said it was dwight and moody and he led a thousand or a million souls to christ all for the efforts of one little woman now she wasn't the one that led all those souls to christ but what if it hadn't been for her efforts you see we have a part to do as well and satan wants to discourage you and keep you from doing your part and make you think you're nothing but god has something for you to do and my if just going to prayer you know if you just think sometimes my i wish i could preach a fiery sermon that would just might would it would shake the devil up and get him mad and i wish i could go out and cast out devils and do all this you want to get devils nervous and upset and give them some type of a stomach ulcer if they have such a thing you just go to prayer and you say lord i'm just here to talk to you again you know it doesn't have to be some great rehearse something something that you read out of a book or anything like that you just talk to him like you would your closest friend lord i have a need again today and i know you care about me and i just wanted to ask you to be with this one and be with that when the lord you know the things i'm struggling with and help and devils start having a nervous fit and their knees knocking together because they know that something's going to take place brother branham said it this way he said two omnipotents have met convinced and then concerned 1962 you say brother branham i'm the least in the church i'm just a little bitty fellow but remember when he ascended on high you see you are raised with him you're in the body and you're with christ right now seated in heavenly places if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you oh my that makes you feel pretty good doesn't it oh i don't have to be a big part of the body i don't have to be the eyes i don't have to be the brain i don't have to be the tongue i don't have to be this god if i'm just the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil in hell is underneath me why he says our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness every even death itself that's right we're more than conquerors in him isaiah said no weapon formed against thee shall prosper nothing shall prosper that's formed against thee let me read you this quote in closing if the musicians want to go ahead and come we're trying to come to a stop here god's covenant god's covenant with abraham and his seed 1956 jesus constantly fear not fear not i am he that was dead and alive forevermore fear not fear not i'm with thee always even to the end of the world fear not and the christian keeps sitting back oh i just wonder he said oh my turn loose amen get all the things away from you say mr satan you are defeated jesus christ stripped you of every power you had and when he died at calvary and you're nothing but a bluff and you can't bluff me he says amen i'm made out of that stuff that don't bluff amen the devil's just a bluff but we're made out of stuff that don't bluff i read that's that quote a while back at church and my song leader wrote a song about it but oh my it's good to know he's just a bluff jesus christ already paid the price already defeated him everything that we have need of jesus already paid the price for what are we afraid of why do we allow the enemy to come and attack us [Music] second chronicles chapter 20 verse 15 says be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but god's it's not your battle in the first place give it to god and see what he can do the scripture says in romans chapter 8 verse 31 what shall we say then to these things if god be for us who can be against us nothing formed against us will prosper i don't care how many viruses they form i don't care what politics tries to change laws and take away religious freedoms or whatever it be no matter what they come up say oh you can't preach against this or preach against that it's a hate crime nothing formed against this can prosper what should i be afraid of i my father owns the cattle on a thousand hills he created the heavens and the earth so that he would have a betting ground to bring you from the dust of that earth so that he could have fellowship with you he loved you that much why should we be afraid i won't fear what man can do for do to me but i'm trusting in the everlasting unseen hands of jesus christ amen let's let's pray together tonight lord jesus lord i pray tonight that the words that were spoken will bring encouragement and strength to your people lord i recognize and the age that we live in many times people get so beaten down and down trodden and they get in a place where they feel like nobody knows what they're going through and nobody understands and that it's just them against everybody else well elijah got in that condition one time lord and you reminded him that there were seven thousand others that hadn't bowed a knee to baal there were others that were that were victorious and that were standing for the truth so father i pray that in this age where there's such a spirit of isolation trying to get the members of the body of christ separated from one another if he can't get him separated over doctrine he'll separate him over church order and if he can't separate him over church order he'll separate him over fear of of of sicknesses and germs and things like that but i pray father that you'd move on the scene and grant healing to your body this great body of jesus christ universally grant strength and overcoming power lord if there's some that have got discouraged and depressed and are living in fear father may you break those shackles of fear may you break those shackles of depression and anxiety break shackles of nervousness tonight father whatever the need i pray lord that as the word went forth not my words lord but the quotes and the scriptures that were read tonight lord we take that to be your word and may those things the scripture said the the word was went forth and healed them lord as the word was preached tonight may it grant deliverance and victory may they recognize their place lord that they don't have to to be bowed down to those things that the devil tries to shackle them with but there's freedom and victory and liberty and peace in the name of jesus that it drives out fear and it drives out doubt oh father we thank you we believe your word i just pray lord that the efforts this weekend lord not only by lord the the pastor or myself or the musicians or song leaders but lord for everyone that made an effort to come out may those efforts not be in vain father but may may you do something to encourage may you do something to grant healing and victory father we give it to you for the outcome lord we commit it to you father lord saint paul said some watered and some planted but it was you that gave the increase father so may you come and may your word be magnified before the people i pray in jesus christ's name let's stand tonight and sing this oh there is power and it's in the name of jesus oh there is power and it's in the name of jesus oh there is power in the name of jesus oh break every chain break every chain break every chain lord break every chain break every chain break every chain oh there is healing and it's in the name of jesus oh there is healing in the name of jesus oh there is healing and it's in the name of jesus lord break every chain break every chain break every chain lord break every chain break every chain break every chain oh there's a bride that's rising up oh there's a bride she's rising up i know god's right she's rising up lord come and break every chain break every chain break every chain lord break every chain break every chain break every chain oh i can hear my chains they're falling oh i can hear satan's chains they're falling oh i can hear every chain of doubt unbelief oh it's fallen lord come and break every chain break every chain break every chain lord break every chain break every chain break every chain oh there's an army that's right god bless you richly [Music] amen do you believe he's rising up an army you know i i believe that more than ever and it certainly can't be an army that's afraid whether god's going to keep his word or not it certainly can't be an army that's afraid to tell people about what god's doing so i i just think that is just such an important part of what it is and you know i we know one thing that fear and failure come from the same spot that faith and success come from it's almost a choice amen and what helps you make a choice in anything you do you look at the facts right and that's what he said satan's voted against you god's word for you your vote is what brings it to the winning side [Music] it's just such wonderful uh reality that you know if you find your heart hungering or well the scripture says those that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled amen so you know you're not afraid of your condition you say lord this is my condition and i'm bringing it to you i'm casting it into your hands i'm placing it in your hands because when you have it it'll be successful amen we just really [Music] are thankful for the good words that we heard this week and and you know i know that many had to stay home this week because of the siberian express that came south here but uh you know it ain't going to last long brother's already prophesied it's going to be 67 degrees and you you believe that right my brother praise god that's that's good enough for me so anyway we're gonna go ahead and dismiss this evening and so that you all can take your time uh getting home and and again there's no service uh wednesday night and i've always tried to use as my mottos when the when the authorities in the highway department and the police asked us if we could stay off the roads that's the time that we try to do it and today wasn't supposed to be bad and the roads weren't real bad today but they're going to get a little rougher the next few days so just try to be safe the best that you can and you know there's one thing about fear as our brother was bringing it that really moved on our heart you know when someone comes along and stands with you and by you that's what takes the fear away and that's what he said he he brother nathan knight said when if he's with you then i don't have to be afraid well you know not everybody has what you have [Music] so you can be [Music] the lord to them you can stand with them and help them with their fear i always loved that scripture that said hearing is the love of god made perfect that as he is self shall we be in this world and so there are people are out there at fear why don't you be their comfort why don't you be their encouragement why don't you stand by someone that's fear and say don't worry we'll take it to jesus together we'll pray together god will get us through us you know be a be a soldier have a testimony of the power of god to keep and to drive that fear away so i i i really i i really love that i really love that word in those quotes tonight and this is what we're trying to tell the world amen that's why we want to invite people to the house of the lord so they can come in and find out that there's a gospel that is a delivering gospel that can deliver them from all those bonds and chains that they have we know somebody who's here with us that'll do it for him we can't do it but we know someone that is and he said that he'd be here so that's where we're bringing him we're bringing him at him and we're casting our cares upon him for he cares for us let's pray and we'll sing this as our dismissal song father we've had great words of encouragement this weekend [Music] father the wisdom of your word and how that you've taught us and spoke to us this weekend and how to approach life

take with us and build into our character father that not only is it our character that's going to take with us but father it's our character that's going to bring people to you and lord we just ask that you continue to build us into that statue of a perfect man that we would be fearless father with the testimony on our lips the prophet of god said be fearless in your testimony lord we just ask
