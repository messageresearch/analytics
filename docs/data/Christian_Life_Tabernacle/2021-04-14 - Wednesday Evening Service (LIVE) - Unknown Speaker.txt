speak to us we commit everything we are to you and invite you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you i want to trust you excited to be in the house of god amen want to welcome everyone tonight let's open our bibles we want to read a couple of scriptures and let's start with uh revelation chapter one first let's read 17 and 18. it says that i'm i am he that liveth and was dead i'm getting a lot of echo up here if you could just tell i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the key to hell end of death amen let's also turn into the scriptures in mark chapter 16. mark chapter 16. let's start from verse one it says and when i'll wait for you to get there and when sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and solomon and salome had had bought sweet spice that they might come and anoint him and very and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll out away the stone from the door of the sepulcher and when they had they looked they saw that the stone was rolled was rolled away for it was very great and entered into the sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the on the right side clothed with a long white garment and there was there were afraid or frightened and he said unto them be not afraid ye see ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where he where they laid him also let's turn in romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised him that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you it's he he that raiseth up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by this by his spirit that dwelleth in you so i want you to really picture here it says if the spirit if but if the spirit of him that raised up christ or jesus from the dead so so he's talking about the spirit of him that raised christ from the dead he's not saying the spirit of jesus that raised him from the dead so there's a spirit of him if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you in other words he got that spirit from some place and then he says that it dwells in you and and he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you so the same spirit that was in him gets put in you and he produces the same thing amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and we'll we'll try not to be too long i've just been pondering on some of the messages our pastors been preaching and some of the tapes we've been hearing i i know i was uh i was listening to the message the rising of the sun and and and it's it's almost it's almost it's when you when you listen to the easter seal and the rising of the sun it's almost the same message it's it complements itself very well you you look at here you see certain things and you look and you see the same things being repeated and tonight just for a few minutes i would like to speak and my title tonight is it's all about the resurrection it's all about the resurrection and i would i want to just open up to say that um it's very important we we we know what we are here to do or what the focus of what the real thing is all about uh we realize that it's the resurrection life that brought jesus out from the dead it's the resurrection life that would bring out of us the manifestations of sons and daughters it's not our life it's the resurrection life it's not anything we we conjure up because we read so many scriptures it's not when we shout it up or we get all emotional it's the resurrection life that does it and and and and so we could we could definitely focus on that and say i want the resurrection life it's the one it's it's the very life that takes you back and makes you a son and the daughter that you're supposed to be from the beginning of what god thought of you it's the it's way i don't want to say this until you receive the resurrection life you haven't started living yet you are still dead in sin and trespasses resurrection life is what brings you to life it causes you to actually do the works that you were supposed to do when you get here it's one i want you to think about resurrection as being a stream of life when you get into that stream of life you actually come back like the story of an eagle you come back to what you are supposed to be you you come back to something that you always desire and he puts you forward for the purpose of the kingdom in order for you to achieve something resurrection life it's it's it's it's the resurrection life that brings us into a place where we can even serve the very purpose of god but random tells us that it's only the things that have served the purpose of god that will rise again it's not when we go just living all kinds of life and then you know at the end we think they're gonna weigh our balance and then find out if we did a lot of good or a lot of beds and find out where we fall no it's when we have this resurrection life within us that's what causes us to be different that's what stops our lying that's what stops i like that song give me that old-time religion why because it's the real thing it's the things that bring the change and i want to say even as we got the here tonight we want the real thing i'm not here to gather for somebody to give me some painted sermon and trying to make me feel good and trying to just give me something and then i can go and then come back and need more no i want a real life i want something that when i get out of here i'm no longer the same and that thing is the resurrection life and that's where our focus is supposed to be and so that's why i was thinking about even the story but random says you know when he was talking about insurance it says they would say you know i said yeah i'm telling i'm selling insurance and it says what insurance are you selling and it says and finally the men come around and i said well really i like what you're saying but you know that's not he says but when you get in the grave what's going to happen to you and all of that it said i'm not so concerned about what happened to me when i get in the grave i'm not so concerned about what happened to this flesh what i'm concerned about is a power that can bring me out of the grave and that power is the resurrection life that power is the power of the lord jesus the power the same power that raised him up from the dead is made available to the believers and so it becomes very important we realize that's the life that we we want and the resurrection life it's not something that we get when we go out in the grave you die and somewhat some power comes into the grave it opens up the graves and he pulls you up no resurrection is the power that lives within a believer that when the flesh goes into the grave that power is already in him to bring him out of the grave and that's the power that we're talking about tonight we're not interested in some uh hockey spokes and some demonstration or a man coming and speaking in such a place where our minds get filled up and yet we don't have the life we want the life more than anything you know i'd say this i was thinking about maybe perhaps i learned this from brother mike he said one time i was talking to him it says the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing and i began to think about it when i was studying this the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing which means there's going to be something that's going to try to distract you from the main thing there's going to be something that's going to be presented as replacement for the main thing and your job will be to look at everything and say this is still the main thing your job will be to rearrange everything and say i know about this side this is wonderful i like this i liked it but what i'm desiring is the resurrection life [Music] but when i'm speaks and he says he speaks it says now listen uh here's another thing it says for proof it's so quick and it's so quick in them in such a way till you know what see they lifted up in they were lifted up in heavenly places the moto bazi was so quickened and he's speaking about the day of of of pentecost he says the mortal body was so quickened that that that till their language changed and then it says they only quicken their language it says it says that's what the bible says the moral body being quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quickened their spirits were quickened their life were quickened they were quickered all together they talked and spoke in new language in heavenly language who it says what a quickening power and i look at it and i says that's the kind of power that i want you know i i you know some advice you you you you get to a place where you get tired of looking at yourself and tired of of your humanity of your own thinking and your own everything and and you know this is my thinking and this is this you want something to come something that could be real something that you can know this is no longer me this is god moving in my body you know like paul says that the life which i now live now he didn't say the life when i go to the grave when i come out of the grave the life that i will have will be no it says the life which are now at this present moment not in the future at this present moment the life which i now live it's not my own it's his life and and there has to be a people in the end time who can stand and say the same thing why because that eternal life has been made available he says in the rising of the sun it says now and it speaks about easter he says it says today it's the walls today it's the memorial service it says at least in the united states and this side of the earth this morning it says in the church throughout it's a celebration of memorial the greatest triumph that man has ever had he says i think think of a savior when he died as in he says or even as an infant when he was born he says he could not have been uh he could have not have been here lest being uh less being becoming into the earth it says when he dies certainly he is he atoned for all our sin and yet being made fine like little babies are born there's been many men who are who have suffered and died real causes but there never was one that could raise himself up until today until this day and he continues on it says now it's the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all time this easter he says it's where he proved that that that what he has said men can say things but yet he isn't exactly that can believe upon upon thoroughly until it's been proven to be true and as an end as god who said uh prove all things he says hold flats to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that will not do that he will not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sins now here you know men can say so many things i was thinking about even you look at the religious world and and the world around us you know we talk about easter easter is celebrated by all christians but yet it it's still only a representation of some flowery something that happened and and oh it was a good man who gave his life and and and how that he he gave his life so we might live and all of that and all it is it's just superficial all it is there is no uh resurrection life moving there's no oh that life that that died and that person that gave himself up for me his spirit is dwelling in me no it's all superficial and then they go on and then they wait for the next easter to do the same thing again so it's not about how good a person was it's not about how they gave themselves they were meaning against themselves but talked about this many good men that died but yet what made the difference was the resurrection why because within this one was the mighty god himself coming to a word according to the promises that he made that he can take that body and he was born to be a sacrificial lamb so he can give the body and once the body was given the spirit will come back upon the people [Music] and unless you receive of that spirit you receive of that resurrection all it is is just a good sermon all it is is just good conversation all it is is just stimulating our minds with scriptures and everything oh but i tell you it's more than scriptures it's more than just a conversation it's a real life and i'm looking at it tonight that's what i sending here it's a life that changes the way you talk it causes you to walk different it changes the very desire that you have in your heart it puts the love of god within you it causes you to walk difference to talk different you can actually look at yourself today and say i'm not what i used to be why it's because of that life it's a real life he says and as people today they are trying to say uh we would we we would wash our feet and once a year and thursday and friday we should take communion we should take the communion and and all the different doctrines they argue uh they argue about whether it should it should be this day or that day whether it should be a sabbath day the first day of the week all things are just merely tradition all things it's just become another tradition and he says what good would do w would any within with anything do to you whether it's length or length or if there's if there's no life in you it's it's only a memorial which there's nothing against but they can have certain uh carriers out of the tradition but left off the main thing they've left off the main thing they can carry on in tradition but they've left off the main thing so so now he said satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are in you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you don't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good you are how many churches you belong to and and will god will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again it says therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up from the for for up for a memorial he asked a question he says it is the resurrection this morning only it says one day a year ago a certain day that we celebrate oh oh it says are we benefactors of his resurrection what does it mean to me what does it mean to you now believe it believe now we believe by faith that he raised him from the dead and but what we have what what has what has got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago you know that that that's the question that could be asked he writes him up 2 000 years ago what has got that to do with me today now but what about him talks about the uh the the resurrection it says it's as we read the scripture it's the rising of the sun and and and and obviously we understand it was a type of what happens in the natural but we we can look in our bibles we're not going to turn their uh we we know it all too well i don't want to waste any time on it i don't i just want to for the sake of time the scripture tells us that in the beginning the earth was dark it was filled with water and it was without form and void and the scripture says that god said let her be and there was light and then we find out to ask a question what was the purpose for that light to come up now we find out that barbara tells us that god had a seed that dwelt underneath that water and that seed had to come to light to the resurrection that seed had to receive life in order for it to be resurrected so when he said let her be the sun came out and what the sun did when it came out the sun began to dry up the water it began to warm the earth he began to do all of that work what was he doing it was doing it for the sole purpose to facilitate that the seed that were planted underneath the water will receive the sunlight and come to birth and i'll say this there was nothing that could stop the life from the sea to come forth the sun had made the way the sun had removed the obstacle the sun has dried up the water the sun has warmed up the earth the sun had done all the work that was supposed to be done and all the seed had to do was to believe the message that the sun was bringing and began to walk out of the married clay began to walk out of the ground and began to manifest what was hidden in them from the beginning oh i tell you that's not different from the son of man when he was given up to tie he had paid for all the sins of the man he had done all that was supposed to do he removed the obstacle that separated you from god that that that the cavern or or the the the the hole that was built up that no man could feel he came and he filled it up he made a way and this and tonight you can stand up as a son and daughter and say i go to god and i believe his word and receive the benefits of calvary the son was the one who removed the obstacle it's not us it's not us that did anything all we had to do was to receive all the earth was supposed to do was to receive the gospel that the sun was preaching all the earth the seed underneath all he had to do was to accept the message that the sun was preaching and the sun was preaching that there's going to be life on earth today there's going to be life on there today and i want to say that the sun continues to preach that message every day because without sundays no life if the sun refuses to come out there won't be no life if the son preaches a different message there's not going to be life therefore i want to say to us this morning or tonight it's not what we do it's not what kind of gospel we have received it's the resurrection life that has been spoken because just like the son talked about the earth telling him that there's going to be a resurrection jesus christ came and preached the same gospel that the son was preaching and he came vindicating it and showing us there's going to be resurrection he came and i'll say this it was the purpose of the sun to dry up the water it was not the purpose of the seed to dry up its own water it was the purpose of the sun to warm the earth to provide an environment where that seed could come out it's the purpose of the rising of the son of man the son of man who came and he gave his life that's what made a way so we could receive life so find out burbanham says it's the same way in the spiritual the rising of the sun it will bring us it brings us the rev the resurrection now we can uh we we could just look for a moment let me just read this uh for a moment but it says in the quickening power it says what does it do listen so so that you'll know and this is easter it says i want it to mean more to you than any easter has ever did i want i want you to see it you know what it's done for him but i want you to see it not will it has done the same for you we're not talking about some future tense this resurrection that we're talking about is a present tense something that we can get into tonight something that we live by every day something that we talk by something that we think by something that guides us every day why for the purpose of manifesting the will of god the son was not sent to perform its own will it was sent to perform what the will of god was from the beginning and every seed that was planted every seed that was planted the moment he saw the sun rise the moment he saw the sun coming up he knew within itself that it's time for me to rise up and stand it's the gospel it's the good news they receive it and they produce what it was supposed to produce so it says but i want you to see it not not will it has done the same for you what does it do it quickens your mortal body this mortal body it says that we live in it quickens it in other words it brings it to life now he he said it's one place and i probably won't be able to get to it it says uh what the resurrection resurrection is not replacement resurrection is not replacement in order for something to be resurrected it has to have been a life at some point in time so we're not receiving a life that was never ours to begin with we are not receiving something that is new that we never heard of all that the son of god is doing all that this resurrection is doing for us is bringing us right back into the condition that god intended for us when we came here on earth that's why i made a statement we haven't started living until we receive resurrection life why because the purpose of the son of man was to break the works of the enemy and to show to every other seed but of adam says it was the chief wave offering of the resurrection when he rose from the dead now i want you to think about what the devil did and all the ones the prophets and all that came before jesus and all that came and a great man that preached the gospel and abraham and and jacob and all of them they were held up by by by satan and the power of death in other words you know if there was something that man could seem like they couldn't break it was the power of death so he he held up everybody and brahmanam says it was the trinity of the devil it was the powerful hell death and the grave he held up everyone that came before jesus so when he showed up the first thing that he had to do was to take care of the obstacle just like the sun in the beginning he had to come and make a way so that resurrection could take place those men had preached and not all these things but the power of death they couldn't hold it so it came he came and the devil came putting the power of death within him and somehow in the virgin body that sin and the power of sin and the power of death was completely dissolved the power of sin the power of death to cause a man to die that power was taken into jesus and completely dissolved he tried to take it back and there was nothing coming out he tried to pull it out there was nothing coming out why he made done away with the power of the of of death and therefore all those that were in there were supposed to come out on the resurrection day oh brother sister what a news what a news it is and i tell you that's why i want to tell to us that i live in here sitting here this morning that we have something to rejoice about we have something to shout about we have something to thank god about why because resurrection has taken place that power has been dissolved all that the enemy could do now when death comes to you all he does for the son of god is bring him into the presence of god the other door that will take you down to hell to a place where you can be hidden that door has been shut that door has been taken away the only door that remains is for you to go into the presence of god that's why jesus said because i live you shall live also why it's the power of the resurrection that's the power by which we stand and i want to say this don't ever forget what the power did for you you know we can get all intellectual we cannot get them and lost in the books but never forget what our power did for you i was thinking about i said oh what would we be without that power tonight the power saved us it held us it removed alcohol and removed drugs we removed the things of the world it took us away from the bondage of sin it got some out of prisons and open all kinds of doors what is that resurrection power why was that god the son of man is already risen up the only thing the seed could do is just walk out of those things and i want to say this tonight if you have a need or something don't ever forget what power that did it for you don't think it's another power that's going to come do it it's the same power the same power that got you out of sin it's the same power that will provide in fact i'll say this when you receive the resurrection rapture is already started in you [Applause] we're sitting in heavenly places that's what the scripture has all we're waiting is for just this body to be dissolved there's already another one waiting on the other side why because resurrection power is calling for it [Music] oh what a great day i tell you we're not here to preach some oh this is the 10 steps on how you're going to get better this is the 20 steps on how we're going to arrange you this is how you need to exercise every day so you can be fit all you need to do is eat of the book all you need to do is go on your knees and pray and the benefits of what's been given god has given us the authority to claim it every day if there's something lacking by the power of the resurrection you you have the right to stand up and say i need my healing i need my salvation i need my lost one safe i need this why because it was already paid for it's part of calvary the scripture says in ephesians it says ephesians chapter 2 he says and you had it quickened who were dead in sin and trespasses wherein in time past walk according to the council of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among you you had we had of a conversation in time past and the loss of the flesh the fulfilled fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind whereby nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy oh thank you god for your mercy you know it's that when we come to the realization and the recognition of this that's why we extend grace to other people that's why when we look at the person on the streets we come to the realization that they i didn't make myself what i am i didn't make myself love god god placed something within me i didn't make myself christian because if i did i'll walk right back out oh but something the quickened power of god came and found me where i was and he did something for me and i don't care how people think i'm crazy but something within me just want to thank him it's an individual testimony it's you looking back and standing there and realizing god you changed me i know it's in my soul that you changed me and that quickening power is here to do work he's here to continue that same work he's here to perfect you daily to change your nature to bring you into that perfection but oftentimes guess what we do we begin to look at our flesh oh you know we want to be perfect in our flesh and we want to trust in the flesh or god does it and then our head gets big and we think it's ours and you know we think it's holier than me you know you have to come and be a little holy and everything it's god that made the way. i tell you but when it says we are no different than the person working up in the street if it was not for the quickening power of god that came and found you and he wants you to have that enthusiasm to show the world so somebody can also be touched by the same power why because he's looking for his seeds he's looking how is he looking he's making a way he's drying up the circumstances he's removing the obstacle you know many of us sometimes god had to put you in the place where you were cornered you know there was not many options left you know you tried everything and you realized oh my i'm i'm getting close to dying now and then you call out to god why it was an appointed time that he knew he had an appointed time for that seed and i want to say this even those of you that grew up in the message you have to come to a place don't ever let that quickening power go away realize that it's the quickening power that god puts in your parent that kept you that protected you and now it's your time so you can come in contact with that same quickening power and it will do for you what it did for your parents it'll make you love god it'll make you forsake the things of the world it'll make you walk according to it word you know often times you know we we have to stand up here to pass that understanding or preaching about facebook about this and about our dresses i tell you just take a drink of this quickening power nobody will have to tell you how you should dress nobody will have to tell you whether you should leave social media or not the reason is we've stopped drinking from the quickening power get lost in him and see what he does oh you would fall in love with him and then nothing in the world will matter it's the quickening it saw that's why i want to say it's all about the quickening power it's not about how good we look or how impressive we look it's about god i need a quickening power i desire it others can scream and shout and do all they want but i want to scream when i have it i want to move when i have it i want to do all of this when i feel it move within me why because it's the power that brings about the change so so we find out as we write it as the quicken it says by his grace god reaching mercy for his great love wherein he loved us he says even we were dead in sin dead in sin had he quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and has raised that up together made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the edges to come oh my that in the edges to come that it may show the exceeding great riches of his kindness towards us you know i tell you the celebration in heaven is not gonna be how strong we were or how weak we were all that's gonna happen is you just come to the place where you realize how did i get here what did i do what did i give in order for me to receive this it's the celebration of the grace of all you think about the grace that saved you in a car accident the grace that saves you in the body of death the grace that saves you from the alcohol it's the celebration of his goodness towards us christ in you the hope of glory now i just want to move forward for a little bit and and and so barbara says i'm running out of town but i'm speaks about how yeah we are it's that resurrection so we live into that resurrection and everything that's produced is produced through this resurrection power that lives within us so now he he he he he now talks uh uh he says uh the secret of of of of life and death was broken on that it says but uh when the real seal had been broken it says one says one who once lived as we lived died as we died has risen from the dead that morning never was like one in all the history of mankind the secret was made known that it was life that it was made known that he was both life and resurrection now he says again here it says but the trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and had broken the seal and conquered the enemy and rose up one true living god i am he that was dead and am alive forevermore i have the key to death and hell god in one made a man dwell among us and conquered every enemy and proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and the trinity of god was made known cause only god alone had the power to bring life back again it says he was emmanuel god had been made manifested in flesh now i want to say this and and he says all of this he done it so he can make us beneficiary of this resurrection so he has made us so we can know that there's a resurrection and we are partakers of it because we were part of the sea that was supposed to come up and i want to even say this even before you came that provision was already made for you that when you come back up when you when you were born you you now he died 2000 years ago but the benefit will still be able to be drawn today was still being made available today now he he now says in the message again he says he makes a comment he says what what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is now i just want to for a moment dwell on this before i could close now it's now important we realize as far as man is concerned even as far as we are sitting here the same question was settled the price was paid we have been brought into that resurrection by the life we live we have been brought up that resurrection is the one that cleaned you and called you a son of god and did all of those things that he did for you so if we're sitting here it's because of that resurrection that happened now but there's also another resurrection that happened in this end time he says what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is and i would just want to touch this for a moment now when he died for when he died when he came the first time we understand he came for the purpose of praying our sins the things that men had fallen for god came in the form was born as a baby and a manger and he would give up his life to be given as a sacrifice now and but then at the end time a promise according to malachite 4 that he shall return us to the faith of our fathers that it will send a message that will return us to the faith of our father and i want to ask you if the death of christ was enough then why send another one now we realized it was enough because he paid for all our sins but i want you to realize the promise at the end time was between the first resurrection and the second resurrection and revelation chapter 5 was right in between it so he had to die go to the father and then come back in revelation so he can come back and fulfill revelation chapter 10. so the first part of his resurrection was so that he can give us life back the second part of this resurrection was so he can come and claim that which he had died for oh my brother my sister that's why when we say it's taking us back to pentecost we're not talking about the gift we're not talking about those things he's talking about the faith of the father what was the faith of the father there were people that received a promise and the believed the promise and went and waited based on the promise and on the day of pentecost god fulfilled the promise [Applause] oh but there's another promise at this time and this end time is not a promise to turn us back because god doesn't go back it's not to turn us back so we can just speak entangled or rejoice with the gift no it's the promise to bring us into another body it's the promise to bring adam right back into god and again [Music] the resurrection at the end time there's nothing stopping a believer to become god on earth [Applause] [Music] the resurrection at the end time is bringing us right back into a condition where god has given you the right to speak the word that's why i love what our pastor said even about brothers call him to come and baptize he said you baptized why because the coming of this end time is the bright body of god god manifesting in his people doing the same thing that he did when it was jesus not just in the pasture but in the body [Music] this resurrection we saw a man come as a first fruit he was able to bring scroll into existence he was able to bring forth the third pole oh and i tell you when we receive that resurrection we have no need to go back but to go forward you know i i i didn't want to say this but i'll say you know there's a terminology where you know i believe the youth will get it where somebody will say i got your number i got your number and i'm not saying it in a sense i have your telephone number but someone and i and i heard it so much in sport where a person knows all your tactics that there's no way you can win against them i got your numbers in other words there's nothing the devil can pull off that he can win why the same god who won in heaven that same god came and won on calvary that same god come and dwell in his people oh i tell you and he knows how to recognize him that's why he's not afraid of us as a people all but when the same power comes within you he knows how to recognize it [Music] but says our body becomes the temple of the dynamics the same spirit that that that one against him he knows how to recognize it and and i say if that's true i don't want anything else i'm not i i don't want any gimmicks i want that same resurrection power i want to look at the devil in the edit then i got your number i got your number why because the same god who overcame you the same god is living in me the same god who conquered you the same god is living in his people why for the purpose of manifesting his word in the end time he said he will have a bride without throttle wrinkle or any such thing how is he going to have it oh the perfect word has come quickening power oh i tell you i think i was reading you know but whenever he talked about when divine love is projected he talks about how when he went across that those fences and he began to go and he he says that that bull had just killed a person a couple of days ago but he said when i looked at him there was nothing in my heart but love there's nothing in my heart what was it quickening power it will put love within your heart it's not by strength it's not by mind it's by mom it's about the spirit of god if the musician could come oh i don't know how many desire the quickening powder now oh i just want to be filled with it tonight i don't need any gimmicks i don't need any understanding of man i want the quickening power something that makes me real something that makes me be real something that makes me act like i'm supposed to be acting not not someplace not get to where i'm uncomfortable and this and this when all of that is said and done i want the real me to come out and say i take this situation under my control why because quickening power has been made available not to take us back but pastor said to move out into not maturity this this revealing of the word at the end time is to bring us into adoption and adoption is when a son or a daughter has been given the right to sign the check and to speak in the place of the father and not that that we can glorify ourselves there's nothing at us we've been clean we've been saved we've been it's taken all of the desires of the flesh out of us it's taken even our self pride away from us he's made us just like just like the batch of skin in the old testament he's made us people that only desire one thing what pleases the father and when we get to that condition you have the right and i want to say this just like the first resurrection you had the lie the right to come and claim those benefit benefits of that calvary we have the right to come back and say god i i want love within my heart i want to claim my son and my daughter why because it's not you speaking you're basically speaking what was already spoken in the beginning like adam in the garden of eden but the scripture says when he named the animal god looked and said that's it why because it was a mind transfer why because it was only speaking what was in the father's heart why because it was only expressing what the father was oh isn't that your desire tonight i want to express god with every bit of me i don't want to hide anything i don't want to have any doors i don't want him in i want to open up i want to have that quickening power fill every fiber of my bones to where i'm only speaking what he would have me to speak to where i'm acting like to where i'm speaking and god comes and honors it he says moses spoke and god honors it that's the quickening power one god bless you let's all stand tonight [Music] [Music] back in history unfair all proving over and over that his work has never changed but i can't keep on dwelling on surpass memory oh and he's [Music] we spoke to [Applause] [Music] see [Applause] [Music] sing the second fruit [Applause] [Music] living in jesus [Music] in these last days i'm beginning to see it's the same god who's living in me [Music] [Applause] he's the same god who's wondered to me [Applause] the raging red sea he's the same god who's with me [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] see [Applause] [Music] praise the lord my we got a lot to be thankful for amen oh my he could have kept going another hour too i'd have been okay with it my this ain't a man's religion we're feeding on this is the body word of the son of man we have quickening power we got the devil's answer we got his number and we saw one coming this day with quickening power redemption's claim the title book it's all opened it's all revealed [Music] speaking squirrels into existence that was the first one that was showing us what we're coming into we just got to be willing to lay it all down say lord whatever your will is there's a new testament church rising up amen and i'm one of them are you one of them oh my not not a denominational church we're not going back to the pentecost of outpouring of gifts and and so we can we can all pat ourselves on the back but no there's a new testament church that's rising up with the fullness of the power of the resurrection and one of these days we're just going to step right into eternity i believe i'm looking at a house full of people that are called to manifest that old death we're just saying oh grave where is your victory that we're going to be the manifestation of the promise amen we're rising up rising up well there's a new testament church rising up rising up [Music] see god's mighty hand
