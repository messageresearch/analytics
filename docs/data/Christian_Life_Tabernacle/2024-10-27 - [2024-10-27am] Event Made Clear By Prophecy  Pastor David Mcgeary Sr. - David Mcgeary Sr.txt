Description:
Event Made Clear By Prophecy
Pastor David Mcgeary Sr.
October 27, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

thank you for your prayers um thank God everything went well to with the doctor and I'm so blessed to be here [Music] Saye speech [Music] Grand [Music] for now [Music] [Music] to now [Music] is [Music] fore now the [Music] toe now the [Music] May [Music] us fore [Music] glor [Music] me CHR me [Music] glor me [Music] [Music] amen God bless you I'm really nervous I don't like giving testimonies but I just can't get this one off my mind so um I prayed last night and said God if I'm supposed to give it let me know and this morning it's like he was screaming at me so um I you might think it's trivial I I didn't think it was trivial at the time um y'all know Kristen my daughter she's got five children from 12 all the way down to one so she's got a lot of built-in babysitters and um Penelope wanted to watch Joseph Joseph is the baby um Penelope is 10 and so Kristen's like as long as you watch him she teaches them very well to watch them very closely so Penelope took Joseph upstairs and they were playing and about 10 minutes later Penelope came downstairs screaming just frantic um she had seen Joseph put something in his mouth and she did her best to jump over there as quick as she could and sweep his mouth but she didn't get to him quick enough and she's like Mom I it was a push pin mom it was a push pin so Penelope was just devastated because she was responsible um so Kristen sent SOS please pray to the family and she took him to the emergency room and um can you put at that picture of Joseph so this is Joseph that's my youngest grand um he didn't know what was going on he just knew he was at the hospital having fun um so they did an x-ray and can you put put up the picture of the X-ray and if you look real close to the top I don't know if they can zoom in on there there's a push pin pushing into his esophagus pointing toward his heart so um they couldn't do anything for her at the hospital she was at so they said you have to go downtown that's where they're set up to operate on babies he's going to have to be operated on to get that push pin out of there well Scott her husband my son-in-law he was actually on call at that hospital they sent her to that night so she gets there and they're getting the doctor and everything and the doctor on call was the head pediatric surgeon from Children's Mercy Hospital in Phoenix um just as a fluke he happened to be on call that night he's like I I never go on call they just needed me so they took her in took him in for surgery and he said we have three options we're going to go in with a fixed uh endoscope and try to get it if we can't get that we're going to go in with the flexible endoscope and try to pull it out of his stomach and if that doesn't happen we'll come out and have another conversation so they went in and he came back out about 15 20 minutes later they had to put him under put a breathing tube down his throat all the kind of stuff you do when you're being operated on and he come out about 20 minutes later holding a push pin and um he had went down and literally grabbed it right off the bat out of his esophagus and uh we know it was God because that push pin could have kept going no telling what kind of damage it could have done um I just feel like I need to give praise to God for protecting my grandson huah amen let me say this it pays to be a Christian amen it pays to to have someone you can call on and you know that is there the present help in times of need amen we certainly praise our God for that amen Amen brother Shel vill writes would like to thank God for giving another year to Junior Ezekiel uh so want to wish him happy birthday uh sister Lesley write there's a signup sheet uh for dessert for uh lunch and on Saturday November 9th in the library and this is for our November meeting so uh don't forget it's about two weeks away from now and so we want to make all the efforts we can to attend and and everything and so we certainly appreciate that uh also brother Jose writes please pray for a friend who needs Deliverance so we want to uh lift up brother Jose's friend pray that the Lord will touch him amen so today uh don't forget we only have one service so today is a very special day am man how many knows that you know um you know I was I was thinking about just a pastor Brother David and you know there's so many things that about him that I can talk about and we probably won't have enough time but I just want to say this um the characteristics that God has built him with and is placed in him they hard to find many places then you know a man who's a selfless man who who doesn't put himself and he's not looking for Glory he's not looking for recognition or some form of reputation I there are very few pastors that really want you to know what the prophet said that's right most of them they'll try to be your interpreter you know every time you have a problem they they try to tell you what the prophet said and what he means and everything but he's one of those that he placed the message so that when he stands here he speaks we know what the prophet said we are in one Accord we are in one we are walking together you know I've always thought about brother bam says that you know a good shepherd He said smells like a sheep that's the qualification that's that's Brother David for you he he's not looking for Honor he's not looking to be known and he's just there and he's not afraid to walk alone when he sees something and God reveals a way to him and he goes you know there's often times he says things and I'm looking I'm like I have no idea but you patiently wait you patiently study the word you patiently God starts to open up and you see oh now I see that and and I want us to just show our love and appreciation you know today just make sure you know if you can just stop by and after service we only have one service so this afternoon at 400 p.m. we'll have the meals that's prepared and you know so we can uh uh have something to eat and celebrate his birthday he's a quarter of a century old so we we really need to we don't want when he's gone for us to gather said you know then everybody comes and say how wonderful it was no I don't think so I think today is the day you take time and you just tell them how much we love and appreciate him a a man who's who's giving himself for this gospel so we can know within ourselves not through him but build the personal relationship with Christ amen so I'll invite brother Matthew to just come and say a word and take this before the Lord I just thought I wanted us to to be reminded this building that we are in it was because someone had a vision yeah someone gave of himself someone was moved by the Lord and he came and he pushed and and and and that's why we are here so let's just appreciate him and celebrate him today amen let's pray Lord how we love you we thank you that we have this opportunity Lord to bring these needs before you Lord there's many needs that are represented here that are unspoken Lord we know that you made a way for every single need Lord and by Faith Lord we're just resting in Your Word of Promise Lord that if we would ask anything in your name that you would Grant it Lord so we're just just lifting all of these needs up to you Lord and we're asking your blessings upon the tithes and the offerings Lord knowing that you'll reward those Lord that give as they take you at your word Lord we just committ it to you and ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the lord well today's a very special day a very special birthday as many of you know and maybe some of you don't know but this is also evans's fifth birthday and um yeah as me and brother Billy were talking and just thinking of something to say uh for Brother David I I couldn't help but get overwhelmed um and I won't uh for the sake of time I'll be very brief but you know it was a joyous occasion back in 2019 as I was we were going to give birth to Evan and it just so happened to be on my my dad's 70th birthday and there was some complications and you know um they lost Evan's uh heartbeat and all of a sudden that a voice came in and said what you thought was going to be joy and you thought you were going to mark your your father's 70th birthday with joy and the gift of a grandson is going to be a mark of death and all of these thoughts just started to pour in but then Faith anchored and said you know perfect love cast out fear and it was a a supernatural moment not to go into the story but God moved on the scene and brought forth a a healthy baby boy and I I was just thinking of of that as now um here we're celebrating our pastor's 75th birthday and you know in 1978 this time of year he was 29 years old going to pack up a family and move to Bedford Texas to start a church and I read this quote uh this morning brother brandham said in Return in Jubilee I I was uh just listening to a sermon that our pastor had referenced that was on his heart and and I jumped out of that when brother brandham said something and caught this he goes goes to show What Faith Can Do I think if a person is ever sure in their heart and have something that faith can anchor on they should never cease no matter how many times they're defeated they should continue on Brother David has hasn't ceased uh there's been a lot of Trials a lot of hardship what would seem like many defeats but when you're sure of something can you imagine moving to this area in 1978 with without a church body in the Dallas Fort Worth area and sojourning and walking alone but when you're sure of something in your heart regardless of how many times you might fail no matter how many people walk away there's one thing he was sure of that God called him here to be a pastor and regardless of of number regardless of Tri Tri regardless of hardship there's one thing he had was an absolute and I believe that we can all testify that we see the fruits of What Faith Can Do and when you when you have an absolute just stay with that absolute which is the word of God and Faith's final resting place is the word and I say it's a special occasion this might be a little odd but I I just want to sing one of his favorite songs Joy is the flag flown high in the castle just in honor of him he loves that song we we actually sing that with um uh with our birthday songs but 75 years amen God's blessed my father your pastor and don't forget that this would have never been possible without sister lesie who's been instrumental in keeping him this [Applause] long well oh let's go ahead and stand my heart will cancel of my heart to [Music] the king is sing it one more time the C of my heart oh from the castle of my heart from the castle of my

that sacrifice that you can look kindly upon us we ask you to do that this morning and be with us in Jesus precious and wonderful and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated for a moment this morning thank you musicians everything's uh wonderful so you know I I usually when you have a birthday you invite people to your birthday party and but I didn't want to leave anybody out so I invited everybody so that's the best way to do it but uh please no presence I I don't need any shirts I uh you know I don't need any uh uh wall plaques or I don't need anything anything so please you know don't uh if you want to do something maybe put some uh something in the offering or or something or the benevolence fund or or something like that but we do we do want to have it a 4:00 we're going to set up some barbecue and um so we'll Supply the meat if you want to bring some sides that's fine just bring some sides and we'll have a few hours of just fellowship and everything and then uh we'll uh just enjoy the rest of our our day together uh so it's it's also uh uh Matthew said it was s it's also Gregory Hills uh birthday today and of course he's uh someplace else doing something else U kind of been distracted in a certain direction but we won't go into any detail but anyway I'm sure she's a lovely girl and uh uh so uh we want to do that you know th this um message came on my heart and I I was looking for another um a message I was looking for or uh a message uh that's uh the way of a true prophet and that came on my heart and I thought you know the way of a true Prophet the way of something is the way it's done the way it goes you you know I mean how that it is and uh we should uh travel in in the way of a prophet but as I went to look for that book I came across this message not once but every time I go through my books there it would be out of order out of place you know here it was in in six uh in 62 and then it's over here and and everywhere I look this message came come up so it came in my heart and the name of the the sermon we're going to play 20 minutes of it this morning is events made clear by prophecy amen events made clear by prophecy and I thought you know isn't that what everybody's wondering today what's going on what's Happening you know the the we know the world's falling apart sir you know it it you hear it over and over again it's crazy out there people are are are are are acting like we've never seen them act before and so all there's all kinds of events going on you know there's wars and rumors are Wars and there's uh pestilence and and it just it it causes you just to come to a place and then here's a beautiful message that says the events are made clear by prophecy amen and and the way that our messenger unfolds this is uh really amazing and and that's kind of what I I don't want us to miss as we're listening and he he he he makes so many references to reading your scriptures reading the scriptures that I think it should stand out to you and what he's trying to tell us to look for look look for what the Bible said would happen look for what the promises are of this day you know and so many times when we think of modern events we think of political events you know what I mean the what are the political events that are taking on uh we look to Israel we look to what's going on but there's a whole another event that taking place and that's in the spiritual realm and and and we don't want to miss that we want to be able to catch uh these great things and and I'll say this with all my heart I don't care how great a man can preach or how anointing it it is and Satan can pure as an angel of Light you cannot navigate The Hour That we live in without the leadership of Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 107 you know that's that is the guide that was sent by the Lord Jesus to guide his church and and we know that we serve one God we don't have him broke up into three pieces we serve one God and that one God has always manifested himself made himself known and he's making himself known in our day and I I hope that you can hear what the prophet says as we listen to it he's making himself known in this day as he makes the events of this day clear by the word of God Amen and I like to just read this one St statement is the brothers if you have uh something that you like to read along with your phone or take notes uh uh he's going to start in the book of uh uh uh in the Book of Luke the 24th chapter and I think the uh 12th verse so that's what we'll be turning to but he makes this statement he says the Bible he says for the Bible is a living foretold witness of Jesus Christ amen a living foretold witness the and he says the Bible is God's word for telling the future events so the bi the Bible is the living is is is a living for told witness of Jesus Christ so it's not something that we look back to you understand it's not something that we look forward to what we want to see is the living witness of Jesus Christ amen so the scripture tells us that he he that he's makes himself known in every age he's wound in to the word of God to reveal himself so in right in the this morning with us sitting here there there's events that are going on right now right here that are a living witness a a a a living witness to Jesus Christ and we're all a part of it amen and so we're a part of we're all a part of the events that are taking place we're all a part of what's being foretold but what we want to do is Lord give us isav that we might see we want to be able to open our hearts our minds our spirits that we can see the living events how that Jesus Christ is manifesting himself in our midst in this day and what it is that we should be looking for what it is that we should be aware of and how it is and what transpires that causes us to miss it and I I'm only going to play 20 minutes of this this morning but I trust that you'll go back uh and maybe finish the message or do a little bit of study in that but you we want the modern events or or or as we would say events made clear by prophecy amen so it's a two-way street right you got to see the event you got to see the prophecy and you got to be able to tie those things together so I trust this is a blessing to you I think it's extremely timely I I thought it was preached earlier in his ministry but really it was preached in August of 1965 and I believe the Lord knew when he was going to take brother brandom from and I believe that the Lord knew what what word that he wanted to store up for this bride and and so every single one of these things has a significance and a time and I I really feel that we've all got to be a part and pray father let me see what the events are that are really happening not the political events not the newspaper events but the spiritual signs of your coming open my eyes to him so let's stand together this morning and we'll make a few comments at at after that we listen to uh this I think it's vital I I you know I believe it I I'm so thankful that so many of you stand with me uh on this of of playing the uh our Messengers uh word in the church and I think it's vital to us amen I I believe with all my heart I I believe that that uh brother renam was the voice of God to this generation and uh he wasn't just a man that God worked through he was a man that God spoke through that's right amen his relationship with God was different God spoke with him lip to ear fact so much in this day was God that was promised to us that the Lord Jesus himself would come back take on a veil in other words a covering and Veil himself hide himself in something that and and do the same works that he did in front of the Jews that he would do in front of the Gentiles he wasn't using the body body of Jesus that came 2,000 years ago but he was using a special prepared body and our messenger made this statement there was no difference between the ministry of Jesus Christ and this ministry except the Corporal body amen amen and that deity veiled in flesh amen amen was brother brandham brother Bram was born in sin that's right shaped into iniquity he came into the world speaking lies he had to be converted he had to repent he had to be filled with the Holy Ghost but there was a special work that was designed and he was designed that God could come and fill him stand in our midst hid in his Corporal body doing and preaching the word to the Gentile Church Hallelujah and I know that's hard for a lot of people to swallow but I can't see it any other way and and and I just hope that you can understand why that I cling so much thank you Lord to this word cuz heaven and earth will pass away but this word will not pass away and I just trust that God would speak to you for a few moments this morning 20 minutes let's listen as soon as he's done uh reading the scriptures we can be seated thank you I want to read a text here found over in the book of St Luke at the 24th uh chapter that I'm going to begin at the 13th verse and read a portion of it and we told two of them went the the same day from the village called emus which was from Jerusalem about three SC score forong and they talked together these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communication are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was Copus answered and said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and how thou not known all these things which have come to pass in these days and he said to them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priest priest and the rulers delivered him to the be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain of the women also of our company made us astonished which were at the supper when they found not his body they came saying that it also seen a vision of angels which said unto them which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sufferer and found it even so as the women had said but he they but him they saw not then he said to them oh fools and slow of heart to believe not believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and entered into his glory and begin at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his words now I take if I call it a subject i' like to take this that events modern events are made clear by prophecy now it's always been God's the unchanging God's uh way to for uh let his people for know before certain events happen if the people in the days of the Lord Jesus would have only sought God and know what was just about to take place they would not have condemned Jesus to death but the reason it was because the scriptures had to be fulfilled because the Jews had to be blind and we all are aware of that do you realize that that's promised again in this very age that we're living the lady of sin Church age this seventh Church age that we're in now is naked miserable blind and don't know it the same as he blinded them back there for the purpose of getting his message through to the elected people he's promised to do the same thing today and if I'd say this to respects to all my brethren and Sisters in Christ one of these days somebody's going to say isn't it written that these things should happen first and it'll be the same way it was and verely I say unto you he's already come and they have did what they listed to him when they asked him said well the scribes say and the scriptures say that that Elias must first come and said that to Jesus he said he's already coming you didn't know him and that's perhaps the way it'll end up again now we want to be psted to know what's to take place for this age that we live in God has lotted his word to to each age so much to each age and we must notice that one age cannot carry over into another age it just won't work for instance as I set up leave last night or constantly speaking night after night places and sometimes I make the remark the second time I don't mean to repeat myself but I say this what would good would it have done Moses to try to preach Noah's message for what good would have been would have done Jesus to try to preach Moses message or what good would have done Martin Luther to continue on with the Catholic message what good would have done Wesley to continue on with the Lutheran message what good would have done Pentecostal to continue on with the Methodist message or what good will it do Pentecost to continue on when the bride's being called we're right up into the seed time we're here at the end time unless a corn of wheat falls to the Earth that abides alone as a Critic as I made remarks that's the book come out probably you got it you're in your your city that German author that wrote one of the most critical articles is the Infidel course not I'm not condemning him because he's condemned me so but because being an Infidel the book should never be on the shelves and he said a God that could set up and say I think we got the tapes mixed up Brothers I'm sorry the one that I want to play is uh I'm sorry everybody is from um it's uh August uh make sure we have it right uh events made clear by prophecy August 1st 1965 is that the one that you're playing okay events made clear by prophecy August 1st 19 1965 and this one was preached in Jeffersonville before we we pray we did did you uh find that one okay let's pick it up from there I'm sorry it doesn't hurt you to hear the same thing over again does it most people you have to tell them three or four times but before they get it but uh uh um so I think this is the this is the message that um that I I want so um Lord bless you let us uh go forward from here you make remain seated want to read some of God's word and I changed my my scriptures a while ago because go ahead and script uh move past the scriptures and pick up right past the scriptures thank you now let us pray dear gracious father we thank thee for Thy word for Thy word is truth Thy word is life and thou oh Lord and thy word are one so we pray tonight Lord that you will come Among Us in the power of your resurrection and will show forth to us tonight like those that came from emus that we too would return to our homes saying did not our hearts burn within us Grant it lord it's towards evening time again for we ask it in Jesus name amen now I want to speak concerning this Bible and my subject tonight for the topic is events made clear by prophecy events made clear by prophecy now the Bible is a different book from all other sacred books the Bible is a different book it is a book of Prophecy foretelling future events and it's also the revelation of Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis to Revelation brings him out in his fullness what he was and is and the whole complete book Revelations 1 1 to3 said the book is a book of the revelation of Jesus Christ which is the word of God the revelation of Jesus Christ the word of God now all other books sacred books is only a code of ethics a code of morals or a code of theology something that how many ever read read the Quran the muhammadan Bible and um and the Book of on Buddhist and so forth it's just a code of ethics what people should live how they should live but it doesn't prophesy doesn't say anything about uh these things or about any special gifts being given to anybody anything to take place just like joining a lodge or something therefore when churches come to the place that they make their church just a lodge to join then they're plump off the word of God for the Bible is a living foretold witness of Jesus Christ and as the Earth has grown into its fullness and also Vines grow into their fullness the day grows into its fullness the Bible was manifested in its fullness in the person of Jesus Christ he was a word of God revealed the whole Complete Book of redemption the Bible is God's word forthtelling the future events its Believers is commanded by its author to read and believe every word of it not just part of it one word to disbelieve it you might as well quit trying until you believe that word every word is absolutely a part of almighty God God made manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is we are commanded as Believers to believe every word of it and it's wrote by the author of God himself there's nobody can add anything to it or take anything from it if you would it would be a freak body of God would have maybe like six fingers on one hand or or three arms or something to add something to take something away from it be one arm short one finger short it's a complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two are one at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me what a complete picture and the True Believers in this word who accept it that way believe it and with patience wait for its prophesied promises every one of them to be manifested in its age every believer has watched for it every believer that's been on the toes watching is the one that's been revealed to now look in the days of the coming of the Lord Jesus why didn't those people recognize John when the Bible plainly said by Isaiah there will be a voice of one cist in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord their last prophet they had which is Malachi 3 said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way why didn't they see it because they was looking upon something that had been done basing their thoughts upon some message that had went forth beforehand and failed to see the present manifestation of God in the day they were living and Christians everywhere that's exactly where the world stands tonight without contradiction that's the truth Christians everywhere are trying to look back to some code of ethics that Mr Luther wrote or Mr Wesley sanki finny Knox Calvin which none of us can speak evil of but that was in a day passed the Pharisees look back to see what Moses said and they said we have Moses we don't know whence thou comest but remember when Moses here they didn't know whence he cometh and now they no wonder Jesus said to them you garnish the tombs of the prophets and you are the one that put them in there after their message is gone a message goes through the people see it they make fun of it the world does and then after the messenger is finished and the message is done then they build an denomination upon the message and there they die right there never come to life again look just a moment to some of you people and especially I speak to you Catholic people do you realize have you ever read the actual history the history of the Roman Catholic Church how it on your martyrology since St Augustine of Hippo how many million innocent people that the church put to death I forget can't call the exact number but it's up in the millions since St hippo of St a Augustine of hip of Hippo Africa made it a declaration that it was absolutely the will of God to put anybody to death that protest the Roman Catholic Church do you realize that in that that St Patrick was never recognized after his death as a Roman Catholic he protested the pope and all of his doings and the Catholic Church itself killed tens of thousands of his children did you know that the Catholic Church burnt Jonah AR that little sainted woman to the state for being said she was a witch 200 years later dug up the bodies of the priest when they found out it was wrong and cast them into the sea without bearing them in the sacred ground to do Penance don't let the day pass over your head and be foolish how that priests would like tonight to come forth that condemn Jesus the only thing they never seen the prediction of that hour if they Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think or other claim that you have eternal life and the scriptures is what tell you who I am for that hour notice the Bible cannot fail it's one thing it cannot do the word of God fail for it foretells its author's acts before he does it now there's one chance out of a thousand that a man might make a prediction uh and something other's going to happen and it would happen but then if he places the where it's going to happen that cuts him down to maybe um One Chance out of 10,000 if he says the day it's going to happen that cuts it down one chance out of about a million and who it's going to happen to that brings it down to billions of chances but this Bible tells you exactly who when where and what to look for and never has failed one time therefore in a little discussion not long ago with a priest of the Sacred Heart Church up here said Mr brandham you're trying to argue a Bible but that's the history of the church I said it's not a history it's God himself in Prince he said God is in his church I said God is in the word in anything contrary to it let it be a lie or he said let my word be true and every man's word a lie he said we're not to argue I said I never ask you to argue but the Bible does say come let us reason together it foretells the author's doings before he does it therefore telling that then that puts every man and woman at the Judgment bar without any excuse if you take what the methodists say about it what the Baptist say about it what the Catholic says what the Pentecostal says or any other Church you might find some disappointments at the Judgment but if you'll just watch what the Bible says is going to happen and when it happens then you'll recognize what happens now it isn't right out in plain view that all people can see it for Jesus thank God for hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and would reveal it to babes such as would learn think of almighty God setting in his own word with power to Blind the rich and imputed and and educated Scholars blind their eyes so they can't see him and Open the Eyes of the poor and literate notice these people from from him he said their their understanding of him was with help they talked to him and didn't even know who it was all day long God can do that or he's God that's exactly what he done to those priests those scribes because it was written that he had to do that God blinded their eyes so we'd have a chance notice they couldn't see no matter how much scy how much priest they was what they had done they still could not see it because they were blind their sight might been 2020 physically but their spiritual sight the same thing I was trying to say this morning about the adultery of women dressing the way they do now they are adulterers and God's book there are guilty of adultery every time they put on sexy looking clothes their soul not knowing it I believe them women many of them thousands of them are innocent and would by no means commit adultery and the poor women with somebody who will let him get by with it without exposing it and tell the truth commit adultery which the Bible said the that set up on many Waters that all the kings of the earth and the peoples of the Earth the churches and so forth committed spiritual fornications with him her and she was a mother of harlot's denominations we watch the Bible for God doesn't leave us in darkness he sent the Bible to foretell us the events before they happen in the very nature and time they would come now it's something like uh uh looking on a calendar to see what date it is if you think say this is this Saturday Sunday what is it look on the calendar the calendar will tell you what day it is when you see the actions of the people maybe going to church you see the the hear the bells ringing you wonder what day it is look on the calendar it'll tell you what day it is and when you see the church getting whirly like it was the days of Sodom see the church world all going into the worship the God of this evil age and seeing that then seeing a little minority group gathered out under the inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in this Bible foretells by prophecy what day that we're living and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells it exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time time not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see it will see it Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father has given me will come it's a word jaring with the word it can't do nothing else we know the day that we're living in but as it has been in every age people let man put their own interpret ation to this word and causes them to be blinded to the event that's happened same thing it done with the Pharisees and Sadducees even when Paul stood there and tried to quote the scripture and one man smoted him in the face because he called the high priest of whiteed wall and then they miss seeing God confirm his prophesied word see the Bible doesn't contradict itself the Bible is God there's no contradiction in God he's perfect but the people with their own interpretation now notice let me show you friends the churches cannot agree them themselves on the interpretation of it the Methodist can't agree with the Baptist the Baptist the Presbyterian the Presbyterian the Pentecostals and with about 40 different organizations of Pentecost they can't agree with one of another so you see that would be babbling again confusing but God does his own interpretating of his word he promises thing and then does it himself he gives himself the interpretation of it because He makes himself known in that hour how far the the body of Christ is advance from the feet to the Head notice then that's the reason that these people fail to get it because they listen to what somebody else says about it instead of reading the word like Jesus told them to do and they are they that testify of me search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me in other words listen what read the scriptures and see what the Messiah was supposed to do see what time the Messiah was supposed to come look who was going to forun the Messiah look at the hour there's to be a voice of one crying in the wilderness John and you're done Tony exactly what you listed look what I was supposed to do when I come and now what have you done have I failed to meet this see Jesus speaking have I failed to meet this Lord say we come on down through the scriptures this afternoon how that everything that was prophesied of him happened just exactly way it supposed they should have know this event this fanatic young fellow raised up about 33 years old and or 30 years old and went down there and claimed all kinds of lights and doves ascending and why was this a a disgrace they said he was born with illegitimate parents claimed he was born of a virgin birth ought they not to know that Isaiah said in Isaiah 9:6 unto us a child is born ought not they to know also that the prophet Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive they ought to have know these things but you see the thing of it was they were applying it somewhere way ahead and this man to them didn't meet the specification but he asked them search the scriptures for you thinking then that you have eternal life and they are the very thing that's testifying to my message not what some theologians said but what God his own word said would take place amen so is it now search the scriptures where they are the one that tells us the hour we're living in tells us exactly what will take place in this day they are the ones that you should rely upon for they are the one that testifies of the person of Jesus Christ for the Bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever because he's a revelation of the word in the age can't be no different therefore by listening to man's interpretation they see the confirmation of God's word fulfilled they fail to see it because it's going on all the time but because they listen and Jesus said they're blind leaders and if the blind leads a blind what happens to him I remember the Bible predicted this ecclesiastical age of this lady ofan age was blind they had him outside the church there's not another age another church age that Jesus is on the outside but the lady Sea church age he was on the outside trying to get back in a stand at the door and knock you're supposed to be inside but he said because you say I'm rich increased in Goods have need of nothing and don't know don't know that you're blind leading the blind poor in spirit wred miserable naked and don't know it what a if a man was naked on the street miserable blind and you had sense enough that you could tell him he was naked to try to do something about it but when he shakes his head I want to have it who are you to tell me what to do I know where I'm standing now if that in't a pitiful shape I don't know and that's exactly what the God of this Bible said that the church would be in in this evil age right now in the last Church age where we're living notice but to the peoples as many as I love I rebuke now if you're rebuked to the Lord of what you're doing come out of it then get away from it as many as I love I rebuke now seeing God now what if those Pharisees would said wait a minute that man's give us quite a challenge he said search the scriptures or in them you think you have eternal life they testify me it's better that I look back in the scriptures and find out what he's supposed to do who he is what's supposed to take place I should look back and find out instead of that they went to the priest and asked him what about it see the difference they should have been reading the word in Hebrews 1:1 the Bible said God in sunra times that's old times and in diverse manners wrote the Bible by the prophets now notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way see now he didn't have to write that way neither did he have to save Man by Blood he didn't have to preach the gospel by man he could let the sun of the moon or the Stars preach the gospel he could let the winds hum the gospel but he chose man and he chose the way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time for the word of God came to the prophets only never does it come to a theologian show me the Scripture it comes only to prophets God cannot line so God wrote the Bible by his chosen method and his own chosen prophets not the prophets man had chose but the prophets God had chose then it's Believers watch far the Fulfillment of what their prophets said and that's identification that they are God's prophets because first they're inspired next they say exactly with the word word of the hour then that's is credentials see we went through that last Sunday many false prophets will rise and we give the illustrations how that balam and Moses both of them Anointed with the same Spirit one of them said we're all one let's come Jo put our girls and all together we got pretty girls over here you boys come over here and take your ni wife it's all right we're all one people in out the same race God never did forgive them for they listen to that see the world and the the people are watching for some little Outlet some little bass some little shortcut but there is no shortcuts in the word of God there's one pattern you must cut yourself and fit that pattern not try to cut the pattern to fit you everybody must do that that's the only way God has the doing it notice now the Believers wait for that word to be confirmed see it was not wrote by man but by the Lord God therefore it's not a book of man somebody says this some old Hebrew writings would the Hebrews write a letter that condemn themselves with that fine nation of Jews self sty and Polished would they write their own iniquities condemning them own selves certainly not tell of his own sins how they went into idolatry how they committed fornications against God's word no no they never tell that that proud Nation it's not a book of man it's a book of God and the man who sees the Visions or hears the voice of God never understood it many times themselves in many cases see man didn't write the Bible God wrote the Bible it is not it's not a man's book it's God's book it is God's thoughts expressed through human lips that's what makes it the Bible a thought expressed is a word and in the beginning was God's thinking he expressed it through the lips of His prophets and confirmed it by his servants notice God does his own choosing by predestination chose the prophets forever age Noti he fixes the nature of that Prophet to fit that age see he fits style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or Not educated he fits the gifts the manner that he'll preach in the gifts he'll have and the message for that certain age God's predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place care what it is how many man-made achievements nothing can take its place he predestinated the man may be an ignorant man he might have predestinated another kind of a man whatever he is he gives him his class his his gift give him his nature his style and whatever it is how he expresses himself and whatever he does he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour he does it at the end of each age when the church has turned to the world in sin and leaning upon man's interpretation of the word as ever they always at the End of the Age have gotten such a Mess by their theologians and Priests until it's always a mess up always their interpretation is wrong not one time has it ever failed to be wrong and not one time has God's word ever failed to be right that's the difference now see God wrote the Bible himself now God can speak Moses said he spoke to him Jeremiah said he put words in my out and God can write he wrote the Ten Commandments with his own finger he wrote on the walls of Babylon and remembered of the Old Testament loone 2,000 times the prophet said thus sayith the Lord God can speak God can write certainly almost 90% of Matthew Mark Luke and John is the very words of God himself Jesus Christ speaking so if God can write if God can read if God can talk can he cause others to do the same did not he say to Moses who makes man dumb or who gives him speech God wrote the Bible by the prophets his way of doing it now every time that the church gets mixed up and God forew they would for he forew all things therefore he has a certain Prophet ready for that age to call his electon by his edicated word of signs and wonders and confirmation of his word confirming the word with signs following as he promised he gives the true interpretation after the prophet himself has been Vindicated we could go through that line by line I mean I I I there's so much in there but I'm not going to uh take very much more of your time uh just uh it's marvelous amen but you notice the admonition that he tells us he says don't miss it don't don't don't fall into the Trap of looking back you understand there's things that are transpiring right now that are prophesied events of God that you can see thank you Lord and but you're counsell right to buy eyesa that you might see you're counseled to say Lord open my eyes let me see let me read the scriptures how many times did he refer read the scriptures go look at the scriptures look what the scripture said you know before the great and Dreadful day I'll send you Elijah the prophet as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be in the uh coming and the revealing of the son of man look at the events he vindicates it and then shows you the events that are are supposed to take place and and so now we come down to if I could say this this morning just the few minutes that I want to spend where am I in this picture in other words what was propes Side of Me Okay I I I I see that I see the age I see the hour I see Sodom and gomorah I see the world falling apart you do you know how many know that everybody that's around we're in a great election season and it's 5050 that's what they say I don't know you know I only know one that knows and whoever he wants in is going to be in that's and it's not for our better it's for our destruction so I don't care if you think Donald Trump will destroy the world cricker vote for him if you think KLA Harris will destroy the world cricker vote for her I don't care but the event is no Kingdom divided against itself can stand that's what you got to be able to look at you're not picking sides here what's going on why are we going in two directions why are we so divided what happened how did this get on this country how did America get in this shape we know how she got in this shape she rejected God we were told they were going to reject God we were told they were actually written in the messages that we look to that there would come come a time they wouldn't know the difference between a man and a woman and now they can't even answer that question I mean it's don't the events because it's the living foretold word of God he he the prophet of God said he acts on it before he speaks it it's all it's it's all these things are coming to pass all these events that we see around this have already been made clear by prophecy in other words they have there's a reason behind every single bit of it amen that's right think of it so you you you might just be living in the second but he he he made the statement he says that that it keeps moving on it keeps growing now so I could go through a whole list if I could say that of all the all the uh negative things that are going on with the Sodom gamorra condition with the hatred that people have and and how how that uh there's a hatred for the word of God in our country now there's a hatred for churches there's a hatred uh uh uh there's a whole people that they don't believe in God they don't believe that our government should have anything to do with supporting churches helping churches giving churches any benefits or anything they they think that's uh ludicrous uh that that groups and buildings like this should should be not have to pay taxes and that's the way they feel they feel that's not right well the reason our government did that because churches kept crime off the street they taught morals to kids they they were beneficial to society right now you've got people that don't think churches are beneficial to society why because they speak out against sex changes uh in your kids without you knowing it they're they're the even though they're political but yet they're they're trying to hang on to some sort of voice right some sort of that thing trying to hold who try to stand up and say yeah there's a difference between men and women look at the things are fighting over should a boy be on a girl's team now that ought to strike you spiritually because the Bible says because they wish not to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind you sit back and say how can they think this way what's wrong with those people I can't even imagine they're doing this wait a minute that event is made clear by prophecy those actions are made clear by prophecy that thinking that philosophy that those actions it's made clear by prophecy yes sir we should see the events we should we should we we should see what's happening around us and then because it's the Living Word of God be because it's uh it's it's the Bible is a living foretold witness a living witness then I have to look at myself and say what what am I manifesting what is my portion and my part in this living prophecy now we want we're not talking about a natural sight the political scene the the other scene we're we're talking about spiritual eyesight and so again I want to just take one second here and then we have a baptism uh EJ is going to get baptized so we'll have a a baptism I've called him EJ so long I I think I forgot his real name right but there's another wonderful thing taking place and I want to to spend about five maybe 10 minutes on this I see the world falling apart does anybody see it falling apart I mean people talk about saving America America's gone our messenger told us it would be gone we told us it would be in a Sodom condition right total as it was in the days of Noah giving into marriage and marri marriage and divorce and not even being married all those things are evident to those that have spiritual Isa all these events are made clear by prophecy but what's prophesied about me okay if I'm a part of it it's living that and and the events are made clear by the word of God then I want to say this way I want to be made clear you understand make me clear Lord Place me position me give me Revelation to see what am I in this hour you can be lukewarm but he said I would that you be either hot or cold but if you're lukewarm I want to spill thee out of my mouth so I want to sit back wait a minute am I lukew it are my actions and my thinking speaking of an event that was prophesied to be here is my attitude towards the word my life my My Lifestyle the things that I I I I in cumber myself with are these evidences of a prophesied word they worship me with their lips but their their hearts are far from me where do where where do I stand good what what what is spoken of me what events in my life are being made clear by prophecy now you can't get away from it that's right you understand it's spoken well God said let he said he when he said let there be light there was light and God's word calls for in other words God's word prophesies of a total separation from unbelief Hallelujah God prophesies that there will be a people that believes every word of God now we just listen to this little spot and I just will read this he says when you see SE the church getting worldly now that's an event that's made clear by prophecy churches getting worldly I went to a meeting with pastors uh with the police chief and and and different things so we went there and met the police chief and and there were some uh women pastors there and uh uh and you know the things that they were concerned about and the things that they were talking about you know that that's great great social living you know uh uh they reach out to to the uh I don't know what communities they call them LBP XYZ everybody's got an initial you you know what I mean I'd rather we had the Holy Ghost but but this is what he says when you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of Sodom to you see the church world all going into the into the worship the God of this evil age and see that he says then seen now look at there's another event the one event is the world becoming like Sodom the world going into all these things that they're going into the but there's another event that's prophesied there's something else that's that is going to be made clear you understand because he can't leave these prophecies unclear he's he's got he's got to clarify it not only does he have to clarify it he has to identify it for what that it is so it's unmistakable he predestines and we heard that of people to be there he said he says and seeing that and seeing that right and seen that this is Sodom this is where we are how many sees that amen how many SE there's a complete change in the last five or six 10 years in this country that is absolutely moving so fast but it's been prophesied you say how has it been prophesied if the days wouldn't be shortened no flesh would be saved these these things aren't gradually working in now they're moving faster than you canbat and I you know all of a sudden Wham just like that the some people got into some power and decided that they're going to change how people were made God made them male and female that's right now they're going to change that sir you you see how insane that is yes sir that men think that they can do some sort of surgery and change something the way God made it they don't make it or change it they just pervert it but when we see that that's Sodom but when we see the church we're all going into the worship of the God of this evil age so they've all gone into worshiping the God of this evil age knowledge science education politics they're all worshiping it Y when you see that if you see that event made clear then there ought to be another event that we see that's being made clear because we're called out we're told to be separate now this is beautiful he says then seeing now I'm asking you are you seeing this is this clear to you have you recognize this taking place yes sir in your life cuz we we want you to see this we want to understand this and seeing that then seeing a little minority group Gathering out under the inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ Christ by the scriptures that's supposed to happen you know what hour you're living in praise God there's a Min minority group of people that have heard the word of God that are LED out under the the inspiration of God could I say what's the inspiration of God it's by the revelation of God's word there's a people that is being led out do you feel yourself being led out of this this uh Sodom do you feel yourself being led out of the world you're being inspired away from it to manifest Jesus Christ Christ Hallelujah that's an event that's an event that's living where is the event the foretold living prophecy we see the foretold living prophecy in all the events that are taking and gathering around us where do I see this foretold living prophecy of a minority group Gathering out under the inspiration of God producing again the life of Jesus Christ where do you see it you better see it right here you better say this is an event that I have to join myself to this is an event that I have to be aware of that there's an inspiration that's separating me from all these things that are taking place and this prophecy is being made clear in me oh now you're wound in the word of God you're wound into the word of God so all these other events We Major so much time on all the corruption and all the falling away but we don't think in the midst of all that corruption and falling away there's a people that are making clear the living Jesus Christ than you Lord Oh I like that don't you he says and you know what hour you're living the Bible for tells by prophecy what day that we're living and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place it foretells it exactly to the letter and has never missed one age all the time not one time has it ever missed and it won't won't for who for it won't for who are predestinated to see it will see it Lord Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father hath given me will come it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else we know that day that we're living in and so we we we want to see this event made clear so what I want you to understand is you're not in a struggle you're actually part of a prophesied event Hallelujah why did I come out of my denomination why did I come out of my Church how did I get here how did I come across this message why why was I brought under conviction why it wasn't an accident it was foretold the Bible is a foretold event it was foretold that you'd be listening to the radio and somebody would mention the name of William Brandon it would strike you you would would run over you'd start listening to his books and listening to his tapes and read the book and all a sudden go whoa that was prophesied of you you're that event unfolding and manifesting the bride in this last day is prophesied and if it's prophesied has got to be made clear how could he make the other events clear without making the prophecy clear Every Nation every tongue every Kindred we may not be a lot of things that other churches are but that's one thing we got we got every tongue every nation and every Kindred type there is why why they come from the East and West they come from the lands afar why cuz it's an event a prophecy that's got to be made clear they'll love one another they'll know you are my disciples by your love for another it's it's an event but see if we don't have have spiritual eyes we're actually always looking outside of what's really happening right in here the transformation of you to little Messiahs and little Messiahs does God have to fulfill that it's been prophesied he's got to make it clear praise God I'm not going to put myself on the other side it's prophesied they'll be Overcomers there's things I have to overcome but is given to the Overcomer to sit with him on his throne what's the church going to be made out of people from the highways and the byways and people with problems and weaknesses in all things because his strength is made perfect in weakness oh it I I just hope your heart can be so stirred up that you could put your spiritual eyes and see there's a modern event of the calling out of the Bride of the manifestation of Jesus Christ in a minority group father and and I I feel I'm part of that being made clear that explains me it explains why I'm the way I am it explains me why I feel the way I feel it defines me oh that that's such a joy it's such a peace not from the standpoint of condemnation sure I got all this worldly baggage but the prophecy is that I'll come out the prophecy is I'll overcome the prophecy that I'll have Isa to see the prophecy is I'll have white rain it the prophecy is that I'll be have gold tried in fire that's what's prophesied that's what's taking place in me we don't want a denomination and Creed it it's living Living Word unfolding Living Word and he goes on to say and he goes on and talks about interpretation and God that man puts his interpretation we know that he says but this he says but God does his own interpreting of his word so the first thing is it's not going to be intellectual God interp pets his word by bringing it to pass so it's not something that's intellectual it's not a philosophy it's actually events things that are taking place it is not psychology and philosophy where people are trying to rearrange your thinking this is something that is prophesied that now is manifesting in flesh it's taking on form it's in human flesh he that doesn't believe that the word is made flesh is Antichrist amen and there is anti word right that this is not going to remain an Ethics or a a mind choice but this is a word that was prophecy that's Al absolutely going to take physical form and be alive right [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord and you got say that's me well I got a long ways to go yeah but you got a great big God hallelujah he's able to bring to pass what he he said Thank You Lord but I I see it amen then I can now I'm saying make that clear make it come to pass in me because along with everything else bad that's going on there is an elect lady a group of people that God is going to live in and he'll provide the Grace the strength the mercy the spirit the word the instruction to hover over her until she comes into that fullness and he will not lose the one so don't get discouraged there's many a time in my life I F finally thought I had everything pretty good shape and then he'll just show me some other flaw in me and I thought oh my goodness no Lord surely I'm not that way surely I haven't said that surely I haven't done that and all of a sudden he draws a whole new painting of a lot of the things that I had done said and thought well I'm not going to say I just give up you know what I do I go to working on them I go without overcoming them you know here I go again Lord I've always had two feet in my mouth and I've done it again I've done it again I they they misunderstood me again you know when is my you know what I might not be what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be either I know the prophecy is being fulfilled I know it is I no matter what's in my past no what my failures are no matter what my failures have caused that is no reason and may I say it like this unbelief doesn't stop stop God not their unbelief my unbelief hasn't stopped God and that's why he said Lord help my unbelief he said Do You Love Me Lord you love you love me yes Lord you love me when he said it the third time Peter finally said it this way Lord you know all things you know I love you I know I denied you I know I did all these things but you you know that I love you you know what Lord he put that to rest in Peter that's right that it could never come back and haunt Peter again beautiful they got it taken care of and if you ever take care of something with God you leave it there and let's close on this remark God does his own interpreting of his word he promised the thing and then does it him he promised a bride he's going to do it himself he gives himself the interpretation of it because He makes himself known in that hour Now list this statement came to my heart how far the body of Christ is Advanced from the feet to the Head what is one of the prophecies in our day is the advancement of the body of Christ what prophesied for each of us is the advancement of Our Lives lives in Christ and and when he first opened when he first began this to speak right right in the first thing he said for the Bible is the living fortold witness of Jesus Christ as the Earth has growed into its fullness and also Vines grow into their fullness the day grows in to its fullness it grows into its fullness praise God what are we doing we're growing we're we're we're we're we're fulfilling we're a part of an event that's taking place right now the calling out of the Bride the growing of that bride and the transforming of the seed that God put in you into the purpose that it was called for praise God can we judge one another I say no are we perfect in our own eyes no but in his eyes we never did it in the first place why because he spoke it that's right and now it's word meeing word and and all I can say church is that yeah we're living in a terrible miserable atmosphere on hour but he that is in you is greater than he who is in the world and though you can list all your failures we had just heard that what God prophesies will never fail and if he prophesied a bride called from the Far Corners of the earth called from the highways and byways called from every failure in life and that he would perfect it cuz he said he whose start the work will finish it hallelujah thank you Lord I hope that you can look and say that event that prophecy is being made clear in me I'm in his hands sometimes he takes the vessel and tears it down and rebuilds it but he's the Potter and I'm the clay and he knows what he's doing not my will but thy will be done so I want to encourage you this morning don't get all discouraged about the darkness that's surrounding you but be encouraged about the light that's growing in you amen and and look at yourself I I'll guarantee you you wouldn't be here this morning if that wasn't your heart's desire amen thank you and we could look around this room and how many of us have been serving God for so many years some a lot of years some a few years but you find me the man that has finally come to the place that he no longer feels he needs to grow and Christ he no longer feels that he needs to grow in Perfection and be more loving be more merciful be more kind do more works you find me a man that doesn't have that Burning Heart and I'll show you a spiritual corpse you know where we want to come to we want to come to the place that we're so Christlike like that we could change bodies and our lives would go on just the same that I I could actually switch into Billy and Billy could show up and still be me because I'd be acting the same way saying the same thing believing the same way being led by The Same Spirit then it would have nothing to do with the outside it would be the inside and all of a sudden Billy shows up to court for me pay my ticket and the judge says well you you don't look like David M but you sound like them you act like them you think like them and then Billy say your honor it's it's not me that speaketh but it's Christ in me that speaketh that Jud would look at him and say what's going on here how does this happen because it's the same Spirit the same mind we're possessed by the same same thing we're all part of the same prophetic event that's unfolding of the calling out and manifestation of the Bride of Jesus Christ God bless you brother EJ if you get ready to come be baptized and Bill Le if you have to go that's fine uh anyway you come back and we'll try to have uh our our food at least out ready by 4:30 qu to 5: so don't go eat too much or if you do go and eat a whole lot it's okay there'll be more barbecue for for the rest of us and and so uh we just trust that the Lord will be with us and if you're going to hang around the church it's fine if you maybe go into the room if you want to to wait between things but try not to get in the way of those that are trying to prep and work or I don't know if any of you have sides that you're going to go get but we have barbecu beef barbecued turkey and sausage so whatever if you want to bring aide fine if you don't want to bring aide fine then then just take a little bit of meat don't fill up your side with barbecue am I making that make sense you understand what I mean right you're all smart intelligent people wait a minute the scripture said you're unlearned men filled

there's blessings that come with the birthright so let's turn in our Bibles and it says from the book of Acts it says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children to all them that are far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this upt generation amen amen EJ the church was given a commission by the Lord Jesus Christ to go into all the world and baptizing in them in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost not the name of the Father the name of the son the name of the Holy Ghost but the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost amen and by Divine Revelation on the day of Pentecost Peter knew that that name was a name given above all other names the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and EJ according to the scriptures and the Bible and God's promise that you receive the Holy Ghost we baptize you in the name of the Lord [Applause] Jesus breakfast come
