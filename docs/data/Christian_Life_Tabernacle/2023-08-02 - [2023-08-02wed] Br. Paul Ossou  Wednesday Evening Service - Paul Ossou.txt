preacher after every verse his life feels and shambles surrounded by his curse and sing No Way Out he knows now what to do but keep on hurting so he sits there hurting but he is free he just don't

cross has spoken he forgiven even when we're certain God's grace is all we've got even when we tell ourselves it isn't up to us sometimes it's hard to trust that he says we could come like little children for we are his children and we are free but do we know it we are loved but can we feel it for there's more mercy here than we could ever we are healed but do we see it we are home but can't we believe it and for the past is broken the cross has spoken of forgiving God opened up his word and showed our name is in his book by faith and revelation we finally have a look that the grace of

bless us tonight [Music] don't forget Brother David the pastor of this church who's giving us an opportunity to speak tonight fill him with your grace and the goodness [Music] [Music] that all together we may be in your presence that you may use as For Your Glory bless your name tonight as we give the service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen as we're still standing all right let's take our Bibles in the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 16. moving [Music] we'll read verse 13 through 18. yeah it's a scripture very familiar scripture reading I will try to read and directly in English when Jesus came into the cost of cesari Philippi he asking interesting for saying whom do men say that I the son of man harm and they say some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah are one of the prophets he said unto them but to whom say that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art requires the son of the Living God and Jesus asked me and said unto him please add out some bad Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I think also unto thee that there are Peter and happened to the work I will breed my church and the gates of it shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the key of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever you thou should bind on the earth I shall Bound in heaven and whatever thou shall lose on Earth I shall be lost in heaven let's turn over to Second Timothy chapter three notation the second Timothy chapter three first starting from verse one do you know also that in the last days very last time should come for me shall be lovers of their own self cover truth booster power proud females disobedient to parents and thankful and holy without natural affection truth Breakers first accuses incontinent faith that spices and those that are good three two Edmonds love is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of goodness but denied the power you know such turn away Lord Jesus we read your word may you help us find a context to say something from you that would help us bless your name tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I believe we are happy to be in the house of God tonight it's always a privilege to be in the house of God [Music] because he promised that when We Gather in his name that is always there and when he's there he cannot let us go back the same way we came in because he said his word is like rain that it wouldn't fall and go back without giving forth blessings and I believe every time we come in the house of God he's there to give us something tonight the Lord is placed on my heart a little subjects what makes the strength of a believer [Music] la vie we because we know the life is a battle and said when we become Christians we enter into a battle and we have to be fortified we have to have something that makes our strength to continue to fight so we could go forth the Bible is describing the time that we are living in it said that in the end time the men will become cruel and now we see that today the cruelty of man has really been lifted up and someone could be uh someone you could see someone being killed instead of people helping it and there will be those standing there with the taking pictures so they can send it out people have lost the loyalty foreign criticizing okay they love the pleasure more than God and as we read in this scripture the Bible is not specifically just describing the unbeliever because in this scripture the Bible is describing all of it all the people in the end times it means there are people that look like Christians they have the appearance of Christians they go to church they they worship God they invoke or they call upon the name of the Lord the scripture says having the form of godliness by denying the very power thereofs it seems like it has to be something that constitutes the strength that these people whether they that are called themselves Christians [Music] even though they have the form of godliness they deny what makes the strength of a Believer they deny what makes a Christian and that is what they completely describe the time under which we are living the ages the church ages the last Sage is the age of laodicea so on one side we have people they they have no loyalty they are criminals they are untenable they are not religious condition they have the appearance of Holiness but they deny what makes the strength says in a crisis revealing his own word paragraph 159. he says in the age of laodicea the people were [Music] if a blindly the blind don't they all fall into a ditch naked blind and don't know it is [Music] even the mental uh uh faculties are gone the spiritual faculties of mental spiritual understanding high-minded a mother please could you lovers of pleasure more than a lot more than love of God uh truce Breakers false accusers having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof the power of Revelation strength the people have denied the power of Revelation they don't even believe in it forever see the prophet they don't believe in such thing as a prophet and it says they don't [Music] they don't believe in it they believe that malachite 4 is a certain church or a certain organization I read this I thought about someone with whom I was talking with uh uh last week I was talking to a couple I was presenting to them the message of William Branham to showing them that the Bible has shown a saying that in the end time in this time that's the only way to escape through the fire that's going to burn the Earth is to receive Elijah the prophet because he said behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet is they look to be to have been convinced and a week later he came to see me he said he came back from his church I I asked him did you already find your Elijah it says oh we talked about it at church they told us that the Bible says that Elijah was a man of same nature as us so that means we don't have to wait for another Elijah because he was of the same nature so we are like Elijah and that's what brother Branham said he says they believe that malachite is a certain church or a certain organization when he came the first time he was a man when he came the second time with a double portion he was a man when he came in the form of John the Baptist he was a man you see in the last days when the evening time began to shine eyes will open and you will see where you are going [Music] then the body is already formed standing up taking motion moving move by the Holy by your Holy Spirit they're saying one that moved upon the prophet that wrote the Bible [Music] the same holy ghost moving in a body filled with the Holy Ghost in the Holy Ghost out of every organization every Kindred tongue and people to access the revelation that's what Jesus did with Peter God when he asked him what do whatever I am perfect everyone can answer according to what everybody has said all they say that you are Jeremiah or that you are one of the prophets that you are there sometimes we come to church we have the revelation of the pastor we have the revelation of our husbands the revelation of our wife but when you have talked about the revelation of the others Jesus will turn to you as he turned towards the disciples he said that is what others says of me that's what the pastor said about me but you why do you say that I am what do you say that I am because Jesus was looking for a personal revelation [Music] we saw that as the sons of cephas they went out they wanted to cast out devils in the name of the Jesus that uh Paul was preaching but what did the demon said unto them I know Paul I know Jesus but you who are you as long as they didn't have their own personal revelation the revelation of who Jesus was personally that if we want to have strength we have to read the word we have to pray but when we read the word it's the simple lecture of the Bible will that give us our revelation will I give us the strength when we pray if we don't know to whom we are dressing too if we don't have the personal revelation of who we are talking to how can we have the strength extracted from a personal revelation it means when we come to church [Music] the gift to try to connect you with Christ the pastor is not trying to connect you to the church he's not trying to connect you to his own church but he's trying to connect you to Christ so that each one will have a personal revelation so each one will have a personal contact with Christ when we have the personal revelation that we will understand that regardless of whether we're in the valley that will be on the Mountaintop same God who reveal himself to you will remain faithful the greatest power that ever was in the world [Music] and to take him and put him behind a little ship behind in in the wilderness sheeps [Music] he took him from the throne to take him in the wilderness the same God we got whether be in the valley could be on the Mountaintop he Remains the Same God [Music] regardless of the difficulties regardless of the problems regardless of of failures he Remains the Same God and you will know that the same way Moses that he took him in the world and asked for 40 years at the point where he forgotten how to talk because all his time was with the the ship behind the Sheep boys Moses the the the Commandment of Egypt he became a sheep for 40 years but God didn't forget him because he had a mission for him [Music] that he had a mission for his people sometimes the problem God reveals us something we want to go before God we want to go before the time of God that's what happens with Moses but God is never late we just have to have a personal revelation of who that God is what is he able to do Liberty look German God showed Joseph that there were 11 Stars the Moon and Sun that he was worshiping he showed Joseph death that there was a um historically strong strong okay that they were a straw that was worshiping his in other words God showed Joseph that it was to be a chief killed that he had he had to be blessed in the ditch and you'll find yourself in in a in a prison of fortified God didn't show him him that who is today not difficult our difficulties today our problems today if we only know who our God is we are even not gonna let that bother us because we know who our God is that is able to take us where he wants us to be what is predestinated for us no one can stop it food I mean if it decided that Moses will spend the rest of his life behind the the sheep for Moses it was still a blessing it's the best place that God could find for Moses the only problem we have to have the revelation of what God is saying foreign Jesus had 12 disciples when we read in the Book of John we know that there were other disciples didn't have a revelation of Jesus or who Jesus was but they were all Apostles they they cast out Devils they did great things but when Jesus started saying you know where I go you know the way I am in the father and the father is in me Philip looks at him and says oh I I don't understand that he didn't have the revelation of that he said then show us apostle Thomas Jesus said everything before he can go foreign to whom Jesus was talking to but when he is Resurrected he said I want to touch no so it's not um because we have a power because we do demonstrations that really we have the revelation of who Jesus is because [Music] sometimes when difficulties arises regardless of all the power we have we really show who we really are but what God wants that we have the true Revelation personal ity that's what each one of us has to look for personal revelation of Christ and a question and answer of uh uh 54 May 50 May 15 1954. he says paragraph 237 the church was built upon divine revelation of God philosopher flesh and blood does not revealed this to you Peter but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this unto you and Upon This Rock spiritual revelation of the word of God I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it it's about the church it's not this building it's not this Gathering but it's each and every one of us and the word says that we have to be built upon the spiritual revelation of the word of God and it's only when we are built upon that Revelation that even the the Gates of Hell remember even Satan himself cannot do anything against you when they go on the need to pray even Satan trembles when the weakest Christian considering yourself the weakest of all this tonight if you have the personal revelation of who Christ says if you are built upon it got you to imagine when you go on your knees put in your head that you are causing Satan to tremble that you are causing the enemy to tremble when you cause the enemy to tremble then what's going to bother you what's going to bother you it means you are you have the strength you have the power he says it is that's where I say [Music] [Music] [Music] don't make a bit of difference when the Church of God moves on in the power of inspiration she will move right on and on and on and on and on and no denomination stop said right nothing in the world will stop it says nothing in the world will stop it my sister when you have the revelation of who Christ is nothing in the world will stop you not even sickness nothing in the world will stop you it says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it spiritual Revelations spiritual truth revealed and we know that spiritual truth reveal is the message that God has sent us [Music] outside of it Satan is mocking people regardless of demonstration he says now watch now the next because he had he had the spiritual revealed truth don't kill us that's the reason he knowed the difference between Father Son and Holy Ghost why because he received the spiritual revelation there are those that pray in the name of Jesus but they don't even know who that Jesus is what is that Jesus doing in this moment we pray and pray and just today that's wonderful but it's a testimony for us but today where is that Jesus what is he doing in your life he says that's that's the reason he know the difference between Father Son and Holy Ghost and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] he had a spiritual revelation that's what you are understanding tonight where the Holy Ghost is opening it up to us when we have that revelation we are stable look at job was it had a terrible trial a just man it was a perfect man he was doing what God asked him to do and one day the Bible says that Satan went to see God asked him where do you come from they said well I went to and for the Earth and achieved myself and he asked him did you see my servant job he loves you because you blessed him let me touch let me touch a little bit of what he has and you'll see one day job lost all is good he lost all his children he said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord but regardless of that when you go read the book of job that job cursed the day that he was born that he was to be born a boy because of the trial job was there Satan went and he came in there he hit him again with ulcers but with both he had then it was there he was there sitting on the Airship and scratching himself and there were the visitors coming and there were those that were accusing him he was there sad and he began to look at nature oh he says the trees they have hope and in the winter they die and then in the springtime they come back alive but the man where does he go he was thinking but when the Revelation came when Revelation hit him job didn't worry anymore the job didn't ask any more questions before he said I was going to go knock at his door because you're driving but when a god came and revealed himself to him there were no more questions he said I know he didn't say I think he didn't say I suppose he said I know about my redeemer liveth that even live for worms they eat up my flesh my eyes shall see God can't get you there it was no more inquiring why because he had the personal revelation of that God who he was and what was he able to do the healing and even if he was not gonna heal him he knew that that God was able to resurrect him because he received a revelation of who that God was he gave he gave him strength no doubt he threw away the things that he had he stood up on the Airship or where he was thinking he says oh if it was possible that my word may be engraved on the stones but I know my redeemer liveth Joseph I know he liveth not the same job anymore why it was fortified by the revelation of who Jesus Christ was this Revelation says it's like oil it gives stimulation he says in the fourth seal paragraph 57. it says come real now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find that that oil and the wine connected in worship see always connected in worship foreign I said which came to me the wine symbolized symbolized that it was the power simulation it was the power of stimulation by revelation I wanted to see how job was rejoicing that day he said they said it was the power of stimulation by Revelation that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by Revelation see it's something that God said has said it's a mystery and it can't understand it and after a while God comes down and reveals it and then it Vindicated paragraph 62 he says and when God tells you anything and says go do this and I'll be right with you for it's my word [Music] and it shows in the in the Bible [Music] then God stands right behind that if God reveals to you and he says go do something and he stands right behind it he said God will be behind it to show it and if it's not written in the Bible but God told you God stands behind it sister if it's the word and then if it's outside of that it's revealed to the prophets we realize that all the mysteries of God is made known to the prop to prophets them them and them alone see Amos 3 7. they said now the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the Believers for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate see to bring a person that's that's that's all slumped down coffee shop like job he was all slumped down but the power of Revelation is stimulated him it's the power that stimulates someone who's all bitten down or slumped down if you are slapped down tonight get access to revelation God will give you stimulation it says see well then [Music] give stimulation of Joy to the Believers simulation of satisfaction whether it be good or bad the believer is satisfied the stimulation that's it that it's Vindicated and it's proved [Music] it's called in the scripture and we want to refer it as new wine we always refer to it like that as they are drunk in a new wine spiritually or spiritual wine I think the best interpretation would be it will be spiritual wine as the natural wine reveal itself in the stimulation in the stimulated power so that's the new wine are lucky to give an apology as he reveals the word of God which is Spirit oh now the word itself is Spirit you believe that stimulation the power of Revelation we receive a message a complete word it has it has all the power of of Resurrection God has given us Grace and there's not a mystery that's left suspended in the Bible and that has to stimulate us do we have to be certain of who our God is and it will keep us stable look at the frames of Jesus martyr and Mary they had their brother Lazarus when we read and I believe Luke 10 . the Bible says Jesus was staying with him and when he was talking about the word Mary was sitted next to Jesus and she was listening Marta was taking care of the the things of the house and washing dishes and then after a while Mao took him to Jesus it says doesn't bother you that Mary is there sitting I'm over there working by myself Jesus told her you are worried about the little things but Mary chose the right thing some could say that Martha was carnal sometimes a little bit too quickly we judge one another oh look at him oh he's not spiritual oh Marta he's not spiritual but look you know they're preaching over here and she's over there in the kitchen but when Lazarus died in John 11 John chapter 11. we'll see that Martha the one we call carnal she had a revelation of who Jesus was difficult she had a very difficult trial she lost her brother when her brother was sick they call Jesus was sick Jesus went further for others he said oh that Pastor doesn't have love d I mean difficult times I call them and I know they told because they told me it was there he didn't come he didn't even say anything and now they told me that he traveled he went over there he doesn't have love and now my brother's dead and when Lazarus died look at this pastor who didn't have love he's now coming to the funeral Martin when she heard that Jesus was coming if we can read it chapter 11 verse 20. or anything then martyr as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went to meet him but Mary sat still in the house then martyr then said martyr unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother would have not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee Jesus said unto her thy water shall rise again Martha said unto him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection in the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth on me though he though he he were dead yet shall live and whosoever liveth and and believe and liveth and believeth in me shall never die if we can stop there for now regardless of the trial she was having it and she knew that regardless of the trial that she had that she started by saying Lord you say I know that if thou had been here my brother would not die it was true that if you were here in other words when we called upon you if you came Lazarus was not gonna die but that's not the problem it's already gone but I know also that all that you would ask now even now it will come to pass oh what kind of faith oh what kind of assurance oh what kind of Regulation I was she knew she didn't look at the fact that he went and never came she knew that in the valley he was God he do that up on the hill it was good that in my trials he's God he said if he can just say one thing that will come to pass [Music] all that shocked Jesus and when she finished she went to Mary she said to Mary the master has come and he's calling you when Mary comes same thing I know that if you were here my brother would not die but now even now even now oh if we can say that tonight that even now if you say something even now if you say something oh yeah yeah the regardless of my sickness even now regardless of my financial situation even now get yourself regardless of the situation of my family even now [Applause] when she said that even now Jesus could not contain himself he said where did you bury him where did you bury him where where is he even now Jesus understood that they had the Revelation that even in difficulties they cannot deny me they know who I am says in the same Jesus tonight and we believe we have the same Jesus tonight that we too we can just approach him as as Mary did declaration [Music] the only man I ever lived that could make that this statement the Bible says he wasn't even much to look up to look at probably a little Fray looking person I can see him straighten up his little frame is and make this statement I'm the resurrection and life he declares that to each one and every one of us tonight I am the resurrection in life never a man could say that and keep no afterward will there be will there ever be I am the resurrection and life he that believeth on me though he though he ever be dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth believe it in me shall never die Oh Come with certainty that now we have everlasting life if you have the personal revelation that Jesus has elected you that he gave you eternal life nothing is going to stop you and that our name are written in the Lamb's Book of Life it says there's a there's a grave laying under the body in there is all molded he's speaking about the body of Lazarus the first thing that fall that folding in the body is the nose skin worm is going through in and out it says a heartbroken sister you know a broken hearted sister but martyr s standing by the Fountain of Life and he heard he heard the word oh I love it let me tell you in Focus she must believe for the impossible then that's what we've got to do you've got to believe the impossible in order to have new life let me also say this as God's servant yes you said the question because I know from what I speak let perceive software The Impossible Are Made Real when when God is stuck at his word when we believe when when we take God at his word The Impossible Is Made Real la La Lazarus was dead we never heard of a man dead for three days who was resurrected it was impossible but Malta believed and even now to secure whatever that will ask that in other words even now that's the resurrection of Lazarus that's impossible can become a reality that's right yes yes he says [Music] when any person will take that same word it will bring the same result every time every time you ask it now listen she heard him say I am the resurrection in life he that believeth on me though is dead shall he live and she believed it said yeah Lord I believe Thou Art the Son of God that was come to into the world look at a confession regardless look at her approach I'm not yelling at you I don't mean to do to be that but look she's standing there oh to stand in a place [Music] oh to stand in a place oh tonight I want to stand at the place of matter before the Lord Jesus Christ he says can you stand there tonight brother
