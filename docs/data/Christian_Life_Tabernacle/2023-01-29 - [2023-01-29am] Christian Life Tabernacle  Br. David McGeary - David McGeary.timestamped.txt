[6:37] [Music]
[6:40] the hearts are guiding they turn around
[6:42] and welcome someone this morning and
[6:45] then certainly happy to have all our
[6:47] visitors we welcome you this morning
[6:48] amen
[6:52] amen you may have your seats this
[6:53] morning as you're invited by the Mike
[6:55] before I saw him reading
[7:13] good morning we're gonna
[7:17] turn to Psalm 112 this morning
[7:20] there's a verse there that
[7:23] just kind of caught my attention said uh
[7:26] in verse five
[7:28] it says a good man showeth favor
[7:31] and lindeth
[7:33] he will guide his affairs with
[7:35] discretion
[7:37] and then from there all the way to the
[7:39] end of the chapter
[7:41] it describes the characteristics
[7:45] the testimony
[7:47] the actions of a good man
[7:51] it says in verse 6 he will not be moved
[7:53] forever
[7:55] it says in verse 7 he shall not be
[7:57] afraid of evil tidings
[7:59] his heart is fixed
[8:02] trusting in the Lord
[8:06] it says in verse 8 his heart is
[8:07] established
[8:09] he shall not be afraid
[8:12] in verse 9 he hath dispersed
[8:15] he hath given to the poor
[8:17] his righteousness endureth forever
[8:20] his horn shall be exalted With Honor
[8:23] what a wonderful testimony
[8:26] what a wonderful set of characteristics
[8:27] a good man
[8:30] but as I was thinking about this there
[8:32] was once a man who approached Jesus
[8:35] in Matthew 19.
[8:38] and when he called him good master
[8:41] he said why call us thou me good
[8:46] there is none good but one
[8:50] that is God
[8:53] who in fact David says in an earlier
[8:56] Psalm Psalm 14
[8:58] he says the Lord looked down from heaven
[9:00] upon the Children of Men
[9:03] to see if there were any that did
[9:04] understand and seek God
[9:07] they are all gone aside
[9:10] they are all together become filthy
[9:12] there is none that doeth good
[9:15] no not one
[9:19] in fact this is the same verse that
[9:21] Psalm that Paul quotes in Romans 3 there
[9:25] is none that doeth good no not one
[9:28] so you have
[9:31] a paradox here to use the word that
[9:33] brother Branham did
[9:36] you know on the one hand the word makes
[9:38] very clear
[9:40] that there is a good man
[9:43] that has all these characteristics but
[9:45] on the other hand says there's no such
[9:47] thing as a good man
[9:51] you know it I got to thinking about that
[9:54] is
[9:56] how do we
[9:57] how do we reconcile that how do we
[9:59] connect the dots that there's a good man
[10:02] here's what it looks like
[10:04] but there's no such thing as a good man
[10:10] you know we live in a world that defines
[10:13] good
[10:15] by man's standards
[10:19] you know they define a person as being
[10:21] good
[10:23] by the good things that they do based on
[10:26] what the world describes or Society
[10:28] describes as good
[10:30] right what
[10:33] looks good
[10:35] what feels good
[10:37] what sounds good
[10:40] you know what you know
[10:42] what's a good work
[10:45] you know
[10:47] a man's version of good
[10:50] Looking Good Feeling Good sounding good
[10:53] good works is at its best filthy rags
[10:57] amen
[10:59] you know if we're not careful
[11:02] you know we can even allow that thinking
[11:05] to influence us even in church
[11:08] right
[11:10] where a service is good
[11:12] if it feels good
[11:15] a sermon is good if it sounds good
[11:18] or looks good
[11:20] or feels good
[11:22] our fellow brothers and sisters
[11:25] are good
[11:27] if they do good works
[11:29] or if they sound good or look good
[11:35] we can look at ourselves
[11:38] and we can say I'm no good
[11:41] because we don't look good
[11:44] or we don't feel good
[11:46] maybe we don't always do good things or
[11:50] Worse we can look at ourselves and say
[11:52] we are good
[11:53] because we think we look good
[11:55] or are doing good things
[11:59] but you know folks we don't even know
[12:00] what good is
[12:02] until we've come in contact with the
[12:04] good one amen
[12:07] you know I got to thinking about that as
[12:09] we were reading Psalm 112 you know John
[12:13] in third John
[12:15] a book that's so easy to miss
[12:17] the one who was perhaps one of the first
[12:20] to meet this good one
[12:22] said in verse 11 beloved follow not that
[12:25] which is evil but that which is good
[12:28] he that doeth good
[12:31] is of God
[12:34] but he that doeth evil hath not seen God
[12:38] he that doeth good
[12:40] a good man
[12:42] is someone whose God made
[12:45] God crafted
[12:47] God born
[12:50] someone who is of God
[12:54] it's interesting in Matthew when this
[12:57] man came to Jesus and called him good
[13:00] he was looking for the right formula
[13:03] the Right Mix
[13:05] of goodness that he could put together
[13:09] to experience eternal life
[13:12] you know when Jesus quickly identified
[13:15] that no matter how good he was
[13:18] how many good things he had or how many
[13:21] good things he'd done
[13:23] how good he looked or how good he felt
[13:27] good couldn't happen
[13:30] until he surrendered every good thing
[13:33] and came in contact with the good one
[13:38] you know until he died to everything
[13:40] that was good
[13:42] from man's definition
[13:45] the feeling good the looking good the
[13:48] sounding good the good works
[13:52] you know he could not enter in and we
[13:54] know the story he walked away sorrowful
[13:56] because there were so many good things
[13:57] he couldn't let go of
[14:01] it says in Romans 12 I beseech you
[14:03] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[14:05] that ye present your body as a Living
[14:07] Sacrifice
[14:09] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[14:11] reasonable service
[14:13] and be not conformed to this world this
[14:16] Society
[14:17] man's definitions of what is good
[14:20] but be transformed by the renewing of
[14:23] your mind that you may prove
[14:25] demonstrate show
[14:28] what is that good
[14:30] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[14:35] you know if you want to go ahead and
[14:36] stand this morning we're going to read
[14:38] Psalm 112 which speaks of the good man
[14:42] you know and interestingly enough in
[14:43] verse 2 it says his seed shall be Mighty
[14:46] on the earth I think we all know he's
[14:48] speaking of an offspring
[14:51] he's speaking of someone who's God born
[14:54] God crafted
[14:56] God made
[14:58] to be in His image just as sons are an
[15:00] image of a father
[15:03] that there might be someone on the Earth
[15:06] who could be the good man that's Psalm
[15:09] 112 is speaking about
[15:12] you know if we start to read Psalm 112
[15:15] this morning the question I would ask do
[15:17] we have any good people in the house not
[15:20] those that have done good things or look
[15:22] good or sound good but who have met the
[15:24] good one
[15:26] and see that his hand evident in our
[15:29] lives
[15:30] let's read that together as our
[15:31] testimony starting in verse one praise
[15:34] ye the Lord
[15:35] blessed is the man that feareth the Lord
[15:37] that delighteth greatly in his
[15:39] Commandments his seed shall be Mighty
[15:42] upon Earth the generation of the upright
[15:44] shall be blessed wealth and riches shall
[15:47] be in his house and his righteousness
[15:49] endureth forever unto the upright there
[15:52] are a rise of light in the darkness he
[15:55] is gracious and full of compassion and
[15:57] righteous a good man showeth favor and
[16:00] lend it he will guide his affairs with
[16:03] discretion surely he shall not be moved
[16:05] forever the righteous shall be an
[16:08] everlasting remembrance he shall not be
[16:10] afraid of evil Tidings his heart is
[16:13] fixed trusting in the Lord his heart is
[16:15] established he shall not be afraid until
[16:18] to see his desire upon his enemies he
[16:21] hath dispersed he hath given to the poor
[16:23] his righteousness endures forever his
[16:26] horn shall be exalted with honor the
[16:29] wicked shall see it and be grieved he
[16:31] shall gnash with his teeth and melt away
[16:33] the desire of the wicked kids Shall
[16:36] Perish amen

[29:18] thank you
[29:25] lately I've been looking back
[29:29] along this Winding Road
[29:33] to the old familiar markers
[29:37] of the mercies I have known
[29:41] I know it may sound simple
[29:45] but it's more than a cliche
[29:49] there's no better way to tell you than
[29:53] to say
[29:57] God's been
[29:59] good
[30:00] in my life
[30:05] I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams
[30:10] when I go to sleep each night
[30:14] though I've had my share of hard times I
[30:19] wouldn't change them if I could
[30:22] [Music]
[30:30] oh
[30:30] God's been good
[30:35] times replay and I can see that I've
[30:40] cried some bitter tears
[30:43] but I felt his arms around me
[30:47] as I face my greatest fears you see I've
[30:52] had more gains than losses
[30:56] I've known more joy than hurt as his
[31:00] grace rolled down upon me
[31:05] undeserved
[31:08] God's been good in my life
[31:15] I feel blessed beyond my wildest dreams
[31:20] when I go to sleep each night and though
[31:24] I've had my share of hard times I
[31:28] wouldn't change them if I could
[31:33] cause through it all
[31:40] God's been
[31:45] my father
[31:48] my savior and my friend his love was my
[31:54] beginning
[31:56] his love will be mine I could spend
[32:02] forever trying to tell you everything he
[32:07] is
[32:10] but the best way I can say it is
[32:19] [Music]
[32:26] I feel so blessed beyond my wildest
[32:30] dreams when I go to sleep each night
[32:34] and though I've had my share of hard
[32:38] times I wouldn't change them if I could
[32:44] cause through it all

[34:59] yesterday and
[35:01] you know

[35:18] a lot of my family and loved ones you
[35:22] know we get down and we're up and we're
[35:24] down we're up and you know I just I was

[35:35] hardness as a good soldier of Jesus
[35:37] Christ no man that that worth entangleth
[35:42] himself with the Affairs of this life
[35:44] that he may please him who hath chosen
[35:48] him to be a soldier and you know I just
[35:51] I thought about that and
[35:53] and just the Lord really dealt with my
[35:56] heart and you know we sometimes we get
[35:59] downtrodden and we don't even mean to we
[36:01] don't even realize we're doing it
[36:03] but you know God always every time he's
[36:07] brought me through and I I just wanted

[44:21] Lord there's only one God
[44:25] the creator of Heaven and Earth
[44:29] the maker of all things
[44:34] and Lord we gathered this morning
[44:37] to Fellowship one with another we
[44:42] love seeing and talking to one another
[44:48] Lord we're gathered to sing in worship
[44:51] [Music]
[44:53] we love to sing and worship Lord and
[44:56] praise
[45:00] Lord we love the blessings of your
[45:03] spirit and the inspiration
[45:06] of the singing
[45:09] but father above all this morning we've
[45:12] come that you would speak to our heart
[45:16] Lord that you would just talk to us
[45:19] individually
[45:21] wherever that we are whatever station in
[45:24] life
[45:25] whatever mile marker on the trail the
[45:28] glory that we've arrived at
[45:32] Lord we believe you have a word of
[45:35] encouragement
[45:36] instruction correction and guidance
[45:40] and Lord we long to hear that this
[45:43] morning
[45:44] [Music]
[45:45] Lord with all my heart I believe that
[45:52] you sent an angel Messenger to our age
[45:58] and father he was
[46:05] designed in made to be a prophet
[46:10] to speak with you lip to ear and
[46:15] and father he delivered to us truth
[46:19] father We Believe with all our heart
[46:23] that that truth has been stored and
[46:27] placed in such a manner that you would
[46:29] open it to us a long life's journey
[46:33] that we could feed and gain strength to
[46:36] continue on our journey
[46:38] we asked this morning that you would
[46:41] feed our hearts and our souls touch our
[46:43] bodies give peace to our minds and
[46:46] spirit because we love you this morning
[46:49] with all our heart
[46:51] in Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[46:55] pray amen
[46:57] amen God bless you while you're standing
[47:00] let's just read one quick scripture in
[47:03] the Bible before we go forward this
[47:05] morning
[47:08] in any way I I I love this um uh
[47:14] this is a portrait somebody gave me of
[47:17] me preaching I thought that was that's
[47:20] pretty good uh I was thinking of putting
[47:23] that in the foyer
[47:25] but I got a pretty big mouth and so I
[47:28] don't I I don't know if there's a hidden
[47:31] message there or not but let's turn to
[47:34] Genesis 1 1.
[47:38] and uh
[47:48] and it said in the beginning God
[47:52] in the beginning God
[47:55] and we know we have a greater
[47:57] understanding of that scripture than
[47:59] most people
[48:00] because our messenger told us that he
[48:02] wasn't even God in the beginning because
[48:05] there was nothing even to worship Him so
[48:08] he made angels and he says in the
[48:11] beginning God created the heavens and
[48:14] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[48:17] and void and darkness was upon the face
[48:21] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[48:24] upon the face of the waters Heavenly
[48:28] Father we ask you to bless your word
[48:30] this in Jesus precious name we pray amen
[48:34] amen God bless you may be heated
[48:41] um we're going to play uh 26 minutes
[48:43] this morning out of uh the message
[48:47] Christ revealed in his own word but I'd
[48:52] like just to make a few comments uh
[48:54] beforehand this morning more as a
[48:59] just a Sunday school lesson
[49:03] and to just uh
[49:05] uh
[49:07] stabilize this if I could say that
[49:09] brother Brown makes this statement
[49:12] in the message that we're going to
[49:16] listen to
[49:17] he says
[49:20] now my text this morning is Christ is
[49:23] revealed in his own word
[49:27] that is a great statement isn't it so if
[49:32] you want to find him you have to find
[49:34] him where he's revealed
[49:37] so he said Christ is revealed in his own
[49:39] word now where I uh
[49:43] he says
[49:48] he says and where I come to the
[49:51] conclusion to talk on this was because
[49:55] that Christ can say this is why I I want
[49:58] to talk on this subject
[50:00] so the prophet of God's going to
[50:02] minister this message
[50:03] called Christ is revealed in his own
[50:07] word
[50:08] and there's a reason that he's motivated
[50:13] if I could or led by the spirit or
[50:16] inspired whatever words in the
[50:19] vocabulary that you would like to use to
[50:22] express this but he had a reason for
[50:24] preaching it
[50:26] and so he says this here and this is in
[50:29] paragraph 17
[50:31] he says knowing that we
[50:34] say we mustn't just say because we're
[50:39] gathered together
[50:40] to just
[50:42] haphazardly speak on anything
[50:46] but it's something that will help
[50:48] stabilize
[50:50] the people
[50:53] and I thought you know that was kind of
[50:55] uh I took that as my motivation to this
[51:01] morning that
[51:03] um
[51:04] uh what what would be the reason that I
[51:07] would preach this morning maybe not to
[51:09] bring an inspiration to bring a teaching
[51:12] or to motivate Faith uh that you might
[51:17] receive healing or that to preach in a
[51:21] manner that there might be conviction
[51:24] to bring repentance these might all be
[51:28] different motivations for a person
[51:33] bringing a sermon
[51:35] uh maybe sometimes it's Cur for
[51:38] correction but I thought we we want to
[51:42] approach this this morning to make sure
[51:45] that we're stable
[51:47] you know to be stabilized this morning
[51:50] to understand uh that we're standing on
[51:55] a rock
[51:56] and that rock is stable and if you have
[51:59] confidence in that rock you'll stay with
[52:02] that rock
[52:03] and and so the things that we're
[52:06] speaking this morning are uh may be not
[52:10] so much to Enlighten you to something
[52:13] that you haven't heard foreseen or to
[52:17] put something in a certain light that
[52:20] you can understand it better but the
[52:22] motivation this morning
[52:24] stabilization just to be stabilized
[52:28] because uh uh there's uh we're in the
[52:33] hour of great storm and let me say is as
[52:37] I continue to read he said
[52:41] to talk on this was knowing that
[52:44] that what we say we must mustn't just
[52:49] say because we're gathered together to
[52:52] somehow paddlers speak on anything
[52:55] but it's something that will help
[52:57] stabilize the people
[52:59] so if
[53:01] this is a good uh understanding so if
[53:04] you find yourself in a place of
[53:07] unstabilization or wonderment here's the
[53:10] message
[53:12] that'll help stabilize you
[53:16] for we are going to pass through
[53:19] dangerous and treacherous Waters
[53:22] now
[53:24] and we'll you'll hear all this I'm just
[53:27] giving you some of my motivation this
[53:29] morning and why that I'm doing
[53:33] what is more treacherous than Satan
[53:36] appearing as an angel of Light
[53:45] um
[53:46] and that's what this is this is the age
[53:50] of deception
[53:53] and you know you can't
[53:56] be with somebody every place they go
[54:00] you can't sit down with everybody and
[54:04] help them walk through every decision
[54:07] that they have to make
[54:11] you can't undo
[54:13] decisions that people have made
[54:17] but the best you can do is to to
[54:21] bring them something that will stabilize
[54:25] them so when you're stabilized and you
[54:29] become stabilized if I could express it
[54:32] like this the maybe you've made
[54:35] decisions and and there's Tremors uh
[54:39] from those decisions there are side
[54:41] effects there's there's results in
[54:44] everything and those waves are still uh
[54:48] trickling through your life well you you
[54:51] can't go on like that you've got to be
[54:54] able to get stable
[54:56] you've got to stabilize you gotta once
[54:59] you get your your feet back under you
[55:01] and you become stabilized and and you
[55:04] start getting on some ground uh then you
[55:07] can handle the things that come look
[55:10] when you're unstable then you're you're
[55:14] really not good for anything
[55:17] and you'll just continually to be tossed
[55:20] to and fro by every wind of Doctrine
[55:24] every wind of circumstance but when you
[55:27] can become anchored and stabilized in
[55:30] other words you know what you're
[55:32] standing on and you know that what
[55:35] you're standing on will not be washed
[55:37] away
[55:40] you know everybody in the great storms
[55:43] they had many people they could they
[55:45] they refused to evacuate because uh the
[55:50] prior storms weren't so bad and all of a
[55:53] sudden they found themselves in a storm
[55:55] that was greater than that they had
[55:58] imagined and then they begin to lose
[56:01] confidence
[56:03] in what they were in
[56:08] good very good we don't we've got to
[56:11] have confidence going forward
[56:13] we've got to be sure where we stand what
[56:17] we're standing on why we're standing on
[56:20] it why we're holding to it
[56:23] and we've got to know no matter what it
[56:26] looks like
[56:27] no matter if how he appears that angel
[56:31] of Light with signs wonders and
[56:34] everything you know you've heard the
[56:36] voice of God and you're staying with it
[56:41] and so we see that and he says in
[56:45] and he says and we are
[56:49] sailing through them
[56:51] and sometimes I guess it's with you like
[56:55] it is with me
[56:56] that it seems like that so much of it is
[57:01] such a scare
[57:03] amen
[57:05] now is not the time to get afraid
[57:09] all right so that's what why we're going
[57:11] forward this morning
[57:14] is we're we just want to anchor down
[57:19] and be sure I I so this brought me to
[57:24] um
[57:25] uh a few statements out of the message
[57:29] called God is identified by his
[57:33] characteristics and uh let me see if I
[57:37] can give you the date on that if you
[57:39] would like to put that on the board it's
[57:43] a third the third of November 6th oh
[57:48] three eleven
[57:50] and this is starting in paragraph
[57:59] okay let's just start with the 18th he
[58:02] says now I believe the Bible says
[58:07] that
[58:09] he won't I don't believe God will judge
[58:12] the World by the Pentecostal Church
[58:16] by the Methodist Baptist or Catholic
[58:21] he'll judge it by Jesus Christ
[58:24] he said so
[58:26] and Christ is the word
[58:30] in the beginning was the word
[58:33] in the beginning was God in the
[58:36] beginning was the word and the Word was
[58:40] with God and the Word was God and the
[58:45] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[58:47] the same yesterday today and forever
[58:54] Coke it's all been settled from the
[58:56] beginning
[58:58] he said the whole thing is the great
[59:03] eternal
[59:05] now that
[59:08] statements like that just sit me in my
[59:11] chair
[59:13] the whole thing is just the great
[59:15] eternal
[59:18] boy a lot of stuff goes on in this world
[59:20] that don't mean a thing all the rocket
[59:25] ships all the trips to Mars uh all the
[59:29] exploring of the deep all the libraries
[59:33] all the education everything they got is
[59:37] all going to come to naught it's only
[59:39] going to be the way he said it was going
[59:42] to be he's Alpha he's Omega he's the
[59:46] beginning he's the end it's one big
[59:50] eternal
[59:52] thank you
[59:53] aren't you glad you know that
[59:58] why of all people
[1:00:01] did he elect you
[1:00:04] I don't know
[1:00:07] like I said he didn't allow me to pick
[1:00:09] the church
[1:00:13] boy they'd have been a bunch of Rascals
[1:00:15] they would have looked good on the
[1:00:16] outside like our brother said this
[1:00:18] morning you know but would they have
[1:00:21] been good
[1:00:23] I remember a man came to me one time and
[1:00:26] he put his finger in my face and he said
[1:00:28] you use mind control
[1:00:31] I said buddy if I use mind control I
[1:00:34] wouldn't have people like you in my
[1:00:36] church
[1:00:40] you know well I'd have uh you know
[1:00:45] people like Bill Gates and and Edwin
[1:00:49] Elon Musk and you know what I mean
[1:00:53] you'd be great I I I'd get people with a
[1:00:56] lot of cash
[1:00:59] right but how far would that be away
[1:01:02] from God's word
[1:01:03] because God didn't come to the rich in
[1:01:06] this world
[1:01:07] but he came to the poor of this world
[1:01:10] rich in faith
[1:01:14] amen dollars will keep you here
[1:01:17] the spirit of God will get you out of
[1:01:19] here
[1:01:21] so we we you just you got to just put it
[1:01:26] away it's by his choosing in his
[1:01:29] election he said the whole thing is just
[1:01:32] the great eternal
[1:01:35] eternity never did begin and can never
[1:01:38] end
[1:01:40] therefore in this great Eternal one was
[1:01:45] attributes
[1:01:48] to be a father
[1:01:50] to be a son to be a savior
[1:01:53] to be healer
[1:01:56] and all these things was in him
[1:02:01] and only thing that's happening now is
[1:02:06] displaying his attributes that's
[1:02:10] all
[1:02:13] right now so I don't care what everybody
[1:02:16] else says is going on riots and and
[1:02:20] trouble here in economy and and all this
[1:03:01] it's not the reality what's going on is
[1:03:04] God is displaying his attributes that is
[1:03:09] all
[1:03:11] what a message
[1:03:13] what what a word of comfort to his
[1:03:15] church he'll come out and say I know
[1:03:18] it's dark because perilous times shall
[1:03:21] come
[1:03:21] men shall no longer desire to retain God
[1:03:25] in their thinking and God's going to
[1:03:27] give them over to a reprobate mind and
[1:03:30] and we see that we look out we see the
[1:03:33] darkness we see the floods of darkness
[1:03:35] and if we don't we look at those windy
[1:03:38] storms and we wonder will our Rock hold
[1:03:44] but now we stand up and we can say but
[1:03:47] wait a minute
[1:03:48] all that's really happening
[1:03:52] is God's displaying his attributes
[1:03:57] he will display
[1:04:00] his power
[1:04:02] to deliver his children out of the
[1:04:05] spiritual Egypt just the way he
[1:04:08] delivered his children out of physical
[1:04:11] Egypt
[1:04:14] which with the power of His spoken word
[1:04:19] so we can rest
[1:04:21] let us read on just a few statements
[1:04:24] because it's wonderful
[1:04:27] now
[1:04:31] our names were put
[1:04:33] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:04:37] foundation of the world
[1:04:47] so how many of you had anything to do
[1:04:50] with that
[1:04:51] three
[1:04:52] I believe it was God talking with job he
[1:04:58] said where were you
[1:05:01] when the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:05:04] before the foundation of the world where
[1:05:06] were you
[1:05:09] no wonder job finally got the answer to
[1:05:11] that he said though the skin worms eat
[1:05:14] my flesh yet I'll see God
[1:05:17] he finally knew where he was
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:21] he said
[1:05:23] world and and when the word strikes that
[1:05:29] if it's any light in there
[1:05:32] that been ordained to life Jesus said no
[1:05:37] man can come to me except my father
[1:05:41] draws
[1:05:43] and all that my father has given me will
[1:05:47] come
[1:05:48] so you see its word
[1:05:52] constantly the word the word
[1:05:56] it's just run that back because this is
[1:05:58] this is one of our things that we've got
[1:06:01] to be sure of
[1:06:03] and understand to be stabilized
[1:06:08] it was there before you knew it
[1:06:12] right
[1:06:14] found he says
[1:06:17] now our names were put on the Lamb's
[1:06:19] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:06:22] the world
[1:06:23] and when the word strikes that
[1:06:28] if it's any light there
[1:06:31] that's been ordained to life
[1:06:34] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:06:38] the father draws him and all that my
[1:06:42] father has given me will come
[1:06:45] so you see
[1:06:47] it's the word constantly the word now
[1:06:50] I'm speaking tonight upon the subject
[1:06:53] drawing from a text
[1:06:56] out of our text that we read God is
[1:07:00] identified by his characteristics
[1:07:04] the prophet of God takes a few moments
[1:07:06] to discuss the different birds and
[1:07:10] different animals and how they're
[1:07:12] identified by their characteristic we're
[1:07:15] we know you've heard those things many
[1:07:18] times but let's just drop down to the
[1:07:20] 26th verse and
[1:07:23] a verse is I guess it's still a verse
[1:07:26] even though it's not a Bible verse
[1:07:28] it says then we come down to a human
[1:07:31] life
[1:07:33] the characteristics between a man and a
[1:07:37] woman
[1:07:38] there's a difference
[1:07:41] they're both human beings
[1:07:44] but the characteristics of the two sects
[1:07:47] detects them
[1:07:50] I was reading some time ago about one of
[1:07:54] the problems that was put to the test of
[1:07:59] Solomon
[1:08:00] by the queen
[1:08:02] and she had some woman dressed like men
[1:08:07] and and Solomon
[1:08:10] had them to walk and do a few things
[1:08:13] quickly and said them's women
[1:08:16] see because that he could tell
[1:08:19] the way they did
[1:08:21] the characteristics of them was woman
[1:08:25] there's something about it
[1:08:28] that you can't hide it
[1:08:31] it's a woman because her characteristic
[1:08:34] disnotes her as to be a woman
[1:08:38] why do you think Satan is on such a
[1:08:42] great battle
[1:08:45] to obscure
[1:08:47] characteristic
[1:08:54] because God's identified by his
[1:08:57] characteristics
[1:09:00] you understand that it's constantly the
[1:09:03] word in the beginning was the word Phil
[1:09:07] he wants to obscure that identity of
[1:09:11] characteristic
[1:09:13] so he wants to change the way that man
[1:09:18] discerns and looks at things
[1:09:23] okay
[1:09:24] you realize that
[1:09:26] it starts a lot of times
[1:09:30] the course of unbelief it starts in the
[1:09:33] carnal Realm
[1:09:36] and the carnal world gets there
[1:09:39] and because the church world is
[1:09:43] dependent and relying on the carnal
[1:09:47] world for its existence
[1:09:52] did that you understand that
[1:09:55] that as the world changes they have to
[1:10:00] change their gospel
[1:10:03] to appeal
[1:10:07] you know the Baptist Church
[1:10:11] and I I've heard this with my own ears
[1:10:13] from
[1:10:15] Dr Criswell
[1:10:17] who was the president of the Baptist and
[1:10:20] the pastor of Dallas
[1:10:23] he said there was a time that the women
[1:10:26] in the Baptist Church would not wear
[1:10:29] pants to church
[1:10:33] but then the pants suit
[1:10:36] came in
[1:10:39] now what was that little way it was a
[1:10:42] way that the woman that was going to
[1:10:45] work could show up in the business World
[1:10:48] in a suit
[1:10:53] that's where they started they were
[1:10:55] pants suits
[1:10:56] there were suits for women and as that
[1:11:00] became accepted in the carnal world
[1:11:04] then the church world had to adapt to it
[1:11:09] you want to be stable
[1:11:11] God's word doesn't need to adapt
[1:11:19] because God's eternal
[1:11:23] so the all of it the whole of it is just
[1:11:27] him
[1:11:29] manifesting his attributes so what goes
[1:11:33] on outside of God doesn't change God
[1:11:39] so we have got to quit
[1:11:42] trying to take the word of God and
[1:11:45] trying to fit it
[1:11:48] to the world and trying to fit the world
[1:11:51] to the word there are two different
[1:11:54] separate things
[1:11:59] I get a lot of questions
[1:12:01] about should I go to
[1:12:05] Bible studies
[1:12:08] I don't care
[1:12:10] if if you want to get together with some
[1:12:14] people and have them I don't have any
[1:12:16] say over that
[1:12:18] I don't
[1:12:21] you want to visit churches I don't have
[1:12:23] any say over that
[1:12:26] I I don't want to rule people that way
[1:12:31] but let me tell you what happens
[1:12:34] you go there and they're reading the
[1:12:36] Bible and they're sweet and they've got
[1:12:40] an anointing and they they love God
[1:12:47] I'm saying this because I know what
[1:12:49] we're going to listen to
[1:12:52] and they love God and and and pretty
[1:12:55] soon you look at me and says well how
[1:12:58] can they not be Christians
[1:13:06] and naturally you have sympathy
[1:13:12] naturally you you
[1:13:14] and you want to know something
[1:13:18] are they elected I don't know that
[1:13:21] are they Christians yes
[1:13:23] what else could you call them
[1:13:27] but they're there's
[1:13:29] something that
[1:13:32] has not happened within them
[1:13:35] that can only happen to the elect
[1:13:47] and so that's where that that's what
[1:13:52] starts to happen
[1:13:55] there's another characteristic that
[1:13:58] you've got to be able to identify they
[1:14:01] can have all all those guys they did all
[1:14:04] those things right and then Solomon
[1:14:07] looked at him and he said do this
[1:14:16] they couldn't quite do that just right
[1:14:18] somebody said do this
[1:14:21] it couldn't let you gain no men
[1:14:24] and women
[1:14:26] you know they're all sweet
[1:14:29] until you say you know there's no such
[1:14:30] thing as a trinity
[1:14:38] the Bible says the woman shouldn't put
[1:14:41] on a garment pertains to a man
[1:14:46] oh
[1:14:48] what's starting to happen
[1:14:51] they're characteristics
[1:14:55] to that sweet little person that was
[1:14:58] wooing you into their fellowships will
[1:15:01] will grow fangs
[1:15:06] you know that's biblical
[1:15:08] right
[1:15:11] I believe it was improverty so she looks
[1:15:14] my mic's off
[1:15:16] oh I'm bleeding all right
[1:15:19] that's that's what happens when you get
[1:15:23] old I wish this flood could do you
[1:15:24] something good but all the blood's
[1:15:27] already been given to you that doing any
[1:15:30] good Gary run around see if there's a
[1:15:32] Band-Aid in my uh I bump my uh my hand
[1:15:35] on the corner of the pulpit here uh
[1:15:38] so you know that now you kind of now
[1:15:42] that true characteristic is identified
[1:15:44] so let's just read on here he says
[1:15:48] he says he says down here he says so
[1:15:52] everything is her characteristics to
[1:15:55] note that she's a woman
[1:15:57] it's just like right-handed and
[1:15:59] left-handed people
[1:16:01] they're both people
[1:16:03] you watch one of them is right-handed
[1:16:06] the other is Left-Handed watch the way
[1:16:08] their characteristics detect them you
[1:16:12] can tell whether they're right or
[1:16:14] left-handed or not
[1:16:17] I got a nurse putting my my band anybody
[1:16:21] no Deacon can do this I I got I got
[1:16:25] nurses around here
[1:16:27] is there a doctor in the house
[1:16:29] thank you brother so much I like it
[1:16:34] amen
[1:16:39] he says he says watch their
[1:16:41] characteristics the attempt to attack
[1:16:43] the left or right-handed
[1:16:46] he says yet they both got hands they
[1:16:51] both look exactly alike just exactly
[1:16:54] alike
[1:16:59] so what are we talking about being
[1:17:01] stabilization first of all to be
[1:17:03] stabilized you've got to be able to know
[1:17:06] how to remove
[1:17:09] things that are not determining factors
[1:17:16] yeah now when you read this message
[1:17:19] we're only going to listen to a little
[1:17:21] bit of it but when you read this message
[1:17:23] at Christ revealed in his own word the
[1:17:27] whole message is brother Brahms going
[1:17:29] forward is he's peeling away things that
[1:17:32] aren't the word he peels away baptism he
[1:17:36] peels away evidence he peels away this
[1:17:39] he he's taping all the things out of the
[1:17:43] way
[1:17:44] that are keeping the pure True Word of
[1:17:50] God from coming in full View
[1:17:55] now he's identified in his word
[1:18:00] right so everything that he spoke in the
[1:18:03] days of Moses he was identified in that
[1:18:06] day
[1:18:07] didn't matter what anybody else was
[1:18:09] doing
[1:18:10] what Pharaoh was doing or nothing it's
[1:18:13] what God was doing
[1:18:18] let's just hold what we what what we
[1:18:21] want to really be anchored
[1:18:23] in
[1:18:25] foreign
[1:18:29] that we find can be identified by its
[1:18:32] characteristics not its anointing
[1:18:36] but its characteristics
[1:18:40] so uh we're reading down here
[1:18:43] he says
[1:18:47] they look at just just exactly alike I
[1:18:51] might drop a little something here
[1:18:54] Jesus said in Matthew the 24th chapter
[1:18:59] that in the last days
[1:19:02] the two Spirits would be so close
[1:19:05] together until it would deceive the very
[1:19:09] elect if possible
[1:19:16] now
[1:19:18] you better know what you're looking for
[1:19:22] you better have a clear understanding
[1:19:25] when you come and contact things what is
[1:19:28] it that I'm looking for
[1:19:31] if and we'll listen to it in just a few
[1:19:34] minutes 25 minutes
[1:19:37] is it anointing
[1:19:40] wait till you hear it prophet of God
[1:19:42] says about an anointing
[1:19:44] is it signs and wonders
[1:19:47] wait till what he says about signs and
[1:19:50] wonders
[1:19:52] is it worship
[1:19:55] wait till you hear what he says about
[1:19:57] signs and wonders
[1:20:00] there's something that identifies the
[1:20:03] believer
[1:20:06] what separated the eagle from the
[1:20:08] chickens
[1:20:15] now that's just
[1:20:17] like looking at the right hand and the
[1:20:20] left hand
[1:20:21] they both got thumbs fingers nails small
[1:20:26] fingers middle fingers and so forth
[1:20:28] index
[1:20:30] they're all different fingers
[1:20:33] they both the thumb prints
[1:20:37] only one's turned one way the other the
[1:20:40] other both the same print made the same
[1:20:44] way only thumb prints everything is
[1:20:47] identified alike
[1:20:49] the only difference is is the
[1:20:52] characteristics of it
[1:20:55] no the one on the left hand and the one
[1:20:59] on the right hand that's the only
[1:21:01] difference so they're the same number if
[1:21:03] they're just turned different right
[1:21:05] that's the way the spirit will be in the
[1:21:10] last days
[1:21:13] they will just the characteristics of it
[1:21:17] will detect whether it's God or not
[1:21:21] one of them will be right
[1:21:23] and the other will be wrong
[1:21:26] and you'll only know it by the
[1:21:28] characteristics of God
[1:21:31] just perfectly it'll have to be that way
[1:21:35] the right hand
[1:21:38] would say it's right in the left was
[1:21:42] wrong see or vice versa one of them is
[1:21:46] determined by their characteristics you
[1:21:48] can only know it by their
[1:21:50] characteristics see they get so close
[1:21:54] right that you fall into the Trap of
[1:21:58] their personality their people people
[1:22:02] you know people you love and and if
[1:22:06] they're wrong they're wrong
[1:22:09] you can't defend it
[1:22:14] you can't explain it
[1:22:16] you can't make it fit
[1:22:19] you can't trim the puzzle piece
[1:22:23] it's God's puzzle
[1:22:26] he's going to put in there who he puts
[1:22:28] in there
[1:22:30] I'm not the maker of the puzzle
[1:22:33] I don't have to worry where the other
[1:22:36] pieces go I've got to make sure that I
[1:22:40] fit
[1:22:43] the spot that he spoke for me and that
[1:22:47] my characteristics match up to the
[1:22:50] characteristics of the spot that he
[1:22:52] wants me
[1:22:56] um
[1:22:57] he says you'll know it by its
[1:23:00] characteristics and and that is a
[1:23:05] uh just such a wonderful a thing there's
[1:23:08] so much more in that message uh but so
[1:23:12] it this morning one of the issues
[1:23:15] that the prophet of God brings up as
[1:23:19] we'll read it
[1:23:21] here
[1:23:23] uh
[1:23:24] see if I can find it
[1:23:32] he says today
[1:23:34] so much confusion about the evidence of
[1:23:38] the Holy Spirit and so forth
[1:23:42] one of the greatest confusions that our
[1:23:46] young people have and people have is the
[1:23:49] terminology borned again
[1:23:53] you must be born again
[1:23:57] well you can be living like the best you
[1:24:00] can live
[1:24:01] and then you get in a sermon and they're
[1:24:03] going to say you must be born again and
[1:24:06] the first thing you're going to ask am I
[1:24:08] Born Again am I Born depend am I Born
[1:24:12] Again
[1:24:13] so how can you identify
[1:24:17] whether somebody's born again or not
[1:24:23] it's got to be by characteristic
[1:24:27] now
[1:24:31] not by mistakes or no mistakes that's
[1:24:34] not the characteristic they're so close
[1:24:37] it would deceive the very elect
[1:24:41] now remember I'm just laying that
[1:24:43] Prelude because when we listen to our
[1:24:45] messenger talk it's only 25 minutes if
[1:24:49] it's just the start you can go home and
[1:24:51] finish the rest of it we'll touch on it
[1:24:54] here here and there
[1:24:56] but when you begin to understand
[1:24:59] what it means to be born again
[1:25:03] the birth is not the results the burst
[1:25:07] the baby
[1:25:13] I've seen some awful small babies
[1:25:16] that have grown into some awfully
[1:25:19] beautiful people
[1:25:23] I have two in mind
[1:25:25] Kayla Bill who's a giant
[1:25:28] he weighed like two pounds eight ounces
[1:25:31] or something
[1:25:34] and I don't mean to embarrass Natalie
[1:25:36] but she was uh
[1:25:38] very teeny baby
[1:25:41] and she's I think she's as tall as you
[1:25:44] isn't she like she's getting close
[1:25:48] the purse the baby
[1:25:56] and I want to just give
[1:25:58] a definition if I could say it
[1:26:03] to be borned again
[1:26:06] there's got to be something in there
[1:26:09] first
[1:26:12] okay to be born again
[1:26:16] is
[1:26:18] is having the predestinated germ seed
[1:26:23] that's in there
[1:26:25] quickened to live
[1:26:28] and grow to its predestinated end
[1:26:32] oh yeah
[1:26:35] that look like what does it mean to be
[1:26:37] born again
[1:26:40] now this is great paradox
[1:26:44] I I like how the whole thing just
[1:26:47] weren't I thought that's right down my
[1:26:48] line that almost came up and sat in the
[1:26:51] Pew and said keep going
[1:26:55] we we get in that question
[1:26:58] because we don't know how to identify
[1:27:01] the characteristic of the birth
[1:27:06] is constantly the what the word
[1:27:10] the word the word
[1:27:15] when it comes to that word
[1:27:20] just like King David just like many
[1:27:23] other people in the scripture when it
[1:27:26] came to that word despite their
[1:27:28] condition despite what they had done
[1:27:31] despite what they'd been through when it
[1:27:34] came to that word that part inside of
[1:27:37] them said that word is right I'm wrong
[1:27:42] I'm in sin I have failed but that word
[1:27:46] is true
[1:27:49] am I because that had been brought to
[1:27:53] life in them
[1:27:54] by the spirit of God
[1:28:00] remember
[1:28:01] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[1:28:07] spirit is not a second person it's not a
[1:28:10] third person it it's it it it it it is
[1:28:15] God in action
[1:28:20] the scripture even says the spirit of
[1:28:22] God didn't come to speak of itself
[1:28:25] but to bring you into remembrance of all
[1:28:28] the things which I've taught you
[1:28:33] look America you you
[1:28:36] are brought to life
[1:28:38] by life
[1:28:40] your birth
[1:28:43] no I can't get into all the things of
[1:28:46] who's false and who isn't that's not
[1:28:48] given but you personally have got to
[1:28:51] come to the place the evidence of the
[1:28:54] holy spirit is Jesus Christ revealed to
[1:28:57] you personally
[1:29:00] that's right
[1:29:04] in fact you know you're wrong because
[1:29:06] the spirit convicts you of sin
[1:29:11] what do you do you don't get reborned
[1:29:14] again
[1:29:17] you say I'm wrong
[1:29:19] I'm sorry
[1:29:21] Lord help me
[1:29:24] but if you're his child you were birthed
[1:29:27] his child your name was written on the
[1:29:30] Lamb's Book of Life that germ seed was
[1:29:33] in you and the spirit of God comes
[1:29:36] through the preaching of the gospel and
[1:29:39] awakens that Revelation to you that that
[1:29:44] word is in you
[1:29:46] and now you're on a journey
[1:29:49] and every day on that Journey Satan's
[1:29:52] going to tell you you're not born again
[1:29:54] you're not his you got stink and flesh
[1:29:57] you're no good you can't do it you can't
[1:30:00] make it you did this you did that but a
[1:30:04] stabilized person knows
[1:30:08] if he planted it he'll finish it
[1:30:14] because the word of God cannot return
[1:30:17] void
[1:30:22] now I might have to go through some
[1:30:24] changes
[1:30:26] I might have to overcome some fears I
[1:30:30] might have to overcome some doubts
[1:30:35] that's why it's given to the overcomer
[1:30:40] but he also said all the father hath
[1:30:43] given he will come and nothing can
[1:30:46] plucked them out of the palm of my hand
[1:30:48] amen word
[1:30:51] word
[1:30:52] word
[1:30:54] it's always the word so as we listen
[1:31:01] you'll
[1:31:03] hear statements like
[1:31:06] so God and Sunday Times a diverse manner
[1:31:09] spake we won't listen to this but I want
[1:31:11] to read this just right before we play
[1:31:13] this is paragraph number 107. uh brother
[1:31:18] Mike if you want to put that up there
[1:31:21] and and read this before we listened
[1:31:24] this morning
[1:31:25] you'll you understand my purpose this
[1:31:28] morning
[1:31:29] there's a lot of confusion
[1:31:33] there's a lot of voices
[1:31:36] there's a lot of spirits a lot of
[1:31:38] anointings many people come into contact
[1:31:40] with places and they leave with the
[1:31:42] feeling
[1:31:44] they've got something
[1:31:47] we've got something you don't got
[1:31:50] right oh my answer to that is we got
[1:31:52] something we want you to have
[1:31:59] the only thing the believer wants is the
[1:32:01] word
[1:32:05] the only place you're going to find the
[1:32:07] word is in the word
[1:32:09] the word is in the promised word of the
[1:32:12] hour
[1:32:14] so this is what he says in this
[1:32:16] paragraph
[1:32:17] he says God took his own fingers and
[1:32:21] wrote on the sand one day and spoke he
[1:32:24] preached he prophesied with his own lips
[1:32:28] God did
[1:32:29] when he was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:32:33] Us
[1:32:34] God manifested in flesh
[1:32:38] if he can write speak
[1:32:40] can he also tell others what to do
[1:32:44] certainly can he can talk to them in the
[1:32:49] human voice he can write and show them
[1:32:52] what to do he has done it
[1:32:56] so God in sun-dried times in diverse
[1:33:00] manners speak to the fathers through the
[1:33:03] prophets
[1:33:04] and he said as it is written that not
[1:33:07] one jot or
[1:33:10] Tittle shall pass away until it's
[1:33:13] fulfilled
[1:33:15] and then it's manifested then it will
[1:33:18] pass because it's manifested it can't
[1:33:22] pass then but just the word itself is
[1:33:26] made flesh
[1:33:28] jot means small word Tittle means small
[1:33:32] Mark not even one punctuation one
[1:33:37] expression anything shall ever fail in
[1:33:41] the word of God it can't fail
[1:33:44] because it's God manifested in the form
[1:33:47] of human flesh for it's God himself in
[1:33:51] letter form
[1:33:53] Prophet form
[1:33:54] manifested in flesh
[1:33:57] now that's the reason Jesus said
[1:34:00] the ones who spoke to you you call them
[1:34:03] Gods all gods if it's on the board
[1:34:07] who spoke to you by the word of God said
[1:34:11] and they were Gods those prophets when
[1:34:14] they were Anointed with the spirit of
[1:34:16] God they brought exactly the word of God
[1:34:22] then they were Gods it was God's word
[1:34:26] speaking through them
[1:34:31] thank you bring it over
[1:34:37] bring it over
[1:34:40] you have a prophet
[1:34:42] a Vindicated Prophet who was it speaking
[1:34:48] it was God
[1:34:50] speaking
[1:34:52] you want to be stabilized
[1:34:56] know who's speaking
[1:35:01] we don't need second-hand revelation
[1:35:08] that that's where the stabilization
[1:35:12] gets broke down
[1:35:16] people say things
[1:35:18] and it's it appears spiritual
[1:35:22] it it appears anointed
[1:35:26] it appears wonderful
[1:35:28] it feels great
[1:35:34] not how you identify it
[1:35:38] God's identified by his what
[1:35:41] his word
[1:35:46] that's why when you make a statement
[1:35:49] and it's in this next 25 minutes you'll
[1:35:53] we'll close with the plane of the tape
[1:35:57] you will understand anointed once at the
[1:36:00] end time you'll understand all those
[1:36:02] things it gets back
[1:36:06] to The Germ seed that's in you
[1:36:10] and
[1:36:12] its connection
[1:36:14] to the voice of God
[1:36:22] it's personal connection to the voice of
[1:36:27] God
[1:36:31] can God speak to you yes will he speak
[1:36:34] to you contrary to his word no
[1:36:41] a woman could come say God told me to
[1:36:43] preach
[1:36:44] Prophet God said well I'm not saying he
[1:36:47] didn't
[1:36:48] but it's contrary to his word
[1:36:54] if he told you to preach it's just to go
[1:36:56] out and deceive everybody he's going to
[1:36:58] listen to you
[1:37:01] but it's not the word it's not the word
[1:37:06] the only thing that stabilizes the
[1:37:09] believer is the word
[1:37:15] the word the word may manifest
[1:37:18] and we're just reading here
[1:37:23] he said in those prophets when they were
[1:37:26] Anointed with the spirit of God any
[1:37:28] bread he brought exactly the word of God
[1:37:30] then they were Gods it was God speaking
[1:37:33] through them
[1:37:35] the only they only interpreted as God
[1:37:39] would permit them to interpret
[1:37:43] now if you want to find that it's second
[1:37:46] Peter 1 and 20 and 21. all right because
[1:37:50] this were God's there's no private
[1:37:54] interpretation he does his own
[1:37:57] interpreting
[1:37:58] God speaks
[1:38:01] and interprets it himself
[1:38:04] then reveals it to whomsoever he will
[1:38:10] hides from all others
[1:38:19] he don't have to reveal it to anybody
[1:38:23] unless he wants to
[1:38:29] and he don't he he has expressed his
[1:38:34] whole thing in the scriptures
[1:38:37] therefore the whole thing is already
[1:38:41] made known
[1:38:44] it it's just he's just sitting there
[1:38:48] watching it happen see just seen the
[1:38:54] body be made and come back to its to the
[1:39:00] form his bride
[1:39:03] again
[1:39:05] I like that
[1:39:07] so this morning as we talked about it I
[1:39:10] want you to catch a couple notations
[1:39:13] that he's going to make
[1:39:15] he says if you took the wheat seed
[1:39:21] the heart and put it in a cuckleber
[1:39:25] and planted it
[1:39:28] it would come wheat
[1:39:32] now you say why because I feel that God
[1:39:36] planted a wheat seed in a cuckoo bird
[1:39:40] right
[1:39:42] but it was predestinated
[1:39:45] the wheat seed
[1:39:47] so I guess you listen this morning
[1:39:49] prophet of God's going to talk about
[1:39:50] gifts he's going to talk about
[1:39:52] anointings he's going to talk about a
[1:39:55] lot of things in this 25 minute but he's
[1:39:58] going to bring you back to the one thing
[1:40:03] that stabilizes the believer
[1:40:06] and it's the word
[1:40:15] it's this
[1:40:18] made flesh in our day is the word for
[1:40:23] our day God bless you let's just listen
[1:40:26] he's gonna if you have your Bibles open
[1:40:29] to Hebrews the first chapter
[1:40:33] and what we'll do is we'll stand as the
[1:40:36] prophet of God reads Hebrews 1 I believe
[1:40:39] one through three and then when he's
[1:40:41] done we'll sit down and listen to 25
[1:40:44] minutes God bless you
[1:40:50] now we want to get ready and speak now
[1:40:55] on a little subject here that I chose
[1:40:58] for this morning by the help of the Lord
[1:41:00] and we'll speak just as briefly as he
[1:41:03] can because the hookup of the people I
[1:41:05] hope you all got a all across the nation
[1:41:07] got a fine morning like we have here in
[1:41:09] Indiana nice cool fine weather we're
[1:41:12] having now since the rain and it's very
[1:41:14] fine
[1:41:15] now
[1:41:17] I want to read from the book of Hebrews
[1:41:19] the first chapter and from the book of
[1:41:22] Saint John the first chapter Hebrews 1
[1:41:25] 1-3 and Saint John 1 1 for a text
[1:41:32] my subject this morning is a study in
[1:41:34] the scriptures now
[1:41:37] let's read Hebrews 1 1 God who at sundra
[1:41:41] times divers manners fake in times past
[1:41:45] unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:41:48] but in these last days spoken to us by
[1:41:51] his son
[1:41:52] who he has appointed heir of all things
[1:41:55] but whom also he made the world
[1:42:01] through being in the brightness of his
[1:42:03] glory and expressed image of his person
[1:42:06] and upholding All Things by the word of
[1:42:10] his power
[1:42:12] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:42:15] set down on the right hand of the
[1:42:19] Majesty on high
[1:42:21] what a beautiful reading
[1:42:24] now Saint John 1 1. in the beginning was
[1:42:29] the word
[1:42:31] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:42:35] was God
[1:42:38] now
[1:42:39] and
[1:42:41] my
[1:42:43] uh text this morning is Christ is
[1:42:47] revealed in his own word
[1:42:50] now where I come to the conclusion to
[1:42:53] talk on this was because
[1:42:56] that uh knowing that what we say we
[1:43:01] mustn't just say because we're gathered
[1:43:04] together to just haphazardly speak on
[1:43:07] anything but it's something that will
[1:43:09] help stabilize the people
[1:43:12] for uh we are going to pass through
[1:43:17] dangerous stretches Waters
[1:43:20] we're already sailing through them
[1:43:23] and sometimes I guess it's with you like
[1:43:25] it is with me that seems like that so
[1:43:29] much of it is such a scary eye just
[1:43:32] talking to a young Minister and his wife
[1:43:34] in the room just a few moments ago
[1:43:37] and
[1:43:38] both of them are nervous just like the
[1:43:41] rest of the world rest of the human
[1:43:43] beings on Earth
[1:43:45] I said remember Satan's got a Punch
[1:43:48] coming at you I don't care who you are
[1:43:51] God he's got to write for that one punch
[1:43:54] which had your rather be that punch be
[1:43:56] blind
[1:43:58] or be an arthritic sitting in a chair or
[1:44:00] be nervous think he's got somewhere he
[1:44:03] could punch him he's got a right to that
[1:44:05] open place now that's the spots you got
[1:44:07] to keep covered all the time
[1:44:09] and to see this nervous age that we're
[1:44:12] living in and last week's tapes I think
[1:44:15] will reveal to you the great hideous
[1:44:18] things that we're going to speak on one
[1:44:21] of these days when we could get a place
[1:44:23] sufficient all the opening of those uh
[1:44:27] last plagues to be poured out upon the
[1:44:30] Earth those vows rather pouring out of
[1:44:32] the vials and the Seven Thunders and
[1:44:34] those hideous
[1:44:36] sites is coming up on the Earth
[1:44:39] man I now and people today are in such
[1:44:43] an erotic condition
[1:44:45] the whole world you read this last
[1:44:48] month's Reader's Digest
[1:44:50] you'll notice the subject ads on Billy
[1:44:52] Graham the great evangelist he got so
[1:44:56] tired he just couldn't hold his meetings
[1:44:58] and he he went to Mayo's clinic for a
[1:45:00] physical checkup well nothing wrong with
[1:45:02] him only
[1:45:03] it just doesn't do enough work
[1:45:07] and they put him to run in physical
[1:45:10] uh exercise he runs a mile every day
[1:45:14] then the article goes on to say that
[1:45:17] science has proved
[1:45:19] that today that young children
[1:45:22] these little boys and girls hit their
[1:45:24] middle age at 20 years old
[1:45:27] and by 25 many times in many cases your
[1:45:31] girls are out of menopause
[1:45:33] at 25 years old
[1:45:35] I don't know if you knew it or not but a
[1:45:37] few nights ago while the Holy Spirit was
[1:45:39] speaking here in the meeting a little
[1:45:41] girl sitting down here that's exactly
[1:45:43] what was wrong with that child when he
[1:45:44] called out I looked at her a second time
[1:45:46] looked again and I seen what was the
[1:45:49] matter I thought it can't be that
[1:45:50] child's too young but it was
[1:45:52] menopause about 20 years old 23
[1:45:55] something like that
[1:45:57] see my mother and your mother struck
[1:46:00] that age about 45 to 50. my wife struck
[1:46:03] that age about 35. now it's down to 20.
[1:46:07] the whole human race is rotten
[1:46:11] well if them physical beings of our body
[1:46:14] is tearing down like that from eating
[1:46:17] hybrid Foods pensions
[1:46:20] as rotten it does not that also rot the
[1:46:24] brain cell
[1:46:25] then we can see how women can get on the
[1:46:28] street naked
[1:46:30] we can see how they can speed through
[1:46:33] the uh the streets at 120 miles an hour
[1:46:38] all these things it's come to a place
[1:46:40] where the whole nation whole world not
[1:46:43] only this nation but everywhere
[1:46:46] mentally gone
[1:46:49] and then when we opened up those the
[1:46:51] Lord willing on those seven vials that
[1:46:54] show those hideous things man will be so
[1:46:56] insane after a while to you imagine
[1:46:58] they're seeing ants the size of a
[1:47:00] mountain
[1:47:01] it'd be tormenting women be locusts come
[1:47:04] upon the earth a long hair to torment
[1:47:06] women who cut theirs off hair like women
[1:47:09] hanging out in long teeth like a lion
[1:47:11] Stingers in their tail like a scarf and
[1:47:14] and so forth the torment man upon the
[1:47:16] Earth but then it'll be too late to do
[1:47:19] anything about it
[1:47:20] you get right now
[1:47:23] Harmony
[1:47:25] and last Sunday when we was going into
[1:47:27] those Cycles
[1:47:28] about how that the five senses on the
[1:47:32] Outer Rim
[1:47:34] that's the inlet five senses to the body
[1:47:36] there's only one way you can get into
[1:47:38] the body that's for those five senses
[1:47:40] see tastes feel smell in here there's no
[1:47:42] other way to contact the the body
[1:47:44] on the inside of that man is the man
[1:47:46] called spirit
[1:47:48] and he has five senses think thought and
[1:47:52] uh thought and love and conscience and
[1:47:54] so forth all right now you can't think
[1:47:57] with your body you think with your mind
[1:48:00] and in there it's where
[1:48:03] too many of Christians only stop
[1:48:07] and they can just like the corn in the
[1:48:10] field and the weed in the field they can
[1:48:12] be Anointed with the same holy spirit
[1:48:14] that the real Believers Anointed with
[1:48:17] but down on the inside of that next Rim
[1:48:21] the third Rim is the soul
[1:48:25] and that's predestinated by God there's
[1:48:28] where the real sea germ lays is in there
[1:48:33] and remember
[1:48:34] if I take a of Burr and cut it open
[1:48:37] draft into it the heart of a of a wheat
[1:48:40] and put it there
[1:48:42] period it would bring forth a wheat
[1:48:46] out of the cocklebur
[1:48:49] no matter what the outside is what the
[1:48:51] emotions today so confused about the
[1:48:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost and so forth
[1:48:55] Satan can impersonate any kind of gift
[1:48:57] that God's Got
[1:48:58] it but he cannot bring that word word by
[1:49:03] word
[1:49:04] that's where he failed in the Garden of
[1:49:06] Eden that's where he's always failed
[1:49:07] that's where them the tape on false
[1:49:09] anointed ones are naughty ones they can
[1:49:12] be Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:49:13] tongues thanks shout preach the gospel
[1:49:15] and steal the devil
[1:49:18] it's the inside
[1:49:20] I remember
[1:49:22] Jesus said all the father has given me
[1:49:25] will come to me no man could come except
[1:49:28] my father draws him first
[1:49:30] now we take it through the lesson to
[1:49:32] show that in you were in your great
[1:49:36] great great grandfather all the way back
[1:49:38] physically speaking
[1:49:40] then
[1:49:42] that's what you are in physical being
[1:49:44] natured sometimes a child will be born a
[1:49:47] family redheaded
[1:49:49] it astonishes the father causes nobody
[1:49:51] he knows of his people read it or the
[1:49:53] mothers
[1:49:54] but if you go way back to several
[1:49:56] Generations you'll find out somebody was
[1:49:58] redheaded
[1:49:59] that seed keeps coming on down
[1:50:02] and you come the nature of one from way
[1:50:04] back like as Hebrews the seventh chapter
[1:50:08] said that Melchizedek
[1:50:11] Abraham paid tithes to him when he's
[1:50:13] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:50:15] Kings and Levi who received highest paid
[1:50:19] tithes for he was in the loins of
[1:50:21] Melchizedek at are The Lawns of Abraham
[1:50:24] rather when he met Melchizedek now
[1:50:27] the same thing as this
[1:50:29] if you are a son of God and if I am a
[1:50:34] Son of God or a daughter of God we were
[1:50:36] in God at the beginning
[1:50:40] and when Jesus became the fullest of the
[1:50:43] word
[1:50:45] then we were in him germ Farm
[1:50:49] when he was crucified we was crucified
[1:50:52] in his body
[1:50:54] when he rose from the dead we rose with
[1:50:57] him and now since we have recognized it
[1:51:00] now we sit together with him in Heavenly
[1:51:03] places in Christ Jesus
[1:51:07] for he we if we are Sons and Daughters
[1:51:11] of God we are God's children
[1:51:15] then we are attributes of God then we
[1:51:17] were God eternal life and God is the
[1:51:20] only eternal life there is then we were
[1:51:22] in him from the beginning
[1:51:25] and when Jesus became all that word then
[1:51:29] we were part of him then
[1:51:32] amen there you are that's in there
[1:51:35] there's no devil no powers no nothing
[1:51:37] can ever move it that's the top post of
[1:51:40] the soul you can be anointed out here in
[1:51:41] this spirit and desire and do all these
[1:51:43] other things but when it comes to this
[1:51:45] top post to that word you'll never move
[1:51:47] from that a whole right studying true to
[1:51:50] that word as it can be
[1:51:51] outside of that regard so watch you do
[1:51:53] you're still lost
[1:51:56] that lady of seeing churches naked blind
[1:51:58] miserable don't even know it
[1:52:01] anointed Anointed with the real Spirit
[1:52:03] see that Holy Spirit can fall upon a man
[1:52:07] in his spirit
[1:52:10] but his soul is his germ
[1:52:13] that germ is the word
[1:52:16] they
[1:52:18] and how I don't care how much you preach
[1:52:20] how well you do this and how much you
[1:52:22] love that's one of the inlets the spirit
[1:52:24] you can't love with your body you love
[1:52:26] with your spirit
[1:52:28] that's one of the inlets and you can
[1:52:29] love and even love God still not be
[1:52:32] right
[1:52:33] you cast out devils and Priests and do
[1:52:35] these things still not be right Jesus
[1:52:37] said so that many would come in that day
[1:52:40] that word settles him in the beginning
[1:52:43] was the word
[1:52:45] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:52:48] was God and the word became flesh and
[1:52:51] dwelled Among Us
[1:52:52] notice
[1:52:53] I'm going to speak on this subject of
[1:52:56] the Bible of Christ revealed in his own
[1:52:59] word where I draw of this conclusion is
[1:53:01] in my room some dear person may be
[1:53:03] sitting here this morning
[1:53:04] I got a picture hanging in my study up
[1:53:06] there
[1:53:07] that's a picture of Hoffman's head of
[1:53:10] Christ wrote in the Beatitudes and right
[1:53:13] where you would come the place I can eat
[1:53:15] a part of the hair they press a little
[1:53:17] harder on the pen as you pass that part
[1:53:19] there he is setting in his word looking
[1:53:21] right out
[1:53:22] Christ into Beatitudes someone ever who
[1:53:25] it was a thank you part somebody brought
[1:53:28] that picture in put up a study there of
[1:53:30] Elijah going up in a chair to fire we
[1:53:32] appreciate these things many times big
[1:53:34] crowds I just don't get a chance to
[1:53:36] speak and say these things but I see it
[1:53:38] brother sister I I know it God knows it
[1:53:41] now I'm going to speak on this subject
[1:53:44] of Christ revealed in his own word how
[1:53:47] in the Beatitudes there stands a picture
[1:53:49] of Christ standing right out like that's
[1:53:52] where I thought of this subject
[1:53:54] uh Christ and the word is the same
[1:53:59] see you say how was the Bible people
[1:54:02] says us riding with a man not long ago
[1:54:05] he said think of it
[1:54:07] we here on this Earth the way we are and
[1:54:09] we only know or can only say that we're
[1:54:13] saved by some Jewish fable
[1:54:16] call the Bible
[1:54:17] I said sir
[1:54:19] I don't know how you say that but I
[1:54:21] don't believe it's a Jewish fable
[1:54:24] I said he said well you pray what do you
[1:54:26] pray to I ask for so and so on certain
[1:54:29] things I didn't get it I said you pray
[1:54:31] wrong
[1:54:32] we should never pray to change God's
[1:54:35] mind
[1:54:37] we should pray to change our mind God's
[1:54:40] mind don't need any changes
[1:54:43] it's right
[1:54:45] I said now what You Prayed For unto a
[1:54:47] young Catholic boy one time has had a
[1:54:49] prayer book saying prayers for his
[1:54:50] mother to live and she died and he sold
[1:54:52] a prayer book in the fire well see
[1:54:55] I don't go for the prayer book but
[1:54:58] anyhow see you take the wrong attitude
[1:55:01] you're trying to tell God what to do
[1:55:04] prayer should be Lord change me
[1:55:07] to fit your word
[1:55:09] not change
[1:55:11] uh not let me change your mind
[1:55:14] you change my mind you changed my mind
[1:55:18] to your will
[1:55:19] and your will is written here in the
[1:55:21] book
[1:55:22] Lord don't don't let me go till you got
[1:55:24] my my mindset it's like you're mine then
[1:55:27] when my mind is set like your mind then
[1:55:29] I'll leave every word you wrote
[1:55:31] and you said in there you make
[1:55:33] everything work together for good to
[1:55:34] them it loves you and I love you lord
[1:55:36] it's all working together for the good
[1:55:39] I've been this week down the country
[1:55:41] stand with some very dear friends I
[1:55:42] asked some of them at the table
[1:55:43] yesterday when I was eating we always
[1:55:45] sat around have a little like a little
[1:55:47] study on the Bible let's talk about love
[1:55:50] there's a certain person said to me said
[1:55:52] I believe you're an antichrist I said if
[1:55:55] that would be pleasing to my Lord that's
[1:55:57] what I want to be
[1:55:59] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[1:56:03] I love him if he should cast me into
[1:56:05] hell
[1:56:06] are still up we're loving if I go with
[1:56:09] the same spirit I have now
[1:56:11] you looked at me kind of strange I've
[1:56:12] seen four or five of them there a young
[1:56:14] man
[1:56:15] young wives fine women I know how their
[1:56:18] boys love their wives so I said to them
[1:56:20] I said here's the way to test it
[1:56:22] if your wife before you were married now
[1:56:25] you go back say you this married life
[1:56:27] you've been dreaming you were married
[1:56:30] you really wasn't married but you
[1:56:31] dreamed you were and you woke up and you
[1:56:34] went and talked towards your girlfriend
[1:56:35] and said you know what I dream that we
[1:56:37] were married we had children we living
[1:56:39] happy and waiting for the coming of the
[1:56:41] Lord and everything and then this girl
[1:56:42] would say to you
[1:56:44] you know I love another man
[1:56:47] better than I love you I could be
[1:56:49] happier with the other man could you
[1:56:52] from your heart
[1:56:54] love her well enough
[1:56:56] say God's blessings rest upon you my
[1:56:59] dear
[1:57:00] go with this other man
[1:57:03] now now check that each of you man
[1:57:06] are you women
[1:57:08] see
[1:57:09] well if your love is correct
[1:57:13] you would do that
[1:57:15] for you are interested in her welfare
[1:57:19] what you know you could have her you can
[1:57:21] live with her yes she's your wife she
[1:57:23] will be she'll marry you but she won't
[1:57:25] be happy
[1:57:27] she'd be happier and then if you love
[1:57:29] her then you want her to be happy
[1:57:32] therefore whatever the will of God is
[1:57:35] that God's will be done whether I'm
[1:57:37] happy with it or not
[1:57:40] I want to live so he will be pleased
[1:57:45] with what I do therefore Checker your
[1:57:49] objective and your motive by that you
[1:57:50] know where you love God or not what if
[1:57:52] he'd say uh are you serving me if I'm
[1:57:54] going to cast you away I love you anyhow
[1:57:58] therefore if the churches would see that
[1:58:01] and could believe it in that manner it
[1:58:04] wouldn't be one trying to jerk the
[1:58:06] football away from the other fellow when
[1:58:07] he's running with it he'd be protecting
[1:58:09] that one
[1:58:10] when real true motive and objectives
[1:58:14] with me one try and say hey I got this
[1:58:16] too uh this is me and this see God can't
[1:58:18] use a man
[1:58:19] so much impersonation follows it and
[1:58:22] that's Satan and the people can't
[1:58:23] realize that you're trying to take the
[1:58:26] ball from somebody's been given let God
[1:58:28] raise up a certain Ministry and watch
[1:58:29] how many goes after him okay see now
[1:58:33] genuine love for God no matter what part
[1:58:35] I Am Lord if I can only say a word for
[1:58:37] it help protect you let me do that
[1:58:41] that's the same thing would be about
[1:58:43] your wife
[1:58:44] if you really love her
[1:58:47] see it's not a it's not a a filial love
[1:58:50] it's an agopal love
[1:58:52] a genuine love
[1:58:54] she could live with somebody else
[1:58:56] happier
[1:58:57] you're not married now of course you
[1:58:59] can't evaluate people listen to these
[1:59:01] tapes some so many sins and said well in
[1:59:04] the marriage of divorce you said this
[1:59:06] and you said that
[1:59:07] I've said that so many times these tapes
[1:59:11] goes only I'm speaking to my
[1:59:14] congregation brother I'm not responsible
[1:59:18] for what God gave you to Shepherd I'm
[1:59:19] responsible for what kind of food I feed
[1:59:22] these people
[1:59:23] this is for this Tabernacle only
[1:59:26] see now if the people want to listen to
[1:59:28] their tapes that's up to them but I'm
[1:59:31] speaking to what God has given to me it
[1:59:34] was their sins that was omitted someone
[1:59:36] wrote out said well I've done this and
[1:59:38] I've done that you said our sins I I
[1:59:40] didn't say that I said see it to this
[1:59:43] this is only to this people right here
[1:59:47] the people here in the Tabernacle my own
[1:59:50] flower
[1:59:51] now people want to hybrid food and stuff
[1:59:54] not there you you get the Revelation
[1:59:56] from God do what God tells you to do
[1:59:58] I'll do the same thing but these
[2:00:00] messages are to this church
[2:00:03] notice how we come back we've got to
[2:00:06] have something another that we have to
[2:00:08] hold on to
[2:00:10] something has to be a time folks
[2:00:13] in other words it's an ultimate
[2:00:16] and everyone must have an ultimate
[2:00:20] or an absolute I've preached on it one
[2:00:22] time years ago on an absolute a place
[2:00:25] that's the last word like the Umpire at
[2:00:28] a ball game if he says it's a strike
[2:00:30] that's just exactly what it is no matter
[2:00:32] how you've seen it the Umpire said it's
[2:00:35] a strike
[2:00:36] you said I I it wasn't a strike it went
[2:00:38] I see the no matter what it is when he
[2:00:41] said strike that's it that's settled
[2:00:44] he's the ultimate
[2:00:46] and the traffic light is an alternate if
[2:00:49] it says go uh you say well I I'm in a
[2:00:52] hurry I got no uh it says you stand
[2:00:55] still while the other fellow goes
[2:00:57] it's the ultimate now there's got to be
[2:01:00] an ultimate to everything you do there
[2:01:03] had to be an ultimate when you chose
[2:01:04] your wife
[2:01:06] there'd be a woman you had to select
[2:01:09] now there has to be a time where you're
[2:01:11] going to buy a car what kind of an
[2:01:12] ultimate you're going to make will be
[2:01:14] Ford Chevy Plymouth Park car whatever it
[2:01:16] is you got to have an Alderman
[2:01:18] and so is it with Christian Living
[2:01:21] there's got to be an ultimate now if a
[2:01:25] man said went to another man and said
[2:01:27] heard somebody say well you should be
[2:01:29] baptized and this fellow never maybe he
[2:01:32] is some church he didn't baptize it just
[2:01:34] sprinkled
[2:01:36] I think say Francis is the Methodist
[2:01:38] they do baptize if it's requested I
[2:01:40] understand
[2:01:42] or maybe the a Catholic I think they
[2:01:45] sprinkle only
[2:01:46] so then if if a man heard something
[2:01:48] about being immersed in the water
[2:01:52] but he didn't understand that he's
[2:01:53] raised Catholic so he goes up to the
[2:01:55] priest and said the father uh I
[2:01:58] understand that we're supposed to be
[2:01:59] baptized by any Mercy what does our
[2:02:02] church say about that why it says we're
[2:02:04] to be sprinkled that that church is his
[2:02:06] ultimate that settled it oh Strife is
[2:02:09] over the church said so and that's all
[2:02:12] what if the if the Baptist brother heard
[2:02:16] us say that we believe in being baptized
[2:02:18] by Mercy he said I believe that and in
[2:02:20] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:02:22] yeah this this member of the church goes
[2:02:25] back to the pastor says Pastor I heard a
[2:02:28] fellow say to me that we should be
[2:02:30] baptized by immersing all right but in
[2:02:32] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:02:34] well he said now let us see why here the
[2:02:37] book says that we're to be baptized
[2:02:39] using father son Holy Ghost if that
[2:02:42] church is the ultimate that settles it
[2:02:44] you don't care about what anything else
[2:02:46] says that's his ultimate
[2:02:49] whatever denomination is an ultimate to
[2:02:52] their believers
[2:02:54] but to me
[2:02:56] and to the ones that I hope that I'm
[2:02:59] leading to Christ and by Christ
[2:03:03] the Bible is our ultimate
[2:03:05] no matter of course God said that every
[2:03:08] man's word be a line mine truth
[2:03:11] and I believe that the Bible is God's
[2:03:14] ultimate
[2:03:16] no matter what anyone else says it's the
[2:03:19] ultimate the Bible is not
[2:03:22] a book of systems
[2:03:24] no sir it is not a book of systems nor a
[2:03:29] code of morals
[2:03:31] the Bible is not a book of systems so
[2:03:34] many systems and so forth no sir it is
[2:03:36] not a book of morals no sir it is not
[2:03:39] nor is it a book of History altogether
[2:03:42] or neither is it a book of theology
[2:03:46] or it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:03:51] now if you'd like to read that you who
[2:03:53] have your papers marking it down that's
[2:03:56] Revelations 1 1-3
[2:03:58] is the Bible is the revelation
[2:04:03] of Jesus Christ let us just read it
[2:04:06] while we got time I believe I haven't
[2:04:09] got too many notes here to speak from if
[2:04:11] the Lord
[2:04:12] Teresa we'll try to get from them the
[2:04:16] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[2:04:18] gave to him to show to his servant
[2:04:21] Saints which must shortly come to pass
[2:04:23] and he said and signified by his Angel
[2:04:28] to his servant John who bear record of
[2:04:32] the word of God and the testimony of
[2:04:34] Jesus Christ and of all things that he
[2:04:37] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[2:04:40] that you're the word of this prophecy
[2:04:43] and keep the things which are written
[2:04:45] therein for the time is at hand
[2:04:49] so the Bible is the complete revelation
[2:04:54] of Jesus Christ
[2:04:55] and it was wrote by Prophets
[2:05:00] Hebrews 1 1 in God who in sunrise times
[2:05:06] speak to the fathers by the prophets
[2:05:10] in this last day
[2:05:13] speaks to us through his son Jesus
[2:05:15] Christ which was the prophets all of
[2:05:19] them put together
[2:05:22] Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah
[2:05:28] Isaiah Elijah all that they were
[2:05:33] worrying him
[2:05:34] and all that you are all I am is in him
[2:05:40] words Witnesses of the word
[2:05:44] so it is not a book of systems a code of
[2:05:47] moral ethics neither is it a history
[2:05:49] book or a book of theology
[2:05:52] it is not but it's a revelation
[2:05:56] of Jesus Christ
[2:05:58] God himself revealed from word to flesh
[2:06:05] that's what it is the Bible is the word
[2:06:09] and God is the flesh
[2:06:11] God in God is the word brother and Jesus
[2:06:14] being the flesh it's a revelation out of
[2:06:17] God the word was manifested in human
[2:06:20] flesh and revealed to us and that's why
[2:06:22] he becomes a son of God
[2:06:26] he is a part of God
[2:06:30] you understand now he is not the body
[2:06:35] is part of God so much that it's a son
[2:06:43] you can all go home and finish
[2:06:46] and then come back tonight
[2:06:49] and you'll be stabilized
[2:06:53] you understand what he's
[2:06:55] that what he's saying
[2:06:58] is so easy for us to go with anointing
[2:07:01] it's so easier for us to go with emotion
[2:07:04] it's so easiest to lean this way and
[2:07:08] lean that way
[2:07:09] he said but when it all comes to
[2:07:11] settling it
[2:07:13] when it all comes to getting your final
[2:07:15] answer your final determination go to
[2:07:20] the word
[2:07:23] now many people will take this Bible and
[2:07:26] you'll sit down with them they'll start
[2:07:28] reading this scripture in this scripture
[2:07:30] and you see all that you just stay there
[2:07:32] and wait
[2:07:33] and I'll guarantee you you'll find out
[2:07:35] that we had a Divine interpreter of the
[2:07:38] word in our generation it says exactly
[2:07:42] what it means to say
[2:07:45] so we can't go by what so many other
[2:07:48] things but there's one thing we know
[2:07:51] that if this has been quickened in your
[2:07:54] heart
[2:07:55] nothing will move you from it
[2:07:59] so don't even let your mistakes and your
[2:08:01] failures and the sin that so easily
[2:08:04] besets you move you from the word of God
[2:08:07] don't take a substitute for anything
[2:08:11] else the word of God's been given to you
[2:08:13] and you're a part of it and it was put
[2:08:17] there and now God's I just like how he
[2:08:20] said it it's all been finished in the
[2:08:22] scriptures
[2:08:23] now he's sitting back and watching his
[2:08:26] Church watching the word transform into
[2:08:31] his bride do you love him this morning
[2:08:33] just a little Bible lesson this morning
[2:08:36] just I wanted you to hear some of these
[2:08:38] things from the the messenger himself
[2:08:41] so you you don't get all
[2:08:44] uh when no matter what you see
[2:08:48] because they they Shout with her they
[2:08:51] all do that just stay still
[2:08:53] until you see that word
[2:08:56] come up and when it's the word
[2:08:59] is life
[2:09:01] amen God bless you let's stand this
[2:09:03] morning
[2:09:09] I hope that helps this morning for some
[2:09:12] you know it's it's it's wonderful uh
[2:09:16] having Congregation of veterans of
[2:09:19] different people at different places in
[2:09:22] life young Christians but we're all
[2:09:25] growing and that word's been birthed in
[2:09:28] our heart because we've heard that eagle
[2:09:30] scream and we're all going to grow into
[2:09:32] the sons and daughters that he wants us
[2:09:34] to be let us pray if you have a desire
[2:09:37] in your heart this morning you'd like to
[2:09:39] raise your hand and ask God to touch
[2:09:42] your heart
[2:09:43] you've had questions and
[2:09:46] even wondering about your own life
[2:09:48] wondering about your past
[2:09:50] wondering about
[2:09:53] things that you've
[2:09:55] said or done or
[2:09:59] if you could just
[2:10:02] sit still for a moment and realize that
[2:10:05] the word has
[2:10:07] your answer
[2:10:09] the word has your course
[2:10:12] and you'll not find it with your own
[2:10:14] feelings you'll find it in God's word
[2:10:17] let God's word speak to you Heavenly
[2:10:21] Father Lord you know the hearts of your
[2:10:23] people this morning
[2:10:25] they love you
[2:10:27] [Music]
[2:10:30] ordain in my heart I
[2:10:32] know this is treacherous times and lots
[2:10:35] of voices and
[2:10:37] lots of movements and
[2:10:42] but Lord you gave us something that was
[2:10:44] sure
[2:10:47] something that was Vindicated
[2:10:51] father in your great wisdom you allowed
[2:10:54] it to be caught and recorded
[2:10:59] knowing that this would be such an age
[2:11:01] of technology and
[2:11:05] fast-moving
[2:11:06] ideas and
[2:11:10] but you gave us a place that
[2:11:14] we could go to
[2:11:18] and that we all could be subject to we
[2:11:21] could all have the same absolute the
[2:11:24] ultimate
[2:11:25] and as you we heard this morning that a
[2:11:28] Christian life in order to have a
[2:11:31] Christian Life
[2:11:32] you have to have an ultimate
[2:11:35] you can't live without it you can't live
[2:11:38] with having many different voices
[2:11:42] talking to you
[2:11:44] you can't live with having many
[2:11:45] different feelings and emotions and
[2:11:48] anointings
[2:11:49] you have to have something that's
[2:11:51] settled in your life
[2:11:53] if he said it that settles it
[2:11:56] whether I understand it or not it's
[2:11:59] exactly the way he said it would be
[2:12:02] that's the stabilizer of our boat
[2:12:07] that's what keeps every wind from
[2:12:10] driving us
[2:12:11] to and fro
[2:12:14] but we're anchored father that you have
[2:12:16] spoke
[2:12:17] and we have heard
[2:12:19] and we have heard and we follow
[2:12:22] we're not hearers of the word only we're
[2:12:24] doers of the word
[2:12:26] Lord I ask this morning that
[2:12:29] the word of life we take hold
[2:12:33] that if there's a seed in our midst that
[2:12:36] hasn't been terminated
[2:12:38] father that you'd bring it to life and
[2:12:40] let the Christian that's within that
[2:12:43] life grow
[2:12:44] fathers it pushes out
[2:12:47] through the flesh because you work from
[2:12:50] the inside out not from the outside in
[2:12:53] Lord can as they see the change of their
[2:12:55] Spirit they'll see the change of their
[2:12:57] body
[2:12:58] until we come to that final change of
[2:13:01] this body oh Glorious Day
