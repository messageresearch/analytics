to start by uh saying that i i've been reading in fox's book of martyrs off and on for a while and uh you know it's it's easy for us to get the wrong impression of those saints that were in the time of luther you know and uh but let me tell you what just as a brother i would admonish you to read that book if you have extra time but those saints back then hit 13 even before luther 1300s 1400s 1500s those people had an absolute i mean they had an absolute and they they lived lives that you know sometimes i read that and i'm like i'm just i feel flat you know what i mean they just it just flattens me out to look at how those people lived how the word was everything to them and they knew what this they had the revelation of what this universal thing was that was persecuting them and they called it what it was whenever they were brought up before those councils and uh you know and i just has a confession i kind of live in a state of desperation i'm always hungering and thirsting for more of god but i tell you after reading these these testimonies of these people it uh it just you know you you you're like oh my god lord i'm you know compared to them what you know what kind of an experience do i have i mean these people would deny themselves some of them were people of means and they would they would they would limit themselves to a meal a day didn't have to do it they would limit them so it would dress modestly you know uh constantly fasting and praying and they were in their bibles i tell you that what they had you know the scrolls well the other day i was uh on the road and uh and i was going to visit some people that are dear to me a brother that i was uh blessed to meet and uh and by the grace of god was you know i guess it was my lot to share the message uh with him and uh i was on my way to his house and it's it's quite a drive and on the way there i was uh you know just running over some things in my life before the lord and you know and i i see something and then i go well that's the word you know and i was like that's the word being made flesh in me i like that you know this this verse you know and that's driving a little further and some other aspects of my life came up before me and i go well that's the word that's the word being made flesh in me i was like thank you lord for that you know and it's been going on off and on for a while just different other things out of the epistles that i see are manifesting in my life and then uh it happened again a third time i thought of something and i go well that's the word and you know and uh and and then it just all of a sudden his tears started streaming out my face while i'm driving down the road and i said oh god i said make this word live in me and uh and i was pulling up to a light red light and i stopped and right after i said that i saw one of these billboards that you know changes every few seconds and it and right after i'd said that i stop at this light i look over the billboard it said believe you can and then the light turned green and i was turning and i'm going this way i'm taking a left-hand turn something had me look to the right and there was a regular billboard to the right hand side and it said you can and i knew it was the lord you know there are certain things you just can feel it in your spirit you know it's not coincident right and and so i just didn't want to take that to myself but i believe that you know what i mean saying that to all of his children you know that uh that we we're we're yearning for higher ground we're learning for a greater manifestation there's a power that's coming to the church and and we can just see the things that are coming in place and i believe it with all my heart that some of us will be brought up before you know uh and to testify and uh looking at what these people did and how the how god gave them grace to put words in their mouth that these people could not speak against you know and anyway just wanted to share that amen i believe it was the old fisherman who looked at the young boy and said amen god is everywhere amen you just have to have an eye to see him yeah man are we thankful for that sister nikki writes my neighbor daughter lauren has an internal bleed internal bleeding and has been back and forth to the hospital for a transfusion of an iron he said she has an mri tomorrow and the parents are praying that the doctors will be able to find out where the bleeding is where the bleeding is coming from amen i mean i believe we can just lift her in prayer tonight and and that the same god a man can just come on the scene for her and and help her and man this was put this morning to remember but one he said uh he wants to be in service today and he's feeling bad and he needs a touch from the lord amen we could just take that before him and pray that he will touch him and if you had the knee upon your heart just lift your hand up to him but a daniel long time could come the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can come also just go before the lord this precious heavenly father lord we just count it such an honor lord to be gathered here again tonight lord under the true living word of god father we're just the most privileged people under the sun lord that's the s-o-n father lord you have given us something those words can't describe lord god the things you've been doing in my life lord lately my brother's lives that i've seen father lord i know without a shadow of a doubt you're lifting this church into higher places lord not just me father but my brothers and sisters give us not enough but we want to give you all we have we love you father and we give you these things in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen what is uh he has a testimony if you could come at this time and then and after that olivia and abigail can come for this special amen god bless you uh no i'm not used to this but i made a promise to god like if he hate me and i'll give a testimony a couple weeks ago i decided to follow my my father-in-law it's been so long that i didn't follow his sermon when uh imagine sermon you read the scripture on james 5 14 he said is is any sick among you let him call for the elders for the church of the church and let them pray over him and anoint him him with oil in the name of the law and uh so that strike me i was like wait a minute so there is any places where god said i'm enough i'm serious and if i pray to me behave me and uh i was a little bit like huh you know i just pounding on i was like you know you know like when you they didn't escape you like you know that was trying to fight you and uh so a couple day pass by and i'm starting dealing with a lot of pressure and i do feel like pressure when i was doing it for a lot of pressure and that the scripture was coming in my in my heart i was keeping praying but the scriptures kept coming my heart all the time kept in my mind i was like nah i'm you know if i go to pray god will hear me you know he's the same god that's the pastor we pray i would pray to him and you know he answered my prayer but for this scripture keep coming my heart hard time when uh i speak to my sister and i said like you don't have a choice that's you know try to share with someone try to call your pastor and talked to him when i made an appointment with buddy david and uh i was supposed to be on friday friday night and when i was working a buddy they would give me a phone call say hey what about you mid saturday after uh after many breakfast when we met with him on saturday we went over went over and uh he gave me a book to read and he gave me he gave me a book to read and pray he prayed for me when i had an appointment for a doctor and when i went to the doctor and doctor did all the blood tests he can and prescribe me something else a medicine when i went to the medicine at home i put the medicine on the table and so i had she said you can take this medicine if you need it and in my house like well i was just in jesus hospital yesterday and they gave me his prescription and that prescription by the one i'm you say the name of the law is a strong tower the watch is next one end to it and it's safe and i was like who i'm taking this scripture who i'm taking this medicine so this is the devil try to take to give me a medicine that will make me relax like if the devil attacked you you cannot relax so you have to be happy and fighting with him whatever they come and one place is vital one of you said the devil will use he will bring his weapon and i will get my weapon too and we're going to see which one is bigger so i was like i'm going to stay with the scripture and uh i know i'm here when that seemed to be 100 under control and i come here in church and just share with everybody they didn't say this is what happened and i have said myself the lord always give me uh his prescriptions medicine i taken i'm here and i was sharing with him and i said if there's a place that's i want to be in the church because this is jesus our spirit i want to come even if next no matter what i want to be here when wednesday i came here the devil is not happy because of that and i come here i was like come here i was driving my wife and i'm i wasn't feeling good my head started hitting really bad i was heading and for some reason i i
