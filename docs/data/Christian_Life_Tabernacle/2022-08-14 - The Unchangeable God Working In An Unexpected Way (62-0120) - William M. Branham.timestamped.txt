[39:31] Ferries
[39:33] thank you
[39:36] we ask you to bless your word to us this
[39:38] evening
[39:39] as we Fellowship Lord and we listen to
[39:43] your great words of wisdom come forth in
[39:46] our heart
[39:47] Lord we just ask you to bless us this
[39:49] evening in your precious and most
[39:52] wonderful name we pray
[39:55] amen amen let's just read that scripture
[39:58] that we read this morning real quick and
[40:01] then uh
[40:02] the any Ephesians
[40:05] the fifth chapter and and that
[40:15] and it says that 25th verse husbands
[40:19] love your wives even as Christ also
[40:21] loved the church and gave himself for it
[40:24] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[40:27] with the washing of the Water by the
[40:30] word that he might present it to himself
[40:33] a glorious Church to not have any spot
[40:36] or wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[40:40] should be holy and without blemish amen
[40:45] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[40:46] word and your precious name amen God
[40:49] bless you may be seated
[40:52] we were talking this morning just for a
[40:55] little bit and I just want to make this
[40:57] one little statement
[41:01] before that we go into what we're going
[41:04] to listen to this evening
[41:06] and so you we know that a prophet of God
[41:09] many times used the the bearing of
[41:14] children of of the seed being in the
[41:17] father then going to bedding ground of
[41:19] mother and then coming forth and then
[41:22] God could have Fellowship because the
[41:25] seed of God came forth and then this is
[41:28] what the prophet of God said he says
[41:31] now then now now you can have fellowship
[41:35] with him you couldn't back there because
[41:38] you were just a word in him a seed so at
[41:44] one time you were a word in God right
[41:47] but now
[41:49] he has manifested you
[41:55] that's right and now he wants you to
[41:58] fellowship with
[42:00] him
[42:02] then he came down and was made flesh so
[42:06] he could perfectly Fellowship with you
[42:13] see
[42:14] the perfect Fellowship oh my them deep
[42:18] mysteries of God how wonderful see how
[42:24] that God could not Fellowship in the
[42:27] spirit so God became flesh with man
[42:32] now I looked at that and I thought
[42:35] I I it's just when I begin to to see all
[42:39] that God
[42:41] is going
[42:42] to do for his church
[42:45] because he spoke it
[42:47] you know you we know we talk about
[42:49] sowing a field right or a farmer goes
[42:53] out there and he looks out there and
[42:55] it's all planted and he says look at my
[42:58] Field of Corn because he knows by the
[43:01] laws of nature right
[43:04] right that with the water in the sun
[43:07] that's going to come up and produce corn
[43:10] well God looked at you the same way he
[43:13] knew you were there he planted you and
[43:16] he knows that you're going to come up to
[43:19] exactly what he planted with
[43:22] watering and the son which is the what
[43:26] the word through spirit and word God
[43:31] will make you and so he's manifesting
[43:34] you now so this evening I'd just like to
[43:37] listen with you and then I want to read
[43:40] something at the end to you just a small
[43:44] portion of a message called the
[43:47] unchangeable god
[43:50] working in unexpected ways now this is
[43:55] full of nuggets
[43:56] it's one of those sermons where brother
[43:59] Graham's just giving out little uh how
[44:02] could I say it procedural nuggets a
[44:05] little
[44:06] secrets and sayings
[44:09] to get the job done
[44:12] and we'll just listen to a small portion
[44:14] we'll do and so uh it's 5 30 now we
[44:19] should be done by 6 30. okay Lord
[44:22] willing so I think you'll enjoy this we
[44:25] won't stand for the reading because
[44:26] brother bam just quotes just a few uh
[44:30] seconds so uh yeah I don't know if you
[44:33] can pull that up on your phones your
[44:36] devices just put them in airplane mode
[44:39] all right that's I'm getting technical
[44:41] you notice that I'm becoming a
[44:44] scientific preacher
[44:46] you know you laugh at me but I used to
[44:50] go down and print out
[44:52] what we were going to read and bring it
[44:57] to church and then someone looked at me
[45:00] said Dad they all have smartphones
[45:03] they can just pull it up well now we can
[45:06] read it on the board and and you can
[45:08] look at it so let's just listen to this
[45:10] next few minutes the unchangeable God
[45:14] but he works in unexpected ways so we
[45:18] and you say why are you playing this
[45:20] because we know that God has got to
[45:23] change us
[45:24] right he's got to prepare us for the
[45:29] Rapture he's got to bring us in
[45:31] rapturing condition there's only one
[45:34] thing that could do that and that was
[45:35] the word of God but he's got power to
[45:39] make that word come alive in you you can
[45:42] beat yourself on the head trying to make
[45:45] the word to come alive a sheep doesn't
[45:47] manufacture wool it Bears wool God
[45:51] changes your nature your nature does the
[45:54] work so let's just listen for a few
[45:56] minutes I believe you'll be best listen
[45:58] close grab every little secret that he
[46:01] says and I think that your art you'll be
[46:05] blessed so God bless you let's just
[46:06] listen for the next few moments
[46:11] Malachi the third chapter and the first
[46:15] phase of the sixth verse I want to take
[46:18] a reading for I am the Lord I change not
[46:24] I want to take a little subject if it be
[46:27] pleasing to the Lord call the
[46:30] unchangeable god
[46:33] Works in an unexpected way
[46:37] the unchangeable god working in an
[46:41] unexpectable way
[46:44] now
[46:45] we are living in a changing time
[46:50] everything is changing
[46:55] just everything that you can look at and
[46:58] see with your eyes come out of the Earth
[47:00] in its material and it starts changing
[47:04] a few days ago when I first come to
[47:07] Phoenix I
[47:08] my first visit to Phoenix was 35 years
[47:12] ago this coming September
[47:15] and I lived out on the desert on 16th
[47:19] and Henshaw and
[47:21] I went down there and the the house is
[47:24] gone there's a filling station in the
[47:25] city sets there
[47:28] and also the road had been changed from
[47:31] Hinshaw to the Buckeye Road well there'd
[47:35] be nowhere ever finding it if it just
[47:37] wouldn't happen to asked around
[47:39] and that's happened in 35 years
[47:42] everything is so different
[47:44] and I remember of going out where the
[47:47] big Salt River Valley Project is
[47:50] a young fellow and I owned horses
[47:53] chasing some Burrows now it's a park
[47:57] down there
[47:58] so
[47:59] Phoenix has grown from Mountain to
[48:03] Mountain it's filled over the country
[48:05] and it's uh it's had a quite a change
[48:09] you'd hardly know your way around
[48:11] I got here I think the population is
[48:14] around 35 or 40 000 people today it's a
[48:18] half a million
[48:20] how that this place has changed
[48:23] it goes as short goes right with the
[48:25] times it changes just as time changes
[48:29] Phoenix changes other places change
[48:33] and then we also know that roads I
[48:36] noticed that chains the roads you used
[48:38] to come in on they don't they're not
[48:39] there no more they've gone some other
[48:42] way you try to follow the trail you once
[48:44] come in you get lost ran out into the
[48:47] desert somewhere so the roads has
[48:49] changed the cities changed
[48:52] and politics has changed they're
[48:56] constantly changing year after year
[48:58] politics uh changed and nations are
[49:04] changing
[49:05] the Nations year by year change they
[49:08] change your attitude
[49:10] they change their program
[49:13] and I noticed the scenes change as the
[49:16] places they cut out the timber they
[49:18] pulled down the mountain and the uh down
[49:20] in Florida they go out you go down and
[49:22] go along the coast and first time you go
[49:25] down there there's not a thing as
[49:26] Coastal water the next time they've done
[49:28] made an island out there somewhere and
[49:30] got a new big homes built on it making
[49:33] man-made Islands putting a big pump down
[49:36] in the sea and pulling up the waters
[49:38] spraying it up and then leveling it out
[49:40] with bulldozers and things and planting
[49:42] a city on top of it and some homes
[49:44] making Islands blasting off the top of
[49:47] the mountains out here war look like
[49:49] hardly a rabbit could go and they got
[49:51] they got houses up on there it's worth a
[49:54] hundred thousand dollars
[49:56] scenes change
[49:58] and we notice people change
[50:02] it's got so that people today are not
[50:04] friendly like they used to be I don't
[50:07] know whether you notice that you're not
[50:09] but we sure notice it back in the south
[50:11] and east people are changing year by
[50:14] year they're too much of a hurry they
[50:18] just got to hurry up and get this done
[50:20] and run down the road 90 miles an hour
[50:22] Bumper to Bumper and stopping a beer
[50:25] joint drink a couple hours before they
[50:27] go home
[50:28] it's in a hurry where are they going
[50:32] you notice most of the women today has
[50:35] wash machines and electric irons and
[50:38] push button dishwashers and everything
[50:41] like that and yet they got less time to
[50:43] pray than they ever had right
[50:47] you know Suzanne Wesley had 17 children
[50:52] and she with them 17 children packing
[50:55] the water from a spring and washing on
[50:58] her hands and yet she could find two or
[51:01] three hours a day to pray with her
[51:02] children
[51:05] with 17 little fellas
[51:08] and out of there come a John and a
[51:10] Charles
[51:12] that's what's the matter today reason
[51:13] our schools
[51:15] are letting down no ministers coming in
[51:18] young men interested
[51:21] we I won't need some more praying
[51:23] fathers and mothers
[51:26] it's what we need to make our schools
[51:28] fill up young man's heart burning with
[51:30] Zeal to take the gospel
[51:33] it's what we need
[51:35] but things are changing
[51:38] we could go a little farther to people
[51:40] and bring in the church church is
[51:42] changing
[51:43] we find it
[51:45] and our churches are changing
[51:47] we are really more or less I'm talking
[51:50] universally now that we are more seen to
[51:53] be more interested in getting numbers
[51:56] then we are getting people saved
[52:00] this looks like that everybody wants to
[52:02] get the biggest number or have the
[52:04] biggest church or the biggest building
[52:06] or make the biggest denomination or or
[52:09] something instead of thinking of the
[52:12] poor lost soul
[52:14] that's too bad but there's too many of
[52:17] us are doing that I heard the noted
[52:20] evangelist brother Billy Graham when he
[52:22] was at Louisville Kentucky I was invited
[52:26] with Dr martikai Ham a personal friend
[52:28] of mine that Billy was saved under his
[52:30] preaching
[52:31] and I was invited to set at the
[52:34] breakfast with him
[52:35] and Mr Graham and he's a forceful
[52:39] speaking said I go into a city and I'll
[52:43] have stayed there six weeks
[52:46] said I'll have maybe 20 000 people
[52:49] that'll make their their confession
[52:53] and said I'll get all their tickets and
[52:55] so forth and give them to the ministers
[52:57] and so then another year coming back
[53:00] said I'll go around and where I had 20
[53:03] 000 converts when I was there that year
[53:04] the next year I can't even find 20.
[53:07] I said what's the matter
[53:09] and he I were different just a little
[53:13] bit not to be different with that great
[53:15] evangelist Mr Graham certainly not but
[53:19] the way that he approached it by saying
[53:22] what's the matter and he pointed his
[53:23] finger out and said too many lazy
[53:26] preachers he said sit around with your
[53:28] feet on the desk of a daytime and night
[53:30] and don't take these cards and follow up
[53:33] he said when Paul was here he went into
[53:35] the City and had one convert and come
[53:38] back to next year you had 30 or 40 by
[53:40] that one the egg great great great great
[53:42] grandchildren over to see
[53:45] and he said I have thirty thousand and
[53:47] come back or Twenty Thousand come back
[53:49] can't find 20.
[53:51] well
[53:52] it might have been because of I'm
[53:55] Pentecostal
[53:57] and but I wanted to say this so bad that
[54:00] a Harley could hold my peace but I
[54:03] thought what lazy preacher put his feet
[54:05] up on the bench when Paul got him saved
[54:08] see it was that convert himself
[54:12] that was led deep enough into God until
[54:14] he got a hope
[54:17] and if a man really gets a hold of God
[54:20] God gets into the man's heart don't
[54:23] worry Sparks will be flying from every
[54:25] side because he's deep enough in God in
[54:29] his whole life is rooted and grounded in
[54:33] Christ
[54:35] therefore we know that it isn't just
[54:38] lazy preachers it's because that the the
[54:41] convert doesn't go deep enough till he
[54:44] loses the side of the world in the
[54:46] things of the world
[54:47] if he ever gets close enough to God he
[54:50] doesn't do that but we find out that the
[54:54] churches change and the people changes
[54:57] the roads changes the scenes changes the
[55:00] politics changes but there's one thing
[55:03] that does not change that's God Amen he
[55:06] Remains the Same I am God and I change
[55:09] not
[55:10] no matter how long it is God has never
[55:14] changed one bit and he can not change
[55:17] what a place
[55:19] the reason he cannot change is because
[55:22] God is infinite
[55:24] and anything that's infinite cannot
[55:27] change
[55:28] and then let us study this just for a
[55:31] moment before approaching on into the
[55:34] scriptures
[55:35] infinite is infinite there's there's no
[55:38] beginning or no end
[55:40] he is Almighty omnipotent
[55:44] omnipresent omnit Mission knows all
[55:46] things all places all times all powerful
[55:50] he's God
[55:52] and he cannot change now I can make a
[55:55] decision and say it's going to be this
[55:58] way and I'm finite I'll have to change
[56:02] because things come up that I I'll have
[56:04] to say well I was wrong but God can't do
[56:07] that
[56:09] because his one decision is that far
[56:12] ever
[56:13] he cannot change his decisions
[56:16] it cannot change it therefore if God's
[56:21] attitude towards one Sinner and wanted
[56:24] to repent Adam and Eve and God made a
[56:28] way for them to repent and he forgave
[56:31] that sinner
[56:33] and the next sinner comes God's got to
[56:36] do the same thing to that sinner
[56:39] or he did wrong when he acted with the
[56:41] first sinner
[56:43] and if a man was sick and God healed one
[56:48] man
[56:49] and then if ever another man comes to
[56:52] God he's got to do the same thing or he
[56:54] did wrong when he healed the first one
[56:56] if he comes on the same ground what a
[56:59] resting place then for the soul that
[57:01] seeking Refuge
[57:05] now in the beginning was the word
[57:10] and the Word was with God
[57:14] now we wonder how the the world ever got
[57:18] here
[57:19] see the the word of God created the
[57:23] world
[57:24] Hebrews 11 tells us that the world was
[57:27] made out of things this does not appear
[57:29] see God spoke it into existence
[57:33] because he was God he just said let
[57:36] there be and it was so
[57:39] therefore if in the beginning was the
[57:43] word and the word spoken was a creative
[57:46] word
[57:48] and every word that's spoken cannot be
[57:51] taken back for a mistake then in the
[57:56] beginning was the word and the Word was
[57:57] with God and the Word was God and the
[58:00] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[58:02] which is Christ and now the word of God
[58:07] written in the Bible is his word to us
[58:10] in every promise has the same power of
[58:13] creation behind it that God's word did
[58:16] at the beginning if we believe it to be
[58:18] the word of God depends on where the
[58:20] seed Falls if it falls into ground a
[58:23] ground that can create a moisture or a
[58:27] nourishment around the promise of God
[58:30] will bring forth every promise the Bible
[58:32] made it's just this why the right mental
[58:36] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[58:38] God will bring it to pass right if you
[58:41] just look at it and take care of the
[58:43] word just right because the infinite God
[58:48] spoke it
[58:50] God's word Jesus said heavens and earth
[58:54] will pass away but my word shall never
[58:57] pass away
[58:59] oh how we ought to rest upon that Divine
[59:04] promise of the son of God
[59:08] who said both heavens and earth will
[59:12] pass away but my word shall never pass
[59:16] away
[59:17] there is a resting place for the soul
[59:20] now Jesus said in the word Jesus said uh
[59:27] if you ask the father anything in my
[59:30] name I'll do it
[59:33] but sometimes when God performs
[59:36] something it does something that we ask
[59:39] for
[59:40] and yet we don't it comes in an
[59:44] unexpected way
[59:46] and sometimes in an unexpected place and
[59:50] at an unexpected time
[59:53] but God will answer in his own way
[59:59] if you just believe it
[1:00:02] you must believe it accept it and then
[1:00:06] don't take it back hold on to it
[1:00:10] lay hold of it and say this is it amen
[1:00:13] God said it that settles it
[1:00:17] if God said so that's finished no matter
[1:00:21] how long there might not have been one
[1:00:23] molecule uh come into existence when he
[1:00:27] says Let There be for a world
[1:00:30] buddy he's eternal
[1:00:33] and after a while become molecules and
[1:00:36] atoms and it come up because he said it
[1:00:39] to be that way
[1:00:41] and here's a promise to that we can
[1:00:43] think if he the one that said that has
[1:00:46] brought every word to pass then he's
[1:00:49] going to have a church to appear before
[1:00:51] him without spot or wrinkles amen and
[1:00:54] it's going to behoove us brother sister
[1:00:56] well
[1:00:57] to really
[1:01:00] be sure
[1:01:01] that we are right with God
[1:01:05] and then because there's going to be a
[1:01:07] church
[1:01:08] and we want to be part of that church no
[1:01:12] matter what this is you're on Earth we
[1:01:14] are looking for a city whose Builder and
[1:01:17] maker is God and we can't afford to lose
[1:01:20] that whatever you do don't forget that
[1:01:25] no matter what the neighbor does
[1:01:27] what the other fella does what your
[1:01:30] schoolmate does or watch your husband or
[1:01:34] your wife or anyone else it's a a
[1:01:37] personal affair with you and God you
[1:01:41] must you just must seek out that
[1:01:44] salvation your father might have been a
[1:01:47] great man your mother a great man but
[1:01:48] what about you see see it's you you must
[1:01:52] have it your own self all right now when
[1:01:56] Jesus said if you ask the father
[1:01:57] anything in my name
[1:01:59] I'll do it
[1:02:02] now that's just right straight down off
[1:02:05] of the shoulder
[1:02:07] I will do it
[1:02:09] and he was now its own conditions if
[1:02:13] you'll believe when you ask
[1:02:15] now Mark 11 22 we find out that Jesus
[1:02:18] said if you say to this mountain be thou
[1:02:21] plucked up and cast into the sea and
[1:02:23] don't doubt but believe that what you
[1:02:26] have said
[1:02:27] will come to pass you can have what
[1:02:31] you've said
[1:02:32] okay now now the thing you just couldn't
[1:02:36] get out here and say Mountain moved down
[1:02:38] you've got to have a motive and
[1:02:40] objective to that right and that's you
[1:02:43] got to find out first if it's the will
[1:02:45] of God and then your emotive and
[1:02:47] objective to the will of God and then
[1:02:49] speak to it and stand there
[1:02:52] it'll come down yeah you see if you get
[1:02:55] the conditions right but you've got to
[1:02:57] have the conditions right now you must
[1:03:00] remember also that when God answers
[1:03:02] sometime it's in an unexpected way he's
[1:03:06] unchangeable but he does things in
[1:03:09] unexpected ways now let's just call up a
[1:03:13] case or two before we proceed
[1:03:16] let's think of Moses I like to study
[1:03:19] Moses
[1:03:20] he was such a gallant man and he gave us
[1:03:23] the Old Testament through the power of
[1:03:25] God and many times a skeptic say now
[1:03:28] Moses wrote that and um how do we know
[1:03:32] it's right well you can go back and
[1:03:34] prove that it's right and if he who
[1:03:37] could say what has been and or what will
[1:03:42] be and what was to take place after him
[1:03:45] and that come to pass and I believe that
[1:03:46] that was right also is here amen see
[1:03:49] there's like a if we can stand here on
[1:03:52] uh in the church
[1:03:54] I am the Holy Spirit can go back down to
[1:03:57] your life and tell you what was
[1:04:00] and you know where that's truth or not
[1:04:02] well if you know and know it that's the
[1:04:04] truth then surely you could believe what
[1:04:06] he tells you will come to pass we'll be
[1:04:08] there because this Bears record for that
[1:04:13] and that's true and so we see as a
[1:04:16] Witnesses of Hebrews 11 and many places
[1:04:19] in the Bible that The Heroes of Faith
[1:04:22] are those who stayed with God's promise
[1:04:25] just stay right there no matter what
[1:04:28] anyone else said and God will grant it
[1:04:31] to you in his own good time now Moses
[1:04:35] went down into Egypt or was in Egypt
[1:04:37] rather he was born down there proper
[1:04:40] child his parents see he was a scene
[1:04:43] that he was and there was afraid of the
[1:04:46] king's commandment a man when Moses
[1:04:48] taught by his mother what a good teacher
[1:04:51] or his own mother and kept telling them
[1:04:54] stories Moses
[1:04:55] you are my son
[1:04:58] but you were born for a purpose
[1:05:01] and God will use you someday to deliver
[1:05:04] Israel
[1:05:06] now to the death of of uh his precious
[1:05:10] mother then I suppose Moses become a
[1:05:13] great ruler are next to Pharaoh there
[1:05:15] was heir to the throne then one day he
[1:05:19] felt for his brethren
[1:05:21] and a feeling sometime for something yet
[1:05:26] even if we feel we've got to act in
[1:05:29] God's ways to rightly get the job done
[1:05:33] certainly now I believe that God has
[1:05:35] mercy upon all the hungry and suffering
[1:05:37] and and we have all kinds of of uh
[1:05:40] organizations to feed the hungry and
[1:05:42] things I believe that's a wonderful
[1:05:44] thing but yet the real job is the gospel
[1:05:48] that's the real job is the gospel taking
[1:05:52] the gospel now we find out that after he
[1:05:56] found himself of failure in his own
[1:05:59] works because he was a smart man a
[1:06:01] military man
[1:06:02] and he was he had found a failure then
[1:06:05] he he run from the job went out into the
[1:06:08] Wilderness and was out there for 40
[1:06:10] years
[1:06:12] and he had a a wife and so forth and his
[1:06:15] children or his child rather gershom
[1:06:18] now the strange thing is with a call of
[1:06:22] God on his life I'd imagine Moses was
[1:06:25] never able to get away from that that's
[1:06:27] right
[1:06:28] never able and there may be people here
[1:06:31] tonight listening right to us
[1:06:33] that down to your life somewhere you
[1:06:36] felt there was a call in your life
[1:06:38] and you've just never heeded to it
[1:06:40] you'll be miserable as long as you live
[1:06:43] till you heed to that mind
[1:06:45] and there's no doubt there's people here
[1:06:47] tonight that's been seeking for the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost
[1:06:49] for years
[1:06:52] and you just say well I I don't know how
[1:06:55] I should receive it uh well you'll never
[1:06:58] never be satisfied until you do
[1:07:02] see because you were cut out for that
[1:07:05] and now you must make that the first
[1:07:08] thing in your life whether you eat again
[1:07:10] or whether you drink again or whether
[1:07:12] you sleep again or whatever you do you
[1:07:14] must find that
[1:07:16] that's right that must be the first
[1:07:17] thing
[1:07:19] just stay right with God's promise he
[1:07:21] promised it to you so you stay right
[1:07:23] with it see and God will bring it to
[1:07:25] pass now and he might do it at an
[1:07:28] unexpected time you say well brother
[1:07:29] Brandon I've been working hard today and
[1:07:31] I'm a little tired and I haven't felt
[1:07:33] good for three four days that might be
[1:07:35] just the time you never know when it's
[1:07:38] going to happen how many times could I
[1:07:42] stop in for days to tell the experience
[1:07:44] want to go to the woods to seek the Lord
[1:07:46] that the the Briar scratch me and the
[1:07:49] birds oh no I mean the mosquitoes bite
[1:07:51] me that's just when God's fixing to do
[1:07:53] something right then this one
[1:07:55] um just when something seems all
[1:07:58] unexpected thank God takes place takes
[1:08:01] hold now look at Moses Moses this great
[1:08:05] old sheep heard her now he was already
[1:08:09] 80 years old
[1:08:11] he was 40. before he took his sand for
[1:08:16] God
[1:08:17] and then
[1:08:18] he hurried sheep out there and I guess
[1:08:21] he was 40 years in the desert
[1:08:24] and he's uh getting to be an old man
[1:08:27] perhaps great whiskers and long flowing
[1:08:31] gray hair
[1:08:32] and Yuri was not in church
[1:08:36] he was under Mount Horeb
[1:08:39] and God
[1:08:41] never come down to a sermon but in a
[1:08:45] burning bush
[1:08:47] see an unexpected time
[1:08:52] an unexpected place
[1:08:54] and in an unexpected way
[1:08:58] why he thought God would meet him out
[1:09:00] there with this stick in his hand or
[1:09:01] sword or whatever he kill the Egyptian
[1:09:03] with but God met him not even in church
[1:09:06] under the mountain
[1:09:08] God made him not in the hymns but in a
[1:09:12] burning bush
[1:09:15] and not when he was a young man but when
[1:09:17] he was an old man
[1:09:19] God called him after he was 80 years old
[1:09:23] think of it
[1:09:25] so sometimes we think because we're 35
[1:09:27] or 40 whatever you are you're never too
[1:09:30] old
[1:09:32] you got a soul it's got to live forever
[1:09:36] so just remember it's always that way a
[1:09:39] God the unchangeable god in an
[1:09:42] unexpected time and unexpected way in an
[1:09:45] unexpected Place let's take Jacob Jacob
[1:09:48] was running he got caught between two
[1:09:51] fires
[1:09:53] now he was going home
[1:09:55] and Lebanon his father-in-law was coming
[1:09:58] this way after him because his wife had
[1:10:00] stole their gods
[1:10:02] and then he finds out Esau's coming this
[1:10:04] way after him his brother who he had
[1:10:06] cheated
[1:10:08] now that was quite an unexpected time
[1:10:11] for God to visit him
[1:10:13] but he was here come Lebanon this way
[1:10:16] and here come Elena coming this way and
[1:10:18] he saw this way but Jacob crossed the
[1:10:22] Little Brook
[1:10:23] and then he got down to business
[1:10:27] and maybe for the first time in his life
[1:10:30] he got a hold of something that was real
[1:10:35] and he was able to hold on
[1:10:38] until the blessing comes that would be a
[1:10:41] great lesson for all of us when you once
[1:10:43] get a hold of something that's real
[1:10:46] hold to it amen don't turn it loose
[1:10:50] Hallelujah no matter how many times the
[1:10:52] Sun Passes over or whatever takes place
[1:10:55] how many hungry pains comes whatever
[1:10:57] more hold on to it until you are blessed
[1:11:01] of it until you have the promise of it
[1:11:04] back
[1:11:05] hold on
[1:11:06] he put his wife and all the way from him
[1:11:09] and separated himself and held on
[1:11:12] because he was caught between two fires
[1:11:16] and God met him in an unexpected way in
[1:11:21] an unexpected time in an unexpected
[1:11:24] place
[1:11:25] that's where God met him Isaiah the
[1:11:29] prophet
[1:11:30] a young fellow had leaned upon the good
[1:11:32] King's arm and he was a good man and he
[1:11:36] had had things easy but one day the king
[1:11:38] died in Isaiah the prophet went down to
[1:11:42] the altar in the house of God and while
[1:11:45] he was praying there he was caught
[1:11:47] between his own sins and Division
[1:11:50] and he screamed out whoa is me
[1:11:54] when he seen the angels with wings over
[1:11:56] their faces Wings over their feet and
[1:11:59] flying crying holy holy holy unto the
[1:12:03] Lord
[1:12:04] he cried wow is me for I'm a man of
[1:12:08] unclean lips
[1:12:10] he was caught
[1:12:12] in an unexpected time an unexpected
[1:12:15] place he thought I'd go down and say my
[1:12:18] prayers and get up and go on because
[1:12:19] people believe I'm a good preacher or
[1:12:21] Pastor or something everybody was caught
[1:12:24] there Not only was he caught in this
[1:12:26] condition with a vision but he was
[1:12:28] caught with unclean lips
[1:12:31] In The House of the Living God
[1:12:34] oh brother if that would search out
[1:12:37] through this city tonight and tomorrow
[1:12:39] morning of ministers who would stand and
[1:12:42] tell you that there is no such a thing
[1:12:45] as Divine Healing and there's no such a
[1:12:47] thing as the baptism the Holy Spirit
[1:12:48] there'd be some more crying out worries
[1:12:51] me with unclean lips
[1:12:54] true
[1:12:55] yes very much so
[1:12:57] the Hebrew children
[1:13:00] now they were caught in quite a
[1:13:03] predicament too they were caught in an
[1:13:06] unexpected place where they met God for
[1:13:09] God to come to him in a fiery furnace
[1:13:12] unexpected time
[1:13:14] an unexpected way but God is the
[1:13:18] inchangeable God unchangeable God and he
[1:13:21] does things that way any unexpectable
[1:13:24] place unexpectable time and so forth
[1:13:26] Israel asked for a mighty king
[1:13:31] they wanted a King to deliver them
[1:13:33] that's what they expected God to send to
[1:13:36] them was a King to deliver them a mighty
[1:13:38] king that would March like David the son
[1:13:41] of David would rise up come down the
[1:13:43] corners of Heaven walk down to the Earth
[1:13:46] the full Angel salute and the father
[1:13:49] will look out of the heaven and say I'm
[1:13:51] sending down to you now the Messiah and
[1:13:53] uh they had it all fixed up but that's
[1:13:55] the way he was supposed to come but what
[1:13:57] did they get
[1:13:59] they got a baby
[1:14:01] instead of a mighty king
[1:14:04] a baby born in a a little stable the
[1:14:09] side of a hillside
[1:14:12] a little cave stable
[1:14:14] with straw and the manure from the
[1:14:17] animals and a a baby
[1:14:20] but it was the answer of their prayer
[1:14:23] he was exactly what they needed amen
[1:14:28] but they wanted it in their own way yeah
[1:14:31] look they want it the way they they
[1:14:33] thought was best
[1:14:35] but God knows how to set it in the way
[1:14:37] that he knows his best
[1:14:39] because he's an infinite God and he
[1:14:42] knows just how to send it he knows your
[1:14:43] needs he knows how to bring it to you
[1:14:45] but the trouble of it is because it
[1:14:47] don't come the way you think it ought to
[1:14:49] come then you're all discouraged and you
[1:14:51] hand it back to him let's ask him and
[1:14:55] believe that he'll send it just the way
[1:14:57] he wants it and accepts it upon the
[1:15:00] bases right
[1:15:02] if you ask him don't make him a liar he
[1:15:05] can't lie he promises to Father anything
[1:15:08] in my name I'll do it
[1:15:09] man God can't lie
[1:15:12] I assuming it it shall be done man seek
[1:15:16] ye shall find knock it'll be open
[1:15:18] we believe that certainly we do they got
[1:15:21] a major so what did they do had this
[1:15:24] little baby in the manger is that the
[1:15:26] mighty king they refused thee yes sir
[1:15:30] why he didn't come the way they expected
[1:15:33] him to come and friends you might think
[1:15:36] that was a horrible thing it was but you
[1:15:38] know we're guilty of the same thing
[1:15:41] we are guilty of the same thing we ask
[1:15:44] God for things and then we walk around
[1:15:46] and if you don't just pour something on
[1:15:48] us and give us something that uh we
[1:15:50] think we ought to have then we just hand
[1:15:52] it back see don't do that ask him stay
[1:15:55] right with it hold on to it if you know
[1:15:58] it's real and then what's more real than
[1:16:00] the word of God and the word of God is
[1:16:03] made flesh and dwelt Among Us Christ and
[1:16:06] now Christ sent the Holy Spirit and he
[1:16:09] is God in spirit so then hold on to it
[1:16:12] if the holy spirit's here and give us
[1:16:14] that promise stay with it
[1:16:17] with us Pentecostal people
[1:16:19] who profess to have the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:22] afraid to trust God anywhere
[1:16:26] we expect it in some other way I think
[1:16:29] that what we're doing I'll tell you the
[1:16:31] truth I think we're expecting it God to
[1:16:33] come in and Bloom us out in a great big
[1:16:34] organization of this type and that time
[1:16:37] and when you do you build complex
[1:16:38] against the other fella the thing we
[1:16:41] ought to do brother is forget about that
[1:16:43] your organizations are fine but what we
[1:16:45] want is born-again Christians with
[1:16:47] salvation their heart and the power of
[1:16:48] the Holy Ghost in that
[1:16:53] and I have feelings for one another
[1:16:55] glorious feelings hopes of feelings and
[1:16:59] brotherly affections
[1:17:01] that binds us together that's what God
[1:17:04] wants us to have he's the infinite God
[1:17:07] and he cannot change his words he cannot
[1:17:10] change them now watch so they refused
[1:17:14] him because he didn't come the way that
[1:17:16] he they expected it to be and we noticed
[1:17:20] that he did come in the scriptural form
[1:17:24] he come exactly according to the the
[1:17:28] scriptural plan in each one of these did
[1:17:30] also at the right place at the right
[1:17:33] time and in the right way
[1:17:36] God always does it in his way and it's
[1:17:38] the right way now
[1:17:40] Moses why would he doubt he was called
[1:17:44] at Birth
[1:17:45] he was a baby when God called him he was
[1:17:48] born in this world for a purpose
[1:17:50] he is Born the prophet
[1:17:53] ought not to be no hard thing for Moses
[1:17:54] to think that be unexpected because you
[1:17:57] ought to be expecting God to call him
[1:17:58] Jacob God just spoke to him and said
[1:18:01] Jacob return home I'll be with you and
[1:18:04] multiply you I will make your seeds like
[1:18:07] this Sands of the sea why was he so so
[1:18:11] unexpected then for God to come to him
[1:18:14] that night when Laban was coming one way
[1:18:17] and he saw another yet God promised him
[1:18:19] time
[1:18:21] amen amen hallelujah
[1:18:24] there you are friends
[1:18:27] when God makes a promise in the
[1:18:29] opposition rise that's only their test
[1:18:31] whether you really got the word or not
[1:18:34] the man that's got good gold don't mind
[1:18:36] going to the touching Stone thing
[1:18:39] that's true see it's only a Peter said I
[1:18:42] believe it was that these trials are
[1:18:44] come to test us
[1:18:46] Trust see what we'll do with it
[1:18:50] right when you get the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:53] and husbands go run you out of the house
[1:18:55] or or mother's gonna make you leave home
[1:18:58] them things don't give up go back into
[1:19:00] the world that's only a testing time
[1:19:04] Jacob he ought to know better than that
[1:19:08] but he had kind of wasted a lot of his
[1:19:10] life away and running around and so
[1:19:12] forth from here to there and he I like
[1:19:14] what he said there I crossed this Jordan
[1:19:16] with only a staff
[1:19:18] and now I'll come back in two armies
[1:19:22] come back so multiplied and he said
[1:19:25] here's Esau my brother coming this way
[1:19:27] and my father-in-law is over here after
[1:19:29] me and that when he got in that kind of
[1:19:32] a condition but he went to the right
[1:19:33] place and began to unexpectingly I guess
[1:19:36] to get the answer but God came down and
[1:19:39] he had a wrestling match and stayed with
[1:19:42] God and held on until a blessing God I
[1:19:45] like Jacob in this way when he actually
[1:19:47] seen something that was right
[1:19:49] when he got his hand on something that
[1:19:51] was true he held on to it until he got
[1:19:54] results yeah
[1:19:56] oh if we would do that
[1:19:58] if the church would only do that if
[1:20:01] you'd only be convinced that it's right
[1:20:03] I know it's God's promise and it cannot
[1:20:05] fail you just it cannot fail someone
[1:20:09] talk you out of it say it's a for some
[1:20:11] other generation it wasn't for us and
[1:20:13] that that is a scripture
[1:20:15] Jesus said in Mark 60 going into all the
[1:20:19] world preach the gospel to every
[1:20:22] creature
[1:20:23] these signs shall follow them that
[1:20:25] believe see for high for all the world
[1:20:28] every creature these signs shall follow
[1:20:31] in all the world to every creature that
[1:20:33] believes Peter said on the day of
[1:20:35] Pentecost father promise isn't to you
[1:20:39] and to your children and to them it's
[1:20:42] far off even as men is the Lord Our God
[1:20:44] shall call amen how you going to do it
[1:20:48] the gospel must be preached and it's all
[1:20:50] all the world beginning at Jerusalem
[1:20:53] Luke 24 49 he said Terry in the city of
[1:20:55] Jerusalem until you're due with power
[1:20:57] from on high
[1:20:59] after the Holy Ghost acts I want a holy
[1:21:02] ghost has come upon you then you'll be
[1:21:03] Witnesses of me in Judea Samara and to
[1:21:07] the uttermost parts of the earth
[1:21:08] everywhere the Holy Spirit bearing
[1:21:11] record with signs and wonders how are we
[1:21:13] going to get away from it it's God's
[1:21:15] promise don't let the devily Slick
[1:21:18] tongue as he can be in a very seemingly
[1:21:21] a scriptural red person but he twists it
[1:21:24] to make it say something that it doesn't
[1:21:26] say and yet the Bible said it's so plain
[1:21:28] that even a fool shouldn't Airy in the
[1:21:30] way right just take a hold of God's
[1:21:33] promise and hold on to it hold on to
[1:21:35] that one until you get a hold of another
[1:21:36] when you see this an answer then get a
[1:21:38] hold of this one then hold on to that
[1:21:40] until you get another one then just keep
[1:21:42] on climbing
[1:21:44] is that juare was singing last night
[1:21:46] down to the other Church the brother
[1:21:49] Outlaws Church saying uh first round was
[1:21:51] regeneration and he kept on another and
[1:21:53] got somewhere else and yeah after his
[1:21:55] while he went past the Mars Jupiter and
[1:21:57] hit the milky white wind just kept on
[1:21:59] going
[1:22:00] I like that see just keep climbing round
[1:22:03] by round
[1:22:05] take a hold of God's promise say God you
[1:22:07] promised to save me hold on to it stay
[1:22:09] right there until you're saved God you
[1:22:11] promise to fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:22:13] stay right there till you feel what the
[1:22:14] Holy Ghost if you're sick say you
[1:22:16] promised to heal me I'm staying right
[1:22:18] here till you heal me there you are
[1:22:19] that's the way to do it stay with us God
[1:22:23] is infinite he's unchangeable he cannot
[1:22:27] change and he does it in unexpected ways
[1:22:30] but hold on until time don't tell God
[1:22:32] watch how you want him to do it he'll do
[1:22:34] it the way he wants to do it don't tell
[1:22:36] him how to do it now what
[1:22:38] now we find out that Isaiah was born the
[1:22:41] prophet
[1:22:43] now he was in the line of duty when he
[1:22:46] was down there at the altar he was no
[1:22:47] strange thing for a prophet to see a
[1:22:49] vision
[1:22:50] so he ought to remember he was right in
[1:22:52] the line of duty so he wasn't out of the
[1:22:54] scripture he was right in the scripture
[1:22:56] God said if there be one among you
[1:22:58] spiritual the prophet all the Lord God
[1:23:00] will make myself known unto him what
[1:23:01] this Prophet says comes to pass then
[1:23:03] hear him if it don't refuse him so see
[1:23:05] Jacob is in the line of the scripture
[1:23:07] Moses in the line of the scripture and
[1:23:09] um Elijah let's take Elijah here I'd
[1:23:12] like to say to him now he got out there
[1:23:15] in the wilderness and got Moody and God
[1:23:19] sent him fed him with an angel and put
[1:23:22] him in the wilderness and he wandered
[1:23:24] for 40 days a night and the first thing
[1:23:27] you know what happened
[1:23:29] he'd come up back in the cave and the
[1:23:32] prophet back there he heard the Russian
[1:23:34] wind
[1:23:35] splashing blowing you heard the rocks
[1:23:37] are roaring everything he thought well
[1:23:40] that's that's all right I've been up on
[1:23:42] Mount Carmel I know he answers the
[1:23:44] Thunder and the lightning and the rain I
[1:23:46] know it but what got the prophet was
[1:23:48] that unexpected still Small Voice
[1:23:51] there's work makes so many of us
[1:23:53] Pentecostal people jump see we are
[1:23:56] expecting something some other way when
[1:23:59] God brings it in his own way see we
[1:24:02] think that it uh we are coming the way
[1:24:04] we expect it but God sends it in his own
[1:24:06] way the way he wants to do it do it now
[1:24:09] Jesus when they asked for a king Isaiah
[1:24:12] 9 6 he said unto us a child is born the
[1:24:15] son is given his government should be
[1:24:18] upon his shoulders uh virgins shall
[1:24:20] conceive and bring forth a child you'll
[1:24:22] be called Emmanuel and while he come
[1:24:24] exactly in the line of the scriptures
[1:24:26] man
[1:24:28] did he just exactly what the scripture
[1:24:31] said Moses was lined up but it didn't
[1:24:33] come the way he thought it would he
[1:24:35] thought I would kill that Egyptian ah
[1:24:37] that'll be it then all the children of
[1:24:39] Israel say so and so he see he's our
[1:24:41] conqueror but it didn't come that way
[1:24:43] but he was still in his line of the
[1:24:45] scriptures Jacob all the rest of them
[1:24:47] was in line of the scriptures when God
[1:24:49] worked and if we get ourselves lined up
[1:24:51] with the word of God and hold on to it
[1:24:54] yes what can us brother Branham what can
[1:24:57] I do to be lined up with the word of God
[1:24:59] just take it in your heart and believe
[1:25:01] it amen every promise is yours it's
[1:25:05] yours you can have it it belongs to you
[1:25:08] every promise in the book you sing is
[1:25:10] mine every chapter ever verse amen I'm
[1:25:13] trusting in his love divine forever
[1:25:15] promised in the book of God no matter
[1:25:18] what the promise is it's yours anyhow
[1:25:20] because God gave it to you whosoever
[1:25:23] will let him come and drink from The
[1:25:24] Fountains of Water of Life freely it's
[1:25:27] yours it belongs to you any promise
[1:25:29] belongs to you if you have faith to
[1:25:31] appropriate it and it'll do it if you'll
[1:25:34] just believe it
[1:25:48] I hope you gleaned all the nuggets out
[1:25:51] of that that were in there
[1:25:53] I mean but that's some real things right
[1:25:56] there those things are the things that
[1:25:58] will help you those are the things you
[1:26:00] can't run from your call
[1:26:02] you'll never be happy until you take you
[1:26:05] you get a hold of it that just so many
[1:26:07] notes I wrote you know
[1:26:10] I was real worried about playing playing
[1:26:12] this and
[1:26:14] you know the enemies always talking to
[1:26:17] me about when sister Laurie sang that
[1:26:19] song I knew that this is exactly what
[1:26:21] that was what we needed I think it's
[1:26:24] what we needed uh
[1:26:27] and uh there's just so many things that
[1:26:30] he said about holding on to it uh you
[1:26:34] could just go back and read it but I
[1:26:36] just wanted to close
[1:26:38] this evening in reading this testimony
[1:26:42] because God works in unexpected ways at
[1:26:47] unexpected times
[1:26:50] um I got this email from Brother Rob
[1:26:53] rippath and and uh
[1:26:59] you know I can
[1:27:01] say that when I first contacted Rob and
[1:27:06] Rob made contact with me a few years
[1:27:09] back
[1:27:10] he
[1:27:12] um
[1:27:13] I could I guess I could just say it the
[1:27:16] way that it was is
[1:27:18] he was a pretty hurt
[1:27:21] and broken
[1:27:23] man but he got back with God
[1:27:26] and he started believing God and I just
[1:27:29] would like to read this to you in
[1:27:33] closing this evening this is brother to
[1:27:37] brother McGarry brother McGarry thank
[1:27:39] you for answering my request and in
[1:27:43] writing this

[1:27:48] Christ Glory
[1:27:51] and his edification
[1:27:54] so I wrote him and he wrote back and he
[1:27:56] says I'm writing this for this purpose
[1:27:59] to give God
[1:28:01] originally my plan was to attend church
[1:28:03] and share the wonderful news of what the
[1:28:07] Lord has done for my co-worker's wife
[1:28:11] of course things changed a week ago past
[1:28:16] Monday at my home and I needed to come
[1:28:19] home for my wife our youngest daughter
[1:28:21] had moved to Amarillo about three weeks
[1:28:24] ago and she had no local support
[1:28:28] keep the testimony accurate I asked
[1:28:31] Javier in his words to write a brief
[1:28:33] summary due to the various dates and
[1:28:37] doctors report this is Rob writing to me
[1:28:41] I've been witnessing to Jarvis
[1:28:47] on and off for the past few months as he

[1:29:15] the day before
[1:29:17] had just returned from vacation in
[1:29:21] helping with his wife's medical needs in
[1:29:25] Edmond and I could see he was under a
[1:29:29] lot of stress as he had kept me abreast
[1:29:32] of some of that of the details
[1:29:36] originally
[1:29:38] suggesting he take another week off
[1:29:42] to before returning to Waco
[1:29:46] on the 19th I let him know that I had
[1:29:50] kept his family in prayer and would
[1:29:54] continue to do so and offered to pray
[1:30:00] with him at that moment
[1:30:03] he asked if I would and we United in
[1:30:07] prayer as I entered into his burden and
[1:30:12] took the Lord at his word
[1:30:15] approaching him according to his word
[1:30:18] through the shed blood of calvary
[1:30:21] two or three agree in his name
[1:30:24] we laid hands of faith upon his wife
[1:30:28] 350 miles away
[1:30:31] binding that demon spirit
[1:30:34] in demanding it to leave in Jesus name
[1:30:38] asking the great physician to appear
[1:30:41] that the doctors wouldn't find anything
[1:30:45] that Jarvis would have a great testimony
[1:30:48] from the Lord healing of his family and
[1:30:51] friends thank the Lord for his healing
[1:30:56] when we were done Jarvis mentioned that
[1:30:59] he had never heard such a prayer and
[1:31:02] feeling the presence of the Lord I let
[1:31:05] him know it wasn't me it was him
[1:31:08] pointing upward
[1:31:10] the god I believe in and have found
[1:31:14] favor to have access to him as I believe
[1:31:18] in the serving a living God
[1:31:22] it that there's a difference in approach
[1:31:30] this was was just another normal work
[1:31:34] day
[1:31:36] and I was only doing as led to do at
[1:31:41] that moment
[1:31:44] unexpected place

[1:31:54] the Lord Jesus

[1:32:53] Gonzalez my phone number is
[1:32:56] 405-831-0099
[1:33:01] on June 17th my white my my wife went
[1:33:06] for medical regular checkup during a
[1:33:10] trip to Columbia South America where she
[1:33:14] has gone to visit her parents
[1:33:16] and to ensure our youngest son's
[1:33:19] language skills develop
[1:33:21] well to take advantage of his summer
[1:33:24] vacation
[1:33:26] during that medical visit
[1:33:28] her doctor found some unnormal test
[1:33:32] results in her breast
[1:33:34] on June 19th further tests were
[1:33:37] conducted
[1:33:38] to uh
[1:33:41] eliminate pitfalls on results
[1:33:45] on June 23rd she was informed that she
[1:33:49] had stage two cancer diagnosis
[1:33:53] on June 27th she received a medical
[1:33:56] intervention to remove any bad tissue on
[1:34:00] June 20
[1:34:01] 9th she went back to the doctor to
[1:34:04] follow up
[1:34:06] and to ensure she was okay
[1:34:09] she was not feeling well during several
[1:34:12] weeks therefore my family traveled back
[1:34:15] to the States and on the 10th of July
[1:34:20] once she thought she was doing a little
[1:34:22] better
[1:34:23] and to receive further medical
[1:34:26] involvement here in the states if needed
[1:34:29] during all the time our family and I was
[1:34:33] going through a very difficult trial
[1:34:36] as understood she is everything to my
[1:34:40] kids and to me on July 15th she visited
[1:34:45] a doctor in Oklahoma and received
[1:34:48] further tests to ensure not bad tissue
[1:34:52] to ensure not bad tissue was still
[1:34:55] present to our precise the results to
[1:34:58] our surprise the results came back
[1:35:01] positive
[1:35:02] therefore she was going to have to go
[1:35:04] through another surgery on July 19th Rob
[1:35:09] and I got together and Rob prayed to God
[1:35:12] I felt an amazing touch
[1:35:15] and a huge relief once he finished
[1:35:18] asking God for his Healing Hand
[1:35:25] I was in tears a couple days later once
[1:35:28] my wife called me
[1:35:30] to let me know her test results
[1:35:32] indicated she was cancer-free
[1:35:36] subsequently she has been tested again
[1:35:40] twice
[1:35:42] in the same negative result
[1:35:45] she is still recovering from those
[1:35:47] turbulent times and is doing much better
[1:35:51] I hope I am understood as I am grateful
[1:35:56] writing this note to testify of the
[1:36:00] power of the prayer and especially
[1:36:03] to the power of God I have told Rob that
[1:36:07] he is a very special human but he humbly
[1:36:10] replied it is not me it's all the glory
[1:36:15] to him thank you for taking time to read
[1:36:18] this testimony
[1:36:24] thank you
[1:36:29] days of Miracles aren't over
[1:36:33] they're just not coming
[1:36:36] or I should say they are coming in
[1:36:39] unexpected ways at unexpected times in
[1:36:42] unexpected places
[1:36:45] it was just a normal day at work
[1:36:48] and a brother felt led to pray with
[1:36:50] another brother
[1:36:53] and he said I followed all the points
[1:36:58] all the things that were laid down were
[1:37:02] ever two are great together he built the
[1:37:05] foundation on the word
[1:37:09] and and I know this brother he he
[1:37:12] struggles with importance he struggles
[1:37:15] with calm you know but yet
[1:37:19] God manifested
[1:37:22] and
[1:37:23] took his prayer
[1:37:25] and this man testified
[1:37:27] that that brother's prayer
[1:37:30] God honored that prayer
[1:37:32] and my wife is healed
[1:37:35] and so I could go back through this book
[1:37:38] and read quote to you after quotes we
[1:37:41] don't give up don't let down hold to the
[1:37:44] word keep climbing all the things that
[1:37:48] were said in there how much they apply
[1:37:51] how he talked about what the church
[1:37:53] should be and and and and that's what
[1:37:57] we're the voice to
[1:37:59] so you you never know
[1:38:02] when God could come on the scene but
[1:38:05] just line up with the word
[1:38:07] line your spirit up line your nature up
[1:38:10] when the spirit moves on your heart I
[1:38:14] like what he said if you've been seeped
[1:38:16] in the Holy Ghost I don't know how long
[1:38:18] he said it don't matter believe you'll
[1:38:21] get it hold on to it it's your promise
[1:38:24] don't take the substitute take something
[1:38:27] that's genuine we believe in the baptism
[1:38:31] of the Holy Spirit we believe that God
[1:38:33] can change your nature can deliver you
[1:38:36] can come live in you and give you the
[1:38:39] power to hold on and to believe his word
[1:38:42] you don't have to have any sensation to
[1:38:46] hang on to there's only one thing you
[1:38:48] hang on to as he said so that settles it
[1:38:52] the Holy Ghost is mine I've been
[1:38:55] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:57] Christ he promised I would receive the
[1:39:00] gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:03] he'll take care of it amen amen he'll
[1:39:05] bring it to pass it might be an
[1:39:07] unexpected time it might be an
[1:39:09] unexpected place it might be an
[1:39:12] unexpected way it might not be the way
[1:39:15] that you think so that's why you don't
[1:39:17] look at anything you don't plan anything
[1:39:19] you just believe God for what he said
[1:39:23] and I believe if you you'll do those
[1:39:27] things if if there's so many secrets and
[1:39:31] little nuggets there then just anchor
[1:39:33] yourself in that this evening so I just
[1:39:37] trust it was a blessing to you and I
[1:39:40] thought here's what brother random
[1:39:41] talked about and then here and here it
[1:39:44] is
[1:39:45] manifested
[1:39:47] in flesh
[1:39:49] remember every promise of God will be
[1:39:53] manifested in flesh he'll never leave it
[1:39:56] floating in the sky
[1:39:59] it'll come to pass when I say flesh not
[1:40:03] only human flesh but physical things
[1:40:06] Natural Things spiritual things it is
[1:40:10] he's changed not he's still a Healer
[1:40:13] he's still a savior he'll still work
[1:40:15] with your children he'll still do it
