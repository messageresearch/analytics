Description:
Living In the Secret Place of God
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: June 17,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

continue to play that let's go before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord I believe that's each one of our hearts cry tonight Lord is that we could be hid away in you Lord we see you the world is in such chaos and despair the Lord were so privileged to know you in the power of your resurrection to know Lord that you've prepared a place for your bride that we can come and we can rest Lord now we can enter in behind the veil Lord and there the enemy cannot get to us or then that's our hearts cry tonight Lord is with you just take us in behind available father forgive us of our sins Lord forgive us for our iniquities Lord forgive us for the lust of the eye and the pride of life and the lust of the flesh law where we get our eyes back on you we get our eyes on Calvary Lord Lord we believe that the time is closer than it's ever been or do we want to be in our positions we want to be doing and saying the right things order to live in a life that's pleasing to you Lord we believe it's moments like this that you've ordained that we would come as simple ourselves together and we could sing some songs of praise and or they'd be pleasing to you and you just pass by our way Lord administer to our hearts for father we ask that you'd come and break the bread of life now as only as you can we commit every one to you we surrender ourselves to thy presence the Holy Spirit we pray the name of Jesus Christ to be back hallelujah man praise the Lord we'll be reading out of Psalms 27 Psalms 27 we we just want to continue on a thought of living in the secret place of God living in the secret place of God but as a as a subject we want to just speak on a hidden life just reading in Psalms 27 for says one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and enquire and his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall you hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and also we just want to read out of Hebrews 10 me reading verse 19 through 23 Hebrews 10:19 through 23 says having therefore brethren boldness to enter and to the holiest by the blood of Jesus I mean this is actually the text brother branham takes to preach this sermon a hidden life in 1955 in October by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an High Priest over the house of God let us draw near or the true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised a man you may be seated a man just in speaking on living in the secret place of God or living at living in a hidden life and Jesus Christ I believe there's there's a deep hunger in the bride of Jesus Christ and a craving that's in you as the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of God in His righteousness that word seek is a craving and last time we spoke we ministered on this and we were just drawing from spiritual food and due season where the Prophet talks about how dear in the time of drought and during the time of famine that God had a special prepared place for Elijah to go there he was able to go that God had ordained a place that he could go during the time of the famine and it was a it was a provided place that Elijah had entered in it was a secret place that that God had provided no one knew about it and the Prophet said that that's a perfect type of the day that we're living in that God has prepared a secret place for the bride to enter in and he said the way that Elijah entered into this was by the plan of God by the call of God and by the word of God and that's how we enter into that secret place in Christ and he said and that is he says he references all the scriptures pertaining to this day Malachi 4 Luke 17 13 says John 14:12 and Joel 2:28 he says all these scriptures that point last day he says and that is Christ if you can hide away in that now in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of God and we know what he says that's in Christ Christ is an anointing so if you can hide away in Christ in that secret place that Christ is anointing that's the Shekinah of glory that's the Holy Ghost that that's where the power comes forth and that's where the Holy Ghost and the gospel comes forth and power and demonstration is when you can enter in behind the veil where the you're living in the Shekinah glory and in his presence and that's what we're wanting to speak on is it is is moving into that place and as I thought about that I was thinking about how David you know David was anointed to be king he was elected and he was chosen to be king and the scripture says that when Samuel anointed him to be king the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and it's so as our postures been pointed out that what David being anointed in the spirit Lord came upon him it wasn't that he would have power when he came into the throne but no David when he was anointed that power came unto David then and David had access to that power and maybe I should say it like this look that I Justin fellowship with our pastor not necessarily that we have access to the power like it's something somewhere else but we possess the power that's why David could come out there and stand in front of Goliath Goliath had no chance because David had been anointed he had been elected and he had been chosen to take the throne so nothing was going to get in his way or stop him from moving to an into his position and that's the same thing with the bride of Jesus Christ we have been elected we have been chosen he's given us a spirit and there's nothing that's going to stop you from coming into that position in Jesus Christ we just want to read this quote here out of a hidden life it says has Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotional or mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there and something's taken place that you don't know how it come but you're hit away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered into that place my dear brother that's a sincere question tonight have you entered into that place my dear brother it's okay if you have it it's an invitation it's an invitation you don't have to to work it up and make an intellectual conception you know you know if you're living and overcoming life you know if the Spirit of God is present moving and working through you just let God deal with your heart respond to the invitation have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and get smart but till the love of God is so anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from everywhere what a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we go we got to come to my brethren that's the place where God reveals his secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling Oh David said in the secret of us Tabernacle in that hidden place look when you're in there that affects all of your decisions that affects your your-your-your risings and your goings and your comings that that is something that has full sway over your body it's controlling your thoughts thinking on these things whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely think on these things we want to be we want to come into a place where the Holy Spirit has such a reign in our lives that it's it's influencing our very thoughts because the way we go through this allow do you see an age oh we're so bombarded with so many things but we want to have that same mind of Christ that we do nothing but what the father shows us that we're only thinking upon the things that are true only thinking upon the things of his word that's the place where God speaks back that's the place where that seed faith that our pastor has been talking about I want to say that's the place where that seed faith blossoms but the random said that mustard seed faith will perform a miracle but he said just hold on to it he said you just hold on to that faith that God has given you just like Abraham Abraham staggered not at the promise of God and he held on to that faith that he had and when it when it seemed like the situation got more impossible the scripture says all his faith got strong or giving praise unto God and I want to say to my brothers and sisters oh yes it seems we've been going a long time it seems like the rapture should have already taken place seems like we should have already went into a body change and now we're seeing a veterans and men of God who have packed this gospel and had preached it without wavering believing that that they would they would step into that new body now we're seeing some of them I'll be planted in the ground like a time capsule until that great a resurrection day and and oh it just seems that time just moves on a little bit more and a little bit more but oh we want to enter in and go further than just the seed faith we're going beyond that as our pastor has been talking about we want to enter in and behind the veil we want to go into the holiest of Holies and my just what did the prophet say how do we enter in there by his plan by his call and by his word and by just look at this picture here what a beautiful picture we have in type of God leading his people by a pillar of fire by the word of his prophet just look at the order of the camp set out there around the Tabernacle in the wilderness there God bringing his people out of bondage leading them by a pillar of fire standing there with a vindicated prophet in that in that a sight to behold I was just looking at that and I certainly would have been like rehab be like yeah I've heard I've heard about y'all and we are shaken we are terrified I mean some of our guys went outside the city and we saw that you know what what an amazing display of the order of God in his ways there look at such order such power out there in the middle of the wilderness such a beautiful type when we look at that there's types and shadows we want to draw from just as we move for this message of a hidden life my it's just so packed the Prophet says now God has made it so wonderful that in the Old Testament were usually I go to for a refuge for a text once in a while he's made the Old Testament in parables and in symbolic forms to express himself in his doings that the simple-minded might be able to have a conception of his will and what he has done praise the Lord and I just pray that even in going through this that it would encourage you because sometimes the Old Testament in certain places can be maybe a little overwhelming or just a lot of information but I really want to encourage you to to really dig into that and take heed of what the prophets saying because he's saying he made the Old Testament in parables and in symbolic form to express himself and is doing that the simple-minded might be able to have a conception I was will and what he's done so we can look back in the Old Testament and get a greater understanding of the ways of God he says many times in the Old Testament how I went back to find the old typing the new always God did and what he's doing now in the New Testament he foreshadowed it in the Old Testament now for instance in the Old Testament how God gave all of his parable back there and set forth his things that would be a shadow of today then that's the only way that I can teach the Bible they talk about big Greek words and so forth they just tie me in all kind of play but if I look back and see what God did back there as a foreshadow then I have some general conception of what he's doing today because that was a shadow if I'm going west and the sun's rising in the east and my shadow is before me and I've never seen myself or never knowed what I look like or a human being I'd have some conception of my form when I seen my shadow now if you can pull from that and maybe look in there you can look into the Bible and see a little of yourself you can look into the Old Testament and you can look into a New Testament and you can see maybe what was of a shadow now coming into manifestation and the Old Testament is a shadow of the coming of Christ and everything foreshadowed the cross and in Christ all God's Redemption all of his plans all of the plan of salvation all was met at Calvary and just looking at the pattern of the tabernacle we could see many types and symbols and just to reference back to what we just read he says and the Old Testament is the shadow of the coming of Christ and everything foreshadowed the cross so when we look at the pattern of the tabernacle and the wilderness might there's so many things that can be drawled from the order and the way that this was set up that brother Branham he would always say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he said if you don't see Jesus Christ in every line go back and read it again now as we look at this pattern of the tabernacle we should be able to see Jesus Christ in the pattern of his house and in the tabernacle and in the outer courts and in the inner courts and in the holiest of all ways we can actually see the whole plan of redemption we can actually see it what God was forecasting his very heart's desire was laying in that pattern there in the tabernacle a prophet says in things that are to be he says now we know that Moses in building the Tabernacle in the wilderness or preparing it he said he made all after the order of what he saw in heaven see so the earthly flings only express what the eternal things are so when you look at the pattern of the tabernacle you're not looking at necessarily a something temporal though that was done away with but it was in type or or in a pattern of something that he saw in heaven something that was eternal and so when we look at the natural it's giving us a foresight or something that we know is eternal in the heavens and so as we as we go through here if if that was a pattern we can look at the Old Testament to better understand the New Testament so the earthly things only express what the eternal things are and if this earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and see the flowers and things if this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do it the earthly Tabernacle is only expressing the eternal and that's what we're going back to he's taking us back to Eden and as you as you start to study and look through the order of the Tabernacle you can actually see how God even in that pattern is taking us back to Eden back to the Tree of Life and in study in the tabernacle we can actually understand the pattern in the plan of God more than ever before because the seals are open so what is the purpose of the tabernacle in Exodus 20:5 it says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them now you're seeing God's heart's desire of what his purpose was and he says in verse 22 and there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee a commandment under the children of Israel so if you just start to look at it you know David was a man after God's own heart when Israel was wanting a king and and Saul had transgressed the word of the Lord what did God tell Sam he said look don't look on the outside man looks on the outside but God looks at the heart and the scripture says that that God desired desired one after his heart we know that David was a man after God's own heart and as I thought about that you know if anybody knew how to praise and worship God it was David David knew how to praise and worship the Lord and God was seeking a man after his own heart and we know the scripture says that they've got God as a spirit and they that worship Him worship Him in spirit and in truth and as we looked at our text there in Psalms 27 David there is reflecting the very desire of God that he's wanting to dwell in the house of the Lord he's all of the days of his life he he wanted to be in that secret place he's he's here expressing God's very heart purpose in the reason why he even designed and and and built the tabernacle because the scripture says he wanted them to make a sanctuary that he could dwell amongst his people that he could have communion with them David just didn't want to enter into part of it but David wanted to go all the way into that secret place that's where the Ark of the Covenant is if you just you just look at that there and and kind of you have that as you come into that east gate there on the bottom right and you move into the outer courts there you see the altar you go a little further and there's the ladder where the priests would wash and then you have to go in through the first veil and through that first veil you come into the holy place and there you see the the lampstand and the table of showbread you see the altar of incense right before the veil but David wanted to go through that second veil he wanted to go in there into that Shekinah Laurey just going back to that picture of looking at that Tabernacle and thinking about the Shekinah glory and the presence of the Lord imagine what it would have been like to be there where God was veiling himself behind badger skins talk about a peculiar people look at the order look at the leadership I'd love to been there I would love to seen that what a reverence I think it would have would have maybe brought from our hearts thinking that you could actually go down to that place and you could actually enter into a building there and know that God was veiling himself behind badger skins what kind of reverence would you have for that think of what would happen if maybe we could take a journey right now down through that aisle and we could come down there and there was the east gate and we had our sacrifice and now we could just enter in through that east gate there and there the priest would be there to receive the sacrifice and there would be that the brass altar there and to know that just behind the veil there was that one that was up there on Mount Sinai there was the one that framed the world there was the creator of heavens were not not that far away oh my what a reverence what would oh what a humility would that would that cost within you but know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwell in you well it's so easy to maybe in the natural put so much reverence on something we can see touch taste hear feel smell and all would be so easy to maybe worship and be so easy to enter in but yet what is the Lord telling us know ye not this is 1st Corinthians 3:16 he says know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple ye are look this illustration brings a great sobriety just being able to look at it and think of what God has entrusted you with a sacred trust ye are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you are the dwelling place of God and I think we take it for granted I think we fail to to really realize and reverence the calling and the position and the place that God has given to his bride because all as God was dealing with my heart I I sitting on I look at this but then as you look into Hebrews I believe it is as Paul starts to Mohnish he goes if if those things were glorious if the things that were temporal we're glorious and we're going to be done away with how much more glory are those things which are eternal how much more glorious are these things that that God desired to integrin Akal himself in your skin oh and this is a tabernacle that he's not gonna do away with but this is a communion and a fellowship this is something that's this is his desire that he's had in his heart all along and now we just look in the wilderness and we see maybe a type-o we see a little bit of a shadow and we think of how how just maybe all struck it would been had been to be in that order but to think as Paul is admonishing us here see know ye not that ye are the temple of God look when Moses came into the presence of the burning bush Moses take off your shoes for your unholy ground Joshua one time in the heat of the battle it came against the captain of the the armies of the Lord and and and already four surfer against us I'm the captain of the host of the armies the Lord take off my shoes for you that where thou standest is holy ground he took off his shoes I was I'm wondering maybe have we got so busy how have we gotten so busy with life and that we forgot to even reverence the temple of God do we just kind of feed on anything kind of entertained just anything kind of just get by with anything but no as you as you maybe you look at this pattern in the Old Testament I play God would deal with our hearts tonight as I look at this pattern in the Old Testament it's helping God bring a greater reverence to the tabernacle that he wants to dwell in oh just believe it it's the word I know it's hard but ye are the Temple of the Lord it matters how you dress it matters how you live it matters how you act and so as the prophets Dornish you could look at the Old Testament to better understand the New Testament and how people my goodness how people how they can be deceived that God doesn't care how you dress what's God just wasting his time for 4,000 years Moses do all this and do all that but it really doesn't matter no God cares he cares about his dress I would encourage you maybe task the Lord Lord are you pleased with the way that I'm dressed nor the high priest had to dress in such a perfect way when he would come into your presence everything had to be an order because if he didn't he would die or maybe as the bride of Jesus Christ and miss Jesus Christ we ought to start coming to our husband saying Lord do you like this shirt are you pleased with this Lord if you're not why don't you convict me Lord and if I can't hear from you maybe you can use one of the older sisters or maybe one of the brothers Lord can can speak to me Oh does are we open for correction are we open for accountability are we ready to come into our position in Jesus Christ what did our pastor say look in order to be adopted you have to be obedient you can't be adopted if you're not obedient and we're going to keep living the way we're living and dressing the way we're living and halfway coming to church and think we're going to be adopted and going a body change I say lord help me to catch a revelation help me to be obedient to your word help me to get that revelation that this is the temple of the Lord and may all of my thoughts may all of my actions may all of my works may all of my thinking may when I get up may when I go to bed may when I speak to my wife may when I speak to my children when I discipline them and work and talking to the brothers and talking to the sisters and going to the grocery store and when I go out to eat may it be you Lord living through me and may be a sweet savour offer it up to your life that's a pleasing sacrifice unto you just continuing on in this message a hidden life can y'all read that okay now I believe that this is the time that the church has arrived at today that the next great move in the church is for God after we've seen the false alarms but now God will place in his church correctly apostles prophets teachers evangelists not made man cinamon seminaries boughten but God will place in the church not theology run overs and overnights but God will place in the church as God has chosen as the Holy Ghost has tutored this church and raised it up and in their God will adopt into his into the position his sons they're already his sons but whether they are worthy of the position that he has for them now not that they're not worthy to be a son you always were a son you always were an eagle but are you an obedient son those I love I chastise I correct sometimes it struck me years ago that some people think that the trials they're going through are just part of the Christian life and being afflicted of the devil but maybe it's the correction of God trying to get your attention and to show you you're not living right and you keep chalking it up that oh my it's just I'm a Christian and it's hard to be the bride of Jesus Christ when the reason you keep going through cycles over and over and over is because you're not being obedient to the Word of God look we're talking about being tutored we're talking about being positionally placed that means the old chisel gots to come off and some of us you know we need the big old chisel hammer Lord just I need you to take like a 250 pound chip off this side and big old chip off that side I mean I need blocks falling off you know just talk and some people you know he got up a little fine little file but it's all part of it we got to start somewhere if you'll notice in a perfect type God did his own son the same way he taken three witnesses where the mouth of two or three witnesses every word be established Peter James and John love faith and hope are we all together here believe we are and he taken them up the mountain apart from the rest of the world and there before official witnesses God adopted his own son he was transfigured before them and his raiment did shine as the Sun and a voice out of a cloud said this is my beloved son hear ye him set him up upon the mountain put the witnesses there to see it clothed him in a robe and a bright as the sun shining even shine like the Sun and his strength and God spoke out this is my beloved son hear him God adopted his own child into the family hear me no longer but this is my son who takes over from here in that adoption is near the time in parable of the church it's time for that this is 1955 and it's time for that that's what our pastors been going through why cry speak hear ye him I love what what other David pointed out at the end of service he said that God was wanting to take it from God doing it to Moses doing it he was in the line of duty Church you're in the line of duty why cry speak I so moves upon my heart of brother Chris Harris's testimony he come down he was he was doing the best he knew to do coming down a once a month for service you know one day were sitting around fellowshiping and something struck him you know what I want to be in church every time he was in the line of duty so you know what he did he drove right back home walked into his bosses off and said I'm moving to Dallas been with the company 12 13 years with that status and position and this boss is like are you crazy you're just going to let lose everything I'm in the line of duty why cry speak I don't got to come beg I don't come to hey you know boss will you let me go to church maybe kind of you know I'm trying to go in a rapture and and I need to be obedient and I was just hoping if you maybe couldn't get salt with the god of this evil age and see if he might want to give me Sundays off look church you don't have to do it you don't have to do it now you do it you enter and behind the veil and let God speak to you okay don't don't take this the wrong way what I'm wanting to say by the Holy Spirit of Lord that you can enter into a place in a hidden life where God can so orchestrate your life that you can move into a situation like that and the outcome will be according to the desire of your heart to serve the Lord because you're in the line of duty and I believe a testimony like that of what brother Chris did can encourage you that if the desires there for you look if the desires not there you're not going to be there you don't desire to be a communion yeah you're not going to be there but I want to encourage you that if the desires there and it's according to the word then it's a promise that you can receive now the Prophet just moving progressing through the message here he says now let's drop back to the hidden life and find out what this is going to require to get into this place of adoption a hidden life we realized that in the Old Testament under the Mosaic law as we found out and there any reader knows that there were two veils two compartments and a congregation in the setup of God's Tabernacle in the wilderness the first was the congregation then the holy place then the holiest of Holies that's God's house that's God's dwelling place that's your dwelling place now you only live in a three-room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens but you only live in a three-room house now if you follow that out brother branham talks about how you have a place you eat a parlor where you would hang out in a place that you would sleep so if you have 10 of each he's saying that there's really only three rooms functional rooms that comprise the house and he goes on to say God lived in a three room house when God was on earth he occupied a three room house the sole body and spirit of Jesus Christ so you can start to see how in the tabernacle was even a type of the body it was God's dwelling place remember we said know ye not that ye are the temple of the Lord and you just start to look at the outer court here and and you can see the first pool body five senses justification all of these things are types and as you would come into the outer court there if you look at that you have the bronze altar there and so you would come in from the congregation you would move in to the outer court there and that's where you would come and offer your sacrifice that's where you would come and bring your your sheep or your lamb or whatever if it was a sacrifice of repentance or of worship that's where you would come and the Prophet is showing how that even the tabernacle is the wilderness was a type of the very bodies that we live in and such an amazing thing to behold and to see and a scripture says I don't know if we have it in here but in 2nd Corinthians 5:21 it says for he F made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him when you came into this outer Court you brought a sacrifice that was the only way to come in and approach God the first thing you had to do is that altar there had to be a sacrifice given the blood had to be applied and once the blood had been been applied oh then you could have boldness therefore we can come boldly to the throne of grace asking for mercy for grace to come to us in a time of need once the the blood has been applied once we believe so first justification you're seeing that here in the inner court Maya the time is just running away wow we're going to just have to finish this another time praise the Lord because if we finish this tonight would be a lock in praise the Lord so as you as you would come and approach the first thing you had to do was you the blood had to be applied but then as you follow on the pattern from there then what had to happen the priest would come to the bronze LaBrie there and then they would and there they would wash being cleansed unto the Lord and then as you would progress you would come into the holy place which is the inner Court which in type you can see the second pool we have the spirit now remember the prophet showed us that the tabernacle was a type of the body so you have the outer Court now you're coming into the inner court and here's where the spirit the imaginations conscience memory reason affection and this is a type of sanctification and when sanctification is being wrought in your life you're being cleansed and you're being sanctified and you're being set aside for service so we have to go through a cleansing we have to go through a process of where our life is being sanctified and if you just look at the the the the inner court there you can see the table of showbread and the lampstand and the altar of incense and my just even in this wind maybe if the Lord would lead another time you can actually see as when John writes revelation everything he is writing is in symbols and he's referring to the Old Testament and that's what he talks about the the the golden lampstands and that's being the seven churches you can see all of those types later right there in in the church in the church ages and brother Branham even later in this sermon I don't think we'll get to there but he's talking about the inner court and these things in the furniture of the inner court and showing that how you can perfectly see in the setting of the tabernacle you can see a justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost and see those steps of restoration coming down you can see this progression what you come into into the tabernacle there at the altar now it's justification and now you're we're washing in the in the lab or there now you're entering in into justification and where do you move on from justification now you keep progressing you've been sanctified you've been set aside for service and then we enter into the holiest of Holies and that's where oh my that's where my heart's crying that the Church of the Living God would be living and abiding and hidden away in there and it's not no mystery on how to get there Church for by one spirit are we all baptized into the body jesus said in John 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they're and I look brother branham said you don't have to beg you don't have to plead and you don't have to tarry he said that's over they had to tarry for fifty days there at Pentecost but he said that's over when Peter yet spake these words they received the Holy Ghost there's no more waiting after that the prophecies right now you can receive it just have a willing heart reach right up to God believe it and accept it we see the type there in the holiest of Holies there the third pull the soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost we just find a place all right we're having some technical difficulties that's right we're almost we're almost over so in the temple he's in a congregation a holy place and the holiest of Holies each one of them was separated one from the other and each one had different furniture in it to show the dwelling place a very beautiful type of the church the center first comes into the kitchen as it was the kitchen is where you eat the living room is where you communion in the bedroom is where you rest Oh God see see the sinner comes in I'll just read this to you I'm not sure this is all progressing just right see the sinner comes in faith cometh by hearing hearing the word he comes and eats the word then he's baptized into the faith and accepts Christ as his personal Savior brings him in then to commune with God but then he moves on into the bedroom the steal quietness with God were all things of the world is shut out and he's alone in the stillness with God brethren sisters that's the place this Pentecostal move ought to be today not so much babbling word Trinity we're Methodists were Assemblies we're Church of God we ought to be alone in that quiet stillness with God don't you believe that certainly we ought to be there many people claim to be the tabernacle to be the dwelling place of God but the question is does he have three minutes in your life in Christ the mystery brother Branham says if ye abide in me and my word my word abide in you then ask what you will because you in the word are the same he has the preeminence he's got the rulership you're a prisoner to him the world is dead you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you're a prisoner you're yoked with him my yoke is easy yoke twith Christ his word I do that only which pleases the father why because you're living a hidden life in Jesus Christ you have now entered in behind the veil all the prophets says he says oh that perfect rest to come from the congregation to the altar and from the altar to the bosom of Christ the bed the night the secret place the resting place maybe if the musicians would come we'll find a place just to finish here just reading out a second Corinthians will still be progressing a little further in these slides so if we could leave those up that would be great second Corinthians 3:6 says and such trusts have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory now think of this if the ministration of condemnation be glory why because the letter killeth if the ministration of combination be glory much more dull administration of righteousness exceed and glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect oh we're looking at that pillar of fire well we're looking at that Tabernacle we're looking at the order of the temple and the people are capped all the way around it for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that Excel ahthe for if that which was done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious ye are the temple of the Lord you realize how glorious that is that's a pillar of fire would want to settle down upon this congregation how many little it's a fire the holy ghost and dwelling in you and in you and in you and at you until those nine spiritual gifts that are were gained to operate in the local body to start working in harmony and unity we all start stepping into our positions in the door places and having a books of Acts all of it if that ever puts forth another branch oh brother Matthew they're taking away from the power of God in this church today and the healings and the signs that are that are happening no I'm not doing that but I'm saying there's more there's more I want adoption I want to be in my place I want to be in my position I don't want to be holding up the show I want to be behind the veil living in the secret place maybe next time if the Lord would lead this is just kind of a setting of the tabernacle you can seek just the names of the camps of Israel around the tabernacle and my I would feel like I was shortchanged if I just didn't read this I want to read this because brother Branham here and preaching revelations chapter 4 he's on the blackboard and he's drawing all this out and oh I wish I could have seen it but he's actually showing how you can see the pattern of the Garden of Eden and you can see the pattern of the tabernacle and you can see the pattern of the things in heaven and all as as Adam and Eve were were driven out to the east and there was cherubims guarding the Tree of Life there at the east gate brother Brent says that's where Cain and Abel came and they were all kurds offer a sacrifice he said why was it there because the altar had moved there to the east gate so they had to come to the east gate when God patterned the tabernacle he showed what's through the way back to the Tree of Life you got to come right through that east gate you got to come through the east gate there and you got to come to the altar of sacrifice and then into the holiest of Holies and then go in behind the veil I believe we have this so we can read this [Music] just as we maybe let's just stand we're not gonna be labor but I just want you all to listen to read this this is beautiful therefore the Lord sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and placed them at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims flaming swords which turns every way see those four beasts there's only four ways you can go see east north west and south these Chairman's had flaming swords at the gate of the garden to keep the way of the Tree of Life because if man ever got ahold of the Tree of Life then he could live forever and these cherubims first mentioned was placed at the east gate of the garden going four ways I should have made it a little different from that I can't do it justly to God's orders and things like that just so y'all know what I mean so he's referring to the blackboard there there's the Garden of Eden and this is the gate right here opens up here and swings out and at this gate there was cherubims cherubims a remember doesn't say a cherubim it says cherubims Cheerios was placed there to guard what the Tree of Life that's that's what they was to guard the way of the Tree of Life who is the way where is it reflected from here is the holy place here are the cherubim sees he's making this whole diagram and layout here now watch put it all down here is the holiest of Holies here's the holiest of holies this is the holy place and here's the see there and watch the light the candles the seven that reflects the light from here and here and here and here see what do they reflect they are guarding and reflecting with the fire of God the way to the Tree of Life now I pray that I'm just peeking your intrest right now we don't have time to go through this but maybe you can go dig in and start looking into it study the message and you could see this how beautiful this type is of what God was showing there in the Tabernacle in the wilderness see [Music] see it can't come from over here Presbyterian seminary or Pentecostal isn't sitting there it's got to come from here reflecting that light you notice these cherub loans that John saw here must have been interested in keeping the Tree of Life so there must be interested in human beings Regenesis getting back to Genesis they kept the Tree of Life guarded it the way of the Tree of Life how is the way Jesus said I am the way I am the bread that cometh from God out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever now there is the way back to that tree of life you get it now this is what I want to show show it now and make this shirt it's an altar now this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden and I'll tell you why do you remember both Cain and Abel come up here to worship so that showed that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you go again see back to Eden through the altar and they were to keep that way they're guarded that they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood Oh God can't people see it see it's nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat there this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat when this altar if the blood is lifted there will stand on that Judgment Day the fire of God's wrath to guard the tree of tree again only one thing will enter into the gate to eat McGinn will be through the blood of Jesus Christ you see it oh what a beautiful beautiful type we're looking about you can see if you look coming to that east gate there it's the way back to the Tree of Life and he said the most peculiar thing is that the altar had moved you know so many people get tied up when brother Branham preaches the breech and says the lamb had to leave the mercy seat to come and take the book and the scripture say I'm a hippie who'd be filthy be filthy still but all of you follow the blood trail this message is Grace to reject it as judgment this is the Word of God there's an altar there it's the way back while everybody was standing out in denominationalism all that outer darkness and chaos but he said come out from amongst her my people come back to the word that's where grace is Oh hallelujah just beyond [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] would Jesus try [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a minute rest that's what we desire to be in a secret place amen brother burner menaced I believe I can't remember the quote he speaks he said even if if God does the built the house he desired to dwell in it amen I believe tonight we just can just remember that the tabernacle that he built this body that he built is for him to come dwell in it and be manifesting it even if we could just make him that's what he does he's desiring the question is what do we desire and then I believe is our brother laid out tonight if we desire that he may come dwelling as I believe it's he will come and fulfill his desire in us amen brother Tommy if we could just come in this recess tonight [Music] spell Oh Heavenly Father long wage is so grateful Lord for the word you do never deceive me more as we see the time drawn closer Lord or we just want to draw closer to you or we want to get so close to you or that which is there's no separation between us and there just be just us just drawn together as like two magnets Lord we just want to be so close with you lord I don't know how to put it in words more but I know that the things that I see happening in everyday life Lord I just I know that your words they separate us Lord they separate us from everything in this world Lord or as we draw closer to you Lord we want to just be so separated from this world and so far from all the things around us Lord that all it is is just you and us or may we just continue to walk in your word Lord may we draw into the inner Court Lord or may your word just be our life Lord may you dwell in us daily Lord and just fill us with your spirit constantly Lord be refilling us lord if there be any doubt or any unbelief in us Lord we just ask that you take it out or separate us Lord you're the great separator Lord may there may there be no negativity Lord may there be no doubt Lord may all your words just rain true nor heart Lord or we just love you and thank you in Jesus Christ's name I bless you I dismay statement the more I see care [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
