And uh, I want to thank God because he gave me a song today &gt;&gt; to sing about his goodness because this morning I was meditating upon a scripture, the one our pastor preached upon this morning. So, it's an answered prayer and I'm still believing for more. Uh the song I'm going to sing it's um in Sha and it says which simply means God fulfill uh your word. Oh sharing. Ron send him meu T I do for Sing [Music] you multi multi. [Music] God bless you. [Applause] God bless you, saints. Amen. Um, just want to share a little testimony before I sing this song. Lately, I've done uh I've done seeing almost all hell break loose. you know, uh, Satan has just been attempting everything he can and he knows, you know, to try to sink my faith to try to just get me a little bit, you know, off of the right path. You know, coming to church, I've seen Satan in the last few three weeks maybe. I've seen fights after fights after fight. You know, at some point it's, you know, it's the sibling that's in the accident. And then later on it's you know it's sickness and then after that you wake up okay it's your car that's not broken and you know everything I've seen all kind of episodes but in the midst of it you know one testimony that I've kept throughout all of that season is you know we underestimate the power God has put in us you know where we had a situation going on our home all we could do is just pray you know you don't even know how to bring it to people it's like how do you ask for a prayer request saying this? But we've seen how faithful God is and it feels like you just start commanding everything around you. You pray about it and you see the thing come to pass and it scares you. It's like did I just ask for this? It sounds ridiculous but you did and God answered the prayer. Um very grateful. You know the devil was really attacking me internally but God has been there. So, I want to sing a song. If you know the song, please help me sing it. I don't know it that good, but I really just been wanting to sing it. So, the song is who I am. [Music] C Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free and my heart is very thrown. My life's no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine. And now I leave to praise his name. Who I am, Lord, who I am. I can see now who I am. A part of my Savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Who I am, Lord. Who I am. [Music] I can see now who I am. A part of my Savior. A part of his word. It's a revelation predestination of who I am on Calvary. Dine to redeem me very bright. The king of kings became my savior. This is God's great mystery of love expressed to me that Christ and none might be made one. Who I am Lord who I am. I can see now just who I am. A part of my savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. Who I am, Lord, who I am. I can see now who I am. A part of my savior, a part of his word. It's a revelation of who I am. God bless you. Amen. We have a prayer request here. Sister April writes, "Please keep me in prayer as I have a medical procedure next week." Thank you all. Hallelujah. We saw what God did for our sister who testified for us on Wednesday. We serve the God of the all the impossibles. Whether he chooses doctor's hands or he chooses a miracle, his power remains the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ask brother Jerome to come and take these. And if you had a need on your heart and you want to make it known to him by the uplifting of your hands, please do so. We'll ask the brothers that come in and take the tithes and offerings to please come up. [Music] Let us look to God in prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you once again for an opportunity to be found in your presence. Lord God, as many requests have gone forth from this altar prayer, you have been faithful over the years, Lord God, and you have answered by fire. We pray even now with the assurity that knows that whatever we ask in prayer believing by faith it shall be done. &gt;&gt; You simply said in your word if we would knock, if we would ask, you would answer. Lord God, I pray and ask in the name of Jesus that you would continue to minister and to move in such a mighty way. I pray for this ministry, Lord God, and those who you have called to minister to the needs of our hearts. I pray and ask even now that you would anoint every speaker that speaks over this pull pit. That you would give him a word of hope and deliverance to lift heavy burdens from the hearts of your people. Lord God, there are those who are in the audience, Lord God, who have been afflicted, Lord God. Oh, and our faith may be too weak, Lord God, to touch the hem of your garment. But we pray even now, Lord God, that you would encourage us and you would strengthen us and that you would increase our faith, Lord God, that we would have the faith to speak to the mountains in our lives and say, "Be thou removed and to be cast into yonder sea, Lord God. Oh Lord, I believe in you, Lord God." But we even pray, Lord God, help me in my unbelief, Lord God, that I will continue to trust you and place all my faith and confidence in you, Lord God. I pray if there's any sick among us tonight, Lord God, I pray that through the preaching of the word, Lord God, that by faith they might be healed. Lord God, if there's one seeking salvation and deliverance from a habit, I pray even now through the foolishness of preaching, Lord God, one might be saved. Lord God, I pray for every family that's assembled here, Lord God. I pray even now that you would begin to watch over us, Lord God. I pray even now that the blood would be applied upon every doorpost that is represented here, Lord God. For I know that if the blood is applied, Lord God, you would pass over, Lord God. I know that if we are your people and we're covered by your blood, Lord God, you would protect us from every disease, Lord God. And the cares and the troubles of this world, even though they might buffet us, they would not overwhelm us, Lord God. If we would walk through the water, Lord God, it would not consume us. If we would go through the fire, it would not consume us even now. We pray and ask in the name of Jesus that you would bless and ministers, Lord God. Heavenly Father, tonight my soul is thirsty and I need a refreshing, Lord God, I pray even now that you would touch the minister heart. even the direction that they've studied and wanted to go. I pray even now that you would speak to their hearts and give them your way, Lord God, that they would hide themselves behind your cross and speak only your word. For we ask and pray in the name of Jesus. We pray a blessing upon the offering tonight. We ask that it may be used for the further of your kingdom. For it's in Jesus holy name we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. As we sing the song, we want to remember these these were special moments. You know, we don't we don't want to get accustomed and used to just coming to church. You know, our prophet says we got to work on our spur of the moment. When that pulsation comes and you hear something that's directly for you, you got to grab a hold of it. He is the God that fights for you. He is the God of your victory and you got to claim it. If not, you keep coming back and back and back again and nothing changes. But this is a leaving message. Let's sing this song with all our hearts. He is my God that fights for me. The Lord of my victory. Whatever you have need of, he's more than able to grant it to you. Hallelujah. I won't forget the words that you brought. Liberate the exitation of my heart. You stop me. You free me. Oh God for me. Lord of everything. Hallelujah. Oh, you have to see. You have me through. Hallelujah. The cloud by day is a sign that you are with me. My God, [Music] you found me. free. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, you have the sea. You have me through that second verse. My name is you are with me. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] for me for you. [Music] You have made me hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. You stand to my knees. Let's all stand. You took me by the hand. You mar me out of freedom into the promised land. I will not. I'll sing the you forever by the fury of your love. You step into my [Music] you to me by the day. You mar me out of freom into the promised land. And I will not for you this forever my God who fight for me for me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You take me through hallelu this time. You're the God who fights for me. Lord of everything. Hallelujah. Oh hallelu. Oh you have to wonder the sea. You have made me free. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Just your voices. Oh you're the God who fights for me. Lord of every victory. Hallelu. [Applause] Oh hallelujah. And you have to the sea. You have led me through the deep. Hallelu. [Music] Oh hallelu. Lord God, you're the God who fights for me. Lord of everything for me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; God our father. &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful you are. [Music] Because where men think thought it was impossible, &gt;&gt; you were able to open up the Red Sea. [Music] &gt;&gt; You were you are able to lead us in all circumstances. And it's you that invited us here tonight. &gt;&gt; Here we are, Lord. that you may give to us that which you have reserved for us &gt;&gt; as you talk as you told us this morning. &gt;&gt; You blessed us by your word &gt;&gt; and tonight we're waiting upon you. &gt;&gt; Come Lord, come Lord &gt;&gt; as we are committing everything into your hands &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; I believe we once again happy to be in the house of God tonight. &gt;&gt; As we're still standing, we'll take our Bibles in this uh book of 2 Corinthians chapter 10. &gt;&gt; We're going to read the first uh five verses. Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 10. Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ who is present whose presence and based among you but being absent and bold towards you. But I beseech you that I may not be bold when I'm present with you. Thy confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as we walked according to the flesh. For we we for we for through the flesh. Though we walk through we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh. [Music] For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of the stronghold. casting down imagination and every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's also turn to Hebrews chapter 11. &gt;&gt; It's a very familiar scripture reading &gt;&gt; that we love so much. Hebrews 11. &gt;&gt; Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report, visible. Through faith, we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things that do appear. The Lord blessing the reading of his word. You have your seats. We're once again happy to be gather in the house of God tonight [Music] and I believe we all appreciated the word of God this morning by may God bless richly brother David &gt;&gt; I was uh out missing I was out uh for two months &gt;&gt; I was in Africa [Music] I spent a couple of uh days in in France for a friend who invited me to go preach the word uh for him during Easter. &gt;&gt; I also spent time with my mom also in France &gt;&gt; and I went uh to Africa and spent two months over there. The Lord has helped me throughout my uh travel. As for the uh professional uh side of it, what which is what I went to do &gt;&gt; uh on the spiritual side, &gt;&gt; I preach at brother Raphael's church in Brazville. Sister Leslie, my mom has almost the same blessing as sister Leslie. She has three boys and all the three boys are preachers. &gt;&gt; Older brother is has a church and I was I had the opportunity to go preach for him. &gt;&gt; It was wonderful. I am back home &gt;&gt; and I thank you all for all your prayers &gt;&gt; and your support and God bless you richly and I was very excited this morning as I heard brother David and brother Brennham when he was commenting on those message this morning. what the Lord has placed on my heart tonight. Something that goes in that same vein. &gt;&gt; I'm going to uh get uh come up with my little exhortation for tonight [Music] of verse five of 2 Corinthian chapter 10 where Paul says, We are casting down imaginations and every reasoning that lift itself up against the word of God. I know when I read in my English version of my Bible, it's saying that we are reversing all imagination. And on the side there's a there's a commentating where that could be replaced by reasoning. &gt;&gt; It's a imagination or reasoning and asam told us this morning and it's not to for us to lean upon our understanding or knowledge. And when we when we rest upon our knowledge, &gt;&gt; we are reasoning. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are even reasoning we are imagining. But when we rest upon that, it will certainly take us away from the word of God because God has never placed reasoning &gt;&gt; to lead us. And this inspiration came to me. &gt;&gt; It was Wednesday morning. &gt;&gt; We had finished praying with my family &gt;&gt; and I told him we're going to take time to listen to 15 minutes of sermon. &gt;&gt; It was the super sign. And when we put it, we we realized that 15 minutes was not enough. Finally, we ended up listening to the whole message and I I came to the understanding that God is leading us to something beyond our reasoning. listening to the testimony that brother was giving him in that message &gt;&gt; to say that scientifically we have no evidence, no explanation, &gt;&gt; that God sent us a message that God confirmed the prophet that would bring us to things that nobody can explain. Even our own human reasoning cannot explain it. In the brother tells a testimony &gt;&gt; that he was somewhere with Billy Paul. Oh, &gt;&gt; there were young men that that had been in an accident and the car had flipped and it was laying on on on top of one of the young men. And the others had gone out. And those that had gone out were trying to pull their friend. And he was crying out saying that don't do that. You're going to kill me. You're going to do don't do it. You're going to kill me. And comes. He asked him if he was a Christian. He said he was not a Christian, but Ram said it would be good that you be a Christian. He said, "Oh, I want to be that." And but says all of the sudden the six sense came on the scene and he just started making steps around the car. He didn't pray. He didn't say a word. And the car came back to to to to over on out from on top of him &gt;&gt; and the boy came out without a problem. Can human reasoning explain that and how reasoning can bring us to doubt of that word. how that reasoning can bring us to doubt even the message &gt;&gt; and even Paul like Paul tonight. &gt;&gt; I pray that I pray that God may help me &gt;&gt; that we may reverse all reasoning &gt;&gt; and my title tonight [Music] &gt;&gt; is faith casting down reasoning. Because this message that we have received even like what David was saying it this morning &gt;&gt; the the the point is this uh today. Many preachers have brought their own interpretation of the message instead of preaching the message. One day I was uh uh talking with a friend I said maybe one day I would like to uh uh uh have do a a documentary &gt;&gt; where I'm going to try to film all the preachers of the message where every one of them is saying that you have to say exactly what the message said. They all say that &gt;&gt; but they're contradicting themselves. If it means they're not saying what the message said, like brother David said this morning, &gt;&gt; they give you a MacBook, &gt;&gt; we are all in one accord. &gt;&gt; They give you the message. &gt;&gt; Everybody has their own point of view. &gt;&gt; And when each one has their own way of viewing it, It means they are those that are resting upon their own intelligence. They are those that are resting upon their own reasoning. &gt;&gt; God sent us a message that doesn't need reasoning &gt;&gt; that doesn't need interpretation. Because when you interpret, &gt;&gt; you are making the message of non effect. But when you say exactly what the message is saying, &gt;&gt; the message will bring forth the faith that's needed because the the the the very uh uh need for the message or the objective of the message is to bring us so we can have rapturing faith. But if we don't have faith to doubt our own reasoning, How can we have the faith for the rapture that's contained in the message? &gt;&gt; Then it's very important for us &gt;&gt; to be like Paul to do &gt;&gt; that each one of us &gt;&gt; to cast down by faith &gt;&gt; your own reasoning. It's not that brother Paul is going to reverse your reasoning that you yourself will take hold of the word that you will take hold of the message that you will cast any reasoning that comes against that message. And to today we have the impression. We have a message from Africa. &gt;&gt; We have a message for Europe. &gt;&gt; We have a message for America. There's no different messages. &gt;&gt; There is only one message. &gt;&gt; And that message is what the brotherham said. It doesn't need any interpretation. It doesn't need for me to go and grab my cultural things. But I take things from my tradition that I may take it and try to transform it into the message. It's not going to work. The message has to remain the message. what the message says. &gt;&gt; That's what the most important thing is. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to give us life. &gt;&gt; It's not what the family says. &gt;&gt; It's not what my tradition says. &gt;&gt; I have a friend who's a preacher. &gt;&gt; He had a a church in Spain. One day he was just sending comments in social media. [Music] He said that for him a young man who didn't give the dollar, &gt;&gt; he's not going to bless that wedding because the dollar is in the Old Testament. It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; So I sent him a message. I said, "My friend, if it's the word, &gt;&gt; that's the your the brothers in Spain, the white &gt;&gt; before they get married, do you obligate them to give dollars?" He never responded to that because if it's the message, because they say, "Well, Bernham didn't really say anything about it. It's not really in the American culture. &gt;&gt; It's not true. Brother Brandham preached the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached the message. &gt;&gt; If the Valerie was in something that was needed in the Bible, brother was going to mention it and say about it in the message, white, black, no matter who you are that it's the word of God. But you have to do it. &gt;&gt; If he didn't say it, &gt;&gt; then don't interpret the message. &gt;&gt; Say that, "Brother, I I desire to to remain in my culture." &gt;&gt; But don't say it's the message. You are You are free to reason. You are free to take whatever you want from your culture. But like Paul by faith, &gt;&gt; we want to reverse every reason &gt;&gt; and and and keep the message pure. You can do whatever you want, but don't justify it by the message of the hour. Brother says &gt;&gt; in wisdom versus faith &gt;&gt; preach uh uh April 1st 62 &gt;&gt; paragraph &gt;&gt; paragraph 263 now look Satan could scientifically prove by his wisdom Now I'm going to play the role of a doctor for here. Satan could prove scientifically by his wisdom that the soil that he was going to give for the human race to grow it, the soil had vitamins. Sure he did. He could scientifically prove it. They can scientifically prove anything they want to almost see. Sure. If you can prove that this soil had vitamins, &gt;&gt; so he can attract you to what belongs to the soil to from everything that belongs to the world. vitamin. &gt;&gt; It had the vitamin P, &gt;&gt; pleasure, popularity. &gt;&gt; Vitamin P. &gt;&gt; That's vitamin P &gt;&gt; that's in the world. &gt;&gt; It's in there. &gt;&gt; It's in it's it's in his wisdom soil. &gt;&gt; Sure, all all worldly pleasures, all the picture shows and all the dances and all things. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. That's That's all right. &gt;&gt; Won't hurt nothing. &gt;&gt; See popularity. &gt;&gt; Popularity. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are the biggest church there is in the city. Vitamin C. &gt;&gt; All right. It had the vitamin C in it which he referred to as common sense. &gt;&gt; Vitamin C. &gt;&gt; Vitamin C. &gt;&gt; Uh make make reasons. It's logical. &gt;&gt; You can't you can't let the daughter just go like that. &gt;&gt; Vitamin C. &gt;&gt; It's vitamin C. The make sense. &gt;&gt; It had vitamin R, &gt;&gt; which means reasoning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He had reason. He could reason. You see that won't work. vitamin B. &gt;&gt; He had vitamin uh uh vitamin B &gt;&gt; which means beauty. &gt;&gt; Satan is beautiful. &gt;&gt; Sin is beautiful. &gt;&gt; And sin sin began to get more and more beautiful it becomes. It's the vitamin that that the devil is placed here on earth that the devil has placed here on earth to attract us. How much better house we got today than the log house. How much more prettier it is. How much prettier is our women today than they used to be. See, [Music] how much prettier is Florida uh is now uh and the way God created it. See &gt;&gt; it's got beauty. &gt;&gt; How much know how many knows that Satan is beautiful? Beauty. &gt;&gt; How he desire beauty &gt;&gt; and he tried to create a beauty uh uh more beautiful kingdom &gt;&gt; and so forth. Sure. We know that Satan is in the beauty. Now notice vitamin A. &gt;&gt; He had the vitamin R &gt;&gt; which which is reasoning. Vitamin B &gt;&gt; which is beauty, vitamin N, &gt;&gt; vitamin B, &gt;&gt; which is modern. &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to be more than just take his knowledge and find out if you don't believe that stuff. It will grow right in you. That that vitamin will come right where you are sitting. uh some fellow stand up and gives you some kind of some some of his knowledge. Now look friend, what would it be if we would take this great lovely cathedral here and had a lot of screaming and and crying &gt;&gt; and speaking in tongues &gt;&gt; and running up and down the floor. floating of mouth like mad dogs. This is the things that we see today in the message churches. &gt;&gt; People dance like they dance in the world and that's what's more than it's the vitamin M &gt;&gt; that Satan is placed into the world &gt;&gt; that we are bringing into the church. &gt;&gt; We want to take All vitamins that's in the world vitamin mo &gt;&gt; vitamin A modern &gt;&gt; vitamin B &gt;&gt; vitamin vitamin B beautiful &gt;&gt; things do the things that the world is doing &gt;&gt; vitamin R like reasoning brother there's nothing wrong with that I heard like a preacher from a denominational preacher saying &gt;&gt; he was saying in in Lingala in Congo He said that days come from heaven &gt;&gt; and we are in the time of restitution. [Laughter] So this this vulgar dance &gt;&gt; was coming from heaven &gt;&gt; and it's time for us to take it back. What? What? What? Uh uh uh uh complete uh nonsense. &gt;&gt; Vitamin M. &gt;&gt; Vitamin M. and they're running up and down the floor or the the the frauding like off the mouth like a mad dog. [Music] I said I said what do you think of the mayor of the city would say deacon board and and if we would uh uh uh permitting such such stuff as to come here. &gt;&gt; Oh sure it's more than Paragraph 273. &gt;&gt; We want to be modern. See, &gt;&gt; that's the devil's wisdom. You know, even in Africa &gt;&gt; in in in the the diary was something that was made to be symbolic &gt;&gt; where the family they would just give something symbolic. &gt;&gt; Now it's become a &gt;&gt; a a public uh show a public sale. and with an an amount that depends on on who the buyer is. Continue. &gt;&gt; We continue. You see, it's the wisdom. That's the devil's wisdom. That's what it grows. That's the vitamin that's in the soil that comes out of the product that it produced. &gt;&gt; I love that. &gt;&gt; It's the That's the vitamin in the soil that comes out in the product that is produced. &gt;&gt; We're going to see a little bit down. that it's not the seed, &gt;&gt; but it's the vitamin. &gt;&gt; So, you can have the seed of God. &gt;&gt; God has a seed in you. But if you take vitamin K, &gt;&gt; vitamin M, &gt;&gt; vitamin M, &gt;&gt; vitamin A, &gt;&gt; vitamin R, &gt;&gt; vitamin B, &gt;&gt; vitamin B, &gt;&gt; you will produce the things of the world. &gt;&gt; But you have the seed in you. &gt;&gt; We want to reverse all of those vitamins to bring the vitamin that will produce your true nature. the nature that correspond to the seed that's in you. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; paragraph 274. That's the vitamin that's in the soil that comes out in the product that is that it produced. &gt;&gt; Go on you more than Jezebel. All right. &gt;&gt; Modern like like women today of today. Sure. Oh, modern. Well, the most modern people of the town will come to to to the church. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; It's God. Why? They grow in that vitam in the modern vitamin &gt;&gt; reasoning vitamin they grow in that see &gt;&gt; that's what it is in reasoning but as soon as you start growing in that you are dead to the word you have to deny the word before You can be that. When you reason, you are rejecting the word. &gt;&gt; You are basing yourself or setting yourself upon your own reasoning. The only way you could ever be a sinner is to deny God's word. What is sin? Unbelief. Unbelief in what? God's word. See, &gt;&gt; you have to deny the word. &gt;&gt; You have to deny the word first. Oh, I got about 10 more vitamins written down here &gt;&gt; that the devil &gt;&gt; is placed upon the earth &gt;&gt; to attract our attention to keep us away from the word, to bring us to reason the word. Because what God wants from us is not just to be church members or to and reason with the word. &gt;&gt; God wants us to be true Christians. He continued, &gt;&gt; he continues paragraph 17 uh 276. &gt;&gt; But here's one vitamin that he failed to tell them all to tell them to tell them. &gt;&gt; He had the vitamin D. &gt;&gt; It's the most that's the that's the biggest vitamin in there. &gt;&gt; Results death. Heam he's making you taste of all the other vitamins, &gt;&gt; but he's not telling you that behind all of those vitamins vitamin D, &gt;&gt; there is the vitamin D, vitamin, &gt;&gt; the vitamin of death. You see &gt;&gt; 281 &gt;&gt; Jesus said &gt;&gt; man lives by every word. &gt;&gt; Every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. Who said that? Jesus. That's right. He said, &gt;&gt; "If any other man said anything different, let him be a liar. &gt;&gt; His word, his word be true. &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth will pass away, &gt;&gt; but my word shall not pass. There you are." So vitamin D lays in his formula Martin. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, &gt;&gt; but the seed word of the Bible can't grow in such ground as that. The seed that God placed in you, &gt;&gt; the seed of God that's in you, he cannot grow &gt;&gt; when you when you are surrounded by all of these vitamins. You are you are suffocating the seed. You are preventing this seed from growing. It doesn't mean you don't have the seed. The seed is there, &gt;&gt; but it cannot grow because there's too many vitamins of the devil around it. 282. But now the word seed can grow in there. It says how can a person go into one of these modern church now &gt;&gt; the spirit of God come upon come come upon it they they they they want to holler &gt;&gt; glory to God hallelujah &gt;&gt; the seed of God &gt;&gt; the seed word &gt;&gt; cannot grow when we Deep reasoning vitamin &gt;&gt; vitamin M vitamin &gt;&gt; vitamin M modern vitamin &gt;&gt; I want to do modern things. [Music] &gt;&gt; I I I do it because if I don't do it they're going to look at me and they say I'm oldfashioned two 28 291 vitamin &gt;&gt; but faith only grows in one vitamin. &gt;&gt; It only had it only has one vitamin. &gt;&gt; Don't have to be to have any mix mixture vitamin. Faith grows in one vitamin. &gt;&gt; That's the word. Faith comes from what we're hearing, &gt;&gt; what we are hearing from the word of God. If we have other vitamins, the only way for us to get rid of all of the other vitamins is to to believe the word &gt;&gt; is to say amen to every word, even when it hurts, even it's against me, even when I feel like I won't be able to make a step. &gt;&gt; Just say amen and ask the Lord to help you. &gt;&gt; Don't reason. &gt;&gt; The devil will try to keep you in his R vitamin &gt;&gt; to keep reasoning, &gt;&gt; but the seed, &gt;&gt; the faith &gt;&gt; only need one vitamin. That's vitamin word. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that faith can grow in is the word. &gt;&gt; And the only way it can it can grow &gt;&gt; is because it believe the word. And he has to take the whole world and believe it's true vitamin and faith vitamin. He spelled in a little forward letter. life. Life has the vitamin L. &gt;&gt; It has the vitamin L. &gt;&gt; Faith has vitamin L. &gt;&gt; It's the only vitamin that we need. It's the only vitamin that allows us to move forward. &gt;&gt; It's the only vitamin that gives us life. Butam says &gt;&gt; in believers uh the believer's position in Christ &gt;&gt; uh preach uh January 16, 1955 &gt;&gt; paragraph 13. Now, now if we can find our position and know that it's the word that has promised it, that's the reason Joshua and Calb had no fear that they could take they could that they could not take the promised land. [Music] because all the rest of the nine came back uh or the 10 uh and said &gt;&gt; we can't do it. &gt;&gt; That's the vitamin R that we're talking &gt;&gt; we won't be able to do it. He said, "These cities are fortified and the walled and we're like grasshoppers on grasshoppers up on the this the people. &gt;&gt; They are so big and they are armed. &gt;&gt; Our five senses natural. &gt;&gt; We bring us to reasoning. Our eyes see &gt;&gt; our ears will hear &gt;&gt; and we'll touch will say no. &gt;&gt; I know God said it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But vitamin A &gt;&gt; vitamin R &gt;&gt; and you know what it does. &gt;&gt; It said we won't be we won't we can't do it. &gt;&gt; Those cities walled high And we look like grasshoppers. They are so big. They are so armed. &gt;&gt; And said, "We just can't do it." &gt;&gt; See, they were looking at the sense of reasoning. &gt;&gt; You can't look at the sense of reasoning. You've got to look at the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Now, God had already sent his angel and the angel was in the camp. &gt;&gt; Moving on. God has already sent us his angel and we know that &gt;&gt; and the revelation of God had brought the word of God manifested and now there was ready to push into the promised land. Therefore, Joshua and Caleb had all the promise. All the promises was to them. For God had promised he was going to give them the land. God has already given us all the promises. We are like Caleb and Joshua today. God gave us all the promises. And he says, [Applause] A pill of fire formed over them and they followed it. And here it was right up here at the promised land now ready to push over. So he could believe it because God's promise are in is infallible. They are the truth. It's the reasoning that brings us to not believe that the promises of God are infallible. &gt;&gt; Even in our lives when we think we don't have greater manifestations, You look at the little things that God is doing. &gt;&gt; I remember I had a friend who was a deacon in France. &gt;&gt; He had a a child who was about seven, eight years old. &gt;&gt; His name was David. &gt;&gt; I was with him. I was playing with a little kid. And I said, "Oh, David, &gt;&gt; how can you have a great name like David?" &gt;&gt; You know, David in the Bible, &gt;&gt; he he killed the the the the uh uh bear. &gt;&gt; He killed a lion and he killed Goliath. &gt;&gt; And you you you you buried you carry the name of David. What what have you done? &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I already clearly fly. It was his testimony. &gt;&gt; He already killed the fly. &gt;&gt; So he had the he had the right to bear the name of David. &gt;&gt; So the little thing that God had done for you, you considered herself that you purpose for carrying a name. &gt;&gt; It was a testimony. Now he didn't kill a lion. &gt;&gt; He didn't kill Goliath. But he had already killed a fly. &gt;&gt; That was his testimony. &gt;&gt; But says, "The promises of God are infallible. &gt;&gt; They are the truth. How do you think it's been friends uh through these years of meetings opposition around the world in many different in many different uh 20ome old different nations &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; that the Lord sent me into to visit &gt;&gt; and there were city there were critics &gt;&gt; the oppositions &gt;&gt; demons scientists trying to oppose it and throw into every trial that they could be that they could be tried. &gt;&gt; Regardless of all the oppositions, God confirmed that this message was reality. God confirmed that this message had the vitamin L vitamin &gt;&gt; vitamin of life vitamin D &gt;&gt; vitamin of faith &gt;&gt; as I'm going to come to a close I'll take a a super sense &gt;&gt; preached December 27 1959 9 &gt;&gt; paragraph 163 &gt;&gt; faith will will topple reasoning. &gt;&gt; Faith has to reverse all the reasoning into our lives regardless of what circumstances look like, regardless of what happens. When we take position for God, he will take position for us. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things we do by ignorance. We do things because we've seen others do. Things that we do because in the message they told us we could do it. I don't have the I don't have the message here but uh I remember in a message brother was saying &gt;&gt; when to find the bride for uh for uh Isaac when he when he when he found Rebecca &gt;&gt; he had two people that he had to to to to come in contact with. &gt;&gt; There were two pe two people that were a a problem for him. &gt;&gt; When he said that his mission was done, that he had to go back. There were two people who wanted that Rebecca should remain. &gt;&gt; It was the mother and the brother. The mother is the one who claims to be a mother. That's the Catholic church. And the brother is the preacher. &gt;&gt; Those the those are the two people that are holding forth the bride. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 163. &gt;&gt; A super sign. It says it's the most powerful force that's ever been on Earth. &gt;&gt; It's the most powerful force that's ever hit the earth. &gt;&gt; It's the most powerful force. Look at look at how we are letting the vitamin R reasoning prevent us from talking or take partaking of the vitamin that's the most powerful. It has nothing to do with this down here. If this down here declares it and says amen to it, &gt;&gt; that's all right. you are moving on. &gt;&gt; But regardless of what this does, believe that. &gt;&gt; That's where the that's where that's where the power. [Music] If you believe in your heart, your fifth sense of thinking &gt;&gt; lays lays within your brain. &gt;&gt; But your sixth sense lays in your heart. You believe with your heart. Confess. Confession is made by the mouth. You believe with your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; that six sense that powerful force. &gt;&gt; Listen because of the six sense. There was a prophet thrown into a lion's d. &gt;&gt; He speak makes commentary. Someone who's thrown into a lion's d of full of hungry lion &gt;&gt; but he was not eaten. &gt;&gt; Reasoning cannot explain that &gt;&gt; but faith can make it possible. He continues he speaks about Peter who was in prison. Peter in prison with chains sleeping and then they find themselves in in Mark's house. The people within the house of John Mark &gt;&gt; in praying utilizing the faith vitamin. &gt;&gt; Now they didn't know how God was going to work it out. But they knew that when we ask God, &gt;&gt; he will do it according to his word. &gt;&gt; And as they were praying, &gt;&gt; God who heard their prayers, he took Peter away was in prison and he brought he brought him where they were praying for him. Reason cannot explain that. So if we want to keep reasoning, &gt;&gt; we are living or staying under our privileges. &gt;&gt; We are uh uh uh starving oursel from the most powerful force &gt;&gt; as I called a musician at this time. But says paragraph 165, &gt;&gt; but the same six sense, &gt;&gt; three Hebrew children were thrown into a fierce furnace &gt;&gt; and they defy the flames of furnace. When you read the story, the Bible tells us &gt;&gt; that they they they they tied these young Hebrews and there were people that were not tied. They were they were free that were leading these young men's into the furnace. And when they get before the furnace, &gt;&gt; the same flame, &gt;&gt; it burns those that were behind leading them into the flame &gt;&gt; and it brings to them an AC, an air conditioner, &gt;&gt; the same flame. &gt;&gt; How can the reasoning explain that? &gt;&gt; What kind of God do we have? All that the devil is giving us vitamins &gt;&gt; is to prevent us from accessing our privileges. &gt;&gt; Is to hold us from growing this seed that God has placed inside of us. But it's time for us to to water this seed with a word. It's the time to take the word &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; and to go forward with it. &gt;&gt; Just to say amen to every word. &gt;&gt; Even when you don't understand when it's the word, &gt;&gt; just say amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I don't have that revelation of it today. to tomorrow God will give me the revelation. &gt;&gt; But when it's the word, &gt;&gt; I just say amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to take faith. &gt;&gt; I want to reverse all the reasoning. &gt;&gt; I want to stay far from all the vitamins that the devil is giving &gt;&gt; and guide and keep your vitamin. faith. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Lord, our heavenly father, [Music] &gt;&gt; we really need this vitamin of faith [Music] as we are just traveling on this ocean full of waves. Sometimes all these vitamins, &gt;&gt; they came and to overtake and to water our lives to express things that are not of your word, &gt;&gt; but from our heart. Lord, &gt;&gt; we know that you placed a seed in us. We feel that deepness of that seed &gt;&gt; that cries after your word that claims your word that says, "Lord, here I am. Lord, look at here's my brother. &gt;&gt; Lord, here's my sister. &gt;&gt; Oh dear. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; help us to take your word. &gt;&gt; Help us to keep the faith &gt;&gt; regardless of circumstances. Lord, &gt;&gt; let us just love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To love you from the bottom of our heart. &gt;&gt; I commit every one of your children, Lord. I commit myself into your hands. &gt;&gt; Father, we know that nothing in this world can help us, &gt;&gt; but you are the only one. Lord, we learn this morning &gt;&gt; that when we are invaded by all these vitamins, &gt;&gt; when we are tired, &gt;&gt; when we are deprived, &gt;&gt; we need a coach for life. &gt;&gt; You are our coach. &gt;&gt; You Your word is our coach. Oh Lord, we need your coaching tonight. &gt;&gt; Not just tonight, &gt;&gt; but all the days of our lives. [Music] &gt;&gt; We commit ourselves to you. We believe that you've heard our prayers &gt;&gt; because it's your promise &gt;&gt; and we ask &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And let's just sing down. Oh, when I look upon holiness, oh when I gaze into your lovely and when all things start around become shadows in the light of [Music] Oh, and away I find the joy of reaching your heart. And when my will become enthroned in your love. And when all things pass around, we become shadows in the light of you. Oh, I worship you. I worship you. Oh my god. [Music] [Applause] [Music] All the reason that I sle [Music] amen. We're going to have a baptism tonight. Amen. Brother Wolof's son the Angelo is getting baptized tonight and certainly thank the Lord for that. For touching his heart. Amen. That's what we're waiting for. Amen. And we want to find the last one. Amen. Get them in that we may go. And we want the word of God to have an effect on our hearts. We don't just want to be listeners. We want to be doers. We want to see the word as Alberta said that we may move away the reasoning and let the word take effect in our life. Amen. Brother Ben, if you could just come and continue the songs as we get ready for the baptism. Amen. [Music] again. When I look into your holiness, when I gaze into your lovelyness, let all things pass around the shadows below you. [Music] When I found the joy of reaching your heart, let my be [Music] shy of you. Oh, I worship you. [Music] I worship you. [Music] And the reason I is to worship you. I worship you. I worship you. [Music] The reason I [Music] worship you. Oh, what heing is he? [Music] He is. Yes. Oh, he is my sing. [Music] Oh, he is. [Music] Yes, Lord. Oh, he is. [Music] I believe in you. And so I reach my hand to the heaven. I lift my heart where my help comes from. I look to you. You are my God, my healer. I trust in you. I reach my hands in I reach my hand to the heaven [Music] where my help comes from you. You are my trust in you. Freedom is here. Oh, and freedom is here. Do you believe it? Freom is frees you. I receive it. Oh, it's free. [Music] [Applause] Freedom is here. Oh, fre is here. [Applause] [Music] might be [Music] my to [Music] I am where my help comes from. Oh, I look to you. I he [Music] Jesus is the Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thankful for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's the word. It's only the word of God that creates faith as we heard it. And you can even ask, well, how can one just by the process of being baptized and and then get the Holy Ghost and all of that? How reasoning cannot understand that? But we understand that's a promise. &gt;&gt; And we know that many of us are sitting here. We gather here because it proves that the promise is true, that the formula is true. We heard the word of God. Some preachers preach somewhere and we were convicted in our hearts and we came to the altar and we prayed and all of the sudden our lives changed. What changed it? God changed it. Why? Because we believe in the formula. God came and he made his word a reality in our lives. Amen. And as the scripture will say in Acts chapter 2, it says that now they were when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and the rest of them of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For this promise is unto you and unto your children and to all that are far off, even as many as our Lord God shall call. So the promise is still in effect. The promise is still true. We're still baptizing and the Lord is still receiving and giving the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So, Brother D'Angelo, and we certainly uh come here by the great commission that we've been given. And the word says that go into all the world. And when the word is preached and is received, it says baptize everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we know that's the name of the father, son, and the holy ghost that's been revealed to us in the same time to be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So tonight we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, and all the way. I'm going all the way. I will not rest until I see his shiny face on that sweet day. All the way. I'm going all the way because I'm going [Music] all the way and all the way. I'm going all the way.
