wanna welcome everyone in the house of god i trust you're excited to be here this morning may god bless you and welcome our visitors as we invite brother mike for our psalm reading this morning amen good morning we're gonna read psalm 63 this morning you know it's a great little chapter it it opens up with the verse in verse 1 it says o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is you know it's um it's interesting that little footnote there the beginning of the chapter tells us that david wrote this particular psalm and he was in the wilderness you know and whenever you talk about going out in the wilderness there's kind of uh so it's interesting you get two different reactions to that you have you know the one group of people that you know they get really excited about the idea of going out into the woods going out to get away from it all and you know it's the place that they go for vacation to relax whether it's to hunt or to just get a cabin somewhere or just get away from it all and then you've got the other group of people that think about how boring how terrifying that is you know snakes and there's bugs it's hot it's cold i can't get my latte you know whatever the case may be but you've always got you know kind of two different reactions to that pull you know they're the ones that when they go on vacation they like to go from one exciting place to another you know that's two different responses to a wilderness experience you know i was reading the psalm and i was thinking about how when maybe it's you know what we've been taught through 2000 years of christianity or whatever but we tend to think of the wilderness as being a dry and bare in place a place where you're thirsty don't can't find any water a place of trial a place of struggle in a place of place of difficulty but you know webster actually defines the word wilderness as this attract or region uncultivated and uninhabited by human beings an area essentially undisturbed by human activity together with its naturally developed life community you know what the wilderness really is it's a place untouched and separated from all the influences of man you won't find any you know here in civilization you see roads that sort of direct the path that you go you're influenced by the paths that man has paved out but in the wilderness there are no roads that have been pre-paved by man you know here in civilization you know we adopt certain behaviors and habits we consume our time and pour out our efforts in response to the demands and the expectations the needs of mankind but in the wilderness none of those things exist removed entirely from the influence of man and it's just you alone with god all those voices all that activity set aside and there's no other voice you know some people find the idea of that quiet alone place to be terrifying uncomfortable they can't stand the silence they can't stand the idea of being alone so they'll fill the silence with something whether it's their favorite playlist on their iphone or some other entertainment or they'll desperately seek the company of others for fellowship or for for entertainment anything to avoid that discomfort of being alone with just him you know but there are other people that seek that kind of place because of what they find there you know in the scripture the place the wilderness was a place where people found refuge and safety it was a place where they could find a dwelling place when they could find no home among the cities or the countries around them and it was for many that place where they encountered the lord you know haggar met him there and found a fountain of water when she was on the run and needed a dwelling place for her in ishmael moses met him there and found a fire burning in a bush without it burning the bush elijah met him there in caves and juniper trees when he was on the run from an angry queen of course david this was his place of refuge this is where he learned how to call upon the lord and it says in verse 5 and verse 63 his soul was satisfied as with marrow and fatness you know we have a tendency to look at that statement that he was in the wilderness and see that other statement that it was a dry and thirsty land and think that he was in a dry and thirsty land away from where you know he could find water but he had actually left to dry in thirsty lands to come into a wilderness where he could find the lord you know even brother branham when he was given the opportunity to walk with him for a while in the wilderness said it was the greatest privilege of his life right the wilderness it's because of the wilderness that the children of israel were able to assume their position in the land the people that left egypt were a different people than those that went into egypt right they left egypt a lawless people they left the wilderness as worshipers they left a position of living in bondage and they walked out a people of conqueror there were conquerors they left egypt without a name to a people that was bearing his name all because they had that daily wilderness walk you know the wilderness isn't necessarily a physical place away from the city but it's that place that you go to from a daily perspective to get away from all the influence of man separated and apart not running to and fro from one activity to another not necessarily a church service not necessarily fellowshipping with believers but that place where it's just you and him otherwise you're still in a dry and thirsty land you know in psalm 63 david describes the world around him as a dry and thirsty land but he goes into the wilderness and it's there to that he sees his power and his glory just as he's seen in his sanctuary you know david sought that place in the wilderness as a refuge from that dry and thirsty land that he was surrounded with and the question that you know i would ask myself i think we could ask ourselves do we have a wilderness walk this morning do we have that does the idea of stepping away and setting aside everything and spending some alone time with him does it sound uncomfortable or can't you wait to get there that daily wilderness walk you know we know that song that says you know this world is not my home i'm just a passing through you know there's a people that pass through this dry and thirsty land by walking in the wilderness you know it was there that david said in verse 5 of this psalm we're going to read my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips it's a place where he could go that in verse three he said thy loving kindness is better than life so as we read psalm 63 this morning it's just a short chapter maybe it's just a quiet call a reminder of the need for each of us to step away from the busyness from the pressures the noise the activity of civilization and daily step into that wilderness where he may be found fellowship is great church service is great but it's until you have that wilderness walk that you can't meet him right so let's read that together maybe as we're reminded of that this morning psalm 63 david's walk in the wilderness let's read that together starting in verse 1 o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power in thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth heart after thee thy right hand upholdeth me those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be apportioned for foxes but the king shall rejoice in god everyone that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped amen amen god bless you i have your seats amen oh do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling not to wonder where you're going when you died [Music] you believe oh [Music] oh oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] oh

in this hour [Music] the enemy has found a way in is working hard to destroy all truth pertaining to you but father our hearts hunger after you this morning lord we received a great message in this day father directed to an elect people and father we want to accept our calling this morning and to have ears that can hear the gospel eyes father that have applied isab that we might see this morning we ask you to increase our faith increase our confidence in your word father it's the only thing that'll help us we ask you to bless the people this morning in your precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's turn over into the scripture found in the book of numbers the 22nd chapter and the 31st verse so uh the book of numbers the 22nd chapter and the 30 first verse we welcome each of you this morning our visitors and those that are amongst us and and so we just trust that you are blessed this morning that there'll be something in god's word and that'll just touch your heart amen the 22nd chapter and the 31st verse then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat upon his face may god bless his word to us this morning in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you as we've been uh traveling along if i could say it that way uh we begin to take some the messages that are preached uh as we've been going started out in 1965 and we've just been taking our path and coming down and looking at each message as we go we just went through the great sermon is this the rising of the sun and we just saw so many blessings open up to us out of the word things that the lord is uh showing us and opening to us and i just think it's a marvelous how that uh the last message we read how much he put emphasis on our calling in our election and the finished work that god has already done in us i believe there's a place that the believer can really grow when it has confidence that they're in the palm of god's hand and we know that our society today is built on destroying that confidence that's what he's doing he he wants to make the future look so uncertain and slow so cloudy that we don't realize that we already possess in our hearts what it takes for us to make it all the way through so he he's done a great work and and we saw you that our confidence can be built in him amen our faith is built in nothing less than jesus christ in his righteousness so we always say i was raised a catholic and in being a catholic we were always taught that we needed to have some form of penance you know something that we had to do if we sinned then we needed to inflict some form of suffering upon ourselves for the sin that we committed and we would do all kinds of things we would give up uh certain things or we'd say prayers uh and and go to special light candles and every bit of it had to do with some sort of reconciliation on our part and even in mexico when i had the opportunity to go to mexico there was a certain church there in mexico that i've heard about all my life growing up as a catholic and it's the place where the people would get down on their knees and they would actually crawl for miles on their knees you could go down the boulevard and you can actually see the where where they had walked on their knees and walked on their knees up the steps and all the way to the altar to pray and all the time having their rosaries saying prayers and it was an effort uh for them to make some sort of atonement because that they were sinners and it's it's one thing to recognize you're a sinner but there's another thing to recognize that you're free from sin now you're not free from temptation and you're not free from the flesh but you're free from unbelief and anybody that has to go through that much effort of lighting candles and walking on their knees and you know giving up certain things to inflict punishment is not sure of their salvation that that issue has not been settled you know because they're still doing things to obtain it and i thought this message is arising and some was so beautiful to let us know that when he was on the cross we were there we were in him i liked the song when he was on the cross we were on his mind and i thought that song was maybe the author didn't understand all the great words of inspiration that were in it but he went there with you on his mind he went there paying the atonement for your sins because he knew who was in the lamb's book of life because they were in him you were his kinsmen the kinsmen redeemer and that's who he came he came for his own and so we we know that with this great price paid for us at calvary and not by our righteousness not by our power not by our might by by his spirit saith the lord we understand that we there's a rest that we can take knowing that he has all things in his hands and he can do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask or think so god has not forsaken us and he hasn't forsaken me and he hasn't forsaken you though we've given him many causes to forsake us it would uh it would only uh uh seem like it would take somebody very special to stay with us all this time but that's what he's got purposed in his heart he's got purposed in his heart that he won't lose you he won't forsake you he won't lose you nothing is going to take him take you away from him and he'll go through whatever means and bounds or trouble that he has to to get you in fact he even had to appear to paul on his road to damascus and smite him blind and say paul it's hard to fight me it's hard to kick against the brick it's hard to do battle with me i'm not gonna lose all right and so paul had to uh he learned obedience and and he suffered any but but he knew even to the point when he got in front of the king at on before agrippa and he says oh agrippa he said i'll tell you my story i was on my way in and and uh uh and and a grip uh he's and he tells the grip i i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and the grip said paul does that even persuade persuaded me you know that's what he was doing and he was trying to convert him and you know what he had his opportunity right there he said he said he said oh oh agrippa i would let you be as i except for these uh chains right here and and so god's always wanted to share himself with you the enemy's the accuser he's the one that looks at your past looks at your fault tells you that you are what's in the mirror but you're more than what's in the mirror what you really are is what he has in his mind and we've brought that to you in many different ways but the one that you see in the mirror is the other you the real you is the one that he has and that he's molding you and making you and forming you too and the scripture tells us that we might be formed into the image of our lord and so that's what he's doing so he hasn't quit us let's don't quit him now we've read these scriptures here and we're going to uh and we're and i if i could title this you know it i titled it our our internal conflict or our our internal clash um and so uh we're we're looking at this uh message and and we're just going to kind of read to you and try to bring some uh basic if i could say this fundamental truth so this morning's going to be more like a sunday school lesson or a bible teaching unless i get inspired and get excited and then we'll move to another realm but i i just like these great things here so i'd like to if you can follow me along in the message does god ever change his mind about his word he reads the scripture and then i'm going to read this statement that he brings us in paragraph 67 and 66 so he just got finished reading his text and he says now in the reading of this to build a text around it i want to take the subject does god ever change his mind about his word that's a great question and so i i was talking to brother uh jackson the other day and i said jackson uh i said we're gonna take the subject does god ever change his mind about his word and he said well i've got the answer to that and he said no i said well yes i don't have to preach in the morning you know you can go ahead but there's some great understandings in here so but he makes this statement he says that is quite a text and it's a great truth that we ought to understand so there's a truth there that he wants us to understand he says can god say anything and then say i'm sorry i said it can god take his word back after he said it now that that is a great thing and we don't realize it but within our own spirits and within our own minds that conflict is continually going on there there's a battle that rages within us concerning the will of god and and that just uh as as it is now he took this text of of balaam and and because it brings to us the question uh can god say no and then say yes and you understand the story of balaam uh the israelites were on their way to the promised land and they were coming to the land of the moabites and so the king of barrick barrack called on to balaam to come and curse the children of israel now that doesn't mean swear adam you know what i mean it it meant to change their direction you understand to influence them now we're not going to go into all this part of it but you know that he did do that because the children of israel began to take the daughters of the moabites and and it was a mixing and and and that's what he came to do was to dilute the word of god in other words to balaam came to instill into the children of israel another way of looking at the promises you know in other words this is one thought let me give you another thought you know and that is not a new tactic that tactic uh happened first of all in the garden of eden when satan came to eve and she said well he said i would die and he said no surely you won't die you know and he knew that i i i'm just going to get away from my notes i can't just feel my spirit just feeling the freedom but he knew that god couldn't destroy adam and eve because he knew he had a purpose for him so he said surely you won't die but he said let me tell you there's another way of looking at it if you do eat this you understand you'll know all things you will understand things you it it'll be enlightened and so the battle in the mind started right there and remember this great statement that eve accepted satan's lie as god's truth so it was almost a self-deception and you could imagine the battle that went on in her mind the battle that went on in her heart as she began to think through these different things in her life and and so as we follow this story we have to understand the story now here comes balaam and balaam's a prophet he's not a soothsayer he's a real genuine prophet of god the the the moabites are not unbelievers they're serving the same god that moses and the children of israel are serving they come from the descendants of lot so that's how uh known you know let me think here it's uh um anyone that came out of the flood it was his daughter by his own uh it was the son from his own daughter who was that okay was it lot okay so a lot it was lot's daughter's son and so the son of the father a lot and his daughter's child that was their descendants so they knew god and they served god and so this is how it came down through the time so and so they had prophets and they had so we realized then that there's a type here it says now israel of the old testament typed the bride of the new testament coming out of the world marching on their road that to go into the millennium and that's paragraph 70. it says israel of the old testament types the bride of the new testament coming out of the world marching the road to canaan or the can't to go to the millennium so they they they're they're a type of the they're a type of the bride moab is a type of the organized and denominational church and so this is this type now we want to understand the journey so if we are on the journey that they were on it's a type of our journey to the millennium so if if we're on this journey and it's a type and a type is a foreshadow of something that's to come amen so they make in manufacturing they make a prototype they make the type first and they can work it out but it still lets you know this is what is to come so this is a type of the journey so their journey to the cane to canaan is a type of our journey to the millennium and so why do we need to understand this because if these are the things that attack the israel on their way to the canaan land and that's a type then we should begin to understand that there is going to be an attack on us that we don't have a journey free of problems and trials and of tests and so we need to understand that that we we just don't all of a sudden believe and it's settled and uh there's not a part that we play they were elected you understand that they came out of the egypt under the pillar of fire under signs and wonders so they knew their election but their election didn't stop them from having to take the journey and so if i could that's the theme of what's on my heart this morning is that we still have to take the journey and so we're going to just look at that through the eyes of the scripture we you don't can't say i'm elected and sit on the park bench and watch the world go on you're elected to take the trip it's like having the ticket if i'm handing out tickets to get on the train you you can take the ticket and you can say i have a ticket i'm i've got the trip i've i've got the in i got the possession of it so in that ticket you have the destination so you can claim to have the destination but you still have got to take the journey you know you've got to get on the train and let the train take you through all the stops through all the mountains through the valleys through everything but you rest in the fact that you had the ticket given to you so it won't fail and you've got three you rest in the fact that he's going to take me on this journey and i'm going to end up at my final destination but you still got to take the trip you can't sit there and create a false faith and a false revelation and say i'm just going to sit here and one day like philip i'm just going to be poofed over there well if that was the case when you got there you wouldn't have any of the experiences any of the character any of the understanding of what it took so he's got to take us on this journey and i think it behooves us to understand uh as we take this journey what is being built and what are the things that we're overcoming and so we're not we're not going to fail to get there but he wants to build us character in our journey and sometimes we know the scripture says he'll take our vessel and he'll completely break it down and and then he'll remold it the way that he happens but praise god all of that happens on the journey so he'll never leave you he won't forsake you you've got a lot of difficulties and just like on a journey you go through valley you don't go through one valley and say oh that's the last valley on the trip neither do you get on the mountaintop and think i'm on the mountaintop the trip trip's over but he continually takes us and is dealing with us and and working his power of of transfer nation within our spirits and within our hearts so we're grateful for the journey because on the journey it allows him to uh it allows him to deal with us and show us things and have that personal fellowship that brother mike spoke of in his exhortation this morning that chance to get alone with god and have him do the great things that he does for us and so we see this great type here and and and so we we we know now with moab being a type that we can we can talk about uh what is what was moab being a type of organization and what was his effect and so the bible makes this statement he says he says i'm thinking that the greatest enemy of christian society today is organized churches so he says that's the greatest uh enemy of the church today is organized churches now so many and we're talking this morning about the internal conflict so something that's organized is already set in its ways okay it's everything's set have you ever met uh uh someone that is uh uh i don't know you know they're just they're really prone to everything having its place i went through a stage of like that in my life and i would walk into my house and if the picture was just turned a little bit i'd go turn it back and you know everything had its place it made life easy for me that was at a time when i was going through a lot of inner emotional conflict and so the the more order i could put in the carnal world the more security i placed in things that are carnal and so a world that's organized an organization he said was the greatest uh detriment or the greatest enemy so something that is so set in its ways and and has got things all figured out that becomes an enemy to the church and we have a tendency in our lives to set patterns not necessarily patterns of good work but realms of comfort and and where we have borders and boundaries and everything set up even in our mind that we begin to think in just a certain way and and we have our means of judgment and therefore once you're organized to a place it doesn't allow for any change or any growth and and so this is why he says this is the greatest enemy of the church is that i get to a place where i don't allow any growth any changes to my nature to my personality or to myself so we we basically say i'm spiritual i've got it figured out i know the word of god i have this i have that i i i don't need a a attitude adjustment or a personality adjustment so i know what i believe and therefore my my foundation becomes my own personal interpretation and understanding of the word of god so that's what i'm said in and there's one sad part of that it produces something that i refer to as blame or finger-pointing i'm okay it's everybody else's fault you know it's just nature if you're organized and you feel that the organization of your life is right then anybody that doesn't fit the pattern of your life must be wrong because if you give any credence at all to the way they're doing things or the way that they think you feel that that is an infringement and a judgment against the way you do things i've worked with a lot of guys in my life on the construction field that just don't know what they're doing because they don't do it my way you know you know in other words i was so caught up in the way that i do things and the way that i feel that they should be done i couldn't even join in with them that we were both trying to achieve the same end and you know what you learn after a while if you feel that way about everything you end up doing everything yourself and there's got to come a time you've got to say okay you just do it your way now you may think in your heart they're doing it harder they're doing it longer but when it's all said and done if if it reached its goal and what was finished was finished then you can rest in that okay we got the job done the best thing is you didn't i didn't have to well we're doing a lot of things we don't have to do because there's a god that's already done it for us you understand nothing's going to pluck you out of the palm of his hand so we have a rest in the eternal security of god but that we can now grow from that and so what organized religions did is it it they they don't allow for any deviation so they built their walls and remember that's what that the prophet of god said that about organized religion is that they built up barriers and walls around one another they couldn't even fellowship right in the general worship of what god accomplished on the cross they couldn't even fellowship in in one another's blessings so remember god lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust god is a rewarder and maybe somebody somewhere in life's time had done something good for somebody or asked god for something or did a favor for something and god wants to come along and bless them somehow uh uh and do things and if you're so blind and so opinionated and so defeated that you can't even sit back and say well you know praise god god did bless you i've seen a lot of people very successful and i realize the only reason they're successful is because god blessed them and they may even take the name of the lord in vain but you understand god is going to take that whatever that blessing is and somewhere down the line it is going to become a blessing to his elect lady he's just that kind of god he's got a bigger program than we do he does ways that we don't understand his ways are beyond finding out but so uh what we need to be understand and come back to our internal clash and our internal conflict is what what is it that we want for our heart and our mind what kind of people do we want to be i don't want to be finger-pointing i don't want to be so concerned about everything that's going around me and be of fear that it's going to affect me now i can say this because i've watched the numbers of those that gathered together and the assembling of the church began to dwindle and that's because satan allowed a virus some flu that not everybody dies from but the fear you know and and so you sit in conflict you understand within within your own self because the word of god says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together unless satan comes with a covert virus do you understand but something took the place of something else now so we came up with an option called streaming i remember a few sundays ago that seemed like the presence of the lord just dropped into the service and and people were blessed and people came up to be prayed for that i hadn't recognized so i don't go back and listen to too many of my sermons but i went back to listen to this and i and i watched it streaming it and i could tell that what you're watching is not what's happening present because there is a word of god that obligates him he's only obligated to his word he's not obligated to our interpretation but he's obligated to what he said and he said wherever two or three gathered together in my name to dare that i'll be and when you get licks of fire together there's a presence of god that that is uh working in the midst of the people as his angels go to and fro up the road collecting the uh collecting the prayer requests of the people and presenting him to him and then he starts ministering there's a different anointing in a different place but there's there's substitutions that take place and people have go through this conflict what should i do should i go to church i don't believe you should come to church if you're sick you know if if you're sick then we have ways to pray for you if you're sick you know even the prophet of god said if you have a child that doesn't obey in service he said leave him home i mean that's quite a statement but to continually uh stay out of the house of god because you've come up with something else yourself and and so this is sort of a theme line that runs to this message does god change his mind about his word so he says every time that man made an organization the spirit of god left it and never did return again this the spirit so every time man set his boundaries and set his borders and has a lifestyle that god can no longer influence or affect you know i mean another he looks at you and says you're not going to change i'm not going to change you you're set you know you're spiritually stubborn you know what's better for you than i do and when he comes to the place that he can't deal with your heart and can deal with their spirit he he leaves yes and i i only have human terminologies and a human perspective but basically god's not going to waste his time now you can argue well god don't have time and all that okay go into some theological cobweb and miss the whole thing that the lord's trying to say which is a a symbol and an attribute of organization they have an explanation for anything that challenges them and that's part of what takes place in the internal conflict that goes within us when god wants to deal with us or god wants to touch us or god wants to expand us then all of a sudden we have this great willing that comes up within us of defense we defend the way we think we defend the way we act we defend what it is we look for all kinds we don't need to be justified you understand he's already justified us through the blood of the lamb he's not doing away with us and he's not going to condemn us because there's no condemnation to them that walk in christ jesus after the spirit and not after the flesh so we defend ourselves as if we have something to do with our salvation and the scripture says if if we can do anything for our salvation jesus christ died in vain he didn't come to do for us what we could have done for ourselves the things for yourself that you can do do do what's right do what's righteous do what's good lay for yourselves a pattern of good works but don't think that you're not needy don't think you're all right the way you are because you could be perfect but the scripture tells us to be perfect as he is perfect so our our perfection can grow to a greater level and he wants to bring you to that level because his desire is i love that scripture as he is so are we in this world and he's molding us and making us into the image of the lord so we want to understand the great eternal conflict that's within us so we understand that there's a clash so so god leaves it so we so there's something that that works here so i'd like to listen to this great statement or we'll just read this little section here starting at that paragraph 74. he says when they organized god laid it on the shelf and that's where it went it stayed from then on they growed in number but never walk walking of this awakening of the spirit of god never no more they grew in numbers but the awakening of the spirit of god was never no more so what is the point that he's trying to bring to us is the awakening of the spirit of god he says moab here is a type of such because they are organized nation and in their own land like their own denomination and they had their own religion and their religion was the same religion that israel had and the moabites and believed in jehovah god but there was an organized group of people now we're not talking about the organization out there we're talking about the organization of our own lives what we believe what we think how we live our particular lifestyle and that now cannot be moved it can't be awakened that's been closed out he says now they represented the natural church and israel represented the spiritual church in its journey in its journey we're going to draw this little parallel here in a second but one's on a journey right and one is settled down he kept on its journey now israel was not an organized nation as long as they followed god they were independent they come up so journey no place to go wherever the pillar of fire went they went with it they were not an organized organizat they were not an organized nation they had an organism among them because of circumcision gave them that under time search him gave them that under the commandment of god but never an organized nation at this time but listen when they finally became an organized nation that's where they fell and rejected their messiah now think of that way back then when they finally decided we're going to have a king you know instead of the spiritual leadership of god through a prophet we're going to have a king we're going to get a sanhedrin we're going to get pharisees and scribes we're going to do this we're going to do that way back there they rejected the messiah that's when they rejected him they didn't reject them when he came what happens was they already put in their life the organizational system that couldn't be moved and that's where they rejected him so it was the condition that they were in that caused them to reject the messiah so they they had already rejected the moving of the holy spirit and the spirit of god through a prophet changing them so they'd set up their systems they'd set up their viewpoints they have set up what they felt was righteousness and now they were locked within that boundary now became subject to that thinking subject to that system subject to that organization so when something came up that was outside of it they had no room for it because they didn't feel they needed to change we have moses we have the law we have the teachings we follow moses who do you follow i do nothing unless my father reveals it to me there was a clash there was a conflict because they they made a they had made a substitution and what did they substitute it with so they had to have something right so they had to replace it because every time the spiritual comes there's a clash so when the lord came there was a clash he took a whip into their temple he said you are your father's the devil and they what did they go to don't they went to justifying themselves they went in to talk about the law of the prophets they began to defend their religion because they didn't want i thought what my brother mike was sharing was another little sign that this was they didn't want to go through any internal conflict or questioning but what did he challenge them to do search the scripture search the scripture what does the word of god say but they they didn't want to go through the process because they weren't sure what the result would be but let me tell you if it's god the result's always better god wants to make an attitude adjustment or a lifestyle adjustment or have you sacrificed something that you've built for years and years and maybe a business maybe something that but so that you can fulfill the word of god you watch yourself you try to dim that voice lower and lower and lower and you fill it up with self-righteousness and what you're doing and how much money you give and and what you support god didn't ask you to be a testimony to believers he asked you to be a testimony to unbelievers and the only true testament you can have is that you live by god's word amen so in i thought this was uh beautiful in paragraph 88 and 89 beginning to explain what they substituted what god had called them to do with so they had to do something so what it is when israel rejected and took on and rejected the prophet and the leadership of the spirit and built their organization what now became their defense we have works we wash pots we wash pans we do all these things all those things that the lord just came out and said you do all these things but it's righteousness god wanted to lead his people the people want to lead themselves that's the eternal conflict that's the inner clash is between you leading yourself and god leading you and every time i want to lead myself i find lots of scriptures and lots of quotes to back myself up let's just read and we'll move along so when when korah listed moses it says god said separate yourself from he had enough of it and he swallowed him up in the earth see there was a clash when the carnal and the spiritual meets there is always a clash when judas meant jesus there was a clash one the son of god the other one the son of satan just like cain and abel and there was a clash when they met one of them was the treasurer of the church the other one a pastor and as now we come in this day the same thing again so we're talking about an understanding so it behooves us if we're on the same journey to understand we're gonna we're on the same path to understand we're gonna have the same conflicts because remember god couldn't do one thing to one person and if they meant the qualifications not do the same thing because god cannot change his mind about his word and no more can he award you for something if you didn't have to go through the same thing the other person did in order to receive the award i thought of that about the boston marathon all the time in the bathtub marathon there's all kinds of people that jump into the race in the middle of the race hundreds of them they got to call them out every year there's somebody that jumps in there and he's all fresh and he runs down there over the finish line before everybody else and everybody's cheering there's no reward because they didn't take the same journey so if we think that we're going to sit back because we recognize the pillar of fire and we recognize the cloud and we've seen vindications and think that that is an exit from the journey then we're deceiving ourselves and let me tell you the prophet of god went through all the things he preached he went through them by experience so he just didn't get a sermon out of the sky he suffered for the things that he spoke and there was a clash when they met he said and and as now we come in this day the same thing again the carnal denomination then the carnal denomination to the spiritual bride of christ that's the clash the carnal denomination not baptist not methodist even the carnal denomination the groups of people coming up with the same interpretation the same thinking the same thought process the same works the same form of worship and doing it as a group and relying on one another for vindication and patting one another on the back did i make that clear he said the carnal denomination to the spiritual bride of christ the spiritual bride of christ is so much different from the carnal organization there is no comparison at all i can't believe how that we as the members of the bride are being so influenced we've got titles now senior pastors you know associate pastors we we've got we've got all the things we pattern we have to have we have to have uh uh seminars i talked with someone the other day about marriage why don't i have a a a little seminar for married couples really oh are we all going to find a way to do it the same way to be married the same way to treat your wife individual we build that we work that out the holy spirit's all the holy spirit is your counselor i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come again i'll lead and guide you in all truth and righteousness why are you separating your prayer closet and just being christian and get getting back you want the best way to have a good marriage be a christian you be a christian in yourself you turn the other cheek you go the escrow mile you lay for yourselves a pattern of good words what people do is they look out here to all this fairy tale stuff the prophet of god said the trouble with the church is they read too many love magazines amen not the way it is you know what the prophet god said he gave one of the greatest marriage counseling seminars ever in one little sermon he said this couple had divorced now they came down to where they were separating the goods i hope you never have to go there because greed breeds hatred and hatred breeds vile actions and so they were there and they said you take this okay you i want this okay and finally got to the bottom of the box and there was a baby shoe and they both reached out and they laid their hands on that baby shoe and all of a sudden they went back to the beginning and what it was that attracted them to each other what it was they had most people can't fix the situations they're in the fussing the arguing and everything because they're trying to fix it now instead of going back to the beginning so when god wanted to fix your life what did he do he took you all the way back to the beginning where you were in his mind that's the way you fix it you talk to one another i thought what mike said was so good sometimes we fail to have the courage just to get alone and face we'd rather have our our own comfort zone i believe he placed it like that sometimes just a good straight talk helps if you're feeling left lonely if you feel that your husband's always out with the boys and i'm a big preacher of lifetime wt because i know what it's like to leave a wife at home for 10 years and her just be a christian i know what it's like i know it's like to have the holy spirit bring you under so much conviction and he says husbands love your wife as christ loved the church that's more marriage counseling and you'll ever get i can tell you men are from mars and women are from venus and women are gatherers and men are hunters and all that psychology just a little bit of honesty a little bit say you know i don't think you treat me right a little bit of prayed up you know that that's that's what changes things but if you lock yourself all up and nothing can move on your spirit and nothing can move on your senses and you could all stubborn believe it or not you have a denomination going on within yourself because you have barriers and borders and lines which you will not cross and you go into the defense mode and what comes with that accusations and finger pointing which we we've just all went through so that's why because we have something to guide us and it's the spirit of god just like you men should know how to if you're you're dating or you're courting or whatever you call it or you're going to have a cup of coffee uh with a sister to find out if you even interested in oh i know that ain't mentioned teaching but that's why we got so many messed up relationships in this message brother branham dated he did you can go get the generations book there's a sister in that book i'll call her a sister she may not look like you think she ought to look but she said brother abraham took me out and he treated me like a gentleman no little in the windows no little tensions of personal desires overruling your common sense am i preaching too straight i don't care about the do you understand i'm i'm only concerned about my flock i'm not trying to preach a message to the world i want us to be everything that god wants us to do that they were a thing but you know how to act as a christian you sisters know how to act and again i preach and i'll keep preaching it until it doesn't exist but gossip is a terrible thing to the church sharing your opinions about somebody with one another thinking that god cares what you think or trying to advertise what you know about somebody well i happen to know well let me tell you something you better be careful because if that's under the blood you've just opened the door for that spirit to come into your life so there's no comparison he says now listen to 89 now notice the natural always tries to type the spiritual but as jacob and esau it will not work it would not now when it come to doing good works i believe that esau actually was a better man than jacob so what are we talking about when the spirit's rejected what do we substitute it with works or a covering religion is a covering look he said and now when it come to doing good works i believe esau was a better man than jacob in the sight of men in the sight of men he tried to take care of his daddy he was blind a prophet and all those things that he tried to do but yet esau didn't think about that being just carnal works he didn't think it was carnal works he thought it was accounted to him for what righteousness now this is a conflict because when we go to defend ourselves we start looking at our works we start looking at our dresses we start looking at what we go to church we start looking all those things now we start attributing that back to ourselves as righteousness i'm going because i believe the message no you're not you're going because your name was written on the lamb's book of life and i wonder if there's so maybe somebody out there's names on the lamb's book of life that never came to this revelation not my call listen beautiful all the things that he tried to do but yet esau didn't think about that being just carnal works he thought he could get in by what he done doing something good for somebody which was all right that's how he thought he could get in he never looked it at his carnal works but now but jacob his whole soul was to get that birth right and that's what god recognized in him spiritually oh my goodness what a what a a great thing so we see this great clash he says and and so every time that that the carnal comes along what it's trying to do he said it's trying to destroy the influence of the spirit on you another satan is continually trying to destroy the influence of your election on you he don't want you to rest on just the fact i'm elected my name's on the lamb's book of life god's able to perform that which he promised if my name's on the lamb's book of life and god elected me he can surely mold me and make me and finish the work that he started hallelujah and this is in uh paragraph 91 so we see god does not forever change his mind about his original word but who he calls that's who he ordains and no one else can take that place no no one could take moses's place no matter how many korahs rised up how many dathans it was moses god had called regardless but if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will now if you'd like just like in the we won't go there let's go down to paragraph 95. he says now therefore god never changes his mind about anything but he will permit you to go on now this is a long way around to get to what i want to say here about this but i want you to understand it see god will permit you to do something and even bless you in doing it but it still isn't his perfect will 98 he permits it as i said but he he will not let it be his perfect will but he'll make it work to honor and bless his perfect will and childbearing by sex is one of that so it never was god's original plan but he's still working it to his perfect will to bring forth his elected children he says notice being with it was an ill illegitimate nation it started out illegitimate by a father believer and a daughter believer oh i could go into that but i better stay away let me say it this way a lot of people have preacher religion they've accepted the way the preacher brings it they accept what he says i would implore you to anything that you hear me say go challenge it by the word of god and by prayer don't just accept it on the basis of the fellowship or on a personality don't accept the organize organized approach god builds his church on divine revelation if some if a preacher preaches a seed right one watereth right one planet one watereth but god gives the revelation and lucas reed as we'll close up real quick now and that's the way the church started that's the way it started at nicea rome when the roman catholic church at the very beginning where come where it come from was pentecost but when they organized and brought it into celebrities into the church they started to they started making having prayers running beads praying for the dead and all those other things then it just started rolling from one air to another one heir to another until look where it's gone to it's not one representation of pentecost in it at all see it's one air picking up another picking up another there is only one thing to do and that's clean off the record and go back to the beginning don't you understand that's what god did with this message there was only one way to fix it that was to clean it all off and take it back to the beginning that's what the seals did it opened it up and took it back to the beginning and we're just we just got just uh one more uh we'll just close with this and we can always pick it up later and this is just at the end of that paragraph he said israel represents the spiritual church israel was the church true and was the bride of that day called out of egypt and vindicated to the truth now we'll read this and we'll stop with this thought this morning notice when when them two comes together both of them offered the same sacrifice both built saw seven altars both offered up clean sacrificed ox they even offered up rams testifying that there was a coming messiah fundamentally they were both exactly the same israel down here in the valley moab up on the hill and moabs had seven altars israel had seven altars moab had seven ox israel with seven ox moab with seven rams speaking of the coming messiah israel had seven rams what was the difference in them so one of them has substituted something you understand they substituted words they've substituted something so this is where they came to they've got everything fundamentally the same we all believe in the same jesus we all believe in calvary we all have all these things they're all the same and listen as our our messenger points it out what was the difference in them fundamentally both right but you see moab did not have a vindication of god with them they were only a nation of groups of celebrities now we know they went out and rented a profit they did a rent a profit wait a minute we ran a prophet we only get what we want to hear we don't take it all we just borrow little sections from it and we've got our celebrities but israel had a prophet with them they had a smitten wrong with them they had a pillar of fire they had a brass serpent for healing they had the blessings of god moving right along with them and they was the called out children of god isn't that the perfect type of the bride remember we're elected look at what we have with us we've got the pillar of fire we've got a cloud we've had divine healing signs and wonders a real genuine word prophet that stays with the word of god another we're absolutely a perfect type the perfect type of of israel on the journey everything they had to make the journey we have to make the journey so they're the so what made moab a denomination and an organization and israel not so what would be the difference for us having all the same things that would stop us from being an organization now this was individual now so what would stop me from being an organization i've got everything everybody else has everything they claim to have how many you've ever heard people look you in the faith say well we just take the bible we just take jesus i've had him say i'm a red letter christian i only take the red letter and then when they want to argue a point they don't give me one red light or they're all over paul i mean but because it's a spirit you see they go in defense mode they're going to defend because they got a characteristic about them can moab had an outstanding characteristic now remember what he wanted is he wanted israel not to go through his land just go someplace else go around leave us alone because you lick up the ground well that's what the word of god does it licks up your own ideas it devours your own self-righteousness it conforms you into the image of christ but they didn't want none of that he says he said though it was a type he says they moved right along he said they had a spin rock and and they was the called out children of god so they had the blessings of god moving right along with them emphasis on moving and they was the called out children of god perfect type of the bride in malachi 4 5. i i said that now we find that so perfectly typed here in them churches of today as moab was not so israel was sojourner from place to place wherever the pillar of fire moved they moved with it moab not so they were settled down in their denomination down they were settled down in their own denomination down in their own nation they didn't moved they stayed right there that became the final definition they wouldn't move they settled down they built their lifestyle they built their righteousness they built their interpretation they looked so close it would deceive the very elected if possible but the thing that they wouldn't do is they wouldn't allow the spirit of god to move them to lead them to make changes in their personality to make changes in their approach to make changes in their lifestyle they wouldn't even question or allow the spirit of god when jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me so they they they got set no no new revelation no greater understanding in the word of god they understood that this is what we believe it's like saying we have the storehouse we know what's in there but we're not going to eat thereof it might change my spiritual approach it might change the way that i worship i've i've so taken so many things to fortify and interpretations to fortify the place that i'm staying in that i'm going to stay put i don't want anything that's going to change me i don't want to pray about it i don't want to get alone with god and have him speak so instead of that personal opening of the word to me i'm going to take the consensus and without realizing it we have that same internal conflict in us when god wants to change us change our heart maybe change the way we view for somebody maybe take someone that you've got such a perfect grudge against and you've got so much history on all the evil they've done and you've closed off your heart and you closed up your fellowship and the holy spirit's like that dove trying to get in and make that heart right put the love of god in there now i have quotes that i could read that are very similar to this that that you have such compassion for that person you can look back and say well they look at they were just in they were young back then they didn't know okay and and you're willing just to forgive and the holy spirit's there trying to melt your heart take that stony heart out of you put it in the flesh though your sins be crimson i'll make it white as snow and that's and and so he wants you to love somebody the same way that he loved you forgiving you of all unrighteousness teach us to pray our father without in heaven forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us no it doesn't matter if they change because you're not looking for an effect you're not looking for a favorable outcome to you that's what people think if i could get him straightened up or her straighten up it sure make my life look easier well maybe if you changed it would make your life easier too but watch watch what he's saying here he's saying the difference is one wouldn't move they weren't ready to accept anything any new teaching any more growth any more change in their attitude no change in the path that they've already pro predicted and chose to pursue this is the way i'm going that god couldn't even stand in their path with a mule they're sad and that became the identification of the organized church unable to move outside of the boundaries that they placed in their life and no more could god speak to him or give them revelation or enlighten them as we act as we read that that that statement is that i i believe uh there there was no wanting or no growing they were there they were stuck and that's what he said he said they were settled down in their own denomination in their own nation they didn't move they stayed right there they had their celebrities they organized things as they should do and they had their warriors they had their fighters they had their king they they they got their orders from so and so but noah moab seen israel with something they didn't have they seen the mighty power amongst israel and it was a prophet and that prophet was moses and they knowed that when the battle went wrong they just raised up his hands and held them there and the battle changed so they didn't have such as that so they tried to match it with politics and with political pull they sent over to another country and hired a prophet to come over and so they could have a prophet and would have power amongst them just like israel had you see the carnal comparison can you see the carnal church today it's done the same thing and he says notice how the spiritual is applied to prove the natural way is wrong and we won't go farther because it'll take us a little longer but they said they sent israel over we do the same thing if we hear the lord speak to us we don't like it we go we stream to another place we go get another message we go searching until something comes that says it just the way but that's not what the church was built on we're built on spiritual divine revelation from god to each individual heart and god doesn't change his mind about his word he has not changed dealing with you as an individual and personally giving you divine revelation and dealing with your heart and changing you and molding you into what he wants you to be amen god bless you tomorrow with tonight's communion and you can take it from there god said come have communion so if you're streaming at home and you're not sick and and you haven't already made plans with the world come out to communion it's one of the three ordinances that god said that he would have to do if you don't like me i can understand that and you you don't like what we teach i can understand that also but don't not take communion so if you you can't do communion here go to the catholic church better than what you're doing why one form of adultery is as bad as another form of adultery you know i mean that what difference you know you're not gonna wash feet you're not going to take communion so do something wash one another's feet serve communion to

turn the service to brother billy and the musicians come it says let us bow our heads dear lord jesus we are assembled again in your name with great expectation for the outpouring of the quickening power of god to bring us into recognition of our position and place and our responsibilities as being a called people separated from the world dedicated to god granted lord tonight that the blessings
