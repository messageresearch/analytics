[45:39] pray and ask the Lord to bless us amen
[45:42] father we just ask you to bless us this

[47:15] lives in your hand we ask you to guide
[47:19] us this evening in Jesus name we pray
[47:22] amen amen
[47:26] Lord bless you tonight if you have your
[47:28] Bibles I'd like to turn to a couple
[47:32] scriptures one fund in the 6th chapter
[47:35] of Hosea and we'd like to read there and
[47:42] then we'd also want to turn over to the
[47:46] Book of Revelations and read from the
[47:52] lady Elsie in church age so let's listen
[47:57] to this call and I just kind of like to
[48:01] draw a parallel a little bit of this
[48:04] call that Hosea is making and kind of
[48:10] compare it to the day that we're living
[48:14] in now and I I don't normally title my
[48:19] sermons but I'd like to talk talk on the
[48:23] topic tonight about not forgetting the
[48:27] bigger picture don't forget the bigger
[48:30] picture and it's easy sometimes to get
[48:34] bogged down in details but let's don't
[48:38] forget the bigger picture and so we like
[48:42] to read this scripture found in FEA 6
[48:45] and 1 come and let us return unto the
[48:50] Lord for he hath torn and he will heal
[48:54] us he hath smitten and he will bind us
[48:59] up after two days will he revived us in
[49:04] the third day he will raise this up and
[49:07] we shall live in his
[49:10] site then shall we know if we follow on
[49:15] to know the Lord his goings forth is
[49:20] prepared as the morning and he shall
[49:23] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[49:27] and former rain under the earth o refirm
[49:32] what shall I do unto thee O Judah what
[49:37] shall I do unto thee for your goodness
[49:41] is as the morning cloud and as the early
[49:45] do it goeth away therefore have i hewed
[49:49] them by the prophets I have slain them
[49:55] by the words of my mouth and they and
[49:59] thy judgments are as light that goeth
[50:03] forth for I desire mercy and not
[50:07] sacrifice and the knowledge of God more
[50:11] than burnt offerings amen and let's turn
[50:15] over to revelations and three and 14 and
[50:20] let's read a few scriptures here tonight
[50:25] together and all this is very familiar
[50:29] to you I know but because there's all
[50:33] these seven church ages this is the one
[50:38] that we have to deal with yeah and so
[50:41] and it says under the angel of the
[50:44] church of lady osya write these things
[50:50] saith the Amen the faithful and true
[50:53] witness the beginning of the creation of
[50:57] God I know thy works and that thou art
[51:02] neither cold nor hot I would that that
[51:07] were cold or hot
[51:08] so because thou art lukewarm and neither
[51:12] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[51:16] mouth because they'll say if I am rich
[51:19] and increased with Goods and have need
[51:22] of nothing
[51:24] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[51:26] and miserable poor and blind and naked I
[51:32] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[51:39] the fire that thou may s be rich and
[51:43] white raiment that thou may us be
[51:47] clothed and that the shame of thy
[51:50] nakedness does not appear and anoint
[51:54] thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may a
[51:58] see as many as I love I rebuke and
[52:02] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[52:06] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[52:09] if any man hear my voice and open the
[52:13] door I will come into him and he will
[52:17] sup and will sup with him and he with me
[52:22] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[52:26] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[52:31] overcome and set down with my father in
[52:35] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[52:39] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[52:44] churches Amen father bless your word god
[52:47] bless you you may be seated
[52:53] you know these scriptures are a
[52:57] marvelous prophecy and we can certainly
[53:02] identify the characteristics of our
[53:06] country of the world of the time that
[53:12] these scriptures are referring to and as
[53:16] we look at this and when I talk about
[53:20] don't forget the bigger picture I think
[53:25] when we realize this we got to
[53:26] understand we've got to look back over
[53:29] the last ol if I could say the last 50
[53:34] 60 70 years maybe the last 100
[53:38] years of our country and we've got to
[53:41] understand the progress that we've made
[53:44] and and the increase that we have had in
[53:50] the blessings that and the riches that
[53:54] now surround man I believe it was one of
[53:57] the brothers just ministered here not
[54:00] long ago but how far that we've come in
[54:03] the last hundred years from horse and
[54:06] buggy to automobiles to planes to
[54:10] sending satellites in the sky how we
[54:15] went from the Pony Express the instant
[54:18] messaging and and this great
[54:22] accomplishment that man has accomplished
[54:26] and so we we see that the great picture
[54:31] that is starting to be drawn here and so
[54:36] when I talk about not forgetting the
[54:39] bigger picture when you begin to
[54:42] understand that it's in these last
[54:44] hundred years if I'll use a good broad
[54:48] swipe of the brush is that man begin to
[54:52] move away from God that that's what man
[54:56] did he became less and less important in
[55:01] their lives man began to turn more and
[55:06] more away from the Word of God they
[55:10] begin to change what their values were
[55:16] what their morality was things begin to
[55:22] slip into the church and we begin to
[55:26] realize that the church began to get
[55:30] into a Sodom condition and and in his
[55:36] scripture says as it was in the days of
[55:39] Noah as it was in the days of Sodom and
[55:43] Gomorrah
[55:45] so there was a picture drawn in the
[55:49] scriptures and
[55:51] scriptures even this portion of
[55:54] Scripture was written by John envisioned
[55:58] on the Isle of Patmos so many many years
[56:01] ago that he could actually begin to
[56:04] describe the characteristics of the age
[56:09] the condition of the people the
[56:13] condition of their thinking and and that
[56:17] man was going away from God their
[56:24] goodness began to be like the morning
[56:27] dew it was gone and so no longer was the
[56:33] people holding to the scriptures and
[56:37] holding to the Bible but man begin to
[56:41] put their own interpretation on the
[56:45] scripture they begin to take away that
[56:48] they felt was right and a way that was
[56:52] good and they began to discuss that way
[56:55] amongst themselves and they began to
[56:58] come to conclusions and and they begin
[57:03] to come to consensus of what was right
[57:07] and what was wrong and it wouldn't even
[57:10] go back is so long to where that you
[57:15] would never ever see a Christian woman
[57:19] in a pair of shorts I mean it just would
[57:23] be something that would be unheard of
[57:26] and they didn't have to be a believer of
[57:29] this message they didn't even have to be
[57:32] Pentecostal it was just their morality
[57:36] of their conviction to what was right
[57:41] and and we realized that as this world
[57:46] began to work on and destroy the
[57:51] morality of the people how Hollywood
[57:54] begin to spring up in the forties and
[57:58] television programs and music began to
[58:02] be able to go over the air
[58:04] they begin to condition the standards
[58:10] and begin to bring down the morality of
[58:14] women we did a study and we were talking
[58:17] the other day with the brothers and they
[58:19] better mention this song that was sung I
[58:22] believe way back in the 20s or early 30s
[58:25] about rolling down little girl rolling
[58:29] down and if you would go listen to that
[58:32] song and you look here that this is
[58:35] going out and it's sowing seed into the
[58:38] people's mind
[58:39] it's sowing a thought process into the
[58:42] people's mind it's trying to change
[58:44] their understanding of what the position
[58:47] and the place that it is and it's not
[58:50] the place that man put things it wasn't
[58:54] the place that the preachers put things
[58:56] it was the places that the word put
[58:59] things the positioning of God being the
[59:03] creator and how that he made things and
[59:07] how that he wanted them positioned and
[59:09] the position that he wanted the the
[59:11] sisters to play the positions that he
[59:14] wanted the brothers to play he wanted
[59:17] men to be providers he since the fall he
[59:21] wanted them to work by the sweat of
[59:23] their brow to bring forth of the earth
[59:26] and defeat and he wanted the woman to be
[59:29] sanctified in childbearing these were
[59:32] not things that man said up these were
[59:35] things that God said up and a woman was
[59:38] made that way and in turn spirit her
[59:41] spirit lean that way but if someone
[59:44] wanted to change the world and change
[59:46] the nature and change the thinking then
[59:50] he would begin to work on those things
[59:51] he would begin to preach his philosophy
[59:55] he would begin to preach his his way to
[59:57] try to get women to move away to get
[1:00:01] into the workplace to let their let
[1:00:04] their morals down to to get them to the
[1:00:08] place where that I have a right
[1:00:09] I'm equal and I have a right so you've
[1:00:13] got to see that this was the country
[1:00:16] begin to
[1:00:17] move this way men were moving away from
[1:00:22] God and because man was moving away from
[1:00:28] God and churches he wanted to be
[1:00:32] successful they began to count their
[1:00:36] success by members instead of by birth
[1:00:40] that it was no longer important that a
[1:00:44] person was borned again and and that
[1:00:47] their life was coalesced had a marvelous
[1:00:54] conversion and a marvelous translation
[1:00:58] and there was something that took place
[1:01:01] in the change of their nature
[1:01:03] no man wanted to start getting lukewarm
[1:01:08] that was a condition they were going
[1:01:12] away from God they were abandoning the
[1:01:14] principles of God they were abandoning
[1:01:17] the Word of God and they began to
[1:01:20] substitute their thinking for God's
[1:01:25] thinking there are interpretations for
[1:01:28] the interpretations of God's Word men
[1:01:31] didn't even wait on God to interpret his
[1:01:34] word they draw the conclusion and they
[1:01:37] got a consensus and and if two of them
[1:01:40] decided or three of them decided they
[1:01:43] began to form groups and in the
[1:01:45] condition of it just became to such a
[1:01:49] terrible place that God being rich in
[1:01:54] mercy sent a message like he always did
[1:02:03] every time Israel would move away from
[1:02:05] God God would send a message to him he
[1:02:11] even knows ie told them come back to me
[1:02:14] come back to me if you don't come back
[1:02:16] to me I'm going to send your captivity
[1:02:18] back to you come back to me if God's
[1:02:21] always had a plea to men to come back to
[1:02:25] him
[1:02:25] come back to me return back if and
[1:02:29] that's the desire that
[1:02:31] that God has and so he he calls out to
[1:02:35] men and and the voice that God always
[1:02:41] chose to call out the people all through
[1:02:45] the time and in this last day he
[1:02:48] promised that he would send a voice to
[1:02:51] return the hearts of the children to
[1:02:56] their fathers to return us back to the
[1:03:00] principles of God to turn us back to the
[1:03:03] things of God and so when we began to
[1:03:06] look at the the bigger picture we've got
[1:03:10] to recognize the day that we're in and
[1:03:14] we've got to recognize what the message
[1:03:17] was from God took the days could that
[1:03:22] we're in and and you know the way the
[1:03:25] church was heading it was getting cold
[1:03:30] it was getting formal it was becoming
[1:03:35] more towards pleasing of men than
[1:03:38] pleasing of God they had to change
[1:03:41] things so they can get members because
[1:03:47] they begin to compare themselves they
[1:03:49] begin to want to have big buildings just
[1:03:51] think we have as many here tonight is
[1:03:54] any great big gigantic building across
[1:03:57] this city
[1:04:01] they're just storehouses for pews and
[1:04:05] chairs and screens and Technology
[1:04:09] they're just as bare-boned tonight what
[1:04:13] a sign what a symbol what a what a start
[1:04:21] look from God's viewpoint what he really
[1:04:25] thinks about buildings what he really
[1:04:27] thinks about systems what he really
[1:04:29] thinks about organizations he doesn't
[1:04:32] want sacrifice he wants the knowledge of
[1:04:35] God in the heart of the believer the
[1:04:37] knowledge of God's Word the truth of
[1:04:40] God's Word the Spirit of God living out
[1:04:43] lit candle a burning light the say the
[1:04:47] works that I do shall you do also didn't
[1:04:52] want a church that takes the sign of the
[1:04:55] believer away doesn't want a church that
[1:04:59] rests they're very eternal destiny on
[1:05:05] what they believe who wasn't a church
[1:05:07] that rests their eternal destiny on who
[1:05:10] they've meant that they know him
[1:05:16] they know him for the God that he is
[1:05:19] they know him for his word before he is
[1:05:23] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:05:25] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:05:29] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:05:32] dwelt among us and even Jesus speaking
[1:05:36] to the Jews he said if I would have not
[1:05:38] have come and preached to you then you
[1:05:43] could you would be without sin but
[1:05:47] because you say that you see he says now
[1:05:52] you have no excuse you're without sin so
[1:05:56] you've got to recognize the bigger
[1:05:58] picture this country this world this
[1:06:03] civilization this end time was leaving
[1:06:07] the presence of God and coming under the
[1:06:10] influence of being agnostics and also
[1:06:14] coming to the fact that Satan was
[1:06:17] setting up his Eden and he was now
[1:06:21] becoming the god of this evil age he had
[1:06:26] succeeded in hacking God up into three
[1:06:29] persons he had succeeded in putting a
[1:06:33] nickel ad in spirit to govern the people
[1:06:37] don't forget the bigger picture excuse
[1:06:40] me I'd like just to read a few
[1:06:44] statements if I could just out of the
[1:06:49] the radio see a church age and
[1:06:55] em and this is a good book for maybe if
[1:07:00] you have a little more time at home and
[1:07:03] or you finished your work at home and
[1:07:06] and you have a few moments take this
[1:07:09] lady OC in church age and read it read
[1:07:13] it as he speaks of it here he says now
[1:07:17] we just read the scripture in lady osya
[1:07:21] he says I know thy works doubt that are
[1:07:25] neither cold nor hot I would that you
[1:07:28] are cold a hot so then because thou art
[1:07:32] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:07:36] spew thee out of my mouth now so many
[1:07:39] times we take that scripture and we
[1:07:42] think it applies to works you understand
[1:07:48] doing good things well there's many of
[1:07:51] people who don't even believe in God
[1:07:54] that would outshine many a Christian as
[1:07:58] far as good works there's people who
[1:08:03] don't believe in the Lord who are
[1:08:05] donating and putting their lives on the
[1:08:08] line to be fighting this disease that's
[1:08:11] striking the country so it's not that it
[1:08:15] goes deeper than that listen as we read
[1:08:18] this he said the word is supposed to be
[1:08:23] in our mouths too
[1:08:29] we know that the church is his body it
[1:08:34] is here taking his place now that's the
[1:08:40] definition of the church going to all
[1:08:44] the world preach the gospel these signs
[1:08:49] shall follow them that believe the
[1:08:52] church is here taking his place to
[1:08:56] preach his word
[1:08:58] now watch the condition of the church
[1:09:01] watch the bigger picture the Bible
[1:09:05] hasn't changed the prophecy for the age
[1:09:08] hasn't changed
[1:09:09] the scriptural morals haven't changed
[1:09:12] Peter hasn't changed Paul hasn't changed
[1:09:15] James hasn't changed the book of
[1:09:17] Revelation hasn't changed the Bible
[1:09:19] hasn't changed it's the way that man
[1:09:21] reads it that's changed now we know the
[1:09:31] church is his body it's here to take
[1:09:34] this place what will be in the mouth of
[1:09:37] the church the word first Peter 4 and 11
[1:09:43] If any man speak let him speak as the
[1:09:48] Oracles Word of God If any man speak let
[1:09:53] him say what the word says if any man
[1:09:58] gives his opinion on a subject let it be
[1:10:02] a word based opinion if any man is going
[1:10:07] to make a judgment let it be a word
[1:10:10] based judgment if anybody's going to
[1:10:13] treat his brother or his neighbor let it
[1:10:16] be a word based treatment the word is
[1:10:21] what should be in the mouth of a person
[1:10:23] because a word is a thought express so
[1:10:26] the thoughts of God should be in the
[1:10:29] believer so that the word of God will be
[1:10:32] in his mouth but when they took the
[1:10:36] thoughts of men and they took carnal
[1:10:40] interpretations and they weren't fervent
[1:10:47] to the Word of God
[1:10:49] fervent on fire for number one first
[1:10:53] source of anything what are you gonna do
[1:11:00] what the word says what are you gonna do
[1:11:04] in this situation what the word says
[1:11:06] what advice are you gonna give what the
[1:11:09] word says how are you gonna act how the
[1:11:11] word says so it says that and he says if
[1:11:16] any man speak let him speak
[1:11:18] the Oracles the Word of God first Peter
[1:11:21] 1 in 22
[1:11:23] for the prophecy came not in old times
[1:11:26] by the will of man so what's now
[1:11:34] happening the bigger picture it's the
[1:11:37] will of man is pushing out the Word of
[1:11:42] God man has now set their own course
[1:11:48] they think they've set their own course
[1:11:52] but it's Satan building and Eden it's
[1:11:58] Satan who wanted to exalt themselves
[1:12:01] above the stars above the messengers of
[1:12:04] the church so he's exalting his thinking
[1:12:09] his religion his morals his attitude
[1:12:14] what he thinks his prosperity over the
[1:12:18] stars or over the message of the Word of
[1:12:23] God but holy men of God spake as they
[1:12:31] were moved by the Holy Spirit then what
[1:12:35] is wrong with these people of the last
[1:12:38] days they have gotten away from the word
[1:12:44] they are no longer fervent about it they
[1:12:48] are lukewarm about it I'm going to prove
[1:12:52] that right now so the bigger picture is
[1:12:57] what's happening to the church the
[1:13:03] church now is being influenced by the
[1:13:08] world they're establishing their own
[1:13:12] rights they do see a people's right my
[1:13:17] right to do this my right to do this my
[1:13:21] right can worship God the way that I
[1:13:23] want to worship God my right to believe
[1:13:25] and now here's the government they're
[1:13:27] right behind that
[1:13:32] but God's not gods not as we read yes
[1:13:39] sir the church is no longer the
[1:13:42] mouthpiece of God it is its own
[1:13:47] mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[1:13:53] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:13:58] and the bride for the voice of God will
[1:14:06] be in her look at the bigger picture now
[1:14:10] okay he's going to confound at this
[1:14:12] world with his prophet in his bride
[1:14:16] because the voice of God which is the
[1:14:19] Word of God will be in her no I don't
[1:14:25] have to go that way no I don't have to
[1:14:28] do this I am NOT going to leave the Word
[1:14:31] of God I am going to take the Word of
[1:14:33] God if they can threaten what you want
[1:14:36] but if God be for you who can be against
[1:14:39] you if you have the Word of God in your
[1:14:42] lips and you stand for God God will
[1:14:45] stand for you I have not seen the
[1:14:47] righteous baked bread let Satan's whole
[1:14:50] purpose it is to discredit the Word of
[1:14:54] God to make the Word of God of none
[1:14:57] effect this is what they're doing
[1:15:03] they've left the Word of God they're not
[1:15:06] the mouthpiece of God they're their own
[1:15:08] mouthpiece yes it is
[1:15:13] for it says in the last chapter of the
[1:15:17] seventeenth verse the spirit and the
[1:15:20] bride say come and may I say that it has
[1:15:25] to be the two together it can be the
[1:15:28] bride just reading books and quoting
[1:15:33] tapes and from some academic
[1:15:36] intellectual standpoint it's got to be
[1:15:40] spiritual food-induced seasoned seasoned
[1:15:43] by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] season by real experience season by a
[1:15:51] born-again life that's quickening that
[1:15:56] word and making that word alive coming
[1:15:59] out of your mind into your mouth and
[1:16:02] being the spoken word in the last days
[1:16:05] because they are the voice of the last
[1:16:08] day and the spirit and the bride say
[1:16:14] come
[1:16:17] once more the world will hear direct
[1:16:22] from God as at Pentecost but of course
[1:16:26] that word bride will be repudiated as it
[1:16:31] was in the first stage you have to
[1:16:35] understand the bride and the message is
[1:16:39] the same thing there's not a message and
[1:16:46] a bride the Prophet was the mouthpiece
[1:16:51] of the bride amen it was saying what
[1:16:56] they believed you might have not to
[1:16:58] believed it yet but when you heard it
[1:17:00] you already had an Amen built inside of
[1:17:03] you and you said that's true that's
[1:17:06] right that's the way it is so if it's
[1:17:11] not two voices it's not two lives it's
[1:17:15] not a different spirit by one spirit
[1:17:19] into one body we are all baptized now he
[1:17:26] has cried out in this last age you have
[1:17:31] the word you have more Bibles than ever
[1:17:34] but what are but you are not doing
[1:17:39] anything about the word except dividing
[1:17:44] and hacking it into pieces don't you
[1:17:51] think that if there's one true word and
[1:17:53] one true spirit and men were under the
[1:17:58] birth of the
[1:17:59] spirit and under the leadership of the
[1:18:02] author they'd be saying the same thing
[1:18:04] but because they're not saying the same
[1:18:08] thing it cannot produce a spiritual
[1:18:11] unity it can produce a political unity
[1:18:15] in a world council of churches just like
[1:18:18] we got a Democratic Party in a
[1:18:20] Republican party and a libertarian party
[1:18:23] and all kinds of parties and they all
[1:18:29] unite but they're not united very
[1:18:35] strange time he said but all you do is
[1:18:42] you hack it into pieces all kinds of
[1:18:45] different doctrines all kind of
[1:18:46] different teachings one contradicting
[1:18:49] the other and everybody trying to hold
[1:18:54] the people in not by an experience but
[1:18:57] by a gymnasium by this program by that
[1:19:01] program by mothers day out by
[1:19:04] babysitters my schools by this so
[1:19:07] in-person ways something they don't wait
[1:19:09] by the Word of God they waited by
[1:19:12] worldly benefits now remember this is
[1:19:16] the bigger picture this is what the
[1:19:20] church is doing it's blind miserable
[1:19:27] poor wretched and naked not worldly poor
[1:19:33] spiritually poor not worldly blind I've
[1:19:38] got an email from this company and what
[1:19:44] they are is they're a company that keeps
[1:19:46] track of every new person that moves
[1:19:51] into your neighborhood and what they'll
[1:19:55] do they'll immediately send you the
[1:20:01] information of this new person I only
[1:20:06] have one question
[1:20:07] do I have an exclusive no if not and
[1:20:15] everybody just becomes a door salesman
[1:20:18] knock knock I'm Baptist knock knock I'm
[1:20:22] Methodist not God they gotta have a
[1:20:24] sales pitch think I have something to
[1:20:28] offer they're no longer the mouthpiece
[1:20:32] of God they become their own mouthpiece
[1:20:36] can you imagine hi I'm from Christian
[1:20:39] Life Tabernacle I heard you just moved
[1:20:41] into the neighborhood have you been
[1:20:43] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:45] Christ
[1:20:46] are you free from your sin are you born
[1:20:51] again have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] have you kicked the TV out of your home
[1:20:56] have you applied the token and got rid
[1:20:58] of the rock-and-roll music has your wife
[1:21:00] taking her pants off are she still
[1:21:03] cutting her hair is she not adorned in
[1:21:05] gold things she does not painted her
[1:21:08] face like Jezebel
[1:21:10] now you wouldn't say it all like that
[1:21:12] but that's your message why because
[1:21:15] that's the condition the world's got
[1:21:17] into and the bigger picture was God sent
[1:21:21] a messenger to warn her that he was on
[1:21:27] the path to destruction we can't forget
[1:21:32] that this world has not changed their
[1:21:37] course they're on the same Road they've
[1:21:40] been on the only people who have changed
[1:21:45] their course is the elected seed of God
[1:21:48] they change their course because they
[1:21:51] heard the message they heard the warning
[1:21:55] they recognize their day and its message
[1:22:00] 10 forgets a bigger picture you can't
[1:22:05] forget the world is still hidden
[1:22:13] he says you don't do nothing about it
[1:22:15] you says he says you divide it and hack
[1:22:24] into pieces taking what you want and
[1:22:29] leaving out what you don't want oh
[1:22:35] that's what I said Sunday God's good
[1:22:39] God's wonderful God is a blessing he
[1:22:43] blesses me he provides for me
[1:22:46] oh he's may deliver he's my healer yes
[1:22:49] he keeps his word
[1:22:52] that's his side of it but take the other
[1:22:56] side you just can't take what you want
[1:22:58] and leave out the instructions to
[1:23:02] womanhood the instructions to young
[1:23:05] ladies the instructions to young men you
[1:23:10] can't you got to take all of it that's
[1:23:13] why the word says if you take any part
[1:23:15] out of it or add anything to it your
[1:23:18] name is taken out of the book of life
[1:23:21] let us just read on you leave what you
[1:23:25] want you are not interested in living it
[1:23:30] but debating it I would sooner you were
[1:23:35] cold or hot if you were cold and
[1:23:38] rejected I could stand it if you would
[1:23:43] get white-hot and know the truth and
[1:23:46] live it I would praise you for that but
[1:23:51] when you simply take my word and don't
[1:23:55] honor it and in return must refuse in
[1:24:01] return I must refuse to honor you I will
[1:24:05] spew thee out of my mouth for you
[1:24:11] nauseate me can you can you see the the
[1:24:18] picture today you can see the bigger
[1:24:23] picture
[1:24:23] they claim to be spiritually rich but
[1:24:27] they have no impact on the community
[1:24:31] more people are in churches and yet
[1:24:34] there's more adultery more people are in
[1:24:37] churches and yet there's more drinking
[1:24:39] more people aren't churches and yet
[1:24:41] there's more juvenile delinquency
[1:24:43] there's more drug addiction there's more
[1:24:46] alcoholism people have abandoned the
[1:24:48] church and they take it on psychiatrists
[1:24:53] and yet they feel they have God this
[1:25:00] message was God warning us telling us I
[1:25:09] counsel thee I counsel thee buy of me
[1:25:16] gold tried in fire put on the character
[1:25:19] of Christ put the Word of God in your
[1:25:22] mouth if he sends a messenger to tell
[1:25:31] the people what God seen God's viewpoint
[1:25:37] you think you're rich but God don't you
[1:25:41] think you increase with goods but God
[1:25:44] don't God's been just and loving and
[1:25:48] kind to send a vindicated word of
[1:25:53] warning and judgment so that man could
[1:25:57] turn their hearts back to God and if
[1:26:01] they reject it then what can simply be
[1:26:08] said we can't forget the bigger picture
[1:26:15] we can't we can't lose the understanding
[1:26:19] of why that this message came in the
[1:26:22] first place it didn't come to produce a
[1:26:26] bunch of young theologians
[1:26:31] we got guys not 40 years old there's
[1:26:34] such knowledgeable scholars in the
[1:26:38] things of God what happened to the
[1:26:44] backside of the desert experience I
[1:26:48] really enjoyed something I heard brother
[1:26:52] Bissell say in a testimony he said I
[1:26:57] grew up I didn't have nothing I didn't
[1:26:59] have the father I didn't have a mother I
[1:27:01] didn't have any good things wasn't a
[1:27:03] pity party he said if it was those
[1:27:07] things that I went through that prepared
[1:27:11] me for the mission field people are
[1:27:18] prepared by the Spirit of God you're not
[1:27:24] prepared by the books and the tapes in
[1:27:28] letter form you're prepared by hearing
[1:27:33] the Word of God and the Spirit of God
[1:27:36] quickening the Word of God and giving
[1:27:39] you the revelation of transformation
[1:27:45] it's not putting this bride together
[1:27:50] don't forget the bigger picture we know
[1:27:53] it's election we know the message was
[1:27:57] sent to a people that would hear it we
[1:28:01] know they're the bride but what their
[1:28:04] call is is to put on white raiment
[1:28:08] character tried and fire works that are
[1:28:15] worthy of the word of God we can't
[1:28:19] forget the bigger picture we can't
[1:28:22] forget that where we are and recognizing
[1:28:25] the day and it's message the bigger
[1:28:31] picture
[1:28:32] don't forget there's no need of sitting
[1:28:35] around and keep patting one another on
[1:28:38] the back and praising one another we
[1:28:42] have got to know whether we possess the
[1:28:45] goods what goodness that they do to say
[1:28:51] who we are if Satan can walk through our
[1:28:53] door any time he wants to if there's no
[1:28:57] birding for lost souls
[1:28:58] there's no hunger to share this word of
[1:29:01] God
[1:29:01] there's no seek in you least if this is
[1:29:06] the days of sodom and gomorrah we can be
[1:29:08] like abraham and beat our word into
[1:29:11] plowshares and go out and find our lost
[1:29:15] brother but have we got to the place
[1:29:21] that we just disputing doctrine and
[1:29:24] terminology and everybody's trying to
[1:29:27] come up with a better vocabulary to
[1:29:29] explain the mysteries than somebody else
[1:29:32] sometimes I feel like Paul must have
[1:29:35] felt he said I went up there to their
[1:29:37] big meeting and they didn't add anything
[1:29:40] to my revelation why he had meant the
[1:29:43] author when they were talking to brother
[1:29:46] Branham and they were discussing all
[1:29:48] this stuff they said oh brother branham
[1:29:50] you don't know your Bible yeah but I
[1:29:53] know the author real well we need to get
[1:29:58] back in contact with the author of this
[1:30:01] message back in context
[1:30:05] it's the spirit and the bride that say
[1:30:09] come look at where we are and the
[1:30:16] Gentiles are called out the bride is
[1:30:21] ready the rapture is at hand
[1:30:24] can we realise that can we actually
[1:30:28] believe that is that a story that's been
[1:30:33] told is it a myth to us is it something
[1:30:39] that sounds real is it something that we
[1:30:45] outside
[1:30:46] can be leave or is it something that's
[1:30:50] in US that's a part of us that's more
[1:30:55] than life to us Ricki nice the message
[1:31:00] he said is it something that we can
[1:31:03] believe on the outside but is it really
[1:31:08] part of us that's having the word in
[1:31:11] your mouth because that's the thought
[1:31:14] you express what proceedeth from but the
[1:31:17] abundance of the heart and the mouth
[1:31:20] what proceedeth from the mouth comes
[1:31:22] from the abundance of the heart listen
[1:31:27] what that question is look at the bigger
[1:31:30] picture let's don't miss what it is that
[1:31:34] God is wanting to see believe me he
[1:31:39] already explained this message through
[1:31:42] the messenger I don't care how you put
[1:31:46] the quotes together you're never going
[1:31:47] to teach it and explain it any better
[1:31:50] than he did we don't need an explanation
[1:31:52] we need a revelation
[1:31:57] is this something we come we outside can
[1:32:03] believe or is this something that's in
[1:32:05] us that's a part of us that's more than
[1:32:08] life to us what attitude do we set in
[1:32:12] this morning in this Tabernacle remember
[1:32:16] it'll be a small flock that receives it
[1:32:21] think of it think of the God of this
[1:32:25] evil age think of Satan's Eden think
[1:32:29] there's a man that can turn on the light
[1:32:31] who do you say this is think of all the
[1:32:35] effort that he went to vindicate the
[1:32:38] message to get the people in this world
[1:32:41] to understand they're drifting away from
[1:32:44] God and are we going to go back and
[1:32:47] build the same thing
[1:32:51] let's pray the Lord help us
[1:32:54] the seals are open it's revealed to us
[1:33:00] we see what they left off you want to
[1:33:05] debate and fuss about serpent seed and
[1:33:08] water baptism and so forth you're
[1:33:12] blinded and don't know it the god of
[1:33:15] this world has blinded you to it and you
[1:33:19] don't know it wonder I have such a time
[1:33:23] this morning fighting them pressures so
[1:33:29] has he chopped out his bride from the
[1:33:31] denomination by his word promised by
[1:33:35] Malachi for in the last days chopped out
[1:33:39] his bride pewter from the rest of the
[1:33:42] churches hewed out his bride he chopped
[1:33:46] out his profits through with his profits
[1:33:50] by the word chopping Israel separate
[1:33:54] yourself from the rest of them what time
[1:33:59] is it brother
[1:34:00] what time is it minister do you see the
[1:34:04] time of the day and the sign you're
[1:34:09] living under can you understand it do
[1:34:13] you see it in other words are we missing
[1:34:15] the bigger picture have we lost what's
[1:34:20] happening and what's going on and start
[1:34:25] dwelling in two pages and doctrines and
[1:34:30] mysteries and teachings are we starting
[1:34:35] to be more impressed with what how a
[1:34:39] sermon is delivered and the emotion
[1:34:42] instead of the true value of God's Word
[1:34:51] everywhere now
[1:34:52] there's no revival everybody's
[1:34:56] complaining ministers crying I was
[1:34:58] reading one of the outstanding papers
[1:35:00] that comes here to the church a very
[1:35:04] fine paper and now I know the editor I
[1:35:07] know the people and they are godly
[1:35:09] people very fine brothers and sisters
[1:35:11] more The Herald of is coming one of the
[1:35:14] finest papers on the field Herald is
[1:35:17] coming but they hardly print anything
[1:35:20] unless it's about fast pray fast pray
[1:35:26] well I wonder if we've just substituted
[1:35:30] fast pray with this is who we are this
[1:35:35] is who we are we're yet where the bride
[1:35:38] were the one know until it's manifested
[1:35:42] it can be disputed it can be questioned
[1:35:51] it's not a self Proclamation it's an
[1:35:55] identification given by the Spirit of
[1:35:59] God on an anointed seed of God that
[1:36:03] identification belongs solely to him to
[1:36:09] identify his ride it is not given to the
[1:36:12] ministry to identify the bride it's not
[1:36:15] given to the ministry to send a pep-talk
[1:36:17] it's not given to the ministry to
[1:36:19] explain it's given to God to quicken the
[1:36:24] seed this is the rising of the Sun sound
[1:36:33] the trumpet how many reads it you know
[1:36:36] see it's all all the time fast pray fast
[1:36:41] pray it's all you hear fast pray we're
[1:36:45] going to have a great breaking of the
[1:36:48] day there's a great thing going to
[1:36:51] happen all you pray pray pray we're not
[1:36:55] too late yet why do they do that
[1:37:01] I say they do that because they missed
[1:37:04] the bigger picture
[1:37:07] they missed what God done in this day
[1:37:10] they missed the church in the world has
[1:37:13] left God read lady you'll see it's
[1:37:16] urgent they left God but he stood at the
[1:37:19] door and knocked on the heart of the
[1:37:22] believer personal why did you do that
[1:37:29] why do they do that they want a Great
[1:37:33] Awakening they're crying believing that
[1:37:36] there will be an awakening they're good
[1:37:41] people why is it what have they done
[1:37:45] they have not recognized the awakening
[1:37:49] of the bride
[1:37:53] that's not past or future tense that's a
[1:38:00] personal awakening of the bride you've
[1:38:05] got to recognize your awakening you've
[1:38:09] got a recce and I said I'm not part of a
[1:38:12] church I'm not part of a movement I'm
[1:38:15] not part of the fellowship I am part of
[1:38:19] an awakening a word of voice a message
[1:38:23] cried out to me and I rose up the
[1:38:28] resurrection started in me with the
[1:38:30] shout the voice the Trump and I've been
[1:38:33] quickened and made aware and I'm a part
[1:38:36] of an awakening not a movement not a
[1:38:42] teaching not a doctrine I think we're
[1:38:46] way too intellectually awoken and I
[1:38:52] think a good refilling would help us all
[1:38:58] they they don't recognize the awakening
[1:39:01] of the bride see by being a Christian
[1:39:04] they feel the pull of the hour but they
[1:39:08] haven't recognized what's been done oh
[1:39:14] my you know what's been done to you
[1:39:19] that's the blessing of it I know I've
[1:39:23] been awakened I know I've heard the cry
[1:39:26] my sheep hear my voice another they
[1:39:29] won't follow
[1:39:30] I saw the path of the world
[1:39:34] my eyes were given I sad and I saw and I
[1:39:40] put on right Randleman that the shame of
[1:39:43] my nakedness didn't appear I bought gold
[1:39:46] tried and fire that I could have
[1:39:48] character and the love of the Spirit and
[1:39:51] the love of God shed abroad in my heart
[1:39:53] by the Holy Spirit I recognized the day
[1:39:59] and its message he says that's what
[1:40:05] makes him feel that way they know
[1:40:07] something is supposed to happen but
[1:40:09] they're looking for it way off in the
[1:40:13] future to come when it's already
[1:40:16] happened right by you you know there's a
[1:40:22] lot of talk about we know you can't
[1:40:30] listen to the news you can't read a
[1:40:32] newspaper I signed an email today yours
[1:40:37] in you know yours and bondage you know
[1:40:42] or law
[1:40:44] I said yours in lockdown you know
[1:40:46] lockdown 19 just 19 I told the guy the
[1:40:51] other day it was really gotten a mess I
[1:40:53] said oh you've been 19 and I thought
[1:40:58] what they're looking for is they're
[1:41:00] looking for a cure
[1:41:03] they're looking for something and you
[1:41:05] know what they do they found out if you
[1:41:08] can take the blood of someone that had
[1:41:12] the disease and you can take that plasma
[1:41:18] and put that in the person they will
[1:41:23] become immune and I thought you know
[1:41:26] something I don't want lady OC yeah I
[1:41:29] don't want to become immune to Lady
[1:41:33] hacia and that what the prophet of God
[1:41:36] said he said the church is getting into
[1:41:39] spiritual amnesia because they get
[1:41:43] hypnotized by the little things and they
[1:41:48] fail to stand back and realize what
[1:41:51] they're a part of you're a part of the
[1:41:54] Great Awakening there was another Great
[1:41:59] Awakening I believe in the Philadelphia
[1:42:01] of age but this is the greatest
[1:42:04] awakening of all time a man I don't want
[1:42:10] to become immune to Lady osya I don't
[1:42:13] want their blood and their philosophies
[1:42:18] and their ideas that make me immune to
[1:42:23] the infection of this age I want to sit
[1:42:27] back I want to step back I want to see
[1:42:31] where I'm at see the day I'm living in
[1:42:35] recognize what God's been doing and ask
[1:42:40] the Lord Lord what would you have me to
[1:42:43] do pray for revelation pray for the
[1:42:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit pray that
[1:42:50] we could be about our father's business
[1:42:52] let's don't look don't lose the bigger
[1:42:57] picture this may come and this will go a
[1:43:02] man will feel they've got the victory
[1:43:05] but they haven't because they didn't
[1:43:10] realize what they were fighting this is
[1:43:13] a decoy
[1:43:17] Jesus says don't fear Him who can
[1:43:21] destroy and deliver your body but fear
[1:43:25] Him who can deliver your soul into hell
[1:43:30] we've got to fear the world and where
[1:43:36] it's trying to take us and recognize the
[1:43:39] awakening of the Word of God come out
[1:43:42] from amongst or my people and be ye
[1:43:45] separate let's don't forget our
[1:43:47] Awakening let's don't forget the love of
[1:43:50] God that he had for us that he would get
[1:43:53] us out of a boat get us out of a road
[1:43:57] get us out of a path that leads to
[1:43:59] destruction why it is the way to
[1:44:01] destruction and many claim to be on it
[1:44:05] and those that are on it claim to have
[1:44:08] God they claim to be worshiping God and
[1:44:11] they think that they're blessed when
[1:44:13] they're really headed for their own
[1:44:15] destruction but yet there was a narrow
[1:44:17] way and few be that find it few be that
[1:44:22] recognized it few be that was awakened
[1:44:26] into it aren't you thankful for God
[1:44:29] don't you love them those of you at home
[1:44:32] oh I just try to look out over here and

[1:45:29] something that's real we're a part of an
[1:45:33] awakening praise God let's don't lose

[1:46:36] there and speed around the little he
[1:46:38] says we don't make traffic stops

[1:47:14] that's what everybody doesn't get along
[1:47:17] the way they thought problems come up
[1:47:21] well that's the law of contrast the law
[1:47:25] of contrast was given so we could make
[1:47:27] an examination of where we are what side
