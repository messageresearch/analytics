our Salvation be our portion tonight and may we just have a time of Fellowship this evening for a few moments in the precious and wonderful name of the Lord Jesus we ask these things amen and amen God bless you if you have your Bibles I certainly enjoyed that uh song tonight that was really great to hear that amen okay let's turn to a a really familiar scripture and and uh found in the gospel of St John the third the thir chapter and the 16th verse and we'd like to read that this evening and then just have a a little time of U just fellowship and and read some scriptures together and then uh not have too long of the evening um so it says in St John the Third chapter in the 16th verse so God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life father we ask you to bless your service this evening in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless BL you may be seated and and while you're seated uh let's turn over to the book of Hebrews because we just want to read together tonight the first two chapters of the book of Hebrews together and and if if I was to have a title um I found it was better for me to title my sermons than to let my sons title my sermons uh because uh uh uh you know they they say Dad I titled your sermon the Everlasting power of the third pole under the opening of the seventh seal with the Fulfillment of the Capstone and uh so I thought maybe a little simpler titles because I'm a kind of a simple preacher but I'd like to title this the first Christmas gift because really that was the first Christmas gift the Lord you giving the Lord his only begotten son to us was the first Christmas gift and I thought about this gift and I I thought a a beautiful way to describe this gift is the way that Paul Paul describes it in this first two chapters of Hebrews as we read it now this is a a gift of God God so loved the world and it was the uh it was the work of his hands it was uh his thoughts expressed as as we uh read in the uh uh uh the uh scriptures that how that God had this thought in his mind and in the beginning was God and God created the heavens and earth he he didn't create it by some other substance he created it of himself so basically he created it with what that he was so it would be like if I reached into me and pulled this part of me out and this part of me out and that part of me out and I took the very substance that I was and made something out of it it would have to be it would have to be special to me because it was me and the heavens and earth was him it was him manifested it was him expressed and so he expressed himself and he loved the world and and we we went through the teaching of this many times but we know that Adam was in this great world that God created for his son so that God would have someone to fellowship with but yet there was a part of God that Adam never knew and uh he didn't know that God was a Healer because nothing needed healing he didn't know that God was a savior because nothing needed saving uh and so those he was a deliverer and Adam didn't know this all he could see was the wonderful glory of God so God allowed a plan to come into effect and that man would fall but man wouldn't really fall per se because he would secure that man by putting his name on The Gift of of the book of life and that gift of man was there now so that was the condition man was in but man was now born in sin shaped in iniquity and came into the world speaking lies and because of the Fall man now had a nature at that that he had no control over so he was driven and and in captive to uh the senses of his flesh and to his emotions you know it's amazing isn't it how easy you can get your feelings hurt you don't even see them you know what I mean but yet they can get hurt so bad and and and you can go someplace and and and you can just sense that you're not welcome or sense that something's wrong and and maybe you can't even put your handle on it or your finger on it so to speak or you don't know what it is but you just feel all upset and nervous and there's just things that go on and these were the things that man was subject to man was subject to death be and that's what happened because the day that you eat thereof is the day that you die and so that was the condition that man was in and and man had nothing to look forward to but a grave and and and uh they they weren't sure of of what would take place next they had different ideas and different things but now God was going to give a gift and that's what we celebrate Christmas is about Christmas is about the birth of Christ uh I know the devil's doing all that he he can to make it a man in a little red suit and uh uh you know I I saw the other day that a hilicopter had gone to a school and dropped in there in the school and I'm sure that they brought Santa Claus in there you know but I thought how much better would it be if maybe we went over there and and had some wise men come in and and had uh maybe uh Joseph and Mary come into the school and and say well here it is this is the gift this is the first gift this is the gift that started what you've got now was because of this gift you're getting your Tonka truck because God gave this gift you're getting you know you've got your tinsel on your tree because God gave this gift everything that you're doing everything you're celebrating everything that that you're receiving you're receiving because God gave this first gift this was the first gift this was the the the first Christmas gift that God gave so let's just read these two chapters just for the next few moments and and let's just take a moment and look at this gift that God gave and I think the as we go on it'll come clearer and clearer when we finally reach our our last conclusion of really how how powerful this gift was and and it's just not an ordinary gift and that's what's that's what's so fantastic about it it it's it's it's a gift that Paul describes here that is so encompassing and so large and so wonderful that he wants to start out talking about the Majesty of this gift now remember this is God's gift to you it it's wonderful you know to uh uh uh have a gift you know uh several years ago uh we were in need of a car so I I knew we had to buy a car so I bought lesie a car for her birthday and uh which was good and you know I put the bow on it and parked in her driveway and and did all that and so we had had the car for a couple years and one day I said I thought you know I I'm going to buy uh I'm going to buy her remote start for her car so when it's cold she can just press some buttons and the engal start up and have remote start so I went to one of the boys and I said hey I'd like to get Mom remote start for her car for Christmas and they said it's already got it two years we had the car and so they went up and they pressed the lock button and then the button on top and the car started well we forgot that simple procedure and uh sister Li Parks helped us remind us the other day and we now we know how to start our our car up but we had it all the time it was part of the gift you understand but we didn't know all that encompassed in the gift all that is in the gift and and and so uh if we just take a few moments and just read this we begin to grasp and understand this gift and so it says now God who had sundried times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets so God used to speak to the People by prophets and and that was the way that God spoke but Paul's now talking about this great gift he says but hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son so this is a gift that speaks this is a gift that will talk to you and communicate with you and so it's a wonderful gift who have a appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world so we we want Paul wants to point out here that this the Majesty of this gift he's speaking to us not by just a prophet not by just some other man not by something that's educated but God gave us a gift to speak to us that was heir of all things and was the creator of all things he made all things by whom also made the worlds so you're getting a gift that made the worlds somebody that made the world is being given to you as a gift this is no shabby gift you understand this ain't no little gift you know what I mean you know like the ones that you got four or five of already uh you know let me say it like this it ain't socks you know what I mean it's this is something real this is something that is is is is all all out it it's full it's maxed out in fact the first gift was the best gift that was ever given amen there would never be another gift like it never a gift that has all that it contains in it that this was not some gift that he's given you now I want you put this in your heart this is your gift it's God's gift to you you he so loved you that he gave you the one that was air to all things and made the world now that's who you'd like to know huh everybody says oh I'd like to know a rich guy you know somebody who's rich he air to all the world so this is the gift that he's talking about and who being in the brightness of his glory and the expressed in image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he hath by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high what a description of this gift the gift that he gave you was the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person can you imagine God giving you the expressed image of his person God's giving you his person the expression and the image of the person of God has been given to you as a gift oh wouldn't you like to know the king well you know the King of Kings you you've been given the expressed image of God what kind of great gift is this this first gift that God gave and and he gave it because he loved you that this is this gift just as we look at this he said being made so much better than the angels and he as he hath by inheritance obtained more excellent Name than they so he wants us to understand God's just not sending down an angel okay this isn't just uh uh some uh spiritual fella you know what I mean or or some angel or uh or some lesser uh emissary you know it's like you it's like in the government and in in stuff like that of course you'd like the king to come to your birthday party but because you don't really cut have much cut much mustard with the King he he sends maybe a lower adversary you know you might get a a a a duke or something you know instead of the king you know you you get uh you you you maybe not even get a prince but you just get somebody lower on the totem pole look he's saying this isn't an angel this isn't somebody Downstream this isn't a lower emary this is the highest dignitary that there is in the kingdom of God and he's just didn't come to visit you he is a gift to you so now you have them you possess them he's yours Hallelujah they more more excellent than they I would be happy with an angel in fact he gave us those two but this is a real gift that God gave because if God does anything he does it to the max you know what I mean he can't he can't do something he it's it if he could give us any anything better he would have this was the best gift he could give the first Christmas gift was the best gift ever given it was above the Angels it it's m It's a Wonderful what it is just this just this description of this first gift is so wonderful for for un which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be be to him a father and he shall be my son so now we see the relationship of this gift that is not an angel It's the Son of God that's who God gave God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son so Paul's going back over this gift again talking to the Hebrew children he says this gift is the Son of God beautiful and again when he bringeth in the first begotten unto the world he said and let all the angels of God worship him so this gift is above the angels and I I just kind of keep dwelling as we talk about this this gift is given to you you for you to possess it's for you for you to if I could use this expression for you to use and to have let's talk about it a little more and the angel said who maketh his Angel spirits and his Ministers of flame of fire but unto the son hath said so he's expressing what he made Angels right angels are ministering spirits that they they're uh you know they have they're they're Ministers of the flame of fire and their Living spirit but he said unto his son he has said again describing this gift and its important and its position in the Kingdom you understand so oh I I like that amen I mean you know it's it's just not it's it's nice you know it's nice to know my son has a friend that works in the white house so he sent us pictures they got him into the White House and he can walk in the places the White House he's allowed to go but man if you knew the president you could go in and have a sandwich at the kitchen table you understand so he wants you to understand the position of the person that you have a gift you know and so we have even the expression in the world it it it's not what you know it's who you know so he he's telling you this gift okay think of this wonderful Jesus that he the Lord's given us but he said to his son thy Throne oh God is forever and ever a seler of righteousness is the seler of the Kingdom that's what he has the seler of the Kingdom thou hath loved righteousness and hateth iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows look at his look at him and the Lord and and thou Lord in the beginning hath laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the works of thy hands now now now let's look at how he's going to describe this gift okay and he's going to compare this gift uh you can buy somebody a gift and it could wear out or it could break you know you know how they get you when you buy something and they said do you want the five-year protection plan for 1895 and the first thing you're thinking is it going to need it you know what I mean so you buy it you know because if you lose it or it breaks you know they just replace it provided they don't go out of business and so you buy the you buy the protection plan now he's going to describe this gift okay how enduring it is you understand the the the depth and the length and the breadth of this gift now you have this gift you may not know it you may not realize it but this is the first Christmas gift that God gave you he says he says and the in the beginning hath laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands and they in other words The Works of thy hands and they Shall Perish right heavens and earth shall pass away and so he's saying and they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vest vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy years shall not fail hallelujah amen this gift is going to Outlast the world Amen like the worlds fold up and they change everything but this gift will not change it'll be the same today tomorrow everything the same today yesterday forever it's Eternal gift it's an unchanging gift it remaineth the same Hallelujah that's what I like is something you can count on oh I like that but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make the enemies thy foot stol see he's trying to establish now that this is not just a spirit being he's now going to talk to us and show what he made this gift and why this gift is so valuable to you it's the maker of heaven and Earth it's everything else that he said but now it's got a particular identification with you it's got your name on it so it's got the ability not to be just everybody's gift but my gift tailored for me not just not just anybody's gift not this thing but but something that I is is beautiful and they are not and are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation now listen as we just go this last chapter this second chapter is wonderful therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip so remember what he spoke to us in times past and what did he speak to us of he spoke to us of eternal life the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus amen for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast fast and every transgression and disobedient receive the just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect such a great gift because the gift of God is what salvation Salvation from what certain destruction and death he says he says so how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him so who he when he came this gift he started talking about what that he was bringing he was bringing eternal life amen he was bringing salvation he he was bringing something so the gift came and spoke of what that it was that the father was giving us and yet do we neglect such a great salvation and and we do neglect it in a way that we don't realize and we'll get to that quickly and then we'll take care of some other business it said it says uh God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his own will so God bore witness of this gift its power its ability what it accomplishes the things it does and even the gift of the Holy Spirit Bears witness of this first gift in other words it's God saying I can give you anything better I gave you the best I gave you myself I gave you my son he's the he created the worlds he he has everything is subject to him just listen as he describes this gift I I I hope that you enjoy this it's wonderful to me he says For unto the Angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak the Angels aren't subject to the world to come but he is that the world's subject to him but one in it certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou shalt visit him oh you you see the gift what is man that you're even mindful of him son of man that should even visit him and yet God's saying this is the gift my son I'm mindful of you I'm visiting you I'm speaking to you of eternal life I'm speaking to you of Salvation it it's beautiful thou mest him but now listen to this beautiful gift but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visited him thou mest him a little lower than the Angels now now he's starting to show that this gift identifies with us that's right how intimate this gift is how well planned this gift was he made his him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him and left nothing that is not put under him nothing this gift you have everything is subject to the gift you have there's nothing that is not subject to him so now you can begin to see the power of the gift that you have he because but now we see not yet all things things put under him we don't even seen all the things those guys never seen what had to be put under his feet in this day they said we haven't seen everything that's put under his feet but we know they're all put under his feet why so that means when we come in this scientific education civilization tricky technological lion stinking Spirit-filled demon age it's still subject hallelujah hallelujah it don't matter this is the age he's going to appear as an angel of Light he's still subject all powers all principalities everything subject to him there's nothing that's not subject to him even though we haven't seen it yet it's still subject to him but we see Jesus Hallelujah who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death amen crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man yes sir oh your gift has tasted death so you don't have to he he tasted death listen to this as this unfolds it it's it's just beautiful it it's just beautiful for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom all by whom are all things so it it became him for whom are all things so all things are for him and by whom are all things so all the things that are by him and he did this in bringing many sons unto glory amen that's why he became lower in the Angels that's why he tested death that's why he's everything subject to him so he could bring what sons and when when he say Sons that's Sons and Daughters unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren oh my all this gift all this Glory all this Majesty all that he is now this gift comes and says I'm not ashamed to call you my brothers Amen in other words I'm one of you even though I'm all these other things even though I created heavens and earth I came down and tested death for you even though I everything's subject to me I'm not going to make you less than myself I'm going to call you brother and friend saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God hath given me for so as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that hath power of death that is the devil Hallelujah the devil's destroyed he don't know it but he's destroyed amen praise God that's why he come to call you Brethren and by by the reason that through death he might destroy him that hath the power of death Satan has the power of death he's the Destroyer he's the killer but the gift of God is eternal life amen that's what you get eternal life that's what he brought that's the gift of God and delivered them who through fear of death were all their lifetime so subject to bondage man all their lifetime was afraid to what to die let me tell you when you've got this gift you are not afraid to die because you don't die you don't die when you got this gift you don't die he destroyed the power of death that's the devil I like talking about Jesus for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham he became one of us wherefor in all things it behooved him to be made liken unto his Brethren it behooved him to be making liken unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things P pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people what a gift what a nature what his purpose was to come and make reconciliation for our sins and give us life and as we begin to close here he says to make a high priest in all things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now this is the verse that I wanted to preach right here for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted and I think that's the hardest part that we go through in life is just being tempted but listen what he says and and hath suffered being tempted he is able to secure the them that are tempted and and S you know what that is let me let me read that with the definition and and it it says for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to assist and support in times of hardship ship and distress to them that are tempted that's this gift and it's just such a wonderful beautiful gift and I I just wanted to talk about it a little tonight because this was the first gift it was it was the a glorious that just to describe it we don't have words I thought Paul just trying to present him to the Hebrews this great gift of God and when it finally comes down to us he didn't come as an angel he didn't come as a king he came as a brother to be tempted like we were tempted so he could assist and support in the times of hardship and distress and in Temptation he's there you talk about a gift that's not used you talk about all the Temptations that we try to fight ourselves all the uncertainty that we go through and yet this gift became a brother yes and was tempted like we were so we could have a spiritual remote start to start our life up again to assist us in overcoming to help us in distress yeah and in times of hardship that's why he's an everlasting gift Heaven and Earth will pass away but he says I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end what a wonderful beautiful gift tonight we're going to turn the service back over to brother Billy as uh he'll lead us in worship and we're going to have a baptism so anybody that like to stay uh for the baptism uh surely like to uh welcome our candidate to uh for baptism to come why

heart to the Lord and and serve God and and I I I know she knows that the gift of God is the holy spirit which is life and and she just desires that that life and and that gift that comes from baptism ISM that she washes away her sins it's if you could say it The Bard chalkboard of her life is white clean and now the spirit of God comes and helps her build a new nature a new personality put work gifts and grow in the Statue of a perfect man and this is the starting place of every real Christian Life is with repentance and with the pool and as we got received from our study this evening that we needed that gift because without it we can do nothing but with him all things are possible in Christ Jesus so let us read our scriptures found in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost where the disciples hearing the gospel that Jesus preached about the oncoming Kingdom they went in the upper room and they were filled with the spirit they came out on the street prophesying and people heard them in their tongues and their own languages and they were pricked in their heart and this is what it says and therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosten for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this up towards generation and that's what our sister is doing today amen turn in the scriptures Jesus spoke and he said go into all the world baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit one name and Peter with the keys to the kingdom and a divine revelation of what that name was they baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so according to the promise of God and the commission given to the church we baptize you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] amen let's stand and sing let's sing Jesus Messiah is all this Miss song oh he became SI but knew not sing that we might become his
