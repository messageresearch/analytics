[45:44] blessing I was wondering what am I going
[45:47] to
[45:48] [Music]
[45:51] say I T about the brother a brother of
[45:55] color that brother bam talks
[45:59] about talks about it in Israel and the
[46:02] church there was said there was a
[46:04] brother a colge
[46:06] brother who always had his
[46:09] Bible and he always had his Bible with
[46:11] him all the
[46:14] time and somebody asked him why do you
[46:16] always carry your Bible that
[46:20] way he said it's because I believe it
[46:22] with all my
[46:24] heart
[46:27] they told him why you can't read it how
[46:29] do you say you believe the
[46:32] Bible he said I believe it from cover to
[46:38] cover he said how do you believe it if
[46:41] you can't
[46:43] read he said on the cover it's written
[46:46] Holy
[46:48] Bible and that's why I believe it from
[46:52] cover to
[46:53] cover and as I was thinking about
[46:56] that something came on my
[46:59] heart that I'm going to
[47:01] title only
[47:04] believe only
[47:09] believe we know that in
[47:14] life sometimes we believe
[47:20] things because we live in the maybe we
[47:23] live in a dimension where those things
[47:25] are visible
[47:29] today if they say brother
[47:31] Paul I'm going to say I'm going to
[47:34] answer
[47:38] why because my father my caral father
[47:41] who in the
[47:43] flesh he made me believe since my birth
[47:46] that your name is Paul that when they
[47:49] say Paul it's
[47:51] you and I believe
[47:54] it and every time they say
[47:57] Paul I'm going to say it's
[48:00] me because they made me believe
[48:06] that by my Earthly
[48:13] father and we believe easily those
[48:16] things which are taught by us in the
[48:20] natural we believe it more than what our
[48:23] heavenly father tells us
[48:27] we know that our heavenly
[48:29] father from this the the the
[48:32] word he told
[48:34] us that every time they say Christian
[48:38] it's
[48:40] you but many many times in this
[48:44] world the the devil and his
[48:50] unbelief the devil wants to make you
[48:52] believe that when they say Christian
[48:54] it's not you
[48:58] because every time when you
[49:01] fail but when they say Paul it's it's
[49:04] always
[49:05] you but when they say
[49:09] Christian The Devil Makes you believe
[49:12] that you are not
[49:14] Christian as where your heavenly father
[49:18] has told you that you are a
[49:24] Christian he wants you to be a
[49:29] Christian that you he wants you to be in
[49:32] His
[49:33] image the
[49:35] problem as brother tells
[49:38] us that there's seven
[49:43] dimensions that we are living in a
[49:46] dimension of material or
[49:49] matter of light of
[49:54] time
[49:56] and we have the five senses to be in
[49:58] contact with those
[50:02] things with those five senses we we
[50:05] believe
[50:06] easily because we see because we
[50:11] hear because we
[50:14] touch because we we
[50:19] taste and if it's that way we believe
[50:22] that
[50:24] easily
[50:26] as we heard it on
[50:29] Wednesday if we go back a 100 years
[50:33] ago and somebody told
[50:36] us that as we are right
[50:40] now I am we are I'm
[50:44] able to see
[50:48] here what my brother is doing in
[50:53] brazille we would say that's not true
[50:56] and it's not
[50:58] possible because our five
[51:02] senses it doesn't allow us to to gain
[51:05] access to that
[51:09] Dimension and to know at this
[51:12] instant what's
[51:14] happening somewhere else in the
[51:17] world but
[51:20] today
[51:22] science uh the children children of
[51:26] Kane they have brought
[51:29] us cell phones intelligent
[51:32] phone the Android
[51:35] phone and I can have my WhatsApp
[51:39] video and I put a
[51:42] number I get access to the fourth
[51:46] dimension I'm I'm not going to
[51:51] brazaville but I'm able to see what's
[51:53] happening in brazaville right right here
[51:56] now
[51:59] why because something has given me
[52:02] access to that fourth
[52:06] dimension and as my eyes have seen
[52:12] it and so it's like that fourth
[52:15] dimension has been brought into our
[52:19] Dimension and that my my my Earthly body
[52:22] my carnal body believes that easily
[52:27] but we
[52:30] know that is also a dimension of
[52:36] God that that Dimension is not far away
[52:39] from
[52:41] us Braille is not far away from
[52:45] us the
[52:49] problem that God has to give us the
[52:53] ability to also access that
[52:57] Dimension but the son of
[53:01] Cain they cannot give us access to that
[53:06] dimension in contrary everything that
[53:09] they will
[53:11] create is to try to distract
[53:16] us is to try to keep us away from this
[53:19] other
[53:21] dimension where we can access the things
[53:24] of God
[53:26] and to bring back the things of
[53:29] God to the dimension that we are living
[53:32] in that's why the Bible says that
[53:37] Faith it's it's an assurance a firm
[53:40] Assurance of things that we hope
[53:45] for an Evidence of things that we not
[53:51] seen it's it's the things that the five
[53:55] the five senses cannot help us
[53:58] access but God has to give us a six
[54:02] sense he has to give us
[54:06] Faith so we can access that
[54:11] Dimension and to bring in
[54:16] existence the things that the world
[54:18] think is
[54:24] impossible
[54:28] if we thought that uh communicating and
[54:31] seeing someone was
[54:35] impossible and now we see that it's
[54:38] possible as
[54:42] Christians we have so much
[54:46] evidence to believe that God is
[54:50] real if we can only access in that other
[54:54] dimension
[54:57] nothing will be
[55:02] impossible look at the Prophet Elijah
[55:07] elishah he was he was all surrounded by
[55:10] by
[55:13] serans and his his servant GAA began to
[55:17] uh he was
[55:19] afraid oh
[55:21] Master what are we going to
[55:24] do look at how we are
[55:27] surrounded we are without
[55:30] hope there's so many of
[55:32] them they are all with
[55:36] weapons that there's no way we're going
[55:38] to get out of
[55:40] this but
[55:43] Elijah he was in contact with the
[55:45] dimension of
[55:47] God Elijah
[55:50] knew that the one who was in
[55:54] him greater than he that was in the
[55:56] world Elisha
[55:59] knew that those that were with
[56:04] them was more than those of the
[56:07] syrians
[56:10] but he was
[56:13] shaking because he didn't have access to
[56:18] that Elijah pray oh father he said open
[56:23] his
[56:23] eyes my prayer
[56:27] tonight that God may open our
[56:31] eyes that we may get access to that
[56:33] dimension of
[56:36] God that we may possess everything that
[56:39] he's given
[56:41] us God opened the eyes of
[56:44] G and when GZA
[56:47] saw all around
[56:49] them there were millions of millions of
[56:53] angels
[56:57] the attitude of G
[56:59] changed G who was
[57:03] trembling today if the enemy is making
[57:05] you
[57:06] fear I'm going to pray like Elijah
[57:10] pray that the Lord may open your
[57:13] eyes that you may
[57:16] realize that the master of
[57:19] impossibility he's on your
[57:23] side
[57:25] often time we
[57:27] conform we we get used
[57:30] to because the world is getting us uh to
[57:36] conform I go to church it's that's
[57:41] enough every time I go to church I'm a
[57:45] Christian it's
[57:48] enough and isah
[57:53] was but when says Isaiah was a good
[57:57] boy and he he had he
[58:01] admired the king
[58:04] OAS and the King also liked
[58:09] him but one day the king oiah made a
[58:13] mistake God uh uh corrected
[58:18] him asah who was just a brother who was
[58:21] coming to
[58:22] church he understood
[58:26] that that was not
[58:27] enough he went in the
[58:31] temple he started
[58:33] confessing he said oh
[58:36] Lord I'm just a man with unclean
[58:40] lips I live with the people with unclean
[58:44] lips he was so sincere in his
[58:50] prayer that God took him into that
[58:53] dimension
[58:56] he found himself in the presence of
[58:59] God he saw God sitting on his
[59:03] throne with the angels that were
[59:07] shouting holy holy holy is the
[59:13] Lord when Isaiah came across that
[59:18] experience he was never the
[59:23] same he was no longer the same brother
[59:26] who was just happy coming to
[59:34] church when God said who shall go for us
[59:38] he was
[59:39] ready he said here I am send
[59:45] me because he left the dimension of five
[59:50] senses to get into this
[59:53] dimension
[59:55] where he was going to
[59:57] believe only
[59:59] believe only
[1:00:04] believe all the
[1:00:07] promises that God made in the
[1:00:10] Bible belongs to
[1:00:13] us there's no
[1:00:16] exception there's no
[1:00:20] exclusion often time it's the devil
[1:00:22] who's trying to exclude you
[1:00:25] but God is telling
[1:00:27] you that all the
[1:00:30] promises from cover to cover belongs to
[1:00:41] you as true as you can believe a word
[1:00:44] that Immortals tell
[1:00:46] you I want you
[1:00:48] tonight that God help
[1:00:51] me that I may believe everything that
[1:00:54] God said
[1:00:55] has everything belongs to
[1:00:58] me that the
[1:01:03] impossible that the what that which is
[1:01:05] impossible does not belong to
[1:01:08] God
[1:01:10] but if we believe nothing is impossible
[1:01:13] to
[1:01:14] God we also have to
[1:01:17] believe that nothing is impossible to
[1:01:23] us yes
[1:01:26] sir and we have to
[1:01:29] fight we have to go
[1:01:33] forward to to gain access to every
[1:01:37] promise like the children of
[1:01:40] Israel God promised them the gave them a
[1:01:43] promise of the promis land but when they
[1:01:45] got
[1:01:47] there they have to fight for every inch
[1:01:50] of
[1:01:51] it and God wants us to persevere
[1:01:59] and to see that everyone in the Bible
[1:02:01] who obtains
[1:02:03] something they were perseverant in what
[1:02:06] they were
[1:02:07] finding the devil can put all kinds of
[1:02:11] obstacles but God wants us to
[1:02:14] persevere that we continue to
[1:02:18] fight
[1:02:20] says in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:02:26] paragraph
[1:02:29] 425 he said all
[1:02:32] right I open my I open my heart and my
[1:02:36] mind come in Lord

[1:03:10] enemy if an old spooky
[1:03:17] Spirit making you feel all cut it cut

[1:03:22] away with the word of the Lord
[1:03:28] by but our strength is the joy of the
[1:03:31] Lord is our
[1:03:33] strength if there's something bothering
[1:03:38] you but the say get away from
[1:03:43] me cut it away with the
[1:03:47] word that it may be a
[1:03:49] demon whether it be an
[1:03:52] enemy whether it be a sickness
[1:03:56] whether it be a
[1:03:57] disease whatever it
[1:04:00] is take that
[1:04:03] word pull it out with a sword with a
[1:04:09] sword and if you work it the first
[1:04:12] time and you don't seem to move work it
[1:04:16] again and work it again and walk it
[1:04:21] again and walk it again
[1:04:27] and work it until you chip it you chip a
[1:04:30] hole through
[1:04:32] it like a little chicken
[1:04:36] peeping it ping itself out or an eagle
[1:04:40] what you

[1:05:10] one where's the next
[1:05:13] one I already uh uh overcame the
[1:05:18] first I I whack it so many times so that
[1:05:22] I can get rid of it but where's the next
[1:05:28] one that's the
[1:05:30] battle that's a
[1:05:33] soldier that's a soldier of the Cross
[1:05:36] yes
[1:05:38] sir knock every enemy
[1:05:41] out and an enemy for a
[1:05:45] Christian it's all
[1:05:50] unbelief anything that brings you to
[1:05:53] doubt the word of God
[1:05:55] you got to whack
[1:05:57] it if the first whacking is not enough
[1:06:01] whack it again for
[1:06:03] the until you get rid of that
[1:06:08] unbelief and you find yourself in the
[1:06:11] presence of
[1:06:14] God to believe that everything that God
[1:06:17] said will bring will come to
[1:06:21] pass and that your situation is not
[1:06:30] impossible if it's
[1:06:33] disease when we take the
[1:06:36] Bible oh I like that old colored
[1:06:40] man because from cover to
[1:06:45] cover we have promises for everything
[1:06:49] concerning
[1:06:52] us for every situation that we
[1:06:55] have there's a
[1:06:58] promise if you are
[1:07:00] sick you say you take Psalm
[1:07:04] 103 it said I am your
[1:07:07] God who forgiveth
[1:07:10] you of all your
[1:07:13] iniquities and who
[1:07:16] health of all thy
[1:07:21] diseases he didn't say I'm able to heal
[1:07:25] disease but for other
[1:07:27] diseases I'm not able
[1:07:30] to he said I am your
[1:07:34] God who forgive of all thy
[1:07:37] iniquity and who health of you of all
[1:07:40] that
[1:07:42] diseases you take Isaiah
[1:07:45] 53 he was he was wounded for our
[1:07:49] transgression and it's by his stripes
[1:07:52] that we are healed
[1:07:57] so many times the trouble tried to
[1:07:59] disturb
[1:08:03] us uh this this afternoon before coming
[1:08:05] to
[1:08:07] church I had a a a really terrible
[1:08:11] headache I told my wife I have a
[1:08:15] headache I I I took the uh the blood
[1:08:19] pressure and I was measuring my blood
[1:08:21] pressure it was really high
[1:08:25] 16 and 11
[1:08:29] 161 I told my
[1:08:32] wife they said this is the proof of my
[1:08:37] healing because when the devil is
[1:08:39] fighting like this it
[1:08:42] means he knows that God is doing
[1:08:46] something because in
[1:08:52] 2015
[1:08:56] I was diagnosed with chronic kidney
[1:08:58] disease uh I was diagnosed with a
[1:09:01] chronic uh kidney
[1:09:06] disease and uh in
[1:09:08] 200 19 19 I had a biopsy for the uh uh
[1:09:20] kidneys and 2022 when my wife was sick
[1:09:23] my situation got a little
[1:09:26] worse and for
[1:09:28] medicine I am a
[1:09:31] doctor so when we open the book of uh of
[1:09:35] medicine it
[1:09:38] says that the insufficient uh uh uh
[1:09:43] chronic that it's not a heal a disease
[1:09:46] that can be
[1:09:48] healed it's it's it could you could
[1:09:51] stabilize it or it gets
[1:09:55] worse but when I open this
[1:09:58] book my true heavenly father told me
[1:10:02] it's by my
[1:10:05] stripes that you were
[1:10:07] healed he says I am your
[1:10:11] lord who forgive all th
[1:10:14] iniquity and who Health all of all th
[1:10:19] diseases I told the
[1:10:21] doctors the true book
[1:10:24] told
[1:10:26] me and I'm going to bring you the
[1:10:29] testimony that God healed
[1:10:32] me and I'm going to do like John
[1:10:35] Ryan I'm going to start
[1:10:37] testifying that glory to God I am
[1:10:44] healed and I know that my
[1:10:48] confession will bring this Earthly
[1:10:52] body to obey to that
[1:10:55] confession to believe that my God is
[1:10:58] alive that is able to heal every
[1:11:02] disease that the enemy has no
[1:11:04] right that the enemy has no
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:10] power I was telling my wife I was
[1:11:13] healed because in 2022 when it got
[1:11:17] worse the the blood pressure was so
[1:11:22] high there was about four different
[1:11:25] medication for blood pressure that I was
[1:11:27] taking to
[1:11:30] help and sometimes in the a night after
[1:11:33] I finished the uh uh the
[1:11:37] supper uh my my daughters they were even
[1:11:40] uh
[1:11:41] moving oh they were fighting to go get
[1:11:43] my medicine for me because they know
[1:11:46] that I had to take the
[1:11:47] medicine but I believe but God healed
[1:11:52] me he healed
[1:11:57] me
[1:12:00] says
[1:12:03] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:12:10] Lord he didn't heal me because I wanted
[1:12:13] it because it's
[1:12:16] him it's him that did
[1:12:19] it he didn't even ask for my
[1:12:22] permission
[1:12:26] to say that I give my life so you can be
[1:12:31] healed all that I had to do only believe
[1:12:34] is to just believe
[1:12:36] it only believe only
[1:12:41] believe and that same
[1:12:46] God he not just there to heal our
[1:12:50] flesh because he can heal us today and
[1:12:53] tomorrow we're going to
[1:12:55] die but what does he want from
[1:12:58] us we heard it this
[1:13:01] morning to bring us to
[1:13:06] Perfection to bring me to bring us to
[1:13:09] something
[1:13:12] greater to believe that we are
[1:13:16] called to something that is
[1:13:20] perfect brother says
[1:13:24] in Hebrews 5 and 6 uh first part
[1:13:28] paragraph
[1:13:30] 104 he said Paul
[1:13:34] said let us lay aside those things
[1:13:38] now it said that's that's all
[1:13:42] right but we'll do this we'll baptize
[1:13:46] the
[1:13:47] people we lay hands on them for the
[1:13:50] healing and so
[1:13:52] forth
[1:13:55] we could take it verse by
[1:13:57] verse and each one of those things
[1:14:01] baptism we believe
[1:14:06] it there's one hope there's one Lord
[1:14:09] there's one Faith there's one
[1:14:11] baptism we believe all the we believe
[1:14:14] there those things we believe there's
[1:14:16] one
[1:14:18] baptism we believe in the resurrection
[1:14:21] of the Dead
[1:14:25] absolutely we believe that Jesus died
[1:14:27] and rose again we believe
[1:14:31] that laying on the hands for the
[1:14:34] sick that's what it
[1:14:38] says these son shall follow them that
[1:14:42] believe if we lay hands on the
[1:14:45] sick they shall recover we believe that
[1:14:50] but but what he said Paul said
[1:14:54] Paul
[1:14:55] said it's all dead
[1:15:00] works that's something that you
[1:15:04] do now let's go on to
[1:15:08] Perfection oh
[1:15:10] my we are coming into the
[1:15:13] Tabernacle not the
[1:15:16] foundation the foundation is everything
[1:15:18] we believe it's
[1:15:20] important it's the foundation
[1:15:24] we are entering we are coming into the
[1:15:27] Tabernacle the Tabernacle
[1:15:30] itself that's the foundation the law and
[1:15:34] the
[1:15:35] righteousness joining church and being
[1:15:39] baptized laying on
[1:15:42] hands it says them is all orders of the
[1:15:48] church but now let's go let's go into
[1:15:52] perfection
[1:15:55] there's only one that is
[1:15:59] perfected how do we get into
[1:16:02] him through the Methodist no
[1:16:06] no Pentecostal no
[1:16:09] no to baptist no
[1:16:15] no through any church no no the Catholic
[1:16:19] Roman Roman Catholic no no
[1:16:27] before we go on I was thinking about
[1:16:29] something let's open our Bibles in
[1:16:30] Hebrews
[1:16:32] 10 Hebrews chapter
[1:16:52] 10
[1:16:59] Hebrews 10
[1:17:01] verse4 the Bible
[1:17:13] says for one for by one offering he had
[1:17:17] perfected he had perfected for every
[1:17:21] them that are San
[1:17:29] IFI wherefore the Holy Ghost also is
[1:17:33] witness to us for after he had said
[1:17:39] before this is the Covenant that I will
[1:17:42] make with them it's him that's saying
[1:17:47] it this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:17:50] with with them
[1:17:55] that after those days say the
[1:18:00] Lord I will put my laws into their
[1:18:07] hearts and in their minds will I write
[1:18:14] them and their sins and iniquity will I
[1:18:17] remember no
[1:18:18] more now this is the Lord saying it's
[1:18:22] not your
[1:18:24] effort he is
[1:18:26] saying that all that he's asking
[1:18:30] you is to believe that he's talking
[1:18:33] about
[1:18:36] you that it's not about somebody else to
[1:18:39] somebody else but it's you that he's
[1:18:42] talking
[1:18:44] about so the Covenant that he's making
[1:18:47] with
[1:18:49] you that he himself will put his law
[1:18:53] into your
[1:18:55] heart that he will that he will he said
[1:18:58] that in the mind I will write
[1:19:03] them and their sins their sins and
[1:19:06] iniquity I will remember no
[1:19:15] more now where where remission of these
[1:19:19] is there there's no more offering for
[1:19:21] sin and see
[1:19:29] having therefore Brethren so I want
[1:19:32] where it says having therefore Brethren
[1:19:34] that everyone puts their own
[1:19:36] name and see them and then I'll say
[1:19:39] therefore
[1:19:50] Paul it says we boldness to enter into
[1:19:54] the holiest by the blood of
[1:20:00] Jesus by a New and Living
[1:20:05] [Music]
[1:20:06] Way he consecrated for us through the
[1:20:11] veil that is to say his
[1:20:14] flesh and we know that his
[1:20:17] flesh John 1 tells us that it's the
[1:20:21] word
[1:20:23] that he consecrated a way for
[1:20:27] us through his
[1:20:30] word that he wants us to
[1:20:34] believe that this this this new
[1:20:36] consecrated way was created for
[1:20:39] you that this Blood the lamb is for
[1:20:47] me and having an high priest over the
[1:20:50] house of
[1:20:51] God
[1:20:54] let us draw near with a true
[1:20:57] heart as Isaiah did
[1:21:01] it in fullness and Assurance of Faith
[1:21:04] only only
[1:21:08] believe and our heart sprinkled with
[1:21:11] with an evil
[1:21:14] conscience and our body washed with pure
[1:21:21] water let hold fast to the profession of
[1:21:24] our
[1:21:26] faith because the one who made the
[1:21:29] promise he's
[1:21:32] faithful the one who made the promise
[1:21:35] he's
[1:21:37] faithful he said that he
[1:21:40] himself will establish a covenant with
[1:21:44] you that he may not remember no your sin
[1:21:47] no longer that that your
[1:21:51] iniquity that by his
[1:21:54] word that he has concentrated a new way
[1:21:57] for
[1:21:59] you so you can come to
[1:22:02] Perfection says paragraph
[1:22:07] 109 it said how do we get in into it
[1:22:12] Romans 8 and9 8
[1:22:17] And1 there's therefore now no
[1:22:20] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:22:23] how do we get
[1:22:25] in there is now no
[1:22:28] condemnation for those that are in
[1:22:33] Christ th not walk not after the things
[1:22:36] of the World the
[1:22:39] Flesh but after the things of the
[1:22:44] spirit that pay no attention to what the
[1:22:47] world has got to
[1:22:50] say even if you are sick
[1:22:53] the doctor say you're going to
[1:22:56] die pay no attention to
[1:22:59] it it it don't bother you a bit if
[1:23:03] they'll tell
[1:23:04] you you have to
[1:23:07] become you have to become a Catholic to
[1:23:09] be saved or a
[1:23:11] presbyterian or have to do
[1:23:14] this you pay no attention to
[1:23:20] it no condemnation to to them that are
[1:23:23] in Christ Jesus why because he made the
[1:23:28] Covenant to forgive all your
[1:23:31] iniquity and all your
[1:23:36] sins he says who wal not after the
[1:23:39] flesh the things that they
[1:23:43] see they no longer walk after the things
[1:23:46] that they
[1:23:49] see everything that you see with your
[1:23:51] eyes is
[1:23:55] Earthly but the things that you see in
[1:23:58] your
[1:23:59] spirit through the
[1:24:02] word the the word is God's looking M
[1:24:08] Glass that reflect what he is and what
[1:24:12] you are hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:24:16] my it tells
[1:24:21] you this is the only book in the
[1:24:25] world that tells you where you come from
[1:24:29] who you are and where you
[1:24:34] going show me a page of Lit Literature
[1:24:42] anywhere with all the science and
[1:24:45] anything
[1:24:47] else any good book that's been
[1:24:51] written
[1:24:53] none of them can tell you
[1:24:55] that this is God Looking
[1:25:01] Glass that shows you what he is and what
[1:25:04] you
[1:25:05] are so if you want to know what you
[1:25:09] are don't listen to what your neighbor
[1:25:12] is telling
[1:25:14] you don't tell you what your friend is
[1:25:16] telling don't listen to what your friend
[1:25:18] is telling you don't tell don't listen
[1:25:20] to what your parents are telling you
[1:25:23] if it's contrary to the
[1:25:27] word but what is telling you what you
[1:25:29] should
[1:25:30] be it's the word of
[1:25:34] God and this word of God
[1:25:38] says you have to go towards the
[1:25:42] Perfection and we have to believe it
[1:25:44] with all our
[1:25:47] heart
[1:25:49] says I'm going to skip a little bit
[1:25:55] paragraph
[1:26:12] 114 it says that's the thing that I have
[1:26:14] done a minister baptize you whether he
[1:26:17] baptized you you face forward or
[1:26:20] backwards and and and three times times
[1:26:22] four times or one thing or he says oh
[1:26:26] how he did it it has nothing to do with
[1:26:31] it you are baptized to enter into the
[1:26:34] Fellowship of the of that
[1:26:36] church
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:43] anyhow proving to that church that you
[1:26:46] believe in the death burial and
[1:26:47] resurrection of
[1:26:50] Christ laying on on hands the uh uh to
[1:26:54] heal the sick that's
[1:26:57] wonderful but that's all
[1:27:02] natural and that body will die
[1:27:06] again just as certain as you are
[1:27:10] alive he will die
[1:27:13] again now let's lay aside all those
[1:27:17] things go into
[1:27:21] perfection we get into
[1:27:23] Perfection that's what we want to
[1:27:26] know Christ has
[1:27:29] perfected we heard it this
[1:27:36] morning God laid upon him the iniquity
[1:27:39] of us
[1:27:41] all he was wounded for our
[1:27:45] transgressions Bru for our
[1:27:50] iniquity the
[1:27:52] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:27:57] him and with his stripes we were
[1:28:02] healed that's the body we want to get
[1:28:06] into that's the body
[1:28:10] why if you are in that
[1:28:13] body you will never see
[1:28:17] judgment you will never taste of death
[1:28:23] you are free from all death
[1:28:27] judgment
[1:28:29] sin anything
[1:28:31] else when you are in that
[1:28:35] body when you are in the body of
[1:28:39] Christ when you receive the baptism of
[1:28:42] the Holy
[1:28:43] Ghost when Christ
[1:28:45] himself comes and dwells inside of your
[1:28:51] heart you are free from all
[1:28:54] sins you are free from all the death of
[1:29:00] judgment how do we get in into it

[1:29:43] body to form one
[1:29:50] body
[1:29:56] by the by the Holy Holy Spirit baptism
[1:30:00] we are baptized into the body and are
[1:30:02] free from
[1:30:04] sin that's what we heard this morning
[1:30:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new
[1:30:12] birth that the person of Christ in our
[1:30:17] lives is the only is the thing that
[1:30:19] brings us into that perfection
[1:30:23] he said God can't see
[1:30:27] us he he says he can't see as he only
[1:30:30] sees
[1:30:32] Christ and when you are in that
[1:30:36] body God can judge that
[1:30:39] body he's already judged
[1:30:43] it he took our
[1:30:46] judgment and invited us
[1:30:49] in just a simple invit
[1:30:53] it says it's by faith just
[1:30:57] believe only
[1:31:00] believe that body was already
[1:31:06] judged and he says that all of us we
[1:31:09] have the right to access that
[1:31:13] body we said we have a promise for
[1:31:16] everything that
[1:31:20] happens oh can I receive the Holy
[1:31:23] Ghost he
[1:31:25] says that promise is for you for your
[1:31:31] children and all those that are far
[1:31:34] off and as many as our Lord God shall
[1:31:41] call it means that promise is for
[1:31:46] you but you can only receive it when you
[1:31:50] believe
[1:31:52] that if you want to receive
[1:31:54] it that if you come closer to receive
[1:31:58] it he
[1:32:01] says he's already judged
[1:32:04] them he he took our
[1:32:07] judgment and invited us
[1:32:10] in and by
[1:32:12] faith through
[1:32:14] Grace not even our own effort not even
[1:32:18] our own
[1:32:19] emotion it's not our movement it's by
[1:32:22] his
[1:32:24] grace by by
[1:32:28] faith that we
[1:32:30] walk and accept our
[1:32:35] pardoning and the Holy Ghost brings us
[1:32:38] into that into this fellowship with
[1:32:42] him and we walk no more after the things
[1:32:45] of the
[1:32:47] world but we walk in the
[1:32:50] spirit quick
[1:32:53] awakened the word come to

[1:34:11] long to be that
[1:34:14] way not not
[1:34:17] tattling or
[1:34:20] backbiting or sing about the
[1:34:23] churches you get
[1:34:27] it the same
[1:34:29] way as we read in
[1:34:33] Genesis that the the world was form
[1:34:37] without form and
[1:34:39] void and there was
[1:34:42] Darkness upon the face of the Earth the
[1:34:46] word of
[1:34:47] God
[1:34:49] said let there be light
[1:34:52] and there was
[1:34:53] light if my
[1:34:55] life is without form and
[1:34:58] void filled with
[1:35:02] Darkness the same word that was
[1:35:04] pronounced in
[1:35:06] Genesis that the same word
[1:35:09] tonight that is capable of telling my
[1:35:12] life let there be
[1:35:17] light and
[1:35:20] certainly light was show showed up in
[1:35:23] the
[1:35:24] Genesis that the light will be for will
[1:35:27] come forth in my
[1:35:30] life that I may be like
[1:35:34] Christ that I may go towards
[1:35:39] Perfection
[1:35:41] says I'm going I'm about to
[1:35:46] close in the patmas
[1:35:49] vision paragraph
[1:35:55] 250 he
[1:35:57] says there he stands the mighty
[1:36:02] conqueror since he rent the veil in two
[1:36:06] there he
[1:36:10] is he has he has the key of both death
[1:36:14] hell and the and and hanging on my
[1:36:17] side he said fear
[1:36:20] not
[1:36:21] laid his right hand his power upon
[1:36:26] him on John he's talking about
[1:36:32] John and raised them up by the power of
[1:36:35] His right hand he said don't
[1:36:41] fear he's doing the same thing with each
[1:36:44] and every one of
[1:36:45] us in the place of John he said fear
[1:36:50] not
[1:36:51] it says I am he that
[1:36:54] was I him that
[1:36:57] is and that shall
[1:37:00] come I'm the first and the
[1:37:04] last I am he that
[1:37:06] liveth and
[1:37:09] died and is alive again forever more
[1:37:13] amen amen
[1:37:17] oh Behold The Mighty
[1:37:20] conqueror so Behold Him in plain
[1:37:24] view there he stands the mighty
[1:37:28] conqueror since he rent the veil in
[1:37:34] two cut every obstacle from the human
[1:37:41] being he cut all obstacles for human
[1:37:45] being there are no more
[1:37:49] obstacles for us to go to
[1:37:53] him because Jesus removed all the
[1:37:57] obstacles to open to us the
[1:38:03] way that he may be that he might be
[1:38:06] connected like in the Garden of
[1:38:10] Eden it says I'm going to choke up but
[1:38:14] I'm going to say
[1:38:17] it man is omnipotent
[1:38:24] you don't believe that but he
[1:38:29] is a man fully surrendered to God is
[1:38:39] omnipotent when God said man is more
[1:38:43] powerful it's like
[1:38:47] Jesus it's not like he's running around
[1:38:50] oh you'll see what I'll
[1:38:55] do Jesus who had all
[1:38:58] power he was he was veiled in
[1:39:04] humility and even when he was
[1:39:06] healing he didn't say I did it he said
[1:39:10] your faith your faith your faith healed
[1:39:15] you oh I never seen such great
[1:39:20] faith he didn't say I
[1:39:25] did and that's all
[1:39:28] powerful that's where God wants us to
[1:39:34] be he said man is
[1:39:40] omnipotent a man fully surrendered to
[1:39:43] God is
[1:39:45] omnipotent did he not say in Mark 11
[1:39:50] and22
[1:39:53] what whatsoever things you say and doubt
[1:39:56] not in your
[1:39:59] heart it'll come to
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:05] pass it will come to
[1:40:11] pass not because I said
[1:40:13] it we read in
[1:40:16] Hebrews but the one who made the promise
[1:40:19] is faithful
[1:40:22] amen if he said
[1:40:24] it my part only is only to believe only
[1:40:28] only
[1:40:30] believe if he doesn't do it today I'll
[1:40:33] believe that tomorrow if he doesn't do
[1:40:35] it tomorrow I'll believe it after again
[1:40:38] if it do the day after I will believe
[1:40:42] until it comes to
[1:40:44] [Music]
[1:40:49] pass
[1:40:52] it says what happened when two
[1:40:54] omnipotent
[1:40:57] meets when God and man come
[1:41:01] together two
[1:41:03] omnipotents something's got to
[1:41:12] shake it says what whatever you'd say
[1:41:15] with that with that creative power of
[1:41:18] omnipotent of
[1:41:19] God knowing that he promised
[1:41:23] it and he said it in his
[1:41:28] word and as true as that word said let
[1:41:31] there be light and there was a
[1:41:35] light if he said it in his
[1:41:37] word it's
[1:41:40] sufficient
[1:41:42] said that this old colored man with his
[1:41:44] book they ask him a
[1:41:47] question but when you say you believe
[1:41:50] all of that
[1:41:52] book if God tells you to go through that
[1:41:55] wall what are you going to do he said
[1:41:58] I'll go
[1:42:00] through it said how are you going to go
[1:42:02] through if there's no hole it said if
[1:42:05] it's God that to tell me to go
[1:42:09] through that he himself will make a home
[1:42:12] for me to go
[1:42:16] through all that I do is to believe
[1:42:22] that that the Holy Ghost belong to
[1:42:25] me that God wants to bring up me to
[1:42:29] Perfection not a simple
[1:42:32] emotion not an
[1:42:36] agitation
[1:42:39] says when
[1:42:41] Jesus when he he went into the
[1:42:45] temple when he opened the
[1:42:48] word when he said the spirit of the Lord
[1:42:51] is upon me that he anointed
[1:42:55] me to share the good Tiding of the
[1:42:58] Lord but what I'm said he sat
[1:43:02] down and precious word that proceeded
[1:43:05] out of his
[1:43:07] mouth it said in that
[1:43:11] time the greatest
[1:43:14] anointing was was coming and dwelling
[1:43:16] upon him he was not
[1:43:19] agitated
[1:43:22] but it was the greatest
[1:43:24] anointing came and and and and and
[1:43:27] anointed him my brother my
[1:43:31] sister God is only asking
[1:43:33] us as we stand up
[1:43:36] tonight to
[1:43:38] believe to believe to only
[1:43:41] believe that every promise in the
[1:43:45] book that the promise of the Holy
[1:43:49] Ghost
[1:43:51] and often time we we we make the message
[1:43:55] complicated we complicate the
[1:44:00] word but the promise of the Holy
