and ask amen amen god bless you man so good to be gathered in the house of god amen i'm all nervous before i can even get here so i'll just pray that the lord helps us and we'll say a few words and hopefully will be a blessing to you i told brother david i was trying to get a title for what i'm going to say and then i keep changing and changing and changing i finally said it's not going to have a title amen i was going to call it something but i just decided not to amen let's open our bibles first in i'm looking at first thessalonians 4 1st thessalonians chapter 4 let's start from verse 13 it says but i will not you have i will not have you to be ignorant brother and concerning them which are asleep that ye saw or not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which are sleep in jesus will be bring will god bring them will god bring with him it says for this i say unto you by the word of the lord that which we we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the trump of god and the dead and christ shall rise first it says then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the lord in the air and shall be and shall we ever be with them with the lord it says wherefore comfort one another with these words man i just want you to realize this is the lord's doing this is what man is doing on one side and this side but this is what the lord is doing and nothing can stop it it's the law doing itself and let's also turn in first corinthian let's turn in first corinthian i believe it's uh first corinthians 13 and uh let's read from verse 1 says though i speak with thong with tongues with tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and now i have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and knowledge of and and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could move mountains and i have not charity i have i am nothing and do now i want you to realize the things that he's talking about you could do and then he says and though i bestow all goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and and and have no charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffered long and it's kind and and and is kind charity envied not charity vaunted not itself it's not puffed up do it not uh behalf itself unseen unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked and think of no evil it says rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in truth bearing all things believing all things hoping all things enduring all things charity never fail church charity never faileth but whatever there be a prophecy they shall fail whether there be a tongue they shall they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall be vanished away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with it says when i was a child i speak as a child and i understand as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things four now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall we shall i know even as i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of of these is charity that's just about head father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen and you may have your seats perhaps just you know inspired by some of the things that we said this morning i hope to say something that it will be of a blessing we we have to understand this this this message this glorious message we have received is the lord jesus christ himself coming on the scene he this is not when you read even barbara uses uh he speaks many places on this and and we can when we look at the the messages of body when we read as we read in first thessalonians it says that the lord himself shall descend and in fact many have wondered why did he not use that scripture even as a foundation for the message of the rapture but you find out in many places the the prophet is very careful to to let us know that that that the son of man revealing is jesus christ revealing himself this has nothing to do with what man is thinking of what man is trying to achieve this is god trying to bring his church together this is the culmination of what's been happening since the beginning and therefore i i was thinking about even what brother david said this morning i i it's very important we we in order to keep you focused to understand what the expectation of the manifestation at the end time is supposed to be when we say there's going to be a manifestation or the sons of god will be manifested in the end time the question you should be asking is what are they going to be doing what kind of manifestation that are going to be because if i know then i know where i'm going then i know what i'm expecting if i understand what the manifestation is then i know what i'm expecting then i can look at my life and say am i manifesting what the scripture says the son of god sons of god will do am i going in the direction that is calling forth for the manifestations of the son because i want to say this as you read throughout the church age when you read throughout the church age from the beginning to the ending a prophet shows us one thing that we need to be very mindful of as you read it says that the ages were not built in such a way that the first age come and then it goes away and then the second one comes it says no it's a building up into something it's the leaning into in fact it says that all at the end it's going to be the building off of all the evil from the beginning everything that the devil has been working on he's building it up and he's building it up and he's building up and he's building up to what we see today but we also understand what god has been working for if when he started his church in the on the day of pentecost so how that he came and his spirit move upon the people god has been building his church from justification unto sanctification not to go backwards but building them into something so therefore the manifestation of the end time is supposed to be the gathering of all those things and building it into something that god wants to see and i say this this is why it's so important because the devil can come and shine the light on something that's already passed he can come and shine a light on something that's already past and show you this is the truth and this is the truth you have to be mature enough to say this is this was the church in the past this was part of my building up this is something that i had to go through this is what god building his church and the manifestation of today is not this not that god cannot use it in this time for him to build up his people for him to do whatever he needs but the manifestation of this hour has to be known uh you know but the david mentioned something i'll just say it right away uh you know when you look at how god has been building his church from the beginning you go through justification they came and and god came and and it was the church being built up so they came in they knew that they were a sinner and then they came and they received the gospel of justification how that christ died for them they rejoiced and they moved up sanctification was added to them and how that they knew that if you were justified you had the right to walk sinless because that same word or the same god who will justify you has the ability to sanctify you to set you aside and all of that they walk and they took one more step on the day of pentecost that came and received the baptism of the holy ghost god came and he manifested himself in his people they came and they received that they moved a step up what was it it was god building his church up constantly bringing it into something that he wanted to see in the end time but when he came to the manifestation of the end time god didn't have you look to where the church has come or how that you were sanctified hollywood he came and he brought you right back into what was in his mind in the beginning so the identification of the church in the end time is not a church that came just down from sin and it was crawling up and back up and back up the identification of the church in the end time is the manifestation of what god had in his mind in the beginning when when before the fall could come in and that's why we keep constantly talking and looking and saying what was adam before the fall what was he before the fall what did we see men do what capacity did he have what ability did he have why because that's where we are being brought back into into a mature person who can look and act and manifest the attributes of god someone who's not the body of jesus christ who can come on the scene and do the same things that he did the manifestation of this hour is not just the moving of the spirit because it constantly from one message to another it's always he's taking you right back he's taking you right back where is he taking you to what his desire was because we realized god in the garden of eden he gave a prophecy he put forth his word it says that you shall be fruitful and multiply he kept telling his children you shall be fruitful and multiply and we know according to the message that that prophecy never come to pass we understand that adam came and the devil came in and all of that fall apart and and man came through sin and all those things but there had to come a time where god will take that word and bring it back to his people we're gonna come a time where we could come back and the words everything that had been fallen anything that had been shortened anything that had been because remember god has a permissive will and god has a perfect will so both the permissive and the perfect will always works out to be god's perfect will in the end time he will take the permissive will not so he can keep it as a permissive will but to take that permissive will and turn it right back into the perfect will now now let me say this now he is talking about the church he's talking about the very church and the manifestation of this tower now we're right here and and and uh paul spoken i believe it was in sec first corinthians 13 he said when i was as a child i spoke as a child and i did a childish things now again when we look at the focus of what we're looking for we can understand there is not even too long after pentecost not even too long after pentecost they already saying that oh i i we look through glass darkly we we we're trying to understand what is the end goal of this where is this going what is the very mystery that god is trying to reveal what what is the end goal of what we're trying to achieve now you know but random speaks in the message uh the the marriage and the force and i'll just pick this up so i can continue it says now he speaks about the the woman it says and so it is with a church that refuses to become pregnant in this in the in the age uh that we live now he says to bring forth a child of this age now listen to where is putting the focus to bring forth the child of this age we are not lutheran we are not westlands we are not pentecostal we've got to be the child of this age though the pregnancy of the it says through the pregnancy of the word to bring forth a child of this age the seed child amen i hope you understand it says couldn't be uh couldn't be pregnant uh couldn't be pregnanted not not so we could uh we could uh not show what we did or he he not so what did we did he do put her away it says in the force that's right but she dares to put him away he puts her away it says he went right into the right he went right on to revealing his word to his body vindicating himself same himself his children began to kind of look more like him becoming in the fully maturing oh they are becoming children of the word not children of the church children of the word well now what is the difference the church but one of them speaks even as oppressor spoke this morning there's a major difference between the church and the bride because the church is what falls within the movement of what's happening it's what falls within oh this is they doing this over here we're going to do the same over here they're doing that it's the conformity of what people are trying to do but the bride is one who's directly being inspired by the spirit of god being moved by the word of god to fulfill what god wants out of her that's why we have to find out ask ourselves what is influencing me and what am i manifesting am i manifesting what i see this group over here manifest what i hear this group over here manifest what i what i think this group how to manifest but there has to be a word foundation for you to go back and say i have read the scripture i have through the opening of the message i have seen what is required for this hour i have seen what the manifestation of this hour is and i'm going after it amen one one is caught up within the natural and the things that's happening but one is focused the other is focused on the spiritual wondering what is it that god is trying to show me and the word is constantly revealing itself to her that's how she knows the mind of god and and so he continues and says that not the children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man organization by any man's own organization any man-made theory she's purely unadulterated right of the word amen and amen i hope you get that it says out in the air you shall be pregnant a daughter of god now i want to say this jesus is not coming to marry a girl he's not coming to marry a a baby per se it's not coming to to marry an immature uh uh a girl or baby that's playing in the sand it's not interested in one who's crying and and turning the tempers and and doing all kinds of things is looking for one who's recognized her position and even when we say recognize your position what are we really talking about recognizing your position is to know i have been brought into the maturity in the end time and how this is the building up of what god has been building through the ages and now i'm standing here to show for us a mature bride one who texts the word one who believes what the word says about her one who's changing the image of what the word wants out of her now he says this he continues he says this is in uh this is in a message uh the the the resume of the church age he he talks he he says this and and it says it yet it is harvest time there then must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and the terror to maturity the tear has already matured very fast under corrupt teaching who turns the people from the word but the wheat also must mature i i and i say this i believe this is has to be and it is i believe the cry out of every believer every morning you woke up am i walking to maturity i i don't believe god is interested in you walking up and saying what am i gonna eat what am i gonna drink or what is that what is gonna happen today what trap the devil has in front of me i believe maturity is coming to a place where you know i'm here because god placed me here i'm here because god has worked out all things so i can be here and my job here is to try to find out what is it that he wants me to do and walk into it it's not to constantly coming back well i'm a sinner caught up in the cycle of revival and death as we said it last time today you are at the altar tomorrow you're screaming the next day you are back in the altar where are you going what are you achieving is that leading you in the right direction and i believe the lord is patient if we we have someone if we get to a place where we are babes and we need milk it will provide milk when it's necessary but the calling of this hour is a people who are called into the manifestation of the perfect son just like the lord jesus one who can send and say i know what the scripture said about me and i believe what the word said about me and i'm here manifesting what the word says otherwise we don't know what we're doing otherwise we lost in the religion and and and we come and and all the focus all the focus the devil will love to do this if all the focus disavon tonight is about i'm sick i need healing i'm hungry my child is lost and this if that's all the focus the devil will love it to do that but we have to understand that the promises as we walk in this line of duty as we walk in this pathway that he has made he knows we have need of healing he knows we have need for our sons and daughters to be saved he knows we have need of all of that in fact those things are part of the provision that he has already made but a mature person finds out what is my position what is my job where does he needs me to be then in being where he needs me to be he takes care of all the rest that i have [Applause] so we have to find out what is the calling of this hour what am i being called into it's the building as i said the building of everything from the first church agent is building up but what is he building you into now he he says this and let me just slow down for a minute i think i'm going a little faster than i wanted to now let me just say this i was i was thinking about jesus because we can i believe we can always use the model of the church that he built as a model for us and it's it's very important because we could always go back um the scripture says that he came and he told his disciple that that oh that it's imperative it's important that i go now i want you to think of yourself as one of the members of that church you think yeah that we're perhaps in the most comfortable position than any in other words if i came in uh like a woman who came in he was making all kinds of noise i said master tell him to stop and you know when one came and they knew a master was just a call away it was just not too far away that you could work him up they knew when the storm came in the boat it's just a matter of screaming out and saying master can you not see that we perish when they came across the challenge a demon that they had prayed and prayed and couldn't raise him up it's just a matter of waiting until the master get there now jesus looks at that kind of church that he built he says this is not good enough that i need to go it says it's imperative for you that i go but if i go i will come back again i'll begin to think about it in the end time i want you to imagine if brother branham was still alive today i'll tell you there'll be a beating war including me for the house next door oh i don't care how much money would cost i will put money in there to be the first one and imagine the neighborhood and and how much the housing and and if you talk about housing market bubble that would have been the biggest bubble they've ever seen in this world because this will be worldwide everybody from everywhere wanting to just get a spot where they can see him when he gets in his car jesus jesus looks at that kind of church he says i don't want a church where you can just reach out and oh brother david i need you over here whether that be that i need you over there no that's not the kind of church i want to build i'm going away so i can build the perfect church hallelujah and the perfect church will be i will come again and i will be even in you [Applause] and barbara says people get to where they think oh if so and so can pray for me then i'll be healed that's not the church god is building oh if i can only do this and be such and such place then god can hear me that's not the church's building the church's building is his spirit within his children and and he wants to get it to such a place where the husband can pray to the wife or the wife can pray for the husband and believe and god will come on the scene and do it and just like this morning we take all of that we turn into something else we take it and we have our favorite oh if this one if i can only have that brother call him up and have him pray for me oh if i can only go to such and such meeting if i can only do this he becomes your why i asked you tonight where did you get the model of that church because here he is himself he himself the king of glory he who imported them he gave them power to go and cast out devils he looks at the church that he created he looks at the church that he was building he said i'm not going to leave it here i want to take it a step further and this step further is for me to come and live within them oh my brother my sister let's not short ourselves from the glory of the message in the end time let's not short ourselves for what god really wants to do in the end time what god wants to do in the end time is to use your body to defeat the devil i don't care how old you are god is interested tonight in taking his word he already overcame in the body of jesus christ but what is interested tonight is to come and show that same overcoming in the bride's body and we said it last time it's very important you realize whatever the head is the body is also so what he done is he went and he took all that is necessary for the body to overcome he took it within the head so that you don't have to suffer pain so that you don't have to go through trouble but when the head comes and connects to the body what the head was doing the body is able to do also god is looking for individuals he's not looking for a group of people i was thinking i said i was not going to be long i was thinking about enoch you know because enoch is the type of the bride as we heard in the scripture now the scripture doesn't say that enoch and his family got raptured enoch and methuselah walk with god and they were raptured no it says enoch by himself a walk by himself enoch walker walk in them woke up in the morning and walked with god and walked with god it was changed it was changed daily until one day he walked and then he was gone that's the kind of relationship this message is bringing us into it's not a group with message relationship like pastor said this morning god is not it doesn't do us any good to gather here and say we believe the message and shouted and pet one another in the back that's not what god is looking for it's not good it's just enough for us to say all the sales are open and this is done and this is you the question you always have to ask the sales are open for what purpose what good does the sale opening do to me when you tell me about the seals being open what benefits am i drawing from that then when you can establish that relationship between the sales opening and your personal life then it can come to a benefit to you if we're not careful anybody that says they're part of the message we give him a pass oh you know he said it's part of the message but the scripture says you have to try them you have to know the character they have to have put something on display by their fruit you shall know them not by what they believe by the fruit you shall know them therefore the bride's desire and i'll say this i'll say it again it because it's burning within me just like fire is to see i want to know what the manifestation of this hour is i want to have faith in what the word said i will be so i can walk into it i'm not walking up in the morning and asking myself how many people did you heal today i would love to do it but that's not healing is not part of what i what i desire i want to know what is the word says because if i walk in obedience to the word everything else will be taken care of if i walk in the manifestation of the hour it will take care of healing it will take care of deliverance you will take care of everything then when a person can come here you can stand here and say in the name of the lord jesus stand up and walk why because you're walking in perfect obedience to the word it says this in the message it is the rising of the sun i want you to hear it says and we we read this it says and as christ was the first one to rise from all the prophets and so forth and it says all those types of many place many places he was the first first of those that slipped it says in the bride the coming of christ coming out of the church they will have a sheave wave again in the last day we went through this what was the purpose of the sheave to show you what you need to point to to show you what you need to focus on to show you what where you're walking towards to show you what you will be translated into to show you what you're walking and knowing that i'm gonna be this is to because god is doing that he doesn't want you to be left confused he doesn't want you to wonder what is the manifestation that we're talking about where are we going and what are we supposed to be manifested it's right there in the life of the prophet he showed us what a true manifestation and what a true wave shift offering is so we can look at his life so we can look his walk with god and be able to look and say that's what i desired you know you read certain things about a prophet truth you have to really dig deep to find them within yourself i think about the story that was told about how that he crossed the board and said he didn't have anything in the trunk and and he went and found out that he had something and drove all the way back you got to dig deep really deep to find out within you you can give yourself all the justification in the world i didn't know it i didn't know it was in there i didn't say i said what i thought i knew at that time i can't drive all the way back find all kinds of excuses brothers that's what i desire i i don't desire take this whole world and give me jesus give me that kind of a heart desire one who stands and his shoes are hurting and he's been preaching meeting after meeting he's standing there he's standing for the people and he knows what they're thinking about him oh my he knows and he can scream out he said i know what you say about me but still stand there with the love of god and preach the word and preach the word what about i'll tell you that's the capstone on display that's perfect love coming down and my brother my sister that's what we desire that's why i read that scripture take this whole world take all that you can give me that kind of person give me that kind of hearts and desire to just be to a place where all i desire to see is him and yet we are counting healings on this hand and healing on the other hand and the very prophets say if i will pray for a thousand new fall i'll keep praying because the word is what's important you heal this body's gonna die still what is our focus on are we moved by the thunders by the shaking of the wind or are we seeking a small voice to hear and say this is what you should do this is what you should follow now he says he says the bright coming of christ coming out they'll have a chief offering shiv wave offering again in the last day oh my waving the sheave what says wha what was the sheave the one that came the one that came into mature that came to mature the first one that proved it was a weed that proves it was a sheave hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first and it says in the first time there was to come forth there was the there there will come forth the bright in the right for the bright age for resurrection out of the denomination will be a message he says that will fool that that the full maturity of the world has turned back again into the full power he's saying being waved over the people by the same sign and the same wonders that he did back there then i said that's why when we read this message i read the scripture in first thessalonians but whatever says he says he talks about uh even the very order of the rapture he says the shout comes forth what is the shout it says it's the living bread of life calling forth the bride and then he says what is the voice it's the voice of the resurrection what is the trump is to gather up all so we can go and meet up for the waiting supper now he's saying all those things and he says he says he does all these things as he's descending oh my brother my sister now remember he said that the rapture and faith will not come until the opening of the sails because it says it's them seven sails that will awaken the bride and put forth in her the rapture in faith so therefore when it comes after the opening of the seals and he began to talk about these things there is a group of people who are being taken back and there's a group of people who are realizing what they were since the beginning and they have received the word the word is calling them for highest calling than any may have ever been called and they've accepted it and they know by accepting the word of god god will bring those things to come to pass how is the body going to be changed by believing the world you said how is that possible how is it possible that you're sitting here tonight how is it possible you tell me how is it possible you sitting here tonight and i'll tell you how it's possible for your body to be changed [Music] i can count all possible ways that i could be here tonight i can't find one the same god who created a miracle who changed situations who put you in such a bind why you couldn't deny him who opened your eyes to see this message who walked with you who wastes you from the dead who delivers you from the things he's the same god who's going to change your body [Music] the moment we take our eyes off this and we look to someone we're going in a different line like we heard it this morning then what do we do we put now i'll say this we even get to a place because remember when you do that you counting say well so if that weather goes missing that means the rapture is taking place hear me out it means you put someone before you in the rapture what the prophet is saying if there's to be one going if there'll be one going it has to be you you've already displaced everything i don't care if i don't see anybody i know the rapture didn't start because i'm here oh my brother my sister and i want to say this when jesus hearing is going through the garden of gethsemane he had a will as a man he has a will but when he says he could have married he could have done all of that but it's not until he died to everything until he was killed from everything else and the only thing that took him from where he was into where he was growing was faith in the word of god [Music] we can't make it without faith we cannot make it by intellect what we need is the word the reveal word of the hour to create faith within our heart we we would have to die for every inner like thing we've learned every little bit of what we claim to believe will be tested you would have to come to a place you say if god doesn't come i'm dead and that's where you begin you have to come to the consciousness that i don't care what men said i don't care what explanation has been told if god said this i'm walking in it you're gonna get killed that's all right you're gonna get cast down that's all right because we are not called to go as a group we are being called to go as an individual who's met god face to face so you have to ask yourself what the the the bride's condition in the end time what i'm hearing the fellowship that i'm associating with everything that i'm doing is it leading me to this kind of manifestation is it leading me to this kind of mindset or is it something that brings you right back to where you started again and brings you right back into where you feel like this is not enough you need something else and and you need to go back and repent and go back and repent the scripture says that if we walk in the blood if we walk in the light as he is the light the blood of christ cleanses us from all uncleanness your uncleanness he's taking care of it so he says here here it is what i'm trying to say the law of reproduction is that each species bringeth forth after its own kind now i want to say this before i continue to read each species bring forth after its own kind when a chicken has an egg that egg will not remain an egg it would hatch it will start up as little and it will grow the law of reproduction causes it to come back like a chicken again in the image of the chicken not to remain just a little baby chicken but to come right back into the full maturity of a chicken and i believe that's why the prophet will say some places it says oh i'm saying this because i need to rub up some of the med belief that we still have and i'll say this because i need to just make it perfectly clear because of this and why because he knows when we are born we have all kinds of things following us we have our unbelief our ways that we have learned from the world and the things that the church and what the church has done you know i'll say this everyone sitting here has been influenced by catholic you find out our mind has been always influenced you look at you say well i didn't go to a catholic church whatever denomination you went to is part of the mother well our mind is always in a certain way and we hear something we jump in front of it oh perhaps this is it that's it god is saying no just walk with me let me lead you let me take you you see it stay there continue to ask for it continue to praise for it continue to do it until i open your eyes until i make it manifest to you not until you figure it out yourself until i make it manifest the only thing that the seed has to do is to remain in the presence of the sun there is no other requirement now he says the species it says according to genesis 1 and 11 it says and god said let it let you bring forth the grass the earth yielding seed and the fruity uh tree yielding fruits of this kind who sit in itself who is in itself upon the earth and it was so it says whatever life was in the seed come forth into the plant into the plants and once and dance into fruit it says the very same law applies to the church today what law i would come again and i even i will pour into you what i am so the works that i do you may do also now i just want to let me read this and then i'll break into something here and then we can come back it says it says now um whatever seed started the church will come forth will come forth and be like the original seed because it's the same seed indeed it says in in these last days the true right the true church bride he says christ seed will come to the headstone will come into the headstone and she will be a super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image what are we walking into now the the the it's not hard to find out what his image is because all we have to do is go back in the scripture this is not something that someone needs to explain to you and his image that we know of is the sun can do nothing except what he sees the father do just get to a place where what a humility what a man a humble man you could even push him he looked like there was no beauty in him to be desired he didn't walk down the streets and everybody noticed him he was just such a humble man in the ward oh but within that man lies the power of almighty god lied the greatest power that ever touched the earth within that man lies the whole mighty god himself my brother my sister that's the type of the bride oh we get to a place where oh let me say this when you read a scripture about jesus christ you might as well put your name in it because jesus today is you it's the manifestation of this tower when we say he went and he did this it's you that's doing it is that what we're manifesting is that at least what we our heart is pressing for or are we still at the level where oh father i can't do nothing today i need healing and i need oh i tell you if you were purposed within your heart to do something for god i don't care what devil stands on your way well i'm not well you know what i'm going to do this is the business of my father and i believe as i'm doing his business he'll take care of all of this how many times a preacher has ever shown up here not feeling well at all and he just comes and he knows this is the post of duty he stands up here and before too long it feels like it was nothing how many times have you went to church or done something where you feel like you couldn't do it but just decided to go anyway you just decided to show up anyway and then god just drops right in there and he changes the situation it's a battle it's not gonna come easy you have to pull it out you have to ask for it you have to demand it you have to walk in it you have to come and take it out of the devil you have to claim it as yours getting to a place where oh i just need this the scripture says the son as he is as a child is no different from a slave why because he doesn't understand the difference between what belongs to him what authority has been given he's still under tutors but when he comes to an age where he understand what the father's business is and i believe the church in the end time is the church who's walking into maturity to understand the full picture why are we here saying that the mind of christ has been revealed to us it says what was in god's part back part of the mind god has made it known to you for what so you can walk in the maturity because as he's revealing himself he's revealing you now just for a few moments this is john 17 and this is the prayer that jesus prayed for you now listen it says and this word spake jesus said he lifted up his eyes in heaven and said father the hours come glorify thy son and the son will also thy son also may glorify thee it says a thou as thou giveth me power over all flesh and has that that he should give eternal life as many as thou has given me who else has been given power to give eternal life oh my it's about time we change our prayer he continues on and he says and this is life eternal that ye might know that they might know that they might know that they might know thee the only true and true god and jesus christ whom that has sinned think about this jesus is positioning himself just as the messenger making you realize whose power this is oh what do we say if the same spirit that raised christ from the dead he didn't raise himself up it was a spirit that raised them up if the same spirit dwells in you it will also what quicken your mortal body so that same god jesus is positioning and says i want where i'm standing that they can stand there too i want the same way you give me power to raise the dead you give me power to give eternal life that they can do it too he says and i have glory it says i have glorified thee on earth i have finished the work that thou has given to me me to do oh now father glorify me with thine own self that glorify me with thy own self with the glory which i had indeed before the world was who else had glory before the world one that's the revealing of the end time is that you are not just a fallen sinner you're just not a person try to make it to heaven the understanding of the end time is you are being brought back into the glory that you had in the beginning the scripture says the sons of god shouted for joy what joy did we shout for because we were part of god's plan in the beginning let's not sell ourselves short let's not diminish all the great work even the scripture telling us that all the great prophets that desire to be in this hour this is not just our poor my spirit we get another baptism of the holy ghost and we're good now this is the return to what was in the beginning this is where it all began it says i have manifested thy name unto them which thou giveth me out of the world it says thine the word and thou giveth them me and they i have kept by i have kept and and they have kept thy word so notice is saying those that came to him there were those that were given to him do you know there are those that are given to you too do you know there are those that are given into you so that you will speak to them and god will move and make it manifest they are those that only you can touch they are those that are giving in you your heart hurt for them and god moves on the thing what are we doing why are we selling ourselves short he's here praying and showing you everything about yourself so you can go and pray the same prayer and say father i'm here i'm asking because my heart is moving for such and such if my heart is moving that means you give them to me but the holy spirit in the end time is like walking on nails right walking just a tight knight you don't want to sin you don't want to offend anybody you just want to make sure that only you mix it to the end the bride is not going to be a defeated fall the bride is not going to make it just us all we can say we made it the bride is walking victorious because the victory came from the head down to the body the bride is here to walk in the scripture that was speaking about her she's here to turn upside down the devil's kingdom [Music] i don't want anything short than to create the biggest trouble for the devil but if we walk in the morning and all we care about oh my it's just me or god i'm the only one that you save and god is looking like do you understand i have children everywhere and and do we think that they're gonna come something that's so big and that god will have to rearrange his plan and say well i didn't see the devil pulling this on me we said it last time in fact everything that he does he asked for permission everything that he can touch he has to ask for permission it says now they have known it says they have known that all things whatsoever thou had given me are of thee for i have given that unto them the words which thou givet me and they received them aren't you glad to receive the word he he gave the word to a word receiver he gave the word to one that would receive it and i have known surely that i have it says and i know and i have known surely that i have come out uh i have come out from thee it says and they have believed that thou did ascend me. i pray for i pray for them i pray not for the world but i pray for them which thou had given me for they are dying it says and all mine are dying and dying of mine and i'm glorified in them everything about you is his everything about his is yours now it's easy for us to believe that everything ours is years but when it comes for his to be ours you're like that's too much it is but uh not the measure that i want it to be it's a little bit smaller because i can't receive it because you make your own excuses yes jesus saying you gave me life you gave me eternal life and i gave it to them you told me and i told them all that's yours is mine all that's mine is yours a perfect prayer in fact he comes back and he says the same way that you sent me i'm sending them how did he how how was he sent barbara says the same god who sent him dwelt within him oh my brother my sister god didn't send you just by yourself the same god is here to dwell in you to go inside of you the manifestation of this house if the musician could come out you just keep going and going so it says and now it says i'm no more in the world it says now i am no more in the world but these are in this world and i cut and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou had give it thou giveth me given me that they may that they may uh be one as we are one while i was with them in the world i kept them by thy name now i i want you to to pay attention to this i kept them by thy name it says those that that thou giveth me i have kept them and none of them is lost but the son of prediction that the scripture may be fulfilled and now i come to thee that these and these things i speak in the world that they might have joy that they may have joy their joy fulfilled in themselves i have given them the word and the world hated them oh my i tell you this he's manifesting he's telling what the what happened to him when he was sent he's showing the description of what happened to him when he was said and he's matching that description with you the moment you touch this word the moment you receive this word the moment you come in contact and accept this word automatically the world hates you automatically something is wrong with you but oh he's saying that i kept them by my name what is the name of the father the lord jesus christ and as he went he came back on the day of pentecost he says let there be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost but as in whose name the name of the father the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost which is what the lord jesus christ so he comes back as the spirit himself to dwell in them and protect them let's not forget what church is god looking for it's not looking for a church that has built the nickelodeon spirit where there's always one man that we got to go to oh that's why i appreciate our pastors approaching everything you got somebody who's sick absolutely you can call and get some help but be the first one to pray be the first one to cast out that devil be the first one to come and say i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god i've been blessed here for a purpose i don't need the world i need jesus and if i have jesus within my heart that's good enough now but ranam says it says in a very plain language the true bride of christ was in the mind of god eternally don't not express until each came in the designation uh decreased season but it says each member comes from each member comes forth in uh come forth it becomes expressed and took its place in the body each member this is not a global expression it's not even a church expression but it's each member as we are being born we are being brought into an individual expression of what jesus is that's why we are not cloned yet we are manifesting the same christ but we each have our natures manifesting the same christ we have our own habits and things and and everything but all through the confounds of the word why because it's the same christ manifesting within his body it says this is the this bride thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride amen literal spoken word seed bride i i want you to just let that sink in for a moment the word of god cannot fail man's word will pass away but the word of god cannot fail what we need to find within ourselves is when god spoke something the same god we understand that god is his own interpreter he will bring the word to come to pass what we need to do is stay within this other line that our pastor has been saying i want to stay within that line where the word is being manifested expressed within my body i'm becoming this word being expressed not my own intelligence not my own uh touching and feeling oh maybe it's this maybe it's that no but walking within the compound of the word and as you walk in the word he's doing the manifestation he's doing the calling he's doing i tell you when the sun when the the the seed or the flower stands before the sun all the sun the sun is the one calling the flower out of it story of the reverend lady it's the sun who's pulling it's the sun calling that pushes forth the flower to come forth it's not you pussing and everything you push when it says push you stop when it says stop you don't do nothing when it says nothing oh but when you hear it when it hits your heart you said father i'm coming father i'm coming forth oh i tell you but i'm speaks about how in the end time yeah we are people are interested in the kind of religion that would just baby them oh you know today you need milk and tomorrow you need milk you're sick okay we'll do this for you we'll do that for you you don't have a job we'll do this and do that and and and constant oh almost like the kind of priest almost like a kind of priest he talked about a hot house plant oh it needs to be sprayed up and he needs to be taken care of but he says but a true to a true flower a true seed is rugged it's been brought forth with the true nature of god he knows how to repel stuff by itself and he knows how to fight and he's been trying to fight and and he knows who to call he's coming contact with god and you can't take that away from them let's come in contact more with god than we need with our own intellect what we need is come in contact with that word let it just permeate you let it just cause you to just break down within you and come alive again and therefore it's no longer you that lives with him that lives within you he says here he says now then here we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos was manifested in the sun and then and in jesus dwelleth the all fullness of god head bodily and the eternal one was the father manifested in flesh thereby gain the title of son even so we eternal in the thoughts of in the thoughts in the thoughts in our turn become many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh it says those eternal thoughts now manifested in the flesh are sons of god the son of god in this same time is not any man's maid handled by any man led by any man he's led by the spirit of god himself you're not made to be handled by people you're not made men to handle by men's thinking and theology and everything you are a son of god don't let anything tell you otherwise walk like a son joke like a son believe what a son can do believe what the word says about you believe the manifestation of this hour know what you want and stand there and proclaim it until god makes it a reality otherwise you go from prayer line to prayer line from altar call to altar call never getting anywhere oh but let god touch your heart even tonight where you can watch and say things are no longer the same what happened to you i know who i am and what i am the man has no power no the devil has no authority to touch it i go to my father the scripture says about the prodigal son he said he came back to himself oh i pray that we come back to ourselves tonight i pray we just realize even though it says even the servants at my father's house are well fed even the servant but no more you are not a servant he's called you a son and when you show up he didn't give you a place for servant he said come on let's put the robe of glory on him let's put the ring of power within him why because the sun is returned oh is this just a story that's not just the story that's god talking about his own children his own family that he's bringing together in the end time i want this or nothing i'm not interested in anything in between i want this or nothing let's all stand [Music] he says now remember in christ we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bone when god wounded christ at calvary he wounded he wounded for me and you we are flesh of his flesh and born of his born it says body of his body name of his name bride of him we are in him we are his flesh and his bone and god has already praised us up raised us up potentially quickening power has raised us up from the life of sin and changes on being a change of being it's it has potentially raised up from uh raise us up in christ jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in the fully maturity what are we looking for what are we after we don't want to go back we want to move forward we want to reach out and say father i'm coming home father i see you've opened my eyes to see and that's what i'm desiring and we don't we want to live above the world we want to live above the things that this easily besets us we want to move into that place where it's the manifestation of him once again in the end time because that's what we've been called to let's just by heads our gracious father lord these things they just run so deep lord we pray that you just help our unbelief father that we the things that cloud is our minds and cause us to see differently lord even as our pastor said this morning anything that men strive to inject lord i pray you give us eagle eyes though we may see the word and the word alone lord we pray that you may just make your word a reality to the people tonight we commit what we are to you and we pray father even by the power of your might that you may move in our midst tonight and your work you make your word a reality to us we love you and commit everything we are to you and ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's just sing that oh and we are the generation we're the culmination of [Music] is [Music] here is [Music] hey what a privilege tonight to hear god's word that's what i was trying to say i'm telling you i'm just going to give my notes to billy because he can preach it better than anybody that i know that was marvelous word tonight marvelous marvelous word of god truth something that we can grab a hold of amen and what we're called to do is just take that word and know it's ours and have a hundred percent faith in it and then we'll see him do the works these works shall follow them that believe you know the beautiful part of it's going to be all the glory is going to go to him we're just going to be praising god for the things that we're seeing him do we're just going to be so happy to be in his midst as he's fulfilling everything you know brother said that god has to keep his word in order to remain god well he wasn't god till he created somebody so he's got to have people that worship him because god's an arbitrage of worship so he's going to keep his word so he can remain to be god and have people praising him oh hallelujah hallelujah i just think it's it's wonderful let's sing that little psalm pour your spirit out on me amen isn't that what our hearts desire is do you understand how billy encouraged us tonight the holy spirit jubilee is this is you don't look at the old man don't look at the negative look at what he said he said when you're sick if you keep looking at the sickness and keep looking at the symptoms that's what you're keeping alive but if you look at the promised word and you look at a healed man and you walk in them then that's what you become so if you look at this message you will become this message [Music] if you believe that this is you that he spoke of you will become what he said oh i like that but just let's just this song i just love this song just pour your spirit out on me or i'm thirsting for this i want this to come to me i want to be that bride that the messenger came and what
