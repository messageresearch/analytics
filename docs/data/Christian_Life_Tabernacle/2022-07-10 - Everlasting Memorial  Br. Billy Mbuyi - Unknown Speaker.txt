with much [Music] I want to sing the verses but I don't know have helped me out [Music] why don't you just whisper those words to the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] scripture reading and then we'll be seated let's start in first John chapter five first John chapter five we'll start from verse one it says whosoever believe that Jesus is the Christ is one of God and everyone that loveth him that loveth him that the god that be God loveth him also has begotten of him he says by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his commandment for this is the love of God that we keep his commandment and his Commandments are not Grievous it says for whatsoever whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith he says who is who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that come by water and blood and even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the scripture that bearth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that their record of in heaven the father of the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and the three and there are and there are three now they're witness in Earth their Spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one if we receive the witness of man the witness of God is greater this is the witness of God which he had testified of his son he that believeth on the son of on the Son of God had the witness of himself he that believeth not God had the witness of a lie of him that a witness had made him a liar because he believed not the record of that God gave his son it says and this is the record that God had given to us eternal life and this life is in his son that he he that had the son had life and he died not the Son of God had not life these things have I written unto you that you believe on the name of the son of God Amen the godhead the blessing on the reading of his word you may be seated also turn your Bibles once again just continue to have you open First Peter chapter one we're going to read from 22 to 25 it says seeing ye have purified your soul uh you know obeying the truth through the spirit unto um unfind love and and Brethren he says see that ye love one another with pure heart with pure heart fervently being born again not of correct we'll see that Incorruptible by the word of God which abideth which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is grass and all glory of man is as flower of grass the grass with it and the follower wherefore fadeth away but the word of God endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you one more scripture in Matthew 24 verse 35 he says Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away amen I certainly enjoyed the word this morning I think the god when the prophet says that God always has a way to comfort his children he says that the message of the hour will meet the challenge of the hour and I've always believed that regardless of what we're going through I believe that God has a word and I really appreciate what Matthew had to say this morning we talk about a God who can take a bad situation and turn it into good you know he's a God who takes the negative turns it into a positive The God Who takes the trial and turns it into Victory God who takes defeat and changes into Victory it takes a shameful situation and turns it into a testimony that's kind of because why he has the power of transformation in fact that's what he socializes in you come you're all broken up and you're all out of shape and shameful and you don't even know where to start he says this is what I specialize in I remember him talking about the testimony I think he went into a mental institution and he was looking for this young lady and and he came in they had to thought you know it was someone who was in changing everything and then he found the young lady was talking and he says it's me and then it's beginning to talk to her she should begin to pour out her heart and everything and all that was within her heart and and she gets there and she says all of this and but why don't you come to Christ why don't you believe he says oh he'll never take me like this that's the material that God works in that's the kind of material he's ready to take and hold in everything you know our Pastor Ray that quote I was going to bring it out but you know we don't know man we don't understand situation and oftentimes God will have to take something that he already built and break it apart so we can build a new one so we can build the greater one so we can make it even better than what he did before the scripture says in Psalm 30 and 11 it says thou has turned my morning into dancing thou has put off my shot clause and grinded me with something with gladness it says we like we it says it says the scripture was saying Romans 8 it says that all and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose in other words all we are here to do is to know that we are called for his purpose as long as we are here doing his purpose everything will work out for good I was at home and just thinking and I thought about the story the program talks about this young missionary who was planning to go to Africa to go preach and and he said that uh when when he got ready to go he went before the board and he told them that he was going to go to Africa and take his family I believe they had two daughters he was planning to take them and everything and and so when he got before the board to begin to question him that again says you know are you really sure you want to go and if I could just read it so he went before the board meeting in the church and it says God called me to be to go in the mission failed away in a jungle in Rhodesia in the jungle infected with malaria and fever and hot sun and and and and plates and leprosy and all kinds of diseases back in the jungle where he was going to what he was going to make it says take the rest of his life uh he says he sold his home he sold his home and he had all the mission board wanted to test him and see it says are you sure now it says yes I am positive they said unto him sir if you thought on this manner that you've got two little two pretty little girls and go in the lovely young wife and he says why don't you go over and see how it is and then come back he said no the Lord told me it says oh so it's so real he said the Lord called me and I don't I don't want to leave my home he says I don't want to leave my church I don't want to leave my people it says but the Lord called me back there in that jungle and it says and he said sir did you know that your little girls could get yellow fever and black fever and die overnight he referred to a different people that had lost their children the little fellows and I had taken them back there and and he says on diseases I had no that they had no uh inoculation and things like leprosy and and and your pretty wife and the two little girl with Leprosy and the hot sun and the things they've put on aren't you afraid of the danger of taking your children and your wife in such a place the missionaries stood there and the young fellow and tears began to run down his chicks and they turn around and he says Brothers my vision of God's call he said if God called me to be in Africa my children and my family is more safe in Africa than in the play at any place in the world I was thinking about this and perhaps in an angle that will probably seem a little uh unconventional but I want to say this it's very important that we be where God called us to be her restaurant because that's the place of our protection it's very important as We Gather here we are sure within ourselves that I'm here because God put me here I'm here because God blessed me here because if that's not the case then there's a Wandering there's a questioning there's everything but this young missionary was sure within us says I'm here it says I would be at the place where God called me to be I'm a lot more safe why because you are useful there God will protect you there he will provide for you he will do all things and that's why when we got to hear it's within our heart we have sure that I'm here because God placed me here and he talks about even himself I thought perhaps in the same a long line of what I just read it said this isn't question and answer he says I was talking to a man this week a very prominent businessman in the city who said he talked to me about going back going back to uh into Africa and in in in in India he says why he says they've got uh they've got through killing a British general over there and I said what is God what has that got to do with me he said you're going back over there it says we are going over back over there where they are all murderers going on and the race riot and so forth I said sure that's where I'm needed for the Lord wants me to go he said what if what if they kill you I said well if God wants God wants me to be killed I'll just I'll just I'll just be killed that's all and they said Oh my he said you ought to think you ought to think on that well I don't care it says I think you are religious I think you are a good man he said but I think they would even it says they even killed Jesus Christ I said sure it was God's will he said what God's will he said that's what I've been that's what I've he says that man has been going to church close to 70. and he's been going to church he was in the Cradle rolled in the fine in fine churches in the city and they come up and they never known that it was God's will for Jesus to die oh my I just thought about it I said if we can only come to a place all we want is God's will to die from our own will our own desire our own uh Pursuit our own everything God all I want is to see your will unfolded in my life all I want to see is you expressing your will in my life and not my will amen I trust I just hope that will be a blessing to you it's just on my heart and I thought I would just read that before I can uh start tonight as we read in the scripture if I want to give a title this message this thought came into my heart from what we've been even our pastor has been preaching um and and I want to I was listening to a message I believe the title of it was time-tested Memorial and I wanted a title my thought Everlasting Memorial it just came to my heart and I want to go through it I'm not sure if we're going to finish it whenever time is up we'll just stop it says I was telling my brother Matthew in the back I said we already had the meal this uh this morning this is just dessert so I don't want to take too long I just want to make sure I get the the enough time of what I need so when Everlasting Memorial so when we talk about Memorial it speaks about it's something it's a structure or something established to remind people or a person of an event that transpired so it's something or is structure to help recall something to memory um it could be a monument it could be something uh you could uh oftentimes you can go places I remember uh we had you could you could look I we had the opportunity of being uh uh visiting Pearl Harbor me and my wife when we got married we went there on 4th of July uh to just see they have such a play you know they have uh veterans that went to war at that time they have modified aircraft that fought in that war and the whole Memorial places where the the ships were synced that never was pulled out they built a memorial on top where you could actually look and be able to see all of the structure there and and it's built in such a way when you go in by the time you go out it's it almost uh puts a mark on you you can never walk away and just forget about it then go your day because it reminds you of the name you see the names on the walls and of all the people that were are stuck in those ships and those that were killed and you see we have memorials everywhere streets names are named after memorials and places we have in Downtown Dallas you go you see where a memorial where John F Kennedy was killed in uh we've been in Washington DC you go and there's the Lincoln Memorial that stands there for you to look and you look across you see the George Washington Memorial all of those things I put in place for them to remind you of something that took place it's there to recall to memory because man uh has almost the nature to always keep forgetting things as they go by and they move along they forget they move along but yet those things are placed there for us to forget because once you forget you tend to always run into the same situations I believe they say that the people that never learns from history are bound to repeat the same thing if we don't learn about our mistakes we don't learn about the things that surround us if we don't pay attention and keep those things current though we are bound to come back and repeat those same exact mistakes and I want to say that as we see those memorials and all those things and I could say this tonight that those things are there but yet uh uh uh people have forgotten the very meanings of them even when they put their in front of them and we can talk about some memorials but Ronald speaks about the Egypts and the whole uh Caesars and the Romans and all of those I said some memorials that were built by human we found them under the ground 20 feet down in other words men's Memorial I never ever lasting they always built to be there for a certain amount of time regardless of how great they will build how great of an achievement and how that their messages wanted to be echoed it only has an expiration time the only living Memorial that lives forever is God's Memorial and andam says this he speaks it says and and he he speaks now this is in the message time tested Memorial in paragraph 17 he picks about uh uh you know yeah no not paragraph 17 but he speaks here he says now Memorial is a great things we appreciate memorials and many men it says in this life has tried to live behind uh behind behind them some sort of Memorial nearly all men love to do that it says they put on their graves a great marker that's right sure I love to do a it says I I sure they love to do that happen in the graveyard they make a great sign that's right I surely appreciate that that's okay it says then many tries to build the Great shrines it speaks about how they try to bring great shrines and all those things but yet those things are only temporal the only living Memorial that we know of is the Lord Jesus Christ I began to think you you could say well you know as Christians we also have a memorial we say we have the cross and we have the tomb but I want to put it into perspective I want to say this tonight the cross is only there for a remembrance for you to remember the sacrifice that was given the price that was paid for you and the tomb is an empty tomb it's there and it's empty to show you that there was resurrection that took place that the life that was was given is no longer in the Tomb but the life is Everlasting the life is living today and is living in the people the life is an everlasting life it can never die if you go back and you look at the memorials of all those people including the Pharaohs you will go you'll find that there's such a tomb but yet within the tomb you'll find that the body is in there the only tomb that has nobody included where you can go and the body is disappear is the Lord Jesus Christ why because it's a memorial of God trying to show that heaven and earth will pass away all men's Memorial will pass away the only Everlasting Memorial that will save forever is the Lord Jesus Christ and what he promised you will come to pass now he speaks about this atheists in Ohio a man who came and he was against Christianity he called himself he was a modern science uh person and and in Infidel who said that uh he didn't believe he says away with a or with a with a word and he says and he wanted he believed in in modern science but when he died he said that that that if I die that they should build the memorial of him having his foot on the Bible and and and things like that to show his unbelief that the word was not true and and and he says but when it says in modern science and when he was dying he says uh if I've been wrong serpent should will crawl out of my grave oh my man is calling himself damnation upon himself not even knowing almost like the children of Israel said let his blood be upon us in our children not understanding that they're bringing the prophecy to come to pass for themselves oh that's why it's so careful that we we be careful with the things that we say the things that we are well because we are bringing damnation to ourselves and he says and when he was dying it says that if I've been wrong that certain should crawl out of my grave and when I die that they should it says it says they were still shovering out dirts of the grave and they killed two or three big vipers and today in the grave and minister is taking a picture recently and brought it and showed me he says hanging over the chains around his lot his grave a beautiful place it says but his mouth is nothing but a snake Mount and nothing it says and no matter no matter even if it falls in Winter certain still crawls in the grave immemorial God forbid ever a memorial like this for any of you oh my brother my sister this word is true the memorial of God is a true Memorial and what makes it a true Memorial is when he died he died so his grace could be extended so his healing could be extended so all of the provision that he had in his book could be extended and today we today we are sitting here as benefactors of his memorial of what he died for and we can say his healing is true why because we've experienced it we can say his salvation is true why because we've tasted of it we can say his Deliverance is true why because what he died for his memorial is alive in us today oh we live by the grace of God the scripture will tell us not by anything we've achieved not by what we could do not but what we can say but the grace of God manifesting itself saving us bringing us out of the world and providing for us to be alive today and to live to testify of the things of God what a memorial what is your Memorial my Memorial is I want my life to testify of Jesus Christ of his greatness and his goodness towards the world it was given to me not for me to keep but to live as a memorial to the world so that they may know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now the scriptures speaks in Romans it says and and I'll read this it says Romans chapter 3 it says for what advantage sent out the Jews and profit in there of circumcision he says much ever made much it says much every way chiefly it says and because unto them we're committed the Oracles of God for what if some did not believe it says then shall the unbelief make the faith of God without a fact all but in verse 5 verse 4 it says God forbid yeah let God be true but let every man be a liar as it is written oh my brother my sister the unbeliever doesn't make the world of God unsure though make-believer doesn't make the world of God untrue all they're doing is they're testifying of the truth of God that only him that God calls will come all they're doing is the testifying of the truth that he already said in the beginning that only my children my ship will hear my voice another they will not follow they will fall after all of these things but my children will come to me all they're doing is testifying that they were they didn't have it in in them to begin with they didn't have the seed to believe with and only those that were born of the uncorruptable seed will hear the word of God and believe it and he says speaks about the the character of man and I want to say this it's very important to realize and to come to a place where we are here building a memorial we are not here as individual people doing their own things where we just come together and we rejoice and then we go home no but we are here building a memorial God is building a spiritual house and every part of us every one of us is a stone that's going to go in this living Memorial is a stone that's going to be part of this great building and I don't know if we'll have time to get to it he talks about the Temple of Solomon how that the parts of the temples were built all across the world they were shaped and they were cut and they were put into pieces and it was brought together and in the end time the only thing that was needed was just the blessing of the stone he says there was not a best of the soul that was going by why because those stones were cut off to be so it's such a specific form and everything that each one had a place in the building you you have to come to a place that says I'm a stone I I you know I wanted to give the title of my sermon tonight A Lively Stone in God's Building I'm a stone I'm part of this Stone I'm part of this Lively bleeding that God is building and everything that's coming into your life everything that's happening to you it's God shaping you so you can get to be and feed a place that he has for you don't never discourage like her brother said this morning don't ever look at yourself it says war is me why am I going through this God doesn't love me he's forgotten about me he's only touching those as a spiritual you know no God doesn't have favoritism and I want to even say this God is not a Maverick who just works and does things on himself God is a family man he worries about his children to make sure the well he gives all that he has so they can do he functions within the body he doesn't have this one do what they want over here that one just do that one says I'm not part I'm not interested I'll just come and participate no it the scripture says he will leave the 99 and go after one true sorry I just got carried away so it's this car right there says character is made known by his works it says whatever you are your Works prove what you are it says no matter how much you testify whatever you say prose con it says that has nothing to do with it oh my we talk big we we have a big presentation we say so much but yet we forget that that has nothing to do with it it's what we do last one it's what we do we the understanding that I am a stone part of a building I am here to be shaped to be put into a form so that I can fit God's Building the memorial is not your Memorial the memorial is God's Memorial and whatever he chooses to bring out of you I'm saying God bring it out of me he says it's not what you said nothing if you could put that on the board but I would appreciate it it says it has nothing to do with what you uh it has nothing to do with it it says your Works tells what you are tell us what you are inside every job that you do manifested what you are it says a new businessman it says if you just do a a patched up job and see and see what I mean it says just a halfway job I he says it says don't do that if you can't do it right don't do it at all that's right when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell uh sell out and Lock Stock and Barrel it says don't come to Christ don't come at all it says but when you really when you really want to be a Christian stand out oh my friend and my says he didn't say fit in he says stand out why because God didn't make us to be a bunch of stones that are exactly the same that talks the same way walks the same way no he's made us to be an expression of himself and as an expression himself it's him that gives the expression it's not your own expression you are expressing a part of him oh I so love it when I see ministers perhaps from overseas or different places that even in our midst or a pastor in everyone you can see it's the same word of God but because of the way God has built the vessel because of the way the experiences and the things that the vessel has gone through you can see how that God is molding The Vessel and bringing the same word that you've been hearing it but yet this sounds just he just has something about it why because it's the same God it's the same word but yet the expression he brings the expression all right there he says when you come to Christ you don't absolute you if if you can absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel don't come to Christ don't come at all but when you really want to be a Christian he says Stand Out make it real it says that's what God wants God wants you to be that's all to prove it says your work will prove your character what your character is your character is known by The Works that you do oh my I thought my character is going to be made by what I say no by The Works that you do you know as Son of God or a dog when he has a son it's a dog it doesn't work up and see well I'll learn to be a dog today or a cat learns and says okay I'm a cat and I need to find out what cats do and sometimes I feel like as Christians sometimes that's how we act we try to find what is the Son of God do what is the son no it's within you it's whatever your desire is it's whatever bits within your heart that's why when we heard this message it was something that you but when it says something like when you heard it it's something like you always wanted to be it's something that sounded something that you always wanted to be it sounded you said I like that it says it was you looking at yourself in the mirror it said they talked about things and said I want that I want that and pretty soon you find out that while it was not even about the mirror he's talking about yourself now uh in in this message but when I'm it talks about if I can put it in categories perhaps for the sake of time he talks about two separate types of memorials he talks about two separate types of memorials now the first one and he talks about is Joshua memorials and I want you to think about this for a time now here is the children of Israel they have come from Egypt and now they are in at the doorstep of the promised land for them to cross now I want to remind you that the group that was standing there at the doorstep they had they as far as they are concerned crossing the Red Sea was only a story that they heard all right because they were born in the wilderness because the generation came out because of the unbelief to cross over God said they will go around it will finish them off now this is a place if you go read it says it was only supposed to take 11 days for them to cross over but yet they were here for 40 40 years why because God wanted a new generation in fact when they went into the land and they they take uh they went and they took off the the the goods of the land and they brought back those that refused to go he says that they will never cross it says that it was going to kill all that generation but a new generation was going to go in so as far as they know and I want you to think about Joshua here he is and and the young man just been raised up and all that they knew was Moses and Moses think about the pressure that was upon him now it has to be in charge and God is comforting him in Joshua 1 it says I will be with you fear not then the same way I was with Moses I'll be with you and all of that now he has to go in front of the people and talk to them and assure them that the same God that was with Moses was going to be with him so now I want you to think about this generation that that came out of the Wilderness I'm sorry I came out of Egypt that God and what God was dealing with him we understand by the Scripture it was a mixed multitude generation it was a mixed magnitude group of people and they came when they came out it was a generation if you excuse me the expression that had what I will call A wilderness mentality that God had to get out of them all they did is they were reminiscing of the things that happened in Egypt oh do you remember them garlic and do you remember that time and do you remember them onions do you remember this and do you remember they're forgetting about all that their trials and everything and all the the the the the bondage that they were in there were a generation when anything anytime Whenever there was just a disruption they turned right away and began to talk about the old now I want you to think because I want to come down to us I tell you my brother my sister it's not going to help us to talk about God just a god of history of what he'd done and and how great that he was with our father even including ourselves do you remember when you were saved how glorious that was well if that's not the same as today if today is not greater than yesterday you're missing something because it's the same God now there were those that were part of that that never knew what it means with the heard about the testimonies of what God did at the right sea and everything now God is taking them into the promised land but he had to do something new for them he comes and they came and they came at the upon at the doorstep remember I said Lively Stone and he gives them a perfect way for them to move it says that I want you to send the priest with a Ark of the Covenant first the priest takes the ark and then begin to walk and and as they walk the scripture says when the feet get into the water now when you go read you'll hear that they went to the River Jordan when they went to Jordan it was the time where it was overflowing but one of them says they must have gone at the wrong time I want you to think about that you'll get there and the river is all flooded when there are seasons where it's a little bit lower but you show up at the season when it's over flooded now they could have looked at it and said well you know what this is not the time let's go back but the word of the Lord had gone before them and that's what I want as if this tonight we could just capture this I feel like I'll just it will just help us tonight now it's important we as the children of God when we sit here you have to know that you are not here by your own thinking the word went before you before you could be here the word had to come out of God's mouth he had to pronounce it he had to have said it he have to have promised it he have to have projected it then if you go by the strength of what he protected nothing will stop on your way if you go by your own thinking you're gonna drown if you just go because everybody else is going you're not gonna make it so now they come and the priests get into the watering and now as the Crossing Joshua tells them he says now out of the 12 tribes I want each tribe each person from each tribe a representative of all of them that they come and come into the very depths of the the river when God had dried it up that they will pick up each one a stone and take it over they came and they pick up a stone one pick up a stone and for each tribe and they took and it says all about a thousand to two thousand uh two a million to two million they're all crossed and they went and they took it to the place where they're gonna rest and this God said they said now I want you to build the memorial with these Stones I want you to stack them up and build a memorial it says when your children will ask you that you will tell them what the Lord had done now I want you to take moving in the time where things seem to be impossible this is God moving at the season where it seems like we're never going to get out of this situation this is God having moved in your life at the time where you thought this was the end of me it says God moving at a time where you knew within yourself that I'm done this is the end of me but yet it's moving and then within the movement he's giving you a stone for you to carry a revelation for you to carry out and use that Revelation for you to talk to your children about oh my brother my sister God is not built upon just teaching where we can come and teach each and everyone God is a savior God Is A Healer God is this and God is this and says go on and be fine no God wants to give you a stone for yourself he wants you to build the memorial within yourself where you can come up here or where you can go anywhere stand there and say I'm not just talking about this Bible but I'm here to let you know that this Bible became this person in other words what he said in here he did it here that's why a living Memorial that's why I said all the other memorials where are they they're in the ground the only living Memorial that stood up that men could never take away was the Lord Jesus Christ and how did they live he says because I live you shall live also you are that Memorial that God is building so he takes them and he takes the stone and and they build it and I began to think about Peter when he said he said who do men say that I am now those that came out of wilderness that came out of Egypt when they came when they were there it says who the men said they could have said well you know what I was born in the wilderness my parent told me about how we crossed the Red Sea they said my parents told me how that God opened up the Red Sea and it was he tried it up he blocked it on both sides and we were able to walk my parents and everyone was able to walk on dry land and they came in and that's how we come here but you see that was not good enough and then it says what do you say that I am that was this parent Stone what is your stone come on what is your stone tonight God is not but when I'm telling says God doesn't have grandchildren he's not interested for us to tell the story over and over and over so he becomes good nurse no he the reason for the story he saw that the ones that hears it seeks his own experience and experience the same God in the same power and that's why when we come together when we talk about these things it's not so much we it says lifting God in out of History lifting him up out of whatever he's done and bringing him into your situation bringing him into your problem where you are to bring you to the understanding that the same God is here to do the same thing a new generation I came across my my the Wilderness the Wilderness mentality my they could talk about the great God yeah and in fact on the testimony on the sea he says that we'll talk and it will sit there in the beginning of the dog it says what done it for you he says my mother told me about God the god of our father in the Old Testament how did he Reign Mana from heaven and it says I asked him I said well how did he do it does it mean Jehovah has oven up there and and things up there how did he do even in the New Testament when he took bread he said does it mean he has often out their way he would take the bread and bake it and then cut it down and run it down he said no Jehovah is a creator what was he doing he was building memorial but as they begin to tell those testimonies he says I heard what my parents says but when I saw him do it when I saw it with my own ass that settles it and my brother my sister don't settle on the stories don't settle on the stories don't settle on what this one says that one says that's wonderful to to comfort you but let that story becomes a reality for you without that we're just building up building up our own houses we're building up our own memorial the memorial of God is built by individuals that God himself has touched that's why the prophet could say it says what is the the the what is the new birth he says it's Jesus Christ reveal himself to you personally why because then he becomes a memorial you know we could have received what we deserved we could have received what we deserve but oh God is rich in Mercy he came even when you were in your sin when you knew if we right now for everything I've done I deserve to die when you knew within yourself that I don't deserve anything good but yet for his goodness but why did he do that I become a slave of his goodness it doesn't matter how down somebody is because I'm slave to his goodness all I could do is tell of his goodness you know you don't have to be like that you're like oh you don't understand my situation I'm worse off I'm gone and everything it says well I was gone too but I met a god but I met someone who can take you out of your situation I met somebody who can stabilize you I meant someone who can come and take all of your mess all that you've messed up everything that you've destroyed he takes all of that and he makes sense of it now I want you to realize this Memorial of Joshua was not built when everything was come and peaceful and nice Where the River Jordan was all the way down no when it was overflooded Our Testimony is it's not something well you know one day I was just asleep and and then I just woke up and the sun rose up just a different way anyway was shining on the trees it just seemed a little different then I knew God was calling me you were running you were running you were trying to hide he was a hunting for you it was hunting for you in fact he made your life so miserable you looked you said God I come he kept dragging you after whatever hold you were in already I I hear testimonies even myself I remember I said if I don't do this I'm gonna die invite the next word that comes out of your mouth is death you're like I don't even understand what I'm saying but that's what he had to do it's not you you've studied a Bible and you've come to some conclusion that Jesus Christ is the Son of God then I'll give my life to you there have been people baptized in the midnight one a.m 2 A.M in the morning what's wrong God is moving upon them and that same God is here the same brother as well sister I'm not talking about this so we can just say praise God for the past I want us to build a memorial within our own self to come to the place as we heard it this morning where our hearts is on fire when we come to a place it says I want every day that I walk up the same manifestation of this God of what he did what he promised I want my life to be a memorial of those things not the messenger of Doom and Gloom not one that can perpetrate whatever is happening in the world you know in this book brother Barnum talks about having visited I believe it was New York it says he went on the Statue of Liberty and he says there was a lie there was there had been a storm and then he says but yet there was a bunch of dead Sparrow all across and he couldn't understand he asked what happened it says well what happened is there was a light when the storm came instead of the sparrow used the light for them to go hide The Sparrows were trying to put out the light so they keep beating themselves against the light until they're dead you can fight the word of God and survive people that criticize this they don't know what they're criticizing it's not made for them it says that he says he baby came insane now if someone all they put all of their efforts they have nothing else to do they sit there they just read the message read the message so they can find mistakes that's saying to him for Insanity to me all they do is trust trying to find what letter what scripture what word is not matching with that that's Insanity see to them it's insanity but towards his life why because we've seen the same thing happening with us he says in Joshua 24 verse 13 and it says and I have given you land which I had not labored oh I love this he says I have given you lamb land which thou did not labor and cities ye that that ye built not and ye dwelled in them and the vineyard and and Olive yard which that he had not planted yet not did not uh the which he planned it not that did eat it says now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity in church and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood in Egypt and serve the Lord in Deuteronomy 6 and 10 it says and it shall be that when the Lord thy God shall have brought you brought thee into the land which you swear unto thy father to Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give thee this great goodly land the goodly cities which thou build us not and a house full of good things which thou fill it not and and Wells digged which thou digest not Vineyard an olive tree which thou plenteth not it says when thou have eaten and be full then be where beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage what a promise houses we did not build Vineyard we did not plant what was it it was exactly what he promised that he would give them a land filled with milk and honey God himself promised that it was going to give them for the sake of time I'll just move on says he speaks about he says in Joshua now his word was at stake paragraph 21 just as Noah of old but Joshua must cross over this River and he looked like he picked the worst time that he could ever that could it could ever be that he could that it could ever be taught it was in the month of April and that's when the snow was melting in Judea coming down through the mountain and the old Jordan is Muddy and spread Plumbing out into it says into the field water filled of Jordan and you look like if it would have been the if it would have been if it would have been the mathematical of of Education or scientist he picked the worst time in all the years to cross in all the years across Jordan but God likes to take those kind of time to prove that is God foreign is built on God proving that is God it's not built upon you when you have worked so hard and then finally figured it out it's built on you looking and said I have ran out of all that I could do I have done all that I could it looks like it never worked then something happened you know for a fact that God did this it says and when man of God who believed God and know what God had promised has promised he's not afraid to do it because God will God will stick with his word just as certain as he is God and it says paragraph 22 and he says and when he said first take to your can go forward and when those priests feet touched that Jordan no matter how Wild she was and how she was swelling it would give way to God's Eternal Word it says for the word is in is in the ark Jesus says now Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so Joshua knowing that his word must rest upon God's word that's the secret his word must rest upon God's word and he put God's word first oh it says wish you sick people here tonight we'll do that put God's word with your confession put your confession it says you believe it and set it out there and call those things which are not as though they were when you are my it says then March then we are Marching on do it do it that way God's word will take you through it's not us making it through and I want to say this why it has to be the word of God because the word knows things that are to be because the word knows what's before what's to come remember but Matthew mentioned it this morning the the characteristic of the Prophet is a Seer is one who can see what's around the corner you can't he sees what's around the corner and therefore God's empowers him to give his people his word that the word that they believe will tell them ahead of time before the corner comes what's going to come around the corner my brother my sister we know what's around the corner we know what to expect that's going to happen in the world we know all of that and as far as the Bride of Jesus Christ we know what's around the corner we know that the Rapture will be here any minute we know the adoptions of sun is happening right now we know that's what's around the corner we don't have to worry about anything as long as it's God's word God will stand upon his word but what I'm says in this message the memorial it says oh let me just jump ahead because of time he talks about this young man from England who as well to build a bridge he talks about him it says now he came when when something that everybody had rejected was afraid to do he took it he says why because he had a reputation and he put his reputation on the line he says there are two things that were needed he had a reputation and he had a vision reputation and vision in other words Vision he can see before the bridge could be built how everything was going to lay out he had a purpose in doing that and whatever says that the same way that Jesus Christ when he came if he can if he didn't have a vision if he didn't know what somewhere in the corner if he cannot perform that which he has said then God is not God then his reputation is on the line he comes this young man he says oh I love it it says one place it says it came and he put his reputation and says they said well people from America great Engineers great Architects they've received this job he says but I will take it he came in he went the same place that they all went that he examined the river he looks at it and looked at it and said they all went to the same place they went down what they saw was sinned but what about him says he knew the way that God designed the Earth that underneath that sand there had to be a rock somewhere my father my sister he knew you that I don't care how much Cinder is if I continue to pump this sand out one day I'm gonna hit the rock somewhere in the bottle that's the same way it is with this message my word of my sister it's not built upon the shifting Sins Of Man the understanding of van or this or this that if you weren't in the Bible if you went and read it one day God is going to reveal it to yourself you're going to hit a rock and once you hit a rock you are stabilized forever people are built upon sayings explanations of man and they heard this greater art all right now believe all I must be here they're headed over here that must be in but remember the church is not built upon men's understanding when he looked at Peter he says up on this rock it it's always the rock it was the Rocket Jordan it was The Rock in the time of Jesus it's a rock in the same time behold I lay a rock a stumbling block and a rock of offense he was not offended in me he who believes that it is Upon This Rock what's a rock God choosing a man to reveal his word God using a man that he can come in this generation and turn his back against the audience and be accepted what is that that's the rock the Revelation is I looked at the man but I saw Jesus being manifested foreign the revelation of who God is to you not to the group but to you oh my I know I'm learning how a time but he talks about the other Memorial it says about Lot's wife now I thought it's very important I say this there's so many different things they said but just for the sake of time I'll just read few of them he says that wife started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome says that God used her as a memorial also the same way that the rocks that we just talked about in Joshua was a memorial there is another Memorial of Lot's wife it says it says she wanted to see what others in the world are doing she wanted to have her hair cut because she looked back at the memorial of disgrace who were greater it says and and she was a lady she wanted to be among the society in the city of Sodom and and of Gomorrah and Sodom Lord's wife was carnal and these are part of I I just took there's so much of them I didn't have time to take all of it she started to he says she stands today in the field there as a pill of salt as a disgrace to those who pass she wanted to have a last look Lord's wife she says in one place he says she merely looked it's like it's not like she turned God she merely it says oh my she merely looked she wanted to be in luxury it says one place her husband had had to become a great man in the city and and and the one in this message he says she was just trying to be sociable okay and I want to say that to us because it's very important we take this seriously we are called to for a different Memorial and the memorial that we are called to represent is cut us off of all those things we we can't be there and and still wants to keep our associations all of the likes uh following all the Instagrams and the the tick tocks and all of the the trains that's going on you know today it's one person standing on one foot tomorrow he has his shirt off and and all of that we're following now what Memorial are you really trying to represent you say well it's Christ but I still want to have fun the way the world is having fun you you go here but yet you you among people that are I'll tell you this you sit around with people that curse all the time you don't have to force it one day it's gonna come out of your mouth I speak my experience you don't have you stay among people that constantly negative negative or negative they're saying this one day you don't have to you don't even have to have learned it you automatically will display it you you stay around you you be sociable enough with the world oh you know we just go in we're gonna just go play basketball and yet they are you know saying all kinds of things and all of that and and it's getting in you you said well as long as I don't participate I don't say what they say I'm good you one day you'll find yourself repeating those same things and you're going to wonder what if you ever gone you went to a restaurant and said and ate you didn't even know what music was playing but one day out of nowhere your foot is moving you're like what's going on here and some tunes it's just out of it in the subconscious not in the conscience the moment your conscience catches it you look at your foot it's where you've been oh let's be careful of what Memorial we are presenting I'm saying this to encourage us so we know as our brother said this morning God has got everything under his control but what he wants us to do is to project the memorial that his place us here to do regardless of where I am I have to be mindful of what Memorial I'm bringing forth now Lord never thought he was going to end up in Sodom and Gomorrah when he left Abraham he didn't pick up because if that was his desire he could have just moved there but all he took was for him to just have his tent pointed towards that direction today he saw the fireworks the next day he saw some light shows he saw some things and all of a sudden it caught his attention and maybe three months later the tank moved a little bit and the tank moved a little bit and the tank moved a little bit and then all of a sudden he was a governor a mayor you don't have to go and say I decided to go in the world I decided to do all of this no it's the association if it keeps continuing it's okay why aren't you living in Victoria life you're too much trash too much Association my body my sister we are called but imagine you said it this morning we are called to whoop the devil to associate not to feel sorry for him we are called to kick the devil everywhere we need him oh I don't know about you I like I like to see him being chased and and I'd like to see him without a place I would like to see him out of all the children of God I want to cease deliverances heal it I want to see all of us I don't want to see the devil anywhere near the children of God but yet we are all God oh God and God is looking and says I've given you my word there is no better weapon I can give you than my word it's saying stand up clean yourself remember before they can go over Jordan that Joshua came in he said sanctify yourself this day get yourself ready the word of God is going before you but once the word of God is already pronounced I've given you the land we've been given the land why don't we have the landing man sanctification cutting off the things of the world well you know it's just a game you know it's just a football game it's just it's just a basketball game you know and and then before you know it's five hours in great achievement oh it's not sinful it's not you know it's lawful I'm not cursing I'm in fact I I I'm not even playing with other people if I was playing with other people you'll say you know but I'm just playing with myself or playing with my brother you know so it's just us kick out the trash get concentrated give your life to something oh I don't know about you I want to see God I don't want to see myself I don't want to hear myself I want to see God moving and it's not to him it's up to us I want to be a memorial I want if somebody called me and say brother we need you to come here and pray I want when I show up I am certain that all Heaven is with me I don't want to be one that was playing games and then they called me I go oh God oh God help me preaching that's what we do we are in complete destruction then when something happened oh we want the blood we want this I mean we want everything we want it right there no he wants us to be ready we are in a battle he wants you to be ready at all times I have given you the land it's a memorial when your children ask you as your son ever asked you your daughter ask you something you have no idea how to answer because you haven't been practicing that way daddy aren't we supposed to be praying all day yes hun but you know that he got a little bit busy something happening I want to be ready I want to run to it God what would you have me do what would you want me to do if he calls me or if he tells me now condemnation is always going to be there regardless of whether it's always going to be there but I don't want to be to have something that I have caused by my own hands I want to do what my part is and let God do his part like we say people that are Sanctified ready to take the battle ready to possess the land wherever it's needed people that are ready to speak the word if the musician could come foreign says God's Building and God is building a memorial is God is building a church as a memorial a memorial of the feast sacrifice Christ never come to Earth paragraph 35 Christ never come to Earth to die in vain his death will not be in vain God's able for these stones to raid to rise children of Abraham if people won't live it they won't take it into under consider under consideration and realize what a great gift God is giving them God's is able of this stones to rise to raise children of Abraham truly he will do that so I say today Brothers the things to do is the word is the things to do it says the words that you say paragraph 31 how you you treat your brother what you do about Christ will be an everlasting Memorial you might you might have a fine home to live in to live to your children you might have you might have been working for some livelihood to live to your children but I'd rather leave them the word of God than anything else those houses will vanish that's perfectly right it says that's perfect you're right that's good I have nothing against it but don't do those minor things and leave the great things undone you see because the word that says the word it will it says the house will perish the people will perish with it but God's word but the word of God will will raise them up in the last day and give them an eternal and immortal life again examine your own memorial remember it consists of what you do your works not what you say and I'm not saying this in condemnation so to say you don't have it you don't have it I said it's been given to us to do it the scripture says to them it's not given but to you it's given when something is given it means it's yours to possess to exercise when something has been given to you it means it's in your power in your Authority casting out devil is not something we need to say oh God we need you to go do it no it's something that's been given to you if you sanctify yourself if you get yourself ready if you kick out the trash you have the authority to perform the work in fact it says one place oh I love it it says you speak the word and then he says the holy spirit is the enforcer he takes the word and he runs through the devil and says get out of here why because the owner is calling for it amen it's Austin oh I say away he said he had a vision before a man can make a repetition he has to have a vision of what he's doing oh blessed be the Lord that's the reason he says you are it says there are they they are in heaven there's in heaven to go to that's the reason we can have a reputation as a Christian we know what material is in the building that's right the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ is in the building that's right he's stained the blood has washed away all sins he took me from the alley of hell and made me a servant then I believe in him so I passed from Death To Life and every believer has done as did that because he asked they because that they had to go that they that they got confidence and they believe in the great Builder in the in this great architect the process it says paragraph 43 says now when the man did this the first thing that it did to be sure that he was right he went down and he said now before we get the breach to start started we got to go to the solid foundation we've got to go we've got to go he knew that down beneath the sand the breast of the Earth was was there which was a solid rock what did he do what did he do but get the great big pump and got it up and got in there and set the great tube down there down and he blew and shifted the shifted sand and this prompts until it blewed it up down to the solid rock when it got when he when he got her on the solid on the Rock he anchored this great big bolt in there and got it ready it says in the blueed all it brought out each one oh I said let us go through that solid foundation tonight and say God I don't want to build on the shifting Sands of men and today I'm happy tomorrow I'm sad and each each week behold is here I'm here behold is there no I want that Solid Rock I want that rock that came out of Jordan I want to have one that I could take for myself and I could set it there if my family my children if anybody asks me what is this I could say this is the memorial of what God did for me why because we are living rocks we are living memorials that has to go to a building let us bow our head our gracious father we're so thankful Lord and father to know that we are those that are called to be a memorial father is such a humbling experience to know that you have chosen man and you've elected man and you've placed him for them to come and that you can use the body their flesh the human being that you can comment the same person the same flesh that we've seen but yet out of it that God can come and manifest himself and and he's elect will be able to see and know that God is being manifested behind his flesh and you've done it for each and every elected one of your children Lord father we pray that you help us be the best Memorial that we can Lord father forgive our shortcomings and what we've fallen short and father strengthen us tonight let your word be a memorial to our heart and that we may not be built upon the intellect of men but upon the word of God that abideth forever Lord we commit everything to you we thank you and we ask that you be with us tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen oh and I what you want for me [Music] oh what you want for me [Music] what you want just singing again it's better Matthew comes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] what you want is what he wants for you I so enjoyed the word tonight I was inspired amen have you been inspired have you been fed today amen I uh my heart just rung with joy as our brother started to speak about how uh we we always want to be in a position where we're ready and it just it come to my my heart as he was talking about that you know when when the prophet would preach the token I believe he preaches the token September 1st 1963 he preaches the token and what a glorious message I believe even the prophet Mitch that's like one of the uh one of the capping or it was one of the his great messages and and you know what he preaches that evening preaches desperation if you want the token if you want the token life if you want an everlasting Memorial if you want Christ the Everlasting Memorial if you want to be a Lively Stone we got to get into desperation but but sadly you know the brother Brandon talks about how we're we're so slothful and dilatory it takes tragedy or it takes trial it takes things to get us into a place of desperation but as our brother was ministering I don't I don't want it to have to take tragedy and all of a sudden you know the call comes across the line like our brother was saying and also I'm like oh my goodness Lord uh clean me up sanctify me I'm I'm unworthy to go pray for that brother I may I ain't able to run over the airplane and you're you're going approaching uh the situation and you're not praying for them you're praying for yourself you're like oh God forgive me Lord I I just wasted all this time and I should have been seeking your face Lord and and Lord just just and and and you're you're having to battle battle and fight through all that but oh God's wanting a bride to come to a place of maturity uh this Everlasting Memorial to where you're so in tune and so in harmony with the Lord that you if I could say it this way you're in desperation every day for God to speak to you oh the prophet was so sensitive and in tune that just even even the wind may be blowing across he'd say Lord is that you I want to be in position I I want to be I want to sanctify and be ready uh yeah at any moment Lord you can call on me oh wouldn't that beautiful in Everlasting Memorial my it wasn't that uh just so perfect key of f well there's no one There's No One Like Jesus oh there's no one

utilize that time thank God what would you have me to do but have been a while if you could dismiss us in prayer the sparrow Hearts gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful to hear what it
