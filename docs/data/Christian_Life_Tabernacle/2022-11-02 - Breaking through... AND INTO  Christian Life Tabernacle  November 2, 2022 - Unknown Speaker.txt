testify that God found you in your time of need regardless of the obstacle regardless of what you are facing it seemed like it was impossible but God knew how to come through and Pierce through the darkness pierced through the muck and mire and to bring you out when it looked like you couldn't be brought out Hallelujah there was a savior there was a redeemer there was one that loved you and cared for you and could do for you what no one else could do aren't you thankful that we serve a God that's able tonight he's a God that's able to meet you in your time of need no matter how dark and how impossible it seems there's a God who loves you there's a God who cares for you if it's sickness unbelief you're here tonight and I believe God has something specific that he wants to speak to you let's just go before him in prayer Heavenly Father you are the god that fights for us you're the god that cares so much so Lord that while we were yet sinners you died for us no greater love than this would be that a man would lay down his own life for another Lord not only did you do that Lord you took our sin upon your back and you climb that Hill called gagafa they put you to an open shame you were beaten you were spitting your body it was tore open you were in such Agony of a broken heart that your your blood and the water separated within you to think that you did that for me Lord you did that for each one that's gathered together here tonight that we could be forgiven oh God I don't want that Christ to go paid in vain Lord I want to take full benefit tonight Lord I plead the precious shed blood of Jesus Christ tonight Lord for all of our sins and all of our iniquity Lord not only Lord that but there's power in the blood there's power to be changed there's power to be healed there's power to be delivered Lord so we're asking that you would come in a mighty way tonight Lord and that you would take control father may you just take this vessel Lord I Surrender it to you Lord that your Holy Spirit would come and rightly divide the word of Truth now you would break the bread of life to your children and as only you can we love you Lord we're thankful to you and ask all these things in your name the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] and praise His wonderful name if you have your Bibles we'll be reading out of Isaiah 42 verse 5. can y'all hear me okay I don't know if I can hear myself as well if they can just give me a touch more on the monitor if it gets a little too much we can let you know but Isaiah 42 Amanda did Annie make it in I believe I heard that she was able to make it we had a visitor coming and just wanted to make her welcome just glad you could make it out to the house of God just pray the Lord would be your portion where are you at her there you are God bless you we're happy you're you're here may God be your portion it's just wonderful to see people still hungering and thirsting for God and I'm just thankful that if there's something in you that is hungering and thirsting for more that means there's more for you amen and that's what we're praying tonight that God would be your portion just reading out of Isaiah chapter 42 verse 5. it would read like this thus saith God the Lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the Earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and the spirit to them that walk therein I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles you can take that down just a little bit there but I sure like it and as we just continue to read there to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house I am the Lord that is my name I like that right there if there's any question what the name of the Lord is I am the Lord that is my name and my glory will I not give to another neither am I praise to engraven images amen we just ask a blessing upon the word you may have your seats just like to read this quote to lay a foundation here the prophet of God would say this there is a man here that can turn on the light he would say now I believe that the son and so forth was already in existence I believe the moon as it goes on Genesis 3 to explain it but I believe that what was here that the world was going was going to use it and therefore and it moved in and there was a fog and a Mist all over the Earth making it dark and God said let there be light so notice what the prophet is saying he say look the Sun and the Moon and everything was in existence but there was something that was covering over the Earth and now God said let there be light and the Darkness faded away and there was a cloudless sky and I believe that's God's way of doing things in the Bible the next verse says and he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day in the darkness he called night and God's word always separates light from Darkness see it's the word that does the separating see light from Darkness see if you want to if there's going to be a separation in the hour that we're living and it's going to have to come by the word of God it's not going to come through Creed it's not going to come through denominations it's not going to come through man's way of thinking because all of those things will be mixed with the darkness but God sent a word a true word to separate the light from the darkness he says that God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything I like that when he gets ready to use anything that means anybody any person anything when God ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything like he God got ready to use this old star or whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he separates light from the darkness so you might wonder what's going on in your life and you might wonder what why it just seems like things maybe are going haywire and why why your life seems so hectic maybe it's because God is separating the light from the dark Darkness as a child of God when God gets ready to use you if there's things that in your life that shouldn't be there if you're if you're paying attention to things and you're caught up with some boy or you're caught up with some girl or you're in some career or something that's that's not the will of God for your life you'll find out that the word is going to come forth and it's going to start to cause a separation in your life and at the first you might not be aware of what's going on but God is wanting to use you God is calling to you he's wanting to call you away from the darkness because you're not of the darkness you're of the light and so his word is coming to you look I want you to come out of there come away from those things you don't belong there that's not what you're a part of you aren't called to that but I've called you to something great or I've called you to something more and the scripture says he that half an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches praise God that God had given you something to be able to hear that word of God that is being spoken it might not be a be for you to be able to articulate that ate it that way you might not even know it is the word of God out that something is calling upon your life and it's moving you in a certain way it's moving you in a certain direction where maybe your friends and your colleagues they are comfortable doing the things that they do and they call themselves Christians and they go to this church over here and and they go to this over there and they're fine with their lives and you look at their life and say how can they call themselves a Christian but they go to the movie house and they dress the way they do and something in your heart is saying God there has to be a better way there has to be something more that is God working in your life because he's showing look there's something better there's another way and I'm going to separate you out from amongst those things and the word comes to you to separate you from the darkness he says light comes by God remember the light come by his spoken word the word of God said let there be light when there was no light and he sent the light to separate the darkness from the light this word of command cleared the sky so the sun could shine and his word today is what clears back all of the atmosphere of unbelief and his word today is what clears back all the atmosphere of unbelief well does anybody want the atmosphere of unbelief cleared back I say oh God I want the atmosphere of unbelief cleared away from my life well what is it going to come by it's going to come by the word of God not by what you think the word of God is Not By You interpreting the word of God but it's going to come by the unadulterated word of God and God has a provided way in the end time an end-time message that God has sent to clear away all of the unbelief and to separate you which is the light right he's the father of lights and ye are the light of the world so God has sent a word to separate you from the darkness so you can be the light of the world and his word today is what clears back all the atmospheres of unbelief you know as you think about the atmosphere as you think of unbelief and how brother Branham here he's speaking about how there was the sun it was shining but there was something that was in between the earth there was a fog or there was this Haze the world was in a chaotic time and there was something blocking the Sun from shining upon the Earth you know if you you tried to imagine maybe what that looked like I don't know maybe some of you have ever been on an airplane ride and you know you're coming into your final destination and maybe you're cruising at 30 000 35 000 feet man it's just well the sky is clear blue and the sun is shining like man it's gonna be a beautiful day and that Captain comes on and says please uh fasten your seat belts uh flight attendants prepare to land and all of a sudden they start to lower their altitude and you start to come down and the further you come down all of a sudden you start to ascend and all sudden there's you're coming into the clouds and you're like okay maybe it's not a clear blue sky like I thought it was and you start to lower down in just in just a few seconds time all of a sudden you're down and all of a sudden it's dark and it's gloomy and it's raining and you get lower down and you start to think what just happened I I thought I was cruising in for a a great vacation with sunshine and and no clouds in the air but just in a moment your Vantage Point and what you perceived there where the Sun was shining in all of its Glory there was a clear blue sky but as you descended through the clouds all of a sudden as you come down for landing there is something that is blocking the sun it's no longer shining and you come into an atmosphere or into a condition where it's cold and it's raining and the sun isn't shining you get down and you're like my whatever happened to the sunshine but I just want to say that if if you could ever get back and mount up with wings like an eagle if you could say if you could ever get back in the airplane I want to say that the sun is still up there it's still shining in all of its Glory but there's just something that has gotten in the way of the sunshine there's something that has gotten between you and the sun it doesn't mean that the sun's gone it doesn't mean God's gone it doesn't mean that God doesn't love you but you've come into a situation you've come into an atmosphere something has taken place that's gotten in the way and it's caused a storm in your life and if you could ever just break through those clouds if you could just ever break back through that atmosphere you'll find the sun is shining just the same as it always has and maybe that's what I want to speak to you a little bit tonight on is breaking through and into breaking through and into you know it's one thing to break through it's one thing to break out but you want to have a reason why you're doing it or once you've accomplished it there needs to be a next step or a next phase to what you're doing you know a breakthrough is an instance of passing through a barrier it's an act of moving through or Beyond an obstacle so just in speaking to you a little bit about breaking through and then two it's an instance of passing through a barrier this is the definition by Webster an instance of passing through a barrier an act of moving through or Beyond an obstacle now as I was just thinking about this it reminded me of we had a little gathering at our house over the weekend and uh something we we do for the The Homeschool families and the homeschool uh moms and the kids and and my wife worked really hard on putting together what they call an escape room how many people in here have ever done an escape room well I'm missing some hands that should be up how many have you ever done an escape room yeah a few people have done it they've they're it's called an escape room where where they they have a like a story line and and your objection is your objective is as you go into this room or this building and there's going to be a theme or a story for you and and you and you go in there and they're going to give you uh uh you're gonna have to get out of this room and there's you got to find Clues and you got to find uh the answers to these these Clues and these questions and those answers will give you how to unlock the the lock on the box and you unlock the box and then you look in there and you find it's another clue and it points you to go over uh to this side of the room and and you're looking over here and the whole goal of of the escape room is you're trying to find all of the clues and you're trying to find all of the things to escape out of the room but but I want to tell you that that when you go into this there has to be some type of intelligence to help you get out of the escape room if there isn't an intelligence there to give you Clues if there isn't something there to guide you in a certain direction then you would sit there and wonder what am I supposed to do next I tell you good thing it's a group effort because I would never make it out you know but but but but but I want to say man you're not on your own this is a group effort you know if you can't solve the problem or I tell you God gots the problem solved and God will use your brothers and sisters if you're in a time of need and you've got a situation that you feel like you can't get out and you've gotten on your knees and you've prayed and you just don't know what to do why don't you go and call on some of your brothers and sisters and say you know what I'm in a situation I feel like I can't get out I want to tell you there's power in prayer and there's power in the body of Christ that if you'll come together with your brothers and sisters and you'll start to pray and you'll come in a Unity of faith and say you know what this might be a problem but my God's bigger than the problem my God can solve this problem and you find you rally yourself together and you start to call on God and watch the power of God come down in the room and you'll break you out of that situation oh I want to tell you he's the same yesterday today and forever the Saints what were they doing they were praying for Peter one day he was locked up and he was Shackled up and they were praying praying for him praying for him and also what happened their prayers were answered and also there's a they were so amazed that God answered their prayer they thought it was a ghost at the door but he's the same God today I don't care what you're going through if it's healing you need God's here to heal you if there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's here to heal you but you would never be able to escape out of that room unless there was an intelligence that's there dropping Clues to you if there was somebody there yeah here you got a problem in front of you but then there's like a riddle it says you'll never be left behind but look up the answer is always right don't look down but just look up and all of a sudden you realize what is that talking about and then you realize it's a directional lock okay that's what it's saying if I'm baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if I Repent of my sins right it's a clue it's a hit hey if you want to get out of the condition you're I'm dropping a clue and it hits along the way that if you'll just follow the intelligence that's in the room oh it reminds me of that time that brother Brandon was with brother woods and and they were wanting to go hunting and he said oh he told brother Ben well you know the guy's an Infidel but but he got so tired he gots a lot of land out there and we'll go on down there and we'll hunt there a little bit and he got uh brother Woods got out of the truck and he started talking to the the brother said oh yeah we're just uh wondering if we could we could hunt a little bit on your property oh yeah we only got a hundred or so Acres you know help yourself go on going out and have yourself well he goes well brother would say well I got I got my pastor with me you know he likes to hunt the old Infidel looked at brother wood said pastor don't tell me you've got so low down that you've got to carry around a preacher with you anymore and brother Randall said well I thought about that time I better get on out of the truck so he gets out of the truck and he kind of walked up there and you know they had been hunting and sleeping on the ground and been been out in the woods and and he was dirty had squirrel blood all over him and his his Whiskers was long and and the old Infidel it started to go they they said said a few things he's like yeah you know I don't care much for preachers because they don't know what they're talking about you know I like to I like to I like to talk to a man that knows what he's talking about he said but there is one preacher you know I'd like to talk to a little bit he said you know our old neighbor up the hill there you know she was so sick we had to go up there and change the bed bedding and the bed sheets for her and give her the bed pad and everything and my she was just nigh unto death and we had to we had to take care of her night and day but you know one night I thought the Salvation was a a army was up there and I thought she had done died or something and I ran out up the hill to come find out she was eating she was eating apple pie and the next day she had so much strength she was doing the neighbor's laundry she was cooking for the neighbors and I tell you if I had to get the chance I'd like to talk to that preacher that's the only one I'd like to talk about you know and I just love you know you can learn a lot if you just sit down and listen to the intelligence there wasn't a boast there wasn't this approach yeah yeah yeah yeah oh is that right huh will you mind if I have an apple pick up the old Apple the WASP starting to eat the apples and goes you know I want to ask you a question the apples have started falling off the tree you know and we haven't even had a cool spell why is that he said oh you know the only Infidel said well I will you know if if if if if the sap you know the life of the tree doesn't go it's gone down in The Roots if it stays in the trail die you see yeah uh-huh yeah but there hasn't there hasn't been any cool spell or anything like that what what what what told it to do that he said if you put a bucket of water out on the fence post it ain't gonna run down the fence post and come back up in the springtime and he started to point the old Infidel to an intelligence and he started to say look there's an intelligence Hallelujah there's an intelligence that tells the life that's in the apple tree when to go down into the roots and you start running that intelligence through nature what tells that old duck that's out there on that pond in the North Country just out of nowhere all of a sudden one specific duck all of a sudden he rises up and he starts to to go around in a circle and he starts to call to the rest of the duck and say it's time to head south for the winter there's an intelligence that is telling that duck what to do the salmon they have spawning grounds and then they go out for years and then there's an intelligence that tells that salmon that has never been where it's going could you imagine navigating the the lakes and the rivers and going Upstream through all of the effort and all the time and it has to go right back to the place that it was born because there's an intelligence telling that salmon you're gonna go back to the same place that you were birthed and the prophet could stand there and say I want to tell you something you said you want to ask that preacher a question how that he knew about that woman's life the same intelligence that tells that the life and that apple tree to go down in The Roots is the same intelligence that told me to go lay a handkerchief on that woman and she would be healed he said you're that preacher he said yes I'm that preacher and he led that old Infidel right there under that apple tree to the Lord I want to tell you that's the same intelligence that's brought you to the house of God tonight on a Wednesday night it's the same intelligence that's been dropping you Clues your whole life and in your problems and your situations you thought there was no way out but God he was the intelligence looking out over your life he's the one that stopped that car over there he's the one that stopped you from being killed he's the one that stopped you from being imprisoned your whole life he's the one that stopped you from oding on drugs he's the one that brought you out of the prison house why because he's the intelligence that's been looking out over your life oh I want to tell you my daughter's real he's here what do you got need of tonight look we're talking all about breaking through and in two I don't just want to be set free I want to say Lord God why did you set me free I don't just want to be Sanctified I want to be filled with the Holy Ghost and if I've been filled with the Holy Ghost Lord what do you want me to do with the Holy Ghost yeah the devil's here he wants to challenge you and he wants to try to tell you there's nothing to the message and there's nothing to the word of God well since we're on the subject of infidel I like this other one you know this old Infidel he was challenging the Church of God he was saying well you say God's A Healer you say God's word is true I challenge any of you to come up here and drink this boric acid the Bible says if you drink any deadly thing it will not harm you so who of you will come up and drink this boric acid well they said well the Bible says you shouldn't tempt the Lord thy God the old Infidel would sit there and say okay yeah I guess I shouldn't tempt and ask him for anything then and just kind of was making fun of them Christians and this this all uh uh uh uh oh hit boy just from the back there he had cover overalls on and his hair all in his face and it was kind of long and shagging down his neck and he walked up there to the front in his little overalls and that only if it says what do you want he reached in his pocket and he pulled out an apple pulled out a knife and he started to carve the Apple he said I said old sap what do you want he said well I want to ask you a question he goes well hurry up he said hold on I got time he was carving that good old Apple and he got it all down and poured out and he popped that old Apple into his mouth is chewing on and he said well I got a question for you he goes well hurry it up he goes is this apple sweet or sour is that lying got a clue I'm not the one eating it and he said that's what I thought and he turned around and went and sat down I don't care other people can tell you that God's not real but they're not the ones eating it I've tasted and I see that the Lord is good my sins have been forgiven I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb I've been filled with the Holy Ghost you come way too late to tell me that my God is not real so are you going to let the devil try to rob you from the promises of God why are you going to let them tell you that you're going to come short of the message of the hour why are you just going to come up so far and then settle for that and say I'm not good enough no God has there's been an intelligence that has been guiding you your whole life to bring you into the revealed word of the hour not to just break you out of denominational unbelief not to just break you out of sin but to break you into the very intelligence and the mind of God to bring you into the fullness of the stature of a perfect man that you might come in a union with a Capstone that is descended in the end times saying Christ Grace Grace I'm talking about breaking out and in two breaking breaking through and in two look we know we're living in in one of the worst ages that man has ever known you know it's Timothy he would write about it and say in the last days there will be perilous times man will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God do you see it children will be disobedient to pass they'll be a truce Breakers despising doers of good they're they're they're they're lovers of evil it's it's a world that of wickedness but then God what has he done he sent a word there had to be something that would come and separate the light from the darkness and if you are the light of the world then God has sent something to separate you away from the darkness just like the scripture would read there in Isaiah would say for behold Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee in his glory shall be seen upon you look we know the world is one of the most chaotic times it's ever seen and we can mention these things every every service and no doubt it just seems as the world keeps getting worse and worse but we know that we're not not only are we living in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness we're standing in the Most Blessed light that we ever did Shine sure we can see the weakness wickedness all around us it doesn't take you long to realize that mankind has sunk into a loathe that has never been seen before and they've been given over to a reprobate mind they've believed a strong delusion and now a common sense has escaped them to where you know maybe it's not good to say this over the pulpit but you know I've been I heard I heard a statement said you know it's impossible to to to it says it's hard to win an argument with a smart person but it well I'll substitute a word a bit but it's impossible to to win an argument with somebody that's ignorant they have no ability to reason you can tell somebody facts but they're so in such a strong delusion to politics and the things of the world that they deny basic biology they deny two plus two equals four and so you realize that this is the product of the age that we're living in but while we're living in a time that's so chaotic we're living in a time where the most blessed life ever did Shine remember his word is what clears back all the atmospheres of unbelief so we're talking about breaking through the unbelief breaking through the sin that so easily besets us that we can break through into every single promise that God has for you I don't know about you but I believe we are living below our privileges as a believer that there has been a storehouse that has been opened up to us there's Promises of God that's been made available to us and if we don't allow the message of the hour to separate the darkness oh yes brothers and sisters we still need the message of the hour to separate the darkness and unbelief out of our lives this has to be a daily feeding this has to be a daily washing and it comes by the water of the word it comes by the word that God has given us in the age that we're living in not an age gone by not a message gone by but God has sent a Vindicated word by a Vindicated prophet and it's by that word that the darkness is separated out of your life and if you don't stay under the messenger for the age then that Darkness will enter back into your life or don't tell me I'm crazy if you don't stay under the gods provided way of the hour and if you get so puffed up and you think you got it all figured and that's what's happened to men they've got a hold of the message and they've ran it and tried to tie all these quotes together and say this is what the prophet said this here and they've run out of the lamb and before they knew it the devil cut that limb off and they found themselves attached away away from the message and now they're not even Christians denying the very power of God Pat don't get Me puffed up that says oh God never take your hand off my life Lord let me stay true to you if I'm going to be the final voice to the final age let me stay right under the message of the hour Lord let me be taught let me be trained let me be tutored Lord let me stay with your provided way of the age because it's by that way we get out of here we have promises whosoever that in Mark 11 23 that whosoever shall say unto this mountain I'm talking about breaking through and into God has more for you that whosoever shall say to unto this mouth and be thou removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith if you say to this mountain what did the prophet of God said he said if you say to this off to this mountain he said I often wondered about that but if if you say he said that puts you back in the word this is something not to Pawn off to your neighbor this isn't something to Pawn off on the Prophet this isn't something to Pawn off on the days gone by but this is something for the believer to know that God has sent a word to break you out of a denominational way of thinking to break you out of the intelligence of a man to bring you into a place and a position to where under the word of the hour you can come into the promises of God where you can take that word and speak that word and watch it materialize before you I'm not talking about fanaticism I'm talking about the word of God that has been delivered to the Believers in the age that we're living in now I'm just foolish enough to believe what I've heard the prophet say is for me now remember what a forerunner is we spoke a little bit about what a forerunner is it's one who comes in advance to a place the rest are to follow so just like the sheath wave remember what the waving of the sheath was it was the first fruits of what was to come the waving of the Sheaf was taking the first fruit and it was way before the priest to say look this is what the rest of the seed in the field are going to be it was an Evidence it was a fruit to show what the word was going to produce and now here's a fullness of that word in the day that we're living in taking the promises of God and speaking squirrels into existence speaking to the storm taking the promised word if you say to this mountain and you believe and shall not doubt you shall have what you asked for and then what does God do he takes a forerunner he takes a first fruit to come to maturity and takes the very Word of Promise and brings it into manifestation so the rest of the wheat field can look and say that's what I'm going to be and you will not stop short of it because you are that seed word that God has planted in the field and nothing can stop you from coming to maturity nothing can stop you from coming to the maturity of the power that God placed inside the seed the only thing we need to do is lay in the presence of the Sun but I think that's the problem is some of us are not laying in the presence of the Sun we're laying in the presence of this ministry over here we're laying in the presence of this ministry over there we're looking for some Revival we're looking for something out there when God has given you the very thing to change your body and that is the message of the hour preached through the ministry of William Branham you can stand up here you can debate it you can tell me I'm in heretic but you're not the one eating the Apple I'm the one eating this Apple so don't tell me how it tastes because it tastes real good this message tastes better than anything I've ever come in contact with you want to give me some Baptist ideas some Methodist ideas give me some Pentecostalism so I can run around and shout and jump up and down and holler with no substance give me the revealed word of the hour introduce me to Jesus Christ then I'll run then I shall then I'll dance because I've been United with the bridegroom oh Hallelujah taste and see that the Lord is good Hallelujah glory to God we've seen one come into maturity that should excite you Church that's not a challenge it's a testimony of what you are it ain't for you to look up and say when we look at our heavenly father and say I can never be that he's looking back and saying no you're my son you're my daughter and all I am you are you are my very seed Gene word that I've planted and laid us here and I've given you everything that you have need of to come into the potentials that I placed inside of you or if that don't make you want to shout this apple tastes really good I think I want to take another bite of it don't tell me this message ain't good don't tell me this message ain't for me it changed my life what are you talking about brother Matthew you were born in the message no no look I wasn't born in the message there's only one way you can be bored in the message and that joy that we ain't like Nicodemus oh you know do I got to enter back into no sir there's only one way you can be born into the message is you got to be born again by the Holy Ghost you can't just say I'll I believe God's in a prophet that won't do you no good the Devils believe God that's in a prophet why because they met him on a number of occasions and they had to do what the man said but that's a testimony of what God is showing you that you're coming in to be don't tell me this message ain't really it's done too much for me it took me out of drugs it took me out of alcohol oh brother Matthew that was just a prayer of your parents well praise God there's a promise to our parents that's for sure I'll give them all the credit in the world I'm here you want to talk to a drug addict or talk to somebody that's broken through and come out of something you want to talk about somebody who's won the lottery are they going to be like oh you know my neighbor bought me the lottery ticket bummer look I'm just thankful that God chose me I'm thankful that God elected me I'm thankful God gave me believe in Paris I'm thankful he put me in the house of God with believing brothers and says I'm thankful for what the message of the hour has produced because it's life to me it's keeping me it's leading me it's guy to me and when I fall down oh thank God it picks me back up if you ever feel like you're down and out why don't you just turn on a tape why don't you just open up your Bible why don't you just get on your knees and pray because the devil wants to keep you away from the very thing that's ordained to pick you back up and put you into the position that you're called to be we have seen a star and have come to worship Him would you deny what Jesus said himself what the Bible itself speaks out which is Christ the anointed word question mark would you deny what Jesus said himself with the Bible itself speaks out which is Christ the anointed word and if the word abides in you then your the anointed person with the word he abide in me and my words in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you that's Christ in you anointing the word for this age whatever age they lived in God divided his word to ages and every time it come to that time the churches are all scrupled up and God anoints somebody sends it down and makes that word act just exactly the way he said it did that was a forerunner a sheath wave exactly and there's a word prophesied for this day God is waiting to find somebody it's not too unusual to that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to be a Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the unbeliever then you're the anointed person with the word I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these how he do because I go into the father that word is alive in a people I'm looking at a people that that promised word is alive and living in you because you are the anointed person of the word look this is your calling you are predestinated to it this ain't a time to back up this ain't a time to doubt you've heard the word that's been coming over the pulpit the pastor laboring on the two books and saying look that old life that was the The Book of Life that was a record of all your deeds and the things that you've done wrong you are now by the blood of Jesus Christ you have now been forgiven and you're Justified your name has been written on the Lamb's Book of Life you never did that in the first place you received an end-time message see why because how could you ever be able to come into the fullness of what God has promised for this age with your past hanging on your back you would never feel you had a chance or a capability but you see you got this mind up here that always wants to remind you of where you came from but you see God has no record of your sin here on Earth he has record where you were before the foundation of the world and that is his record to the church is he says I am the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world and I put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that is the record concerning you and you are predestinated to fulfill the message of the hour you're the chosen one you're the wheat field you're the one that got placed here to do it Oh Glory to God I'm so thankful that he chose me and he elected me and he called me he called my name what was it there was an intelligence over your life there was an intelligence keeping you you thought you were off somewhere there in Africa back in the bush never to be found but God was looking for you there was an intelligence over your life Hallelujah and if the word abides in you glory to God why can you not sin because the seed of God remaineth in you blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin Oh Glory to God you're blessed tonight you're blessed tonight the seed of God remains in you you cannot sin why because you're predestinated hallelujah oh brother Matthew you're getting off the word the word says yeah the word says I'm so glad I don't have to reason about it I'm just going to keep eating my Apple you can tell me it's sorry you can tell me it don't taste good you can keep challenging me I'm just going to keep enjoying it Hallelujah I'm going to keep listening I was fellowship with my brother the other day we were talking about some people they come around the message they feed on the message they know all about the prophet they they they they know things and then they try to bring up quote or this or that and I told my brother David look I said all my eggs are in this basket I'll go where this message takes me there ain't nothing out there that I want there ain't nothing out there the world got and if on the day of judgment I had to come down and say Lord I was trusting in the message of the hour to bring me safely through if that's going to be my hindrance if that's going to be the only fault that God has on me I'll take it because see that's not a fault it's a revelation that it's God's provided way in the end time just so much so just like the message that Noah brought there is only one way and it was to get on that boat and I don't want one foot in and one foot out I'm not a I'm not waiting to break out of this message oh just in case it doesn't work I want to go all the way in Noah show me the porch show me the depths show me the left side show me the bow take me up in the top note show me everything about this boat because I ain't getting off of this boat until the Lord tells me to and it's the same thing with this message God has put me on this boat and he's going to take me safely through until the body change and I ain't getting off you got to be sold out Church Lock Stock and Barrel but I think that's the problem some of us uh I'm not not in a not in a way to belittle but if I can say like this God give us a greater revelation of what this message is give us a greater revelation of what the son of man Ministry is I had a pastor tell me he wouldn't have made a mistake a pastor I have confidence in it wonderful man of God and I I believe God allows you to have experiences to really help train you and tutor you he said I would have never done it if I'd have really known who William Branham was and it stuck with me because I thought how all I could say is Lord reveal more to me reveal more to me I never want to come to the place where I got it figured out because when we do that we're in trouble but you are the anointed word that God has placed here we're breaking through and into the fullness of what God has promised to you in this age so we move a little further the prophet of God would say this and looking at the Unseen he says and they say that the plane struggles and shakes so we're we're trying to preach a little bit about breaking through and in two so we got to come to a place where we're breaking through something some of us were breaking through different things we're breaking through different struggles we're we're in different seasons in our life and they say that the plane struggles and Shakes and struggles and shakes while it's trying to get through that sound barrier until it seemed like the wings will tear off of it and the bolts will rip out of while it's going through that sound barrier but when once it gets beyond the sound barrier the sound barrier then its speed is unlimited it can just fly free and the church and you sitting here tonight oh you're struggling and struggling and God's pulling to you and showing you things if you can ever get past that sin barrier of unbelief then unlimited Revival will break out through the United States and everywhere if you can go beyond that sound barrier that sin barrier of unbelief oh is it true does it mean me could I be healed could I be saved could I be filled with the Holy Ghost get beyond that just keep struggling the struggle's okay as some would say the struggle's real you're struggling that's okay struggling struggling until you break through and the Holy Ghost comes upon you I'm telling you you're beyond it then and there's 50 miles of Elbow Room Oh Glory to God I want to say It's Time church that we break through you break through your complexes you break through your fears you break through your disappointments look God didn't save you to lose you he didn't bring you out to leave you out he didn't bring you out of all of that nonsense just to leave you sitting there you say preacher what are you talking about 15 miles of elbow you know I was thinking about that a little bit of what is 50 miles an hour you know I was thinking about the woman at the whale which she came in contact with the son of man and at first he looked and she saw a Jew but then when her heart was discerned Wendy when the Discerning of the thoughts of the tits of the heart came and then that seed was quickened it was and it was germinated she realized she was standing in the presence of the Messiah and I want to tell you she had 15 miles of Elbow Room her past didn't matter anymore her complexes didn't matter anymore her five husbands didn't matter anymore the man she was with didn't matter anymore all the people in the town didn't matter anymore she just went back said come see a man who's told me all the things that I've done I got 15 miles of the Elbow Room I'm just gonna tell you about the grace of God come see a man oh I wonder if there's somebody here who knows what 15 miles of Elmer room feels like when you've been born again and you've been set free and the burden of sin has been lifted off of you and you've been changed and you've been filled with the Holy Ghost and you become a new creature and Jesus Christ and all things have passed away and all things have become new and your mind has been changed your thinking's been changed your dressing's been changed everything has been changed you've been changed into Jesus Christ oh then you got 15 miles of Elbow Room Hallelujah does anybody knows what it feels like oh do you know what it is not to have one guilty feeling not to wonder where you're going when you die not afraid of the past not afraid of what tomorrow holds in store and know the reason why well that's just how it is when you go down in the water oh praise God you got 15 miles of Elbow Room to tell that Old Devil to shut up I know what I'm talking about it's a good apple no sir he didn't save you to lose you he didn't bring you out to leave you out foreign what's the obstacle what's the barrier what's holding you back our Tech said he's here to open the blind eyes to bring you out the prisoners out of the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house I want to say if you've ever been brought out of the prison house I want to tell you it feels good to come out behind them bars see brother Matthew you don't know what you're talking about let me just tell you it feels good to come out from being incarcerated because what's behind those bars is not a soft pillow it's not a soft mattress a bunch of stuff that you don't want to be a part of but when it comes your time and you finally come out on the other side you just don't come outside of those bars you know you you get out and you get on the on the outside you say well praise God I'm out and look turn around and tell the boys back in the bars it's good to be out guys well what you gonna do with your freedom it's good to be out guys no sir you get out and you start to think it's good to be Albert some home cooking sure sounds nice mom would you have me back come on home son dad can I come back I got a meal prepared The Prodigal son's returning see when you've come out he didn't bring you out just so you could be on the outside he brought you out for a purpose he says come on home son come on home Dad I got a home-cooked meal for you I got something more for you and all of a sudden you say you know what I'd like to have me some home cooking I'd like to have me a soft pillow I'd like to see me some friends I like to find myself back in the house of God why because you're breaking out of something and God is bringing you into something else I want to tell you if you want more of God there's more of God for you I like this quote we've used it a few times as we work towards the clothes and greater than Solomon is here he says if you that's just accepted Christ by justification accept him by sanctification and clean up your life and you're still smoking Watch What Happens how much different you look back to justification you who's just stand and Justified and never receive the baptism of the holy ghost step up into that sphere then look back down at the rest of it see just keep walking until after a while you get so light you just could walk on up in a rapture Oh Glory to God till after a while you get so light you could just walk on up in a Rapture talk about a breakthrough just keep walking Church just keep walking just take another step Enoch Enoch walked with God and was not keep on walking Brad just keep on stepping just keep on going because what are you doing you're walking right into the change of your body you know the prophet of God said it'll be the regular routine of following scriptures that brings on the rapture it'll be the regular routine of you just listening to a message tape it'll be the regular routine of you going to the church sisters one day it'll be the regular teen of you just getting your kids ready for church bringing your kids to school it'll be the regular routine one day you'll be cooking supper and you'll turn around to say to say supper's writing all of a sudden whoa maybe mama is that you you're young again all of a sudden I'm telling you for it just keep walking just take another step I don't care where you're living maybe the devil's trying to say you're you're only living in a Justified State you're only living in a saint I don't care just take another step tonight if you know they that you're not living right then repent of your sins if you have not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's water right back your way just take another step because of one more step is going to be the change of your body Hallelujah in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're going to be gone God wants to take your life he wants to take your body he wants to take your season of life and he wants to take the message of the hour and bring it into your circumstance so that the word becomes a reality with where you're living so many people want to clean their life up to come to God I've ran into it all the time people say well I'm not ready yet to meet God well what are you going to do you want to take a bath I'm clean now God some of them it's just an excuse because they're not ready to walk away from their sinful way of living they know there's still sin in their heart and they're still things in the world that they're attracted to and it doesn't have to be evil things like the Rich Young Ruler one thing now lackest sell all they have you say you've kept all the Commandments sell all I have and follow me see some of us aren't willing to sell out some of us like some of the things some of our entertainments and some of our apps and some of our social medias and some of our Comforts of of when we come home from a hard days of work and and and maybe when we're when the pressure's coming on there's a few things that we kind of just use for for to to take off the pressure but I'm wanting to tell you God wants to be that one if you let him Church Christ wants to be the one if you give them the first place I'm telling you you can break through and into all the blessings of God don't allow your weaknesses in your your situations to be the very thing that hinders you from going on with God to use your excuses and to use your past we've dealt with that in the pastor and the Ministries dealt with that on several occasions for you just to take God at his word what is in your hand I don't care what it is Moses yeah Moses you're going to go take over Egypt he didn't give him an artillery he didn't give him an army you know what he gave him hey Moses what's in your hand um um um stick okay we'll use that what's in your life what's in your hand brother oh well it's a broken family it's it's this it's that it's it's an illness it's a complex God says I'll take it whatever your problem whatever your situation whatever's in your hand I want to take your life I want to take your circumstances I want to take your problems and I want to prove to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if you say to this mountain I'm breaking you through and into the fullness of the word of God in your life not just in the prophet's life not just in a forerunner's life but in your life God wants to bring the past every single promise of God oh Church lay aside every weight if the musicians would come let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which so easily besets us let us run with patience the race that's set before us oh my musicians give me a few minutes I I want to work through this by God's grace maybe we'll just have five minutes before the musicians Strike Up This is narrow down I believe it's going to bless somebody well what is it that keeps us from walking in this Liberty what is it that keeps us from living a Victorious Life why do you keep going through cycles of ups and downs and feel like you can never break all the way through or why do you come and have breakthroughs and breakthroughs why do you have to come up for prayer and come up for prayer and go through a prayer line and go through a prayer line for the same thing over and over and over maybe you have a breakthrough but then you got to go for another breakthrough but I'm telling you there's a break there's a breakthrough where you can break through and then two you can go beyond you can go higher you can go deeper into something a perfect Faith a perfect word a word that's separating all the darkness out of your life why why do you keep struggling like that why why because Satan has access to your mind he has access to your thinking he has access to your pasting and he knows how to take these things and weave it into your mind and keep you from taking God at his word question brother Branham what shall we do something has settled over me that I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in white sand it was getting dark I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now I am as one groping and it's getting dark I couldn't find my way this dream has stayed with me since last fall now okay now I miss one grope in the dark I couldn't find my way he says uh my son Irvin and and wife uh my son Irvin and his wife are included in the dream now they are also in darkness we are in desperation I believe God will show you what it is and what is in our hearts now if we are wrong or have sinning places tell us we want to be right brother Randall says I don't know the lady but I just feel if if you're here lady that here is your trouble foreign Hallelujah you have let something happen to you that's made you nervous because you being in White Sands represents Purity and righteousness and you're just letting Satan pull one over on you now look the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword person even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit in the joints and marrows it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the word of God is the answer the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life and as we work through this quote that's what I'm wanting is the quickening power of God I want the Holy Ghost to come upon our lives and make this word live you know in the Bible that there was I believe a king he was he was going to go out and ask some some suse or something like that and the prophet had to say is there no bomb in Gilead why are you running to the things of the world why are you running to to these programs into all these situations and these doctors and these strings why why are you looking to the things of the world to to be the thing that gives you answers when when we have a storehouse full of the word of God that has every answer that you ever had need of that if you would just kneel in prayer and consult God there's a word that is a discerner of the thoughts and I say try God said oh God speak to me today put on a tape read your Bible press play call a brother I'll tell you God will speak to you she said something that settled over me that I just can't break through I don't know about you but is there somebody here who's ever felt they've come to a place where there's something that settled over you and you just feel like you can't break through yeah struggles with family or struggles in the church or struggles in your life listen to this now as we move through this quickly your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given right your dream proves by the interpretation that you are in White Sands everything is all right now if somebody can just take this from the Lord everything's all right it's you yourself nervous and you let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next and the next member and the first thing you're all fussing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something and upsets the other and the other and the other and the first thing you know the whole family is upset it's Satan stop doing that claim your god-given rights he says then if one member of the family rejoices you can go ahead and play something that way we'll close then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it so every one of the family tried to do that try each one of you children to help your papa and your mama mama helped Papa try to help your children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you are Christians you are born of the spirit of God you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think the wrong thing now I want to say we've received more than this just the interpretation of a dream now that was Deliverance for that lady but I want to say we've received more than just an interpretation of a dream let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus what do you say the quickening power has come to us to open the Seven Seals you've received more than just the interpretation of a dream it shall be light in the evening time look there's a man here there's a man here that can turn on the light and his name is Jesus there's a man here that could turn him by his name is Jesus [Music] look we are breaking through and into we're breaking out of our complexes we're breaking out of our bondage we're breaking out of denominational ways of thinking we're breaking out of the intelligence of men we're breaking out of false expectations we're breaking into the very Mind Of God we're breaking into the very Capstone this is an invisible Union between you and the Heavenly bridegroom we're breaking through into an atmosphere where all things are possible [Music] I love the story of Rahab you know she was a type of the Bride [Music] her situation was bad here she is a prostitute on the city wall and here comes a mighty Armory to destroy every inhabitant of the city [Music] but I just look upon that story and see God smiling down saying oh Joshua there's one of mine in there You Can't Kill Them All give them a token [Music] give him a token Joshua because I got plans for their life foreign s came tumbling down [Music] there was that Scarlet thread hanging out of the window Rahab was just happy to be delivered Ray I was happy to be saved she could say thank God for saving me thank you God for sparing me and my family God looked at it right happens at Old Rahab if you only knew what I had planned for your life I got more than justification for you I got more than sanctification for you come on Rahab you're gonna marry the general of my Army [Music] and I'm not going to stop there but you're gonna settle a town called Bethlehem the house of God's bread it'll be the bread place of the world rehab [Music] and out of you is going to come forth the very Messiah oh bride I've given you a token but I got much more planned for your life I didn't come to just justify I didn't come to only sanctify you I didn't come to only fill you with the Holy Ghost but I came to pray have you make you have a breakthrough and into all the promises of God that if you say to this mountain there will be such a Unity between me and you that it won't be you speaking it'll be me speaking you are my bride you are bone of that bone you are Flesh of My Flesh speak the word bride speak the word take another step take another step in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're gonna be changed Church let's all stand oh hallelujah praise His Wonderful Name Church why you've been predestinated to it [Music] you've been chosen to it this is the hour [Music] of adoption this is the

does not or foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's my brain praise [Music] now I just want to say this in closing [Music] claim your god-given rights [Music] God Justified you you have a right to be sanctified if you're living in sanctification you have a right not because of what you've done because of what he did to be filled with the Holy Ghost and if you've been hope filled with the Holy Ghost that you have a right to everything that's in the Promised Land [Music] it's it it's leading you to something it's an intelligence Church he just hasn't brought you this far and then to bring you to a place where all of a sudden you're like we've made it but there's more in store for the Bride of Jesus Christ and we haven't even scratched the surface Church you think about it in the prophet's message how Supernatural was the first pool how Supernatural was the second pool but see it was all building to something it was building to that third pool it was leading up to something and I love their how in Christ The Mystery of God revealed you remember there he he preaches Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he gets to the end there and he says oh you know if you'll notice you're being spiritual you you look for Spiritual things if you'll notice if you look at the clock it's two o'clock on the dot it's the end of the second pool the third pool is at hand what's the significance of two o'clock what are you talking about brother brother Brandon what do you mean if you're spiritual you watch for Spiritual things it's two o'clock it's the end of the second pool what what's the significance brother Brandon what's the significance what does he saying Christ is the mystery of God revealed what was it it was two o'clock in 1933 on the Ohio River that the pillar of fire came down and said as John the Baptist foran the first coming of Jesus Christ so shall your ministry forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ what was it it was now the third pull of your

think all our hearts are burning that way don't you feel that that he wants to take us to higher Heights and and glorious places but I I thought one of the things he said that was so oh set my heart on fire was that you've got to be all in you know what I mean you got to be sold out you've got to be all in and I hope that there's so many wonderful statements that were made but you're predestinated to it and I think that's one of the things that we don't really have been able to grasp is the benefits and the authority that comes with predestination [Music] amen if you could totally understand I mean Matthew labored on it that God's chosen you if he's chosen you for something higher he'll provide the grace he'll provide the the love the mercy and forgiveness to unshackle any chains or any weaknesses in your flesh or any complexes it's got to step up and accept it and tell that close that book and say Lord I really want it amen play us something else [Music] let me just sing this and we'll just give an opportunity and you don't have to come for prayer but if you feel prayer would help you maybe it's just a token that you want to stand before the Lord and say Lord I'm coming before you and I'm going to have the brothers pray for me and and because I I'm gonna I'm gonna break through tonight I'm going to accept the word that you've given me yes and I'm gonna let it Minister you might want the holy skulls you might want to be born again change your attitude the change of life the feeling of his presence dwelling in your heart and living with you day by day maybe you've been a little cold [Music] and you just been away from I mean you'd like to start reading your Bible again do you like to put on tape all I can say is you got to leave those things which are
