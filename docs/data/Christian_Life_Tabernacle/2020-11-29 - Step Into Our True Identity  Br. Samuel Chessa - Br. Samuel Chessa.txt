that we ask you to bless us this evening in the time of fellowship around your word father we're just so grateful for it we ask these things this evening in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen i don't i ain't preaching so he's doing the preaching so he's hooked up and as far as a handheld mic i'm not good at that so i'll talk louder amen i hope you can hear me amen when i make an effort to speak it sounds like i'm yelling or screaming or angry but i'm full of the joy of the lord tonight so we're grateful but anyway it's a real pleasure to meet her tonight uh have brother samuel with this one i went to zimbabwe back in the early 80s and his father was one of the first uh people there that i connected with that just came to have that same kindred spirit that i knew and and we always had a wonderful uh relationship and a few years ago samuel's father lost his life in a fishing accident and went on to be with the lord but i found out this afternoon that he was a preacher so i took advantage of it immediately so i just let him know he was going to preach here about a couple hours ago so sometimes brothers want three or four days in advance but he's a man after my own heart ready in season anything he's brother blessings youngest child and blessing had seven daughters before our brother was born right so i i can tell you i'll guarantee he's got character and so i i just i'm really happy to have him to speak to us tonight and it just makes me happy and in in my spirit so uh i'm just gonna let's just sing amazing grace and and have them come and minister to us amen i really believe you're going to enjoy it this evening amen his home countries in zimbabwe's here in school are you in school now or he's here in school amen so we're happy to have him this evening amen let's sing amazing grace as he comes amen [Music] like me [Music] was fine but now i see is [Music] is [Music] [Laughter] how precious [Music] my chains are gone hey yes uh [Music] is [Music] i'm here [Music] this evening amen just look to your neighbor and say welcome into the house of the lord with a smile on your face it's quite my honor and privilege to be standing in front of you this evening for sure brother david is full of surprises he just told me you're taking the service this evening he wasn't asking he told me so you know i told him i said one thing i like about you is you're straightforward you don't mince your words and then he said the first time when i came across him so if you know him pretty well you know he does not mean his words he goes straight to the point so uh without wasting much of your time let us open our books our bibles to the book of first peter chapter two the ninth verse first peter chapter two the ninth to the tenth verse it reads but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that you should show for the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy so we want to focus on verse 9 which says you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation amen let us open our bibles to the book of jeremiah chapter 1 verse 4 and 5. verse 4 reads then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou came his forth out of the womb i sanctify thee and i ordain thee a prophet unto the nations we'll open our bibles to one more scripture before we take our seats let's open uh our bibles to the book of ephesians chapter one verse four and 5. verse 4 reads according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will may the lord add blessings to the reading of his word we can take our seat in the book we were reading in uh first peter it is telling us that we are a chosen generation and a royal priesthood a holy nation and a peculiar people we are not a normal people tonight i'm not looking at a normal people but a chosen generation the lord has been um working with me on this subject that i'm planning to speak on which is uh stepping into our true identity you know i've been realizing and looking around as we see people are concerned about where they came from everyone wants to look where they came from everyone wants to know where their roots is people are going for dna tests wanting to see how much percentage i am of this how much percentage i am of that yeah there's nothing wrong with that it's because people are having a yearning to realize their true identity people are having a yearning they want to know where they came from it's because everyone wants to know because before you know where you're going you have to know where you are coming from but we thank god we don't have to look far to know where our true identity is we don't have to look far for us to know where we came from because the lord jesus christ told us in the word who we are amen we already know our true identity we know that we are a chosen generation we are a royal priesthood and as people are going around trying to find out who they really are people are being told go find out yourself go out there in the world and realize your true identity of who what you were supposed to be and now the devil is taking advantage of that he goes in and takes over the mental faculties of the people we know the devil is the god of this evil age yeah you know the pastor was preaching earlier on he owns the kingdoms he was trying to offer jesus the kingdom to say if you worship me i'll give this unto you and now satan is taking advantage of that people trying to find out who who they are and then that's when he slides in right there people now they're coming up with hideous things someone who is born a man they are now being told that you can change your identity you can be a woman if you want someone who is born a woman they are being told you can go change and become a man if you want why is because the devil has come in into the education system he has come in and he is polluting people's minds and this was not the original part that god had but we are not worried about that we don't go out to try and find ourselves or realize who we are because we already know god told jeremiah that before you were formed in the valley of your mother i had you i knew you i had you predestinated so we know we are the bride of christ we don't have to fear that we don't have to go out to try and find something else we just have to go and look what god had for us before the foundation of the world the true identity that he had for you and me before he placed us on this earth that's what we are supposed to and how do we do that we go by going straight into the word the word is like a mirror it shows us our true identity you see so we were predestinated predestinated means you were determined beforehand before you were even born god already has set out your identity he had already chosen you before you were even born so it is important for people to know who they are and not only in the physical realm or physical aspect but in the spiritual realm people it's important for people to realize their true identity because if you don't realize your true identity the devil is going to take advantage of you the devil you're gonna leave under your own privileges if you don't know who you are so it is very important that you and i this evening that any other day the more we read our word we can see who we are we can see where we came from and so that we can step into the true identity that god had for us so we are not afraid of the devil trying to point us at a different direction saying you can be that you can be this or the other but we know the author of our faith we know jesus christ is able to point us and show us who we really are you know many people especially young people when they are growing up you have you're so under pressure you are saying lord what do you bring me here on earth for but now the devil if you are not careful the devil will point you at something else you end up not knowing your real identity but if you approach god with the right attitude he is willing to show you where you came from so your true identity is not determined by where you came from where you were born does not determine where you came from it doesn't matter if your parents with drug addicts that doesn't determine your true identity but if you go back god will tell you that before the foundation of the world i had you on the back part of my mind he told job he said where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy where was that before the foundation of the world so where you were born has nothing to do with your true identity being born in an underprivileged family has nothing to do with your identity but if you just come back and look into the word and say lord what did you bring me on earth for lord whom am i he is willing to show you god is more than willing to show you who you are more than you are willing to find out because he wants to use you he wants to use me and that can only happen when we realize our true identity and your past does not determine your identity what you have done does not determine who you are because the devil is slick he is smart things that you done 10 15 years ago he's gonna point to that and say you see that that's who you are but you gotta show him and you say the bible tells me that i was forgiven his blood covers me so that is not me that was somebody else and the bible says you and i we were justified which means we never done it in the first place so the moment the devil shows you back in the past what you did you say that was not me that's attributable back to you you know the devil is so sleek he comes into our memory he uses memory as a great tool to fool you and me he makes you forget that jesus christ died for your sins he pardoned all of them he erased them not only erased but he does not remember i remember was hearing this other testimony this brother went to brother branham and he was saying he had repented years ago and he says every time i feel so condemned and every time i feel condemned i kneel down to pray to ask god for forgiveness for the things i've done brother branham said you know what when you kneel down that's the first time god is hearing that because he doesn't remember the moment you repent it's gone in the sea of forgetfulness but we find there are people who have long rods that are long enough to go and fish out what god cannot get and we are discouraging one another we ought not to do that when someone is trying to live a christian life someone trying to get rid of their past we are supposed to encourage them we are not supposed to keep on digging the things that they have let go of we try to keep on misconstruing their identity but that not ought to be like that because your past is your past it is gone if you come to christ he is able to give you a new future you remember the lady mary when she was there everyone taught her as a prostitute all the pharisees they called her a prostitute because of her current lifestyle because of what she had done because of her past and she has all she called she she thought she was a prostitute because of the life she was leaving but when she came to jesus and then she realized that he could give her a new identity that jesus could change her life then she came and she knelt down in tears and she she was done with that life and then god made her a candidate that was able to receive the holy ghost on the day of pentecost so it don't matter what you have done don't matter what sins you have committed or your life that you are living right now if you are only willing to let go and go to god he is willing to give you a new identity he is willing to forgive all of your sins he is willing to call you child because that's what he had in mind before the foundation of the world he called you a chosen generation a peculiar people a bride that doesn't have a spot or blemish why because you never done it in the first place so when next time the devil shows you something you say that was not me you did it because he fooled you into doing it amen so your past does not determine your identity your current life if you're not living right and you're willing to let it go that does not determine your identity either it doesn't matter what people call you what people call you has nothing to do with your identity but what god says about you that's what matters so if you are just humble enough to come to god and you say lord what do you say about me in your word lord i'm willing to take that identity he is willing to do that for you amen we read of rahab she was a city she was a city prostitute jericho people knew her as a prostitute but god had a different idea of her he wanted her to be in the lineage of jesus he wanted her to be called the grandmother of god but people taught her as a prostitute but then god came and brought the word of the day in in her gates and she was able to accept it and she was she she was willing to let go of her old life and god gave her a new identity instead of being a prostitute she was now being called the grandmother of jesus christ that's the identity that god had for her so this is a sign this is evidence to us that god is willing to give you a new identity your current life your past life has nothing to do with what god has in store for you with what god wants you to be doing you you go to god he will show you many times we think oh i should be a preacher or i should be a singer or i should do this and that in church i might i'm supposed to be a deacon you want maybe you are not called to do that if you go to god he will show you what you were supposed to some people are given attitude just just being nice kindness some people got to see the the light of the world of this day because of the how people treated them that's a calling that somebody else is calling hospitability someone else may see christ through you because of the way you handle yourself i had a testament i was talking to one brother the other day he was a he he was gone down and he was doing all sorts of drugs and everything and this brother his brother friend didn't even testify to him but he saw the life he was living he saw the life how his life was changed and he yearned for it and he said i want that you see the life that someone else was leaving there can be a calling leading someone to christ because because of that so if you approach god with the right attitude and you are willing for him to change you he is willing to do that and the moment you stand in your position he is able to do wonders with you so don't care what people say about you don't if what you think about yourself is not aligned with the word don't even think yourself about it like that take away what you think about yourself and take what god says about you that is the only identity that matters we read in the bible of a man called gideon gideon was at a thrashing flow and he was hiding harvest from the media night he was being a coward and we have no history in in the bible there's no way he tells us that gideon was a was a warrior or he was a soldier or any military training but he was right there he was threshing he was threshing of bali or whatever wheat he was working with and then when the media knights would come he would run off and try to hide their their harvest but then this one time the angel of the lord came unto him amen it says thou mighty man of valor it did not say gideon had never we we don't have any history of gideon winning any fight we don't have any history of gideon winning any battle but what did the angel of the lord come to him and say he says thou art mighty man of valor it did not say you coward that's what he was being there and in george's chapter 6 verse 11 he says and there came an angel of the lord that said and set under an oak which was in offer that pertained unto jewish the abyss right and his son gideon thrashed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the media knights and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valor why the angel was addressing him with his real identity amen the angel of the lord was addressing him with his true identity to what he really was he was not a coward as he thought of himself or as he showed himself to be and he was willing to accept that identity that god had for him and he was willing to step into that identity and we know he stopped being a coward and he got up and he accepted the true identity that god had for him and he walked into it and we know he had victory he brought victory to the whole children of israel why it's because this man decided he accepted the identity that god had for him he and he refused the identity that he thought himself as he was not a farmer or a coward but god called him a mighty man of valor and that's what he was so whatever the word of god tells you that you are you take it you accept it and you walk into it god has a work for you god has a job for you if you accept that identity he has for you amen also in the bible we read of a man called shamga he was also in the same situation that gideon was in after they have harvest the philistines would come in and then take all of their harvest away i'll read in um in the book of faith by experience 58 we'll start from paragraph 34 he says you know what shanghai begin to think you know i'm not a fighter but i'm a son of abraham i am the tribe and the lineage and i'm circumcised i know that my god still lives and there is a crisis at hand and the spirit of the lord come upon him and he jumped out there in the middle of the road you see shanghai realized that his father abraham had been given a promise and the promise said that york's seed shall possess the gates of the enemy so sham god realized that the word of his day that's what he told him and he was living under his own privileges after they have harvest the philistines would come in and steal all of it and his family was starving but then he said no it's now his time is time is up this is now a different case altogether i have lived under my own privileges for so long and then whilst he was standing there he looked into his blood he saw his veins and he saw that he was abraham's blood was flowing in it and he saw the word that said your seed shall possess all the gates of the enemy and he knew that word was going to take care of him he didn't care whatever that was coming for him because he knew that if he stand upon the word of god nothing can stand before him and you know what he took he took an ox god and he went his head is straight for those philistines and he slew 600 of them with with a weapon that's not even used in the military why is because he was standing on the word he looked at what the word said about him and he said and he looked himself he said i am a seed of abraham i am entitled to possess all the gates of the enemy because that word will take care of him he said i don't care if i don't have no military experience but i know if i stand in god's word is going to keep me that word that say i'll possess that's happening today and he went and he stood there and he got victory he killed all 600 philistines and he delivered his family from that so you and i if we do the same thing too if we stand upon the word of god god has the same reaction to his word god is bound by his word so if you come and you realize that you are also a seed of abraham you stand that same promise stands for you so you have the right to claim it to you and he says and any man that's here that's been circumcised by the spirit of god that's born again any of you people that's sick the devil is a bluff you rob you he'll pay your checks he'll do everything he can but don't you have to stand for it no longer you say i'm not a preacher but you are a christian he didn't know how to fight know nothing about faith but just step out anyhow so long you are a christian so long you accepted christ as your personal savior and you receive the holy ghost by virtue you are a child of abraham you are a seed of abraham that scripture applies to you so you just take that word and say lord this is me i'm a seed of abraham now i'm going to possess all the gates of my enemy you don't matter what enemy it is whether it is disease you go for it i tell you god is bound by his word he is able to come there and deliver you he's able to come and help you it might be a it it might be a different enemy of fear you come there stand on the word he's going to able to help you it might be an enemy of financial problems that don't matter it didn't specify which enemy says dicey shall possess the gaze of all the enemy so you come out right there and stand and you say lord your word is going to keep me god will never disappoint you amen god is not a man that he should lie or a son of man that he should repent the bible tells us that his word will never go back to him void so if you spoke it and you take it and you apply it it's going to happen to you it's go his that his word is going to keep you his word is going to give you victory to possess all the gates of the enemy standing in front of you all you have to do is take that identity and you say lord i'm stepping into it that's what i am that's what you wanted for me before the foundation of the world if you just stand on the word your revealed word for the day now the devil knows that the more you look at the word the more you read your word that's where you get your strength from but now the devil he's so cunning he's trying to he tries to make us not read the word he has so many distractions in front of us we have the cell phone you have everything right there and you spend your whole day on the cell phone and you don't have time for god if you go look in your cell phone settings your if the phone screen time you'll be shocked later on if you compare that with your bible with your bible time or prayer time those are the devil's techniques he is trying to deem our focus he's trying to get us distracted because he knows that the more we look and read into the word of god you get to realize who you are and he has no power against you in question and answers on the holy ghost the prophet of god said thus the death struck to satan when a man takes god at his word brother that will kill satan every time not sometimes but he says it will kill satan every time the hardest hitting that satan can get when a man will take god at his word that's what he's trying to do he'll make you not have time for your bible not have time for devotion not have enough time to pray you just pray over food or two minutes just before you go to work that's not gonna help you i had one person say if prayer doesn't chase sin out of your life sin is going to chase prayer out of your life and now prayer is that connection we have with god if you don't communicate and you don't have that connection where are you going to have your overcoming power you are not going to have it but if we just realize that these are the devil's techniques these are the devil's tricks and we make sure we go back to the word we are not distracted and keep on looking at what god has for us what he's telling us who we are we will never fail we know victory is certain we know that victory is set for sure that's why many people end up losing their identity they forget who we are people forget who they are because they are not being reminded by their bibles of who they are they're not listening to the tapes they're not reading the message of the hour so how are you gonna know who you are where are you gonna get that power from to overcome everything that comes in your way many people have lost their identity people trying to be balanced here in the message people try to they say no we are being too too too strict or we are being too legalistic and then they try to balance in the in the process they over balance and then we end up being lukewarm and cold we have lost our identity people end up going to places that they never went before christianity has lost its identity christianity people were called christians in the first place because they were living like christ when people said oh those people are acting like christ this is how christ used to work like that's that's where the name christianity came from but now christianity has lost its identity it's because people are not reading their word people are not praying there is no prayer life but if we go back to the word of and see what god says about us and see what god has for us will be able to regain back our identity and see who we really are amen so we have to know our true identity we are the bride of jesus christ and we are here to tell the world who christ is he died on the cross of calvary so that he could come and live within you and me and so that we could reflect him amen we also read in the bible of a man called david then he was a boy he was out there in the wilderness and then he is taking care of his father's sheep and then the father sends him to go to go feed his brethren and then david he was there but whilst he was still in the desert there's a bear that came he wanted to take one of his lamps there's a lion that came and wanted to take one of his lamps but you know what he did he had a slingshot he killed the lion he killed the bear whilst he was there and he was no longer scared of these wild animals he was not scared of this beast whilst he was there he was realizing and stepping into his true identity he was tapping into the identity that god had for him he was having his identity building his credentials as a beast slayer whilst he was there in the wilderness when he was sent by his dad to go give food to his brothers then he hears someone defying the name of the lord the the lord of israel and he's wondering who is that and then when he goes to look he sees that it's just another beast and then he realized he said i'm a beast slayer yeah that's the identity i created for myself that's my credentials and then they try to stop him but he says no i'll go he is not anymore different because he is just another beast if you read your bible carefully says david ran towards goliath why to him that was just another beast in modern day language that what we call huge people right he was just a beast and he said from my previous experiences with god i have known myself to be a beast slayer he's so goliath no any other different beast and he ran towards him and he had victory why it was because he was using the identity that god was working him on so when you see trials coming your way don't hesitate go for it god has trusted you with that trial when you see a temptation come your way you go for it god has allowed the temptation to come your way that's an opportunity for you to build your identity that's an opportunity for you to step into the identity of who you are to be an overcomer because we have promised that to overcome every enemy enemy's gaze to possess all of them when a trial come you go for it you are building your identity there is no temptation that god can bring to you or trial that god can bring to you that he he doesn't trust you with amen we know for job god was having a conversation with satan and he said have you conceded my servant job satan he said well how can he not serve you and you have given him all these things god said go touch him whatever you want i know he will stand for me why in all these things god allowed satan to bring those trials so god doesn't bring to you any trial but he allows satan to do it and when satan comes with it know for sure that god has already entrusted you with it god already knows that you're gonna overcome it god already knows that you are gonna be an overcomer so whatever sickness disease god that comes your way whatever tribulation trial affliction when it comes your way you say thank you lord you this is an opportunity for me to have a testimony this is an opportunity for me to step into my true identity as an overcomer this is an opportunity for me to show who i really am and god always has a way for you in first corinthians he said there is no temptation that's uncommon to man god already opens away whenever you are in a corner so whenever you're in a tight spot you look and say lord show me the doorway i'm supposed to go he already has that for you and when you come out of that door you're gonna come out of a warrior you're gonna come out and overcomer you're gonna come out victorious so every time you are in a tight spot the devil tries to put you between a rock and a hard place you look around and pray and say lord show me that open doorway and when you come out you'll be able to give a testimony and you can stand and you say i'm an overcomer next time trials come your way you say i have an identity my identity is an overcomer my identity is a demon killer because you are working it out whenever when any time things come your way you are fighting it you are building up your credentials so that's what you got to do know that god has trusted each and every trial that comes your way each and every disease that knocks on your door you say thank you lord this is an opportunity for me to win this is an opportunity for me to be an overcomer so the devil is always trying to distract us so that we don't see who we really are in an expert in an exposition of the seven church ages the prophet of god said now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it look warm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting the word god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he knows that if the people gather true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and what she can do to the greater works she will be an invincible army the devil knows that the more you read the word the more you see in revelation this says to whom who overcometh in the seven church ages he doesn't want you to be like that so that's why he's always keep on distracting you from reading your word the moment he realizes you the moment you realize who you are he knows that's destruction for his kingdom that's why he's trying to dim us he has brings he has brought so many false doctrines in in the message trying to distract people but we thank god there is a people like we were told who has that part of god that seed of god that's in here nothing can change it there is no false doctrine that can change what god has placed in you there is no form of wind wind of doctrines or false religion that can touch it the seed of god that he placed in within you is untouchable so we thank god we can never be distracted we can never be fooled amen so if we can just stand and trust on god knowing that what he has placed within you and me that will not fail so make your calling and election sure and say what i have within me is it the right thing because when christ is gonna come and try and find you he's not going to look for anything else but the holy ghost is going to look for the very same peace that would dovetail with what he had in the beginning nothing different that's why we gotta stay on the world stand flat footed so that we cannot be moved hey man he don't want us to realize who we are the reason for the whole world coming into our in this day is for you and i to realize who we are is for you to realize that whatever that was in christ is supposed to be within you and me jesus came down so that he says the works that i do shall you do also that is the that's the holy sense for him to come on calvary so that he could live within you and me so that he could do the works he was doing in the body of jesus he wants to do it within you and me in the book when they when their eyes were up and says then if he is raised from the dead he is normal in a corporate body but he is in our body all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was in christ he poured into the church see it's just a continuation that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father in me and i in you the holy spirit working amongst his people that's why the devil don't want you to know that the very same power that was in god when he said let there be light was in jesus christ when he broke that bread and multiplied it that same power is lying within you and me because church we know church is not a building we are the people look at your neighbor and say god bless you church that person is a church that's the church so whatever that was in jesus christ he put he poured it into a body that he calls bride people who are willing to receive the holy ghost when you receive the holy ghost then you can say i am bride then everything that was in him is poured into you and you have the very same power that he had if if you go to the sea and you take sea water and you if i put it in a bottle here i'm not going to call it bottled water i'm going to call it sea water why is because the same chemical elements in this sea water in a bottle is the same chemical elements in the water that was in the sea it's just in a different container so the very same power that was in god it was just transferred into jesus and the same power was transferred into you and me so whatever he did those works you and i we can do it because we have a promise that says greater works than this shall you do only if we're able to realize that that's our identity to be a tabernacle of christ a people whom he wants to live in in the book of john chapter 10 verse 34 he says jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said you are god's and if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken that is your true identity you are a god so we have all that power that god invested in us for that us for that power for us to use whilst we are living here on earth we have power against all principalities of the devil we have the power to create an atmosphere we have the power to chase demons we have the power to profess healing we have the power to live a christian life is because we are gods whatever that the life that jesus lives you lived you and i we can live the same one because whatever that was in him has been pleasant to us all the temptations that he went through you and i we can overcome those jesus also grew up from being a young man from from from being a baby to a 33 year old man so all those temptations he came across them too so he the same power that he had if you dedicate your life to christ he is also able to give you the same victories that he had because you and i the bible tells us that we are gods so if we are only able to realize that and step into that identity the devil will not be able to to make us live under our own privileges because we know and we would have realized who we are amen yes sir in the bible in the book of romans chapter 12 verse 2 he says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable the perfect will of god if you be transformed by the renewing of your mind that means letting go of your old carnal mind and getting a new mind that that christ had that's how we will be renewed that's how we renew our identity to be changed we are transformed into the real identity that christ has for us if we look at philip chapter 2 verse 5 it says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal to god so you be renewed by taking the mind that was in christ jesus and you put it in your mind and we know that this mind is being talked about is the heart because when you take it to the mind the devil is able to come and reason it out that's how he overcame adam and eve in the first place he that's how he overcame eve because he she reasoned it she used the the mind to reason when you try to reason with the devil you'll never win he's been around for 6 000 years he probably knows the bible more than you do so never reason the word in the mind with the devil take that mind that was in christ and put it down in your heart proverbs 23 7 tells us that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so you have renewed your mind yourself by taking the mind that was in christ and you place it within yourself and the way that you think in your heart that's who you are if you have that mind in christ you become christ-like because you are now thinking like christ so that's why never reason the devil he is cunning but if you have that word in your mind in your heart he can never touch it in the in the book and exposition of the servant changes the prophet of god said so when a spirit born spirit filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why does the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man why because he has the mind that was in christ and he has the word in his heart in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god you have that word in your heart you have god in your heart nothing can stand before you every mountain has to go satan cannot stand no affliction can stand before you because you know your true identity you know that i am tabernacling deity you know when i speak it is the same as dear to speaking because i have taken the word of the lord into my heart yes sir i'm sure many of you you heard the little story of the this little boy who went to to visit his uh his relatives and he was he was coming from from the country he had never seen a mirror before when he goes he sees a mirror he stands in front of the mirror he waves he sees a young man similar to him waving back he says who is that whatever actions he was doing this boy the boy in the mirror was mimicking those same movements back to him so he was wondering he had never seen a mirror before and then after a while it struck him he said that cannot be somebody else that is me amen and he ran back to his mama and he said mama that is me i saw myself in the mirror i'm here to tell you that we have a mirror in front of us this evening when you look into that mirror it will never lie to you when you look into the mirror of the word of god he always shows you who you are when you look into the mirror of god he always shows you your true identity so just whenever you come to any situation just look and see what does the mirror say about me you know there's this man who gave his friend a spoken word book and he read it and he went back to his friend and said this book called me a buzzard but then this friend said oh that same book called me an eagle why because a mirror doesn't lie it just shows you who you really are so you just walk into the mirror it will show you your true identity you might get lost for a while but because of your true identity that will never change every time we come to church so that we can check our identity to make sure that we align with what the mirror is saying when things are going wrong maybe you are in school or anything and you you have back threat you have bad grades just look at what the mirror says the mirror says you shall be the head and not the tail so you take what the mirror says about you and apply it to you when you are at work they don't wanna they don't wanna promote you or they're trying to suppress you you look take up the mirror and look and say what does the mirror say about me the mirror says you are above and not beneath you take it and you step into it that's the mirror will never lie to you whenever you are sick take that same mirror it will show you it will say by my stripes you were healed so you just take it and you accept it you will be healed because the mirror never lies amen the mirror says we shall perform exploits when you are in a tight fix god wants to perform an exploit with you and me this evening amen just look into that word that word will never lie that mirror will never lie amen whenever you look god is duty bound to his word we have read we all know the story about auntie jemima the the little lady in memphis tennessee she was reading the bible then she saw herself she saw she looked and she saw the shuna my woman she looked into the mirror and she said that was me and then she saw a sick boy and she saw that as well but there was no elisha in the picture and she knew the the picture has to be complete because the mirror does not lie and then she knelt down and she prayed her prayer brought a whole plane down why because she had realized her true identity it is not the prayer of william branham that was working it was the prayer of a woman who realized who she was there were a lot of important men on that on that plane but prayer did not even regard all of that it just said there is a woman who realized her true identity and the picture has to be complete and the man the prophet of god was walking not knowing where he was going it's because the prayer of this woman was directing the man of god it's because she had realized her true identity she saw herself in the mirror of the word and her child was healed because of her prayer so it don't matter who you are you might be a mother you might be you might be a father a son or a daughter whatever it is look yourself in the mirror whatever the mirror says about you it will never lie and you step into that identity that the mirror has for you the mirror of the word of god it never lies amen the moment you realize your true identity all hell will know who you are all forces will know who you are peter ran away when he didn't know his true identity but when he came in contact with christ his identity knew his identity changed he was willing to die for the cross he was willing to die for the word because his identity had changed you remember the sons of skever when they were trying to pray and cast out these these devils this demon says paul we know but who are you they didn't even know their identity and they ran so if you don't know your identity you the devils are gonna make you run you're gonna run away from temptations you're gonna run away from trials if you don't know your true identity but when you know your true identity the whole host of heaven is willing to back you up because they know who you are one time the prophet of god said we are ambassadors of heaven when an ambassador speaks they are representing the whole country so when you and i speak we are representing christ the whole host of heaven has to back up whatever you say they know who you are when you speak heaven has to back it up when you chase demons when you chase sicknesses when you come what after whatever that's coming after you heaven has to back you up if you are a true ambassador and you have the holy ghost god is duty bound by his word to make that come to pass if you just realize your true identity of who you are god is willing to come down god is willing to show it to you god is willing to show you that you are supposed to be victorious god is willing to give you all the victories that you need and all those trials and temptations that maybe you have in your past and you said lord i was not able to overcome this two weeks ago but you say lord now i realize that i am a son i am a daughter of abraham and your words say that i will possess all the gates of the enemy all those battles i was able i was not able to overcome now that's the thing of the past i'm may i'm applying it to me this evening i want it to be for me i want to step into my identity all the things that are gonna come in front of me lord help me give me the ability to overcome it because your mirror the word never lies it will always show me my true identity it will always show me who i am amen let's stand up on our feet how many say i'm willing to step into my identity i'm willing to walk into what the word of god said i am i'm willing to look at what god had for me before the foundation of the world started sing this song oh yes i'm a child of the king the musicians can come forward oh yes oh yes i'm a child of the king israel blood now flows through my

lord the devil might have taken advantage of us in the past but now we know that our past does not determine our future our current lives don't determine our future but now from now on lord we want to step into our true identity as overcomers we want to step in our true identity as demon killers lord all those battles that we have lost in the past lord we don't want that to happen no more father we pray for more grace lord that we may be able to stay focused on your word because we want your overcoming power in our midst we want your overcoming power to take preeminence oh lord we are done

commit everything into your hands oh lord in jesus christ's name i pray believing amen [Music] now can seem praise god praise god i'm a child of the king amen i enjoyed that tonight i really did not only because it was my friend's son preaching but because it it speaks to your heart you know okay and if i could take that of what he said and if he would allow me just to add a little thought along with it you know we look for who that we really are and the lord and i i couldn't add anything to what the brother said but you know in as being a christian sometimes we should increase our borders you know what i mean but what other work does god have for me to do how can what can i do to mature in the lord what what what gifts and what attributes are there that i can lay possession on how can i grow my christianity how can i grow my nature how can i grow you know grow my strength and how can i let my light shine greater and and how can i have a greater impact on people around me all that's part of your identity all that if i could just use uh add a word to what my our brother was saying along with identity your identity holds your potential you know and to and to be able if you can expand your identity i just liked how he said it when he says i saw then i saw that's me i looked in the mirror and i saw that's me and he said if you look in the word you can see that's me not just from a standpoint of being forgiven but when he said these works that i do you shall do also do you look at your life and say well i want those works that what are those works what are how can i expand my christianity and a lot of times we set up camp but we've got to go beyond our camp we've got to go beyond our comfort zone we've got to reach into places that we've never walked before we've got to have faith to express our faith in ways that we never expressed it before we've got to have that growth potential and that growth potential is a part of your identity your final identity is the works that i do you shall do also that's winning souls to christ to help going an extra mile visiting the widow and the fatherless in their affliction do you look in that and say well it says in here that i'll visit the widow in the fatherless in in their affliction have i ever done that have i ever expressed that have i ever took this word and transferred it from letter into identity and then from identity into actions that prove who that you are i can say that who i am i can say i can lift the thousand pounds but when i lift a thousand pounds then i've identified that what i've said is true and that's what god will do he'll identify what he said is true but let's that identity grow in us let us be in our life let it be in our action let's be in our word let's see if we could expand our christianity explain expand our area of influence expand our testimony expand the shedding abroad of the love of god by the spirit if if we can and i think that's i i'm i'm just telling you how the message spoke to me tonight david you need to expand yourself out and and and and spread abroad that which is in the inside amen so let's keep this word test tonight i think it was a wonderful word thank you brother i really enjoyed that and it's nice to have to have him here amen you know i wanted i i wanted clever to sing that song that he what's that song where's billy hiding at billy what's that song clever always used to sing when he was here yeah clever where are you hiding did you forget the words of that song can you come sing it for us again you know me i just got to get everything anybody that's ever worked with me knows that i'll get as much out of them as i can so that's the way it is amen we're going to enjoy that i enjoyed the message i enjoyed the singing
