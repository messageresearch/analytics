Description:
"Come Unto Me": Accepting His Personal Invitation
Br. Andrew Bohannon
June 19, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

together our precious Lord here we are once again Lord Lord we thank you God that you've provided a way Lord that we can come into divine presence Lord and we can stand here knowing that Lord you've called us to this place and it was your love Lord that woed our heart Lord surely we were going our own way Lord but you were the Great Shepherd oh God and you seek each one of us out and here we are tonight Lord we're Desiring Lord as we're at the post of Duty Lord we're in service for you Lord we pray that you would have full sway in this service father Lord from the beginning Lord hearing the the testimony and the songs of Zion surely we know that you're in this place Lord we pray your great hand of comfort upon the people Lord and we pray that you'd give them the bread of life Lord and Lord help us Lord all together Lord will you anoint the hearer and the speaker together Lord that we can harmonize with your will tonight Lord that we can hear from heaven and we can go forward Lord as soldiers of the Cross Lord knowing what the time that we're in and the day that we're living and the message oh God teach us Lord tonight as we commit every heart here Lord use your unprofitable servant Lord if there'd be something that would be accomplished in this service let it be because of your faithfulness to your word bless each heart Lord and I'm asking you'd bless our pastor and sister Leslie as they're traveling Lord I pray that you'd increase him in Revelation bless his oh God desires of his heart for the glory and honor of your kingdom we pray now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the lord well we're certainly happy to be in the house of God and to see each one of you praise God it's wonderful to see brother manasse and his bride to be Lord richly bless you you know it's one of those things that when you see the natural taking place you know something that you're always excited for in that day when it comes and then you finally realize this is what God intended and you know that's what it's like for us as Believers you know God wants to have a union with each one of us amen so we're so grateful for that and trust that you know whenever a person accepts the responsibility of having a wife you know all all of your old life it's behind you it's dead and you become a new in Union so now you become a whole new unit it's just marvelous journey and I thank God for it because it helps us to understand what God's desire is for us as Believers Lord to you know to be able to have fellowship with the lord it's just so wonderful well if you have your Bibles and while you're standing we won't be long by the help of the Lord but I just had the this little thought that as Brother David was ministering he said something in his last service about coming to the table and coming to his feet is just something that's been on my heart and you know if I could just point to something that the Lord said and it encourage your heart then I say that it was a good time in the Lord amen you know it says this in Matthew chap 11 we're going to read in 25 to3 and we'll also go to Philippians chapter 2 but Matthew chapter 11 says this in verse 25 says at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and shall ye shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen and another scripture there found in Philippians chapter 2 a very familiar verse of reading it says this in Chapter 2 and verse 5 we might just uh get our fingers uh ready for a few page turning but says this let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen you may have your seats we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word I also wanted to flip over to Isaiah chapter 1 Isaiah chapter 1 and we'll look at um verse 16 but maybe I'll just jump right into this quote that been B bubbling on my heart since Brother David preached out of it it must have been a month or two ago but in identifications and you could just hold your finger on that Isaiah scripture but it says this in identification in um he says now you study that character a little bit and then you look at yourself and and I look at myself but that's what he was that's who he was that's why he was to save you he took he become you that you might become him he took your load of sin therefore when we come to meet him we will not have to we will not have to stand we could not stand in his presence there's no way for us to do it but when we stand in him see he's already recognized the sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased he recognized it there was no blemish on him and yet he suffered Temptation like any man yet he was scorned he was made fun of he was persecuted from the hour he was born until he died and yet he returned good for evil you cannot know way ever produce a character like that only accept that character in you a church cannot do it a Creed cannot do that a denomination can't do that education can't do that it must be a birth it's got to be a dying out letting God in by the grace of Christ mold this type of character in you that you become him and your life and his is the same then you are Sons and Daughters of God oh what a rest for the people of God think about it he gave his life so that we can have it [Music] amen now this is a little bit more of what I wanted to share out of this same message he says how can God and this is in paragraph 111 how can God come into a place like that when they deny the word when watches over his word to vindicate it to make it come to pass oh I thank God that God is here to make his word come to pass think about it and this word pushes out how can is pushed out how can he identify himself something like that we've got to take the entire Full Gospel amen we must and now being that we have identified ourselves as Full Gospel people people let us mold our character now we're invited to mold to be molded in His image that we might reflect his presence my what an invitation think about that you know sometimes if someone invites you over for dinner or something you know they have something that they want to give you they have something that they wanted to have some fellowship with you over think about it and this is an invitation that God Almighty is placing before his people before the whole world he says now we're invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also and the life that I live so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his what a thing my then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ the Mind mind which is his character your mind makes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let that mind be in you it molds the character of a Son of God just listen a minute how can we have the mind of Christ that was in him and deny the things that he commissioned us to do how can we place miracles in the past when the very Christ himself was God and God in him in the presence of God there's always miracles he said you call me Lord why call me Lord and do not the things that I have commanded you I laid down for you to do don't you see where we've gotten to where the church is drifting I find it a lot a whole lot among the Pentecostals too we're drifting from that Lifeline we must get back to that friend come back because we're getting big now you see the businessmen's publication is the greatest one as much maybe is what Oral Roberts has got and I find out that when when we get to getting big then we go to acting big see and that's where Israel did and I got to thinking it's not so much about the establishment but it can be but sometimes it's our attitudes it's sometimes we have within ourselves by our natural birth we have a dying character we we at the beginning when mankind fell they begin to take the blessings of God and put them on the inside like selfishness containment the bless blessings of St of God stop right here and all of a sudden that's the kind of character that you and I are born with but Jesus Christ never lived a day for himself he had a living character he when he was spoken evil of when he was persecuted and mocked and ridiculed he only returned good for evil what a character what an example and we're invited to come to him how many times do we have issues in life where the schoolmate or a work uh acquaintance or somebody in our family's done something and all of a sudden we forget that we've been invited to mold our character to his we immediately revert back to our old dying character and all a sudden we got problems and we we got difficulties but we want to recognize the invitation is every minute of the day God is present all the time to fulfill his word to give us this kind of life to set in course what he promised it would be I in you and you in me oh isn't that the Cry of the heart's desire of the believer today I want this mind to be in me that was also in Jesus Christ that thought it not robbery to be equal with God oh my and he died for this purpose we don't want this purpose to be in vain in our lives we don't want to just serve God by tradition we don't want to just believe oh I I'm part of this church I do this and I do that but oh my every day I'm going to God In Prayer I'm going to him he said come unto me God I'm taking your word I'm coming to you I have this problem I have this difficulty I want to come to him even like the brother says I want to thank God I want to worship you I want to be like that one leper that after 10 of them were healed I come back and praise you I thank you you're faithful to your word blessed be his name come unto me you know in an invitation when you're invited somewhere you want to at least give the honor and say I'm going to accept it I'm going to receive this invitation you know I thank God every time he was invited somewhere he showed up oh God I want to be that kind of Christian in the face of ridicule in the face of anything if it's your will God give me the grace to stand yes no yes Lord I want to be the one that says yes Lord I'll go oh my come to the table come to receive his word amen I didn't have much in the way of notes but you know it's just one of those things I get really excited to think about God is inviting us you know and it's a personal call it's not a group we're not going as a church we're going as individuals each one of us it's not Mommy and Daddy it's not husband and wife we're walking this walk one onone with God you know it doesn't matter your age it doesn't matter what country you came from it doesn't matter your gender it doesn't matter your past it doesn't matter God has a future for you if you will accept his invitation to come he's laid out a an invitation just like there was uh you know there this was a I can't think of the the scripture right now but there was a feast that was made and he B he went out in three pools and he said go out to the highways and the byways and bid them come my think about it you know what an invitation and many one right after the other started making excuses excuses excuses not to accept and receive his invitation I let me wake up let me recognize who's this that's inviting us who's this that's calling us to the table who's laid out the Feast this is not natural bread this is the Bread of Heaven this is this is accompanied with life eternal life my if we can lift up Jesus tonight my right oh I want to receive that that and accept it tonight in Isaiah chapter 1 and6 says this he says wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doing from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow come now and let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it what a choice huh we've been invited to come and reason together where though your new birth it was as it was accounted with with the natural Act of man the desires of humanity that sin nature but he's saying now come let us reason think about it that God is allowing you though your sins be as Scarlet they'll be washed white as snow oh my goodness what an invitation let me Ponder this Lord let me go to you in prayer I can't understand how my nature it's the dying nature how I can be on my knees and see that you paid the price and by coming to you and just receiving it by faith I can be white as snow you as individuals how many's experienced the love of Christ and the Forgiveness of your sins there's Witnesses here if you haven't come to that place he's inviting you to come be washed amen be clean and put away the the evil doing amen praise God think about it you know I I got to thinking of an example you know uh praise God in Genesis chapter 4 you know when worshippers you know Cain and Abel they were worshippers they both came and they did their religious service and yet in one of them you know I just sometimes I think about it you know Adam and Eve when they were in that Perfection and then they fell into sin you know when God said I will put enity I will bruise the Serpent's heel or I will bruise the heel and I will crush the head God promised promising even then that there was going to be an atonement there was going to be one that would come and pay the price of sin but yet now see no doubt Adam and Eve they had experienced this glory of God in the Innocence it was a dispensation of Innocence they were naked and didn't have any shame but the moment they crossed that line then they began to have oh I was naked and I hid myself and then they started putting fig leaves and then they started trying to do something but yet what did God do God he clothed them with animal skins God was foreshadowing that great atonement see no doubt Adam and Eve they were talking with their children you know that was one time it was so glorious it was Majestic but we took this experience and you know what happened we were cast out of the garden really Mom Dad what are you serious can you imagine you know and all of a sudden the the two boys are going man this is incredible story and that's why some of us some of us young people may be going man this is an incredible story what he's telling but oh my when all of the sudden it was their time to go and make an altar and worship this these two boys they begin to do as they begin to what would you know hey what would be pleasing to God and all of a sudden they started placing you know Cain he placed faed his you know things of the field cuz he was tiller of the soil so no doubt he brought all the crops and the Beautiful F he made a beautiful worship to God and here you know Abel even was just you know just a shepherd and he you know something in him Pro it probably struck him because he was he had the ability to receive from God and no doubt Faith cometh by hearing and somehow there was a connection made that you know what I I need to slay a lamb because there's no way to worship God except under the shed blood of an innocent lamb something had to strike him the scripture says that Abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice unto God and Faith cometh by hearing it wasn't a knowledge hey you know what Adam and Eve telling no it was God dealing with individuals it was a personal Reckoning and and no doubt he said oh oh I know I you know this is what you require and all of a sudden here here comes the story where where you we're looking at Cain and and here it is in verse 5 he says but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell oh he was mad you're like wait a minute and all of a sudden he says and the Lord said to Cain why thou wro why why aren't th why is that countenance fell why you know when God comes to you asking it's his grace it's time to get honest it's time to have a heart tohe heart he's coming to you he he he's willing he's easily to be entreated my I I want to be invited to that character when there's something going wrong I want somebody to be be able to come to me and I don't all of a sudden and give him the hammer I want to be able to say you know what okay I understand you know I want to have that understanding heart of God but here he is God's telling Cain he says why and he says if thou will do well shalt thou not be accepted yeah if thou if thou does not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt and he shall rule over you okay you know I think the the mercies of God in the invitation see right then and there he he saw the light of the day in Abel as a worshipper of spirit and truth and his offering was accept but he was so jealous and he could not humble himself to do like his brother did and God warned him you know God always sends warning before judgment and he warned him he said you know what if you refuse to walk in this accepted way your sin nature the desires that you have will now control your every move you know your sin nature is not immune to this same thing that's why we must accept his invitation we must come to him we must say let this character I want to receive this character tonight and unto thee shall his desire and he Thou shalt rule over him oh my think about that and that's just one of the ways that we see in the scripture when someone turns down the invitation when someone refuses the light of the day okay my there's nothing but judgment and you see the manifestation of the fruit of the rejection he goes and out of jealousy he kills his brother and then he says oh am I My Brother's Keeper trying to cover the tracks my the human nature the heart of men is desperately wicked who can contain it but we look at this example found in John chapter 6 if you'll go with me there won't be long by the help of the Lord are you feeling okay all right praise God so in John chapter 6 and I believe we'll read in 60 John chapter 6 he says many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend you what if what and if ye shall see the son of man ascending up where he was before and it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but these are some of you that believe there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and shall betray him and he said therefore I say unto you that no man can come to me no man can come unto me except it be given of him of my father praise God for election no man can come to me can come unto me except he be given of my father and that from that time many of the disciples went back and walked no more with him you know some some people connect and and we believe that you know to to reject the Seal of God is to take the mark of the beast now to receive the Seal of God by the B AP ISM of the Holy Ghost you're sealed until the day of redemption right but you see the rejection of what Jesus was talking about and it's just so happens to be in John 666 so if you want to take that go ahead but he says then Peter confessed his faith he said then said Jesus unto the twel will ye also go away and then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Amen I thank God for that because what a revelation what a rock when you go to him he gives you that same rock it takes all of the fear and dread of being saved today and lost tomorrow you're secure see I wonder when when we've been given the invitation to come unto him do we do we take do we receive it do we do we do it or is it just I did it two years ago I gave my heart to the Lord two years ago but now what he's saying and Peter is even testifying where else would we go think about it when we're going through a crisis oh we got to go to the doctor because there's a crisis on oh we got to go get financial aid cuz I don't know how we're going to pay for your school we got to go here we got to go there but Peter was saying where else will we go thou alone has has the words of Life see I believe sometimes in our Humanity we're all guilty of it we go to other places first okay but I want to give him the preeminence I said God you've given me this test you've given me this trial you've given me this situation that I can come to you and you can father me out of this situation you've given promises that I can be a partaker of divine nature so I want to take you at your word I want to come to you and look in what the the revealed word of the hour what the Bible says concerning my condition my situation I want to come to him take him at his word H you know I just want to tell you I think there's many reasons to go to him and I'll just say it this way like John said in chapter one but just run through a few scriptures and just point to the Lord but he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was that was made and him him in him was life and the life that was the light of men I think that's a good reason to go to him he has life amen amen and he's the creator of all things if there's an impossibility he's a way maker where there's no way we can go to him because we can know he made all things for him and by him so my condition didn't take God by surprise my situation but he's waiting for me to come to him he's already put the invitation out he's just waiting to see if we'll take his invitation say Let It Be according to your word my he says there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe oh my we can go to him because God has sent a message that we might believe that's a good reason to come to the table some of these things seem confusing and we're trying to talk it over with this person and that person and this person but we can't live by second hand we got to go to him there's one that's witnessed I've been in the presence of the Shak of glory and he's here tonight don't go to this person and person for your understanding go to the source come unto me he was not the light but he sent to Bear witness of that light and that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world and he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which are born not of blood nor by the will of the flesh nor by the will of man but of God I think that's a good reason to go to him because he's the only one that has the power to make you be the Son of God that God's called you to to be the daughter of God oh my that's a good reason to go to him cuz he has the power right to transform he has the power to take what he promised as a promise giver and when you go to him and then he instructs you and then you act upon his word according to the instruction and you will find out real quick that he's also a promis keeper Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah oh my you know we must go to him we must go to him it says this in 19 or excuse me we'll back up to 17 he says for the law was given by Moses but Grace Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him oh my think about that think about that you know if you need some Grace in your life if you need some truth in your life come to Jesus says this that the law came by Moses but Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ and if you're confused about the matter who the father is he said this no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared amen oh my when we go to him we can understand God gives us sight to see and to understand praise God God is the only one that can give Revelation Jesus Christ is the only way amen I believe it's in John 14 we have to go to him because the scripture says in John 14 and this is the the Declaration he said that he's declared him but he says let your let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come and again I will come again and receive you until myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goes and how can you we know the way Jesus said unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man come unto the father but by me so if we want to go we need to go to him because he's the way amen and Hebrews 9 and 28 just having a little Word Fellowship Hebrews 9 it's in here somewhere the scripture says there in 20 in uh 28 he says so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many Lord and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation that's right now as I read that today I started pondering that but he just said for those who look for him he shall appear now I understand that there's been a fulfillment but you know also understand that scripture has a compound manifestation so now if God is going to come see the character that was in Christ was a sinless nature but he's saying now if you will accept this character if you will accept this mind then by a Divine transaction by you accepting that then you can also just like the scriptures stating here be be without sin unto salvation oh my you know the scripture says if we say that we haven't sinned we lie and the truth is not in us but that has a n on the end of that sin sinned but now when you come into Christ you are now identified with your sacrifice you are now in him when God looks at you he doesn't see you if you're identification is in the one who bid you come just like Peter he said Lord if that's you bid me come if the word said it I'm stepping out I'm stepping out on your word you said I would have a sinless nature you said by accepting this character that was in Christ then I too am spotless according to your word I might be walking into fulfillment praise God but because I have the ticket of invitation cuz I've received the spirit of Christ amen he's not looking at you he's looking at your identification when I see the blood I will pass over you the token must be on display I've come and I've bowed before him daily in prayer hearing the word of God I've got my instructions I've come and now I'm walking I'm walking in truth I'm walking in the light I know that the blood of Jesus cleanses us of all unrighteousness I am losing track of time amen he's the way he's the only way to be saved that's right can you imagine trying to find some satisfaction in some affiliation in church or some knowledge of being associated with people who wear dresses and skirts that's that's okay that's within our ranks that's one way to be accepted in the fellowship but we're looking to be accepted in the Beloved and we have to be born again we have to receive his spirit and be transformed be made a new creature in Christ Jesus so we must come to him and ask him to take those old rags and give us his spirit so we can be born again amen see we have to go to Jesus because he's the only truth you know in Hebrews chapter 9 and 16 we'll just back up a little bit but he says for where a testament is thereof also of a necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after a man is dead or men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood that's right for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took blood of calves and goats with water and Scarlet and hos and sprinkled it both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you more over he sprinkled the blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and also All Things Are by the law purged with blood but without the shedding of blood is no remission of sins that is the truth God has declared it in the Old Testament in a shadow through bulls and goats but praise God when the Virgin was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost according to to Gabriel's visit we know that the Lamb of God was born into this world and introduced by John oh my think about that truth we want to be identified with our sacrifice we must come to him for our identification we must be willing to let go of our old character cuz that character identified you you were a harlot you were a wine Biber you were all of these different things but we must come to the place where we say you know what that's not my identification I've come to the Lord and he's told me he is I am the apple of his eye I am bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh my I go back to the scripture in Genesis chapter 2 and I begin to see in verse 18 He says and the Lord said it is not good that a man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him this is not just a man speaking but God said I will make a help meat oh and just to think that all of this creation everything that's in existence and what working in motion is because God had one plan that he wanted to execute and he wanted to have a bride for his son praise God that they can have a family and be a family praise God and God wants you to know and have the same kind of Fellowship H that's why he's made a way that's why he shed his blood we couldn't come to him like I believe it was our pastor saying you know like Oh I'm a sinner and I'm this and that and yeah we look at ourselves we identify ourselves but God is saying look the way I look I want to heal your eyes so you can see the way I see come to me I want to give you healing for your eyes we must come to him because he's the only healer can you imagine like if all I put is confidence in the doctor I am going to be disappointed they can have 99.9 percentage of success in a treatment and all of a sudden I become that 0 percentile because if God's wanted to show me that he's my healer and I put all my confidence in something else you know what I'm going to have these struggles and these difficults it's going to continue on because God is a jealous God come to me I'm your healer by my stripes you are healed my think about it you know we got to come to him to really know that we have life you know when you look at when you look at John chapter 11 and we're all familiar with the testimony of our brother Lazarus you know he was a faithful servant and uh in John chapter 11 we'll go to 25 well we'll just back up to 23 Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and Martha said unto him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this oh my when we come to him he reveals himself that he is the resurrection and the life when we come to him and he reveal kills himself then he says okay now it's your time to make your confession when you come to him and he speaks to you and he says just like with Martha she said yay Lord I believe and he was bringing her to a further revelation of himself that's what he's doing to us every day if we'll come to him he wants to unfold himself further and more into our lives amen my I feel like I got to speed up here you know Jesus we must go to him because he's our lasting achievement you know it's one thing that I think we strive in life to have a successful life you know I think it's put in us to to do certain things to go to school and to give her all to be academic to do you know good studies and or if if we feel that you know our calling is sports then we'll we'll train according you know to to success in that area or if you know if if you know Finance is a big thing for somebody then they'll look to achieve a great wealth and you know if if you know if you feel in your heart you know God's called you to be a preacher well then you'll do and you'll fast and you'll pray and you look to the Lord and if you want to be a deacon or musician or if you want to have a place or a position you'll do all of those things God willing and those things are achievements great but they are not lasting they are temporary but he if we go to him he's the only lasting achievement when you get into Christ it's a permanent position when you finally get there it's a lasting achievement you don't get kicked out the next day you know if we'll go to Colossians chapter 1 I'm trying to go a little bit fast because I got a couple more things I just want to share with you in Colossians chapter 1 and verse we'll just start there um you know Brother David speak was speaking about the ministry of reconciliation when he was preaching last and I I just you know to think that God has given us the ministry of reconciliation you know he says be ye reconciled but then after you're reconciled and come into Christ now you the same Works he did God is telling you to go out and do he's giv you power to become a Son of God to conduct his business the way he did to cast out Devils to Open the Eyes of the blind to unstop deaf ears to raise the dead to impart life my says this we'll just read there in 19 he says for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through the death to present you holy unblamable unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which we have preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereby I Paul made a minister amen and who now rejoice in my suffering for you and fill up that which is behind the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given unto me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which has been hid from all from ages and generation from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known The Riches of his glory and this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen and that's you know that's that's another reason why we must go to him because he's the only one that can manifest his glory in our lives that's right it is actually God in you to will yes and do of his good pleasure so we must go to him and him energize the faith of the Son of God inside of us to move us into action but we must go to him and ask you know the scripture says that he that lack wisdom let him ask so we don't go to God like we know it like I know the Mysteries I know the seals I know what God wants I'm I'm going to pray God this is your no if you lack wisdom concerning a matter go humbly before him God I don't know I have this knowledge of things I went to school I have an experience but I'm lacking something and the scriptures told me to come come that I've been invited to ask you and you would not turn me away amen thank God for the invitation to ask you know the last one of the last things I want to say is you know we must go to him because he's the only one that has translation he's the only one that can change us okay in a moment in a weekl number nine in John we'll go to John chapter 6 once again and just read this this would be our last scripture that we read in John chapter 6 let's start there in um verse 32 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from Heaven okay for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said unto him Lord moreover give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and not belied all that the father had given me shall come to me and he that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he had given me I shall lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day amen and the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which came down from heaven and they said is this is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he SA sayith I come down from heaven Jesus therefore answering and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except my Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day it is written in the prophets and that they shall be taught of God and every man therefore that is have heard and have learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of God hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life and I am the bread of life amen praise God do you feel like you you have been built up in the vitamins of God do you know that you're a privileged person you're an individual that has a choice tonight things that you have been fa ing trials circumstance situations you've been holding them in your heart and God is still a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart so as you've come to him tonight don't leave tonight without giving and accepting God for what you need God he will not turn you away in no wise will he cast you out if you're saying oh God I've been believing you for a long time let this be the night that you receive it am let let your faith rise up to the place that it's by his invitation just like with Peter the moment he knew it was God calling him he gave him the faith to step out and the supernatural happen this is not a man speaking so much if if it's God in your heart and God is speaking to you it's God Amen respond to the call amen we'll invite the musicians why don't we stand you know I think we're privileged people when we consider that the Creator God he wanted to be in Fellowship he wanted us to know him in the power of his resurrection you know and to God will never overstep the power that you have to choose okay there's a power of Satan there's a power of God and then there's a power of decision you can tonight consider the thing that's been plaguing you the confusion or the distress or the difficult but God has given us a decision he doesn't want you bound and the word of God is not bound it's not limited to our unbelief God wants to come and meet you where you're at now if God has spoken to your heart and it's not coming to me Jesus said come unto me and I believe like the faith of Abraham you know when he was given the promise in Genesis 12 I just think about it if we're the faith Seed of Abraham and God came to Abraham and he said I will see this is God now saying I am going to perform this it does not have anything to do with you I am going to make you a father of many nations and all a sudden he began to recognize who was talking to him and you know what he did you know what he he he was given an invitation and all of a sudden you know what the old man the old nature you know he he started looking out and he says you know what hey if we're going out into this land and you now we're being driven out to go do this thing hey when we get to the you know where Pharaoh is and stuff just tell them you know you're my sister you know and all of a sudden that nature see but now God is allowing him to be exposed on his side that God's trying to deal with sometimes God's allowing us to expose our other side the the dying character part but oh my all of a sudden when he began to realize it didn't have anything to do with that it had everything to do what God Said and all of a sudden when he began and and God came to him again then he began to make an altar he began to establish Stones Revelations one on top of the other and realize this is the place of my worship God is only pleased by Revelation if God has giving you a revelation place it upon the altar tonight and say God from this day I know I'll be changed I know I'm changed now we don't come here by tradition this is not to gain a carnal knowledge this is to hear from God God speakly to you as an individual and God is looking for you to respond I don't care who's looking I don't care who sees me my God moved on my invitation I invited him to come to be the guest of honor then he turns around as a gentleman and says but I've invited you to come oh my think of it and then just looking at the situation and how God is dealing with Abraham and then all of a sudden they were in a great fellow ship and now he tells him separate yourself he's already laid out the promise I don't want to open the Bible cuz I'll start going again but you know I just think think of it how he's he's wanting to have this fellowship with you that he can reveal that he's a dynamic God that he has supreme authority and if you'll take his word and put it on your lips God will bring it to pass amen let us pray [Music] Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you God that Lord you said you wouldn't leave us as orphans Lord and Lord we needed a guide and you've been so faithful Lord to come again and Lord you've pulled this out of conditions and circumstances Lord that we were in prison to Lord we couldn't worship you in a way that would please you Lord but you've draw us to the Fountain Lord your word said come those that are thirsty and hungry and buy of me without price without money Lord we realize that it was that great death at Calvary that loosed us Lord that we can receive and be identified father we we thank you Lord and Lord we would be remissed if we didn't take an opportunity to say Lord we're coming Lord Jesus I want to say I come Lord and I want you oh God to renew in me oh God let let that mind that was in Christ that thought it not robbery Lord help me oh God to be so identified that Lord you would be oh God manifested to the weary and to the Brokenhearted Lord and that I wouldn't just be looking down to oh God what's the next order of business in my company or what's the next Duty on the list at home but Lord let me come to you to to see what you want done Lord with your word and may I go in the right Spirit Lord may I go in Lord just like that slave Lord that he was alienated he was he was alien and out in some other country but he knew that his father was a king in another land Lord help us to have this kind of character Lord Jesus we know God that there's many getting and doing and stuff that can occupy time but father we realize Lord in all our getting we want to get the character of Christ Lord we know that that's the only thing that we can take with us Lord and the character that you displayed and that you had was to stay with the father's word Lord to serve and to do and to oh God be happy about it and have peace and joy even in the midst of the greatest trial father Lord we're just committing the people their needs pray God that they would leave having received this invitation Lord and that their lives Lord like they can be like a Jacob after oh God wrestling with that angel Lord I'm not going to let you go until I receive that blessing until my walk is changed until you make me a prince with God and change my whole identification Lord no longer a Shyer no longer stealing and negotiating deals Lord help me Father help us Lord we want to be those ambassadors father so want to be re reconciled tonight by the blood of the lamb as we lift you high pray you'd meet every need we just commit the people now to you in Jesus Christ's name

and there's been strength gained for the journey by being in this Fellowship in this meeting tonight Lord as we go from here I pray pray that each one Lord would have drawn closer to you for having
