[35:13] emotional father whether their hearts be
[35:15] burdened Lord let us cast our cares upon
[35:19] you for you car for us we ask you to be
[35:22] with us this evening in Jesus precious
[35:25] and holy name we pray pray amen amen if
[35:30] you have your Bibles let's turn to a
[35:33] scripture and and uh we'll
[35:38] um kind of use this as a a TI poost or I
[35:43] think what they the world calls it as a
[35:46] a a segue right is that what it is where
[35:49] you where you go from one thing to the
[35:51] other you time them together anyway so
[35:55] uh let's just read this and
[35:58] and it
[36:00] says uh in Luke the
[36:03] uh uh 6th chapter and and the
[36:07] 42nd verse or let's start with the 41st
[36:12] verse and he
[36:14] said in Luke uh the 6th chapter and the
[36:19] 41st
[36:21] verse and why beholdest thou the moat
[36:26] that is in thy brother's eye but
[36:29] perceiveth not the beam that is in thine
[36:34] own eye that's a little bit there about
[36:38] self
[36:39] discernment okay
[36:41] neither how
[36:44] castest neither how canest thou say to
[36:49] thy brother brother let me pull out the
[36:53] moat that is in thine eye when thou
[36:57] thyself self beholdest not the beam that
[37:00] is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast
[37:05] out first The Beam out of thine own eye
[37:09] and then Thou shalt See
[37:11] Clearly to pull out the moat that is in
[37:16] thy brother's eye Heavenly Father we ask
[37:21] you to bless this to us this evening in
[37:23] Jesus precious name we pray amen God
[37:27] bless you you may be
[37:29] seated we're just going to finish up the
[37:31] tape this evening and make a few uh
[37:35] comments but uh I I just would like to
[37:39] say this maybe I don't have a uh really
[37:43] have much of a title for today's message
[37:45] but I I think that that scripture uh
[37:50] kind of relates to the principles of
[37:53] discernment you know what the principles
[37:56] are of when you discern if anytime you
[38:00] have discernment the first place it
[38:02] always should start is with yourself you
[38:06] know to take an honest and hard look at
[38:09] yourself and as we uh went through this
[38:12] message we we noticed that brother
[38:15] brandham said uh several things in on
[38:18] paragraph 11 he made this
[38:21] statement he says
[38:25] now now we do have and I think it's a
[38:29] good thing for us as ministers to F to
[38:33] follow our order now he wasn't talking
[38:36] about an order like the order of the
[38:40] Knights of Columbus or the order of this
[38:42] he was talking about a order you know a
[38:46] command by God to do something he says I
[38:50] think it's important we should follow
[38:52] our order when we see such things in the
[38:56] world as we see today and we have an
[39:00] order from God is for the Discerning of
[39:06] spirit try the spirit I believe that's a
[39:11] very good lesson for the church today is
[39:15] to try the spirit of anything have
[39:19] discernment of spirit so that's our
[39:23] order and that's a good order is to try
[39:26] the spirit of everything so now we have
[39:30] the
[39:31] principles of discernment in other words
[39:34] what are you looking for in something
[39:37] you know what is it good I I like to go
[39:41] to the store and when I walk down the
[39:42] store I like to see people reading
[39:46] labels and uh uh and I'm sure they read
[39:49] the label every
[39:51] time but you you wonder what are they
[39:53] looking for you know it's SpaghettiOs
[39:58] you know what do you look for in a can
[40:01] of Spaghetti House you know it just
[40:03] tastes good it's not good for
[40:06] you you know it's a
[40:08] filler but they're looking for the
[40:10] sodium
[40:11] content you know or they're looking to
[40:15] see if it has a glucose or or uh gluten
[40:19] or or something in it you know they're
[40:21] looking for something they're Discerning
[40:23] something because what they're
[40:25] Discerning is trying to figure out what
[40:27] effect it's going to have on them and
[40:31] and that's Discerning of can goods how
[40:34] much greater is the Discerning of
[40:37] spirits in other words what effect is
[40:40] this Spirit going to have on me what
[40:45] what is the purpose of the spirit and
[40:48] everything I always wonder what was the
[40:51] purpose I I I sit back and think of it
[40:54] because I know that God allows things
[40:57] you you understand that's the way God
[41:00] works God allows the law of contrast he
[41:03] allows things to come up to be in
[41:07] contrast he allows a test because a test
[41:11] is what tries you and shows what you're
[41:15] really made out of when you're put to
[41:17] the test you know in other words if
[41:20] everything goes long maybe you're a
[41:22] person that takes the easy way that's
[41:26] just your nature Well when things are
[41:28] easy you're just cruising along
[41:31] everything's good you have fellowship
[41:32] with everybody and all of a sudden
[41:35] things get tough and things get
[41:37] difficult if you take the easy way well
[41:41] we know the easy way the easy way is to
[41:44] listen to somebody on online you know or
[41:48] stream what we say and sit down have
[41:51] your coffee stay at home and stream the
[41:54] hard things to come to the house of the
[41:56] Lord but if you're you're an easy way
[41:58] and then if you have a preacher that
[42:00] might call you out for just sitting back
[42:03] and being afraid of the virus and
[42:05] stepping out of your position in the
[42:07] body and just falling off you know what
[42:09] you do you change the
[42:13] channel yeah one believer ask another
[42:15] believer he says he says have you
[42:17] streaming
[42:19] service and he says yeah streaming
[42:21] service I got streaming service I got
[42:23] Netflix and I've got a hola and and and
[42:27] I I've got something else I mean that
[42:31] that that was his streaming service you
[42:34] know you know are you streaming service
[42:36] yeah I got streaming service I got these
[42:39] things well that's what happens out
[42:41] there you see in other words the church
[42:44] is turned into a TV
[42:46] channel you just you turn this guy on
[42:50] you turn that guy on you turn that guy
[42:52] let me tell you something if you if this
[42:55] little virus
[42:57] that I could testify I got uh uh our
[43:01] brother uh Banks's wonderful testimony
[43:04] how God healed him Moses's wonderful
[43:07] testimony how God healed him uh Banks I
[43:10] got to sit Banks back down I didn't have
[43:12] time to hear his whole testimony so I
[43:14] read the back page and I got the front
[43:17] page and now I'm going to go back and
[43:18] listen to the rest of the book but if
[43:21] that has got you in this condition I say
[43:25] you think this come on is is
[43:30] strong it's going to get a lot worse
[43:33] than this it's going to get a lot worse
[43:36] than this everybody's asking me if I
[43:38] don't take the vaccine what's going to
[43:40] happen well I don't know they may have a
[43:42] guy standing at Walmart only letting
[43:44] people in with a vaccine
[43:47] card you won't be able to get on a plane
[43:50] without a vaccine card they're just
[43:53] conditioning people they're conditioning
[43:56] them get
[43:57] into the condition of
[44:00] compromise and and that's the spirit
[44:04] behind what is happening with this it's
[44:07] the spirit of compromise oh they might
[44:10] act like it's their life but the Lord
[44:12] told us don't be afraid of him that can
[44:15] destroy your life be afraid of him that
[44:17] can destroy your soul that can destroy
[44:20] your spirit that can take the fellowship
[44:23] out of the church and the character of
[44:25] the church a spirit that makes you think
[44:27] it's not important that you're there
[44:29] you're more more important is your job
[44:32] than being at a post of Duty where your
[44:35] prayer might be the difference to save a
[44:42] soul I mean that's that's discernment of
[44:46] spirit that that that's really you know
[44:49] what I mean when it IT crosses the
[44:52] gospel I say one thing about our
[44:54] governor thank God we've got the
[44:56] governor we've got cuz if we would be in
[44:59] Oregon the the governor in Oregon you
[45:02] know and God will deal with her
[45:06] accordingly but she tells everybody call
[45:09] the police on your
[45:11] neighbor right well when this first
[45:14] thing happened we had the police show up
[45:17] someone called the police on
[45:19] us you know what are they gonna
[45:22] do you
[45:24] know the contrast and the conflict is
[45:28] coming because the prophet of God said
[45:31] this is thus sayeth the Lord from the
[45:33] prophet of God anytime the spiritual and
[45:37] the carnal meet there is a
[45:43] clash go look it
[45:45] up that's what he
[45:47] said it it's not going to be
[45:50] avoided but but the the this spirit is
[45:53] already softening you to give you a a
[45:57] way
[45:58] out you know and and I know people are
[46:03] afraid you know I I I I haven't had it I
[46:07] thank God for it I've been around a lot
[46:09] of people that had it I've lived with
[46:12] people that have had it thank God the
[46:15] Lord's been good to
[46:16] me and I may get
[46:19] it if it's my time to go home I'm going
[46:22] to go
[46:24] home but God cannot not take you off the
[46:28] scene until he's done using you so the
[46:31] best safety that you have is to be about
[46:35] the father's business be in service for
[46:39] God and God will protect you because
[46:42] you're fulfilling his word get out of
[46:45] service for God and and I don't care The
[46:48] Watchman watches in vain if God doesn't
[46:51] watch the city if God's not going to
[46:54] save you and God's not going to keep you
[46:56] then you get it and if you do get sick
[46:58] he'll get you through
[47:00] it if he's done with you then what good
[47:04] is it do you to
[47:08] live but we're talking about Spirit and
[47:11] the discernment of spirit and and what
[47:15] the motive and a vector what's that
[47:16] Spirit doing what effect is it having
[47:19] stand back and look at it and and so
[47:22] we're talking about Jesus referred to it
[47:25] as the beam or the so like I would take
[47:28] this scripture and I would say now I I'm
[47:30] talking about the virus and the effect
[47:33] I've got to say what effect is it having
[47:34] on me before I go after you about the
[47:39] effect it's having on you I've got to
[47:41] remove the effect that it's having on me
[47:46] first you see so the beginning of
[47:49] discernment is self
[47:52] discernment and that that's the
[47:55] principle of discern discernment is
[47:57] discernment always starts with self
[48:01] because if you don't start Discerning
[48:04] yourself first You Can't See
[48:08] Clearly to discern somebody else until
[48:12] you understand the process of
[48:13] discernment before you understand the
[48:16] process of effect before you understand
[48:19] what's transpiring and what's going on
[48:21] and what's happening until you take it
[48:24] to yourself you can't See
[48:27] Clearly what effect it's
[48:31] having until you understand the effect
[48:34] it's having on you I'm just using that
[48:36] c19 because it's something that's on
[48:39] everybody's mind it could be a number of
[48:42] things but that's what he said so we see
[48:44] the principle of discernment and he he
[48:47] says it's a good thing for us to follow
[48:50] discernment he said we should never
[48:53] judge a man by the denomination he
[48:56] belongs to we should always judge him by
[48:59] the spirit he has see the
[49:04] spirit and so if we would turn over to
[49:06] paragraph 113 he
[49:09] says he says the other night I made a
[49:12] statement at the pulpit saying this that
[49:15] I would rather see Brotherly Love
[49:18] existing among the church if we didn't
[49:21] have one case of healing or anything
[49:24] else see we must know what these things
[49:31] are
[49:34] for that's a that's a principle of
[49:37] discernment what is this
[49:40] for what's it for what what's what why
[49:44] is this what's it
[49:46] for what you know when we have a special
[49:50] what's this special for why is this
[49:52] person singing this song what words are
[49:55] in it for me
[49:58] you know you look for the you look for
[50:00] the real discernment in it not oh I like
[50:03] that tune I don't like that too and I
[50:05] like that voice I don't like that
[50:08] voice as you know when I grew up and I
[50:10] was a teenager and coming up before my
[50:13] conversion I I I I was a a a a Bob Dylan
[50:19] fan that's everybody knows that about me
[50:21] then knows me and I just liked his voice
[50:23] and I liked his music and and everything
[50:27] and and uh uh you know the other day we
[50:31] were visiting with some friends and so
[50:33] they thought they'd make joke with me
[50:35] and so they put on Bob Dylan singing uh
[50:40] it have a Merry Christmas or something
[50:43] like that some song and I thought you
[50:46] know I understood they were you know we
[50:50] were having fun and everything but when
[50:53] I look back What attracted me to that
[50:56] you know what was it it was the
[50:58] Rebellion it was the difference it was
[51:01] the spirit that it created in me it it
[51:04] allowed me to not to be a part and not
[51:08] conform and everything all that spirit
[51:10] dides is got me in a lot of
[51:13] trouble you know and it would have got
[51:15] me impr prison if the Lord didn't come
[51:18] in and and save me so it's a real it's a
[51:23] real uh important to understand the
[51:26] convers ations that you have with people
[51:28] the fellowship you're in what effect is
[51:31] it having on your
[51:33] spirit you know this is it edifying me
[51:37] do I want to serve God more do I want to
[51:39] read my Bible more and then you when you
[51:42] discern that then you take that back to
[51:44] yourself and you say is my life edifying
[51:48] their life do they want to read their
[51:50] Bible more when they're around me do
[51:52] they they want to serve God more when
[51:54] they're around me do they want to say
[51:56] good things do they want to have
[51:58] Fellowship do they want to have good
[52:00] works so everything that you discern
[52:04] this way has got to come back to
[52:06] yourself you've got to this is a
[52:08] beautiful principle of discernment
[52:11] you've got to take the beam out of your
[52:14] own eye else you will never see clearly
[52:17] to do any good for anybody else there's
[52:21] no need working on somebody if you've
[52:24] got the same problem
[52:27] it just don't
[52:29] help you know it just in fact it it the
[52:33] prophet of God said it's you're better
[52:34] off not having a gift that works the
[52:37] wrong
[52:39] way and then but we won't go there but
[52:42] so that's what it is that love one for
[52:44] another he says now if a man comes and
[52:47] has a great gift no matter if he belongs
[52:50] to our denomination or another
[52:52] denomination so in our case it would be
[52:55] our church or another church or our
[52:58] fellowship or another
[53:00] fellowship you know we so we've got to
[53:03] make it apply to our situation
[53:07] here and he says don't judge him by what
[53:11] denomination he comes from or how he
[53:15] dresses what you want to see is what
[53:20] he's trying to do with that
[53:24] gift what's he trying try to
[53:28] do and then you look at yourself and you
[53:31] say what am I trying to
[53:33] do what am I trying to
[53:37] do do I have anything I'm trying to
[53:40] do and it and he says what he's trying
[53:43] to do with that gift what's the
[53:46] purpose what purpose he has what's his
[53:51] purpose what is it that he's trying to
[53:53] do and we'll get to this principle if if
[53:56] he's trying to take his influence and
[54:04] build no if he's trying to take his
[54:06] influence and he uses influence to build
[54:10] himself a great name out of it I would
[54:13] have discernment a spirit enough to know
[54:15] that's
[54:16] wrong no matter how great a teacher he
[54:19] is how powerful he is how intellectual
[54:23] he is or how gifted how his gift op
[54:26] operates what is he trying to
[54:31] achieve so you know there's a lot of
[54:33] people that can really take the message
[54:35] and they can put it together and they
[54:37] can put it together and let you see
[54:40] things you've never seen before and and
[54:43] just present the argument like you just
[54:45] out out of bounds and everything but
[54:48] when you discern that you can't discern
[54:50] the gift you can't discern how it
[54:53] operates you can't discern how the
[54:56] enticing words are you've got to sit
[54:59] back and say what is the purpose of it
[55:03] what's he trying to build what's he
[55:05] trying to achieve what's it for what's
[55:08] it
[55:09] doing is it building himself is it
[55:12] building a a a this or is it building
[55:16] that uh is it Fame is uh uh what the
[55:22] purpose of
[55:23] it you know I was asked and I I thought
[55:26] it was a very good question someone
[55:28] asked he says are you more popular now
[55:31] now that you're on
[55:33] uh uh
[55:37] streaming and and I thought well I don't
[55:39] know we've got 300 views I said that
[55:44] that's really nothing I said My
[55:46] Testimony has over 20,000
[55:50] views you know what I mean so you know
[55:53] we're not streaming because of that
[55:56] we're streaming to to try to reach out
[55:59] to the people in our church so they
[56:01] don't fall off the face of the Earth
[56:04] trying to get some word out to them so
[56:07] that they can sit there and they can
[56:09] realize really look at my what I'm
[56:13] doing you know examine ourselves make
[56:17] sure that we're removing the beam out of
[56:20] our eye and and and seeing clearly and
[56:23] and and examine Our Lives that's the
[56:25] purpose of
[56:28] it it it it's not to reach out or to
[56:31] share the gospel or or or to go any
[56:34] place else that's not what what we're
[56:36] trying to do we're not trying to build a
[56:38] worldwide following we don't care about
[56:41] that what we ought to care about is our
[56:43] body how's our body doing how's the
[56:46] people that we're concerned about that
[56:49] we have contact the needs that are in
[56:52] our
[56:53] framework you know we're trying to stay
[56:55] together
[56:58] you know I mean we we we took 90 seats
[57:01] out of our our
[57:07] Sanctuary that's from that's where we
[57:10] were before this happened to where we
[57:14] are
[57:15] now and that's because that's the
[57:18] purpose of it is to destroy
[57:21] fellowship and and and you just got to
[57:24] you just got to sit back back and say
[57:27] Lord I'm going to press through this I'm
[57:29] going to do all that I can to serve God
[57:32] I'm going to try to look in what the
[57:33] prophet of God said and do all that I
[57:36] can so we're not here to build things or
[57:39] how great a teacher he is how powerful
[57:41] he is or how intellectual is or how the
[57:44] gift offer it isn't if he's trying to
[57:47] achieve
[57:49] something how
[57:51] is if he isn't trying to achieve
[57:55] something something for the benefit of
[57:58] the body of Christ your own spiritual
[58:02] discernment tell you that that's wrong
[58:06] no matter how accurate how perfect it is
[58:10] it's wrong if it isn't used for the body
[58:14] of
[58:15] Christ now
[58:17] remember the spirit never comes to break
[58:21] things
[58:23] up it comes to unify
[58:26] right to bring people together so you
[58:30] you you You' just got to have that that
[58:33] discernment as got to be working in your
[58:35] heart and then we'll go on he says but
[58:38] if he has a gift of God and he's trying
[58:40] to edify the body of Christ I don't care
[58:43] what he belongs to that's paragraph 16
[58:47] you're not Discerning the man you're
[58:49] Discerning the spirit the life that's in
[58:54] the man
[58:57] can I just say a personal note there's
[58:58] just a very few of us here and I'm sure
[59:01] just a few
[59:07] online I
[59:09] personally have never been
[59:12] moved by a
[59:14] minister that will sit and study in his
[59:18] office and hasn't won one
[59:21] Soul hasn't sat down with a sinner
[59:25] somewhere
[59:26] and got down on his knees and prayed him
[59:33] through that's a person that's building
[59:35] on another man's
[59:38] Foundation but I like to see people you
[59:41] know I've never wanted our church to be
[59:44] a church that was just people that came
[59:47] from some other church that they weren't
[59:49] happy there or or or they they got they
[59:52] like the style of preaching well I don't
[59:55] got that problem with the style of
[59:57] preaching I just thank God that brother
[59:59] Ram's message carries
[1:00:01] us but but but if you don't if you watch
[1:00:06] the life that
[1:00:09] follows you know what I mean if if it's
[1:00:13] never it's if it's not introducing the
[1:00:17] message to
[1:00:18] people we not sitting down giving out a
[1:00:21] book to somebody introducing but you're
[1:00:24] always functioning with within the
[1:00:27] framework of the Believers that are
[1:00:30] around you and all you live for is that
[1:00:32] a
[1:00:35] boy then then you know when you discern
[1:00:38] that and you look it says what's the
[1:00:41] purpose of the
[1:00:43] ministry but I like somebody that's
[1:00:46] willing to counsel somebody sit there go
[1:00:48] out and talk to somebody meet somebody
[1:00:51] at the H shopping center meet somebody
[1:00:55] maybe in the park or I guess if you can
[1:00:57] meet anybody anymore Satan's surely
[1:00:59] trying to get rid of
[1:01:03] witnessing you know a guy ought to wear
[1:01:05] a sign if you come within six feet of me
[1:01:08] you might get
[1:01:11] saved or you might get
[1:01:14] healed you
[1:01:16] know Come a Little Closer you might
[1:01:20] feel you might be
[1:01:22] blessed you know let's muzzle the off o
[1:01:26] the scripture says don't muzzle the ox
[1:01:28] you know but we won't go
[1:01:31] there but that's what he's saying you
[1:01:34] know saying don't get caught up with the
[1:01:36] style of preaching don't get caught up
[1:01:38] with with how emotional and all these
[1:01:41] things look and say what is coming out
[1:01:44] of this what's the fruit of
[1:01:48] this is it is it going outside of the
[1:01:52] cup is the cup overflowing is it flowing
[1:01:57] out to others is there a light being
[1:01:59] shined are are we drawing the uh the
[1:02:03] world or are they seeing you and and
[1:02:07] inquiring what is the hope that's in
[1:02:11] you you know I told a brother and I he
[1:02:13] says there's really nothing more my
[1:02:15] Ministry can do for
[1:02:18] you you've got the Holy Ghost you've got
[1:02:22] complete access to everything that I
[1:02:24] have access to
[1:02:26] you're saved and you're filled with the
[1:02:28] spirit of God I says we can fellowship
[1:02:32] and I can bring to your remembrance
[1:02:34] things but our ministry has got to be
[1:02:37] able to turn
[1:02:39] out and bring what we have to those that
[1:02:43] don't have it you know how many people
[1:02:45] don't really realize that God's A
[1:02:50] Healer somebody's got to tell
[1:02:54] them let it be
[1:02:58] us he said down in
[1:03:02] 16 but if he has a gift of God he's
[1:03:06] trying to edify the body of Christ then
[1:03:10] I don't care what he belongs to you're
[1:03:12] not Discerning the man you're Discerning
[1:03:14] the spirit the life that's in the man
[1:03:17] that's what God told us to do not one
[1:03:20] time did he ever commission to discern
[1:03:23] the man's group but we are constrained
[1:03:27] and commanded by God to discern the
[1:03:32] spirit in the man what he's trying to do
[1:03:36] what the spirit in his life is trying to
[1:03:43] lead him
[1:03:45] to you are commanded by
[1:03:49] God to look and say where is this
[1:03:55] ministry
[1:03:56] trying to take
[1:04:01] me what is the what is going to be the
[1:04:07] result you know I I asked that question
[1:04:10] I thought where what is brother brandom
[1:04:13] trying to bring me
[1:04:16] to and I can say this he's trying to
[1:04:19] bring me to an invisible Union with the
[1:04:22] with the bridegroom he's trying to
[1:04:24] restore the faith in me that the
[1:04:28] disciples had he's trying to to make me
[1:04:31] an effectual Ambassador for the kingdom
[1:04:35] he's trying to bring me to where that I
[1:04:37] don't present a man-made idea that I
[1:04:40] don't present a Creed I don't present a
[1:04:43] Doctrine but I present Christ Jesus in
[1:04:47] the spirit of the word of
[1:04:50] God that's what he's trying to do he's
[1:04:52] not he's not even here to try to build a
[1:04:56] message God took them so that he
[1:04:59] wouldn't increase but he would
[1:05:03] increase it it's so perfect when we we
[1:05:07] discern so we ought to know what is this
[1:05:11] message trying to
[1:05:13] produce it's not trying to produce
[1:05:16] followers it's trying to produce
[1:05:19] effectual workers for the kingdom of God
[1:05:23] men and women that are about God's
[1:05:25] business they have the
[1:05:27] confidence in his word that God will
[1:05:31] keep his word and they have a faith to
[1:05:34] testify to that word and share that word
[1:05:38] because they know they have a god
[1:05:41] that'll back them
[1:05:45] up not just keep telling you what you
[1:05:48] always want to
[1:05:51] hear I should never have to go over
[1:05:54] Malachi 4:5 unless there's young
[1:05:58] Christians in our
[1:06:01] midst the opening of the seals the
[1:06:04] ministry of the son of
[1:06:07] man the reason we do those things is so
[1:06:10] that people could haven't heard and
[1:06:12] their eyes haven't been open can come
[1:06:14] into the revelation of it but those who
[1:06:18] have been
[1:06:20] revelated those that have received the
[1:06:23] power and have the discernment should be
[1:06:25] a about our father's business I'm going
[1:06:26] to close real quick cuz I want to finish
[1:06:28] the
[1:06:30] tape he says and then over
[1:06:34] here he's he's talking he says paragraph
[1:06:37] 17 but what is he trying to do what's
[1:06:41] the purpose of his heart that he's
[1:06:44] trying to get then you can see what's in
[1:06:50] the man's life whether his motive is for
[1:06:55] his
[1:06:56] denomination whether it's for
[1:07:00] hisself whether it's for worldly things
[1:07:04] or whether it's for a big
[1:07:09] name he says what's in his
[1:07:12] heart what's he
[1:07:15] after now remember take that to yourself
[1:07:18] first that's the principle of
[1:07:20] discernment so you're Discerning you're
[1:07:23] Discerning events you're Discerning
[1:07:26] decisions you've got to have decisions
[1:07:29] discernment to make a proper decision
[1:07:32] but all the decision comes back and
[1:07:35] discerns back you know and then in
[1:07:39] paragraph 19 he says now if we'll notice
[1:07:43] the motive and objective of the Old
[1:07:45] Testament prophets then man had one
[1:07:49] objective and that was Jesus Christ they
[1:07:53] had one thing that their whole theme of
[1:07:57] the Old Testament was built to the
[1:08:00] coming
[1:08:01] Messiah that ought to be our whole theme
[1:08:04] that everything's built upon is he's
[1:08:07] coming soon we should get ready right
[1:08:10] Spirit right attitude right motive right
[1:08:13] objective that we should have and just
[1:08:15] this finishing up here in that paragraph
[1:08:18] I believe he
[1:08:20] says he doesn't care he's talking about
[1:08:23] he says but a real Minister a real
[1:08:28] Christian these things the things that
[1:08:30] are he's talking about ministers they're
[1:08:33] the principles of discernment that apply
[1:08:36] back to us he says just take a minister
[1:08:39] today paragraph 21 if he's has the
[1:08:43] baptism of the Holy Spirit and he knows
[1:08:46] that if he preaches the word it's going
[1:08:48] to cut his Fame down it's going to put
[1:08:52] him a little bitty church somewhere or
[1:08:56] maybe out on the street but he knows
[1:08:59] that something in his heart is a burning
[1:09:04] he sees the coming of the
[1:09:08] Lord there's an
[1:09:11] urgency and I hope that that urgency
[1:09:14] sets in us the Lord's coming we're
[1:09:18] convinced he's coming we've seen the
[1:09:20] signs of his coming we've seen the sign
[1:09:23] of Malachi 45 that tells us the great
[1:09:26] and Dreadful day of the Lord's upon us
[1:09:28] and we ought to be convinced and
[1:09:30] concerned and get about our
[1:09:32] business because our
[1:09:38] discernment is
[1:09:40] discerned by our concern in our
[1:09:44] actions so someone who has no
[1:09:47] discernment doesn't feel the coming of
[1:09:50] the Lord's at hand and there's no
[1:09:52] urgency to witness there's no urgency to
[1:09:55] do good works there's no urgency to do
[1:09:58] anything so the lack of discernment
[1:10:01] begins to show up in your
[1:10:06] actions you see
[1:10:09] it okay that's the beam that's in our
[1:10:18] eyes we miss
[1:10:21] it and we're going the world's terrible
[1:10:24] and the world world's crazy and
[1:10:26] everything's coming to
[1:10:31] pass but there's no urgency in
[1:10:36] US you see then then then we can tell
[1:10:41] that we don't have the
[1:10:43] principle of discernment working our
[1:10:47] discernment is really not working
[1:10:49] because true discernment produces the
[1:10:52] life
[1:10:55] I'm just saying that what he said
[1:10:58] there's something burnning in him he
[1:11:00] doesn't care whether he has today's food
[1:11:03] or not no food he doesn't care whether
[1:11:06] he has good clothes he doesn't have good
[1:11:09] clothes the only mindful he's only
[1:11:13] mindful of one thing and that's the very
[1:11:17] life within him crying
[1:11:22] out that's real discernment
[1:11:25] is the life in you you know what the
[1:11:27] life in us should be crying out even so
[1:11:30] come quickly Lord
[1:11:34] Jesus he's trying to achieve something
[1:11:37] for the glory of God and that man in
[1:11:41] doing so will act the very life of the
[1:11:46] spirit that's in him do you follow me
[1:11:50] he'll act it
[1:11:52] out okay so you see what he's saying if
[1:11:55] it if you've got the discernment and
[1:11:57] it's burning in you and you see the
[1:12:00] condition of the world and that spirit
[1:12:03] that discernment is in you the
[1:12:05] discernment that you have will act out
[1:12:09] in
[1:12:10] you oh
[1:12:13] Hallelujah there we
[1:12:15] go now we're getting down to it no
[1:12:18] wonder the prophet saying what the
[1:12:20] church needs is
[1:12:22] discernment they're missing it the
[1:12:25] world's falling
[1:12:28] apart it is like never before is it
[1:12:31] falling
[1:12:34] apart malls are becoming ghost towns
[1:12:38] people are locked in their houses with
[1:12:40] little trucks pulling to their door and
[1:12:42] dropping off
[1:12:48] boxes and thieves driving up and down
[1:12:51] the street stealing those boxes
[1:12:57] I me
[1:13:06] really he lacked it
[1:13:08] out you see he was a true prophet of God
[1:13:12] because he was trying to achieve
[1:13:14] something for the kingdom of
[1:13:18] God so he says here he says I'll say so
[1:13:24] and so and as with his prophecy oh oh he
[1:13:27] would have built he's talking about
[1:13:29] Moses he would have would have been
[1:13:33] world famous but that wasn't in his
[1:13:36] heart that couldn't be in his heart so
[1:13:40] if you see a person with a great grip
[1:13:43] trying to do something to glorify
[1:13:46] themselves your own discernment of the
[1:13:49] spirit tells you that's wrong but Moses
[1:13:53] was trying to achieve something for the
[1:13:55] the glory of God no matter how bad it
[1:13:58] was how evil it looked how much he was
[1:14:02] talked about the spirit in Moses
[1:14:04] directed him straight to the line of
[1:14:07] duty the spirit in him amen and so we'll
[1:14:12] stop there just reviewing the
[1:14:16] thing uh uh you know again when the this
[1:14:21] is paragraph 36 when a man is so
[1:14:24] Anointed with the spirit now let this go
[1:14:28] real deep under the fifth rib on the
[1:14:31] left side so that straight to the
[1:14:34] heart when a man's anointed of the
[1:14:37] spirit of God his
[1:14:39] habits his actions and everything is God
[1:14:44] moving in him sometimes he's
[1:14:48] misjudged but it's God moving in our
[1:14:52] lives well and this is the word where we
[1:14:55] left off and then we'll start the tape
[1:14:57] and it's just 30 minutes and then we'll
[1:14:59] be done but one who had discernment of
[1:15:04] spirit
[1:15:06] knew that that was the spirit of God in
[1:15:09] him crying out and when a man is
[1:15:12] Anointed of the spirit of God he's got
[1:15:15] the action of God and the action of God
[1:15:20] is never to break us up the action of
[1:15:24] God is to draw us together for We Are
[1:15:28] One in Christ Jesus and God's purpose is
[1:15:32] to bring us together love one another
[1:15:37] remember the spirit of God never breaks
[1:15:42] us
[1:15:43] up so you tell me what this spirit is
[1:15:47] out here in the world working it's got
[1:15:51] one motive and objective is to break us
[1:15:54] up
[1:15:55] to scatter the flock and like sheep they
[1:15:59] go astray and they scatter don't think
[1:16:03] that we don't got a
[1:16:04] devil that
[1:16:08] smart he let this old bug out for a
[1:16:12] reason let's have discernment let's pick
[1:16:15] it up now we'll close in I don't know
[1:16:18] what time it is I spoke longer than I
[1:16:20] wanted to but it it service was better I
[1:16:23] wasn't too long this morning morning
[1:16:25] right I did better I I told you i'
[1:16:28] promis I'd work on doing better I just
[1:16:30] got more need more discernment so so you
[1:16:33] pray for me let's finish up now as we
[1:16:36] listen to the rest of discerning of
[1:16:38] spirits God bless
[1:16:41] you then God's purpose is to bring us
[1:16:45] together
[1:16:47] love one
[1:16:49] another now that great prophets we see
[1:16:53] the spirit moving in them Jesus called
[1:16:56] them
[1:16:57] Gods he said they were Gods now when the
[1:17:01] spirit come to them by
[1:17:04] measure but when he come on the one
[1:17:06] Jesus which was the son of God it come
[1:17:09] to him without measure the fullness of
[1:17:12] the godhead bodily dwelt in him for he
[1:17:15] was the perfect
[1:17:18] example he was God of Glory manifesting
[1:17:23] the glory of God to the people God in
[1:17:27] him going about watch his life all the
[1:17:30] Old Testament he was the
[1:17:34] theme of the Old Testament all the old
[1:17:37] prophets back in the Old Testament cried
[1:17:40] out not to themselves they cried out
[1:17:43] under the spirit of God making them act
[1:17:45] like God in so much that they were
[1:17:47] called gods and then the fullness of
[1:17:50] that Spirit was manifested in Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ look at David David when he was
[1:17:56] dethroned as the king of Israel rejected
[1:17:59] by his own people going up Mount olives
[1:18:02] north of Jerusalem and he looked back
[1:18:04] over the city and
[1:18:07] wept because he was rejected
[1:18:11] yes what was it it was the spirit of
[1:18:14] Christ 500 years later the son of
[1:18:18] David Jesus sat on the same Mount
[1:18:22] looking over the city as a rejected King
[1:18:25] and cried Jerusalem Jerusalem how of
[1:18:29] would I have gathered you your different
[1:18:31] denominations and everything as a h does
[1:18:34] are brood but you would not how off
[1:18:38] would I have did it now the same spirit
[1:18:42] that was in David that was manifested in
[1:18:44] fullness in Christ is in the church
[1:18:47] today crying to the
[1:18:49] peoples how off would I have gathered
[1:18:52] you and when you see separation and and
[1:18:55] differences and and Brotherhood broken
[1:18:59] up and Christian Life one against the
[1:19:01] other then it makes the spirit of God in
[1:19:04] your heart cry
[1:19:06] out you're trying to achieve something a
[1:19:09] true prophet of God a true teacher is
[1:19:13] trying to bring the church to a Unity of
[1:19:15] spirit a Unity of spirit that they might
[1:19:19] recognize God Amen trying to achieve it
[1:19:22] no matter what denomination they belong
[1:19:25] to or what about it we have discernment
[1:19:27] of spirit to discern the spirit that's
[1:19:29] in the man to see if it be the spirit of
[1:19:31] God or
[1:19:32] not now we noticed when he was here on
[1:19:36] Earth how he went about doing good I
[1:19:38] noticed another thing that come to my
[1:19:40] mind did you notice when David was
[1:19:43] rejected as king he went out of the city
[1:19:46] and a little Benjamin might benjamite
[1:19:49] which was supposed to have been a
[1:19:51] brother to him should have been sorry
[1:19:53] because he was rejected Ed but what he
[1:19:56] was a man and he drug along
[1:19:59] there with his condition
[1:20:01] throwing dirt on
[1:20:03] David and calling him all kinds of bad
[1:20:06] names and cursing
[1:20:09] him in the name of the Lord cursing King
[1:20:13] David in the name of the Lord this
[1:20:15] little old crippled up
[1:20:17] benjamite watch the spirit of God and
[1:20:19] the spirit of the devil
[1:20:22] working now if you notice he was
[1:20:25] crippled it represents the spiritual
[1:20:27] of the people today that would
[1:20:30] make fun of the true spirit of God in
[1:20:34] Christ manifesting
[1:20:36] itself that was a spirit of Christ and
[1:20:39] David being rejected as a
[1:20:42] king and today when the people make fun
[1:20:45] of the people who has received the Holy
[1:20:47] Spirit and trying to achieve something
[1:20:49] to draw methodists and Pentecostals and
[1:20:51] Baptists and Pentecostals and
[1:20:53] Presbyterians and all together as a
[1:20:56] Unity as a body of
[1:21:00] Christ and they see the spirit work you
[1:21:02] say well look that's a
[1:21:04] Pentecostal away with him I know one run
[1:21:07] off with another man's wife I know this
[1:21:09] and got drunk I know this and did this I
[1:21:11] know this and did that all that but
[1:21:14] they're big enough to hide their own
[1:21:16] things they can hide it but David was
[1:21:21] exposed why he had the spirit of Christ
[1:21:24] in
[1:21:27] him that guard said shall I take the
[1:21:30] head of that dog that would curse my
[1:21:33] king watch the spirit of Christ in David
[1:21:36] let him alone for the Lord has told him
[1:21:39] to curse
[1:21:42] meu do you catch
[1:21:44] that let him
[1:21:47] alone the Lord has told him to curse
[1:21:50] me inste today we don't get up our Fist
[1:21:53] and fight him
[1:21:55] chop his head off yeah get him out he
[1:21:57] don't belong to us let him
[1:22:00] on the Lord has told him to curse me
[1:22:03] that little running along there
[1:22:04] throwing dirt on David that's what they
[1:22:07] do today on the spirit of Christ they're
[1:22:09] a bunch of holy rollers but they're a
[1:22:10] bunch of this there's nothing to them
[1:22:13] there's nothing to Divine Healing
[1:22:14] there's no such a thing as Angels
[1:22:16] there's no such a thing as prophets all
[1:22:18] those things the days of Miracles has
[1:22:19] passed throw in dirt but let them
[1:22:22] on but when David David returned in
[1:22:25] power
[1:22:27] Hallelujah when he come back as full
[1:22:31] king of
[1:22:32] Israel don't worry this Jesus whose
[1:22:35] Spirit we have today acting his part out
[1:22:38] will return again in a physical body the
[1:22:41] second time in glory and power and
[1:22:44] Majesty Hallelujah that little dirt
[1:22:47] thrower fell on his face and beg for
[1:22:50] mercy so let him alone the spirit of
[1:22:53] Christ in US
[1:22:55] don't excommunicate him let's remember
[1:22:57] that all these things has got to come to
[1:22:59] pass we've got one thing to do move on
[1:23:03] God promised that he'd make everything
[1:23:04] work together for good to them at L him
[1:23:07] let's keep the deser of spirit keep the
[1:23:10] objective right we're here to serve God
[1:23:12] each one fellowshipping going along and
[1:23:15] serving God if the man's got the wrong
[1:23:17] kind of an objective then what will
[1:23:19] happen see now we find out that the
[1:23:22] spirit of God was in in him all the old
[1:23:26] prophets spoke of him all the spirits in
[1:23:29] potion every little potion wasn't
[1:23:32] glorifying itself true prophets all the
[1:23:35] true prophets was manifesting him
[1:23:38] speaking of him and everything they said
[1:23:42] was fulfilled in him showed it was the
[1:23:45] spirit of God in them it was fulfilled
[1:23:48] what was it God speaking of
[1:23:50] himself see God manifesting himself
[1:23:53] through these prophets not taking Glory
[1:23:55] who will be the next president who will
[1:23:56] be this and hit you on the head tell us
[1:23:58] who hit you and we'll believe you that
[1:24:00] isn't it it's something to manifest God
[1:24:03] it isn't something to make brother
[1:24:05] weather here or brother Shores or
[1:24:07] brother so and so out there a great man
[1:24:10] make him a greater than the rest of the
[1:24:11] man of his group make him the greatest
[1:24:13] man in Phoenix isn't to make William
[1:24:15] brandom something great but what is to
[1:24:17] do it isn't to make or Robert something
[1:24:19] great Billy Grim something great but
[1:24:21] it's a
[1:24:22] Hearts we're trying to achieve something
[1:24:25] for the kingdom of God it's manifesting
[1:24:28] God all gifts and things doesn't make
[1:24:31] one greater than the other it just makes
[1:24:33] us all working together for the
[1:24:36] Perfection of the body to bring us
[1:24:39] together as one people as a people of
[1:24:42] God but when you see them going contrary
[1:24:45] don't curse them just let them alone
[1:24:48] somebody has to do
[1:24:50] it but wait till Jesus comes in power
[1:24:53] now we see all those prophets speaking
[1:24:56] every one of them was glorifying God and
[1:24:58] the coming Messiah and when they got in
[1:25:01] the spirit they acted and spoke and
[1:25:05] lived the life out just like the Messiah
[1:25:08] did if it did that side the cross
[1:25:11] speaking of his coming how much more
[1:25:14] will it after his coming will put the
[1:25:16] spirit of the Messiah in the church to
[1:25:18] act do work and live like the Messiah
[1:25:22] amen it's a spirit of God God discern
[1:25:25] that Spirit see whether it is of god or
[1:25:28] not see whether it acts like him see if
[1:25:31] your emotions if somebody kicks up
[1:25:33] something against you and throws dirt
[1:25:34] upon your life when you know you're as
[1:25:35] innocent as you can be and you know that
[1:25:38] you got the spirit of God don't try to
[1:25:41] separate yourself don't try to act mean
[1:25:43] towards him don't curse him just walk on
[1:25:46] knowing god did that to give you a test
[1:25:48] to see how you take
[1:25:50] it you'll have to come to it anyhow
[1:25:54] as I said the other day I believe in
[1:25:55] brother Fuller's Church the bicycle
[1:25:58] Rider in Canada well all of them thought
[1:26:00] they could outride this boy this little
[1:26:02] old and he's the only one couldn't
[1:26:04] H ride without holding the handlebars
[1:26:07] I'm glad I like to be one of those
[1:26:08] handlebar Riders take a hold of both
[1:26:10] sides of the Cross and say nothing in my
[1:26:12] arms I bring let me hold to the Cross
[1:26:16] Lord I have no intellectuals I have
[1:26:17] nothing let me just hold here look way
[1:26:21] out down there and they had a 12in plank
[1:26:24] to ride for a city block to get a $100
[1:26:26] swin bicycle all those boys you could
[1:26:29] ride without holding go downtown get
[1:26:30] their mother's groceries and come back
[1:26:32] without even touch the handlebars they
[1:26:33] everyone begin to look they wasn't used
[1:26:35] to holding to the handlebars and they
[1:26:37] fell off but this little old boy got on
[1:26:40] there and helped the handle bars and
[1:26:41] rolled it to the end they asked him how
[1:26:44] did you do it he says here's where you
[1:26:46] make your mistake fellas you're all
[1:26:47] better Riders than I am but you were
[1:26:49] looking here and said it made you
[1:26:51] nervous to see what you're trying to
[1:26:52] balance yourself and you fell off said I
[1:26:54] never looked here at all I watched the
[1:26:56] end and kept steady that's what we're to
[1:27:00] do don't look at these little things now
[1:27:02] did this one do this or that one do that
[1:27:04] watch the end and keep
[1:27:06] studying Christ is coming watch the end
[1:27:10] just keep study don't notice what's
[1:27:12] going on now watch what's going to go on
[1:27:14] out yonder at the end time when we're
[1:27:16] going to have to stand and give an
[1:27:18] account for our lives David wasn't
[1:27:21] watching that little old benjami throw
[1:27:22] dirt on him just crippled anyhow
[1:27:24] he never noticed him he wouldn't even
[1:27:26] let the guard cut his head off let him
[1:27:29] alone God told him to do that God told
[1:27:31] him to curse me let him alone for David
[1:27:33] knew that
[1:27:36] someday Hallelujah he was returning in
[1:27:39] power that Benjamine had have his
[1:27:42] time yes that's it the church will rise
[1:27:46] and
[1:27:48] Triumph is just sent to pray for his
[1:27:50] sick children anyhow that's all I can do
[1:27:52] wherever they are in what church they
[1:27:54] are it makes me no difference I'm trying
[1:27:55] to pray for his sick children trying to
[1:27:58] manifest the gift for his glory that's
[1:28:01] the reason I never did belong to
[1:28:03] anything now remember that's all right
[1:28:04] see I'm not I'm not saying that now I
[1:28:06] want you to get me clear I believe that
[1:28:08] God's got Christians in every Church his
[1:28:11] children he's never questioned me on
[1:28:13] that I just s to pray for the children
[1:28:15] and to do these things and to manifest
[1:28:18] him now you see Jesus and these prophets
[1:28:21] everything that they spoke of had to be
[1:28:23] true true for it was the power of God in
[1:28:27] them God himself speaking through them
[1:28:30] of his own self coming to his own
[1:28:34] Glory who's President who's going to is
[1:28:38] go to uh are we going to have enough
[1:28:39] rain this year I don't mean nothing
[1:28:43] something to the glory of God something
[1:28:45] to set the church in order something for
[1:28:47] the power of God not to make yourself a
[1:28:49] name but to make the glory of God
[1:28:51] manifested now we know no that all those
[1:28:55] prophets and all they said about him
[1:28:57] everything come to true because he was
[1:29:00] the theme of the Old Testament Jesus the
[1:29:03] Messiah coming Messiah was what every
[1:29:06] Prophet looked from from Adam to M Mali
[1:29:11] every Prophet spoke of the coming of the
[1:29:13] Lord each one put his part in because he
[1:29:16] was anointed of God that's all he could
[1:29:18] speak of
[1:29:20] now wish we had more time on it but
[1:29:22] watch everything that they said come to
[1:29:25] pass look at here let's just take some
[1:29:27] of the things the prophet said a virgin
[1:29:29] shall conceive and bear a child did it
[1:29:31] happen sure his name Shall be Called
[1:29:35] Emanuel
[1:29:36] uh Prince of Peace Mighty God
[1:29:39] Everlasting father that's what he was
[1:29:41] exactly the Everlasting father no man
[1:29:43] should be called father on this Earth
[1:29:45] but God is your father all right now
[1:29:47] let's see again he was wounded for our
[1:29:50] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:29:51] iniquity the Chast of our peace of up on
[1:29:54] him with his stripes we were healed
[1:29:56] Pilot's judgment Hall while the very man
[1:29:59] having his back laned like that with a
[1:30:02] cat and n Tail Whip didn't realize that
[1:30:04] the scripture said it would be that way
[1:30:06] they didn't have discernment of spirit
[1:30:08] those priests who said away away with
[1:30:10] him away with him and on the cross when
[1:30:12] they shot out their lips and things like
[1:30:14] that when he heard him crying my God why
[1:30:16] I forsaken me they didn't have
[1:30:19] discernment see they couldn't discern
[1:30:21] the spirit that's what David was
[1:30:22] speaking of and the 22nd Psalm they shot
[1:30:25] out their lip not knowing they were
[1:30:27] doing it just the same as that benjamite
[1:30:28] did to David see he thought David is all
[1:30:31] wrong because he didn't agree with him
[1:30:32] on his principles of running his kingdom
[1:30:34] he didn't understand that it was the
[1:30:36] spirit of God in David doing it that's
[1:30:39] where we must discern today the spirit
[1:30:41] of the man what's he trying to do what's
[1:30:43] he getting at not what group he belongs
[1:30:45] to or what this that or the other
[1:30:48] whether he's a white man black man
[1:30:49] yellow man or whatever he is let's see
[1:30:51] what he's trying to achieve and take
[1:30:52] that see what he's trying to do for the
[1:30:55] kingdom of God he's got Odd Ideas to
[1:30:57] ours that's perfectly all right if he's
[1:30:59] trying to achieve something for the
[1:31:01] kingdom of God discern that in him if
[1:31:03] he's wrong and true in heart God will
[1:31:05] bring him around to the truth of the
[1:31:06] thing after a while let him alone let
[1:31:09] him alone see what he's trying to do now
[1:31:12] we see here then we find out in his in
[1:31:15] his death when he died at the cross and
[1:31:18] crying all the things the prophets spoke
[1:31:20] of it they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:31:23] there it was fulfilled will the prophets
[1:31:25] is right they thought it was themselves
[1:31:27] or cried like it was themselves but it
[1:31:28] was manifested in the cross he uh he was
[1:31:32] uh numbered with the
[1:31:34] transgressors that's what he was done he
[1:31:36] was with the transgressors in his death
[1:31:38] he made his bu with the rich he did he
[1:31:41] was buried in a rich man's grave I will
[1:31:44] not leave his soul he will not leave my
[1:31:47] soul said David the spirit of God in
[1:31:50] David speaking out he will not leave my
[1:31:52] soul in hell neither will he suffer his
[1:31:55] holy one to see corruption like as if
[1:31:57] David would be the Holy One wasn't David
[1:32:00] it was the spirit of God in David crying
[1:32:02] out see the spirit of God in the man
[1:32:05] crying out some of them said listen that
[1:32:06] old hypocrite up there he wasn't it was
[1:32:08] the spirit of God in him crying out see
[1:32:11] the spirit of God manifest itself not
[1:32:14] leave his soul in Hell neither will
[1:32:15] suffer my Holy One to see corruption now
[1:32:17] brethren in closing may I say this our
[1:32:20] time gets away but look may I say this
[1:32:22] in closing with these scriptures here
[1:32:25] let's see if a man that all the Old
[1:32:28] Testament theme was about him all the
[1:32:31] holy prophets Anointed with God's spirit
[1:32:34] if all that and everything that they
[1:32:37] said was fulfilled to the letter exactly
[1:32:40] in him surely that great person called
[1:32:44] the Son of God ought to know how to set
[1:32:46] up the New Testament
[1:32:48] Church don't you believe that amen yes
[1:32:51] he ought to have a conception to know
[1:32:53] how to set up the New Testament Church
[1:32:55] the first thing I want to call your
[1:32:57] attention over here in Matthew 16th
[1:32:59] chapter that when he he is speaking
[1:33:02] there when he come down was talking to
[1:33:03] the disciples he said who does man say I
[1:33:06] the son of man
[1:33:08] am and they said some say you're Elias
[1:33:10] and some say you're so and so and some
[1:33:12] say you're so and so and like that
[1:33:15] different one he said but who do you say
[1:33:17] that I am and Peter said Thou Art the
[1:33:20] Christ the son of the Living God he said
[1:33:23] blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas for
[1:33:26] flesh and blood is not revealed this you
[1:33:28] my father which is in heaven has
[1:33:30] revealed this you and and I say unto
[1:33:32] thee th art Simon or art Peter and Upon
[1:33:35] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[1:33:38] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[1:33:39] now there we're speaking of the
[1:33:41] church now watch closely and if I'm
[1:33:45] wrong God forgive me and you forgive me
[1:33:47] now the the Catholic Church says that
[1:33:50] that was a stone laying there Peter and
[1:33:54] upon Peter he built the church now we
[1:33:57] know that that's wrong we Protestants
[1:33:58] disagree with it but we Protestants says
[1:34:01] it was himself that he built himself a
[1:34:04] church up himself but if you'll notice I
[1:34:07] want to disagree with that friendly it
[1:34:10] wasn't that it was up on the spiritual
[1:34:12] revelation of
[1:34:15] himself Flesh and Blood you never
[1:34:17] learned this in a seminary as good as
[1:34:19] they are you never learned this by some
[1:34:21] church Creed as good as it is is it's
[1:34:24] all right but flesh and blood has not
[1:34:27] revealed this to you it's not an
[1:34:28] intellectual conception of how you make
[1:34:30] your speech how you must buy yourself
[1:34:33] how what great thing you must do here in
[1:34:34] Earth that isn't what it is it isn't
[1:34:36] build a great thing or do a great thing
[1:34:38] what it is is a revelation of the word
[1:34:41] of God he was the word in the beginning
[1:34:45] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:34:46] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:34:48] made manifest and dwelt among us he was
[1:34:52] that was the revelation of the word of
[1:34:55] God the spirit in Peter revealing by
[1:34:59] spiritual Revelation that he was the son
[1:35:01] of God made manifest yes amen the god of
[1:35:05] Glory manifesting the glory of God Upon
[1:35:09] This Rock spiritual revelation of the
[1:35:12] word I'll build my church why if them
[1:35:16] prophets was under God speaking by the
[1:35:19] holy spirit that that was the Son of God
[1:35:21] the same Spirit on this side red feels
[1:35:24] right back the same
[1:35:26] thing you see
[1:35:28] it Flesh and Blood you can't learn it in
[1:35:30] a seminary you learn your get your DD
[1:35:34] and your PhD and LD that all right wish
[1:35:36] I had it that's right but still that's
[1:35:39] not
[1:35:39] it you don't have to have it yet it's
[1:35:42] good to have it you can be this
[1:35:45] plus but if you have to rub out the plus
[1:35:48] take
[1:35:49] this this is that if this ain't that let
[1:35:53] me have this anyhow how I want
[1:35:57] this this flesh and blood has not
[1:36:01] revealed this to you you never learn it
[1:36:03] through the educational line you never
[1:36:05] learn it through denominational lines
[1:36:07] they're fine education denomination is
[1:36:09] fine that's part of it but people are
[1:36:11] laying too much to that and they're
[1:36:13] leaving the spiritual discernment amen
[1:36:16] see flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:36:19] this to you but my Father which is in
[1:36:21] heaven has revealed this to you and on
[1:36:23] this rock I'll build my church and the
[1:36:27] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[1:36:30] we'll never be able to Prevail show they
[1:36:32] would be against it now watch and see
[1:36:34] where the gates of hell is against
[1:36:36] Hallelujah it ain't against the
[1:36:38] denomination the government recognizes
[1:36:41] that it is the world recognizes our
[1:36:44] denominations all of them we have the
[1:36:47] rights each one of us as American
[1:36:48] citizens we have the rights of
[1:36:50] denomination which is fine we appreciate
[1:36:52] that but that's not what the gates of
[1:36:55] hell is against it's against the
[1:36:57] spiritual revelation of Christ being
[1:37:00] here now the same Destiny today and
[1:37:03] forever that's right that's what it's
[1:37:05] against
[1:37:07] it the Gates of Hell shall be against it
[1:37:10] but it shall never Prevail
[1:37:14] hallu there you are spiritual
[1:37:17] discernment regardless of who it is is
[1:37:19] my brother as long as he's trying to
[1:37:21] achieve the same purpose that I'm
[1:37:22] working for let him be Prophet let him
[1:37:25] be Pastor let him be Deacon let him be
[1:37:27] so and so let God honor him this way
[1:37:29] that way whatever it is dis honor me
[1:37:30] whatever he wants to do but yet that's
[1:37:32] my brother hallelujah we're working for
[1:37:35] the same thing we're sending our our all
[1:37:38] of our works into the same Kingdom honor
[1:37:40] he's working for the same thing I am
[1:37:42] spiritual discernment spiritual
[1:37:44] revelation of God look here if you want
[1:37:48] Jesus I preached the other night
[1:37:49] somewhere maybe down there it wasn't so
[1:37:52] from the beginning we have to go back to
[1:37:54] the beginning to find our text now for
[1:37:56] just a moment at the beginning there was
[1:37:59] Cain intellectual build a fine church we
[1:38:03] would say made a fine altar offered up a
[1:38:06] sacrifice prayed sincere gave thanks
[1:38:09] paid his ties everything just as
[1:38:11] religious as Abel was but Abel there was
[1:38:15] no Bible in them days but by spiritual
[1:38:18] Revelation he seen that it wasn't fruits
[1:38:21] of the field that caused us to sin it
[1:38:24] wasn't apples that they
[1:38:27] eat see it wasn't apples Revelation told
[1:38:31] him that and it wasn't the fruits that
[1:38:33] caused him to come out of there it was
[1:38:35] life the separation of life so he went
[1:38:38] and got a lamb and offered it in his did
[1:38:40] by faith which is spiritual
[1:38:43] Revelation amen thank God Hallelujah the
[1:38:48] revelation of God spiritual Revelation
[1:38:50] it was revealed to him it isn't a fruit
[1:38:53] it isn't apples it isn't peaches plums
[1:38:55] and pears it was a separation of life so
[1:38:59] he went and got a life and offered it
[1:39:01] instead of fruits fruits is what you
[1:39:03] your works are your own hands what you
[1:39:05] do there I'll go and build this I'll go
[1:39:07] do this I'll support that that's good he
[1:39:09] had an alar just the same as the other
[1:39:11] did both of them had alers that was good
[1:39:13] but it was a re spiritual revealed truth
[1:39:15] of the thing where the spirit of God
[1:39:18] revealed it up upon that rock the rock
[1:39:21] that Christ died on the rock of agypt
[1:39:23] upon the rock that Abel's lamb died on
[1:39:26] Hallelujah that little Abel as he put
[1:39:29] his hands upon that little lamb and his
[1:39:31] little white wool being bathed as he
[1:39:33] took a a rock that didn't have a lan in
[1:39:35] that day and chopped his Little Neck
[1:39:37] like that and hammered it and the poor
[1:39:39] little thing dying the blood bathing his
[1:39:41] hands and his little wool all bathed
[1:39:43] with blood blading and crying what did
[1:39:46] it speak of the Lamb of God some 4,000
[1:39:49] years later spiritually revealed the
[1:39:52] church turning him down and the people
[1:39:54] call him be elub and a devil because all
[1:39:56] the prophets that spoke out they denied
[1:39:58] the prophets oh he said you build their
[1:40:01] suppers and you put them in there you
[1:40:03] Whited walls he said to them without
[1:40:05] spiritual discernment not knowing that
[1:40:07] that was the Lamb of God that he was
[1:40:09] supposed to be that way and act that way
[1:40:11] because he was fulfilling the word of
[1:40:13] God and the Holy Ghost Church today
[1:40:15] acting the way they do doing the things
[1:40:17] they do they're fulfilling the word of
[1:40:19] God hallelujah you see Peter said on the
[1:40:22] day of Pentecost this is
[1:40:25] that and he said it's un to you and to
[1:40:28] your children and them that's far off
[1:40:30] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:40:32] call them same inspired Prophet said the
[1:40:35] evening light would shine there' be a
[1:40:36] farmer and latter rain together as in
[1:40:39] the days of grace look here what is it
[1:40:41] the farmer rain's coming over and the
[1:40:43] latter rain is pass due then it's lapped
[1:40:45] over it's together the farmer and latter
[1:40:48] rain together the Holy Spirit made
[1:40:50] manifest by the power and the
[1:40:52] resurrection of Jesus Jesus Christ there
[1:40:55] you are coming together the farmer God's
[1:40:58] grace he said as it was in the days of
[1:41:00] Noah his grace was long suffering here
[1:41:04] it is today long suffering a lap over
[1:41:07] brings the cloud from the old days the
[1:41:09] cloud from this day together the farmer
[1:41:11] rain running first the first rain we've
[1:41:13] had now here comes the lad rain coming
[1:41:15] over the farmer rain coming over the lad
[1:41:17] rain East and West meeting together both
[1:41:19] rains falling together Divine Healing
[1:41:21] plus the angel of God revealing the
[1:41:23] secrets of the hearts and bringing
[1:41:24] everything to pass oh look like true
[1:41:28] born children of God would see
[1:41:31] that there you are the spirit
[1:41:34] revealing Revelation that's what Jesus
[1:41:37] said the church would be built upon well
[1:41:40] then somebody might raise up and say
[1:41:41] well sure we so and so we're built up on
[1:41:44] that let's take his word a little
[1:41:45] farther the last commission to his
[1:41:47] church he said go ye into all the world
[1:41:50] and preach the gospel to Every Creature
[1:41:52] all the world how long is to last all
[1:41:55] the world to how many ever creature he
[1:41:58] that believeth and is baptized not the
[1:42:00] church he's a personal pronoun he that
[1:42:03] believeth the individual as David D plac
[1:42:05] said about the grandchildren there's no
[1:42:07] grandchildren in the kingdom of God it's
[1:42:09] children your father was Pentecostal and
[1:42:12] you're just coming here to this church
[1:42:13] because he come here to the leth and
[1:42:15] Garfield received the Holy Ghost this
[1:42:17] brought you in as a grandchild you're
[1:42:19] wrong amen God's got to reveal himself
[1:42:22] to you and no man can call Jesus the
[1:42:25] Christ by intellectual conceptions no
[1:42:27] man can call Jesus Christ because he
[1:42:29] feels sorry for his sins and comes and
[1:42:31] repent no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:42:33] only by the re revelation of the Holy
[1:42:36] Ghost making it KN to him Upon This Rock
[1:42:39] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:42:41] will never against him there's the
[1:42:44] Revelation there it is what he's built
[1:42:46] his church upon who did it Peter no no
[1:42:48] no who did it Christ said the revelation
[1:42:52] of God the the Holy Spirit would bring
[1:42:54] it to you a little while and I'll leave
[1:42:56] you but I'll pray the father and he'll

[1:43:53] to achieve not something for a certain
[1:43:55] purpose to manifest yourself on Earth

[1:44:00] and the glory of his coming to reveal
[1:44:02] and make known his soon appearing now in
[1:44:05] closing we want to think of this Upon
[1:44:08] This Rock I'll build my church correctly
[1:44:11] and then we find out over in John 14:7
[1:44:13] he said this The Works that I do shall
[1:44:16] you do also the works that I do what
[1:44:20] kind of works did he do to make himself
[1:44:21] known you me Remember by Peter don't you
[1:44:24] what we've been talked by Phillip the
[1:44:25] woman at the well predicting it not to
[1:44:28] go to the Gentiles but would be in the
[1:44:29] last days as he said as it was the days
[1:44:31] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:44:33] the son of man there's a revelation
[1:44:35] written in Mysteries like this to the
[1:44:37] outside world to the world that knows
[1:44:39] about but you precious Brethren you
[1:44:41] precious sisters you are not children of
[1:44:44] the darkness you're not children of the
[1:44:46] night but you're Children of the light
[1:44:49] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:44:51] light then we have Fellowship one with
[1:44:53] another while the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:55] God's son cleanses all our sins from all
[1:44:58] of us there you are the Servants of the
[1:45:02] Lord Jesus is I quote my scripture on
[1:45:04] here I got Mark 16 yes Mark 16 he said
[1:45:07] go ye into all the world here's what
[1:45:09] kind of a church he set up the last
[1:45:11] commission to the church go ye into all
[1:45:13] the world preach the gospel to Every
[1:45:14] Creature he that believeth in his
[1:45:16] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:45:19] believeth not shall be damned now look
[1:45:21] here look at the spiritual Des he that
[1:45:22] believeth and is baptized you never
[1:45:24] exactly say which
[1:45:27] way but we want to fuss about that see
[1:45:30] the other thing see he that believeth in
[1:45:32] is baptized shall be saved whatever he
[1:45:36] wants to be baptized that's up to him if
[1:45:37] his achievements for the kingdom of God
[1:45:39] come on brother we're marching on with
[1:45:41] the same Spirit if I'm wrong then you'll
[1:45:43] tell it'll come out that way if you're
[1:45:45] wrong it'll be that but our hearts and
[1:45:47] our motives and our objectives is for
[1:45:49] the kingdom of God you you know we are
[1:45:51] we're pointing to Calvary me and my
[1:45:54] ideas why I got I ain't got a brother
[1:45:56] likes Cherry Pie as well as I do but
[1:45:58] we're brothers see none of them likes to
[1:46:00] hunt and fish like I do but we're
[1:46:02] brothers see what I mean I got my own
[1:46:05] ideas but that don't make him not my
[1:46:07] brother his father is my father his
[1:46:09] family is my family there you are the
[1:46:12] Patriarchs all different one from
[1:46:13] another but there was one father and
[1:46:16] they should work to one thing and they
[1:46:17] rejected the main one in there because
[1:46:19] he was spiritual don't you see it
[1:46:22] Brethren can't you you see what I'm
[1:46:23] speaking of now notice and in closing go
[1:46:27] ye into all the world preach the gospel
[1:46:28] to Every Creature he that believeth and
[1:46:30] is baptized shall be saved he with it
[1:46:34] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:46:37] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:46:40] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:46:42] what is it spiritual
[1:46:44] Revelation they shall speak with new
[1:46:46] tongues if they take up serpents or
[1:46:47] drink deadly things it shall not harm
[1:46:49] them if they lay their hands on the sick
[1:46:50] they shall recover that was what the new
[1:46:53] church was that's the kind of church
[1:46:54] that Jesus Christ this great one that
[1:46:56] all the prophets cried out would do we
[1:46:58] find his Spirit comes over here and
[1:47:00] predicts that his spirit in the people
[1:47:01] come right back and do the things that
[1:47:03] he did May I close in saying this I got
[1:47:06] about a dozen more scriptures here but
[1:47:07] we haven't got the time see but listen
[1:47:09] to this may I close in saying this ever
[1:47:12] true borned again prophet of the Lord
[1:47:15] preacher Sunday school teacher Seer
[1:47:18] Apostle missionary whatever he might be
[1:47:22] his whole whole heart is set and he's so
[1:47:25] filled and Anointed with the spirit of
[1:47:27] God so anointed whatever his office is
[1:47:31] whatever it might be to preach or to
[1:47:32] teach or to evangelize or to see Visions
[1:47:35] whatever it is he'll do it for the
[1:47:37] kingdom of God yes and the spirit of God
[1:47:39] will speak right back through the man
[1:47:41] and manifest it's the kingdom of God
