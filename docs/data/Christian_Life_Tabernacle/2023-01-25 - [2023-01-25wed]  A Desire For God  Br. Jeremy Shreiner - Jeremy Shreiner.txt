in their midst father and here we are father gathered not to see a man gathered not just for vain repetition but we are gathered here that we know that there is a presence here that is greater than any single one of us father and we know when we come into that presence we can't help but feel feel weak like we can't do nothing on our own which is just the truth Lord Jesus we need you Lord more of

father that we have a provided place that we can meet with you and worship you under that shed blood father and without that covering father without that provided place Lord man could never make contact with you but through the love of your son Lord we can Touch the Hem of your garment this evening we can be blessed and we can receive and we can be counseled we can be instructed we can be comforted Lord we can be healed and have peace placed in our hearts we're so grateful for that this evening Lord we just ask you to bless our service this evening with your presence and with the inspiration of your word father and with revelation that we can walk from here closer to you we ask it in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated tonight thank you good amen so um we certainly want to welcome you all tonight as you can see we've been blessed to have brother uh uh Jeremy with us and we're good musicians yet you can go I'm not going to sing um I'm gonna have brother Jeremy sing for me that's good but we want to uh welcome some of his family here uh sister Hannah's with us and where are you sister hen I just are you here okay good to see you again Lord bless you it's nice to have you and then I think Jason and Heather that's Jeremy's little brother I believe where are you Jeremy can I are you here somewhere okay God bless you uh I'm sure if you had this for an older brother you have a spot in heaven for sure you've got character I I they're in I guarantee it and and and then and brother Sean and sister Naomi they're been friends with us for a long time God bless you wherever you are you're happy but uh I I love brother Jeremy I love his spirit I love his ministry I love the dedication that he has to the work that's God has given him uh the humility that he has uh going about the duties you know you meet a lot of people all they're interested in doing is climbing the ladder and uh and I just preach him he's just interested in sharing the gospel with whoever will have ear to let the love of God be shed abroad in his heart uh wherever he comes in contact with and and The more I've had fellowship with him and The more I've got uh to know him the more I like being around him and the more I appreciate them so I really think we're blessed but I do have to admit that I'm jealous of him and some people it's just not fair they can preach and sing both and I I would have been glad to have one or the other but you know I don't have neither really but it really is nice so we're I'm gonna before he comes ministers to us uh I I I'm going to ask him to minister Us in song and and uh I know it'll be a blessing both his singing and his preaching I thought you know brother Jeremy you can create the very anointing that you're going to preach under by singing I thought now that's what I call having the control of his Service as I know it's the Holy Spirit Jeremy you're loved here that's the one thing I want you to know these people love you love you very much God bless you uh thank you the service is yours without fear or favor well I believe that my wife has called with me Ministry so please come to the piano she's she's not going to be left out on this one so um it's a song that I probably have sang here before and maybe you know it I just uh I was gonna try to not sing tonight and so when he said you're gonna sing I had to scramble and this is the first thing that came to my heart it's this old song that's been sung many years in my church and again if you have the words you can put them up there if not that's fine but it's called boundless love unending Joy you do know that one right I probably should have asked that first um are we going to sing acapella but I do want to say that it's a privilege to be here tonight once again to see your wonderful I hope smiling faces maybe some not yet but I I want to ask you the question while she's getting ready to to play this is I know you're here tonight but why are you here ask yourself that question just simple question why are you here perhaps you can come up with an easy answer well because it's the right thing to do well it's Church isn't it I need to be here but really why are you here tonight what do you want to get out of this whether it's your pastor ministering tonight me or another Minister that you have or another evangelist we can't do anything for you we understand it's by the foolishness of preaching the faithful Ministry is important God never did get rid of that we're thankful for that but other other than the fact you are here tonight what do you want to get out of this service tonight and as we sing this song this is just my testimony it's it's uh boundless love unending Joy this is my life the song says it's what I know but I like to add it it's all I know you say what do you mean brother Jeremy you know a lot of things yes I know a lot of things we all know a lot of things but I want this to be the most important thing that we know I can't believe that he selected me and I know we can we can get all spiritual and religious tonight and we say oh it had to be it had to be me I get that but really when you think about our Humanity it's the grace of God that we're sitting here tonight and I just want to give him this opportunity so let's just sing it together if we can boundless love unending Joy this is my life it's all I know lord I can't believe that you selected me Jesus my Lord it's you I owe Jesus my Lord it's you I owe oh and he keeps me when I'm weary he can hear me when I pray he's even there beside me when I fall his love surrounds me even when I go astray I know I'd have to say that he's my home boundless love unending Joy this is this is my life it's all I know and Lord I can't believe that you selected me Jesus my Lord it's you I oh Jesus my Lord it's you I oh oh in my world Falls all around me I call upon his name and just in time he takes me by the head his ways are perfect look just like a son who bore my shame oh when I don't even have to understand sing it boundless love on and being true is this really your life this is my life it's all I know lord I can't believe that you selected me Jesus my Lord it's you I owe Jesus my Lord It's you let's stand together and sing it one more time oh poundless think about that love tonight [Music] unending chore this is our life this is my life it's all I know lord I can't believe that you selected me [Music] meets my Lord [Music] oh Jesus my Lord it's who I oh why she plays that sofa let's bow our heads heavenly father as we come before you this evening Lord I believe that I am standing in front of Believers tonight that this is their life it's an unending Joy Lord yes we're surrounded on every side the scripture tells us these things we father we a forward Lord we see these things but yet they're here tonight and they love you Lord this is their life this is everything I pray tonight that you would do something for every individual father something that I cannot do as a man pray that you'd go into the heart of every person and every believer father if there's someone that's on the fence tonight Lord would you find a way to get to their soul father bring them back to the right side Lord or if there's someone that just needs a touch from you father I pray that the word would penetrate their heart Lord whatever the needs are tonight in the building father you know it that's why we serve you we have confidence tonight that it's already done it's more than a song to The Believer but it's a reality so we surrender our thoughts to you now our intentions father our emotions we give everything to you and ask that you would move in a special way and we ask this in your precious Wonderful Name the name of Jesus the churches together says amen God bless you while you're standing would you mind just open your Bibles to the Book of Genesis chapter 3 I do want to say it's also good to have a few of my folks from Amarillo here with me I can call them all family really I even accept brother Sean and if anyone knows him you know that's tough and it takes the Holy Ghost but if you don't you will learn eventually but no it is a it is it is it is a privilege though to have them here and I know that um I I'm glad to be here tonight and I just trust that the Lord would just bless you verse 16 what we're going to read here is actually kind of the second part is what's what our our foundation is tonight we just want to talk to you for a few moments I understand it's Wednesday and that you're tired just ask God would move in your heart says and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and this is where we want to take our foundation tonight and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee God bless you can be seated this evening trust by the end of this service that this scripture Foundation would would be something that you would understand I want to start with a question tonight just a simple question I don't want to go I just kind of want to be simple if I can for you this evening first of all why or why did Genesis 1 1 have to happen why did God create why did he have to create was there a need was it was it needful that there should be a creation was it needful that there should be light spoken was it needful that there should be an earth and the universe and all of these things now we as Believers we can look to the prophet which is kind of what I want to do in the beginning here I want to read some quotes if you wouldn't mind and brother Branham says what is God God is a great eternal at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even God did you know that God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship Him he lived alone and in him was attributes what is an attribute a thought now now you'll get something that will border on the lesson for tonight notice he was his attributes that was in him now it was in him to be father it was in him to be God it was in him to be son it was in him to be savior it was in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes there is nothing out of order you think God didn't see the end from the beginning certainly he did this is this is highlighted here there's nothing out of order it's just displaying his attributes so we're going to continue this and I'm sorry I didn't tell you where we're at we're in the identified Christ of all ages and 64. it says now God uh is or like a great being in the beginning God see he he wasn't even God to begin with God is an object of worship there wasn't nothing to worship him he was self-existent Elohim and there wasn't nothing to worship him when he created angels then there was something to worship him but in this great God Elohim was attributes there was attributes in there to be God attributes to be father attributes to be sun attributes to be savior attributes to be healer all these attributes was in God and if you've ever got eternal life you were in God's attributes oh my our thought tonight is simply and we're going to continue reading this but our tonight our thought tonight is simply a desire for God and I pray that it would be an encouragement a desire for God so we're we're finding here through our Prophet again that everything is you were in God's thinking now Satan wants to get that out of your head he wants to get that out of your life he wants to get that he wants you to be surrounded by circumstances and forget that you as a Believer was in the mind of God now he might have to breed this with that and down here and and down here like a man making Chimes for the church put in so much brass and so much iron and gets it just at the right pitch the Mulder knows how to put it in if he doesn't he doesn't get the right ring oh I don't care what Satan says it sounds like I want to know what the Mulder says and God knows exactly oh brothers and sisters God knows exactly where you belong and what age you belong in oh Satan loves to throw away am I even here why am I going to this because God knew there had to be a body of people that would be able to handle the pressures of this age that's why you're here God don't make no mistakes Hallelujah I'm getting excited sorry that's just the way it is and therefore if you've got eternal life the word Eternal is something never did begin never can end so whoever you were see you were always were you were God's attributes being displayed a capital w-o-r-d word in the beginning was the word can't you see yourself there brothers and sisters oh Hallelujah my goodness and and the word is a thought made manifest you think it then speak it like I'd say the light I had to think light before Oh My but I had to think light before I said light microphone I have to say or I have to think microphone to say microphone and we are God's attributes displayed so God knows why you're here tonight I asked you do you know why you're here tonight you know Satan likes our minds to get clouded on why we're here and what our purpose is because sometimes we get caught up in the doing of life and we forget the soul of life tonight that's kind of what I want to deal with if you wouldn't would allow me to because I want to get to your heart I want to deal with your heart tonight the word need means it to require something because it is essential or very important that's the word need the word desire is a strong feeling of wanting uh to have something or wishing for something to happen there are many things in life that we need right and there are many needs that are in life say why are you slowing down because I want I really want you to think about it as humans we are without a doubt because it's what we are we are doers it's a in a sense a need we take care of things because we need to right we have careers we have jobs we have hobbies we run companies we have Bible studies we manage households we manage calendars or uh we feed our families we feed our pets or we mow the lawn or we we we buy birthday gifts or we serve we do that's what Humanity does we are full of needs we are a needful people and we are in humanity doers you did something this week whether you liked it or not you had to do something some of you had to fill up the car because it needed it some of you had to feed your children because they needed it some of you had to feed your husband because he needed it you've with me now Ecclesiastes 3 tells us that there's a time and purpose for things for needs in life our marriages see this what I need to do for my spouse as if it is only our duty when we look to God we often carry the same attitude let that sink in what should I do God where do you want me to volunteer how can I get involved in the church how can I make other disciples why should my what should my prayer time look like what does the church need we're doers because that's what we do now I want to just stop there for a minute and say that what I'm saying what we're saying is this is not so much that it's wrong because we need that in the body I said need because we do we need doers in the church if we didn't have doers in the church it would get nowhere but I want us to ask ourselves the question whether you're married tonight it's got to be more than need if you're a deacon it's got to be more than a need if we're a pastor I'm a pastor it's got to be more than than a duty if we're a song leader or if we're just a church member I need to go to church because I just need to the question is is it more than it's it can it be more than just a need because all throughout the gospels we see people asking Jesus what to do I want you to let that sink in I I'm not asking you not to leave tonight and say not to ever ask Jesus what to do but I want you to understand why you're asking the question they ask Jesus what to do they approached Jesus the same way that they would approach the rest of their life the same way you would go to your teacher and say what do I need to do to pass this test they go to Jesus what do I need to do for you the same way that we go to our employ our employer what do I need to do to to be to have better benefits we tend to make our relationship and church the same way what do I need to do to have a better life and instead of instead of saying Lord what you know what let's just look in this and find a question John 6 28 then they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God acts 16 30 and brought them out and said sirs what must I do to be saved Mark a 10 17 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit internal life what do we see here we see the humanity in these questions and again I'm not trying to throw forth discouragement tonight I'm glad that you're here I'm glad that you need Church but I'm asking is there more than that yet if you see the answers that were given through all of all of zire's then are doing I read this question this thought this question and it hit me deeply and the question was is are you feeding or feeding off of Jesus ask yourself am I feeding or feeding off of Jesus I believe uh the one of the the brother that made the prayer tonight mentioned it says Lord we want to we want to sit at your table we want to we want to eat with you Luke 10 38 you know the scripture but let's just turn it together or just follow along it says now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at Jesus feet and heard his word but Martha was cumbered about much serving what does that word simply mean distracted Martha was distracted about much serving and came to him and said Lord Dost thou not care that my sister had led me to serve alone none of y'all have ever been there never okay maybe I lied there because I'm feeling a spirit of agreeance why am I the only one doing this again I want you to understand something I am not trying to downgrade and say that you should be lazy but I'm saying we need to we need to have a different Viewpoint of why we do what we do she was so distracted about it she was she followed Jesus can I say she was a message believer but she became caught up and distracted in the doing and the needs of life and lost the soul of it bid her therefore that she should help me I mean Brother David you need to tell them to come and help me I'm all alone here amen hallelujah and Jesus answered and sent under Martha Martha you are right am I hello somebody help me out here that's not what he said I'm not I guess I am trying to trick you but I want you to give me an answer here Martha Martha you are right thank you Hallelujah you're listening I might have just had to turn it over already Thou Art careful Thou Art anxious and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen the good part now I want you hey if you're thinking carnally tonight you're thinking that Jesus is rewarding laziness because you're still in the carnal mind he's not rewarding laziness he is rewarding the person that is sitting at his feet listening to the word of God which shall not be taken from her now take it how you want to take it but in this line of thought I believe that Mary and Martha are not two different types of people but I believe that they are the same but with a choice just as tonight we are we and it's in a sense we are what we call Believers but we are believers with a choice we can choose to be a believer that is just filled with needs need to do this and need to do this and need but have no desire or no soul in it and then you become weary remember the scripture says be not weary and well doing Kate so you're not just doing it because you have to do it but you do it because there's a burden listen I'm going to tell you there would be a lot of pastors that wouldn't be pastors today if they didn't have the burden because if you think it's just about getting behind a Pulpit and preaching a sermon you got it wrong okay it takes a desire it takes a something that you that that the the normal human being cannot see and you might be their best bud and still can't see what a pastor goes through I don't know where that came from but it went Mary and Martha so listen so either we will be busy feeding God or we will feed on him either we will be distracted with work or we will sit in complete worship either we will come in with our own ideas or we open our hands in complete surrender either we are in charge or we weep at the feet of our master these two women give us a picture of the internal choice that we have anything that we place between us and God is an idol it's idolatry and we found that uh that that even back in the Old Testament because you know the the types and shadows of greater things to come that those remember the the the the the Israelites that were blotted out the tribes why were they blotted out because they were the leaders of idolatry their idolatry blotted them out in the New Testament and you say well I'm a believer I'm a message believer I follow the message they follow the message Judas was a message follower Judah seen the first pull Judas seeing the second Paul Judas was there with the third pull oh praise God we're in the third pool are you so the question is that I want to be more than just someone than just a follower a doer I know listen please be I understand that the Bible talks about being doers all right but I want you to go to the heart of the matter Hallelujah I want you to take note of the deeper aspect of this Jesus didn't say Jesus did not come and say well your working is important thank you for serving me I see how you're giving to the kingdom he said you're worried and upset about many things but few things are needed and indeed only one Mary has chosen what is better and it's not going to be taken away from her see God does not need our help it see you can leave this place carnal be like there it is I don't have to go to church anymore there it is I don't have to to I don't have to help Brother David anymore there it is though you're in the wrong frame of mind he doesn't need our help but he wants our relationship God doesn't need our doing he wants our desire he isn't looking externally at our actions and how hard we're working for the kingdom and steady is looking at our motivation our heart and our hunger for him he doesn't want just our doing he wants our desire notice this you say brother Jeremy I disagree with you on that well I'll give you scripture for it found in Romans chapter 9 verse 30. it kind of it explains it very well it says what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by The Works of the law they so they sought it by works by law by doing so don't bring to God you're doing don't bring to God your legalism don't bring to God how many times you showed to church don't bring to God that you're the biggest highest payer don't bring them to God all these things that you do he wants to see your faith not a faith in a building not faith in a in a in a person but faith in his word his word is capital it's of utmost importance for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone why because it was all law to them Hey listen even the prophet of God made a statement he said their works out did everybody's let that sink in for a minute these these and this is why you can't this is why now again this is just my feeling so just bear with me this is why I'm not the kind of person that wants to sit across the table from a religious person because they'll never understand it they'll never understand because it's all here you cannot debate with religion Jesus did not debate with Satan he just said it is written well you know we have I know of people that are that are at our job and and that and we'll bring something up and they'll say well show me in the Bible and we will and they'll be but still they're not willing to change or tumult to that because their thoughts are greater than God's and to some it's just not revealed so I want to be careful on that too to understand that there are those that are not bride it's a different sermon for itself as it is written behold I lay in Zion The Stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed what are you saying brother Jeremy I'm saying I'm glad that you're here tonight I'm glad that you worshiped I'm saying that your pastor is glad that you're here tonight he wants Church uh he wants his people to come to the house of God and worship God that's his burden as a pastor that's a burden of every Pastor for you to be there and but to have heart when you're here he doesn't want you to just have a position I want you to have heart you husbands don't just need to be a husband by law you wives don't just need to be alive by law we cannot be just pastors by law but by heart but by word what's your motivation see it's not a Pursuit based on works alone but by faith if there is a weakness in your relationship let's look at something if there is a weakness tonight let's just if there's a weakness sometimes we have to be honest with ourselves it is not a change in your prayer time that will make you want more of God but wanting more of God will change your prayer you ever just try oh and make God of all kinds of promises I'm going to do better I'm going to do better it was all mainly up here okay wanting more of God changes your calendar wanting more a God will change your priorities you see it's not a doing problem that makes prayer time boring it's not a doing problem that makes us prefer social media over time in the Bible it's a desire problem I hear it now bless God I'm not on social media so I'm okay no let's just all look at our own lives what is our inward desires or motivations can I ask you that question what is your inner desire and motivation psalms 27 4 One Thing I probably don't you probably don't have to turn there you already know what it is one thing have I desired well but brother Jeremy no no one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after brother Matthew it's more than just doing but it's seeking it's Desiring it's hungering for more one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek him that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple why are you here tonight not to just show up to another church service but I'm longing to be with him I'm longing to be with brothers and sisters of light precious faith I'm longing to encourage God bless you my brother God bless you my sister you have been through some battles this week you have been through some difficult times you have faced sickness you have face death it's wonderful when we can come together in the house of God in the right motivation with the right Heart To Worship the Lord not song leader pump me up but we come with such an atmosphere the song leader don't even know what to do oh Pastor preach me right he can't do it we should come with the desire Lord feed me I want to sit at your feet give me that word I want more than an opinion I want the word of God what's our desire I like this with toes or aw toeser said he says you have exactly as much of God as you want come on let that sing you have a oh I want more of you wait a minute you have exactly as much as you want brother Branham said this and the permanent Church agent says now Jesus knew that there were going to be that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergament church age which was as yet 200 years off from the Patmos Vision he knew that that drift would cause them to go into the Dark Ages he knew that the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word if you leave the word you've left God I'm still here brother Jeremy I didn't say that you were here in church I said did you leave the word well I still read the Bible every day but actually how many people read this Bible I can't really honestly look at you and say that I think the Bible's still the best-selling book there is but it's still pretty good but actually how many have left the word if you leave the word you have left God thus he is presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all or the old churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word oh I read this Sunday and I had to put this in today because it just stirs my heart I want deity in my midst I want him in the midst of my life I want him in the midst of my marriage I want him to miss to my children I want them in the midst of my church I want them in the midst of anything he wants so I have to welcome him in my life not just doing oh how many times was Jesus welcome but he really wasn't you ever been welcomed to a place but didn't feel welcome let's not go there you automatically went to your brain to someone in the church I'll let you take care of that later brother it says if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word it says don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word that's tough brothers and sisters but if you ain't willing to forsake all that's letting something come between you and the word and we all have a punch in our life that we're going to have to go through don't think that you've maybe been there yet I say Let's Fall In Love With Jesus so much in our life let's have such a greater desire for him that way when you do show up on a Wednesday night and it is hard and it is rough and everything's been falling apart there will be such an atmosphere in your presence no more that somebody will walk through those doors that has cursed God that has fallen away from God but there'll be such an atmosphere created in here when the word of God is preached they'll sit in their Pew and they'll accept that word why because there is an atmosphere of love in this place not love accepting the sin but love that brings a correction and a word of God that'll go and it'll cut right to the heart come on let's not let's not carry this with white gloves as a word but let's carry this bare hand and pick up that sword that word of God cut away the things of Life circumcise the heart get rid of all the baggage so we can run this race why because we need a desire for him oh my I'm not even finished with this part of this this quote it's just amazing welcome and receive it don't let never let anyone become between you and that word this which I'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that but here's where I want to get to this part I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst can I can I read that again I really want you to catch it I wonder Church I wonder a Life Tabernacle that's my church I wonder I read this and I asked them the question I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst you want to know if we're not sufficiently impressed we keep seeking for other things to fill the voids we keep seeking for greater emotions or greater this or greater things of the world because we're not impressed with the word of God anymore we look at the pastor as some old Doherty man or the Evangelist that's too young of a man and we're not impressed with the word of God I say fall in love with Jesus again and let the word be the impression in your heart bring back the word bare-handed with hands that are holy because of God I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm not trying to be mean but I love this word and I want to love it more oh I can you love it more absolutely hey this might not be your marriage but I'm going to tell you if my wife and I have been married 20 years now right 20 years and it's gotten better it gets it it's good that's the truth what is that and I think the same way with our relationship with God if you don't love him more today than you did yesterday something's wrong somewhere oh we need to fall in love with him again and you're not going to fall in love with him again by outward acts but you're going to fall in love with him by going back to his love letter what is he saying you you're here for a reason he has a purpose for you in your life and it's not to just be a Pew warmer all right all right I'm going to be carner with you and be honest with you it's very true you can live your life on Earth without him you can true story if y'all didn't hear what he said he said the reward's not good it's a true story but I want to be real with you you can if you want to and you might crucify me for this but it's going to be true if you want to walk away from this your life may become easier oh you've heard it before they've come to you all my life oh man all the oppression is gone nobody's condemning me oh oh yeah what a wonderful yeah it's just great okay wonderful okay fine Just Walk On By oh help me Lord I want to go somewhere so bad we should not congratulate sin we need to be careful with that we need to stand on the word of God love the word so much let me ask you do you love him so much that you wouldn't want someone spitting on your husband remember what our scripture was in the beginning and thy desire shall be to thy husband where's your desire tonight well a desire well your sister will desire is to my husband now it's not what I asked brothers would say oh my desires to my spouse that's not what I'm asking I believe you should have that but where's your desires at tonight you can run off you can live it up we've seen it we've got family that's done it right breaks every person's heart right but what do you see in their life brothers and sisters I'm talking about those that are sold out what do you see in their life when you see in their eyes hurt pain oh the face might be smiling but there's pain there's sorrow there's heartache there and there is also as our brother just said a reward that is not great you will never be satisfied I want you to understand that your relationship with Christ is more and I want to tie the natural and the spiritual First Corinthians 7 9 says but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is buried for it is better for them to marry than to burn listen if your marriage is built on that it's not going to last long sorry I'm trying to be real but it's truth if your marriage is built on that it's not going to work very good and that's the same way your marriage with Christ should not be built with you well I better I better go to church because if I don't I'm going to end up in hell that's not that's not a good life you know one of that you know one of the most and I'm trying to hurry I lost track of time but do you know one of the most difficult life it is to live and you probably don't know the answer so you beat me to it it's not the life of a True Believer and it's not the life of a full-on sinner than one of the most difficult lives to live is the one that's trying to do both sides it is the most difficult it creates the most difficult atmosphere in a church it creates the most difficult atmosphere in our homes is those that are trying to live Both Worlds can't do it so if you're a relationship for church is if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than burn it's not that way my desire My Desire the scripture says my desire is to my husband oh how I long for him my desire is not to my past my desire is not to the things of the world yes I have a job yes I have to go to school or yes I have to do this yes this and yes this but that's not my life boundless love unending Joy this is my life this is all I know my desire is to the word my desire is to him speak to me Lord I'm here tonight I don't care who stands behind the pulpit but let him speak the word to my life let him speak it to me if it cuts away things in my life Let It Be Lord why because I long for you come on Rebecca's remember what it was like to get off the camel and run to the tents we need some more desires like that where we're willing to run into the tent and meet our husband Psalm 73 25 whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee Mark 12 29 and Jesus answered him the first of all commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord oh my and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind so there is MIND in this the greatest battle ever fought to wear the mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment it wasn't come to church and and show up for the pastor that's not what it's about but love it love him with all of your heart love him with all of your mind come on some of you've had some mind battles already today how many years human don't answer that because you already know you're human now answer it for me how many human I wanted to make sure y'all are still awake why are you human it's the way it is life is that way brother brand I'm typed in a couple places as this old coat one of these days we're gonna get rid of it one of these days there will be no more sorrow and pain but in the beginning God created that means that God has everything in control in the beginning God created to do what to create and bring forth a body that would love him that would worship Him in spirit and in truth they would love him with all of their mind they wouldn't care what the word did to them they would accept it with all of the heart they would fall in love with Jesus they're not falling in love with just a book They're not falling in love with just a tape but they're falling in love with the words that are coming off of that to do what to catch our attention and to pull us out of those things of the world and to draw us into his arms oh draw me Lord draw me Lord and I'll run after thee listen this is not doing this is not just doing tonight not just because you need to this is because you desire to you might have a good voice but you don't need to sing it's got to be desire it's got to be something in your heart you might crucify me for this but I would not say that brother Branham had the greatest of tunes I just that's just my Brother David I love to hear him sing I love to hear him sing the world would say well he couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but he could carry all the soul it needed because he knew what he was singing about and he meant it so it's not about getting up here and putting on a show or putting on a show for the world get it there's entertainment out there that's fine but that's not what it's about it's not about putting together a fines term and that'll get excited at church and make him feel good but it's about bringing forth love and preaching correction and preaching the word of God to do what to draw us closer to him sing it from your heart preach it from your hearts live it with your heart serve with your heart do with your heart live with your hearts let your desire be for your husband and everything else will fade away and Christ is revealed in his own word I believe we're coming to a close now God said if a man was caught in adultery or a woman take them out there and stone them to death that settled at sea if he's even caught picking up a weight of a stick on the Sabbath take him and stone him they live by it then and now see we don't have them kind of laws today but the Christian the church what I'm talking to this morning the law of God is in your heart you see you have no desire to do it you see your desire has changed God knew that it had to be more than just a law of do's and don'ts because they could not do it no matter how much God proved time and time and again I mean literally how many here has ever seen an ocean open up so you could walk on dry ground show of hands but yet you still serve him come on just bear with me for a minute they seen the waters parked they walked across dry land they shouted and did what God Said and the Bible says the walls of Jericho not only fell down but I believe it used the word flat I could be wrong there but somehow it just felt like it's always I love how the word of God is it always just adds something to punch the devil in the mouth if you ever just listen if you ever want to punch somebody in the mouth the devil is that all right okay how do you do it by the word you have no desire to do it you don't have a desire to do sin you don't have a desire to do those things it's inside here you want to keep God's law so perfect no matter what it is God if listen if God needs a doormat at the door he wants you to be the doormat you're so happy to do it oh come on brothers and sisters don't let it just be up here Let It Be In Your Heart Lord if that's what you want me to be if that's what you long for me to be I'll be the best doormat there is Hallelujah whatever God wants you to do that's what you want to do well I wish I could do this and I wish I could do no Lord what do you have for me I want to do it for you because it's God remember the song that we sing when I come into His presence I humble myself I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship remember the end of that course it says for all he's done for me but I like the end but just because he's God it ends with that maybe you don't know the song but at the end it says just because he's God if he never healed again if he never did this again if he never did this again he's already done enough he's done enough for us to fall on our knees and worship him listen worship is different every time it's it shouldn't always just be the same reaction but there's a different presence almost every service sometimes there's a quiet presence sometimes there's a shout in the house sometimes it's just a shedding of Tears sometimes it's just utter silence because you can't even speak such an anointing that comes to the place when the word of God is being preached that you're in awe that he could speak that word to you I'm going to rephrase that he could speak it to me the creator of the heavens and earth oh he doesn't want you to do and do and do and do and do until you die he wants you to live and desire him and he'll give you the strength to do what you need to do in life but let this be the number one whatever God wants you to do you're going to do it Hosea 6 6 says for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and knowledge of God more than burn offerings Cain offered his sacrifice but not his love Saul offered his opinion but I thought it would be better Esau offered his hunger but is there someone tonight that want to offer their love you see I don't love I don't want to just love him because I have to I know I probably say this many times but I believe natural types of spiritual I love my wife and I don't because I I'm wearing a ring there's something inside my heart that draws me to her and I don't not do something out there in the world because I don't want to get caught I don't do it because I don't want to hurt her come on brothers and sisters take it in the spiritual brother Matthew we don't do what we do because it's the law and I don't want to get preached at we don't do it because we don't want to hurt our loving savior that's a desire that's a Heart of Worship it's more than a song oh yes tonight you need him you need Christ for a rapture you need them but isn't it more than that to a believer I want to have more than a need tonight we're going to ask you the question many times we fight in fact we might have another Minister come up and talk about we need the Lord in fact we sing We need you Lord we need you right now there's nothing wrong with that but I wanted to just be more than a fix some of you know what I'm talking about has Church become just a fix a shot in the arm to make us feel good and to make us get to the next service or is it a full relationship see because God's not wanting to just give you a fix but the Bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust so that means he's going to pour out his spirit in this building and whether you're a terror or whether you're wheat you're going to receive it that's why you can't base your relationship on tongues or shouting alone you can't relate some related on Deeds but it's but if you have accepted the word of God not in mind but in heart I want to love him with all of my heart with all of my mind I want to desire him when this service is over and I go to lay my head to rest tonight I want to desire God when I get up tomorrow morning let me desire him even more when I go to the job if I'm cut off and everybody Cuts me off let me desire God more I'm telling you what the more you desire God the more you'll quit Desiring to do the other things let me have more of it the more listen it's a natural it's a common thing the more you love your spouse the less you want to do other things the more you love Christ the more you love his word the less of the other things you want they don't take your life this is your life this has to be all you know let the word be our life can I ask you this question in closing musicians come brother Branham said I wonder if the word sufficiently I'm sorry let me read it correctly I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst because if this impresses us this will impress us enough to not look elsewhere I don't need anything more than his word you know if I have to have his word in some little small shack I'm going to have his word there if I have to have his word over here in Timbuk2 I'm going to have his word there wherever he wants me to be I want his word to be real in my life well if Brother David would do no it's not what Brother David does well if the deacons would be no it's not about the deacons well if my spout no it's not about your spouse it's about me this is funny we're in class this week for some training and I heard something here the other day and perhaps you might have heard it before too and I might not get it correct but it was a story about two shoes and the story involved this this young boy who was on a base how many heard this before and he had to blow out in his tennis shoes well he lived on a base and when how he was raised was he was raised to never complain and to never ask for anything but just to just to take everything that they had and basically it would just wear out so one day uh his uh his shoes just blew out they were they were done and so they went to try to find him some new shoes and I believe the story goes that when they when they found when they took off his other shoe and to try to put it on his feet were were basically all crumpled up like this and so the life of the story goes on and and it goes through life and whatever it is and I'm going to kind of get down to the end to just shut it down he gets down to the very end and the the mother who was talking about it and they were going swimming one day and he took off his shoes and his his feet were perfectly straight and she's like what happened what why how how I mean how did you come to having feet that were all your toes were all crumpled into now being straight out and so it had got to the point where the basically and perhaps Sean could fix this for me later but he basically made the statement he said we had he got a custom to not asking and to not wanting to grow to not wanting change because he was afraid to this is what I got out of it he was afraid to ask afraid to change and by doing it it caused his feet to crumple up because he never changed his shoes so he lived his life in a handicapped position because he didn't want to make a change but whenever he grew up and he had the opportunity and he made the change and he put the right shoes on his feet were able to grow back his toes would be able to come back out and actually be solid and be exactly what he needed to be and I began to wonder how many and I sat there and I know they were trying to put it in for some position for our business but of course me I'm sitting there and I'm catching it spiritual and I'm like dear Lord how often we have just been afraid to ask you and we've crippled our own life because maybe we don't feel like we deserve something or or or something in our life has maybe a situation we've held on to it for so long that it's crippled our relationship we held on to that old thing and it crippled our relationship with God this is what I'm thinking it's like God don't let me hold on to the root of bitterness don't let me hold on to these things these things of the past that have caused me to have a crippled relationship you come to church but you're still wearing the old shoes I say tonight let's take off the old shoes let's take off the old pass let's take off all of those things and say God I just need a touch from you tonight I want to have a desire for you Lord and you're you are a miracle maker you are you are a miracle-working God I want it to be Lord when the word of God is preached that it Pricks my heart right where I'm sitting right now right where you're sitting right now the word is dealing with you brother David's not brother Jeremy's not brother Matthew is not brother Andrew is not all the ministers here is not ever evangelist is not but God is the word is dealing with you it's about our heads why did you come here tonight I hope that question is different now has the word impressed you not brother Jeremy I said the word not just tonight I'm talking about the word in your life are you impressed with the word of God in your midst or are we looking for other things I want you to know you know this you're a Believer tonight that he walks amongst us he's omnipresent omniscient all-powerful and he's here to do what to mend the Brokenhearted touch lies draw us closer to him tonight I don't want you to just sit where you're sitting and and get a fix but Dr Jesus is here tonight and just take this moment to say Lord I want to be impressed by your word in my midst and I want my desire to be to you are you Mrs Jesus tonight perhaps you are Mrs Jesus perhaps you said I do but you've lost track of it you became maybe for a moment just as Peter did when he got out of the boat and he got caught on his circumstance he lost sight of the one who called him out would you get your eyes back on him tonight along with my desire to be to my husband my desire is not to my job my desires not to religion I want more than religion tonight I don't want to just say I'm a message believer I don't want to just see the pillar of fire and the cloud I don't want to just see the Red Sea depart or open up I don't want to just see the Jericho walls fall but I want to make it to my Promised Land I want to take my Mountain I want to take my inheritance and I don't want to fall to idolatry of my mind oh Draw Me Lord do you know that old song will draw me maybe just play that tonight if you're here tonight well I'm just going to ask us all if you can would you mind just standing in his presence oh Draw Me Lord if I'm a young person oh Draw Me Lord if I'm a father or if I'm a mother Draw Me Lord Elder grandparent doesn't matter who we are Draw Me Lord you say well I've been in his presence what does it hurt brother Matthew I believe you like to get in his presence don't you why because we've been there listen if you've been behind the veil in the holy of holies truly you want to go back and you want it more than anything else you want to get back there tonight now some people have their carnal perception of what getting behind the veil is I'm not speaking of that tonight but I'm talking about a stripped-down presence with you and God and nothing else is in the way your girlfriend's not in the way your boyfriend's not on the way your husband's on the way your spouse is on the way your children is not in the way your job is not in the way it's you and God and the world is cut out is there anything wrong with that tonight I don't believe so Lord Jesus as we come to this portion of the service Lord I Thank you for loving us [Music] when we were unlovable when we denied the word the word that was before us Lord oh God we failed it so many times but yet you kept drawing my sheep know my voice oh I'm so glad I know it Lord forgive me Lord for listening to the things of the world or getting caught off but I'm so glad you gave us a prophet in this hour that screamed out get back in line [Music] oh we were walking to the right sound but something got us off a little bit but Lord that word corrects us let the word correct us tonight let us fall in love with that word again just fall in love with it with all of our heart touch every heart every believer here tonight Lord I pray draw us closer to you father let it be more than just a fix tonight but if someone needs a change right where they're standing may they find that change with you if someone needs something cut away Lord may they find it right now I pray Lord Jesus let them trust the word let them trust the word church do you trust him I'm gonna ask you again do you trust him do you trust me yes Lord I trust you he didn't bring me this far to leave me you you're going to get me all the way through I don't know I may all these things may happen but Lord you've gotten it all in control draw me Lord and I'll come running I'll come running after you oh draw me Lord and I'll come running let's just sing if I can I hope we can draw on me [Music] do you mean that do you really mean it tonight please don't let it just be a song he may have to do some cutting are you serious with him sing it one more time if you're serious all of your heart [Music] I'll come running after you oh what would you do it more tonight [Music] one more time time [Applause] [Music] it is you have for me Lord I'm here with open arms foreign [Music] [Music] do you want him to consume you tonight say well I want that fire what does fire do fire burns how many's ever seen a fire in the field and it just burnt that field up back where I'm at from the plains we've had a lot of them it's dry what happens after fire takes over all the planes and it and it burns all the old dryness up and all of a sudden the spring rains come in and you drive by that field it's green what did it have to go through to get that renewing of Fire so when we sing this tonight do you mean it consume me Lord with the fire of your spirit do you mean that you really want that in your life I promise you if you mean that and you allow him to do that your life your presence the presence of God in your life will do so much more than just one one service I want more of him Hallelujah [Music] somebody help me if you wouldn't mind the spirit is [Music] the broken pieces [Music] goodbye [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me be ER oh let's sing it one more time before we turn into our brother consume me Lord with the fire of the spirit all consumers Lord hello [Music] the broken pieces of my life oh let me be used [Music] foreign [Music] you know and the lord gave us a great Secret in life he said take no thought for tomorrow the evil of the day sufficient thereof and leave those things which are behind behind impress for a higher calling and a lot of times you don't let the desire of our heart take over because of the things around us and that's I think our brothers saying a lot to us tonight just let what's in your heart that's all he wants is your heart I've been wanting to sing this song I Don't Know It but they sang it the other night and it blessed me okay it's like I think they call it stay you know [Music] and I think that's like when you desire something that's all that's on your heart yes oh that's on your mind it's all you want and you like that present so much that that's all that you'd like it to be and [Music] that's what I want yes I don't want to be consumed with what I see or do I want to be consumed with that love in my heart help me sin I know [Music] foreign [Music] because of these days [Music] [Applause] [Music] like when I give up everything [Music] my eyes in your presence [Music] cause my heart is burning in your presence [Music] one more Jesus I I want more foreign [Music] this is [Music] let's sing that first verse again [Music] no worries [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] my heart is burning in your presence [Music] foreign [Music] and I would say it was serious but I wrote him and I said the medical world is surrounded by fear but we have a great physician that promised us all things were worked together for good I said he loves you and he'll give you your heart's desire I thought as our brother spoke tonight about desire [Music] where is that desire tonight is it this day where he is or do I need to get home do I need to get here and I just wanted to stay Lord in your presence for a moment so I could bring my friend before your throne and his daughter Lord that he loves my life is not worthy enough to ask I have no works or fruit that's worthy of your attention I have nothing I can present you Lord but the desire of my love in the heart for my brother and his family he's been a real friend to me Lord and I'm asking that the loveness and the kindness that you've shown to mankind over the years that you raised up a Ministry in our day so surrender to you that your deity could actually dwell within them so that we could see the same love the same signs and the same Wonder that we might know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and Lord I beseech that Mercy on behalf of my friend and I ask you Lord if you would administered to his daughter the healing that you purchased by your stripes on Calvary Lord she may not have the faith she may be defeated but Lord you said love was the ultimate victory and Lord I you know my heart [Music] you're the creator of that heart and I ask that you'd go touch them this evening may they have a peace that's your path is understanding Lord of joy unspeakable and may they enter into your rest knowing's all well because you will not leave them nor forsake them because your word promised it in any here this evening Lord at this time that we'd like to lift the need of a loved one before you or even Lord the battle that we have with our own flesh and our own mind but we know our heart we don't desire to be the way that we are and you said you would give us the desire of our heart not the challenge of our flesh not the weakness of our flesh but you would give us the desire of our heart Lord in our hearts always to stay in your presence always to know that you're with us always to know that you're an unchanging God and your words ever true ask you to bless us this evening Lord bless brother Jeremy and the wonderful word he brought us bless the faithfulness of the people or as the song says it's in your presence that families are mentored and bodies are healed the safest lost is saved and the believer can gain power to have victory over this sin that so easily besets us Lord not pour my heart out that we could have the real things of life which is you Lord for there's no life outside you bless us now as we are dismissed and we go or may we stay in that presence Lord I hate to leave it teach me how to take it with me everywhere I go let the love of God may be shed abroad in My Heart by your spirit and we can control the atmosphere and not the atmosphere control us Lord light our candle foreign what you've done for us that it brings us joy in the midst of the storm I thank you for being here Lord forgive me for I'm just so weak and I just need you so much I long for you so much Lord I still want to be like you [Music] promised you'd never leave me or forsake me and you promised if you started to work you'd finish it Lord and I know I never started this I ran from it I didn't even want it [Music] but you wouldn't let me go rather than there may be other people that have been in that place Lord may they know that you'll never let them go because you promised nothing could pluck them out of the palm of your hand we just love you tonight and ask you to bless us and this evening in the hands that were raised and the people
