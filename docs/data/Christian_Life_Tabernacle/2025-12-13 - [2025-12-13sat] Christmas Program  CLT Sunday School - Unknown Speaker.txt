========================================

[music] Good evening everyone. We're just uh grateful to be here this evening as we uh have our Sunday school class give their uh Christmas program. And there's so many good things that come from it when the children work together and they work together as a team. They support one another and they learn uh the benefits of uh participating in something and it takes a lot of effort, takes a lot of love and it takes a a lot of our Sunday school teachers and helpers and everybody donating their time. So the benefits are uh really long-term and uh so we're grateful for it and so happy for it and so every year they come up with some idea and then they work on that idea and they share the parts and everybody cooperates together. So we're going to open with prayer and then we're going to turn it over to brother uh uh Tim Syler. He directs our Sunday school and coordinates everything. And we can see all their handiwork and all their ideas up here. And and uh these are the pyramids. I thought that was quite well done. And and uh so uh we're just going to do that. So let let's all just pray together uh as we bow our heads. Our gracious heavenly father, Lord, we celebrate the time that you chose in your eternal plan to become flesh and dwelt among us. And Father, then to go on to Calvary and pay the price for our sins. And we're grateful, heavenly father, that we celebrate this time of year, this time that you've chosen. and we remember the birth of your son and how marvelous it was. We thank you for your goodness and love to us. We thank you for those Sunday school teachers and helpers who love the children and want to teach them about your our great savior. So, Father, once again, we ask you to smile upon us, to love us, to be here with us this evening, and we're grateful for it. We ask your blessings now in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. This is our precious brother Tim Syler and he's done so much for us and we just ask God to richly bless him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother David. Tim, &gt;&gt; welcome. Welcome. This is uh as he said the 2025 Christian Life Tabernacle Sunday school Christmas program. Uh somebody came up with the idea of a Christmas road trip. We've all been on those road trips. You're riding in the car and it just gets uh long and boring. You think when are we going to get there? And along the way, they recite the Christmas story. So, it's integrated in that. But I tell you, it's been a blessing to see the excitement level, the ferveny, and the dedication of children at such a young age jumping in and doing their part. They really enjoy this. So I hope that the excitement of this and the story itself and the meaning of it can come through and transmit to us and we get the same excitement level. So without further ado, a Christmas road trip, a journey to remember. Lord bless you. Hey, pardon me. By the way, this uh will kind of conclude the Sunday school activities for this year, okay? because of uh the holidays and the set and tomorrow we're going to be doing the singing. There won't be any Sunday school until about January 4. I think that's the date the next Sunday school will be in attendance. Okay. Lord bless you. all Christmas, a time of love and joy, a time of peace and goodwill. A time for decorating and baking and realizing you don't have time to decorate or bake. A time of driving to the mall you didn't realize was still open and not being able to find a parking space. And it's a time for family. Many of us will be hitting the road this Christmas. Going home for the holidays in order to see family and friends we haven't seen in some time. Spreading a little holiday with those we love, if we still have any to spare. The Anderson family is about to start their long journey to grandpa's house. This trip will be proved to be a road trip they won't ever forget. One that reminds them of what Christmas is really all about. Let's check in on the Andersons as they get ready to hit the road. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the last of the bags. We're going to be gone for 3 days, but we have enough clothes and supplies for a month. &gt;&gt; You never know what the weather's going to be like out there, or in your dad's house for that matter. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? &gt;&gt; He goes a little crazy with the the thermostat. [snorts] Last last time we went last time we went to grandpa's house. It was so cold in my room. I had to wear my pa. &gt;&gt; The time before that, it was so hot. I I use a tub of ice cream as a pillow. &gt;&gt; No complaining, everyone. &gt;&gt; Why do we have to go to grandpa's at all? It's Christmas. &gt;&gt; That's why we're going to Grandpa's. It's Christmas. &gt;&gt; But what about all those Christmas presents? We're going to have to wait until after Christmas to open them. No, I packed all of the presents so we can open them at grandpa's. &gt;&gt; What about the singing? The youth group is going going Christmas going through the neighborhood tonight and I'm going to miss it. &gt;&gt; There's a Christmas Eve service at your grandfather's church. You'll have plenty of chances to sing. &gt;&gt; What about mom's Christmas cookies? We can't have Christmas without those. &gt;&gt; Of course, I packed by Christmas cookies and left them on the counter. Turn around. We have to go back for the Christmas cookies. &gt;&gt; Look at you all. Christmas isn't isn't about gifts, songs, or cookies. Christmas is about a family. &gt;&gt; You're right. &gt;&gt; I thought Christmas was about Jesus. &gt;&gt; Of course, you're right, Alicia. Christmas is about Jesus. When he when he left heaven and came to earth, he God made sure that he had a family. We need We need everyone in our world to love and care for us. We We know that we belong and we are not alone in this world. So, God gave us a gift to family. &gt;&gt; You're right, Dad. I'm glad I have you, mom, and even Alicia. &gt;&gt; I love you, too, Kylie. And now that group lives all alone in that big house, he needs to do that he still has a family that loves him, that he still belongs. &gt;&gt; That's really sweet, you two. I'm proud of you both. This is shaping up of the start of a great road trip. Where are you going? This is the way we usually go to get there. I'm going back. I'm headed back home first. will kill me if we don't show up without your Christmas cookies. &gt;&gt; The Christmas road trip is nothing new. It started long ago. The first Christmas travelers came from very far away all the way from heaven to deliver some good news. And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from Gon into a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin, a spouse to a man whose name was Joseph, the house of David, and the verdant's name was Mary. [snorts] And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast her mind what manner of solution this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favor with God. And behold, thy shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus. And he shall be great, and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. And the and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then Mary said unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel said, angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold, the handmade of the Lord, it be unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was. &gt;&gt; Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph, her husband, being just a man, and not willing to make her a public example, was mighty to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thy son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife. For that which is conceived in her is the Holy Ghost, and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be the child and bring forth the son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife, and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus. Oh. Oh, there's one from Kansas. I just Kansas. I just need um one from Hawaii, Alaska, and Vermont. And I'll win license plate bingo. &gt;&gt; That's nice, Mom. &gt;&gt; Hooray. &gt;&gt; You two are way behind. It's almost like you're not even trying to win. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think they are. &gt;&gt; Okay, so you're obviously bored with license plate bingo. We can sing Christmas songs. &gt;&gt; How much longer until we get there? Kylie, don't ask that again. &gt;&gt; We will get &gt;&gt; get there when we get there. &gt;&gt; How on earth can you to be bored? Look at the wonderful sides we are encountering on this journey. &gt;&gt; What sides? &gt;&gt; Why? There's a ferocious mountain line. &gt;&gt; That's a cat in someone's yard. &gt;&gt; And 2 minutes ago, we passed a mighty Amazon River. &gt;&gt; You mean that bridge that run over that little creek? &gt;&gt; And up ahead, I could see the Eiffel Tower. &gt;&gt; The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, dear. What do you call that then? &gt;&gt; A weird looking tree. Ah, forget it. The Christmas tradition sizing has totally un has totally lost on you all. &gt;&gt; Since when is sight seeing a Christmas Christmas tradition? &gt;&gt; Since first Christmas. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; An angel appeared in the an angel appeared in the shepherds followed by a whole company of heavenly hosts. That must have been quite a sight. &gt;&gt; Sure. And when the shepherds went to Bethlehem, they saw the greatest side of all, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. Jesus was God's gift to us. He sent his son to us so so we so we could have the gift of the family. &gt;&gt; That must have been quite sad for the shepherds to see the savior of the world as a little baby. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's good to just sit back and relax and enjoy the sight. &gt;&gt; I see. We're driving up the Grand Canyon right now. &gt;&gt; What Grand Canyon? Bottle, &gt;&gt; what sites are you seeing this Christmas? Or better still, who do you have your sight set on? Now, Mary and Joseph start out on their own road trip. And it came pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made in Sierra the governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed everyone into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was he was of the house of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child. And so it was that while they were the days were accomplished that she would be delivered and she brought forth her son her son and wrapped him in a swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. There's still more traveling to be done for our angel friends. They've been really busy lately. They will be joined by a group of shepherds who only have a little ways down the road to get to their destination. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around shone around about them, and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings, for great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior which is called Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find the babe wrapped in a swaddling clothing, lying lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with an angel a multitude of of the heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to glory in the highest and on earth peace God will toward men." And it came to pass as the angels were gone away and for in into heaven. The shepherd said one to another, "Let us go now, go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they known aboard and the saying which was told them concerning this child, and all that they heard, it was it wondered if those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherd returned glorifying and praising God for all for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. Ready? The first thing I'm going to do when we get to Grandpa's house is give him a big hug and say, "I missed you and I love you." The first thing I'm going to do is kneel down and kiss the solid ground and say I missed you and I love you. &gt;&gt; We haven't been in the car that long. &gt;&gt; We won't be too much longer now. Just take this next right onto Highway 17 and then it's a straight shot the rest of the way. &gt;&gt; We do not take the next right. &gt;&gt; That's what the GPS says. &gt;&gt; I've been to my grandpa's house a million times. I know the way to go. &gt;&gt; And there goes our turn. &gt;&gt; That's not our turn. We go down three miles and then we turn left. Not right, left. &gt;&gt; I think the lady who lives in the GPS knows better than you do, Dad. &gt;&gt; There's no lady living in computer. It's just a computer. &gt;&gt; Her voice sounds too natural. She can't be a computer. &gt;&gt; She is. I mean, it's a computer. &gt;&gt; And the computer says we need to make the next available U-turn. &gt;&gt; Shut that thing off. I know the way to go. &gt;&gt; Dad, can I ask you a question? &gt;&gt; Is it about the GPS? No. &gt;&gt; Then go ahead. &gt;&gt; Why don't you have to do the things you tell me I have to do? &gt;&gt; What on earth are you talking about? &gt;&gt; A couple weeks ago, I was complaining about my volleyball coach. I didn't like the play she was calling. Do you know what you said to me? &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I do. You told Kylie when someone knows more than us. We should follow them. Let them show us the way. &gt;&gt; That doesn't sound like me. Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Why don't Why don't I have to follow Coach Benson and you don't have to follow &gt;&gt; I get it. I get it. &gt;&gt; This reminds me of the star. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; The Christmas star. The magi understood that God had placed that star in the sky and so they followed it. God through the star led them straight to Jesus. We don't always know the way we should go, but we can trust God and but we can follow God and trust that he will show us the way. &gt;&gt; That's really nice, Mom. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sweetie. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; What's wrong, Dad? &gt;&gt; Nothing there, Jess. Where's talk about? There should be a talk about right before that turn. Make the next available U-turn. Now you tell me. We are now joined by more travelers on this Christmas road trip. Men who have come from very far away. Magi or wise men from the east. They come bearing gifts to God's gift to us, Jesus. Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, [clears throat] in [snorts] the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is he born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and we are come to worship him." When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded he demanded of them where a Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem, O Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, [clears throat] and thou [snorts] Bethlehem and the land of Judah, art not least [clears throat] among the princes of Judah, for help thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." Then Herod, when he had privy called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared, and he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go search diligently for the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also." When they had heard the king, they departed, and lo, the star which they saw in the east went before them. [clears throat] Till it stood over where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and fell down and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrr. There's a gas station. &gt;&gt; I said no. We have to stick with the plan. &gt;&gt; Come on, Dad. I'm dying back here. &gt;&gt; We went to the bathroom 30 minutes ago. &gt;&gt; She didn't have to go then. &gt;&gt; It's only 1 hour until we get to Grandpa's house. You could go then. &gt;&gt; I'll never make it. Dear, she looks like she's about to burst. We really need to stop. &gt;&gt; This was not the plan. The plan was to stop at 12:15 for lunch, which we did. Then go back on the road at 12:55, which we did. Then use the restroom break between 2:00 or 2:03, &gt;&gt; which we did. &gt;&gt; We did. &gt;&gt; But okay, but hurry. I hate when things don't go to plan. &gt;&gt; When do they ever? &gt;&gt; Most of the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah, right. &gt;&gt; I don't think so, dear. &gt;&gt; What about your plan to lose 10 lbs this year, Dad? &gt;&gt; I'm almost there. Just 50 more pounds to go. &gt;&gt; Or when you plan to fill that bookcase for Kylie's room and the whole thing fell apart. &gt;&gt; She doesn't read very much anyway. Remember when we wanted that house on Sycamore, but someone else got it? &gt;&gt; Our house is better than that one anyway. &gt;&gt; I agree, but that wasn't the plan. &gt;&gt; Much better. Thanks, Dad. &gt;&gt; So, you're saying that things don't really go as planned? &gt;&gt; Sure they do. &gt;&gt; Kylie, we were just telling your dad that things don't always work out the way he intended. &gt;&gt; No, but God's plan never fails. You're right about that. &gt;&gt; It was God's plan to show us his love and uh and make a way to save us from our sin. So, he gave us his son, Jesus. And even when King Herod had a plan to stop him, it failed. &gt;&gt; That's right. And God has a plan for each one of us. And nothing can stop God's plan. &gt;&gt; I think God had a different plan for us than us getting to Grandpa's house. Why do you say that? &gt;&gt; We just got a flat tire. &gt;&gt; Our Christmas road trip has been a happy one. We have met the savior of the world, Jesus, God's own son. But tragedy is just around the corner. We must hit the road again, this time to save a child's life. Others won't be so fortunate. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, [snorts] and be thou there until I bring thee word, for Herod will seek the young child and destroy him." And when he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt. And when they were unto the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, "Out of out of Egypt, I have called my son." There Herod, when he saw that he was mocked, he [snorts] he the wise man was exceeding worth and set forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem. and in all the cost. Therefore, from 2 years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of them, of the wise men. Then was fulfill that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And Rama, there is a voice heard lemonation and weeping in great mourning. Rachel weeping for her children and will not be conformed because they are not. But when Herod was dead, behold, the angel of the Lord appearth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, "Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead, which sought the young child's life." and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel. When he heard that Archus did reign in Judah in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there not staring standing. Being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside to the parts of Galilee. and came dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. He shall he shall be called a Nazarene. Jesus, he made the ultimate road trip, leaving his place in heaven to come to earth. He left his place as God the son to become a baby, the son of Mary and Joseph. His trip would continue as he grew into a man. As he preached about God's kingdom. As he healed and performed miracles, as [snorts] he went to a cross for us. As he died for our sins, as he was placed in a tomb, as he rose again from that tomb to life again. What a journey. How will you be hitting the road this Christmas? Wherever you travel to, whether it's across the country to see a family, across town to see the lights, or across the living room to the kitchen to grab another cookie, we invite you to take that trip with Jesus. He wants to hit the road with you, to be your savior, to shine his light brightly in your heart. Not just at Christmas at Christmas, but every day. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of that light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that light, but sent to bear witness of that light. That was the true light, which lightth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came into his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he the power to become the sons of God, even them that believe in his name, which were born not of blood, nor the will of flesh, nor the will of man, but of God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Let me tell you what I think about him. I think in his birth he was wonderful. Though he came to you by the way of a stable door and went out through capital punishment, yet there's never been a virgin kings, whatever it might be. There's never been a virtue compared with it or never will be. He was a pant born son of a living God when he was born here. When he was in his wisdom, he was natural. There was no one could match it with him. As a preacher, never a man could take back any machine. That's right. As a healer, he was divine. Hallelujah. If there any death, he was my redeemer. Living, he loved me, dying, he saved me, carried, he carried my sins far away. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. When he returned on earth, he looked like God. He acted like God. He said he was God. He lived like God. He preached like God. He died like God. He rose like God. He is God. He was our [music] Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Tell [singing] it on the mountains. [music] The one that we've been waiting for. [music] The [singing] key of our salvation.

And really want to thank and just amazing the uh the work and support of the Sunday school teachers and their helpers, everybody involved. It was uh it was a pleasure just pulling it all together and uh I hope you were blessed and thank you parents for uh for bringing your children to the practices and working with them and all that. It showed tonight I think they did a wonderful job and let's give them one more round of applause. I think it's worth it. [applause] I see brother Adrian here. Thank you for all the desserts. he's always uh coming through for us and uh all the we're uh we're neglecting refreshments tonight. We're going to do this again in the morning and it's already kind of getting late on us. So I say we're going to do this. We're going to do the singing portion of this. We're going to take all this down tonight and restore the pulpit as far as I know. So uh thank you and the Lord bless you and appreciate your attendance and and the Lord be with you and be safe on your travels home. God bless. Amen. Didn't they do great? Amen. [applause] I like that King Herod waving that stick. I thought that was that was pretty good. each of their parts. You know, uh we got we invest a lot in our children and there's no better place to invest and it takes a lot of time. Somebody took a lot of time out of their life to get all these kids I guess has 60some kids right there all working together all doing their part that harmony you know no wonder Jesus said unless you become like little children you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven and and I just thought it was a beautiful example and once again we'd like to thank brother Tim sister Melinda and all the Sunday school teachers and helpers and everybody and And just remember this will be a memory that the children carry in their heart and it was a blessing to me and I appreciate God's love for us that he would send his only begotten son and that he would bring into our lives his love and his joy and also let us know that he has a place prepared for us and we want all our kids to make it. So keep us in prayer. Tomorrow we'll have a wonderful time and I think we just ought to leave it up, brother Tim, for the morning just and it's so beautiful. You've done such a nice job. Brother Tim built all this and and it's just it's just tremendous. It's it's great. &gt;&gt; All right, Sister Man Harland did the Jeep and it looks like it's ready to drive away and and we appreciate Grandpa in the in the story and and everybody. So, let's just pray and have a good and just let's grow in the love of God and let's share what God's put in our hearts with others because one day the curtain of life's going to come down and we're going to rise out of here. Let's close in prayer this evening. Our gracious father, you've been so good to us and to see the children singing with all their hearts and and being so inspired, you know, and when they saw the star, they rejoiced. Father, when I saw your son in my life, I rejoiced. And may each heart in here be blessed this evening. May we have a good night's rest. And Father, may we come back in the morning to worship you. We thank you for the effort. Father, may you reward them a hundfold in this life, in the life to come. Now we ask your blessings on us in the precious and wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are dismissed. God bless you. Thank you so much.
