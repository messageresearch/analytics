[3:18] gracious heavenly father
[3:20] we come before you lord knowing that
[3:22] the only approach we have is through
[3:24] calvary there's no worthiness that we
[3:26] would bring of ourselves there's no
[3:28] works there's there's no words father
[3:31] that would grant us audience with you

[3:34] you sent your son
[3:36] he suffered and died
[3:38] that we would have an approach to you
[3:40] father
[3:41] our confidence is in that price and that
[3:43] sacrifice this morning lord that
[3:47] [Music]
[3:48] you knew each heart that would be
[3:49] gathered here this morning
[3:52] father and as we've tried to incline our
[3:54] hearts to know your will and
[3:56] your thoughts
[3:58] lord we don't know each need that would
[4:00] be represented here
[4:03] lord but we know you care about each one
[4:07] father to
[4:09] the ones we may not even be aware of
[4:11] there could be even those in their car
[4:13] now or
[4:14] those who will leave immediately after
[4:16] service
[4:18] it doesn't matter how small we may see
[4:20] the need father
[4:22] your love towards us is so great that
[4:24] you care about each one
[4:27] lord if we could just seize upon that
[4:30] how much you love us this morning
[4:33] that you desire to feed us that
[4:35] you desire to show us your will and
[4:38] lord we want to have the eyes to see

[4:50] individual that would order our
[4:52] footsteps
[4:54] lord that we could be moved by the
[4:56] things of your kingdom
[4:58] lord there's so much trouble in the land
[5:00] but you said you'd be a comfort you'd be

[5:14] goodness and love that's kept us
[5:16] lord how you've
[5:18] been so long suffering that you
[5:20] haven't rewarded us according to our
[5:22] iniquities but father you've deemed us
[5:24] to be your own to be
[5:27] partakers of your righteousness
[5:29] so lord we ask now as we've gathered in
[5:32] the precious name of our lord and savior

[5:46] so with that father we ask you to have
[5:48] your will and way now we commit each
[5:50] part of this service to you
[5:52] giving you all the praise and glory in
[5:54] jesus christ's name we pray amen amen
[5:59] amen
[6:01] good to be gathered in the house of god
[6:02] this morning amen it's certainly happy
[6:05] to be gathering his presence i know
[6:07] this morning it feels like it was an
[6:09] hour too early it feels like
[6:11] certainly welcome all our visitors as
[6:13] you invite better mike for our song
[6:14] reading and man god bless you
[6:35] good morning
[6:38] we're gonna read psalm 73 this morning
[6:42] this is
[6:44] one of a collection of psalms that
[6:46] wasn't written by david this is
[6:50] this is a psalm of asaph
[6:53] and if you remember asaph was appointed
[6:55] by david
[6:57] to lead the worship in the tabernacle
[7:01] he was the worship leader of the church
[7:06] and as we read psalm 73
[7:09] brother
[7:10] asaph
[7:12] is giving us a testimony of an
[7:14] experience that he had
[7:18] it turns out the brother asaph was
[7:19] struggling with something
[7:22] the chapter starts out in verse one
[7:25] truly god is good to israel
[7:28] even to such as are of a clean heart
[7:32] then it says in verse two but as for me
[7:36] my feet were almost gone
[7:39] my steps had well nigh
[7:41] slipped
[7:43] you know and then as we read on for half
[7:45] the chapter
[7:47] you know we see that brother asaph had
[7:50] become discouraged
[7:52] you know he began to start looking at
[7:54] those around him
[7:57] those that maybe didn't seem to be
[7:59] struggling like he was
[8:02] maybe they were seemed to be living a
[8:04] little bit more of a comfortable
[8:05] lifestyle or
[8:07] didn't seem to have the same struggles
[8:09] that he had
[8:10] seemed to have it easier
[8:12] seems to
[8:14] be more secure
[8:16] seems to just float along
[8:20] and
[8:21] he began to get discouraged by that
[8:24] it says in verse 13 verily i have
[8:27] cleansed my heart in vain
[8:29] i have washed my hands
[8:32] in innocency
[8:34] he began to think maybe
[8:36] maybe i'm missing something maybe i'm
[8:37] fooling myself maybe i'm putting all
[8:39] this effort and struggle into
[8:42] into walking a certain way and it
[8:44] doesn't have to be this hard
[8:47] maybe i'm just making it too hard on
[8:49] myself maybe i'm missing out on
[8:52] something
[8:54] you know maybe if he took a
[8:57] little bit of a bigger job or
[9:00] spent a little bit more time with a
[9:01] hobby or
[9:03] maybe spent more time in finances or
[9:06] investments or
[9:08] maybe built a larger social circle or
[9:11] whatever it took to be just a little bit
[9:14] more comfortable a little bit more
[9:15] successful
[9:17] to feel a little bit more accepted or to
[9:20] be a little bit more secure
[9:23] maybe i wouldn't have to struggle so
[9:25] much
[9:26] while i'm serving god
[9:30] you know
[9:31] brother asap's testimony he gets
[9:34] to this place of discouragement and he's
[9:36] just about to throw in the towel and
[9:38] then there's this
[9:39] verse
[9:40] in verse 17.
[9:43] it says this until i went into the
[9:46] sanctuary of god
[9:48] that's right
[9:49] then understood i therein
[9:52] something changed for brother asaph
[9:56] in the sanctuary of god
[10:00] he began to realize maybe he had his eye
[10:02] on the wrong thing
[10:05] after coming into the sanctuary his
[10:07] testimony
[10:09] changes completely
[10:11] it says in verse 23 nevertheless
[10:14] i am continually with thee
[10:16] thou is holding me by my right hand
[10:19] thou shalt guide me with thy counsel
[10:22] and afterward receive me to glory
[10:26] whom have i in heaven but thee
[10:29] and there is none upon earth that i
[10:31] desire
[10:32] besides thee
[10:35] two totally different witnesses
[10:37] and the difference
[10:39] was the sanctuary of god
[10:43] now keep in mind the sanctuary of god is
[10:45] not a church building
[10:48] or a worship service
[10:51] you know that's this isn't about asap
[10:53] going into church
[10:54] and coming out of a worship service
[10:56] differently
[10:58] this isn't a congregational thing
[11:02] this is
[11:04] the word sanctuary
[11:07] means a special place
[11:09] a place set apart
[11:12] from everything around it webster has an
[11:14] an uh statement which i thought was
[11:17] interesting a place of safety or
[11:19] security a place of immunity from
[11:22] prosecution or enforcement to the law
[11:26] a place with just you and god
[11:32] you know
[11:33] asaph began to find himself where he
[11:35] began to measure his success
[11:38] his security
[11:40] his progress
[11:42] by physical things
[11:45] he kind of looked at physical
[11:47] measurements by his associates by the
[11:49] things that he had
[11:51] or didn't have by the things he had
[11:53] accomplished
[11:54] or didn't accomplish
[11:56] and he began to use a physical measuring
[11:59] gauge
[12:00] to measure
[12:01] whether he was where he needed to be
[12:06] that he was somehow exposed or unsafe or
[12:09] insecure
[12:10] you know it's only human to look at
[12:12] trying to meet your physical needs with
[12:15] physical things
[12:16] we're taught that from the time we're
[12:18] children you know
[12:20] get better education get a better job
[12:22] save up these things have these things
[12:24] and you're more successful you're more
[12:25] secure
[12:26] pay attention to what people think about
[12:28] you how you look all these things
[12:32] and if we're not careful that can become
[12:34] our sanctuary
[12:36] that can become our place of
[12:38] safety that can become the basis
[12:41] of our security even without
[12:43] knowing it
[12:46] that's what asap started to think
[12:48] look at what everyone else
[12:51] has is their safety
[12:53] maybe i'm exposed
[12:57] you see that's what lot did
[13:00] you know he began to establish for
[13:02] himself a place of safety a place of
[13:04] comfort first near and then in
[13:08] the walls of sodom
[13:11] you know it was easier there
[13:14] he surrounded him with
[13:16] surrounded himself with things that
[13:17] secured him
[13:20] that's the problem that the children of
[13:21] israel had in egypt as well
[13:25] you know they weren't held there by
[13:26] physical chains
[13:28] they were held there by the belief that
[13:30] their security and their safety and
[13:32] their comfort were based on building
[13:34] treasure cities for pharaoh
[13:37] and it wasn't until a visitation of the
[13:39] lord
[13:41] came by their way for both of them
[13:44] pulling them out of that
[13:45] frame of thinking and bringing them into
[13:47] the sanctuary of god
[13:50] that they began to have the right
[13:52] approach
[13:55] you know
[13:56] once you find yourself in that sanctuary
[14:01] you begin to realize that none of these
[14:03] physical indicators have anything to do
[14:05] with your security
[14:07] or your comfort
[14:09] or your success
[14:10] or your safety
[14:12] doesn't matter who you know doesn't
[14:14] matter what your social circles are
[14:16] doesn't matter whether you've got money
[14:17] in the bank or not
[14:19] it doesn't matter if you're healthy or
[14:21] not
[14:22] it doesn't matter if you have a nice
[14:24] home or not
[14:26] none of that is a measure of a sanctuary
[14:30] but the sanctuary of god
[14:33] is based exclusively on his presence
[14:37] you know once asaph found himself in the
[14:40] sanctuary of god he began to realize in
[14:42] verse 23
[14:44] who's always been with him holding his
[14:47] hand
[14:49] in verse regardless of the physical
[14:51] circumstances in verse 24
[14:53] that in spite of all his planning and
[14:55] all his effort ultimately it was god
[14:58] guiding his steps
[15:00] and his path
[15:02] and then in spite of all good works he
[15:05] might do
[15:07] it was god making him acceptable in
[15:09] glory
[15:11] the sanctuary of god that place that is
[15:14] not bound by physical circumstances but
[15:17] by his presence
[15:19] so you know as we read psalm 73 this
[15:22] morning
[15:25] you know i would
[15:27] maybe remind you from the testimony of
[15:29] asaph not to get your eyes on physical
[15:32] circumstances in any way good or bad
[15:35] your sanctuary isn't there
[15:38] but in the presence of the lord
[15:40] that sanctuary with him
[15:43] something that only you can do with him
[15:46] find that place and in there
[15:49] is safety security so let's read that
[15:51] together as we read the testimony of
[15:53] asap
[15:55] in psalm 20 73 starting in verse 1
[15:58] truly god is good to israel even to such
[16:02] as our of a clean heart
[16:04] but as for me my feet were almost gone
[16:07] my steps had well nice slipped
[16:10] for i was envious at the foolish when i
[16:12] saw the prosperity of the wicked
[16:14] there are no bands in their death but
[16:17] their strength is firm they are not in
[16:19] trouble as other men neither are they
[16:21] plagued like other men
[16:23] therefore pride capacity them about as a
[16:26] chain
[16:27] violence covert them as a garment
[16:29] their eyes stand out with fatness they
[16:31] have more than heart could wish
[16:33] they are corrupt and speak wickedly
[16:35] concerning oppression they speak loftily
[16:38] they set their mouth against the heavens
[16:40] and their tongue walketh through the
[16:42] earth
[16:43] therefore his people return hither and
[16:45] waters of a full cup are rung out to
[16:48] them
[16:48] and they say how does god know and is
[16:51] there knowledge in the most high behold
[16:53] these are the ungodly who prosper in the
[16:56] world they increase in richness
[16:58] verily i have cleansed my heart in vain
[17:01] and washed my hands in
[17:03] for all the day long have i been plagued
[17:06] and chastened every morning if i say i
[17:08] will speak thus the old i should offend
[17:11] against the generation of thy children
[17:13] when i thought to know this it was too
[17:15] painful for me
[17:16] until i went into the sanctuary of god
[17:19] then understood i therein
[17:21] surely thou did set them in slippery
[17:24] places thou casted them down into
[17:26] destruction how are they brought into
[17:29] desolation as in a moment they are
[17:31] utterly consumed with terrors as a dream
[17:34] when one awakens so o lord when thou
[17:37] awakest thou shalt despise their image
[17:40] thus my heart was grieved and i was
[17:42] pricked in my reigns so foolish was i
[17:45] and ignoring i was a beast before thee
[17:48] nevertheless i am continually with thee
[17:50] thou hast holden me by thy right hand
[17:53] thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and
[17:56] afterward receive me the glory whom have
[17:59] i in heaven but thee and there is none
[18:01] upon earth that i desire beside thee
[18:04] my flesh and my heart fail it but god is
[18:07] the strength of my heart and my portion
[18:09] forever for lo they that are far from
[18:12] thee shall perish thou hast destroyed
[18:14] all them that go a whoring from thee but
[18:17] it is good for me to draw near to god i
[18:20] have put my trust in the lord god that i
[18:22] may declare all thy works
[18:31] [Music]
[18:34] oh there's a country far beyond the
[18:38] stirring time

[29:44] hallelujah then i'll have no
[29:47] fear
[29:49] i will have no fear
[29:54] i got one more rivet across
[29:58] one more batter to climb
[30:02] one more valley that i gotta go through
[30:06] i'm leaving my troubles behind
[30:10] one more battle with the devil
[30:13] and i know
[30:16] [Music]
[30:41] i can't do it
[30:58] for me

[31:54] i'm leaving my troubles
[31:58] [Music]
[32:08] hallelujah
[32:14] the jews
[32:16] [Music]
[32:43] the church
[32:45] um
[32:46] sunday school
[32:48] uh service was just exactly what i was
[32:51] thinking in my mind
[32:52] and the reason why i resolved it
[32:54] resulted to this song um
[32:57] you know
[32:58] trying as much as possible to do the
[32:59] best we can as individuals you know
[33:02] trying to save you know for the family
[33:04] thinking about the future you know what
[33:06] happened you know
[33:07] maybe the worst case scenario what
[33:09] happens if i'm no longer here you know
[33:11] am i getting everything right in the
[33:13] physical realm now
[33:14] um and so we get most of the time i'm
[33:16] talking about myself now we get caught
[33:19] up in that space you know it was like
[33:21] okay i got to take on this job though i
[33:23] got to take them two three four five
[33:24] jobs so i can save for the family this
[33:26] is just me talking now um and then you
[33:29] get caught up in that space that's the
[33:30] only thing you're just thinking about
[33:32] and sometimes you just
[33:33] take the spiritual thing and you put it
[33:35] right there and um you know when things
[33:37] happen you just go to and say okay oh oh
[33:40] god okay uh
[33:41] almost like secondary but which is not
[33:43] supposed to be
[33:45] um and so you know about most of the
[33:47] time when i sit there and just think
[33:49] about it
[33:50] i'll just be like oh god you know can
[33:52] you just help me you know um and so i
[33:55] just went to the song i think that's the
[33:56] only thing i one day at a time you know
[33:59] i just want to take it one day at a time
[34:00] and do the best that i can
[34:03] um
[34:04] i won't fall
[34:15] and i'm just a man
[34:18] [Music]
[34:22] help me
[34:23] believe
[34:25] what i could be
[34:27] and all that i am
[34:33] show me to step away
[34:39] i have to climb
[34:44] lord for my sake
[34:47] teach me to take one day at a time

[55:50] hey man thank you musicians
[55:52] this morning and
[55:54] and uh
[55:56] uh
[55:57] it's already 11 o'clock so we've we've
[56:00] already had an hour of
[56:03] preliminaries but
[56:07] we'll do our best
[56:08] with it and
[56:11] i'm trying to turn my
[56:12] [Music]
[56:13] this thing off this
[56:16] i didn't know i brought it out here
[56:19] all right i think i killed it
[56:21] i'd like to kill them all
[56:24] you love the lord this morning
[56:26] let's stand this morning and turn in our
[56:28] bibles to
[56:30] the gospel of saint
[56:33] john
[56:35] and
[56:38] i'd like to speak
[56:39] this morning if i had a title
[56:43] i'm not good at titles but
[56:46] i think i would probably like to refer
[56:48] to it
[56:49] possibly as the
[56:52] the
[56:54] present tense resurrection
[56:58] the present tense
[57:00] resurrection and this morning
[57:03] i'll try to hurry it it's a
[57:05] it's a little bit of a lengthy lesson
[57:08] but it sure is full
[57:10] of so much meat
[57:12] that i just trust it'll be a blessing so
[57:15] we know this is the story
[57:17] the story in the 11th chapter is the
[57:19] story of
[57:21] of the death of lazarus
[57:23] and how that that they sent a word and
[57:27] it's a beautiful scripture reading
[57:30] um
[57:31] so um
[57:36] we could pick it up here
[57:37] [Music]
[57:38] uh
[57:42] here maybe at the 20th verse
[57:46] and it said then martha as soon as she
[57:49] heard that jesus
[57:50] was coming
[57:52] went to meet him
[57:55] but mary
[57:56] still
[57:58] in
[57:59] but
[58:00] mary sat still in the house
[58:05] then said martha unto jesus
[58:08] lord if thou
[58:10] hath been here
[58:12] my brother had not died
[58:17] but i know that even now whatsoever you
[58:19] will ask of the father he will give thee
[58:23] and jesus said to her thy brother
[58:26] shall rise again
[58:30] and martha said unto him i know that he
[58:33] shall rise
[58:35] again in the resurrection at the last
[58:39] day
[58:41] and jesus now that's her doctrine
[58:45] okay
[58:47] now jesus is going to correct her
[58:49] doctrine
[58:52] i hope that this morning this opens up
[58:54] to us
[58:56] i know i'm not capable of opening it up
[58:58] to you but i just hope the holy spirit
[59:01] does and you'd go back home and read
[59:03] over these scriptures
[59:06] and the sermon this morning
[59:08] jesus said unto her i am
[59:11] the resurrection
[59:13] and the life
[59:15] he that believeth in me though
[59:18] he were dead
[59:21] yet shall he live
[59:24] and whosoever liveth
[59:27] and believeth in me shall never die
[59:31] believe us without
[59:33] this
[59:34] heavenly father we ask me to bless your
[59:36] word to us this morning in jesus
[59:39] precious name we pray amen god bless you
[59:43] may be seated this morning
[59:53] now as we go into the word of god i'd
[59:56] like to
[59:57] say this this morning to start
[1:00:03] we know the word of god is a great
[1:00:05] storehouse
[1:00:07] that
[1:00:08] and we realized that in our day
[1:00:12] there was a promise
[1:00:14] that god would
[1:00:16] fulfill
[1:00:17] the scriptures
[1:00:19] of malachi 4 5
[1:00:22] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 john 14
[1:00:26] and other scriptures pertaining to our
[1:00:29] day
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] so we understand when
[1:00:35] the messenger came
[1:00:38] that
[1:00:40] he was a lot of the time
[1:00:43] on this earth to deliver his message
[1:00:46] and in that message
[1:00:49] was everything that we needed
[1:00:54] but
[1:00:55] i'd like to present it to you this way
[1:00:58] about the storehouse
[1:01:01] because i the lord put this on my heart
[1:01:03] to share with you
[1:01:05] and i think
[1:01:06] it helps increase our understanding of
[1:01:09] where that we are
[1:01:12] we have not missed anything
[1:01:16] we're talking oh i got her i gotta say
[1:01:20] before i get going i'm sorry i want to
[1:01:22] congratulate our brother and sister on
[1:01:24] their 25th
[1:01:26] uh
[1:01:27] wedding anniversary brother sister would
[1:01:29] you stand up so we can applaud you
[1:01:31] before we go forward amen
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:41] so
[1:01:43] when you're born
[1:01:45] into this world as we just saw little
[1:01:48] alex here
[1:01:50] all the food that alex is ever going to
[1:01:53] eat
[1:01:55] is already in this world
[1:01:58] right
[1:01:59] it's it's all all here
[1:02:02] uh but yet he can't eat it
[1:02:06] you understand it's it's there in this
[1:02:09] earth and it's stored up
[1:02:12] it's stored up in the refrigerator
[1:02:15] it's stored up in the freezer it's
[1:02:17] stored up in the gardens it's stored up
[1:02:20] in the supermarket it's there all the
[1:02:24] food is there that he's ever going to
[1:02:27] eat
[1:02:28] but
[1:02:29] he's not able
[1:02:32] to eat it
[1:02:34] anyway because he has to grow into it
[1:02:40] you understand now he gets his food
[1:02:43] through his mother eating and then
[1:02:46] she produces food for him and it was the
[1:02:49] way he developed in the womb but
[1:02:51] everything's there
[1:02:53] but he can't eat it you can't take him
[1:02:56] to bob's right now
[1:02:59] and and and have a nice big
[1:03:02] uh steak
[1:03:04] because he hasn't grown into the
[1:03:07] maturity
[1:03:08] to eat it and to digest it
[1:03:12] so that's what this message did when it
[1:03:15] put it
[1:03:16] in in the in the storehouse he says so
[1:03:20] so you have to grow into it
[1:03:22] and it's the same with the message word
[1:03:25] of god
[1:03:26] it's all stored up
[1:03:28] but we have to grow into it before we
[1:03:32] can eat it
[1:03:33] so
[1:03:34] as we're going along we're not trying to
[1:03:38] go back
[1:03:40] to
[1:03:41] the things that brother branham said and
[1:03:44] figure it out we're not going backwards
[1:03:47] it's there because god always works from
[1:03:50] the standpoint of the spoken word the
[1:03:53] spoken word is the original seed so he
[1:03:57] spoke it and he spoke it and he spoke it
[1:04:00] and he spoke it but when we first came
[1:04:03] into this we were just birthed we were
[1:04:06] babies we couldn't eat these things even
[1:04:09] the scripture said that paul said i
[1:04:11] can't feed you strong meat
[1:04:13] because you're not mature enough even to
[1:04:16] discern between what's right and what's
[1:04:19] wrong
[1:04:22] but we've grown
[1:04:25] and you know so we're growing up so now
[1:04:29] there's going to be things in the
[1:04:32] message
[1:04:34] that are been stored up for us in there
[1:04:38] but that we've now had to grow into
[1:04:41] maturity
[1:04:42] that god can now take these things that
[1:04:46] are in there and and break them to us in
[1:04:49] the form of food and start feeding us
[1:04:54] and making us
[1:04:56] stronger
[1:04:58] so as we we talk about these things
[1:05:00] we're we're not even beginning to speak
[1:05:04] from the standpoint that we've missed
[1:05:07] anything
[1:05:09] you understand we're coming in to
[1:05:12] not new things
[1:05:14] but we're coming into new food for us
[1:05:18] it still comes from the source
[1:05:21] it still comes from the voice of god
[1:05:23] does nothing until he first reveals it
[1:05:26] to his servants the prophets but there's
[1:05:29] we just because we have it written in
[1:05:31] book form and we have it on tape form
[1:05:34] doesn't mean it's been fed to us
[1:05:38] just because it's in the freezer
[1:05:41] or in the refrigerator
[1:05:44] at brother neville's home doesn't mean
[1:05:47] that alex is eating it but it's there
[1:05:50] for him to eat when he comes to that
[1:05:53] place of maturity so i believe that this
[1:05:56] morning where we were many different
[1:05:59] places in the gospel
[1:06:02] and
[1:06:03] and the word of god has different effect
[1:06:06] on your body when you get older and you
[1:06:08] eat it doesn't make you go up it makes
[1:06:11] you go out
[1:06:14] but so
[1:06:15] if you understand that wherever you're
[1:06:18] at
[1:06:19] in your life or in your growth whether
[1:06:22] you're a babe in the lord whether you're
[1:06:24] you you've been serving the lord for a
[1:06:27] while whether you've been a long time in
[1:06:29] the word grew up in it it doesn't matter
[1:06:32] there's food for you in the season that
[1:06:35] you are in
[1:06:36] there's food for you to eat today right
[1:06:40] where you are
[1:06:42] and so you feed a meal out and it has
[1:06:45] different effect on different people
[1:06:48] depending on what that their need is
[1:06:52] and so as we break into this word and we
[1:06:55] begin to look at some of these things
[1:06:57] that our messenger spoke to us in this
[1:07:00] great sermon that we're we're looking at
[1:07:03] it is the rising of the sun
[1:07:07] there's food in there
[1:07:09] and and i believe that we could go
[1:07:12] through it from the front
[1:07:14] of the book to the back of the book and
[1:07:17] there would still be food left in there
[1:07:20] that we haven't even seen or tasted or
[1:07:24] even realized yet but as we mature into
[1:07:28] that place
[1:07:30] god will feed us so he doesn't have to
[1:07:33] speak a new word
[1:07:35] just like he didn't create new food
[1:07:38] whatever was on this earth that god
[1:07:40] placed here man has been eating that
[1:07:43] from the beginning of time
[1:07:47] and it's been feeding us when we were
[1:07:49] babies
[1:07:50] when we were young children when we were
[1:07:52] middle-aged children middle-aged adults
[1:07:55] old adults it's god's word
[1:07:58] and it's there for us this morning so at
[1:08:01] whatever place you are you can delve in
[1:08:04] to this beautiful gospel
[1:08:07] and so we just are going through this
[1:08:10] great message and so
[1:08:12] i just wanted to review just a few
[1:08:15] uh quick statements if i could we're
[1:08:17] going to play 14 minutes this morning so
[1:08:20] maybe i can break it up into four
[1:08:22] 20-minute parts i trust maybe the lord
[1:08:24] we can but so we we started out and we
[1:08:28] we realized in the uh
[1:08:32] in the uh
[1:08:35] 111th
[1:08:38] paragraph the prophet of god makes this
[1:08:41] statement he says
[1:08:43] and as he being the groom
[1:08:46] the bride has to come forth
[1:08:50] because it's part
[1:08:53] of him
[1:08:55] and and so
[1:08:57] uh
[1:08:58] when when we we realize that that
[1:09:02] it's not that we've missed anything
[1:09:04] it's not that we're trying to go
[1:09:06] backwards to be something because he has
[1:09:10] already placed it as something that's
[1:09:13] going to come the bride has got to come
[1:09:16] forth the bride has got to come forth so
[1:09:19] we understand that the placing of his
[1:09:21] ministry the ministry of the son of man
[1:09:25] which is none other than god himself
[1:09:28] coming and taking a redeemed vessel and
[1:09:32] veiling himself in that vessel so that
[1:09:35] he himself was present tense with us
[1:09:42] some people couldn't see past the veil
[1:09:46] they couldn't see past the veil of jesus
[1:09:49] oh isn't this joseph's son no it wasn't
[1:09:52] joseph's son
[1:09:56] it took a revelation
[1:09:58] to see
[1:09:59] who that he
[1:10:00] was but it it
[1:10:03] in our generation we understand that
[1:10:06] there was a promise
[1:10:08] that the lord jesus christ would return
[1:10:11] to the gentiles and do the same works
[1:10:15] the same signs the same wonders through
[1:10:17] the gentiles that he did to the jews
[1:10:20] because if god ever does one thing one
[1:10:22] way he's always got to continue to do it
[1:10:25] that way
[1:10:26] so we we began to see is he beginning to
[1:10:30] explain he said something had to come to
[1:10:33] maturity
[1:10:35] and he used the type
[1:10:38] in the old testament of when the wheat
[1:10:41] came to maturity that the high priest
[1:10:44] would take that wheat now we have a high
[1:10:48] priest don't we we have a high priest
[1:10:50] after the order of what melchizedek
[1:10:55] amen and what did that order do
[1:10:59] that order could speak
[1:11:01] something into existence
[1:11:04] it could discern the thoughts and
[1:11:05] intents of the heart
[1:11:09] it could do all manner of
[1:11:11] wonders
[1:11:12] because it was god
[1:11:15] veiled
[1:11:16] in a vessel
[1:11:20] now it was god veiled in a redeemed
[1:11:23] vessel
[1:11:25] showing
[1:11:27] that god didn't finish his work
[1:11:31] i know this is hard for some people to
[1:11:34] take but he didn't finish all his work
[1:11:37] when he was here in the beginning
[1:11:42] but he finishes it up
[1:11:44] at the end time
[1:11:47] and so we we see that one came
[1:11:51] through the ministry of the son of man
[1:11:53] one had come to maturity
[1:11:56] and that was presented over the people
[1:12:00] and waved over the people as a sign
[1:12:04] that the rest of the crop
[1:12:08] would come to maturity
[1:12:10] so in our generation the ministry of
[1:12:13] malachi 4 5
[1:12:16] the ministry of revelations 10 7 the the
[1:12:20] ministry of luke 17 30 god veiled in a
[1:12:25] man
[1:12:26] who was fulfilling the prophetic
[1:12:29] prophecy of malachi 4 5
[1:12:33] the prophetic prophecy that there would
[1:12:35] be a seventh church age messenger the
[1:12:38] prophetic prophecy that god himself
[1:12:41] would stand present in our midst
[1:12:44] hid behind a human veil
[1:12:48] that was fulfilled
[1:12:50] and placed before it
[1:12:52] only for
[1:12:55] those that were going to be called to
[1:12:58] maturity
[1:13:02] and so we read this thing he said
[1:13:06] it can he said now the bride's got to
[1:13:09] come forth
[1:13:13] and it can only
[1:13:15] be
[1:13:16] the manifestation
[1:13:20] of the fulfilling
[1:13:22] of all the revelations
[1:13:25] and any others has spoken of the bride
[1:13:31] it can only manifest
[1:13:33] so the bride can only manifest
[1:13:38] what was spoken of her
[1:13:42] to
[1:13:44] manifest so everything he said of the
[1:13:48] bride that's the only thing she can
[1:13:51] manifest the works that i do shall she
[1:13:54] do also
[1:13:56] she shall go into all the world
[1:13:59] she shall do this speaking that's what
[1:14:01] he's doing he's speaking of his wife
[1:14:04] the church the church is his wife
[1:14:07] not denominational churches not
[1:14:09] blasphemous names not satan's church
[1:14:13] which is so close it would deceive the
[1:14:15] very elected possible but he's talking
[1:14:18] about that she can only manifest what
[1:14:22] was spoken ever
[1:14:26] so when god sent
[1:14:29] a prophet
[1:14:31] he didn't speak of the church world he
[1:14:34] spoke of the elect lady the bride of
[1:14:38] christ because that was part of the
[1:14:41] elijah ministry the alex the eliezer
[1:14:44] type
[1:14:45] in the scriptures that he come to
[1:14:48] present a bride without spot or wrinkle
[1:14:54] so she's got to come forth
[1:14:57] we're just reviewing here
[1:15:00] and he goes on
[1:15:01] and
[1:15:02] he he talks about this and he says and
[1:15:05] so we're we're building this up because
[1:15:07] now he's talking about this bride
[1:15:11] what he's doing is
[1:15:15] he's
[1:15:16] speaking
[1:15:18] this bride into existence
[1:15:22] by his work she's here
[1:15:26] but she doesn't know it
[1:15:31] she's living
[1:15:33] but she's dead while she yet lives
[1:15:39] so something has got to
[1:15:41] quicken her
[1:15:43] or
[1:15:44] bring her to life
[1:15:47] when something's dead
[1:15:49] and it's brought to life what do we call
[1:15:51] that
[1:15:55] we're going somewhere
[1:15:59] that'll make us shout right here buddy
[1:16:02] all right so
[1:16:04] he so he said now
[1:16:07] the only time he says until the church
[1:16:11] becomes both this paragraph 113 until
[1:16:14] the church becomes both the dynamics
[1:16:18] and the mechanics
[1:16:20] and the spirit of god that moved him
[1:16:24] to do the things that he did
[1:16:28] so in other words do you understand what
[1:16:30] he's saying here he says the dynamics
[1:16:34] and the mechanics have to come together
[1:16:37] in order for her to do the things that
[1:16:41] he did
[1:16:43] well that was spoken of her
[1:16:46] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:16:49] so she can only manifest what was spoken
[1:16:52] of her
[1:16:55] you understand that so if he never spoke
[1:16:57] that of us
[1:17:00] what happens if the word spoke he said
[1:17:01] the pr the the
[1:17:04] minister shall be dressed in long robes
[1:17:06] and have a pointed hat and carry a staff
[1:17:10] and he shall stamp everybody on the head
[1:17:12] with 666.
[1:17:16] that's what we'd be doing
[1:17:18] but that isn't what he spoke
[1:17:20] what he's focused she'll be like me
[1:17:24] as i am so shall she be
[1:17:29] that's what he spoke of her why is he
[1:17:31] doing that because he's if this type is
[1:17:33] like in esther you can have
[1:17:35] all of my kingdom
[1:17:37] to the half
[1:17:40] oh
[1:17:41] what a beautiful
[1:17:42] beautiful type
[1:17:44] of the scriptures all these scriptures
[1:17:47] all these men that lived this were
[1:17:49] living for this day when this flesh and
[1:17:52] this church and him would become one the
[1:17:56] invisible union of the heavenly bride
[1:18:03] the earthly bride and the heavenly
[1:18:05] bridegroom coming into a beautiful union
[1:18:08] so he said
[1:18:10] he said i'll give he said
[1:18:13] he that believeth on me
[1:18:16] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:18:19] i'll give him a charge of my dynamics in
[1:18:25] his my
[1:18:26] mechanics
[1:18:29] that
[1:18:29] the world
[1:18:31] will not be able to stand it
[1:18:35] and i'll raise him up again in the last
[1:18:40] day
[1:18:42] that's the easter message
[1:18:45] the eastern message is the dynamics and
[1:18:47] the mechanics so we just talked about it
[1:18:50] in our preview that we've got the
[1:18:52] mechanics down we got the church orders
[1:18:54] we got the deacons sitting here we got
[1:18:56] the ministry in place we got everybody
[1:18:59] waiting our our sisters aren't putting
[1:19:02] on weiner tight dresses you know brother
[1:19:04] graham spoke about that dresses that are
[1:19:06] so tight they wrap you up like a look
[1:19:08] like a hot dog you know we don't have
[1:19:10] big high heeled shoes on you you know
[1:19:13] i'm i'm called a god to preach the
[1:19:16] gospel if i don't i'll be men at the
[1:19:18] judgment seat
[1:19:22] and i got enough to be judged for
[1:19:24] i don't want to be guilty of not telling
[1:19:26] you the truth
[1:19:29] besides a real child of god loves
[1:19:31] correction
[1:19:35] i mean it does it good
[1:19:38] but we've got that down
[1:19:40] you know we're not doing those things
[1:19:42] we're not cutting our hair we've got the
[1:19:44] mechanics as i like how brother orlando
[1:19:47] says it you know
[1:19:48] we've done the man part
[1:19:51] now god's got to do
[1:19:53] the god part so we talked about how we
[1:19:56] got everything in order we got all our
[1:19:58] doctrine in order we got all our
[1:20:00] teaching in order and for we've been
[1:20:02] polishing it up and make sure it's good
[1:20:04] in the hubcaps but brother ben says what
[1:20:06] good does it do you if you have all the
[1:20:08] mechanics together
[1:20:09] and it's even filled with gasoline
[1:20:13] but there's got to come a spark
[1:20:17] to ignite the gasoline i like the way
[1:20:20] brother randy shared it with me
[1:20:24] brother randy murray shared it with me
[1:20:26] he said brother david it's like a pinata
[1:20:30] i thought what
[1:20:32] he says yeah it's like a pinata and you
[1:20:34] just stuff it full of candy
[1:20:39] and and the the candy being the word
[1:20:42] like he said you fill the tank full of
[1:20:44] gasoline he says you just stuff it full
[1:20:47] of word and you stuff it for the word he
[1:20:49] says but something's got to come and
[1:20:52] hit the pinata and break it open that
[1:20:56] the candy can come out
[1:21:01] so
[1:21:02] we got the mechanics
[1:21:04] and i'm saying this because we haven't
[1:21:06] missed anything
[1:21:09] so we've got to have something that
[1:21:10] comes and smacks it breaks it open and
[1:21:13] let's this gasoline this word in us
[1:21:17] be sparked to life
[1:21:19] that it moves us to do the works that
[1:21:23] we've been for ordained to do and walk
[1:21:26] in
[1:21:28] so it's not something that goes
[1:21:30] backwards
[1:21:32] and so
[1:21:34] we we understand that
[1:21:35] he says and then he goes to say this in
[1:21:38] 116.
[1:21:40] it just won't move
[1:21:42] no matter how good the mechanics is
[1:21:45] until the dynamics come
[1:21:48] and when the dynamics come
[1:21:50] that fire
[1:21:52] is made to connect
[1:21:55] with that octane in the gasoline
[1:21:59] so let me put this in scriptural words
[1:22:02] if i could
[1:22:04] in other words that the dynamics are
[1:22:07] there and that spark comes
[1:22:11] he says that that fire
[1:22:14] that spark comes to connect with the
[1:22:18] promises
[1:22:21] that have been given her to make them
[1:22:25] come to life
[1:22:30] okay
[1:22:31] now we haven't missed that
[1:22:35] we're on the edge of it right now
[1:22:40] he says
[1:22:42] when the dynamics come that fire
[1:22:45] is made
[1:22:46] to connect with the octane the promises
[1:22:50] of word
[1:22:51] in the
[1:22:52] gasoline the octane is the promises that
[1:22:55] are in the word the gasoline and when
[1:22:57] that explodes
[1:23:01] it causes a combustion
[1:23:04] and that combustion
[1:23:06] moves
[1:23:07] every motion
[1:23:10] every move
[1:23:11] for he is the same yesterday today and
[1:23:15] forever
[1:23:17] that's
[1:23:19] the
[1:23:21] resurrection
[1:23:26] now we're gonna he's gonna go on this
[1:23:28] more
[1:23:29] that's the real power of god's mechanics
[1:23:31] with the dynamics it's the spirit that
[1:23:34] quickens
[1:23:35] it's the spark
[1:23:38] that fires
[1:23:39] it's not the gasoline that fires it's
[1:23:43] the spark that fires the gasoline now i
[1:23:47] say that because we've always been
[1:23:50] expecting the word
[1:23:55] that's what we say right the word says
[1:23:57] this the word says that the word says
[1:24:00] this the word said that but we've been
[1:24:02] expecting the word but the word doesn't
[1:24:07] the the word doesn't fire
[1:24:12] you put it in your tank but now it takes
[1:24:16] something
[1:24:18] from above
[1:24:21] not within
[1:24:22] it takes something that god has to send
[1:24:26] at his time in his season in his place
[1:24:31] and make the octane
[1:24:34] the power the promises in that word
[1:24:37] come
[1:24:38] come to pass
[1:24:40] so we think just because i've got the
[1:24:42] word the word is going to do it no
[1:24:46] the word won't do it on itself
[1:24:50] the scripture says i came not to you in
[1:24:52] word only
[1:24:55] but in power and demonstration of the
[1:24:58] spirit
[1:25:01] so listen
[1:25:03] the 17th verse and then we'll go to our
[1:25:05] tape
[1:25:06] you can do nothing without me
[1:25:10] but with me
[1:25:11] you can do
[1:25:13] all things
[1:25:15] as
[1:25:16] he is the word
[1:25:21] now listen to this
[1:25:22] it's the father
[1:25:24] living
[1:25:28] that's what he said to philip
[1:25:30] have i been with you so long can you
[1:25:32] know not who i am he who hath seen me
[1:25:36] have seen
[1:25:38] the father
[1:25:40] it was the father
[1:25:42] living
[1:25:43] and what did he say
[1:25:45] i don't do these works
[1:25:48] it's not i that does the works it's the
[1:25:50] father that's in me that does the work
[1:25:54] so he was testifying
[1:25:57] to
[1:25:58] the spark
[1:26:00] or the dynamic power
[1:26:02] of god
[1:26:04] that moved on him and made him fulfill
[1:26:09] what was spoken of him hallelujah
[1:26:16] so it was the father
[1:26:20] his life
[1:26:23] that gave jesus his life
[1:26:27] and made him what he is
[1:26:30] if god ever does something one way he'll
[1:26:33] do it the same
[1:26:35] so now
[1:26:37] our messenger is telling us
[1:26:40] that the very spark
[1:26:44] that sparked jesus
[1:26:48] is the same spark
[1:26:50] that's going to spark us
[1:26:54] now and we went over this we're not
[1:26:57] talking about the restoration of
[1:26:59] pentecost
[1:27:01] this is beyond pentecost
[1:27:04] this is beyond the rain
[1:27:08] falling on the just and the unjust
[1:27:11] many people out there have pentecostal
[1:27:14] blessings
[1:27:15] the prophet of god said i was in that
[1:27:17] tent meeting a man spoke in tongues and
[1:27:19] he was doing all kinds of stuff another
[1:27:21] man was real genuine he interpreted he
[1:27:24] said i didn't know how it could be and
[1:27:26] the lord revealed to him
[1:27:29] that the rain falls on the just and
[1:27:31] unjust
[1:27:32] sinners can have faith in a promise of
[1:27:35] god and it'll come to pass in their life
[1:27:38] we are not worried about temporary signs
[1:27:41] and wonders
[1:27:43] we are worried about fulfilling our
[1:27:46] eternal purpose in the lord jesus christ
[1:27:49] that's what our hearts desire is that
[1:27:51] eternally
[1:27:53] we will be what the word said we will be
[1:27:59] and so he said you can do nothing
[1:28:01] without me
[1:28:03] but with me you can do all things as he
[1:28:06] is the word it's the father living the
[1:28:09] father sent me
[1:28:11] so
[1:28:12] i send you
[1:28:16] okay as the father sent me so i send you
[1:28:20] as the father has fired me
[1:28:25] and pushed me
[1:28:26] into everything
[1:28:29] i do only that which is pleasing to god
[1:28:36] so what is jesus testifying to he's
[1:28:38] testifying that there is a dynamic spark
[1:28:42] that fired him
[1:28:44] and so if the dynamic spark of god fired
[1:28:47] him he's saying the same dynamic spark
[1:28:51] that fired jesus is going to fire the
[1:28:54] bride because what was ever spoke of the
[1:28:57] groom was also spoken of the pride
[1:29:00] because these two are one and they're
[1:29:03] part of one another
[1:29:11] so i'm sitting here waiting for what
[1:29:15] i'm waiting for the promise
[1:29:18] that something's going to come
[1:29:21] and bring the word
[1:29:24] that is in me
[1:29:26] and make it the father living
[1:29:31] so we're not in condemnation here
[1:29:35] we're not saying oh if you don't have
[1:29:37] these signs and you don't have these
[1:29:39] things and you're not doing this you're
[1:29:41] not saved you don't have the holy ghost
[1:29:43] no
[1:29:45] we're realizing father i've come to the
[1:29:47] hour of the promise
[1:29:51] i've polished my car
[1:29:54] i filled it full of gas
[1:29:56] i'm sitting in the driver's seat not my
[1:29:59] will but thy will be done father i've
[1:30:03] i've prayed i've passed i've i've
[1:30:06] sought your face lord i wanted you to
[1:30:09] move in my life i want to see these
[1:30:12] signs and wonders father i can't produce
[1:30:14] them i'm a sheep i don't produce wool i
[1:30:18] bear wall father give me that spark i
[1:30:22] can do nothing without you i am not here
[1:30:25] to glorify myself i am here to glorify
[1:30:28] you lord i'm promised
[1:30:31] in your word by the fulfillment of
[1:30:33] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7
[1:30:38] that there is a spark that's going to
[1:30:40] come and make these promises of the word
[1:30:43] live in me
[1:30:49] i know it's there because i've watched
[1:30:51] it waved over me
[1:30:54] now we always say oh we can't do that we
[1:30:57] can't be brother branham we will never
[1:30:59] do that
[1:31:01] brother of them didn't even say for us
[1:31:02] to be him
[1:31:04] he said as he is
[1:31:07] so are we
[1:31:14] because the spirit of god the holy
[1:31:16] spirit doesn't come to speak of himself
[1:31:19] but it comes to bring us in remembrance
[1:31:21] of everything that was spoken
[1:31:25] of us
[1:31:30] you're a part of him right
[1:31:32] all right so that's
[1:31:34] that's where we've come to
[1:31:37] to this place
[1:31:39] he says
[1:31:41] he said i'll send you
[1:31:43] in the same mechanics
[1:31:45] and it takes the same dynamics to
[1:31:48] operate it
[1:31:49] and these signs shall follow them
[1:31:52] that claim to have the mechanics the
[1:31:55] dynamics will
[1:31:57] take
[1:31:59] its place
[1:32:06] and then
[1:32:07] there's some beautiful things that we'll
[1:32:10] go over here so let's just stop right
[1:32:12] here
[1:32:13] and we're going to listen from paragraph
[1:32:16] 118
[1:32:17] to a paragraph
[1:32:21] 1
[1:32:24] of 50 through 156 it's 14 minutes
[1:32:29] this next 14 minutes
[1:32:31] may i say this way brother branham says
[1:32:34] says it
[1:32:36] this way
[1:32:39] now this is deep now
[1:32:42] and be sure
[1:32:44] to catch this
[1:32:45] good
[1:32:47] that's what he's going to describe about
[1:32:49] these next 14 minutes so lord bless you
[1:32:52] this morning
[1:32:55] so
[1:32:56] what you're looking for this morning is
[1:32:58] we're looking
[1:33:00] for the revelation
[1:33:02] that's going to bring us to the place
[1:33:06] that we realize
[1:33:08] that we are the recipients
[1:33:11] of the spark
[1:33:14] because if your heart condemns you
[1:33:18] it's hard to go forward
[1:33:20] but if your heart condemns you not
[1:33:23] then ask
[1:33:25] whatever you will
[1:33:27] and the father will give it to you
[1:33:29] and when you can see it's your
[1:33:31] birthright
[1:33:33] then it becomes wonderful so if the
[1:33:36] brothers would just play that
[1:33:38] if you have i guess your devices your
[1:33:40] phones your books
[1:33:42] i hope you're joining me
[1:33:44] in this study
[1:33:46] and you're delving into this word with
[1:33:48] me
[1:33:49] and you're preparing to come to service
[1:33:52] because you'll only get out of it what
[1:33:54] you put into it
[1:33:56] and and uh
[1:33:58] but
[1:33:59] but i i this is just a blessing so i
[1:34:01] hope that we you we can listen to it for
[1:34:03] a few minutes
[1:34:04] it's 14 minutes and then we'll maybe
[1:34:07] spend 20 minutes going through it
[1:34:10] or 30 and have it bless you so god bless
[1:34:13] you this morning as we listen to our
[1:34:15] messenger what i believe is the voice of
[1:34:18] god
[1:34:19] to us in this day
[1:34:20] and i believe the holy spirit today
[1:34:23] has placed it in his will
[1:34:26] that we would go to the storehouse that
[1:34:29] he could feed us
[1:34:31] this meal
[1:34:33] because we've matured enough
[1:34:35] to be able to eat this this morning god
[1:34:38] bless you
[1:34:40] paul said the gospel came to us not in
[1:34:42] word only through gasoline only but
[1:34:44] through spark also to make it move
[1:34:47] there you go it came to us in that
[1:34:49] manner
[1:34:50] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[1:34:53] that quickened the true believer to
[1:34:55] eternal life
[1:34:57] i remember potentially now watch as we
[1:35:00] are getting out of our time
[1:35:02] notice
[1:35:03] the same spirit now romans 8 1 now let's
[1:35:06] just read that again in romans 8 1 and
[1:35:09] we'll see what that says
[1:35:12] all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm
[1:35:15] sorry and romans 8 11.
[1:35:18] but
[1:35:19] if there's a problem
[1:35:22] there's a sketch but if the spirit of
[1:35:24] him
[1:35:26] god the holy spirit
[1:35:28] that raised up jesus from the dead dwelt
[1:35:32] in you
[1:35:35] oh
[1:35:36] there you are
[1:35:38] if the bridegroom
[1:35:41] spirit dwells in the bride
[1:35:44] when god made his first bride grew
[1:35:47] he made the bridegroom first
[1:35:50] and he was both man and woman in spirit
[1:35:54] forming in the dust of the earth and
[1:35:55] making material
[1:35:57] and notice when he made eid from adam he
[1:36:00] took
[1:36:01] not another piece of clay he took from
[1:36:04] the same piece of clay
[1:36:06] the same word
[1:36:08] or adam was the spoken word
[1:36:10] you see he took from him and then taken
[1:36:13] the he had masculine and feminist spirit
[1:36:16] and he took the feminist spirit away
[1:36:18] from adam
[1:36:20] and placed it in eaves who are still
[1:36:22] part of adam's fence
[1:36:24] is adam's flesh
[1:36:26] then it was adam's spirit the dynamics
[1:36:30] that quickened the mechanics of his body
[1:36:33] so the bride must also be
[1:36:35] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones
[1:36:39] then how is this mortal fresh go become
[1:36:42] his flesh we'll get to it
[1:36:44] how is it done how what is this great
[1:36:47] transformation
[1:36:48] notice now if the spirit
[1:36:52] of him god
[1:36:54] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:36:57] dwell in you
[1:36:58] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:37:01] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:37:05] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:37:09] oh my
[1:37:11] the predestinated ones
[1:37:14] of course like the seed laid up on the
[1:37:15] earth the one that has life and many of
[1:37:18] them are dead they were just rotten
[1:37:20] seeds
[1:37:21] the waters and things burned them out
[1:37:24] but you know there was a seed laying
[1:37:26] there
[1:37:27] ready for life god knowed it was laying
[1:37:28] there
[1:37:30] now
[1:37:31] the predestinated ones
[1:37:33] are the first to be quickened by the
[1:37:34] holy spirit for the holy spirit comes
[1:37:38] to claim its own
[1:37:41] how this is deep now
[1:37:44] be sure to catch this good
[1:37:47] now as the sun was set across the earth
[1:37:50] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[1:37:53] to light
[1:37:55] it was not to bring all the dirt to the
[1:37:57] knife
[1:37:58] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[1:38:01] which
[1:38:02] was enclosed around the line
[1:38:06] not all men will receive christ
[1:38:09] oh no
[1:38:11] but those which god
[1:38:13] foreordained
[1:38:15] life
[1:38:17] is housed around some of the dirt of the
[1:38:19] earth
[1:38:20] that's when it comes to quicken they're
[1:38:22] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[1:38:24] there in the sun and say oh this old
[1:38:25] sun's so hot that rock said there's no
[1:38:27] sun so hot
[1:38:28] but that little seed said that's what
[1:38:30] i'm looking for
[1:38:31] and to begin to spring forth the line
[1:38:34] it quickened that part of the dirt
[1:38:37] because the sun was sent
[1:38:41] not to quicken the rock not to quicken
[1:38:45] the earth but to quicken the life
[1:38:48] of the seed
[1:38:51] now the holy spirit comes now
[1:38:54] of course it wasn't set why won't all
[1:38:56] the people receive it it wasn't said to
[1:38:58] him
[1:38:59] god told me i don't believe i don't care
[1:39:01] what you said you could raise up the
[1:39:02] dead or anything and heal the sick and
[1:39:04] prove it anyway i still don't believe
[1:39:05] that this turn on
[1:39:07] you're unbelievers
[1:39:08] it don't mean a thing to you it wasn't
[1:39:10] even sent to you it's said to those who
[1:39:13] will believe
[1:39:14] the message is to the believer
[1:39:17] to them that perish is foolishness
[1:39:19] but to them that are in christ and part
[1:39:21] of that seed is life
[1:39:24] my crude little story about the farmer
[1:39:26] putting the egg uh the eagle egg under
[1:39:29] the heat
[1:39:30] see that little eagle was absolutely he
[1:39:32] was a he was odd looking little creature
[1:39:35] when this uh
[1:39:36] farmer had did that thing that he did to
[1:39:38] put this uh eagle egg under this old
[1:39:40] hand
[1:39:41] and she hatched out a funny looking
[1:39:43] chicken
[1:39:44] it was a
[1:39:45] odd little thought he didn't look like
[1:39:47] him his feathers wasn't like the rest of
[1:39:48] him and
[1:39:49] he just he was an odd little guy
[1:39:52] and uh all rested chickens recognized
[1:39:54] him in odd fella
[1:39:55] and
[1:39:56] the hen went around he didn't even like
[1:39:58] the dice she was feeding me
[1:40:00] he just didn't like that scratching in
[1:40:02] the barnyard he didn't have nothing to
[1:40:03] do with that
[1:40:04] so he wondered why he had to be the odd
[1:40:06] one around there any
[1:40:08] thing and he never tasted anything that
[1:40:11] he just eat enough to keep him alive
[1:40:13] because he didn't like the taste of it
[1:40:15] see because he wasn't a chicken too
[1:40:19] and uh the hen would cluck and
[1:40:21] you know
[1:40:22] there's a miracle just bad there is no
[1:40:24] such a thing join the church
[1:40:27] it just didn't hit right with the little
[1:40:28] guy
[1:40:30] so he fought around the hand
[1:40:32] until one day
[1:40:34] his mammy
[1:40:36] the old eagle old laid so many eggs
[1:40:41] and there was one missing
[1:40:45] she knew that that eagle was somewhere
[1:40:49] so she starts out on the hunt for him
[1:40:52] and she's circled over the mountain tops
[1:40:54] and down in the valleys over everywhere
[1:40:56] where he might
[1:40:58] of be by this time
[1:41:00] it's time for him to be born
[1:41:02] the time can me hatched out
[1:41:05] so maybe a crow come in and picked up my
[1:41:07] egg
[1:41:08] maybe a vulture
[1:41:10] i don't know if something picked up my
[1:41:12] egg
[1:41:13] but i know that egg is in my mind
[1:41:20] i got a son somewhere
[1:41:23] i got the honey
[1:41:27] oh god
[1:41:28] he's that great eagle
[1:41:30] and his thoughts he wanted to have a
[1:41:32] church
[1:41:33] in order to have a people
[1:41:35] no matter what cuddled him no matter
[1:41:37] what he's hatched out under
[1:41:39] he's hunting
[1:41:41] he's hunting for his own
[1:41:44] and one day the story goes
[1:41:46] this old eagle flew over the barnyard
[1:41:50] just looking everywhere and she found
[1:41:51] him
[1:41:52] oh
[1:41:53] for that resurrection
[1:41:55] to recognize that he really wasn't
[1:41:57] chicken natural
[1:41:59] he was an eagle
[1:42:02] and he's always taught to look down
[1:42:05] look for a bug or something in the
[1:42:06] barnyard
[1:42:08] but he heard a scream and said look up
[1:42:10] this way
[1:42:12] and he looked above him and there was a
[1:42:15] creature
[1:42:16] with 14 feet wings
[1:42:19] powerful in all the chickens he was in a
[1:42:21] barnyard
[1:42:23] and claimed him to be her son
[1:42:28] that mama how can it get to you they
[1:42:29] just jump start flopping
[1:42:31] or you're an eagle
[1:42:33] see
[1:42:34] she knew she had a son somewhere
[1:42:39] no matter what he's been raised up in
[1:42:42] she's got a son somewhere
[1:42:44] god knows
[1:42:46] hallelujah he's got a predestinated poor
[1:42:49] dane church
[1:42:51] you know he's got sons and daughters and
[1:42:53] a bride waiting somewhere
[1:42:56] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[1:42:58] that wave she
[1:43:02] he's the same yesterday forever not some
[1:43:05] mythical story but a reality
[1:43:20] that reflected
[1:43:22] that he reflected rather
[1:43:24] and when we see not a denomination
[1:43:27] not a phd
[1:43:29] not a llg
[1:43:31] not a good neighbor
[1:43:34] but a son of god
[1:43:36] molded in the image of god with the
[1:43:39] dynamic power of god to answer the
[1:43:41] request of this day that he's the same
[1:43:43] yesterday today and forever
[1:43:45] there ain't no hen going to hold you
[1:43:49] hunch for his
[1:43:51] mama
[1:43:52] he's an eagle to begin with
[1:43:55] he recognizes this real eagle recognizes
[1:43:58] the call of god's word
[1:44:00] why
[1:44:02] he's an eagle
[1:44:03] a eagle to a
[1:44:04] eagle
[1:44:06] the word before the foundation the word
[1:44:09] to the word
[1:44:11] amen
[1:44:12] the word predestinated to the word
[1:44:14] written
[1:44:15] for the hour
[1:44:17] you realize your position he hunts for
[1:44:19] it
[1:44:20] this then this
[1:44:24] earthly body
[1:44:26] is quickened and brought by the
[1:44:28] quickening spirit of god to obedience to
[1:44:31] the word of god
[1:44:33] quickly what do you want to know how i
[1:44:35] could get there with her
[1:44:37] he'd been taught he couldn't do that
[1:44:39] you can't get no higher to jump
[1:44:42] he's a chicken
[1:44:43] see
[1:44:44] but this eagle said that's my soul
[1:44:47] well look at the chickens no matter what
[1:44:48] the chickens are your eagles
[1:44:52] just start spreading the wholes
[1:44:54] get a little exercise
[1:44:56] start moving up
[1:44:58] the word to the word
[1:45:00] the works that i do shall you also he
[1:45:02] that believeth in me the works that i do
[1:45:05] shall he also
[1:45:07] because i live he lived though so in the
[1:45:09] spirit that raised him from the dead
[1:45:11] dwells in you he quickens your mortal
[1:45:13] body
[1:45:14] see
[1:45:15] what does it do now listen to what you
[1:45:17] know that this easter i want to mean
[1:45:18] more to you than any easter egg
[1:45:21] i want you to see we know what it's done
[1:45:23] for him but i want you to see it's not
[1:45:25] well it has done the same for you amen
[1:45:29] what does it do it quickens the mortal
[1:45:32] body
[1:45:33] this mortal body that we live in it
[1:45:35] quickens it in other words brings it to
[1:45:36] life
[1:45:37] now you who once walked along with a
[1:45:39] great big cigar in your mouth and
[1:45:41] everything a bunch of cigarettes and you
[1:45:42] women who once had short hair and
[1:45:44] painted and carried on wore shorts and
[1:45:45] things like that oh it wants something
[1:45:47] to scream
[1:45:48] and you look down here and it was the
[1:45:49] word
[1:45:51] hey it quickened your you said no more
[1:45:53] sharks
[1:45:55] no more liquor for me no more no more
[1:45:58] stealing no more see the spirit that
[1:46:01] raised him from the dead
[1:46:03] dwelling in you will also
[1:46:06] bring your mortal bodies
[1:46:09] the dust of the earth into subjection
[1:46:11] you see what is it subjections of love
[1:46:14] christ who is christ the word
[1:46:17] not the theology but the word
[1:46:21] then
[1:46:22] you say that these things oh i think
[1:46:24] it's hard for women to wear uh flashes
[1:46:26] and the words that don't
[1:46:28] see it you do that
[1:46:30] you're drawn to it
[1:46:32] see it's you that it becomes you become
[1:46:34] part of the word it brought your body
[1:46:37] not well you say well let me tell you
[1:46:39] something my pastor what your pastor
[1:46:41] said
[1:46:41] what the word says
[1:46:43] if you want to be a chicken go on with
[1:46:44] them but if the pastor speaks different
[1:46:47] from this word then he's not a feeder of
[1:46:48] the eagles
[1:46:50] he's the peter of the hymns see not of
[1:46:53] the eagles the eagle eats on eagles from
[1:46:56] the thing they queen of the bible said
[1:46:58] it's wrong to do that demand and so
[1:47:00] forth and what all you do it's wrong to
[1:47:01] say days and miracles just pass this
[1:47:03] bible said he's the same yesterday
[1:47:04] forever
[1:47:05] let's say that's mental telepathy
[1:47:07] there's some kind of mind reading this
[1:47:08] discernment all these divisions and
[1:47:10] things is nonsense see they are chickens
[1:47:12] that's right they don't know what eagle
[1:47:14] food is
[1:47:15] but brother when you hear that scream
[1:47:17] there's something in you you're eager to
[1:47:18] begin with why you are that seed
[1:47:22] that the resurrection of the s o n
[1:47:25] has gone in the wave sheep upon the
[1:47:27] earth to make you recognize that you are
[1:47:30] a eagle
[1:47:31] and not a denominational chicken
[1:47:34] you see it ha
[1:47:37] it's the spirit that raised him from the
[1:47:39] dead the word
[1:47:40] the dynamic of the word
[1:47:43] dwells in you
[1:47:45] it also quickens your mortal body now
[1:47:47] how we pleasure these flesh and is born
[1:47:49] because quickly while we're yet mortal
[1:47:51] sinners
[1:47:53] mortal ready to die these bodies it
[1:47:55] quickens that body
[1:47:57] what's quick it brings the life
[1:48:00] the spirit that wants like to drink run
[1:48:02] around commit adultery and all these
[1:48:03] it's quickened
[1:48:05] well the things die
[1:48:08] and you're resurrected
[1:48:10] it quickens your mortal body
[1:48:12] therefore your bodies is the temple of
[1:48:16] the
[1:48:16] dynamics
[1:48:18] because why from the beginning you are
[1:48:21] part of the mechanics
[1:48:25] there's your resurrection
[1:48:27] there's the church in the resurrection
[1:48:29] with you
[1:48:30] these bodies right now are quickened
[1:48:33] okay you've heard you believe it changed
[1:48:36] you
[1:48:37] from a denomination to the word
[1:48:40] see the dynamic
[1:48:42] if it comes upon water in the splutter
[1:48:45] some miracles
[1:48:52] we'll just stop right there for a second
[1:48:55] let's just jump back
[1:48:57] and just take a moment to
[1:48:59] run this down
[1:49:02] to us
[1:49:03] [Music]
[1:49:04] as we
[1:49:08] just look at this how beautiful
[1:49:11] it is here
[1:49:13] has
[1:49:14] we read it and
[1:49:15] so we we want to do what we can to
[1:49:20] let this
[1:49:21] uh
[1:49:23] sink in real deep i got to get my pages
[1:49:25] in
[1:49:26] order here if you just give me a second
[1:49:29] 20 said
[1:49:31] all right and then i think we started
[1:49:35] on the
[1:49:36] paragraph um
[1:49:39] 118 is that correct
[1:49:43] okay
[1:49:44] it's here somewhere alrighty
[1:49:59] all right so let's just let's just
[1:50:02] let's don't let's just let this skip
[1:50:04] by us here this morning
[1:50:07] okay because
[1:50:08] he's he's saying something here to us
[1:50:11] and if i could say it this way that
[1:50:14] that god hides it
[1:50:17] from the wise and prudent
[1:50:19] so somebody can be listening to this and
[1:50:21] they hear the story of the eagle and
[1:50:23] they already kind of heard the story of
[1:50:26] the eagle and he makes statements in
[1:50:28] here but you understand since god always
[1:50:31] hides everything in simplicity he always
[1:50:34] kind of wraps statements
[1:50:38] mixed in with things
[1:50:40] and that's what he said he says when he
[1:50:42] writes a love letter to his bride he
[1:50:44] makes statements in there
[1:50:46] that other people would miss he said oh
[1:50:49] i really miss you well she knows what
[1:50:51] that means
[1:50:53] or you know i think about a certain
[1:50:55] thing she knows
[1:50:57] what it means because it's it's written
[1:51:00] to her in in such a a
[1:51:04] beautiful way here so now
[1:51:08] he's he's talking about
[1:51:10] the the church and we read this in the
[1:51:12] 16 he said
[1:51:15] if he's the same yesterday today and
[1:51:18] forever
[1:51:19] that's the resurrection
[1:51:22] so now let's go back over to what he
[1:51:24] said if we could turn
[1:51:26] uh
[1:51:27] if we could turn as he's he's talking
[1:51:29] down here in 18 about
[1:51:32] about romans chapter 1 he said if the
[1:51:35] spirit that was in the bridegroom
[1:51:39] dwells in the bride
[1:51:43] all right so that's what what
[1:51:45] our
[1:51:46] our point is in 20 says god made the
[1:51:50] first
[1:51:51] bridegroom he made the bridegroom first
[1:51:54] he was both man and woman in spirit
[1:51:58] formed in the dust of the earth to make
[1:52:00] him material
[1:52:03] and notice when he made eve from adam
[1:52:08] he took not another part of clay
[1:52:12] he took the same piece of clay the same
[1:52:14] word from adam
[1:52:16] was a spoken word see he took from him
[1:52:20] and then taken
[1:52:22] the masculine and feminine spirit he
[1:52:26] took the feminine spirit away from adam
[1:52:28] and placed in eve
[1:52:30] so it's still
[1:52:32] part of adam's
[1:52:34] spirit
[1:52:36] it's adam's flesh
[1:52:39] so eve was adam's flesh
[1:52:43] right so he took the spirit of adam
[1:52:47] and that's what made eve
[1:52:50] it took it so we have to be what flesh
[1:52:54] of his flesh
[1:52:56] bone of his bone so he goes down here
[1:52:59] he's talking about this he says then it
[1:53:02] was adam's spirit the dynamic that
[1:53:05] quickened the mechanics of his body eve
[1:53:09] was his body
[1:53:12] so
[1:53:13] adam's spirit
[1:53:16] was the dynamics of eve
[1:53:19] that brought eve's
[1:53:21] body
[1:53:22] to life
[1:53:25] now why is that now listen what he's
[1:53:27] saying don't miss this because here's
[1:53:29] the question that he poses to us and if
[1:53:32] you just walk through this real quick
[1:53:35] looking for the next line
[1:53:39] you walk right over what he said now
[1:53:42] listen look at what he asked us here
[1:53:45] he said
[1:53:46] so adam's spirit is the dynamics or the
[1:53:50] life of eve
[1:53:53] that's what quickened the flesh
[1:53:55] well you're in flesh right
[1:53:58] so watch what he says here so the bride
[1:54:01] must be flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:54:03] his bone
[1:54:06] now here's the question
[1:54:10] then how is this mortal flesh
[1:54:14] going to become his flesh
[1:54:18] how many heard that
[1:54:22] when i heard that i thought i'd stop me
[1:54:23] in my tracks
[1:54:27] because what what is what is that
[1:54:30] satan's got me doing
[1:54:32] he's always got me looking down
[1:54:36] got me thinking i'm a chicken
[1:54:38] always looking at the bugs in my life
[1:54:41] always trying to eat the bugs out of my
[1:54:43] life the little problems in my life the
[1:54:45] little things in my life
[1:54:48] you know what i mean i can't rise any
[1:54:50] higher
[1:54:53] but he's actually telling us here
[1:54:56] he's actually preaching to us about a
[1:54:59] present tense resurrection
[1:55:02] about our bodies
[1:55:06] not another body
[1:55:07] not a body we keep looking for some
[1:55:10] other day but the question is how is our
[1:55:14] body
[1:55:15] how is this mortal flesh
[1:55:18] going to become his flesh
[1:55:25] we'll get to in a minute
[1:55:28] how is it
[1:55:30] done
[1:55:32] what is this great
[1:55:34] transformation
[1:55:37] so he sets that right in there
[1:55:41] and it's it's it's it's absolutely
[1:55:45] the very question
[1:55:48] that's on all of our hearts and minds
[1:55:50] how is this thing that i look in the
[1:55:53] mirror that's got so many problems and
[1:55:56] everything how is it going to become
[1:55:57] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:56:05] how is it done
[1:56:07] how's it going to happen
[1:56:10] now he's telling us
[1:56:12] he's saying if the same spirit
[1:56:16] that dwells in jesus dwells in you
[1:56:20] now don't miss it
[1:56:23] because if not
[1:56:24] you start running around looking for
[1:56:27] that spirit somewhere
[1:56:29] oh i need the baptism the holy spirit i
[1:56:32] need more pouring out of god i'm going
[1:56:34] to run down to the altar again and cry
[1:56:36] through and i'm going to run up and
[1:56:38] shout and i'm going to
[1:56:40] carry it on
[1:56:44] and
[1:56:45] we try to produce it
[1:56:49] but he's going to produce it you can do
[1:56:52] nothing without me
[1:56:55] all the father hath given will come
[1:56:58] and he said now he said oh my
[1:57:04] 24 oh my
[1:57:06] the predestinated one of course like the
[1:57:10] seed laying upon the earth
[1:57:13] so he's now he's going to tell you
[1:57:15] how is this done
[1:57:18] how is it going to happen
[1:57:20] how is your flesh going to become his
[1:57:22] flesh
[1:57:24] how is this done what is the
[1:57:27] transformation
[1:57:30] he preached the whole message god's
[1:57:32] power to transform
[1:57:34] god's ability to take what's in the seed
[1:57:38] and
[1:57:39] bring it to life
[1:57:42] and so he he moves on here he says
[1:57:46] many of them were dead they just
[1:57:48] rotten the water and things burn it up
[1:57:51] but now there was a seed lying
[1:57:55] there ready for life and god knew it was
[1:57:58] lying there
[1:57:59] now the predestinated ones are the first
[1:58:02] ones quickened by the holy s
[1:58:05] by the holy spirit for the spirit comes
[1:58:08] to claim its own
[1:58:11] now this goes deep
[1:58:14] be sure to catch it good
[1:58:18] so we don't want you to miss this
[1:58:21] if that's what i'm saying so we haven't
[1:58:23] missed it
[1:58:24] it's something that is fixing
[1:58:28] to
[1:58:28] happen
[1:58:30] okay if if you can believe it
[1:58:35] and look to this promise
[1:58:39] and claim this promise
[1:58:42] because
[1:58:43] remember
[1:58:44] evidence is possession
[1:58:48] if you have the evidence of something
[1:58:51] you're possessing that evidence
[1:58:54] and
[1:58:55] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[1:58:57] for not yet seen so how do you receive
[1:59:02] evidence you receive evidence by
[1:59:05] revelation
[1:59:08] so god always works by faith
[1:59:11] so when it's revealed to you it now
[1:59:14] becomes evidence
[1:59:16] or possession
[1:59:18] so he says how's it going to do he says
[1:59:20] now the sun is sent across the earth
[1:59:24] so who who will volunteer to be a rock
[1:59:27] you you're a
[1:59:28] rock you
[1:59:30] you're dirt
[1:59:33] and philip you can be
[1:59:36] no amit phillip he's a soldier so he is
[1:59:38] a rock
[1:59:39] so you come here philip rock
[1:59:42] come here brother
[1:59:44] dirt
[1:59:46] and then we have rather clever
[1:59:50] now
[1:59:50] i i i
[1:59:52] i told you remember a while back how the
[1:59:54] lord told me to go to certain barber
[1:59:57] and
[1:59:58] i i just was led and i so i go to the
[2:00:01] barber shop i tell the lady
[2:00:03] about
[2:00:05] the message of the hour and she said
[2:00:06] there's just a young man right in here
[2:00:08] that gave me a book
[2:00:11] so i was back the other day and he said
[2:00:14] i said who's this uh
[2:00:16] you know i started talking about the
[2:00:18] word of god she said oh that young man
[2:00:20] was there
[2:00:22] from your church
[2:00:24] and i said oh i said what was his name
[2:00:27] his name's brother trevor
[2:00:30] and i said brother
[2:00:32] clever
[2:00:34] so i got the picture
[2:00:36] so we ended up testifying to the same
[2:00:39] barber
[2:00:40] did you know that was you
[2:00:44] i just figured you hadn't been listening
[2:00:46] i told the whole story
[2:00:48] and you didn't catch it
[2:00:51] all right so you understand
[2:00:53] the dirt
[2:00:55] right adam was taken out of eve so we're
[2:00:58] that same part of dirt
[2:01:00] so brother rem said the sun comes across
[2:01:04] now it comes on the rock
[2:01:08] and all the rock
[2:01:10] feels is
[2:01:12] oh it's hot
[2:01:14] okay no that's not the way phil feels
[2:01:16] but he's
[2:01:18] he's a rock so we're using him as a rock
[2:01:21] that's all the sun falls on him right
[2:01:24] now this brother he's just here he's
[2:01:27] just regular dirt
[2:01:29] now our brother's not dirt so don't go
[2:01:31] out of here saying burma is that very
[2:01:32] dark
[2:01:34] no he's just standing here for your
[2:01:36] behalf the sun's shining on him
[2:01:40] okay but now here's the same dirt
[2:01:45] it's the same dirt
[2:01:47] the only difference is is this there's a
[2:01:49] seed in here
[2:01:52] now listen to what he said when the sun
[2:01:55] shines on this seed
[2:01:58] not only does it bring the seed to life
[2:02:02] but it quickens the dirt
[2:02:07] that's housing the seed
[2:02:11] so the dirt that's housing the seed is
[2:02:14] this mortal body
[2:02:18] now
[2:02:18] this mark he can't manifest that seed
[2:02:24] unless it's manifested
[2:02:27] through the dirt
[2:02:30] so he's got to take this dirt
[2:02:34] this mortal body this dirt and quicken
[2:02:38] it also so it doesn't just quicken the
[2:02:41] seed it quickens the dirt
[2:02:44] around the seed
[2:02:47] you
[2:02:47] thank you dirt rocks
[2:02:51] now do you understand what he's saying
[2:02:53] here he's saying this sun's coming up
[2:02:56] but this is real deep
[2:02:58] i hope you catch it so the minute you
[2:03:01] believe that you've got a seed in you
[2:03:04] the word of god said if that seeds in
[2:03:07] you it'll quicken your mortal body also
[2:03:14] so what's it going to do
[2:03:17] it's going to bring this mortal body
[2:03:21] into subjection
[2:03:23] to the word
[2:03:24] is that right
[2:03:26] what was jesus mortal body subject to
[2:03:32] he was a sinner
[2:03:36] he wasn't a sinner
[2:03:38] but he was shaped in sin
[2:03:42] right
[2:03:43] we we were shaped in sin it came into
[2:03:46] the world speaking lies
[2:03:49] but yet he came in the form of sin
[2:03:53] so how are we going to get
[2:03:56] to have a body
[2:03:59] like in his body
[2:04:02] we're going to have a body liken to his
[2:04:04] body because he's going to bring to life
[2:04:10] this dirt also amen
[2:04:15] oh i hope you get it
[2:04:17] because
[2:04:18] the flesh warts against the spirit and
[2:04:20] the spirit against the flesh and we find
[2:04:23] these things are contrary one to the
[2:04:25] other but now we also understand
[2:04:29] that he has a dynamic
[2:04:32] a power
[2:04:34] a spark
[2:04:36] something that he sends
[2:04:39] that you can't do but he could do for
[2:04:42] you and give you the quickening power to
[2:04:46] bring this flesh under subjection
[2:04:50] hallelujah that's what i want
[2:04:55] let's just read it
[2:04:57] he now the sun goes across paragraph 26
[2:05:00] goes across the earth not to bring rocks
[2:05:03] which was dirt also to life not to bring
[2:05:07] all dirt to life but to bring that part
[2:05:10] of dirt which is enclosed around the
[2:05:13] life
[2:05:16] what is the part of dirt that's enclosed
[2:05:18] around your life your mortal body
[2:05:21] this body
[2:05:25] not some other body
[2:05:26] not something down the road not some
[2:05:29] other day
[2:05:34] that's where the accuser sits right now
[2:05:36] he points to your flesh
[2:05:39] but we don't look at the flesh we look
[2:05:42] at the what
[2:05:43] the promise
[2:05:44] you don't look at the symptoms you look
[2:05:47] at the promise
[2:05:48] that the eagle doesn't look at the
[2:05:51] chickens
[2:05:53] maybe you've never flown there before
[2:05:58] maybe you haven't realized ever before
[2:06:01] that this mortal body can actually come
[2:06:04] under subjection to the word of god
[2:06:09] but that's why he's hunted you
[2:06:11] that's why he stored up this food that's
[2:06:14] why he's brought it to this hour that
[2:06:16] you can realize wait finally
[2:06:19] i've got a revelation and a promise of
[2:06:22] the word that i can bring this flesh and
[2:06:25] this flesh will be brought
[2:06:28] how has he done it the father sparked
[2:06:31] him
[2:06:33] and pushed him into it
[2:06:38] realized his position
[2:06:41] all of a sudden come on fire oh i hope
[2:06:44] you can grab hold of it
[2:06:47] because if not you'll let your very self
[2:06:49] defeat you
[2:06:52] when he promised he wouldn't lose you
[2:06:55] nor forsake you but he be with you even
[2:06:57] in you till the end he says upon now not
[2:07:01] all men will receive christ
[2:07:03] but those which are foreign to life is
[2:07:06] housed around
[2:07:08] some of the
[2:07:09] of the earth that's the one he comes to
[2:07:12] quicken
[2:07:14] they're
[2:07:15] the ones now let's go to 28 just let's
[2:07:18] follow this real quick for a second
[2:07:20] now that dirt
[2:07:22] would lay there in the sun and say oh
[2:07:24] the old sun is so hot the rock says oh
[2:07:28] the sun is hot but the little seed
[2:07:31] that's what i'm looking for
[2:07:34] and begin to spring forth to life
[2:07:37] it quickens that part of dirt because
[2:07:41] the sun was sent
[2:07:43] not to quicken the rock not the
[2:07:45] quickened the dirt but the but to
[2:07:48] quicken the life of the seed so he can't
[2:07:52] he he's telling us here he's not just
[2:07:55] going to quicken the like life of the
[2:07:57] seed
[2:07:59] and let you struggle
[2:08:02] with the hope that someday you'll be
[2:08:04] free from this flesh
[2:08:07] you'll never have rest
[2:08:12] but he said come unto me oh you get a
[2:08:14] heavy burden and i'll give you the rest
[2:08:16] you understand what i'm saying we
[2:08:18] understand what he's saying this morning
[2:08:20] he's actually telling you i have got a
[2:08:22] power i have got a spark
[2:08:26] that not only can bring your seed to
[2:08:28] life
[2:08:30] not only can reveal to who you are
[2:08:33] but it can
[2:08:34] actually take this mortal flesh body
[2:08:39] and quicken it
[2:08:44] to full obedience to the word
[2:08:46] how many wants that
[2:08:48] i want that
[2:08:53] am i going to condemn myself because
[2:08:55] where i'm at right now
[2:08:57] isn't there
[2:08:58] or am i going to by faith
[2:09:05] and what is faith
[2:09:08] faith is the evidence
[2:09:11] of things
[2:09:12] hoped for
[2:09:14] not yet seen
[2:09:16] so the word of god tells me that there's
[2:09:19] a quickening power
[2:09:21] that's going to fall upon the seed
[2:09:23] that's in me and it's also going to
[2:09:26] quicken the dirt
[2:09:28] around that seed
[2:09:32] i am the resurrection in the life
[2:09:39] he that believeth on me shall never die
[2:09:44] so then then we we see that and he says
[2:09:50] he says mostly people won't receive it
[2:09:53] it wasn't sent for them
[2:09:56] and then he says let's go to my little
[2:09:58] story
[2:09:59] about the eagle
[2:10:02] right the eagle's in the barnyard it
[2:10:04] doesn't even know it's an eagle
[2:10:06] he was always taught to look down
[2:10:10] looking at the bugs or something in the
[2:10:12] barnyard we're always talk to look at
[2:10:14] the flesh
[2:10:18] look at all the faults in our flesh look
[2:10:20] at all this oh i've got to overcome this
[2:10:22] i've got to overcome this i can't jump
[2:10:25] up higher i can't move out with god i
[2:10:28] got to keep looking at this i got to
[2:10:29] keep doing this and we've been taught to
[2:10:32] look
[2:10:33] down
[2:10:37] oh this morning
[2:10:39] by the revelation of god's word if we
[2:10:42] can look up and say satan i have a
[2:10:45] promise
[2:10:46] in god's word that this body
[2:10:50] right here
[2:10:53] not by me doing it
[2:10:59] not by fasting my problem away
[2:11:03] not by creating a strong mental faith
[2:11:08] but by an outside source
[2:11:14] lord i know i've got the holy spirit
[2:11:18] but i still struggle
[2:11:21] and now he's telling you but wait a
[2:11:22] minute
[2:11:24] there's an outside spark
[2:11:28] there's a quickening power
[2:11:30] when that same spirit
[2:11:33] that brought him under subjection
[2:11:37] comes on you
[2:11:38] it will also bring you under subjection
[2:11:42] now you don't produce that
[2:11:46] oh i hope you can grab it
[2:11:49] i hope you can understand your sins
[2:11:51] hasn't stopped him
[2:11:53] unbelief don't stop god he knew you were
[2:11:56] there he's going to hunt you he's going
[2:11:59] to come to your barnyard he's going to
[2:12:01] reveal you to an eagle he's going to
[2:12:04] show you how to flop those wings and
[2:12:06] he's going to take this body that might
[2:12:08] be acting like a chicken and turn it
[2:12:11] into a eagle
[2:12:19] because it's eagle to eagle
[2:12:22] right
[2:12:23] he says
[2:12:24] he says and he comes down here in the
[2:12:26] 41st thirst eagle to eagle
[2:12:30] the word before the foundation the word
[2:12:34] to word
[2:12:36] the word predestinated
[2:12:38] to the word written
[2:12:41] for the hour
[2:12:47] it's the word that's written for the
[2:12:49] hour
[2:12:51] you're the word that was written to the
[2:12:53] hour you sit here with all this trouble
[2:12:56] you have in your flesh
[2:12:57] and everything but that don't matter to
[2:12:59] god
[2:13:02] because you were written for this hour
[2:13:05] he chose you to be here he chose
[2:13:07] selected you he called you from all
[2:13:10] parts of the world all denominations all
[2:13:13] lives all matters of barnyards and
[2:13:16] everything
[2:13:17] from all the different countries that
[2:13:19] are representing you you are the word
[2:13:29] that was written
[2:13:31] for this hour
[2:13:37] wait a minute lord
[2:13:39] let me don't look in the mirror
[2:13:45] that's not where your evidence lies
[2:13:49] don't look at your past
[2:13:51] that's not where the evidence lies
[2:13:56] don't look at the bugs in your life
[2:13:58] that's not where the evidence lies where
[2:14:00] does the evidence lie
[2:14:02] it lies in the spoken word that was
[2:14:06] spoken to you through the mouth of
[2:14:09] malachi 4 5. that's where the evidence
[2:14:13] of the church lies
[2:14:16] and that's how the church
[2:14:18] now if she has that
[2:14:21] spoken evidence
[2:14:24] then that becomes her possession
[2:14:27] and she can look right in the face of
[2:14:29] her flesh she can look at the mirror and
[2:14:32] say david mcgarry you wretch this body
[2:14:36] is going to be quickened by the spark
[2:14:39] that god promised for this age
[2:14:46] oh and you look at all the darkness on
[2:14:48] it
[2:14:49] and you say how could it be how can
[2:14:52] anything be
[2:14:53] because he
[2:14:55] said so
[2:14:58] let's just read down
[2:15:02] he says
[2:15:03] written out you realize your position he
[2:15:05] hunts for
[2:15:06] it this then
[2:15:09] this earthly body
[2:15:11] is quickened
[2:15:13] and brought by the quickening spirit of
[2:15:16] god to the obedience
[2:15:19] to the word
[2:15:20] of god
[2:15:24] this spirit
[2:15:26] his spirit
[2:15:27] the same spirit
[2:15:29] where did we ever get the idea
[2:15:32] that we were going to produce this
[2:15:34] spirit within ourselves
[2:15:40] you can do nothing without me
[2:15:42] where did we always get the idea that if
[2:15:45] we believed what we believed that we
[2:15:48] automatically should have this spirit
[2:15:53] because we've been taught to look down
[2:15:58] we've been taught to look at our flesh
[2:16:00] and judge our spirit by the
[2:16:02] flesh and every time you judge your
[2:16:05] spirit by your flesh
[2:16:08] you condemn yourself
[2:16:11] but if you would judge yourself
[2:16:13] by what god spoke of you
[2:16:18] then you could claim
[2:16:21] the possession
[2:16:23] of the perfection of my flesh
[2:16:26] and my flesh being brought into full
[2:16:29] subjection to the word of god remember
[2:16:33] not some future body
[2:16:38] what did we say the other day
[2:16:41] breakfast everything's a paradox
[2:16:46] we're trapped in it
[2:16:49] it's a setup
[2:16:54] he's not
[2:16:56] going to lose one
[2:16:59] if he said this body
[2:17:01] would be quickened
[2:17:03] and brought into subjection
[2:17:06] this body will be quickened
[2:17:08] and brought in subjection
[2:17:10] that's thus saith the lord because a
[2:17:13] prophet only speaks thus saith of the
[2:17:15] lord and a way of a true prophet is only
[2:17:18] to speak what god reveals to him
[2:17:24] now let's just go here to 48.
[2:17:28] now watch this
[2:17:32] this is deep
[2:17:35] get this real good
[2:17:37] what does it do
[2:17:40] what does this
[2:17:42] eagle
[2:17:44] screaming over the barnyard
[2:17:48] and bringing this
[2:17:52] eagle
[2:17:53] that's in the barnyard what does it do
[2:17:57] when when it goes over it
[2:18:00] when it's waved over it
[2:18:03] what does it do
[2:18:06] that's what he says what does it do
[2:18:11] listen now now
[2:18:14] listen is it up there
[2:18:16] paragraph 148.

[2:18:30] brother mcgeary's just putting this
[2:18:32] together no
[2:18:34] we're reading it write down the way he
[2:18:36] brought it to us it's just that he says
[2:18:38] it in such a way
[2:18:41] that people can sit there
[2:18:43] and it just
[2:18:45] huge
[2:18:47] but that's why he said if you don't see
[2:18:49] jesus christ in every word go back and
[2:18:51] read it again
[2:18:53] and this is what he said he said i'll
[2:18:55] put this here and i'll hit all the high
[2:18:57] points he said you ministers go back and
[2:19:00] go back through it and take the time

[2:19:42] see what does it do
[2:19:44] it quickens the mortal body this
[2:19:49] mortal
[2:19:50] body
[2:19:51] that we live in
[2:19:54] it quickens it in other words brings it
[2:19:58] to life
[2:20:00] praise god
[2:20:02] praise god what a promise
[2:20:06] you say brother mcgary you need to run
[2:20:08] back for it no i don't need to run back
[2:20:10] i never missed it
[2:20:13] i couldn't even eat this food
[2:20:17] i hadn't matured enough
[2:20:20] to come to the place that i could say
[2:20:22] god keeps his word my unbelief is not
[2:20:25] going to stop him from keeping his word
[2:20:28] if he started a perfect work in me he
[2:20:31] will perform it till the end and part of
[2:20:34] the end of the performance of god is
[2:20:36] that this mortal body
[2:20:39] this one i'm living in now
[2:20:41] will be quickened to life
[2:20:48] i don't care what the old devil says
[2:20:50] he can stick his pitchfork in me all he
[2:20:53] wants
[2:20:55] he is not going to stop god from doing
[2:20:58] this and bringing it to pass
[2:21:02] it'll fix your marriage
[2:21:08] it'll fix your fears it'll fix your
[2:21:10] doubts it'll fix your physical your
[2:21:13] financial will fix everything
[2:21:17] you may not make another dollar
[2:21:19] but you'll be happy with the dollar you
[2:21:22] got
[2:21:27] that's right
[2:21:30] i mean why how long are we going to
[2:21:32] condemn ourselves
[2:21:34] for being in the barnyard
[2:21:39] flop
[2:21:42] now listen
[2:21:44] we're closing up
[2:21:46] i hope you're not tired like i said
[2:21:48] we'll arrange to
[2:21:49] shorten things up if we can
[2:21:52] brings it to life
[2:21:54] he says
[2:21:55] now you who are once walked along with
[2:21:57] great big cigars and he explains
[2:21:59] everything we were and all the liquor
[2:22:01] and everything we had
[2:22:03] the spirit that raised him from the dead
[2:22:07] dwelling in you
[2:22:09] will also bring your mortal bodies the
[2:22:12] dust of the earth
[2:22:16] he wants you to totally understand that
[2:22:18] it's actually
[2:22:20] the dust because when the seed got
[2:22:24] quickened
[2:22:25] how many knows the seeds got quicker
[2:22:27] than you
[2:22:28] sure
[2:22:30] you know it because you believed the
[2:22:31] message
[2:22:33] that was part one
[2:22:36] part two is
[2:22:38] now
[2:22:39] that power
[2:22:42] that's in that seed
[2:22:44] is now going to also
[2:22:47] transform
[2:22:48] this flesh
[2:22:50] i'm looking forward to that
[2:22:53] the spirit raised him from the dead
[2:22:55] dwelt in you it will bring your mortal
[2:22:57] bodies the dust of the earth into
[2:22:59] subjection you see what is it
[2:23:04] subject to what
[2:23:07] christ
[2:23:09] who is christ the word not theology but
[2:23:12] the word
[2:23:15] then you say that the these things oh
[2:23:18] i think it's all right and he talks
[2:23:20] about people who just deny the word
[2:23:23] he says
[2:23:24] but he says the words he had quickened
[2:23:26] you
[2:23:27] you are drawn to it
[2:23:32] it it's you then
[2:23:35] see it's you
[2:23:37] then
[2:23:39] so look at you
[2:23:40] you are your body you are your spirit
[2:23:43] you are your mind
[2:23:46] i think it's all he says it's you then
[2:23:49] it quickens you that
[2:23:51] you are drawn to it
[2:23:54] so you just look at this what god's
[2:23:56] doing to us
[2:23:57] if you just take this every time i get a
[2:24:00] message right
[2:24:02] i read it
[2:24:04] and i say oh i'm short
[2:24:08] right
[2:24:08] i want more of god
[2:24:12] so i get drawn up higher
[2:24:14] and i get drawn up higher well well
[2:24:17] here's the finish line just just picture
[2:24:20] right right here
[2:24:22] that this is the finish line
[2:24:24] this is the line we're trying to get
[2:24:26] across
[2:24:28] and
[2:24:29] we're over here
[2:24:31] and we're praying and reading and we
[2:24:32] read something and all of a sudden
[2:24:34] something clicks us and we say oh i
[2:24:36] gotta rise up higher so we get up and we
[2:24:40] go a little higher
[2:24:41] we feel good for a while
[2:24:43] then something else comes along and it
[2:24:45] moves us so we go oh i feel drawn a
[2:24:48] little higher i feel drawn a little
[2:24:50] higher i keep pulling up i get more
[2:24:53] mature he starts feeding me more it
[2:24:56] makes me want to grow more all the time
[2:24:59] without even realizing it i'm moving
[2:25:02] towards the finish line
[2:25:06] i'm being raptured without even
[2:25:08] realizing it
[2:25:19] and he talks about his pastor now listen
[2:25:20] what he says here
[2:25:22] he says oh because in the
[2:25:25] the
[2:25:26] 100 verse 153 peop they say the days of
[2:25:30] miracles last that's only telepathy some
[2:25:33] kind of mind reading discernment all
[2:25:36] these visions and things that's nonsense
[2:25:37] see they are chickens
[2:25:40] they don't
[2:25:41] know
[2:25:42] what eagle
[2:25:44] food is
[2:25:47] what we're talking about this morning's
[2:25:49] eagle food
[2:25:51] it's only for the bodies
[2:25:55] that were created
[2:25:58] the dirt
[2:26:00] around the seed
[2:26:02] that was created to be quickened
[2:26:05] can you believe jack's in your body
[2:26:08] all that it is
[2:26:10] though i might look at you and you got
[2:26:12] rad ears and rat tails i don't care what
[2:26:14] i see
[2:26:16] he knows he's going to take that body
[2:26:19] and he's going to quicken it
[2:26:21] he's going to take that dirt
[2:26:26] and he's going to bring that dirt
[2:26:28] subject to the word
[2:26:31] please this morning get rid of the
[2:26:34] condemnation
[2:26:37] he knows what he's going to quicken
[2:26:40] he knows what dirt he's going to change
[2:26:43] you ever hear this saying they got dirt
[2:26:46] on you
[2:26:51] well you got dirt on you
[2:26:57] you got sinful flesh you got dirt you
[2:26:59] were born in sin shape the iniquity came
[2:27:02] in the world speaking lies he who say
[2:27:04] that he sinneth not is a liar
[2:27:07] sure you're dirt
[2:27:09] but what's he telling us
[2:27:13] in the
[2:27:14] storehouse was a promise of a spark
[2:27:19] that in its season
[2:27:21] when the church was mature enough to eat
[2:27:23] it he was going to bring that spark
[2:27:26] forth and start transforming those
[2:27:29] bodies and bringing them into perfect
[2:27:32] subjection to god's word hallelujah
[2:27:39] oh i'm looking forward to that
[2:27:44] every time i fall i can stand and say oh
[2:27:46] satan you did that
[2:27:48] who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:27:50] god's elect for the seed of god remains
[2:27:53] in me if the seed of god remains in me
[2:27:55] then i have thus saith the lord that he
[2:27:58] will quicken the dirt around that seed
[2:28:07] listen
[2:28:08] present tense
[2:28:10] resurrection
[2:28:12] but brother
[2:28:15] when you hear that scream
[2:28:18] there's something in you
[2:28:20] you're an eagle
[2:28:22] to begin with why
[2:28:24] you are the seed
[2:28:26] that
[2:28:27] resurrection
[2:28:29] of the s-o-n
[2:28:32] has
[2:28:33] dawned
[2:28:37] right
[2:28:39] so when you hear the
[2:28:41] voice
[2:28:45] and you hear the message
[2:28:47] that means the resurrection is in its
[2:28:49] what
[2:28:50] dawn
[2:28:53] now you're growing
[2:28:54] into it
[2:28:57] we're closing up now
[2:29:03] and the
[2:29:04] wave sheaths
[2:29:06] upon the earth
[2:29:09] to make you
[2:29:10] recognize
[2:29:12] that you are an eagle
[2:29:16] the resurrection of the sun
[2:29:18] has dawned
[2:29:21] there's a sheaf off
[2:29:24] waved over the earth
[2:29:26] to make you recognize that what
[2:29:29] you're not a chicken
[2:29:32] you're not as
[2:29:33] just a sinner
[2:29:35] you're the sons and daughters of god
[2:29:38] whose names are written
[2:29:40] on the lamb's book of life
[2:29:44] it brings you to the realization of that
[2:29:47] and then when that comes to the
[2:29:48] realization look as we go down here now
[2:29:52] he says that's the dawn so that's the
[2:29:54] first step now if the spirit that raised
[2:29:57] him from the dead the word the dynamics
[2:30:00] of the word dwells in you it will also
[2:30:04] quicken your mortal body
[2:30:06] now how we flesh
[2:30:09] now how we flesh of his flesh
[2:30:13] and bone of his bone
[2:30:15] because quickly
[2:30:17] well we
[2:30:18] were yet mortal sinners
[2:30:21] mortal
[2:30:24] ready to die
[2:30:26] these bodies it quickened that body
[2:30:31] what's quicken brings it to life
[2:30:34] the spirit that once used to like
[2:30:36] drink and run around commit adultery all
[2:30:39] the things is quickened why the thing
[2:30:42] died you are
[2:30:44] resurrected
[2:30:47] it quickens your
[2:30:49] mortal body
[2:30:54] i'm resurrected
[2:30:58] i mean there's a present
[2:31:01] day
[2:31:02] resurrection
[2:31:05] you come out of
[2:31:07] everything that's death
[2:31:13] let's just finish up now with paragraph
[2:31:15] 156
[2:31:17] therefore your bodies
[2:31:20] is the temple of the dynamics because
[2:31:23] why
[2:31:24] from the beginning
[2:31:26] you were apart of the mechanics oh
[2:31:30] there
[2:31:31] is
[2:31:32] your
[2:31:33] resurrection
[2:31:40] what are you looking for
[2:31:45] why are you all looking for a
[2:31:47] resurrection someplace else
[2:31:53] if this body is quickened
[2:31:55] and it's brought to life
[2:31:57] he that liveth shall never see death
[2:32:02] amen
[2:32:03] speaking of the past church
[2:32:06] he says those that are dead they shall
[2:32:09] they shall have life
[2:32:11] and you should not taste death
[2:32:15] if this earthly body be what
[2:32:17] dissolve i have one waiting for me
[2:32:22] i'm quickened
[2:32:23] this body is quickened
[2:32:26] it's changed in the twinkling of an eye
[2:32:30] you say what's the resurrection the
[2:32:33] resurrection
[2:32:34] is when he sends that life
[2:32:37] he sends that spark
[2:32:39] you can't bring it you can't bring
[2:32:41] yourself into subjection you can't set
[2:32:44] new rules you can have a new form of
[2:32:46] life it's absolutely a promise to you
[2:32:50] because you've recognized you're an
[2:32:53] eagle that eagle was in the barnyard
[2:32:56] full of bugs full of dirt never flown in
[2:32:59] its life but once that sheep offering
[2:33:02] came and revealed it was an eagle it was
[2:33:05] now promised
[2:33:08] that that chicken body
[2:33:12] mentality he was living in would now be
[2:33:15] transformed and his
[2:33:18] body would actually take on the spirit
[2:33:22] of an eagle
[2:33:26] he was resurrected
[2:33:30] out of the barnyard
[2:33:32] and that's what
[2:33:34] that's what he he said
[2:33:37] uh uh about
[2:33:39] that eagle he said what a resurrection
[2:33:42] it was
[2:33:44] he says there's your resurrection there
[2:33:47] is the church in the resurrection with
[2:33:50] him
[2:33:50] these bodies
[2:33:52] right now
[2:33:54] are quickened see
[2:33:56] you've heard
[2:33:58] you believed
[2:33:59] it changed you
[2:34:01] from denomination
[2:34:03] to
[2:34:04] the word
[2:34:08] now you may not have been in the
[2:34:09] nomination church domination
[2:34:12] but we were always in some form
[2:34:15] of denomination
[2:34:17] denomination is man's rule
[2:34:20] over your flesh
[2:34:23] i hope you understand it
[2:34:26] we're in a present
[2:34:28] tense resurrection
[2:34:32] the church has matured
[2:34:34] to the place
[2:34:37] if you can
[2:34:39] be hungry
[2:34:41] that god has come to the place
[2:34:45] that that spark
[2:34:48] is ready to touch
[2:34:50] the gasoline
[2:34:52] the word
[2:34:53] that's in us
[2:34:58] do you anticipate it
[2:35:01] do you believe it's for you
[2:35:03] do you believe it's possible
[2:35:06] don't let the battle
[2:35:10] that's in your mind
[2:35:12] what did god give you
[2:35:14] to defeat
[2:35:16] your mind
[2:35:18] he gave you his promised word
[2:35:21] heaven and earth will pass away
[2:35:24] but my word will not pass away
[2:35:27] if i said
[2:35:29] that i will quicken your body
[2:35:32] and this is the lord speaking and i said
[2:35:35] that i would transform your body
[2:35:38] into it becoming
[2:35:40] perfectly subjected to the word
[2:35:44] you cannot take the failures of your
[2:35:47] flesh and make the word of god of none
[2:35:50] effect
[2:35:54] his word will prevail
