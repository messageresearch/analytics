[29:15] the power, Lord Jesus, to tread in that

[29:21] everything we ever desired. more than
[29:23] silver, more than gold, more than
[29:25] anything we can ever achieve in this
[29:27] world. Lord, that at the end of it all,
[29:30] Lord Jesus Christ, it would be worth it.
[29:32] Oh Lord, blessed be your holy name, oh

[29:38] Jesus, to your hand and the prayer
[29:39] request, oh Lord. God of heaven, there

[37:20] Father. And we trust that we will always
[37:23] give you thanks. We ask these things in
[37:26] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. If you have
[37:30] your Bibles, let's just open to a
[37:32] scripture this evening. And uh and uh uh
[37:39] one found in uh Mark the
[37:43] 16th chapter and the 15th 16th 7th 18th
[37:49] verse of this. I'm sure you all have
[37:52] this memorized, but uh you'll see how it
[37:55] fits in this evening. It says, "For he
[37:59] said unto them, go ye into all the world
[38:02] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[38:06] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[38:09] be saved, but he that believeth not
[38:12] shall be damned. And these signs shall
[38:15] follow them that believe. In my name
[38:19] they shall cast out devils. They shall
[38:22] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[38:24] up serpents. And if they drink any
[38:27] deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.
[38:30] And they shall lay hands on the sick and
[38:33] they shall recover. Our gracious
[38:36] heavenly father, we ask you to bless
[38:38] your word to us this evening. In Jesus
[38:41] precious name we pray. Amen. May you may
[38:45] be seated.
[38:48] I I certainly enjoyed the uh specials
[38:52] and the harmony and the and the singing
[38:55] of the two specials. I thought that was
[38:58] uh really wonderful. We had a musician's
[39:02] practice uh this last weekend and and uh
[39:05] we've got lots of uh talent and lots of
[39:09] different instruments and things and
[39:11] we're going to slowly incorporate them
[39:13] in uh as we prepare the sound and get
[39:17] everything to have it and get the uh
[39:20] levels of sound all worked out. So uh um
[39:24] we just keep doing those things. We'll
[39:26] probably have to make the platform a
[39:28] little bigger. Never thought this
[39:30] platform wouldn't be big enough, but uh
[39:33] we'll do what we can. Amen. So we talked
[39:36] this morning and uh out of the message
[39:41] in his presence and we realized that uh
[39:46] we
[39:47] noticed certain things about uh the
[39:51] presence of God and uh we knew found out
[39:55] that it always had a great effect that
[39:59] people that come in to his presence
[40:02] there's just a holy hush about the
[40:05] presence. The presence of God causes
[40:09] things to happen and something always
[40:12] happens in the presence of God. And uh
[40:16] he said when man's conscious that he's
[40:19] in the presence of God, he feels very
[40:22] little. And uh he he realizes that he's
[40:26] a a a sinner. And uh uh and so we we
[40:34] listened to a little bit this morning of
[40:36] the effect that the presence of God has
[40:41] on a believer. So we realize there's an
[40:44] effect that when you come into the
[40:46] presence of God, we found that the
[40:48] presence of God takes control over the
[40:52] whole circumstance.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; When his presence is there, everything
[40:55] else stops. There's not another voice.
[40:59] There's not another answer. Uh you it's
[41:04] time to listen.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The presence of God is there.
[41:08] There's there's there everything bows to
[41:12] that presence. It it's the it it is it
[41:17] becomes the atmosphere.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; The presence of God does. Now we want to
[41:22] listen to a portion this evening of and
[41:27] it starts to lean to the fact that
[41:30] through the blood of the Lord Jesus
[41:32] Christ we are now able to come into his
[41:37] presence. The the on the Mount Si they
[41:42] said if God speaks to us we will surely
[41:44] die. Let Moses speak to us. That was the
[41:48] first time that man recognized that they
[41:50] needed a mediator between God and man.
[41:54] And they was promised that God would
[41:56] send us a prophet like it unto Moses.
[41:59] And then we had that prophet come and
[42:02] and the Lord Jesus Christ, the lamb of
[42:04] God, which paid the price for our sins
[42:08] and allows us to enter in to his
[42:12] presence. Now, we're going to listen to
[42:15] the responsibility
[42:19] of the believer who comes into the
[42:22] presence of God. And so there's uh we
[42:26] just want to uh make sure that uh we
[42:30] pick up on some of these things.
[42:32] Something like this. He says, "Look at
[42:33] the little lady. She couldn't stay no
[42:37] longer. She went into the city and told
[42:40] the men, "Come see the man that told me
[42:45] the things I've done."
[42:48] Isn't this the Messiah? They could not
[42:51] deny it because it was scripturally
[42:54] certain.
[42:56] Yes, you've got to do it. a man when
[43:00] he's got a responsibility
[43:02] of telling others as Moses did, as Peter
[43:06] did, as Paul did. And after these
[43:10] things, if you've seen it and come into
[43:12] his presence, you're responsible for the
[43:16] message to get it to somebody else. You
[43:20] just can't sit still with it. You must
[43:23] take it to someone else. Let's listen as
[43:28] he expounds upon that and and we see
[43:32] what it is that we want to be. We want
[43:35] to be people full of his presence in his
[43:38] presence have the effect of that
[43:41] presence on our lives and to share that
[43:45] presence
[43:46] with others. Lord bless you. This is
[43:49] just uh it just take a few minutes. I
[43:52] think we maybe have about 40 minutes
[43:54] left of the tape, but I think you'll
[43:57] certainly enjoy it. It's full of
[43:59] nuggets. I mean, it's just full of
[44:01] wonderful little uh nuggets and sayings
[44:05] and understandings, and you reach out
[44:08] and grab a hold of something for your
[44:10] life that that you can take with you uh
[44:15] in your life's journey. And when you put
[44:18] these building blocks in your life,
[44:20] you'll find out there will come a time
[44:22] in your life when you're glad they're
[44:24] there, that you can pull them out of
[44:26] your heart because you've written them
[44:28] upon your heart and then they become
[44:31] your defense in the time of battle. So
[44:34] Lord bless you as we listen to our
[44:36] messenger continue uh this evening. And
[44:40] I think we're going to start right at
[44:42] paragraph uh 37, I believe, and uh start
[44:48] at the top of paragraph 37 and continue
[44:53] uh from there. He says some people will
[44:55] will stand off. Let's let's listen. I
[44:58] think you'll enjoy it tonight. God bless
[45:00] you.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Make fun of it. Some will laugh at it.
[45:05] Some will call it fanaticism. Some call
[45:07] it mental telepathy.
[45:09] Some call it
[45:10] &gt;&gt; be elimub.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Some call it one thing or another.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; As the old proverbs say is fools will
[45:16] walk with hobb shoes where angels prayer
[45:19] to try.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:22] &gt;&gt; The fool has said in his heart there is
[45:24] no God. When he sees God manifested so
[45:27] perfectly by his own word, not by a
[45:30] creed but by his word and then walk
[45:32] right over it and make fun of it, he's a
[45:33] fool.
[45:35] Because as God is the word and God's
[45:37] made himself plain to him
[45:39] &gt;&gt; and he's a fool, the Bible says,
[45:42] &gt;&gt; what will it be for him when he has to
[45:44] stand in that place? It'll be a it'll be
[45:47] terrible for that man in that day, the
[45:49] ungodly.
[45:51] Repented sinners, old doesn't have any
[45:54] fear. Oh no. A sinner that will repent,
[45:58] he knows that there's a bloody sacrifice
[46:00] waiting and standing his way.
[46:03] That's what gives me the consolation.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; I've seen the glory of God. I've felt
[46:09] his power. I know the touch of his hand.
[46:12] I know the touch of his chastisement. I
[46:14] know that he's God. And I know I'm
[46:17] undone. But there's one standing there
[46:19] firing.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; There's one that stands there and says,
[46:23] "Father, lay all of his iniquity upon me
[46:26] because he stood for me down on the
[46:28] earth."
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then I walk to the throne of
[46:30] God boldly having grace in my heart that
[46:33] know it's not by good works but by his
[46:35] mercy I'm saved. Not what I could do,
[46:38] what I could join, what I could say. But
[46:40] it's by his grace that he saved me.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Go the poet that caught that scream.
[46:48] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that
[46:50] saved the rest like me. Once was lost,
[46:53] but now I'm found. Blind, but now I see.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; How can I ever go to heaven? How could
[46:59] you go to heaven? We cannot do it. We
[47:01] need no way for us to do it. But there's
[47:03] one made the way.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; And he is the way.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; And how do we get to him? By one spirit,
[47:09] his spirit. We're baptized into one body
[47:13] which will be raised up like an orbit.
[47:15] We'll go out of the earth
[47:17] &gt;&gt; as astronauts of this last day of faith.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Sure. Repented sinners don't have to
[47:25] worry. Someone is there in their place.
[47:28] Oh, then after we have come into his
[47:32] presence now
[47:34] &gt;&gt; and we are know we've been in his
[47:36] presence. We've seen do things that he
[47:38] did when he was here on earth.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; How do you know that? How do you know
[47:41] the vine you're looking at? Because of
[47:43] fruit it bears.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; How do you know the church you're going
[47:46] to by the fruit it bear?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "He that believeth on me,
[47:50] the works that I do shall he do also."
[47:53] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that
[47:54] believe.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we see he never did ordain us
[47:58] to go make denominations.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; He never did ordain us to go make creeds
[48:04] but he warned us against such.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; For whosoever shall take anything from
[48:08] it or add anything to it, the same will
[48:10] be taken out of their part in the book
[48:12] of life.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; So we're not ordained to do nothing but
[48:16] stay with that word.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; And if a man is stand of God, he'll stay
[48:20] with the word because God can only stand
[48:22] by his word.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Stay by his word. Then when we come into
[48:29] his presence, when a man once comes into
[48:32] the presence of God, he's changed
[48:33] forever.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; If there's any change in doing
[48:38] &gt;&gt; now, there are those who can walk in the
[48:41] presence of God and pay no attention to
[48:42] it. He wasn't ordained to life. But if
[48:45] he was predestinated of God, as soon as
[48:47] that first move hits, he knows it.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; That catches fire. Look at that little
[48:52] prostitute down there that day. at
[48:54] Samaria. That woman, she's in a bad
[48:57] shape mentally and physically. We know
[48:59] that. But as soon as she's seen that
[49:02] sign done of Messiah, she said, "We know
[49:05] Messiah's coming to do this.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Thou must be his prophet." He said, "I'm
[49:09] that Messiah that was wrote to come."
[49:12] She recognized it. She never asked one
[49:14] more question. She started right quick
[49:16] with the responsibility to know that if
[49:18] she had found that and come into the
[49:20] presence of God, she was responsible to
[49:22] tell somebody else about it. Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Any man that comes into the presence of
[49:31] God is responsible.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Before God from that minute on to tell
[49:36] somebody else,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; look at Abraham. Look at Moses. Look at
[49:42] Peter. Look at Paul. The moment they
[49:46] come into the presence of God, recognize
[49:48] themselves sinners, and seal their
[49:50] testimony with their life.
[49:53] Look at the little lady. She couldn't
[49:54] stay no longer. She went to the city and
[49:57] told the man, "Come see the man that
[49:59] told me the things I've done. Isn't this
[50:01] Messiah?"
[50:02] &gt;&gt; They could not deny it because it was
[50:04] scriptural. Certainly. Yes. They've got
[50:06] to do it. And man, when we got a
[50:08] responsibility of telling others as
[50:10] Moses did, as Peter did, as Paul did,
[50:13] after these things, you've seen it and
[50:15] come into his presence, you're
[50:17] responsible for the message to get to
[50:20] somebody else.
[50:23] You just cannot sit still with it.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; You must take it to someone else.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; I remember an old sister used to be your
[50:29] brother Grimstein's mother. She used to
[50:32] sit right here in the church and she
[50:34] would sing, "I've just got over. I'm
[50:37] running running. I just got over and I
[50:39] can't sit down." She had just found
[50:42] something.
[50:43] I went over to a little colored church
[50:45] over here and lo and all of them stand
[50:47] up saying I'm running up the king's
[50:50] highway just found it and tuck up the
[50:52] highway. There's something about it.
[50:54] When you find Christ, you cannot hold
[50:57] your peace any longer. The rest of your
[51:00] days you are a changed person.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; For when life and life comes together,
[51:06] it makes a bright light.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; True. When the bulb connects with the
[51:11] wires, if it's a correct bulb, it's got
[51:14] to give light.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; When the current and the bulb gets
[51:17] together, there's nothing to do but
[51:18] scatter light.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; It has to do it.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And when a man or a woman is
[51:24] predestinated to eternal life and they
[51:27] see the current of God catch that bub,
[51:29] it'll throw light everywhere it can.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; It might not be over a 10 watt, but
[51:34] you'll scatter what life you got.
[51:38] You're in a 500 watt scatter 10 watt
[51:40] light.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Give your light. Let your light so shine
[51:44] before man that they might see your good
[51:47] works and glorify the father which is in
[51:49] heaven. Yes, sir. When a man comes in
[51:52] contact with God, he recognizes himself
[51:55] no good. How can a man walk around brag
[51:58] about how big he is and what all he's
[52:00] done when he's nothing?
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He's nothing to begin with. One day down
[52:05] in Memphis, Tennessee, one I don't think
[52:07] it's Memphis is one of the places there.
[52:09] I was with brother Davis is having a a
[52:11] revival. It might have been Memphis. And
[52:13] we was went to a coliseum and they had a
[52:17] in there the not a coliseum, it's kind
[52:19] of a art gallery. And they had the great
[52:22] statues that they' got from different
[52:23] parts of the earth of different Hercules
[52:26] and so forth and great artists that
[52:28] painted and then they had the analysis
[52:30] of a man that weighed 150 pounds. You
[52:33] know how much he's worth? 84 cents.
[52:36] That's all he is. 84 cents is all he all
[52:39] the chemicals you can get out of him.
[52:41] He's just got enough white wash to
[52:43] sprinkle a hen's nest and he's got
[52:45] enough of just a little bit of calcium,
[52:47] little pash. It would all sell for 84
[52:49] cents. But we just take care of that 84
[52:52] cents and baby it around. There's two
[52:54] boys stand there and one looked at him
[52:55] and said, "Jim, we're not worth very
[52:56] much, are we?" He said, "No, we're not,
[52:58] John." I said, "Well, wait a minute,
[53:00] boys. You got a soul in there. It's
[53:01] worth 10,000 words.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; That's been could be redeemed by the
[53:06] power of God if you just let it. Man,
[53:09] when he sees these things, he's
[53:10] responsible to tell others.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; I saw it when I was just a boy. I spent
[53:14] my whole life at it. I only saw I got
[53:16] one life. Wish I had 10,000. If I had an
[53:19] eternity, I'd still want to tell people
[53:21] about it because it's the greatest thing
[53:23] I ever found.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; If you'll read in Ezekiel 33, 33rd
[53:26] chapter of Ezekiel, there was a watchman
[53:29] set on a tower. And this watchman was
[53:32] responsible
[53:33] &gt;&gt; for the entire city.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, wake yourselves to your
[53:39] spiritual conscience a minute while I
[53:42] get to this scripture.
[53:44] That watchman had to be a trained man.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; He had to know what he was doing.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; For at any distance, as soon as it
[53:53] arose, the enemy, he could detect it.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; He could tell their march. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; He could tell their color.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; He could tell their rank and file.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Just as far as the human eyes could see,
[54:06] he could see it. And he was higher than
[54:09] the rest of them.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; For he was trained to know the enemy.
[54:13] And God required the whole city at his
[54:16] hand.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Watchmen for the night. Hallelujah.
[54:21] That's the way God's soldiers are today.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; They're trained to the word. Amen.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; When anything concepts got a little
[54:29] polish to it that's got something else
[54:30] that's not scripture, they warn the
[54:33] congregation.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Anything that's not Bible, anything
[54:36] that's not it's not godlike. Such as
[54:39] having soup suppers, dances, and
[54:42] everything else to pay off the pastors.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Those things are wrong. Bo games and
[54:47] card parties in the churches. That's
[54:50] wrong. Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And the real watchman on the wall who's
[54:54] once been in the presence of God.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; If he isn't on the wall, if he just to
[54:59] be on the wall, the wall may not be any
[55:01] higher than the rest of the
[55:02] congregation.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; But if he's a correct watchman, God
[55:06] raises it pull up into spheres that the
[55:08] rest of them never gets to.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; But he watches the flock
[55:12] &gt;&gt; and God requires it of him.
[55:16] The man of God who stands in the
[55:18] presence of God and knows God is God and
[55:21] know that God keeps his word and watch
[55:23] God perform himself and do his duty and
[55:27] keep his word. Then no matter how many
[55:29] organizations or denomination cause to
[55:31] tear it down, he knows the rank and file
[55:33] of the enemy. Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; He knows what to tell the congregation.
[55:41] A real watchman.
[55:45] If we have confessed that he is in we've
[55:48] been in his presence and we have
[55:50] confessed our sins, they are blotted out
[55:54] the book of his memory. Now there's
[55:57] nobody but God could do that.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Now you can do anything to me. I'll
[56:01] forgive you but I'll remember.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; If I do anything to you, you forgive me,
[56:07] but you'll remember it. But God can
[56:10] forgive and forget it.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Don't even remember it.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; That makes me feel good.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; When it's not even remembered anymore,
[56:25] nothing can do it but God.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing but God can do that.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; He said he would blot it out of his book
[56:36] of memory.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I can't do it. You can't do it because
[56:41] we've only got these little finite
[56:42] senses. But he's infinite God. He can
[56:46] absolutely forget that it ever was done.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; A young lady come from a country church
[56:58] and her father was an oldfashioned
[57:01] shouting preacher or member of the
[57:04] church. And so she moved into the city
[57:06] and she got all mixed up with the women
[57:09] down there. Got to acting like they did
[57:11] and the fashions. And one day she's kind
[57:14] of shamed for her papa and mama to come
[57:16] or a father rather. Her mother was dead.
[57:19] So the old man only thing to do get up
[57:21] in the morning, eat his breakfast and
[57:23] get the Bible and read it and cry and
[57:26] pray and shout all day long and up and
[57:27] down the roof. And she was a little
[57:29] embarrassed about it. So then then when
[57:32] all time through the night if he got a
[57:35] hold of the Bible and started reading
[57:36] it, get raised up out of the Ben heart.
[57:38] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[57:42] God. Just stomping cry half the night.
[57:46] So one day she's going to entertain her
[57:49] church members to a little tea party
[57:52] like they always have, you know. So she
[57:56] didn't know what she's going to do with
[57:57] her dad. After all, it was her daddy. So
[58:00] she decided she put him up in an attic
[58:03] and say, "Daddy, you don't want to be
[58:04] around where these women are, do you?"
[58:06] "Oh, I don't believe I want to do that."
[58:08] He said, "Well, we're going to have the
[58:10] church women up here today and we're
[58:12] going to have a little meeting, a little
[58:14] prayer meeting. So I I tell you, Dad,
[58:16] why don't you just go up and add him?"
[58:18] Said, "I just believe I'll do that." So
[58:20] she said, "Read this nice book." And she
[58:23] gave him a geography,
[58:26] took his Bible away from him so he keep
[58:28] quiet. So know if he read the Bible,
[58:31] well, he would go to making a lot of
[58:32] noise up there. So he's right up over,
[58:35] you know, where he's having their party.
[58:37] So she gave him a jog and he said, "This
[58:39] is nice. You should read it, daddy,
[58:42] because it tells you all the truth about
[58:44] the word." Well, he said, "I'll be glad
[58:46] to read that." So he said, "Now you go
[58:48] up there and keep real quiet till these
[58:50] women leave and then I'll you come back
[58:52] down and then you can do whatever you
[58:53] want to." He agreed to do it. So he goes
[58:56] upstairs, sets up there, and they're all
[58:58] having their tea party, you know,
[58:59] talking about so and so and you know how
[59:01] it goes. Having all that big time about
[59:04] that time, something cut loose upstairs.
[59:08] All the screaming and jumping and the
[59:10] plaster falling. The old man running up
[59:12] and down through the attic just as hard
[59:14] as he could go, jumping up and down.
[59:17] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[59:21] The women didn't know what happened up
[59:22] there, what they had upstairs.
[59:24] So directly down the steps he come hard
[59:27] as he could go. She said, "Daddy, I'll
[59:29] give you a geography to read." Said,
[59:30] "Yes, I know it." You know, said, "I was
[59:33] reading in this geography here where
[59:35] these places in the sea that ain't got
[59:36] no bottom in it." And said, "I read over
[59:39] here in the Bible yesterday." He said,
[59:40] "He put my sins in the sea of
[59:42] forgetless. Glory to God.
[59:46] God,
[59:51] &gt;&gt; said they're still going. They don't
[59:52] have it in. They just keep on going.
[59:54] That's right. And he was shouting about
[59:57] it. Well, that's right.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; God puts our sins
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; in the sea of forgetfulness.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Bls them out and there as if they never
[1:00:09] did happen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Then we stand by the grace of God
[1:00:17] through Jesus Christ our Lord. pure and
[1:00:20] holy just as holy as he was.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't see me when I come up
[1:00:26] there, he sees his own son.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; The only way he can see can't see me
[1:00:33] because I'm in his son
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; and he only sees his son. Isn't that
[1:00:40] wonderful?
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; We don't have to think about sins
[1:00:42] anymore. It's all gone. It's under the
[1:00:45] blood.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Don't have to worry about
[1:00:48] anymore. It's all out of the and out of
[1:00:51] God's memory. You don't even remember it
[1:00:53] no more. Isaiah, that mighty prophet,
[1:00:57] when he confessed his sins, he said,
[1:00:59] "Woe is me,
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; for I'm a man of unclean lips, a
[1:01:03] prophet.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips, and my
[1:01:08] congregation's unclean.
[1:01:12] The people I preach to, they're unclean.
[1:01:15] I'm unclean. And woe is me." But here
[1:01:18] comes a bunch of angels down from the
[1:01:20] glory of God fanning back the the
[1:01:23] clouds. And I look up there and sees
[1:01:25] train filling the whole heaven.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And I watch these angels that's never
[1:01:30] know what sin was. They never even know
[1:01:33] what sin was.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And there in the presence of God, they
[1:01:37] got two wings over their faces. They got
[1:01:39] two wings over their feet. And they're
[1:01:41] flying with two wings. And they cry day
[1:01:43] and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
[1:01:45] God."
[1:01:47] That make you feel kind of unholy,
[1:01:49] wouldn't it?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Now, what did he do? He said, "Woe is
[1:01:55] me."
[1:01:57] And when he confessed his sins and said,
[1:01:59] "Woe is me." The angel went over and
[1:02:02] tucked the tongues, picked up a coal of
[1:02:04] fire, which represent the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:06] fire, and come over and laid it on the
[1:02:08] prophet's lips and said, "I've cleansed
[1:02:10] you."
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:14] Then the wings of winning their way like
[1:02:16] that moved away the curtains of time and
[1:02:19] he heard God say, "Who will go for us?"
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; But after he found out that there was a
[1:02:25] way to rid sin, God wanted somebody to
[1:02:28] go for him and he said, "Here am I send
[1:02:30] me."
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God and
[1:02:34] had confessed his sins and been cleansed
[1:02:37] from his sins and was ready for service.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; As the poet caught that said, millions
[1:02:46] now in sin and shame are dying. Listen
[1:02:49] to their sad and bitter cry. Hasten,
[1:02:51] brother, hasten to their rescue. Quickly
[1:02:54] answer, "Master, here am I." And I think
[1:02:58] of Africa, India, and around the world.
[1:03:01] Millions of healings screaming and
[1:03:03] crying for mercy. And who will go? Not
[1:03:06] pass him a track, but bring him Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody in his presence like Moses who
[1:03:12] could go down there and show them true
[1:03:14] deliverance. Not make them join a church
[1:03:16] or shake hands and have a creep, but
[1:03:18] bring deliverance to their soul.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Some good godly man. Yes. Isaiah
[1:03:23] confessed his sins and was cleansed.
[1:03:26] After Jacob had wrestled all night in
[1:03:30] confessing his sins, do you remember the
[1:03:32] place he was? It's called Pental. P N I
[1:03:36] T E L. Pentle.
[1:03:38] The word pimple in the Hebrew means the
[1:03:41] face of almighty God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Jacob the little shy
[1:03:49] had run all his name was Jacob which
[1:03:51] means suppler that's deceiver had run
[1:03:54] all of his life away from God. But when
[1:03:56] he got one time in the presence of God
[1:03:59] at pinthal in the face of God he got a
[1:04:02] hold of God and it wouldn't turn him
[1:04:04] loose.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; God we need more Jacobs.
[1:04:08] He held on to the face of God in the
[1:04:12] presence of God. He stayed until it was
[1:04:16] sun up. God said, "Let me go
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; because the sun's rising." And he stayed
[1:04:22] in the face of God until sun up. But he
[1:04:24] went away justified and saved.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great thing it was now
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; to know that he had wrestled through.
[1:04:33] That's he had seen signs of God. He had
[1:04:36] had dreams about God. But this is one
[1:04:38] time he was in the face of God. In the
[1:04:41] presence of God.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends, now as we hurry
[1:04:45] up. In the presence of God, a man's
[1:04:48] changed. Jacob was changed. Now he could
[1:04:51] walk with God. Yes. He was a different
[1:04:54] man than what he was when he went up
[1:04:55] there. The battle was now over. Yes,
[1:04:58] sir. And he begin to build an altar. He
[1:05:01] hadn't been used to building altars, you
[1:05:02] know. But I tell you, when you come in
[1:05:05] the presence of God, you want to build
[1:05:07] an altar somewhere.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; You want to find somewhere where you can
[1:05:10] pray. He built an altar. He was
[1:05:12] cleansed. And God had won. And Jacob was
[1:05:17] changed from Jacob's suppler to Israel,
[1:05:21] a prince having power with God.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; That's what happened to Jacob. The
[1:05:27] suppler, the deceiver, the unrighteous,
[1:05:31] the unholy, the deceiver, deceived his
[1:05:35] brother,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; stole the birthrights, as it was from
[1:05:38] his brother, took a little dirty way of
[1:05:41] doing it. Such a deceiver, he deceived
[1:05:43] his father-in-law. Put popper sticks and
[1:05:46] made speckled calves. When the cows been
[1:05:48] pregnant, he come out, look at the
[1:05:49] sheep, would see that speckled stick,
[1:05:51] make speckled cattle, give them birth
[1:05:53] marks. deceiver, deceiving his own
[1:05:56] father-in-law, deceived his mother,
[1:05:58] deceived his daddy, deceived his
[1:06:00] brother. But when he once got in the he
[1:06:03] was a shyer, he was running everywhere
[1:06:05] he went. Always on the run from God.
[1:06:07] He's on the run from his brother. But
[1:06:09] when he come into the presence of God,
[1:06:11] he recognized he was a sinner.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; What did he do? What did he do? He seen
[1:06:18] his opportunity. He had met something
[1:06:20] that he didn't even think about before.
[1:06:22] And he stayed there until all sins was
[1:06:25] gone.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God got him in his own presence.
[1:06:32] God manages a way to get man in their
[1:06:33] presence. Then they make their decision.
[1:06:36] Some of them run from him. Some run to
[1:06:38] him. If they're predestinated to life,
[1:06:40] they believe it. They hang on to it. If
[1:06:41] they're not, they try to get away and
[1:06:43] say there's nothing to it. See?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And that's the guy that's lost. The guy
[1:06:47] that confesses his sin shall have
[1:06:49] pardon. If you hide your sin, you'll not
[1:06:51] prosper. No. So, Jacob when he it was
[1:06:54] the next day he met Esau his brother. He
[1:06:58] didn't need no help from him there.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't need his armies. He isn't
[1:07:02] business building altars.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; He wasn't afraid of Esau no more. Psalms
[1:07:11] 168.
[1:07:12] David said, "I have set the Lord before
[1:07:15] me." That's a good thing to me. Psalm
[1:07:19] 168, I set the Lord before me so he
[1:07:22] could not be confused about it. Uh he
[1:07:28] wanted to be conscious of his presence.
[1:07:30] So David said, "I have set the Lord
[1:07:33] always before my face."
[1:07:36] Now I David have set the Lord before my
[1:07:40] face. Always to be conscience conscious
[1:07:44] of God's presence. Wouldn't that be a
[1:07:47] good lesson for all of us tonight?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Set the Lord before a face so we'll be
[1:07:51] conscious of his presence.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Putty him first.
[1:07:56] Why? Put him first before you. Why? Then
[1:08:00] you won't sin. When you are realizing
[1:08:03] that constantly you're in the presence
[1:08:05] of God.
[1:08:07] When you realize God's around, you watch
[1:08:10] what you say.
[1:08:12] A man when he thinks God's gone, he'll
[1:08:15] cuss.
[1:08:17] He'll lust after women. He'll do he'll
[1:08:21] steal, cheat, lie. He'll do anything
[1:08:25] when he thinks that God don't see him.
[1:08:27] But bring him into the presence of God,
[1:08:30] he'll stop it right now.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; And David said, "I have put the Lord
[1:08:35] always before me."
[1:08:38] That's a good thing. No wonder God sent
[1:08:40] his man after his own heart. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Man will do everything when he thinks
[1:08:44] that God is near. But when he realizes
[1:08:46] that God's near, you ever notice a
[1:08:48] sinner? Let a godly person walk up.
[1:08:50] He'll quit his cursing.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; He's got any respects at all.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; He won't tell the dirty jokes that he
[1:08:56] would have told. See, see, you leave off
[1:08:58] that because he knows that he's in the
[1:09:00] presence of God because God dwells in
[1:09:02] the tabernacle of his people. See, after
[1:09:05] David did this, he said, "My heart shall
[1:09:09] rejoice." So we should read Psalm 16. My
[1:09:13] heart will rejoice and my flesh shall
[1:09:16] rest in hope.
[1:09:18] Why? My heart shall rejoice because I've
[1:09:20] got God before me all the time.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And my flesh shall rest in hope. If I
[1:09:26] die, I'll be raised up again.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; For he'll not suffer his holy one and
[1:09:29] see corruption.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Neither will he leave his soul in hell.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, when David put God before him
[1:09:37] and was conscious that constantly he was
[1:09:40] in the presence of God, seek ye first
[1:09:43] the kingdom of God. Now listen, church,
[1:09:46] I love you. Now I want you to listen to
[1:09:48] me now. As brother McCulla used to say,
[1:09:49] I'm going to say something.
[1:09:52] Always put the Lord before you
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; and don't you do nothing that you
[1:09:56] wouldn't do in his presence
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; because he's watching over you.
[1:10:00] See, the Lord isn't camped about those
[1:10:03] who fear him.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He don't He just stays right near you.
[1:10:06] And he knows everything you're doing.
[1:10:08] And you must recognize that
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; when you start to tell a lie, don't do
[1:10:12] it. Remember, God's listening at you.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; If you start to do a little cheat, don't
[1:10:16] you do it. God's looking at you. If you
[1:10:18] start to take his name in vain, don't do
[1:10:20] it. God's listening at you. Start smoke
[1:10:22] a cigarette, he's watching you.
[1:10:26] is we used to sing a song all along on
[1:10:29] the road to the soul's true abode
[1:10:31] there's an eye watching you every step
[1:10:34] that you take this great eye is awake
[1:10:36] there's an eye watching you
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; remember do like David put the Lord
[1:10:41] always before your face then your heart
[1:10:44] will rejoice
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; and your flesh shall rest in hopeise
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; for he promised it yes sir he knew that
[1:10:50] he had raised up because God had
[1:10:54] promised
[1:10:55] All right.
[1:10:57] When we come into his presence, we're
[1:10:59] changed. Never to be the same. Look all
[1:11:02] down through the ages of every walk of
[1:11:04] life at man. Look at Abraham. You say,
[1:11:07] "Well, the changed life is just for
[1:11:09] ministers." Oh, no. The changed life's
[1:11:12] for everybody.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Now, Abraham was a farmer.
[1:11:18] But when he heard God's voice speaking
[1:11:20] to him and saw that vision, he was a
[1:11:23] changed man from that time on.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He separated himself from his kindred
[1:11:27] from all his associates and walked as a
[1:11:30] pilgrim and a stranger in a strange land
[1:11:32] the rest of his life.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Dwelling in tents because he clearly
[1:11:36] confessed that he was seeking a city
[1:11:38] whose builder and maker was God.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He knowed there was a God and there was
[1:11:42] a city somewhere whose builder and maker
[1:11:43] was God. That's what Hebrews 11 tells us
[1:11:46] that he is seeking the city as builder
[1:11:49] and maker was God. He was a changed man
[1:11:51] yet he was nothing but a mere farmer but
[1:11:54] he saw a vision and come into the
[1:11:55] presence of God and he was a changed man
[1:11:58] from then on. Moses he was a shepherd
[1:12:02] but he was a changed man when he come
[1:12:04] into the presence of God. He was a
[1:12:06] coward. He was running from Pharaoh with
[1:12:09] a whole army behind him. But with a
[1:12:11] stick in his hand, he went back and
[1:12:13] tucked the whole nation.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Why? He come into the presence of God.
[1:12:18] He was a changed man, a shepherd. Peter,
[1:12:22] a fisherman, knew nothing about fishing
[1:12:25] or know nothing about God. Only thing he
[1:12:27] probably know was how to catch fish. But
[1:12:29] when he come in the presence of God and
[1:12:31] see the great creator who could create
[1:12:33] fish, when he told him, "Let down the
[1:12:35] net for the draw," there wasn't any fish
[1:12:37] there. He just pulled his nets up. But
[1:12:39] he said, "At thy word, Lord, I believe
[1:12:41] that you're the son of God. And if you
[1:12:43] let if I let down a net, you told me to
[1:12:45] do it at your word because you and your
[1:12:47] word are the same. I'll let down the
[1:12:49] net."
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And when he began to pull, he said,
[1:12:51] "Depart, Lord. I'm a sinful man."
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; A fisherman.
[1:12:56] After Peter met Christ, he was never the
[1:12:59] same anymore. He afterwards was so true
[1:13:02] to God, he was given the keys to the
[1:13:04] kingdom. Yes, sir. Paul, a self-styled
[1:13:07] Pharisee, educated and trained in all
[1:13:10] the religion of the that there was in
[1:13:12] the world in that day. One of the
[1:13:14] highest known scholars in the land. But
[1:13:16] when he come before that pillar of fire
[1:13:18] one day, the god that he had persecuted
[1:13:22] ignorantly. He was a Pharisee. He didn't
[1:13:25] believe that God was a man.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He know God was a pillar of fire. It led
[1:13:30] his people out of Egypt.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; He had been with him all along. But when
[1:13:34] he saw this pillar of fire, he fell on
[1:13:36] his face and he heard a voice saying,
[1:13:38] "Saul, why persecutest thou me?" He
[1:13:40] said, "Who are you, Lord?" He said, "I'm
[1:13:42] Jesus."
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; He was a man.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And said, "How have you been baptized?"
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He was a changed man from now on.
[1:13:55] You've been in the presence of God. It
[1:13:57] changes a man.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Charles G. Finian, a lawyer,
[1:14:02] a great uh Philadelphia lawyer. But when
[1:14:05] he come into the presence of God, he
[1:14:08] dropped his law study and become a
[1:14:10] mightest preacher of this nation's ever
[1:14:12] had. Yes.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He's a preacher because one day he come
[1:14:16] in the presence of God.
[1:14:19] He thought once he'd study the ministry,
[1:14:21] you know, his book, I got his
[1:14:22] autobiography.
[1:14:23] He went out to pray. He thought he was a
[1:14:25] preacher. He had a desire that he wanted
[1:14:27] to preach. And he had him a few sermons
[1:14:29] to try to preach. He went out one day
[1:14:31] out of his office to pray. Went out in
[1:14:33] the woods. They got down behind an old
[1:14:35] blowing down tree where you go every
[1:14:36] afternoon. Very religious.
[1:14:39] But he didn't believe in that. There's
[1:14:40] two women in the church kept saying,
[1:14:42] "Mr. Finny, we're praying that you
[1:14:44] receive the Holy Ghost."
[1:14:46] He said, "I got the Holy Ghost." But I'm
[1:14:49] a preacher.
[1:14:51] Said, "Mr. Finn, you're a great man and
[1:14:53] you got a great hold of the word, but
[1:14:56] you need the Holy Ghost. We're praying
[1:14:57] for you.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Sweet little women. So he went on. So
[1:15:02] every day he'd go out behind his office,
[1:15:06] his boss and all of them there. He
[1:15:08] worked and he'd go out of his law office
[1:15:09] and go out there to pray. And one day he
[1:15:12] was out there praying and he heard a
[1:15:14] brush break. He thought his boss was
[1:15:16] coming up haunting him. He jumped up
[1:15:19] real quick and saying, "Lord God, I obly
[1:15:20] did saw brush broke. It got raised up
[1:15:23] and said looked around, see where it
[1:15:26] was, broke the brush, and it was then he
[1:15:28] come in the presence of God."
[1:15:31] He realized that brush broke for a
[1:15:33] purpose. He stood there, the tears
[1:15:36] running down his cheeks.
[1:15:38] He said, "Maybe them women's right.
[1:15:41] I'm ashamed for somebody to see me
[1:15:43] talking to my God, but I think it was an
[1:15:45] honor for somebody to see me talking to
[1:15:47] my boss. How much greater is my Lord
[1:15:49] than my boss?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, forgive me and fill me with
[1:15:53] the Holy Ghost."
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Started screaming and shouting. He's in
[1:15:57] the presence of God. He run downtown
[1:15:59] real quick to his office. He got to
[1:16:01] screaming so hard he had to go behind
[1:16:02] the door, said, "Lord, I'll bring
[1:16:04] disgrace up. Oh, he hide me back here.
[1:16:06] Go get over this spell."
[1:16:09] Why? He'd come in the presence of God.
[1:16:11] He was a changed man.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; The sermons that he used to preach, he
[1:16:16] preached them same sermons and souls
[1:16:17] came to the altar.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; See, he had been the presence of God.
[1:16:21] Moody, a little old shoe cobbler. Hardly
[1:16:24] not his ABCs.
[1:16:26] That's right.
[1:16:28] His grammar was poor. Somebody told him
[1:16:31] one day, "Your grammar's awful poor, Mr.
[1:16:32] Moody." He said, "But I'm winning souls
[1:16:34] with it."
[1:16:35] So
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; one day in the newspapers a editor went
[1:16:39] to writing a newspaper. He went over to
[1:16:41] see how could this man hold crowds of
[1:16:43] people under any conditions. Little old
[1:16:46] guy bald-headed and everything and had
[1:16:48] whiskers hanging way down kind of
[1:16:50] potbellied. He was a horrible looking
[1:16:52] man to look at. So this newspaper really
[1:16:55] give him a ride up. Said I don't see
[1:16:57] what in the world that anyone would see
[1:16:59] in Dwight Moody. Said he's ugly. His
[1:17:03] voice is squeaky. He's got whiskers
[1:17:06] plumbed down to his waistline. He's as
[1:17:08] baldheaded as a pumpkin and said, "How
[1:17:10] in the world would anybody ever go to
[1:17:12] see anything in Moody?" So Moody's
[1:17:14] manager had to see it and said, "Look,
[1:17:15] Mr. Moody, I'll read this to you." Moody
[1:17:17] couldn't read it himself. So I said,
[1:17:19] "I'll read you the editorial." And he
[1:17:20] wrote it. Moody just shoved his shoulder
[1:17:22] said, "Certainly not to come to see
[1:17:23] Christ."
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Why? He had been in the presence of God
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; from making souls on shoes for people to
[1:17:33] wear out. He shot the people with a
[1:17:35] gospel of preparation for
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; why? He was in the presence of God,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; A little woman one time come in the
[1:17:43] presence of God. As guilty as she could
[1:17:46] be at a moment when she realized that
[1:17:49] she was in the presence of God, every
[1:17:51] sin was forgiven and she was as pure and
[1:17:54] white as a lily. Oh my. How many more I
[1:17:57] could call off here of people time
[1:17:59] wouldn't permit. But I want to talk a
[1:18:01] little bit about myself.
[1:18:04] What could have been any lower in me?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Where was I? Come out of a family of
[1:18:11] drunkards. Come out of a family of
[1:18:14] murderers. Come out of a family of
[1:18:16] bootleggers. And you know that. Every
[1:18:18] one of you know it. You know what kind
[1:18:20] of name we had here? People didn't speak
[1:18:22] to us on the street. I go downtown,
[1:18:25] start to talk to somebody. Nobody talked
[1:18:26] to me unless somebody wasn't around to
[1:18:29] talk to me. Somebody else come up to
[1:18:30] lead me and I'd stand there and cry.
[1:18:33] Lord, this ain't so. It can't be. So,
[1:18:35] this is wrong. But one day, I come into
[1:18:37] the presence of God.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; he changed me. Made me another kind of
[1:18:43] son.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; His grace brought me into his presence.
[1:18:50] I've never wanted to leave it. I've been
[1:18:52] in here now 30 some odd years. I don't
[1:18:55] want to leave it. I've got the assurance
[1:18:58] that I'll always be there. Even death
[1:19:00] itself will never separate me from his
[1:19:02] presence.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; No, I'll be with him forever.
[1:19:06] When I seen his presence the first time,
[1:19:08] I cried like Isaiah, "Woe is me." Then
[1:19:11] he touched me with his grace.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I was a changed person.
[1:19:17] the little renegade
[1:19:19] that used to get out here and carry on
[1:19:20] and everything was changed. And since
[1:19:23] then, I've been his child. Since then,
[1:19:25] I've desired to give my whole life for
[1:19:27] his service. Only wish I had 10,000 more
[1:19:30] lives to give for him. This is getting
[1:19:33] pretty well wore out now. 53 years has
[1:19:36] passed. About 33 of those has been 32 of
[1:19:39] those has been in the gospel. I wish I
[1:19:41] had another thousand
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; back in span. Why? When I once into his
[1:19:45] presence and realized that there was
[1:19:47] somebody who loved the unlovable,
[1:19:49] there's somebody who loved me when no
[1:19:50] one else did. There was somebody who
[1:19:52] cared for me when no one else cared. I
[1:19:55] put my arms around his cross. I embraced
[1:19:58] it to me and made him become one man.
[1:20:00] And from then on, I've loved him. He
[1:20:02] stained my bosom and my heart with his
[1:20:04] blood. I've touched him and forgiven my
[1:20:06] sins. And I'm happy tonight to be one of
[1:20:08] his. I never desire to leave this
[1:20:11] heavenly place. Though tempter to
[1:20:13] persuade me off have tried,
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; but I'm safe in God's pavilion and happy
[1:20:17] in his loving grace. And I'm living on
[1:20:20] the hallelujah side.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; It makes my heart rejoice. I'm
[1:20:26] recommending him to ever wear person.
[1:20:28] I'm recommending him to you that have no
[1:20:30] hope. You never been in his presence.
[1:20:33] The only thing you have to do is confess
[1:20:34] your sins and realize that you're wrong.
[1:20:37] And God has that angel ordained tonight
[1:20:39] called the Holy Ghost. That'll take all
[1:20:41] your sins away. Then you'll cry, "Lord,
[1:20:44] here am I. Send me." Then you'll raise
[1:20:47] your hands and sing, I will praise him.
[1:20:49] I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for
[1:20:52] sinners slain. Give him glory all ye
[1:20:55] people for his blood has washed away
[1:20:58] each stain.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I love you. Don't you?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Living in his presence. I come to the
[1:21:03] pull pit here this morning feeling so
[1:21:05] bad and so sick from uh I was down in
[1:21:08] Kentucky last week with some personal
[1:21:10] friends of mine sitting here. If I
[1:21:12] stayed down there very long they'd kill
[1:21:14] me. They sure would with kindness.
[1:21:18] Some of the best cooks I ever know in my
[1:21:20] life and when I get to my capacities
[1:21:22] done overloaded. Brother Brandon, won't
[1:21:25] you ask some of this? It's just so good
[1:21:26] I just try to poke it down.
[1:21:29] I got so full I just couldn't even move.
[1:21:31] I couldn't sleep. I had to get out and
[1:21:33] walk around a while. And um I wasn't
[1:21:36] feeling very good when I got in here
[1:21:37] this morning. But once when I come into
[1:21:39] his presence,
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; that sounded that settled it. It all
[1:21:43] vanished away. That's right. Oh, to live
[1:21:46] in his presence, I will praise him.
[1:21:51] I
[1:21:53] will praise him.
[1:21:56] Praise
[1:21:58] the lamb for sinner sl.
[1:22:05] Give
[1:22:07] him glory
[1:22:09] all ye people
[1:22:14] for his blood has washed away
[1:22:20] each.
[1:22:23] Let's bow our heads now.
[1:22:32] Did you enjoy that?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; You know
[1:22:39] the a real believer
[1:22:41] always
[1:22:43] looks into the year thundum which is the
[1:22:46] word of God. And from when we have the
[1:22:51] opportunity to
[1:22:54] listen to a tape like this tape, it
[1:22:58] becomes a measuring
[1:23:00] marker for us.
[1:23:02] You're able to ask yourself, is this
[1:23:05] where my heart's at? Is this where my
[1:23:08] life's at? Is this how I feel?
[1:23:12] Is this how I think? And and if you
[1:23:19] feel that
[1:23:21] then you you know that this is real for
[1:23:25] you
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and it's obtainable
[1:23:29] for you. The word of God never comes to
[1:23:32] condemn
[1:23:34] but to correct. Correct doesn't mean to
[1:23:38] punish. It means to change course.
[1:23:41] You know, like you drive on your car,
[1:23:44] you know where you're going and you do a
[1:23:47] certain thing and that thing starts
[1:23:49] saying, "Make a U-turn. Make a U-turn."
[1:23:52] And you start say, "I know where I'm
[1:23:53] going." You know, and because it wants
[1:23:57] to keep correcting you, you know, and
[1:24:01] that's what the Lord knows. He knows
[1:24:03] where we're going and he knows what's
[1:24:06] before us. So, he always wants to
[1:24:08] correct our path. He wants to remind us
[1:24:11] and bring us into remembrance. You know,
[1:24:14] always put the Lord before you. And when
[1:24:18] you do that, it's wonderful. I like the
[1:24:21] part, I really always like the part
[1:24:23] about the saved sinner. But he said, "A
[1:24:25] sinner, a repented sinner doesn't have
[1:24:28] to worry. It's been settled."
[1:24:32] and and those those are the attitudes
[1:24:34] and the wisdom and what he is bringing
[1:24:38] to us and and and young people to to
[1:24:43] know that you can come to that place
[1:24:44] where you've been in the present. It's
[1:24:47] settled. You don't have to worry about
[1:24:49] it. You don't have to be afraid the
[1:24:52] preacher is going to come up and preach
[1:24:54] some message that's going to make you
[1:24:57] feel like you're unsaved.
[1:24:59] You know, you I went through that a few
[1:25:02] times where some preachers got on me and
[1:25:04] tried to just make me feel like I wasn't
[1:25:07] saved. I went back to my room and I got
[1:25:09] down and I said, "Lord, you know it."
[1:25:11] And when I got back up, they never could
[1:25:13] do that to me again.
[1:25:16] Because I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I know it is who saved me.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, I would don't have to
[1:25:23] come under the subjection of man and
[1:25:26] what they think I ought to do. I know
[1:25:28] for myself that he's real
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; and he's alive and and and I I I I know
[1:25:36] that it was very evident and I'm hope
[1:25:38] and trust that you all picked up on it,
[1:25:41] but if you've ever been in the presence
[1:25:43] of God, you're obligated
[1:25:46] to tell somebody.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and it's more than like an
[1:25:51] obligation. You better tell somebody.
[1:25:54] No, that fire is burning in your heart.
[1:25:57] You just got to let somebody know what
[1:26:00] God can do for them. You just don't like
[1:26:02] the devil no more. You know, I mean,
[1:26:04] when you see the devil on somebody, you
[1:26:06] just want to say, "Wait a minute. You
[1:26:08] don't have to live like that."
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, you don't have to
[1:26:11] suffer like that. And and you'll stick
[1:26:14] right there. You'll never give up on
[1:26:16] anybody. No matter how long it takes,
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; you won't give up because you know God
[1:26:21] never gave up on you. And so we just
[1:26:25] hope you enjoyed the word of God and uh
[1:26:28] encouraged you and and so would you pray
[1:26:31] for this weekend? Uh I I know that we
[1:26:35] have about 150
[1:26:38] uh young people coming to the banquet
[1:26:41] and probably more wanting to come and
[1:26:44] and um you know everybody wants to cut
[1:26:48] it off at this and cut it off with that.
[1:26:51] But I heard a song one time that there's
[1:26:53] room at the altar.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we have to sit them in the
[1:26:58] pavilion, if we have to sit them in the
[1:27:01] Sunday school classrooms, we want
[1:27:04] everybody to come to hear the word of
[1:27:07] God. We don't we don't care about how
[1:27:10] our decorations or our food. Our food's
[1:27:13] the gospel.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not
[1:27:17] uh you know stuffed meatloaf or chicken
[1:27:22] cordon blue or pork chops with mushroom
[1:27:26] gravy. It ain't that. It's Jesus Christ
[1:27:30] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:27:32] So we just richly ask you the Lord to
[1:27:35] bless you. So, let's stand this evening
[1:27:37] and
[1:27:39] um
[1:27:44] as they play something on the piano for
[1:27:47] us this evening, why don't we just take
[1:27:50] a moment and
[1:27:54] bow our hearts and our
[1:27:58] minds before the Lord. And
[1:28:02] and maybe like Charles
[1:28:06] Finny
[1:28:08] came to that great place where he said,
[1:28:10] "Am I ashamed
[1:28:12] of the Lord?
[1:28:14] Am I ashamed of what God's done for me?
[1:28:18] I'm ashamed to show people that I've
[1:28:21] been in his presence. And
[1:28:25] maybe you could just ask in your heart
[1:28:27] if if there's
[1:28:30] maybe that you need a little change in
[1:28:33] your life
[1:28:35] and see what the Lord might come by and
[1:28:39] encourage your heart
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:59] Our gracious father,
[1:29:05] Lord, how many opportunities have I let
[1:29:08] past
[1:29:10] where I could have stood for you
[1:29:14] or I could have told somebody about you.
[1:29:22] Lord, how many times have I run from
[1:29:25] your presence and
[1:29:28] instead of running into your presence
[1:29:30] and letting it change me?
[1:29:34] Father, how many times have I let my sin
[1:29:37] and shame
[1:29:41] keep me from allowing you to
[1:29:45] make me better and different?
[1:29:50] Lord, tonight we heard your messenger
[1:29:52] speak of the power of the presence of
[1:29:56] God and what it does. What it does to a
[1:30:00] man's heart, what it does to his life,
[1:30:02] what it does to his desires,
[1:30:06] what becomes important in his life,
[1:30:11] and how that he never wants to leave
[1:30:13] that place.
[1:30:17] Lord, I'm ashamed of how many times I've
[1:30:19] left your presence.
[1:30:22] And I ask you to forgive me, Father.
[1:30:27] And once again, make a way back for me
[1:30:30] through the blood of the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:36] That that presence, Father,
[1:30:40] could be a burning light.
[1:30:44] He talked about the light bulb and the
[1:30:46] electricity coming together. Father
[1:30:48] light and light he says shines bright.
[1:30:59] Lord, as we even heard in the quotations
[1:31:02] from Wednesday night that
[1:31:06] to go into the dark places and let your
[1:31:09] light so shine amongst men.
[1:31:15] Father, it's not about us. It's about
[1:31:17] you and
[1:31:21] and you using us to get you your life to
[1:31:26] the lost.
[1:31:29] And when they came into the presence,
[1:31:31] father and the coal at the altar touched
[1:31:34] their lips. Our messenger said that a
[1:31:37] man in the presence of God says, "Lord,
[1:31:39] send me.
[1:31:41] What can I do to serve you?" And father,
[1:31:44] may we each ask that question.
[1:31:50] May we not let the shame of our sin keep
[1:31:52] us from doing your work.
[1:31:57] But may we confess our sins because
[1:31:59] you're faithful and just to forgive
[1:32:01] them, Father.
[1:32:05] And may we leave those things which are
[1:32:07] behind behind.
[1:32:10] And may we press for a higher calling.
[1:32:14] Father, those that have come out
[1:32:16] tonight, Father, I ask that you would
[1:32:19] bless their lives in a special way.
[1:32:25] Lord, I know it's hard nowadays for
[1:32:27] people to go to church.
[1:32:32] There's a time revival would last weeks
[1:32:35] at a time.
[1:32:38] But we live in a cold, formal,
[1:32:42] worldly atmosphere.
[1:32:46] And it takes a lot more prayer and a lot
[1:32:49] more courage
[1:32:52] to press the mark.
[1:32:55] Lord, we need a lot more time in your
[1:32:58] presence to gain strength and to wait
[1:33:01] upon you, Father.
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:06] Lord, I pray tonight and I believe,
[1:33:09] Father, with all my heart, I
[1:33:12] that I did the right thing in playing
[1:33:14] this today.
[1:33:16] And Lord, I ask that the effect of your
[1:33:20] presence would be manifested in the
[1:33:22] lives of the hearer.
[1:33:25] [Music]
[1:33:26] You spoke of the joy that comes to the
[1:33:29] believer once he's free
[1:33:33] from all his burden of sin.
[1:33:38] Lord, I pray that if there's any here
[1:33:40] amongst us has never been free, that has
[1:33:44] never felt the lifting of the burden of
[1:33:49] conscience.
[1:33:51] Lord, I pray that your loving hand would
[1:33:54] swing by and touch their hearts
[1:33:58] tonight or in the days to come that they
[1:34:00] might know
[1:34:02] that they're free
[1:34:06] and that they have an eternal
[1:34:07] destination
[1:34:10] and that there's a mansion waiting for
[1:34:13] them just on the other side of the
[1:34:14] hilltop.
[1:34:18] Oh, God, there's nothing like it.
[1:34:21] There's nothing that a man knows.
[1:34:24] There's nothing like you, Lord Jesus.
[1:34:29] Nothing like knowing that
[1:34:33] nothing can pluck us out of the palm of
[1:34:37] your hand.
[1:34:39] That if you started a work, you would
[1:34:40] finish it. Father, forgive me for my
[1:34:42] weaknesses.
[1:34:45] Strengthen me with your grace and mercy.
[1:34:48] Father, if there's a hand up this
[1:34:50] evening,
[1:34:52] if there's a heart that's turned towards
[1:34:54] you,
[1:34:56] if there's one that's found themselves
[1:34:59] wanting,
[1:35:01] being weighed in the balance, Father,
[1:35:03] may you just sweep your spirit by their
[1:35:06] heart.
[1:35:08] May you let them know that that you love
[1:35:10] them
[1:35:13] and that if you if they'll follow,
[1:35:15] you'll lead them.
[1:35:17] We ask that you would grant these things
[1:35:19] to us tonight in Jesus precious and
[1:35:23] wonderful name we pray. What What song

[1:40:38] behind
[1:40:40] and press for a higher calling. We ask
