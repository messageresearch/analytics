[51:25] is that good to have a song leader that
[51:27] can just
[51:28] oh bring us into the presence of god we
[51:32] come in from this wicked world and just
[51:35] let off the pressure
[51:36] does anybody know what i'm talking about
[51:39] are you all appreciating that you can
[51:41] come to church
[51:43] mama in uganda today
[51:48] they're in um their fifth week of
[51:50] lockdown
[51:51] again six weeks of just total lockdown
[51:54] not able to come out of their homes
[51:57] only for without permission not able to
[51:59] have church today
[52:02] uh in other places there's been other
[52:05] waves and waves of this
[52:07] we just ought to be thankful i i was
[52:10] glad
[52:12] when they said unto me let us go
[52:15] into the house of the lord
[52:18] you know it was so wonderful to be alone
[52:21] this morning
[52:22] in the house where i was staying and go
[52:25] into a room
[52:26] and shut the door and kneel down and
[52:29] pray
[52:30] alone but it was better
[52:34] to come into the house of the lord and
[52:37] be with the body of christ
[52:39] does anybody know what i'm talking about
[52:41] like you can be all alone
[52:43] you can have god in your personal life
[52:47] and that's the main thing but it's
[52:50] different
[52:51] when you come to church and be with
[52:53] other brothers and sisters
[52:56] does anybody know what i'm talking about
[52:58] and you hear the word and you hear the
[53:00] songs and you just something wells up
[53:02] within you
[53:03] that's what heaven is going to be like
[53:07] so heaven is visiting us today today
[53:10] we're going to speak from our hearts
[53:12] brother david mcgary
[53:14] and sister leslie and their family all
[53:17] of their family
[53:18] has opened up their hearts to us over
[53:20] the years to
[53:22] allow us to have our liberty so i'm
[53:24] going to take my liberty
[53:26] and i'm going to speak with the lord
[53:28] laid on our hearts to say
[53:30] and that is the heart of the matters
[53:33] the heart of the matters that's our
[53:35] title the heart of the matters because
[53:38] you know we could talk a lot about
[53:40] everything else that's going
[53:42] on in your life and house the prices and
[53:45] how's this and your school and the
[53:47] summer
[53:49] could talk about all of that but we
[53:51] really
[53:52] want to touch on the heart of the
[53:54] matters
[53:55] and you know i think you've noticed this
[53:59] life isn't easy no more it seemed to be
[54:02] brother jackson like it's not just one
[54:04] thing or two things
[54:05] three things it's like there's matters
[54:08] there's issues
[54:10] is that true it just seems like life
[54:12] isn't simple anymore
[54:14] it's like multifaceted and if we're not
[54:16] careful as believers
[54:18] we can get strung out on this and that
[54:21] and this and answering
[54:23] and today i just really want to come to
[54:25] the heart of the matters
[54:26] and let the lord jesus touch that is
[54:29] that okay so
[54:30] let's not have an ordinary church
[54:31] service this morning
[54:33] let's let the lord jesus just touch that
[54:35] place do you know what still
[54:37] the number one killer of human beings is
[54:41] heart disease
[54:42] i just googled it in the back room
[54:46] but i have my opening quote is a prophet
[54:48] telling us
[54:50] because back then the number one killer
[54:53] physically was heart disease
[54:57] but spiritually it's sin disease
[55:03] so naturally it's a heart issue
[55:06] and spiritually it's a heart issue all
[55:09] the symptoms and all the things that a
[55:12] person might
[55:13] be uh reflecting is coming from the
[55:16] heart
[55:17] so let's just all drop down all of our
[55:19] facade
[55:21] and let him deal with the heart thank
[55:23] you let's stand today and we'll turn to
[55:26] our
[55:26] scripture that is in psalms
[55:29] 48 and then proverbs thank you musicians
[55:35] so wonderful to have musicians that
[55:44] psalms chapter 48 is our scripture
[55:56] who knows what these things are
[56:00] what are what is this binoculars
[56:04] we're going to have a demonstration in a
[56:06] few minutes about binoculars
[56:09] and focusing in you can be looking at
[56:13] something and it's all fuzzy
[56:14] different you know but then the lord
[56:16] just focuses it in you can see it
[56:18] clearly
[56:20] so in just a few minutes we're going to
[56:21] speak about that psalms 48
[56:27] if you notice in your bible it might say
[56:30] a psalm
[56:31] and song and psalm for the sons of korah
[56:35] some of your bibles might say that and
[56:38] in cora's day they came against the
[56:40] prophet and came against
[56:42] the word for their day and the earth
[56:44] swallowed up
[56:45] a a bunch of people but the bible says
[56:48] the sons of korah died not
[56:51] there were actually sons of korah that
[56:53] did not stand with their father
[56:56] even though it was in their family
[56:59] they stood back and said i'll stand with
[57:01] the word and
[57:03] for years after that the sons of korah
[57:06] were actually leaders in the church
[57:08] in the message and it was like a sign
[57:13] to the other believers that you don't
[57:14] have to bend and bow
[57:16] to pressure that's right around you
[57:19] even in your family or job or church you
[57:22] can stand for the word
[57:24] so i'm not going to preach about that
[57:26] but i thought it was just kind of
[57:28] interesting
[57:29] that this is a song for the sons of
[57:31] korah
[57:32] the bible says great is the lord and
[57:35] greatly to be praised in the city of our
[57:38] god
[57:39] and the mountain of his holiness
[57:42] the bible says he's beautiful for
[57:45] situation
[57:47] the joy of the whole earth is mount zion
[57:51] on the sides of the north the city
[57:55] of the great king god is known
[57:58] in her palaces for a refuge
[58:02] we didn't have our psalm reading this
[58:03] morning so let's the congregation
[58:06] all of us read together verse one
[58:08] through three that we just read
[58:10] out loud great is the lord and
[58:13] greatly to be praised in the city of our
[58:16] god
[58:17] in the mountain of his holiness
[58:20] beautiful
[58:20] for situation the joy of the whole earth
[58:24] is mount zion on the sides of the north
[58:27] the city of the great king god is known
[58:31] in her palaces somebody say praise the
[58:34] lord
[58:36] now verse 2 we're talking about the
[58:39] heart of the matter
[58:42] he's beautiful for situation
[58:45] what about your situation
[58:49] is he beautiful is he precious
[58:53] there's prayer requests that we could
[58:55] have read today there's needs around the
[58:57] world
[58:57] people or maybe even believers that are
[59:01] struggling for life precious in the
[59:04] sight of the lord as the passing of a
[59:06] saint
[59:07] so let your life be precious while
[59:10] you're living so that when you go
[59:12] it can be precious i'm being real today
[59:16] it's not some magic wand that's waved
[59:18] over your casket
[59:20] and a preacher puts you in heaven don't
[59:22] do that to us
[59:24] live your life so there's enough
[59:26] evidence
[59:28] that your life puts you there precious
[59:32] in the sight of the lord is the death of
[59:34] his saints
[59:35] but look in verse 2 beautiful for a
[59:38] situation
[59:42] make him beautiful today in your
[59:43] situation in verse 3
[59:46] god is known in her palaces for a refuge
[59:52] so let us run into that today uh
[59:55] proverbs chapter 4 verse 23
[59:58] is our last verse just one more verse if
[1:00:00] you don't mind
[1:00:03] we love the bible don't we it's god's
[1:00:06] binoculars

[1:00:30] for what you have need of how many
[1:00:32] believe that

[1:01:52] congregation i just sense the presence
[1:01:54] of the lord here in this place
[1:01:56] isn't that wonderful
[1:02:00] so today as a we ministered friday night
[1:02:03] in seattle we were in denver
[1:02:05] colorado last week with brother fosten
[1:02:07] and
[1:02:09] and friday night in seattle preaching
[1:02:13] for the church there
[1:02:16] and the ministry and the church sends
[1:02:18] their greetings to you and flew
[1:02:20] overnight
[1:02:21] so that we would be here saturday to
[1:02:23] prepare for this morning service
[1:02:25] christian life tabernacle
[1:02:29] the heart of the matters
[1:02:33] as i came into my room um
[1:02:38] it was early saturday morning because we
[1:02:40] flew all night brother david picked us
[1:02:42] up
[1:02:42] early and then these thoughts came into
[1:02:45] my heart
[1:02:46] and i began to write them down on the
[1:02:48] heart of the matters and the heart
[1:02:50] matters
[1:02:50] and the matters of the heart and heart
[1:02:53] issues
[1:02:53] we had already prepared things to say
[1:02:57] but
[1:02:57] just really our title and the thought
[1:03:00] today comes from
[1:03:01] the inspiration of things that come from
[1:03:03] the heart and going to the heart
[1:03:05] of the matter what it really means
[1:03:07] because
[1:03:09] as we read in psalms and proverbs
[1:03:12] you can put that up again brother
[1:03:14] david's proverbs 4
[1:03:16] 23 to keep thy heart with all diligence
[1:03:20] the heart is the center it's the main
[1:03:22] thing it's the middle
[1:03:24] of everything in your heart if your
[1:03:26] heart stops beating
[1:03:29] and then blood stops flowing through
[1:03:31] your heart and then your brain stops
[1:03:33] functioning
[1:03:34] you're gonna die we can say that
[1:03:37] naturally and
[1:03:39] we might even kind of say well it goes
[1:03:41] without saying
[1:03:42] if someone's heart stops and their brain
[1:03:44] starts functioning
[1:03:45] they're going to die is that true
[1:03:48] if that's true in the natural then
[1:03:51] that's
[1:03:52] probably the main thing spiritually why
[1:03:54] people today are spiritually
[1:03:56] having so much trouble it's heart
[1:03:58] trouble
[1:04:00] and if the number one natural thing
[1:04:03] in the world that is the killer of
[1:04:06] humans you can just google that
[1:04:07] this afternoon not right now but this
[1:04:09] afternoon
[1:04:11] it's still the number one killer is
[1:04:14] heart
[1:04:14] disease and if it's speaking of
[1:04:17] something spiritually because the
[1:04:19] natural types the spiritual
[1:04:21] then there it must really be a heart
[1:04:23] issue then
[1:04:26] so we can talk about a lot on the
[1:04:28] outside but really it's the heart
[1:04:30] of the matter it's the inside it's
[1:04:33] really
[1:04:34] it's more than just an organ that's
[1:04:36] inside of us that circulates
[1:04:38] blood and is kind of you would say it's
[1:04:41] the seat
[1:04:42] of physical life you'd say it's the
[1:04:44] center of
[1:04:46] physical life but i'm thinking more
[1:04:48] spiritually today of the heart
[1:04:50] of the matters because from the heart
[1:04:52] comes your vigor comes your strength
[1:04:55] it's the s it's the center part it
[1:04:58] it goes to the soul it goes really the
[1:05:01] believer that has the mind of christ
[1:05:03] it's the really the heart of our lives
[1:05:05] is
[1:05:06] not what you think what i think it's
[1:05:09] having the mind of christ
[1:05:12] not up here but the mind of christ or
[1:05:16] his will
[1:05:17] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:05:19] it comes from the heart
[1:05:22] the heart is the fountain it's the seat
[1:05:25] of your thoughts of your passions
[1:05:29] your desires your appetites what's
[1:05:32] driving you
[1:05:33] as an individual it is your affections
[1:05:37] and purpose in life
[1:05:39] it is what you're endeavoring to achieve
[1:05:41] out of
[1:05:42] from the heart of the matter should come
[1:05:45] our motives
[1:05:46] and our objectives it's your
[1:05:48] understanding it's the facility
[1:05:51] and the very seat of your whole life
[1:05:54] and from there comes your will we have a
[1:05:58] lot of strong-willed
[1:05:59] people today in america especially
[1:06:02] there's a lot of outspoken
[1:06:04] and out there and it is everything's out
[1:06:06] there you know
[1:06:07] that's more of a curse than a blessing
[1:06:12] america is not heaven
[1:06:17] it's a land that is falling apart
[1:06:20] i know there's many from africa around
[1:06:23] the world that want to move to america
[1:06:26] and they find out when they move here
[1:06:28] it's not uh the promised land
[1:06:32] there's nowhere on this globe of earth
[1:06:36] without christ that's going to make you
[1:06:39] happy
[1:06:41] you might be in church today or
[1:06:43] streaming or
[1:06:44] wish you were on a beat somewhere or
[1:06:46] wish you had a few million dollars well
[1:06:49] we found out in the last few weeks you
[1:06:51] can just talk to bill and
[1:06:53] you know mrs m gates or you know talk to
[1:06:57] bozo bezo i think they said that last
[1:06:59] time
[1:07:00] and their wives and husbands it's not
[1:07:03] having billions of dollars that makes
[1:07:05] you happy
[1:07:06] then why are you striving for that
[1:07:10] houses on the lake and i'm from seattle
[1:07:13] i know exactly
[1:07:14] where bill gates and his wife
[1:07:17] well one of their houses is in the
[1:07:19] elevator that goes down to lake
[1:07:20] washington and it's just millions of
[1:07:22] dollars that's not going to make
[1:07:24] the wife happy
[1:07:28] it's the heart there's heart issues
[1:07:30] going on we're finding out
[1:07:32] you can fly to the moon you can fly to
[1:07:35] outer space
[1:07:36] and spend you know 10 and a half minutes
[1:07:39] or 11 minutes and come back and woohoo
[1:07:44] but when the thrill's all over and the
[1:07:46] champagne is dried off of your
[1:07:48] astronaut suit you got to lay your head
[1:07:50] down on the pillow
[1:07:52] if you don't have jesus you're lost
[1:07:57] and we can look in the world and kind of
[1:07:59] chuckle at that but what about among
[1:08:01] us today most of god's people are poor
[1:08:05] people
[1:08:06] so why are we striving for things that
[1:08:10] aren't even real
[1:08:12] and even people's health we found out
[1:08:14] through this pandemic people are
[1:08:16] so concerned about their health and
[1:08:18] whether they mask or whether you're
[1:08:20] vaccinated or whether you distance or
[1:08:22] whatever
[1:08:24] they're trying to keep their life and
[1:08:26] their heart and their
[1:08:28] health as the main thing
[1:08:31] but friends for the believer whether we
[1:08:33] live or whether we go
[1:08:35] if you've given your heart to christ it
[1:08:37] takes away that fear and that drive
[1:08:39] and that anxiety and that pressure and
[1:08:43] who are you trying to be anyway
[1:08:46] if the lord's done with us then i want
[1:08:49] to go
[1:08:52] if he's not done with us it could be a
[1:08:54] freight train barreling down the track
[1:08:56] and
[1:08:56] satan tried to tie you up and throw you
[1:08:58] on the track for a joke
[1:09:00] and to take you early well at the last
[1:09:03] second
[1:09:04] there could be a little ant just flick
[1:09:06] its head and flick me off the track
[1:09:12] we can talk about a lot of things i'm
[1:09:13] just speaking a little bit to get our
[1:09:15] hearts all lined up
[1:09:16] but our heart is the main thing it's
[1:09:19] where all your emotions
[1:09:20] and the affections and your passion in
[1:09:22] your life it's the middle of everything
[1:09:24] and psalms 48 verse 2 we can put that up
[1:09:28] again brother david the bible says
[1:09:30] he's beautiful for situation and i want
[1:09:33] to say today for each one of you
[1:09:35] god is beautiful for your situation
[1:09:40] god is beautiful for any matters any
[1:09:44] issue of life
[1:09:47] and that's why i want to speak on this
[1:09:49] heart of the matters because god
[1:09:51] is beautiful for your issue for your
[1:09:54] matter
[1:09:54] now proverbs 4 23 that we read
[1:09:58] and we can put that also on the screen
[1:10:00] to keep thy heart with all
[1:10:02] diligence that means to guard your heart
[1:10:06] observe and take heed take charge of
[1:10:09] your heart
[1:10:11] don't let it just run wild and get
[1:10:13] caught up with your
[1:10:15] with social media and media and your
[1:10:18] cell phone
[1:10:18] and you look at that so much or you look
[1:10:21] at your device or
[1:10:22] you look at your bank account and it
[1:10:24] really moves your emotions
[1:10:27] it it causes you to start thinking a
[1:10:29] certain way you're so focused in
[1:10:31] and you're watching and you're able to
[1:10:33] just get animated and your emotions
[1:10:36] are moved by a device or what you see on
[1:10:38] that device
[1:10:40] if that's true in the natural what about
[1:10:42] the spiritual
[1:10:43] that god can move our hearts toward him
[1:10:46] toward eternal things
[1:10:49] toward the things of god i think that's
[1:10:52] why we have church on a sunday morning
[1:10:55] is to set our hearts right keep
[1:10:58] thy heart with all diligence that means
[1:11:01] watch over it
[1:11:02] protect it be like a watchman
[1:11:06] wait for your heart treasure up your the
[1:11:10] memories of your life
[1:11:13] keep it within the bounds of the word we
[1:11:16] want to be blessed of god
[1:11:18] we want god's blessing we'll keep your
[1:11:20] heart in the bounds
[1:11:21] of his word let not your heart be
[1:11:25] troubled jesus said can you bring that
[1:11:28] up
[1:11:28] brother david i think it's john what
[1:11:31] scripture is that somebody help us out
[1:11:33] very first verse of that chapter let not
[1:11:35] your hearts be troubled
[1:11:38] john 14 you think i think too
[1:11:42] is it john 14 verse 1 let not your heart
[1:11:45] be troubled you believe in god believe
[1:11:49] also
[1:11:49] in me he didn't say let not your mind or
[1:11:52] your spirit because
[1:11:54] god knows that if our heart is connected
[1:11:57] to the right thing
[1:11:58] our spirit will be calm or we'll be uh
[1:12:01] would be able to even though we're
[1:12:04] multitasking we're focused in
[1:12:06] she's the main thing and out from him
[1:12:09] flows everything out of our lives
[1:12:12] it's not our will be done it's his will
[1:12:14] be done
[1:12:17] oh god bring us to that place today
[1:12:19] y'all are listening so well
[1:12:22] keep my heart with diligence means that
[1:12:25] i'm going to
[1:12:26] pay heed and i'm going to beware
[1:12:29] because satan is on an all-out attack
[1:12:32] to take your heart to destroy the center
[1:12:36] of your life
[1:12:38] he rapes he abuses he comes right in and
[1:12:41] smashes in we see a world that's
[1:12:44] intoxicated
[1:12:45] this morning they are intoxicated with a
[1:12:48] demonology what
[1:12:50] satan's broadcasting by his world wide
[1:12:53] web
[1:12:54] why is it this generation that has
[1:12:56] become so worldwide and we become a
[1:12:58] global village and we can know what's
[1:13:00] going on in in congo
[1:13:02] or in china or in japan a person could
[1:13:05] be watching
[1:13:06] the olympics today right here in this
[1:13:09] room
[1:13:10] and there can be voices and colors and
[1:13:12] flags
[1:13:14] and medals going through this room and
[1:13:16] there is right now
[1:13:17] but it just takes a little something and
[1:13:19] brother david could bring it right up on
[1:13:21] the screen for you
[1:13:22] who won a gold medal today who won a
[1:13:24] bronze medal you say oh i didn't know
[1:13:26] that oh my
[1:13:29] because it brought it to your senses
[1:13:32] it's in another place it's it's
[1:13:35] literally
[1:13:35] thousands of miles away but technology
[1:13:38] could bring it into this room right now
[1:13:40] and make it so real some of you would be
[1:13:42] happy
[1:13:43] some of you say ah
[1:13:46] and if that's true in the natural what
[1:13:48] about the spiritual
[1:13:50] god could make his will knowing he could
[1:13:52] project a word he could put something
[1:13:54] maybe on that screen right there you
[1:13:56] could say that is thus saith the lord
[1:13:57] for me
[1:13:58] and i'm grabbing a hold of it god
[1:14:00] reached into that other realm and he
[1:14:02] brought into this realm what i needed to
[1:14:04] hear
[1:14:06] and it touched my heart and it moved me
[1:14:09] it might have been a service that was
[1:14:10] kind of dry
[1:14:11] kind of you didn't really expect much
[1:14:14] but god
[1:14:15] came by that way and turned to heart
[1:14:18] i think he did that for you brother
[1:14:20] jackson one day right it was a service
[1:14:22] you came and
[1:14:23] maybe not a great dynamic movement and
[1:14:25] it wasn't a special meeting i don't
[1:14:27] think but
[1:14:28] god moved upon brother jackson's heart
[1:14:30] god moved it could be for your little
[1:14:32] girl today
[1:14:33] or your little boy they could be for
[1:14:35] years in the presence of god and
[1:14:37] in the atmosphere but one day the lights
[1:14:40] come on
[1:14:43] everything begins to make sense that
[1:14:45] things begin to come in line
[1:14:47] that's the holy ghost oh lord send the
[1:14:50] holy spirit today
[1:14:54] amen minister to us in our heart of the
[1:14:57] matter
[1:14:59] now in 1963 brother brennan mentioned
[1:15:01] this in arkansas
[1:15:02] we've heard many people say that the
[1:15:04] number one killer
[1:15:05] is heart disease he said i differ with
[1:15:07] them not to be different
[1:15:09] i just differ because i know it's wrong
[1:15:12] the number one
[1:15:13] killer is sin disease right
[1:15:16] not all heart disease it's sin disease
[1:15:19] our number one heart disease doesn't he
[1:15:22] said the main thing that kills the
[1:15:24] people today it's number one
[1:15:26] is sin disease sin is unbelief
[1:15:30] unbelief in what the bible yes it's the
[1:15:32] number one
[1:15:33] sin is disease that kills the people
[1:15:36] both spiritually
[1:15:38] and that'll make them kill physically of
[1:15:40] course
[1:15:42] of course he said now this is brother
[1:15:45] branham going real deep down
[1:15:46] into our hearts he says they can already
[1:15:49] prove that
[1:15:50] men that hold grudges
[1:15:53] and women who fuss and stew
[1:15:56] and fight and argue they'll die
[1:16:00] it'll cause cancer fungus
[1:16:04] and everything else will set in and
[1:16:06] ulcers
[1:16:09] did you all know that today you you just
[1:16:11] thought your heart was a
[1:16:12] organ in their pump and brother
[1:16:14] branham's trying to bring it spiritually
[1:16:16] to the heart of the matters
[1:16:17] that people today that hold grudges and
[1:16:20] and people that fuss and stew and fight
[1:16:24] and i hope this isn't your home
[1:16:27] i hope this isn't spiritually after all
[1:16:30] these years as a christian that this is
[1:16:32] what
[1:16:32] that what's been produced i pray that
[1:16:34] there would be a hunger for
[1:16:36] the heart of god that if we're guilty of
[1:16:39] any of these things that's why
[1:16:40] brother john felt led to preach on this
[1:16:45] people that hold grudges and they fuss
[1:16:47] and stew and fight and argue they'll die
[1:16:50] it'll cause cancer and fungus and
[1:16:53] everything else will set in and ulcers
[1:16:58] we were made to be happy god made us to
[1:17:02] be
[1:17:02] happy and free he said you were made to
[1:17:06] live like children before your father
[1:17:08] and know
[1:17:08] that he makes every day everything work
[1:17:12] right for you
[1:17:13] each day praise god
[1:17:16] and that includes june july the 25th
[1:17:20] 2021 today has been made
[1:17:24] god made it for you everything's gonna
[1:17:26] work out right today
[1:17:28] and you started it good by being in the
[1:17:30] presence of god
[1:17:31] friends we might as well start feeling
[1:17:33] comfortable we're going to live like
[1:17:35] this for eternity
[1:17:36] except no more work no more trouble no
[1:17:39] more heartache
[1:17:40] no more grudges and fussing and stewing
[1:17:43] not when you go out into your car
[1:17:45] go home but the whole atmosphere is
[1:17:47] going to be burnt
[1:17:48] off the earth is going to be burnt off
[1:17:52] there's not going to be any of that in
[1:17:53] heaven
[1:17:55] all heart disease is going to be dealt
[1:17:58] with here on earth
[1:17:59] then i say lord purge it out of my life
[1:18:02] purge out the things of my life that's
[1:18:05] not of you lord
[1:18:06] come to the heart of the matters the
[1:18:09] matters
[1:18:11] the matters that i would live my life
[1:18:14] for you
[1:18:15] see there's not three or four or five
[1:18:18] different walks of life
[1:18:19] that you and i can choose to walk in
[1:18:21] today there's only one
[1:18:23] for the believer it's god's perfect will
[1:18:26] that you embrace
[1:18:30] it's what you were ordained to do and
[1:18:33] what god
[1:18:33] called you before the foundation of the
[1:18:35] world that's what a believer is striving
[1:18:38] for
[1:18:38] that's why you feel out of sorts and you
[1:18:40] feel kind of out of
[1:18:42] you know things just aren't is because
[1:18:44] we're living in a body and in a realm
[1:18:47] it's just not right
[1:18:48] but don't bring that over into the
[1:18:50] spiritual and then start having
[1:18:51] questions about the message messenger
[1:18:53] about the bible or about the things of
[1:18:55] god those are the only things that's
[1:18:57] right
[1:18:59] can this church say amen i think this
[1:19:02] church today could use a real good dose
[1:19:04] of the holy ghost i'm including myself
[1:19:08] because this is my morning service a
[1:19:10] real
[1:19:11] good baptism of fire
[1:19:15] not just good times and happy times but
[1:19:18] times that we have matters or we have
[1:19:20] issues of life when god comes to the
[1:19:22] heart and i can really have the word
[1:19:24] strike my heart and my life is never the
[1:19:28] same and i'm
[1:19:29] i'm waiting for that i'm longing for
[1:19:32] that i'm just
[1:19:33] we're hungry and thirsty for something
[1:19:35] that can satisfy us
[1:19:38] hallelujah woman at the well you might
[1:19:41] not have never heard this like this
[1:19:42] before
[1:19:43] but it's god trying to bring you a fresh
[1:19:45] drink of water
[1:19:50] so now it's time for the binoculars
[1:19:53] these things
[1:19:57] you all know what these are right and in
[1:20:01] victory day this is where we got this
[1:20:03] from and i
[1:20:04] i hope that you don't feel brother
[1:20:05] john's too juvenile i said i'll bring
[1:20:07] some binoculars to dallas
[1:20:09] and and have a little demonstration
[1:20:11] maybe somebody will catch it
[1:20:13] is that okay i could read about it we
[1:20:15] can talk about it
[1:20:16] but let's just look at it for a little
[1:20:18] bit
[1:20:19] because god invites men to look
[1:20:23] but he said man wants to show himself
[1:20:25] and man wants to look at what god is
[1:20:27] trying to show him
[1:20:29] on the basis of his own idea when god is
[1:20:31] trying to show
[1:20:32] him something but the man wants to
[1:20:34] accept it upon the way that he looks at
[1:20:37] it
[1:20:38] and he's talking about taking binoculars
[1:20:40] or you might be driving down the road i
[1:20:43] know some of you have been on vacation
[1:20:44] or
[1:20:45] uh you have been on vacation or you want
[1:20:48] to go on vacation or maybe you are on
[1:20:50] vacation
[1:20:51] and um god you say well look look there
[1:20:54] look at here it's somebody trying to
[1:20:56] bring your attention look at that
[1:20:57] mountain
[1:20:58] look at that over there or look at that
[1:21:00] accident oh do you see that there
[1:21:02] we just drove by an accident something
[1:21:04] to strike your attention
[1:21:06] something to trying to get you to look
[1:21:07] away from where you're looking
[1:21:10] and look to something look at that
[1:21:11] mountain or did you see that over there
[1:21:14] did you see that shopping center it's
[1:21:16] the next exit
[1:21:20] you say look at that tree or look at
[1:21:22] that something when god is trying to get
[1:21:24] you and i
[1:21:25] to look to his innocent substitute and
[1:21:29] look to him look to christ
[1:21:33] he said that's what causes the trouble
[1:21:37] now we're going into the service that's
[1:21:40] what causes the trouble
[1:21:42] when men does he picks up the glasses to
[1:21:47] view off in this distance
[1:21:50] see what god's trying to show him and he
[1:21:52] fails to focus his glasses
[1:21:56] he starts talking about a story about
[1:22:00] one time on a trip in the mountains
[1:22:02] somebody was saying here take these
[1:22:04] glasses
[1:22:05] and look over here at a certain thing
[1:22:07] and i picked up the glasses
[1:22:09] and i seen three or four different
[1:22:11] objects
[1:22:13] he i know there was something wrong with
[1:22:15] that he said this antelope was standing
[1:22:18] out in the field there seemed to be
[1:22:19] three or four of them standing
[1:22:21] together i said what was it the antelope
[1:22:23] was perfectly
[1:22:24] one antelope the glass was all right
[1:22:29] but what i had to do was to draw
[1:22:32] that focus
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:36] some of us get so lazy we just always
[1:22:38] like our hands our head
[1:22:40] and we need to focus today i didn't
[1:22:42] catch that until just right now
[1:22:44] when he said draw the focus and in the
[1:22:46] back room
[1:22:47] the lord put put that on my heart to
[1:22:50] sing draw me
[1:22:51] draw me lord so it must be that he's
[1:22:54] trying to draw
[1:22:55] us to move the focus let's get some
[1:22:58] action in our believing are you going to
[1:23:00] sit there and die
[1:23:01] why should we hear and die
[1:23:05] when there's life when there's a stream
[1:23:07] flowing dip down in it
[1:23:10] he's not asking you to go to the moon
[1:23:12] just dip down into the water
[1:23:16] he's dealing with heart issues
[1:23:20] matters of your life some of you know
[1:23:22] exactly what i'm talking about
[1:23:24] the holy spirit is talking to you right
[1:23:26] now
[1:23:28] and so he was looking into this field
[1:23:30] and he saw three or four things
[1:23:32] when really there was only one out in
[1:23:34] there
[1:23:36] it wasn't something wrong with the
[1:23:37] glasses
[1:23:39] nothing wrong with the antelope
[1:23:42] and really nothing wrong with him but he
[1:23:44] was looking at it wrong
[1:23:48] and there seemed to be three or four of
[1:23:50] them there and there was the antelope
[1:23:52] just standing perfectly the glass was
[1:23:54] all right but i had to
[1:23:55] draw the focus till i got all three of
[1:23:58] the antelopes into one
[1:24:00] and made one antelope
[1:24:03] well brother i know there's three o
[1:24:05] there's four
[1:24:06] can't you see over there there's no
[1:24:09] there's four and then you're back and
[1:24:10] forth
[1:24:11] and somebody else is like there's one
[1:24:15] what's the problem it's how you're
[1:24:17] looking at it
[1:24:19] hello believers i hope you're being
[1:24:21] spiritual today
[1:24:22] but i had to pick up the glass and look
[1:24:24] through it and there was three antelope
[1:24:26] standing there
[1:24:27] the glass was out of focus i have to
[1:24:30] focus that glass back till i get it to a
[1:24:32] place where i can see one antelope
[1:24:35] then the glass draws it close enough to
[1:24:38] me
[1:24:38] till i can see what it looks like
[1:24:43] now he said god gives us the bible
[1:24:46] and the bible is the word and the word
[1:24:49] is god
[1:24:50] so that is our binoculars that's our
[1:24:52] glasses
[1:24:54] then we go to looking in the bible and
[1:24:57] seeing
[1:24:57] four or five different ways
[1:25:02] it needs focusing
[1:25:05] so you say we all read the same bible
[1:25:09] why is there all these ways nothing
[1:25:11] wrong with the bible
[1:25:13] it hasn't changed for thousands of years
[1:25:18] then could it be that it's the way we're
[1:25:20] looking at is it
[1:25:21] then my heart maybe the focus needs to
[1:25:23] change
[1:25:24] and it's the same thing it's us that
[1:25:27] start looking through
[1:25:29] that's why our time gets so challenged
[1:25:32] our time in the bible our time in the
[1:25:34] word
[1:25:35] our time to listen to things that help
[1:25:37] focus and
[1:25:38] you've got to have enough strength to
[1:25:40] move
[1:25:41] and draw and focus
[1:25:44] if you want a new heart if you want to
[1:25:47] then you got to go to the hospital
[1:25:51] you've got to be willing to get out of
[1:25:53] your stubbornness and you're
[1:25:55] so hard-headed i'm going to go to work
[1:25:57] today and i've got to go
[1:25:58] do this and if you're not careful you
[1:26:00] could have a serious heart problem
[1:26:02] and not even know it you start getting
[1:26:05] shortness of breath you start man i used
[1:26:07] to be able to run i used to be able to
[1:26:08] walk i used to be able to live
[1:26:10] now i can't even do the normal things of
[1:26:12] life you've got a heart problem
[1:26:15] there was a senior pastor of the message
[1:26:17] brother jason watkins a few weeks ago he
[1:26:20] just
[1:26:20] tried to go for a walk in his
[1:26:22] neighborhood which he normally did he
[1:26:23] normally could just
[1:26:24] but he just he just noticed it just he
[1:26:26] could hardly walk for 10 minutes it's
[1:26:28] just
[1:26:29] i can't i don't know if i'm going to
[1:26:30] even make it back home
[1:26:33] those are the symptoms but yet you look
[1:26:36] at him he's
[1:26:37] his handsome brother he's married he's
[1:26:39] got a family he's got grandchildren he's
[1:26:41] got a church you say well
[1:26:43] nothing looks wrong to me brother but
[1:26:46] the heart of it there was something
[1:26:49] wrong
[1:26:50] so he went in for tests they couldn't
[1:26:52] find nothing they all kinds of tests and
[1:26:54] things and
[1:26:55] don't don't you worry i'm going to get
[1:26:56] to this i know it takes brother john a
[1:26:58] long time huh
[1:27:01] test and and finally he was in the
[1:27:03] doctors and he started to have
[1:27:06] some of these symptoms right there and
[1:27:07] they and they were able to diagnose it
[1:27:09] and they went
[1:27:10] 99 of one of his main arteries was
[1:27:14] totally locked up
[1:27:16] he had days if not any moment he could
[1:27:19] have just collapsed
[1:27:20] like 99 of his mane
[1:27:24] where the blood was flowing where the
[1:27:26] life was flowing he needed help
[1:27:30] and thank god that god provided away
[1:27:34] and and years ago it would have took
[1:27:36] open heart
[1:27:37] surgery and i have a picture right here
[1:27:39] but i'm not going to show you
[1:27:41] but years ago it used to be they opened
[1:27:43] up the heart and it was like
[1:27:45] literally weeks and weeks of therapy and
[1:27:48] getting you back on your feet again
[1:27:50] do you know they went up through brother
[1:27:52] jason's arm like this
[1:27:54] went right into his heart put a splint
[1:27:56] in there and he's back he's ready to
[1:27:58] preach
[1:27:59] in two weeks unless he's back he's
[1:28:01] strong he's vibrant he
[1:28:04] but friends there could have just been
[1:28:06] any moment he could have collapsed
[1:28:09] but god rich in mercy new there's a
[1:28:11] heart problem
[1:28:12] i wonder today how many spiritual heart
[1:28:15] problems are in the church and it looks
[1:28:18] like they're good and look they drove
[1:28:20] here and they're walking up
[1:28:22] and maybe they sing maybe they but
[1:28:25] there's really the heart
[1:28:26] there's an issue there the matters the
[1:28:29] issues of life
[1:28:31] is trouble friends i trust that god
[1:28:35] would
[1:28:35] raise up a sensitivity more among us
[1:28:39] it was here when brother branham was
[1:28:40] here he would go right down the row
[1:28:42] and say you brother there you there and
[1:28:44] then you sister there and this is your
[1:28:46] name this is your address and
[1:28:47] you sitting there your name is jim hayes
[1:28:50] and this is this is your
[1:28:51] well i know brother jim but okay you
[1:28:52] there and you brother know that and this
[1:28:54] and your sister there know that i don't
[1:28:56] know your name but
[1:28:57] god knows your name and hallelujah this
[1:29:00] is exactly what it is and people wow
[1:29:02] there's a gift of god god is in our
[1:29:04] midst
[1:29:05] let me tell you what friends brother
[1:29:07] branham doing that did not bring god on
[1:29:09] them it
[1:29:10] it brought the people's awareness that
[1:29:13] the god that was in the room
[1:29:15] is present i wonder after all these
[1:29:19] years have we become so
[1:29:20] dull and dead in the message that we we
[1:29:23] just think oh
[1:29:24] nobody knows nobody cares
[1:29:27] nobody sees and little do you know the
[1:29:30] same lord jesus
[1:29:31] that was here 60 years ago is right here
[1:29:34] at christian life tabernacle
[1:29:37] he knows your name he knows your address
[1:29:40] and if brother john would say it right
[1:29:41] out there this is what you were thinking
[1:29:43] yesterday
[1:29:44] at 2 38 is that right sister you were in
[1:29:47] a certain place
[1:29:48] and you went into the wash restroom and
[1:29:51] shut the door
[1:29:52] and there was a pain and there was blood
[1:29:54] but you didn't tell nobody god saw that
[1:29:57] it's actually more serious than you
[1:29:59] think
[1:30:00] but god is here to heal you today
[1:30:03] wouldn't we rejoice today
[1:30:06] would we rejoice because god brought
[1:30:09] that into our attention he
[1:30:11] then why are we so dull why do we need
[1:30:14] those type of things
[1:30:15] as humans to awaken us why can't we take
[1:30:18] the word of god
[1:30:20] when we hear the word when we read it
[1:30:22] why can't we just rejoice at the word
[1:30:26] it's because satan has dulled our senses

[1:32:43] and
[1:32:44] how we think it ought to be and
[1:32:47] can you just look at that and focus in
[1:32:50] and
[1:32:50] draw in there you're over 40 right
[1:32:55] i am oh lord help us might need my
[1:32:57] readers here
[1:32:58] okay love is patient yes
[1:33:02] love is kind amen
[1:33:06] let's have some interaction all right
[1:33:08] little more it's not envy
[1:33:11] all right it is not proud
[1:33:14] oh yeah it does not dishonor others
[1:33:17] praise god
[1:33:18] it is not self-seeking it is not easily
[1:33:21] angered
[1:33:22] oh keeps no record of wrongs
[1:33:25] love does not delight in evil
[1:33:28] oh goodbye always trust
[1:33:32] did you say always always trust you
[1:33:34] couldn't read that before though
[1:33:36] no sir what was wrong i had the focus
[1:33:39] was on it
[1:33:40] it's good word if we heard things like
[1:33:42] this it would help us
[1:33:44] it'd be better than vitamins and oils
[1:33:47] read a little bit more it always
[1:33:49] protects always
[1:33:51] trusts always hopes always preserves
[1:33:55] love never fails
[1:34:05] you're not done but but when you first
[1:34:07] stood up here
[1:34:08] can you hold our sign back up we really
[1:34:11] wanted to know what was back there
[1:34:14] but when you looked through that it was
[1:34:15] all fuzzy can you describe
[1:34:18] it was just everything was blurred
[1:34:19] together you couldn't see nothing
[1:34:21] wow kind of like now i can't see no i
[1:34:24] can't read it either brother
[1:34:27] we're over 40 that's right we're
[1:34:29] suffering together
[1:34:32] but could that be why that people look
[1:34:34] at things in their life and it's all
[1:34:36] fuzzy
[1:34:37] they don't see clearly absolutely
[1:34:40] wow
[1:34:44] but the sign didn't change so what
[1:34:46] happened that you were able to read that
[1:34:47] to us
[1:34:51] it went from blurry to clear very clear
[1:34:53] can you bring it up and the last line
[1:34:55] you read
[1:34:56] you're going to have to stand up brother
[1:34:57] because the last line there can you read
[1:35:00] that again focus in it always protects
[1:35:02] always trust
[1:35:04] always hopes always preserves love
[1:35:07] never fails
[1:35:11] i think love never fails that just does
[1:35:13] something for me
[1:35:14] yes sir then i want more of love
[1:35:18] let's give our brother a round of
[1:35:19] applause thank you brother i love you
[1:35:21] love you
[1:35:22] thank you jesus
[1:35:27] i'm glad we can come to dallas and not
[1:35:29] have social distancing
[1:35:33] i gave him a hug praise god there's
[1:35:36] something about
[1:35:36] it but was there anything wrong with the
[1:35:41] brother
[1:35:41] same brother same binoculars
[1:35:46] let's say that sign was the will of god
[1:35:48] for your life
[1:35:49] let's say it's the direction for your
[1:35:51] future and you're trying to find out
[1:35:53] what is that and you squint and you look
[1:35:55] and then you don't know you go to a
[1:35:57] service you read
[1:35:58] and i just don't you and you're just
[1:36:00] trying and god
[1:36:01] then brings in a focus and you're able
[1:36:04] to see clearly you're able to walk
[1:36:06] toward that
[1:36:07] isn't that different
[1:36:10] how many today would say lord focus my
[1:36:13] life to your word
[1:36:14] let me see what you want me to see
[1:36:19] not three or four out there and brother
[1:36:22] i know there's three
[1:36:24] and i know there's four and then another
[1:36:25] brother say all right there's two well
[1:36:28] focus it in there's only one over there
[1:36:32] is that why there's so much fighting and
[1:36:34] trouble
[1:36:35] and grudges then ulcers then fungus is
[1:36:39] because
[1:36:39] there's a heart problem then it's not
[1:36:42] the binoculars it's not going out there
[1:36:45] buying a five thousand dollar pair
[1:36:49] there's got to be something wrong with
[1:36:51] the bible
[1:36:53] got to be something wrong with the
[1:36:55] message then what are you going to do
[1:36:56] with your time now you're going to watch
[1:36:58] more movies
[1:37:01] go spend more money go work
[1:37:05] try to put your money in in your pocket
[1:37:08] and
[1:37:08] you find out there's a bunch of holes in
[1:37:10] there and it's falling down your socks
[1:37:12] and your stockings and you wonder where
[1:37:13] it all went and you work
[1:37:15] you work 80 hours and 90 hours and
[1:37:17] you're still not
[1:37:18] any better off what is it well well it
[1:37:21] is the economy but it's also
[1:37:23] are you really seeking first the kingdom
[1:37:25] of god
[1:37:27] are you really finding out what his mind
[1:37:29] is for your life or
[1:37:30] you're just like everyone else in the
[1:37:32] world that's struggling going
[1:37:34] here there do you know the path of least
[1:37:36] resistance or
[1:37:37] you know one day brother john i'm going
[1:37:39] to run into that
[1:37:41] that brother this is going to be
[1:37:42] everything to me and then you wake up
[1:37:44] two years later and you find out he
[1:37:46] has mistakes and fail and that's sister
[1:37:49] she's just going to be this and
[1:37:51] somebody's going to say yes to me and
[1:37:53] then it's all going to be this and she's
[1:37:55] going to be submissive and she's going
[1:37:57] to say yes all the time and all then
[1:37:59] then she says no and she
[1:38:01] says opposite and then you're in and
[1:38:02] then you're in there
[1:38:06] i know that doesn't happen in this
[1:38:07] church but i'm just saying you know
[1:38:09] that's
[1:38:10] other people you know it's a heart
[1:38:13] thing it's friends not one of us have it
[1:38:16] all together we need the body
[1:38:19] there's not one person that can see it
[1:38:21] all clearly or
[1:38:23] there can be an accident or an injury
[1:38:25] you know that's why boxers if you notice
[1:38:28] or martial arts they'll get into a place
[1:38:30] where they get a little cut
[1:38:32] or they get a little bl something going
[1:38:34] and they'll keep punching at that
[1:38:35] punching at that weakness
[1:38:36] and then pretty soon where you can be
[1:38:38] strong you i'm bigger than and then all
[1:38:40] but you get a little blood going and it
[1:38:42] goes into the eye and you can't see
[1:38:44] and then pretty soon they'll blindside
[1:38:46] you they'll you might be better
[1:38:48] you might be bigger but there's blood
[1:38:50] and it causes your vision
[1:38:56] you have a two or three thousand dollar
[1:38:59] pair of binoculars but if your eyes are
[1:39:01] all bloodshot and this and that and
[1:39:04] if you have a heart attack you're laying
[1:39:06] down in the hospital room somewhere
[1:39:09] you need help you might have drove by
[1:39:12] that place for the last three years but
[1:39:14] today
[1:39:15] you need the hospital so you go driving
[1:39:17] in there an ambulance takes you
[1:39:19] you know you used to not be so excited i
[1:39:21] got i need help
[1:39:23] i need a word i need counsel when you
[1:39:26] got it all together and you're going
[1:39:27] good
[1:39:28] and life's good
[1:39:31] but there comes a crisis there comes a
[1:39:34] situation
[1:39:36] there's a minister in florida he's not
[1:39:39] the senior pastor
[1:39:40] but he's an associate and he has a
[1:39:41] wonderful wife and they have wonderful
[1:39:43] children that serve the lord and
[1:39:45] grandchildren
[1:39:46] but i think it was a year or year and a
[1:39:49] half ago
[1:39:50] she got diagnosed with a certain
[1:39:52] physical condition
[1:39:53] it was like cancer something serious
[1:39:55] down in her organs
[1:39:57] they live in florida in a certain city
[1:40:01] and we were sitting with them the other
[1:40:02] day this is now over a year
[1:40:04] a year or something later by the jackson
[1:40:07] they're giving us this testimony
[1:40:13] how many believe god heals god heals
[1:40:18] god heals by medicine god heals by
[1:40:21] doctors god heals by music
[1:40:23] don't worry i got all the quotes right
[1:40:25] here on that subject god heals by love
[1:40:28] i'm trying to get some of you to focus
[1:40:31] focus in
[1:40:32] god heals it's god that heals
[1:40:36] god heals with care a little bit of care
[1:40:40] you talk to someone that is listening to
[1:40:43] you
[1:40:43] which we don't do very good at in this
[1:40:45] generation we want everything fast fast
[1:40:47] fast drive through
[1:40:50] you just talk to somebody that actually
[1:40:52] listens
[1:40:53] and they're trying to understand that
[1:40:56] can heal a person
[1:40:58] you all know that that's what brother
[1:41:00] branham said
[1:41:01] in fact it so struck brother branham he
[1:41:04] said god heals by care
[1:41:06] that a few days later he preached he
[1:41:08] cares
[1:41:09] do you care and then he said the same
[1:41:11] thing again god
[1:41:13] heals we all say amen but god heals by
[1:41:16] different ways so the sister
[1:41:20] now she's been diagnosed with this
[1:41:22] condition she
[1:41:23] she chooses to go into chemotherapy and
[1:41:26] her husband was very wise about how he
[1:41:28] handled her
[1:41:29] he gave her you know we can do this or
[1:41:32] we can do that we can choose natural
[1:41:34] nature we can go that way or we can
[1:41:37] choose and there's side effects there's
[1:41:39] things that could happen
[1:41:41] she chose to do the chemotherapy and go
[1:41:43] that way
[1:41:44] thank the lord she didn't lose all her
[1:41:46] hair god gave her mercy and grace for
[1:41:49] nine months she went through this trial
[1:41:52] she had to go i don't know if it was
[1:41:54] daily but several times a week to the
[1:41:56] chemo place and
[1:41:58] have blood and things go through her
[1:42:00] system and have
[1:42:01] and things and then there'll be certain
[1:42:02] side effects but by the grace of god
[1:42:05] she recovered and we sat across the
[1:42:08] table the other day
[1:42:09] she's well she's alive
[1:42:13] but what was amazing talking to the
[1:42:16] husband he said brother john
[1:42:18] that chemotherapy place was in our town
[1:42:21] all these years for years we've drove by
[1:42:25] that road for years we went by
[1:42:27] but we never had a need to go in there
[1:42:30] until crisis strike and a matter until
[1:42:33] an
[1:42:33] issue then that address became more
[1:42:37] important before
[1:42:38] you would have asked for the address and
[1:42:40] put it into my gps but after going there
[1:42:42] two or three weeks now
[1:42:44] we just drive that we realize our normal
[1:42:46] course of life was this way but we have
[1:42:48] to turn in here and go over there
[1:42:51] oh i say such a pain such a frustration
[1:42:54] you know i gotta go to work i gotta well
[1:42:57] friend if you don't do what you gotta do
[1:42:58] you're not gonna be here to work
[1:43:02] well i gotta make money or i gotta do
[1:43:05] this well friends sometimes the lord
[1:43:06] does things to shake us a little bit
[1:43:10] get us out of our normal little rut that
[1:43:13] we live in
[1:43:15] teenagers get in a rut people in their
[1:43:17] 20s get in a rut
[1:43:18] in their middle age elders in the
[1:43:20] message can get in a rut
[1:43:27] i'm just asking the lord right now how
[1:43:30] much i should say
[1:43:34] because in the world we have what's
[1:43:37] facing a lot of elderly people is
[1:43:39] dementia and alzheimer's and
[1:43:43] you can get to where a person you look
[1:43:46] at them
[1:43:48] and they used to be strong and
[1:43:50] responsive and interacting and they know
[1:43:53] you
[1:43:54] we're family we're believers but
[1:43:57] because of time and matters
[1:44:00] you walk into the room and they don't
[1:44:01] even know you
[1:44:05] you can go away for a week and you
[1:44:07] fellowship with them you
[1:44:09] shook their hand and you come back and
[1:44:11] it's like they don't even know you
[1:44:13] it's like we never even shook hands or
[1:44:16] talked and it's like
[1:44:17] it's sadness you see a person degrading
[1:44:20] from
[1:44:21] being like a flower and being so
[1:44:23] wonderful
[1:44:24] till they just become so unresponsive
[1:44:29] just a dull stare
[1:44:32] they just lose they just sit there
[1:44:36] and they wheel them out or they're
[1:44:38] laying on a bed of affliction
[1:44:40] it's very sad it's called dementia
[1:44:44] alzheimer's my grandfather had it
[1:44:47] and many times you can go he walked and
[1:44:49] walked and walked he was
[1:44:50] vibrant exercised and then it came to a
[1:44:54] place they couldn't care for him any
[1:44:56] longer in the home
[1:44:57] you do all you can as family then you
[1:44:59] can't take care of their personal needs
[1:45:01] then they go into a facility it's like
[1:45:04] brother john
[1:45:05] they were at the top of their class or
[1:45:07] they were in the service or
[1:45:08] they did this in life but now look at
[1:45:10] what's happened they've lost their minds
[1:45:15] i'm not so much focusing on the natural
[1:45:18] i'm thinking spiritually how many
[1:45:22] among us even have lost their minds
[1:45:25] spiritually spiritual dementia
[1:45:29] amnesia spiritual alzheimer's
[1:45:34] i took the liberty to talk about that i
[1:45:36] hope you're not offended but it can
[1:45:37] affect the elders and the older ones in
[1:45:39] the message
[1:45:46] and they're projecting it to be a
[1:45:47] certain way and it's not working
[1:45:51] they really don't know what to do
[1:45:55] and how to do it for this hour
[1:45:59] yet it seems like they have their body
[1:46:00] functions it seems like they're in the
[1:46:02] position
[1:46:03] it seems like that sister or their
[1:46:04] brother they might even write ties or
[1:46:06] offerings they might
[1:46:08] try to make their life happen but they
[1:46:10] are broken
[1:46:15] oh jesus why does the lord lay these
[1:46:19] things on a minister's heart
[1:46:21] i think it's for the people i believe it
[1:46:24] for us to recognize
[1:46:26] god help us if there's spiritual
[1:46:27] dementia or alzheimer's in our midst
[1:46:29] lord jesus
[1:46:31] we've got to suffer with one another
[1:46:33] through these times
[1:46:34] and bear with one another through these
[1:46:36] times even in your youth when you feel
[1:46:38] so strong
[1:46:39] naturally but spiritually you can be
[1:46:42] totally with a heart issue that's got
[1:46:45] your heart
[1:46:46] and satan has got your life and your
[1:46:48] spirit
[1:46:49] and your life that's why you don't have
[1:46:51] the will
[1:46:52] and the passion for christ satan is
[1:46:55] trying to choke out the
[1:46:56] the lifeline to your heart and god today
[1:47:00] is trying to set that free and put a
[1:47:02] splint in there so you can live and walk
[1:47:06] and breathe breathe
[1:47:11] that's why the bible says jesus breathed
[1:47:14] on them
[1:47:15] and gave them a promise receive ye the
[1:47:18] holy ghost
[1:47:20] it wasn't his breath it was a promise
[1:47:24] brother branham said
[1:47:25] and they went up to pentecost and
[1:47:27] received the holy ghost
[1:47:30] it's not so much immediate it's what
[1:47:33] happens
[1:47:33] afterwards really shows whether you got
[1:47:36] the revelation
[1:47:38] lord don't just give me an emotional
[1:47:40] experience where i'm
[1:47:41] under the charisma of the preacher or
[1:47:43] the meeting or the songs but
[1:47:45] give me a desire lord give me a hunger
[1:47:49] that when i'm all alone i want to seek
[1:47:51] your faith
[1:47:56] i tell you friends the first five
[1:47:58] minutes after the rapture happens
[1:48:00] people that knew about the lord will
[1:48:02] haunt them
[1:48:04] why they didn't respond to the word they
[1:48:07] will long for meetings like this they
[1:48:09] were long for an atmosphere they were
[1:48:11] long
[1:48:12] can you imagine the rapture happening
[1:48:15] and someone missing the rapture
[1:48:16] the holy spirit lifts off the earth they
[1:48:19] will
[1:48:19] never have that again until the white
[1:48:22] throne judgment
[1:48:28] the presence you felt this morning
[1:48:29] brother steve let us in worship sister
[1:48:32] julia sang
[1:48:33] our brother prayed now we're hearing the
[1:48:35] word the presence that you feel right
[1:48:37] now
[1:48:38] comes from god nobody's forcing you
[1:48:41] no one's manipulating your mind no one's
[1:48:45] taking your money
[1:48:48] i'm not abusing and tormenting your mind
[1:48:52] i pray you're not taking it that way the
[1:48:54] presence that we feel right now
[1:48:56] has enough power to heal you there's
[1:48:59] enough
[1:49:00] dynamics and what where the atmosphere
[1:49:02] right now is to change your mortal body
[1:49:05] the word you've been feeding on ha the
[1:49:07] chemistry of it
[1:49:09] there's power in that enough to cover
[1:49:11] the multitude of sin
[1:49:13] all your past life as though you never
[1:49:15] did it in the first place
[1:49:17] it's because you're hearing thus saith
[1:49:19] the lord i give you life
[1:49:21] i give you healing i give you joy i give
[1:49:24] you peace
[1:49:25] i give you the holy ghost
[1:49:29] not as the world give i unto you but we
[1:49:32] give you peace
[1:49:33] that will last forever long after the
[1:49:36] meeting long after sunday into monday
[1:49:39] into tuesday
[1:49:40] there's a presence of god there's an
[1:49:42] atmosphere
[1:49:44] there's something that touches your
[1:49:46] heart
[1:49:49] aren't you thankful for that sister that
[1:49:51] i just gave a testimony of
[1:49:53] that she was delivered of cancer
[1:49:58] but it was a process
[1:50:04] i would say it was a miracle but a
[1:50:06] miracle
[1:50:07] is usually instant and happens so would
[1:50:09] you accept a healing
[1:50:13] god heals that's that's why i'm focusing
[1:50:15] on that
[1:50:17] someone texted me the other day i was
[1:50:18] literally thousands of miles away and
[1:50:21] and we had already counseled them and
[1:50:22] there's a serious situation
[1:50:28] and i just asked them would you be
[1:50:30] willing to take them
[1:50:32] a healing because they said
[1:50:35] outside of a miracle i need a miracle
[1:50:38] and i agree i'd love it to be over
[1:50:42] just like that i don't want their pain
[1:50:45] and their breaking that's going on
[1:50:47] anymore
[1:50:49] but i just felt to ask them would you be
[1:50:51] willing to take a healing
[1:50:55] if god don't do it immediately but
[1:50:57] you've committed it to god
[1:50:59] are you willing to take a healing
[1:51:07] i wonder if that was you on the other
[1:51:09] hand if you got so upset and brother
[1:51:11] john you
[1:51:12] do i want this over i want do you know
[1:51:14] understand what happened
[1:51:16] to me well we did because we'd spent
[1:51:18] hours with him
[1:51:19] i'd love it to be over i'd love the
[1:51:21] brokenhearted
[1:51:23] and the contrite for it to be over like
[1:51:26] that
[1:51:27] but any heart doctor knows and i have it
[1:51:31] right in front because
[1:51:32] i was sitting in the service the other
[1:51:34] day just over here
[1:51:35] and i had it just in my heart how long
[1:51:38] does it take for a heart surgery
[1:51:41] does anybody in this room know i know we
[1:51:43] have nurses and
[1:51:45] seeing it how long does it take to do a
[1:51:47] heart surgery
[1:51:50] i begin to think about that
[1:51:53] because we are an age that wants
[1:51:55] everything like this we
[1:51:57] starbucks drive through mcdonald's we
[1:51:59] will drive
[1:52:00] we want it now yesterday well when would
[1:52:03] you like this
[1:52:04] yesterday that's why i'm asking you
[1:52:07] when do you want this file yesterday
[1:52:10] all right i get what you're talking
[1:52:12] about and you get anxious and you get
[1:52:15] everything's now
[1:52:17] and everything gotta have it and all
[1:52:19] this puts pressure on the mind puts
[1:52:21] pressure on the body and on the spirit
[1:52:23] and
[1:52:23] we're not careful it'll break you
[1:52:27] i'm talking to good christians today
[1:52:30] some of you have
[1:52:31] served the lord longer than i have but
[1:52:33] it will break you
[1:52:34] if you're not careful
[1:52:38] brother branham goes on to say here in
[1:52:41] the same message that
[1:52:42] you are a triune being of soul body and
[1:52:45] spirit and these forces
[1:52:46] that work in you work in your mind and
[1:52:49] your spirit and he said the natural mind
[1:52:51] it might be highly polished and want to
[1:52:53] achieve things by intelligence
[1:52:57] but there's a spiritual person inside of
[1:52:59] you
[1:53:01] and that's what causes the trouble right
[1:53:04] there
[1:53:05] you try to make it out in yourself
[1:53:09] this is victory day 1963 if you really
[1:53:13] want victory
[1:53:15] he said you're made up of body spirit
[1:53:17] and soul
[1:53:18] and intellectual and if you're not
[1:53:21] careful
[1:53:22] he said you try to work it out in
[1:53:24] yourself and there's
[1:53:26] what causes the trouble
[1:53:30] the doctor's in amen
[1:53:33] hallelujah the doctor's in
[1:53:38] i just had to give an announcement the
[1:53:40] doctor's in
[1:53:43] the doctor's in how many of you've gone
[1:53:46] up to a place of business and
[1:53:47] establishment and it'll say

[2:00:50] live
[2:00:52] it's got to become practical what we
[2:00:54] believe
[2:00:55] i was in south carolina a few weeks ago
[2:00:58] is this okay
[2:00:59] testimony time
[2:01:03] i was speaking to young people i was it
[2:01:05] was a youth meeting
[2:01:07] i think there were 23 different
[2:01:10] churches represented then just packed
[2:01:13] out
[2:01:14] it was hot it was hot in the building
[2:01:17] it was 82 degrees the thermostat was
[2:01:19] over here and
[2:01:20] friday night brother jackson it was hot
[2:01:25] but we're preaching preaching families
[2:01:28] had come
[2:01:28] young people had came they're trying to
[2:01:30] minister to young people
[2:01:32] but for about 45 seconds or a minute i
[2:01:35] just
[2:01:36] said something about a broken heart
[2:01:40] i just made a comment about a broken
[2:01:43] heart
[2:01:44] and if you are suffering today from a
[2:01:47] broken heart
[2:01:49] there's healing for you
[2:01:53] it was just about 45 seconds or a minute
[2:02:01] after the service and later they
[2:02:02] fellowshipped and they had tents set up
[2:02:04] outside all the visitors and people are
[2:02:07] fellowshipping there came a brother over
[2:02:09] i've known this brother
[2:02:12] for many many years before he was even
[2:02:14] married now he's
[2:02:16] been through trouble and then
[2:02:20] married he brought his young people from
[2:02:22] hours away to the service so
[2:02:24] his young people could benefit
[2:02:28] his eyes began to well up he began to
[2:02:30] just speak to me said brother john
[2:02:33] before the service the pre-service i
[2:02:36] came in early
[2:02:38] and i was thinking about what i had gone
[2:02:40] through because
[2:02:41] he's been raised in the message a
[2:02:46] preacher's kid
[2:02:47] we'd say he was pastor son
[2:02:53] father ended up leaving the message
[2:02:55] mother ended up
[2:02:56] leaving they separated
[2:03:00] this young man married someone and it
[2:03:05] was not good and the relationship went
[2:03:07] bad
[2:03:08] she'd been raised in the message but it
[2:03:10] didn't go good
[2:03:12] he's thinking about this before the
[2:03:14] service
[2:03:15] it's a young people's meeting
[2:03:19] it'd be like this family's sitting right
[2:03:20] here and you got boys and you got girls
[2:03:23] and you
[2:03:23] he comes in a little early and he's
[2:03:25] praying to the lord about
[2:03:27] and he said lord my heart's broken
[2:03:30] i'm broken
[2:03:34] i you seek my fam spiritually
[2:03:38] my family my parents it's like i'm
[2:03:41] broken
[2:03:42] can you just speak to me and his eyes
[2:03:46] begin to well up he said brother john
[2:03:47] when you said that
[2:03:48] about broken heart god heals a broken
[2:03:52] heart
[2:03:53] his eyes begin to well i say god speak
[2:03:56] more to us like that
[2:03:58] answer the prayers of our people don't
[2:04:01] let us become so stubborn and
[2:04:02] churchy and into the form that god can't
[2:04:06] talk to the matters
[2:04:08] can the church say amen let me give you
[2:04:11] another testimony we came
[2:04:13] through the whole weekend of meetings my
[2:04:15] it was just fantastic
[2:04:18] one of the leading sisters of the team
[2:04:21] i'm leaving my notes now but months
[2:04:24] earlier
[2:04:24] her family was just teenagers and the
[2:04:28] things that go on and the
[2:04:29] struggle the lord just inspired her with
[2:04:33] a scripture
[2:04:34] i will restore
[2:04:38] will restore
[2:04:41] till she just started to write that all
[2:04:43] over all kinds of little sticky notes

[2:04:57] didn't know none of this
[2:05:00] we came to the meeting and the very
[2:05:02] first service opened our bible
[2:05:05] god had laid it on our hearts to speak
[2:05:06] out of joel i
[2:05:08] will restore all the years that the
[2:05:12] cankerworm pomera worm locust has tried
[2:05:14] to eat away at your life

[2:05:59] family was in chaos
[2:06:01] teenagers and young people coming up to
[2:06:03] this
[2:06:05] but to hear now it was laid on the heart
[2:06:07] of the visiting minister that didn't
[2:06:08] know
[2:06:09] nothing
[2:06:12] and the minister got up behind me and
[2:06:14] said brother john doesn't know this but

[2:06:19] and then weeks ago she got this
[2:06:21] inspiration put it all over her house i

[2:06:46] with the heart of the matters he can
[2:06:49] deal with
[2:06:50] all kinds of matters it's not he's not a
[2:06:52] one just one per he can deal with
[2:06:55] young middle-aged old people that don't
[2:06:57] go to church people that's been in the
[2:06:58] message
[2:07:00] you could have walked in here off the
[2:07:01] street today god can just talk to you
[2:07:05] so now we went friday saturday sunday
[2:07:07] we're late sunday night
[2:07:08] and some of the workers had all got
[2:07:10] together all the team we were just given
[2:07:12] testimony it was in the evening time and
[2:07:15] now we're all given testimony people's
[2:07:17] crying we're weeping well
[2:07:19] there was a young lady that was there
[2:07:20] can i give this testimony
[2:07:24] she was one of the ones that was on the
[2:07:26] front lines working to help provide we
[2:07:28] were in her home
[2:07:30] that night given testimony but she
[2:07:33] reached back into when she was a
[2:07:35] teenager
[2:07:36] she was also raised in the message and
[2:07:38] also a minister's daughter
[2:07:40] but a 16 year old
[2:07:43] 16 year old young lady just fighting for
[2:07:46] her life
[2:07:46] she she didn't have her heart changed
[2:07:49] yet she's just
[2:07:49] fighting and she got to such a
[2:07:52] desperation
[2:07:53] she started cutting herself
[2:07:57] have you ever heard of that a person
[2:08:00] starts
[2:08:00] cutting themselves and a lot of times
[2:08:02] it's young ladies they get into such a
[2:08:04] place
[2:08:06] of despair
[2:08:09] it doesn't make sense i'm confused why
[2:08:12] is this happening
[2:08:14] her father's a minister she goes to
[2:08:16] church
[2:08:20] might as well just leave your comfort
[2:08:21] zone for a little bit
[2:08:23] it doesn't matter if it's a message
[2:08:24] church things go on all the time
[2:08:27] you might as well just put your little
[2:08:28] wings aside we're talking about human
[2:08:31] beings
[2:08:33] it's not heart disease it's sin disease
[2:08:38] and here it is she's cutting herself
[2:08:40] nobody knows she
[2:08:42] is going through this trouble she
[2:08:45] is trying to grow up and she starts
[2:08:48] cutting herself in private
[2:08:52] but one day she even i'm reading
[2:08:57] she said i wanted to die
[2:09:00] i've got the original note because i
[2:09:02] reached into my little bag and i started
[2:09:04] writing this as she was saying
[2:09:05] she said i wanted to die
[2:09:10] she became vulnerable depressed
[2:09:13] the demon spirit just started squashing
[2:09:15] her
[2:09:17] but thank god god met her one day
[2:09:20] she gave her heart to the lord she's
[2:09:23] totally changed
[2:09:25] but she had scars
[2:09:29] she had scars she's so embarrassed now
[2:09:34] she tries to go to church she said i
[2:09:36] want to praise the lord
[2:09:38] i want to lift my hands but she wore a
[2:09:40] long sleeve sometimes sometimes it was
[2:09:42] very very warm i'm going back to
[2:09:44] march april she's very is very very warm
[2:09:48] so maybe short sleep she said i can't
[2:09:50] raise my hand i got so many scars
[2:09:53] i'm embarrassed that what i even went
[2:09:56] that low
[2:09:57] in my life i wanted to take my life and
[2:10:02] satan wasn't allowed to go that far so
[2:10:04] it's attention it's just
[2:10:06] i want some it's a cry for help
[2:10:09] what anybody does anybody even care or
[2:10:14] are you just always going to preach
[2:10:15] about the mysteries and
[2:10:16] the deep mysteries when we got people
[2:10:18] right among us that have serious
[2:10:21] heart issues a 16 year old cutting
[2:10:24] herself
[2:10:25] depressed but after she's changed and
[2:10:28] now she's at a youth camp some of you
[2:10:30] know this testimony but
[2:10:32] this is the person this is the young
[2:10:34] lady now she's married and
[2:10:36] has children but she's given us this
[2:10:38] testimony it was her
[2:10:42] now she's in louisiana camp and she's
[2:10:44] just with hundreds of other believers
[2:10:46] and hundreds of other
[2:10:47] saints and young people some of you have
[2:10:49] been there and just the glory of god and
[2:10:51] she said lord i want to
[2:10:52] i want to worship i want to praise but
[2:10:55] i'm so embarrassed of my scars
[2:10:57] and what i've been through but finally
[2:10:59] she just broke through and said lord i'm
[2:11:00] going to raise my hands anyway
[2:11:02] she just stood and began to praise and
[2:11:04] worship god throughout that glorious
[2:11:07] service and then when she this is the
[2:11:09] supernatural part
[2:11:10] when she brought down her arm she looked
[2:11:12] and all the scars were gone
[2:11:18] they were gone
[2:11:22] god not only deals with the issue
[2:11:26] he'll deal with the scar
[2:11:30] and a scar on your life means that
[2:11:34] you've gone through
[2:11:35] something but it didn't take your life
[2:11:38] it didn't destroy you stop talking about
[2:11:42] the scar
[2:11:42] stop talking about how bad it is stop
[2:11:45] talking about somebody done somebody
[2:11:47] wrong song stop talking about your
[2:11:50] childhood that was so
[2:11:51] this and your marriage that and i was
[2:11:53] hurt stop talking about that
[2:11:56] focus in focus in
[2:12:00] i'm giving you some binoculars i'm
[2:12:02] giving you some aids today
[2:12:06] look to the promise look to the word
[2:12:09] love never fails
[2:12:14] it's a neglect of love why there's so
[2:12:16] many breakages and marriages it's a
[2:12:20] neglect
[2:12:21] of love why there's separation in
[2:12:23] churches
[2:12:24] that's a a quota brother branham
[2:12:27] it's neglect of love
[2:12:31] i didn't say he didn't have love it's
[2:12:35] neglect
[2:12:37] say but i love that person i i love
[2:12:40] it's neglect it's pushing it aside it's
[2:12:44] i don't have time for this i'm so bored

[2:12:50] yet you'll watch a two-hour movie
[2:12:53] and eat popcorn and snack on whatever
[2:12:56] and it just goes by like that
[2:12:58] in the presence of god and the word of
[2:13:00] god you're so bored you know why
[2:13:02] it's a heart problem you get somebody
[2:13:05] that's real passionate
[2:13:07] about something it's like an hour goes
[2:13:09] by hour and a half goes by it's like

[2:13:29] even teenagers they'll be willing
[2:13:31] to give a testimony
[2:13:35] this is what mommy went through this is
[2:13:37] what daddy went through and it's not
[2:13:39] always glory hallelujah happy times
[2:13:44] it's a mother a father an elder
[2:13:47] that's willing to brush the dementia
[2:13:49] side the
[2:13:50] amnesia aside and say this is where i
[2:13:53] was too
[2:13:55] and the same god that helped me deliver
[2:13:58] me
[2:13:58] filled me is here for you it's a person
[2:14:02] that's willing to jump down in the
[2:14:03] trenches and get dirty
[2:14:05] and be willing to be misunderstood
[2:14:11] the bible says in galatians the
[2:14:13] foolishness
[2:14:14] of preaching in other words the preacher
[2:14:18] became like a fool
[2:14:20] so that the people could see christ
[2:14:25] oh my then lord help us to find that
[2:14:28] channel lord
[2:14:29] and i spoke to the group you know
[2:14:31] because we all want to hide our past and
[2:14:34] don't tell our young people that we
[2:14:36] actually went through
[2:14:38] those things too i actually had to speak
[2:14:41] to them and say
[2:14:42] that's what you should be doing
[2:14:45] is actually being open and confessing to
[2:14:48] them
[2:14:49] mommy went through that too daddy went
[2:14:51] through that too
[2:14:53] stop stop portraying it that we're all
[2:14:55] superstar faith heroes hallelujah
[2:14:59] we we don't live on the mountain
[2:15:03] it's in the valley he restores our soul
[2:15:05] it's in the valley where fruit is
[2:15:07] growing
[2:15:08] it's in the valley where rugged men and
[2:15:11] rugged women
[2:15:12] meet god face to face
[2:15:16] in sacred sands what they are in the
[2:15:19] private
[2:15:20] comes out public and you think meetings
[2:15:22] like this or services or meetings where
[2:15:25] god
[2:15:25] touches you that it just happens like
[2:15:27] that and oh when i get out here then i'm
[2:15:29] just going to preach a man no no no

[2:16:18] because the ministers are get
[2:16:20] arrogant and preach elitism and they
[2:16:24] speak you know condescending and then it
[2:16:26] becomes an attitude in the church
[2:16:28] friends you don't want the spirit of the
[2:16:30] preacher you want the holy spirit
[2:16:33] we don't just want the heart of the
[2:16:34] preacher we want the heart of god
[2:16:36] and i'm not saying that negative i'm a
[2:16:38] minister you want more than brother john
[2:16:41] we need jesus he's dealing with the
[2:16:45] heart of the matters that i know

[2:20:30] brother branham said they made up and
[2:20:31] and the man said let's continue to
[2:20:34] raise our children and raise our family
[2:20:36] see there wasn't a breakage
[2:20:39] it was how it was handled it was the
[2:20:42] confession it was
[2:20:43] being honest
[2:20:46] that's right it's being open and saying
[2:20:49] i am wrong
[2:20:51] then let's raise our children and our
[2:20:52] family and they come back to brother
[2:20:54] branham
[2:20:54] tears streaming out of their face
[2:20:59] praise the lord it's not just
[2:21:02] to expose the problem it's to have the
[2:21:06] remedy
[2:21:07] to what we need to do and friends today
[2:21:10] you
[2:21:10] know yourself we all know ourselves
[2:21:13] it's not great big thing to expose the
[2:21:16] problem
[2:21:17] it's now what is the answer what are we
[2:21:20] going to do about this
[2:21:21] that's the heart of the matter so it's
[2:21:24] not talking about being a sunday school
[2:21:25] teacher
[2:21:26] and being a deacon and talking about how
[2:21:29] good you sing
[2:21:30] and talking about you've been in the
[2:21:31] church that's not gonna
[2:21:33] it's not pouring a gallon of oil on her
[2:21:35] head and he says
[2:21:36] not screaming and shouting no it's going
[2:21:39] to the heart of the matter
[2:21:41] how many believe that today that same
[2:21:44] lord jesus
[2:21:45] is in this building right now the same
[2:21:47] angel of the lord and the same gift
[2:21:51] knows everything about us
[2:21:54] you don't need to be embarrassed we're
[2:21:56] all on the same journey
[2:21:58] we want to make it out of here but what
[2:22:01] needs to happen
[2:22:02] is we need to focus and draw
[2:22:06] our lives into an atmosphere where we're
[2:22:08] willing
[2:22:10] where we're willing to do whatever it
[2:22:12] takes
[2:22:13] and i say god put in a new heart
[2:22:19] put in a new spirit i don't want the old
[2:22:22] heart made over
[2:22:23] and this and that and lord jesus
[2:22:27] i can't walk out of here with the same
[2:22:28] attitude
[2:22:31] you know what how i can say that is a
[2:22:34] prophet said that
[2:22:35] and standing in the gap he said would
[2:22:39] you pray for me
[2:22:40] i've lost my feeling for the people
[2:22:43] you pray for me
[2:22:47] that's how we can be so strong this
[2:22:50] morning
[2:22:50] and confident even in our weakness is
[2:22:53] because we've had a good example
[2:22:56] of a man that would be willing publicly
[2:22:59] to say
[2:23:00] would you pray for me brother would you
[2:23:02] pray with me sister
[2:23:04] would this church pray for me wow that's
[2:23:07] incredible
[2:23:08] you know what that does for everyone in
[2:23:09] that church it just causes everybody to
[2:23:12] go
[2:23:14] then if our prophet can say that they
[2:23:16] call it him their pastor
[2:23:19] then i can be that honest would you pray
[2:23:21] for me
[2:23:23] and you know and maybe our musicians
[2:23:25] will come
[2:23:26] i don't want you to be distracted it was
[2:23:28] in in the end of that service
[2:23:30] that a man sitting right about where
[2:23:32] this sister is right here
[2:23:34] he collapsed dead brother way
[2:23:38] brother branham had talked throughout
[2:23:40] the service about having a complex and
[2:23:42] he said brother way you have a complex
[2:23:44] and
[2:23:44] throughout the meeting and then brother
[2:23:46] branham's closing the service you can
[2:23:48] hear all this on tape
[2:23:49] and then listen to the night service on
[2:23:51] flashing red light if he's coming
[2:23:52] brother branham lays it all out said i'm
[2:23:55] closing the service
[2:23:57] i'm about ready to end the meeting and
[2:23:59] he just collapses and sister
[2:24:01] way is sitting right next to him and
[2:24:04] she's a registered nurse
[2:24:06] and her husband collapses no
[2:24:09] pulse and his eyes rolled back he's gone
[2:24:14] right in the meeting his heart stopped
[2:24:17] brother branham went around there oh
[2:24:20] brother brown and brother brandon became
[2:24:21] screaming
[2:24:22] he goes around and brother branham feels
[2:24:24] there's no pulse
[2:24:27] he's gone he said in sunday night
[2:24:29] service he said well
[2:24:31] if you're a christian there's no better
[2:24:34] place to go but in the house of god
[2:24:36] if it's your time to go amen
[2:24:40] precious in the sight of the lord if
[2:24:41] it's my time to go
[2:24:44] but he just prayed a simple prayer
[2:24:48] ladies hands on brother way
[2:24:52] i mean commotion people around us like
[2:24:54] hey brother branham talks about it even
[2:24:56] billy paul was like oh
[2:24:58] about dead people and people have some
[2:24:59] weird thing about
[2:25:01] dead people he said they're gone it's
[2:25:03] just a
[2:25:04] shell but i laid my hands on brother way
[2:25:07] prayed for him and the spirit of life he
[2:25:10] said i felt that come back into him
[2:25:13] and in the night service brother way is
[2:25:16] alive
[2:25:17] he's walking he's serving and the
[2:25:19] meetings to follow you'll hear brother
[2:25:21] branham say oh brother way's back there
[2:25:22] god bless you and he gave the testimony
[2:25:25] he lived his life wasn't over they
[2:25:28] they didn't have a funeral service the
[2:25:30] next next saturday god bless what's your
[2:25:32] name brother
[2:25:34] next saturday we're going to have a
[2:25:35] funeral service for our precious brother
[2:25:37] that's
[2:25:38] not the story his heart did not
[2:25:41] end there and
[2:25:44] god had other plans god had a future
[2:25:49] and i wonder today as we close some are
[2:25:51] spiritually dying
[2:25:53] they're dead and the holy spirit's
[2:25:57] trying to breathe life into the matter
[2:25:59] heavenly father
[2:26:04] we come to the close of the service and
[2:26:06] the nurses
[2:26:08] and the doctors are gathering up the
[2:26:10] closing articles lord
[2:26:13] they're sewed up the suture
[2:26:18] we've done our service we've gone some
[2:26:21] now minutes through
[2:26:23] we'll never have the last hour or two of
[2:26:26] our lives
[2:26:27] we've breathed our hearts have pumped
[2:26:29] our minds of thought thoughts our
[2:26:32] emotions that we've had our spirit has
[2:26:35] been moving our body has been
[2:26:37] functioning our souls are
[2:26:40] has just been hearing the word and
[2:26:42] responding
[2:26:44] receiving
[2:26:47] i pray in the name of the lord jesus
[2:26:49] christ
[2:26:50] that you would now take all of our lives
[2:26:56] i know it's a little sobering may be
[2:26:58] quietening
[2:27:00] but as we're wheeled out of the room and
[2:27:02] go
[2:27:03] back into our recovery it might take
[2:27:07] some days or weeks or even months
[2:27:12] we'll always have that as a memory on
[2:27:14] that certain day we
[2:27:16] had a heart procedure
[2:27:20] but i pray as we've given testimony of a
[2:27:22] sister in florida
[2:27:23] sister in south carolina a brother over
[2:27:26] here
[2:27:26] testimony after testimony after
[2:27:29] testimony
[2:27:30] that there would be courage and faith
[2:27:32] rise up in the congregation
[2:27:34] that it's not all over
[2:27:39] i will restore
[2:27:43] saith the lord and after that service
[2:27:46] the brother sent me
[2:27:48] photos of all the post-it notes on the
[2:27:52] mirrors on the doors on the walls in the
[2:27:54] rooms in the bedrooms and the bathrooms
[2:27:57] in the kitchen on the windows
[2:28:00] it was a promise of a mother that was
[2:28:02] crying out
[2:28:04] oh god i want to see life
[2:28:08] i want to see your heart beating in my
[2:28:10] family
[2:28:11] something's wrong it's not the way it
[2:28:14] ought to be god
[2:28:16] there's got to be a message there's got
[2:28:18] to be a word somewhere
[2:28:21] to have that put out there in faith and
[2:28:23] to have you come right behind that after
[2:28:26] weeks and months go by

[2:41:08] you can
[2:41:11] but the lord has just somehow got our
[2:41:13] attention today so you that are
[2:41:15] believers are in the church and it's
[2:41:17] common
[2:41:19] you know how to end the service to you
[2:41:21] that might be a visitor
[2:41:23] it's unusual for you to maybe hear
[2:41:26] the lord speak you wonder why your heart
[2:41:29] has just kind of
[2:41:30] been moved upon that's the moment just
[2:41:33] to say
[2:41:34] whatever's happening i don't know
[2:41:38] but i want more of it you know i don't
[2:41:41] even know that preacher
[2:41:43] i don't even like that preacher and he
[2:41:46] didn't touch me
[2:41:48] he didn't lay hands on me but something
[2:41:50] did
[2:41:52] and what throughout the course of the
[2:41:54] meeting something happened in my heart
[2:41:56] i just want to encourage you that was
[2:41:59] the lord jesus
[2:42:02] that was the holy spirit
[2:42:05] and just learn to say yes
[2:42:08] okay you talk to me like that
[2:42:12] if that is you you come back again
[2:42:15] it's not just an emotion so if you just
[2:42:18] keep feeling that little nudge
[2:42:21] and that little it's the lord putting
[2:42:22] his hand on your life now
[2:42:24] we're we're at the end of the service
[2:42:26] brother steve
[2:42:27] and the nurses are all getting

[2:42:44] matthew brother ander in the past and
[2:42:46] they're walking out and we're closing
[2:42:49] and you got your eyes on them

[2:42:57] it's the great physician that had his
[2:43:00] hands
[2:43:01] on your heart that was doing that so all
[2:43:04] glory be to god
[2:43:06] not the minister just
[2:43:09] as you're just kind of coming to
