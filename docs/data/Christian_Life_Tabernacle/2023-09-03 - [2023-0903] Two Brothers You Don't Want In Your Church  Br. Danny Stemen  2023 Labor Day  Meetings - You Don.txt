gathered in this place Lord the music is playing we're worshiping and lifting your name but lord it's all in preparation for you all of this would be in vain it would just be another religious action

deliverer Lord where everyone has a need of healing Lord You're the Healer Lord these are all attributes of you and we welcome your presence here this morning and we commit this service to you for your perfect will to be done in Jesus name amen you may be seated for those who are visitors we get together and we read a Psalm every Sunday this morning we're going to be reading one that probably Everyone Knows by heart we sing about it we sing the words of it in fact if you were here on Friday night brother Danny even preached from it a bit and it's psalm 34. just a wonderful chapter you know in the verse that just has been kind of on my mind in the last few weeks is well known to us it's verse eight it says o taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him as David says taste and see taste it and see for yourself that he is good you know have you ever tried to get someone to taste something that you think is good you know sometimes you'll have maybe somebody that's adventurous and say sure I'll try it wow that is good maybe it's your favorite dish maybe it's something you try at a restaurant that is just really delicious you know and sometimes you offer a bite to someone and they taste it and they kind of turn up their nose a little bit and go well that's not my thing that's kind of weird and then you've got those that you offered them a bite and they stare at it and they squanch up their nose and like I don't know if I want to try that they haven't tasted it they're kind of afraid to try it they're not sure if they're gonna like it you know you're like but you haven't tasted it yet I don't know if I want to try it and you go through negotiating trying to get this person to taste something that you've experienced that's good but they're not sure if they want to get a bite of that you know it's uh you know how many we think about where we've been this weekend how many of those of us that have been here can say that we've had a taste of him have you tasted him this weekend has he been good you know maybe you were one of those who stared at it for a long time yeah I'm not sure I want to give him a try I'm not sure I'm gonna like him I'm not sure he's going to leave a bad taste in my mouth how many of you can say now that you've tasted and you see that he's good and if you haven't tasted of him yet there's one more service taste and see that the Lord is good you know Peter says in First Peter 2 he says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious have you ever seen a hungry baby you know once they ever get a taste of that milk they cry for it they desire it you'll see them practically cave in the sides of a bottle the moment that they get it put in their hand once you get a real taste of him you just can't get enough you just want to continue to taste and taste and taste and you want more and more you remember the children of Israel when they first left the land of Egypt you know when they first began their journey in the wilderness you know they still had an appetite a taste for the food of Egypt you know and every time they get hungry they'd say boy I I could really use some of that but you know then God gave them a taste of something that came from heaven something that tasted sweet and by the time they got to the promised land nobody was asking for the food of Egypt anymore you know see there had been new births that had happened with this food they had developed an appetite feasting on this heavenly bread you know when we read Psalm 34 what this really is it's a testimony it's a proclamation a declaration of somebody who has tasted yes and seen that the Lord is good and now he's telling about it you know you see you can't encourage somebody to try something if you haven't first tasted of it of yourself if you've tasted him and found him good now you need to offer someone else a taste look at some of these statements that we're going to read here in psalm 34. it says in verse 1 I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth constantly continuously you know the mouth is the source of tasting what's in the mouth is a constant source of praise you know and praise isn't necessarily singing and worshiping in a church service you know David said in Psalm 119 103 how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth you know someone who has developed a taste for him constantly has his word on their lips that's how you praise him that's how you bless him that's how you glorify him by taking his word and constantly putting it on your lips that your his word is constantly in your mouth just like a hungry baby you know the testimony of one who has tasted him is someone who's constantly eating and speaking that word verse two my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad how many of you have ever heard someone boast in silence requires speaking it requires if you've ever been around someone that's boastful you know they're constantly talking about their abilities or the works that they've done or can do to the point where you can hardly stand to be around that individual because it's the only thing that ever comes out of their mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord you know someone who has tasted him is constantly boasting of his works Jeremiah 9 24 but let him the glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that I am the Lord which you exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the Earth for in these things I Delight saith the Lord can you say that you've tasted of the Lord this weekend and found him good well then you should be offering someone else a taste you know David says if you we were going to read through the rest of Psalm 34 everybody is going to hear about him from me he invites those around him verse 3 to participate o magnify the Lord with me with me and let us exalt his name together join me let's Magnify Him together what does he speak of great spiritual Mysteries great deep things of the scriptures no he speaks of what the Lord did for him the taste that he had brother Branham said it this way telling them how your candle got lit David says it this way I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears how many of you have been delivered from Fear this weekend amen thank you you got something to talk about you know Jesus said it this way you are the salt of the earth a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid if you've tasted of him and found him good you should be offering someone else that's right a taste you see he didn't call us to have church sure we have church we worship that's where we come to hear from him but he's called us to be a church not just to gather in church services but to go put his word on our lips to boast of his Works to offer someone a taste of what we've tasted here let's go ahead and stand this morning as we read Psalm 34 together this is the testimony of someone who has tasted and seen that the Lord is good we'll read this together starting in verse one I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul shall make her boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof and be glad o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the Lord in campeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them o taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing Come Ye children hearken unto me I will teach you the fear of the Lord what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate amen amen praise the Lord you may have your seats amen man I trust you're happy to be in the house of God this morning amen we have rain to cool down the heat and we only have one service and the man will pour everything that we

[Music] thank you baby [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] everybody everybody [Music] may God bless you may be seated this morning certainly wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and the purpose of the meeting is you know we call the young people's meeting but you know I'm fixing to go to the greatest young people meeting their ever ones amen everybody will be in their early 20s everybody be looking good it'll be wonderful God's Great you know the the scriptures are probably our greatest friend whether we realize it or not and and uh so it's it's just been a wonderful uh weekend and I did want to thank the deacons for all that they've done and the musicians and and of course you because it wouldn't be a meeting without you you know preachers can have a meeting because they all do the talking you know they don't they they listen only to respond and so it comes to Great Heights but when you have people that are feasting on God's word that's great that God can give you something that you can take personally and and that's wonderful so we certainly uh thank you for all coming and then I I like your prayers we'll be in Phoenix Arizona this coming weekend to do some Banquets and and have service there in in Phoenix with brother Ron so please keep us in prayer but you know I wanted to leave a little something with uh young people today and and uh and if you have your Bibles and you would turn over to the Psalm 119 and the ninth verse and before we read this I'd like to say that the baptismal pools open for anybody who wants to be baptized and if you'd like us to lay hands on you that if you want to receive the Holy Ghost and you'd like us to lay hands on you that you might receive the Holy Ghost we'd be happy to do that after service today is you just want to come and say you know I'd like to have you lay hands on me that I would receive the Holy Ghost certainly God will do that but there's a great question asking or maybe Mike you could put that Psalms 119 verse 9. you say brother McGarry we want to get to the word well we have a formula here that the preacher has to preach longer than the song service so we're we're certainly wanting to add up his minutes here but listen to this great question wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his ways and that goes for young women wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his ways now listen to the answer in the next few verses by taking heed there too according to Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee o let me not Wander from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee blessed art out O Lord teach me thy statutes with my lips have I declared all thy judgments of thy mouth I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches I have meditated in the precepts and have respect unto thy ways I will Delight myself in thy statutes I will not forget Thy word if I could leave that with each of you young people as you would go in the meeting comes to an end that's a great secret if you'd take that out every now and then and read it make that a commitment in your heart Lord I will not leave your ways I'll meditate on them I'll declare your riches and your testimonies and I know if you do those things you'll be successful our heart's desire is that when you leave these meetings that you've received something that you can take with you not more but something that will become a rock and a something in your life that will ever continue to grow and guide you down life's path and so that's our great heart's desire for you that when we leave here we leave with something that has now become our possession the fellowship's been wonderful and the preaching has been outstanding we certainly appreciate it brother Danny but the most important thing is for you to leave with something a momentum something in your heart that you know you've been touched by God so I just want you to know that's my heart's desire for each of you life's Journeys long I never thought that I would be here I was converted pre 77. and in one way I'm glad he's hadn't come because I'd have never known all the riches of his mercy and His glory the power of His might and how little I knew and how great he's unfolding himself and and I believe there's so much more for us don't you amen so as we turn the service to the word let us Stand Together I'd like to sing that song the great emancipator you know emancipated means to be set free to be free from obligations or burdens you know when I looked up the great emancipator and what came up as Abraham Lincoln I said oh you poor soul [Music] hey man I know an angel emancipator that can do a whole lot more than Abraham Lincoln could ever did hey man I'm talking about one that emancipate you set you free relieved you from all burden amen didn't this our song as we prepare for brother Danny come oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] breakfast [Music] yes [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] enough [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] about the song of the redeemed that's our song many men believe you've been redeemed praise the name of the Lord so wonderful to be here once again in the house of the Lord and to be a part of these meetings and we want to greet you I understand that you're full all the way to the back and I can't see you back there but hello I hope you see my hand waving so may God bless each and every one of you for coming it's a real privilege to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ we don't ever want to take lightly amen what God has called us to amen we certainly have enjoyed ourselves being here with you and and we want to say that we love you with the love of the Lord and how how welcome that you have made us feel and so we want to say God bless you for that and certainly wonderful people to preach to and your love for the word amen I just would encourage you just keep on going and amen we appreciate Brother David thank you brother David and sister Leslie for the invitation and how you've treated us amen and and brother Matthew and sister Gabrielle for all their work for the Youth and all they're doing and all the the workers the deacons the ministers I just think it's a credit Amen to the word of God unto you understand so may God bless you and ask your prayers for us amen as we go home amen and pray for our church back there amen we're all in the same battle we're all fighting the same enemy amen and You Know The Enemy likes to isolate us and try to think we're all alone and and you're the first one to ever face what you face but he's lying to you and so we trust that the word has been encouragement for you and as our brother said that when you leave here you don't leave with nothing but you take something home with you so may God bless you let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer a gracious Heavenly Father we love you this morning we thank you for this opportunity to come together like this once again we thank you for the services that we've had we thank you for this one Lord all the songs that have been sung and prepared our hearts for the word of God we ask you Lord that you would move in a special way through your word to every need that is here Lord I pray that you would anoint my lips anoint the ears of the ear and we'll ask these things that For Your Glory and your honor in Jesus name amen amen I'd ask you to turn in your bibles if you will to the book of Nehemiah and and we're turned to the second chapter in Nehemiah I want to read something brother Brandon said in a message he preached called The Church of the Living God and he's speaking he's looking to a man in the back and he's telling the people to have faith and he calls a man out he says you're looking at me strangely you with a tie on and you've been praying and I see you kneel in a room and you prayed that if you could ever get near him that you would be healed he said you suffer with a kidney trouble isn't that true he said Jesus Christ makes you whole my brother stand to your feet he said now there goes that spirit to Blackness leaving that man you can watch it it's got a sympathizing partner and there it falls over a man sitting there with a t-shirt on a black-headed man his hands in his face is it's what it says his hands in his face stand up young man you suffer with kidney stones except your Jesus Christ as your healing and I I just I read that to uh emphasize the part that he says you have a sympathizing it has a sympathizing partner and I want to preach a message this morning it's going to be a strange title and if you don't remember anything maybe you remember that and that is two brothers you don't want in your church and you can add that if you want just to now Brothers we're not wrestling with flesh and blood all right well you ignore that amen all right let's look at the fifth verse thank you brother David for that the fifth verse chapter 2 we're going to read to the end of the chapter and I said to the king if it pleased the king and If thy servant have found favor in thy sight that you would send me unto Judah unto the city of my father's sepulchers that I may build it and the King said unto me the queen also sitting by him or how long shall I journey be and when will you return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come into Judah in a letter under ASAP The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may give me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of of my God upon me and I came to the governor's beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me and when some ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so I came to Jerusalem and I was there three days and I arose in the night I had some men with me and neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any Beast with me save the Beast I rode upon and I went out by Night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well into the dung port and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went on to the gate of the fountain into the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass and I went up by Night by the Brook and I viewed the wall and turned back and I entered by the gate of the valley and I returned and the rulers knew not whether I went or what I did neither had I told the Jews yet nor to the priests nor the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work then said I unto them you see the distress we're in how Jerusalem life waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more reproach then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me and also the words of the king that he'd spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work but when symbolic to horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite and guess him the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despise us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we as servants will arise and build but you have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem you can be seated may the Lord bless the Eden of his word something that the word we always give you the right things to say according to the need and this era that I'm I'm looking at here is an era of time of the last restoration that is in the Old Testament the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and Esther are all describing the same era in history and also the prophetical books of haggai Zechariah in Malachi being the last he was the last book of Prophecy and he was in the time of Nehemiah the previous prophets of the Babylonian captivity were Jeremiah who he was eventually with the remnant in Egypt and then Ezekiel who was with a Remnant in one part of Babylon and then also Daniel who was in the courts of Babylon the book of Jeremiah of Nehemiah rather is describing the hour of Revelation and restoration that God was giving to his people according to his promise that after 70 years of of captivity through the the Babylonians and then the Persians that they would return and they would return back to the city of God the city that David had wrote about and said glorious things are spoken of the whole city of God Amen and he said David wrote about the walls and Isaiah wrote about the walls let the walls be walls of Salvation in the gates of Praise amen and let the walls be built amen the walls of Salvation so the mind of God and this is the hour we're living in is the mind of restoration amen but the restoration cannot be just a quote it has to be a burden and that burden has to be transferred it cannot just be in one man amen but it has to be transferred to the people because messages of restoration can be preached over and over and over amen but amen the people unless they catch the burden of restoration amen they will just sit there and try to absorb and you'll go back out into Dallas and you'll go back out unto your places and you'll go right back to the same thing and be satisfied with the with what's around you but I want you to know the coming of Nehemiah is a declaration of war upon the status quo that God is not satisfied amen for you to live in a certain place and act a certain way but there must be restoration according to the word that he has given blessed be the name of the Lord now the word can get a little uncomfortable all right now I would encourage you when the word gets uncomfortable that when it when it but it's if it's speaking of a situation of yours just squeak out an amen let's oil that place that hinge that that doesn't like that area you know because I found out with people when they're they're they're amen and they're they're they're screaming real loud A lot of times they're doing it over someone else's condition who am I amen but but they when it comes to them so we're speaking about two brothers don't look around and don't listen to Brother David Hallelujah Jesus when he was on the road dumaeus and he's speaking to these men and they don't know who he is the Bible says he began at Moses because he told him he said oh fools and slow of Hearts you believe all that the prophets have spoken and he began at Moses and the prophets had began to expound amen and what he was doing is he was revealing himself through the whole scripture and showing this was me this was what was happening was revealing me this is what they said would happen and this was me being revealed now this is the same in Nehemiah this is Christ this is his burden this is not about Nehemiah this is his burden and and when when a man comes and he comes to a condition that is there and he's heard about it because he'd asked questions he said how is the state of Jerusalem they said well you know it's it's there's a lot of there's a rubble the walls are broken down the Gates cannot be used the building of the temple has started amen but the walls and and the glory of Jerusalem there's so much waste and things that need to be done and the people are living there and they're satisfied in that condition and he said his heart was grieved and he becomes sad because amen that was the condition of the city of God Amen and and so he comes into the presence of the King of Persia and he's sad he's the king's cup Bearer now if you read what it was like in in in the king's court you could not be sad in the king's presence if you were sat in his presence it was at the threat of death amen so he was taking a great risk to to show his countenance to the king but the countenance amen provoked a response why why are you sad in my presence and he said how can I not be sad when when the city of the holy city is is in this condition and and this these things need to be done and and the King amen entered into that burden because you know he can do nothing without the permission of the king so he requests amen the king says okay what time is this going to happen and how long is it going to take now if you read the book of Nehemiah you'll find out this was one of the outstanding miracles of the of the of the word one of the outstanding Miracles it only took 52 weeks to get the work done but it laid there far longer in a condition that was unrepaired not dealt with content to live by and they let it sit there but when God began to work in the burden of his word it was a quick work that brought a restoration and I believe God is interested in restoration he's interested in healing he's interested in Deliverance But ultimately he's interested in his word being fulfilled and he is fulfilling his word by bringing to himself those that he has brought to this age and in those people amen is the interpretation of what God is doing in this hour every life listen you just go ahead and bear with me just like my church does at home they bear with me amen we got to get Beyond amen churches it's about people it's about the body of Christ it's not about this church is better than that church and this church over here has this talent and you know every church is different amen I thank God for what he's given given me in in our work back there and I know you thank God for for what God has given you here but you know if we start looking around we'll be nothing we'll just be like the book of Corinthians amen where they have their favorite preachers and who do you say you're of well I'm of Paul and I'm of Apollos and I'm of this one and he said but are we not all amen called by the same God he said I I planted Apollos water but it's God they giveth the increase so this work God is doing is not man's work it is God's work Hallelujah and and you need to get beyond the comparisons because this is not about churches this is not amen this is not Treasures in Earthen churches it's treasures and Earth and vessels if you ain't going to say man you're going to sit and look at me then I'm going to preach that longer you know one way to get a preacher to move on and say amen I believe that amen you God wants to do something in your life you don't want you to assimilate into a church and be nothing he doesn't give you the Holy Ghost to raise your hand and say I got it he gives you the Holy Ghost to put you into service and that service doesn't have to be very long it could be for one purpose you understand the Great Men of the word John the Baptist six months on the Earth with a Ministry six months of Ministry Jesus Christ the greatest man that ever struck the face of the Earth amen God never even talked about all of his silent years he never even wrote down how great a carpenter he was amen his work began in his ministry God has something for you to do in the Holy Ghost it's a service it might be a testimony out on the street somewhere it might be a testimony in your home but you can't do it until you get rid of those two men we'll talk about them amen so Nehemiah was asked how long is it going to take and Nehemiah said he gave it time I'm going to go at this certain time and the King says I'll give you this time and he wrote letters and they sealed the letters with his seal now God has a set time of restoration Satan is as a type of hindering spirit that he wants you to wait I always wants you to wait here delay you and the reason he delays you is because he knows in the delay you lose your zeal so you'll see with the story of Nehemiah that Satan uses opposition to place discouraging thoughts and news in the minds of Nehemiah and the people but I want you to notice nehemiah's position and his attitude toward them and may this become your position he tells him you have no portion you have that means you have no real estate here you have no portion of Jerusalem this means you have no real estate here it's not your property in other words you're a squatter it's not your property says you have no right legally they have no place to stand so they may be squatters with takeover intentions and whatever they join now whatever they enjoy now it is illegal they have no Memorial which means they have no power of testimony they have no pedigree that connects them to this place and Nehemiah lets them know that your Authority is only perceived it's not real he's talking to some ballot and tobiah and he's telling them your your Authority is is only perceived and it's only perceived that way is because these people have let you be that way it's not real he lets them know that he understands and discerns their motives and I and he says I'll withstand you so our attitude must be one of understanding the need and also the Warfare of the enemy you know many times people will come for prayer and they're they're talking about the wars in their minds and their talk about these things but you must understand those Wars of the Mind are normal procedure in the life of a Christian every one of these ministers have wars in the mind this was the the agreed meeting place between God and Satan where God would put his thoughts and Satan would put his and you would decide which one are you going to believe amen but I'll tell you as a Believer I mean you let the thoughts of God penetrate and drop from your mind into your heart amen and when it leaves your mind and comes into your heart it's a strength against what the enemy is trying to tell you the enemy's going to tell you you didn't receive anything he's going to tell you amen what you can't base it upon this or you can't base it upon that but I want to tell you I want you to base it upon what the prophet said you know he said that Satan can impersonate any gift he can impersonate any gift but what he cannot be is the Holy Ghost I want to say it again he can impersonate any gift but he cannot be the Holy Ghost he said I feel it in your mind the message desperations I feel it in your mind you say how will I know he said no certain evidence he said but what were you and what are you what did the word do to you that's right amen now Nehemiah can ask the same questions now you have returned you have left uh amen you've left the captive country and you return back into your Homeland why is there Rubble around your home why is it when I come through with my my Beast I can I can hardly find places to move why are these things left unattended to now nobody knew his burden but he had come to seek the welfare of his people and this is this is the motive of every meeting this is why we're here this weekend this is why God has a pastor here a church here this is why God moves it's why he sent a prophet it's why he's done it in every age it's why the Holy Spirit Comes This is why he's in his church amen is because he is seeking the welfare of his children Hallelujah amen and so now brother Branham said that if not I know that he said that we preach longer preach longer than the singing twice as long Lord I don't want to do that amen but I'll start my watch now amen oh he certainly enjoyed all the singing you know I'm glad they can sing as well as me Amen brother Jeremy can really sing can he you know he was back there brother Dave is back there I don't know if I'm supposed to say this I'm gonna say it anyhow he's back there dancing he's singing amen he's a good dancer but I started my singing career the same time he did I want you to know him amen where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy in the morning start sang together may not sing as good here but I sing good there amen amen so now you feel a little loose all right brother Branham said that if Satan can make you think amen that your weapon is on the same level as as Satan's and your weapon is what it is the words amen and if he can make you think now now maybe this will offends somebody I don't know but I want you to know what I'm holding in my hand is Malachi 4 brother Branham it is his absolute the Bible is brother branham's absolute I mean I know we want to be Mormons and make another Bible but this is the Bible the message is the revealed words it was not revealing any other book it was revealing this book it's not good enough for me to have a birth certificate in a hospital but if I can find myself in here the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it and I want you to know I can identify myself in the word amen so now Satan can make you think at this word is just as strong maybe not even as strong as your nerves as your conceptions as your walk oh it's not as strong as your marriage problems you won't use it and as soon as you lay it down you have lost this is how you're going to defeat him but he's here in the spirit of restoration as long as you settle for the defeat of a discouraged mind and you settle for that depression and not let the power of the word go to Every child listen I don't say you don't deal with those things I don't say you don't suffer ministers go through those things and and and you go through them but you don't go through them defeat it because when you come into these things you should search the word begin to pull from the word amen the Brother David read the scripture how shall a young man cleanse his way well this is how this is how your marriages are are built back this is how amen your sons and daughters come back this is how you heal through his words he said I sent my word and I healed their disease I know people say when we say the word you're thinking of the letter and all he says the words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen and we're here amen you you cannot rest amen you cannot judge anything by your emotion you must judge it by the words because your emotion will tell you you're saved and your emotion will tell you you're lost amen but the word will not change its mind amen the word said I knew you and then therefore I redeemed you I mean it'll give you a place to stand hey I'm like anybody else I love emotion but emotion will blind me emotion will lie to me right right yes yes it will my emotions lying to me right now says I'm tired amen as long as you settle for that defeat and not let the power of the word go to every channel clean it out Satan has defeated you he's defeated your purpose he's defeated your zeal you've LED you've laid your weapon down now I read that scripture in Nehemiah the 12th verse I Rose in the night and men were some men with me a few men none of them knew what I was doing I said but I went out there knew a man knew what God had put in my heart but neither was there any Beast with me say the one I wrote on and I went out by night I want you to know this man is riding through a ruined destroyed City and he's looking at all the mess but he's not there to advertise the mess he's there to investigate what he's going to restore so he'll go through the life and you'll go thoroughly because before there can be restoration you must see what has been ruined come on Church you must see what has been ruined the devil would like you to stay in confusion and just see piles of rubbish let me tell you we're all we're all in a carnal body and if we just start looking for Flaws you're going to find them I'll tell you you can look at my life you can find flaws you can find flaws in anybody here and I can sure find flaws on anybody there and if you start capitalizing on the flaws of somebody else that is not the spirit of restoration that's one of those brothers that need to be kicked out of the congregation amen and so now you cannot rebuild what you don't know has been destroyed many people instead of trying to rebuild and restore they ignore or you raise your hand and praise your hand praise the Lord anyhow but that doesn't restore it you got to deal with it rubbish too much junk will cause you to say it's too hard too much garbage will cause you to say there's no use but the burden of restoration rides through this rubbish and he wants to take inventory not to accuse you for the accuser of the Brethren's already done that but he is thorough and he is complete he does not build on a pile of rubbish I said again he will not build on a pile of rubbish you can leave an area you can try to do whatever you want to get away from rubbish but if it has not been cleaned up and restored that rubbish is still there but when he's done the rubbish is gone brother Branham said all the acts of the Believers have been in type showing what God's great plan is what he what he wants to do and what he had in his mind from before the foundation of the world we would not know these things unless God wanted to reveal them you will not know what God does not want you to know but when he reveals something amen he wants you to know it right and this is the hour he set notice the king asked what time how long and I set the time so there's a set time of restoration of his word this is the hour that he wanted to reveal himself now the hour is not guessed upon the hour is announced and when Nehemiah got to Jerusalem he announced why he was there we are here to build what has been destroyed that set the time amen not to the world but to them who would believe on him through their words notice Jesus said that the word would be given and in every age and in every message God is sending a man to seek the welfare of his children amen and even more than the agency of man who God uses in every generation still using today but the person of Jesus Christ is here to seek the welfare of his people he calls Israel the apple of my eye the apple of my eye is the aperture through which you see and he's saying Israel is my people and is through Israel how the people will see God so God with Destin a people to be the aperture through which amen the world would know who God is all right come on Church there's a way that God has designed for the World to See Jesus Christ and that is through his people not through how well a person can preach not through how many tapes you listen to amen but through your life that has been redeemed amen do you know what it does to someone lost in sin when another man can stand up and say I've been delivered of the same thing oh that sympathizing partner begins to tremble because he knows the hour of restoration is called oh I said I wouldn't yell Amen Brother David healing the power of the river I need it amen so we want to get the sense you love the Lord okay that was weak do you love the Lord that's better so we want to get the better sense of what God is doing also realize those events are tied to our time that restoration is tied to this restoration the Bible's not called the Bible it's called The Holy Bible because it's the word of God so even though it's a history primarily it's the history of of election amen you find out the Bible brother Brown says it's a history it's a love story it's a prophecy amen it's all of these things amen it's his love letter to his bride now thing with God is he never Cuts corners amen he don't hide from the reader the wickedness of his own people you know often a history book is sympathetic toward its own people in its own culture and we got it we got all kinds of of different countries represented here and and you know and and if you are are are are you know wanting to tell me about your country many times you just tell me the good things you know I could do the same thing well this is a wonderful wonderful country it's country of Abraham Lincoln you know right and the great emancipator and uh it's a country of what George Washington and it's a country of freedom and it's a country of this in the country of that and and then but you know there's a lot of Dark Places in every country and God doesn't hide it and the reason he doesn't hide it is he's not gossiping amen but he's telling you about these dark places in order for you to be able to see the depth and the mercy and the grace of God that goes to every dark place and when he's done there is light there and not Darkness ask David about it when he committed adultery and and killed a man in order to keep his secret and and how it brought a civil war into Israel and how he lost four of his own Sons God never hid it from him and when he was so blinded that hood of death is over him and the prophet Nathan steps out and says listen we have a situation in Israel a rich man to has many lambs and he and he wanted a feast so he went to a poor man who had only one lamb and he took that lamb and he and he slaughtered it and and he used it for the feast and and he said him while Nathan's telling that story oh man David's getting mad he goes who would dare do that in my kingdom and you know many times that's the way people hear a message preached they're applying it to somebody else in the kingdom when God is actually talking to you he's talking to you don't amen for somebody else amen for yourself thank you amen for somebody else you're only adding to the pile of garbage but if you aim in for yourself something's starting to get clean so be it Lord so be it Lord clean me out Lord amen your work can do something I cannot do I've tried to let go of grudges I tried to let go of bitterness I tried to let go of talking about Ministry and talking about somebody else and I haven't been able to stop help me Lord it's affected my family it's affected my children help me Lord you amen for somebody else it isn't going to work amen David said that man should die as soon as he uttered that amen the eyes of of Nathan narrowed down and Grace stepped in and says you'll not die David you're the man how long does it take for us to realize in a sermon that God is talking to me got too much pride we ought to think we're more spiritual than anybody else big eyes are little use come on there ain't no generals and privates we're all the body of Christ [Applause] yes Sons and Daughters of God saved by the grace of God how dare we belittle God the youngest person in here he can raise up is a mighty testimony look through the Bible it was many young people that God raised up in spite of their family young men young women taken out of barren conditions taken into captivity they still could testify God used it for his glory to show he's the same yesterday today and forever she's interested in restoration amen say something about restoration it does not ignore the facts restoration does not bypass the word in order to restore restoration is not ignoring the word rather it is the word restoration is not Grace made disgrace but restoration used Grace as the means to build it's the energy of the Holy Ghost that God gives to rebuild is Grace restoration does not build on a hidden condition because of it did it would weaken the restoration but restoration brings the life back to the word condition that's highlighted in Ezra Nehemiah when we see those that had intermingled with idolatrous Nations and marriage they either rejected those marriages or are cast out it was a type that you cannot bring idols cannot bring Idols into your relationship with the Lord as long as you allow something to exist in you that causes a question in your walk with the Lord you're living in a weakened condition your service will remain polluted coming into Christ is a walk with God where there's no condemnation young people I want to encourage you to walk with God is there is no therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the spirit is saying another thing in the flesh is saying come on amen as if we have seen this restoration here Nehemiah Daniel prophesied of it and said it would take place in Troublesome times troubles times this restoration would take place not a time of Peace but a time of trouble amen times of peril the meaning of troubleless times mean it would be pushed into a tight place it'd be anguish it would be primarily with the meaning of pressure and emotional and spiritual pressure and he said I'll build thy walls and those kinds of time here we are in the same kind of time men are lovers of their self amen amen perilous time Paul calls it they love themselves they follow their own opinions and not the word men are anointed with the spirit of the Destroyer upon them and a man without the Holy Ghost will be destructive in his home and in his church it's all kinds of time all kinds of time a time when Zeal has been pushed out and the wrong kind of Zeals on display the Zeal to repent leaves in the Zeal for pleasure remains love is a pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof well what does that mean it doesn't mean they don't know that God is is powerful it means they don't they deny the power of God to work saying you believe something with no power to live what you believe that's the condition of this age I want you to notice this is also the condition when God comes to restore the captives back to their land God is determined to build the temple rebuild it he's determined to rebuild Jerusalem he was determined to rebuild the walls but the cities and ruins amen and if there's a condition that needs to be restored God's going to send somebody with a burden that it'll be restored if there's a condition in this church that needs restoration God is going to bring a message he's going to bring somebody across he's going to do something to restore your life because that's the God I serve it's a city in Ruins when Nehemiah comes it's nothing but Rubble the precious meanings that every gate has been for the most part broken down and burnt by fire if it's broken and not be used if something's broken you won't have no confidence in it you won't use it we first get a glimpse of this opposition when Nehemiah comes from the shoeshine the palace with the burden of restoration now he's already been given the message of restoration the king's word that's been spoken unto him the message Nehemiah has hidden his heart the burden of God he saw the mess he saw all the destruction and he's determined to build when he comes there the Bible tells us there's these two men we hear that they're not happy with the coming of this man and one of them his name is symbolic he's nehemiah's main political opponent he's from the city of called horanime which is the horanite which is a place in Moab and then also we also find tobiah the Bible says he is from Ammon so these are the two brothers you don't want in your church but these men have been there at Jerusalem and in that area all this time while this garbage is there and they've not we don't hear a word from them until a message of restoration begins to come and the reason it begins to come is because a man is coming to seek the welfare of his children you know the devil don't get stirred up amen if we don't do nothing about the mess he'll just lay there and hear enjoy you raising your hands and saying amen listening to a tape but if there's nothing applied and nothing done he won't say a word you let the message of restoration start coming all them old grievances begin to rise up all the bitterness begins to rise up why because God is determined you go ahead and sleep on me if you want I want to tell you something there are some devils in here that God wants to clean out of your life these men that have laid there for Jennifer for years and affected your family and why is it that right by your house is the walls broken down and you've done nothing about it but the enemy can laugh at you and say oh you say you believe an end-time message why haven't you deal with this anger why haven't you asked forgiveness why haven't you gone to me this rights have you repented of your gossip well this is a good last message to preach before I'm gone I leave tomorrow at 10 if you want to be at the airport sell me off Hallelujah need to go back home and preach it so they're looking at me the same way preach me happy brother Danny I want to preach you amen about a message of restoration not interested in making you happy I'd rather see people work amen and to get the restoration of God through their lives you have to keep coming back for the same thing over and over for when God gets done with you it is a glorious city of Zion [Applause] you ever looked at these two men some ballot and tobiah have you met him you know what I like about the Bible is when it comes to Spirits God very rarely decides describes well he's got big eyes and a crooked nose and he's six foot tall and he doesn't do that he says what they sound like because every generation their change their appearance but their sound doesn't change so now we find out that when Nehemiah comes it provokes a response from these men that are there you read this story it blows your mind what is going on but if you read about tobiah he's an ammonite and if you read about symbolic he is a moabite now the Bible says about these two men in the book of Deuteronomy um it says this and I'll just read it to you in anime ammonite or a moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th Generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when you came out of Egypt and because they hired against you Balaam the son of bior of the pathor of Mesopotamia to curse you nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the Lord thy God has loved thee you shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all the days forever he's a two men you don't want in your congregation but were they they were men that they were tribes that blocked and hindered the the Journey of the chosen people of God they were men that hired people to find flaws in the church to look upon their back parts and put it on the internet they they wanted to talk about the failures to prove that God wasn't there because if I can find failures in the Church of surely God will curse them well I'll tell you there's not one Church in the world and I don't care what kind of church it is you're going to find flaws in everything because this is not about man this is about God the prophet of God says amen they they looked upon them they they were hired to curse them he said well what they did not see amen the prophet was there amen the shadow of the King was in the camp amen the the Brazen altar was there amen I want to tell you when people look upon the flaws they're ignoring the grace amen so these are opponents well you know where these two men started these tribes started their Origins started in a cave a dark place they come from the darkness of a cave they were begotten from a drunken lot with his two daughters this is the last we hear of lot in the Old Testament is he dies we don't hear of him anymore this is his last place and this is what comes out of that it was a man that refused to go all the way with the message it was a man that refused to hear what the word was saying to Abraham it was a man amen that chose the better things of life he thought than to stay with the word and out of this comes these two tribes a spirit that won't go all the way spirit that when the angel says go to the mountain or go to this place they said oh that's too far let me go over here please changing what the word says when the word says go here you say no that's just too much this is where these men came from hindering you can trace them all through the Bible these spirits that God said don't have anything to do with them and don't seek their prosperity because they're trying to stop you from doing what I want Hallelujah amen but when Nehemiah comes amen let me just say this opposition in the work for the Lord is often the proof I know I'm not making you too happy yet that's okay and say when opposition comes it's the proof that God is doing something can I just be me in the power of Resurrection you know my father passed away in 2009 I and and they elected me as pastor of the church you know often you hear well you're not your dad now how do I respond to that uh uh I'm not what they really want to say is you don't do things like him right but we're all different and God oversees it and when opposition begins to come it's because God is doing something and people aren't patient with what God is doing and they don't allow God to work they'd rather try to build on grievances to give an excuse for their current condition instead of let God Amen restore that'll make you fold your arms and stare at me let me tell you something you don't know what it's like to be me but that's why we have a God who comes in the spirit of restoration if you would let him get in the middle of it so when when and this isn't for you young people to understand you got to look bigger than three days in a weekend that we've just had for you to make a stand for the word of God is a living declaration it's a living declaration that the work of God is in process and that will stir your enemy up these two brothers that might have laid dormant for a long time but when the spirit of God begins to expose them they'll start becoming against you now Nehemiah there's not one battle fought in it not one physical battle it's all about the thought of battle and the fear of battle and the threat of battle and the LIE of battle but there's an uh actually a sword ever drawn and somebody run through because these men don't have the power that it can only talk it's something that the enemies want to keep Jerusalem in misery something that the enemies of Jerusalem and the people that live there are living together and they're not harassing the people isn't that amazing they're not harassing them because the people are no threat to him all the time they live there they're content to live with the situation they're in they're content to live with how they are right and so the enemy doesn't get stirred up amen that's to his taste he likes it you come to church Hallelujah that's wonderful can I go with you make room for me on the Pew next time I said I'll remind you everything's gonna be okay you know he loves he loves to see people in a deceived state of mind that they can sit in the same condition and receive a blessing and not change but if you read the Bible it's all about change from glory to glory to glory to glory going into the Realms of God why do you think he gives you why do you think he gives you a hunger and a thirst amen oh you say well I did this for God and I've done that he answered my prayer here he did this there God's more than that you know what God does is he he speaks his word and when he speaks his word he gives you something to see Jeremiah what do you see I see an almond branch amen amen before you see it say it you had to see it God had to show you amen amen it may not be something anybody else sees but it's what God showed you you may be sick here this morning but if God shows you a well body they've been standing out before you you say what do you see there I see a well back amen and I walk toward that path I walk toward that well person Jesus Christ stands right behind what I see calling to me you got to see it God wants you to see it the people living in a room sitting they don't see its former glory they don't see its future Glory they only settle for for for uh the the misery that's there amen but when Nehemiah comes it's a declaration of war against the prevailing condition that appears before him amen Satan doesn't worry about the church in general it's those who dedicate themselves to the Lord dedicate to do his work for the benefit of the church see we look for the church that pleases us when you're actually supposed to be in the church to help it right my smile is fake it's true because we're supposed to let God work through us Hallelujah now what they didn't understand these people sitting there in this ruined conditions had the quotes they had heard about it now they maybe couldn't read and maybe they didn't have the physical book but they knew about it they knew they were the Seed of Abraham they knew they were in line for blessing they knew they had inheritance they knew that God had said your seed shall possess the gates of their enemies but their own gates are destroyed and their walls are destroyed they're not doing anything about it right you know when we see needs in the church it ought to set us to pray yeah it ought to set us to intercede for one another amen amen when somebody starts just talking about it instead of praying about it that is not the solution that's the brothers that need to be cast out amen but now here comes Nehemiah and he's riding down the road and they're like you don't have no authorization to be here amen do you know when they they tried to build the temple and and we told them they don't have no right to build the temple now you understand the temple was already built they did build it but but the threats of the people against the building of the temple caused them to stop building it for 19 years and they re they didn't build because of the threats they didn't think we're allowed to build the temple but God built their Temple of worship back and then he wants the walls restored and so now and you know what's interesting if you go back and study that time in the time of Ezra he's trying to get them to build the temple and God God says these people need to be stirred up by a prophet's message so he sends him not one Prophet but two prophets and I'm sure if they're like us we'd all had our favorites you ever looked at them Zechariah and haggai haggai Zechariah Zechariah was the man having visions he's always in heaven and he was the young man so it might have been kind of dynamic we don't we'd like that guy wouldn't we we like him had you I was the old guy you're welcome he was the old guy and he didn't have the dynamic personality that Zechariah did Zechariah behold I see 12 horses in the trees I saw heaven I saw the Throne of God and I saw amen this high priest in dirty clothes standing there before the people going oh my whoo Zechariah can I have your tape and then over there's had you I said hey guys hey hey hey you want a house to be built get up there on the mountain and cut some wood man I'm going to zachariah's church now the problem of it is they both went to the same church and they never fought with one another Zechariah didn't look at Hagia I said buddy why don't you have more Visions man move Beyond chopping wood and measuring stuff man that ought to make you feel good brother David he he was a contractor he built churches this is good I'm the only one having a good time here he built churches you know he's like he's telling that if you want you built your own house now go build the house of God you want to do something about it go cut some wood into people like uh-huh then Zachariah goes yeah I say unto you Glory well I love Zechariah he's young he's Dynamic and can I have your tape haggy eyes a few years behind what we find in the Bible God sent him that way to work together because both of them met the need of the people if you had only a Zechariah the people would be walking up here and ignoring everything but you needed a haggy eye down here to say I saw what was in your closet well Hallelujah anyhow amen glory to God two more hours of this man what do we do hey I'm just starting to feel good been a long time amen Here Comes Nehemiah said no I'm coming and I'm coming you know I love your churches I love what you're doing I love hearing you sing I love hearing your praise but man I look around your houses and there's these walls all tore down and don't you know God wants these walls to be there he wants some built up walls of salvation laws that tell the enemy you can't go no further you can't have my children don't you know these are Gates of Praise they're not supposed to be broken down why aren't the walls build up why are you only going to church well Nehemiah you don't have no right to preach like that and the King he does he know what you're saying oh I got news for you there's been a sealed book given to me amen it's the king's message and the King's message says give them the wood from the time restore oh my they thought they knew the message but they didn't know that there was a sealed letter from the King authenticated not by Nehemiah but by the king seal this message amen was not so a sealed by wmb it was sealed amen by the king himself and opened up in our hour to realize this is the hour of restoration no matter how impure no matter how beat down the Holy Ghost calls and says give it back now it's time for your families now it's a time for the restoration of your children now is the time to right the wrongs of the past to not live in a condition for 20 to 30 years and praise the Lord and ignore what's going on behind you Meanwhile your children are starting to death because of the spiritual famine in your life don't teach them to deceive my bro my my sons come to me and they told me I'm struggling with something I didn't sit there and rebuke him for being in a struggle I took them and I put my arm around them and I let them know how much I loved them then I knelt with them before God and I told God how much I loved them and how much he loved them and how God done work in me and I know you do the work in them I let them know there's somebody come on church I did not commit them to the cycle of death they had started with me amen but I broke the cycle by using what the king seal had authorized me to do I have been authorized Amen to restore oh Lord I'm finding out that people are more interested in how they seem before the people than actually writing a condition I dealt with a condition one time is a long time ago and I pray the Lord that they don't see this amen but it was counseling you know and I had a couple there that couldn't get along you ever had people like that marriage you know they couldn't get along well don't look at him I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that to you okay I did and they couldn't get along and he was angry with one another they wouldn't talk to me now I found out a lot of times in counseling that people just want to pour out their grievances upon me and then they'll feel better they don't change they just want somebody else to know my walls are broken down and I want to be haggy I hey get the shovel clean it up well I had this couple Brother David and um and and they couldn't get along and they fought and they couldn't get along and so apartment in the office and and we sat down and they were and they they couldn't even look at one another and so they they I sat here in front of them and then they sat like this back to back and looked at me that's not a happy marriage if you can't even look at one another so the man starts telling me about the condition and how how she is she got this problem she's got that problem she got this problem about that problem okay yeah now what are you saying she's like he's got this problem he's got that problem he's got that problem you got this and you got all this but ain't nothing happening it ain't gonna build Walls by rearranging junk well let me carry this pile of garbage and just put it over here specifically I put it on his lap his lap that never fixes anything you know this went on for a while you know let them let them say how much they hate each other or hate being around each other whatever I finally got you know a little I hate to say it aggravated and I said now listen all I have heard out of you is how much you don't of each other's faults I said you're never accomplish anything by saying what's wrong with the other that's right I said I want you to do something I said you can't even look at one another turn and face one another and hold each other's hands it took a while took a while to get there is like and then take the hands and it was you know after you have talked so bad about somebody how hard it is to look them in the eye you know your body you sing too good oh makes me mad I'm tired of these kind of preachers just oohs Talent why do I have to deal with guys like that right now turn and look at him I'm like take my hands come on buddy now say what you like about him oh come on you know how hard it is to do that after you have just said what you don't like because I knew if you can change the attitude that restoration can start happening it took a long time Brother David for that man to say something but he finally did and it started out real small and real insignificant it was yes sir that's what I wanted to do hey Hallelujah you know what that brother said he looked at her finally after I kept encouraging I'll just say something good about her I mean there's a lot of things that said that was wrong brother and sister but finally he looked at her and said she makes good cookies you know you know it may have to start with cookies but God can restore off chocolate chip [Music] hey God can do things you don't think he can do and when a man finally said she makes good cookies she looked at him and she just turned the metals I do you hadn't told me that for years amen maybe some of you need to look at one another and say man you get good groceries and you know what happened church when they started saying good things then another person showed up in the room because you were never restored God is interested in building up salvation he's interested in building up praise he is not interested in tearing you down so why do we do it God forgive us why do we do it because we're not designed to tear one another down we're designed to build off Nehemiah said I've been riding through the congregation and now it's time to say this is why I've come it's time for you to build the Walls by your house don't go build somebody else's wall where it's at your house you build that it's for you and for your children Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord God will work on something insignificant when he dropped down in the middle of that couple I stood up and said I don't need to counsel you anymore now you need to let him do the work because he'll move on confession when you do it I just want to say just a few more things but if you if you look in this book and you go read it yourself and ask the Lord to just show you what has happened there you read this book when when these men got stirred up because Nehemiah was coming to help the people they started mocking him this was their attack they attacked him in three different ways they doubted his purpose they doubted his calling then they doubted his purpose and then they started rumors about him it was all psychological warfare Satan has used that for decades for generations for millenniums he's used the greatest battle ever fought he's used psychological warfare what people think instead of what actually is psyops is is a is a a division that they use in war to try to work on the minds of the people to expect defeat amen when when Alexander the Great was in Retreat from a place and he said the enemy is going to follow us and we're going to be we're going to be defeated if they realize how weak we are he had his men make armor that would fit 10 to 12 foot men and leave it behind in the camp so that the enemy when they came upon the camp would think they were refighting men that were 10 foot tall psyops so when the men come up on that camp they're like man we ain't gonna follow these guys who in the world do they have the Egyptians in the time of I don't know that guy's name it starts with the c colimas or something and and this other nation was coming in they they read about they they read about these people that they were afraid of cats and in the cats eyes were the was the the light of life and they they were afraid to touch them so there was a worship thing so these men went and caught as many cats as they could and they tied them to their to their armor and they came on after him and then they caught as many cats as they could and they set them loose in front of the armies of those Egyptians and guess who won the guys that we're not afraid of the cats psyops working on Superstition and what people think Satan hasn't changed you start little labels and things amongst congregations talk about people I don't like haggy I to you no man he he has one sermon chuck wood chuck wood chop wood chop wood you know we start labels on one another you need to stop it because that's what these two brothers did that God said I don't want them in my congregation they start rumors they doubt your calling you know I've had people doubt my calling but I'm glad it wasn't them that called me I said Hey brother Danny I think you're called to preach I said oh thank you I thought it too so I'll just go ahead and decide to do it no it was God that called me from my heart if I had to rest upon somebody calling me then they might call me back and say listen buddy we were wrong oh amen amen you gotta know you gotta know and Nehemiah knew who had called him it didn't matter how many Tobias and Sun balance there was he knew he came with the burden of the Lord so they mocked him they said what what you're going to go and you're going to try to rebuild that mess and he said I'm determined God has sent me to build that mess well you know they've been in that condition for years it's not going to be rebuilt back he said but you don't understand the burden that I have on my heart and the word is behind me and I've got the king's letters and I got the wood amen and I got the desire and now I'm going to preach a message and these people that don't have the desire soon will have it because my burden will become their burden and there become stirred and they'll start looking at the wall right by their house and they'll start building Brick by Brick and if you're afraid of the enemy pull your sword amen and put a brick in the other hand and start building that wall and if you can't do both at the same time then you better quit what you're doing if you can't juggle both then you better if you can't hold both if you can't hold a career here and the word here amen and it's only holding a career then you better drop the career right that's right come on now church amen because God wants the walls rebuilt he's not interested in you become famous or Rich he wants the walls rebuilt [Music] well blessed be the name of the Lord so what did the enemy do he uses imagination as I mentioned that last night that he'll study your static strategy how you use the word he didn't say how you use your job he said how you use the word he studies it he said now you never want to reason with God's word just believe it don't even try to explain it don't try to figure it out you cannot figure out God so God is the word and it's just made to believe and that's our strengths to accept the words and anyone knows a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind oh my how many people amen that we're out in darkness but the word went over the seed and the seed produced what was in it what was in it the same word that was being preached oh that's a miracle Satan has kept people under control because he's had the people trying to work through one of the Outlets of the Mind instead of from the word anchored in the heart that's what psyops is directing the way you think and influencing your actions as a direct result of this Warfare and if he can get you to think well I came for prayer I didn't feel any different I'm going to go right back to the same things I used to be into I feel different you've totally missed what the word told you to do the word said you may not feel different but you believed you're different if you believe you're different you keep saying you're different you keep saying the word is true and God not you God will make the word your body come into the word confession he is the high priest of your confession amen blessed be the name of the Lord God will show up yeah yeah caught on work you've got to stand you know I've been around long enough many of you know my testimony already but I just want to say it some of you that haven't been around long enough you know I came out of the contested a contested Union a a war my family my home was a war and if you've ever read if you've ever read the quote of brother Branham he's asked the question question answers 1964. brother Madam I have two daughters married to men in denominations they've received opposition what should they do hold fast Show Your Colors I don't say don't go around them and fellowship with them but you know what Dove can't eat with a buzzard that's all he said that was my mother that was my aunt and I want you to know I am the word made flesh that that word that advice from that word works it don't only preserve it saves it don't only save it pulls but you gotta Hold Your Position that's right my mother received opposition for 10 years my dad would periodically empty her closet out throw her stuff out in the yard say get out of my home and it finally come down to a place he said to brother man's in heaven he didn't call him brother he said to William Brown's in heaven I don't want to go and he moved her all over the country California New Mexico we bought places bound to Florida I was born back to Ohio trying to get her out of the message and he couldn't get her out of it she had her times a doubt because you're going through opposition and persecution and opposition but my grandmother see I like the book of Timothy where he said I'm persuaded amen the faith that's in your grandmother was in your mother is also in you amen and my grandmother amen who was a Mennonite converted Mennonite went to work for somebody called Bill Dow Bill DAL to introduce her to the message she lived she worked in that home he carried her down to the to the the Met to the meetings of William Branham and she was converted and then the daughters were converted amen and then my dad got stirred up when Nehemiah began to come into the home and begin to say this is the time to seek your welfare and he began to say you're not going to serve that you know he wasn't a good denominational man until he got threatened you know people are satisfied with status quo right satisfied with nostalgic things and going where their mother went and gone where their grandmother went and if you're not careful it'll happen in the message where people become the second and the third generation and the Embers of God will die out let me get satisfied amen my dad did everything he could to get her out of the message Amen to come down to a time that my uncle who has been fighting in Vietnam came home and he by the time he got home you enjoy this Brother David you couldn't you couldn't you could he was in the it was in the early 70s he was a hippie he was all racked out on drugs and everything else and God saved him God saved him he wanted to be baptized and my mom wanted to go see it so she told her I can remember hold on to my mom's clothes when my dad screamed at her and you'd never know my dad if you if you'd have seen him later but then the way he was the persecution he brought he would take us to his church and he'd tell us don't believe what your mama believed she's in a cult I can remember that then Mom would take us to the church and we'd sit there and listen to tapes and that go with Dad and then go with Mom amen but there had been a promise given whole fast hold fast amen and so that time came that that he was going my uncle was going to get baptized and my mom wanted to go and and dad said now if you go when you get back I'm gone and the children are gone I'm finished I hear you're speaking to a mother what are you gonna do you want to lose your family now your family's going to be split you're going to lose your children something rose up in her and said I'm gonna go anyhow don't go anyhow though God slay me yet I'll trust him I'm going to go anyhow okay she made her stand showed her colors all right you got to show what you believe you can't just do it in the atmosphere of church let me tell you this is the easiest place to raise your hand and say Amen and many people get misguided because they can say Amen in church right oh my God oh you get out there though what do you believe uh you know I'm not issue there's a reproach with this brother Billy amen mom says she's going anyhow she'd done her part now God said I'll do mine and so my dad being the tough guy he is he started to cry because he felt sorry for himself he said they were not tears of repentance he said they were crocodile tears he said I didn't really want to send my wife away and and and and split the home but I could didn't know what else to do I was sick of it and he said my conversation my conversion never happened in the church it never happened at an altar my conversion was in the kitchen he said I turned around put my hands in my pockets and started crying because I knew I have made something that I don't really want to do and when he'd done that God dropped down when God dropped down my dad turned around to my my mother and he said I'll take you and a week later he was baptized I want you to know thank you I am the word made flesh of somebody's testimony who refused to back up to the devil and to the mockery of some Mallet and the mockery of tobiah that says it will not work I want you to know it works [Applause] my God is able to take a heart that is full of hatred and I remember years later my dad my dad liked to say I was 40 years in the message 10 against it and 34 inch amen and then uh I can remember after he went on to be the Lord let me tell you you don't think God's real my my dad wasn't a dynamic man he was probably a haggy eye you know he knew how he was a contractor too and he knew how to do wood and I'm not saying you're not oh my goodness this is a bad way Glory love you brother David you're wonderful amen but but what I'm saying is he actually told me he didn't take the humility of a man who's been a pastor for over 30 years and he told me towards the end of his life he said Danny I don't even know how to close a service let me look at him I don't want to hear him yeah I've heard it said by people that left the message preachers he don't know how to preach his way out in a paper bag well must have been a good paper bag because he he stayed with the word and they didn't you see it's not about personality it's not who we like the most I saw that man who might not been dynamic in preaching but stand on a corner and people pop beer tabs in his face and he witnessed the gospel until the church was built he might not have been a pre able to preach out of a pre a paper bag but he could witness the words I saw him walk into a room with 19 preachers and stand for the message this is a man that hated it and now he's standing for it that's my God my God knows how to build the walls I remember brother Billy I had a woman come to church and she took a track from out front it was serpent seat you know you know I've heard people say well I'm sorry I hope you don't say it here but I heard people say you know don't talk to people about serpency just tell them about Jesus well you know our church was built on serpent seed I just got to tell you that's the way it was we'd go into the house and my dad would go hey what do you think happened in the garden you know I think this is why it was with him because he was so much against it when God changed his heart he just let him off that's where he started where he hated the most yeah I'm not saying that's how you have to do it here okay you know go build some wood or something do something amen and I remember those woman's is going dads went on to be with the Lord and I saw him die I was there I know how a saint dies they don't die afraid come on I know what God does amen I I know when he was dying he didn't think he was going to die he thought God was going to raise him up he's going back in the Pulpit again he stood up and testified I'm going to be I'm healed amen and then then we're sitting there we're watching him go down and and fear came down upon me four o'clock at night in the hospital and God told me he said this Soldier has fallen but he's only fallen asleep okay he arise again he'll rise in perfect health now I know amen when my dad was starting to go into that coma and he couldn't go to church anymore that was as great as he thought I just got to get to church and he couldn't go to church anymore so we went there and had church with him I laid the Bible up by his head he's laying there his mouth is open his eyes are rolled back but I begin to read he prepares a table before me in the presence and I watch those eyes come rolling back down and before long they sharpened and then they begin and I stopped quoting and he continued talking amen I watched God have church with him I know how a saint dies he doesn't die afraid for God comes and Carries him over that's the God I serve that's the god I am a person I have seen amen the houses and the walls in Jerusalem personally be rebuilt and God tried to when my dad tried to destroy the message God turned it around you know what the Elders of the church came to him Brother David and they said you watch Johnny in five years all your kids will be in the world you know that Elder that said that and all his children went to the world every one of my dads are still in my church ah my God can take a challenge well you don't think my God's strong enough my God's strong enough you don't think God can't save your children my God can save your children why you let the devil lie to you all right let me just finish this story he stood up amen this woman should come to church she's read the serpent seed and she jumped up and ran out of the church hey man you'll find out anybody's been in my church our church is way out in the country there ain't nowhere to run she left the grounds well he sent the deacons out looking for her they're going up and down the road hey ain't nobody there across the across the road where amen is uh is uh uh a lane that goes up the house and right in front of the lane it says no trespassing I said yeah that's where she's at so I walked up she's sitting on these people's porch he's not supposed to be there and I told her I said sister that was my first mistake I said sister and she goes I'm not your sister it's all right ma'am I said we're not supposed to be here this is no trespassing I said why don't we just go back to church and talk about it she goes somebody needs to tell your people there in a cult all right let's just go back to church and talk about it it was somebody needs to tell him and she we come inside of the church and she put her hand out like this and she goes God opened the eyes of these people let them see that they're in darkness and I looked at her and I said ma'am my daddy hated this message worse than you did she goes bless his heart I said you see that church right there she goes yeah I said he built it I said I know if God can save him he can do the same for you so we went and sent another Pavilion she wanted to talk about all that was wrong with the message now now you forgive me for the way this sounds but this is the way it was she had hair shorter than mine and she wanted to talk about it I didn't say it she wanted to talk about it one thing you guys believe you believe this about the hair and everything else but you just follow what a man says all I did was start quoting the word I never quoted anything but the Bible that's all I quoted she quit quoting the Bible and started quoting words that I couldn't actually pronounce and I looked her I said ma'am those words are not in the Bible why don't we just quote the word and she got madder than a hornet she jumped out of her chair and said I know where you're getting that I said where are my goodnesses you're getting it from William Bradham and I said ma'am I have done nothing but quote First Corinthians 11 and you said I'm getting from William Branham I said you just paid him the greatest compliment you could pay him because this Prophet I'm following is not coming with a cunningly divised Fable amen it's not out of his own imagination it is the power of God unto salvation Hallelujah and this is the hour of restoration I gotta close I didn't preach about Nehemiah enough you can go read it yourself three things doubted their calling mocked his calling doubted his purpose mocked his purpose started rumors on him and he never gave in to him one time but it come down to the end

Bible you find a lot of things happen in chapter 13. they found out that tobiah the ammonite had been given a room in the temple to live and that room had been reserved for the tithe and offering for the Levites and instead they made a room for him there because he had allies in the congregation that was the last work of Nehemiah he goes what in the world are you doing you have let him come all the way to the temple and a man who's not supposed to enter in there you have allowed him to stay there why do you think nothing's going to change if you allow these hindering blocking things stay in

that they'll ever have and I ask that you would granted yes amen in amen [Music] you know when God deals with you he always gives you a way to testify whether it's raising your hand whether it's a tear running down your cheek sometimes you feel like every eye on the building's just on you I know everybody knows he's talking about me praise God I hope everybody knows this morning he was talking about me every aspect of it because I want to be that word don't you amen it's always hard to close a meeting [Music] but we do want once again to remind and say to you the pool's open if you've never been baptized in Christian baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord's dealt with your heart you want to change the ways of your life and you want to be made new and you've repented and you want to make the change in your life God's offered a pool for you to be baptized that you might receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and after it's dismissed in the services we've sang our songs if you'd like to receive the Holy Spirit and you've never really felt that you've been the holy spirit's come in your life we'd be happy to lay our hands on you and pray for you that you would receive the Holy Spirit you say when will it be I don't know but he said Paul laid their hands on and they received the Holy Spirit so we thank you for this wonderful time you know I don't know which of those prophets that Danny was talking about I don't feel like I'm neither I feel like I'm a sinner saved by grace [Music] one day God come down into a little old hippie boy told me he loved me told me never leave me or never forsake me me be with me even in me till the end and full of complexes and never liked people but his love is greater than anything that could ever be expressed little children love one another take care of one another there might be visitors that don't have a place to go maybe you could invite them into your homes take them out to eat look around make sure everybody's taken care of look after one another and we will certainly trust the Lord that that what you've received this week will be extremely fruitful and that you'll take something you have a job to do you have some walls to build some things to fix in your life you got the things to go make right just do it just go just go do it be doers of the word not hear or say also and may your light shine amongst men that your good works glorify your father which is in heaven go into all the world preach the gospel Lay Your Hands on the sick and they shall recover take up deadly things they will not harm you and one glad morning we're all going to gather together on the shores do you believe that I believe that with all my heart with all my heart oh some glad morning when this life is [Music] really [Music] [Applause] [Music] really alive [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Happy Days [Music] [Music] Fly Away [Music] [Applause] [Music] now you know you're the Church of the flyaways [Music] you all believe that now you talked about what we believe now we're crazy We Believe that one day one day we're gonna be walking down around here and we are going to fly away yep we're gonna walk out of these bodies that's right [Music] [Music] I want you to know that there was a one that came from Heaven yes yeah that's right and he appeared in a in a body just like us yeah and he went to the cross and he gave his blood to forgive me of everything I ever done and they buried them just like they buried every other man before but he come out of the ground and not only did he come out of the grave he flew away right and there were those Among Us whose song Fly Away yeah and they they told us he flew away and then he told us that he's gonna come back again all right and they said oh he said but he left us in evidence he gave us something and that proved that was true and we call that the baptism of the Holy Ghost he gave us an experience he he the very spirit that raised him from the dead right the very spirit that quick in his Spirit he sent that same Spirit back on us hallelujah so now I have the same Spirit yes quickened him because he said if the spirit does win Christ Jesus dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body amen now he said that Spirit that's going to make that change is a gift from God and he gives it to every believer in every person who asked for it [Music] so we get it all mixed up we think oh I want this spirit so I can live right I don't want the spirit out of liver I want the spirit so I can fly away I don't like this place and if you didn't have the spirit of God I probably wouldn't like you foreign but he gave us life [Music] the very life that took him out of the Grave the very life that he flew away with he sent it back I will not leave you comfortless but I personal pronouns will come again I'll be with you even in you till the end that's what we're asking you this morning do have that that's Jesus that's the spirit of God it's his gift to you and you said oh what do I got to do ask for it what's the evidence of it I don't know he tried to make one evidence fit all this isn't a fit all gospel it's a fit me gospel Spirit he sent me of himself fit me and it fits you because it's personal so just remember we're we're not here just to be the greatest moral people in the world we live morally because we love him but we're here to leave this is not a staying gospel it's a leaving gospel now I want to ask you how many want to fly away [Music] if you want to fly away ask yourself one simple question do I have his Spirit his gift in me right or is the devil trying to put chains on me and hold me here so you're flapping your wins and he's pulling you down remember Johnny Crowe had the ring on him so long they finally cut the string and he couldn't fly I don't want to live like that and so it's a simple question you gotta ask yourself do I want to live for the Lord Lord I want to live for you my heart's telling me the seed inside of me is telling me I hear the Deep calling to the Deep what can I do what can I do repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of Holy Ghost if you've already been baptized and you just don't know that that life's in you we'll be happy to pray for you we don't have to empty this fill this altar up and let her we can just simply lay our hands on you and say father may they receive the Holy Ghost and we'll do it after service is over [Music] but don't leave here if you don't have him [Music] yes don't leave here if you don't have him he's giving you the opportunity let me say it this way don't leave here without the desire in your heart to have him because it's a gift I can't give it he can give it but you walk from this place this morning saying I want to fly away I I want to I want it with all my heart be right and live and and know that there's a hope because he said I'll come again and receive you that where I am you may be awesome also this is the gospel the gospel is there's coming a generation that's going to leave this earth and I believe I'm looking at it art I believe that that we're going to fly away isn't that really what you want to do [Music] thank you I'd like to just play that song One More Time Julie the one I have you sing all the time you say how do I get from there there
