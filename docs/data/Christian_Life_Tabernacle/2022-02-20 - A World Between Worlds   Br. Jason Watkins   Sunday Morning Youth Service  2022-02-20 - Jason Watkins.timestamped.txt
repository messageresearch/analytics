[12:56] amen that's all that i'm asking of you
[12:59] that's not too much
[13:01] amen we uh
[13:04] i we wanted to make just a few
[13:07] uh statements uh before we start our
[13:10] service we did want to thank
[13:12] brother matthew and brother billy and
[13:15] brother andrew and
[13:17] david and julie and all the host
[13:19] families
[13:20] and all all this
[13:23] chaperones and drivers and and all those
[13:26] that help support this meeting
[13:29] and this time of fellowship we
[13:32] we just really want to thank you so much
[13:34] for
[13:35] uh because you know without you
[13:38] um
[13:39] you just it couldn't be done that's all
[13:42] there is to it you know so
[13:44] all of you supported this the finances
[13:46] that you helped
[13:48] with the youth coming and everything is
[13:51] wonderful
[13:53] again i don't
[13:54] really consider them
[13:56] like
[13:57] youth
[13:58] i guess everybody the way they talk
[14:00] about me i'm entering into my second
[14:03] childhood so
[14:06] i don't
[14:07] i kind of smile all the time but
[14:11] you know i i like to say this that
[14:15] god uses youth yes
[14:17] and and and you're a part
[14:21] of this family and a part of this army
[14:24] i i know sometimes we treat you like a
[14:28] a
[14:28] another element
[14:30] you know like you're something that has
[14:32] to be
[14:34] dealt with
[14:35] uh
[14:36] special you know because
[14:39] but you're not you're you're a
[14:42] living vibrant part
[14:44] of the bride of christ
[14:47] and and if you look through the
[14:49] scriptures
[14:51] i mean
[14:52] and you look at these great
[14:55] warriors that i'll mention like abel
[15:00] abel
[15:01] was a youth
[15:04] you know he was
[15:05] probably
[15:07] 13 14 years old
[15:10] and
[15:10] he he had revelation from god
[15:15] to choose
[15:16] the acceptable sacrifice
[15:19] you look at joseph
[15:21] just a young fellow when he had dreams
[15:24] and visions and was thrown in the well
[15:28] samuel was just a boy
[15:31] when the lord spoke to him and he went
[15:33] to the temple
[15:36] daniel
[15:37] when when they were brought into
[15:39] captivity the historians feel that they
[15:42] were around 12 years old
[15:45] and
[15:46] and
[15:48] shadrach meshach and abednego all young
[15:50] people all your age
[15:52] and look at what's been written of them
[15:54] through the scriptures and
[15:56] you know it's not some old preacher
[15:59] that they're talking about
[16:02] they're talking about
[16:04] uh
[16:05] what we would call youth but there were
[16:07] people that just were
[16:10] their age was
[16:12] didn't hinder god
[16:14] one bit you know you take
[16:17] naaman's maid
[16:20] just the wisdom that she had and the
[16:22] service she had
[16:24] and and how many times has she referred
[16:27] to in this scripture
[16:29] you know the lad that had the fishes and
[16:32] the lows
[16:34] you know one of the greatest bible
[16:36] stories was because some
[16:39] uh
[16:40] a youth or a member of our body that
[16:43] hadn't was young uh
[16:47] was led of the lord to be where he was
[16:49] at you even take mary the mother of
[16:52] jesus
[16:54] just a child 14 years old
[16:58] and and so you you understand that that
[17:03] i
[17:04] the challenge that's there for you
[17:08] is
[17:10] to be led of the spirit
[17:12] of the lord and that god can lead you so
[17:16] you know each one of you is writing a
[17:18] new chapter
[17:19] in the book of acts the acts of the holy
[17:23] spirit
[17:24] through you
[17:26] and and that's we're here to encourage
[17:28] you we we have these meetings so you can
[17:31] come from different places meet new
[17:33] friends meet one another have fellowship
[17:37] if it's the lord's will
[17:38] a companion or a relationship might join
[17:42] a friendship might join
[17:44] uh support
[17:46] from peer support one with another so
[17:49] all those things are there but
[17:52] we all sit under the same word
[17:55] there's not a young people's gospel
[17:59] you know what i mean it's the same
[18:00] gospel there's not a young people's god
[18:03] there's not a young people's holy spirit
[18:06] it it does the same thing on all of us
[18:10] and we we all come to the lord at
[18:13] different times in different ages and we
[18:16] start our journey but
[18:19] god's good and so
[18:21] i think more than anything
[18:24] i would love you to always know that
[18:26] you're needed that's right
[18:28] your your fire and your life
[18:32] and your dedication is an inspiration
[18:36] the young
[18:37] young ladies that go to school or go to
[18:40] your jobs or whatever you do and you
[18:43] should let the light of the gospel shine
[18:46] and your young men that don't get caught
[18:48] up in the folly of the world it's a
[18:51] great testimony and your reward is going
[18:54] to be marvelous
[18:56] and i know it's hard to live down here
[18:59] but
[19:00] this isn't a staying gospel this is a
[19:03] leaving gospel
[19:04] it's all about one day
[19:07] one morning in a twinkling of eyes
[19:10] we're going to be changed
[19:12] and when you're dancing
[19:14] over there
[19:16] everybody that's left here
[19:18] is going to wish
[19:20] they were you
[19:22] so i i just i i want to uh commend you
[19:26] and tell you how much respect i have for
[19:29] you
[19:31] how fortunate i am that you the lord has
[19:35] led you
[19:36] in the path of truth
[19:38] and righteousness and i believe god's
[19:41] got abundant blessings for you
[19:44] so don't ever let
[19:47] anybody as we read
[19:49] in timothy and i think it's just such a
[19:53] a great scripture he said in timothy 4
[19:56] and 12
[19:57] and i'd just like to read it again let
[20:00] no man despise thy youth
[20:06] but be doubt an example yes
[20:10] and i've seen many young people come
[20:12] back
[20:14] from a fellowship meeting
[20:16] with on fire for god and inspire their
[20:20] parents to turn their lives around
[20:25] so don't ever
[20:26] let any complex
[20:29] on you
[20:30] that would think that you don't have an
[20:32] effect because you're 12 or 13 or 15 or
[20:37] whatever age you are
[20:39] let no man despise thy youth
[20:43] but beat out an example
[20:46] of the believer
[20:48] in word
[20:51] in conversation
[20:53] in charity
[20:55] in spirit
[20:57] in faith
[20:59] and in purity
[21:00] i believe you can do that i believe
[21:03] you're called to do it and i just want
[21:05] to let you know you're a true
[21:06] inspiration to us we thank you so much
[21:09] the visitors and our young people that
[21:12] have come together
[21:13] i hope you've had a wonderful time and
[21:16] once again thank you for making this
[21:18] possible and god richly bless you
[21:21] may you prosper
[21:23] and be in good health
[21:25] may the grace of god be abundant to you
[21:28] may you increase in revelation and
[21:30] understanding and most of all may the
[21:33] love of god
[21:34] be shed abroad in your heart by the holy
[21:37] spirit god bless you all thank you

[46:16] don't feel isolated you say well they're
[46:19] surrounded but even in a crowd like this
[46:20] you can feel isolated and i felt that
[46:23] last night when our brother was
[46:24] preaching at the end he said you tell
[46:26] the enemy you know you're a liar
[46:29] and something just kept saying there's
[46:31] some that feel isolated even in this and
[46:33] i want you to know you look at that
[46:35] enemy and tell satan i am not isolated i
[46:38] am surrounded

[46:42] you just keep pressing on you have been
[46:44] redeemed

[46:53] worship with me
[46:56] [Music]

[47:10] all i could see was the struggle
[47:17] i was haunted
[47:20] by ghosts that lived in my past
[47:29] bound up
[47:31] in shackles of all my failures
[47:35] [Music]
[47:38] i was wondering
[47:41] how long is this gonna last
[47:47] [Music]
[47:49] then you look at this prisoner and said
[47:53] to me son
[47:54] stop fighting a fight that's already
[47:58] been won
[48:01] singing now
[48:03] i am redeemed
[48:05] [Music]
[48:08] you set me free
[48:10] [Music]
[48:14] so i'll shake off these heavy chains and
[48:18] wipe away
[48:26] [Music]
[48:30] i'm redeemed
[48:32] [Music]

[53:27] a sincere request because he has some
[53:30] very important and complicated
[53:32] situations that he is facing this week
[53:36] he needs god to undertake on his behalf
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] i know god's just and faithful
[53:44] and his word says that
[53:46] a prayer of a righteous man availeth
[53:48] much
[53:50] we don't want the formality of a
[53:52] church service just to
[53:55] read something that's been written down
[53:56] and us just let it pass us by like we
[53:59] don't have any responsibility
[54:01] but each one of you have a
[54:02] responsibility to this request that was
[54:04] just written
[54:05] you might have traveled from several
[54:07] miles but
[54:09] god might lay that burden on your heart
[54:11] and you might take it back to louisiana
[54:13] or to arkansas and
[54:15] when you're on your knees before the
[54:16] lord maybe that burden will strike you
[54:19] see lord i remember that request from my
[54:21] brother joseph
[54:22] god would you move on his behalf
[54:26] maybe there's somebody that wants to
[54:27] lift up a hand right now and say lord
[54:30] i also have an urgent need
[54:33] i have an urgent request
[54:35] well just brother aaron oglesby to come
[54:37] and ask a blessing over the tithes and
[54:40] offerings and over
[54:41] these prayer requests why don't we just
[54:43] stand together with him
[54:47] lift those hands up if you have that
[54:48] need
[54:50] remember brother jason as he comes forth
[54:52] with the anointed word and
[54:54] why don't you start asking god to start
[54:56] speaking to your heart and
[54:59] you know by the preaching of the word
[55:02] god brings deliverance
[55:05] and the very need with these uplifted
[55:07] hands by the preaching of the word god
[55:08] can meet you
[55:10] and meet that need do you believe it

[1:20:51] of god i think we proved that last night
[1:20:54] and man i was happy to find myself
[1:20:56] identified in the family
[1:20:59] book
[1:21:01] hallelujah well we're going to turn to
[1:21:03] the one of the best books in the bible
[1:21:05] we're going to turn to genesis chapter
[1:21:06] 28 and preach in the name of the lord
[1:21:08] and happy to be here
[1:21:10] and while you're finding your place in
[1:21:12] genesis 28 trusting that last night
[1:21:17] you know i
[1:21:18] i'm trusting last night will be a
[1:21:20] hallmark for you
[1:21:22] forever
[1:21:23] amen that you'll never again we
[1:21:25] concluded last night with putting the
[1:21:27] devil in the place
[1:21:29] that he belongs
[1:21:30] and deserves that he's a liar
[1:21:33] amen he doesn't run anything in god's
[1:21:35] kingdom he has no say in your life and
[1:21:37] you just need to believe that
[1:21:39] and i i'm i love telling him that i you
[1:21:42] know i i let him know all the time he
[1:21:44] ain't nobody i said you ain't nobody
[1:21:46] satan you don't make my you don't make
[1:21:48] decisions on my behalf my my whole life
[1:21:50] is guided by my father
[1:21:52] and you're not you can't even move
[1:21:53] against me without his permission
[1:21:56] i don't live by the mercies of lucifer i
[1:21:59] live by the mercies of jesus christ
[1:22:03] and so you know i remind him all the
[1:22:05] time you know it doesn't even matter
[1:22:06] what perceived victory he thinks he gets
[1:22:08] over me doesn't count
[1:22:11] doesn't matter
[1:22:12] amen so
[1:22:14] you know
[1:22:15] as we showed last night
[1:22:17] that the blood is what keeps us because
[1:22:19] it's perpetually continually atoning for
[1:22:21] us continually speaking she is me she is
[1:22:24] me she is me i'm innocent she's innocent
[1:22:26] i'm innocent she's innocent i was
[1:22:28] perfect she's perfect
[1:22:29] and uh and that's the conclusion of the
[1:22:32] word that we were in christ perfect in
[1:22:34] him
[1:22:35] before the world began i want to uh
[1:22:37] speak to you today and kind of continue
[1:22:40] on that thought and

[1:24:25] some time ago just because it was taking
[1:24:27] up too much of my time so if anybody's
[1:24:29] been trying to reach me by facebook and
[1:24:31] i haven't been replying i'm not i'm
[1:24:32] sorry this am i there anymore i'm not
[1:24:35] saying i won't go back but i i never i
[1:24:37] never used social media for me
[1:24:39] personally i i made a decision i
[1:24:41] wouldn't use it for
[1:24:42] um
[1:24:44] for social interaction i used my wall
[1:24:47] for posting quotes and things of brother
[1:24:49] branham and great thoughts and essays
[1:24:51] and things and so but uh it just became
[1:24:54] a little overwhelming and uh you know
[1:24:56] i've i've i've had my
[1:24:58] you know
[1:24:59] family members and snapchat and and and

[1:25:29] but anyway so i just wanted to clear the
[1:25:32] air on that say yeah yeah i think

[1:25:50] amen so that's god has facebook too
[1:25:53] um
[1:25:54] i really enjoyed myself last night and
[1:25:56] let's get straight into the word i i
[1:25:58] appreciate all of you who have come from
[1:26:00] near and far it's so
[1:26:01] uh heartwarming to see brother david
[1:26:04] took me through the back and to see all
[1:26:05] the rooms full and and even the the
[1:26:08] minister study over here uh i was full
[1:26:12] and they're in the hallways and they're
[1:26:13] all over the place and
[1:26:15] and uh so
[1:26:16] that's just wonderful you know what it
[1:26:18] does it always reminds me especially uh
[1:26:20] what's today sunday so saturday when i
[1:26:23] went and saw all the
[1:26:25] all the young people at the park anytime
[1:26:27] i get around something like that i start
[1:26:29] thinking about the millennium
[1:26:31] what a day what a time that that's going
[1:26:34] to be
[1:26:35] you know there's just something precious
[1:26:37] about gathering with the family of god
[1:26:39] they become far closer you know a lot a
[1:26:42] lot of us and i'm me included have blood
[1:26:45] family who are not uh have have elected
[1:26:48] not to be in the family of god they
[1:26:49] don't want to be a part of it and i and
[1:26:51] you actually find that you become closer
[1:26:53] to god's family
[1:26:55] sometimes than your own blood family who
[1:26:57] are not in the kingdom of christ and and
[1:27:00] the the affinity you have and the
[1:27:02] camaraderie and the spree decor and the
[1:27:05] fellowship that you have is is is much
[1:27:08] richer and deeper uh but we're
[1:27:11] holding out for our family amen
[1:27:14] so praise the lord uh genesis chapter 28
[1:27:18] we're going to begin at verse
[1:27:20] 10.
[1:27:23] and we'll read through verse 22 and let
[1:27:25] you be seated
[1:27:29] and jacob went out from beersheba and
[1:27:31] went toward haran
[1:27:33] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[1:27:35] tarried there all night
[1:27:37] because the sun was set and he took of
[1:27:40] the stones of that place and put them
[1:27:42] for his pillows and lay down in that
[1:27:44] place to sleep and he dreamed and behold
[1:27:48] a ladder was set up on the earth and the
[1:27:50] top of it reached to heaven
[1:27:53] and behold the angels of god ascending
[1:27:56] and descending on it
[1:27:58] and behold the lord stood above it and
[1:28:00] said
[1:28:00] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[1:28:04] and the god of isaac the land whereon
[1:28:08] thou liest to thee will i give it
[1:28:12] and to thy seed
[1:28:14] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[1:28:16] earth and thou shalt prepare thou shalt
[1:28:19] spread abroad to the west
[1:28:21] and to the east and to the north and to
[1:28:23] the south and in thee and in thy seed
[1:28:26] shall all the families of the earth be
[1:28:28] blessed
[1:28:29] and behold i am with thee and will keep
[1:28:32] thee in all places wither thou goest and
[1:28:35] will bring thee again into this land for
[1:28:38] i will not leave thee until i have done
[1:28:41] that which i have spoken to thee of
[1:28:44] and jacob awake out of his sleep
[1:28:47] and he said surely the lord is in this
[1:28:49] place and i knew it not and he was
[1:28:52] afraid and he said how dreadful is this
[1:28:54] place there is none this is none other
[1:28:56] but the house of god
[1:28:58] and this is the gate of heaven
[1:29:00] and jacob rose up early in the morning
[1:29:02] and took the stone he had
[1:29:04] uh he had had for his pillows and set it
[1:29:07] up for a pillar and poured oil upon the
[1:29:09] top of it and he called the name of that
[1:29:11] place
[1:29:12] bethel
[1:29:13] and the name of that city was called
[1:29:16] lose at the first
[1:29:18] and jacob vowed a vow saying
[1:29:21] if god will be with me and will keep me
[1:29:24] in this way that i go and will give me
[1:29:27] bread to eat and raiment to put on so
[1:29:29] that i come again to my father's house
[1:29:32] in peace
[1:29:33] then shall the lord be my god and this
[1:29:36] stone which i have set for a pillar
[1:29:38] shall be
[1:29:39] shall be god's house and of all that
[1:29:43] thou shalt give me i will surely give
[1:29:45] the tenth unto thee
[1:29:48] let's pray father
[1:29:50] now lord i just relax myself i have
[1:29:54] notes before me and and many hours of
[1:29:56] study and preparation and prayer i have
[1:30:00] multiple confirmations of supernaturally
[1:30:03] lord this morning that we won't even
[1:30:04] take time to testify of the lord i know
[1:30:07] and am convinced that i have your
[1:30:09] perfect will and your word for this
[1:30:11] audience today
[1:30:13] and father i'm just they sang a song
[1:30:15] they invited me out and i just followed
[1:30:17] you up here and and i'm just your
[1:30:20] servant that's it i'm just your
[1:30:21] assistant i'm just here to assist you
[1:30:23] lord that's all i am that's all i ever
[1:30:25] want to be
[1:30:26] so we give it into your hands completely
[1:30:29] now in jesus lovely name amen god bless
[1:30:32] you as you're seated
[1:30:58] so last night we were and i have a
[1:31:01] number of
[1:31:02] scriptures and quotes that i'm going to
[1:31:04] refer to and
[1:31:06] i was asked if i would like to display
[1:31:08] them and i i think not because sometimes
[1:31:12] if i'm in a certain gear and
[1:31:13] planning a certain pace i'll do that but
[1:31:16] for my for my feeling today i don't want
[1:31:19] to get kind of slowed down with displays
[1:31:21] i just want to go quickly and i might
[1:31:23] not even read whole
[1:31:25] but it'll be familiar to you anyway and
[1:31:27] i'll give you the reference for it and
[1:31:29] for people who are taking notes and what
[1:31:30] more and on the archive
[1:31:32] so last night we were talking about
[1:31:35] uh the expression of god and how that
[1:31:39] god and i want to just start right there
[1:31:42] uh to to really emphasize
[1:31:44] that
[1:31:45] the entire
[1:31:46] happenings of god's family down through
[1:31:49] history have all been pre-planned by god
[1:31:52] and that's direct tape teaching brother
[1:31:54] branham says i guess you know your life
[1:31:56] was pre-planned that's the exact word he
[1:31:58] uses it was pre-planned of god and uh
[1:32:01] set in motion and the the beauty of it
[1:32:04] is that you're going to see
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:07] jacob's life god already had a plan when
[1:32:10] jacob arrived
[1:32:11] and and nothing that jacob
[1:32:14] ever would do would change that plan
[1:32:18] and and god would say go here and you
[1:32:20] read in the text that jacob would
[1:32:22] actually go in another place and you
[1:32:24] know it's like god is saying i want you
[1:32:26] to turn right and jacob would turn left
[1:32:29] and so you know what god's reaction
[1:32:30] would be okay i'll turn left i'm just
[1:32:33] going to follow you i told you i'd stay
[1:32:35] with you i'm going to bring you back
[1:32:37] this way and you rather have went that
[1:32:39] way
[1:32:41] but i'm gonna follow you okay i told you
[1:32:43] to go to this city you went to another
[1:32:44] and i'm still i'm gonna go with you
[1:32:46] because because this is this is not
[1:32:49] about jacob being a good man in fact is
[1:32:51] he wasn't a very good man he never was a
[1:32:54] very good man until he had a name change
[1:32:56] and and and and that and that required
[1:32:59] him uh going to battle uh and and
[1:33:02] defeating himself see and so
[1:33:05] so i i don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:33:07] but but you're you're going to find that
[1:33:09] god has this purpose and we read to you
[1:33:11] last night and apparently according to
[1:33:13] the pastor you've been studying that
[1:33:15] very sermon and studying that principle
[1:33:17] how that god had one goal
[1:33:19] in all the bible and it's all about
[1:33:21] expression and brother branham says this
[1:33:23] morning we're going to see what it was
[1:33:24] and when you listen to that sermon you
[1:33:26] realize the whole plan of god is
[1:33:28] expression
[1:33:29] and god intended to express and so so
[1:33:32] because of that then everything is
[1:33:34] purposed by god everything is set in
[1:33:35] motion by god according to his purpose
[1:33:39] and plan
[1:33:40] and you you you'll see that that you
[1:33:43] know you can see progression through the
[1:33:45] word i i'm going to look at a number of
[1:33:47] examples today you know you you find
[1:33:50] where
[1:33:51] how that sometimes if you go
[1:33:52] particularly you know in um in in the
[1:33:55] book of genesis and you start catching
[1:33:58] you know genealogies and
[1:34:00] you'll see this you go and see it for
[1:34:02] yourself and you'll you'll say well you
[1:34:04] know here come a man and of the son of
[1:34:06] and here was a and he married this woman
[1:34:09] and then they had a son and and then
[1:34:11] that son and then they had another son
[1:34:12] and then that son married this one and
[1:34:14] had this son and it just breaks a family
[1:34:16] tree and and and sometimes most times
[1:34:19] you'll find it was go and he and he had
[1:34:22] a son and his name was and then he took
[1:34:24] a a wife of and had a son in his name
[1:34:26] and you'll see it go click click click
[1:34:28] click and it was kind of just peter out
[1:34:30] and that's it there's no more no more
[1:34:31] tracing of it
[1:34:32] and it'll die off
[1:34:35] and but then you'll find every once in a
[1:34:36] while you'll find it say and and he had
[1:34:39] a son and named his name and then he
[1:34:41] took a wife and had a son and you watch
[1:34:44] that and he'll just keep tracking it
[1:34:45] tracking it tracking it tracking it
[1:34:46] tracking and tracking all the way up to
[1:34:48] the time of christ
[1:34:50] and what you're seeing is you're seeing
[1:34:52] the seed of god the seed of christ
[1:34:54] traveling through the bible
[1:34:56] and this is this is how god is
[1:34:58] expressing what he's doing see
[1:35:00] and so the christ seed moving through
[1:35:03] the word and you know you find examples
[1:35:06] in the bible and i'm just giving you
[1:35:08] some that came to me off the top of my
[1:35:10] head i've studied them for years but you
[1:35:12] come to a time uh in the days of uh you
[1:35:16] know
[1:35:17] of the exodus and
[1:35:18] another here comes the children of
[1:35:20] israel and and we're way past the time
[1:35:23] of abraham and you know you've got moses
[1:35:26] leading them out and joshua taking them
[1:35:28] in and all of these all of this activity
[1:35:30] of the exodus taking place in the
[1:35:32] settling of the promised land and god
[1:35:34] comes along during that era and he says
[1:35:36] now
[1:35:37] concerning
[1:35:39] the concerning the days of abraham by my
[1:35:42] name jehovah was i not known
[1:35:45] i'm like what huh
[1:35:47] wait what i thought jehovah jireh
[1:35:51] father behold the fire behold the wood
[1:35:53] but where's the lamb for burnt offering
[1:35:55] my son the lord shall jehovah jireh
[1:35:59] he shall provide himself a sacrifice
[1:36:02] and and there's and so you realize that
[1:36:05] there's it's not a contradiction in the
[1:36:07] scripture god's not lying you understand
[1:36:10] but god is simply saying that you know
[1:36:13] if you take in the name you know elohim
[1:36:16] abraham worshiped him as elohim that
[1:36:18] self-existing spirit and when he came in
[1:36:20] the form of melchizedek then he called
[1:36:23] him lord and
[1:36:24] brother branham would always point out
[1:36:26] capital l-o-r-d
[1:36:28] and so abraham knew exactly who he was
[1:36:30] talking to it was none other than the
[1:36:32] creator of all things
[1:36:33] and and and that's why brother branham
[1:36:35] then would say now we don't hear no more
[1:36:37] of melchizedek because he became jesus
[1:36:41] christ
[1:36:43] and it was the same person
[1:36:45] see
[1:36:45] and so all you're seeing is god
[1:36:48] unfolding in a certain way
[1:36:50] and now he's taking a name that reflects
[1:36:53] what he's doing what he's up to
[1:36:56] so so now jehovah is not just the
[1:36:59] self-existing god it's now god dwelling
[1:37:02] with his family and that's where brother
[1:37:04] branham breaks it down to say that you
[1:37:06] know when he when he called them out of
[1:37:09] egypt they were god's people but when he
[1:37:12] took them through the wilderness now
[1:37:14] they now brother branham says now they
[1:37:16] became the chil the children of god of
[1:37:19] the the church of god of the wilderness
[1:37:22] see and so it's it's just god designated
[1:37:25] he's giving clues i'm on the move
[1:37:29] it's still me
[1:37:30] it's still me
[1:37:32] my you're still my family you're
[1:37:34] separated by hundreds of years they're
[1:37:36] my family you're my family i'm still
[1:37:38] your creator and i'm i'm unfolding
[1:37:41] myself
[1:37:42] see and so so you you you find that
[1:37:46] this is exactly why as i've said i don't
[1:37:48] know if i've said it here i say it
[1:37:50] around the world it it helps people to
[1:37:52] visualize
[1:37:54] you know
[1:37:55] this this is why brother branham would
[1:37:57] come
[1:37:58] and he would sit in the stand in the
[1:38:00] middle
[1:38:01] of trinitarians who had good friends
[1:38:04] noble men
[1:38:05] oneness men noble men good friends of
[1:38:07] brother branham supported his meeting
[1:38:09] said you fed my children
[1:38:11] and he would stand between them and say
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:14] frankly you're both wrong
[1:38:17] and it's and the answer's not the middle
[1:38:20] because if you he's not three
[1:38:23] and he's not one exactly like your
[1:38:25] finger would be one but he's also not
[1:38:28] two
[1:38:31] see and the reason that they would get
[1:38:34] so scrupled up is because they think of
[1:38:36] god linearly like that but he's not
[1:38:39] linear he's eternal
[1:38:41] and it's just forms of his expression
[1:38:44] and so the trinitarians were incorrect
[1:38:47] in understanding his godhead because
[1:38:50] in their formula they chopped him into
[1:38:53] three individual persons
[1:38:55] the oneness were wrong because in their
[1:38:58] formula they saw jesus only
[1:39:02] they didn't see his bride they didn't
[1:39:04] see his body which is a part of his
[1:39:07] godhead now that's direct tape teaching
[1:39:10] that's direct tape teaching brother
[1:39:11] branham says it just like that we're in
[1:39:14] god's godhead
[1:39:15] see
[1:39:16] his born-again churches is part of his
[1:39:18] godhead
[1:39:20] because it's part of his expression oh
[1:39:22] my
[1:39:23] and and you find then that that's what
[1:39:25] the seventh seal
[1:39:27] unsealed it unsealed the mighty god and
[1:39:30] unsealed mrs jesus christ that she's a
[1:39:34] continuation
[1:39:40] so when you come to
[1:39:42] you know the brag is gone in revelation
[1:39:45] 12 she's went up she goes up satan comes
[1:39:48] down
[1:39:50] the bible now of course he had already
[1:39:52] been cast down from his position
[1:39:55] to have a case against her that
[1:39:57] that was dealt with in zechariah 3 and
[1:39:59] satan sued god tried to take over the
[1:40:01] kingdom and brought brought a lawsuit
[1:40:03] against god in his own courtroom can you
[1:40:04] imagine the audacity of the devil to do
[1:40:06] something like that
[1:40:07] and he
[1:40:08] hauls joshua the high priest because the
[1:40:10] high priest represents the whole family
[1:40:12] who represents all of israel all of
[1:40:14] israel didn't have to come without
[1:40:15] offering only the high priest didn't
[1:40:16] that counted for everybody
[1:40:18] and when the hype when he brings the
[1:40:19] high priest up he's in filthy rags
[1:40:21] because israel's sinners
[1:40:23] they're all sinners they're backslid
[1:40:25] and the whole charge that satan is now
[1:40:27] suing god for control of
[1:40:29] of of the creation because god has said
[1:40:32] this would be his people
[1:40:34] but yet god can't uh can't countenance
[1:40:36] sin
[1:40:37] he can't there's no way to let sin
[1:40:40] be part of his economy and so satan is
[1:40:43] saying now you said they'd be your
[1:40:45] family but you couldn't keep them out of
[1:40:47] sin so your word is broken and now you
[1:40:50] have to let me have the throne
[1:40:52] and god in zechariah 3 is going to
[1:40:55] dismiss all of his evidence
[1:40:58] all of his dna all of his replay
[1:41:01] high def didn't matter cinematic didn't
[1:41:04] matter he's got the goods on israel and
[1:41:06] god's going to dismiss all of his
[1:41:08] evidence and throw his lawsuit out of
[1:41:09] court based on one simple thing election
[1:41:15] he's not going to debate him
[1:41:17] not going to argue the case the case is
[1:41:19] dismissed now get out of my courtroom
[1:41:21] and don't you ever accuse my family
[1:41:24] again
[1:41:27] see
[1:41:29] that's why when you come to revelation 5
[1:41:31] you have you have a strong angel
[1:41:34] representing our prophet you have john
[1:41:36] representing our bride you have the one
[1:41:38] seated on the throne from daniel's
[1:41:40] vision you have the 420 elders you have
[1:41:42] the clear
[1:41:43] crystal glass seat in front of him you
[1:41:45] have the heavenly host the one person
[1:41:48] you don't have at the time when he
[1:41:50] claims the book is the accuser
[1:41:53] why because there is now therefore no
[1:41:56] condemnation
[1:41:58] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:42:03] because you find out that you didn't
[1:42:04] start here you're not finishing here
[1:42:06] you're not from here
[1:42:07] see you came from god you're going back
[1:42:09] to god
[1:42:10] you're you're a heavenly citizen here
[1:42:12] you're a pilgrim and a stranger but the
[1:42:15] beauty of it is in christ you have
[1:42:16] diplomatic immunity
[1:42:19] and you are immune from prosecution
[1:42:21] you're above the law has no applica
[1:42:23] application to you whatsoever you're
[1:42:26] free in christ
[1:42:27] see
[1:42:29] so we find that in revelation 12 the
[1:42:32] bride goes up physically and satan is
[1:42:34] literally physically cast out not just
[1:42:38] removed from his uh his ability you know
[1:42:40] to have a to have his case heard but now
[1:42:42] he's actually literally cast out because
[1:42:44] once the bride gets there there's no
[1:42:46] room for him
[1:42:47] and so he's he's cast out and i heard a
[1:42:49] voice in heaven
[1:42:51] and i heard a loud voice in heaven
[1:42:53] saying now is come salvation and
[1:42:55] strength and catch it and the kingdom of
[1:42:57] our god and the power of his christ and
[1:43:00] now here you've got father son see
[1:43:03] and and and and and but but really the
[1:43:06] godhead is understood
[1:43:08] once we had the opening of the seven
[1:43:10] seals we understood that godhead is
[1:43:12] husband and wife
[1:43:14] because father son don't produce
[1:43:15] anything you understand that's just god
[1:43:17] going forward in expression that great
[1:43:20] eternal being became an expression and
[1:43:22] took that designation of son it was a
[1:43:24] title it wasn't a name his name was
[1:43:26] jesus
[1:43:28] see and that's why mary was told
[1:43:30] implicitly make sure you call his name
[1:43:33] jesus because that had always been his
[1:43:35] name
[1:43:36] so so we find then that this is why a
[1:43:38] prophet would preach the invisible union
[1:43:42] see of the heavenly groom and the
[1:43:45] earthly bride because that's god's
[1:43:48] godhead
[1:43:49] you understand that's why he would
[1:43:51] that's why marriage and divorce was such
[1:43:53] an important sermon see that that's
[1:43:56] that's exactly why he's he's preaching
[1:43:58] the the you know here he's going to
[1:44:01] describe heaven he's going to describe
[1:44:03] earth and he's going to say the future
[1:44:05] home of the heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:44:08] earthly bride
[1:44:10] because this is the understanding that
[1:44:12] we're coming to understand and this
[1:44:13] clears up the godhead that's why we know
[1:44:16] he's not two lords
[1:44:18] it's just christ in his bride it's
[1:44:20] christ it's god and his family here it's
[1:44:22] god and his family now look at the
[1:44:23] progression
[1:44:24] when you come to the that's at the
[1:44:26] beginning of the tribulation and by the
[1:44:28] time you get to the end of the
[1:44:29] tribulation which is covered in the
[1:44:31] previous chapter remember you can't read
[1:44:33] revelation like a newspaper you can't
[1:44:35] read it linearly so revelation 11
[1:44:38] these events are happening prior or
[1:44:41] after revelation 12.
[1:44:43] so and and in revelation 12 at the
[1:44:46] beginning of the tribulation
[1:44:48] it's the kingdom of our god and the
[1:44:50] power of his christ by the time you get
[1:44:52] to the end of the tribulation and the
[1:44:55] seventh angel sounded and there was
[1:44:57] great voices in heaven saying the
[1:44:59] kingdoms of this world are become the
[1:45:02] kingdoms of our lord and of his christ
[1:45:05] it's not god in christ now it's lord
[1:45:07] because now it's moved in the son who's
[1:45:09] our now our husband
[1:45:11] and it's mr jesus and mrs jesus
[1:45:14] you see the progression
[1:45:16] it's all progressing it's all unfolding
[1:45:20] and our god see uh uh uh the kingdoms of
[1:45:23] our lord and of his christ so i'm just
[1:45:26] going over these simple these are
[1:45:28] rudimentary things just to get your mind
[1:45:31] and going in the direction i want it to
[1:45:32] go this morning all right so
[1:45:35] god in christ then
[1:45:37] we find then of course in brother
[1:45:39] branham uh their brother brown teaches
[1:45:41] that in the seals and
[1:45:42] and
[1:45:45] sermons afterward where he talks about
[1:45:48] that that christ is the bride clearly
[1:45:50] that's tape teaching i'm not making that
[1:45:51] up
[1:45:52] and i can be happy to give you the
[1:45:53] references but so we find out then that
[1:45:57] it's coming the kingdoms of our lord and
[1:45:59] his christ
[1:46:00] and so here we see then the the truth of
[1:46:03] the godhead which we are a part of that
[1:46:06] it's god expressed in a divine family
[1:46:10] and we found out last night according to
[1:46:11] isaiah 42 that jesus is the elected son
[1:46:16] the creator of all that is and so he
[1:46:20] became a man to be a kinsmen redeemer
[1:46:24] and and so
[1:46:25] so back in that in the the very first
[1:46:28] thing that god did in fact is god the
[1:46:31] very first thing he created was to
[1:46:33] express himself his first act of
[1:46:35] creation was to move forward and express
[1:46:37] him and become the son
[1:46:40] and then the and then the and in that
[1:46:42] order in the order of the son he created
[1:46:44] everything
[1:46:46] that's why the bible says all things
[1:46:47] were made by him and without him was not
[1:46:49] anything made that was made see he's not
[1:46:51] talking about the man the human standing
[1:46:54] in matthew 18 he he's going 118 he's
[1:46:58] going all the way back john john goes
[1:47:00] all the way back in the beginning was
[1:47:03] the word
[1:47:04] see
[1:47:05] it was with god in fact it was god
[1:47:08] now the only way that even can make
[1:47:10] sense is it's an expression of god it's
[1:47:12] not a second person see
[1:47:14] so so we and that's why brother brandon
[1:47:16] would say jesus wasn't a second person
[1:47:19] he was the person
[1:47:21] see
[1:47:22] and it's it's all bound up in the
[1:47:24] paradox of how he he became a man and
[1:47:27] brother branham you know that that's a
[1:47:29] lot of times where teachers get in
[1:47:30] trouble is they're just bound and
[1:47:32] determined for some reason to do away
[1:47:33] with the paradox i don't get it i mean
[1:47:36] brother branham called it a paradox and
[1:47:38] he keeps saying brother brandon would
[1:47:40] say i don't i don't understand
[1:47:42] how that how that he was god but yet he
[1:47:45] was a man he said but he was
[1:47:48] that's late in his ministry he called it
[1:47:50] a paradox a paradox is something that
[1:47:52] can't actually be but it actually is
[1:47:54] even though it can't exist it does
[1:47:56] so it's a paradox it can't be
[1:47:59] but it is
[1:48:00] though it can't be
[1:48:04] it's impossible but it is
[1:48:06] but it's impossible
[1:48:08] but it is
[1:48:10] amen and so brother branham said it was
[1:48:12] a paradox in his day
[1:48:14] how that great god could be a man and be
[1:48:17] the same person he said and it's a
[1:48:19] paradox today
[1:48:21] see
[1:48:22] and so it's not something it's not like
[1:48:24] a theological lesson you're not going to
[1:48:26] go to a uh uh you know a
[1:48:28] white board and draw god out like a like
[1:48:31] a an einstein formula
[1:48:34] and that's not a mathematical equation
[1:48:36] he he he defies that he he
[1:48:39] exceeds that there's no way to it's the
[1:48:42] unsearchable riches
[1:48:44] here's what we know i was in him
[1:48:47] i believe him he's a part of me he lives
[1:48:49] in me lives through me and i've got a
[1:48:52] kingdom coming of which i'm going to be
[1:48:53] a part of
[1:48:56] see
[1:48:57] and so i know he's the very god he's not
[1:49:00] a second or third person so
[1:49:03] he is the beginning of the creation of
[1:49:05] god
[1:49:06] so the act as we said of creation his
[1:49:08] first movement in creation was to move
[1:49:11] forward from being that eternal being
[1:49:14] and he's going to move forward into an
[1:49:16] expression of light that could be seen
[1:49:19] brother branham says that could be
[1:49:20] something that could be seen now at the
[1:49:22] time there was nothing to even see
[1:49:25] so if a tree falls in a forest and
[1:49:27] there's no one there to hear it doesn't
[1:49:28] make a sound
[1:49:30] okay
[1:49:30] we're going in circles here but but he
[1:49:33] says there was
[1:49:34] he did that so something that could be
[1:49:36] seen so the so the pillar of fire the
[1:49:38] logos
[1:49:40] being the first expression in creation
[1:49:42] as i said takes the designation son so
[1:49:46] it's a title it's not his name his name
[1:49:48] is jesus so he comes now so by so by the
[1:49:51] time as we said last night by the time
[1:49:54] we get to jesus of nazareth
[1:49:57] god's plan of redemption is already way
[1:49:59] downstream
[1:50:01] he's been working on that
[1:50:03] for millennia across the ark of the old
[1:50:05] testament of time he every king every
[1:50:08] priest every prophet every warrior
[1:50:09] champion of faith it was all portraying
[1:50:11] what he would be the fullness of
[1:50:13] you see
[1:50:14] and so so we find then that that he he
[1:50:18] when he comes in his incarnation in his
[1:50:20] human in his humanity which he was not
[1:50:23] half god and half man
[1:50:25] you see beca because there was no
[1:50:27] instrumentation it wasn't uh it wasn't
[1:50:30] god's seed in mary's egg brother branham
[1:50:32] says that's a false teaching
[1:50:34] he was a complete spoken word
[1:50:37] see and so so we find that that that
[1:50:40] that when he comes into the earth he's
[1:50:43] he's literally a prototype of an entire
[1:50:46] word-born family he's a brand-new type
[1:50:50] of man
[1:50:51] see the he's the only
[1:50:54] begotten of the father why is he why
[1:50:57] does it say that because he's born of a
[1:50:59] woman
[1:51:01] see not he wasn't just spoken in decree
[1:51:03] it's not like melchizedek god does come
[1:51:06] took calcium potash cosmic light build a
[1:51:08] body and stepped into it
[1:51:09] built another one for an angel built
[1:51:11] another for an angel he comes to he
[1:51:13] comes to uh to to to adam adam's not
[1:51:15] born of a woman the first adam but this
[1:51:18] second atom is a prototype for the
[1:51:19] coming kingdom he's a brand new type of
[1:51:21] person understand now every person is
[1:51:24] coming to be exactly what he would
[1:51:26] become
[1:51:27] see
[1:51:28] and and and he came without sin to
[1:51:31] redeem you who were trapped in sin
[1:51:33] to take us all back to our sinless
[1:51:35] condition that we enjoyed before the
[1:51:38] world began only he wasn't a redeemer so
[1:51:41] now when we get back there we bring more
[1:51:43] honor to him because we needed savings
[1:51:50] see
[1:51:52] so when you wrap your mind around the
[1:51:54] unsealed truth
[1:51:56] that you are now
[1:51:58] a continuation
[1:52:00] of that same creation
[1:52:03] and you're headed toward a body say well
[1:52:05] i don't have a body like his you will
[1:52:08] you'll have a body even
[1:52:10] like an unto his glorious body
[1:52:14] so today then you have arrived
[1:52:17] today here we are
[1:52:19] february 2022
[1:52:21] and we have arrived at the stage of
[1:52:24] god's divine plan to become a family
[1:52:26] remember it's always better when you go
[1:52:28] back to genesis and and and and and you
[1:52:32] say well god created a family
[1:52:34] you'll do yourself a favor to realize
[1:52:37] that it's better thought of
[1:52:39] god became a family
[1:52:41] all right so he became a family because
[1:52:43] if you just think that through it's not
[1:52:45] difficult because remember brother
[1:52:47] branham said that that that we can't
[1:52:50] annihilate anything
[1:52:51] so you can even take a piece of paper
[1:52:54] and burn it say oh hi night lady said no
[1:52:56] you didn't all you did was turn it back
[1:52:58] to its previous gases
[1:53:00] he and brother brown said if time would
[1:53:02] go on long enough it could come back to
[1:53:04] paper again which means it came back to
[1:53:06] a tree again and got remanufactured and
[1:53:08] it's a sheet of paper
[1:53:09] so you understand so so in other words
[1:53:12] in other words when god was going to
[1:53:15] have a bride it wasn't just that he was
[1:53:18] going to just create something apart
[1:53:20] from himself like i mean the bible says
[1:53:23] he created hell for the devil and its
[1:53:27] angels it's not eternal
[1:53:30] remember the man said hell's not eternal
[1:53:31] it was it got created it had a time when
[1:53:34] it began had a time when it'll be done
[1:53:35] with it and he'll he'll disassemble it
[1:53:38] see so so god couldn't have a bride to
[1:53:41] where sometime if time went on long
[1:53:43] enough he'd finally have to do it again
[1:53:45] because she had come to an end he wasn't
[1:53:47] going to do it that way he was going to
[1:53:49] express a bride something from within
[1:53:52] him that would be a part of him as
[1:53:54] eternal as he is
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:59] see
[1:54:00] it's on this basis that god was able to
[1:54:03] justifiably dismiss all of satan's
[1:54:05] charges
[1:54:06] even though he had the goods it didn't
[1:54:07] count
[1:54:08] because satan was basically saying god
[1:54:10] you're guilty of sin when he's saying
[1:54:12] your bride is guilty of sin he's saying
[1:54:13] god is guilty of sin
[1:54:15] and that's
[1:54:16] upsets god
[1:54:18] so he's he doesn't even like to be
[1:54:20] limited you don't limit the god of
[1:54:22] israel much less accuse him of injustice
[1:54:24] israel tried that and god got pretty
[1:54:26] upset over that he told the prophet you
[1:54:28] go back and tell them they say i'm
[1:54:29] unjust i'm telling you you tell them i
[1:54:31] said they're the ones who are unjust
[1:54:33] they say i'm unfair they're the ones who
[1:54:35] are unfair and then god goes into this
[1:54:37] big uh way of proving it and kind of put
[1:54:40] everybody to silence and so
[1:54:42] we find then that that we have arrived
[1:54:44] at the stage
[1:54:46] of god's divine plan to become a family
[1:54:49] create a kingdom of royalty
[1:54:51] to rule and reign with him over the
[1:54:53] expanse of the universe which as we were
[1:54:56] saying the other day science now
[1:54:58] believes that that that the universe is
[1:55:00] likely even still expanding and they
[1:55:03] can't already can't find the parameters
[1:55:05] of it and they and i just said wonderful
[1:55:08] because
[1:55:09] an ever-expanding christ and an
[1:55:11] ever-expanding kingdom is going to need
[1:55:13] an ever-expanding universe because the
[1:55:15] bible says of the increase of his that's
[1:55:18] christ of the increase of his kingdom
[1:55:21] the increase
[1:55:23] there shall be no end it will never stop
[1:55:25] increasing
[1:55:27] oh we're headed somewhere friends
[1:55:29] i'm here to tell you
[1:55:30] your future is bright
[1:55:32] oh your future is bright
[1:55:35] a little while longer don't worry
[1:55:38] god's under control
[1:55:40] so so then so then this is the
[1:55:43] this is the greater
[1:55:45] meaning
[1:55:46] behind saying
[1:55:48] that you are and i've repeated it
[1:55:50] several times
[1:55:51] and so now i'm aiming to unpeel some
[1:55:54] more layers because i'm get i'm aiming
[1:55:56] at the greater meaning behind saying
[1:55:59] that you are the generation upon whom
[1:56:01] the ends of the world have come that is
[1:56:04] to say
[1:56:06] that it's not just about oh wow
[1:56:08] armageddon's coming that is that's just
[1:56:11] that's sure but that's a very shallow
[1:56:14] take on it first of all you're not even
[1:56:15] going to have to worry about armageddon
[1:56:18] so what's what's the point of god even
[1:56:20] saying that to his church at all see so
[1:56:22] what it what but the greater meaning of
[1:56:24] it is that when when i say you have
[1:56:27] arrived you are the generation upon whom
[1:56:30] the ends of the world have come you have
[1:56:32] arrived at the end of mankind's 6 000
[1:56:37] year journey in a fallen condition
[1:56:41] you are the generation you are the
[1:56:44] generation that will see the end of this
[1:56:48] 6 000 year journey
[1:56:50] you're the generation upon whom the ends
[1:56:53] have come the end of what the end of
[1:56:56] mankind in a fallen state the end of the
[1:56:58] earth in a fallen state
[1:57:00] we're not ever going to have to come
[1:57:02] back here and do this again
[1:57:04] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:07] oh my
[1:57:09] see not the end of the world world can
[1:57:11] end the world the world can't be
[1:57:13] annihilated it's an eternal attribute of
[1:57:15] god it's not the end of life
[1:57:17] you you're those upon whom the ends of
[1:57:19] the world have come not the end of life
[1:57:21] but a new beginning that will never
[1:57:24] end
[1:57:26] of the increase of the kingdom of jesus
[1:57:28] christ there shall be no end so this is
[1:57:32] the goal
[1:57:33] that he had
[1:57:35] from the beginning as we were reading to
[1:57:37] you
[1:57:39] the quotes from christ is the mystery of
[1:57:40] god revealed you've been studying it
[1:57:42] here
[1:57:43] and so this is the one goal
[1:57:45] that he had from the beginning
[1:57:48] and you yourself have arrived at this
[1:57:51] epic time
[1:57:53] in civilization
[1:57:54] see and
[1:57:56] the world is missing it
[1:57:59] they're missing it
[1:58:00] the most epic
[1:58:02] moment
[1:58:03] in human history and the world is as
[1:58:06] blind to it as a bat but blessed are
[1:58:10] your eyes for they see
[1:58:12] blessed are your ears for they hear i
[1:58:14] tell you many great prophets and sages
[1:58:16] even angels have desire to understand
[1:58:19] the things that are given into your
[1:58:20] hands today
[1:58:22] oh no wonder we rejoice no wonder we're
[1:58:25] happy in the lord
[1:58:27] oh my
[1:58:29] you know epic is a is an often overused
[1:58:32] word a lot of times its original meaning
[1:58:34] is lost be but epic actually is a long
[1:58:37] poem
[1:58:39] it's typically one derived from ancient
[1:58:42] oral tradition narrating the deeds and
[1:58:45] adventures of heroic
[1:58:48] hall of fame or legendary figures or the
[1:58:52] history of a nation
[1:58:55] and so it's a long poem it's a it's a
[1:58:58] long story it's a saga it's a chronicle
[1:59:02] of legendary figures see
[1:59:05] and this this is exactly why brother
[1:59:08] branham would use the word drama in
[1:59:10] shalom he says to god
[1:59:13] it's all a big drama and and you know
[1:59:17] how many times i mean god is loves drama
[1:59:20] oh god loves to watch our lives and
[1:59:22] sometimes we get ourselves in a fix and
[1:59:25] and we're praying out to god and the
[1:59:27] world's on fire around us and i'm
[1:59:29] sinking i'm going under the waves and
[1:59:31] and and the enemies the enemies hurling
[1:59:34] javelins at me and i uh lord i'm about
[1:59:36] to be destroyed and he'll just wait and
[1:59:39] wait and wait and wait till all hope is
[1:59:42] gone and then he'll come riding in
[1:59:45] oh champion
[1:59:48] grab his darling put her on his stallion
[1:59:50] slay the dragon fly off to glory
[1:59:54] he loves that he brother branham said he
[1:59:57] god puts you in situations on purpose to
[2:00:00] see how you react
[2:00:03] oh you wanted to say where's my hero
[2:00:06] where's my hero
[2:00:08] i'm in a drama and i need my hero
[2:00:12] oh legendary heroes all warriors all the
[2:00:16] prophets priests and kings were
[2:00:18] legendary all the warriors of faith were
[2:00:20] legendary and you are you are the
[2:00:23] standing army of the lord in this hour
[2:00:27] and we're writing a book of the
[2:00:29] chronicles of the book of acts we're
[2:00:31] writing a legendary book
[2:00:34] hallelujah
[2:00:36] a legendary book that will become part
[2:00:39] of the hall of fame of heaven
[2:00:45] now this one goal you still with me
[2:00:48] so this one goal
[2:00:51] that he had
[2:00:53] in all the bible
[2:00:57] let's revisit it again this morning
[2:01:00] first when brother branham talks about
[2:01:03] one goal
[2:01:05] he comes to the message the queen of
[2:01:07] sheba 1959
[2:01:10] and now
[2:01:11] the goal is
[2:01:14] kind of low altitude
[2:01:16] not very long looking
[2:01:18] it's it's it's uh noble
[2:01:20] watch watch how it goes
[2:01:23] he says it takes more
[2:01:25] than the power of gifts
[2:01:27] it takes more than joining a church
[2:01:30] it takes the birth of the holy spirit to
[2:01:33] break down our walls see now he's in
[2:01:36] he's in an interdenominational crowd
[2:01:38] and he's trying to stand in the middle
[2:01:40] and say we're all brothers trying to
[2:01:42] bring him together he says it's going to
[2:01:44] take more than gifts it'll take more
[2:01:45] than joining church it takes the birth
[2:01:47] of the holy spirit to break down our
[2:01:49] walls and to unite us together as one
[2:01:52] great christian body moving for one
[2:01:56] objective and one goal
[2:01:59] see
[2:02:00] now when he comes
[2:02:03] to christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:02:06] now he's at a whole different altitude
[2:02:09] this is an eagle flying through the mind
[2:02:10] of god
[2:02:12] and he says he has shown or revealed in
[2:02:14] every type that's in the bible therefore
[2:02:16] the entire bible is the revelation of
[2:02:18] god's mystery in christ he says
[2:02:20] the entire bible is an expression here
[2:02:23] we go again one goal that god had one
[2:02:27] purpose that he wanted to achieve in the
[2:02:29] entire bible so we notice in these two
[2:02:31] quotes
[2:02:33] that that the goal of the word
[2:02:36] has always had more in mind than just
[2:02:39] making us ecumenical
[2:02:43] you see it's had it's had a much grander
[2:02:46] purpose than that that that's it's noble
[2:02:48] to say as brother branham being a
[2:02:50] gentleman said we're all one but see
[2:02:52] brother brandon knew a secret brother
[2:02:54] branham knew if ever if everybody of all
[2:02:57] their different denominations of every
[2:02:58] one of them got a real new birth by the
[2:03:01] holy ghost that they'd immediately leave
[2:03:02] their denominations that we'd all be the
[2:03:04] big family of god
[2:03:06] see so he he knew that in his mind the
[2:03:08] holy ghost will produce his real church
[2:03:09] and it won't be a man-made thing
[2:03:13] but we find then that that you see the
[2:03:16] progression in 1959 his one goal is to
[2:03:19] try to get all the all the churches
[2:03:21] together and get born again now he's not
[2:03:23] trying to form the council he's trying
[2:03:25] to get him born again see and so and so
[2:03:28] but by the time he comes after the seals
[2:03:30] it the goal has broadened
[2:03:33] the plan of god means a whole lot more
[2:03:36] now now he's standing at a higher
[2:03:38] altitude looking at the whole plan of
[2:03:41] god from the from the dawn before the
[2:03:44] dawn of time till when time is no more
[2:03:47] and he sees it on this ark of life he
[2:03:49] sees it all playing out and the whole
[2:03:51] thing to brother branham he comes said
[2:03:53] oh it's just god has one goal if you
[2:03:56] only knew it's just one goal and then
[2:03:58] later on he'd say see you see it's all
[2:04:00] just a drama to god it's just all a
[2:04:02] drama he wrote it it comes from his mind
[2:04:06] and we're playing our part and you've
[2:04:08] arrived to this hour where you're
[2:04:09] playing your part a prophet saw you
[2:04:12] hallelujah see so so we find out that
[2:04:15] that sometimes we you know he
[2:04:18] we we wonder at his dealings with us but
[2:04:21] you must always remember that
[2:04:24] that god's goal is not just limited to
[2:04:26] human cooperation it's always been about
[2:04:29] coming into his vision of his expression
[2:04:32] see in the form of his eternal family
[2:04:35] he's trying to bring you to something
[2:04:39] this perspective is important
[2:04:42] because sometimes we wonder at his
[2:04:44] dealings in our life
[2:04:46] see
[2:04:47] we are
[2:04:49] down across many years and sometimes
[2:04:51] even decades and some of you who are
[2:04:53] very young have a hard time really
[2:04:56] appreciating this effectively but to us
[2:04:58] who have been fighting a long time
[2:05:01] covered a lot of ground
[2:05:03] covered a lot of years cried a lot of
[2:05:05] tears
[2:05:06] had to got knocked down and had to keep
[2:05:08] standing up because i'm just never going
[2:05:11] to not stand up
[2:05:13] amen i'm just going to dust myself off
[2:05:15] and go forward again
[2:05:17] and if i get knocked down again well
[2:05:19] i'll just stand back up dust myself off
[2:05:21] and go forward again i'm never stopping
[2:05:25] i'm never quitting
[2:05:27] i'm going forward
[2:05:29] ever forward
[2:05:33] sometimes things that happen in our life
[2:05:35] can often seem to make no sense to us
[2:05:37] and leave us wondering but he's never
[2:05:40] been merely trying to make you a better
[2:05:42] human being
[2:05:44] and that's what you've got to own today
[2:05:46] he's never been trying
[2:05:48] to make you just merely a better human
[2:05:51] being he's been honing you
[2:05:54] into a vision
[2:05:56] that he had of you before there was
[2:05:59] stardust
[2:06:01] so a lot of times you don't understand
[2:06:03] what's happening in your life because
[2:06:04] you don't see the ark the big
[2:06:06] perspective
[2:06:07] you don't see this has all been part of
[2:06:09] god's plan and he's not caught off guard
[2:06:11] by anything
[2:06:13] and he's not sidetracked even by your
[2:06:15] stumblings
[2:06:16] i mean he he promised david that that
[2:06:20] that through him the messiah would come
[2:06:22] promised jacob jacob was a a shyster and
[2:06:25] a liar and david was an adulterer and a
[2:06:27] liar and a murderer
[2:06:29] you understand did that stop messiah
[2:06:31] from coming no
[2:06:32] it didn't stop the promise of god you
[2:06:35] can't stop the promise of god
[2:06:37] let me tell you something friends if
[2:06:39] you're the gene seed of god you're going
[2:06:41] in a rapture and there's nothing you can
[2:06:43] do about it
[2:06:49] see so
[2:06:51] so he's he's often needed to move us
[2:06:54] into positions
[2:06:56] unexpected so that he can so that he can
[2:06:58] better mold you
[2:07:00] into the image
[2:07:02] and the order
[2:07:04] that he had of you before the foundation
[2:07:06] of the world you realize that this world
[2:07:09] that we live in presently
[2:07:11] and here's my title today
[2:07:13] the world we live in presently
[2:07:16] is a world
[2:07:17] between worlds
[2:07:20] scientists and science fiction and
[2:07:22] hollywood and everybody likes to make a
[2:07:23] big deal over multiverse and are there
[2:07:26] and there are there is multiverse but
[2:07:28] it's they don't understand it's just
[2:07:29] dimensions
[2:07:31] they don't understand it's just
[2:07:31] dimensions see
[2:07:33] and so god's not somewhere far off
[2:07:35] beyond alpha centauri or you know
[2:07:37] he he'd be not far from us all
[2:07:40] right the the promise of the holy ghost
[2:07:42] is that we would know no longer would
[2:07:45] anyone need to say hey can somebody get
[2:07:47] in a ship and sail across the sea and
[2:07:49] bring him back to us or can somebody go
[2:07:51] and take flight and go to heaven and
[2:07:52] bring him back down because he's nighty
[2:07:54] even in thy mouth see he's right here
[2:07:57] among us and so so you realize that we
[2:08:00] live presently in a world between worlds
[2:08:03] this is what jacob came to understand
[2:08:05] now a world
[2:08:07] where we were i want you to think about
[2:08:09] your first world
[2:08:11] here's your first multiverse
[2:08:13] it's a world
[2:08:15] where we were perfect
[2:08:17] in the mind of god
[2:08:18] we read about it in job's vision last
[2:08:20] night morning stars sang together and
[2:08:23] sons of god shouted for joy sinless
[2:08:26] perfection they had never
[2:08:28] fallen
[2:08:29] god had not been able to be a redeemer
[2:08:32] yet
[2:08:32] i understand this was his whole family
[2:08:35] and his mind
[2:08:36] projected in that form of his mind that
[2:08:38] is reality now
[2:08:40] you don't want to trap him you know
[2:08:42] limit and put god in a box to think
[2:08:44] your concept of reality is his all i can
[2:08:47] say is that a prophet said in his mind
[2:08:49] you existed
[2:08:51] and his thoughts are not exactly like
[2:08:53] yours you get a thought you actually
[2:08:55] gotta draw out blueprints and go build
[2:08:57] the thing but in god's mind it already
[2:08:59] exists
[2:09:01] his thoughts are actually already real
[2:09:03] in substance that's why faith is the
[2:09:05] substance
[2:09:06] it's not a mental thought it's not a
[2:09:08] hope for it's a substance
[2:09:13] so
[2:09:14] the first world
[2:09:15] was a world where we were perfect having
[2:09:18] never sinned
[2:09:19] existing in the mind of god in a state
[2:09:22] of absolute perfection paul speaks of
[2:09:24] this in various places in ephesians 1 4
[2:09:26] according as he hath chosen us in him
[2:09:29] before the foundation of the world
[2:09:31] before the foundation of the world
[2:09:33] before time was time you understand that
[2:09:36] we should be holy
[2:09:38] and without blame before him in love
[2:09:40] that was his determination before you
[2:09:43] got here
[2:09:44] and nothing you do here is going to undo
[2:09:47] that vision that he had of you see
[2:09:50] and so and so brother brandon picks it
[2:09:51] up in the c.a.b the the the and uh he
[2:09:55] says the choosing of the bride was
[2:09:57] purposed in himself he refers to
[2:09:59] ephesians 1 9 he refers to romans 9 11.
[2:10:02] it says that the purpose of god
[2:10:04] according to that the purpose of god
[2:10:06] according to election might stand see
[2:10:09] and brother brahm says you can't read it
[2:10:10] any other way
[2:10:12] the hard purpose
[2:10:14] the eternal purpose of god
[2:10:16] was to take a bride of his own choosing
[2:10:20] and that purpose was in himself
[2:10:23] and so he chose from within himself and
[2:10:26] being eternal was decreed before the
[2:10:30] foundation of the world so we see then
[2:10:33] in our first place in our first world we
[2:10:35] were perfect
[2:10:37] we were unmarred we were unfallen see
[2:10:41] but now it's interesting because if you
[2:10:43] go over into the book of revelation you
[2:10:46] find that you you you're many places i'm
[2:10:48] not going to track them all out today
[2:10:50] but the testimony that is constantly
[2:10:53] repeated you're constantly reading is
[2:10:55] you see a redeemed family in that world
[2:10:59] future
[2:11:00] there's a redeemed family who have been
[2:11:03] bought by the blood of the lamb who have
[2:11:05] overcome by the blood of the lamb who
[2:11:07] have been redeemed to god back to god
[2:11:10] amen so so there was this world
[2:11:14] where you were unfallen unmarred perfect
[2:11:16] in the mind of god there's this world
[2:11:18] going forward where you're going to be a
[2:11:20] redeemed people restored back
[2:11:22] so then that puts you in this world in
[2:11:25] the middle you say what's this world
[2:11:27] between those worlds this is the world
[2:11:30] where god would take that family and
[2:11:32] drop them into sin and take them through
[2:11:34] life and redeem their soul and bring
[2:11:36] them back to glory
[2:11:39] you're living in a world between worlds
[2:11:44] somebody asked me
[2:11:45] said
[2:11:46] so you don't believe in purgatory i said
[2:11:48] i sure do
[2:11:49] he said you do i said yeah i'm in it
[2:11:53] i mean now
[2:11:55] and i'm not going to give you any money
[2:11:56] to pray me out of it
[2:12:02] see so you see this let me just catch a
[2:12:04] few of these here's the bride revelation
[2:12:06] 5 9 brother branham identifies her said
[2:12:09] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[2:12:11] worthy to take the book and hope the
[2:12:12] seals thereof for thou slain has
[2:12:13] redeemed us
[2:12:15] to god by the blood out of every kindred
[2:12:17] tongue and people and nation you see in
[2:12:19] revelation 14 you see the hundred forty
[2:12:21] four thousand and they sung as it were a
[2:12:23] new song before the throne before the
[2:12:24] four beasts and the elders and no man
[2:12:26] could learn that song but the hundred
[2:12:28] forty four thousand which were redeemed
[2:12:31] from the earth so a world that now is
[2:12:34] where we were born in a fallen condition
[2:12:37] and at some point at some point uh
[2:12:40] brought back to god through the power of
[2:12:43] the holy ghost in a supernatural rebirth
[2:12:46] see
[2:12:48] so powerful
[2:12:50] is this new birth
[2:12:53] that you are reckoned as one
[2:12:55] sitting right now
[2:12:57] in heavenly places with christ jesus
[2:13:01] and brother branham said it takes the
[2:13:02] sinner and puts him back across the
[2:13:04] chasm
[2:13:05] back across that he couldn't get over
[2:13:07] that chasm christ bridged it and now the
[2:13:10] blood of christ puts the man back across
[2:13:12] the chasm sitting together in heavenly
[2:13:14] places he explains that in in in
[2:13:18] god hidden and revealed in simplicity
[2:13:20] and talks about it a little more in the
[2:13:21] breach
[2:13:23] and so so we realized then that
[2:13:26] you know now look at this position
[2:13:28] because if you think about david all
[2:13:31] right
[2:13:32] when when david when samuel i just want
[2:13:34] to show you what i just said in this as
[2:13:36] a principle in the bible when you go to
[2:13:38] david's anointing and samuel comes and
[2:13:41] and i'm here to anoint a son king and he
[2:13:43] lines up the hole and samuel thinks it's
[2:13:45] got to be this first one he's big tall
[2:13:47] dark and handsome god says no and
[2:13:48] rejected him okay well number two no not
[2:13:51] him either three no four no five no
[2:13:54] goes all the way down the line no no no
[2:13:56] no you got any more sons well i i do but
[2:13:59] he's kind of a
[2:14:01] i mean he's not really
[2:14:03] yeah he's just a scrawny little guy out
[2:14:05] here he's good for tending my sheep and
[2:14:07] that's about it
[2:14:09] and he says bring him to me and because
[2:14:11] god had already warned the prophet don't
[2:14:13] don't look at it like humans do
[2:14:15] i don't look at it like you do see
[2:14:18] and god saw a purpose in this in this
[2:14:20] david coming and he he had david out
[2:14:23] there learning how to be a king see
[2:14:26] and he he had him out there learning
[2:14:28] these things and so that brother branham
[2:14:30] said that's where he learned to write
[2:14:31] still waters and he leadeth me besides
[2:14:33] still waters and david and you know he
[2:14:35] he restores my soul and he said he was a
[2:14:37] man of the of the wilderness he wrote
[2:14:39] like that and so
[2:14:41] so we find that he anoints him king and
[2:14:44] it's it's interesting because brother
[2:14:46] branham says in the great warrior david
[2:14:49] he says notice
[2:14:50] he right then
[2:14:52] when that anointing struck him he was
[2:14:55] positionally placed as a king
[2:14:59] right there
[2:15:00] and it'd be a long time before he ever
[2:15:01] sat on a throne and stood under a crown
[2:15:04] amen
[2:15:05] and so we find that that that he samuel
[2:15:08] poured the oil on his head and and said
[2:15:10] god has called you to be a king and
[2:15:12] right there before he's ever a king in
[2:15:15] god's mind he's already positionally
[2:15:18] placed brother branham says amen you are
[2:15:21] placed positionally in christ jesus as
[2:15:25] kings and priests
[2:15:26] is that right i ask you is that right
[2:15:30] the moment you receive the holy spirit
[2:15:33] god places you in the kingdom and air
[2:15:38] hallelujah i'm an heir of god i'm a
[2:15:40] joint heir with christ
[2:15:43] what a beautiful picture brother branham
[2:15:44] says there you are
[2:15:46] so the message then came to us
[2:15:49] for the purpose of calling the elect out
[2:15:52] of the ecumenical group
[2:15:54] to join with the word to be part of the
[2:15:57] end-time bride that's what the message
[2:16:00] came to do that is the message
[2:16:03] is revelation 18 4.
[2:16:05] malachi 4 speaks of the messenger the
[2:16:07] anointing he'll be under revelation 10
[2:16:09] places him where he is in the in the
[2:16:12] hierarchical order of god unveiling
[2:16:13] himself but revelation 18 4 is the
[2:16:16] message come out of her
[2:16:18] my people
[2:16:19] and so we find that this revealed word
[2:16:22] of the hour
[2:16:24] restores us to the kind of faith that
[2:16:27] can mold us
[2:16:28] and it can shape us and it can make us
[2:16:30] ready for the body change you can't do
[2:16:32] it
[2:16:34] you're too strong for you you're too
[2:16:36] much in your own way you've got to let
[2:16:38] god come and do it
[2:16:42] so we find then that that this revealed
[2:16:45] word is what is what do what does it it
[2:16:47] makes us ready because faith comes by
[2:16:49] hearing right
[2:16:50] i was speaking to a man one time he was
[2:16:52] starting to look at the message and
[2:16:54] and i
[2:16:55] you know he just was struggling and
[2:16:57] everybody's trying to church is trying
[2:16:58] to witness to him people friends trying
[2:17:00] to witness to him and i just waited and
[2:17:01] i just waited kept praying until finally
[2:17:03] the lord showed me what his problem was
[2:17:05] and then i went to see him and we sat
[2:17:07] down and i already knew it's kind of you
[2:17:09] feel a little bit a little bit like
[2:17:10] jacob because you already got the answer
[2:17:12] and you're playing coy with him
[2:17:14] and i already knew what the answer was i
[2:17:16] know what his problem was
[2:17:17] and uh and i just kept guiding the
[2:17:19] conversation because i wanted him to say
[2:17:21] it
[2:17:21] and he got to the point
[2:17:24] where his problem was that he loved the
[2:17:26] doctor and he loved the teaching but
[2:17:28] this whole thing of the badger skin this
[2:17:29] prophet he couldn't seem to get past a
[2:17:31] prophet why don't god have a prophet i
[2:17:33] got my bible i got the holy ghost i got
[2:17:34] prayer god god got jesus what are you
[2:17:36] the prophet it's common it's a fair
[2:17:38] argument see
[2:17:40] and so i knew that was his issue and so
[2:17:43] i just kind of guided the conversation
[2:17:45] and finally
[2:17:46] you know you but you love you believe oh
[2:17:48] yes it's so wonderful i never heard
[2:17:49] anything like it but and i said well you
[2:17:52] know what's what's the
[2:17:53] well go ahead and say it just say what
[2:17:56] it is
[2:17:57] just i'm ready for you to say it and he
[2:18:00] said well you know this whole thing
[2:18:01] about a prophet
[2:18:03] and i said oh
[2:18:04] is that all
[2:18:06] i said goodness friend i said you don't
[2:18:09] have to believe in a prophet to go to
[2:18:11] heaven
[2:18:12] he said
[2:18:13] i don't i said no he said what about
[2:18:16] william branham i said you don't have to
[2:18:17] believe william branham was a prophet at
[2:18:19] all to go to heaven to go to heaven you
[2:18:21] have to accept the atonement of jesus
[2:18:22] christ at calvary
[2:18:25] see because i had secret intel
[2:18:27] i had the seventh seal where brother
[2:18:29] branham is talking about the foolish
[2:18:30] virgin
[2:18:31] and they end up in heaven but they go in
[2:18:33] a tribulation for their sin of unbelief
[2:18:36] and rejecting the message
[2:18:38] but they're but they're they're that
[2:18:40] remember the virgin even though they're
[2:18:42] unwise that you don't correlate them to
[2:18:44] the harlot daughters of revelation
[2:18:47] they're not the harley daughters they
[2:18:48] are virgins they are righteous they are
[2:18:50] saints and the kings shall say to the
[2:18:54] righteous matthew 25 and the righteous
[2:18:56] shall say to the king see and so they
[2:18:59] were sanctified living people they had
[2:19:02] brother adam said they're not saved in
[2:19:03] the tribulation they're already saved
[2:19:05] from destruction that's me adding that
[2:19:07] just for clarity they're not saved in
[2:19:10] the tribulation they're already saved
[2:19:12] but they have to go in the tribulation
[2:19:13] to receive their purging
[2:19:16] because they rejected the truth but
[2:19:17] they're virgins and they'll be now they
[2:19:19] won't make the millennium they'll
[2:19:21] they'll have to stay under the altar and
[2:19:23] god's got
[2:19:24] various places under the altar but but
[2:19:26] after the millennium they'll come up for
[2:19:28] the judgment and they'll come into
[2:19:29] eternal life and be granted eternal life
[2:19:33] the very fact that they're at the
[2:19:35] judgment bar
[2:19:36] shows they don't have eternal life
[2:19:38] because if they did they'd be seated
[2:19:40] with us on the throne
[2:19:43] that they're being judged shows they
[2:19:44] don't they were never born again see
[2:19:48] so you can have the holy ghost on your
[2:19:50] flesh go straight to hell
[2:19:52] you can have it anointing your spirit go
[2:19:54] straight to hell
[2:19:56] it has to contact the gene of god and
[2:19:58] come to life and annihilate an old
[2:20:00] nature and you become a new creation in
[2:20:03] christ jesus
[2:20:04] [Applause]
[2:20:06] and then it's like paul tried to explain
[2:20:08] although it's difficult in human
[2:20:10] language paul kept saying i i i'm alive
[2:20:14] but i i'm i'm not alive
[2:20:17] okay what is it paul well i'm i live but
[2:20:19] uh i i'm not alive i don't live but i
[2:20:23] live but but i don't live
[2:20:25] please paul cut to the chase okay here
[2:20:27] it is i i live but i but i don't live
[2:20:31] it's not me it's christ who lives inside
[2:20:33] me
[2:20:34] i died my old life old things are passed
[2:20:38] away all things have become new
[2:20:44] so we find then so then there i am armed
[2:20:46] with that intelligence
[2:20:48] and i said oh goodness
[2:20:50] you don't have to
[2:20:51] you don't have to believe william
[2:20:52] branham was a prophet
[2:20:53] he said i don't i said no
[2:20:56] not at all i said uh
[2:21:00] i said you can you can still go to
[2:21:01] heaven he said really i can and when i
[2:21:03] say that he just kind of relaxed
[2:21:06] and he lowered his shields
[2:21:09] and i bulls-eyed him
[2:21:12] and i said
[2:21:14] but now of course
[2:21:15] faith comes by hearing
[2:21:18] and hearing comes by the word
[2:21:21] so in order to go on a rapture i said
[2:21:23] now you're going to need rapturing faith
[2:21:27] and
[2:21:28] since rapturing faith you're going to
[2:21:30] need a rapture word
[2:21:32] and if you need a rapture word well we
[2:21:34] better talk about a prophet
[2:21:38] [Applause]
[2:21:45] all right won the day
[2:21:47] amen we won the field drove the enemy
[2:21:48] off
[2:21:49] so the nine the 1963 opening of the
[2:21:52] seven sealed mystery was to show us
[2:21:55] how that god redeemed the souls of his
[2:21:58] family through the ages and
[2:22:01] the power of the spirit that worked
[2:22:03] through those ages remember now the
[2:22:06] advantage is because we're at the omega
[2:22:08] we're at the last because remember he if
[2:22:10] you go in the book of revelation you
[2:22:12] always find him saying first and last
[2:22:13] alpha omega
[2:22:15] and he doesn't really say much about the
[2:22:16] middle
[2:22:17] it's always first and last alpha and
[2:22:20] omega and there's not a lot said about
[2:22:21] the middle
[2:22:22] and it's puzzling until you go you have
[2:22:24] to have a profit to untie that and
[2:22:27] brother branham explains it to say he
[2:22:29] said just imagine the the menorah the
[2:22:32] seven lamp stands and he said picture if
[2:22:34] you will jesus is walking in the midst
[2:22:36] of the seven lamp stands and he has his
[2:22:38] hands outstretched to the first stage
[2:22:40] and the last age he's the alpha the
[2:22:43] omega the first and the last the reason
[2:22:46] it doesn't say a whole lot about the
[2:22:48] middle is because while he was in the
[2:22:50] middle
[2:22:51] john saw him walking through the seven
[2:22:53] lamp stands he was always with the
[2:22:55] church he said i'll never leave you see
[2:22:58] so while he was while jesus was in the
[2:23:01] middle not everything in the middle was
[2:23:04] him
[2:23:05] because it had been mongrelized and and
[2:23:08] and denominations and creeds of man had
[2:23:10] mingled with it and made a mongrelized
[2:23:14] word so the promise was when i get to
[2:23:16] the omega it'll be the same as the alpha
[2:23:20] and i'm going to undo all of this
[2:23:22] mongrelizing and i'm going to bring back
[2:23:24] a pure word to my bride
[2:23:27] see
[2:23:29] so we find that that that's the final
[2:23:33] you know the final taking it has to be
[2:23:35] that way friends because the final when
[2:23:38] he claims the book you you have to
[2:23:40] remember that
[2:23:41] god is not coming back to rapture your
[2:23:45] bible
[2:23:49] this is the third iteration
[2:23:51] of god's word the first iteration was in
[2:23:53] the stars
[2:23:55] he wrote that one long before he wrote
[2:23:56] this one then he wrote another one in
[2:23:58] enoch's pyramid that was the second
[2:24:00] iteration this is the third one there's
[2:24:02] coming another one you know what former
[2:24:04] to be it'll be behind skin
[2:24:06] he's not coming to rapture a bible he's
[2:24:09] coming to rapture people who have become
[2:24:11] the bible
[2:24:13] who have become the living word
[2:24:15] you've been returned back in god's great
[2:24:18] drama
[2:24:20] see
[2:24:24] so
[2:24:25] that's exactly why it makes perfect
[2:24:27] sense all the visions and dreams brother
[2:24:29] branham had even when he tore the the
[2:24:31] capstone off and it's white stone and
[2:24:34] of course it would be there's no writing
[2:24:35] of course there wouldn't be
[2:24:37] because this mystery is going to be
[2:24:38] written behind skin it's not going to be
[2:24:39] on tables of stone the white stone was a
[2:24:41] new name
[2:24:43] see in in the white stone is a new name
[2:24:45] and brother branham said the word
[2:24:47] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[2:24:49] name of god now how does god interpret
[2:24:51] his word he brings it to pass
[2:24:54] so it's not going to be written in stone
[2:24:55] it's going to be written behind skin
[2:24:58] it's going to be a living church a
[2:25:01] living bride the final voice to the
[2:25:03] final age
[2:25:05] this is jesus christ
[2:25:08] see
[2:25:09] so it all makes perfect sense it all
[2:25:11] lines up perfectly
[2:25:14] see
[2:25:15] so a world between worlds
[2:25:19] a world between worlds
[2:25:22] that we call life now
[2:25:25] the term life
[2:25:27] you know let's look at it in a minute
[2:25:29] for a minute in the
[2:25:31] in the light of god's meaning
[2:25:34] how we doing
[2:25:36] okay i haven't got an alarm yet i
[2:25:38] i'm always careful wearing my
[2:25:40] apple watch when i preach at home i have
[2:25:42] a dress watch when i travel i don't take
[2:25:44] it and i take my apple watch so many
[2:25:46] times i'll get to preach and get wound
[2:25:47] up and get jumping and screaming and
[2:25:49] waving my arms like a madman
[2:25:51] and and i'll get a buzz and i'll look
[2:25:52] down it's a good thing because she's
[2:25:54] about to call 9-1-1
[2:25:55] and she do you need an ambulance i think
[2:25:58] i think she thinks i'm being killed
[2:26:00] and and so she's trying to call no i'm
[2:26:03] fine be quiet don't interrupt me
[2:26:06] and so i changed some settings recently
[2:26:09] hopefully i've avoided that last night i
[2:26:11] think i would have set her off and i
[2:26:12] didn't so we might be good
[2:26:14] amen so
[2:26:16] so we find then that
[2:26:18] that we're very often you know too often
[2:26:21] times
[2:26:22] we use the term life much too loosely
[2:26:25] we do we use the term life to describe
[2:26:27] many things and i'm not going to go into
[2:26:29] a laundry list today i'm just going to
[2:26:31] hit it as an overview but you hear it
[2:26:33] all the time this is my life
[2:26:35] you know uh that's your life you you
[2:26:37] live your life as we're saying last
[2:26:39] night do you i'll do me leave me alone
[2:26:41] i'll make all my i i said a girl one
[2:26:44] time we were preaching uh goodness where
[2:26:47] was i at we were in uh
[2:26:49] we were in the ukraine of all places
[2:26:52] and uh we were had a family camp there
[2:26:54] and uh the office where we had to go was
[2:26:57] a business office his only place we
[2:26:58] could call out and send emails and stuff
[2:27:00] and this young lady and we kept coming
[2:27:02] up she knew we were ministers you know
[2:27:03] devils are just disrespectful
[2:27:05] and
[2:27:06] and on purpose
[2:27:08] and
[2:27:08] yeah for real
[2:27:10] and and
[2:27:11] when we come in there finally she tries
[2:27:12] to start up a you know started chat me
[2:27:15] up and say uh oh you know she's bragging
[2:27:17] about her night on the town how she
[2:27:19] partied and it's just
[2:27:20] 20-something-year-old woman and and she
[2:27:23] just oh she got drunk and she had some
[2:27:24] friends and she had a good time
[2:27:26] and uh and i just and i thought goodness
[2:27:28] gracious she knows i'm a minister and i
[2:27:30] say and i start to speak to her about
[2:27:32] the lord
[2:27:33] and immediately
[2:27:34] when she saw that her allurements
[2:27:36] weren't getting to first base and i just
[2:27:38] want to talk about the lord immediately
[2:27:40] she puts up a wall and she just threw up
[2:27:41] her hand it's my life
[2:27:44] spoke broken english my life
[2:27:48] and
[2:27:49] i i i just i said to her i said sister
[2:27:52] who in the world told you that
[2:27:56] it's my life i said no it's not your
[2:27:58] life
[2:27:59] did you get it
[2:28:00] can you keep it
[2:28:04] it's not your life
[2:28:07] see
[2:28:08] but we use that term it's my life
[2:28:10] it's your life
[2:28:12] it's their life live and let live but
[2:28:15] rarely does a person and particularly a
[2:28:17] lot of times young people because of
[2:28:18] their lack of experience
[2:28:20] especially young people
[2:28:24] fail to grasp the true reality that it's
[2:28:27] actually his life
[2:28:29] lent to you for a purpose
[2:28:32] see
[2:28:33] it's not your life you didn't get it
[2:28:36] can't keep it
[2:28:37] see
[2:28:38] and that's why everything that has
[2:28:40] breath should praise the lord
[2:28:42] oh oh mays jackson the truck driver's
[2:28:44] special do you ever hear him brother
[2:28:46] david on the radio
[2:28:47] a truck driver special old maze jackson
[2:28:49] and he is to say i'll tell you friends
[2:28:51] the bible says let everything that has
[2:28:54] oh baptist preacher let everything that
[2:28:56] has breath praise the lord if you're not
[2:28:58] going to praise the lord stop breathing
[2:29:03] i said amen
[2:29:07] hey man i've repeated that around the
[2:29:09] world
[2:29:10] that's the one piece of baptist doctrine
[2:29:12] i agree with
[2:29:17] but rarely you know do we do we catch
[2:29:21] do we really take hold of the true
[2:29:23] reality that it's all his life given to
[2:29:26] you for a purpose and a grand purpose
[2:29:28] may suggest a grand purpose see as we've
[2:29:30] been speaking on and and this is why
[2:29:33] this is exactly why we gather young
[2:29:34] people to try to to try to our desires
[2:29:38] to impart years of wisdom to you to hope
[2:29:40] that that our mistakes can be stepping
[2:29:43] stones for you to say don't step there
[2:29:45] there's a pitfall you'll twist an ankle
[2:29:47] don't do that go around see and and and
[2:29:50] as we've as we've been learning that's
[2:29:52] why you know there's value as the bible
[2:29:55] talks about in the age then the council
[2:29:57] of of aged men and soul you know these
[2:29:59] are things that we've learned through
[2:30:00] observation through many uh trials and
[2:30:04] errors living life and learning from it
[2:30:07] and you know it's true
[2:30:10] that you do have to live your own life
[2:30:12] and you do have to make your own choice
[2:30:14] i can't make it for you
[2:30:16] see i i i'm not you know uh
[2:30:21] myself you know to accept the plan of
[2:30:24] god
[2:30:25] and to come to know him by the power of
[2:30:27] the holy ghost that's a decision i made
[2:30:30] that's a decision you've got to make i
[2:30:33] i'm not here you know to tell you what
[2:30:36] choice to make i'm only here to tell you
[2:30:38] you have a choice
[2:30:40] amen don't let the devil tell you that
[2:30:42] you don't see and so but all we can do
[2:30:45] myself a pastor
[2:30:47] parents mentors all they can do is guide
[2:30:50] you to him brother branham talks about
[2:30:53] it time and eternity blending together
[2:30:56] he talks about it many places how can i
[2:30:59] overcome we have seen a star in the east
[2:31:01] and have come to worship him who do you
[2:31:03] say this is and and he talks about the
[2:31:06] blending of time and eternity and we
[2:31:08] oftentimes much too narrowly think of
[2:31:10] that as just you know we sing the song
[2:31:12] terry tidwell wrote i'll speed up and
[2:31:15] they'll slow down there is a land
[2:31:19] remember that there is a land
[2:31:21] i'm homesick for and we we talk about
[2:31:24] i'll speed up they'll slow down time
[2:31:26] will blend with eternity
[2:31:28] but brother branham i'm not going to
[2:31:29] take all the time to read these quotes
[2:31:31] brother branham is going to explain that
[2:31:33] the greatest
[2:31:34] form
[2:31:36] the reason that's going to happen
[2:31:38] is because right now it's it's an
[2:31:41] eternal god trying to blend with you in
[2:31:44] time
[2:31:45] he's trying to blend it's it's the it's
[2:31:47] the holy spirit blending eternity with
[2:31:50] time you're stuck in time he's in
[2:31:52] eternity and the whole purpose of the
[2:31:55] holy ghost is to give you a blended life
[2:31:58] and that's why brother branham would say
[2:31:59] as much of the world as you can take out
[2:32:01] he'll come in and fill that
[2:32:03] and he'll feel that and he'll feel that
[2:32:05] and that's why paul said i want you to
[2:32:06] be have all the fullness
[2:32:08] i want you to be filled with all the
[2:32:11] fullness
[2:32:12] of the knowledge of god not just data
[2:32:15] not just theology but his experience see
[2:32:19] you learn by experience it far
[2:32:20] supersedes book learning so so we find
[2:32:23] then that he it is who gave you life and
[2:32:26] he's the only one who can blend life
[2:32:29] with
[2:32:30] blend you with him now
[2:32:33] so so
[2:32:35] when we begin to look at our life all
[2:32:38] right
[2:32:39] and if the time of your life
[2:32:42] expires before his return
[2:32:46] then he alone
[2:32:48] he alone is the only one who can give
[2:32:49] you eternal life now
[2:32:51] and change you
[2:32:53] at the rapture
[2:32:54] he alone that if you if your life
[2:32:56] expires before the rapture he's the only
[2:33:00] one who can call you from the grave
[2:33:03] so the so the purpose just remember that
[2:33:06] whenever you hear brother branham say
[2:33:07] time and eternity will blend just
[2:33:08] remember yeah that's right that's going
[2:33:11] to happen because he's blending heaven
[2:33:13] and earth are blending now
[2:33:16] see
[2:33:17] see
[2:33:18] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[2:33:20] be thy name
[2:33:21] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[2:33:24] in this earth
[2:33:26] as it is in heaven
[2:33:28] make this man look like that man
[2:33:30] make this vision look like that vision
[2:33:33] bring me to look like him i want to stop
[2:33:36] being me i want to be like him
[2:33:39] i'm going to tell you something friends
[2:33:40] i cannot get my mind around anyone who
[2:33:43] would ever see a vision of jesus and
[2:33:46] want to remain themselves
[2:33:48] once i saw the lord and all of his glory
[2:33:50] and all of his beauty i didn't want to
[2:33:52] be me anymore i was tired of being me i
[2:33:55] wanted to be him
[2:33:57] hallelujah
[2:34:00] he'll raise you from the dead i promise
[2:34:02] you'll never die again
[2:34:05] now
[2:34:07] can i get to my text
[2:34:11] i just need 10 more minutes all right so
[2:34:13] don't don't panic
[2:34:15] you'll be all right just breathe you'll
[2:34:17] be fine
[2:34:20] few mortals friends few mortals
[2:34:23] were ever given such an opportunity
[2:34:25] at so young in age
[2:34:27] to view the true multiverse as jacob did
[2:34:31] he's laying there on the earth
[2:34:35] and there's a ladder attached with its
[2:34:37] feet on the earth
[2:34:39] and the top is attached to heaven
[2:34:41] and it's so steady that angels are
[2:34:43] ascending and descending
[2:34:45] and then he looks and sees the lord
[2:34:47] standing at the head of it
[2:34:49] looking down on his life
[2:34:51] and talking to him
[2:34:53] he saw heaven above
[2:34:55] and the earth and he he's standing and
[2:34:58] here he is on the earth he lives on the
[2:35:00] earth just beneath and here's this
[2:35:02] ladder and and and and he's literally
[2:35:05] living
[2:35:06] at that moment tell the president i
[2:35:08] can't talk right now i'm preaching amen
[2:35:10] tell him i'll call him later
[2:35:13] we find that that here he is
[2:35:15] he's living in a multi-world reality
[2:35:19] and
[2:35:20] suddenly
[2:35:22] more clear
[2:35:23] it's more clear to jacob
[2:35:25] than ever before in all of his life he
[2:35:27] had heard all the stories of his grandpa
[2:35:29] he'd heard the stories of his prophet
[2:35:31] daddy he had been raised in message
[2:35:33] homes but now he's experiencing you mean
[2:35:36] this is real
[2:35:38] oh yes
[2:35:39] it's real this ain't just a story i'm
[2:35:42] you haven't believed cunningly devised
[2:35:45] tales you haven't been turned from truth
[2:35:47] to fables this is the logos this is the
[2:35:50] word this is the truth this is god
[2:35:53] see
[2:35:54] a world between worlds
[2:35:57] is this life a very narrow span spurgeon
[2:36:00] called it
[2:36:02] a very narrow span of mortal existence
[2:36:06] between eternal realms
[2:36:09] for you and i friends uh we're here in
[2:36:11] this in this eternal in this little
[2:36:14] narrow span between eternal realms of a
[2:36:17] previous existence
[2:36:19] and the realities of god's mind and
[2:36:22] we've been unfolded into an expression
[2:36:24] and and someday we're going to be in
[2:36:27] that perfect expression in the eternal
[2:36:29] ages to come in the former existence in
[2:36:32] the mind of god you weren't lost in the
[2:36:35] world to come according to revelation
[2:36:37] you stand redeemed in god and so now we
[2:36:40] see a further application this is why
[2:36:44] brother branham would call it a future
[2:36:47] application of the hidden manna now it
[2:36:50] had an application in the pergaming age
[2:36:51] but brother brandon said it also has a
[2:36:53] future application and he said it will
[2:36:55] be the eternal unfolding of the
[2:36:57] revelation of jesus christ and the
[2:36:59] eternal ages to come
[2:37:01] brother brown says how else do you make
[2:37:03] the scripture fit his unsearchable
[2:37:05] riches see
[2:37:07] so so so now you're seeing friends that
[2:37:10] if i started somewhere and i can already
[2:37:12] see i'm going somewhere then how could i
[2:37:16] not acknowledge that
[2:37:17] that i'm here
[2:37:19] on the move
[2:37:22] you say what's the significance of that
[2:37:24] i'm not just here
[2:37:27] i'm on the move
[2:37:29] i'm headed somewhere i'm living by a
[2:37:32] purpose i came for a purpose i'm here
[2:37:36] literally being brought into the image
[2:37:38] of god's vision that he had of me before
[2:37:41] the foundation of the world
[2:37:47] so between there and the eternity's past
[2:37:50] and the eternity's future
[2:37:51] reality
[2:37:53] something has happened and what happened
[2:37:54] is is that you came through a fallen
[2:37:57] birth you're going to be redeemed back
[2:37:59] now we call it the past and we call it
[2:38:00] the future but both of those words
[2:38:02] really past and future really are
[2:38:05] actually kind of incompatible with the
[2:38:07] term eternities see because the only
[2:38:09] context they in fact is when you once
[2:38:12] you conclude that that the only context
[2:38:14] that they could apply would be by
[2:38:16] comparison you know of mortality and a
[2:38:20] span of linear time that's the only way
[2:38:21] it even makes sense that's the only way
[2:38:23] i can even call that past
[2:38:25] because to god it's not past and that's
[2:38:27] not future it's all right now
[2:38:30] that's what brother branham experienced
[2:38:32] he tried to explain it when he came back
[2:38:33] from beyond the curtain of time he said
[2:38:35] it there is no yesterday there is no
[2:38:38] tomorrow you you've just arrived it's
[2:38:40] just it's just all of it
[2:38:42] see
[2:38:43] because that and he's struggling you can
[2:38:45] hear him struggling on the tape trying
[2:38:46] to find the words i don't have the words
[2:38:48] now he doesn't have any problem
[2:38:49] describing what he saw he doesn't have
[2:38:51] any problem describing what he heard but
[2:38:53] what he couldn't describe is how he felt
[2:38:56] see
[2:38:56] he couldn't get his mind he said i don't
[2:38:58] have enough language and so
[2:39:01] what i can tell you is that brother
[2:39:03] branham would refer to this life and and
[2:39:06] correlate it through a type when he's
[2:39:08] preaching flashing red light and really
[2:39:10] brother branham is trying to get you to
[2:39:12] understand this life is just a whistle
[2:39:14] stop
[2:39:16] as spurgeon said it's just a narrow
[2:39:18] little span you'll soon be acrostid
[2:39:22] why why did he say
[2:39:24] my my question becomes to you young
[2:39:26] people
[2:39:27] then why would you chase
[2:39:29] and put all your energies into something
[2:39:32] that's just a narrow span and it's just
[2:39:34] a whistle stop anyway
[2:39:35] and the only purpose this isn't life i'm
[2:39:38] i came from life i'm going to life
[2:39:41] see the only real life is god's life and
[2:39:43] the only real purpose is god's purpose
[2:39:45] because that's the only thing that's
[2:39:47] eternal hallelujah thank god we're
[2:39:50] living for a real purpose today
[2:39:52] so i don't chase it that's why jesus
[2:39:54] said don't lay up treasures here where
[2:39:55] thieves can break in and rust and moth
[2:39:57] can take it lay your treasures up in
[2:39:59] heaven
[2:40:01] it's just a narrow span you'll soon be a
[2:40:03] cross it means almost no well you say oh
[2:40:06] let me tell you all this life is is a
[2:40:08] training grounds
[2:40:10] it's just a training field it's a
[2:40:12] proving grounds you're just here come
[2:40:15] and fallen redeemed back to god and now
[2:40:17] you're set on the path to head to glory
[2:40:20] and god is now saying well why brother
[2:40:22] jason
[2:40:23] my goodness my life and this happened
[2:40:25] and this happened this happened and i
[2:40:26] look at my friend over here and this
[2:40:28] didn't ever happen to her that she'd
[2:40:30] have to go through that and why did i
[2:40:31] have to you know and here's another
[2:40:33] friend yeah brother jason you understand
[2:40:35] what i had to go through and here's a
[2:40:36] body of mine he didn't have to go
[2:40:37] through now i say look
[2:40:39] first of all
[2:40:40] you don't know what you'll be on the
[2:40:41] other side
[2:40:42] but he does
[2:40:44] see and he's got to have you ready here
[2:40:47] for your rulership there
[2:40:49] so how about you just let him be the
[2:40:51] captain
[2:40:52] how about you just let him guide the
[2:40:53] ship
[2:40:54] how about you just when you hear those
[2:40:56] as brother branham said you might be
[2:40:58] standing there reading the paper eating
[2:40:59] your peanuts and and people milling
[2:41:01] around he said but buddy when those bars
[2:41:04] come down and those lights and those
[2:41:05] bells ding ding ding ding ding ding he
[2:41:07] said you better throw those peanuts down
[2:41:09] you better put away that newspaper you
[2:41:11] better grab your bags because this
[2:41:12] thing's only stopping for a moment
[2:41:14] and you better be ready to get on board
[2:41:17] see
[2:41:20] so we find then that brother brandon
[2:41:22] when he actually drew it he drew a
[2:41:24] circle uh referring to eternity and at
[2:41:27] the bottom he he kind of drew this
[2:41:29] little
[2:41:31] you know and right at the bottom just
[2:41:32] like a little loop down he's coming
[2:41:34] around his eternal circle and he's
[2:41:36] preaching it to his church and he gets
[2:41:38] right here and he goes okay
[2:41:40] and then back up into it and he said now
[2:41:43] my wife mita she said bill that kind of
[2:41:46] looks like a hickey now that's an old
[2:41:47] southern term i i don't know if y'all
[2:41:49] know what that means it's
[2:41:51] it's like a duma flitzy you ever like a
[2:41:53] thingama thingamabob
[2:41:55] you know i mean i used to have a buddy
[2:41:57] i'd say what in the world is that he
[2:41:59] would say it's a doohickey from a
[2:42:00] thingamabob
[2:42:02] and so
[2:42:03] it you know it's it's like it they even
[2:42:06] it came it comes from like a pock like a
[2:42:09] like a fester like a sore and and we
[2:42:12] find that she said it's like a little
[2:42:14] hickey and really the whole beauty of it
[2:42:17] was
[2:42:18] was that what brother branham was trying
[2:42:19] to say was
[2:42:21] look you came from eternity
[2:42:24] and it's all just a big circle but to
[2:42:26] make him a redeemer he had to let you
[2:42:29] drop down into a space of time and then
[2:42:31] he saves you
[2:42:33] brings you back up into eternity and you
[2:42:35] just carry right on where you always had
[2:42:38] been
[2:42:40] that's what life is about so no wonder
[2:42:44] the bible would say cast your cares upon
[2:42:46] him for he careth for you oh if you just
[2:42:50] realize he's really got the whole world
[2:42:52] in his hands he's really got your
[2:42:54] children he's really got your family
[2:42:56] he's really got your marriage he's
[2:42:58] really got your health he's really got
[2:42:59] your finances he's got your churches
[2:43:01] he's got your pastors he's got the whole
[2:43:04] world
[2:43:05] in his hands
[2:43:07] see
[2:43:10] and i see myself there in his mind
[2:43:13] back in the first place i see myself in
[2:43:16] revelation as a redeemed expression
[2:43:20] and we realize nothing can stop him
[2:43:23] see
[2:43:25] i'm just seeing how much i need to skip
[2:43:28] yeah we've said all that last night good
[2:43:31] good
[2:43:32] good
[2:43:33] don't say it again
[2:43:36] you know when you really
[2:43:38] if you could grasp
[2:43:40] and i'm just coming to a close
[2:43:43] if if you could grasp
[2:43:46] what this means but a little
[2:43:49] friends you'd live your narrow span
[2:43:52] differently
[2:43:55] as young men and young women you'd make
[2:43:57] your mind up now to say wow
[2:43:59] i had all these plans for life and i
[2:44:00] come to these meetings and found out
[2:44:02] life's just a narrow span and i'm just
[2:44:04] caught between two worlds and and i'm
[2:44:06] purpose by god and i'm on my way
[2:44:07] somewhere and i'm gonna have to you
[2:44:09] might have to need to leave here and
[2:44:10] reformulate
[2:44:12] you might have to change your priorities
[2:44:14] a little bit nothing wrong with with you
[2:44:16] know going forward nothing wrong with
[2:44:18] excellence nothing wrong with improving
[2:44:20] yourself but how where's your priorities
[2:44:23] how is it that god and righteousness and
[2:44:25] holiness and spirituality is is four
[2:44:28] fifth six down on your list instead of
[2:44:30] first way up here see where brother ram
[2:44:32] said those priorities ought to be and
[2:44:34] i'm talking about religious
[2:44:36] remember we read the quote brother satan
[2:44:38] don't care how religious you are i'm not
[2:44:40] i've seen a lot of people get religious
[2:44:43] but brother aaron they don't never seem
[2:44:44] to get more spiritual
[2:44:47] they they get much more religious
[2:44:49] but they they seem to never grow up and
[2:44:51] mature and become spiritual
[2:44:54] and so
[2:44:55] if you really caught it but just a
[2:44:57] little bit you know you wouldn't toss
[2:44:59] your limited spend into the winds if
[2:45:01] some uh some lie the world is telling
[2:45:03] you some imagined freedom you you
[2:45:05] wouldn't you know as satan would like
[2:45:07] you to do as satan would like you to do
[2:45:09] you wouldn't toss it uh to reckless to
[2:45:12] recklessness and a life of sin and some
[2:45:14] idea that the hollywood promotes of
[2:45:16] throwing off all responsibility
[2:45:18] hollywood is so glamorized you know such
[2:45:21] a such a waste of this narrow span
[2:45:24] such a waste of this world between
[2:45:25] worlds you wouldn't allow your feet to
[2:45:28] run swift to mischief you would never
[2:45:30] agree to abandon morality nor would you
[2:45:33] agree to abandon any word of god
[2:45:36] see
[2:45:37] you'd realize what every prophet
[2:45:39] realized
[2:45:40] when they ascended into those high
[2:45:42] atmospheres moving between worlds past
[2:45:44] and present future they always taught
[2:45:47] humanity
[2:45:48] that that when you abandon the line and
[2:45:50] order of god's word you're abandoning
[2:45:53] life
[2:45:55] you cannot succeed you must fail you
[2:45:59] have to fail because anything outside of
[2:46:02] the line and order of god's word is not
[2:46:03] eternal and it has to come to an end and
[2:46:06] so so so the very source of life that
[2:46:09] that you know that the world thinks they
[2:46:11] understand what life is so
[2:46:13] misunderstanding what real life is but
[2:46:15] you here today and it is our hope and it
[2:46:18] is the hope of of all the ministry here
[2:46:20] at this church and the whole reason
[2:46:21] we've assembled you here and brother
[2:46:24] david bore the great expense and and his
[2:46:26] helpers bearing the great load is to get
[2:46:29] you to understand who you really are and
[2:46:32] what this life is about
[2:46:34] and what's your purpose here because i
[2:46:36] think i've established you have a
[2:46:38] purpose
[2:46:40] see
[2:46:44] the god of this evil age hides this
[2:46:46] awareness from you
[2:46:48] you just remember that
[2:46:49] when you go from here after today you
[2:46:51] remember brother jason told you that
[2:46:53] that's his that's he's a specialist at
[2:46:55] it
[2:46:56] of hiding this awareness of everything
[2:46:58] i've been preaching to you since last
[2:47:00] night and today everything he does is
[2:47:03] designed to keep you from seeing this
[2:47:06] high altitude view
[2:47:09] see
[2:47:10] where from here
[2:47:11] you know you you see you see the world
[2:47:14] for real i'm gonna i'm gonna move on i'm
[2:47:16] determined to get to this one last part
[2:47:22] so jacob saw this world between worlds
[2:47:25] and he purposes in his heart
[2:47:28] that the creator
[2:47:30] of these worlds
[2:47:31] would be
[2:47:33] his god
[2:47:34] amen
[2:47:37] it's interesting that jacob
[2:47:39] conditionalized his allegiance
[2:47:42] uh and he actually
[2:47:44] conditioned it to
[2:47:46] to joining
[2:47:47] you know to joining becoming the
[2:47:49] expression of god because he said if
[2:47:51] he'll do this
[2:47:52] i'll he'll be my god if he'll do this
[2:47:54] then i'll serve him if he'll do this
[2:47:56] i'll give him the tithe in other words
[2:47:58] uh everything that he wants me to be
[2:48:02] i'll if he'll help me and bring me back
[2:48:04] and take care of me and protect me and
[2:48:06] bring me back to my father's house in
[2:48:08] peace then i will acquiesce i will do
[2:48:10] all of that stuff and i will i will i
[2:48:12] will let eternity blend with time see
[2:48:16] and so so we find then that that that
[2:48:19] when you when you see yourself in this
[2:48:21] way you know he would commit his heart
[2:48:24] you know to nothing less and what's
[2:48:25] funny to me is that what that that jacob
[2:48:28] what jacob thought to say
[2:48:31] was exactly what god was planning to do
[2:48:34] god already had it it was god's intent
[2:48:37] all along in fact this is why god agreed
[2:48:39] to it so quickly
[2:48:41] god disagreed to it okay it's a deal
[2:48:43] i'll do this you'll do this you'll do
[2:48:45] this yes i'll do that if you'll do this
[2:48:46] okay it's a deal we're done we're going
[2:48:48] forward
[2:48:49] jacob unknowingly expresses the desire
[2:48:52] of god's own heart
[2:48:54] jacob jacob intrinsically aligns himself
[2:48:58] with god's eternal purpose for his life
[2:49:01] see god knew i mean listen friends you
[2:49:04] think god didn't know god knew he'd have
[2:49:06] jacob ready for that angel
[2:49:09] god knew he was going to follow him
[2:49:11] through all of his life the one standing
[2:49:13] at the top of the ladder remember the
[2:49:15] one standing at the top of the ladder i
[2:49:17] mean he he can see the future just as he
[2:49:20] says he can see the past
[2:49:22] see and that's why verse 20 said and
[2:49:24] jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be
[2:49:27] with me and will keep me in this way
[2:49:29] that i go and and will give me bread to
[2:49:31] eat and ramen to put on see and so god
[2:49:34] could see his seed god could see his
[2:49:36] seed in the heart of jacob
[2:49:38] god is standing there looking down on
[2:49:40] his life god can see god can see that
[2:49:41] seed in your heart
[2:49:43] you wonder how why am i a believer i
[2:49:46] believe something my friend standing
[2:49:47] beside me says it's a cult to me it's
[2:49:49] life how is that possible it's a seed
[2:49:52] see
[2:49:53] and and and god could see the seed in
[2:49:55] the heart of uh of jacob jacob didn't
[2:49:58] jacob didn't even know god operated like
[2:50:00] that see
[2:50:01] and god had already god already had his
[2:50:05] finishing move ready for jacob
[2:50:08] he already knew he's going to break him
[2:50:09] down see
[2:50:10] and so jacob says so that so that i can
[2:50:14] come again to my father's house in peace
[2:50:17] then shall the lord be my god
[2:50:20] and god is like you think
[2:50:23] yeah
[2:50:24] okay
[2:50:24] good idea jacob let's go forward see
[2:50:28] and and i mean we used to love my dad my
[2:50:30] dad was atarian and taureans are
[2:50:32] stubborn sorry if you're atarian god
[2:50:34] bless you my dad was a tyrant so the
[2:50:36] family always knew we had a neat little
[2:50:38] crafty way of always you know we wanted
[2:50:40] to do something we had to make him think
[2:50:41] it was his idea
[2:50:44] and you know because he was asking oh
[2:50:45] ain't we in doing that i'm like well
[2:50:47] actually i didn't say we how about just
[2:50:49] me can i go do it you know you know and
[2:50:51] he was always speaking the royal wait we
[2:50:53] ain't doing that and so i would have to
[2:50:56] work my way around and and suggest
[2:50:58] something and he'd go yo that's a good
[2:50:59] idea you should go do that thank you sir
[2:51:04] oh i wonder friends if we have a heart
[2:51:07] like jacob sometimes
[2:51:10] more than more than we'd probably like
[2:51:12] to admit
[2:51:13] a shyster
[2:51:15] yup
[2:51:17] sometimes
[2:51:19] aren't we
[2:51:20] come on all you holy people
[2:51:22] aren't we
[2:51:25] with his same ups and downs
[2:51:28] that i see in me
[2:51:30] you see his ups and downs in you brother
[2:51:32] branham said jacob he said it's hard to
[2:51:35] believe
[2:51:36] he said you really have to believe in
[2:51:37] the grace of god
[2:51:39] to believe in jacob
[2:51:41] this guy was not a good person
[2:51:44] and and we find out he was not a very
[2:51:46] good man at all he never was see
[2:51:48] and and here we are today i hope you can
[2:51:51] see yourself in the image of god's plan
[2:51:53] we also have our ups and downs we also
[2:51:56] sometimes we we where citizens say i
[2:51:58] haven't cheated anybody sometimes you
[2:52:00] cheat yourself
[2:52:01] out of god's blessing you take your life
[2:52:03] in the wrong direction and you end up
[2:52:05] costing yourself the bible says
[2:52:06] sometimes people forsake their own
[2:52:08] mercies
[2:52:09] see and so don't think that can't happen
[2:52:12] and so he was he was never even a very
[2:52:14] good man until he receives a name change
[2:52:16] until until until jacob could defeat
[2:52:19] himself in battle right i'm going to
[2:52:21] tell you jacob got to that point where
[2:52:24] by the time that angel comes on the
[2:52:25] scene
[2:52:26] brother he is jacob is so tired of being
[2:52:30] jacob he's so done with being jacob
[2:52:32] that's where i got that's where you need
[2:52:34] to get so i'm so tired of being me i
[2:52:37] don't do nothing but hurt me i cause me
[2:52:39] trouble i'm always up and down i'm
[2:52:42] always in and out i'm always on and off
[2:52:45] i want i don't want to be me i want to
[2:52:47] be him
[2:52:49] see
[2:52:50] oh my until he could defeat himself in
[2:52:53] battle wrestling with god and then god
[2:52:56] was there to keep a promise to his seed
[2:52:57] because that's really what it was all
[2:52:59] about anyway god had made a promise to
[2:53:01] abraham and here's god keeping us into
[2:53:03] the bargain see god has made a promise
[2:53:05] to your fathers and god is here today
[2:53:07] keeping a bargain your parents put a
[2:53:09] token over you your parents are holding
[2:53:11] faith what's god doing today he's here
[2:53:13] keeping a bargain he made with them that
[2:53:15] i'll bless you and and your offspring
[2:53:17] with you says the lord oh i'm gonna tell
[2:53:20] you something friends when it when he
[2:53:21] was at bethel
[2:53:23] and you know and and and he shares
[2:53:26] god's expression now this is this is my
[2:53:29] last point
[2:53:30] the the thing that jacob did
[2:53:33] that you have an ability today to do
[2:53:37] is jacob
[2:53:38] determined
[2:53:40] although he didn't even know what he was
[2:53:41] doing
[2:53:42] he actually determined to start
[2:53:44] cooperating in the vision that god had
[2:53:46] of him
[2:53:47] now he still was a long time coming 20
[2:53:50] years he stayed a shyster stayed at
[2:53:52] trickster always going left when god
[2:53:54] said go right god stayed with him going
[2:53:56] to this city when god said go to that
[2:53:57] one god stayed with him
[2:53:59] till he finally comes back but but why
[2:54:01] would god agree
[2:54:03] to do all of that
[2:54:05] knowing i mean god jacob could say
[2:54:09] you'll be my god
[2:54:10] and the one standing up there on the
[2:54:12] ladder could just look back into into
[2:54:14] the future and go
[2:54:15] uh yup okay
[2:54:17] and and i'll serve you uh yup you will
[2:54:20] that's right
[2:54:22] and you'll be my god
[2:54:23] i saw that i get it that's what that's
[2:54:26] why i'm here
[2:54:27] see you you understand you think you're
[2:54:28] making a choice you're not you're only
[2:54:30] cooperating in my vision
[2:54:32] and whenever you come to find out that
[2:54:34] you're cooperating in his vision
[2:54:37] see
[2:54:39] that that's
[2:54:40] now that's what mary did
[2:54:42] because mary couldn't bring the word to
[2:54:44] pass in herself she even said it's
[2:54:46] impossible for me how's this going to be
[2:54:49] and the angel said the holy ghost will
[2:54:50] overshadow you and ma the only thing a
[2:54:53] real believer could do when they hear
[2:54:55] the word of god is do what mary did she
[2:54:57] said amen
[2:54:59] be it unto me and when god's family says
[2:55:02] amen to his word the only thing god can
[2:55:05] do is bring it to pass
[2:55:07] he won't do anything else when he gives
[2:55:10] you his word and you say it's me lord
[2:55:14] amen then god begins moving and nothing
[2:55:18] can stop him
[2:55:23] as a believer
[2:55:25] listen friends as a believer with the
[2:55:27] gene of god in you when you hear the
[2:55:29] word
[2:55:31] the only option you have is amen
[2:55:34] i'm just telling you now
[2:55:36] it'll haunt you it'll drive sleep from
[2:55:38] you it'll upend you it'll throw you in
[2:55:40] the ditch it'll set you on fire it'll do
[2:55:42] it'll put you out and then it'll
[2:55:44] run you again but i'm here to tell you
[2:55:47] when you hear the word of god and that
[2:55:48] something inside you starts going oh
[2:55:50] lord oh help me be merciful you might
[2:55:53] not even come at that moment brother
[2:55:54] branham laid at a campfire when he was
[2:55:57] just 18 in phoenix in the desert he's on
[2:55:59] a a roundup
[2:56:01] and he said oh slim he said he got his
[2:56:04] his coal mount he had a a reed on he
[2:56:06] said he started playing uh i forget
[2:56:10] down at the cross where my savior died
[2:56:12] something like that and brother branham
[2:56:14] said i knew he was calling me
[2:56:16] i knew he said something was like a deep
[2:56:19] calling to the deep and he said i'd pull
[2:56:21] the blanket up over my head and he said
[2:56:23] he just kept playing it and kept playing
[2:56:25] and he said i looked i pulled i looked
[2:56:26] up at those stars
[2:56:28] and he says all those stars he said like
[2:56:30] i could hear his voice saying adam son
[2:56:33] where art thou where art thou and all
[2:56:35] brother branham could say at 18 years
[2:56:37] old he said sir i don't know who you are
[2:56:41] but please don't destroy me without
[2:56:42] giving me a chance please please help me
[2:56:46] to know who you are and he he wrote
[2:56:48] notes and tried to put him in trees and
[2:56:50] he tried to talk to other people but he
[2:56:52] had to come and meet jacob's god
[2:56:55] he had to have a surrender of his whole
[2:56:57] life in his whole heart
[2:56:58] hallelujah and then he became legendary
[2:57:02] oh
[2:57:02] stand up all you legends come on stand
[2:57:05] up legends of faith warriors of faith
[2:57:09] warriors you're gonna your name is gonna
[2:57:11] hang in the hall of fame of heaven
[2:57:13] because why when the word spoke to you
[2:57:17] something intrinsic inside you said amen
[2:57:20] amen and when you when a believer says
[2:57:23] amen to god's word god has no option but
[2:57:26] to bring it to pass i'm here to tell you
[2:57:28] it's not about will god do it for me he
[2:57:30] has no option
[2:57:32] when you say amen to his word he has no
[2:57:35] option but to bring it to pass
[2:57:39] oh don't you love him friends
[2:57:41] i'm sorry to have kept you so long but
[2:57:43] the word is so delicious oh oh don't we
[2:57:46] love it
[2:57:47] oh hallelujah i just say blessed be the
[2:57:50] name of the lord i wrote a song down oh
[2:57:53] that that these brothers were singing
[2:57:55] and i want to sing it again what did i
[2:57:56] write down
[2:57:58] jesus messiah
[2:58:01] you're seeing this i know you can sing
[2:58:02] it
[2:58:04] yeah you are singing it too man they're
[2:58:06] singing it and then they're singing it
[2:58:08] you were seeing it i could hear all your
[2:58:09] voices
[2:58:10] jesus messiah
[2:58:13] you're a part of that family
[2:58:16] are you happy for that
[2:58:19] that should thrill you
[2:58:21] to realize my goodness
[2:58:24] the god of all creation
[2:58:27] the god who created the whole world
[2:58:29] is my father i have found out today see
[2:58:33] that's why brother ben would say
[2:58:35] you didn't come to an altar and become a
[2:58:37] son of god
[2:58:38] you found out you always had been that's
[2:58:40] right
[2:58:41] so see what what you're doing now here's
[2:58:43] your opportunity today start cooperating
[2:58:45] in the vision
[2:58:46] [Music]
[2:58:47] god has a purpose that's why i said to
[2:58:49] you last night if satan has told you
[2:58:52] that you can't make it call him a liar
[2:58:54] [Music]
[2:58:55] if he's told you and he so often does
[2:58:59] tells you you have no value
[2:59:02] maybe some experience you have
[2:59:04] that you wouldn't even want to share
[2:59:05] with your closest friend and satan has
[2:59:08] been able to put a place in your mind
[2:59:09] and say you have no value god doesn't
[2:59:12] love you do you know he tried to tell
[2:59:14] brother branham that see brother branham
[2:59:16] said he tried to tell me that god wasn't
[2:59:19] real he said but he couldn't because i
[2:59:22] had already seen him amen
[2:59:24] so he he didn't have no success at
[2:59:26] telling me god wasn't real because i had
[2:59:28] already seen him
[2:59:29] he said so what he did was he said well
[2:59:32] but he don't care about you
[2:59:35] if he cared about you this wouldn't have
[2:59:37] happened and this wouldn't happen and
[2:59:38] this wouldn't have happened and brother
[2:59:40] branham stood there reasoning like eve
[2:59:42] reasoning saying that's right
[2:59:44] and this wouldn't have happened that's
[2:59:46] right and this wouldn't have happened
[2:59:48] that's right
[2:59:50] the whole whole town thinks you're crazy
[2:59:52] you've lost your mind he said i had
[2:59:54] said no the girls won't talk to you
[2:59:56] nobody have anything to do with you they
[2:59:57] think you're nuts
[2:59:59] and he said
[3:00:00] i thought lord what have i done he said
[3:00:02] yeah
[3:00:04] come on dad will i get him on what have
[3:00:06] you done he said lord what have i done

[3:00:21] next day he said so weak from fasting i
[3:00:24] have to bow my head and pray to put my
[3:00:26] spurs on to get up the light pole to fix
[3:00:28] a utility line
[3:00:31] and he said try to go everywhere go in
[3:00:33] the garage and say man can i tell you
[3:00:35] about the lord and the do you know
[3:00:37] christ and he said night and day night
[3:00:39] and day and he said and hear and then
[3:00:42] satan goes yeah
[3:00:43] and and said when it come to your own
[3:00:45] wife and baby
[3:00:49] not only would he not grant your prayer
[3:00:51] requests he wouldn't even talk to you
[3:00:55] brother branham said a black sheep come
[3:00:56] down an area i'm begging for my child
[3:00:59] and he said a black sheep come down as
[3:01:01] if god was just saying shut up
[3:01:03] i don't even want to talk to you and
[3:01:06] that's when he said see if he wouldn't
[3:01:07] talk to me then it was satan's turn
[3:01:10] and satan said now after all you've done
[3:01:12] for him and brother branham said that's
[3:01:14] right that's right and brother branham
[3:01:15] said i was just about to say well if he
[3:01:18] won't do that then i then i won't
[3:01:21] and he stopped
[3:01:23] and something caught
[3:01:24] something caught
[3:01:26] he had already hooked the line to
[3:01:28] calvary and he already realized he's
[3:01:30] caught and he can't take that next step
[3:01:32] he turns around to brother now when he
[3:01:33] says brother neville what if it hadn't
[3:01:35] been for that seed what if that hadn't
[3:01:36] been there we wouldn't know meetings

[3:15:00] [Music]
[3:15:09] amen
[3:15:11] it's a wise thing
[3:15:13] to walk away from the world
[3:15:17] amen
[3:15:19] it's just a twinkling of the time the
[3:15:21] world is yes
[3:15:24] you know
[3:15:27] it's a great battle paul
[3:15:29] [Music]
[3:15:31] god had a plan for paul
[3:15:35] finally the lord looked at him and said
[3:15:37] paul it's hard to kick against the
[3:15:39] sticker
[3:15:41] it's hard to kick against the prick
[3:15:44] it's hard to kick against
[3:15:46] the seed that's already predestinated in
[3:15:48] you to do what it's going to do
[3:15:52] that's why we call it surrender
[3:15:56] that's where you just throw your hands
[3:15:58] up and say lord i
[3:15:59] i surrender
[3:16:01] i give up
[3:16:04] and and i just couldn't think of the
[3:16:05] wonderful words and the way it was
[3:16:07] expressed to you
[3:16:10] to accept the fact
[3:16:12] that
[3:16:13] god has ordered this for your life
[3:16:19] you didn't choose it
[3:16:20] you have not chosen me
[3:16:23] i have chosen you
[3:16:26] and if i started to work i will
[3:16:29] finish it
[3:16:30] to the end
[3:16:32] and nothing can pluck you
[3:16:34] out of the palm of my hand
[3:16:38] now that's hard to fight against
[3:16:42] amen
[3:16:45] you know a great
[3:16:47] word of wisdom was spoken by one of the
[3:16:50] writers
[3:16:51] and he said you know we're foolish
[3:16:53] people
[3:16:54] because we compare ourselves
[3:16:56] one to another
[3:16:58] and every single one of us in here is so
[3:17:01] unique
[3:17:03] and so special
[3:17:05] and so perfectly created
[3:17:08] in the mind of god
[3:17:10] that nobody
[3:17:12] can take your place
[3:17:15] so be determined
[3:17:17] when you leave here be determined to
[3:17:19] follow your
[3:17:22] spiritual calling
[3:17:24] your call from the other world first
[3:17:27] seek ye first
[3:17:29] the kingdom of god
[3:17:31] and all else
[3:17:33] will be added unto you
[3:17:35] your jobs your companions your life
[3:17:39] your homes your houses
[3:17:42] all the things that follow
[3:17:45] but if you set your vision to where our
[3:17:47] brother pointed us to
[3:17:52] to look over yonder
[3:17:56] to look across
[3:17:59] to the other side
[3:18:01] and know that soon our journey will be
[3:18:04] over
[3:18:06] here and we'll pass from this life
[3:18:11] to another life
[3:18:13] [Music]
[3:18:15] oh i pray that that becomes a reality to
[3:18:18] you
[3:18:22] our messenger said jesus rose from the
[3:18:24] grave
[3:18:27] to reveal to us the secret
[3:18:30] that there was life
[3:18:33] after death
[3:18:36] and i think our brother put it so
[3:18:38] beautiful this is just
[3:18:40] such a small
[3:18:42] sliver
[3:18:44] of where we've been
[3:18:47] and where we're going
[3:18:49] amen so let's don't look back okay
[3:18:53] if you have things in your life that
[3:18:57] aren't right
[3:19:00] well i say unto you your sins are
[3:19:02] forgiven
[3:19:06] you say can you say that yes i give you
[3:19:08] the keys
[3:19:10] to the kingdom
[3:19:14] that you can leave those things behind
[3:19:17] and you can go
[3:19:19] forward
[3:19:21] and so i pray that each of you will do
[3:19:24] that that you'll find your course
[3:19:27] [Music]
[3:19:29] and i
[3:19:29] want to say this too if there's somebody
[3:19:32] that's never been baptized
[3:19:35] in the name of the lord jesus christ the
[3:19:37] true christian baptism and
[3:19:40] the lord's moved on your heart you'd
[3:19:42] like to be baptized we have the pool
[3:19:44] ready we'd be more than happy to baptize
[3:19:47] you in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:19:50] if that's been a question on your heart
[3:19:52] we just want to make that
[3:19:54] available to you
[3:19:56] once again we'd like to thank
[3:20:00] all of those that
[3:20:02] drove the young people here that came
[3:20:04] and chaperoned all of you that
[3:20:07] opened your homes
[3:20:09] those of you that cooked
[3:20:11] but above all those of you who prayed
[3:20:15] and asked god to do exceedingly and
[3:20:18] abundantly above what we could ask or
[3:20:20] think
[3:20:21] we're going to do that and
[3:20:23] young people don't ever
[3:20:26] forget the power of prayer
[3:20:30] you can move mountains with it
[3:20:33] so
[3:20:34] i just
[3:20:35] i was trying to think of a little song
[3:20:37] i'd like to sing kind of for a dismissal
[3:20:39] song
[3:20:41] it's about you know how that we look and
[3:20:43] yonder over the river
[3:20:45] you know i love that song
[3:20:50] no
[3:20:51] it's something like uh
[3:20:58] [Music]
[3:21:00] that's where i'm going
[3:21:02] i just call it another thing
[3:21:05] and then that's just think of what our
[3:21:07] brother told us
[3:21:12] this ain't our home
[3:21:15] in fact we're not even from here
[3:21:19] we're pilgrims
[3:21:21] we're strangers
[3:21:25] you are aliens
[3:21:29] and you're getting odder and hotter
[3:21:31] every day
[3:21:32] [Music]
[3:21:33] as he builds his kingdom
[3:21:36] so there's something in us calling
[3:21:39] a deep
[3:21:40] calling to a deed
[3:21:41] [Music]
[3:21:45] let that set in what our brother told us
[3:21:48] we are not from here
[3:21:52] and god wants to fulfill
[3:21:55] his vision
[3:21:57] in you
[3:21:58] and he wants you to look
[3:22:00] to the promise that he's made
[3:22:03] so as we're dismissed and we'll sing
[3:22:05] this as our dismissal
[3:22:08] let's bow our heads one more time in

[3:22:48] that you're a savior
[3:22:51] that your attributes might be expressed
[3:22:53] to us father but we're homesick
