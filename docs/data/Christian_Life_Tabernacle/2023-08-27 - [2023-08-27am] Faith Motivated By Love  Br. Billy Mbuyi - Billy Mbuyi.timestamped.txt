[13:43] amen let's just bow our heads always
[13:45] just start our service this morning in
[13:48] his presence
[13:49] Heavenly Father Lord we're just so
[13:51] thankful to just be gathered in a place
[13:53] like this
[13:54] a better a day in that courts than a
[13:57] thousand house Lord your Prophet David
[14:00] had said and so Lord we're gathered here
[14:02] with expectation
[14:04] Lord we're gathered here with a desire
[14:07] on our heart to be able to have a union
[14:09] with your word with you
[14:11] Lord let it not just be words or just
[14:15] plain words of doctrine that hits our
[14:18] ear or our heart but let it be
[14:20] Revelation let it be life that strikes
[14:23] us Lord Jesus Lord in so much that it
[14:26] takes us from the condition that we are
[14:27] and just to reflect more into your
[14:30] reflected image that you want us to be
[14:32] father
[14:33] lower letters just to be able to put
[14:35] away our our ourselves and look more
[14:39] unto you and that I that I don't live
[14:41] for myself but Christ that lives inside
[14:44] of me Lord every day every hour every
[14:46] minute of the day
[14:48] Lord what good would it do to gain the
[14:50] whole world and Lose My Soul
[14:53] Lord is by that precious blood of Jesus
[14:55] Christ that we're redeemed and we know
[14:57] that we have life so we invite you this
[14:59] morning precious father to come and dine
[15:02] with us to speak to us to reveal to us
[15:04] your word Lord Jesus we just ask the
[15:07] blessing over the service and we're just
[15:09] bless you now in Jesus Christ's name
[15:12] amen you can just turn around and shake
[15:15] the hands of somebody tell them welcome
[15:16] to the house of the Lord God bless you
[15:18] as we invite brother Mike this morning
[15:20] amen
[15:41] good morning you may be seated for a few
[15:43] minutes
[15:48] probably
[15:50] one of the most
[15:53] anticipated
[15:55] blessed promises that we have
[15:58] been given to us as the promise of a
[16:00] rapture
[16:03] you know I think that probably not only
[16:04] everyone in this building but
[16:07] Christians and churches everywhere in
[16:09] homes everywhere
[16:12] you know look forward to that hope
[16:15] that promise that one day
[16:18] the Lord will come and catch away his
[16:20] people
[16:23] we don't want to miss that
[16:25] you know as we look
[16:27] at the condition of the world that we're
[16:30] in
[16:31] the
[16:32] struggles and
[16:34] problems and Sorrows of this life
[16:37] we look at how the age is increasingly
[16:40] dark and hopeless
[16:44] you know the Cry of our hearts hopefully
[16:46] gets stronger every day even so
[16:48] come quickly Lord Jesus
[16:53] but you know what's interesting is that
[16:54] word rapture
[16:57] never appears in the scriptures one time
[17:02] doesn't even appear anywhere in the
[17:03] Bible
[17:06] you know it's strange that the word we
[17:09] use most
[17:10] to describe this great promise
[17:13] can be found nowhere in the scriptures
[17:18] and yet Believers all over the world
[17:22] refer to his coming
[17:25] and this blessed hope
[17:27] as the rapture
[17:30] you know great sermons have been
[17:32] preached about the rapture
[17:35] whole fields of study in theology
[17:40] to try to analyze and understand
[17:45] the place that the Rapture and end time
[17:48] events if I place them all in time and
[17:51] understand what that will be like in the
[17:54] last days
[17:57] it's a promise that so anticipated
[18:02] you know it's wrapped in so many phrases
[18:05] and so much theology
[18:08] that
[18:10] you know except for the grace of God
[18:14] one would miss it
[18:16] because they're not looking for it the
[18:19] way he said it would be
[18:22] you know it's always been amazing to me
[18:24] that when God sent his messenger
[18:27] before his face
[18:30] and he began to deal with the subject of
[18:33] the rapture
[18:36] that he didn't go to any of the
[18:38] scriptures that the religious teachers
[18:40] or the theologians
[18:42] of hundreds of years used
[18:46] to teach the rapture
[18:48] he went right on past second Peter 3.
[18:53] right on past first Thessalonians 4
[18:56] and even Matthew 24 and 25.
[19:00] and he settled on psalm 27.
[19:04] of all places
[19:07] to focus a people
[19:10] on the rapture
[19:14] you know it says in Malachi 3 1 behold I
[19:18] will send my messenger
[19:20] and he shall prepare the way before me
[19:23] and the Lord whom ye seek
[19:27] shall suddenly come
[19:29] to his Temple
[19:32] in Psalm 27 4 says one thing have I
[19:35] desired of the Lord
[19:38] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[19:40] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[19:42] my life
[19:44] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[19:47] inquire in
[19:48] his Temple
[19:51] you know the messenger preparing
[19:54] the way for his coming
[19:57] directing his people to a place
[20:01] of his appearing
[20:03] by causing them to seek his appearing
[20:07] in a place where he said he would come
[20:12] you know as we read Psalm 27
[20:15] it maybe causes us to think about the
[20:18] rapture
[20:19] as something different than maybe we had
[20:22] previously thought
[20:24] after hundreds of years of religious
[20:27] teaching
[20:29] since our attention has been brought to
[20:31] this chapter by the messenger
[20:34] it's worth noting some of the
[20:36] interesting statements made in this
[20:38] Rapture chapter
[20:41] in verse 1 it says the Lord is my light
[20:43] and my salvation
[20:46] Whom Shall I Fear
[20:48] the Lord is the strength of my life
[20:52] of whom shall I be afraid
[20:55] Who Shall I Fear
[20:56] who shall I be afraid of
[21:00] why all the mention of fear
[21:03] verse 3 though and hosts should encamp
[21:05] against me my heart shall not fear
[21:10] notice all the statements he's making
[21:12] this isn't a prayer
[21:15] this is a testimony
[21:18] this is a declaration
[21:20] I have no fear
[21:22] I'm not afraid
[21:25] there's no fear here
[21:29] though an army
[21:31] comes against me to consume me and it
[21:34] will
[21:35] I won't fear
[21:38] the war breaks out against me
[21:41] and it will
[21:43] not fear
[21:46] what's he saying here
[21:48] he's describing being in a place
[21:52] in a position
[21:55] that is free from Fear
[21:58] a place where all fear has been cast out
[22:05] you know this is a totally different
[22:06] picture of the rapture
[22:10] what he's describing here in verse 1 and
[22:13] 3 is the enemies and the foes are still
[22:15] there
[22:18] the armies are still there
[22:22] the wicked are still there
[22:25] there's still war rising up
[22:29] but in spite of everything that
[22:30] surrounds him
[22:33] he's in a place that is totally free
[22:35] from Fear
[22:39] he says it this way in psalm 23. yea
[22:43] though I walk through the valley of the
[22:45] shadow of death I will fear no evil
[22:48] for thou art with me
[22:52] he goes on to say thou prepared a table
[22:55] before me in the presence
[22:58] not the absence
[22:59] of my enemies
[23:02] rapture
[23:05] see Psalm 27 isn't necessarily about
[23:09] being caught up
[23:11] in a place that's free from evil
[23:15] it's about being caught into a place
[23:17] with him
[23:19] that is free from Fear of the evil
[23:25] first John 4 18 there is no fear in love
[23:30] but perfect love
[23:33] casteth out fear
[23:36] because fear hath torment
[23:40] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[23:44] love
[23:46] the verse just before that verse 17.
[23:50] herein is our love made perfect
[23:55] that we may have boldness in the day of
[23:57] judgment
[23:59] not freedom from the day of judgment
[24:00] boldness in the day of judgment
[24:05] because as he is
[24:08] so are we in this world
[24:13] this is about being caught up into a
[24:15] place with him
[24:17] into a place of perfect love
[24:20] free from Fear
[24:23] but still in the world
[24:27] being caught up into a place where
[24:29] perfect love has cast out all fear
[24:33] notice verse 2 when the wicked even mine
[24:36] enemies and my foes still there
[24:40] Came Upon me to eat up my flesh I stood
[24:42] against them and defeated them
[24:45] no
[24:47] they stumbled and fell
[24:51] they came after me to consume me
[24:53] and they fell away
[24:57] why
[24:59] in verse 5.
[25:01] for in the time of trouble
[25:04] how many can say we live in a time of
[25:05] trouble
[25:08] he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[25:12] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[25:15] hide me
[25:17] He Shall Set me upon a rock
[25:21] he's placing me somewhere
[25:23] he's hiding me somewhere
[25:26] he's putting me in a place where they
[25:28] cannot go
[25:32] the enemy is still there
[25:35] but I'm just being caught up into a
[25:37] place with him where they cannot reach
[25:40] where they cannot go
[25:45] verse 6 and now shall mine ahead be
[25:48] lifted up above might enemies round
[25:50] about me
[25:53] Out Of Reach
[25:55] be not afraid
[25:58] believe only
[26:01] they'll fall away
[26:04] you know Paul describes the Rapture in
[26:06] first Thessalonians 4 17 as being caught
[26:09] up together with him
[26:11] to be caught up
[26:13] to be carried away to be snatched up
[26:18] the idea of
[26:20] being snatched up into a place with him
[26:25] where perfect love casteth out all fear
[26:30] you know I thought as I was reading that
[26:32] am I being carried into such a place
[26:36] am I allowing myself
[26:39] to be carried into such a place
[26:42] you know the thing about fear is it's
[26:44] the opposite of faith
[26:46] and we were taught that Revelation that
[26:49] Rapture is a revelation which is faith
[26:54] but you know it's interesting yeah
[26:56] there's a body change
[26:58] there's a future
[27:00] going into an Incorruptible place
[27:03] but before we can assume a condition
[27:05] there
[27:07] we have to reflect that condition here
[27:11] Psalm 27 4
[27:13] One Thing have I desired
[27:17] and that will I seek after
[27:21] that I may dwell in the house of the
[27:24] Lord
[27:27] that I may dwell where he dwells
[27:31] as he is so are we in this world
[27:36] all the days of my life
[27:41] not in the afterlife
[27:43] not after this life all the days of my
[27:49] life
[27:52] to behold
[27:54] the beauty of the Lord
[27:56] all the days of my life
[28:00] and to inquire in his Temple
[28:03] all the days of my life
[28:09] let's stand
[28:14] you know as I read that I thought Lord
[28:15] help me
[28:19] bring me
[28:21] to that place of perfect love
[28:25] where no matter
[28:28] what enemy May rage around me
[28:31] I will fear no evil
[28:34] that I may be in that hiding place that
[28:37] place that he went to go prepare for me
[28:40] that where he was where that where I am
[28:43] present tense
[28:45] I may be also
[28:48] as he is so are we in this world
[28:52] one thing have I desired and that will I
[28:55] seek after you know it's no coincidence
[28:58] that the messenger of our hour
[29:01] brought us here
[29:04] to see what Rapture is
[29:06] that secret place
[29:09] caught up into that secret place into
[29:11] that Hiding Place with him
[29:14] you know I don't know about you this
[29:16] morning but my prayer is that I get in
[29:17] this place
[29:19] because it's in this secret place that I
[29:22] can begin to reflect here
[29:24] what will be manifest there
[29:27] just a wonderful chapter you could spend
[29:30] hours going through Psalm 27 let's just
[29:32] read that together starting in verse one
[29:35] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[29:38] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[29:41] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[29:43] afraid when the wicked even mine enemies
[29:46] and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my
[29:49] flesh they stumbled and fell though an
[29:53] host should encamp against me my heart
[29:55] shall not fear though War should rise
[29:58] against me in this will I be confident
[30:01] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[30:03] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[30:07] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[30:09] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[30:12] and to inquire in his Temple for in the
[30:15] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[30:18] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[30:21] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[30:24] rock and now shall mine head be lifted
[30:27] up above mine enemies round about me
[30:29] therefore will I offer in his
[30:31] Tabernacles sacrifices of Joy I will
[30:34] sing yea I will sing praises unto the
[30:38] Lord hear O Lord when I cry with my
[30:41] voice have mercy also upon me and answer
[30:44] me when thou said seek ye my face my
[30:48] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[30:50] I seek hide not thy face far from me put
[30:54] not thy servant away in Anchor thou has
[30:57] been my help leave me not neither
[31:00] forsake me o God of my salvation when my
[31:04] father and my mother forsake me then the
[31:07] Lord will take me up teach me thy way O
[31:10] Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because
[31:13] of mine enemies deliver me not over to
[31:16] the will of mine enemies for false
[31:19] Witnesses are risen up against me and
[31:21] such as breathe out cruelty I had
[31:24] fainted unless I had believed to see the
[31:27] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[31:29] living wait on the Lord be of good
[31:32] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[31:34] heart wait I say I'm the Lord amen

[1:06:07] scripture this morning are you happy to
[1:06:09] be in the house of God Amen
[1:06:14] let's open our Bibles
[1:06:17] um
[1:06:18] I thought the psalm reading was very
[1:06:20] much in line with what I had in my heart
[1:06:22] and we'll see how that goes
[1:06:25] let's start with Ephesians chapter 2
[1:06:28] Ephesians second chapter that says
[1:06:33] and verse
[1:06:36] one I believe
[1:06:42] they said and you had it quickened who
[1:06:45] were dead in sin and trespass and
[1:06:47] trespassing sin wherein in time past you
[1:06:50] walk according to the course of this
[1:06:52] world according to the prince of the
[1:06:54] power of the air the spirit that now
[1:06:57] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[1:06:59] among who also we have had our
[1:07:03] conversation in time past in the lust of
[1:07:05] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:07:08] Flesh and of the mind and where we're
[1:07:11] and where by Nature the children of
[1:07:13] Wrath even as others so he's wanting to
[1:07:17] remind you that you were the same when
[1:07:20] you look at the world and you see what's
[1:07:22] happening you were the same you were
[1:07:24] once the sin that you were once
[1:07:26] partakers of those things but ye one
[1:07:29] says them but he's saying now but God
[1:07:32] who is rich in Mercy now you you have to
[1:07:36] remember it's God who's rich in Mercy
[1:07:38] it's not because of your interact and
[1:07:40] it's not because you were eyes you find
[1:07:43] out well I'm wasting my time I need to
[1:07:45] do something better I'll I'll try God
[1:07:47] and find out no but he said but God
[1:07:50] who's rich in Mercy for his great love
[1:07:53] not your love for his great love
[1:07:57] where we wherewith he had loved us even
[1:08:00] he says even when we were dead in sin
[1:08:03] and trespasses Quicken us together with
[1:08:06] Christ by Grace ye are saved and then he
[1:08:09] says and has raised us up together and
[1:08:11] made it made us sit in Heavenly places
[1:08:14] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:08:18] that he might show the exceeding Riches
[1:08:21] of his of his grace and his kindness
[1:08:25] towards us through Christ Jesus now yes
[1:08:29] so he's doing this so that for the for
[1:08:33] the remaining of our time for eternity
[1:08:36] we may know about the grace of God we
[1:08:40] may understand what the love of God is
[1:08:42] so when we come together and when we
[1:08:45] talk or when we summarize everything
[1:08:47] that we know about God it will be all
[1:08:49] about his grace and his mercy and his
[1:08:51] love and say none of our works less any
[1:08:54] man should boast
[1:08:56] it says for we are his workmanship
[1:09:00] created in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus
[1:09:02] unto good works he says which he had
[1:09:05] foreign
[1:09:06] that we should walk in them let's also
[1:09:10] turn in Hebrews chapter 11 and we'll
[1:09:13] start from verse one it says now Faith
[1:09:16] is a substance of things hoped for the
[1:09:19] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[1:09:21] the elders obtained a good report
[1:09:23] through faith we understand that the
[1:09:25] world were framed by the word of God so
[1:09:29] that things which are seen were not made
[1:09:31] of things that do appear by faith the
[1:09:34] Abel or for offer unto God a more
[1:09:37] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[1:09:40] he obtained a witness that he was
[1:09:43] righteous God testifying of his gift and
[1:09:47] by it being dead yet speaketh it says by
[1:09:51] faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:09:53] should not see death and was found and
[1:09:56] was was found and was not found because
[1:09:59] God had translated him for before his
[1:10:03] translation he had this testimony that
[1:10:05] he had pleased God he says but without
[1:10:08] faith it's impossible to please him for
[1:10:11] he that cometh to God must believe that
[1:10:13] he is and that is a rewarder of them
[1:10:15] that diligently seek after him it says
[1:10:19] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[1:10:22] things not seen yet move with fear
[1:10:25] prepare an ark to the saving of his
[1:10:28] house by which
[1:10:31] by which he condemned the world and
[1:10:34] became an heir of the righteousness
[1:10:36] which is by Faith by faith Abraham when
[1:10:39] he was called to when he was called to
[1:10:42] God out of his place which it should be
[1:10:45] he should have received for inheritance
[1:10:47] obey and went out not knowing whether he
[1:10:51] went
[1:10:52] by faith he sojourn in the land of
[1:10:54] promise as a strange and in in a strange
[1:10:58] country dwelling in Tabernacle with
[1:11:00] Isaac and Jacob the air with him of the
[1:11:03] same promise for he looked for a city
[1:11:06] which had the foundation whose Builder
[1:11:10] and maker was God let's just borrow has
[1:11:13] our gracious father we so thankful to be
[1:11:15] gathered in your presence once again
[1:11:17] Lord Jesus where could we say Lord then
[1:11:20] the prophet said bless the Lord O My
[1:11:23] Soul forget not all of these benefits
[1:11:25] and who forgiveth all thy iniquity and
[1:11:28] who healeth all that diseases Lord you
[1:11:31] are our all in all Lord and everything
[1:11:33] that we have need of Lord we find it in
[1:11:36] you Lord and we ask now that you may
[1:11:38] take these few words and the words that
[1:11:41] you have given us oh God from the Bible
[1:11:43] that we could stand upon them and that
[1:11:45] you can come and expand them to our
[1:11:47] hearts and let it be beneficial to
[1:11:49] someone Lord and that we may say
[1:11:51] certainly we we have come to the
[1:11:53] presence of God and you have spoken to
[1:11:55] us we commit everything to you and us in
[1:11:57] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God
[1:12:00] bless you may have your seats
[1:12:07] I I want to speak
[1:12:11] uh this morning and
[1:12:14] and I'm pretty sure we won't be able to
[1:12:18] bring it to a finish but we'll certainly
[1:12:21] just try to start and and see how far we
[1:12:24] can get with it and I was inspired by
[1:12:28] what our pastor has been preaching and
[1:12:31] in in general is
[1:12:34] perhaps almost in on the same line
[1:12:37] speaking of Faith but we will try to
[1:12:40] narrow it down as we get uh further and
[1:12:43] further to narrow and and I want to call
[1:12:47] it uh Faith motivated by love
[1:12:50] that's really where we want to get to
[1:12:52] when we get to the end of it Faith
[1:12:54] motivated by love and that's what we
[1:12:57] want to uh speak on at the very end and
[1:13:01] and so the prophet makes a statement in
[1:13:03] the message on partable sin it said
[1:13:06] paragraph 150 says
[1:13:09] for you are not saved by any Works any
[1:13:12] good works you are not safe by shouting
[1:13:15] you are not saved by dancing in the
[1:13:18] spirit you are not saved by speaking in
[1:13:20] tongue you are not saved by keeping the
[1:13:23] Sabbath you are not saved by Meat by
[1:13:26] meat eating you are not safe by joining
[1:13:28] a church you are say you are not saved
[1:13:30] by water baptism you are saved by faith
[1:13:35] you are saved by faith through Grace
[1:13:37] that you are saved right and it says and
[1:13:40] if you are truly saved these other
[1:13:43] things automatically come so the focus
[1:13:47] of the saving is for is Faith first and
[1:13:50] it's faith that is launched out it's
[1:13:52] faith that is presented and then he says
[1:13:55] all of this other things automatically
[1:13:57] come you speak with tongue and you you
[1:14:00] could shout and you can praise God the
[1:14:02] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[1:14:04] prophet of the to the prophet it says
[1:14:07] when the pastor sees something wrong he
[1:14:10] says look looks look sister or look or
[1:14:14] old brother that's wrong you are it says
[1:14:18] you are submissive that's right you are
[1:14:21] submissive the spirit of the Prophet is
[1:14:23] subject to the prophet you are
[1:14:25] submissive it says God God forgive me
[1:14:29] you said God forgive me I didn't mean to
[1:14:32] get out of order ready it says uh
[1:14:34] through the church and move on and then
[1:14:37] he says then you are going to see a
[1:14:40] church moving for the glory of God it
[1:14:43] says the spirit of the Prophet is
[1:14:45] subject to the prophet everything is in
[1:14:48] order the church set in order so I and I
[1:14:52] want to say this on the outset the the
[1:14:55] very Foundation of a Christian Life is
[1:14:57] Faith you can never go past faith and
[1:15:01] and and and then get to God any other
[1:15:03] way because we understand if we are here
[1:15:06] this morning we we can certainly say we
[1:15:09] hear because we desire more faith than
[1:15:11] what we have this morning we we are
[1:15:14] saved by faith as the scripture says but
[1:15:16] the measure of faith that we have today
[1:15:19] we need more measure than what we came
[1:15:21] in with this morning because rapturing
[1:15:24] faith is not a different faith is an
[1:15:26] addition to the faith that we have it's
[1:15:29] a rapturing faith that comes by the
[1:15:30] revealing of the word that comes and
[1:15:32] head on top of what we already know so
[1:15:35] we have faith we need faith in order for
[1:15:38] us to overcome in the daily life we need
[1:15:41] Faith because the scripture will tell us
[1:15:43] that we faith is the is a faith is what
[1:15:47] for comes his faith is the victory that
[1:15:50] overcomes the world even the things of
[1:15:52] the world and I could say faith is what
[1:15:55] will give us Victory faith is what will
[1:15:58] take us from what we are and change us
[1:16:00] into what God desires for us to be but
[1:16:03] when I'm says that Faith knows no defeat
[1:16:06] so if this morning we're coming and we
[1:16:09] have needs and we have troubles and we
[1:16:11] have our human nature is bothering us
[1:16:14] the challenge of the world is bothering
[1:16:16] us we can come with confidence and say
[1:16:18] that if I come by the way of faith I
[1:16:20] will know what victory tastes like
[1:16:22] because Faith knows no defeat what
[1:16:25] iranam says that faith faith When Faith
[1:16:28] speaks everything has to shut up and I
[1:16:31] thought the problem with us is so many
[1:16:33] times we do our own speaking and we
[1:16:35] don't let Faith speak but if we can come
[1:16:37] to a place and you don't do the talking
[1:16:40] you let the faith that God has placed
[1:16:42] within you speak for you you'd have the
[1:16:44] victory that God promised you'll have
[1:16:46] but one of them says faith has got
[1:16:48] muscle and a hairy chest when friends
[1:16:50] speaks everything has to shut up and I
[1:16:53] want to say this morning that's the way
[1:16:54] we need to come that's the way that we
[1:16:57] need to approach God that's the way we
[1:16:59] need to approach life in order for us to
[1:17:01] have the victory that's promised so many
[1:17:03] times we want to do our own battle but
[1:17:05] he promised you he will do our battles
[1:17:08] he'll fight for us he'll provide our
[1:17:10] daily food he will do all those things
[1:17:12] and yet we are yet we are we always try
[1:17:15] to use the element of what we know in
[1:17:17] order for us to overcome by
[1:17:20] the scripture says that we walk by faith
[1:17:23] and not by sight
[1:17:25] oh
[1:17:26] and I want to say this so many things of
[1:17:30] what we do it's so dependent on the
[1:17:33] information we get in our brains and and
[1:17:35] and and and and this happened or this is
[1:17:38] our reaction that happened and this is
[1:17:40] our reaction and the scripture here says
[1:17:43] we we walk by faith and not by sight in
[1:17:47] other words your your God the way he
[1:17:49] created you and we'll get to it it's
[1:17:51] talking about the Sixth Sense God didn't
[1:17:54] make you so you can walk by what you see
[1:17:56] God didn't create you so you can analyze
[1:18:00] everything by your senses so you can
[1:18:02] judge everything by your sense and then
[1:18:04] and Conquer uh and come up with a
[1:18:06] response on what you should do and to
[1:18:09] that situation and see how it's going to
[1:18:11] work no God created you so you can
[1:18:14] analyze everything by the faith of God
[1:18:17] and by the word of God and then from the
[1:18:19] word of God find a response for you to
[1:18:21] come up with
[1:18:24] the the scripture says they just shall
[1:18:27] live by faith so if you if we are to
[1:18:30] have life within us if we are to keep
[1:18:33] life within us it has to be by the way
[1:18:36] of faith and oftentimes we we let this
[1:18:39] carnal mind this carnal understanding of
[1:18:42] the things of the world and and the
[1:18:45] things that we have learned and and
[1:18:46] throughout the years and the wisdom
[1:18:49] we've accumulated we let that lead us
[1:18:52] instead of being led by faith and I want
[1:18:54] to say this morning God wants you to
[1:18:57] consider his word
[1:18:59] God wants you to consider him and when a
[1:19:03] situation arises and you're about to
[1:19:05] make a decision and you're about to go
[1:19:07] in a certain direction you're about to
[1:19:09] do something God wants you to put in
[1:19:11] your mind to consider what he said and
[1:19:14] to consider his promise for you to
[1:19:17] consider what he promised he will do for
[1:19:19] you to consider where he got you out of
[1:19:22] to consider where he's trying to take
[1:19:24] you before you can come up to a
[1:19:26] conclusion he wants you to consider his
[1:19:28] word he wants you to consider his
[1:19:31] promise he wants you to take all of that
[1:19:33] into consideration before you can come
[1:19:35] up with the final conclusion
[1:19:37] the scripture will speak and and in
[1:19:40] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 25 it says
[1:19:43] therefore I say unto you take no
[1:19:46] thoughts of your life where ye shall eat
[1:19:49] or why he shall drink no ye no yet for
[1:19:53] your body he says what shall he put on
[1:19:56] he says is it not a life more than meat
[1:20:00] or the body more than women he says
[1:20:03] behold the fowls of the year for they so
[1:20:07] not neither do they reap knew that they
[1:20:09] got a grain but yet our heavenly father
[1:20:11] feed him are you not much more than they
[1:20:15] oh my brother my sister it seems like
[1:20:18] our lives every decision we made is
[1:20:21] about how we're going to eat and where
[1:20:23] we're going to sleep and how we're going
[1:20:24] to pick our take care of our bills and
[1:20:26] it seems like if you are not careful
[1:20:29] that takes precedence over the word of
[1:20:32] God
[1:20:33] our decision making is based on our own
[1:20:36] protection and and what we need to do to
[1:20:39] protect ourselves against this or
[1:20:41] against that but the Lord is telling you
[1:20:43] this morning consider his word
[1:20:47] the scripture speaks I believe in the
[1:20:49] Book of Job he said when the young lion
[1:20:52] when he cries up for it food who gives
[1:20:54] him food to eat
[1:20:56] who who provides for him who who makes
[1:21:00] sure that all of the seasons and all the
[1:21:02] things works together so they can have
[1:21:04] their food God does that and he does
[1:21:07] that and he says until more aren't you
[1:21:10] more that day then if he can feed the
[1:21:12] bird he can feed all of those things how
[1:21:15] much more would he take care of you but
[1:21:17] yet we are we fail to consider the
[1:21:20] things that he's given us we fail to
[1:21:22] consider his word in our decision making
[1:21:24] and and something will happen and all of
[1:21:27] a sudden our ego gets bruised our pride
[1:21:30] gets bruised and we want to show what we
[1:21:33] can do and we want to use all that we
[1:21:35] can so we can show we are somebody and
[1:21:38] we do that by failing to realize that we
[1:21:41] are have a god a heavenly father who
[1:21:43] cares about us
[1:21:45] will say in the message uh perseverance
[1:21:49] and I want you to hear this it says now
[1:21:52] paragraph 26 it says now
[1:21:55] you got five senses in your body
[1:21:58] God gave you those five senses to
[1:22:01] contact your Earthly home
[1:22:05] God gave you those five senses to
[1:22:08] contact your Earthly home
[1:22:10] it says that sea taste filled smells
[1:22:13] here
[1:22:14] but he says but it has nothing to do
[1:22:17] with God
[1:22:19] it says there isn't any one of them that
[1:22:22] will declare God
[1:22:24] not one of them he says no no because
[1:22:28] they are only given to you to contact
[1:22:30] your Earthly home see test filled smells
[1:22:34] and here says that has nothing to do
[1:22:37] with God at all and people rely upon
[1:22:40] them but you mustn't do that
[1:22:45] is admonishing us you mustn't do that it
[1:22:49] says faith is something different faith
[1:22:52] is the Sixth Sense which which you can
[1:22:55] cut which cut which can contact God you
[1:22:58] can only contact God by The Sixth Sense
[1:23:01] which is Faith he says he that cometh
[1:23:04] must believe that must believe that he
[1:23:06] is and that is a rewarder of them that
[1:23:09] diligently seek after him in other words
[1:23:12] I want to say this if when we come in
[1:23:15] for our Salvation is by faith for our
[1:23:18] deliverance is by faith for everything
[1:23:21] that we have need of is by faith faith
[1:23:24] what what I'm says is a revelation faith
[1:23:27] is the gift of God faith is what God
[1:23:30] gives you in order for you to contact
[1:23:32] him
[1:23:35] and and if we have to contact God by
[1:23:38] faith any other sense is not given for
[1:23:41] us to contact the only way we can
[1:23:43] contact him is by faith faith is the
[1:23:46] only sense that will declare the reality
[1:23:49] of God in your life
[1:23:51] oh my when when you were saved it's not
[1:23:54] because you woke up and said well you
[1:23:57] know I want to be saved today and you
[1:23:59] went to the altar or you did and then
[1:24:01] you feel some tingling and then you say
[1:24:03] I'm saved no something was dropped in
[1:24:06] your heart you heard the word of God you
[1:24:08] believe the word of God and by Faith by
[1:24:11] believing in what you heard something
[1:24:14] changed the nature that was inside of
[1:24:16] you something took you from the things
[1:24:19] that you used to desire and move you
[1:24:21] into the other direction what did that
[1:24:23] Faith did that
[1:24:26] Faith did that so I want to say this I
[1:24:30] want you if you want to know God this
[1:24:32] morning you can only God know God by
[1:24:35] faith
[1:24:36] you can only approach him by faith and
[1:24:39] you can only know him by faith you have
[1:24:41] to come believing that what I'm hearing
[1:24:43] is the word of God and by hearing the
[1:24:46] word of God God will come and take his
[1:24:49] word and make it a reality to you
[1:24:52] oh my and then faith and that God he he
[1:24:58] when we when we we we think I was
[1:25:01] thinking about this you know oftentimes
[1:25:03] you know we we come and we are so
[1:25:06] blessed to to come into the revelation
[1:25:08] of this message and and I'll say this
[1:25:11] never forget that it's a blessing that
[1:25:14] you are sitting here this morning
[1:25:15] because don't ever take it for granted
[1:25:18] any second there's a lot that started
[1:25:21] with you that are not here to this
[1:25:22] morning there's a lot that came with
[1:25:25] great enthusiasm and great gifts and
[1:25:27] they they perform even signs and wonders
[1:25:30] but today they are not even in the
[1:25:32] message to begin with so if you are
[1:25:34] sitting here listening and hearing the
[1:25:37] word of God it's the gift of God to you
[1:25:39] so I was thinking this morning I said oh
[1:25:42] isn't it so amazing now we can you know
[1:25:45] we're here we hear about predestination
[1:25:47] and about God's election and and we
[1:25:50] Rejoice over those things and I want to
[1:25:53] say this there are people on this Earth
[1:25:55] they hear the same thing they hear every
[1:25:59] time you talk about predestination or
[1:26:01] election they look at you to say well
[1:26:03] what do you think you are
[1:26:07] what would you think you something
[1:26:09] special and now you I I didn't say you
[1:26:12] were not predestinated or elected I'm
[1:26:14] just happy to be elected what what makes
[1:26:16] you so mad about it
[1:26:22] isn't it amazing they hear the same word
[1:26:25] they hear the same Prophet speak and to
[1:26:29] them for some reason it's condemnation
[1:26:31] it gets them mad and they rejected by
[1:26:35] you here about the same predestination
[1:26:37] something within your heart say praise
[1:26:39] God for predestination
[1:26:44] I don't know something within my heart
[1:26:46] just when he hears the word I Rejoice
[1:26:49] over it
[1:26:51] and let me tell you this that is faith
[1:26:55] that is the faith of God you you you
[1:26:58] stood up this morning and you dress up
[1:27:00] and you got ready you came you didn't
[1:27:02] come by your own strength you didn't
[1:27:04] come by on my faith leaves you up from
[1:27:07] the bad faith got you ready Fred brought
[1:27:09] you into the house of God
[1:27:11] [Applause]
[1:27:13] I I hope you didn't come because it's
[1:27:16] your favorite preacher or or it's
[1:27:18] whatever you you came because you knew I
[1:27:21] need I have need to hear the word of God
[1:27:23] and Faith Rose you up to bring you here
[1:27:26] this morning
[1:27:28] but and let me say this I'll just jump
[1:27:31] let me say this you you don't never
[1:27:34] leave that
[1:27:35] right don't never get away from that
[1:27:38] don't don't ever move it needs from that
[1:27:41] because God is wanting to build upon
[1:27:43] that anything outside of that is inlay
[1:27:50] anything outside of what God has built
[1:27:54] for himself in your heart is working on
[1:27:57] the intellect
[1:28:04] so I want to say this
[1:28:08] but what I'm saying makes it Satan it
[1:28:10] says to a believer
[1:28:13] it's the faith of God that's moving and
[1:28:16] working in you
[1:28:18] to a believer in other words when when
[1:28:21] something is going on it's when when you
[1:28:24] wake up in the morning and you know it's
[1:28:26] Sunday in the faith and you if if it's
[1:28:29] something that drops in your heart or
[1:28:32] your mind to not come in the faith of
[1:28:34] God begins to work in you the faith of
[1:28:37] God begin to move in you why because the
[1:28:39] faith wants to come and hear the word of
[1:28:41] God because Faith Fades upon the word of
[1:28:44] God faith grows upon the word of God
[1:28:47] faith matures in the presence of the
[1:28:49] word of God faith gains strength in the
[1:28:52] presence of God I tell the dad you feed
[1:28:54] him something as faith will die
[1:29:00] so you you recognize the action of faith
[1:29:04] in your life you you come and you know
[1:29:06] and it's not something we come in this
[1:29:08] morning and say well you know I I don't
[1:29:12] know if I'm really saved
[1:29:18] I I really don't know
[1:29:20] and I say if you don't
[1:29:22] you need to go to the Altar and let God
[1:29:24] confirm it to you
[1:29:27] because I could surely stand here and
[1:29:29] say that I know what I was capable of
[1:29:33] I know what I was able to do I I'm a
[1:29:37] weakness of my own works
[1:29:40] and then at the same time I know that if
[1:29:43] I could be moved from this and become
[1:29:45] someone who's who's in favor whose
[1:29:48] Hearts is burning for God it cannot be
[1:29:50] my imagination it cannot be my strength
[1:29:53] it has to be Faith he has to be God
[1:29:56] moving in me
[1:29:59] don't don't don't don't don't don't come
[1:30:02] you know it's like you go to a doctor
[1:30:04] you know so many times you go and you
[1:30:06] know God will do something Supernatural
[1:30:08] and they'll come in they'll take an
[1:30:10] x-ray or whatever the case is that said
[1:30:12] you have this you have that and all of
[1:30:13] those things that you know the right or
[1:30:15] death sentence and they hand it over to
[1:30:17] you and tell you how you're going to die
[1:30:19] die in a couple of days you come days
[1:30:21] later they take the same thing and
[1:30:23] everything they don't find anything
[1:30:25] instead of testifying to Faith in
[1:30:27] Supernatural they begin to find the
[1:30:29] explanation well maybe the machine was
[1:30:32] not just calibrated right
[1:30:35] don't do that
[1:30:39] God comes and he does something
[1:30:41] Supernatural in your life and then just
[1:30:44] a couple of days later or months by
[1:30:46] Satan shows up with a great explanation
[1:30:49] or you know maybe it wasn't just exactly
[1:30:52] cancer maybe the picture was not taken
[1:30:54] in the right angle no faith come on the
[1:30:58] same God came on the same God changed
[1:31:01] the situation Faith came and brought to
[1:31:04] Victory and you gotta you ought to be
[1:31:06] thanking God for it
[1:31:11] but if Adam says this in the
[1:31:13] ever-present present Rock of the
[1:31:16] ever-present rock it says paragraph 159
[1:31:19] it says it says when you are when you
[1:31:22] are saved listen to this carefully when
[1:31:24] you are saved God gives you Faith to
[1:31:28] raise you from to raise you from The
[1:31:30] Mark of the earth if you can put it out
[1:31:32] on the screen when you are saved God not
[1:31:36] your own faith not something you've
[1:31:38] concocted not you coming up and saying
[1:31:41] well I'm tired of sin I'm going to get
[1:31:43] out no God Of Heaven the creator of
[1:31:46] Heaven and Earth the only Giver of Faith
[1:31:49] he comes down and he gives you Faith to
[1:31:52] raise you from The Mark of the earth
[1:31:54] your faith overcomes the things of the
[1:31:57] world what was he what it says what is
[1:32:00] your faith your faith is that is the act
[1:32:04] that God did in you to make you a son of
[1:32:07] God
[1:32:09] they act that God came by your way when
[1:32:13] you are down in sin and trespasses and
[1:32:15] when you didn't hear your way when you
[1:32:17] don't know the difference between wrong
[1:32:19] and right when you couldn't help
[1:32:21] yourself let me say this faith is not
[1:32:23] for those that can help themselves faith
[1:32:26] is the gift of God to those that don't
[1:32:28] know the way they are lost as the girls
[1:32:31] God comes and he picks you up
[1:32:33] you know that God did this
[1:32:37] I couldn't do this myself
[1:32:43] that's why brother when I'm saying faith
[1:32:45] is something you know
[1:32:47] it's not some oh I oh I the Bible I see
[1:32:51] says this over here no you have to know
[1:32:54] what's in your heart that I am what I am
[1:32:57] by the grace of God I am what I am by
[1:33:00] the grace of God
[1:33:06] he says your faith is that act that God
[1:33:09] had did in your heart in you to make you
[1:33:13] a Son of God you quit your lying you
[1:33:16] quit your stealing it says you quit your
[1:33:19] drinking because for your faith Rises
[1:33:23] you up above it something outside of
[1:33:27] yourself something that God has
[1:33:29] deposited in the heart raises you up
[1:33:32] from all those things and then he says
[1:33:34] amen if I if you don't do it you don't
[1:33:37] have faith in you don't have any faith
[1:33:40] and by faith you are saved and that
[1:33:43] through faith as much Faith you will
[1:33:46] relieve you will be released that's how
[1:33:49] much power you can have because in you
[1:33:53] dwelleth all the power that makes Heaven
[1:33:56] and Earth God
[1:33:59] not a not a a watered-down version of
[1:34:03] God no God the creator of Heaven and
[1:34:06] Earth dwells in your heart
[1:34:12] the trouble about it is we've taken
[1:34:15] faith we put it here we've taken God we
[1:34:18] place him over here and so now we're
[1:34:20] saying I need Faith or do I need God I
[1:34:24] need faith in order for me faith in God
[1:34:26] is the same thing faith is God revealing
[1:34:30] himself in your heart faith is the
[1:34:32] reality of God born within your heart so
[1:34:36] you may know who you're talking to
[1:34:44] oh my
[1:34:46] he says God
[1:34:48] dwelling
[1:34:50] in you
[1:34:51] and you are a son and the daughter of
[1:34:53] God Amen
[1:34:55] there you are
[1:34:57] but it's your faith
[1:34:59] you said according to your faith be it
[1:35:03] unto me if you can't if you thou can't
[1:35:06] believe all things are possible fairly I
[1:35:10] say unto you and if you if I say unto
[1:35:13] you if you say unto this mountain be be
[1:35:15] moved and don't doubt believe what
[1:35:18] believe that was that's what you said
[1:35:21] amen now there's a statement here I want
[1:35:23] to go back to you it says etch much
[1:35:26] faith will be released that's how much
[1:35:28] power you can have now I want you to
[1:35:31] keep that in your mind we'll come back
[1:35:33] to it so we will certainly want to do
[1:35:36] that so and I want to say this uh Power
[1:35:40] that exists in you as a son and the
[1:35:43] daughter of God is Not different from
[1:35:46] the power of creation so so the power
[1:35:49] that came in and get you out of the mark
[1:35:52] and the marking and all of those things
[1:35:54] it's the same power that created heaven
[1:35:56] and earth God doesn't have different
[1:35:58] levels of powers where we can
[1:36:01] discriminate and say well there's one
[1:36:03] God who created the Earth but then
[1:36:05] there's another God who saves man no
[1:36:07] it's the same God it's the same
[1:36:09] attribute remember the prophet tells you
[1:36:10] there's only two Powers it's either the
[1:36:13] power of God or the power of the devil
[1:36:15] and oftentimes I think so many times
[1:36:17] here he is but one of them will talk
[1:36:19] about a man inspired by demons he says
[1:36:23] he will be ten times stronger and people
[1:36:25] couldn't help them down they would talk
[1:36:27] about whether it be a female he talks
[1:36:29] about a sister they try to hold him down
[1:36:31] and they will kick and they will his
[1:36:33] person speaking without even opening
[1:36:35] your mouth and doing just so much power
[1:36:38] and the person that couldn't even be a
[1:36:41] 50 or or 80 pounds or if the devil can
[1:36:46] possess somebody and cause him to do
[1:36:48] that how much more can the power of God
[1:36:50] do in your life this morning
[1:36:54] hey man it's the power of the Living God
[1:36:57] he's the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:37:00] yet we've taken his power we've reduced
[1:37:02] it to nothing we've reduced it to a
[1:37:04] power of healing power of Deliverance
[1:37:07] and power you know that can just raise
[1:37:10] you up but you know not too high it's
[1:37:12] just average
[1:37:15] we sell ourselves short
[1:37:18] it's it's a power by faith
[1:37:23] I want to say this faith is the only
[1:37:27] Supernatural sense
[1:37:30] faith is the only Supernatural sense
[1:37:34] and and I want to be careful in saying
[1:37:36] this all of your other senses
[1:37:39] but one of you say they are given to you
[1:37:41] to communicate with the Earth around you
[1:37:43] and with the world that you are you are
[1:37:46] created in but faith is the only sense
[1:37:49] that's given to you to come to
[1:37:52] communicate with the supernatural God so
[1:37:55] faith is the only Supernatural sense you
[1:37:57] have and I want to say this faith is
[1:38:00] provided you to you as a Believer to
[1:38:03] lift you out of this past house that you
[1:38:05] are closed in
[1:38:08] don't ever forget it
[1:38:10] it's given to you to lift you out of
[1:38:13] this past house this first house all it
[1:38:17] brings is trouble
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:20] it's almost impossible to go a day
[1:38:24] without a trouble an hour without
[1:38:26] trouble coming from somewhere
[1:38:29] oh the children have broken this and
[1:38:31] this is happening that one did this and
[1:38:34] this is going on and everything and
[1:38:35] you're like can I get like 10 minutes of
[1:38:38] peace
[1:38:41] yeah you you'll get into the fixing mode
[1:38:44] every time you got to get this right you
[1:38:46] got to fix that you got to do this you
[1:38:47] got to do this oh but let me say this
[1:38:49] faith is the only Supernatural sense
[1:38:52] that's given to you faith is given to
[1:38:55] you oh I love this and the prophet will
[1:38:57] say this faith is given to you so when
[1:39:00] you go to the doctor and the doctor
[1:39:02] gives you a report after they've done
[1:39:04] all of this scientific everything
[1:39:06] they've given you the news that there's
[1:39:08] no hope for you but Abraham says you
[1:39:11] have the right to petition God so that's
[1:39:13] when you come and say I need to activate
[1:39:16] the supernatural sin I need something
[1:39:19] that's beyond what the five senses are
[1:39:21] giving me and that's why I said you have
[1:39:23] to consider God always before you can
[1:39:26] come up with the final conclusion you
[1:39:28] have the right to be lifted up from
[1:39:31] where you are into the presence of God
[1:39:39] the trouble is we are stuck
[1:39:43] if if you only operate by the five
[1:39:46] senses
[1:39:47] I can't imagine
[1:39:50] the amount of trouble that's around us
[1:39:53] I can't imagine new brand new sense
[1:39:56] that's been created just to disturb you
[1:40:00] two hundred thousand demon demons like
[1:40:02] part of what David said they there
[1:40:07] they're just trying to keep you busy you
[1:40:10] gotta hunt for this you got to do this
[1:40:11] you got to do this but Faith takes you
[1:40:14] out of this world and it brings you into
[1:40:17] the presence of the Living God faith
[1:40:20] will tell you what the original Mind Of
[1:40:22] God was faith will drop something from
[1:40:25] Heaven faith will cause you to look at
[1:40:27] the things around you and say they are
[1:40:29] lying fantasy and I won't take them and
[1:40:33] faith will come and change the
[1:40:34] circumstance
[1:40:40] and let me say this it's given to you to
[1:40:43] get you out of this Fresh House when
[1:40:46] your Saints can see when when your your
[1:40:49] mind runs out of things to think when
[1:40:52] the doctors give you depression when all
[1:40:54] the things come to an end you have faith
[1:40:57] to lift you out of that situation
[1:41:00] don't ever think that everything that
[1:41:03] the doctor tells you is the final
[1:41:06] don't ever let yourself think that
[1:41:09] whatever report you get from school that
[1:41:11] and all of that that's the end of you no
[1:41:14] there's a supernatural God there is
[1:41:17] someone who created the Heaven and Earth
[1:41:19] they someone who's responsible for it
[1:41:22] all that someone who holds your destiny
[1:41:24] in his hand and he has the final say
[1:41:30] I want to say this
[1:41:32] what what we need today more than
[1:41:35] anything is faith
[1:41:36] now because remember I say that
[1:41:39] as much power can be released is based
[1:41:42] upon faith
[1:41:44] if we are sitting here today it's
[1:41:46] because of faith
[1:41:49] you understand that
[1:41:51] if we are going to get anything from God
[1:41:53] it can only be by faith and if we are
[1:41:57] going to get to some Final Destination
[1:41:59] it's only faith that will take us there
[1:42:01] there is no there's no no other way
[1:42:05] around that we can go outside of faith
[1:42:09] but what I'm saying says
[1:42:11] faith
[1:42:13] Faith he talks about in the message a
[1:42:16] super sense
[1:42:18] he says
[1:42:20] and the super sense is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:23] Faith the faith of God that dwells in
[1:42:26] you
[1:42:27] and if you will let that fire if you let
[1:42:30] the five cents yield to The Sixth Sense
[1:42:33] it will guide you and bring all other
[1:42:36] senses under control of the super sense
[1:42:40] so now he's he's lining up for you
[1:42:44] is basically giving you the order of
[1:42:47] operation
[1:42:49] to understand that as a believer
[1:42:51] not just the sixth sense but all of my
[1:42:54] senses have to line up to where the
[1:42:56] Sixth Sense is controlling the five
[1:42:58] sense where the it's not you letting the
[1:43:02] enemy attack you by the five cents and
[1:43:04] loosen it but having the Sixth Sense
[1:43:06] bring calm to the other senses so he
[1:43:09] says for it's so far above the natural
[1:43:14] senses the natural sense as a spiritual
[1:43:17] man is above the natural it's far as
[1:43:21] high as the heavens is above the natural
[1:43:24] man as the five senses it says it makes
[1:43:27] you believe things that you cannot see
[1:43:30] it says it makes you act
[1:43:33] where you would do to think the five
[1:43:36] senses would ever think about it the
[1:43:39] devil can get into these five senses and
[1:43:42] lie to you but he cannot touch the super
[1:43:45] sense
[1:43:47] that's far beyond he's Rich that comes
[1:43:51] from God it's called faith faith is that
[1:43:56] great thing
[1:43:58] oh it's the only sense that's above all
[1:44:02] the other senses it's the sense that the
[1:44:05] devil cannot touch it's the sense that
[1:44:08] God drops him and reveals to you what's
[1:44:12] about to happen and you are at peace no
[1:44:15] matter what trouble is around you
[1:44:17] it says and the five senses doesn't
[1:44:20] control the sixth sense but the six says
[1:44:22] control the five senses the super sense
[1:44:24] control natural senses and the five
[1:44:27] sense as the five sense is see taste
[1:44:30] filled smell here and the super sense is
[1:44:33] something that's make you that that
[1:44:35] makes you that make you believe God's
[1:44:37] word for for that's the only thing that
[1:44:42] he will speak about that he would speak
[1:44:44] about and he makes you believe for
[1:44:46] things that you can't see test mail
[1:44:48] failed here because it takes God's word
[1:44:51] and it will deliver that word to you and
[1:44:55] and make you walk contrary to any other
[1:44:58] thing there is there any other thing
[1:45:01] there be but God's word by faith faith
[1:45:05] does that
[1:45:11] Faith does that
[1:45:14] makes this interesting statement and I
[1:45:18] just put them all together so
[1:45:20] for the sake of time so
[1:45:23] so I don't take too much time it says
[1:45:28] faith is not what you feel
[1:45:32] faith is not what you feel
[1:45:35] faith is what you believe
[1:45:38] you you don't want your Measure of Faith
[1:45:42] to be directly related to how you feel
[1:45:48] because then every morning your faith is
[1:45:50] like ground level
[1:45:54] until you've had your coffee or you'll
[1:45:57] express her your whatever it is that you
[1:45:58] do
[1:46:03] or when everything goes and your faith
[1:46:06] God comes diving with it
[1:46:08] good yes preach it's not attached to
[1:46:11] emotion
[1:46:16] faith is not a myth
[1:46:19] we think faith is in some type of
[1:46:21] imagination of some reality that don't
[1:46:24] exist
[1:46:25] it says no faith is not an imagination
[1:46:27] faith is something you know that's why I
[1:46:31] said here frankly something you know and
[1:46:33] let me repeat it again we have to be
[1:46:36] built on the right foundation of faith
[1:46:39] we have to be built upon the foundation
[1:46:41] of faith that God started
[1:46:45] not that we have amassed and gathered
[1:46:48] and figured out what God is and what God
[1:46:50] is Not faith is only based upon what God
[1:46:53] did so in other words every time you
[1:46:56] come to God you have to remind him of
[1:46:59] what he has done
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:03] to start on the right foundation you
[1:47:06] have to be based not what he did for
[1:47:08] someone over here no God I am here
[1:47:11] because you saved me you took me out of
[1:47:14] sin I didn't know who you were I wasn't
[1:47:16] looking for you I'm not a good person
[1:47:19] I'm not this you made me what I am you
[1:47:22] chose me you Reveal Your word to me you
[1:47:25] come and you brought me out of my family
[1:47:27] you brought me out of my country you set
[1:47:29] me up at this faith I'm coming on the
[1:47:32] basis of that and saying I have a need
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:41] that's the foundation
[1:47:43] oftentimes we operate on the foundation
[1:47:45] that's not ours
[1:47:47] come on
[1:47:49] that's good
[1:47:52] we come on the foundation of of things
[1:47:55] we have intellectually put together you
[1:47:58] know goddess and this God did this then
[1:48:00] you can come and now you are on the
[1:48:03] right foundation now you can stand there
[1:48:05] and you can say you put me out and you
[1:48:08] did this just like you did in the Bible
[1:48:10] and you promised that if I come my word
[1:48:12] just like you did for Enoch just like
[1:48:15] you did for Joshua that's like you did
[1:48:17] for such inside I am coming on the same
[1:48:20] basis because those people didn't get to
[1:48:23] where they were by themselves you place
[1:48:25] them there you call them you chose them
[1:48:28] so the same God who called them the same
[1:48:31] God who called me I am coming to you now
[1:48:37] Foundation of faith
[1:48:42] faith
[1:48:44] is not something you manufactured
[1:48:49] God Of Heaven and Earth and you created
[1:48:52] the planes and the mountains and you
[1:48:55] created the axis of the earth and you
[1:48:57] keep it stabilized
[1:49:02] foreign
[1:49:19] we think we are trying to impress God we
[1:49:22] can't impress God he knows all about us
[1:49:25] he knows when we're faking it or you
[1:49:28] know oh Lord I love you he knows there's
[1:49:30] nothing that identify what you're saying
[1:49:34] that's right
[1:49:36] if we can only be honest God right now I
[1:49:39] I don't feel right I I don't feel like
[1:49:41] it I I I I I I feel like my love has
[1:49:44] gone down I feel like I'm not done fire
[1:49:46] the way I used to be I don't feel like
[1:49:48] I'm a Christian I don't feel stop there
[1:49:51] he will identify himself to you he will
[1:49:54] find you somewhere remember but when I'm
[1:49:57] said God a job was looking for a
[1:50:00] go-between he was looking for someone
[1:50:03] who can take his word interpret it to a
[1:50:05] living God here's a sinful man and all
[1:50:08] he knows is he didn't do anything wrong
[1:50:10] and he's trying to justify himself but
[1:50:13] yet before the holy God nothing can
[1:50:15] touch him everything is sin so job said
[1:50:18] that he needed someone who can come and
[1:50:21] put one hand on the sinful man and
[1:50:23] another God or another hand on the holy
[1:50:26] God a god between something who
[1:50:29] understand both sides
[1:50:34] we have a petitioner we have even Jesus
[1:50:39] Christ
[1:50:39] he was 100 man he was 100 God he knows
[1:50:44] the issues concerning man he knows she's
[1:50:47] concerning God that's the only place man
[1:50:50] and God can come together is by Jesus
[1:50:53] Christ that's why the prophet said
[1:50:55] there's only one place that God meets a
[1:50:57] man under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:01] someone who can bring them both together
[1:51:04] who understand your need who understand
[1:51:07] the depths of your heart who understand
[1:51:10] your frustration
[1:51:17] sorry I don't think I'm going to be gone
[1:51:19] anyway
[1:51:23] but what I'm says faith is not a hope so
[1:51:30] you know Christians sometimes will
[1:51:31] become like people
[1:51:33] just throwing out throw everything that
[1:51:36] you can and see what will stick
[1:51:42] anybody can identify with that that's
[1:51:45] not God
[1:51:46] we can't come it's not by chance it's
[1:51:49] not oh I don't know what works but you
[1:51:52] know I'm good with it and then next time
[1:51:55] you come you play the same game
[1:51:57] no
[1:51:58] that's not the relationship he's looking
[1:52:01] for
[1:52:02] faith is something you know
[1:52:04] you can come every time and get the same
[1:52:07] result
[1:52:13] it says it's not a hope so or it could
[1:52:17] be right
[1:52:19] it's got to be absolutely a man
[1:52:26] good you're finding all of them let's
[1:52:27] get
[1:52:30] let's get it's got to be absolutely a
[1:52:34] man
[1:52:35] an absolute
[1:52:37] but when it says faith final resting
[1:52:39] place is the word of God a firm
[1:52:42] foundation something that doesn't sink
[1:52:45] it will be the same yesterday today and
[1:52:49] forever it will produce the same results
[1:52:52] every time what would the prophet say
[1:52:54] that if any man ever come the same way
[1:52:56] that the other men came God was
[1:52:58] obligated to do the same thing
[1:53:03] he says
[1:53:07] it's absolutely amen it's the ultimate
[1:53:10] it's your absolute it's the thing that
[1:53:12] that you are tied to Faith is not
[1:53:15] scientific
[1:53:20] in other words I've learned and I've
[1:53:22] studied a Bible and
[1:53:24] and somehow I feel like I can figure
[1:53:26] that God out
[1:53:31] so many times I like to respond to
[1:53:33] brother Brandon people will come and say
[1:53:34] oh you you don't know your Bible you
[1:53:37] don't understand why would you say this
[1:53:38] and then says you know I don't know that
[1:53:41] you may be right I may not know my Bible
[1:53:43] but I know the author real well
[1:53:46] I understand the reveal it real well
[1:53:48] because if I if if I'm let me say this
[1:53:51] the ground upon which you are standing
[1:53:53] is the ground of Faith it's always built
[1:53:56] upon the work that God did he knew that
[1:53:59] I'm standing here because an angel told
[1:54:01] me to do this
[1:54:05] yeah
[1:54:07] he said if you think what I'm saying is
[1:54:10] wrong you come and stand to my right
[1:54:12] hand because he knew who was standing
[1:54:13] there
[1:54:16] if you think you can correct me come
[1:54:18] stand to my right nobody ever did
[1:54:21] and now there are all kinds of critics
[1:54:23] raise up and everything where were you
[1:54:33] faith is truth
[1:54:37] faith is something that you know
[1:54:39] positive
[1:54:44] positive off faith is nothing you guess
[1:54:48] at Faith is what you know faith is the
[1:54:52] key
[1:54:54] but what I'm saying is in a message only
[1:54:56] believe
[1:54:57] it says now
[1:55:02] it says now
[1:55:05] it says now
[1:55:07] if we who have who are acquainted with a
[1:55:10] supernatural
[1:55:13] we'll just take a man
[1:55:16] where man
[1:55:19] where the man in his senses is limited
[1:55:21] by his senses
[1:55:23] but man in his spirit is unlimited
[1:55:27] the tree of knowledge can only can only
[1:55:30] climb so far and breaks back
[1:55:33] but the Tree of Life Goes On
[1:55:37] forever
[1:55:39] and how that science can take man father
[1:55:43] with his senses than we have with his
[1:55:47] soul
[1:55:49] it says well with God on top resources
[1:55:53] where all things are possible
[1:55:56] talk about the split of an atom
[1:55:59] and let me say this a Believer by faith
[1:56:03] you are being given access
[1:56:06] to resources that the world knows
[1:56:10] nothing about
[1:56:11] we we have to come with an understanding
[1:56:14] that I have been given access to every
[1:56:18] promise in the Bible by faith that I'm
[1:56:21] not coming by guessing
[1:56:24] or by trying to figure this thing out
[1:56:26] I'm coming because by faith I'm being
[1:56:30] given access to the whole entire Bible
[1:56:33] and let me say this this morning this
[1:56:36] book is the record of people that live
[1:56:39] by faith and what they were able to
[1:56:42] produce and the prophet came and told
[1:56:44] you in this age that we are going to
[1:56:47] write another book of Acts in other
[1:56:49] words people that have received the word
[1:56:51] of God that are supposed to produce
[1:56:54] works that are according to the same
[1:56:56] Bible
[1:56:59] this is the record of What Faith Can Do
[1:57:01] so if you have faith and you have a
[1:57:04] problem just go read the book of record
[1:57:06] okay what's going on here what's my
[1:57:09] problem well you know I have a sickness
[1:57:11] that the doctor says they can't help me
[1:57:13] oh really let me see if it's in the
[1:57:15] record Oh by faith the woman with a
[1:57:18] blood issue he came and he touched Jesus
[1:57:21] and by touching Jesus his blood problem
[1:57:23] was gone I have a record therefore I
[1:57:26] come before God oh Lord of Heaven and
[1:57:29] Earth I have a problem and I found it in
[1:57:32] the book of record I am coming upon the
[1:57:34] same basis so I can receive the same
[1:57:37] result
[1:57:38] [Music]
[1:57:40] where do you put your faith in
[1:57:45] the application of faith and let me jump
[1:57:48] forward and say this every person that
[1:57:51] you read in this book that had claimed
[1:57:53] to have faith there was some action
[1:57:56] attached to it
[1:57:59] by faith Enoch by faith Moses they're
[1:58:03] insane by faith Moses he just said in
[1:58:06] the house of pharaoh and he was
[1:58:09] contented with what he was and
[1:58:11] everything just went fine and after
[1:58:14] years he became king and then he let the
[1:58:16] children of God go no by faith he
[1:58:20] refused The Possession not the world had
[1:58:22] given him he rejected everything that
[1:58:25] the five senses had told him he went out
[1:58:28] into the Wilderness by faith God came
[1:58:31] and he testified to thy faith and what
[1:58:33] about him says God came an anointed our
[1:58:36] faith when God anointed our faith Moses
[1:58:40] came and he did the job that he was
[1:58:42] placed to do what we
[1:58:44] is an anointing of our faith God I know
[1:58:47] you place me here to be a pride you
[1:58:49] blessed me here to be an overcomer I
[1:58:52] need an anointing of that Faith so I can
[1:58:55] express what's inside of me to express
[1:58:57] but it's only by faith
[1:59:09] what when I'm says
[1:59:12] faith
[1:59:14] is the master
[1:59:16] of all circumstances
[1:59:19] notice now his haves
[1:59:22] faith
[1:59:24] perfect faith is the master of our
[1:59:26] circumstance perfect Faith Masters all
[1:59:30] circumstance listen now he says no
[1:59:33] matter what it is
[1:59:34] it Masters it
[1:59:38] no matter what it is
[1:59:42] a masters in
[1:59:44] now just watch
[1:59:46] when you believe anything do anything
[1:59:50] will you go you got faith in what you
[1:59:53] are doing no matter what the
[1:59:55] circumstance is don't have one thing to
[1:59:59] do with it see it Masters that
[2:00:01] circumstance if it's if it's in the room
[2:00:04] of of a room of sickness or the Lord has
[2:00:08] revealed to you is the Lord has revealed
[2:00:10] that these certain things is going to
[2:00:12] take place just speak on and go on
[2:00:16] now
[2:00:26] say this because I I feel this is
[2:00:29] important the the we we
[2:00:32] God works on the basis of faith and to
[2:00:37] this faith is a living faith
[2:00:42] is an alive faith is not some dormant
[2:00:46] thing that we let sit somewhere and then
[2:00:49] and then we come every once in a while
[2:00:51] and try to pick it up
[2:00:53] no it's a living faith that we walk by
[2:00:57] we live by we breathe by every day
[2:01:00] it's this connection that you have with
[2:01:03] God and this attentiveness to the spirit
[2:01:06] and what's it what he wants you to do
[2:01:08] and I want to say this and I want to be
[2:01:11] careful in heinous often time we try to
[2:01:15] work from an angle of frustration
[2:01:21] things are not going within the way we
[2:01:23] want and the other thing it's like oh
[2:01:25] come on in it but but the source of it
[2:01:27] is frustration
[2:01:30] we try to work from an angle of of Pride
[2:01:34] oh I can't believe I'm a Son of God and
[2:01:36] this and this it won't work
[2:01:41] that's why I titled it faith faith faith
[2:01:46] this is a faith I'm trying to speak
[2:01:47] about faith that is motivated by love so
[2:01:51] we come in and it's a pride oh it's a
[2:01:55] shame or anything we we try or or we
[2:01:59] feel hopeless and then we cry out we
[2:02:01] won't pay
[2:02:05] but there has to be a faith that
[2:02:08] operates by love
[2:02:11] there has to be a faith that operates by
[2:02:15] love Faith is the master of all
[2:02:18] circumstances so faith comes into the
[2:02:21] situation now remember faith is always
[2:02:25] looking for the will of God faith is
[2:02:28] always in tune with what God wants done
[2:02:30] with the situation faith is always in
[2:02:33] tune with I'm here Lord how would you
[2:02:35] use me what would you have me to do what
[2:02:38] would you do this and do that and then
[2:02:40] faith comes in and he operates from that
[2:02:43] angle faith is not based upon your own
[2:02:46] intellect where you can come and call it
[2:02:48] whenever you are
[2:02:50] is based upon forgiveness but Abraham
[2:02:53] says and it's based upon love
[2:02:56] and let me say this let me just jump
[2:03:00] ahead for the sake of time
[2:03:03] but what I'm going to say this and and
[2:03:05] many many says and many uh many of you
[2:03:09] friends they are praying and fasting and
[2:03:12] afraid to take hold of what you are
[2:03:14] praying for that's right well it won't
[2:03:17] do you any good to fast and pray unless
[2:03:19] you got some Works to go with it it says
[2:03:22] all Faith all the faith all your faith
[2:03:25] in the world won't do you a bit of good
[2:03:28] lest you step right out and talk to talk
[2:03:31] with it and take it that's all that's
[2:03:34] all it says you've got to go forward
[2:03:36] just go you it says you just gotta step
[2:03:39] it take a step right out and do it
[2:03:41] anyhow when you ask for anything to get
[2:03:44] it God it says God said it's yours so
[2:03:48] don't take anything less get what you
[2:03:51] asked for it says you do that and find
[2:03:54] out how it's going to work out it says
[2:03:56] yeah don't back up just say okay I'll
[2:04:00] I'll take second or say oh well I'll
[2:04:02] take some okay so he's saying you we
[2:04:05] take what God has said faith is based
[2:04:08] upon the word of God so when we come and
[2:04:10] praying and asking we come in and and we
[2:04:13] have something that we have need of when
[2:04:15] we have asked for we step right in when
[2:04:17] we go forward
[2:04:20] he says this
[2:04:22] you say
[2:04:24] well what good will Faith have this is
[2:04:28] in a message a way of Fellowship
[2:04:31] what good you say what good would it do
[2:04:34] to have faith it says faith
[2:04:38] signed your pardon
[2:04:42] faith can come in this morning and can
[2:04:45] sign your pardon
[2:04:48] frustration will not get you anywhere
[2:04:52] we we are not called to be beggars we
[2:04:56] are the children of God
[2:04:58] we have to approach him on the basis of
[2:05:01] what he has allowed us to come in with
[2:05:04] we have to come in this morning and say
[2:05:07] what is the basis of me coming today
[2:05:10] before God and what am I asking and you
[2:05:13] have to come in and stand upon the
[2:05:16] promise that he has given you for you to
[2:05:18] claim what you have need of he says
[2:05:21] faith can sign your pardon sure it says
[2:05:24] it says that's the value of Faith don't
[2:05:27] be worried don't be scared don't be
[2:05:29] upset just have faith and believe and
[2:05:32] the only way you can have faith you have
[2:05:35] to have love first
[2:05:39] amen
[2:05:44] you have to have love
[2:05:47] first
[2:05:53] for love
[2:05:56] produces
[2:05:58] faith
[2:06:02] now that's what I've been trying to say
[2:06:08] love
[2:06:10] produces
[2:06:11] faith
[2:06:14] for perfect love and I thought brother
[2:06:17] Mike just hit it on the nail when he
[2:06:19] read that switch I said that's it
[2:06:23] perfect love
[2:06:25] cast out fears
[2:06:28] and I'm gonna just jump so I could get
[2:06:31] to the end here
[2:06:34] it's important
[2:06:36] but what I'm going to say
[2:06:38] we have an understanding that everything
[2:06:41] God does it does by love
[2:06:44] now remember we read the statement that
[2:06:47] your that as much faith or as much power
[2:06:52] could be released is based upon the
[2:06:54] amount of faith that you have
[2:06:56] and and like I said it's important that
[2:07:01] we have we have the right basis of our
[2:07:03] faith
[2:07:04] and and I was thinking about the prophet
[2:07:07] and most times then you would
[2:07:09] hear those prayer lines and and think
[2:07:12] and he would come and it would the
[2:07:15] description that he gave he said you
[2:07:16] know this poor mother and had this
[2:07:19] little baby wrapped in clothes and he
[2:07:21] died the night before and he came in and
[2:07:24] so many big uh you know people trying to
[2:07:27] stop him and she was only this shorter
[2:07:29] but then she pushed forward this so she
[2:07:31] can come and everything he will give you
[2:07:33] the description and sometimes he will
[2:07:35] tell you while I walk in this Homeland
[2:07:37] it looked like it was not much of
[2:07:39] anything and but yet I saw the picture
[2:07:41] of my Lord Jesus Christ now he's talking
[2:07:44] to you about the basis of his faith
[2:07:49] I want you to pay close attention he'll
[2:07:51] come and say well you know I'll take my
[2:07:54] food and put next to him and look at him
[2:07:56] and said perhaps my shoe can feed him
[2:07:59] and anything I can do the basis of it it
[2:08:02] wasn't so people can know that it's a
[2:08:04] prophet
[2:08:05] it wasn't so he can do some great
[2:08:07] demonstration the way he always
[2:08:10] approached it is always by love I even
[2:08:12] remember when he's talking about the the
[2:08:14] killable and when he's talking about the
[2:08:16] Hornets he didn't come and say hey kill
[2:08:19] a bull I'm the prophet of God and I have
[2:08:21] some important mission
[2:08:25] he didn't come and say I'm a Son of God
[2:08:27] and I say go back to where you belong no
[2:08:30] there was always love that was projected
[2:08:33] there was always the love of God that
[2:08:35] went on first because he knew if it was
[2:08:38] by love nothing can conquer love
[2:08:42] but the thing is we go by it by
[2:08:44] frustration rather than by law
[2:08:48] we stand on trying to demonstrate to
[2:08:51] somebody that we have faith
[2:08:55] it's not now I could read the scripture
[2:08:58] and I'm running out of time the the
[2:09:00] scripture says love doesn't try to prove
[2:09:03] anything
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:06] loved us and lift itself up and loved us
[2:09:10] in cast a shadow and do this and do love
[2:09:13] is humble love is me love is interested
[2:09:16] in one thing I need to present to you
[2:09:19] the love of God where did that love come
[2:09:21] from it's the same love that saved me
[2:09:23] that's why you can't you can't do
[2:09:26] anything for anybody unless you yourself
[2:09:28] have been touched
[2:09:32] you talk about a God that you don't know
[2:09:34] you don't know what it means to be safe
[2:09:37] how are you going to talk about saving
[2:09:44] but one of them says when love is
[2:09:46] projected when I love because now it's
[2:09:49] no longer just you it's you reflecting
[2:09:52] the very attribute of God through you
[2:09:54] going directly to the individual now
[2:09:57] it's God himself being reflected and now
[2:10:00] you're bringing him to the greatest
[2:10:02] power there is love
[2:10:05] Faith motivated by love
[2:10:08] says this it says
[2:10:11] he says
[2:10:13] and he says this
[2:10:15] I want I want you to get this now and
[2:10:18] this is in perfect Faith the church has
[2:10:20] got to be lifted up in the power of God
[2:10:23] he says it says how we are too close to
[2:10:27] the end now and I believe that the
[2:10:30] church is in condition where we can
[2:10:32] teach the little a little deeper thing
[2:10:34] to rub off some of the make-believe out
[2:10:37] and get into something real it's got to
[2:10:40] be something that you know now the
[2:10:43] scripture will say in Galatians chapter
[2:10:45] 5 and I'll read just verse 5 and 6 it
[2:10:48] says for it says for the for for through
[2:10:51] the spirit we wait for the hope of
[2:10:54] righteousness by faith it says for in
[2:10:57] Jesus Christ neither circumcise uh are
[2:11:01] valid anything no uncircumcised by faith
[2:11:04] which worketh by love
[2:11:08] but to Faith whose motivation is love
[2:11:11] and what Abraham says this and Faith
[2:11:14] this is in perfect Faith paragraph 126
[2:11:17] and faith and love is relation because
[2:11:20] you can't have faith unless you've got
[2:11:22] love because your faith is in The God
[2:11:25] Who is the very essence of love Faith
[2:11:29] and love works together
[2:11:32] [Music]
[2:11:35] thank you Lord
[2:11:39] when you look at a situation
[2:11:43] what is your motive for that situation
[2:11:45] to be changed
[2:11:47] it's just because you're tired of seeing
[2:11:49] it
[2:11:50] you're tired of anything
[2:11:52] it's good to be tired but your
[2:11:54] motivation has to be Faith by love
[2:11:58] your motivation because Faith but when I
[2:12:02] will say as we read it here
[2:12:05] Faith or love is what created what
[2:12:10] creates faith
[2:12:13] the more love we have
[2:12:15] the more faith we're going to have
[2:12:21] but it has to start by love
[2:12:25] you know it's not okay
[2:12:28] to talk about how bad someone is
[2:12:31] if there's no love to go help
[2:12:38] it's not okay to talk about how sinful
[2:12:41] someone lives if you don't have love in
[2:12:44] your heart to go help them that that's
[2:12:46] the difference between criticism and
[2:12:48] faith
[2:12:51] amen
[2:12:56] it's not okay to to just come and and
[2:13:00] see this wrong and see that wrong and
[2:13:02] see this wrong because the reason you do
[2:13:05] that is because your basis is not Faith
[2:13:07] it's criticism but if your faith your
[2:13:11] base is love that I want to see God move
[2:13:13] in this place I want to see God heal
[2:13:15] people I want to see God move people
[2:13:17] from here to there I want to see God
[2:13:19] save and and I want to see the
[2:13:21] manifestation of God you have to start
[2:13:24] by love
[2:13:28] love is the very source of faith
[2:13:31] we want to operate the power by
[2:13:34] frustration
[2:13:39] so people can think we are the biggest
[2:13:41] church we are the best church we have
[2:13:44] the church on fire
[2:13:49] start by love
[2:13:52] love will give you what you're looking
[2:13:54] for
[2:13:55] and yet it will keep you humble
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:04] the more love we can have the more faith
[2:14:07] we're going to have
[2:14:08] but but when I'm I was thinking is
[2:14:10] talking and and I know I'm running out
[2:14:13] of time if you excuse me
[2:14:18] yeah he is he's
[2:14:19] about
[2:14:21] the the boy in in the story about the
[2:14:23] boy in Finland I'll skip some so I can
[2:14:25] try to get somewhere
[2:14:28] and I'll read it from what Christ speak
[2:14:31] and I want you to see now this is
[2:14:34] something that was revealed to him or
[2:14:36] given to him in a vision two years ago
[2:14:39] and now he finds himself in a situation
[2:14:42] and paragraph it at 88 and he says and I
[2:14:45] looked around and it was exactly and it
[2:14:47] was exactly the way the Holy Spirit told
[2:14:49] me two years before
[2:14:52] it says when all that it says when all
[2:14:55] of you wrote in your Bible Across the
[2:14:58] Nation that it would happen and out
[2:15:00] there and then the situation is in hand
[2:15:02] it says no matter how dead it says no
[2:15:05] matter how dead he is no matter what
[2:15:08] anybody else said it's all over he says
[2:15:11] he's got to come back and he's talking
[2:15:13] about the boy and he says I said if this
[2:15:16] child that's going to raise up from the
[2:15:18] dead it says then I'm a false prophet
[2:15:21] now I want you to what is the basis on
[2:15:25] the which is saying we'll find it at the
[2:15:28] very end so he's not here now boasting
[2:15:31] about himself and say well then I'm a
[2:15:33] false prophet no he is now so confident
[2:15:36] about what God told him that there's
[2:15:39] nothing that can stop him he wants you
[2:15:41] to know that if God doesn't come then
[2:15:43] you don't now I'll tell you we wouldn't
[2:15:45] have to believe what he's saying here if
[2:15:47] it didn't happen
[2:15:49] now because he doesn't want you to be
[2:15:51] built upon him he wants you to be built
[2:15:53] upon God
[2:15:54] now it says you you call me a false
[2:15:58] prophet I'm a misinterpretation of God
[2:16:00] for in the Homeland two years ago he
[2:16:03] says he told me this would happen and
[2:16:06] there it says that these ministers and
[2:16:08] all it's wrote on the uh a flight lift
[2:16:11] of of our Bible and here it is exactly
[2:16:14] read off of the the fly live and how it
[2:16:17] would be in this in a country it says
[2:16:21] um uh lapping rocks and so forth and be
[2:16:24] killed and it says be on the right hand
[2:16:26] uh side of the road and I said there it
[2:16:29] is nothing can stop it the situation is
[2:16:32] already under control
[2:16:34] that's what faith will do for you
[2:16:38] working not scoring crazy over there and
[2:16:40] everything and you go on your knees and
[2:16:43] when you stand up you know the situation
[2:16:46] is under control listen to what he says
[2:16:48] he says the faith that was within me my
[2:16:52] heart was anointed the faith that was in
[2:16:56] my heart was anointed my brother my
[2:16:59] sister what we need is God not to give
[2:17:02] us some new Faith somewhere but to
[2:17:04] anoint what that which is within us by
[2:17:07] the preaching of the word by prayer Lord
[2:17:10] I just want what's within me to be
[2:17:12] anointed and then it says if he could
[2:17:14] only if I could only explain that faith
[2:17:17] that God it says ahead in God it says
[2:17:21] that told me he never failed he told me
[2:17:23] the situation is under control now he
[2:17:26] says here is exactly what I showed you
[2:17:28] two years ago and yes laying exactly in
[2:17:31] other the only thing you have to do is
[2:17:34] speak the word and the little boy Rise
[2:17:37] Up from the dead
[2:17:43] and it happened
[2:17:45] you know why I say that to say
[2:17:48] the same Prophet comes it says now
[2:17:52] we have a more sure word of Prophecy
[2:17:55] he says this Bible this word is more
[2:17:59] sure than a prophecy yes
[2:18:02] yes it's more sure than a vision this is
[2:18:05] more sure than what he just told you
[2:18:07] what he just did there he says that
[2:18:10] every time you read this this will never
[2:18:13] change this Ephesian can fail but the
[2:18:16] word cannot fail
[2:18:23] but yet our faith
[2:18:25] will let the anointing
[2:18:28] to coming
[2:18:30] but when I'm says faith will put you in
[2:18:32] action
[2:18:33] when you hear the word of God
[2:18:37] it says
[2:18:39] listen to this
[2:18:41] perfect Faith they said
[2:18:45] here
[2:18:48] paragraph 127
[2:18:51] he's talking about the relationship of
[2:18:53] love
[2:18:56] here just like a young couple
[2:18:59] you take a man and a young woman and
[2:19:01] they love and they fall in love one with
[2:19:03] another
[2:19:04] and they go along being it says being
[2:19:07] begin to know one another more and their
[2:19:10] hearts just being Beat Just it began to
[2:19:14] beat as one and
[2:19:15] they're not husband and wife but they
[2:19:18] love binds them together
[2:19:20] they have confidence with one another
[2:19:23] and if they really love one another
[2:19:26] really love one it says really love and
[2:19:31] you know that the girl love and and and
[2:19:34] you know that the girl loves you and
[2:19:37] that she knows
[2:19:39] that you love her
[2:19:41] You've Got Confidence it says faith in
[2:19:45] one another if you got faith in one
[2:19:48] another
[2:19:49] if you didn't you would do better not
[2:19:52] marry her
[2:19:53] notice
[2:19:55] you got you have you got you got to have
[2:19:57] faith
[2:19:58] and you separate them and put them one
[2:20:01] extreme self in one extreme North SM is
[2:20:04] still that love bits in the heart of one
[2:20:06] another
[2:20:07] no matter what it says no matter where
[2:20:10] they're at they're just as true to one
[2:20:13] another as they can be because they love
[2:20:16] one for another listen now and if you
[2:20:19] love the Lord
[2:20:21] not just trying to dodge hell
[2:20:25] but you love the Lord then you have
[2:20:28] faith in God see if you love him
[2:20:34] I I thought is our motivation it's just
[2:20:38] we don't want to go to hell you know
[2:20:40] that's why we come to church you know
[2:20:42] I've heard hell is a bad place I don't
[2:20:44] want to go to it and therefore I will
[2:20:46] believe so I don't go there
[2:20:48] and I say this that's not bad but that's
[2:20:51] not enough
[2:20:56] that's not enough
[2:21:00] and
[2:21:04] he says yeah they are they were together
[2:21:08] and they were separate apart
[2:21:11] but the heart still beats one for
[2:21:14] another you were separated from God
[2:21:18] but yet your heart somewhere
[2:21:20] we're still beating for God no wonder
[2:21:23] when you heard the word you recognize
[2:21:25] the heartbeat no matter no wonder when
[2:21:27] you heard the message something when
[2:21:29] Nino Han said I don't know how to
[2:21:31] explain it they something strange about
[2:21:33] this why it's the heartbeat that you had
[2:21:36] in the beginning
[2:21:37] it's not just talking about some random
[2:21:40] examples
[2:21:42] if you're talking about somebody whose
[2:21:44] heartbeat does not change
[2:21:49] and the faith that is based upon this
[2:21:52] love
[2:21:54] will always overcome
[2:22:00] he says
[2:22:06] if the musician could come
[2:22:13] Paul
[2:22:25] speaks in First Corinthians 13 and 1 and
[2:22:28] says
[2:22:30] though I speak with tongue of tongues of
[2:22:33] men and Angel
[2:22:35] and have no charity I have come a
[2:22:37] sounding rise and tinkling symbol and
[2:22:41] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[2:22:44] and understand all the Mysteries and
[2:22:46] knowledge and
[2:22:47] though I have all faith and so and so
[2:22:50] that I can move mountains and
[2:22:52] have no charity of nothing
[2:22:55] it says and though I bestow all my goods
[2:22:59] and to feed the poor and though I give
[2:23:02] my heart and my body to be burned and
[2:23:04] have no at no charity a perfect me
[2:23:07] nothing charity suffer long
[2:23:10] and it's kind charity and vinod
[2:23:13] charity wanted not itself and the
[2:23:16] prophet not do not behave itself
[2:23:19] unseemingly seek it not her own glory
[2:23:23] and is not provoked easily provoked or
[2:23:25] think of No Evil
[2:23:28] he says
[2:23:30] Rejoice is not in iniquity or rejoice it
[2:23:33] not in in in the rejected not iniquity
[2:23:36] but rejoices in the truth not beareth
[2:23:39] all things believeth all things hope
[2:23:40] with all things and do with all things
[2:23:42] charity never fails
[2:23:45] I I want to ask this morning
[2:23:49] is your heartbeat really
[2:23:52] A Love Affair or is it moved away from
[2:23:55] the love of hair
[2:23:58] is it become
[2:24:01] something that we've taken out of love
[2:24:05] and it's become some principle or some
[2:24:08] doctrines that we walk by and and we
[2:24:11] stand firm and every time somebody
[2:24:13] strive to move away from the ranks we
[2:24:15] remind him that we have a principle to
[2:24:18] keep
[2:24:20] or is it something a love that motivates
[2:24:23] a love that's there to correct a love
[2:24:26] that's there to pick us up when we are
[2:24:29] down a love that's there to direct when
[2:24:31] someone is misguided a love that's there
[2:24:34] to always make a way a love that's there
[2:24:36] with one goal that he wants all of us to
[2:24:39] make it
[2:24:45] but when I was speaking
[2:24:51] he talks about a story of a young couple
[2:24:54] he says he talks about this he says this
[2:24:57] girl was a
[2:24:59] she was a Christian she would mean she
[2:25:02] had been a Christian for years but the
[2:25:04] young man was just converted and he's
[2:25:06] been a Christian for about two years I
[2:25:08] believe he said and then the the Mary
[2:25:10] together and and and and and this is the
[2:25:14] basis that the the young girl is
[2:25:17] realizing that this man and uh this
[2:25:20] young boy and has just became a
[2:25:22] Christian for about two years and and
[2:25:24] now he's talking to him and and look at
[2:25:27] the basis that is placing the love so
[2:25:30] that the man would have a proper
[2:25:32] understanding of what the what she feels
[2:25:34] for him it says she had been a Christian
[2:25:37] for many years with this young girl for
[2:25:39] a couple of years and and they fell in
[2:25:41] love and he says they got married and
[2:25:43] they loved one another and had
[2:25:45] confidence with one another they got
[2:25:46] married and and and and and and so that
[2:25:49] same woman and he says it says it must
[2:25:52] be hard on you you are just a young
[2:25:54] Christian I've had so many much to go uh
[2:25:58] with through with it says I said and
[2:26:01] you've had so much to go down with it
[2:26:03] says drinking is what it is it says
[2:26:06] you've got so much to go through with
[2:26:08] and and and said I know you are bound to
[2:26:12] be tempted hopefully uh awfully hard and
[2:26:16] said I want you to know one thing now
[2:26:19] it says if you happen to fall if you
[2:26:23] happen to fall into temptation it's over
[2:26:27] and is overcome don't stay away
[2:26:30] come home back come on back home
[2:26:36] now
[2:26:37] I say this this is the same Foundation
[2:26:40] that God is blessing upon you this
[2:26:42] morning
[2:26:43] if you happen to make a mistake
[2:26:46] if you happen to have gone astray if you
[2:26:50] happen to have done something you were
[2:26:52] not supposed to do if you happen to to
[2:26:55] have uh I thought you've gone astray
[2:26:57] I've messed it all up I've done wrong
[2:26:59] he's saying that don't stay away come
[2:27:02] back home come on come on back home
[2:27:04] don't stay away from home come on Becca
[2:27:08] he says you come right back cause I'm
[2:27:11] going to be right here waiting for you
[2:27:14] he says I'm going to help you pray
[2:27:17] through and again until you get Victory
[2:27:20] I'm going to stay here with you because
[2:27:23] then I because because when I married
[2:27:26] you I married you because I loved you
[2:27:30] now I I I this is not just a story I I
[2:27:35] think we forget to very understand the
[2:27:37] very love of God for us this is the love
[2:27:39] that fought for you this is the love
[2:27:42] that went to hell for you this is the
[2:27:44] love that gave Christ on the calvary for
[2:27:46] you this is the love that can never be
[2:27:49] defeated if faith cannot be defeated
[2:27:51] love cannot be defeated but Madam says
[2:27:54] the love is the greatest force on Earth
[2:27:57] there is nothing that love cannot
[2:27:59] overcome so he's telling you this
[2:28:02] morning you are placed on the base that
[2:28:04] no matter what you come on home
[2:28:07] and then he asked a question at the end
[2:28:09] they said how can a man do wrong
[2:28:12] being placed on the love like this
[2:28:15] how can you even think about going
[2:28:17] astray at the reason for that is when
[2:28:21] because remember when he prays Abraham
[2:28:23] he prays Abraham on the Covenant that
[2:28:26] it's not what you have done it's what I
[2:28:28] have done for you the reason for that is
[2:28:31] because you need to understand that
[2:28:34] there's not a thing that you can do to
[2:28:36] add to God's love or one thing that you
[2:28:38] can do to take away from his love his
[2:28:40] love is the perfect love his love is
[2:28:43] what bought you his love is what sought
[2:28:45] you his love is what redeemed you this
[2:28:48] love is what will take you to the end
[2:28:53] we're ready says so that in the ages to
[2:28:56] come
[2:28:57] in the ages to come when we are sitting
[2:29:01] around eternity
[2:29:02] and we are talking about our journey on
[2:29:05] Earth we will remember the love that
[2:29:07] carried us through
[2:29:11] my brother my sister if your faith is
[2:29:14] based on that love your lovely will be
[2:29:17] made perfect
[2:29:18] your faith will be made perfect that's
[2:29:21] the faith that we have to operate under
[2:29:23] not to love that not the faith that
[2:29:26] accuses one and call one's this name and
[2:29:29] call that one non-statement and talk
[2:29:31] about this and talk about no but the
[2:29:34] love that's based upon the foundation
[2:29:35] that I was wretched I was miserable I
[2:29:39] was in sin I was lost I am what I am by
[2:29:43] the grace of God and the same Grace that
[2:29:45] extended to me can extend to anybody
[2:29:49] it's not your job to look out there and
[2:29:52] pick and choose who God can save you
[2:29:55] just extend the love God knows who to
[2:29:57] catch
[2:30:02] faith that is motivated by love
[2:30:09] let your face be for your faith be by
[2:30:11] frustration
[2:30:14] don't beat your head against the stone
[2:30:17] come back to the word of God
[2:30:19] to the right foundation
[2:30:22] he taught spirit said who do men say
[2:30:24] that I am
[2:30:26] we said well some says this you are this
[2:30:28] and sometimes say you are Dad that says
[2:30:29] good
[2:30:30] but where do you say that I am
[2:30:33] because it's upon your Revelation not
[2:30:35] somebody else's it's upon your
[2:30:38] Revelation that will build my church it
[2:30:41] says Thou Are the Son of God thou are
[2:30:45] the son of the Living God the Christ the
[2:30:48] son of the Living God it says flesh and
[2:30:51] blood is not giving it to you flesh and
[2:30:53] blood is not import that to you it's
[2:30:55] what God has imported to you that's what
[2:30:59] God will build upon
[2:31:02] build upon your flesh or your character
[2:31:05] or your good nature or your bad nature
[2:31:07] no build upon what God is given to you
[2:31:10] let's all stand this morning
[2:31:13] foreign

[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:29] that is filled upon
[2:31:32] the love of God
[2:31:34] [Music]
[2:31:38] am talks about
[2:31:40] [Music]
[2:31:46] it says in perfect Faith paragraph 132.
[2:31:50] if you could put it up there it says
[2:31:53] when we were in sin alienated from God
[2:31:57] without God
[2:32:00] in the world and in that mocking mud
[2:32:03] it says as I talked about this morning
[2:32:05] God came to us
[2:32:08] God taught us you never sought God
[2:32:11] no man can come to me except my father
[2:32:13] draws him first God came down in the
[2:32:16] mark
[2:32:17] it says what you were and sought you out
[2:32:21] and brought you out it says Thou Art to
[2:32:26] create perfect love
[2:32:28] that basis has to create perfect love
[2:32:31] look at what you was look at what you
[2:32:34] are what did that somebody that loved
[2:32:39] you
[2:32:42] it says can't you have faith in what is
[2:32:46] promised to you
[2:32:47] then the real genuine love will create
[2:32:51] confidence in his word
[2:32:56] look at what you was and what you are
[2:32:59] what what made the change
[2:33:02] it's love
[2:33:03] by his love to bring you here
[2:33:06] so we need to have confidence that that
[2:33:08] same love will come and it will take us
[2:33:10] to where we need to be it's always by
[2:33:13] love let's just buy our heads our
[2:33:15] gracious father we're so thankful Lord
[2:33:17] this morning
[2:33:18] [Music]
[2:33:20] thank you
[2:33:22] Lord it seems like
[2:33:25] even when we think we've amounted to
[2:33:28] something and we are reminded Lord that
[2:33:33] It's Always by your grace and your mercy
[2:33:35] Lord and
[2:33:37] your word is so good at humbling us and
[2:33:39] just bringing us right back lord
[2:33:42] so we could be grounded in the fact that
[2:33:45] it's always about you not about us
[2:33:47] [Music]
[2:33:50] it's always about your goodness and
[2:33:53] and what you have done for us we pray oh
[2:33:55] God that you forgive our shortcomings oh
[2:33:58] God and if there is anyone in our midst
[2:34:00] that's not saved Lord
[2:34:02] father can you just come by our way that
[2:34:04] they they can feel your love this
[2:34:06] morning and father if they have any
[2:34:08] questions that you come and you answer
[2:34:10] those questions Lord
[2:34:12] but father asked that have started Lord
[2:34:15] and as Paul will say that we begin in
[2:34:17] love and then we'll change out to
[2:34:19] something else and father that we begin
[2:34:21] in faith that the whole part of the way
[2:34:23] we have to continue in faith and love
[2:34:25] and knowing that he who started the work
[2:34:28] will finish it forgive us our
[2:34:30] shortcomings if we somehow behave puffed
[2:34:33] up and father said things that's not
[2:34:36] pleasing to you we ask that you forgive
[2:34:37] us Lord and bring us to that place where
[2:34:40] father where we'll always operate by the
[2:34:42] love that you place within our hearts
[2:34:44] lead us on the way of everlasting Lord
[2:34:46] and we love you and we commit everything
[2:34:49] in acid in the name of Jesus Christ amen

[2:37:34] what a message this morning
[2:37:38] I was just thinking that's by the Billy
[2:37:40] was preaching
