[13:59] visitors we're certainly happy to have
[14:00] you with us
[14:03] God bless you but have your seats as we
[14:05] invite brother Mike for us so I'm
[14:06] reading this month
[14:26] thank you
[14:28] good morning
[14:31] I uh I'm always impressed every year
[14:33] when people embark on reading through
[14:35] the Bible in a year
[14:38] I've never been very good at that I
[14:39] usually make it a
[14:41] chapter or two and next thing you know
[14:43] I'm going down this way and going down
[14:44] the next way I don't know how anybody is
[14:46] able to read through the Bible in a year
[14:49] I guess I read all over the Bible every
[14:51] year
[14:53] it's the same thing happened to me as I
[14:55] was kind of going through Psalm 5 we're
[14:57] going to read that this morning and
[14:59] you know it's a beautiful prayer really
[15:02] of David
[15:04] but what what caught my attention as we
[15:06] read that this morning is what David was
[15:08] asking for
[15:10] in his prayer
[15:12] you know we go before the Lord we have
[15:15] things we lay before him in prayer and
[15:18] asking for certain things asking for
[15:20] guidance asking for leadership but
[15:22] what's interesting in Psalm 5 is what he
[15:26] was asking for and it starts out give
[15:28] ear to my words O Lord
[15:31] consider my meditation
[15:35] hearken unto the voice of my cry my king
[15:39] and my God
[15:41] what he's asking for is that his words
[15:44] that has meditation
[15:47] that the voice of his cry
[15:49] would be something that he could hear
[15:53] you know I got to thinking about that
[15:56] give ear to my words
[15:59] consider my meditation
[16:02] hearken unto the voice of My Cry
[16:07] so he said it this way in Psalm 19 14 he
[16:12] said let the words of my mouth
[16:15] and the meditation of my heart
[16:18] be acceptable in thy sight
[16:21] O Lord
[16:24] you know I began to wonder
[16:26] what are my words
[16:29] what is my meditation
[16:33] what is the voice of My Cry
[16:37] and is it something he can hear
[16:41] is it something that's acceptable
[16:44] that he can receive
[16:48] you know there's a certain sound that
[16:50] he's looking for
[16:53] he only hears what he's listening for
[16:57] an acceptable sound
[17:03] you know James said in
[17:06] 4 verse 3.
[17:10] he said you ask
[17:12] and receive not because ye ask a miss
[17:16] that you may consume it
[17:19] upon your lusts
[17:21] there are many examples in scripture of
[17:24] the Lord not hearing
[17:26] of the Lord not inclining his ear
[17:29] of the Lord not hearkening
[17:32] or that the meditation of the heart was
[17:35] unacceptable
[17:38] but there is an acceptable voice an
[17:42] acceptable meditation
[17:44] something he can hear
[17:46] something he can consider you know
[17:49] David's prayer was that his words might
[17:52] be something that he can hear
[17:54] that his meditation might be something
[17:56] he could consider
[17:58] you know one of the things that we've
[18:00] read before in the scriptures several
[18:02] times as we've gone through this is that
[18:04] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[18:08] in other words his heart
[18:11] his desire
[18:13] his passion
[18:15] was the same as God's
[18:18] they had the same
[18:20] heart the same desire
[18:23] the same passion
[18:27] you know and when I read a scripture
[18:29] where David is asking that his words
[18:32] might be something he can hear
[18:35] or that his meditation might be
[18:37] something that he can consider
[18:40] or that the voice of his cry might be
[18:42] something he can hearken to the question
[18:44] is is his desire of his heart match that
[18:48] of the Lord
[18:52] something he can hear and receive
[18:55] just kind of going through that and
[18:58] you know what's our meditation we read
[19:00] in Psalm 119 a few weeks ago verse 97 oh
[19:04] how I love thy law
[19:07] it is my meditation all the day
[19:11] the word
[19:13] being his meditation the man who was
[19:16] after God's Own Heart
[19:20] you know is our meditation is my
[19:22] meditation on my need
[19:24] on my burden
[19:27] on my frustration or is it on his word
[19:32] you know whenever we have worry or fear
[19:34] or doubt it's an example it's a it's
[19:37] this clue that we might be meditating on
[19:40] the wrong thing
[19:44] you know instead of meditating on what
[19:46] he said we meditate on what might happen
[19:51] you know we pray all the time lord If It
[19:53] Be Your Will
[19:55] do this
[19:56] or if it Be Your Will
[19:58] do that
[20:01] but you know how many times do we stand
[20:03] on what we know to be his desire
[20:06] and declare it
[20:08] that our heart matches his heart
[20:13] you know it's not about us convincing
[20:15] him to share our desire
[20:18] it's about us about our desire matching
[20:21] his
[20:24] what words could we say that are
[20:26] acceptable
[20:29] something he can hear outside of his own
[20:31] word
[20:32] because his desire is his word
[20:39] you know in James 4 when we read that ye
[20:41] ask and receive not because he asked
[20:43] amiss that you may consume it upon your
[20:45] lust it's an example of not having his
[20:48] desire but our own
[20:51] or our desire
[20:54] isn't a match and as we read Psalm 5
[20:57] we're going to see David listing some
[20:58] examples
[21:00] of things he can't receive
[21:06] well he does consider his word
[21:09] in Matthew 21 21 Jesus said this verily
[21:13] I say unto you
[21:15] if ye have faith
[21:18] and doubt not
[21:20] ye shall not only do this which is done
[21:22] to the Fig Tree but also if he shall say
[21:25] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[21:27] be thou cast into the sea it shall be
[21:29] done
[21:31] all things whatsoever ye shall ask in
[21:34] prayer believing ye shall receive
[21:38] and what's the basis of our faith of
[21:41] Faith his word
[21:46] you know the flip side John 5 19 the son
[21:49] can do nothing
[21:51] of himself
[21:53] but what he sees the father do
[21:58] for whatsoever things he doeth these
[22:00] also the son likewise verse 30 I seek
[22:03] not mine own will not my own desire
[22:06] but the will of the Father which hath
[22:09] sent me or in other words it's thus
[22:11] saith the Lord or keep still
[22:14] what is the words
[22:16] what is the meditation what is the voice
[22:19] of our cry
[22:21] does it match his desire is it his word
[22:28] you know it got to such a place with
[22:31] Jesus
[22:32] that when Peter
[22:34] said you know Lord If It Be Your Will
[22:37] let's build this great work let's do
[22:40] this great religious thing
[22:44] but when the Lord spoke in Matthew 17 5
[22:46] he said this this is my beloved Son in
[22:50] whom I am well pleased hear ye him
[22:55] you know and I got to thinking about
[22:57] that there's such a place where one can
[22:59] get to
[23:00] where they're so connected with the
[23:02] heart of God and what the Lord wants
[23:05] done with his word
[23:07] that instead of us asking that he would
[23:10] hear our words
[23:12] he would be able to say hear your word
[23:15] because it matches his
[23:18] you know and I thought as I started
[23:19] reading that you know Lord I pray that I
[23:22] could get to such a place
[23:25] that the things that I say could be in
[23:27] such alignment with your heart
[23:31] that you could say hear him
[23:34] this is my beloved Son what he says what
[23:37] he asks for what his meditation is
[23:39] matches mine
[23:41] you know that was the prayer that I had
[23:43] as we pray like David did Lord may my
[23:46] words be something you can hear
[23:49] may my meditation be something you can
[23:51] consider
[23:55] you know I just we can go ahead and
[23:56] stand as we start to read Psalm
[23:59] 5. isn't that even what the ministry of
[24:04] Malachi 4 was sent to do
[24:07] to restore the hearts
[24:09] of children to the fathers
[24:12] to make the hearts match that our
[24:14] desires would be the same as his
[24:17] you know my prayer would be that Lord
[24:19] with my words would my meditation would
[24:23] My Cry match your desire so much
[24:27] that you can say this is my son hear him
[24:31] it matches my heart
[24:34] let's just read that together Psalm 5
[24:36] just a shorter Psalm this morning
[24:39] give ear to my words O Lord consider my
[24:43] meditation hearken unto the voice of my
[24:46] cry my king and my God for unto thee
[24:50] will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in
[24:53] the morning O Lord in the morning will I
[24:55] direct my prayer unto thee and will look
[24:58] up for thou art not a God that hath
[25:00] pleasure and wickedness neither shall
[25:03] evil dwell with thee the foolish shall
[25:06] not stand in thy sight thou hatest all
[25:08] workers of iniquity Thou shalt destroy
[25:11] them that speak leasing the Lord will
[25:13] abhor the bloody and deceitful man but
[25:16] as for me I will come into thy house in
[25:19] the multitude of thy mercy and in thy
[25:22] fear will I worship toward thy Holy
[25:24] Temple Lead Me O Lord and thy
[25:26] righteousness because of mine enemies
[25:28] make thy way straight before my face for
[25:32] there is no faithfulness in their mouth
[25:33] their inward part is very wickedness
[25:36] their throat is an open Sepulcher they
[25:39] flatter with their tongue destroy thou
[25:42] them o God let them fall By Their Own
[25:44] counsels cast them out in the multitude
[25:47] of their transgressions for they have
[25:49] rebelled against thee but let all those
[25:51] that put their trust in thee Rejoice let
[25:54] them ever shout for Joy because thou
[25:56] defendest them let them also that love
[25:59] thy name be joyful indeed for thou Lord
[26:02] will bless the righteous with favor wilt
[26:05] thou Compass him as with the shield amen

[43:19] he's the same God everywhere
[43:22] he doesn't change
[43:24] it's the same Spirit as the same body
[43:27] it's the same word and he's here this
[43:31] morning
[43:32] not because we have a feeling because
[43:35] his word
[43:37] will never pass away
[43:39] his word is always Eternal and if we
[43:43] have faith in him this morning all
[43:46] things are possible let's just bow our
[43:48] heads
[43:50] Lord we're here this morning
[43:54] Lord you've been faithful to us Lord
[43:59] we can reflect back in our life and see
[44:02] your hand Upon Our Lives
[44:04] and how you lead us and how you guide us
[44:06] and how you protect us and how you
[44:08] provide for us Lord
[44:10] Lord and we're gathered in a building
[44:12] like this Lord
[44:16] Lord this is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:19] she's spotless she's without wrinkle
[44:22] hard
[44:23] your word is perfecting our lord Jesus
[44:27] so this morning Lord we all unite our
[44:30] hearts together
[44:31] with the faith that never passes away of
[44:34] Faith that's Eternal in your word Lord
[44:36] and we bring the needs before you this
[44:38] morning
[44:39] Lord you know every need that was read
[44:42] this morning here before this pulpit
[44:45] I may not remember every one of them
[44:46] Lord but you've known it from before the
[44:48] foundation of the world he also provided
[44:51] a word from the foundation of the world
[44:53] Lord to provide healing to provide
[44:56] Deliverance to provide protection Lord
[44:59] so Lord we apply that blood this morning
[45:02] Lord it was that blood that was shed on
[45:04] Calvary Lord
[45:05] it was by the stripes Lord Lord you took
[45:10] him from me Lord you took him for every
[45:13] situation in this church this morning
[45:16] Lord let us believe your word for what
[45:18] it says let us just simply just believe
[45:21] what you're doing for us Lord
[45:23] and apply it this morning knowing that
[45:26] you remain the same
[45:27] you've always unfolded yourself lower to
[45:30] your elect and so Lord this morning Lord
[45:32] we cry out to you Norman that is the
[45:35] same word it's the same spirit
[45:37] Lord that you would be able to just even
[45:39] speak to us this morning Lord that you
[45:41] would use our pastor Lord that you would
[45:43] be able to just move them aside Lord and
[45:45] just freely speak before your people
[45:47] Lord Lord we know you're here Lord maybe
[45:50] our mind might be just being lying to us
[45:52] saying this is just a church service
[45:54] this is just something We Gather this is
[45:56] just where we see our friends but no
[45:59] Lord you're here this morning because
[46:01] where your word is you're truly in your
[46:03] midst Lord Lord and if you're if there's
[46:06] two or three hearts that believe that
[46:08] this morning you're present and you
[46:10] could do all things for us Lord Lord we
[46:12] commit the service into your hands Lord
[46:14] we also commit the tithes and the
[46:16] offerings that they would further your
[46:17] kingdom Lord that they would be able to
[46:19] just provide for the needy Lord Lord I

[46:23] song service Lord that you bless our

[59:57] second important announcement to

[1:00:02] this is a building
[1:00:08] so
[1:00:14] after the three and a half years
[1:00:18] fighting the city of
[1:00:24] Bedford we have our we have our building
[1:00:29] permit and we'll be starting
[1:00:30] construction very soon again parents are
[1:00:34] going to have to be very uh watchful of
[1:00:36] your children
[1:00:38] um also this month we're going to start
[1:00:42] installing the landscaping and the
[1:00:45] sprinkler system and we're going to have
[1:00:49] to wait till the very end of March to
[1:00:52] put in the grass but Lord willing by the
[1:00:56] first of April will be able to have the
[1:00:59] kids go out and play on the grass out
[1:01:01] there and we'll start be able to move
[1:01:03] them out of the parking lot and
[1:01:07] we will start construction and and we
[1:01:11] just need to keep them out of
[1:01:14] those areas so with your help we're
[1:01:18] going to do it I am not going to sing a
[1:01:20] special and and I don't know what you
[1:01:23] sing for an engagement
[1:01:26] that you know but anyway we appreciate
[1:01:30] our musicians and everybody for playing
[1:01:32] for us we
[1:01:35] I'm excited about the word this morning
[1:01:38] the only thing I'm not excited about is
[1:01:41] my inability to bring it
[1:01:44] the way that it needs to be brought but
[1:01:48] with your help
[1:01:50] you you understand you've got to read
[1:01:53] between the lines you've got to pull it
[1:01:56] out you've got to fill in the blanks and
[1:01:59] I I trust if we could do that this
[1:02:02] morning it would be a blessing to us
[1:02:09] we have been
[1:02:11] studying the God of this evil age
[1:02:16] and the purpose in our heart of studying
[1:02:21] that is so that we could recognize him
[1:02:26] recognize what it is that he's trying to
[1:02:30] accomplish what it is that he's doing
[1:02:33] and how that he's doing it
[1:02:37] we realized he was doing it through
[1:02:39] science
[1:02:42] education and civilization
[1:02:46] and he wanted to be worshiped
[1:02:50] the way that God was worshiped
[1:02:53] in fact he wanted to exalt themselves
[1:02:56] above the stars and the angels of God
[1:03:01] he wanted to exalt himself above the
[1:03:03] message that God would bring down
[1:03:06] Through the Ages he wanted to set up on
[1:03:09] the throne
[1:03:10] of God and be worshiped as God
[1:03:14] and in our study of that we wanted to
[1:03:18] come to the understanding that millions
[1:03:22] and billions of people are worshiping
[1:03:25] him and don't know it
[1:03:28] we saw that he's also very religious
[1:03:33] and he appears as an angel of Light
[1:03:37] and our
[1:03:40] wisdom as children babes cannot discern
[1:03:46] between good and evil and right and
[1:03:50] wrong that's why you have to go to
[1:03:53] Little Johnny and go no no no no no
[1:03:55] don't do this don't do that you're
[1:03:58] trying to teach them what's right and
[1:04:00] wrong you're trying to teach them the
[1:04:03] discipline of following which is right
[1:04:07] the discipline as us as Believers as
[1:04:11] staying with the word
[1:04:13] and so we we saw those things and we
[1:04:16] looked at those things because if we
[1:04:19] realized we're going to have to identify
[1:04:22] him
[1:04:24] because we understand that there's two
[1:04:28] things that make the church strong and
[1:04:31] an invincible Army that's one when they
[1:04:35] recognize the enemy in every single one
[1:04:39] of his tricks
[1:04:41] amen and
[1:04:44] withstand him
[1:04:47] and then when you can withstand them you
[1:04:50] can see them you can know what he is
[1:04:52] even though he appears as an angel we
[1:04:56] know Martin the great uh a messenger and
[1:05:00] and Saint
[1:05:02] Satan appeared to him
[1:05:04] act and said Martin it's me the Lord
[1:05:07] Jesus
[1:05:09] and he said Fall Down and Worship me and
[1:05:12] Martin stood back and uh uh and it was a
[1:05:17] religious feeling no doubt and there was
[1:05:20] an anointing no doubt but he noticed one
[1:05:24] thing he noticed that he was wearing a
[1:05:28] crown
[1:05:29] and that identified him because he was
[1:05:32] trying to exalt himself as king above
[1:05:35] the Stars
[1:05:36] and so he said wait a minute that's not
[1:05:39] what the word of God said the word of
[1:05:41] God said we would crown him
[1:05:45] so if he recognized them and he said get
[1:05:48] behind me you deceiver you know what I
[1:05:51] mean okay and so I would like to think
[1:05:54] and I'd like to wish in my heart that
[1:05:57] every single one of you would be free
[1:06:00] from Satan trying to influence you but I
[1:06:05] can't say that because the word of God
[1:06:08] says that Satan is like a roaring lion
[1:06:11] going about seeking whom he may devour I
[1:06:15] would like to be there with you to fight
[1:06:18] every single battle
[1:06:20] for you but I cannot crawl inside of
[1:06:24] your mind
[1:06:27] and that's where your battle is
[1:06:30] right so you have to fight the battle
[1:06:32] you have to do the war but I know one
[1:06:36] thing
[1:06:37] the one thing is is that we have access
[1:06:40] to the best weapon there is and that's
[1:06:44] God's word that's what he gave us to
[1:06:47] fight our battle with is his word God's
[1:06:51] word is what prevails I I cannot solve
[1:06:59] all the problems
[1:07:02] I would love to come up with solution
[1:07:04] for every marriage problem for every
[1:07:07] personal problem for every demon there
[1:07:11] is I'd like to be able to sit down and
[1:07:14] do those things but God didn't provide
[1:07:17] me to be the way to do that he provided
[1:07:21] his word
[1:07:22] at Faith in his word is the victory
[1:07:29] I've had people I I couldn't even save
[1:07:34] my own children
[1:07:37] I would have if I could
[1:07:41] I I would have loved to have been able
[1:07:43] to to do something that would cause them
[1:07:48] to be saved but I did have a promise
[1:07:52] and the promise was if I waited raised
[1:07:55] them up in the way that they should go
[1:07:57] that they had returned to it
[1:08:00] and I just can only leave that into
[1:08:02] God's hands look this morning we have to
[1:08:06] understand that we are in a world that's
[1:08:11] changing
[1:08:13] it's changing rapidly and it's not
[1:08:17] changing for our betterment and there's
[1:08:20] going to come a time when we that we
[1:08:23] will not be subject to it
[1:08:28] they may turn this into a big storehouse
[1:08:33] we have been warned that that's a
[1:08:35] possibility
[1:08:36] they make they may try to keep us from
[1:08:39] preaching the gospel that we preach
[1:08:42] because it's not sociably acceptable to
[1:08:46] to what Satan's Eden is
[1:08:50] and the the true word of God does not
[1:08:53] worship Satan
[1:08:55] what worship Satan is a lie because he's
[1:08:59] the father of lies and there's no truth
[1:09:02] in him so when someone preaches the
[1:09:05] false gospel they are telling a lie oh
[1:09:09] Satan loves that he worships that
[1:09:12] is wonderful he loves the lie but the
[1:09:15] truth
[1:09:17] is the only thing that sets you free is
[1:09:21] the truth okay and and you say well what
[1:09:25] are we being set free from we're being
[1:09:27] set free from idolatry by worshiping a
[1:09:33] false god and by worshiping Satan
[1:09:35] because the very first commandment is I
[1:09:38] am the Lord thy God Thou shalt not have
[1:09:41] any Gods above me
[1:09:44] he has got to be absolutely the number
[1:09:48] one thing in our lives he doesn't share
[1:09:51] his glory he doesn't share his position
[1:09:53] he doesn't share his truth
[1:09:58] he's sovereign
[1:10:00] he's the creator of Heaven and Earth he
[1:10:04] is he's the all in all the I am and
[1:10:07] everything will return back to him and
[1:10:10] anything that's not a part of him will
[1:10:13] not remain
[1:10:15] so Satan knows his time short
[1:10:19] so he's trying to manifest all his glory
[1:10:23] as quick as he can I like what the
[1:10:26] prophet of God said people are buying
[1:10:29] tickets to be able to travel in space
[1:10:33] and and spend money to go up and maybe
[1:10:36] go to the moon the prophet of God said I
[1:10:38] want to go so far past the moon hey I
[1:10:41] want to go so far beyond that don't you
[1:10:43] want to go in back to Eternity from
[1:10:46] where you came
[1:10:48] so with that understanding this morning
[1:10:51] we spent a few weeks reading I hope you
[1:10:54] went through the book yourselves as we
[1:10:57] read it we found out that the word of
[1:10:59] God has identified
[1:11:02] the God of this evil age
[1:11:05] and he also preached a parallel sermon
[1:11:08] called Satan's Eden
[1:11:11] where this world is under a complete
[1:11:15] different set of laws because of sin
[1:11:21] the law of sin and death the world
[1:11:24] Reigns but now we we're looking for
[1:11:28] something
[1:11:30] greater
[1:11:32] is if we can identify the God of this
[1:11:35] evil age we also want to identify the
[1:11:39] true God of the True Believer
[1:11:44] we want to be able to identify him
[1:11:47] we want to be able to know him
[1:11:50] so in doing so this morning we are going
[1:11:53] to go down that path
[1:11:56] and I was this sermon and message came
[1:11:59] to me in my heart the other day uh from
[1:12:04] the brother's breakfast and I encourage
[1:12:06] you Brethren when when we have the
[1:12:08] breakfasts to come out and if we won't
[1:12:11] fit in that back room we'll move these
[1:12:13] pews and chairs and we'll set up in here
[1:12:16] or eventually we'll find a place
[1:12:19] but come out but I was so moved the
[1:12:21] other day at the breakfast and I was
[1:12:24] particularly moved by a brother Tim
[1:12:29] Seiler what he expressed to the brothers
[1:12:32] and I I saw it sitting there in the word
[1:12:35] and it it it touched my heart and what
[1:12:38] the brother said and so I this morning
[1:12:41] we're going to play 12 minutes
[1:12:46] of the message
[1:12:49] and I thought this was such a beautiful
[1:12:52] title title the message messenger gave
[1:12:54] it Christ is identified the same in all
[1:12:59] ages
[1:13:02] so he's identified the same in all ages
[1:13:06] so it's important that we understand
[1:13:11] how that he is going to identify himself
[1:13:15] and what is the biggest issue today you
[1:13:20] hear about
[1:13:22] identity theft
[1:13:28] the world cannot help but testify
[1:13:31] to the gospel
[1:13:33] what we have going on today is spiritual
[1:13:37] identity theft
[1:13:39] trying to steal the identity of the True
[1:13:43] Believer and to try to give them a false
[1:13:47] identification but we want to find out
[1:13:50] by the word of God what the true
[1:13:53] identification of God is and what the
[1:13:58] believer identifies so if you're part of
[1:14:01] him then what he is
[1:14:04] you are so you have to have the same
[1:14:08] identity in God's word
[1:14:12] old man's come up with all kinds of the
[1:14:14] different identities
[1:14:17] and anointings
[1:14:20] signs everything but remember God is
[1:14:24] identified by who he is and what he is
[1:14:28] and he is the word so in our in our uh
[1:14:34] lesson this morning
[1:14:36] we'll let the the scriptures that are
[1:14:39] being read be the scriptures that
[1:14:43] that we read so let us stand together
[1:14:47] now brother Mike if they've given you
[1:14:50] that
[1:14:51] and
[1:14:52] we're going to turn to paragraph 46.
[1:14:56] in the message Christ is identified the
[1:15:00] same in all generations 4 15 64.
[1:15:06] 4 15 64.
[1:15:09] and I know some of you might have
[1:15:10] devices
[1:15:13] I don't like that word device
[1:15:16] I think d means the
[1:15:20] so it's the vice
[1:15:22] but anyway if you have those
[1:15:26] um you're welcome to turn to it to read
[1:15:28] along we'll have it on the board to read
[1:15:31] along if you have the message in Spanish
[1:15:33] I don't know if the paragraph
[1:15:37] parallel closely but you can look it in
[1:15:40] Spanish or French or whatever language
[1:15:42] you have
[1:15:44] and uh follow along till when we stop so
[1:15:48] we're going to listen to this and I want
[1:15:51] to
[1:15:52] read the very first thing now listen
[1:15:55] closely
[1:15:57] as we read this precious word
[1:16:01] listen closely let's listen closely this
[1:16:06] morning just for a little bit and see if
[1:16:10] we can
[1:16:11] find something in these next 12 minutes
[1:16:15] that really can mean something to us I
[1:16:20] believe it's there
[1:16:21] don't you you get what you're looking
[1:16:24] for amen look to God's word it'll feed
[1:16:27] you this morning thank you brother Mike
[1:16:29] go ahead please
[1:16:37] Hebrews 1 and then Hebrews 13 and we
[1:16:40] give it the fifth verse and read the
[1:16:42] eighth inclusive
[1:16:44] God who is sundry times and divers
[1:16:47] manners speak in times past and to the
[1:16:50] fathers by the prophets
[1:16:52] has in these last days spoken to us by
[1:16:56] his son whom he has appointed heir of
[1:16:59] all things by whom also he made the
[1:17:02] world
[1:17:03] who being in the brightness of his glory
[1:17:06] in the end expressed image of his person
[1:17:09] and upholding All Things by the word of
[1:17:12] his promise
[1:17:14] when he had by himself purged our sins
[1:17:18] set down on the right hand of the
[1:17:21] Majesty on high
[1:17:23] now Hebrews 13 5.
[1:17:26] let your conversations be without
[1:17:28] covetousness
[1:17:30] and be content with such things as you
[1:17:33] have for he has said I will never leave
[1:17:37] thee nor forsake thee so that we may
[1:17:39] fully say the Lord is my helper and I
[1:17:42] will not fear what man shall do and
[1:17:46] remember them which have rule over you
[1:17:48] who has spoken unto you the word of God
[1:17:51] whose Faith followeth considering the
[1:17:54] end of their conversations Jesus Christ
[1:17:57] the same yesterday today and forever let
[1:18:02] us bow our heads for prayer
[1:18:05] while we have our heads bowed and our
[1:18:07] hearts also
[1:18:09] is there a request and you would like to
[1:18:11] be remembered that you would like to say
[1:18:13] it so much to God while this meeting is
[1:18:15] going on God I have a great need
[1:18:17] Remember Me Lord
[1:18:21] remember me I'm here for a need Lord
[1:18:24] our heavenly father we are approaching
[1:18:27] thee and that all-sufficient name of the
[1:18:30] Lord Jesus knowing this that he said if
[1:18:33] you ask the father anything in my name
[1:18:34] it'll be granted
[1:18:36] and we're so happy to know that Lord
[1:18:39] that we had this assurance
[1:18:42] that when we asked anything in his name
[1:18:45] has been heard of God and we pray father
[1:18:48] tonight my request that both my hands up
[1:18:52] I I ask you heavenly father to answer
[1:18:56] each one of these requests there's no
[1:18:58] doubt there's people there that their
[1:19:00] loved ones are unsaved and they have
[1:19:03] sickness and
[1:19:04] and maybe domestic troubles financial
[1:19:07] troubles and all gods the old world is
[1:19:10] certainly
[1:19:12] sick all over and we were looking for
[1:19:15] your coming Lord where I'll be a great A
[1:19:18] Thousand Years Millennium and we're
[1:19:20] we're the righteous Will Rule and reign
[1:19:23] with Christ we're looking for that hour
[1:19:26] we're trying to live like that that this
[1:19:29] is the time that we're seeing the last
[1:19:31] generation upon the Earth and we're
[1:19:33] waiting for his coming
[1:19:35] we pray father that you'll save every
[1:19:37] soul that's savable in this country
[1:19:39] while this meeting's going on granted
[1:19:42] father then when the meeting's over if
[1:19:44] we miss him May there come a Revival
[1:19:46] throughout all the churches and hurry
[1:19:49] and Lord come we see the earthquakes
[1:19:52] again of breaking up the Earth and
[1:19:55] diverse places and man's heart failing
[1:19:58] fear perplexing and distressed and
[1:20:01] Nations and we're just at the end time
[1:20:04] we think of the Great Earthquake the
[1:20:06] other day and never was one like it only
[1:20:09] 1900 years ago on another good Friday
[1:20:12] when Jesus had been rejected by the
[1:20:15] world
[1:20:16] the Earth shook all over
[1:20:18] God
[1:20:20] is rejected again
[1:20:22] the Earthship the other day in hills and
[1:20:25] mountains fell in cities collapsed and
[1:20:28] water dashed in the air and the whole
[1:20:31] world
[1:20:32] what would it be when you return Lord no
[1:20:36] wonder they cry to the rocks in the
[1:20:38] mountains let us be ready for that great
[1:20:40] going home time father
[1:20:42] Grant every request for we ask that in
[1:20:45] Jesus name amen
[1:20:47] and to be seated
[1:20:52] especially I want you to listen
[1:20:55] hear the time in
[1:20:57] and be just as reverent as possible
[1:21:01] especially while we're speaking because
[1:21:03] if you don't get the words what we have
[1:21:04] to place in each night then you come to
[1:21:07] the platform not knowing what you're
[1:21:09] coming for
[1:21:10] you must understand you must come with
[1:21:12] an understanding and that's what Christ
[1:21:15] wants us to come and if you have to have
[1:21:17] faith in what you're doing and if you
[1:21:19] don't you're just going time in a
[1:21:21] haphazard I hope so
[1:21:23] it'll never happen
[1:21:25] it can happen see you can't have faith
[1:21:27] if you're going like that you must
[1:21:29] thoroughly know what you're doing and
[1:21:31] know what's going to happen yes then
[1:21:33] then you you're positive then that it's
[1:21:36] going to happen now remember don't
[1:21:39] forget our theme is and our text that
[1:21:42] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:21:44] and forever now
[1:21:47] my text subject for tonight is Christ is
[1:21:51] identified the same in all generations
[1:21:55] now the Bible said he sustained
[1:21:57] yesterday today and forever and we want
[1:21:59] to know how he could be I would
[1:22:03] recognize him
[1:22:04] if he's here just as he was any other
[1:22:06] time and we'd like to know how he is
[1:22:09] recognized Among Us
[1:22:11] because so many people have so many
[1:22:13] different ideas about him
[1:22:15] see each one as an individual try to
[1:22:18] draw up our idea about Christ what he
[1:22:21] was what he looks like and and how the
[1:22:24] psychologist has painted the picture
[1:22:26] like Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 and
[1:22:30] and salmon and different ones but see we
[1:22:32] don't really look like that so we can
[1:22:34] never understand or what do you look
[1:22:37] like
[1:22:38] and uh by just a painting of some
[1:22:40] pictures therefore somebody would come
[1:22:42] on the platform or among us and have
[1:22:45] scars in his hands and nail prints and
[1:22:48] Thorn Prince on his forehead and
[1:22:50] fleeting I see that that wouldn't be
[1:22:53] Christ because when he comes ever I
[1:22:55] shall see him and every knee shall bow
[1:22:57] and that body Returns the Earth again
[1:22:59] see but what why could he be the same
[1:23:02] yesterday today and forever then he
[1:23:05] would have to learn now what what he is
[1:23:07] a bias uh say maybe the Lutheran people
[1:23:10] here what's your conception of him well
[1:23:12] they'd say we we have him at our church
[1:23:14] or I don't doubt that but he's this and
[1:23:17] then maybe turn over to the Baptist
[1:23:19] people and then they'd have a little
[1:23:20] different idea and I turned to different
[1:23:22] kinds of the Full Gospel people like the
[1:23:25] Assemblies of God the FourSquare the
[1:23:27] Pentecostal United and the the different
[1:23:31] uh branches of it each one might have a
[1:23:34] different idea about it each individual
[1:23:36] in there might differ but we've got to
[1:23:39] have something if we can come to some
[1:23:41] conclusion or we won't know to where
[1:23:43] where we're going I think the thing that
[1:23:45] would settle that would be the word of
[1:23:46] God regardless of our Queen needs in our
[1:23:49] thoughts the word of God are ought to
[1:23:51] settlement so therefore some of them
[1:23:54] claimed that he was a to some people he
[1:23:57] was just simply a great organizer he
[1:23:59] organized a body of 12 Apostles he was a
[1:24:02] great organizer as far as we know he
[1:24:04] ever organized nothing he never did a
[1:24:06] thing like that he was just he was the
[1:24:09] manifestation of God is God in Christ
[1:24:12] reconciling the world to himself he was
[1:24:14] expressing what the father was in
[1:24:16] himself he he said I do always that
[1:24:19] which pleases the father and I and the
[1:24:22] father one the father dwells in me when
[1:24:24] you see me you've seen the father in
[1:24:26] other words Express God the spirit so
[1:24:28] much anyway he and the father it wasn't
[1:24:30] a robbery for him to be the same person
[1:24:31] now we find in your some think he was a
[1:24:35] philosopher he was a philosopher there's
[1:24:37] no doubt about that but he was more than
[1:24:40] a philosopher some of them thought him
[1:24:42] to be a prophet he was a prophet true
[1:24:44] the Bible said he was but he was more
[1:24:47] than a prophet some of them said he was
[1:24:49] a teacher never a man taught like this
[1:24:51] he was a teacher but he was still more
[1:24:52] than a teacher see some of them say he
[1:24:55] was a good man but he was more than a
[1:24:57] good man he was a good man but he was
[1:24:59] more than a good man and when it's all
[1:25:02] summed down he was gone
[1:25:04] so even there was nothing less or
[1:25:06] nothing more it could be nothing more
[1:25:08] forced but he was he was God manifested
[1:25:11] In the Flesh and believed on in the
[1:25:14] world and Seed up in the glory and set
[1:25:15] at the right hand of the father now if
[1:25:17] we find out to get the real expression
[1:25:19] of him we John in the first chapter of
[1:25:23] John he said in the beginning was the
[1:25:26] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:25:29] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:25:33] and dwelt Among Us now in the beginning
[1:25:36] that's where time started when eternity
[1:25:40] broke down into time now after a while
[1:25:42] time comes back into eternity of course
[1:25:44] time is eternity too but time is a lot
[1:25:48] of space and that's the way the only
[1:25:50] thing we know is inches and yards and
[1:25:53] miles and figures and so forth but
[1:25:55] that's nothing to God you don't have no
[1:25:58] time he is always he's eternal and he's
[1:26:01] the only source of eternal life there is
[1:26:03] is in God our Father he's Eternal
[1:26:06] himself now therefore if we have eternal
[1:26:10] life we have part of God in us
[1:26:14] and God in us if he isn't then that's
[1:26:17] the only way you can have eternal life
[1:26:19] it isn't something that was manufactured
[1:26:21] and then given to you by some Creed or
[1:26:23] you lived into it you uh grew into a
[1:26:26] better man or a better woman it's God
[1:26:29] himself in you just like you're part of
[1:26:31] your father you're on Earth you're part
[1:26:33] of your heavenly father
[1:26:34] and what you are you're the attribute of
[1:26:37] his thoughts of you before the
[1:26:39] foundation of the world you're expressed
[1:26:41] he had to breed it in and everything to
[1:26:43] get what you are to make you what you
[1:26:45] are and when we pleaded then this year
[1:26:49] so many people ride life's Road looking
[1:26:52] through a rear view mirror especially I
[1:26:54] don't mean says to hurt Phoenix but many
[1:26:56] of our women there always went past
[1:26:58] about 30 years old they want to go back
[1:27:00] and and be a young girl again and get 50
[1:27:03] they still want the same thing not only
[1:27:04] that but the man too but anybody who
[1:27:07] looks through a rear view mirror is
[1:27:08] going to wreck up somewhere you can't
[1:27:10] drive the road through looking through
[1:27:12] the rear view mirror but I believe watch
[1:27:14] Paul said forgetting those things that
[1:27:16] are in the past I've pressed towards the
[1:27:18] mark of the eye calling in Christ see
[1:27:21] don't look what you were look what
[1:27:23] you're going to be
[1:27:24] I I was remarrying an old couple one
[1:27:28] time they're taking their vows over
[1:27:29] there's 83 and 84 years old a piece
[1:27:32] they'd give them the full down and I I
[1:27:35] felt crazy just a young fellow as I was
[1:27:37] then trying to my old man had been
[1:27:39] married about 60 years him and his wife
[1:27:41] and just taking the bow and they were
[1:27:43] just as much in love as they ever was
[1:27:45] and he had a long beard and I said to
[1:27:47] him I said to her I said what do you
[1:27:49] think about it well I asked him first I
[1:27:51] said what do you think about why your
[1:27:53] wire long beard he said I think an old
[1:27:55] man my age should have a wrong beard I
[1:27:57] said to her what do you think about it
[1:27:59] and she said well she said anything John
[1:28:01] does it just fine so and um and I said
[1:28:04] well it's quite a difference he sent you
[1:28:06] a murderer said you know the Lord's been
[1:28:08] good so Jesus as pretty as she ever was
[1:28:11] said you know as she gets older my sight
[1:28:14] gets dimmer so that was that was really
[1:28:18] sweet I hope my wife thinks the same
[1:28:20] thing and I feel we all feel that way
[1:28:21] about it so but then they found lies
[1:28:25] they found how to live it you see there
[1:28:27] it is what we say we'd all like to go
[1:28:29] back
[1:28:34] I don't know if you realize how much was
[1:28:36] in there
[1:28:37] well let's just look a little bit this
[1:28:41] morning and uh and see uh if we can
[1:28:46] glean from these great words that were
[1:28:52] spoken to us
[1:28:54] and and
[1:28:55] find our ourselves
[1:28:59] this morning
[1:29:00] and he told us to listen closely
[1:29:03] and be reverent
[1:29:06] as possible
[1:29:08] and I think that's important in any time
[1:29:12] you want to hear from God
[1:29:14] that you've got to listen close
[1:29:18] you got to hear them
[1:29:19] and you've got to be reverent
[1:29:22] and and look past uh the the carnal
[1:29:27] things around us that are here uh to
[1:29:32] distract us and really in our hearts
[1:29:35] seek out to the word of God and and I
[1:29:40] believe that and I believe this with all
[1:29:42] my heart and I know I've shared it with
[1:29:44] you but for you to better understand me
[1:29:48] I believe that a prophets made a profit
[1:29:52] that that there's no way for a man to
[1:29:57] groom himself to be a prophet
[1:30:01] because there's uh no fact like he said
[1:30:04] eternal life we just read it is not
[1:30:07] something that you can grow into or
[1:30:10] something you can achieve by being a
[1:30:13] better man or a better person if you had
[1:30:16] eternal life you've always had
[1:30:19] eternal life if if you are a part of God
[1:30:23] you have to be a part of God you
[1:30:26] understand that you can't all of a
[1:30:28] sudden become part of God because now
[1:30:31] you've increased what God is
[1:30:34] do you understand so if you have eternal
[1:30:37] life you always had
[1:30:40] eternal life
[1:30:41] he knew whom he was and we we people say
[1:30:45] well I I received eternal life what you
[1:30:50] really got was the Revelation that there
[1:30:53] was eternal life in you
[1:30:55] that you found something that you
[1:30:58] identified with you heard a deep calling
[1:31:01] to a deep but you couldn't call for that
[1:31:04] deep unless there was something in there
[1:31:06] calling for it so the eternal life that
[1:31:09] was in you was calling for
[1:31:11] identification you didn't know it as
[1:31:14] life when you were growing up you knew
[1:31:17] it as conviction
[1:31:18] you knew it as a feeling there was
[1:31:21] something inside you that caused a
[1:31:24] conviction but later on through hearing
[1:31:26] the gospel and the preaching of God's
[1:31:29] word you come to know it was him
[1:31:35] amen you begin to know it was him and
[1:31:39] you began to know him in the flesh you
[1:31:41] knew him by conviction you knew him by
[1:31:43] sin you knew him by that and then as you
[1:31:46] grew you begin to know him as spirit
[1:31:49] Spirit life when you received the
[1:31:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit and and you
[1:31:56] became one with that word so we found
[1:31:59] out it's not something it's something
[1:32:02] that we've always had to have to be a
[1:32:05] part of him so when you understand it
[1:32:08] that way oh I didn't get eternal life in
[1:32:11] other words I didn't have it now I've
[1:32:13] got it well God couldn't do that
[1:32:16] you understand you have to be you'd have
[1:32:20] to have that Eternal if it was eternal
[1:32:23] life it had to be him in him in the
[1:32:27] beginning and therefore that's why we
[1:32:29] understand it to say we if you were a
[1:32:31] part of God you were always part of God
[1:32:34] and those that you all of a sudden
[1:32:36] didn't show up and say here I am God and
[1:32:39] God says oh I'm going to give you part
[1:32:41] of me no you had to be there in the
[1:32:44] beginning you for all he foreknew he did
[1:32:47] predestinate
[1:32:50] and then Justified and glorified and
[1:32:53] sanctified
[1:32:54] so we we we have that principle down
[1:32:57] going forward so what we were talking
[1:33:00] about this morning is how do we
[1:33:04] identify him
[1:33:07] how do we know
[1:33:10] without being deceived
[1:33:13] that he's Among Us
[1:33:16] when you have the God of this evil age
[1:33:19] presenting himself as God
[1:33:22] and he has a church
[1:33:27] he has a bride very religious
[1:33:31] now you know I didn't make that up right
[1:33:34] hey you you heard it
[1:33:37] and and I hope that in your life that if
[1:33:41] you spend a few hours here on Sunday
[1:33:43] that you would learn how to enter into
[1:33:46] the ministry and enter enter into what's
[1:33:49] being said and why the tapes are being
[1:33:52] preached and it's just not some
[1:33:55] obligation
[1:33:57] you know for some part of your religious
[1:34:00] cycle but that you would be able to
[1:34:02] identify God in the midst Among Us by
[1:34:07] his word
[1:34:11] and so let's see how he began to
[1:34:15] approach this
[1:34:17] and I I don't mind if you put up the
[1:34:19] paragraphs as we go this is paragraph uh
[1:34:23] 56
[1:34:26] he said the Bible said he was the same
[1:34:29] yesterday today and forever now that's
[1:34:33] become way too common of a phrase to us
[1:34:39] I think it's something that we ought to
[1:34:41] deeply meditate on and that we all that
[1:34:45] we should think deeply on and I love how
[1:34:47] our messenger approaches it
[1:34:50] he says he says forever and we want to
[1:34:55] know
[1:34:55] how he could be
[1:34:59] that's a question in itself we want to
[1:35:02] know how could he be
[1:35:07] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:12] another is quick when
[1:35:15] a person in the Old Testament
[1:35:18] was moved upon by the spirit of God in
[1:35:22] sun-dried times and by diverse manners
[1:35:25] the spirit of God spoke to our fathers
[1:35:28] how could what God was speaking to them
[1:35:32] and what their experiences be and what
[1:35:36] they said be exactly what Jesus was
[1:35:42] because now he speaks to us through his
[1:35:45] son
[1:35:46] who was the word of God that's a great
[1:35:48] question
[1:35:50] how could he be
[1:35:53] and we find that as he spoke to us here
[1:35:56] we find that in John 1 in the beginning
[1:35:59] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:36:01] and the Word was God it was the same God
[1:36:06] all the way through
[1:36:09] it never changed it wasn't different he
[1:36:13] he wasn't somebody else it wasn't three
[1:36:18] different moves of God it wasn't three
[1:36:20] different persons of God it wasn't a
[1:36:24] trinity God the Father one person God
[1:36:27] the son another person God the holy
[1:36:30] spirit this person and and one day it's
[1:36:33] God one day it's the spirit one day it's
[1:36:35] the word
[1:36:38] you know people do that right today
[1:36:42] they have the Bible
[1:36:45] they have the message
[1:36:47] and they have the spirit
[1:36:51] and when they want the spirit they
[1:36:53] follow the spirit the spirit led me to
[1:36:56] do this I was led to the spirit the
[1:36:59] spirit you know a sister will get
[1:37:01] anointed in the spirit told me to preach
[1:37:04] the spirit told me that this or the
[1:37:06] spirit moved on me and I did this it
[1:37:09] don't line up with the word Paul said if
[1:37:11] you speak in tongues he said let there
[1:37:13] be an interpreter other words remain
[1:37:15] silent in the church
[1:37:18] oh but the spirit moved
[1:37:22] it's the spirit
[1:37:24] the spirit see they got a separate
[1:37:27] person in the spirit
[1:37:30] and then they'll say well brother
[1:37:32] Branham said
[1:37:34] brother Branham said brother bam said
[1:37:36] heck and they'll they'll they'll they'll
[1:37:38] put their own twist on it and it's fine
[1:37:41] and they'll say what brother Bram said
[1:37:42] this is what the Mets he said and not
[1:37:44] regard what the scripture says or not
[1:37:47] record what the spirit says
[1:37:51] and then somebody else will take the
[1:37:53] Bible
[1:37:55] they said well the Bible says they look
[1:37:57] that they don't regard the messenger and
[1:37:59] they don't regard the spirit
[1:38:03] and they cut a built-in Trinity
[1:38:07] hear me
[1:38:12] we got a trinity in this message
[1:38:15] we got Trinity thinking
[1:38:18] Trinity ideas
[1:38:21] but watch how our messenger unfolds it
[1:38:24] to us
[1:38:26] these aren't three different things
[1:38:29] they're exactly the same thing
[1:38:33] every single one of them is completely
[1:38:36] in harmony because it comes from the
[1:38:40] same Source the same voice the same
[1:38:43] eternity there's not one difference
[1:38:45] between one and the other because these
[1:38:47] three are one
[1:38:52] you never understand the Bible you'll
[1:38:55] never understand who you are and you'll
[1:38:57] never know where you're going with
[1:38:59] Trinity thinking
[1:39:02] when you think you can be anointed by
[1:39:06] the spirit to lead you to do something
[1:39:08] contrary to the word of God you are
[1:39:12] deceived
[1:39:15] you're deceived
[1:39:17] if you come up with an idea out of your
[1:39:20] Bible
[1:39:22] that you don't think the messenger
[1:39:24] taught you are deceived
[1:39:28] or if you think you can take your Bible
[1:39:31] improve
[1:39:33] whether
[1:39:34] the message is the word of God or not
[1:39:37] you're fooling yourself
[1:39:40] God's church is built on one thing and
[1:39:44] one thing only and that's divine
[1:39:46] revelation it's God revealing to you
[1:39:49] just showing you that this is the word
[1:39:52] of God this is the word of God and the
[1:39:56] spirit is the word of God and they're
[1:39:58] the same person
[1:40:04] then you can move forward
[1:40:07] he says we've got to understand that
[1:40:10] let's see why he's going to tell us why
[1:40:12] we're going to have to understand he
[1:40:14] says how could it be
[1:40:17] how we would recognize and how we'd
[1:40:21] recognize him
[1:40:25] so how could he be
[1:40:28] and how could we recognize him
[1:40:32] so how are we going to recognize him
[1:40:35] people want to know where he is
[1:40:38] they want to know if he's moving
[1:40:41] he wanted to know if he's amongst us
[1:40:45] that that's what people come to me all
[1:40:48] the time that get someplace where's a
[1:40:50] lot of excitement going on and they they
[1:40:53] come back and they question me
[1:40:55] well I'm here to answer it this morning
[1:41:00] I don't care about their words
[1:41:03] Paul said I didn't come to you with
[1:41:04] enticing words but I came to you with
[1:41:07] the power and the demonstration of the
[1:41:09] Holy Spirit
[1:41:12] every single Joyride that a person goes
[1:41:16] on
[1:41:17] you go on it it scares you you've got
[1:41:19] your spine you know you're on the
[1:41:21] Cliffhanger or the Rocket Ride or
[1:41:24] whatever when you get back on the ground
[1:41:26] and you come to this your senses you're
[1:41:29] right back on the ground right in the
[1:41:31] same condition you were in before you
[1:41:33] took a big ride
[1:41:38] now you might get addicted to that right
[1:41:41] I've seen kids come off that thing and
[1:41:43] run right back around and get on it
[1:41:45] again run right back and get it on there
[1:41:47] I'm looking at it I've got to go down to
[1:41:49] the restroom down over here and hit my
[1:41:51] stomach back in the shape and I'm not
[1:41:54] even on it
[1:41:57] but they got to have that high
[1:42:00] they got to have that up
[1:42:02] let me say something the message you're
[1:42:03] told he says never become so spiritual
[1:42:06] you're of no earthly value
[1:42:10] all right now let's phone because we
[1:42:12] want to identify them we spent two weeks
[1:42:14] three weeks identifying this devil
[1:42:16] around us
[1:42:19] do you understand so my question is if
[1:42:21] we can see the devil how can we see God
[1:42:27] that's what I want to know
[1:42:29] how do I know
[1:42:31] that God is in the midst of this body of
[1:42:36] believers
[1:42:37] not necessarily this building
[1:42:40] but I want to be able to identify
[1:42:44] God in the midst of this body of
[1:42:47] Believers and to be able to say this is
[1:42:50] God God is here God is moving and it's
[1:42:54] him
[1:42:58] now we just heard him say a lot of
[1:43:00] people have an idea a lot of them have
[1:43:02] an identity a lot of people have
[1:43:04] something that they conclude that is he
[1:43:07] said if I would go to a church they
[1:43:08] would say God's in our church
[1:43:13] and he said you could even go down
[1:43:15] through all the different branches
[1:43:17] and there be something
[1:43:20] so this is what he says in this same
[1:43:22] paragraph he goes on to say how do we
[1:43:25] recognize him
[1:43:27] and if he's here
[1:43:31] just the same was in any other time
[1:43:36] so how do we recognize him if he's here
[1:43:39] just the same if he was in every other
[1:43:42] time then like to know how he is
[1:43:46] recognized
[1:43:47] among
[1:43:49] us
[1:43:52] don't do no good if we can recognize him
[1:43:54] down the street
[1:43:58] you know what happens every time
[1:44:01] somebody comes up with a new flavor
[1:44:04] it gets a following
[1:44:09] you know if somebody came up with purple
[1:44:11] pumpkin ice cream there would be a
[1:44:13] purple pumpkin ice cream following
[1:44:18] and people flock to it
[1:44:20] I don't want to flock to this
[1:44:22] I don't want to flock to that
[1:44:25] because my sheep know my voice and
[1:44:28] another they won't follow
[1:44:30] so it's important
[1:44:33] to you
[1:44:34] as an individual
[1:44:36] that you can identify
[1:44:41] him
[1:44:43] amongst
[1:44:45] your fellowship and him in your life
[1:44:50] so this is what he goes on to say he
[1:44:53] said
[1:44:54] he talks about he said you can't know
[1:44:56] him by a painting
[1:44:59] well we have the Huffman's head of
[1:45:01] Christ here because we understood that
[1:45:04] the messenger told us when he saw him in
[1:45:07] the field I believe it was
[1:45:09] he said standing there he said when he
[1:45:12] turned around there was a face like no
[1:45:15] face that I had ever seen
[1:45:19] there was love like no love I've ever
[1:45:23] experienced it was like his eyes were
[1:45:26] they could just look through you
[1:45:31] we don't like that part
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:34] um
[1:45:36] no sir
[1:45:38] we like people looking at the outside
[1:45:40] the Lord looked past my flesh you're not
[1:45:44] going to judge me by my flesh anyway
[1:45:46] look into my heart
[1:45:48] you know you take the Heart of Stone and
[1:45:52] put in a heart of Flesh Change My Heart
[1:45:55] Lord change my thinking
[1:45:57] so we we find out he said you can't know
[1:46:00] him by that
[1:46:01] and everybody's got a different idea of
[1:46:06] what he is he said you can't know him by
[1:46:09] a picture or you can't you he says or
[1:46:12] different ones
[1:46:13] you can't know him by different
[1:46:15] understandings
[1:46:17] you've got to be able to identify him
[1:46:20] yourself amen
[1:46:24] you surely don't want to end up with my
[1:46:27] idea
[1:46:28] of something
[1:46:30] aren't you glad God give us an absolute
[1:46:33] so we can get rid of our ideas
[1:46:38] I can't convey to you
[1:46:42] my revelation
[1:46:45] I can I can only preach to you my
[1:46:47] revelation
[1:46:49] you understand that
[1:46:51] I would love to be able to preach to you
[1:46:54] brother Brandon's revelation
[1:46:59] I don't have brother brahm's revelation
[1:47:01] I have the Revelation that God gave me
[1:47:04] and I hope in Fellowship it matches up
[1:47:07] with the revelation God gave you but
[1:47:10] don't take it second hand
[1:47:13] that's the problem with the church is
[1:47:16] secondhand Revelation they never pray
[1:47:19] through they never go listen that's why
[1:47:22] I believe in listening to the tapes not
[1:47:26] only can your personal life because God
[1:47:29] deals with the Earth
[1:47:32] the church
[1:47:34] the world
[1:47:35] the church and the individual the same
[1:47:39] way
[1:47:43] so God did he sent a message to the
[1:47:45] Earth
[1:47:47] he sent a message to the church
[1:47:50] and he sent a message to the individual
[1:47:54] and the message is the source
[1:47:58] of everything we teach
[1:48:00] everything we stand for it's the
[1:48:03] original the spoken word is the Original
[1:48:07] Seed
[1:48:09] what was spoke in the beginning in a way
[1:48:12] of a true Prophet is to be to be lip to
[1:48:15] ear with God that he can speak to you
[1:48:18] God's thoughts
[1:48:22] many times those thoughts are in the
[1:48:23] form of Prophecy sometimes those
[1:48:25] thoughts are in the way of Correction
[1:48:27] sometimes those thoughts are going back
[1:48:29] to where you were
[1:48:31] how can God go back
[1:48:34] because he was there when it happened
[1:48:37] oh Hallelujah
[1:48:42] I remember the prophet of God one time
[1:48:44] he says I can just see Lazarus I can
[1:48:47] just see Jesus coming out of the
[1:48:49] mountains and he's hungry
[1:48:52] I've been to where they said those
[1:48:53] mountains are
[1:48:55] and if you travel North in a little West
[1:48:57] you come into Nazareth
[1:49:01] they have a spot that's what they call
[1:49:03] it you point way up in those mountains
[1:49:04] in Israel overlooking Jordan and they
[1:49:06] say that's the mount Temptation up there
[1:49:09] that's where Jesus and Satan had it out
[1:49:15] he says I'm going to go down and he says
[1:49:18] I can just see Jesus coming out and
[1:49:20] going down and picking up his friend
[1:49:21] Lazarus
[1:49:24] and them going down to the river
[1:49:27] where John was
[1:49:29] and been down to the spot where they
[1:49:31] said John was
[1:49:33] and I thought
[1:49:34] my
[1:49:36] wouldn't it be something just to be able
[1:49:38] to see that unfold just the way it was
[1:49:41] you know how you do that because you're
[1:49:42] a part of Eternity
[1:49:46] I hope that drops in
[1:49:48] that's what makes something divine
[1:49:51] that's what makes something Supernatural
[1:49:53] because it's part of Eternity so he says
[1:49:56] you gotta you've got to recognize it he
[1:49:59] said he says so if he shows up with nail
[1:50:01] scars hands you're not going to buy that
[1:50:04] so this is what he says let's let this
[1:50:06] settle in just a moment this morning
[1:50:07] I'll move quickly
[1:50:09] he says but what
[1:50:11] why could he be the same yesterday today
[1:50:14] and forever see we have to learn now
[1:50:18] what
[1:50:20] he
[1:50:22] is
[1:50:25] what he is I would love to go back and
[1:50:27] spend some time how he described what
[1:50:31] time is
[1:50:33] it's just a little space in eternity
[1:50:36] time is part of Eternity it's just a
[1:50:39] space we're just in a space
[1:50:44] don't let this space
[1:50:47] defeat you
[1:50:51] this is the Captivity of Satan
[1:50:55] is to be caught in this space of time
[1:51:00] that's what he doesn't want you to break
[1:51:03] free from
[1:51:04] is the effect of time
[1:51:07] The Changing Times
[1:51:10] trying to keep up with time
[1:51:12] he wants you to get caught up in the
[1:51:16] importance of this piddly 70 80 years
[1:51:21] that God might give you here
[1:51:23] and trade that for eternity what if the
[1:51:28] prophet the man if he gaineth the whole
[1:51:31] world and loses his soul
[1:51:37] get your great big ribberings
[1:51:40] doctor
[1:51:42] LPG
[1:51:45] ABC David McGarry here sir would you
[1:51:47] please stand up
[1:51:49] I have come into your presence
[1:51:55] that's touch and such
[1:52:02] I I like old brother Jess Trammell you
[1:52:05] didn't know brother Jess but brother
[1:52:07] just trim will use something else
[1:52:09] he's gone on to be with the Lord
[1:52:11] but I remember a bunch of brothers were
[1:52:13] talking one day and they said and they
[1:52:14] got talking about some somebody you know
[1:52:18] oh I don't know it was Babe Ruth or
[1:52:20] somebody they got mommy he said he said
[1:52:23] I don't know no Babe Ruth he never
[1:52:25] helped me and no Revival
[1:52:29] I like that
[1:52:31] I don't know these things I don't want
[1:52:33] to be like you know that's a sin
[1:52:36] in the Bible immunization to imitate to
[1:52:39] emulate something to look at a hair do
[1:52:42] and say ooh that looked good on me
[1:52:44] well I know Herod looked good on me but
[1:52:46] I lost the Strand
[1:52:49] I ain't lost to one that's right
[1:52:53] don't get caught up
[1:52:56] don't get caught up in this space of
[1:52:59] time that's what he's trying to get us
[1:53:01] back to out of this time back to
[1:53:05] Eternity Hallelujah
[1:53:06] don't let go let your sickness steal it
[1:53:09] from you don't let your finances your
[1:53:11] troubles to mess it don't let nothing
[1:53:14] steal
[1:53:15] eternity from you
[1:53:20] tune in
[1:53:22] you've been given the greatest resource
[1:53:25] that any Generations ever had the
[1:53:27] returning of Jesus Christ failed in
[1:53:30] flesh doing the same Works he did when
[1:53:32] he was on Earth 2 000 years ago
[1:53:37] and we can't recognize it
[1:53:40] because the messenger says there's too
[1:53:42] many fingers pointing elsewhere
[1:53:50] I'm learning to take the criticism
[1:53:55] like he plays tapes because he can't
[1:53:57] preach
[1:53:59] okay fine
[1:54:02] preaching ain't worth a cent if it don't
[1:54:05] have no word in it
[1:54:10] the very source
[1:54:13] of all truth to this generation
[1:54:17] and they won't even play their his voice
[1:54:19] and their Church
[1:54:22] go there if you want
[1:54:28] you'll starve to death and not
[1:54:32] know it
[1:54:33] thinking you have need of nothing and
[1:54:36] not knowing thinking you're prospering
[1:54:38] thinking you're rich in the spirit and
[1:54:41] not knowing it I'll say it well it can
[1:54:43] take me off YouTube or not you will not
[1:54:46] make it without the guide of this
[1:54:49] message through this dark hour that
[1:54:52] we're in
[1:54:56] and as a man I do not have the ability
[1:55:00] nor do I want the responsibility
[1:55:07] somebody already took that for me he
[1:55:09] said I'll have to give account for every
[1:55:12] word
[1:55:14] we had another man that was in that same
[1:55:16] Spirit he said be followers of me as I
[1:55:20] am of Christ
[1:55:24] so we got to know what he is
[1:55:27] we understand that right so we're moving
[1:55:29] to something quickly here and I don't
[1:55:32] mean to defend myself but you can't have
[1:55:34] a you can't have your own conception
[1:55:39] and everybody's trying to give us today
[1:55:43] some sort of conception
[1:55:46] and identification of how do we identify
[1:55:50] him
[1:55:51] in our midst
[1:55:55] now if it's going to be him it has to be
[1:55:59] a word identification
[1:56:04] not an anointing identification
[1:56:09] not a movement
[1:56:11] identification
[1:56:14] not a sensation
[1:56:16] identification
[1:56:19] you can't go somewhere and have chills
[1:56:21] run up and down your spine and say
[1:56:23] that's God
[1:56:25] in fact you can't even say that the
[1:56:28] storm clouds above you mean God's
[1:56:30] against you or the sunshine above you
[1:56:33] means God's for you you find your
[1:56:36] identity in one thing and that's the
[1:56:39] promise that God gave you in your work
[1:56:41] every promise in this book is mine every
[1:56:45] chapter every verse every life every
[1:56:48] promise in this book is mine every
[1:56:51] chapter every verse every line
[1:56:53] everything the Spirit came the spirit
[1:56:56] never came to speak of itself but to
[1:56:59] bring us in remembrance of all things
[1:57:01] that he said
[1:57:04] oh that's the word
[1:57:09] are you with me
[1:57:15] I don't want to be mad at the Devil and
[1:57:16] make you think I'm mad at you
[1:57:21] we love this word
[1:57:23] but understand now we're just trying to
[1:57:25] build just in this few little sections
[1:57:27] that we went through I'm sure every
[1:57:29] single one of you gleaned this out of
[1:57:31] this paragraphs we just read
[1:57:35] as you were sitting there I know you saw
[1:57:37] all this so just bear with me
[1:57:40] I'm a little slower than most of you
[1:57:43] so he said he said you have all he said
[1:57:46] I've talked to all kinds of different
[1:57:48] Foursquare gospel people all kinds of
[1:57:50] people each individual there's many
[1:57:52] different
[1:57:53] but he says listen to this
[1:57:55] we've got to have something
[1:57:58] that we can come to
[1:58:01] some conclusion
[1:58:03] or we know won't know to where were
[1:58:08] going
[1:58:15] you know the trouble of most of these
[1:58:16] movements are they don't know where
[1:58:18] they're going yeah
[1:58:20] yeah they don't know where they're going
[1:58:21] to end up
[1:58:25] they don't know what the next thing on
[1:58:27] the agenda is
[1:58:29] they won't they won't know what's going
[1:58:31] to happen the next service
[1:58:34] I can tell you what's going to happen
[1:58:36] the next service
[1:58:37] the word of God's going to be preached
[1:58:40] what William Branham taught
[1:58:43] is going to be fed to us
[1:58:46] so we can get a personal revelation for
[1:58:49] ourselves
[1:58:51] oh no
[1:58:55] you say what's the next Jersey it's
[1:58:57] going to be exactly what God's will
[1:59:00] will be
[1:59:03] you can't say that well then if I can't
[1:59:06] say that then I can't say the footsteps
[1:59:08] of the righteous are ordered by the Lord
[1:59:12] the footsteps of the righteous
[1:59:15] are ordered
[1:59:16] by the Lord
[1:59:18] have confidence in them if God be for
[1:59:21] you
[1:59:22] who can be against you he's not against
[1:59:25] you he's not trying you
[1:59:28] God doesn't tempt any man
[1:59:34] he defeated the tempter
[1:59:37] he set you free if God before you who
[1:59:41] can be against you I surely don't want
[1:59:43] God against me that's a losing battle
[1:59:48] he finally told Paul Paul it's hard to
[1:59:50] kick against the prick son
[1:59:52] you're a church days messenger
[1:59:55] persecuting the church ain't gonna work
[2:00:00] so what did he do
[2:00:02] he went back on the back side of the
[2:00:05] desert and he searched the scriptures
[2:00:08] concerning the Messiah
[2:00:11] and he saw Jesus Christ standing in the
[2:00:16] word the same yesterday today and
[2:00:19] forever fulfilling every prophecy that
[2:00:22] was spoken of him he said when he did
[2:00:25] that he could come out there and write
[2:00:27] the book of Hebrews
[2:00:30] explaining who this Melchizedek was oh
[2:00:34] this message is so wonderful
[2:00:37] so wonderful
[2:00:39] so let's just read we're just reading
[2:00:41] here so we don't know where we're going
[2:00:45] and I think the thing that would settle
[2:00:48] that would be the word of God regardless
[2:00:51] of our Creeds and our thoughts the word
[2:00:55] of God
[2:00:57] ought to
[2:00:58] settle it
[2:01:00] then I'm just gonna
[2:01:02] so many little things you go back to
[2:01:04] listen to it but I want to pick up on
[2:01:07] something that
[2:01:09] that stood out
[2:01:11] so very much to me he said if we don't
[2:01:15] get this absolute down
[2:01:17] then we won't know where he's going
[2:01:20] right
[2:01:21] so we've been over this so many times so
[2:01:25] this is what we realize paragraph 63 he
[2:01:29] was the manifestation of God
[2:01:33] that's what he was
[2:01:36] so he was everything the word said he
[2:01:40] would be
[2:01:41] is that correct
[2:01:45] it was God in Christ
[2:01:48] reconciling the world to himself
[2:01:51] he was expressing what the father
[2:01:55] was
[2:01:58] so everything that Jesus did he was
[2:02:01] expression of what the father was right
[2:02:05] so we we we see that and we we see that
[2:02:09] he said and we knew that because he said
[2:02:12] these simple things I
[2:02:15] I always do that which pleases the
[2:02:18] father
[2:02:19] he said I do nothing unless the father
[2:02:23] has showed me he said to Philip he who
[2:02:26] hath seen me
[2:02:28] have seen God
[2:02:31] so if we know what his identity was
[2:02:35] what was Jesus identity
[2:02:39] one he did only the will of the father
[2:02:43] and what the father showed him
[2:02:48] therefore in doing that
[2:02:52] he was one with the word
[2:02:57] what identified him if he was the
[2:03:01] prophecy that was prophesied of him
[2:03:05] coming to pass
[2:03:07] he was that that uh enmity
[2:03:12] between her seed and satency
[2:03:18] he woke the heel that was to be bruised
[2:03:21] there's what is it
[2:03:24] 660 some prophecies I forget the number
[2:03:27] somebody's figured it out concerning him
[2:03:31] and what he fulfilled
[2:03:33] he said I didn't come to do away with
[2:03:36] the law I've come to fulfill it every
[2:03:39] jot
[2:03:40] every Tittle every drop his identity
[2:03:45] was not his signs and wonders
[2:03:49] that was his Vindication his identity
[2:03:52] was the Fulfillment of the word that was
[2:03:56] spoken of him because he could have done
[2:03:59] all those signs and wonders but if he
[2:04:02] didn't identify and fulfill that word he
[2:04:05] wasn't what the word spoke of oh hear me
[2:04:14] it Vindicated them
[2:04:17] right but he had to do those things
[2:04:19] because the word said he would do those
[2:04:21] things that he'd bind up the
[2:04:23] Brokenhearted that he'd heal this he
[2:04:25] would do that he'd set the captive free
[2:04:27] that was part of his identity that's why
[2:04:30] he said to him if you can't believe me
[2:04:32] for my word the best thing at least
[2:04:35] believe me for my signs and wonders
[2:04:37] because they testify of me
[2:04:44] but you can't separate them
[2:04:47] you can't take signs you can't take
[2:04:49] wonders you can't move to the spirit
[2:04:51] speaking a tongues prophecy and all
[2:04:54] those things and separate it from the
[2:04:56] word of God and end up with him
[2:05:01] oh May that set so deep
[2:05:07] if somebody's preaching the gospel
[2:05:11] without the message of this age they're
[2:05:15] preaching to you a historical gospel or
[2:05:18] a fantasy future
[2:05:24] there's one reality
[2:05:27] of the word of God in this generation
[2:05:29] and that's the message that God
[2:05:32] Vindicated and sent to this generation
[2:05:35] because God does nothing unless he first
[2:05:39] it looks delivers it and speaks it to
[2:05:43] his servant the prophet
[2:05:45] so the first way you can identify
[2:05:48] whether it's God or not did it come by
[2:05:51] the way that God provided
[2:05:54] if it don't come by the prophet it isn't
[2:05:57] God's way
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:05] the church for Seven Ages has just been
[2:06:07] preaching what Paul brought
[2:06:11] they couldn't put it together
[2:06:14] so God had to send another Prophet to
[2:06:16] open the seals that that the Mysteries
[2:06:19] could reveal so we could finally
[2:06:21] understand who we are
[2:06:24] I'm getting too long man but I love I
[2:06:27] can't I love it I love it I love it
[2:06:31] my friend always says that to me
[2:06:35] all right so let's move on
[2:06:38] so we know about this eternally right
[2:06:43] but Paul says this now
[2:06:45] and this is where I want to end up
[2:06:48] this morning
[2:06:50] because we're talking about he's he laid
[2:06:52] something in for in US
[2:06:55] for us
[2:06:56] to identify
[2:06:59] now just to add some side like he's
[2:07:01] sitting talking to a group of people in
[2:07:04] Tampa Bay
[2:07:07] and he says you've got to know where
[2:07:08] you're going
[2:07:09] another is he's telling me you guys
[2:07:11] don't know where you're going
[2:07:15] okay
[2:07:17] he's saying
[2:07:18] you
[2:07:20] can't live
[2:07:23] looking back
[2:07:27] let's just stay here just first man
[2:07:30] let's read it paragraph
[2:07:32] paragraph 73.
[2:07:35] so we already know right by bro all of
[2:07:39] us know the seed's been bred in US
[2:07:41] any question with who you are
[2:07:44] that your name's on the land Book of
[2:07:45] Life that's not what we're trying to
[2:07:47] settle anymore
[2:07:49] what we're wanting to know is how can we
[2:07:53] identify
[2:07:55] if God is in our midst
[2:07:57] because if you can't identify him here
[2:08:00] you better run to some place that you
[2:08:03] think he is
[2:08:07] you would be better off and the body
[2:08:10] would be better off
[2:08:18] you would
[2:08:21] no need walking out of here every day
[2:08:23] saying
[2:08:24] criticizing
[2:08:27] that doesn't help nobody
[2:08:30] well because this Paul said forgetting
[2:08:32] those things that are in the past
[2:08:36] I press toward the mark
[2:08:38] of the higher calling in Christ Jesus
[2:08:44] see don't look at what you were look at
[2:08:49] what you're going to be now that's the
[2:08:53] trouble
[2:08:54] right there
[2:08:57] people trying to identify him
[2:09:00] by Looking Back
[2:09:03] they see what he has was in another age
[2:09:07] they look back to Pentecost
[2:09:10] and they say where are all the Miracles
[2:09:14] where are all the gifts
[2:09:17] where are all the signs
[2:09:24] this is
[2:09:26] this is what we used to be
[2:09:29] this is what we were we're looking back
[2:09:32] we got We've Got The Look Back how the
[2:09:35] spirit moved
[2:09:38] you asked they're looking back
[2:09:43] now you can't do that in your personal
[2:09:46] life
[2:09:47] because if you look past the blood
[2:09:51] you don't want to go into the sea of
[2:09:54] God's forgetfulness and try to find
[2:09:57] something that God don't even remember
[2:10:00] because if you go dig it out of there
[2:10:03] and you pick it up again to God he
[2:10:06] already forgive it and it don't exist
[2:10:09] and you're stuck with it in your mind
[2:10:20] am I too gone
[2:10:26] because if your crock pot's gonna boil
[2:10:28] over we got at least another 30 minutes
[2:10:33] save me some
[2:10:36] so they're looking back
[2:10:38] so we find out what happens to the
[2:10:41] church they come up to a certain place
[2:10:44] they don't know where they're going
[2:10:49] so if you don't know where you're going
[2:10:51] you go back to where you come from
[2:10:58] else you're just wandering around in
[2:11:00] circles
[2:11:02] looking this way looked in that way I
[2:11:04] know there's a big taste out there for
[2:11:06] these things
[2:11:08] you think I'd preach this way
[2:11:11] if I didn't know where I was standing
[2:11:16] you'd think I'm afraid of this message
[2:11:18] it's the power of God
[2:11:24] if the battle come down and I stood
[2:11:27] before an intellect and I stood before a
[2:11:29] big name or whatever it is you don't
[2:11:31] think I know what God's Gonna back he's
[2:11:34] going to back the voice of this
[2:11:35] messenger every time
[2:11:41] I'll just shrink down
[2:11:43] like this and I said I said what he said
[2:11:51] I said what he said
[2:11:54] you didn't shout no I didn't jump
[2:11:57] you didn't run around the church no I
[2:11:59] didn't run around the church
[2:12:00] you didn't have a prayer line where
[2:12:02] everybody fell out no we didn't have a
[2:12:04] prayer line where everybody fell out
[2:12:08] but I've seen prayer lines
[2:12:11] I've seen prayer lines where Jesus
[2:12:12] Christ himself
[2:12:14] was standing there
[2:12:19] and they walk up
[2:12:23] and he's there
[2:12:26] and he begins to talk to him and he says
[2:12:29] you feel something
[2:12:31] right now a real warm feeling all over
[2:12:36] you it's him
[2:12:43] there was a prayer line where somebody
[2:12:45] fell out
[2:12:46] how many of those were it was hat
[2:12:49] Oregon
[2:12:50] right
[2:12:51] a big old bully stood up there
[2:12:56] he fell out
[2:12:59] they were in the presence
[2:13:03] the most anointed presence
[2:13:07] that's been in this generation
[2:13:10] Way Beyond the personal anointing
[2:13:13] of an individual
[2:13:15] that was Emmanuel the crater of Heaven
[2:13:18] and Earth the one that could go back the
[2:13:21] one that could go forward the one that
[2:13:23] could stand there and say I take every
[2:13:25] spirit in this building under my control
[2:13:27] in the name of Jesus Christ look at that
[2:13:31] prayer line
[2:13:32] there's your example
[2:13:34] of a prayer line there's your example of
[2:13:38] the movement of the spirit
[2:13:42] you know what's happened
[2:13:46] we don't hold that in esteem anymore
[2:13:49] you see this picture here
[2:13:53] that's what man thinks
[2:13:56] that is the closest picture you'll ever
[2:13:59] see to Jesus Christ in your whole life
[2:14:02] that's the same Pillar of Fire that led
[2:14:05] the children of Israel it's the same
[2:14:07] Pillar of Fire that John saw this ending
[2:14:10] up here it's the same Pillar of Fire
[2:14:12] that Jesus said when he left this Earth
[2:14:15] he went back into the logus of God and
[2:14:18] they won't even put it up in their
[2:14:21] Church
[2:14:22] they're too ashamed of it
[2:14:26] you're not gonna you're not gonna
[2:14:30] forget it
[2:14:32] I know the leader of this age
[2:14:40] all I can say the prophet of God said it
[2:14:42] was more than a teacher okay it's more
[2:14:45] than a man it was more than a prophet
[2:14:49] I hope you caught it
[2:14:52] so we're going to close up
[2:14:56] you ready for clothes
[2:14:58] but I haven't I haven't even showed you
[2:15:00] my sermon yet have I
[2:15:04] if you could walk out right now and be
[2:15:06] happy I'd walk out of here at the
[2:15:08] question mark what in the world were you
[2:15:10] talking about
[2:15:13] huh
[2:15:14] because I promised we could identify him
[2:15:19] that's a bold statement
[2:15:21] isn't it
[2:15:24] I'm on the line
[2:15:30] the prophet get on the line all the time
[2:15:33] he'd say you know I'm waiting for
[2:15:35] something
[2:15:40] and then you talk about Africa and he'd
[2:15:42] talk about this he'd talk on he talked
[2:15:44] he says you know I'm waiting for
[2:15:46] something
[2:15:47] but he had a promise right he said if
[2:15:50] you were sincere
[2:15:52] I'd be there
[2:15:54] and all of a sudden he'd say he's here
[2:16:01] he's here
[2:16:04] he's here this morning
[2:16:06] standing in his word
[2:16:08] because he said wherever two or three
[2:16:10] people are gathered together he'd be
[2:16:12] there
[2:16:13] the trouble is we don't know how to
[2:16:16] identify him because we don't know who
[2:16:19] he is
[2:16:23] and somebody's offering us
[2:16:25] other identifications
[2:16:30] Satan can interpret every gift of the
[2:16:34] spirit
[2:16:35] except the Fulfillment of the word
[2:16:42] this is oil
[2:16:45] a lot of people anoint with oil
[2:16:48] the oil don't heal you it's the faith in
[2:16:52] the word
[2:16:53] that heals you
[2:16:55] all right so let's let's
[2:16:58] get this beautiful thing down
[2:17:01] so we find out that they're looking back
[2:17:05] the reason they look back is because
[2:17:07] they don't know where they're going
[2:17:10] or they won't accept
[2:17:14] where God is taking them
[2:17:19] right how many can identify that spirit
[2:17:21] in the first Exodus
[2:17:26] where are you taking us
[2:17:30] we had
[2:17:31] we had oil and garlic and and in Egypt
[2:17:39] we'd have the task Masters
[2:17:41] but at least we have the spirit
[2:17:44] that's what people want today they want
[2:17:46] to be stuck with all the task masters of
[2:17:48] the world they want to be stuck in time
[2:17:51] as long as they can have what they had
[2:17:57] hear me
[2:17:59] they don't know where they're going so
[2:18:02] they're going back to Pentecost
[2:18:07] because as a
[2:18:09] seed matures the shut pulls away from it
[2:18:15] Pentecost was a carrier
[2:18:18] it carried the true pure word that went
[2:18:23] into the ground Pentecost was carrying
[2:18:26] Christ
[2:18:27] the anointed word
[2:18:31] all the way till that seed matured
[2:18:36] so as the as the message been been
[2:18:40] preached over the last 50 years
[2:18:43] that seed inside of that Chuck has been
[2:18:47] maturing
[2:18:51] it's been growing in stature it's been
[2:18:54] growing to the perfect Willow it's
[2:18:57] becoming subject to the message that
[2:18:59] it's been hearing
[2:19:02] been now in this final stage comes
[2:19:07] the ripening of the Sun
[2:19:10] the coming of the Capstone
[2:19:13] when it finally gets to that final
[2:19:15] maturity of that word seed they they all
[2:19:19] of a sudden manifest Pentecost they go
[2:19:23] into emotionalism and sensationalism and
[2:19:27] Leadership of the spirit they reject
[2:19:32] the peer leadership of the word of God
[2:19:35] they go back to their Trinity thinking
[2:19:37] the Bible's just the same the spirit
[2:19:40] moves the word of God they they don't
[2:19:43] look at any of them being an absolute
[2:19:48] this Bible and message are not two
[2:19:51] different things
[2:19:55] the Mysteries didn't come outside this
[2:19:57] book
[2:19:58] they were laying in this book
[2:20:02] it took the way that God does something
[2:20:04] I'll not do nothing I won't speak to the
[2:20:07] people no more I'll speak to my prophets
[2:20:10] it took the prophet to put this and this
[2:20:13] and let us know where this was pointing
[2:20:20] where it was taking it where he was
[2:20:23] going
[2:20:27] they don't know where we're going
[2:20:30] because they don't have the messengers
[2:20:32] in absolute no more
[2:20:34] they won't play as tapes
[2:20:36] they won't put the pillar of fire in
[2:20:38] their Church you say are those are are
[2:20:41] those requirements no
[2:20:44] they're not requirements
[2:20:46] you don't have to have it in there
[2:20:48] but you still have to believe every word
[2:20:50] he says
[2:20:52] I just don't know why anybody's ashamed
[2:20:54] of it
[2:20:59] um
[2:21:00] don't worry my sheep know my voice
[2:21:04] and another they don't follow
[2:21:06] you don't have to change the voice of
[2:21:08] The Voice
[2:21:09] to get the person to hear it
[2:21:14] that ego never changed its scream
[2:21:17] it scared the fire out of those chickens
[2:21:21] but he wasn't a chicken to begin with
[2:21:30] this message is the only way of Escape
[2:21:34] if you don't get in the ark
[2:21:37] you're going to drown
[2:21:40] it's the only place of safety
[2:21:43] so we're going to finish
[2:21:45] they don't know where they're going
[2:21:47] so they look back
[2:21:49] so and and that's what happened so the
[2:21:52] question is we he's identified by his
[2:21:56] word
[2:21:58] so Jesus was identified that God was in
[2:22:01] their presence and he was God by the
[2:22:05] word that he fulfilled
[2:22:09] that's the only way he's identified by
[2:22:13] the word that he's fulfilled now I want
[2:22:15] you to offend just 10 minutes with me
[2:22:17] right now open your Bibles
[2:22:30] to John 17.
[2:22:34] and this is the word of God
[2:22:37] telling us where we're going
[2:22:44] how do we know that God's in our midst
[2:22:48] how do we know he's Among Us
[2:22:51] because he's doing what he said he would
[2:22:54] do
[2:22:56] in our age
[2:23:02] right so we know that he identified
[2:23:06] himself
[2:23:07] now he wants to be identified in his
[2:23:10] church
[2:23:12] but he can't be identified in his church
[2:23:14] any other way that he was identified he
[2:23:18] was identified by fulfilling the word
[2:23:21] so if the bride is the bride who she
[2:23:25] claims to be
[2:23:26] she will have to have the same
[2:23:29] identification as her husband
[2:23:37] and people are trying to give you an
[2:23:39] identification of another age
[2:23:42] but let's go back you say can you take
[2:23:44] that from the Bible yes sir
[2:23:48] same
[2:23:51] is it the spirit same
[2:23:55] the spirit of God came to bring you into
[2:23:57] remembrance
[2:24:01] now let's listen very closely may I set
[2:24:05] the setting
[2:24:07] Jesus has just
[2:24:10] had communion
[2:24:13] with the Saints
[2:24:16] is that right
[2:24:18] now he's been betrayed
[2:24:24] and he's went to the garden
[2:24:27] to pray
[2:24:30] he knows what's lying ahead of him
[2:24:35] the burden was so great
[2:24:38] because it was the burdens of the sins
[2:24:41] of the world we're going to be upon him
[2:24:45] nobody else could pay it but him
[2:24:50] if he didn't do it mankind was lost
[2:24:57] he couldn't do it as God
[2:25:00] because then he couldn't have done it
[2:25:03] for us
[2:25:05] he wouldn't have been a Kinsmen Redeemer
[2:25:09] the pressure is so great on him
[2:25:12] the knowledge of what lies ahead of him
[2:25:15] because he knew the scriptures
[2:25:18] they'd pierce his side
[2:25:21] his nails
[2:25:23] he'd have a crown
[2:25:26] so much was the burden that he's
[2:25:28] sweating in blood
[2:25:32] now he's going to ask the father
[2:25:35] what he wants his ministry
[2:25:39] to accomplish
[2:25:43] John 17 is Jesus's testimony
[2:25:48] it's the testimony of his faith
[2:25:52] you've all heard perfect Faith right if
[2:25:54] he believed who he was why can't we
[2:25:56] believe who we are oh let's just read
[2:25:59] this together
[2:26:00] and then we'll close
[2:26:03] put yourself in the scriptures
[2:26:06] this is Jesus speaking
[2:26:10] these words spank Jesus
[2:26:13] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[2:26:16] said
[2:26:17] father
[2:26:19] the hour is come
[2:26:22] glorify thy son
[2:26:25] that thy son Also may glorify
[2:26:30] thee
[2:26:32] that
[2:26:35] that
[2:26:36] The Hours come glorify your son
[2:26:42] that thy son Also may glorify thee
[2:26:48] how many want to join in that father
[2:26:51] glorify me
[2:26:53] that thy son and daughter may also
[2:26:56] glorify thee
[2:26:58] as thou hath given him Power Over All
[2:27:02] Flesh
[2:27:05] that
[2:27:07] he should give eternal life to as many
[2:27:11] as doubt hath given him
[2:27:16] okay
[2:27:20] these this is
[2:27:22] this is where he's going
[2:27:25] this is how you identify him
[2:27:28] this is what he's accomplishing
[2:27:32] and this is eternal life
[2:27:36] that they might know the the only true
[2:27:40] God and Jesus Christ whom thou hath sent
[2:27:44] every single one has a that it's a
[2:27:48] purpose I'm going to Calvary that they
[2:27:51] might know you I'm going to Calvary that
[2:27:54] you might be glorified
[2:27:57] now in order for us to identify Christ
[2:28:00] in our midst we would have to identify
[2:28:04] the word that he spoke manifesting in
[2:28:08] flesh
[2:28:12] so this would be how you would know as
[2:28:14] we keep going
[2:28:18] I have glorified thee on the Earth
[2:28:22] and have finished the work which thou
[2:28:24] giveth me to do
[2:28:30] and now O Father glorify
[2:28:34] thou me with thy own
[2:28:37] self
[2:28:39] and with the glory which I had with thee
[2:28:44] before the world was
[2:28:48] who else taught that
[2:28:51] your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:28:53] here he is
[2:28:57] what you think brother Brandon preached
[2:29:00] a different message than Jesus did no he
[2:29:03] was the word this is what he came to the
[2:29:06] church the message wasn't against you it
[2:29:09] was for you it was to bring you out of
[2:29:11] Egypt
[2:29:15] he's preaching to us now same Jesus
[2:29:21] same son of man
[2:29:23] bailed in a different flesh
[2:29:26] saying father that they might have the
[2:29:29] glory that I had with thee in the
[2:29:32] beginning he's preaching to the church
[2:29:34] church that you might have the glory
[2:29:38] that you had him in the beginning that's
[2:29:41] how you know
[2:29:43] whether he's among you or not is whether
[2:29:46] he's fulfilling the word that's spoken
[2:29:49] of you
[2:29:51] not some Sensation from another age
[2:30:01] I glorified thee on Earth
[2:30:07] what verse am I on
[2:30:10] what
[2:30:11] six okay I have manifested thy name unto
[2:30:15] men which thou
[2:30:17] giveth me out of the world
[2:30:20] thine they were
[2:30:24] oh
[2:30:27] who came and told us if you ever had
[2:30:30] eternal life you always had thine they
[2:30:32] were you were his you were his here's
[2:30:35] our messenger in our day preaching John
[2:30:38] 17 to us because it's the identity of
[2:30:42] his ministry what he taught
[2:30:47] now the only way you're going to find
[2:30:49] out whether he's in the midst of the
[2:30:50] church
[2:30:51] or whether he's among us if the things
[2:30:54] we continue to read are coming to pass
[2:31:01] that simple
[2:31:02] call me a simpleton
[2:31:05] that just happens to be where God's hid
[2:31:10] that's read
[2:31:15] we're trying to rope
[2:31:17] thine they were and thou giveth them me
[2:31:24] and they have kept Thy word what did he
[2:31:30] give them
[2:31:31] who was he
[2:31:33] the word
[2:31:35] you gave them me the word
[2:31:38] and they kept that word
[2:31:42] you identify the church
[2:31:45] by its obedience to the word of God
[2:31:50] you identify him in your midst by
[2:31:53] obedience to the word of God
[2:31:56] if you love me
[2:31:58] you will keep my Commandments
[2:32:02] now they have known that all things
[2:32:06] whatsoever thou hath given me are of
[2:32:12] Thee
[2:32:16] oh
[2:32:18] that one's tough
[2:32:23] everything he gave us
[2:32:26] they recognize it in this day him
[2:32:29] standing here in this day everything he
[2:32:32] gave us
[2:32:34] was of him
[2:32:38] you go someplace
[2:32:40] and they don't agree everything that he
[2:32:42] was givenness is of him
[2:32:45] I don't care what they do
[2:32:51] not the identity he's not among you
[2:32:54] if he's among you
[2:32:57] every bit of the word that he givesness
[2:32:59] you know it's of him that's how you know
[2:33:02] he's amongst you
[2:33:05] how he's identifying himself in his
[2:33:09] church
[2:33:11] proves whether he's with them or not
[2:33:14] I'm trying to make this simple but am I
[2:33:17] am I clear let's keep reading and we're
[2:33:19] going to be closed here but it it's
[2:33:22] beautiful let's just keep going here
[2:33:25] he says
[2:33:27] for I have given unto them
[2:33:30] thy Words which thou giveth me
[2:33:37] they weren't his words
[2:33:40] they were Eternal words
[2:33:43] he didn't speak anything less the father
[2:33:45] showed him
[2:33:47] he only spoke what the father told him
[2:33:49] to speak
[2:33:54] can you see him standing in this age
[2:33:58] the first fruit
[2:34:01] preaching the word of God
[2:34:09] for I have given them The Words which
[2:34:11] thou giveth me
[2:34:12] and they have received them
[2:34:15] and have known surely that I came out
[2:34:19] from thee and they have believed that
[2:34:22] thou didst send
[2:34:26] me
[2:34:31] Glory
[2:34:35] I saw him I believe that God sent him
[2:34:40] I received the words as they were spoken
[2:34:43] I believe they came from God
[2:34:47] everybody wants the faith
[2:34:52] restored that the disciples have they
[2:34:54] don't want the faith
[2:34:56] they want the works without the faith
[2:35:00] but that's what they did he's
[2:35:03] identifying his boots then father they
[2:35:06] believed you sent me they believed the
[2:35:08] words I said and the belief the words
[2:35:10] that I said were from you
[2:35:14] now do you believe that
[2:35:17] when he showed up veiled in a body
[2:35:21] of a messenger
[2:35:24] you believe it was the same word you
[2:35:25] believe it came from the father do you
[2:35:27] believe the father gave it to him
[2:35:31] oh now you're starting to get the
[2:35:33] foundation of whether he's amongst us or
[2:35:36] not don't let anybody take it from you
[2:35:45] let's go
[2:35:48] I pray for them
[2:35:50] I pray not for the world
[2:35:58] he didn't pray for everybody
[2:36:00] he knew everybody wouldn't be saved
[2:36:03] he knew it was only them that the father
[2:36:06] hath given him
[2:36:09] don't join yourself up to something
[2:36:13] that's not you
[2:36:17] how can two walk together
[2:36:20] unless they agree
[2:36:24] how can you serve two masters
[2:36:29] can you imagine me preaching at the
[2:36:31] Baptist church on Sunday
[2:36:33] and then coming here and preaching the
[2:36:35] message on another day
[2:36:38] and having two Messengers
[2:36:42] you would know where you were going
[2:36:45] you couldn't preach the Full Gospel
[2:36:48] you couldn't preach against things
[2:36:53] that's what happens in people's lives
[2:36:56] they get a mark on their life
[2:36:59] and they'll avoid the gospel that has
[2:37:02] anything to do with that Mark
[2:37:04] foreign
[2:37:09] delivered from cigarettes
[2:37:11] if you're delivered from cigarettes
[2:37:15] cigarettes don't bother you
[2:37:19] you don't have to avoid the crowd
[2:37:21] because somebody's smoking there
[2:37:23] and you you're going to go
[2:37:27] I gotta have some of that
[2:37:30] you don't sit there battling whether or
[2:37:32] not you're kind of puff
[2:37:33] if you've been delivered you've been
[2:37:35] delivered
[2:37:37] if you're still taking drugs you're not
[2:37:39] really don't want to preach against
[2:37:41] drugs
[2:37:43] if you're still doing things you don't
[2:37:45] want to preach against them
[2:37:47] if you're still a hot head you don't
[2:37:49] want to preach against being a hot head
[2:37:55] the word
[2:37:58] but you you know
[2:38:01] preach the word whether you're guilty of
[2:38:02] it or not
[2:38:05] it'll set you free
[2:38:09] so let's just read we're just getting
[2:38:11] started
[2:38:13] you can leave if you want
[2:38:16] you have my blessings
[2:38:18] I pray for them I don't pray for the
[2:38:20] world
[2:38:21] but for them which thou hath given me
[2:38:24] for they
[2:38:26] are Vine now I could almost jump up here
[2:38:31] so you understand this is you also
[2:38:33] because he said I also pray for them who
[2:38:36] believes on their word let's just keep
[2:38:38] following
[2:38:39] he says
[2:38:41] and all mine are thine and thine are
[2:38:45] mine and I am glorified
[2:38:48] in them
[2:38:51] how do you know he's amongst you is he
[2:38:54] being glorified in you
[2:39:00] and now I am no more in the world
[2:39:04] but these are in the world
[2:39:06] and I come to thee Holy Father
[2:39:10] keep
[2:39:11] through thine own name
[2:39:15] Those whom thou hath given me
[2:39:21] that they may be one as We Are One
[2:39:28] how do you know God's in our midst if we
[2:39:31] are becoming one
[2:39:33] as he is one
[2:39:37] are we becoming him
[2:39:40] are we becoming the word
[2:39:43] is there a transformation
[2:39:45] taking inside of you the power to
[2:39:49] transform it's not judged by any
[2:39:52] external thing
[2:39:55] you know that he's in our midst because
[2:39:58] he's fulfilling what that he promised we
[2:40:03] would be
[2:40:04] so we're not looking back we're reading
[2:40:07] this morning what he said we would be
[2:40:10] now is he doing that
[2:40:14] is he bringing us to what he would be if
[2:40:19] he's bringing us to what we're going to
[2:40:21] be then we know he's with us because
[2:40:23] that's what he does
[2:40:30] but they may be one as we are one well I
[2:40:33] was with them in the world I kept them
[2:40:36] in thy name
[2:40:38] those thou hath given me I have kept
[2:40:41] none of them is lost
[2:40:43] but the Son of Perdition that the
[2:40:46] scriptures might be fulfilled
[2:40:52] he was the Fulfillment of scripture you
[2:40:55] are the Fulfillment of scripture
[2:41:00] and now I come to thee and these things
[2:41:03] I speak in the world
[2:41:06] what
[2:41:08] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[2:41:15] themselves
[2:41:24] it's wonderful
[2:41:26] that this joy that he had might be
[2:41:28] fulfilled in us do you say well I don't
[2:41:30] have that that's what you're going to be
[2:41:32] don't look back
[2:41:36] look at where he's taking you
[2:41:41] look at where you're going
[2:41:43] they don't know where they're going we
[2:41:46] know where we're going
[2:41:49] we're going to an invisible Union we're
[2:41:51] going to one
[2:41:53] we're going to where what He Is We Are
[2:41:59] we're going to the manifestation of the
[2:42:01] word he's taking us someplace it's where
[2:42:04] we're going it's not whether we arrived
[2:42:07] right as we understand
[2:42:10] that he's taking us to Perfection he's
[2:42:14] taking us to Oneness he's taking it so
[2:42:17] if he's taking us to the Fulfillment of
[2:42:19] the word then he's identified in our
[2:42:22] midst and Among Us
[2:42:24] amen that's how you identify whether
[2:42:26] he's among you or not is whether these
[2:42:29] things that he asked for are coming to
[2:42:32] pass
[2:42:33] let's just keep reading
[2:42:38] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[2:42:40] themselves that's a promise to me
[2:42:44] I have given them Thy word and Thy Word
[2:42:50] and the world hath hated them
[2:42:53] because they are not of the world even
[2:42:57] as I am not of the world
[2:43:00] I pray not
[2:43:02] thou shouldest take them out of the
[2:43:05] world but thou shall keep them from the
[2:43:10] evil
[2:43:15] is God keeping you from the evil
[2:43:19] I have a battle with it
[2:43:21] it's a promise
[2:43:23] fight for it
[2:43:26] fight for the promises of God the
[2:43:29] battles in your mind take the weapon of
[2:43:32] the word you understand what I'm saying
[2:43:34] this morning church you don't measure it
[2:43:36] by any other thing but by the word of
[2:43:39] God is the word of God what he spoke
[2:43:43] that would be of a bride is he taking
[2:43:46] you there I say yes
[2:43:51] I say yes
[2:43:54] he's taking me to that perfect union
[2:43:57] he's taking me there are you there I
[2:43:59] don't care whether I'm there I'm not
[2:44:02] looking back to what I was I'm looking
[2:44:04] to what he promised I would be
[2:44:07] that there would be an invisible Union
[2:44:09] and as he was so are we in this world
[2:44:16] I believe it with all my heart that's
[2:44:19] how you tell if he's in our midst
[2:44:22] he keeps going
[2:44:28] they are not of the world even him as
[2:44:31] nighth not of the world sanctify them
[2:44:34] through thy truth Thy word is truth
[2:44:41] are you Sanctified by the spirit
[2:44:45] if it's the word
[2:44:48] are you Sanctified by the spirit without
[2:44:51] the word
[2:44:52] no way
[2:44:54] you're not
[2:44:59] everybody wants spirit
[2:45:03] but they don't want word
[2:45:08] but the word can't change
[2:45:11] the word is stuck with its identity
[2:45:14] because it's eternal the word is what
[2:45:17] always was and always will be
[2:45:21] he's bringing you back to Eternity
[2:45:25] don't be sidetracked
[2:45:28] then he goes on he says
[2:45:32] as thou hath sent me to the world even
[2:45:36] so I have also sent them into the world
[2:45:39] and for their sake I Sanctified myself
[2:45:46] for what that they also might be
[2:45:51] Sanctified through the truth
[2:45:56] that you might also be sanctified
[2:45:59] neither pray for our for these alone
[2:46:03] but for them also which Shall Believe on
[2:46:06] me through their word
[2:46:08] Hallelujah every promise is right here
[2:46:11] for me
[2:46:13] that they may also be one
[2:46:16] that
[2:46:20] they all may be one all those everybody
[2:46:24] even those that believed on his word
[2:46:26] that they all may be one as thou father
[2:46:30] are in me and I envy
[2:46:34] that
[2:46:36] they also may be one in US
[2:46:40] that the world may believe that thou
[2:46:45] hath sent me
[2:46:49] every that
[2:46:52] is where you're going
[2:46:54] every that is where he's taking you
[2:46:58] every that is the work that he's doing
[2:47:01] in this day
[2:47:03] the seed had to go into the ground it
[2:47:06] had to come up now what he prayed for
[2:47:09] and what he died for is now starting to
[2:47:13] manifest in a bride and she's becoming
[2:47:16] the word
[2:47:17] She's Not Looking Back
[2:47:20] she's looking to what that he said he
[2:47:23] would accomplish and they know that
[2:47:26] God's in their midst because the truth
[2:47:29] is taking them there
[2:47:35] I believe this is where the message is
[2:47:37] taking us
[2:47:44] they may be one in us that the world may
[2:47:47] know and the glory
[2:47:50] which thou
[2:47:53] gavest me
[2:47:54] I have given them
[2:47:58] that
[2:48:01] they may be one even as We Are One
[2:48:08] you know God's in your midst if you're
[2:48:12] becoming one as he is one if you are
[2:48:15] becoming one and Legend how do we know
[2:48:17] God's in our midst how do we identify
[2:48:21] him
[2:48:23] because he's doing
[2:48:25] what he said he would do
[2:48:31] Paul even said it I mean yeah he said
[2:48:34] leaving again those things of laying on
[2:48:37] of hands of speaking in tongues and the
[2:48:40] which we will do if God so perfect but
[2:48:44] let us move on to perfection
[2:48:47] be ye perfect as he is perfect
[2:48:52] we're the word
[2:48:55] Satan's whole program is to discredit
[2:48:58] the word
[2:48:59] but we're promised in his word so I know
[2:49:03] that God is in
[2:49:05] by midst that he's among us if he's
[2:49:09] doing what he said he would do
[2:49:14] if he's bringing people
[2:49:18] into that Union
[2:49:20] if he's giving Joy if he's doing these
[2:49:23] things which we read all these that's
[2:49:25] then I know he's there
[2:49:29] I don't judge it by anything other than
[2:49:31] the what the word
[2:49:35] you say well what happens if I'm missing
[2:49:37] one ask
[2:49:39] and it shall be given seek in you shall
[2:49:42] find knock and it shall be open
[2:49:46] invite me in and I'll come sup with you
[2:49:49] and I will give you all these Vats
[2:49:54] because that's the evening meal
[2:50:01] that they may be one even as We Are One
[2:50:05] i in them
[2:50:07] and vowed in me
[2:50:11] I am them
[2:50:14] thou in me
[2:50:16] that they may be made that
[2:50:19] that
[2:50:21] they may be made perfect in one
[2:50:25] and that
[2:50:27] the world may know that
[2:50:30] thou hath sent me and hath loved them as
[2:50:35] thou hath loved me
[2:50:41] is he accomplishing that
[2:50:44] I say yes
[2:50:48] I say yes
[2:50:50] this is what I see in you
[2:50:53] this is what I see in the body loving
[2:50:56] one another
[2:50:57] becoming one with the word becoming one
[2:51:01] together I see him in you
[2:51:03] I hear Spirit In You
[2:51:06] I see a real Church
[2:51:09] that's interested in the real word
[2:51:12] that wants him to identify them himself
[2:51:16] in them
[2:51:19] but that's how I know God
[2:51:21] in his midst not a wind blowing through
[2:51:24] now and then
[2:51:27] not a response to music
[2:51:29] not a response to a style of preaching
[2:51:37] but my sheep
[2:51:39] hear my voice
[2:51:43] and another they won't follow
[2:51:46] don't condemn yourself because of the
[2:51:50] battle of your flesh
[2:51:51] you have a promise of Deliverance
[2:51:55] you have a promise of Victory take that
[2:51:59] word and take that word and say father
[2:52:02] let this word live in me I take your
[2:52:06] word it's my promise I will be free from
[2:52:09] this slave I'll be free from the lust of
[2:52:12] the flesh I'll be free from the pride of
[2:52:14] life I'll be free from the lust of the
[2:52:16] eye amen the word of God came to set us
[2:52:19] free
[2:52:22] the truth sets us free
[2:52:26] give me my identity back
[2:52:28] quit robbing my identity my identity is
[2:52:32] I'm one with the word and the word lives
[2:52:35] in me and as he is so am I in this world
[2:52:42] that's what we're about
[2:52:47] I don't care if there's
[2:52:49] if you want to run praise God run jump
[2:52:52] don't jump no higher than you're living
[2:52:58] but until these that's
[2:53:04] are happening
[2:53:07] this is the identity
[2:53:10] of God moving in our midst
[2:53:14] I would love to tell you something else
[2:53:19] but I can't
[2:53:26] I'm imprisoned
[2:53:29] to this message
[2:53:34] I tried to disprove it when I first
[2:53:36] heard it every way in the book
[2:53:43] every way you could think of
[2:53:46] I tried to disprove him
[2:53:51] I'd listen for a little bit and it'd
[2:53:53] just tear me to pieces and I'd fight it
[2:53:56] and I'd fight it and I'd fight it it
[2:53:58] didn't say no it can't be
[2:54:01] because I thought I knew God real well
[2:54:04] until I heard good morning friends and I
[2:54:07] heard him thought to be and I knew I
[2:54:09] didn't know God the way he knew God
[2:54:13] and I thought oh my am I lost
[2:54:17] because I heard Peyton ISM versus
[2:54:19] Christianity
[2:54:21] and I thought I'm a pagan this man said
[2:54:24] I'm a pagan
[2:54:28] but I knew he knew what he was talking
[2:54:30] about it was a terrible battle and I
[2:54:33] wondered if I'm lost I wonder if I was
[2:54:35] going to hell and then I heard when love
[2:54:37] projects
[2:54:39] and I thought oh God this is just your
[2:54:41] love for me because I was wrong
[2:54:44] I was going the wrong way I had wrong
[2:54:46] doctrines I had wrong thinking I had the
[2:54:49] wrong approach you say do you have it
[2:54:51] right now no I'm not perfect but I know
[2:54:54] I'm moving to Perfection because it's
[2:54:57] the promise of his word and that's where
[2:55:00] the word is taking that's where we're
[2:55:03] going
[2:55:04] we're not going back to Pentecost
[2:55:09] he didn't say back to Pentecost he said
[2:55:12] back to the word Back to Eden
[2:55:19] don't let somebody Sidetrack you
[2:55:22] and say Lo he is here
[2:55:24] and though he's there
[2:55:26] oh he's in this movement he's in that
[2:55:30] movement
[2:55:36] I remember somebody saying where are all
[2:55:38] the Miracles where are all the Miracles
[2:55:40] where are all the gifts
[2:55:45] that's all where are all the Miracles
[2:55:47] where are all the gifts where's all the
[2:55:50] excitement where's all the worship
[2:55:56] it better be in your heart
[2:55:59] because if you're just getting into a
[2:56:01] building you might as well go to a bar
[2:56:07] that's what they do they play music and
[2:56:09] they all get in the spirit
[2:56:15] that's not what it is
[2:56:18] it's you know
[2:56:21] him not by a picture
[2:56:23] but you know him by what he's changing
[2:56:26] you into
[2:56:27] you know him by where he's taking him
[2:56:30] you know him because you know he's
[2:56:33] perfecting you he's perfecting your
[2:56:35] heart he's perfecting your mind he's
[2:56:38] molding you into an image of himself you
[2:56:42] know he where he's taking you because
[2:56:44] he's taking you into the Fulfillment and
[2:56:47] the protection of the word
[2:56:50] you know he's amongst you
[2:56:53] when he's doing what he said he would do
[2:57:00] and we'll finish
[2:57:06] father
[2:57:07] I will that they also whom thou hath
[2:57:11] given me
[2:57:12] be with me where I am
[2:57:16] that they may behold my glory
[2:57:20] which thou have given me

[2:57:27] of the world

[2:57:32] the world
[2:57:34] hath not known me
[2:57:36] but I have known thee and these have

[2:57:42] and I have declared unto them thy name
[2:57:48] and will to glare it
[2:57:50] that the love
[2:57:53] wherein thou have loved me may be in
[2:57:57] them and I
