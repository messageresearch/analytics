[49:57] fellowship with for what Fellowship hath
[49:59] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[50:01] what communion hath light with darkness
[50:04] and
[50:05] what Concord hath Christ with bow or
[50:08] what part hath he that believeth with an
[50:11] Infidel and what agreement hath the
[50:13] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[50:15] Temple of the Living God as God hath
[50:17] said I dwell in them and walk in them
[50:20] and I will be their God and they will be
[50:21] my people wherefore come out from among
[50:24] them from amongst them be separate
[50:27] sayith the Lord and touch not the
[50:29] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[50:31] I will be the father unto you and you
[50:33] shall be my sons and daughters sayeth
[50:36] the Lord Almighty God bless you as you'd
[50:39] be
[50:41] seated we're going to fellowship with on
[50:44] you on a thought of separated for a
[50:48] cause and just as before we enter into
[50:51] that I know that some time ago when we
[50:53] were here we shared with you that uh you
[50:56] know they we had gone through it towards
[50:59] the end of the year a time where we had
[51:02] a bout of sickness come against us um we
[51:05] we genuinely sincerely didn't know how
[51:10] uh severe it would be in our own
[51:12] assessment it was possibly terminal um
[51:16] and so we sought the best treatment that
[51:18] we could I think anybody when you're
[51:20] when you're sick and something gets your
[51:22] attention you seek the best treatment
[51:24] that you can and uh that ended up maybe
[51:28] even raising more questions than what
[51:30] our concerns were you know the medicine
[51:32] and and what they were interested in
[51:34] they saw some growths on our lung uh I
[51:37] think they call them uh pulps or
[51:40] something like that they they asked for
[51:41] us to get more extensive scanning um and
[51:45] you know it seemed to take up a a
[51:47] contrast which made them even more
[51:49] concerned they wanted to do blood work
[51:51] to determine if I'm prone uh for things
[51:54] being cancer and you know it raised a
[51:57] lot of questions at the time you know as
[51:59] I testified uh we know what the verdict
[52:02] is we know what the the diagnosis is by
[52:04] his stripes we're healed and the the
[52:08] thing that you recognize is in the way
[52:10] of man in the way of science it's always
[52:12] going to raise more questions it's
[52:14] always going to raise more doubt and it
[52:16] that was there present um we did
[52:19] continue to do what they've asked us to
[52:21] do and and on the last time they they
[52:23] came in for a scan I think it's the
[52:25] third or fourth one the thing that they
[52:27] were concerned about was completely gone
[52:30] and it it's just you know we give God
[52:33] the glory for that because we know what
[52:35] could have been it could have been a
[52:37] diagnosis of of cancer it and it very
[52:40] well may have been a a foreign life that
[52:43] was there a demon life but God in his
[52:45] grace it's gone and you have a choice
[52:48] anytime you're you're faced in a
[52:50] position of that you're going to have a
[52:52] choice to believe God that that is a
[52:54] that is God's grace present in your life
[52:56] and there's always going to be an
[52:57] explanation or an understanding or
[52:59] something to allow you to dismiss the
[53:01] grace of God in your life and and
[53:03] explain it away but we're people of
[53:05] faith we don't just we we know that we
[53:08] have not made ourselves but he hath made
[53:10] us that that God is the one who's in
[53:13] control and our testimony of our lips is
[53:16] always going to be to God and to his
[53:17] glory you know it man you know that
[53:21] whatever it was they explain it away
[53:23] well that's gone now the the infection
[53:24] must have gone away but we want to thank
[53:27] the Lord for what he what he's done and
[53:29] for the for the testimony that he that
[53:32] he's
[53:34] given so the fellowship that I want to
[53:37] have is going to be out of God calls for
[53:39] total separation from unbelief and if
[53:42] you just hold it before you separated
[53:45] for a
[53:46] cause if we look from the in the very
[53:48] beginning in the Book of Genesis you
[53:50] know we would read in chapter one verses
[53:52] 1-4 in the beginning God created the
[53:54] heavens and the Earth and the Earth was
[53:56] without form and void and the Darkness
[53:59] was upon the face of the deep and the
[54:01] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[54:03] waters and God said let there be light
[54:05] and there was light and God saw the
[54:07] light that it was good and God divided
[54:09] the light from the darkness so the very
[54:11] principle from the very beginning that I
[54:14] want you to see is that by by separating
[54:17] by being called out there's always going
[54:18] to be an
[54:20] identification of what is true what is
[54:22] light and it always is going to be in
[54:25] conflict with
[54:27] something else so you have light being
[54:30] separated from the darkness from the
[54:31] very beginning and if it had not been
[54:33] for the separation you would have never
[54:35] not you would have never known what
[54:37] light was um it's hard for us to
[54:40] understand that it's just it's a basic
[54:42] understanding I I was with Preston one
[54:45] time I believe it was Preston he says in
[54:46] the beginning God created the darkness
[54:49] and then he said let there be light I
[54:51] said well you know what he understood
[54:53] that there had to be this pre-existence
[54:56] of the darkness it wasn't even made
[54:58] manifested yet because it hadn't been
[55:00] separated but by the declaring of the
[55:02] light Darkness was made known and we
[55:05] know that Darkness has no place with
[55:08] light there's got to be a separation and
[55:11] anytime there is a light in your life
[55:13] there's going to be something whether
[55:15] it's doubt whatever it is it's got to
[55:17] make itself known by
[55:20] contrast just be just be expecting of it
[55:23] because it's going to be
[55:25] there now
[55:26] now as we read you're a chosen
[55:29] generation a royal priesthood a a holy
[55:32] nation A peculiar people to show forth
[55:35] the Praises of him who hath called you
[55:37] out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[55:40] so you're the very light you're the the
[55:43] vehicle you're the the the way that God
[55:45] even in this day is still declaring let
[55:48] there be light is through a people who's
[55:50] peculiar now the the one thing that
[55:52] you'll notice God calls you peculiar
[55:56] he says you're set aside he says you're
[55:59] you're you're mine you're called out
[56:00] you're elected I've ordained you for a
[56:02] purpose but there's always going to be
[56:04] another voice that says no you're just
[56:07] like the rest of them there's nothing
[56:09] different about you there's nothing
[56:10] special about you um you can just do
[56:14] what everybody else does and get away
[56:15] with it no you can't that's right you
[56:17] can't you can't put your face out there
[56:20] and and act the way that everybody else
[56:22] acts and get away with it there's going
[56:24] to be a consequence for you that the
[56:27] world doesn't have I'll tell you one of
[56:30] them you can't eat the junk and the
[56:33] garbage of this world without getting
[56:34] sick they can do it they won't get sick
[56:38] they're
[56:39] buzzards matter of fact they'll just the
[56:42] more sharan that the more garbage they
[56:44] eat the more they they want it you know
[56:47] I want more followers I want you know
[56:49] whatever it is any any uh any worldly
[56:53] perverted lust right is
[56:57] quenchable all right so you take
[56:59] anything whether it's money
[57:01] popularity you're never going to be the
[57:03] best athlete and then when you're out of
[57:05] your Prime you're going to be upset
[57:06] right but your ego it never died I mean
[57:09] look around I it doesn't matter what it
[57:12] is if you build yourself on a on a on a
[57:14] sinking sand you're going to find that
[57:16] you've you've put something a confidence
[57:18] in something a trust in something that
[57:21] is not going to withstand the test of
[57:23] time and you're going to pay the
[57:24] consequences for
[57:27] having
[57:30] invested and having built on something
[57:32] that isn't going to
[57:34] last it's very temporal uh the last
[57:37] thing I we were here we're trying to
[57:40] express wisdom is to know the end of the
[57:42] matter if you could understand by
[57:45] Revelation the end of the matter then
[57:47] you would trust that God could order
[57:49] your footsteps to to to to avoid the
[57:53] consequences just after after a Godly
[57:56] wisdom you know Godly wisdom is the
[58:00] beginning of the fear of God right it's
[58:03] it's not a it's not a bondage it's not a
[58:06] fear that that the world would try to
[58:08] put on us you know how you're going to
[58:09] pay your bills or you know there's a lot
[58:12] of things that orchestrate man's
[58:14] footsteps whether it be the law of the
[58:15] land or just self-preservation that's
[58:18] done out of fear and it it may be gives
[58:20] them a a moderation you know don't drink
[58:22] and drive they they'll put the
[58:24] Billboards up you know if you do the
[58:27] crime do the time right but we're not
[58:32] doing that as Christians under a law of
[58:36] fear we're doing it after the law of an
[58:39] inward man right we we've understood
[58:42] that Christ has come he's changed our
[58:45] desires the passions of our lives and
[58:47] we're now focused with a holy light upon
[58:50] the things of God but while you're under
[58:53] the
[58:54] tutor if you if you have to obey the law
[58:57] because you you only understand the law
[58:59] he you haven't been born again you
[59:00] haven't be been regenerated then the law
[59:03] should give you at least an
[59:04] understanding of the consequences of sin
[59:07] and I would hope that you'd be wise
[59:09] enough to avoid the
[59:12] transgressions right because you you'll
[59:15] you know God's not mocked you there's
[59:17] there's things that you deal with and
[59:19] you're you know Satan will have an
[59:21] opportunity to come and bring things
[59:23] back to your
[59:24] remembrance and if would be better off
[59:26] that there were never memories to be
[59:28] there now I I got to tell you why Satan
[59:31] has an opportunity to do that and and
[59:33] bring a thought into your memor you've
[59:35] got the opportunity to punch them in the
[59:37] mouth too all right because it's it's
[59:40] greater is the grace of God than all the
[59:43] things that you're bringing up the only
[59:45] thing you're doing is serving the
[59:47] testify of the grace and the Deliverance
[59:49] of my God if you want to start bringing
[59:51] up my past I'm just going to start
[59:53] telling you about how great the
[59:55] Deliverance of my God God was that's
[59:57] right I such as one was that but now
[1:00:00] I've been changed my I I would have
[1:00:02] something to tell you the identity I
[1:00:05] have now that what I've been called out
[1:00:07] and separated from I'm now a Son of God
[1:00:11] declaring the life of God wherein before
[1:00:13] I could only share Darkness the only
[1:00:16] thing that I could ever do that I
[1:00:18] recognize even in my best efforts the
[1:00:20] fallacy of man would be something
[1:00:23] temporal I mean I might build the best
[1:00:25] host hospital and might be able to
[1:00:27] provide the best care I may even be the
[1:00:29] best Technical College and I could
[1:00:31] impart wisdom to you all this world has
[1:00:34] to offer is temporal but as a Son of God
[1:00:36] with the word of God's on your lip you
[1:00:38] can be life to others it's the greatest
[1:00:41] privilege you ever could have is to
[1:00:43] stand in this day knowing that you have
[1:00:45] God's provided place of refuge and we
[1:00:48] don't have anything new to say we simply
[1:00:50] can say what God's already mouthed in
[1:00:53] this day and it's going to call out out
[1:00:56] it's going to dress a bride and it's
[1:00:58] going to make us reflect the very image
[1:01:00] that he
[1:01:02] desires all by his word You're simply
[1:01:05] carrier of the word is a Son of God it's
[1:01:09] progyny it's it's the genos of God it
[1:01:13] it's it's the very law of God being
[1:01:15] lived out amen so in
[1:01:20] separation God is pleased by that now
[1:01:23] it's all for a cause it's all for a
[1:01:24] purpose in Ezekiel 2 226 it says her
[1:01:27] priests have violated my law and have
[1:01:30] profaned my holy things they have put no
[1:01:32] difference between the holy and the
[1:01:34] profane neither have they showed
[1:01:36] difference between the unclean and the
[1:01:38] clean and have hid their eyes from the
[1:01:40] sabbaths and I'm profaned among them
[1:01:43] right you could go through all through
[1:01:45] the the Bible the unjust measures an
[1:01:48] Abomination to God don't call those
[1:01:50] things which are clean unclean there's
[1:01:52] got to be a separation there's got to be
[1:01:54] something that calls out and we're not
[1:01:56] called to be a lukewarm believer I would
[1:01:59] i' would rather you be hot or cold but
[1:02:01] because you're lukewarm I'll SPO you out
[1:02:03] of my mouth we don't want to be at we
[1:02:05] don't want a semblance of the world and
[1:02:07] if you take the world and the smut of
[1:02:09] the world and you bring it onto a
[1:02:11] Christian testimony you're declaring
[1:02:13] those things which are unclean to be
[1:02:15] have no difference than that which is
[1:02:19] clean if you're deceiving yourself into
[1:02:22] thinking that you can partake in the
[1:02:23] things of the world and it not be an
[1:02:26] Abomination to God and carry a
[1:02:30] testimony that is not what God's called
[1:02:32] us to in this day I thank God that this
[1:02:35] message sets us apart that this message
[1:02:39] has a Holiness standard that this
[1:02:41] message has a righteousness that comes
[1:02:43] with it that it has a you know I could
[1:02:45] try to teach you after the law the the
[1:02:48] book in I believe it's in G Galatians it
[1:02:51] talks about how the Gentiles will do
[1:02:53] things after the heart those things
[1:02:55] which were written in the the law
[1:02:56] they're they you couldn't tell them by
[1:02:59] the law what to do but they're doing it
[1:03:01] after the nature of the law I could try
[1:03:03] to tell I I was in summer school one
[1:03:05] time and and it was after my conversion
[1:03:07] I was a real young believer and I went
[1:03:09] up to this per girl and I said you know
[1:03:11] what nowaday young ladies don't even
[1:03:13] know what the word modesty means and she
[1:03:16] in all seriousness looked at me and she
[1:03:18] says what's
[1:03:20] modesty now if you caught the essence of
[1:03:22] modesty it wouldn't even be a dress
[1:03:24] code it's a nature it's a spirit it's an
[1:03:28] atmosphere and and it's not just dress
[1:03:31] it's attitude it's it's conduct it's you
[1:03:36] know Brothers sobriety you know
[1:03:40] seriousness reverent you know we we
[1:03:43] don't just make I you know I can be an
[1:03:45] awful cut up you may not even know when
[1:03:47] I'm serious sometimes or being sincere
[1:03:48] and and Lord forgive me for that but we
[1:03:50] should have a the ability for people to
[1:03:54] understand and respect when we're
[1:03:56] serious right where that can change the
[1:03:58] atmosphere and take control and I've
[1:04:00] seen God do it with just the smallest
[1:04:02] thing and he's faithful right you could
[1:04:04] just you could say one word and it and
[1:04:07] everybody knows you know what that was
[1:04:09] wrong we shouldn't do that and they're
[1:04:11] ashamed at their conduct because the
[1:04:13] atmosphere that you carry with you can
[1:04:16] still bring
[1:04:17] conviction right and so that's the
[1:04:19] spirit that you can't do that after the
[1:04:21] letter of the law you don't sit there
[1:04:23] and you educate someone into it so we
[1:04:25] want to to do things by revelation we
[1:04:27] want to do it by an outward inward heart
[1:04:29] being lived out but the law will still
[1:04:32] make you know you're not living
[1:04:35] right in the identified Masterpiece in
[1:04:38] paragraph 58 this is
[1:04:41] 64205 to think that man was made in the
[1:04:43] image of his creator and was given a
[1:04:45] wall to stand behind that was the word
[1:04:48] could never fall fell that's that the
[1:04:52] Christian hope is this his shield his
[1:04:55] armor his Rock today is stay behind the
[1:04:59] word every believer now you must never
[1:05:01] get from behind that when you do you'll
[1:05:04] open the door to the enemy when you say
[1:05:06] oh well you can do a little of this and
[1:05:09] you can do a little of that God want God
[1:05:11] wants you to separate yourself from
[1:05:14] everything that's called sin completely
[1:05:18] set aside for him and he alone he has a
[1:05:22] purpose in your life each individual
[1:05:26] and I want you to think about that each
[1:05:30] individual so if you're called out you
[1:05:34] know you know Israel was called out as a
[1:05:37] nation okay but you're called out as an
[1:05:41] individual and and I mean that very
[1:05:43] specifically even though you're part of
[1:05:44] a church body here you're a
[1:05:47] member you you have a calling as an
[1:05:50] individual that God will move on you
[1:05:53] differently than everybody else
[1:05:56] else and if you are full you compare
[1:05:59] yourselves one to another and you say
[1:06:02] well this brother or this sister does it
[1:06:04] I can do it
[1:06:06] too and I'm not saying it's bad what I'm
[1:06:09] just saying you are called out
[1:06:13] individually okay you you have to
[1:06:16] realize the Holy Spirit leading you is
[1:06:20] because your path and the way you're
[1:06:23] going is to declare forth his Glory
[1:06:26] because he has a purpose for you as an
[1:06:33] individual each individual that no one
[1:06:36] else on the face of the Earth can take
[1:06:38] your place God has got something for you
[1:06:42] you're made like
[1:06:44] that I'm thankful for that I you know
[1:06:48] we're all making a different
[1:06:50] sound for his glory we can't all make
[1:06:53] the same sound
[1:06:55] for a purpose God is Sovereign in his
[1:06:58] work he even things different we
[1:07:01] different one from another now I'm going
[1:07:03] to jump down to paragraph 63 this is you
[1:07:06] know when son's a principle of God and
[1:07:08] it's
[1:07:09] Eternal it doesn't change right so when
[1:07:13] you when you can catch something and a
[1:07:15] principle of something it's you you'll
[1:07:18] start to see it
[1:07:20] everywhere right because you're an
[1:07:22] individual to God and God has a purpose
[1:07:25] for you you he made you thus you say why
[1:07:27] did he do it he's Sovereign he's got a
[1:07:30] reason for it being that way but we find
[1:07:32] out that we're all guarded by the word
[1:07:35] in heaven we look at the celestial
[1:07:37] bodies the Bible says that even one of
[1:07:39] the Stars different from the other
[1:07:40] there's Cyrus the different ones the
[1:07:42] Mars Jupiter all the different ones the
[1:07:44] different ones from the other the sun's
[1:07:46] different from the Moon and the moon
[1:07:49] from the stars and there's the angels
[1:07:51] and there's the seraphim the cherubims
[1:07:53] the angels are great angels in degrees
[1:07:55] so there's degrees and even in the new
[1:07:57] world to come the kings of the earth
[1:07:59] bring the honor into the city ain't that
[1:08:02] something there's always going to be a
[1:08:04] hierarchy there's always going to be a
[1:08:06] way that God does things and your your
[1:08:08] place is beautiful David even said I'd
[1:08:11] rather be a door man in the house of God
[1:08:13] right there's no every part is essential
[1:08:17] you know Solomon entering the glory of
[1:08:19] his Temple I I would I would have loved
[1:08:22] to been there there no procession on the
[1:08:25] face of the Earth has ever been like
[1:08:27] that I mean you talk about holy you talk
[1:08:30] about something that you know religion
[1:08:34] in their symbolisms and all these great
[1:08:37] religions around the world and all what
[1:08:39] they tried to do in Grandeur nothing was
[1:08:41] like
[1:08:42] that and I could imagine that at all
[1:08:46] Solomon in his wisdom putting everything
[1:08:48] in place he took pleasure and even the
[1:08:50] smallest part being done
[1:08:52] properly there was a there was an order
[1:08:54] to it and we're always going to be that
[1:08:57] way because God is not a Sears and robot
[1:08:59] carony house he's got a variety he makes
[1:09:03] one one way and another another but we
[1:09:06] serve him in the way that God made us
[1:09:08] and be glad and stay behind the word and
[1:09:12] that's God's way God did
[1:09:15] it the emphasis here is is out of your
[1:09:18] place you're not behind the word that's
[1:09:21] right okay you may not realize it you
[1:09:24] may think everything as well but if
[1:09:26] you're not in your place you're you're
[1:09:28] you're allowing the Devil to have an
[1:09:30] area to come in and many fall because
[1:09:33] they've taking themselves out of their
[1:09:35] position they think that they're to be
[1:09:39] something and they're not made that
[1:09:43] way so you just fortify yourself behind
[1:09:47] God's word
[1:09:50] amen now I looked up what series and
[1:09:54] does anybody know it a Harmony
[1:09:57] houses Sears and robu Harmony House
[1:10:00] maybe someone studied fashion in
[1:10:02] college I'm not
[1:10:15] sure so thanks to the internet you can
[1:10:18] actually look up what a serir Harmony
[1:10:22] House was it was a fashion
[1:10:25] or you know thing that ran they ran it
[1:10:28] from 1940 to
[1:10:30] 1968 and this is what they would say in
[1:10:32] 1940 sir introduced the Harmony House
[1:10:34] brand as an interior decorating scheme
[1:10:37] that used four basic colors and could
[1:10:39] coordinate with each
[1:10:42] other customers were encouraged to use a
[1:10:45] color wheel that was supplied in the
[1:10:47] catalog and coordinate colors
[1:10:49] harmonizing colors had long been a
[1:10:51] problem for the company for example Rose
[1:10:53] draperies and it it goes was on and it
[1:10:56] just struck me you know man has this
[1:11:00] desire for things to be in
[1:11:02] harmony you know even to the point that
[1:11:04] they'll pull people out of the place
[1:11:06] that they're supposed to be because they
[1:11:07] just don't want the rub they would
[1:11:10] rather it just be copesthetic and match
[1:11:15] right you know what iron sharpeneth iron
[1:11:18] but nobody wants to bear with their
[1:11:20] brother when they're just a little
[1:11:23] awkward you know there's people who just
[1:11:25] get invited around because they don't
[1:11:26] quite fit
[1:11:28] in Harmony
[1:11:31] House you
[1:11:33] know you just don't
[1:11:41] match you're not fortifying yourself in
[1:11:43] the word of
[1:11:45] God every part is
[1:11:48] needful you know it it and even the less
[1:11:51] the parts you deem less needful are even
[1:11:54] more needful than you think
[1:11:55] they might just help keep the right
[1:11:57] atmosphere around right amen so be
[1:12:01] mindful right it's not what it's all for
[1:12:04] his good pleasure and this is a thing
[1:12:06] that that's upon my heart we should
[1:12:08] never esteem this is God's good pleasure
[1:12:11] this is God's order this is people that
[1:12:14] God's
[1:12:16] fashioned you may not like it but are
[1:12:19] you despising a work of God are you
[1:12:23] despising something that God's taking
[1:12:25] pleasure in you know people are so
[1:12:28] fickle you know they they get so set up
[1:12:30] in their preferences and and they even
[1:12:32] you know humans are just really bad at
[1:12:35] it we we're just predisposed to
[1:12:37] determination you know we we we judge
[1:12:39] people's capabilities and their
[1:12:41] inabilities and and everything just
[1:12:43] based off our own perception but as
[1:12:47] Christians judged by the
[1:12:50] blood you know what you want to see is
[1:12:53] Christ Living out
[1:12:55] I I want to see Christ Living in my
[1:12:57] brother I want to see Christ Living in
[1:12:59] my sister I want to be in fellowship if
[1:13:01] we have if we're walking in the light
[1:13:03] then we have Fellowship one with another
[1:13:05] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:13:07] us from all
[1:13:09] unrighteousness amen we're not we're not
[1:13:12] here to uh just esteem the things of man
[1:13:16] as carnal man does things but we've been
[1:13:19] given the eyesight of God to look at
[1:13:21] ourselves as the workmanship of his
[1:13:23] image
[1:13:26] and never belittle a work of God and
[1:13:29] we're all Made In His Image that's every
[1:13:31] person on the face of this Earth every
[1:13:33] human being is made in the image of God
[1:13:36] you'd be little no
[1:13:39] man you're profaning to to do that as a
[1:13:43] Christian and I and I trust I'm you know
[1:13:46] I'm going this way for a reason I would
[1:13:48] trust that no one naming themselves as a
[1:13:50] Christian
[1:13:52] belittles anyone
[1:13:56] I mean you you you find um it shouldn't
[1:14:00] be named amongst
[1:14:03] us and if there's circles where that
[1:14:06] that where that's done shame on
[1:14:09] you you you you you may be lacking more
[1:14:12] than you realize there's going to be
[1:14:14] someone who comes up on that day and
[1:14:16] realizes they didn't have what they
[1:14:23] thought but the blood of Christ is the
[1:14:26] same price that paid for us
[1:14:30] all to think that man was made in the
[1:14:32] image of his creator and was given a
[1:14:34] wall to stand behind he could never fail
[1:14:37] that's the Christian hope it's his
[1:14:38] shield it's his armor it's his Rock
[1:14:40] today is stay behind the word every
[1:14:43] believer
[1:14:51] amen 2 Timothy 2:4 and13
[1:14:57] so there's going to be a
[1:14:59] a things that want to keep you from
[1:15:01] being separated from being called out
[1:15:04] and one of them is to be entangled and I
[1:15:07] find that just manifested here in the
[1:15:10] scripture says no man Warth and Tangle
[1:15:13] himself with the Affairs of his this
[1:15:15] life that he may please him who hath
[1:15:17] chosen him to be a soldier and that's
[1:15:19] commonly
[1:15:20] quoted I I appreciate the scripture
[1:15:23] because it's talking about someone who
[1:15:24] strives for a Mastery they recognize
[1:15:27] that they have to be in their top
[1:15:28] condition because it their life depends
[1:15:31] on it right so there's a dedication
[1:15:34] there's a fervency there's a focus
[1:15:37] there's an understanding for the calling
[1:15:39] and we have to possess that as
[1:15:41] Christians in this day we have to
[1:15:43] recognize what the prize is that we're
[1:15:45] contending for and that if there's a
[1:15:48] prize to be contended for there's going
[1:15:50] to be a method in which you're ins
[1:15:53] snarled and that's an entangling right
[1:15:56] that was that creeper that I spoke about
[1:15:58] there's those things that while you're
[1:16:01] called to be separate they're going to
[1:16:02] try to take in creep in and take you one
[1:16:05] it wears it's almost like the boiling
[1:16:07] the Frog right you slowly turn up the
[1:16:11] water so what we want to understand is
[1:16:14] things in their
[1:16:15] infancy that it's a snare before it can
[1:16:18] intangle you you want to trim it back
[1:16:22] you want to separate it out and the best
[1:16:24] way way to do that is to have a hedge
[1:16:26] right you set parameters you you you you
[1:16:31] create a a you know pattern of good
[1:16:34] works you know if you're not in the
[1:16:36] house of God where are you I mean we can
[1:16:39] look back through the scripture and
[1:16:41] David got into trouble when he should
[1:16:42] have been out on the battlefield right
[1:16:45] if you want to in avoid being entangled
[1:16:48] or you find yourself being entangled you
[1:16:50] need to start looking for where you were
[1:16:52] supposed to be
[1:16:55] what is your position where are you
[1:16:56] supposed to be fortified at and move
[1:16:59] towards that right because God hasn't
[1:17:02] called us to be entangled and the way to
[1:17:04] move for towards that is to
[1:17:07] recognize that God has a position for
[1:17:09] you to be in right he's the husbandman
[1:17:12] he's the one who's going to tend to
[1:17:15] you amen
[1:17:26] now it's all for a purpose right so
[1:17:29] there's a separation there's a being a
[1:17:30] called out the separation I know I'm
[1:17:33] emphasizing it but there's something
[1:17:35] that the separation comes with okay he
[1:17:39] doesn't call us out to leave us desolate
[1:17:41] he didn't take the children out of
[1:17:43] Israel just leave them in the wilderness
[1:17:45] but with any separating with any being
[1:17:47] called out there's there's a there's a
[1:17:50] coming out and there's a going in
[1:17:52] too amen
[1:17:55] so Matthew
[1:17:57] 19: 3-6 the Pharisees came unto him
[1:18:00] tempting saying unto him is it lawful
[1:18:02] for a man to put away his wife for every
[1:18:04] cause Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:18:07] him them have you not read that which
[1:18:10] was made them from the beginning made
[1:18:13] them male and female and he said for
[1:18:15] this cause shall a man leave his father
[1:18:17] and mother and shall cleave to his wife
[1:18:20] and they twain shall be one flesh
[1:18:22] wherefore they are no more Twain but one
[1:18:25] flesh what wherefore God has joined
[1:18:28] together let no man put
[1:18:31] aunder there's a leaving there's a
[1:18:34] cleaving yes there's no greater type
[1:18:38] that I find in the Bible than the type
[1:18:39] of man and wife and Christ in the church
[1:18:41] is the very expression of God in the
[1:18:44] very beginning with Adam and Eve there
[1:18:46] was a Eve being in Adam being taken out
[1:18:50] just to come together and that is the
[1:18:52] very thing that's happening in our day
[1:18:54] where we were taken from the sight of
[1:18:56] Christ to Calvary the very heartbeat of
[1:18:58] God the very Life of Christ is in The
[1:19:00] Believer uniting with him in this hour
[1:19:04] and we know what he wants done with the
[1:19:07] word because we're bone of his bone and
[1:19:08] flesh of his flesh but there's always
[1:19:11] going to be a
[1:19:12] leave there's always going to be a
[1:19:15] separation there's got to be something
[1:19:17] and there's there's you know it's a it's
[1:19:19] a shame
[1:19:22] but
[1:19:23] there's you know I I really don't want
[1:19:26] to go there
[1:19:28] but you find in this day many don't
[1:19:30] leave they don't leave their tradition
[1:19:32] they don't leave their family there's
[1:19:34] not a true your people shall be my
[1:19:36] people you know there's there's there's
[1:19:38] women who who still listen to their
[1:19:40] family instead of their husband there's
[1:19:42] there's husbands who still listen to
[1:19:44] their mom and their dad instead of
[1:19:46] tending to the needs of their wife and
[1:19:48] and giving themselves for it as Christ
[1:19:49] did the church they're more interested
[1:19:51] in their
[1:19:52] family you know it it's it's not
[1:19:55] scriptural it's not what God chose to
[1:19:58] reflect himself in you you should you
[1:20:00] should cherish what God's given you you
[1:20:03] should lay yourself down for it you know
[1:20:06] it it it's and it it shouldn't be uh
[1:20:09] something you just use and you know um
[1:20:12] cook for my family and tend to my needs
[1:20:15] and and do this but there's a giving yes
[1:20:18] right there you know there there has to
[1:20:21] be the love that Christ had
[1:20:25] has to be on display and I'm thankful
[1:20:28] you know I these things I speak of I'm
[1:20:30] def I don't you know I on my side my mom
[1:20:34] my dad you know they very rarely come
[1:20:35] over and you know they're not telling
[1:20:37] Julia how to cook and you know or how to
[1:20:40] fix the house and you know Davey likes
[1:20:42] it this way and Davey likes it that way
[1:20:44] I wouldn't find pleasure in that
[1:20:46] anyways right I wanted I I want to be
[1:20:49] ministered to by my wife the way she
[1:20:52] wants to minister I I love to see that
[1:20:55] expression right there's there's got to
[1:20:58] be a perversion there for things to be
[1:21:02] done other ways okay
[1:21:06] so um leave and cleave but
[1:21:11] as the part I wanted to focus on was the
[1:21:14] cleave right
[1:21:15] but but you got to there has to be the
[1:21:17] separation first right there's got to be
[1:21:20] the leaving there's got to be the
[1:21:22] separation before you could enter into
[1:21:24] the blessing of something you have to
[1:21:26] have the separation and that's that's
[1:21:28] ultimately what my heart's driving at is
[1:21:31] God's called us to be separate there's
[1:21:33] no doubt about it our sisters you you
[1:21:36] have long hair there's a shame that that
[1:21:39] could come with that the modesty that
[1:21:40] you dress with the fact that you're not
[1:21:43] seeking attention the way other people
[1:21:44] seek attention you're an oddball right
[1:21:47] Brothers the way you manner your
[1:21:48] conversation I remember when God got a
[1:21:50] hold of my life I didn't bag my pants
[1:21:53] and my my shirt wasn't untucked I went
[1:21:55] to school I was like you know what I'm
[1:21:57] tucking in my shirt I'm I'm going to
[1:22:00] buckle up my belt I want to people to
[1:22:02] see that something was
[1:22:04] different I I I wanted to show forth the
[1:22:07] Holiness God had apprehended my life
[1:22:10] I've Been Changed did I praise
[1:22:16] God there if it's there's a separation
[1:22:21] that
[1:22:22] comes because God separat
[1:22:25] Ates God does the work I'm not talking
[1:22:28] about a manufactured separation I'm just
[1:22:30] telling you that if there's not a
[1:22:32] separation there needs to be a
[1:22:35] separation that God is a separator and
[1:22:37] he did it in the very beginning let
[1:22:39] there be life and the holy spirit's here
[1:22:41] to open your eyes it might cause a
[1:22:43] little bit of conviction but my desire
[1:22:45] is that the Holy Spirit would begin to
[1:22:47] move the light would start to come on
[1:22:49] and say you know what there's not the
[1:22:50] separation there there should be there's
[1:22:53] worldliness
[1:22:56] it there shouldn't be any worldliness it
[1:22:59] should be holy holy holy holy under the
[1:23:03] Lord God we've entered into the holiest
[1:23:06] of
[1:23:07] holies we're not in the outer
[1:23:10] chamber you know that's what the
[1:23:12] separation was you know there was the
[1:23:15] there was there was the there was the
[1:23:16] sacrifices there's the pertinence there
[1:23:18] there was things that couldn't enter
[1:23:20] into the holy of holies there was a
[1:23:22] separation and we've been invited into
[1:23:25] the holiest of holies we don't want an
[1:23:27] outer Court we don't want just an inner
[1:23:30] Court I believe the message it's
[1:23:33] true
[1:23:35] wow look at them seals they've been
[1:23:37] opened can you believe that we don't
[1:23:39] believe in any eternal hell that's kind
[1:23:40] of neat I guess you just fizzle out and
[1:23:44] you know that's cool that's a really
[1:23:45] neat truth you know and um water baptism
[1:23:49] I could School everybody on that one
[1:23:51] that's easy you know name of the Lord
[1:23:54] Jesus Christ I mean
[1:23:56] kabanda um you know the only ones I kind
[1:23:59] of have a problem with that you know
[1:24:00] they're a little harder as those Jesus
[1:24:01] only UPC people you know the
[1:24:03] charismatics are kind of interested
[1:24:06] no there's a there's a Holiness it's
[1:24:10] just born out because we have a word
[1:24:13] that's dressing a bride it's making her
[1:24:17] different it's changed her
[1:24:21] conduct I'm thankful for it it's
[1:24:23] spiritual food in due Seas season
[1:24:25] amen second Peter
[1:24:28] 1111 For unto us an entrance has been
[1:24:31] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:24:34] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
[1:24:36] Christ wherefore I will not neglect to
[1:24:40] put you always in remembrance of these
[1:24:42] things though ye know them and be
[1:24:45] established in the present
[1:24:49] truth
[1:24:50] present
[1:24:52] truth right there where are you supposed
[1:24:55] to be established at present
[1:24:59] truth we're we're not looking at a
[1:25:02] gospel gone by but there was a present
[1:25:05] truth in our day that we're to be
[1:25:07] established in it is a Malachi 4:5 it is
[1:25:10] a Revelations 10:7 it is that God sent a
[1:25:14] prophet I I love to tell people God sent
[1:25:17] a
[1:25:18] prophet I'm not ashamed of it I'm not
[1:25:21] ashamed of the picture that's not an to
[1:25:24] me that's the pillar of fire vindicating
[1:25:27] God's chosen vessel to bring a
[1:25:30] message anything could be made an idol I
[1:25:33] get that but that's we were you know in
[1:25:36] the way they call idolatry right and the
[1:25:38] way they call heresy I mean I understand
[1:25:41] there's a reproach but it's the
[1:25:44] truth God did it it was the work of his
[1:25:48] hands he chose to have the photo
[1:25:52] taken his prophet chose to publish it he
[1:25:56] chose to say the cloud he chose to say
[1:25:59] turn it this way I don't care how many
[1:26:01] people come beside it and say it was for
[1:26:03] something else it accomplished what God
[1:26:05] sent it to
[1:26:08] accomplish he's done it
[1:26:12] am and it's going to produce exactly
[1:26:15] what he wants it to
[1:26:19] produce amen
[1:26:24] as I mentioned Revelations 10:7 but I
[1:26:26] love to read it but in the days of the
[1:26:28] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:26:30] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:26:33] be finished as Heath declared to his
[1:26:35] servants the prophets
[1:26:47] amen I just want to read this it's in
[1:26:49] spiritual food and due season but now
[1:26:52] God has promised us at these last days
[1:26:54] in Malachi 4 said that Jesus Christ
[1:26:57] would come and impersonate himself in
[1:27:00] human flesh like he dead Sodom that's
[1:27:03] right and he said the world would be in
[1:27:05] a Sodom
[1:27:06] condition pardon me and said it was then
[1:27:09] the son of man would be revealed in this
[1:27:12] day see the man that come down in the
[1:27:14] form of this man come down in the form
[1:27:17] of a man which was Elohim by Abraham
[1:27:21] before this promised son came look what
[1:27:24] it was Abraham said it was God the Bible
[1:27:27] said it was three men came to him dust
[1:27:30] on their clothes travel sit down and eat
[1:27:33] like
[1:27:34] man it's hard for us to understand the
[1:27:37] humanity of that moment and that being
[1:27:40] God in flesh dust on his clothes I I
[1:27:45] didn't quite understand the contrast of
[1:27:48] that till I went to Israel and speaking
[1:27:50] with the
[1:27:51] rabbi the there is nothing that equates
[1:27:56] the ability for God and man to even be
[1:27:59] in the same
[1:28:01] place like it you just don't
[1:28:05] understand God and man in the same
[1:28:16] place that's like saying we could stand
[1:28:18] on the sun right right like they get
[1:28:22] holy they get God they get
[1:28:26] Elohim they get the
[1:28:29] Creator and your man what is man that
[1:28:33] God is mindful of him you know if God's
[1:28:37] going to do anything with man it'll de
[1:28:39] be through some distant thing but and
[1:28:44] God will use you know nature and the
[1:28:46] wind and the way like he'll meet you in
[1:28:48] his
[1:28:49] nature but God and
[1:28:52] man to dwell
[1:28:55] together it's not a concept that even
[1:28:58] Judaism I think
[1:29:00] has right but then unto us unto a
[1:29:04] gentile
[1:29:08] people what is the mystery of Jesus
[1:29:12] Christ that God and man would be
[1:29:14] reconciled you know the gospel is still
[1:29:17] simple that's right it's still simple
[1:29:20] that you a sinner that God Almighty
[1:29:25] could come to sinful flesh and His Holy
[1:29:30] Spirit by the price of Calvary can touch
[1:29:33] your
[1:29:35] life and he so loved us that he declared
[1:29:38] it in his son that he was willing to
[1:29:40] Bear the shame that he would be born in
[1:29:42] a
[1:29:43] manger that he would be tempted in all
[1:29:47] manner as we were that he would suffer
[1:29:50] that he would learn obedience by the
[1:29:52] things which he suffered
[1:29:55] and I we think that uh that seems so
[1:30:00] wonderful but it was for our sake yes it
[1:30:02] was so that we couldn't have a kinsman
[1:30:05] redeemer it was so that he could be
[1:30:07] touched by The Fellowship of our
[1:30:08] infirmities did you know even in your
[1:30:11] suffering even in your
[1:30:13] suffering if you think about it on your
[1:30:16] worst
[1:30:17] day and the and I mean that in agonizing
[1:30:22] pain if you just catch
[1:30:24] that he knows what that feels
[1:30:28] like and you think about that oh my
[1:30:32] Lord you know what this is like I I had
[1:30:36] that happen and it it it was a Solace
[1:30:39] that you can't under
[1:30:41] explain that Lord you mean you know what
[1:30:43] this feels
[1:30:45] like that even in
[1:30:47] this as distracting as it
[1:30:51] is you can connect with me
[1:30:54] what can separate you from the love of
[1:30:57] God
[1:31:03] nothing so for the purpose
[1:31:12] amen Matthew 5:11 says blessed are ye
[1:31:16] when men shall revile you and persecute
[1:31:19] you and shall say all manner of evil
[1:31:21] against you falsely for my sake it is
[1:31:25] right here's a
[1:31:27] suffering here's a
[1:31:30] persecution but it's for his
[1:31:32] sake what's the purpose in it for his
[1:31:35] glory you may not realize it but he
[1:31:40] takes
[1:31:42] a how do you say it a pleasure in it
[1:31:45] right it's for his sake it's for his
[1:31:47] good pleasure it's for his glory it's to
[1:31:50] be separated it's to be called out
[1:31:54] brother brandom says this I don't know
[1:31:57] where I just have it jotted
[1:32:00] down I shared the quote a while ago with
[1:32:03] the
[1:32:03] brothers it's better to be ready I'd
[1:32:07] rather be a sick man ready with the Lord
[1:32:11] than to be a Wellman not ready to go
[1:32:13] with the Lord but however it'll be God
[1:32:17] so willing that he that we both well and
[1:32:21] ready soul and body for forgives us our
[1:32:24] iniquities and heals of heals us of our
[1:32:27] diseases he died for a compound purpose
[1:32:31] but the things that we esteem the thing
[1:32:33] that struck me in this is what the
[1:32:37] purpose in a lot of things are is for
[1:32:38] the perfecting of our character to make
[1:32:40] us ready to that we can inherit a glory
[1:32:43] to be shared with him and that that is
[1:32:46] what we desire the train of our faith is
[1:32:48] more precious than gold it's not that we
[1:32:51] want to have I what the world thinks is
[1:32:55] a a successful Christian Life is
[1:32:57] prosperity but if God so
[1:32:59] chooses that you may look at me and
[1:33:02] reproach me or think that I'm going
[1:33:03] through something and wow the favor of
[1:33:06] God is just is has left him but maybe
[1:33:09] God is preparing my character maybe he's
[1:33:12] making we don't we shouldn't think those
[1:33:14] things we know enough in the scripture
[1:33:16] to know what God was doing with job that
[1:33:18] we don't assess the blessings of God as
[1:33:21] as some carnal things but what what is
[1:33:23] most precious and more precious than
[1:33:25] gold is the character and the content
[1:33:28] that we have that God's instilling in
[1:33:31] us and it's better to dwell in the house
[1:33:33] of mourning than in a house of Mirth
[1:33:37] right so the things that we want to be
[1:33:40] mindful of is that we're not just
[1:33:42] seeking after fraility but we we're
[1:33:45] we're conducting ourselves in a manner
[1:33:48] that is in the position behind God's
[1:33:51] word where we're being perfected amen
[1:34:00] yes now in the separating I I you know
[1:34:04] to be honest I probably didn't flow as
[1:34:06] through this in the way I thought I
[1:34:08] would but I want to take a look back at
[1:34:11] even Joseph when he was separated out
[1:34:14] from his Brethren because he was
[1:34:16] spiritual he was persecuted there was a
[1:34:18] separation you know he's if you look at
[1:34:20] even the story it was traumatic he's
[1:34:22] thrown into prison but then there's
[1:34:25] there all of those things in him coming
[1:34:26] from that place was for one purpose we
[1:34:29] see it in Genesis 19 and 20 50 19 and 20
[1:34:33] and Joseph said unto them fear not for I
[1:34:35] am in the place am I in the place of God
[1:34:38] but as for you you thought evil against
[1:34:40] me but God meant it unto good to bring
[1:34:43] to pass as it was this day to save much
[1:34:46] people
[1:34:47] alive your
[1:34:49] separation is the very salvation to
[1:34:52] other people and if you lose that
[1:34:55] resonance if you lose that God can't
[1:34:58] bless you until you're separated and
[1:35:00] neither can you be a voice of Salvation
[1:35:02] if you're not called and set
[1:35:04] apart if you're if you if you conduct
[1:35:07] yourself in such a way that you just fit
[1:35:09] in with even your nominal friends or
[1:35:11] your worldly friends and they don't see
[1:35:13] a separation then you are you are the
[1:35:16] opposite of this scripture you might as
[1:35:19] well say for this Clause I've been set
[1:35:21] to be a stumbling block before you so
[1:35:23] that on Judgment Day you can say why
[1:35:25] didn't you tell me why did you let me go
[1:35:28] in the way of folly why didn't you tell
[1:35:31] me this was wrong you
[1:35:36] knew you
[1:35:39] knew I didn't even you you know when I
[1:35:42] said
[1:35:43] modesty there's people who don't even
[1:35:45] know that it's
[1:35:49] wrong they
[1:35:51] don't this world's so
[1:35:54] Godless so Godless you're the very
[1:35:58] you're the very Life of Christ the light
[1:36:00] of God but if the salts loost lost its
[1:36:03] Sabor what good is it
[1:36:05] for you know we you know I I just could
[1:36:09] to be faithful to say it you know if you
[1:36:11] want to be a witness to your
[1:36:14] family show them what means most to
[1:36:20] you okay and you
[1:36:25] are your actions speak louder than your
[1:36:29] words you are showing what so let me put
[1:36:32] it this
[1:36:40] way if you want your family to be
[1:36:43] saved
[1:36:46] right you get them into God's provided
[1:36:51] place and you don't do that being
[1:36:54] outside of
[1:36:57] it and if you're not in God's provided
[1:37:00] place then it will be the
[1:37:04] destruction of your
[1:37:12] family Romans
[1:37:15] 8:28 and we know that all things work
[1:37:17] together for the good to them that love
[1:37:19] God to them that are the called
[1:37:20] according to his purpose amen so it's
[1:37:24] it's going to be working to the good I
[1:37:26] want you know I I want you to understand
[1:37:29] that the blessings of God for the
[1:37:31] children of God are because he has
[1:37:34] called us
[1:37:36] out and if you can recognize that in
[1:37:38] this day God through a seventh age
[1:37:41] messenger has called out a people from
[1:37:43] gross
[1:37:44] denominationalism from the understanding
[1:37:46] that we in look denominationalism is not
[1:37:49] a we're in the message we are not
[1:37:52] subject to
[1:37:54] denominationalism okay
[1:37:56] denominationalism is when people start
[1:37:59] getting in a comfort zone right we're
[1:38:05] good and you as an individual God's
[1:38:08] calling for separation yes because it's
[1:38:11] a
[1:38:13] principle it's something that has to be
[1:38:17] happening and it it's just a
[1:38:20] growth we're filling the pull you the
[1:38:23] pressure The Strain yes sir you may
[1:38:25] think that it's an election year strain
[1:38:29] you may think it's economic you may but
[1:38:31] it's you as the bride coming into the
[1:38:34] position of reflecting Christ
[1:38:37] himself that's the separating that's the
[1:38:40] pull that's the place of blessing and
[1:38:43] it's it's if you just don't understand
[1:38:47] what the travel is and what the
[1:38:49] separating is then you'll miss out on
[1:38:53] understanding that it's for a purpose
[1:38:55] just as a man Cleaves to his wife and
[1:38:58] it's the greatest blessing in the world
[1:39:00] it wasn't that he lost his family nobody
[1:39:02] assesses their marriage like look what I
[1:39:06] lost and if they
[1:39:08] do something wrong thank you Matthew
[1:39:12] said something would be dreadfully wrong
[1:39:15] right
[1:39:18] so love Christ with all your heart yes
[1:39:21] sir be willing to separate yourself from
[1:39:24] all the things that he wants to separate
[1:39:26] you from from your
[1:39:27] unbelief mostly from your own unbelief
[1:39:30] from doubting you are who God's called
[1:39:32] you to be from doubting that you are a
[1:39:34] son and daughter of God that's called
[1:39:36] out to be peculiar to be holy to be set
[1:39:38] aside to be used of
[1:39:41] him the reason we don't set ourselves
[1:39:43] aside is because we don't understand
[1:39:45] that you may be the very vehicle that
[1:39:47] God uses to save
[1:39:49] somebody you know I want to say this
[1:39:51] it's despite our
[1:39:54] righteousness it's despite our
[1:39:56] understanding of worthiness it's his
[1:39:59] election okay and you would have a lot
[1:40:02] greater confidence to allow yourself to
[1:40:04] be used by him if you just understood
[1:40:06] that you were called out and separated
[1:40:08] for a purpose okay so for your own
[1:40:10] conscience sake get rid of those things
[1:40:13] but I would say despite it God can still
[1:40:16] use you if you're just a penny God can
[1:40:19] use you I thought I was going to maybe
[1:40:22] open the this this message and read some
[1:40:24] things and and and walk through it but
[1:40:26] God had his way and led things but I did
[1:40:28] want to to read at least what and be
[1:40:31] faithful to read a lot of times I leave
[1:40:33] and I feel like I didn't deliver what
[1:40:35] was on my heart so I'm going to be
[1:40:37] faithful I'm not going to worry about
[1:40:38] the time you can fall
[1:40:41] asleep you can
[1:40:44] leave I'm going to enjoy
[1:40:48] this all these Believers we could go on
[1:40:51] for hours all these were like a bunch of
[1:40:53] change out of your pocket in God's hands
[1:40:56] you'll pull out a bunch of change
[1:40:58] there's pennies nickels dimes quarters
[1:41:00] half dollars dollars all in coins now
[1:41:03] that's what the world is in God's hand
[1:41:07] now the world I want you to catch this
[1:41:10] picture he paints there's some people
[1:41:12] that just have to have a Penny's worth
[1:41:15] of it and God can only use them in a
[1:41:17] penny way okay don't despise the pennies
[1:41:23] don't call yourself a penny I believe
[1:41:25] you're more than that that's all they
[1:41:27] can buy you may be in the place of a
[1:41:29] penny but I believe God's going to
[1:41:30] multiply you and God can only use them
[1:41:33] as a penny in a in a penny way that's
[1:41:35] all they can buy don't reject them if
[1:41:38] they can't believe the real truth don't
[1:41:40] turn them down don't kick them out and
[1:41:42] say they're not in it because God uses
[1:41:45] pennies sometimes lot was a
[1:41:49] penny Abraham was a silver dollar
[1:41:54] so it taken a hundred lots to make an
[1:41:57] Abraham and so it'll take a hundred
[1:41:59] carnal Believers will never stand in the
[1:42:02] presence of a genuine Christian that's
[1:42:04] separated from the carnal things of the
[1:42:06] world living in Christ Jesus where the
[1:42:08] word can flow through him
[1:42:11] Hallelujah where the word can flow
[1:42:14] through
[1:42:16] you that's
[1:42:18] you you have the ability to impart
[1:42:21] eternal life
[1:42:23] every single one of you has the ability
[1:42:26] to impart eternal life this is the
[1:42:30] greatest pyramid scheme
[1:42:34] ever this is the greatest motivation
[1:42:36] speech that I can give
[1:42:39] you you have the ability to impart
[1:42:42] eternal
[1:42:44] life
[1:42:46] Wow Wow
[1:42:53] eternal life I was a I was doomed to
[1:42:58] failure I was
[1:43:00] doomed all I could do was impart misery
[1:43:04] and
[1:43:05] heartache I could just be a
[1:43:09] wreck a walking wreck if I came in your
[1:43:13] life
[1:43:17] uhoh you know I mean I was probably
[1:43:19] going to break something and I wouldn't
[1:43:21] have told you
[1:43:24] you know I you know even in my best in
[1:43:27] intentions I could think that I was your
[1:43:29] friend and you know I'd probably end up
[1:43:32] hurting your
[1:43:33] feelings right but you have the ability
[1:43:37] to impart eternal
[1:43:41] life by being a carrier of the word by
[1:43:45] being able to have the word of God flow
[1:43:47] through you by being able to say you
[1:43:51] know in its time in its season being be
[1:43:55] able to have that word and it could be a
[1:43:58] small word you know I remember telling a
[1:44:00] person one time I I said hey can't you
[1:44:03] turn off your stereo I feel like a punk
[1:44:06] for being in your car telling you to
[1:44:08] turn off your
[1:44:11] stereo he says well oh you don't like
[1:44:13] this I've got this you know now the days
[1:44:16] you just look anything up in you but you
[1:44:19] know we had
[1:44:20] CDs all right so he breaks out his
[1:44:25] box of you know bag book of CDs he says
[1:44:28] pick something out we'll play it I said
[1:44:31] well you probably don't have what I
[1:44:32] would listen to in there I I kind of
[1:44:34] listen to church
[1:44:35] music he says oh I got some gospel in
[1:44:38] there he flips over to section he like
[1:44:41] put some gos I said actually you know I
[1:44:44] think if it's all right I'll pass on
[1:44:47] that and uh so it got
[1:44:51] quiet got real real quiet in that car
[1:44:54] this is I was a I think 19 20 years old
[1:44:57] had just taken a job and I was I was
[1:44:59] praying in the backseat I was like Lord
[1:45:01] forgive me I I should have known better
[1:45:02] than to put myself in this situation
[1:45:04] please give me the words I don't want to
[1:45:06] be in this atmosphere I don't want to be
[1:45:09] here and uh I believe his name was
[1:45:13] Brian and then I said and can you guys
[1:45:17] maybe not
[1:45:18] smoke then it was a really quiet trip to
[1:45:20] that Jack in the
[1:45:21] Box but that caused such a conviction in
[1:45:24] his
[1:45:25] life it changed him on a path that he
[1:45:28] was going on and he became a really good
[1:45:31] Christian became a Baptist Sunday school
[1:45:37] teacher hold a
[1:45:39] standard you don't know what difference
[1:45:42] it can make in someone's
[1:45:45] life even if they're
[1:45:47] Penny it's all right that God can use
[1:45:51] them yeah you know we we don't know what
[1:45:54] it's going to be like over
[1:45:57] there
[1:46:05] now I really enjoyed the thought of the
[1:46:08] penny
[1:46:09] but many people look at gifts in closing
[1:46:13] he says and try to impersonate gifts you
[1:46:16] can't do that you can't make a penny be
[1:46:19] a dollar you can't make a dime see you
[1:46:22] can't make a nickel it's a penny but if
[1:46:25] you just recognize yourself a penny and
[1:46:28] go with the rest of the change see God
[1:46:31] can use you you might not be able to do
[1:46:34] all there wasn't everybody when God
[1:46:37] called Israel out of Egypt every one of
[1:46:40] them didn't have to do the same thing
[1:46:42] Moses did but they believed it that's
[1:46:45] right they believed Moses because they
[1:46:48] knowed that it was a sign of the hour
[1:46:51] and that God had proved that he had his
[1:46:54] word you know there's there's an
[1:46:57] admonishment
[1:46:58] here that you have to
[1:47:01] understand we're so accustomed to seeing
[1:47:03] the
[1:47:04] supernatural we're we're P we we're
[1:47:07] accustomed to seeing very powerful
[1:47:08] Ministries I'm thankful for them God
[1:47:10] uses
[1:47:12] them
[1:47:14] but in God's economy we all can't do the
[1:47:18] same
[1:47:20] thing you know I there's been might
[1:47:23] Mighty things done behind the
[1:47:26] pulpit in a on the
[1:47:28] platform but I'll say there's greater
[1:47:31] that are done out and people don't even
[1:47:34] know about
[1:47:35] them okay so just because your position
[1:47:38] isn't up here doesn't mean that God
[1:47:41] isn't Desiring to declare forth his
[1:47:43] glory in your life where you're at as an
[1:47:49] individual you know as a young man and I
[1:47:52] say this to you just to understand I 19
[1:47:55] 20 years old I was in
[1:47:57] Arizona I was going down a road I
[1:47:59] believe it was thornbrier Tangerine I'll
[1:48:01] always remember thornbrier and tangerine
[1:48:04] I'm driving that the re or something but
[1:48:06] I see an ambulance go flying in the
[1:48:10] air and I I can't tell why I just see it
[1:48:13] Go
[1:48:14] airborne
[1:48:16] and like and and kind of disappear and I
[1:48:19] pull up on it and a and a gravel truck
[1:48:22] had te an
[1:48:24] ambulance it it's and what I saw was the
[1:48:28] back of the ambulance the Box flying up
[1:48:31] in the air and it had actually laid out
[1:48:33] all three s on the ground flat so the
[1:48:37] sides were flat the roof was flat and it
[1:48:39] was the exposed frame that was an
[1:48:41] ambulance that was a
[1:48:43] diesel and uh when we ran up on it you
[1:48:47] know I believe I was also calling 911
[1:48:50] the truck two people were coming back
[1:48:52] from the truck truck driver another guy
[1:48:54] the guy says he's you know he's dead
[1:48:57] there's two ambulance drivers um and the
[1:49:00] the person in the passenger seat was the
[1:49:02] side of the impact and the the truck was
[1:49:04] on pretty much on top of him his legs
[1:49:06] were underneath the the glove box and um
[1:49:11] and he had no pulse he was dead he
[1:49:14] wasn't
[1:49:15] breathing and in that
[1:49:19] moment there's the voice that says he's
[1:49:22] dead
[1:49:23] dead but son said you've received a
[1:49:26] message in this day that God raises the
[1:49:30] dead and I got up there and I
[1:49:34] prayed and that man came back to life he
[1:49:38] went I'll never forget that I don't tell
[1:49:41] that testimony much I I don't very often
[1:49:45] but if this was going to be the last
[1:49:46] time I preached I'd want you to know God
[1:49:48] raises the dead it wasn't a fantastic
[1:49:51] show
[1:49:54] there was a voice there that said oh he
[1:49:56] was never
[1:50:00] dead he just came
[1:50:03] too but that man was
[1:50:06] dead and I saw the life come back in him
[1:50:09] and I saw him grasp and he was more
[1:50:12] coherent than the
[1:50:18] driver and that time after time I could
[1:50:21] tell you the supernatural
[1:50:24] but that's your
[1:50:25] God he's the god of your life and I
[1:50:29] believe each one of you could share
[1:50:30] testimonies and things that God's done
[1:50:32] and I say that because and I share that
[1:50:34] because that wasn't in the Pulpit that
[1:50:37] wasn't on the platform that wasn't in a
[1:50:39] prayer line but you know what he was
[1:50:41] doing to me telling me he's my
[1:50:44] God that he answers my
[1:50:47] prayers and that's your God and he'll
[1:50:50] vindicate himself to be real to you
[1:50:54] if the musicians would
[1:51:10] come if you have a desire in your heart
[1:51:13] that God would be real to you in your
[1:51:16] life know with brother brandom he took
[1:51:19] him and he walked through the woods with
[1:51:22] him
[1:51:23] turned them back young again I believe
[1:51:26] that's the hour we're living in is we're
[1:51:28] going to have a walk with the Lord it
[1:51:31] may not be in the woods it may just be
[1:51:33] another day where you're driving to
[1:51:36] work it could be you're on the job but
[1:51:40] there's going to be a voice that says
[1:51:41] come walk with me and it's going to call
[1:51:44] you
[1:51:45] away and in your life and in your heart
[1:51:48] are you walking with them is your heart
[1:51:51] in the condition that you're remembering
[1:51:53] your promise to
[1:51:55] him that you've been called out and
[1:51:58] you've been
[1:52:00] separated that it's him and him alone
[1:52:04] that you're cleaving only to him there
[1:52:06] isn't things of this world that you're
[1:52:08] still hanging on to there's not cares or
[1:52:10] ways you you do things that are just
[1:52:13] because the way you do things but you're
[1:52:16] married to
[1:52:18] Christ and he's become your
[1:52:21] head and you want to do things the way
[1:52:23] he wants you to do
[1:52:27] them I feel I could be more consecrated
[1:52:31] I'm
[1:52:32] myself if there's things that need to be
[1:52:34] separated I want them to separate them
[1:52:37] but I recognize that in the separating
[1:52:39] that this message is provided God's
[1:52:42] ministered unto us an entrance and a
[1:52:45] blessing that is to the bride and to the
[1:52:47] bride
[1:52:48] alone it is a holy holy holy and we're
[1:52:52] not here to be like other churches we're
[1:52:56] not here to
[1:52:57] be perfect on the
[1:52:59] tinsil but I would rather be a little
[1:53:02] broken down in the building and have a
[1:53:04] character that was ready to meet Christ
[1:53:07] than to have everything perfect after
[1:53:09] the Flesh and lack the character to meet
[1:53:14] them and I believe this is a perfect
[1:53:16] word that's perfecting a
[1:53:19] bride and it is accomplishing that which
[1:53:21] it's it's a Victorious time we're
[1:53:24] walking in Victory and the Victory is is
[1:53:29] we're his
[1:53:30] victory he takes good pleasure it may be
[1:53:32] a reproach it may feel like it's not for
[1:53:35] a purpose it may even seem like uh to
[1:53:39] you and to others it looks like
[1:53:42] defeat but if you're in his hands and in
[1:53:45] his
[1:53:45] will it's all working to his glory and
[1:53:48] to his good let's just stand together
[1:53:54] let's just approach him in prayer
[1:53:56] gracious Heavenly Father we want to
[1:53:58] thank you Lord for your word and Lord
[1:54:00] the things that you can accomplish by it
[1:54:02] are
[1:54:03] only things that you can perform father
[1:54:06] you can cut away the the things that
[1:54:08] would hinder us father you can let us
[1:54:11] recognize the the glory that you've
[1:54:13] called us into to partake of with you
[1:54:15] and to share with you lord it's a a
[1:54:18] glory that's
[1:54:19] marvelous it may not be esteemed in the
[1:54:22] by the world the way that we see
[1:54:25] it father but it's the work of your
[1:54:28] hands we want to give you the praise for
[1:54:31] that we just commit each one to you
[1:54:34] father as you've dealt with them ask
[1:54:38] that Lord they would know that you're
[1:54:40] mindful of them that you're the god in
[1:54:43] their life and their situation and the
[1:54:45] walk that you have them
[1:54:47] individually Lord and that we would
[1:54:48] recognize that there's a path that only
[1:54:51] they can walk in there's a a position
[1:54:54] that only they can
[1:54:56] occupy Lord and by your spirit they'll
[1:54:59] be
[1:55:00] victorious father we commit it to you to
[1:55:03] your glory in Precious name of our Lord
[1:55:05] and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:23] amen did you enjoy that amen I was
[1:55:27] thinking about this scripture that uh
[1:55:31] Brother David read in Matthew Chapter 5
[1:55:34] it says verse 13 He said ye are the salt
[1:55:36] of the earth but if the salt has lost
[1:55:39] his savior he says wherewith with where
[1:55:43] wherewith shall it be it says it is
[1:55:46] therefore no good for
[1:55:48] nothing but be cast out and be thren
[1:55:51] under the foot
[1:55:52] ye are the light of the world a city set
[1:55:56] on the hill and cannot be
[1:55:58] hid there's no way to hide yourself
[1:56:01] there's no place to hide yourself and
[1:56:04] then it says neither do men light a
[1:56:07] candle and put it under bushel of uh uh
[1:56:10] bushel but but a a Candlestick it says
[1:56:14] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[1:56:17] the house let your light so shine before
[1:56:21] man that it May glorify that that that
[1:56:25] ye may glorify the good works and
[1:56:27] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:56:30] so I just
[1:56:32] thought we never should forget as we
[1:56:34] walk around that we have been given
[1:56:37] something that we can shine we have been
[1:56:40] given a light that we can shine to the
[1:56:41] world you
[1:56:43] know it's the very expression of Christ
[1:56:46] being
[1:56:47] manifested if the many challenges come
[1:56:51] but I think often time we shy away and
[1:56:54] we think about our own things that we
[1:56:56] don't do but we come to church so God
[1:56:59] can put us in the right
[1:57:01] position you know the only thing that
[1:57:03] would stop you from praying for somebody
[1:57:04] is the devil pointing at you and
[1:57:06] accusing you but oh if you could be at
[1:57:09] such place and know that my sins are
[1:57:11] taken care of and I'm here because you
[1:57:13] called me to be here if you find
[1:57:15] yourself in a situation you would be
[1:57:18] boldly go forward and say I'm here
[1:57:20] because the situation God knew that I'll
[1:57:22] be here that's why I'm praying for this
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:27] person we don't want to condemn we want
[1:57:29] our light to shine so that men will see
[1:57:33] that's what the scripture says they will
[1:57:35] look at you and they will ask a question
[1:57:37] what is it about you what makes you so
[1:57:39] different well I've been called out and
[1:57:42] the Very scripture called me separated
[1:57:46] person I've been called to fit the
[1:57:50] building that God is building not just
[1:57:52] any place but the very building that is
[1:57:55] building in the end time is that your
[1:57:57] heart desire tonight I pray if the let
[1:58:00] let let's lay aside the things of the
[1:58:02] world let's lay aside the things that
[1:58:04] are tripping us every day let's focus on
[1:58:07] this calling or this purpose that God
[1:58:09] has given us you'll find out that you'll
[1:58:12] never miss anything
[1:58:14] anyway the world seem to produce
[1:58:17] things but if you follow the word you
[1:58:20] realize it's made you more wiser it's
[1:58:23] changed your life it's produced more
[1:58:25] godliness it's produced more calmness
[1:58:27] it's taken care of situations where
[1:58:29] something else could have came why it's
[1:58:32] god making himself known in his people
[1:58:36] that's the message of the end time not
[1:58:38] just the God in heaven not just the God
[1:58:40] in Jesus Christ but the same God
[1:58:43] manifested in his people in the end time
