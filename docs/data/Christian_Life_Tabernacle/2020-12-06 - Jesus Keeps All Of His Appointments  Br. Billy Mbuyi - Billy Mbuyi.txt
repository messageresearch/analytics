are once again that you may feed us the bread of life that we may gain strength and all the nutrients that we have need of in order to continue in this journey bless your word bless your people we commit everything to you and ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you tonight we certainly happy to be GA once again in the hearts of God many if you could just open our Bibles uh in Luke's chapter uh seven we will start reading from verse 36 it says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when he knew that Jesus set at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of anointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet and with tear tears and with uh and did he uh wipe them with the with with the hair of of her head and kiss his feet and anoint and anointed them with the anointment it says now when the Pharisees which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself but what says remember now not loud but within himself saying if if if if this man was a prophet he would know who and what manner of of woman this uh this is that touched him and for she is a sinner and Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two dors and they owed and one of them owed 500 uh pants and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgiv them both he says tell me therefore which one of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose to he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou has righteously rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seeth that this woman I entered into thy house thou Gest me no water to wash my feet but she was she has washed my feet with the tears and has wiped them with the hair hairs of her head and thou has given me no kiss but this woman since the time I came uh I came in has no ceas to kiss my feet my head with uh my head with oil thou did not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with oil wherefore I say unto unto her I say unto thee her sin which were many are forgiven for she loved much but to him little Is Forgiven same loveth little and he said unto her thy sin are forgiven and they and and they that sat at at meat with him began to say within themselves who is he that forgiveth the sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace let's just bow our heads gracious father we love your word Tonight We Gather here Lord so you may speak to us before communion we commit everything we are and ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats amen just before we go on before I can just uh give a title of some of the things that just on my heart uh to speak tonight um I was just moved by some of the things that I uh Pastor spoke about this morning and uh I just wrote down a few of the things that just uh uh just just spoke to my heart it you you you begin to look around the world and around even the message you one of the things that just jumps that you you realize that uh uh people are looking for things that make sense people are looking for a gospel that's easy to swallow they're looking for a word of God that's mainstream they they don't want anything that's God you know things that just seem like it's going to cause a reproach they want something easy something they can take on something they can live by something they can explain something that their minds can comprehend and and and because it's the nature of men we you know I was thinking about this and I was speaking with Matthew a couple of days ago weeks or so we were speaking and he just done on me that the mankind find it very hard to live by faith you know it's easy to know that I have money in the bank to buy the food that I need to pay the rents that I need it's very easy to know that I have a job and I have this I have this when you have everything mapped out when you don't have a question life is easy you know if I'm sick I I have a doctor that I can go through and everything but but it we we understand that a Believer is not called to live that way we are called to live by faith and to live by faith means there's going to be challenges there's going to be opposition it means there's going to be time where that faith will be put at test there's going to be some sleepless night where you're going to be on your knees crying out to God for him to bring his promise to come to pass and there was also going to be a time where there's a peace inside of you when everything is in chaos we living my faith means you've taken your life and you've placed it in the hands of the one that you trusted and you know that he's going to take care of you no matter what living by faith meaning the enemy is going to be after you because he the the every time faith is Manifest there's always a trying of Faith that's along that's coming along so it's easy that's why uh we could see it in the world and and that that same mentality or that same reasoning is trying to be brought into the message where people are looking for things that make sense and they're trying to make sense of everything and so I began to think and and and I begin to realize I just thought for a moment even about the very uh uh Christianity that we believe today even as we see here tonight you you you look in the Bible we we we could talk our very Foundation which we can say is our background it talks about a a man who who who claimed to stop the sun with believe that a man said that son ST stand still and it stops now scientifically you can't explain that to me because the sun is not spinning scientifically we are told that the sun is standing till it's the Earth that's going around the Sun scientifically we can't make sense of that but we believe that he stopped the sun because that's what the word says and you begin to read it talks about people who came and who were Believing by faith that Moses opened the righted sea how do you explain they say that some will say well you know it was the reads and then the water came down and there's all kinds of explanation but as Believers we know that God parted the Red Sea he opened it wide open for his children to go through he did it because his word said he did it and he proclaimed that he did it and we know that that God did it because that's what he wanted to achieve in that time you read about a man who receive a son how that he was past the age of conceiving not just that they receive a son but God took their bodies their natural bodies and he turned them young and he gave them a son we we We Gather here we can go back in the New Testament we believe that the very founder of the church was born by a virgin you talk about things that don't make no sense we are not faith is not built on any understanding of men and brother Bram tells us that it's easier for us together today and talk about those things because they've been made mainstream and people have believed them we know there's millions and millions and and I'll say this if God made it challenging in that time that God will be unjust to make it easier for us it would have to be something that by natural mind I cannot understand it I cannot put it together but something within my heart believes this word it's not by sight it's not by understanding faith is not looking for some science or some records or something that I can put together and once I've put it together then I have faith no that's human Faith but the faith that comes from God is as Jesus looked at Peter and says flesh and blood has nothing to do with this your understanding your human mind and everything that the efforts of men can put in is nothing to do this this is a direct Revelation for my father into your heart for you to say the things that you're saying that's the foundation we are built on he talks about here he is and and he comes down to the uh uh uh River Jordan to be baptized and his cousin is the prophet and his cousin is the prophet and he came and somewhat some story about how his cousin was dead in his mother's womb and and Mary came and he poked the word spoke the word and he came alive and all those things and and and you take a Jew you sit him there and expect them to believe that it was a hard thing to swallow it was difficult the word of God is not built upon men's intellect upon men's understanding or ability to put things together this is another kingdom that God is manifesting around us that God is pulling things and is placing things so that the intellect will fail to understand it so that the human mind the wise and those that are educated will not be able to put it but so that he himself can come down and put it together for you and place within your heart something that will believe the hard things it's not we're not called to believe the easy thing if if if every Church on the corner believes it then what's wrong with it the whole world will believe it but we are called to believe something that men will look at and call crazy why because the wisdom of God is crazy to men anyway but it's the understanding that we have received by Revelation to know that that's the truth and all of those things were people's personal accounts who was there when the angel came to marry it was their personal account they testified of what happened to them they testify of things that God done for them they testify of how he came and he manifested himself and I want to say this if if that's the way God started his church it's the way that God is doing it today otherwise he will be an unjust God because the word of God is never without a reproach he always placed he's always brought in a manner where he misses the intellect but he goes straight into the seed into the heart butam says this and I thought I I thought that was just so awesome says in the message the talken it says it says we are it says we are we have not come together to talk about a message we have come together to get into the message it says and the message is Jes is Christ he is the word that's right we are to get into into get into it beneath it sir it says that's what we are supposed to do the message is not a bunch of understanding where we can come and say well we believe this we believe this we believe this therefore if you believe it I believe it then we believe the message no the message is the word of God is Christ is the anointing that have been come that has come into the heart of the individual that is bringing him into the program of God into what God is intending to do at the end time in fact what we have been called to do is to eat of the message and to become the very word that's what Pastor said the problem we have the challenge we have is we have too many people with intellect but very people with the Revelation it's it's intellect all over and intellect is clashing against intellect because if it's Revelation then there's no way there's no question to dispute it there's no need for you to explain it because why your very life manifests what you believe it it will be without a dispute it will be without a question that's why the book the spiritual speaks in uh Revelation chapter 10 John was instructed to eat of the book he was specifically instructed that you go you take the book and you eat it and when he ate it the very book became part of himself and that's why we have to come here tonight and realize even as we heard it this morning it's by eating of the book by obeying the things that he said by staying with the things that he said that's how we are transformed into the very promise that he has given us it's not a bunch of understanding when we can come and explain this and explain this that we are fun because the people that will go in the Rapture are going to be the only one that have eaten of that book and become what the messenger said they would be butam says he says he says and and and he speak now uh here um he says he has not we are not we have not come together to talk about the message we have come together to get into the message and the message is Christ and he is the word that's right we are he says we are to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we are supposed to do he's not responsible for any person out from under the blood no one no matter who he who he was or who who was not who he was not responsible he says he had to take only he it says all he had to take not only himself but the whole family now this is in the message the token the whole family the only safe place was the token to be displayed he says we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed that life becomes undisplayed that's right you must be under this token God's holy spirit and its display it's it display to you Jesus Christ because because it comes and lives in you so so you realize it's not uh uh the understanding of the message but it's the application of the token in the life of a believer that makes him safe it's when we have applied of this message follow the instructions of the message applied it to our life and be led by the spirit of God in our lives that's when we are Sav it's not even I like what brother Matthew said the other Wednesday it's by humbling ourselves dying to our own selves and letting his life live through us that's what that's our safety that's always been the safety of a Believer and and and so often time you know here we are people are calling it all kinds of Nam they're saying all kinds of things but they're failing to realize that yeah he is I was thinking about Samuel y came and Israel is looking for a king and Y he comes he gives them the word of the Lord and they rejected they want a King Samuel goes back and and he tells God and I believe it's in Samuel 8 and7 it says he goes and he says and he tells God he says they have rejected me and and the word that you've given me to give them and God looks at him and says no don't worry about it it's not you that have rejected it's me that have rejected in other words the messenger and his own message was a direct mouthpiece of what God wanted to tell Israel to reject the message messenger is to reject the word of God that's been sent to you that's right to reject what he said to question the things that he has brought us is to question directly because what oh the understanding of what a prophet is I don't even want to go because we don't have time it's not that the prophet has his own word and he can come and explain the things we are told that these men were men of God that were moved by the spirit of God to say things even themselves could not understand but they would adorate and go back and hold their head and wonder what did I just say man that God will take a life and spread it and and and break it into pieces and CA want to go marry a prostitute and and do things that just doesn't make any sense those were the prophets of God so that they will come to a place when when they spoke it was the word of God what they breathed it was the word of God everything they say was a direct word from God to the people they didn't have any respect of any Kings or for any man and to reject him was to reject the word of God so he says here he says that if any man this is in the message a man running from the presence of God if any man if any young man looks and he's looking for a wife to be married and here he stood here stood a girl that every that that meets every qualification and I thought and and that and qualification that I thought it would make it will make a woman it says why normally uh she was a queen lovely fine personality real Christian everything that could that you could think of to make a good wife he says no matter how much I say she's perfect she's ex she's exactly right she isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of being on my wife it's not once the responsibility is accepted and the person is accepted then that's when the qualification came it says that's the same thing with with with the same thing the message is you might say that's right it says this is right or the other and say I sympathize with it I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you are part of it so you become one it's the bridegroom and the bride becoming one in other word whatever you say about it you're talking about me it's the little boy looking himself in the mirror I have seen myself I can't excape what I saw it's me in there and whatever it says I am you can't separate the two and and you a part of it it says when when when you marry a certain woman that you have chosen you are you are you are one then it says and that's the way you are you are with Christ when you see him manifested and made real then you are part of him he is part of you and together you are part of the message the message is not some understanding or some theological understanding that we can come in and debate upon we are the message who could put a collection of people from different countries from different background as diverse as this who could do that who could come and and speak a word that would reach somebody from Asia from Africa from Europe from America and bring them into the same understanding and mold their life to where whatever this life is speaking this one is believing whatever is happening here it's the same life it's the same heartbeat the same God moving in all of them you couldn't do that with science you couldn't do that with education so I thought that just spoke to me this morning and and so I just want to get to my my text just for a few minutes we're not going to be too long tonight because we have communion uh as we read the scripture in Luke uh I want to speak but when I'm preach this message I thought it would just go uh so very much along uh with what we we heard this morning and the title of the message is Jesus keeps all his appointments Jesus keeps all is appointment and and that just rejoices my soul because I know there's no appointment that he won't come that he won't me and when you speak about appointment it speaks about an the definition goes to speak about engagement or a meeting or something that is's PL to do something that he wants to manifest something and we realize that that's what we are living living in that we live in the time where we have received an appointment this is that's why people getting confused because they failing to realize that what's happening today or the message itself is the Bible prophecy about the things that we're supposed to transpire in this time a pastor asked a question today can anybody look outside and say that this is not Sodom and gomorra can anybody look outside and say this is the Lan Church AG can anybody we look in the very message that we have received it speaks to us clearly of the condition that's happening out there to show us that God has made his appointment for this time God has come and made his appointment for this time and and so and and brother talks about how it don't matter who you are it don't matter what your background is if you make an appointment with him he'll come and meet you right in fact the scripture tells us that it's appointed to man wants to to live and then die and then after we die we have an appointment with him and so the prophet tells us that it's so important that we set up the appointment in this end so that when we go over there that we already settle everything here we want to make an appointment with him here so that our sin may go before us so we can confess and and say all that we done wrong and receive his life so that that appointment will be a joyous appointment but when I'm speaks in the message conference with God it says that Every Man Has a right to a conference with him and and I just want to just touch on what we the story we read if Simon who was inviting him in order to ridicu him to make fun of him to call him a false prophet to expose him if he would invite him and Jesus will stand up and show up for the appointment if the devil will come before God and talk to him about Job make an appointment with God and show up and talk to him about Job how much more a son and a daughter of God tonight we don't we fail to realize just all the opportunity and the benefits that we have in him if if those will come and they will with the need to destruct and with the need to destroy and everything they will make an appointment with him and he'll show up how much more you and I tonight so he comes com in and he meets all his appointment butam says in the message the unwelcome chrisis says Jesus is here tonight just keep he says Jesus keeps all his appointment no matter no matter how you are how or where you are he keeps all his appointment he keeps all his appointment with Jonah in the belly of the well he kept his appointment with Daniel in the Lion's then he kept his appointment with the with the Hebrews children in the F in the uh furnace it says uh uh praise God he keeps his appointment with me at the death bed he says and is here tonight where two or three are gathered together in my name I'll will be in the midst Jesus keeps his appointment always he's leaving Glory here in a little in a little he's leaving the glory maybe a little early so he can be here on time oh my what what privilege do we have as Sons and Daughters of God where we can pick up the phone and ring and it will be on the other end to just hear our prayers and our concerns and whatever needed I I tell you we need to get in the practice of calling him up and and just to ring him up and find out how he's doing and and talk to him a little bit and I tell you remove the confusion about the message being true or not true because at that time you know him and he himself and you've come in contact and he talk to you and and you won't need anybody to tell you whether is is a real or is not real because you yourself have met him and talk to him I tell you when our Trouble Comes our way or whatever the need is you got to pick up your phone and call because he's over there on the other side waiting for you and brother bam says I want you to imagine how busy he could be but there's not an appointment you can make and it will turn you down but talks about how he met him in the wood it says I took a pen and a paper and I wrote and I went and I stick it up on the tree and I thought I call him out and and he said and and and and things like that and then he says he didn't know how to pray and everything and he says Mr Jesus I want to talk to you he didn't even know the proper uh uh uh religious way to approach but he called him up and he says the most wonderful thing is he came and he talked to him but yet there are sons and daughters that have not ring up a phone for a while they're just busy with their own world and busy and and Jesus is waiting for his appointment waiting for you to call amen it says so find out that's he has a uh uh he always meets his appointment and and brother bam talks about this and and I'll just jump quickly as we move to along uh and he's presenting this in in in some form in paragraph 45 he says I I'm making this a little drama for everybody so they can catch it so he just dramatizes the story for a little bit just for the sake of understanding and and he talks about how uh there could have been this young man who who who was sent to go and deliver the invitation and and no doubt at that time you know they didn't have internet or or phone or whatever you may call it no Facebook and no uh uh Twitter No status check on online and everything and and so he must have went different places perhaps he went to capernum they said oh well it was here three days ago because news was basically just you asking people in the street have you seen such and such no you continue to go well you know the last time we heard it was over here and then you go and so this young man he goes and works so hard and he goes and finally he's able to track him down and and he comes and it says says perhaps it was just right after meeting and he had just preached and he was just sitting there tired all sweated up and you know just a little thirsty and tired and sitting right there and the young man comes and said oh perhaps Philip came and says well you know the meeting is over you can't talk to him and you know he's just preach and he's tired just leave him rest for a little he said well you know I have a a very important message for him and and I was sent by one of the high priests and he wants to meet him and everything and and you know so they came and they let him in and and Jesus took the time to see him what a gentleman regardless of how tired he was he was never too busy to pick up your phone or to answer your message or to talk to you he came and he sat down and and so he said well you know my master is organizing a feast and he wants to see you and everything and he came and and Jesus looked at it and he said for a while he looked at it he said tell you master I'll be there oh the young man's heart was so joyful oh he accepted the invitation and he ran out but when I'm asked the question it says oh what an opportunity this young man missed he came face to face with Jesus and all he was caught up in was the message that he was sent to deliver all he was caught up in was oh I got to go my master sent me oh if we could just ask for an audience even if minute and say master remember me I have a I have trouble and I need you to touch me I need my sins to be forgiven I need Deliverance for one minute his life would have been changed oh I tell you when I heard that my heart sink and because we don't want to make Church com in a tradition where we come in we know there's a song leader there's a pastor and we come and we just sing and we we hear the word and we go back no we're coming into the presence of the Living God he said it were two or three I got I'll be in the midst so we walking into his presence whatever you have need of make it known to him brothers and sisters these churches will be closed we know that but we want to use of make use of every opportunity every time we ring up his phone to make known unto him our needs and and and to to just take a moment for you to speak to him this young man missed a really big opportunity it just came in and he was caught up and Bam says that's the same church somewhere with the church people get caught up in the system and you know our church is bigger than yours and our music is better than you guys is and you know we just come and this is how we do things and and the moment somebody does something different all eyes are on him and you know because we have we've built a tradition we've made we've created what's acceptable and what's not it's no longer uh the spirit of God moving into your heart for you to do things that are according to the word of God but it's oh what does everybody do before I can follow that's not how he's wanting us to be he want as a people that are led by his word that speaks his word and that wants to reach out and touch him I have a need and I'm touching you tonight that's the kind of people is looking and and so find out it wasn't it strange this Pharisees that hated him the most that wanted to kill him plotting to kill him every day yeah they are inviting him to a fist he knew they were going to make fun of him but he went anyway you see he was feeling sorry for them because they just never had an eyesight to understand what was happening it was never about himself it was always is about what he can extend the grace of God what his mission was someone who lived by the word of the father someone who took his life and placed it in the hand of God and and he knew that whatever happened to me is according to the will of my father I'm here to do my father's business and not my own so he stands up and he goes and and he goes and and and he finally takes the invitation and he goes so this young man misses his opportunity so when he gets there they he talks about the road's condition how that there's all kinds of things happening the animal uh uh uh uh uh uh faces and all the things and the dust and everything how that it's a tradition that when you get there they wash your feet and and they anoint it with oil they wipe it and they anoint it with oil and they take your beard they groom it and and they groom it all nicely and put it with oil and so that you can go and grease and and and then be kissed by the host he comes and he talks about how Jesus went and he showed up and they watch him just sited there no greetings nothing people enjoying their own programs and and and it says that Feast already started they were drinking and they were talking and everything and yet they watch him just sit there they watch him just sit there and as he sat there says and then we find out that in the alley there was this young woman whose heart was beating and she came and she noticed the streets were pretty quiet and nobody in the streets and she goes out and and she finds out that there was a a a reception and something going on at the house of Simon and she came and then she was walking by because that's where the attraction was she notices Jesus sitting there with dirty feet you know I begin to think if we've allowed him to have dirty feet you know God in our lives is there for us to worship him to praise him is there for us to give him all that we are is there for us to do all that we can so he could be he can feel welcome is there so we can give all that we are the best that we are to him but often time he's left over to the side we have our jobs and we have our families we have this and this after we've done everything then we turn back to him to try to talk to him he comes and this young woman comes and and she comes and she sees she notices that his feet are not washed and so she stood there and she noticed everybody's feet is Washed by his something within our heart began to beat and begin to pump but yet there's a great battle within her Minds because she's wanting to go but something within her is reminding her of her own life you you look at you and look at the kind of life you're living and you can't go there you're not fit to be there and that's not your place and all those things and and but yet she's sing there and and just trying to figure out how do I get in how do I what do I do I can't just sit him uh sit here or stand here watching him sit there with the feet unwashed but R makes this statement that just touched my heart it says that for whatever battle she had in her mind something within her heart just wanted to serve God she just wanted to do something so she ran out and she went and got all the money that she had and she went and bought this perfume and she run back now remember before you can get in there's a process you have to have an invitation you you have to be checked your feet have to be washed and everything had to be done before you can get in but makes a statement it says but if you want to serve God God will make a way for you to get in if we have it in our hearts to serve him if we want to give him all our best God has a way and I want to say this it's not the way that we have made it's the way that he has made I want to even say about this woman I want to say this you know often time we talk about even about the woman at the well how she came and she began to talk about Jesus because that was also another appointment she began to talk about how they worship and how those worshippers worship uh uh we worship in Jerusalem and how those others do Jesus looked at him and says The Hours come where the true worshippers is worship in truth and and in spirit and in truth now I want to say this Jesus Jesus is not looking for worship for something that he didn't do that's the devil God is Not Looking for worship outside of his word God Is Made A Way the scripture says that God has made a way is looking for people that are going to worship him for what God has done in your life for what God is doing in your life for how he got you out of sin and what he done for you and how he saved you how we delivered you that's the kind of worship is looking for and he himself he making those worshippers it's a people that have received something like brother Mike said it this morning there's a people all they looking for is just to reflect back to him oh God I'm one that you saved I was a sinner I I I just was in the world I didn't even know who you were but you came down my way and you saved my life and I'm here to let the people know that you are a wonderful God so she came and she find a way to get in how did she pass the people who were checking the invitation only God knows how did she went past the people that were uh uh setting up all the things only God knows she comes and she begins to was his feet and before she got in there she said within herself he will know what I am and where I got this money you know that that speaks volume it it's not about the challenges that goes within your head it's not about the challenges that you have to overcome within your mind all those battles it's about what's beating in your heart to do what is it in your heart to do for him because at the end of the day regardless of what level you are in there's always going to be a mind battle but what counts is what's within your heart to do for him so he gets in and he began to wash his feet and Bam says he knew that if you just move his foot just a little bit she would run off it just stays still and it move for a second she let him serve him brother and sister I want to just say this perhaps on the planet right now there's nobody who can worship God like the people that have received this message to think about the treasure that we have received and even how people are calling it all kinds of names we are the best worshiper that could be on this planet why are we running away what are we not running to him and just sit there and let our tears let our life let everything know we all just worship Him Just Praise Him Just Praise Him what an opportunity we've been given to be called The Bride of Jesus Christ let me tell you this this message is not for everybody and if that hurts your feeling I'm sorry this message is for a selected group in particular hand ped group of people people that God has chosen on the face of the Earth it's not by understanding it's not by education but it's a people that God himself chose before the foundation to be as members of the Bride it's not for everybody If somebody walks away from it it was not for him God bless him but we that have received it that we know that we can't run away from it I tell you when those people are going away we should be standing up and giving him the best worship that he deserve like no man can offer it he says that Simon noticed it says we got him yeah I told you he was a false prophet now remember he said within his heart if this man only knew what that woman is he would have not even let her touch her feet and Jesus waited until the woman was done he said Simon I have something to say and I believe he commands attention when he speaks it says there are two debtors one of them owed more and the others order little and they were forgiven who do you think will will be happiest the most he says logically speaking it would seem like the one that owed more they said that's right he said Simon you invited me I came I honored your invitation and I showed up but I showed up you didn't wash my feet you didn't give me oil even to put then grew my beard you didn't even give me a kiss but this woman since I walked in has not ceased to do those things I tell you my brother my sister when people are rejecting this message and calling it all kinds of names and want to expose it so to speak want to expose the error so to speak God has predestinated a bride this woman was a predestinated woman she didn't she woke up she started walking up the aisles not knowing where she was going she didn't understand what was happening she got hungry she didn't know just like the prophet in Memphis the plane got grounded and he just began to walk the AL not knowing it's the same exact God and it's the same exact thing why because there was a specific woman that God intended that when Simon turned him down and turned the opportunity to worship him that this woman will show up and worship him oh I tell you it's not different from the end time when people rejected this message and they call it all kinds of name there was a woman a bride predestinated bride who's been sent to wash Jesus feet at the very end of it let's not miss our opportunities let's not miss what we have been given I don't care if everybody uh call this message of the devil there's something within my heart that will not give up I Want To Worship Jesus if I had 10,000 lives I worship him oh I tell you and often time I feel so small by the things that sometimes we get caught up within but my heart desire is with every bit of strength that I have that I may show and worship this Christ not just any Christ the revealed Christ of this world the ENT Christ the one who came and manifested himself why because he's the same yesterday to and forever and is here according to an appointment of the Bible let's all stand I don't want to go too long just want to say in closing we thank him for the opportunity I want to show up on that day on our last day when everybody goes and speak about how that they Tau and what they saw wrong with the message and everything I want to show up and say that didn't move me I just came to worship him that's all that was in my heart I just thought about how he got me out of sin and clean my life and make me a Believer and that's the only thing I couldn't get away from when I didn't know what message I didn't know what book is what where I didn't understand what's Genesis what's Revelation the word of God penetrated my heart the word of God done something for me I cannot be learned enough for me to go back and say no I can never get away from it like a Pastor said this morning that's the only thing I keep looking at who started the work who did the work who came and got you who brought you out of sin who cleaned up your life who made you what you are and the only answer is it's Jesus it's Jesus it's Jesus I don't know if any other it's him that I want to worship amen let's just invite our pastor at this time amen let's just sing that song I come to worship amen amen oh there's a strength that am in me oh and when I kneel down at your feet oh and it's the face of here oh it's the place oh and there's a place my eyes can see oh and when my spirit longs to be oh and it's a place of healing oh it's the place oh I'm going to live my oh and I can heaven I'm going to shout your oh and I've come to worship oh I've come to worship oh and I'm going to sing my song oh like am Hest I'm going to sh for oh and at the M of your name I've come to worship I've come to worship amen oh and there's a lot love that lives in me oh and for you Lord My Savior King oh and breaks the sin that's mine and leads me to a place of Freedom oh and I'm going to lift my hand oh until I can I'm going to shout oh and falling I've come to worship oh I've come to worship oh I'm going to sing my song Oh I sing wor I amen I I enjoyed that tonight you know what struck my heart the most is when brother Billy said God made his Believers amen he made you by what he done for you can't take that out amen and anybody that's ever had that they're joined in a union that that's infallable and I I just love that so much if you have your Bibles the deacons who are to serve can go get ready I I just think that if I was to have anything to add I would just say it's time for us to get about our father's business amen it's time to forget the critics and we know they're there and I felt led to address the situation because of having the minister in my Pulpit but I think there's another great scripture it says leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling amen let's press to have an atmosphere that people can walk into the Pres pres of God and know they have hope to be healed they know they have hope to be delivered know that there's a presence here that is welcoming that offers to them every promise in this book without prejudice without fear without hope that's standing shoulder toosh shoulder with Jesus Christ the same yesterday today ever back and pray for every Minister that St stands and asks for the great blessings of God if we'll we'll uh turn over to the book of Corinthians and the 11th chapter of the book of Corinthians and Paul bringing to the church a communion and it's amazing when you read these scriptures about communion and you read these scriptures about footwash you read the scriptures about baptism it's amazing how many Christians today don't take communion they don't wash feet and and yet it it's such a glorious blessing that comes with it and this is Paul for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the Same night in which he was betrayed took bread 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter the 23rd verse now the 24th verse and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord worthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup what a beautiful examining message we had this evening but let a man examine himself let's say that again but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen God richly bless you amen let's stand as we pray you all join in prayer once again there's healing in communion you have a desire to evening before the Lord our brother preach that he is here he's made appointment with us this evening and let us just lift our hands to him as we pray make our requests known oh Lord I desire a greater service to you I desire a greater love for my brother my sister father I desire eyes have that I can see Lord and white rainment that my nakedness th appear Lord I desire gold tried and Fire Lord just to be a better Chris CHR and a better servant of your word father I put my hand before you and my request Lord that the sin that so easily besets me father that you would give me Grace to overcome father there's many hands lifted many needs that are placed before Lord and we receive this appointment of communion because you said wherever two or three gather together there that you'd be Lord we're here fulfilling your word so we know you are alive and standing in your word Lord we ask the blessings of this communion be upon the people father and they receive from you even those things which they don't know even to ask you know what we have need of even before we ask and we invite you here this evening as we do this in remembrance of you our gracious father we ask you to bless this bread which represents your body father not only the physical body that suffered at Calvary but the body word Father which you brok and sent into each heart father we do this because without you lord Jesus we would have no life but because of Calvary we have communion and fellowship and we thank you Father we also ask you to bless this wine father that represents the stimulation of Revelation father the life that was in the blood and the truth that was in the Fulfillment of the scriptures returning back into the believer's heart and giving him Revelation and understanding father what a wonderful beautiful truth that you have left your Church in communion we ask that you would receive us now father as we take this in Jesus name we pray am
