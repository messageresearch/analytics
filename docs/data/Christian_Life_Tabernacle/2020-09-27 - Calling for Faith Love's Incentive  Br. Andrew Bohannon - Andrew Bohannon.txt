one name that men must be saved and that's by the name of the lord jesus christ amen so happy to be in the house of the lord again tonight we certainly appreciate what god's done for us this morning and we're asking that he would do it once more that he would visit us and be real special and tender to us like only he can be amen if you have your bibles we'll just go straight into the word of god we're going to be looking a little thought that inspired me by something brother billy said this morning and we'll just be taking a little subject we'll read the scripture out of first john chapter four in verse 7 it says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love it was in this was manifested the love of god towards us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him wherein herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we are also to love one another no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfect in us hereby know we that the we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us of his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world so whosoever confessed that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he is in god and we know and believe the love of god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if any man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he hath loved not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he had not seen and this commandment hath we from him that he who loved god loves his brother also amen i just think about you know brother david spoke on wednesday about focusing in on the love the love of god that was projected to us and how it will cause us to grow in faith amen that's why we're here to find out where we lack where our bad parts are but it's the love of god that comes to us that brings that healing sad that brings us the revelation that we're all hungry amen so if you desire revelation today if you desire another touch of the love of god why don't we just lift our hearts and hands to him and just pray together heavenly father lord god we read your eternal word lord and we know god that we didn't love you lord we were running from you but you came to us lord in that great love where in you loved us lord and you died while we were yet sinners father we just received that love tonight lord and even as our brother billy said that talking life this morning oh what a message lord and how when we receive that lord there's something that compels us to call for what we have need of lord we can hear the prophet's voice echoing in our hearts saying there could be never over emphasize the need to call on god for revelation lord we pray that as we speak tonight your spirit would open your word lord may we be changed from glory to glory lord may you oh god in this service move freely lord we just commit it all to you we pray in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord you may have your seeds don't believe i'll be very long we just want to try to express our heart in the way that it came to us and you know we just realized you know what god has given us we're definitely a very privileged people to be able to ask god knowing that he'll hear us and will respond because he's our father and even as it was mentioned in prayer that god's great love is so attentive to our needs amen so the the thing that i wanted to kind of share with you is something that brother branham said out of the message desperations and i'll just read a little quote and we'll just launch from that point the the message desperations paragraph 61 says desperations the signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperations now so the signs i know that we don't put emphasis on signs because it's the the work of the token in our lives is not a sign but it's a life it's a it's something that comes in it changes everything about you it changes your appetite it changes your desires it changes the way you look at things hey man so we're not concentrating so much on the science but we want to see what emphasis is being laid here so and to understand that as i'm in observance in an observation of these signs what it ought to do in my heart you know because like brother billy said the the faith it actually moves you it's not something that just sits there and then we place it on the shelf no a real revelation makes preparation for the fulfillment god when he begins to impart to us something that's divine he's waiting to see how we'll move and we'll continually go through different adversities until we recognize the value of heeding that call amen signs of his coming should throw every member of christ into desperations now about our soul about our welfare hereafter well what are we going to do if we amount what are we going to amount to if we gain the whole world what are we what are we living for what are we working for what are we eating for what are we struggling for to live what are we living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die it's true and so brother branham begins to speak a little bit about the different supernatural signs and wonders that were manifested in the ministry and how that this desperations when when this person had a cancer and was healed and it was a miraculous thing he says now desperations what about when your wife is about to die with the cancer he know that god could heal her and if god could heal his wife god could heal the boy and it through it throws it into a state of desperations you must come when you're desperate then god is going to listen to you but if you're just slothful and don't care whether you do or not well then that's different you say you do but it takes desperation to do it amen i believe the reason that we don't have desperation is because the lack of love god the love of god i think that the love of god causes desperation if god is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of time and the people waiting in sin the way they are it throws you into desperation i believe it will amen and we see the conditions of time and the people waiting in sin the way they are so we just want to just have maybe a little bit of a teaching a little bit of something that god placed on my heart that i've just been so moved and even hearing um you know the call of the spirit this morning it just the the focus that i want to drive to and it's based on this next statement as well it says now the the word plainly states if you want to put it down in galatians 5 and 6 that faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is love's incentive you see to understand it plainly sometimes you would have maybe uh a job and one of the one of the incentives that i had on one of my first jobs working for a restaurant they gave me a free meal for lunch okay that's just an incentive and then some other job you may have an incentive of free health care but now the the thing about the incentive of love is faith amen amen you have the ability to call on god and god deliver you and deposit you of revelation of his love towards you of his love that he wants to express through you amen so we just want to be calling for faith that's what we want to speak about tonight is calling for faith love's incentive amen that's just one we want to direct our thoughts towards is calling for faith amen he said at the end he said will i find faith in the earth amen this is a god who knows what he wants done in his people he wants to bring a faith that will cause a body change amen amen so you know one of the things that um i've been going through a few uh messages and and one of them was standing in the gap and then um it was something that was preached after the seals and and brother branham had uh spoke a message after that about the flashing red lights of his coming and i thought maybe we could just read a scripture and kind of take a little bit of what he taught in that and just see where the lord takes us tonight amen so we turn in the bible it's over there in matthew 24 matthew 24. we'll start there this is after the lord rebuked a bunch of the pharisees calling them the generations and vipers and different things and jesus in verse 1 he says and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple and jesus said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and as he said on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world amen and so we just want to maybe focus in on a little bit of the questions that the disciples ask you see this wasn't those that were in the synagogue these were the disciples and so now this is a question and brother brennan made this statement in the flashing red lights of his coming he said that he said brethren i think we make a mistake trying to apply all of these to his coming amen so but he he said now he asked three questions what is the sign of the end of the world what is the sign of the of your coming and when will it come the time that there won't be left one stone upon the other on the temple and then he goes on and he says now if you go to verse 32 in the same chapter so now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branches is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know the summer is nigh so likewise ye when you see all these things know that it is near even at the door verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of the day and the hour no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be amen for for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating drinking marrying and giving in of marriage until the day that noah entered in the ark amen so brother branham makes gives us a understanding here that you know the lord spoke and answered those three questions and said now you need to go back as it was in the days of noah so if we could turn back and do like our lord said and go back to genesis chapter six and let's see if we can find some parallels between that day and this day because i believe we're at the end time so in genesis chapter 6 in verse 1 he says and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born from them so so we look at that in a parallel and never has there ever been a day where human beings are multiplying at a exceptional rate there's so many the population they're they're saying we're going to run out of food they're concerned in every hand for the the population about housing and different things so there is a a hand of god that's turning the clock back to match the same condition that it was then to now amen so god was going to speak these things then so that when we see it come to pass it can cause a desperation in our heart we say wait a minute there's people out there that are in these conditions and yet god's done something for us he's expressed his love he's brought us to himself he's given us a perfect word and now we can just see it so plain amen he said now they would multiply so fast he said the very first word presented to us is an absolute flashing red light on the hand for there was never been a time in all the history that has ever been that so many people so quickly multiply as it has today until it's hard enough to find a place to stay and so many people multiplying on the earth till science says if it continues to multiply like this 20 years from now they won't have enough food on the earth for the people that was reader's digest i believe it was he quoted that and there there won't be enough food for the people amen and so he says we we can look around and see the places that they used to be wilderness and now they're turning into cities even in our area here you just there's hardly a place to build anything everything's getting built up and they're going out further and further amen he says now look around and and then yet the birth control and is is in the in his greatest rampage and and speaking about the you know the different aborigines cases and how there's so many but yet there's still millions and millions of people even though they're trying to do population control and things like that it's just never been this populated and and yet he's saying now it's pattern as it was in the days of noah amen and even even then brother brown's saying like in india how they were trying to make the humans try to interrupt their human ability to have children and even in china how they've restricted things you know even even that they still can't do it because of the prophecy amen so he says now in verse 2 he says that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives all which they choose it's interesting there's a number of things that just began to pop out there for for one it was the sons of god of things that they chose never mind what god's choice was amen and you see the the hour in which we live in man has totally come to a disregard to what god thinks or god says amen they say well the sons of god now that's the tremendous thing that's standing out how that sons of god these were the the lineage of seth now they're starting to look at those came the cain's lineage and now they begin to intermingle so now sons of god because of beauty because they had become so beautiful that they started falling for human flesh amen that's what happens when the population increases and and and and they just begin to multiply amen but now brother brandon was talking in in the 50s and 60s he says there would be one here or one there they would call them like the queens of the city but it was so rare but now what has happened the hand of prophecy has turned and now there's hardly a woman that doesn't have this beauty and it's caused the sons of god to fall and now the scripture says in verse 3 he says the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh and yet his days shall be in hundred in 20 years amen he says oh what a subject here now one of the things that i want you to notice that the sons of god saw the daughters of man that they were fair i don't i'm pointing to this to the whole world but there's never been a time on the earth as i can think of it only that time that there was such a wholesale beauty among women and you can't you can't remember some of the elderly women some of the people men you can remember back years ago how that seldom you found a pretty woman but today you don't find any but what is pretty is because that they have come to a place where they're bobbing their hair makeup and the kinds of sexy clothes and things and they present themselves in that way and then it's another thing the hand of time has turned it back according to the scripture and the women are constantly on the increase of being pretty amen it's another sign of his coming another sign that we're at the end i can remember when i was a little boy in school and i turned and looked at the children today and the girls coming on i can look and look at the women the young women the pretty the girls and remember that one popular girl and and then not be 25 years old but one popular girl pretty girl and nearly a boy wanted to go near every boy wanted to go with this girl but she was the queen of the group making the whole city and two or three women but now the whole thing becomes pretty all of them and what is it the scripture it's a red light flashing the time is at hand and they've invented lipstick and makeup the women that isn't so fair they can still make themselves pretty with all these face lifts and things they make themselves pretty amen so we know that they have spent more money on the cosmetics than they do the food amen so so we see where we're living at we see that this is the fulfillment this should cause something within us to start causing us to have a desperation to recognize that god has called us to a certain position in christ amen so he says in verse 4 he says and there were giants in the land in those days and after that when the sons of god came into the daughters of men and they bore them children unto them and the same became mighty men which were of old men of renowned amen they they become politicians they become great orators of speech amen smart people and god saw the wickedness of men that was great in the earth and that every imagination of their thoughts in their heart were continually evil amen they always had their minds on that corrupt thing it's just such a perversion of what god wanted amen and you see now because of this curse of sin that veil has now become an unholy veil and so much so that because of the beauty and because of the positioning of fashion and things like that it has made to where it's it's so perverted and the it's become so cheap that now they've been turned over to a vowel affection where man actually it's like it was in the days of lot you know it's like when the messenger came to deliver and lot was there he offered his two virgin daughters and yet they refused that they wanted it was that spirit of sodomy amen so we see that we're living in a time where this condition has come to pass again amen amen praise the lord everybody feeling good happy to be a christian amen you know god god's love has an incentive to make where we're at in time so plain that we can take courage that we can step into our position and no you know what it's not about my failures it's not about what i think i am but it's about what he said i am lord let it be according to your word in my life amen you know these these sons of god they begin to take these women of their own choosing never mind the the word of god it says thou shalt not commit adultery even if you look it upon a woman with lust in your heart you know those things because man they they look at that and they mock the word of god and they say well i can do this and i can do that because you know i'm getting away with it but there is a there is a judgment that's coming and so just because someone seems to kind of temporarily be getting away with it doesn't mean that god's not holy and just to recompense a reward for those things amen you know the the the thing that you know the token is is something that you know it's a confirmation of a payment that was received you know whenever god gives you the seal of promise it's because he's accepted your sacrifice amen and so now there is a there is you know there's witnesses in the world that will testify that you know i'm getting away with it but then there's another people that are witnessing and have a confirmation of peace that i pass from death to life i was once that person i was once mocking god ridiculing saying yeah you know i'm just like that because i was of the world but yet one day one day it was an ordained time in season god saw fit to reveal his son in me amen that's that's what a hope of our calling is it's christ in you christ in me amen praise the lord you know the token is a guarantee it's a seal it's a security and the token actually speaks for you you know when god plays a gift of faith in our lives you know that will witness to the unbeliever that'll witness to our loved ones that'll witness and so we don't have to work it up you know we're called to just walk by faith amen we were the guilty ones that have accepted god's provision and now the results of that pardon is being expressed by a life of holiness a life that reverences god amen that's that's the the thing that will be effectual working for those that are loved ones you know when they see you they say well this this uh seal is what pleased god and and you're different why why i want that amen so we're we're witnesses and and there's a signification you know the scripture says in um i believe it's in uh first corinthians 14. you just read it in verse 6 it says now brethren if there come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine and even things without life giving sound whether harp whether pipe or harp except it give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is piped or heart for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound how shall who shall prepare himself for battle so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to understand how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air and there are it may be as many kinds of voices in the world and none them is without signification amen there's the the voices there's so many voices in the world today and none of them are without significance there's there's people that they believe it's a reality of what they're doing but there is a true witness amen that gives a true seal a true sign that will cause other people to understand that there is a preparation to be made there's a tribulation to avoid amen and we definitely want to just trim our lamps ask the lord you know let that revelation come that'll cause a desperation in me amen you know we see the the signs that you know the uh the bunch that you know were with abraham where he turned his back to the audience we saw that sign that the messiah sign and you know that's that's one of the the things that we've embraced and know and just feel there was certainly something that you know brother branham made emphasis about the flashing red light of his coming knowing that you know when you saw this increase in beauty and you know the world's population growing and the whole disregard for god's word that that was going to be the time were the son of man the coming of the son of man and so in this coming there was going to be a restoration and so one of the things that i thank god for is the restoration of that holy veil amen when i'm living in the midst of all this condition amen i need an inward strength amen because i used to be in prison to that same spirit that the world they're at the altar of some woman some female flesh you see that's the bondage that man had gotten into when they forsake the word of god amen but god's come and in his mercy he's restored the token amen and the the the token is the holy spirit amen so if you receive the holy spirit it'll make you holy amen because it's not you but it's the holy spirit in you amen so when you're walking and you see the world groping in this kind of condition then it causes you to turn your head amen it causes you to help your brother and say you know what there's a better way amen you don't have to be a slave to your fallen humanity there's there's a provision made that you you can be born again amen yeah i take courage you know whenever brother brown spoke about that learn the parable of the fig tree and the fig tree is always israel you know and they became their own nation they got their own money their own military and it was uh the the day that they became a state is actually a day when the angel lord came to brother branham and spoke to him about a specific message and i just think about that the connection that you know so shall it be in the the coming of the son of man you know the the scriptures are being made manifest right before our eyes it should cause a desperation in our heart to take our position in christ we are the ambassadors of this great message we are the fruit of what he spoke amen we are the ones to take and be the witnesses we are the actual fruit of the tree that has been restored and that same fellowship you know amen it's so wonderful amen the the same works that he did he wants to do in us amen you know and how can we do the same works that he did well we need a revelation because we were guilty we crossed all of god's laws and we couldn't we couldn't get ourselves out we couldn't lift up our own bootstraps and cross that chasm but that that lamb that was without blemish without spot he came to us amen and and it's so important i just remember i could just go back to the day and the hour i just remember when i was listening brother branham said you must place your hands upon your sacrifice and and somehow some way you can go to that place where you're at calvary and you lay your hands on your sacrifice that bleeding bloody lamb is being sacrificed even fresh today you could go and place your hands and i found myself dying on the same altar with my sacrifice amen that's what it must that's what must take place in order for this token to be displayed because it's not look at me i have uh the holy ghost no no he has he has arrested me i've become his prisoner amen he's now possessed me amen and so i found myself on that altar amen that's what you find yourself on when you are at a place where you can't make a way for yourself when the bills and you've worked all you could or when you're coming to a place where they gave you the diagnosis and you find yourself lord i can't do it amen but that token's there and we call upon it amen praise the lord just find a place that we can make a little turn here and you say we won't be long tonight it says this in the token brother braham says i wonder today when god leads us to a life of complete surrender and service to him i wonder if our spirit then sometimes don't rebel and kind of show that i wonder if we are lambs the lamb is obedient amen a lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't take it don't take or claim its own can lay right down and shear off shear it off that's the only way it's got you never say anything about it just sacrifices everything that's a lamb it gives everything to it it gives everything away and that's the way a real christian is a self-sacrifice themselves not caring for things of the world but giving all they got to god amen and now this was the perfect lamb christ was and then there was the shed of this lamb the natural land in egypt the blood had to be applied and it stood for the token then it would be the blood of this lamb stood for see the token that we're dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice then the lamb and the blood the person becomes identified together the sacrifice and the believer see you're identified in your life by your sacrifice and that makes you what you are amen you know it's it's one of those things that you say it's a saying that we have it says you know don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice it's so easy to look at what we were by actions and things but when we look at him and we see our example you know he he proved what life really was like you know jesus christ never lived one day for himself he lived it for others and as the scripture says if you say you love god and you hate your brother you're a liar amen and so i say lord god i need you i need to call on you now for that divine love i realize there's things lacking in me i can see i can see people going that way and i won't even say nothing to stop them say wait a minute lord put something in me a real love a desperation to go out to those souls that are hurting i know it's so easy you just get caught up on the nine to five but listen my brother and my sister i realize there's a lot of things going on but they have the world partially shut down right now and and things just seem like maybe they'll correct themselves but i just believe we're the the world is going to continue to get worse and worse and worse it's time that we rise in the power of god's love and the holy ghost and let the love of god be expressed amen amen praise the lord maybe if we'll just stand and just invite the musicians the very things that god did for you he wants to express that same fruit to others amen in romans chapter 13 and verse 8 it says o man and anything o no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another fulfilleth the law for this thou shall not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shall not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shall not covet and if there be any other commandment it is barely comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is fulfilled in all the law and that knowing the time that now is high time to wake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed the night is far spent and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering or wanting not in strife or envy put but put ye on christ jesus put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen i just believe that there's a great admonition in knowing the signs and the conditions the time how it's turned back and we see all of the great mysteries that have been revealed and we see how god has walked us through the church ages and seen the horse riders run and we've seen the seals and the unfolding of how things are going to transpire at the end but let us wake up and shake ourselves and rise to this great calling and say god crown me with the love divine let this desperation awaken in me that i can fulfill the hope of glory and that's christ in you amen you feel in your heart you want to join me in prayer and say god lord let this love that you spoke about that would cause a desperation to see souls to see the condition that we're in what it ought to do for us why don't we bow our hearts together precious lord jesus lord what a what a sovereign hour lord that you've called us to here at the end father to to call us lord we were in darkness father and we were seeking our own way but yet you and your infinite wisdom and your mercy and your desire to have a family lord you've wooed us with your love and lord we received that expression of calvary lord and now we want to oh god go to the battlefront lord with the same love lord we just we're just asking tonight that you would do for us lord we're we're placing the token before us lord desiring that the divine love that you promised you would cap this bride with lord would so compel us lord it would cause such a desperation in us lord it would drive us to our knees in prayer lord when we feel offended by our brother or when we have done wrong lord let it oh god give us courage to humble ourselves before our brother lord we're asking lord that situations and personal needs lord that are upon the people's hearts they're here and and over the stream lord we just we're just gonna ask and commit it all to you lord believing that you're a rewarder of those who diligently seek you lord so we just place our cares into your hands praying your blessings on each one in jesus christ's name amen let's sing this together is foreign [Music] all i want to see [Music] my [Music] is is [Music] is [Music] we certainly appreciate the lord for his goodness and uh we just trust that the lord will give our pastor the brothers that been to the fish pride traveling mercies on the way back just remember those that the request we know that uh there was a prayer request for brother david jr going through surgery on thursday we just trust the lord will use that and the outcome of it will be better than what they they intend you know we know that god he's the healer and god sometimes he'll use a doctor to set a bone or to move an obstruction but ultimately we know it's god's that's the healer and we're trusting in his hand and and i have a request my mother's going in for a surgery uh on her neck tomorrow we just trust that you know it's it's times like this that we could come together and the love for one another can be expressed through prayer in in that secret chamber and that the the the works the the very love that that we have when we go to our knees it'll be expressed publicly by the victory that they can receive amen god bless you as we invite brother cosman to close us in a few songs and [Music] okay [Music] let's sing this song one more
