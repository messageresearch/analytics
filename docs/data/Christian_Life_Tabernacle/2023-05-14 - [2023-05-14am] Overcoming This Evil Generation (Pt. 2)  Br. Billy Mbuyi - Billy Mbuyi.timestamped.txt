[14:35] we just opened our service this morning
[14:37] it's a special morning this morning
[14:41] we have lots of mothers in our
[14:43] congregation and we're so happy for
[14:48] all the gifts they got her placed within
[14:51] our midst
[14:52] you know a mother is a special
[14:54] a special position
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] shows the attribute of God and it makes
[15:01] us happy because we're all here by that
[15:04] so
[15:05] we just want to congratulate all the
[15:07] mothers this morning
[15:09] that the Lord just gives you strength
[15:11] that you use the leadership of the Holy
[15:14] Ghost to instruct you to lead you to
[15:17] continue to just pull from the attribute
[15:19] of God
[15:21] and we're just blessed what a blessed
[15:24] day amen that's just about our heads as
[15:26] we just open our service this morning
[15:31] precious Heavenly Father
[15:33] [Music]
[15:36] lord it's by your grace and mercy that
[15:38] we all could gather this morning in a
[15:40] place like this
[15:41] [Music]
[15:43] it's not by something that we've done or
[15:45] accomplished Lord
[15:47] it's truly by your grace alone
[15:50] that you called every single heart this
[15:53] morning individually from different
[15:55] countries or different cities or
[15:57] different places different black
[15:58] backgrounds
[16:00] Lord to unite your bride together in one
[16:03] place
[16:05] the Lord where we can sit together
[16:06] around Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[16:09] eating around your word Lord knowing
[16:12] that you would come and dine with us in
[16:13] a generation like this
[16:15] and so Lord our hearts are grateful this
[16:18] morning we're happy we're rejoicing the
[16:21] Lord is our moments that we feel happy
[16:23] and we know that you're doing something
[16:25] special in our manslaughter
[16:28] Lord to all the mothers and
[16:31] Lord all that you've done for every one
[16:34] of us Lord we ask that special blessing
[16:37] upon him Lord
[16:38] that you just be with them that you give
[16:40] them a
[16:42] recognition day-to-day to know Lord all
[16:44] their hard work and all their efforts
[16:47] and all the things that they've put into
[16:48] the Lord that you would reward them Lord
[16:51] not on this side maybe but on the other
[16:52] side Lord because we know that's where
[16:54] our treasure is
[16:56] Lord where we would be able to walk on
[16:58] streets of gold
[17:00] fellowshipping with the very creator of
[17:02] our hearts and of our souls it's a
[17:05] privilege this morning to be able to sit
[17:07] in your present and know
[17:09] that this is where we find pleasure
[17:12] we asked this morning that you would be
[17:14] over your service Lord that you'd speak
[17:16] to us Lord that you'd be Lord with
[17:19] the hearer and the speaker Lord and to
[17:22] your songs and Lord you just give us a
[17:25] day of rest a day of a Rejuvenation to
[17:28] be able to just leave out of this place
[17:30] encouraged to know that you are here
[17:33] Lord and you truly walked with us you
[17:35] talked with us you showed us the way and
[17:39] then now we could be on fire for you
[17:42] we commit the service now into your
[17:44] hands we love you we praise you blessed
[17:48] be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:50] amen
[17:51] man you may turn around and if you see a
[17:54] mother behind you in front of you tell
[17:55] her happy Mother's day God bless you
[17:58] Amen brother Mike if you want to comfort
[18:00] Islam reading this morning
[18:22] happy Mother's Day to all of our mothers
[18:27] you know a couple of nights ago
[18:30] several of us brothers were out kind of
[18:33] sitting and
[18:34] having Fellowship around the word
[18:37] and uh brother cosmon's backyard
[18:40] and we were talking about
[18:43] you know the patterns of God in the
[18:45] scripture
[18:47] you know we got to talking about that
[18:49] first Adam
[18:51] who uh
[18:52] you know that first Son of God who so
[18:54] represented his character
[18:57] and his attributes and how he
[19:00] willingly set aside his position
[19:04] you know out of an act of love
[19:07] to go pursue that which was lost
[19:11] and
[19:13] you know that one who had chosen a path
[19:16] of intellect
[19:17] who had chosen a path of experience
[19:20] who had chosen the path of a new idea
[19:24] over the word
[19:26] and yet he laid everything aside to go
[19:28] and get and restore her
[19:31] you know and in that pattern we see both
[19:33] the character of
[19:35] God represented in his son
[19:39] but we also see that pattern of the
[19:41] Salvation work
[19:43] that he would be about from the very
[19:45] beginning
[19:47] you know I was thinking about that as I
[19:49] was reading psalm 74.
[19:52] there's a verse in there that says this
[19:54] it's in verse 12.
[19:56] it says for God is my king
[19:59] of old
[20:01] working salvation in the midst of the
[20:04] Earth
[20:07] that's that's his work
[20:09] that's what he's about
[20:12] working salvation in the midst of the
[20:15] Earth
[20:16] and he's been doing this from of old
[20:20] the very oldest of time
[20:24] you know the very purpose for this
[20:26] Physical Realm
[20:27] is so that the Unseen might be made
[20:30] manifest
[20:32] so that that which is not seen could be
[20:34] seen
[20:37] you know it's it's kind of significant
[20:39] that as soon as God created this
[20:41] Physical Realm
[20:44] immediately and said it was good by the
[20:46] way immediately a chain of events begins
[20:52] is set an emotion
[20:54] where he can begin to demonstrate his
[20:57] work of redemption
[20:59] right off the bat
[21:00] the whole purpose for the Physical Realm
[21:03] is for him to be about a Salvation work
[21:09] you know he
[21:12] it's the very purpose of this realm it's
[21:14] his work
[21:16] you know and as we were fellowshipping
[21:18] brother Matthew read a quote I don't
[21:20] know what it is I'm sure he'll share it
[21:21] at some point in time but something that
[21:23] brother Branham said in so many words
[21:26] was is that
[21:28] God needed someone to fall
[21:33] he had need that there be someone that
[21:35] fall and require Redemption
[21:39] you know and he had
[21:42] somewhere he had to have some situation
[21:46] arise so that that unseen part of him
[21:50] in the Physical Realm could be seen
[21:55] for God is my king of old
[21:58] working salvation in the midst of the
[22:01] Earth
[22:02] this is a project he's been working on
[22:04] from the very dawn of time
[22:08] you know as we read Psalm 74 this
[22:10] morning we'll just kind of read the
[22:12] first part of that
[22:15] it speaks the of the work of the enemy
[22:18] you know that's against the people of
[22:20] God and against the work of God
[22:23] you know it says in verse 4 thine
[22:24] enemies Roar in the midst of thy
[22:27] congregations
[22:28] they set up their ensigns for signs
[22:32] similar to what Peter said in First
[22:35] Peter 5 8 we have an adversary that's
[22:38] walking about like a hungry lion seeking
[22:40] whom he may devour
[22:43] you know there's constantly he's raising
[22:45] his voice
[22:47] constantly sending out evidence
[22:50] and arguments
[22:52] and signs
[22:54] and reasons
[22:56] in the midst of his people
[22:58] why they should not be a part of this
[23:01] salvation work
[23:04] trying to keep them from being a part of
[23:07] this ancient project
[23:10] he speaks in verse 5 and 6 about how
[23:13] there used to be a time when people had
[23:15] great honor and great respect
[23:18] for the things of God
[23:20] contributing to his work
[23:23] being a participant in what he was doing
[23:25] and it was great respect in that and now
[23:28] you know there's a great effort in the
[23:31] world we live in to discredit the things
[23:33] of God
[23:34] to dare to tear down his work and his
[23:37] word to try to distract us from the
[23:40] Salvation work
[23:42] that he's about and that we're a part of
[23:46] you know I was thinking about that as is
[23:49] reading Isaiah 5 it says woe unto them
[23:51] that call evil good and good evil
[23:55] that put Darkness for light and light
[23:57] for darkness that put bitter for sweet
[23:59] and Sweet for bitter in it if that
[24:01] doesn't describe the day that we're in
[24:03] we're all that was once honored and
[24:05] respected is now reviled and discredited
[24:07] and destroyed and all which was once
[24:10] looked at as evil is now lifted up as an
[24:12] example of heroism and good
[24:16] you know more than ever alternative
[24:18] lifestyles are being presented
[24:21] as alternatives to being a part of the
[24:24] Salvation work
[24:26] another idea
[24:28] another perspective
[24:30] another experience
[24:33] another way
[24:34] and all of them
[24:37] Trends whatever you want to call them
[24:39] all of them effort to try to show
[24:41] evidence
[24:42] that he's not about a Salvation work in
[24:46] the Earth
[24:49] but he which began a good work in you
[24:52] shall perform it isn't that right
[24:56] it says this in verse 2
[24:58] of Psalm 74 remember thy congregation
[25:02] which thou Hast purchased of old
[25:07] same phrase
[25:09] in verse 12 it says that my God is for
[25:12] God is my king of old
[25:15] working salvation in the midst of the
[25:16] earth and then in verse 2 it says
[25:19] remember thy congregation which thou has
[25:21] purchased of old
[25:24] not five years ago
[25:26] not 20 years ago
[25:28] of old
[25:30] purchased in other words that there's a
[25:32] people
[25:33] a congregation somewhere in the Earth
[25:37] who were bought and paid for way back
[25:39] when he began
[25:41] his salvation work
[25:45] all this Physical Realm is doing
[25:48] is making known his unseen salvation
[25:52] work
[25:54] by presenting purchased and bought
[25:58] people as evidence
[26:00] of his salvation work
[26:03] all the way from the beginning it says
[26:05] when somebody begins a construction
[26:06] project like the one we had out here all
[26:09] the materials were bought and paid for
[26:11] and set aside
[26:13] ready to give evidence that there was a
[26:16] work about to be done
[26:18] and somewhere in the earth there's a
[26:19] people that are those building materials
[26:21] to give evidence of his unseen salvation
[26:24] work in this Physical Realm
[26:29] you know how many can say
[26:33] that there are evidence of God that he's
[26:36] working an unseen salvation work in the
[26:39] Physical Realm
[26:41] you know I was reading that and you know
[26:43] in spite of all the experiences and
[26:46] arguments
[26:48] the ideas the trends the alternative
[26:51] Lifestyles that would try to disprove
[26:53] the fact that he's about a Salvation
[26:55] work
[26:56] I don't know about you but I'm looking
[26:58] at a room full of evidence
[27:01] that he's about a Salvation work from of
[27:04] old
[27:05] and he's been waiting for a period of
[27:07] time to show forth the evidence that
[27:10] he's been about the work and the
[27:12] evidence is in this room
[27:14] so as we read Psalm 74 together I just
[27:16] got such a blessing out of that
[27:18] especially in this time of construction
[27:20] that we're about
[27:21] we're just going to read the first 12
[27:23] verses of Psalm 74 this morning starting
[27:27] in verse 1. let's read that together oh
[27:30] God why hast thou cast us off forever
[27:33] why do thine anger smoke against the
[27:35] Sheep of thy pasture remember thy
[27:38] congregation which thou has purchased of
[27:40] old the rod of thine inheritance which
[27:43] thou Hast redeemed this Mount Zion
[27:45] wherein thou has dwelt lift up thy feet
[27:48] unto the Perpetual desolations even all
[27:51] that the enemy hath done wickedly in the
[27:53] sanctuary thine enemies Roar in the
[27:55] midst of thy congregations they set up
[27:58] their incense for signs a man was famous
[28:00] according as he had lifted up axes upon
[28:03] the thick trees but now they break down
[28:06] the carved work thereof at once with
[28:08] axes and hammers they have cast fire
[28:10] into thy Sanctuary they have defiled by
[28:13] casting down the dwelling place of thy
[28:16] name to the ground they said in their
[28:18] hearts let us destroy them together they
[28:20] have burned up all the synagogues of God
[28:22] in the land we see not our signs there
[28:25] is no more any Prophet neither is there
[28:28] any Among Us that knoweth how long oh
[28:31] God how long shall the adversary
[28:33] reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy
[28:35] name forever why withdraw us thou thy
[28:38] hand even thy right hand pluck it out of
[28:41] thy bosom for God is my king of old
[28:44] working salvation in the midst of the
[28:46] earth amen

[1:16:54] know ye not that friendship of the world
[1:16:57] is enmity with God
[1:17:00] who soeth therefore will be a friend of
[1:17:05] the world is the enemy of God now I want
[1:17:09] you to see what he's letting you know
[1:17:11] there's no way you can mix these two
[1:17:14] things he's wanting you to be to have an
[1:17:16] understanding the the moment your your
[1:17:19] goals your objectives your desires are
[1:17:22] turned towards the world or the
[1:17:24] achievement of the world you are
[1:17:27] bringing yourself in a position where
[1:17:30] it's you you are in enmity with God you
[1:17:34] are being the opposing of what God is
[1:17:36] Desiring after you it says do you think
[1:17:39] that the scripture saith in vain spirit
[1:17:42] that dwelleth in US lust to Envy it says
[1:17:47] by ye give ye giveth more but he giveth
[1:17:50] more grace wherefore he said God resists
[1:17:54] the proud but giveth Grace unto the
[1:17:57] humble submit yourself therefore to God
[1:18:00] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:18:03] you now I want you to see this he's not
[1:18:06] doing saying do do one thing you do two
[1:18:09] things they're submitting to God and the
[1:18:11] resisting of the devil is what brings
[1:18:13] the result the two of them it says draw
[1:18:16] nigh to God and He will draw night to
[1:18:19] you he he doesn't say just sit back and
[1:18:22] relax and and everything will come to
[1:18:24] you no it says you draw nigh
[1:18:26] you make an effort you do all that is in
[1:18:30] your power to do you advance you call
[1:18:32] upon him you you show your desire you
[1:18:35] got under desperation you do that for
[1:18:38] God God will show himself to you and
[1:18:41] then he says he will draw an eye unto
[1:18:43] you cleanse Yourself clean your hands I
[1:18:46] just said God cleans your hand he said
[1:18:48] you clean your hands it says you clean
[1:18:51] your hands ye Sinners and purify your
[1:18:54] heart Ye Ye double ye double-minded amen
[1:18:59] you may have your seats this morning so
[1:19:01] I I wanna as we read to hear I I just
[1:19:05] before I can get into I want to continue
[1:19:07] we left off last time but before we we
[1:19:10] continue as we read the scriptures I I
[1:19:13] just want to uh point this out as an
[1:19:16] outset so we we are we we have this
[1:19:18] understanding I want to say this we we
[1:19:22] have been called in this generation to
[1:19:25] be Overcomers
[1:19:27] uh don't don't ever look at your life
[1:19:30] and look at yourself this morning and
[1:19:32] say well I I'm here to just contend and
[1:19:35] fight and fight and see if I will
[1:19:37] overcome no you are called to be an
[1:19:40] Overcomers the overcoming is your
[1:19:43] possession your overcoming is something
[1:19:45] that's been given to you the overcome is
[1:19:48] an ability that God is laid within your
[1:19:51] hands it's not something that we come
[1:19:54] and we wonder am I ever going to
[1:19:56] overcome is this really going to go away
[1:19:58] am I really going to be what God wants
[1:20:00] me to be no God has placed every uh uh
[1:20:04] possession God has placed every uh uh
[1:20:08] every part of his word available to you
[1:20:10] so that you can take his word and
[1:20:12] overcome it's not a matter of will I he
[1:20:16] wants you to overcome he's made a way
[1:20:18] for you to overcome and his major review
[1:20:20] Overcomer and we can only overcome if we
[1:20:24] follow the path that is laid before us
[1:20:26] so he wants says to be motivated he
[1:20:28] wants us to be engaged he wants us to
[1:20:31] look for it to seek for it you you you
[1:20:33] don't ever get an unmotivated person and
[1:20:36] trying to get him to to do something
[1:20:38] that require motivation no we we within
[1:20:42] ourselves we have when we read the word
[1:20:44] of God when we come in contact with the
[1:20:46] word of God the word of God has to
[1:20:48] motivate us the desire that lies within
[1:20:52] us for us to move forward and as we read
[1:20:56] last time we'll read it again he's not
[1:20:58] trying to just push you through no he's
[1:21:01] warning you when you read the word of
[1:21:02] God you consider your situation you say
[1:21:05] that I have been made to overcome I'm
[1:21:08] not made to dwell in the setting that I
[1:21:10] am now I'm going to take the word of God
[1:21:13] and overcome
[1:21:15] so we as we said the scripture will tell
[1:21:18] us that they overcame him by the blood
[1:21:20] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:21:23] testimony and they love not so they love
[1:21:26] not the lives unto death now I want you
[1:21:29] to to think that and because oh I was so
[1:21:32] much happy with the tape that we
[1:21:35] listened on Wednesday that the
[1:21:37] perfectionist because he overcame for us
[1:21:39] he offered what was required for us to
[1:21:43] be clean he offered what was needed the
[1:21:46] very sacrifice God himself making a law
[1:21:49] God himself requiring Perfection and the
[1:21:53] prophet comes behind and says God cannot
[1:21:55] require Perfection unless God himself
[1:21:58] can offer perfection
[1:22:00] oh I love of that kind of God we we are
[1:22:04] not here fighting ourselves and trying
[1:22:07] to prove something for ourselves no we
[1:22:09] are here to take what he has already
[1:22:11] done for us so if he requires Perfection
[1:22:15] he offered Perfection now we may be
[1:22:17] perfect he offered a perfect word he
[1:22:20] offered a perfect sacrifice that
[1:22:22] whosoever will come and will believe
[1:22:24] what was given to him that he may walk
[1:22:27] with confidence in his heart that job
[1:22:30] that I have done what the Lord has asked
[1:22:33] me to do and therefore I am perfect what
[1:22:37] made job perfectly wasn't that he didn't
[1:22:39] commit any sin he didn't do any wrong
[1:22:41] but what made him perfect the prophet
[1:22:44] will tell us is because what God
[1:22:46] required for sin job offered it what
[1:22:50] what God required for for for the
[1:22:53] wrongdoing job offered it and when he
[1:22:56] offered it he can stand there with a
[1:22:58] clear conscience knowing that I have
[1:23:00] done what the Lord is required of me
[1:23:04] so therefore it's the blood that says
[1:23:06] before us it's the blood that's been
[1:23:08] offered for us and by the word of their
[1:23:11] testimony God wants you to have a
[1:23:14] testimony this morning let me say this
[1:23:16] this is not a religion of our
[1:23:18] grandfather and our fathers where we
[1:23:20] come we say well God sent a messenger
[1:23:23] our parents believed it then we come
[1:23:25] behind we believe it and we say well we
[1:23:28] follow just what they told us and
[1:23:30] everything God is not a respecter of
[1:23:32] person God is not here saying that
[1:23:35] because your parents believe you are
[1:23:37] accepted in God wants to have a personal
[1:23:39] relationship with you
[1:23:42] yeah and we we have to move into these
[1:23:45] things with uh and with a clear
[1:23:47] understanding because oftentimes we come
[1:23:49] and we say well the Lord sent the
[1:23:51] prophet and he dealt with the prophet
[1:23:53] and he did this with the prophet that's
[1:23:55] wonderful but that's not good enough the
[1:23:58] same God who walked with the prophet the
[1:24:00] same God who operated in the prophet if
[1:24:03] he doesn't come and operate in you it's
[1:24:06] useless then then you you just believing
[1:24:09] to nothing we are believing unto
[1:24:11] salvation we are believing unto the
[1:24:14] things that we have need of so when we
[1:24:16] say God did with the prophet we come
[1:24:19] with an understanding now what he did
[1:24:21] with the prophet he's going to do it
[1:24:23] with me when we say the prophet was the
[1:24:26] first fruit is with an understanding oh
[1:24:30] my people get offended when you say it
[1:24:33] was the first fruit when you say that
[1:24:35] God dwelled in the prophet and he did
[1:24:37] this and he did that when you say that
[1:24:39] it was him when he turned the back that
[1:24:41] was Jesus Christ manifested but what
[1:24:44] they're failing to understand is that's
[1:24:46] the same thing he's wanting to do with
[1:24:48] you
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:52] I understand then there's a Ministry of
[1:24:54] the Prophet where he can see things and
[1:24:57] and call things that were not and and be
[1:25:00] able to see over the other side but the
[1:25:02] very same God who walked with him he's
[1:25:04] here this morning he's here this morning
[1:25:07] not to do less to do the same thing that
[1:25:11] he did with the messenger so therefore
[1:25:13] when we read this we say oh God came and
[1:25:16] he talked to him God came and he told
[1:25:18] him this God came and he changed what he
[1:25:20] wanted to preach it was not for the sake
[1:25:22] of the Prophet it was for your sake
[1:25:26] so it can come with boldness this
[1:25:29] morning and say oh if God has ever done
[1:25:32] one thing one way he's obligated to do
[1:25:35] it with every believer that comes along
[1:25:38] oh my and I want to say this to that the
[1:25:42] prophet will tell us to overcome that we
[1:25:45] need to recognize the devil and every
[1:25:49] single one of his strengths
[1:25:51] now this word is I I I I was looking it
[1:25:54] up it's so important because when he
[1:25:57] says to recognize that he therefore it
[1:26:01] doesn't necessarily mean to engage the
[1:26:03] devil
[1:26:07] to recognize the devil
[1:26:10] something is happening you see him and
[1:26:13] you recognize that this is him it's a
[1:26:16] warning through you in order for you to
[1:26:18] be guarded by the word of God
[1:26:21] it's a warning to you to see the pattern
[1:26:24] of his doing so you can look at the
[1:26:26] world around you you can see what's
[1:26:28] happening out there and saying that I am
[1:26:31] recognizing that this is what the word
[1:26:33] says will happen at the end time and I'm
[1:26:36] recognizing the pattern of the devil
[1:26:38] therefore I need to be equipped with a
[1:26:40] word because remember it says recognize
[1:26:43] the devil and every single one of his
[1:26:45] tricks but at the same time to recognize
[1:26:47] the greater we see that is in you that
[1:26:50] him that is in the world in other words
[1:26:52] the word is telling you that God has
[1:26:55] equipped you for you to overcome the
[1:26:58] devil
[1:27:00] don't ever put it on somebody else don't
[1:27:04] ever put it on the next sermon don't
[1:27:06] ever put it on somebody saying something
[1:27:08] Supernatural don't ever put it on the
[1:27:11] preacher put it on yourself and say that
[1:27:13] I have been equipped to overcome
[1:27:16] and and I want to say this regardless of
[1:27:19] your challenges this morning regardless
[1:27:22] of what we got through never ever think
[1:27:25] that the word is not enough to solve
[1:27:27] your problem because that's the trick of
[1:27:30] the enemy to cause you to doubt your
[1:27:32] weapon and then disarm you so he can get
[1:27:35] to you but oh my if you can recognize
[1:27:38] this morning that wherever I come in
[1:27:40] contact with God ordained me to come in
[1:27:43] contact with it and by ordaining me his
[1:27:46] place in me something that will overcome
[1:27:49] my situation you will be overcoming
[1:27:53] but oftentimes some happen we think I
[1:27:56] need somebody I need this I need that no
[1:27:59] it's within you
[1:28:00] it's within you for you to stand if you
[1:28:04] need encouragement we'll give you
[1:28:06] encouragement but it's within you to
[1:28:07] stand and say this is my house this is
[1:28:11] my home this is a body that God gave me
[1:28:14] and whatever is happening here he must
[1:28:17] have given me the power to overcome him
[1:28:20] so as we said last time if I could just
[1:28:24] as a way by way of a background to just
[1:28:26] get quickly to what we want to say this
[1:28:28] morning the the the the prophet will
[1:28:31] tell us that this is an evil age and
[1:28:33] Satan is the God of this evil age and
[1:28:36] you will say this is Satan's Eden that
[1:28:38] we are living in and that he brought
[1:28:40] that he built it through knowledge
[1:28:42] civilization and education that he made
[1:28:45] all the things that we see if you can
[1:28:48] excuse me
[1:28:49] he says that's the time and that's the
[1:28:52] time that we're living in and everything
[1:28:54] around us as we said is the work of
[1:28:57] Satan and it's designed to keep you
[1:29:00] distracted and away from the word of God
[1:29:05] and I would say this that's why religion
[1:29:07] can never work
[1:29:09] Satan is the creator of religion so he
[1:29:12] takes the word of God he takes what God
[1:29:15] has given he removes the sincerity out
[1:29:18] of it he removes your commitment out of
[1:29:21] it he removes every part of it that can
[1:29:24] help you and he leaves you with an empty
[1:29:26] shell
[1:29:29] oh I believe in God
[1:29:31] everybody believes in God
[1:29:34] oh I'm a Christian everybody's a
[1:29:37] Christian the question is what kind of
[1:29:39] question are you
[1:29:42] God sent a messenger there's a law that
[1:29:45] I'll take that believes God send a
[1:29:47] messenger
[1:29:50] but you see that's not
[1:29:53] come because we believe God sent the
[1:29:55] prophet that's that's full but that's
[1:29:57] not good enough what is that God done
[1:29:59] for you
[1:30:01] how is that God touching your life how
[1:30:04] is it guiding your life how is he
[1:30:06] changing you how is he walking with you
[1:30:09] what effect does he have on your life
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] and so everything around us is designed
[1:30:18] to keep you distracted his design he's
[1:30:21] designed to keep you defeated into the
[1:30:25] things of the world and I want to say
[1:30:27] this and for most of us I want to say
[1:30:29] this he's designing to keep you chasing
[1:30:32] a carrot that you will never obtain
[1:30:35] everything is an opportunity oh you can
[1:30:38] become this you can do this you can do
[1:30:41] this well if you can't just want to do
[1:30:43] this you can combine all three you can
[1:30:45] do this and we keep chasing and you get
[1:30:48] to this it's not good enough and you get
[1:30:50] to this you think oh now I finally made
[1:30:52] it man creates something that just
[1:30:55] invalidates your job completely
[1:30:59] we we are not made to be successful like
[1:31:03] the world and if we keep going after
[1:31:05] that we will never win we will never be
[1:31:08] Overcomers in that because it's designed
[1:31:10] to keep you chasing something that you
[1:31:12] will never obtain
[1:31:14] and I want to say this as long as there
[1:31:17] is no desire in you to obtain your
[1:31:20] predestinated Victory you are in good
[1:31:23] terms with the Devil
[1:31:28] as long as life for you for me when I
[1:31:32] wake up is how am I going to get to
[1:31:34] braid I'm going to eat the next day
[1:31:37] and that's good enough for me and
[1:31:39] no spiritual motivation on something on
[1:31:43] I I was talking with the brothers where
[1:31:46] when I when I travel and and you realize
[1:31:49] it mostly and people have Ambitions you
[1:31:53] know they want to create and do big
[1:31:55] things in and when you get to a country
[1:31:57] to a place where there's two there's so
[1:32:00] many opportunities you want to just take
[1:32:03] all that you can and I say this I said
[1:32:06] it's important as Believers we have to
[1:32:09] understand that your job is not your
[1:32:11] purpose
[1:32:12] God didn't create you so you could just
[1:32:15] have a job feed your family and go on
[1:32:17] and build houses and do this and make
[1:32:20] more money and save more and do all of
[1:32:22] that we heard it I believe couple of
[1:32:24] Wednesdays ago when brother Paul
[1:32:25] preaching came here he said the the man
[1:32:28] says I will beat build a bigger barns
[1:32:30] because I have more money I have more
[1:32:32] debt God came behind it says you fool
[1:32:35] tonight I will require of your soul so
[1:32:38] we need to come with an understanding
[1:32:40] that your first purpose on Earth is for
[1:32:43] you to be worshiping God is for you to
[1:32:46] be pleasing to God your job is only a
[1:32:50] position in some place that God placed
[1:32:52] you so you can witness about him we have
[1:32:56] that backwards we do all that we can to
[1:32:58] get a dollar let me say this God can
[1:33:01] change your job but your position will
[1:33:04] never change
[1:33:05] he can place you here and say well you
[1:33:08] know I have a need of you because I have
[1:33:09] somebody here that I need you to talk to
[1:33:11] he can move you whenever he wants so you
[1:33:14] as a child of God you have to rely on
[1:33:17] God to know that if he's doing this he's
[1:33:19] doing it for my good
[1:33:22] where I end up in this world is not what
[1:33:25] matters to me what matters to me is I
[1:33:28] have fulfilled the purpose for which I
[1:33:30] have placed I've been placed here on
[1:33:32] Earth
[1:33:33] and don't don't let the dollar becomes
[1:33:35] your chasing or what you desire to
[1:33:38] become
[1:33:41] and I want to say this that the enemy's
[1:33:44] desire was to build a better Kingdom the
[1:33:46] Michael
[1:33:49] he
[1:33:51] since the beginning
[1:33:53] he just seemed to have it he wrapped him
[1:33:56] the wrong way
[1:33:58] that God will come in
[1:34:00] will take you and he will place you up
[1:34:03] in some position and and him who seemed
[1:34:06] to have been doing a lot
[1:34:08] seemed to have not been given that
[1:34:10] position
[1:34:11] he he didn't he wanted to exalt himself
[1:34:15] above the stars of God that has been his
[1:34:18] purpose so everything that he created
[1:34:21] everything that we see around the world
[1:34:23] everything that we encounter every day
[1:34:25] works to that same purpose that he had
[1:34:28] in the beginning
[1:34:29] he hasn't changed
[1:34:31] so we we can look at something and think
[1:34:34] it's an opportunity it's the devil
[1:34:36] always wanting to worship himself put
[1:34:39] himself above the stars of God his goal
[1:34:43] is to build the faithless kingdom of
[1:34:45] people that don't rely on God that rely
[1:34:48] on him and as long as we don't desire
[1:34:51] the reality or the real thing of God
[1:34:54] Satan is okay with us
[1:34:59] it's fine
[1:35:00] you're not burning for something you're
[1:35:03] not Desiring or working towards a goal
[1:35:07] and objective to see God Prosper to see
[1:35:09] God save your family to see God save
[1:35:12] people to see God move in our midst to
[1:35:15] see God accomplish and fulfill the
[1:35:17] purpose that he prayed us here you don't
[1:35:20] have that in your heart Satan is good
[1:35:21] with it
[1:35:24] and I want to say this we we once to be
[1:35:27] he wants you to be without faith but we
[1:35:30] understand the Bible will tell us that
[1:35:32] without faith we cannot please God
[1:35:34] without faith because the scripture says
[1:35:37] they now come to God must believe that
[1:35:40] he is and there is a rewarder of them
[1:35:42] that seek after him so without faith
[1:35:45] there's not even a connection between
[1:35:47] you and God
[1:35:51] let me say this there is not enough
[1:35:53] religion there's not enough psychology
[1:35:55] there's not enough men working that we
[1:35:59] can generate to be pleasing to God
[1:36:03] it's only by faith
[1:36:05] it's only by The Word of Promise
[1:36:10] I want you to be
[1:36:17] God wants you to acknowledge and and I
[1:36:20] had this I want to say this but what I'm
[1:36:22] says it's an age of deception
[1:36:26] it says it's not even that it's sinful
[1:36:32] it says people who live clean life
[1:36:37] they don't do any wrong they don't do
[1:36:39] this they don't do that but still
[1:36:41] haven't got it
[1:36:46] so when we talk about the deception and
[1:36:49] what the devil is after it's important
[1:36:51] we realize that to what extent that's
[1:36:54] why I'm so happy for the message of the
[1:36:57] hour because it's here to show the devil
[1:36:59] at every degree that he walks in so we
[1:37:03] we cannot just come here and be
[1:37:04] satisfied say when I go to church and I
[1:37:07] do this and I do that and be satisfied
[1:37:08] no you have to be in the will of God you
[1:37:12] have to be in the message that is sent
[1:37:14] for the time you have it says is to let
[1:37:18] the life consistently flow in you
[1:37:23] the moment you get cut off you start to
[1:37:25] die you start to wither you start to go
[1:37:29] you become that like that that chunk of
[1:37:31] tree that he talks about that was
[1:37:32] floating in the water but it was rotten
[1:37:34] why because it was cut away from the
[1:37:36] life of the source of the life itself
[1:37:39] and I want to say this but God made a
[1:37:42] provision for your Victory because it
[1:37:45] says in his word in every generation God
[1:37:49] has a predestinated people that will
[1:37:51] hear his word
[1:37:53] God as a people today and I want to say
[1:37:56] it and he knew that when he was send his
[1:37:59] word into the end time you will hear it
[1:38:02] and you will accept it he knew what
[1:38:04] effect the word will have upon you he
[1:38:07] knew when you hear the voice of the
[1:38:09] messenger when you will come and you
[1:38:11] will play that tape and you'll hear the
[1:38:13] message and you will hear the preacher
[1:38:16] preaching that word something within
[1:38:18] your heart will identify with what he's
[1:38:20] doing
[1:38:23] that's your identification in the end
[1:38:26] time so if there's nothing inside of you
[1:38:29] that for the word of God then you
[1:38:32] will never achieve it
[1:38:35] because I want to say this remember
[1:38:37] there's a lot of people that hear the
[1:38:39] same same thing that you hear and it
[1:38:42] means nothing to them
[1:38:47] the prophet says this in a message
[1:38:52] the God of this uh God who is rich in
[1:38:55] Mercy paragraph six he says
[1:38:57] you can talk to people sometimes
[1:39:00] on the street and talk to them about the
[1:39:02] Lord they like they laugh right at your
[1:39:05] face
[1:39:08] think about it
[1:39:10] and then he says
[1:39:12] well you're supposed to do it anyhow but
[1:39:16] listen there is no man can come to me
[1:39:20] except my father draw him first
[1:39:25] it says God has to do the drawing
[1:39:29] then it has to do the drawing to do the
[1:39:34] drawing there has to be a life and all
[1:39:38] that he had given me will come listen to
[1:39:42] this it says he made a provision for who
[1:39:46] for those who wants to be redeemed
[1:39:50] now he he yeah he is he's saying it's
[1:39:54] not just saying that for those that were
[1:39:56] going to be redeemed no for those who
[1:39:58] wants to be redeemed and then he made a
[1:40:02] provision for those who wants to be
[1:40:05] healed and then because he did this it
[1:40:09] makes him a rich in Mercy has he always
[1:40:12] been re being rich in Mercy and they
[1:40:15] must be if you refuse it there is
[1:40:18] nothing left but judgment because sin
[1:40:20] must be judged
[1:40:24] so we we cannot come not come swooning
[1:40:26] and laid upon God and say well because
[1:40:28] God didn't do
[1:40:32] God is not against you for being a
[1:40:34] sinner God is not against you from being
[1:40:36] what you are or what you were born and
[1:40:39] whatever the world did of you but God is
[1:40:43] condemning you because when he sends you
[1:40:45] away for you to get out you didn't use
[1:40:48] it
[1:40:50] so this morning I I want us to
[1:40:53] understand that the provision is there
[1:40:56] but there is a partner we need to be
[1:40:58] playing the provision the saving is
[1:41:01] there the healing is there the
[1:41:03] Deliverance is there but God wants us to
[1:41:06] get under a certain condition he wants
[1:41:09] us to approach him with a sincerity in
[1:41:12] our heart he wants us to come under a
[1:41:14] certain directive that he has provided
[1:41:17] in order for us to obtain what is given
[1:41:19] us so in other words but the prophet
[1:41:22] will tell us that God is a free he made
[1:41:24] us a free moral agent he's not going to
[1:41:27] take you by the neck and say you're
[1:41:28] going to do this you're going to do this
[1:41:29] no but inside of you he's placed
[1:41:33] something that he knows to the truth
[1:41:34] said that when you hear his word you're
[1:41:37] going to want to do it
[1:41:39] oh I'm so glad I want to do it let me
[1:41:42] say this choice is not a bad thing all
[1:41:45] you need to do is choose him
[1:41:47] use your choice for him say that he
[1:41:50] chose me I'm choosing him he died for me
[1:41:53] I'm giving my life for him oh don't look
[1:41:56] at choices and oh my God it's so
[1:41:58] terrible no oh let me tell you this at
[1:42:01] the end the celebration will be for what
[1:42:03] he has done for us I was a sinner but he
[1:42:07] made a way for me to accept him and I
[1:42:10] had chosen him
[1:42:12] now let me say this Dutch is your
[1:42:14] identification
[1:42:16] for this overcoming power
[1:42:18] without that you are no different from
[1:42:20] the person that's walking down the
[1:42:22] street at least he knew he plays
[1:42:24] something that desired to see him come
[1:42:28] to your life
[1:42:29] hey this is going to be a little bit
[1:42:31] lengthy but let me let me read this but
[1:42:33] when I'm speaks in the audition Church
[1:42:35] Hage listen to what he says here it says
[1:42:37] in paragraph uh 360 and one it says
[1:42:41] Revelation 3 21 to him that overcomes
[1:42:44] our grant to sit with me in my turn even
[1:42:47] as I overcame and set with down with my
[1:42:50] father in his throne
[1:42:52] it says now why it says what are we to
[1:42:56] overcome he says this is this is the
[1:42:59] normal question to ask here but it's not
[1:43:01] the actual thought that the of of this
[1:43:05] verse for it is not so much what what we
[1:43:08] are to overcome but how we overcome
[1:43:13] it says this is logical
[1:43:16] for this does it matter it does it does
[1:43:20] it matter match what we are to overcome
[1:43:23] as long as we know how to overcome
[1:43:28] now I love this
[1:43:31] this is inclusive
[1:43:33] this is not uh it's accounting for your
[1:43:37] special circumstance
[1:43:39] because the devil is designed he
[1:43:42] specializes in making you unique to
[1:43:45] everybody
[1:43:46] yeah your circumstance doesn't match
[1:43:49] anybody in the Bible your circumstance
[1:43:51] no yeah that woman at the well but you
[1:43:54] you have gone a little bit further than
[1:43:56] that you have done this but here's the
[1:43:58] prophet telling you it doesn't matter
[1:44:00] what it is
[1:44:02] and and brothers and sisters in order
[1:44:06] for the word to be helpful to us we have
[1:44:09] to take it as a prophet gives it to us
[1:44:12] we cannot try to add our own
[1:44:14] interpretation or our own mind or our
[1:44:17] own deduction so here he's saying it's
[1:44:19] not what you overcome so it doesn't
[1:44:22] matter this morning what the need is
[1:44:24] what I need to know is how am I going to
[1:44:27] overcome it and we overcome by the word
[1:44:30] of God
[1:44:34] the word is sufficient for all our needs
[1:44:37] oh I tell you this the devil always
[1:44:40] tries to make that insufficient and
[1:44:42] every time he comes he wants you to find
[1:44:44] something else he wants you to leave the
[1:44:47] word and go because he knows the moment
[1:44:49] to leave the word you are no longer
[1:44:51] under protection so you keep telling him
[1:44:54] like you've told him before I am not
[1:44:56] moving whatever circumstance I'm in I'm
[1:45:00] still standing on God's word
[1:45:04] nobody has ever been sick with us good
[1:45:07] the word will do it
[1:45:10] let me say this the word is the only
[1:45:13] thing that will create bring into
[1:45:16] existence the prophet will say this it
[1:45:19] says all isn't it so something it says I
[1:45:23] find it strange children of God who were
[1:45:26] created to be at the image of God who
[1:45:29] are created to speak into existence
[1:45:32] things that are not he will say I mean
[1:45:34] I'm paraphrasing it he says they were
[1:45:36] made to call things that were not as
[1:45:39] though they were and to call things that
[1:45:42] are as though they were not
[1:45:45] God giving you the ability to change
[1:45:48] your circumstances
[1:45:50] yeah
[1:45:52] and let me just jump ahead and it's okay
[1:45:54] I guess I'll say this that's what Jesus
[1:45:57] did the prophet tells us this he said
[1:46:00] you with your faith you have you have
[1:46:03] been given the power to create your own
[1:46:05] world and live in it in other words when
[1:46:08] Satan offers you a word that's full of
[1:46:10] problem you take that you create a new
[1:46:13] word out of it
[1:46:15] you said I will not take the sickness
[1:46:17] that you're giving me I will create
[1:46:19] healing in myself
[1:46:23] you you say I'm not saved I take the
[1:46:27] word and create saving with it
[1:46:30] that's what the children of God are made
[1:46:33] to do
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:35] we are not made to lose our minds and go
[1:46:38] under what am I going to do now what's
[1:46:41] the word for
[1:46:42] if God brought their creation by the
[1:46:45] word how are the children of God going
[1:46:47] to bring in terms of circumstances
[1:46:52] no we want uh we want to go read the the
[1:46:56] seven steps to uh
[1:46:59] fixing ourselves
[1:47:01] the 10 steps to the deliverance and the
[1:47:06] 12th step two how to fix our
[1:47:08] relationships
[1:47:09] what are you doing
[1:47:12] what are you doing
[1:47:14] don't walk away from the only thing that
[1:47:17] can save you right
[1:47:19] say the word is good enough well no
[1:47:21] matter what
[1:47:22] say the word is good enough no matter
[1:47:24] what you bring it to me I have the word
[1:47:28] to change it and give it back to you
[1:47:30] you'll be that and I say this that's the
[1:47:33] extension of God's word when you go out
[1:47:36] into the world somebody brings you their
[1:47:38] trouble you're not supposed to head to
[1:47:40] the trouble you take the trouble and
[1:47:42] create a new word for them
[1:47:44] [Music]
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:48] why you have been given the power and I
[1:47:52] say this morning use it
[1:47:54] don't walk around and people somebody
[1:47:57] comes with frustration and oh my you
[1:48:00] it's easy to just pile on it they say I
[1:48:02] know I know me too
[1:48:10] that's what we often do
[1:48:12] but if you could just stop one moment
[1:48:14] and say listen I have been given a power
[1:48:18] to create a new world to create a new
[1:48:21] circumstance to change the atmosphere I
[1:48:24] can take that I can take you your
[1:48:27] requests I can take whatever you're
[1:48:29] going through it and speak the word and
[1:48:31] we'll create something new for you
[1:48:33] that's the power for children of God
[1:48:38] oh my
[1:48:41] and now he says
[1:48:46] we'll continue tonight so just forgive
[1:48:49] me I'm still on the introduction
[1:48:53] and then he says
[1:48:55] a quick look at those scriptures which
[1:48:59] were involved in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:00] overcoming will bring you out
[1:49:03] the truth of the position Matthew 4 says
[1:49:08] wherein Jesus is tempted of the devil he
[1:49:12] overcame the personal Temptation Of
[1:49:14] Satan by the word and by the word alone
[1:49:20] now who could have just said by the word
[1:49:23] he wants you to be certain it's by the
[1:49:26] word and by the word alone don't add
[1:49:29] anything to it don't take it away that's
[1:49:31] what we do all the time the word is
[1:49:33] given to you you add a little bit and
[1:49:35] you do you know you make it and then it
[1:49:38] doesn't work you wonder why it didn't
[1:49:39] work the word is given to you you take
[1:49:42] away and you wonder why it doesn't work
[1:49:43] take it as he gave it
[1:49:46] speak it like he's giving it to you
[1:49:48] don't add anything don't say my
[1:49:51] circumstance is special no he said it is
[1:49:54] good enough
[1:49:54] [Music]
[1:49:56] it says in each of this three uh major
[1:50:00] trial that correspond exactly to the
[1:50:03] Temptation Of The Garden of Eden now he
[1:50:06] sums it up everything Brothers if you
[1:50:09] could put it I'm okay with it just put
[1:50:10] it he says in he says the lust of the
[1:50:14] flesh the last of the eyes and the pride
[1:50:17] of life it says Jesus overcame by the
[1:50:20] word so he's telling you as humanly as
[1:50:24] we can speak all of our our trials all
[1:50:27] of our Temptations are included in this
[1:50:30] three
[1:50:32] so he's he's sum it all up he says if I
[1:50:36] add All That You Are everything they'll
[1:50:38] ever come across all that you can come
[1:50:41] across he says he overcame by the word
[1:50:46] Eve fell
[1:50:48] to the personal Temptation Of Satan by
[1:50:52] failing to use the word
[1:50:54] so the the the the the the the what we
[1:50:57] need to capture from what he's saying
[1:50:59] here is
[1:51:00] that they really what the devil's final
[1:51:04] uh uh uh conclusion of you what he's
[1:51:07] trying to do to you it's just trying to
[1:51:09] get you to move from the word
[1:51:12] nothing else if it could just get you to
[1:51:15] move off the word if we can just get you
[1:51:18] to if we can introduce just a little bit
[1:51:21] of that way you could say I don't know
[1:51:22] if the word will do it that's enough for
[1:51:24] him
[1:51:26] but oh if we can stand steadfast
[1:51:29] unmovable on the word of God and know
[1:51:31] that whatever my situation is God is
[1:51:35] overcome for me
[1:51:36] and then I says and Adam fell in direct
[1:51:40] Disobedience to the word so whether it
[1:51:43] be this side or that side it's too by
[1:51:45] the word but Jesus overcame by the word
[1:51:48] and right now it says let me say this to
[1:51:52] you let me say that the only way
[1:51:56] to be an overcomer also it is the only
[1:52:02] let me say that this is the only way to
[1:52:05] be an overcomer
[1:52:06] also it is the only way that we can uh
[1:52:12] that we can if we are Overcomers because
[1:52:15] the word can fail
[1:52:22] people move and they they are okay
[1:52:26] to stand up on things that the devil
[1:52:29] can you use at any time
[1:52:35] I don't want to build my life on that
[1:52:38] you know why people are afraid that if
[1:52:42] you say something
[1:52:44] and you don't have the move and
[1:52:46] everything then it's not right
[1:52:49] that's not true
[1:52:50] if what we are saying is the word then
[1:52:53] we have nothing to worry about
[1:52:57] then I'm not putting myself out there
[1:52:59] I'm putting the word
[1:53:01] I don't I'm not building a reputation
[1:53:04] for myself I'm putting the word
[1:53:06] and if we are wrong we humble ourselves
[1:53:09] to the word
[1:53:11] so the word becomes the center thing of
[1:53:15] our Gravity the things that moves Us in
[1:53:17] and out and and we can walk oh my the
[1:53:20] children of Israel when God called uh
[1:53:23] Joshua to come and re and and take the
[1:53:25] children of Israel past Jordan the
[1:53:27] prophet will tell us that the word had
[1:53:29] to go first he says that the priest God
[1:53:32] will line up the priest and they will
[1:53:34] have them put the the their Ark of the
[1:53:36] Covenant and the children of Israel will
[1:53:39] send a certain distance why because he
[1:53:42] never wanted them to be confused who was
[1:53:45] doing the work
[1:53:46] he won and he says the priest's feet
[1:53:48] will touch the water first with the Ark
[1:53:51] of the Covenant on there and as they
[1:53:53] touch the water the water will be parted
[1:53:56] and you will go in you will pick up a
[1:53:59] revelation a stone under there something
[1:54:02] that is hidden under there that you will
[1:54:05] keep as a memorial of what God did for
[1:54:07] you no today we want to run before the
[1:54:10] word we want to do this with the word we
[1:54:14] want our own reputation to go that's not
[1:54:16] going to work what God wants us to do is
[1:54:18] to let the word go before us because
[1:54:21] it's the word that overcomes for us
[1:54:26] he says
[1:54:28] so let me say this
[1:54:30] he says this
[1:54:34] now notice again
[1:54:36] how Jesus overcame
[1:54:39] the world system of religion
[1:54:42] when it was repeatedly repeatedly
[1:54:45] budget by the Theologian of his day
[1:54:49] he constantly applied the word he expect
[1:54:52] the the respect only what the father
[1:54:55] given him to speak
[1:54:57] there was not a time when the world was
[1:55:01] not uttered utterly in confusion in
[1:55:04] confused by his wisdom for it was the
[1:55:08] wisdom of God
[1:55:10] it says in his own personal life
[1:55:17] contending with himself
[1:55:20] I want you to listen to this Jesus
[1:55:22] contending with himself
[1:55:24] he overcame by obedience
[1:55:27] through the word of God
[1:55:30] you say Jesus contending with himself
[1:55:34] yes brother
[1:55:37] remember we said last time the high
[1:55:40] priest of your confession
[1:55:42] everything that you go through he had
[1:55:48] I thought about the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:55:51] yeah he is but when I'm calls it is the
[1:55:53] greatest victory
[1:55:57] he said father
[1:55:58] I see your plan
[1:56:01] but is there a way
[1:56:03] that I could step aside from the word
[1:56:06] and let this God pass by me
[1:56:09] but he said nevertheless
[1:56:11] let it be not my will but your will be
[1:56:14] done
[1:56:15] so after he contended with himself he
[1:56:18] placed himself right back in the word he
[1:56:20] said your will be done
[1:56:23] in other words he was stripped of any
[1:56:26] power
[1:56:28] any other means by which any other
[1:56:31] ability any other because if he went by
[1:56:34] his own ability you wouldn't have never
[1:56:36] been able to come in so he had to use
[1:56:39] something that when he gives it to you
[1:56:41] you can do the same thing and the only
[1:56:44] thing that could do that was the word
[1:56:51] he says this in Hebrews he says who in
[1:56:54] the days of his flesh when he had
[1:56:56] offered our prayers and supplication was
[1:56:59] strong crying
[1:57:01] it is unto him that was able to save him
[1:57:04] from Death from from death and and and
[1:57:07] and heard uh and heard in that in that
[1:57:12] he feared he says though he was a son
[1:57:15] yet Elaine obedience by the things which
[1:57:17] he suffered and being made perfect
[1:57:20] being made perfect he became the author
[1:57:24] of Eternal salvation unto them that obey
[1:57:29] him
[1:57:31] says what was he obedient to
[1:57:36] the word of God
[1:57:40] it's so simple
[1:57:42] but yet we miss it a million miles
[1:57:46] when Matthew was talking to him last
[1:57:48] time he mentioned we have but when them
[1:57:51] will say yes Jesus
[1:57:54] after his strip of all things
[1:57:57] he goes through the cross
[1:57:59] by a prophecy of a backslider prophet
[1:58:04] that's what he uses
[1:58:06] you couldn't find one
[1:58:11] no because it wasn't about the prophet
[1:58:13] it was about the word
[1:58:15] if that Prophet spoke by God inspiration
[1:58:18] it didn't matter it was the word of God
[1:58:21] so let he goes to show you that it
[1:58:24] doesn't matter how low it is God will
[1:58:27] still honor his word
[1:58:30] don't we have enough proof don't we have
[1:58:33] enough to walk
[1:58:35] to walk why do we step aside why do we
[1:58:37] struggle with ourselves why do we wonder
[1:58:39] why do we go aside here is proving over
[1:58:43] and I can go over and over again and
[1:58:45] continue to hammer the same he's keeping
[1:58:48] saying it's the word don't get the
[1:58:50] emotion don't we'll concentrate on this
[1:58:52] don't concentrate on that come back to
[1:58:54] the word come back to the word why
[1:58:56] because that's the overcoming formula
[1:58:59] blueprint that we have been ended on
[1:59:03] now listen to this it says now
[1:59:06] paragraph 366 it says 360-6 it says now
[1:59:10] down
[1:59:12] there will be no one person who will sit
[1:59:16] on the turn with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:19] unless he has been living that word
[1:59:28] your prayers your fasting your
[1:59:31] perseverance no matter what you present
[1:59:34] to God none of that will gain you the
[1:59:38] privilege of sitting on that throne
[1:59:43] that's why I spend a little bit of time
[1:59:45] just trying to show
[1:59:48] it's not what we come up with it's not
[1:59:51] anything it's where you will beat into
[1:59:54] the word you will say
[1:59:56] as simple as that
[1:59:58] and then it says
[2:00:00] it says it will be granted only through
[2:00:03] the word bride
[2:00:06] word bride
[2:00:08] it says as the Throne of the king he
[2:00:12] shared with the queen because she is
[2:00:14] United went to him so only they who are
[2:00:20] off that word
[2:00:22] off that word
[2:00:25] even as he is off that word will share
[2:00:28] the throne
[2:00:29] and let me say this it's important we
[2:00:33] realize why this is very important that
[2:00:36] we overcome by the word
[2:00:38] because remember part of the sitting of
[2:00:41] the turn the prophet will tell us this
[2:00:43] Throne is only given to the Overcomers
[2:00:47] and and and the only way to overcome the
[2:00:51] the purpose for the overcoming is God is
[2:00:54] trying to build a character in you that
[2:00:57] is fit for you to be sitting on the
[2:00:59] throne if you don't ever overcome then
[2:01:02] you don't have the character it says
[2:01:04] character doesn't come by uh uh uh it's
[2:01:08] not a gift it's a it says character it's
[2:01:11] something we gain by going through
[2:01:13] something
[2:01:15] it's an experience it's something that
[2:01:17] you you go through God is not looking
[2:01:20] for some uh uh uh uh a baby to sit upon
[2:01:24] the throne he's looking for a mature
[2:01:26] bride somebody with an understanding
[2:01:28] somebody who knows what it means to be
[2:01:31] defeated but it means he knows what it
[2:01:33] means to be overcomer you you you're not
[2:01:36] gonna sit on the throne with no idea
[2:01:38] what it means to be overcome then those
[2:01:41] that you're going to be judging will
[2:01:42] come back and say tell me when you
[2:01:44] overcame do you know what it means to be
[2:01:46] in my situation so it has to take
[2:01:49] somebody who has been in the situation
[2:01:51] of those that will come before the
[2:01:53] throne and that has also been on the
[2:01:55] other side to say I know what it means
[2:01:57] to be in your situation but I used to
[2:02:00] work to overcome it
[2:02:04] we look for the adoptions of sun and
[2:02:08] adoption is only based on characters
[2:02:14] obedience to the word
[2:02:16] there's no place where it says well if
[2:02:19] you just been good
[2:02:21] it should have been this no it's always
[2:02:24] attached to the obedience to the word
[2:02:27] it's not looking for a baby to sit on
[2:02:29] the throne God is looking for immature
[2:02:32] bride someone who's battle tested
[2:02:36] somebody who knows who has the scars who
[2:02:40] knows what it means to go through battle
[2:02:42] and Gary as it says it says and if the
[2:02:45] children and then if children then Heirs
[2:02:47] of God and join that with Christ if we
[2:02:50] be that we suffer with him we may also
[2:02:52] be glorified together I reckon that the
[2:02:55] suffering of the present time is not
[2:02:57] whether to be compared with the glory
[2:02:58] that we shall be revealing US unless we
[2:03:01] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[2:03:04] it says you have to suffer to reign
[2:03:08] the reason for this is that character
[2:03:12] simply is never made without suffering
[2:03:16] oh my
[2:03:18] not a free gift
[2:03:19] is made through suffering
[2:03:22] and then he says character is a victory
[2:03:26] not a gift a man without character
[2:03:29] cannot Reign because power apart from
[2:03:33] character is satanic but Power with
[2:03:36] character is fit to rule
[2:03:43] now we understand the requirement for
[2:03:45] the throne
[2:03:46] is we need some character development
[2:03:50] and that's why the surgery say thank you
[2:03:52] not strange this trial affection that
[2:03:55] comes upon you
[2:03:56] but to punish you it's not God is mad at
[2:03:59] you but it's molding you into something
[2:04:02] God is wanting you to sit on the throne
[2:04:05] and let me say this the more the trial
[2:04:07] the more you need it so you have to be
[2:04:09] on the throne every time what if we were
[2:04:12] to look at everything that happened to
[2:04:13] us and says my I'm getting close to the
[2:04:16] throne
[2:04:21] I'm just saying
[2:04:25] you see what human Minds does to you
[2:04:28] they always thinks you're the opposite
[2:04:30] way you always mean I must have done
[2:04:33] something wrong I must have done
[2:04:35] something wrong I might sit down what if
[2:04:37] you can look at your sins hey oh I'm
[2:04:40] getting to the throne this is the path
[2:04:42] that he stating before me he's getting
[2:04:44] ready for that place I will use this
[2:04:47] experience for somebody who will need it
[2:04:49] this is for me to go through so I can
[2:04:51] help somebody else this is for me to go
[2:04:54] through so when I sit on that Throne I
[2:04:56] am a righteous judge
[2:04:59] I can just be I can judge people
[2:05:01] righteously
[2:05:04] be righteous if you have no idea what
[2:05:06] righteousness means
[2:05:07] or if you've never been through it
[2:05:13] oh my isn't the word beautiful
[2:05:18] and then it says and since he put us to
[2:05:21] share
[2:05:22] even is thrown on the same basis that he
[2:05:25] overcame and sat down with his father's
[2:05:28] Throne then we have to overcome to situa
[2:05:32] not there's no other way around it's the
[2:05:35] only way we have to overcome to sit with
[2:05:38] him and it says and the little temporary
[2:05:41] suffering that we go through now is not
[2:05:44] worthy to be compared with the
[2:05:46] tremendous Glory that will be revealing
[2:05:49] us when he comes it says oh what
[2:05:52] treasure are laid up for those who are
[2:05:54] willing to enter into his kingdom
[2:05:57] through much tribulation
[2:06:02] we this Christian life is not called to
[2:06:06] be a bed of ease
[2:06:08] where everything is good and we get
[2:06:11] along just fine and someone speaks you
[2:06:14] understand oftentimes somebody could say
[2:06:16] something that they didn't mean any harm
[2:06:18] and somebody gets offended
[2:06:23] it's full of valleys and mountains and
[2:06:26] all those things but you have to
[2:06:28] understand that the totality of those
[2:06:30] things is so that God will place you
[2:06:33] will build you up so you could be ready
[2:06:36] for what he has to do
[2:06:39] if the musician could come
[2:06:46] we read this last time the prophet said
[2:06:52] see
[2:06:54] God could not push you through a little
[2:06:57] pipe
[2:06:58] put you out on the other end and then
[2:07:01] say blessed is he not overcometh now
[2:07:05] that makes more sense right now
[2:07:08] so sometimes you have to go all the way
[2:07:10] around to say the same thing
[2:07:15] you had nothing to overcome
[2:07:17] he just pushed you through but you've
[2:07:20] got to make decisions for yourself
[2:07:22] I have to make decisions for myself in
[2:07:26] doing that we show our faith and respect
[2:07:29] to God
[2:07:31] we'll continue this afternoon
[2:07:36] but when I'm says this I want to end
[2:07:38] with this
[2:07:41] it says now Jesus told us how to do it
[2:07:45] to overcome means to stand a test
[2:07:49] that's right
[2:07:51] like the sense of all dead like Jesus
[2:07:53] did amidst of all the enemy he stood the
[2:07:56] test
[2:07:56] it says everything he was tested against
[2:07:59] he stood he stood it and the face of
[2:08:02] sickness he became
[2:08:04] a him being the Messiah he healed them
[2:08:06] in the face of death he brought back
[2:08:09] life in the face of Calvary his own
[2:08:13] death he defeated it by surrendering
[2:08:16] himself why by the what he says why by
[2:08:20] the word says you destroyed this Temple
[2:08:23] and I'll raise it up again in three days
[2:08:25] the word said so see in the presence of
[2:08:28] death he defeated it he overcame death
[2:08:32] in the presence of hell and he defeated
[2:08:35] hell and overcame it yes
[2:08:37] he says in the presence of the Grave he
[2:08:40] overcame the grave of why all by the
[2:08:44] word in humility
[2:08:46] it says oh my
[2:08:49] there's a real man
[2:08:51] there's one to make your example
[2:08:55] he defeated everything overcame it
[2:08:59] you know the world has a very skewed
[2:09:03] definition of a man
[2:09:06] is one who can provide his own bread and
[2:09:09] who can work until his fingers fall off
[2:09:12] and do everything by himself and don't
[2:09:14] help him if your help him isn't you know
[2:09:16] his men would comes a little bit down
[2:09:19] and he just needs to be you know like a
[2:09:22] just like a brick you know never get
[2:09:24] tired never do anything never Desiring
[2:09:29] but let me say this
[2:09:31] a real man to God
[2:09:34] is one who completely relies upon God
[2:09:38] for everything
[2:09:41] how many believe Jesus was real man
[2:09:45] we read it here
[2:09:47] he relied on God
[2:09:50] 100 percent
[2:09:54] 100 percent
[2:09:58] what is that even equal to you
[2:10:00] like he woke up he wanted to take breath
[2:10:03] he relied on God I mean
[2:10:05] I don't even know how to get it in my
[2:10:07] own life but in everything it did he
[2:10:11] relied on God but one of them says in
[2:10:13] perfect Faith he relied on what God made
[2:10:16] him what the scripture said he was
[2:10:27] three of us rely 100 percent of God now
[2:10:30] if we're going to be Overcomers we need
[2:10:32] to really take a deep look within
[2:10:35] ourselves because we are in the battle
[2:10:38] and and the reason why we may not be
[2:10:41] making progress as we should is because
[2:10:43] of this little things
[2:10:45] and I'm not here trying to preach the
[2:10:47] seals and the opening and the whole
[2:10:49] because all of that if he doesn't
[2:10:51] translate into this it's not needful
[2:10:54] if this cannot solve our human problems
[2:10:58] one with another to cause us to sit down
[2:11:01] and talk our differences over to cause
[2:11:04] us to look at one another differently to
[2:11:06] cause us to solve our human problem how
[2:11:09] are we going to get over there
[2:11:12] what are the seals for
[2:11:16] this is done so it could be translated
[2:11:19] into that power remember we read
[2:11:22] brahmanam says he spoke it was the
[2:11:25] wisdom of God and it was confusion to
[2:11:27] them
[2:11:28] I think we need to speak confusion to
[2:11:30] the world but it tells you something you
[2:11:33] speak something totally different that
[2:11:36] creates a new something and the whole
[2:11:38] confused about it the word is made to
[2:11:42] swallow up remember there was nothing
[2:11:44] everything that existed came from the
[2:11:47] word
[2:11:50] it was given Jesus came to take your sin
[2:11:53] so he can give you righteousness and in
[2:11:57] doing that he imparted some of that same
[2:11:59] attribute to you
[2:12:02] you have a problem swallow up your
[2:12:04] problem bring out some righteousness out
[2:12:07] of you it's somewhere in there I believe
[2:12:10] by the word of God it's somewhere if it
[2:12:13] wasn't in there you wouldn't have been
[2:12:14] sitting here this morning
[2:12:16] you're sitting here because it's
[2:12:18] somewhere in it's calling out and we'll
[2:12:21] get to that tonight it's calling out and
[2:12:23] often time it's good enough for the word
[2:12:26] we fill it up with all kinds of things
[2:12:28] we fill it out with our own knowledge
[2:12:30] where the works and whether this and
[2:12:32] with that we're failing to understand
[2:12:34] that it's calling out for more of God
[2:12:37] foreign
[2:12:39] I say this morning
[2:12:41] let the world take preeminence in our
[2:12:44] lives isn't that the purpose why he
[2:12:46] revealed himself those are not three
[2:12:48] separate purposes he reveal so he can
[2:12:51] come and have preeminence by having
[2:12:52] praying preeminence then he can take us
[2:12:55] right back to what we were in the
[2:12:57] beginning God bless you it's all
[2:12:59] standing this morning
[2:13:00] [Applause]

[2:17:27] and he could do the same with me
[2:17:32] he could take a register like I am
[2:17:35] and show me a righteous path
