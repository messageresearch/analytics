[35:47] let's flip over to John chapter 12 we're
[35:51] going to read verse 32.
[35:58] foreign
[36:05] if I be lifted up from the earth will
[36:08] draw all men unto me
[36:11] let's pray
[36:15] we bless your name Lord
[36:19] [Music]
[36:22] because of your love you will you've
[36:24] allowed us to be gathering your house
[36:26] tonight
[36:30] we are conscience that none of us made
[36:32] any such effort to be here tonight
[36:36] but it's your goodness and your grace
[36:39] towards us
[36:41] and because of that we want to make our
[36:44] hearts available
[36:46] that you may speak to us yourself
[36:52] because we know that the words of men
[36:55] cannot help another
[36:58] but your word is sufficient
[37:01] come and abide with us in the name of
[37:05] Jesus Christ amen amen
[37:09] I have your seats
[37:14] I believe we are happy to be gathering
[37:16] the house of God
[37:22] it's a great privilege for us to be at
[37:25] the service of Our Lord
[37:26] uh
[37:30] when I was getting ready for this
[37:33] service I was telling brother
[37:36] that the devil fought me greatly
[37:41] you should be nearest
[37:47] benediction I thank the Lord because
[37:49] many times when the devil is fighting
[37:51] like this the means behind is a blessing
[37:53] uh
[37:58] so since yesterday when Brother David
[38:01] asked me to to come in and preach
[38:03] tonight well come she tell him
[38:10] and when I because I was at home I was
[38:13] not doing anything so I started praying
[38:15] and meditating so God can Inspire
[38:17] something to me
[38:21] and right after that I started feeling
[38:24] some violent headaches
[38:29] [Music]
[38:33] I went to bed about 1am
[38:36] is
[38:39] I woke up around 5 a.m 5 30 a.m
[38:44] and even this morning I still had
[38:46] headaches
[38:48] I even try to to take my blood pressure
[38:52] it was a little bit higher
[39:00] the devil wanted me to call by the David
[39:03] and tell him is there a way I can get
[39:05] off of this is
[39:09] I told him at the service of the Lord if
[39:12] if it would require for me to fall at
[39:15] the pulpit I will
[39:17] it should be needed and I thank the lord
[39:21] it's happened to me many times like this
[39:25] I was coming to the PAW Patrol
[39:30] and all I know is every time I go down I
[39:33] feel I feel I'm not sick anymore
[39:36] and I believe the same thing will happen
[39:39] tonight
[39:40] [Music]
[39:47] as I was meditating I was telling
[39:49] brother Billy in the back I didn't know
[39:51] how to title my my
[39:53] thoughts
[39:55] but from the scripture we just read
[40:01] in John chapter 12 32.
[40:09] I want to speak on how can Jesus still
[40:12] attract today
[40:16] because he said said if I'll be lifted
[40:19] up
[40:21] I will draw all men unto me
[40:24] Jesus
[40:27] Jesus has to be lifted up so he can draw
[40:30] all men unto him
[40:33] and that's what he said in his word
[40:37] and he has to continue to draw people
[40:43] he has to continue to draw people to his
[40:46] word
[40:51] and we know that in the beginning when
[40:53] God created man
[40:59] God placed them in the garden and
[41:01] everything was perfect
[41:04] and they were only walking by the word
[41:07] of God
[41:11] and as long as they were in the word of
[41:13] God
[41:14] everything was perfect
[41:27] because he had attributes that he wanted
[41:29] to manifest
[41:44] a person
[41:46] he couldn't have been a savior unless
[41:49] there was someone to say you don't call
[41:51] Adam
[41:53] so when Adam and Eve left the position
[41:56] the word position
[42:00] when they they went away from the word
[42:06] said that God had a three-fold purpose
[42:12] that in his three-fold purpose
[42:16] he wanted to express himself
[42:20] remember he wanted to express himself
[42:25] and as this great God Spirit
[42:28] music
[42:31] he couldn't Express himself through his
[42:33] population
[42:35] to the humanity
[42:39] remember so he created himself a body
[42:44] the body of our Lord Jesus
[42:49] he came to dwell in that flesh to
[42:52] express himself
[42:55] to show us who he was
[43:00] to show us how he was
[43:05] to express to us the love that God had
[43:09] for Humanity because you remember that
[43:12] God himself those are pretty children
[43:16] fullness of of uh deity
[43:20] he came to dwell in Jesus Christ
[43:24] to express himself foreign
[44:20] according to the very definition of
[44:23] Isaiah
[44:24] Emmanuel
[44:26] the son is Emmanuel God With Us
[44:32] is
[44:34] God who came to express and reveal
[44:36] himself towards us
[44:39] and when he was Jesus was ready to leave
[44:43] the Earth
[44:44] that's when we read the book of John
[44:48] he began to speak to his disciples
[44:52] and I said let not your heart be
[44:54] troubled
[44:56] believe in God believe also in me
[45:00] it was really truly the the uh uh to his
[45:05] disciples
[45:08] now there were some in the disciples
[45:11] that were still a little bit confused
[45:12] like Philip conscious
[45:15] when he said believe in God believe also
[45:18] in me
[45:21] he said my father and I we are one
[45:26] Phillip he said just show us the father
[45:29] and I will suffice
[45:34] and he would say Philip I've been with
[45:36] you so long and you don't know who I am
[45:38] is
[45:42] and Jesus knew that he had fulfilled the
[45:45] first the the the first purpose of this
[45:47] threefold purpose
[45:49] and then he made a promise
[45:52] that I will not leave you comfortless
[45:56] I will come to you
[46:15] [Music]
[46:27] because he had to fulfill the second
[46:29] purpose of the threefold purpose
[46:39] it was God wanting to have preeminence
[46:42] over his people
[46:45] preeminence over his church
[46:56] because he wanted to continue his work
[46:59] through the bride but Israel said to put
[47:03] ahead
[47:05] because he wanted to bring this right to
[47:08] be like a prisoner
[47:13] who only walks according to the
[47:15] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[47:19] because he says yet a little while the
[47:22] world will see me no more
[47:24] the world will not see him anymore
[47:31] there is a promise for us in our
[47:34] everyday life
[47:36] we have to see Jesus
[47:39] in our work of every day
[47:42] we have to see Jesus
[47:45] when we don't see Jesus we are ask
[47:49] ourselves a question some noodles
[47:53] are we in that second fault purpose that
[47:56] he was trying to fulfill
[47:59] because he promised
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] he brings it to pass always
[48:16] the word always comes to a fulfillment
[48:21] and today that Jesus has changed the
[48:24] form
[48:26] he said when I'll be lifted up
[48:30] I will draw man unto me
[48:36] he needed you and I in order to attract
[48:39] men to him
[48:45] God doesn't have other hands except your
[48:47] hands
[48:49] God doesn't have either feet except your
[48:52] feet
[48:54] God doesn't have any other mouth except
[48:57] your mouth
[49:00] so God is counting on us
[49:04] to attract men unto him
[49:32] it's a sufficient sermon to attract men
[49:36] unto him
[49:39] foreign
[50:02] how was Adam and Eve in the beginning
[50:06] and we know that that is going to pass
[50:09] in the same time
[50:12] but in order for us to go through to
[50:14] that place
[50:17] we have in our time
[50:21] the Jews
[50:24] as we are living the second purpose
[50:27] where God is having preeminence of his
[50:29] people
[50:32] to prepare us so we can be uh give
[50:37] ourselves as instruments
[50:42] to prepare us so we can give ourselves
[50:45] completely to God
[50:47] so God can use us
[50:50] to attract men unto himself
[50:57] um the marriage of the Lamb
[51:00] paragraph 133
[51:07] it says did you ever notice what the
[51:10] real church is supposed to do it is in
[51:14] the Old Testament
[51:15] when they had it when they had the
[51:18] sacrifice
[51:22] they killed one bird and they put the
[51:25] blood upon another
[51:27] company more
[51:32] the dead mate and they flew across the
[51:36] Earth
[51:40] spreading the blood of the Dead mate the
[51:44] correctly David
[51:47] when the church becomes the real bride
[51:50] of Jesus Christ
[51:54] she's carrying the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:57] with her
[52:03] sprinkling it up on the ground calling
[52:07] holy holy holy unto the Lord it is
[52:16] every bit of her will be of God
[52:22] her whole makeup will be of God
[52:27] you can't expect nothing else it is
[52:33] that's why people come to church too
[52:36] that was
[52:39] that's the reason why people come to
[52:41] church
[53:05] we went from the we went to the body
[53:10] and we're going to the body form or
[53:13] through the word form
[53:14] and we come to church
[53:17] so that this word
[53:20] that we are listening to
[53:22] the word that God has given us
[53:27] then that he would take us from this
[53:29] Mortal body
[53:31] this body of sin
[53:33] so he can bring us to the body word
[53:39] so he can bring our body to The
[53:42] Obedience of the word who can definitely
[53:45] imagine so we can become in the image of
[53:48] Christ
[53:49] so we can express Christ
[53:53] it says that's why that's why people
[53:55] come to church
[53:57] not to play cards play poker
[54:02] dance in the basement
[54:07] things like that
[54:09] that's for the world
[54:14] and we'll never be able to compare with
[54:16] them
[54:18] and shame on us sort of trying to that
[54:21] are trying it no death your pressure
[54:24] we should preach the Holy Ghost in power
[54:28] and the resurrection of Christ
[54:33] we've got something they haven't got
[54:37] let us live it please
[54:40] not trying to copy after them
[54:44] we don't have to copy after the world
[54:47] we don't have to copy the nomination
[54:51] because we have something particular the
[54:54] new death of him that we have to live
[54:57] so we can be in the image of Christ
[55:01] that we may attract or or pull men unto
[55:05] him
[55:09] let us live it
[55:20] [Music]
[56:01] that's why we are no longer drawing
[56:05] but God is calling upon us tonight
[56:10] it's to consider our position
[56:15] but what God is here on Earth
[56:20] that God is living as the grace to meet
[56:24] this message
[56:27] not that we can live like simple morals
[56:31] [Music]
[56:32] not to imitate what the world is doing
[56:37] not to walk like the world is walking
[56:48] today the world is doing all that they
[56:51] can big things so they can attract
[56:53] people to themselves
[56:57] so they can attract Christians for
[57:01] Destruction
[57:07] to consecrate ourselves to God
[57:12] they're doing it so we don't have time
[57:15] to think about God
[57:23] someone can go to a football stadium
[57:28] he can be there for six hours supporting
[57:32] my contacts
[57:34] but if a preacher preaches more than two
[57:36] hours
[57:38] he starts to sleep
[57:40] he become annoyed
[57:44] that's already enough
[57:57] a lot about television
[58:00] foreign
[58:35] sometimes someone can spend the whole
[58:38] night on social media
[58:41] ask them to pray for 15 minutes
[58:44] it will fall asleep
[58:49] because the devil knows
[58:53] that God has a purpose for you
[59:41] we cannot overcome
[59:45] when we go in the same field as the
[59:48] devil
[59:49] we will never have overcoming Powers
[59:52] we're gonna be we're gonna be happy
[59:54] today
[59:55] and when we go out the devil takes us
[59:59] back
[1:00:00] we become sad we come next time we are
[1:00:05] happy we go back he takes us back
[1:00:09] but the only way so it doesn't take us
[1:00:13] back
[1:00:14] we consecrate ourselves to God
[1:00:22] that we may claim to God
[1:00:24] who made the promise to remember that he
[1:00:28] himself that he will come to form this
[1:00:31] sentence in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:34] to abide in US
[1:00:39] bring us to where we become we hunger
[1:00:42] and thirst
[1:00:45] if the true Christian Life
[1:00:47] and when we walk
[1:00:50] foreign
[1:01:09] [Music]
[1:01:29] you know
[1:01:32] if we go there I know he may give us the
[1:01:35] opportunity to hunt in his place media
[1:01:39] but he said when one of the men is a is
[1:01:42] an unbeliever is a infidel
[1:01:44] they went
[1:01:47] but the word went out but when I'm
[1:01:51] stayed in the car yeah
[1:01:57] he went and he presented himself on
[1:01:59] banks were the the my daddy's word
[1:02:03] can we go Hun
[1:02:05] he said yeah there's no problem
[1:02:09] he said oh I have my pre my pastor with
[1:02:12] me
[1:02:14] foreign
[1:02:39] it
[1:02:42] says I don't believe you preachers
[1:02:46] you you barking on the wrong tree
[1:02:50] expression said it's an expression that
[1:02:54] means that you are only Liars
[1:02:59] you talk about things you have no idea
[1:03:03] you said you see that mountain
[1:03:05] I was born up there it's about seven
[1:03:09] years
[1:03:12] I look everywhere
[1:03:14] I know there's nothing that looks like
[1:03:17] God
[1:03:20] told them
[1:03:24] he asked him about the palm tree said
[1:03:27] are you the one who planted that tree
[1:03:30] he said yeah I planted it about 40 years
[1:03:33] ago
[1:03:34] is it can I take a one one of the the
[1:03:37] apples
[1:03:39] took the Apple yeah and he started
[1:03:43] asking him a question
[1:03:45] foreign
[1:04:14] what is the intelligence
[1:04:18] because we know that the botanic life
[1:04:21] doesn't have intelligence
[1:04:23] but what intelligent tells tells the
[1:04:26] tree
[1:04:27] that when fall comes
[1:04:30] that it may hide his life
[1:04:49] he says among the preachers
[1:04:52] there is only one man
[1:04:55] if he was to come back here
[1:05:13] but that preacher came
[1:05:17] this woman couldn't even stand up
[1:05:21] her sister went to the meetings
[1:05:24] and as this preacher was preaching under
[1:05:28] the inspiration
[1:05:29] he told the sister
[1:05:32] that you have a handkerchief
[1:05:34] he has a little bit thing blue on it
[1:05:37] trying to Circle you have a sister who's
[1:05:40] dying of cancer
[1:05:42] that saith the Lord
[1:05:45] take the handkerchief and place it up on
[1:05:47] my sister and she shall be healed it is
[1:05:53] we heard such a noise coming from there
[1:05:58] and we thought that she passed away in
[1:06:01] the morning
[1:06:03] we went to to to uh to uh
[1:06:07] said
[1:06:26] is C and EF
[1:06:29] to me D you tell me
[1:06:31] what intelligence
[1:06:34] that would tell the life to come down on
[1:06:37] the roots
[1:06:40] and to come back during the Spring I
[1:06:44] will tell you let's tell you the
[1:06:47] intelligence that told me
[1:06:49] to say that say of the Lord that woman
[1:06:52] is here
[1:06:53] is that all you want to say to you
[1:07:06] the man gave his life to Christ why past
[1:07:10] can I stream it because he expressed
[1:07:13] Christ
[1:07:14] because he knew what he was talking
[1:07:17] about
[1:07:18] because Christ was manifested
[1:07:23] because today God doesn't just needs for
[1:07:27] us to talk but could not but our lives
[1:07:29] come set them like
[1:07:31] as the man who came in contact with him
[1:07:37] that the person may not just take our
[1:07:39] words
[1:07:41] but look at our lives
[1:07:44] that which we are
[1:07:47] and say I want to be like that person I
[1:07:51] want to be like that person
[1:07:53] says
[1:07:55] in the message
[1:07:57] Zacchaeus the businessman
[1:08:00] paragraph 152. it says hear me
[1:08:06] if you are really determined to see him
[1:08:16] you don't care what you have to go
[1:08:19] through with or how much criticism what
[1:08:23] other people say
[1:08:26] you want to see Jesus
[1:08:30] you'll do anything to see him
[1:08:33] you will wait your turn
[1:08:37] you'll do you'll do whatever your
[1:08:41] purpose to do
[1:08:44] just so you you get to see him
[1:08:47] the trouble today
[1:08:51] is today that there's not a thirst
[1:08:55] enough thirsting enough
[1:08:58] there's not enough thirst and hunger for
[1:09:01] for the people at least
[1:09:06] I believe the church ought to be a
[1:09:08] little more saltier than it is than what
[1:09:10] it is
[1:09:13] God creates a thirst
[1:09:15] salt is the savior
[1:09:18] if it if it's in contact
[1:09:22] but if the salt has lost his favor
[1:09:27] it's henceforth good for nothing
[1:09:30] but whatever but become an organization
[1:09:33] that's right
[1:09:36] but you've got to have the favor
[1:09:39] the savior is the salt the strength
[1:09:46] if a man sees Christ Living in you
[1:09:51] it will make him thirst to be like you
[1:09:56] it will make him see Jesus in you
[1:10:02] make him see God
[1:10:16] he needs every single one of us
[1:10:23] he needs us to manifest Christ
[1:10:31] every promise that God spoke for us
[1:10:36] I like the song that says that every
[1:10:39] promise in the book is mine
[1:10:42] that every every chapter every letter
[1:10:48] every promise is mine make a journal fit
[1:10:53] may God help us
[1:11:00] and to manifest Christ to the Dying
[1:11:03] World he says
[1:11:07] here is voice paragraph 102.
[1:11:13] CC
[1:11:20] is
[1:11:23] and when you get desperate about these
[1:11:26] things something will take place
[1:11:31] you are not desperate enough
[1:11:48] I go to Christian Life Tabernacle
[1:11:52] that's it
[1:11:54] but that's not enough
[1:12:00] it says
[1:12:03] he says you
[1:12:08] paragraph
[1:12:11] s
[1:12:14] and I belong to church and that that
[1:12:17] settles it
[1:12:19] but it has you have to be desperate
[1:12:22] about it you he says you have you have
[1:12:25] to really need God
[1:12:28] Jesus said
[1:12:32] blessed are they that do hunger
[1:12:35] and thirst after righteousness they
[1:12:37] shall be filled
[1:12:41] but as long as you are satisfied with
[1:12:44] the things of the world
[1:12:47] how can God ever speak to you
[1:12:59] God wants
[1:13:05] God wants to bring you to his image to
[1:13:08] his resemblance
[1:13:10] he wants to speak to you
[1:13:16] but you are too filled up with the
[1:13:19] things of the world
[1:13:22] that's what's the matter with us today
[1:13:27] we put all of our time on the things of
[1:13:31] the world
[1:13:32] the pleasures of the world
[1:13:37] and give no time to God
[1:13:41] it's true dunk now
[1:13:48] we find out that we find out that Isaiah
[1:13:51] got desperate aesthetically and he
[1:13:55] screamed
[1:13:56] and confess his sins
[1:13:59] he confessed the sins of the people
[1:14:03] and when he got through the confession
[1:14:07] he heard he heard of a noise up above
[1:14:11] him
[1:14:12] and when he looked up
[1:14:14] there was a chairman
[1:14:20] flying back and forth through the
[1:14:22] building
[1:14:25] Wings Over the face
[1:14:28] Wings over their feet
[1:14:31] and flying wings
[1:14:37] and crying
[1:14:40] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:15:12] and he changed him
[1:15:18] and God wants for us
[1:15:29] it's not a subject of how many
[1:15:32] demonstration of power we come up with
[1:15:38] or even the knowledge of the word that
[1:15:42] we have
[1:15:43] Metheny
[1:15:48] but it's the question of Christ really
[1:15:52] in us when we come back to ourselves
[1:15:57] LED prospects when when we look at our
[1:16:01] own lives internally
[1:16:08] when Christ said if I live you shall
[1:16:11] live also
[1:16:13] is it really valid for you
[1:16:18] am I living like Christ wants me to live
[1:16:26] can I say that Christ can draw the world
[1:16:30] through me
[1:16:31] it's an individual question says
[1:16:43] to accepting God's provided way at the
[1:16:46] end time
[1:16:48] I'm not going to try to be long tonight
[1:16:53] paragraph 174.
[1:16:57] he was speaking about the baby
[1:17:02] he said God gave to the baby
[1:17:05] the only way he can get what he needs is
[1:17:09] to cry
[1:17:18] knows God's provided ways the best way
[1:17:28] they know it says they know no better
[1:17:31] way for the baby to get what you want
[1:17:34] than to cry for it
[1:17:43] used to say the baby that Christ the
[1:17:46] loudest gets the best service
[1:17:48] that's about that that's about the way
[1:17:51] it is
[1:17:53] it means when we spend more time in
[1:17:56] prayer
[1:17:57] we receive more service
[1:18:00] he says
[1:18:04] that goes for that goes for the children
[1:18:07] of of the God's children
[1:18:11] I could I could I could parallel that
[1:18:14] for you
[1:18:21] a man gets up and chew and and say chew
[1:18:24] chew his gum foreign
[1:18:47] but if you don't why all right
[1:18:51] it's your will Lord
[1:18:54] if you want to give him the Holy Ghost
[1:18:57] if you want to heal me
[1:19:00] if you don't give me that it's your will
[1:19:03] yeah
[1:19:06] a man says that it's your will
[1:19:11] it says he says he's done he's done
[1:19:15] wrote his will out
[1:19:17] here is he says it's your will that's
[1:19:21] good
[1:19:23] it is it says this is his will all right
[1:19:28] and if you want me to if you want me to
[1:19:31] have it I'll have it but
[1:19:36] nevertheless if you don't do it why
[1:19:38] that's all right
[1:19:41] you will never get nowhere
[1:19:46] if you say that
[1:19:49] you will never get nowhere
[1:19:53] but let that one made get there
[1:19:56] and cry out
[1:19:59] like body Robinson
[1:20:02] he stopped in the middle of the
[1:20:04] cornfield
[1:20:06] he tried up he tied up his music he said
[1:20:09] Lord
[1:20:12] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when
[1:20:16] you come back
[1:20:18] you will find a pile of bones
[1:20:23] I'm going to stay here till I get it
[1:20:28] that's business
[1:20:57] and he will do that
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:57] you claim the promise he says
[1:22:03] when I see a promise in the Bible
[1:22:06] and it's God's word I love you yes
[1:22:12] then I just stay there and cry out
[1:22:16] till God gives it to me
[1:22:19] and he will do that
[1:22:22] to get me off of his hands hey man
[1:22:27] you you may get off God's uh you may get
[1:22:31] off God's hands
[1:22:33] and you continue to press and God will
[1:22:36] give it to you cry out to God God will
[1:22:40] give it to you
[1:22:42] he will do it
[1:22:45] so you get off his hands you see
[1:22:50] that would be in the natural
[1:22:54] but is wanting you to do that

[1:29:18] the great arm that's helped back
[1:29:22] the time so long will finally let go as
[1:29:26] church will move off from this Earth in

[1:30:28] with what's the time it's laid up
[1:30:30] for those who love him amen so we are
[1:30:35] trying to point
[1:30:37] our brother and sister
[1:30:40] to this great hour that's approaching us

[1:30:45] hearts burn
[1:30:49] we want to make ready
[1:30:53] one by one we go down the lane we just
[1:30:56] got through burying one from our midst
[1:31:00] our sister Bell
[1:31:04] going quickly according to her request
[1:31:07] so quick we couldn't get to her to pray
[1:31:09] with her
[1:31:11] but it was her request to go to see how
[1:31:13] good that you are
[1:31:15] to provide all the things that we desire

[1:31:43] their hearts together yes
[1:31:46] and as these tapes goes out
[1:31:49] to the
[1:31:50] the cities and the churches all out to
[1:31:54] the Nations around the world
[1:31:57] May ministering Brethren who has maybe
[1:32:00] once misunderstood understand now
[1:32:06] that thought Church might be prepared
[1:32:09] and now Lord who separated me from my
[1:32:12] mother
[1:32:14] who fed me all the days of my life
[1:32:17] has brought me to this hour
[1:32:21] by thy Grace feeling it was thy will
[1:32:24] that I should explain to the people
[1:32:28] why that I have acted and did the way I
[1:32:31] have done
[1:32:34] may it be in such a way that people will
[1:32:36] have a better understanding lord of the
[1:32:39] peculiarity
[1:32:42] of thy servants
[1:32:45] Grant these things father these
[1:32:48] scriptures and
[1:32:50] texts and words that we have written
[1:32:54] here through the week praying and
[1:32:56] studying
[1:32:58] may they fall on good ground ever where
[1:33:02] they are heard
[1:33:05] a ground that can hold them and nourish
[1:33:09] them
[1:33:12] and then all praise shall be given to
[1:33:14] thee
[1:33:15] while we asked it in Jesus name
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:33] Hallelujah
[1:33:35] I thought if
[1:33:37] if we were to write a
[1:33:40] a mission statement you know when a
[1:33:42] business or a company they have what
[1:33:44] they call a mission statement the
[1:33:46] purpose of our
[1:33:48] our company
[1:33:50] they call that a mission statement I
[1:33:53] thought what a mission statement tonight
[1:33:56] to have Christ Jesus so living out of us
[1:34:00] that it would draw all men to us
[1:34:03] and I love the question that brother
[1:34:06] Paul posed tonight in the wonderful way
[1:34:09] the Holy Spirit brought it
[1:34:12] the Holy Spirit changes your nature
[1:34:16] and if you love the world or the things
[1:34:18] of the world or having a tremendous
[1:34:21] trial with the things of the world
[1:34:25] and and the that you need the Holy
[1:34:29] Spirit
[1:34:30] you need the Nature changer you need him
[1:34:34] to make you like him because we know
[1:34:38] that's our hope if the same spirit that
[1:34:41] was in Christ Jesus dwell in US it'll
[1:34:43] Quicken our mortal body and a lot of
[1:34:47] people say well what's the the rain
[1:34:49] falls on the just in the unjust and how
[1:34:53] do I tell the difference well I like the
[1:34:56] way Paul put it if you go out and you
[1:34:58] get blessed and then you go back and
[1:35:00] you're back and then you go out and you
[1:35:02] get blessed and you go back in your back
[1:35:04] that's the rain falling on the unjust
[1:35:09] but when you've had that nature change
[1:35:11] that's right
[1:35:13] you know what I mean and you're not the
[1:35:16] same person you used to be yeah
[1:35:18] something's happens you know what's
[1:35:20] happening and you know it's come from
[1:35:22] the outside
[1:35:24] and you know he's done it
[1:35:26] amen then you got your candle lit oh and
[1:35:31] it's it's wonderful
[1:35:33] and and if it just really wonderful and
[1:35:38] he said if you don't don't quit
[1:35:41] cry out yes cry out Lord I want that
[1:35:46] Holy Spirit
[1:35:48] you know I want a nature change if I
[1:35:51] could just lay that so deep in you
[1:35:53] that's right I want to change your
[1:35:54] personality I want to change your heart
[1:35:57] I want to change your thinking I want
[1:35:59] the love of God shed abroad in My Heart
[1:36:02] by the Holy Ghost I want to have
[1:36:04] overcoming power I want to tell no to
[1:36:06] the enemy I want to love my brother but
[1:36:09] I want to I don't want to be bitter I
[1:36:11] want to be transformed
[1:36:13] into your enemies that's the spirit of
[1:36:15] God moving in you and working in you it
[1:36:19] can tell and his brother Paul preached I
[1:36:21] just thought that you know when he
[1:36:23] talked about that salt I felt like
[1:36:25] sitting at a table eating you know salt
[1:36:27] brings out the flavor right the Savor
[1:36:30] that's good it's good and others don't
[1:36:32] bring out the flavor
[1:36:34] Chuck the salt
[1:36:36] but you gotta sprinkle it
[1:36:40] you know what I mean having it on the
[1:36:42] table don't do no good you've got to
[1:36:44] spread it abroad good look that's the
[1:36:46] script the whole the love of God spread
[1:36:49] about abroad or sprinkled gripe salt
[1:36:53] abroad on all those people around you
[1:36:56] you can ask yourself do I have the Lord
[1:36:58] in me and is that nature changing me am
