[0:00] cry out for what he's listening for
[0:05] you know the scripture says in luke 18 8
[0:07] that when he comes will he
[0:09] find faith in the earth
[0:14] and god is listening for the sound
[0:18] of a people to cry out to them with his
[0:21] own word
[0:22] with faith attached to it that's the
[0:26] sound he's listening for
[0:27] that's the frequency that he's tuned to
[0:31] and when he hears his own word
[0:35] activated by faith that's an acceptable
[0:37] time
[0:41] you know it says in j it says in mark 11
[0:43] 24 therefore i say unto you whatsoever
[0:46] things you desire when you pray
[0:48] believe that you receive them
[0:51] and ye shall have them
[0:54] james said ye ask and receive not
[0:56] because you ask amiss
[0:58] and says in verse in chapter 5 of james
[1:00] is any sick among you
[1:02] let him call for the elders of the
[1:04] church and let them pray over him
[1:06] anointing him with oil in the name of
[1:08] the lord and the prayer
[1:09] of the elders the prayer of faith
[1:13] shall save the sick so you know as i was
[1:16] reading this it occurred to me that
[1:18] david
[1:18] recognized that there was an acceptable
[1:20] time
[1:21] for prayer a time when prayer was
[1:25] acceptable a time when it was effectual
[1:30] and it was when the cry of his people
[1:34] match what he is listening for
[1:37] then he can come on the scene
[1:41] you know so as we read psalm 69 this
[1:44] morning
[1:44] we won't read it all we'll just read the
[1:46] first 18 verses
[1:48] if you find yourself in an hour of
[1:50] desperation
[1:51] and sooner or later we all will
[1:55] will your prayer be in an acceptable
[1:57] time
[1:59] will it be what he's listening for
[2:04] psalm 34 15 says the eyes of the lord
[2:07] are upon the righteous and his ears are
[2:09] open unto their cry
[2:13] let's just read psalm 69 together we'll
[2:15] just read those first
[2:17] 18 verses it says save me o god for the
[2:21] waters are come in
[2:22] unto my soul i sink in deep mire
[2:26] where there is no standing i am come
[2:28] into deep waters where the floods
[2:30] overflow me
[2:32] i am weary of my crying my throat is
[2:35] dried mine eyes fail
[2:37] while i wait for my god they that hate
[2:40] me without a cause are more than the
[2:42] hairs of mine head
[2:43] they that would destroy me being mine
[2:46] enemies wrongfully
[2:47] are mighty then i restored that which i
[2:50] took not away
[2:51] oh god thou knowest my foolishness and
[2:54] my sins are not hid from thee
[2:57] let not them that wait on thee o lord
[3:00] god of hosts be ashamed for my sake
[3:03] let not those that seek thee be
[3:05] confounded for my sake
[3:07] o god of israel because for thy sake i
[3:10] have borne reproach
[3:12] shame hath covered my face i am become a
[3:15] stranger
[3:15] unto my brethren and an alien unto my
[3:18] mother's children
[3:19] for the zeal of thine house hath eaten
[3:22] me up
[3:22] and the reproaches of them that
[3:24] reproached thee are fallen upon me
[3:27] when i wept and chaste my soul with
[3:30] fasting
[3:30] that was to my reproach i made sackcloth
[3:34] also my garment and i became a proverb
[3:36] to them
[3:37] they that sit in the gates speak against
[3:40] me and i was the song of the drunkards
[3:43] but as for me my prayer is unto thee o
[3:46] lord
[3:46] in an acceptable time o god in the
[3:49] multitude of thy mercy
[3:51] hear me in the truth of thy salvation
[3:54] deliver me out of the mire and let me
[3:56] not sink
[3:57] let me be delivered from them that hate
[4:00] me and out of the deep waters
[4:02] let not the water flood overflow me
[4:04] neither let the deep swallow me up
[4:07] and let not the pit shut her mouth upon
[4:09] me
[4:10] hear me o lord for thy loving kindness
[4:12] is good
[4:13] turn unto me according to the multitude
[4:16] of thy tender mercies
[4:17] and hide not thy face from thy servant
[4:20] for i am in trouble
[4:21] hear me speedily draw nigh unto my soul
[4:25] and redeem it
[4:26] deliver me because of mine enemies amen

[37:37] past and
[37:39] about their place and their position
[37:42] father i asked this morning that you'd
[37:44] open their eyes that they may see
[37:46] themselves in you
[37:48] that they might understand that you love
[37:51] them that you paid a price for every
[37:53] evil that they ever done

[40:15] amen and believe that he'll make
[40:19] everything work together for good to
[40:21] them it loves him because he promised to
[40:23] amen
[40:30] for this melo
[40:34] king of salem priest of the most high
[40:37] god
[40:38] who met abraham returning from the
[40:40] slaughter of the kings
[40:42] and blessed him to whom also abraham
[40:46] gave a tenth part of all first
[40:49] being by interpretation king of
[40:53] righteousness and after that also
[40:56] king of salem which is
[41:01] king of peace let's read a little
[41:03] further
[41:04] without father without mother without
[41:08] the sin
[41:10] neither beginning of days or end of life
[41:14] but made liken to the son of god abideth
[41:17] the priest continuing
[41:22] think of this great person
[41:26] of how great this man must be
[41:32] and now the question is who
[41:35] is this man
[41:39] theologians has had different ideas but
[41:42] since the opening of the seven seals
[41:44] the mysterious book that's been
[41:47] mysterious to us
[41:49] according to revelations 10 1-7
[41:53] all the mysteries that's wrote in this
[41:56] book that's been
[41:57] hid down through the age of the
[42:00] reformers
[42:01] is supposed to be brought out into view
[42:04] by the angel of the last church age
[42:08] how many knows that's right amen that's
[42:10] right
[42:11] supposed to be brought all the mysteries
[42:14] of the mysterious book
[42:16] is to be revealed to the ladies
[42:19] messenger of that age seeing
[42:22] there is much dispute about this person
[42:26] and this subject i think it behooves
[42:30] just to break into it
[42:32] to find out who this is now there's
[42:34] several schools of thought
[42:36] on him one of the schools are
[42:39] claims he's just a myth
[42:42] he wasn't actually a person
[42:46] and the others says that it was a
[42:49] priesthood
[42:51] that was a male chesadec priesthood
[42:53] that's the most
[42:54] likely one that hold better to that side
[42:57] than the due to the other
[42:59] is because they say it was a priesthood
[43:03] it can't be that for
[43:06] in the fourth verse it says he was a
[43:09] person a man
[43:13] so in order to be a person he has to be
[43:15] a personality
[43:17] a man not a order
[43:20] but a person so he was not
[43:24] just a priesthood order neither was he a
[43:27] myth
[43:28] he was a person and
[43:31] the person is eternal
[43:35] if you notice he had no father
[43:38] he had no mother he had no time he ever
[43:41] began
[43:42] and he had no time he ever ended
[43:46] and ever who it was is still alive
[43:49] tonight
[43:51] because the bible said here that he had
[43:54] neither father nor mother beginning of
[43:58] days
[43:59] or ending of life so it would have to be
[44:03] an eternal person is that right
[44:08] an eternal person so it could only
[44:11] be one person that's god because he's
[44:15] the only one that's eternal
[44:17] god now in first timothy 6 15 and 16
[44:21] if you'd like to read that sometime i'd
[44:24] like for you to read it
[44:26] now the thing that i contend is that
[44:30] he was god
[44:34] because he's the only person that can be
[44:36] immortal
[44:38] and now god changing himself
[44:41] into person that's
[44:44] what he wants no father no mother no
[44:48] beginning in life no entering a days
[44:50] now we find in the scripture
[44:54] that many people teach us that three
[44:58] personalities in the godhead
[45:02] so you cannot have a personality
[45:05] without being a person it takes a person
[45:09] to make a personality
[45:12] a baptist minister a few weeks ago come
[45:15] up
[45:15] and to my house and said i like
[45:17] straightening out on the godhead
[45:18] sometime when he got
[45:19] time called me up brother i said i got
[45:22] time right now
[45:23] because i want to be straight and we lay
[45:25] aside everything else to do it
[45:27] he come up he said brother branham you
[45:30] teach that there is
[45:31] just one god i said yes sir
[45:35] he said well he said i believe there's
[45:37] one god
[45:38] but one god in three persons i said sir
[45:42] repeat that again he said one god
[45:46] in three persons i said where did you go
[45:49] to school
[45:51] and he told me a bible college i said i
[45:54] could believe that
[45:56] you cannot be a person without being a
[45:59] personality and if you're a personality
[46:02] you are a one personality to yourself
[46:06] your separate individual being
[46:10] and he said well the theologians can't
[46:11] even explain that
[46:13] i said it's by revelation
[46:16] and he said i can't accept revelation i
[46:18] said then
[46:19] is no way for god to ever get to you
[46:22] because
[46:22] it's hid from the eyes of wise and
[46:24] prudent and revealed to babes
[46:26] revealed revelation revealed to babes
[46:30] such
[46:30] as will accept it alone
[46:34] now said there'd be no way for god to
[46:35] get to you you've closed yourself off
[46:37] from him
[46:38] the whole bible is a revelation of god
[46:41] the whole church is built upon the
[46:43] revelation of god
[46:45] there's no other way to know god only by
[46:47] revelation
[46:48] to whom the son will reveal him
[46:50] revelation
[46:52] everything is revelation so to ex
[46:55] not to accept the revelation then you're
[46:58] just a cold theologian and
[46:59] there's no hope for you now
[47:02] now we find out that this person had no
[47:05] father no mother
[47:07] no beginning of days or ending of life
[47:11] it was god in marfan
[47:14] now the world the word comes the greek
[47:17] word means change
[47:18] was used changing himself in marfa
[47:23] from one person to one
[47:26] person the greek word there in martha
[47:28] means it was taken from the stage act
[47:31] that one person is changing his mask
[47:35] to make him some other character
[47:39] like in in school just recently i
[47:41] believe
[47:43] rebecca just before she graduated they
[47:46] had one of
[47:47] shakespeare's play and one young man
[47:51] had to change his clothes several times
[47:53] because he played
[47:54] two or three different parts but the
[47:56] same person
[47:58] he come out one time he was the villain
[48:01] and when he came out next time he was
[48:03] another character
[48:05] and now the greek word in marfa mean
[48:08] that he
[48:08] changed his mass and that's what
[48:12] god did it's the same god all the time
[48:17] god in the form of the father the the
[48:19] spirit
[48:20] the pillar of founder the same god was
[48:23] made flesh and dwelt among us
[48:25] in martha brought out so he could be
[48:28] seen and now that same god is a holy
[48:32] ghost father
[48:34] son holy well not three gods three
[48:37] offices
[48:38] three acts of the one
[48:41] god the bible said there's one god
[48:45] not three but that's how
[48:49] that they could you can't get this
[48:50] straightened out and have three gods
[48:53] you'd never sell a jew that i'll tell
[48:55] you that one who knows better
[48:57] he knows there's only one god notice
[49:00] like the sculpture he hides
[49:04] with uh a mast over that's what god's
[49:07] done to this age
[49:09] it's been hit all these things has been
[49:11] hid
[49:12] and supposed to be revealed in this age
[49:15] now the bible says they will be revealed
[49:17] in the latter times
[49:19] it's like a sculpture keeping his his
[49:22] piece of work
[49:23] all covered over until the time
[49:27] he takes the mask off of it and there it
[49:29] is
[49:31] and that's what the bible has been
[49:34] it has been a work of god that's been
[49:37] covered up and it's been hidden
[49:40] since the foundation of the world and
[49:43] it's
[49:44] sevenfold mystery and god promised in
[49:47] this day
[49:48] at the age of this ladies church he
[49:51] would take the mask
[49:52] off the whole thing and we could see it
[49:56] what a glorious thing god
[50:00] in marfan masked in a pillar of fire
[50:04] god in marfa in a man called jesus
[50:09] god in marfa in his church
[50:13] amen god above us god
[50:17] with us god in us the constant seeing of
[50:21] god
[50:22] up there holy no one could touch him he
[50:24] settled up on the mountain
[50:26] and even if an animal touched the
[50:27] mountain had to die
[50:29] and then god come down and change his
[50:32] tent
[50:32] and come down and live with us become
[50:35] one of us
[50:37] and we held him the bible said first
[50:39] timothy 3 16 without controversy
[50:41] great is the mystery of god it's for god
[50:45] was manifested in the flesh
[50:48] handled by hands god eat meat
[50:52] god drank water god slept god
[50:55] cried he was one of us
[50:59] beautiful types in the bible that was
[51:01] god
[51:03] above us god with us now it's
[51:06] god in us the holy spirit
[51:10] not the third person the same person
[51:14] god came down and become flesh and died
[51:17] to death
[51:18] in christ so that he could clean the
[51:20] church in order to get into it for
[51:22] fellowship
[51:24] god loves fellowship that's what he made
[51:26] the man at the first time far was for
[51:28] fellowship
[51:30] god dwelt alone a chairman
[51:33] and notice now he made man and man
[51:37] fell so he came down and redeemed man
[51:39] because god
[51:41] loves to be worshipped the word word god
[51:43] means object of worship
[51:46] and this that comes among us as a pillar
[51:49] of fire
[51:50] as something that changes our hearts
[51:52] that is the same
[51:54] god that said let there be light and
[51:56] there was light
[51:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[52:00] forever
[52:02] now in the beginning god dwelled along
[52:05] with his
[52:06] attributes as i spoke of this morning
[52:08] that's his thoughts
[52:09] there was nothing just god
[52:13] alone but he had thoughts just like a
[52:16] great architect
[52:17] can sit down in his mind and draw out
[52:19] what he thinks is
[52:20] he's going to to build create
[52:24] now he cannot create he could take
[52:26] something that's been created
[52:27] and make it in a different form because
[52:29] god's the only way only one can create
[52:32] but he gets in his mind what he's going
[52:34] to do
[52:35] and that's his thoughts that's his
[52:37] desires
[52:39] now it's a thought and then he speaks it
[52:42] and it's a word then and uh
[52:46] a word is a thought when it's expressed
[52:50] it's a word a thought expressed is a
[52:53] word
[52:54] but it has to be a thought first so it's
[52:57] god's
[52:58] attributes then it becomes
[53:01] a thought then a word notice
[53:05] those who have tonight
[53:09] eternal life was with him
[53:14] and in him and his thinking
[53:17] before there ever was an angel
[53:20] star cherubim or anything else
[53:23] [Music]
[53:24] that's eternal and if you have eternal
[53:28] life
[53:29] you always was
[53:33] not your being here but the shape
[53:36] and form that the infinite god
[53:40] and if he isn't infinite he isn't god
[53:44] god has to be infinite we're finite he's
[53:47] infinite
[53:49] and he was on the present omni mission
[53:51] and omnipotent
[53:53] if he isn't then he can't be god knows
[53:56] all things
[53:57] all places because of his omnipresent
[54:00] omni mission makes him
[54:02] omnipresent he is a being he's not like
[54:04] the wind
[54:06] he is a being he dwells in a house
[54:09] but being on the mission knowing all
[54:11] things makes him omnipresent
[54:14] because he knows everything is going on
[54:16] there can't be a
[54:17] flea bat its eyes but what he noted
[54:21] and he noted before there was the world
[54:22] how many times had bad its eyes and how
[54:24] much talent had in it
[54:26] before there ever was a world that is
[54:29] infinite if we can't
[54:30] comprehend it in our minds but that's
[54:32] god
[54:34] god infinite and remember you
[54:39] your eyes your statue whatever you was
[54:43] you were in his thinking at the
[54:46] beginning
[54:47] and the only thing that you are is
[54:49] expression
[54:50] word actually thought it he spoke it and
[54:53] here you are
[54:54] amen if it isn't if he wasn't in his
[54:58] thinking
[54:59] there's no way at all for you ever be
[55:02] there
[55:04] or he's the one who gives eternal life
[55:07] do you remember how he read the
[55:08] scriptures
[55:09] not him that willeth or him it runs but
[55:11] god
[55:13] and that is predestination might stand
[55:15] true
[55:16] he could choose before any time who
[55:19] god's
[55:19] sovereign in his choosing did you know
[55:22] that
[55:23] god's sovereign who was backed here to
[55:27] tell him a better way to make the world
[55:29] who would dare to tell him he's running
[55:31] his business wrong
[55:33] even the very the very word itself
[55:37] very sovereign even the revelation is
[55:39] sovereign
[55:40] he reveals to whom he will reveal the
[55:43] very revelation itself is sovereign and
[55:46] god
[55:47] that's how people pound the things and
[55:49] jump at things and hitting things
[55:51] not knowing what they're doing
[55:55] god is sovereign in his works now
[55:59] we find him at the beginning is
[56:01] attributes and now you were with him
[56:03] then
[56:05] then is when the book of life
[56:08] comes into view now we read over here
[56:12] in revelations the 13th chapter the
[56:14] eighth verse
[56:15] that the beast that comes upon the earth
[56:17] in these last days
[56:19] will receive all those people
[56:22] on the earth whose names were not
[56:25] written in the lamb's book of life
[56:27] before the foundation of the world
[56:31] think of it before jesus was
[56:34] ever born 4 000 years before he came on
[56:38] earth
[56:39] and several thousand years before you
[56:42] come on earth
[56:44] jesus in god's mind died for the sins of
[56:47] the world
[56:48] and the book of life was made and your
[56:51] name was put on that book of life
[56:54] before the foundation of the world
[56:57] that's the bible truth
[56:59] see your name was ordained of god
[57:03] and placed on the book of life before
[57:05] the foundation of the world
[57:07] you were there in his attributes you
[57:09] don't remember it no
[57:11] because you're just a part of his life
[57:13] you are a part of god
[57:15] when you become a son or a daughter of
[57:17] god
[57:19] just as you are a part of your earthly
[57:21] father
[57:23] that's right
[57:27] you are the male carries the hemoglobin
[57:30] the blood
[57:32] i am on that estonian and the egg
[57:36] then you become a part of your father
[57:39] and your mother is a part of your father
[57:41] also so you're all a part
[57:45] of your father glory
[57:49] that lets the denomination out all
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:52] together
[57:54] does god and all the only place
[57:57] notice now his attribute
[58:01] then the attribute was
[58:04] first god the thought the
[58:08] attribute itself all in one
[58:11] without being expressed then when he
[58:14] expressed
[58:15] secondarily he became then the word
[58:20] and then the word was made flesh and
[58:22] dwelt among us
[58:24] saint john the first chapter and the
[58:27] first verse
[58:28] notice this is in the beginning
[58:33] but before the eternal notice
[58:36] in the beginning was the word
[58:40] when the time began it was word
[58:43] but before it was word it was attribute
[58:46] a thought
[58:47] then it was expressed in the beginning
[58:48] was the expression
[58:50] the word now we're getting where
[58:52] melchizedek is
[58:54] that's this mysterious person in the
[58:57] beginning was the word
[58:59] and the word was with god and the word
[59:01] was god
[59:04] and then the word became flesh and dwelt
[59:07] among us
[59:08] hold that there now notice
[59:11] his his first being
[59:14] was spirit god supernatural
[59:19] all right the great eternal second
[59:23] he begin to form himself towards flesh
[59:27] in a theophany it's called the word
[59:31] a body this then
[59:35] is the state he was in when he met
[59:37] abraham
[59:39] was called melchizedek he was in the
[59:42] form
[59:43] of theophany i will get to that and
[59:46] prove it in a few minutes the lord
[59:47] willing
[59:48] he was the word a theophany
[59:52] is something that you could not see it
[59:54] could be right here now
[59:56] yet you cannot see it it's just like
[1:00:00] well like television that's in another
[1:00:03] dimension
[1:00:04] television people are moving right
[1:00:06] through this room now
[1:00:07] singing there's colors also
[1:00:11] but the eye is only subject to the five
[1:00:14] senses
[1:00:15] your whole being is only subject to five
[1:00:17] senses rather
[1:00:18] and you are only subject to what the
[1:00:21] sight
[1:00:21] has been limited to see but there is
[1:00:24] another dimension
[1:00:26] that can be seen by a transformation
[1:00:31] by television now television
[1:00:34] does not manufacture a picture
[1:00:38] a television only channels it in to a
[1:00:41] circuit
[1:00:43] and then the television screen picks it
[1:00:45] up
[1:00:46] but the pictures there to begin with
[1:00:50] television was here when adam was
[1:00:52] sharing
[1:00:54] television was shared when elijah said
[1:00:56] on mount carmel
[1:00:58] television was shared with jesus of
[1:01:00] nazareth walk the shores of galilee
[1:01:03] but you're just now discovering it
[1:01:07] they wouldn't have believed it back
[1:01:08] there you'd be crazy to have said
[1:01:11] something like it
[1:01:12] but now it's become a reality amen
[1:01:16] and so is it that christ is here
[1:01:21] the angels of god are here amen amen
[1:01:25] and someday in the great millennium to
[1:01:27] come
[1:01:28] it'll be just for real and television or
[1:01:30] anything else because
[1:01:31] they are here amen amen
[1:01:35] he reveals himself in his great
[1:01:38] form of what he claimed as he amorphous
[1:01:41] himself
[1:01:42] into his servants and it proves himself
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:53] hey man i always feel terrible to stop
[1:02:04] now we're just gonna go back over it uh
[1:02:07] slowly and and just fellowship
[1:02:11] and work uh towards uh
[1:02:14] a few things to uh really
[1:02:18] understand but this explains
[1:02:21] the beginning of our existence
[1:02:25] and if i would call this i would call it
[1:02:28] the beginning
[1:02:30] of our existence so we can understand
[1:02:33] how that we're here and why that we're
[1:02:37] here
[1:02:38] and i i just thought that was beautiful
[1:02:41] what we just listened to
[1:02:43] and and and so as we
[1:02:46] we start out we notice that that
[1:02:50] brother branham is trying to point out
[1:02:53] something to us
[1:02:54] and you can follow these along on the
[1:02:57] screen up there and we'll start with
[1:03:00] paragraph
[1:03:01] 29 and i want to uh
[1:03:04] uh catch this little is there anybody in
[1:03:07] the booth
[1:03:09] uh paragraph 29 of where we just read
[1:03:12] who is this melchizedek it says
[1:03:17] now let's get right into the service now
[1:03:20] quickly
[1:03:21] turning with me if you will
[1:03:24] to the book of hebrews now they have a
[1:03:27] period there
[1:03:28] but let me read it this way
[1:03:34] turn quickly with me if you will to the
[1:03:37] book of hebrews
[1:03:38] and another revelation on the message
[1:03:43] okay so we see that what he's going to
[1:03:46] point out
[1:03:47] to us here is another revelation
[1:03:51] that the message was to bring us
[1:03:54] so part of the message that he was sent
[1:03:58] to reveal he's now going to reveal this
[1:04:01] to us
[1:04:02] so as you're sitting here this is
[1:04:04] something that he said
[1:04:06] is to you this is to you
[1:04:10] i mean it's not about somebody else it's
[1:04:12] not
[1:04:13] for anybody else it's for you so there's
[1:04:16] a revelation
[1:04:18] that was hit that
[1:04:21] was hid in this melchizedek
[1:04:25] so when we talk about who is this
[1:04:28] malkesada
[1:04:29] there's a revelation hid in
[1:04:32] malchezada so that's why we have to know
[1:04:36] who is this man because if we can
[1:04:40] understand who this man is then we can
[1:04:43] get the revelation
[1:04:44] that's hid in him
[1:04:49] okay so that that's what he's trying to
[1:04:51] express
[1:04:52] to us here is it's not he's just not
[1:04:55] going to tell us
[1:04:56] that oh this is who mal kizek it is
[1:04:59] you've got something
[1:05:00] no if you follow down as he goes through
[1:05:03] this message
[1:05:04] he begins to unfold it and the kind of
[1:05:08] lay it out there he says so who is this
[1:05:10] great person
[1:05:12] he says now that's a question who is
[1:05:14] this man
[1:05:15] paragraph a 30. he says
[1:05:19] who is this man theologians have
[1:05:21] different ideas
[1:05:23] but since the opening of the seven seals
[1:05:27] the mysterious book that's
[1:05:30] been mysterious to us according to
[1:05:33] revelations 1-7
[1:05:35] all the mysteries that's wrote in this
[1:05:37] book that's been hid down through the
[1:05:39] ages
[1:05:40] reformers to brought out into view
[1:05:44] by the angel of the last church aid
[1:05:48] so he's saying here now there's
[1:05:50] something that this
[1:05:51] messenger angel is going to reveal to
[1:05:55] you
[1:05:58] it's not a theology it's not it's not a
[1:06:02] matter of putting historical facts
[1:06:04] together
[1:06:05] there's a revelation hid in
[1:06:09] this word for you
[1:06:13] and it was hid until
[1:06:16] the seven seals were to open it up
[1:06:20] and so he he says now he goes on
[1:06:24] he says so if this person whoever this
[1:06:28] person is
[1:06:28] is he still alive
[1:06:32] hallelujah so he's still alive and he's
[1:06:37] alive tonight
[1:06:38] so this if this revelation
[1:06:42] will if he's still alive tonight
[1:06:46] because then if he reveals himself
[1:06:50] then you begin to understand why that
[1:06:53] god
[1:06:54] revealed himself and
[1:06:57] and and and where why where he stood
[1:07:02] about this great eternal person so he's
[1:07:05] still alive tonight
[1:07:08] because the bible said that he had
[1:07:10] neither father mother
[1:07:12] and um and and he
[1:07:16] would have to be an eternal person is
[1:07:18] that right
[1:07:19] an eternal person so he could only
[1:07:22] person that's god because he's the only
[1:07:26] one
[1:07:26] that has eternal life so
[1:07:30] so we know that this person is god
[1:07:34] and this god is going to be
[1:07:37] emorphae in other words so we understand
[1:07:41] that this
[1:07:42] is a changing god that's
[1:07:45] going to to change himself so he's going
[1:07:48] to take off his mask
[1:07:50] he's what's been hidden he's going to
[1:07:53] reveal
[1:07:54] so we understand that in the by by this
[1:07:57] seventh church age messenger the things
[1:08:01] about god that were hid
[1:08:04] are now going to be revealed so he's
[1:08:07] going to reveal
[1:08:08] how that we came into existence
[1:08:12] so if we know how we can came into
[1:08:14] existence
[1:08:16] then we will also know how that we're
[1:08:18] going to end up
[1:08:21] because he's alpha and omega he's the
[1:08:25] beginning
[1:08:26] and the end so if he was word in the
[1:08:29] beginning then he's word
[1:08:31] in the end and we're going to start
[1:08:34] seeing the revelation
[1:08:36] that's hid in this great person
[1:08:40] uh malchezadec and
[1:08:43] and so we we we'll just kind of go
[1:08:46] through it quickly
[1:08:47] so he wants to show us that he's a
[1:08:50] changing god
[1:08:52] now that's important to us because once
[1:08:55] we understand that he takes off his mask
[1:08:58] by the seven seals by the opening of the
[1:09:01] seven seals
[1:09:02] he's like the great sculpture he's going
[1:09:05] to pull
[1:09:06] the covering off of what that he had in
[1:09:09] his mind
[1:09:10] from the beginning what it was that he
[1:09:14] was
[1:09:14] creating hold that there
[1:09:18] what it was what he was creating because
[1:09:22] that when you see melchizedek you see
[1:09:25] what it was that he was creating
[1:09:29] oh that's good to me
[1:09:33] so he's an unchanging god and so when
[1:09:36] you know that he's unchanging god
[1:09:39] then you can understand justification
[1:09:43] how he changed from justification
[1:09:46] to sanctification and how he changed
[1:09:49] from
[1:09:50] sanctification to the restoration of
[1:09:53] gifts
[1:09:54] and then how he changed to the unmasking
[1:09:58] or uncovering of the mysteries
[1:10:01] so people they they would come along as
[1:10:04] we talked before
[1:10:05] in previous messages that they got to
[1:10:08] justification
[1:10:09] and they stop
[1:10:13] and when he changed they didn't change
[1:10:16] with them
[1:10:19] and so that that's where they died they
[1:10:22] didn't make the
[1:10:23] change with them now this is part of the
[1:10:26] revelation
[1:10:28] that's hidden in melchizedek is making
[1:10:31] the change
[1:10:32] with him god's moving
[1:10:37] he's changing he's changing us
[1:10:41] right now god's changing us
[1:10:49] we can't wait for the change
[1:10:53] we got to be part of the chance
[1:10:59] and he's moving he's changing
[1:11:02] he's changing his form so he
[1:11:05] he's he he's unmasking himself
[1:11:09] so we understand he's we in one way
[1:11:12] he's an unchanging god
[1:11:15] but the change is not in him
[1:11:18] it's in the portion that he's revealing
[1:11:22] or the change is in us
[1:11:27] god is changing us amen he's not going
[1:11:31] to leave one of us
[1:11:32] out
[1:11:35] and so we saw that this change
[1:11:39] can only to be revealed
[1:11:45] right and so that's what we preached
[1:11:48] last wednesday when we began to open the
[1:11:51] book
[1:11:52] is that worship comes from
[1:11:56] revelation and remember if we go back
[1:12:00] just a page over to page
[1:12:02] paragraph 45 if you guys wouldn't mind
[1:12:05] jumping around with me
[1:12:06] he said notice now he made man and man
[1:12:09] fail
[1:12:10] he came down to redeem man because
[1:12:13] god loves to be worshipped
[1:12:17] the very word god means object of
[1:12:20] worship
[1:12:21] and this is that come amongst us the
[1:12:25] pillar of fire
[1:12:26] as something that changes
[1:12:30] our hearts this come amongst us
[1:12:34] as the pillar of fire something that
[1:12:37] changes our hearts
[1:12:40] so you understand emorphae is going on
[1:12:44] right now
[1:12:51] now this revelation is hidden
[1:12:55] in melchizedek
[1:13:02] okay so we understand that so
[1:13:05] god is changing himself and so we
[1:13:08] understand
[1:13:09] that he said i can't accept revelation
[1:13:12] he said
[1:13:12] then there's no way for god ever to get
[1:13:15] to you
[1:13:16] paragraph 37 because it's hid from the
[1:13:19] eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:13:21] and revealed and debates such as
[1:13:24] will acceptance
[1:13:29] this change oh
[1:13:33] hallelujah the rapture is a revelation
[1:13:37] this change
[1:13:42] it's to them that will accept it or
[1:13:45] learn
[1:13:50] there be no way for god ever to get to
[1:13:52] you
[1:13:53] so you can't worship god unless he
[1:13:56] reveals himself to you
[1:13:58] right so you can't really worship god
[1:14:02] until you know
[1:14:05] him you're just
[1:14:08] you're just worshiping an idea you're
[1:14:11] just worshiping some
[1:14:13] image that somebody drew up
[1:14:16] praise god i come out of that
[1:14:20] about your statues and lighting candles
[1:14:23] and worship be something you don't know
[1:14:28] that's the devil
[1:14:32] but god reveals himself
[1:14:35] so he can be worshipped and without
[1:14:38] revelation you can't
[1:14:40] worship god so you can't worship
[1:14:42] something
[1:14:43] that he's not
[1:14:48] so if you're worshiping three persons or
[1:14:50] three gods or a trinity
[1:14:52] you're not worshiping god because that's
[1:14:55] not what he
[1:14:56] is so the only way you can truly worship
[1:14:59] him
[1:15:00] is to know who he is and he wants to
[1:15:02] reveal that to you
[1:15:06] that's what he wants to do i don't care
[1:15:08] if you're a sinner i don't care if
[1:15:10] you're a smoker
[1:15:11] i don't care if you're a drinker i don't
[1:15:13] care what your past is
[1:15:15] god this morning wants to reveal himself
[1:15:18] to you so you too
[1:15:26] can join in with all those he's revealed
[1:15:28] himself to
[1:15:29] and worship him hallelujah
[1:15:36] now he he does this through this book
[1:15:40] just saying something and then going
[1:15:44] back to it
[1:15:44] saying something and going back to it so
[1:15:47] you've got to
[1:15:49] understand here that that
[1:15:52] his and he goes down and he talks about
[1:15:56] you have to have revelation then he
[1:15:58] talks about this person
[1:16:00] being changing so any morphe
[1:16:03] if he comes down he says now notice like
[1:16:05] the sculpture
[1:16:07] he hides his mask or in other words when
[1:16:10] you have a statue or something
[1:16:12] you put a covering over it
[1:16:16] excuse me until the time of its
[1:16:20] unveiling
[1:16:24] okay so we know that
[1:16:27] he's now going to unveil
[1:16:30] so what he's going to unveil
[1:16:34] was what was hid in melkiside
[1:16:40] so there's a mystery in melchizedek
[1:16:44] that's been covered up that it wasn't
[1:16:48] until
[1:16:48] this time that the revelation of the
[1:16:51] message
[1:16:52] would be open and he's going to pull
[1:16:56] that cover off
[1:16:58] but here's the key
[1:17:04] he says paragraph 42
[1:17:07] that's what god has done
[1:17:10] to this age it's been hid
[1:17:14] and all these things that's been hid are
[1:17:17] supposed to be revealed
[1:17:19] in this age now the bible said they
[1:17:23] would be
[1:17:24] revealed in the latter time
[1:17:27] it's like the sculpture keeping his
[1:17:30] piece of work
[1:17:31] all covered up until the time
[1:17:35] and he takes his mask off of it
[1:17:39] and there it is
[1:17:46] hallelujah and there it is
[1:17:51] that got the work
[1:17:54] that's been covered up
[1:17:58] and hid since the foundation of the
[1:18:01] world
[1:18:03] and its seven mysteries and god's
[1:18:06] promise in this
[1:18:07] age of ladies say church age
[1:18:10] he would take the mask off the whole
[1:18:13] thing
[1:18:14] and we could see it
[1:18:18] right now again just that
[1:18:22] jump around a little bit to tie the
[1:18:24] pieces of the puzzle together
[1:18:27] let's go back over and so
[1:18:31] he says this now and he talks about the
[1:18:34] changing god
[1:18:36] gaudi morphic and how he wanted to be
[1:18:39] worshiped paragraph 46 and in the
[1:18:42] beginning
[1:18:43] god dwelt alone with his attributes i
[1:18:46] spoke on this
[1:18:48] this morning that's his thoughts
[1:18:52] there's there is was nothing
[1:18:55] just god alone so he's go
[1:18:59] we're just going through it slow this
[1:19:00] morning so in the beginning was
[1:19:04] god amen
[1:19:07] god just dwelt alone nobody knew him
[1:19:11] nobody even knew to think
[1:19:16] about him in fact there was nobody there
[1:19:18] to think
[1:19:22] so something had to come into existence
[1:19:29] so so he because he loved to work
[1:19:33] worship
[1:19:34] he began to come into existence he said
[1:19:37] and it's just god dwelt alone but he had
[1:19:40] thoughts it's just like the great
[1:19:43] architect
[1:19:46] he sits down he has a thought he can't
[1:19:48] create
[1:19:50] but he can take stuff and put it
[1:19:53] together
[1:19:56] but god can create
[1:20:02] that's the difference so this architect
[1:20:05] god is going to create
[1:20:10] now the mystery of his creation
[1:20:14] lies in this melchizedek
[1:20:18] so let's jump up we're talking about
[1:20:21] about revelation so let's jump over to
[1:20:24] the 51st verse so god and morphe
[1:20:28] god's changing and the only way you can
[1:20:31] worship him
[1:20:33] correctly is if he reveals himself to
[1:20:36] you
[1:20:37] and he promised to reveal himself
[1:20:41] all what was covered up from the
[1:20:44] beginning of the book
[1:20:48] he's going to pull the covering off but
[1:20:51] this is the key here he says remember
[1:20:54] now
[1:20:56] verse 51 well he talks here let's go to
[1:20:59] 50 because we all love this verse
[1:21:02] now remember your eyes your statute
[1:21:05] whatever you were in his
[1:21:08] thinking at the beginning
[1:21:11] and the only thing that you are
[1:21:15] is an expression word
[1:21:19] he thought it he spoke it
[1:21:23] and here you are if it isn't
[1:21:27] if you wasn't in his thinking there's no
[1:21:30] way
[1:21:31] at all for you ever to be there
[1:21:35] he's the one that gives eternal life
[1:21:38] now how am i ever going to know that
[1:21:46] by what revelation
[1:21:49] so i don't care if you're
[1:21:53] like the woman at the well she was
[1:21:55] married five
[1:21:56] times and when living with a guy like
[1:21:59] the man that was demon possessed
[1:22:01] all those people in the bible the great
[1:22:04] harlot the one that was going to be
[1:22:05] stoned
[1:22:06] the condition didn't matter if they got
[1:22:09] the revelation
[1:22:11] they were redeemed
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:21] how do you get it
[1:22:24] he said now remember the scripture read
[1:22:29] not him that willeth
[1:22:32] or that him that runeth but
[1:22:35] god and that his
[1:22:40] predestination might stand true
[1:22:44] he could choose before any time
[1:22:49] god sovereign in his
[1:22:52] choosing did you know that
[1:22:59] oh church has got
[1:23:02] all kinds of rules for the choosing
[1:23:05] they've got all things
[1:23:06] you've got to mask up to be chosen
[1:23:09] they don't understand look at his
[1:23:11] election is sovereign
[1:23:13] he's the potter how can the clay say
[1:23:17] to the potter why how that made me thus
[1:23:21] [Applause]
[1:23:23] it's not the church's job to lay the
[1:23:25] standard
[1:23:26] it's the church's job to preach the word
[1:23:28] of god
[1:23:29] god is a forgiver and when he forgives
[1:23:33] it's
[1:23:33] thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:23:36] to be remembered no more
[1:23:42] so you don't look to the past you look
[1:23:46] to the revelation
[1:23:48] is god trying to reveal to me
[1:23:52] that i am one of his god is trying to
[1:23:56] reveal
[1:23:57] to you that you are one of his
[1:24:02] thus saith the lord
[1:24:16] and he predestined might stand true he
[1:24:18] could choose
[1:24:19] before any time
[1:24:23] he chose before there was any time
[1:24:28] the choice was already made
[1:24:33] god sovereign in his choosing
[1:24:36] did you know that god sovereign
[1:24:40] who was back yonder to tell him a better
[1:24:43] way to make
[1:24:44] the world
[1:24:49] who would dare to tell him he was
[1:24:52] running his
[1:24:52] business wrong
[1:24:57] we do it all the time
[1:25:00] you shouldn't have picked that one that
[1:25:02] one's not in he's a believer
[1:25:04] he's not a believer it's my way or the
[1:25:10] highway
[1:25:17] even even the very
[1:25:21] the very word itself
[1:25:24] very sovereign even the revelation
[1:25:28] is sovereign he reveals to
[1:25:31] whom he will reveal
[1:25:35] the very revelation itself
[1:25:38] is sovereign in god god chooses
[1:25:42] whom he's going to reveal it to and
[1:25:45] that's what we
[1:25:46] call the elect the elected
[1:25:50] are those who receive the revelation
[1:25:53] the election is not what you're going to
[1:25:57] be
[1:25:58] it's the revelation election
[1:26:01] is in revelation
[1:26:07] oh i hope i made that clear
[1:26:12] we say i'm elect i'm chosen no
[1:26:15] you're elected to receive the revelation
[1:26:19] if you receive refuse the revelation
[1:26:23] your name is taken out of the lamb's
[1:26:26] book of life
[1:26:32] now nobody likes to hear that part of it
[1:26:38] but he said when he comes and does these
[1:26:41] things
[1:26:42] and you call it beelzebub there's no
[1:26:46] forgiveness for you in this life
[1:26:47] or the life to come but remember
[1:26:53] you can't worship him without revelation
[1:26:57] you can't be a part of him without
[1:27:00] revelation
[1:27:03] so god's sovereign elected god
[1:27:06] reveals the change
[1:27:11] to the elect
[1:27:14] the emorphy the change
[1:27:19] god changing from justification to
[1:27:21] sanctification
[1:27:23] god changing god changing from the great
[1:27:26] eternal being
[1:27:28] working towards fast so the the
[1:27:31] revelation
[1:27:33] is the revelation of the emorphy
[1:27:39] or it's the revelation of the changing
[1:27:42] god
[1:27:43] so there's a change going on now
[1:27:46] and we have to have the revelation of
[1:27:49] the change
[1:27:51] else we're worshiping for something that
[1:27:53] he was
[1:27:54] instead of something that he is
[1:28:01] and that's what we talked about
[1:28:04] wednesday night so we find out
[1:28:08] that he does this and and uh
[1:28:13] and so we begin to see this these three
[1:28:16] great
[1:28:17] states of god these three great
[1:28:22] emorphas of god
[1:28:26] we can watch the change now
[1:28:29] comes down and when we can see this
[1:28:31] change
[1:28:32] then we can understand this malkeside
[1:28:38] so we know that first of all
[1:28:42] god change changes
[1:28:45] he doesn't change his person he changes
[1:28:50] his mask or his covering
[1:28:54] he had this all in his mind from the
[1:28:56] beginning
[1:28:58] so we're going to find our place
[1:29:03] in this great
[1:29:07] plan of god so where we come into
[1:29:10] existence
[1:29:13] so first of all
[1:29:17] we know that he was
[1:29:20] god eternal
[1:29:25] and and we're again we're going to
[1:29:29] read here and then jump back and read
[1:29:31] back so we can put it together
[1:29:33] so let's turn go to paragraph 55.
[1:29:42] he says notice now his attributes
[1:29:47] then the attributes was first
[1:29:51] god the thought
[1:29:55] the attributes itself all in one
[1:29:59] without being expressed
[1:30:05] then when he expressed it secondarily
[1:30:09] he became then the word
[1:30:12] and then the word was made flesh and
[1:30:15] dwelt among us
[1:30:17] saint john first chapter and first verse
[1:30:21] in the beginning was god so
[1:30:24] first of all god dwelt alone with his
[1:30:27] attributes
[1:30:30] and so what is an attribute an attribute
[1:30:33] is what
[1:30:34] makes you what you are
[1:30:37] it's the identifying characteristics
[1:30:41] i have certain attributes certain
[1:30:44] idiosyncrasies certain things that
[1:30:46] identifies me as who that i am
[1:30:50] so you recognize me by the attributes
[1:30:55] you might say that's the grumpiest
[1:30:57] meanest
[1:30:58] sharpest preacher i've ever met
[1:31:04] [Laughter]
[1:31:12] his fuse is about this short
[1:31:16] he can't stand lazy people that don't
[1:31:19] work hard
[1:31:23] so that was god he was just all by
[1:31:28] himself
[1:31:30] the self-existing one and in him are
[1:31:33] attributes
[1:31:34] is that right and so he says
[1:31:37] now notice verse 56
[1:31:41] in the beginning but before
[1:31:45] the eternal notice
[1:31:48] in the beginning was the word when
[1:31:51] the time began it
[1:31:55] was word so time
[1:31:58] began at the expression
[1:32:02] of god's thoughts the beginning
[1:32:06] of god's thoughts is when time began
[1:32:10] so when is time no more
[1:32:14] at the completion of god's thoughts
[1:32:18] [Applause]
[1:32:21] so when he took the covering by the
[1:32:24] seven
[1:32:25] seal off what he had in his mind
[1:32:28] and he was going to reveal it he said
[1:32:31] time
[1:32:32] shall be no more
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:39] why because now
[1:32:42] he's revealing and he's
[1:32:45] finishing up his plan and he's showing
[1:32:49] what it was
[1:32:54] he's revealing the beginning
[1:32:59] and we've got that part
[1:33:02] now it's got to emorphy
[1:33:06] it's got to change from the beginning
[1:33:10] to the end
[1:33:13] okay oh
[1:33:18] i wish i had a vocabulary
[1:33:21] i probably should have finished school
[1:33:26] but i'm going to preach this with the 10
[1:33:28] words that i have
[1:33:30] the best i can
[1:33:33] so he was just alone but he enemy had
[1:33:37] thoughts
[1:33:39] right so the second thing that god
[1:33:42] decided to do
[1:33:44] was express those thoughts
[1:33:48] and when the thoughts were expressed it
[1:33:50] becomes a what
[1:33:51] a word the word is a thought expressed
[1:33:55] so when he began to express his thoughts
[1:33:59] that's when time began
[1:34:02] what he said right here when the time
[1:34:05] began
[1:34:06] it was word
[1:34:10] before it was word paragraph
[1:34:13] 56 again before it was word
[1:34:16] it was attributes a thought
[1:34:20] then it was expressed
[1:34:24] the thoughts were expressed
[1:34:28] in the beginning was the expression
[1:34:32] the word now we're getting
[1:34:36] where melchizedek is
[1:34:40] melchizedek is the revelation
[1:34:44] of the expression
[1:34:51] he is the word that's right
[1:34:54] he wasn't jesus
[1:34:59] jesus was another expression
[1:35:04] of god in flesh this was the secondary
[1:35:08] expression
[1:35:11] the thought of god how he appeared to
[1:35:16] abraham the secondary the expressed word
[1:35:22] that's why abraham worshiped him
[1:35:28] he was this theophany
[1:35:34] he says
[1:35:39] now working himself
[1:35:42] towards flesh in a theophany
[1:35:47] it's called the word a body
[1:35:51] this then is the state
[1:35:55] he was in when he met abraham
[1:35:58] called melchizedek
[1:36:01] he was the original expression
[1:36:06] of the thought of god amen
[1:36:13] okay
[1:36:17] oh i just can't make it
[1:36:20] any better
[1:36:26] so in this expression thought
[1:36:30] in whatever what melchizedek was
[1:36:34] that thought became word in other words
[1:36:37] when he
[1:36:38] thought his word he didn't think part of
[1:36:41] the plan
[1:36:44] he thought the whole plan
[1:36:47] that's why the color of your hair the
[1:36:49] color of your eyes the statue were in
[1:36:52] you were all in that original thought
[1:36:56] of god so when god
[1:37:00] when god appeared
[1:37:04] to abraham in
[1:37:07] that body that theophany
[1:37:11] body not the flesh body
[1:37:14] it was a spirit that couldn't be seen
[1:37:18] like television he said it's here
[1:37:22] we can't see that body but it always
[1:37:25] existed so when he appeared to
[1:37:28] abraham in that great form
[1:37:33] were in him then
[1:37:38] [Music]
[1:37:40] this is where you come into existence
[1:37:43] that's what he said you were a thought
[1:37:46] expressed
[1:37:48] but you only know that from the
[1:37:51] viewpoint
[1:37:52] of your flesh
[1:38:00] right
[1:38:02] oh i know i can't express this
[1:38:07] so he meets abraham right
[1:38:10] and now brother brahm goes through this
[1:38:12] little dissertation here
[1:38:14] about television so
[1:38:17] abraham's sitting there
[1:38:21] here comes a man
[1:38:25] now this is important because if we can
[1:38:29] follow this man this person
[1:38:33] who is this man if we can follow this
[1:38:36] man's
[1:38:37] journey right
[1:38:40] how that he created
[1:38:44] nothing was made everything that was
[1:38:46] made was made by him
[1:38:47] that how he appeared to abraham
[1:38:51] and then how he came in the flesh if we
[1:38:54] can
[1:38:55] follow this person all the way down to
[1:38:58] this
[1:38:58] age then we know whom we're worshiping
[1:39:01] [Applause]
[1:39:06] so he comes before abraham
[1:39:09] and he said god let's go to the 60th
[1:39:11] verse where we stop
[1:39:14] god reveals himself
[1:39:18] in his great form
[1:39:22] of what he claimed
[1:39:25] as he emorphy himself
[1:39:30] into his servant and proves
[1:39:34] himself
[1:39:37] so this great amorpha this great
[1:39:40] change that god made so
[1:39:44] when he had his thoughts
[1:39:47] in the beginning that thought he
[1:39:50] expressed
[1:39:52] and you were in that thought
[1:39:55] your eyes your color of your skin the
[1:39:59] color of your hair
[1:40:00] uh the statue that he gave us you were
[1:40:03] in him then that's when time began
[1:40:06] that's when you
[1:40:07] came into existence
[1:40:13] so now when he appears to abraham we
[1:40:16] stop the tape but we're going to close
[1:40:18] now and we go over to verse
[1:40:22] verse a paragraph uh
[1:40:26] let's start in 64.
[1:40:33] so he's talk he's talking about this
[1:40:34] some morphe
[1:40:36] and and so uh we'll pick this
[1:40:40] up tonight come back through this but
[1:40:42] just to lay this down for this morning
[1:40:45] he says now 64. now god
[1:40:48] in this great stage
[1:40:51] this stage of his creation
[1:40:55] later formed into flesh jesus
[1:41:00] so in that state that he was that person
[1:41:04] that he was those attribute expressed
[1:41:07] he later formed himself into
[1:41:16] jesus
[1:41:19] from what from the great beginning
[1:41:22] spirit then come down
[1:41:26] to be word bringing itself
[1:41:29] out the word doesn't yet make
[1:41:32] itself it's just spoke out emorphate
[1:41:37] later he becomes flesh jesus
[1:41:40] mortal to taste death for all of us
[1:41:44] sinners
[1:41:46] now this next
[1:41:49] verse is the revelation
[1:41:53] that was hid in melchizedek
[1:41:58] when abraham meant him he was
[1:42:02] melchizedek
[1:42:05] you understand he was not
[1:42:08] human flesh yet but he was
[1:42:11] theophany flesh
[1:42:15] right spirit flesh
[1:42:19] he could walk through walls he could
[1:42:22] walk on water
[1:42:23] who wasn't that walk on water it was
[1:42:26] melchizedek who walked on water
[1:42:30] who wasn't that walk to the wall it was
[1:42:33] melchizedek that walked through the wall
[1:42:38] why the revelation lies in
[1:42:41] melchizedek he says
[1:42:45] he unfolds here
[1:42:48] what all the attributes will do
[1:42:53] in the final end every
[1:42:56] son of abraham hallelujah
[1:42:59] [Applause]
[1:43:02] he's revealing to abraham
[1:43:06] what every son that accepts the promise
[1:43:11] will be
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:17] that's why he had to reveal himself to
[1:43:20] abraham
[1:43:20] in that form so abraham
[1:43:24] could know what this flesh
[1:43:27] was going to be
[1:43:30] [Music]
[1:43:37] how many of you hate your flesh
[1:43:42] oh wretched man that i am
[1:43:45] when i would do good evils with me
[1:43:51] he redeems you by becoming flesh
[1:43:55] but he takes you back to theophany
[1:44:04] that's what abraham saw he saw what he
[1:44:08] was going
[1:44:10] to become what abraham's seed was going
[1:44:14] to become
[1:44:15] what god had in his mind
[1:44:22] [Music]
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:26] the final end of every
[1:44:30] son of abraham every son of the faith
[1:44:34] will absolutely do the same thing
[1:44:38] but i want to watch how we have to come
[1:44:45] so god always had
[1:44:50] this theophany body
[1:44:54] for us this is what he revealed
[1:44:59] in malchezad this is the sinless body
[1:45:04] this is the attributes that i have in my
[1:45:06] mind
[1:45:07] expressed this is what every son
[1:45:11] of abraham will come into
[1:45:14] that's the final thing so now what's he
[1:45:18] going to go into
[1:45:20] he's going to go into why we had to
[1:45:23] bypass
[1:45:24] that theophany
[1:45:31] okay but how when time is no more
[1:45:37] we start to hear back from it because
[1:45:40] it's calling us to that perfection
[1:45:48] first of all god alone
[1:45:51] secondly he thinks his whole plan
[1:45:57] from beginning to end he starts
[1:46:00] expressing it
[1:46:01] that's where you are
[1:46:05] and when god expressed
[1:46:09] the body the being
[1:46:13] of every son of god he expressed it
[1:46:19] to be what melchizedek was
[1:46:24] that's the original expression
[1:46:28] so when abraham meant god he meant
[1:46:31] god in his original expression
[1:46:38] what you really were doing
[1:46:41] in the beginning the real body
[1:46:45] he has for you so when this earthly
[1:46:48] body be dissolved
[1:46:52] we have one waiting for us
[1:46:55] amen may i just throw in a scripture
[1:46:58] here in closing
[1:47:02] go to uh the gospel of saint john
[1:47:07] first chapter
[1:47:12] 12th verse now here he is in flesh right
[1:47:17] jesus he's come down in flesh
[1:47:20] he he's not in the melchizedek form
[1:47:23] he's in the form that we are that's what
[1:47:27] i think about
[1:47:28] hallelujah showing us
[1:47:33] that this is in our body
[1:47:36] this isn't the thought god had of us
[1:47:40] he just gave us this body so he could
[1:47:43] express his
[1:47:44] attributes and we can be tested
[1:47:52] don't give up on your loved ones don't
[1:47:54] give up on your loved ones
[1:47:56] pray for your loved ones that's right
[1:48:00] amen amen
[1:48:03] listen but as many as received him
[1:48:07] to them gave he power
[1:48:11] to become the sons of god
[1:48:14] even to them that believed on his name
[1:48:18] not to become fleshly sons but to become
[1:48:22] theophany son
[1:48:27] remember a theophany is a spirit
[1:48:31] something
[1:48:32] that you can't see
[1:48:36] therefore it has to be what reveal
[1:48:42] let's look at another great scripture
[1:48:46] philippians 3 and 2 21.
[1:49:07] look i just like let's read start from
[1:49:09] the 19th verse
[1:49:11] talking about the devil whose end is
[1:49:12] destruction
[1:49:15] whose god is their belly the whole
[1:49:19] whose glory is in their shame
[1:49:23] who mind earthly things
[1:49:27] for our conversation is in heaven
[1:49:33] from whence also we look for the savior
[1:49:37] the lord jesus christ who shall change
[1:49:41] our vile bodies
[1:49:45] take it our vile body
[1:49:49] that it may be fashioned
[1:49:52] liken unto his glorious body
[1:49:56] according to the working whereby he
[1:49:59] is able even to subdue all things
[1:50:02] unto himself so what is he going to do
[1:50:05] he's going to take
[1:50:06] this vile body and make it like the
[1:50:10] body that abraham saw
[1:50:13] [Applause]
[1:50:15] that that's what he was revealing in
[1:50:17] melchizedek
[1:50:19] this abraham is the body
[1:50:23] that all your seed is going to receive
[1:50:27] this is what i have in my thinking this
[1:50:30] is the real you
[1:50:32] [Applause]
[1:50:36] amen now in the next part of this
[1:50:39] he's going to talk about our journey how
[1:50:42] we bypass
[1:50:43] that right
[1:50:46] but we know at the end time we're
[1:50:49] starting to hear back from it
[1:50:51] why are we starting to hear back from it
[1:50:54] because there's
[1:50:55] immorphy
[1:51:00] you're invited into the change
[1:51:06] praise god he's inviting us
[1:51:10] into his change the invitation is in his
[1:51:13] word
[1:51:14] the invitation is in the revelation
[1:51:17] the invitation is in the eye salve the
[1:51:21] invitation is in the goal
[1:51:25] oh hallelujah
[1:51:28] we see ourselves
[1:51:31] in his created state but because we're
[1:51:35] in this flesh
[1:51:38] we look through a glass darkling
[1:51:44] we can only imagine
[1:51:47] but now he says here's one of the
[1:51:49] revelations
[1:51:50] that comes in the opening of the seven
[1:51:53] seals
[1:51:55] abraham sat there
[1:51:58] and saw what the promise
[1:52:02] of what every one of his children
[1:52:07] would be
[1:52:12] i think there's a change coming
[1:52:16] i think god's immorphy
[1:52:20] i think that's why he's gathering all of
[1:52:23] those and putting him under the word of
[1:52:26] god
[1:52:27] because the word of god causes
[1:52:29] transformation
[1:52:31] amen so we'll stop there
[1:52:35] that's more than i can grasp
[1:52:40] who was this man what was the revelation
[1:52:46] that was hid why is it important to us
[1:52:49] because when we go back through it
[1:52:52] and we see what we bypassed and why we
[1:52:55] bypass it in other words he said the way
[1:52:58] we had to come
[1:53:03] well he shows us what we bypass
[1:53:06] then he's going to show us how we come
[1:53:08] back to it
[1:53:10] and we're right at the door now
[1:53:15] i enjoy the word don't you remember
[1:53:18] it's hid but revealed
[1:53:22] if this earthly body be dissolved
[1:53:26] we already have malkes adapt
[1:53:30] waiting for us
[1:53:36] who is malquesada
[1:53:39] are melchizedek
[1:53:44] amen hallelujah melchizedek was the
[1:53:48] revelation
[1:53:49] of the first true redeemed son of god
[1:53:58] you could almost say adam was
[1:54:03] adam was melchizedek when he was male
[1:54:09] and female together
[1:54:12] and then god made flesh
[1:54:15] took eve out that's all part of the plan
[1:54:19] but it all comes back to what that
[1:54:24] word was in the express
[1:54:28] thought god alone god above us
[1:54:34] right gives great thoughts
[1:54:38] the word and what has he done
[1:54:41] in this age why did god send a prophet
[1:54:44] i know we take a lot of grief for
[1:54:47] believing in a prophet
[1:54:51] you know we take it's easy to
[1:54:55] point to us and and call us a cult
[1:55:00] but i know one thing he didn't come in
[1:55:02] word only
[1:55:04] but he came in power and demonstration
[1:55:06] of the spirit
[1:55:12] and that's why he sent a messenger
[1:55:17] he sent a messenger to reveal
[1:55:22] melchizedek because melchizedek is who
[1:55:26] we really are
[1:55:32] that's what every son of abraham
[1:55:37] don't you love that statement is it up
[1:55:39] there put it up there again if you could
[1:55:44] like
[1:55:59] 65 paragraph 65
[1:56:13] we have that when abraham met him
[1:56:17] he was melchizedek
[1:56:21] he unfolds here what
[1:56:24] all the attributes will do
[1:56:27] in the final end every
[1:56:31] son of abraham amen
[1:56:34] [Music]
