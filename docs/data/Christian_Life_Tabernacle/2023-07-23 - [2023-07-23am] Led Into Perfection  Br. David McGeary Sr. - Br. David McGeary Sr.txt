I got up this morning not really knowing what I was gonna try to prepare to read I've read over a few scriptures and many things you want to bring out in the word of the Lord make beneficial but I got to thinking on Moses and not knowing my Bible titles psalm 90. as a prayer of Moses or a Psalm of Moses that's what we're going to read this morning and I reflected and started reading over in Chronicles realizing that it's not our our righteousness excuse me I said Chronicles I meant Deuteronomy if you'll read Deuteronomy 9 and Moses you know up until the time the coming of the Lord Jesus there was not a prophet like in the Moses face to face with God let me read just a a short portion to remind us where we stand and how humble we ought to be before the Lord foreign years of suffering in the wilderness God brought his children out with the mighty hand the land of Egypt we all know they're about to cross the Jordan here's what Moses had to say hear o Israel Thou Art the Passover Jordan This Day we're about to pass over our Jordan today to go into possessive Nations greater and mightier than thyself cities Great and fenced up to heaven a people great and Tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou has heard say who can stand before the children of Enoch understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and Destroy them quickly as the Lord has said unto thee it's big not thou in thine heart after that the Lord thy God hath cast him out from before thee saying we don't want to be puffed up now listen for my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord have driven have dried them out Duck Drive them out from before thee not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart thus thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee that he may perform the word which the Lord swear unto thy fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh my but if you read over in Galatians Paul begins to talk about a new New Covenant a better Covenant that the blood of bulls and goats could come back upon a man but there was one perfect sacrifice that was given it's not by our righteousness but by us his righteousness man the word of the Lord says in him we live and move and have our being says and in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily and we heard just recently Brothers said he put those two scriptures together in my mind he said you are a portion of the body of Christ in the age that you're living in now think of that he's not going to forsake himself he chose a bride he spoke a bride he fills that bride and he Weds that bride I mean then he goes to live forever with that bride amen what a blessing what a blessing I want to read something that a few weeks ago I was up here and I felt like I wanted to read it and I just didn't do it but I feel like the time is right this morning to do it maybe it'll help someone here and brother Brahm is speaking in Redemption by judgment and prior to his message sometimes he tells a little story an event and it just precedes a point that he wants to bring out and is so edifying and blessing to us if we're just mind what he has to say here and he's talking about ups and downs he said oh if you just had my ups and downs and he said a little lady visited a certain doctor here not long ago and the little doctor was a cursing and a jumping up and down and carrying on the lady said to him I wouldn't do that if I was in your place doctor it sounds astounding that a woman would tell the doctor that he said if you had my worries well you'd do it too he said or she said oh I have as many words as you and I don't do it anyhow so that got the doctor right in the right place that's right he respected the little lady ever since that's it and this I think when he was coming to just a word in season will do it see no matter what your worries is what your Temptations are stand on God's word when all everything seems to be going wrong stand on God's word peace said so amen may that be a comfort to us psalm 90. what a blessing if you look at verse 17 it says let the beauty of the Lord Our God be upon us in Psalms 27 David talked about going to the house of the Lord flip over here quickly he says for I have desired one thing have I desired of the Lord that I will seek after then I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquiring his Temple amen it's beautiful this morning let's read it together if we would Lord thou Hast been our Dwelling Place in all generations before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou has formed the earth and the world even from Everlasting to Everlasting Thou Art God thou turnest man to destruction and say Us return ye Children of Men for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is passed and as a watch in the night thou carries them away as with the flood they are as asleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withering for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we troubled thou has sent our iniquities before thee our secret sins of the light of thy countenance for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told the days of our years are three score years and ten and if my reason of strength day before score Years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom return O Lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days make us glad according to the days wherein thou has Afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil let thy Work appear unto thy servants and thy Glory unto their children and let the beauty of the Lord Our God be upon us and establish now the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands established thou yet blessed be the name of the Lord amen God bless you may have your seeds okay let's sing Power in the Blood Power in the Blood amen oh would you be free from your burden for all there's power in the blood oh power in the blood is [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] fall in the blinds holding my precious foreign thank you foreign foreign on the ground foreign [Music] when foreign [Music] this morning [Music] oh my name is [Music] [Music] restaurants [Music] [Music] amen is coming to take away all of the sins and amen to make you holy this morning amen Santiago has a testimony and a special even if he could come at this time it's joking God bless you my brethren God bless you I have a short testimony and I wrote it down because you know I don't speak fluent English it is very difficult for me to stand before you at this moment there is something that is hard for me to do is to say A Farewell message I was here in America for 10 long years and it's full of struggles nobody knows but me I don't have any desire coming here in this country because I foresee the things that I'll get through here and it's still until now just please pray for me and if you ever want to pray for me it's not to have Bridges or to be known but just pray that I can stay in the hands of Christ that it can mold me and use me in any way that this is fit me to do I'll pray the same thing for you my brother and before I leave I want to leave a message I urge you to always pray and love our pastor Brother David I love him so dearly he's more than a brother to me in place I owe him many wonderful things that he engraved in my heart and I may never forget it all my life let me share to you a very relevant passage that I copied from a Christian about being a pastor it is not isitas a pastor is a preacher a Shepherd a steward a burden beer a guidance counselor an Innkeeper a Peter of the black a nurturer of faith a prayer Warrior a director of Church events and moderator between grieving parties a peace negotiator a security office a manager of church resources a song leader and sometimes a janitor as well let us love our pastor and pray for him without the pastor the local church will be in chaos and confusion an evangelist can be a fireball a teacher can offer you deep wisdom an apostle can do Mission field a prophet can prophesy and see visions but none can compare the workload a workload of a pastor is the ox of the team I thank the Lord for this great privilege and honor fellowshipping with you to worship Him and serving the lord and Gathering like this God bless you I want to sing a special to my Lord I don't know how to sing but for the glory of my Lord I'll sing I know you know this song some golden they break some glorious

lift you up he will be enough to get you through when the road is long and you want to quit cause you think you've got nothing left to give you can fall apart fall into his arms He will carry you when you get the kind of news that you hope you'd never hear when you're chasing down a dream just to watch it disappear when somebody that you love they turn in a walk away and they leave you standing there which shattered faith you don't have to pick up all the broken pieces you don't have to try to cover up the scars you are loved and you can always run to Jesus just as you are He will carry you when you can't go on he'll be your strength when your strength is gone he will lift you up he will be known to get you through when the road is long and you want to quit cause you think you've got nothing left to give you can fall apart fall into his arms He will carry you his heart is never weary no he's never tired through the toughest fight through the longest night through the flooding through the fire He will carry you and you can't go on he'll be your strength when your strength is gone he will lift you up he won't be enough to get you through when the road is [Music] into his arms He will carry you He will carry you amen how many want to be carried this morning amen is here to carry you through to make sure that you make it through amen that's his promise to us and that has returned to the word man not when are we just sing Worthy is the Lamb amen just to be reminded this morning that is the Lamb who took the book and and he opened the seals and it's the same lamb

how futile our efforts are and how weak and unable we are even to overcome the smallest things [Music] but Lord we believe that your grace and your mercy is sufficient for us and that your strength is made perfect in our weaknesses and father we look to that great Fountain this morning of love that you have for us that you are mindful of us lord it's beyond our comprehension why that you would lay down your life for such as we are father but you so love the world you gave us a kinsman redeemer and he was faithful and true and revealed you to us father in the greatness that you are and we are so grateful for that this morning we just ask that you'd help us and bless us we ask these things this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn over to Matthew the 17th chapter in we're just going to see how this morning goes I'd like to play a little portion of sermon for us this morning um also it's uh you know like you say kind of Bittersweet in many ways to see brother James and sister Ellen and brother anafu and sister Mercedes go back to the Philippines but they came over here and they worked for so many years until they could get their retirement and while we were here many days I would sit with brother James and he would just pour its heart out to me about his son and and uh you know how broken-hearted he was his son wasn't serving the lord and I remember one day in the office we prayed together and and we just determined in our heart that we are going to win that victory and now his son got converted and preaching the gospel and has a church so I mean it's marvelous for him to go back you know I I I've never had any desire ever in my heart to go to the Philippines I I don't know why I'm but now I've got a reason if I ever to go there so uh We've watched God do a lot of things and a great love and and the great humility of our brother and we're certainly going to miss him but you know he's a part of us and that's the beautiful thing about this message once you really have it in your heart it binds you together to Believers like you just can't believe it it really makes us one body amen so let's read this morning and we're just going to Fellowship I have no idea what direction uh we're gonna go this morning I just have a little something on my heart that I'd like to share play a little portion of tape and just it says in the 17th chapter of the Book of Matthew and and we know that right before this and the 16th chapter is where uh Peter makes the great profession that out the Christ the son of the Living God and and Jesus says Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and he said and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and we know that's the divine revelation of who that he is it says now after six days Jesus taketh Peter James in John his brother and bringeth them up unto the high mountain apart now our messenger says that Peter represented Faith James represented hope and John represented love every Christian ought to go with faith hope and love in their heart so there was three Witnesses on Earth he says and he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his Remnant was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him that's our three Witnesses in heaven then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if that will let us make thee three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias and while yet he spoke Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye Him Father we ask you to bless your word to us and your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this morning we're drawing our inspiration this morning uh from the message that our messenger preached in Spokane Washington uh on July 11th um 1962 and the the sermon is hear ye him and uh I certainly believe that's something that we need to do more than ever is hear ye him and so we like just a fellowship a little bit this morning and at to encourage us a little bit about how we hear from them how does God speak to you how does he talk to you we know that he speaks to a prophet uh lift a year and uh we don't always have that uh ability because we're not made that way a lot of people would think oh I'd like to hear God speak to me uh I think you would scare um I don't know the only expression I have to scare the liver out of you you know what I mean but it would it would be a fearful thing to have God speak you know we we like it when God's kind of far away but uh but a prophet can hear him lift the ear some have gifts of Dreams some may see Visions uh but God has a way that he talks to us every day in our life and we just kind of want to maybe get to that point in a little bit about the necessity of understanding that and how that he leads you because the footsteps of the righteous are LED of the Lord and we that's our desire in our heart is to be led of the Lord so how does he lead us how does he speak to us how does he guide us in the everyday occurrences of life and we don't ever want to get so spiritual that we're of no Earth is it's a Living Word it actually is coming to pass around us every day one of the great things of this age that we pray for especially in this hour of this age that we live in this lady you'll see it age this time when the world is once again is in a Sodom condition it is as it was in the days of Noah where people are married and given into marriage and there's no stability the the greatest loss of of the curse of the age of Noah and people being married and given into marriage is it destroys the home it destroys the family value and we've noticed a lot in our society right now that there's a lot of uproar uh because uh of what the school systems of the world are are teaching children and they now they've realized that 47 percent of Americas are now considering homeschooling their children because what's being taught but they don't understand that they reap this right do they turn their kids over to the to the stools and they turn them over to the public school system and they turned them over to society so the mothers could work and the fathers could work and that they could get their houses and their homes and all of a sudden now their kids are are showing up at their door and and walking into their house and saying a mama I don't think I'm a girl I think I'm a boy you know what I mean and they're starting to hear all these things that they're being taught and and all of a sudden the parents now are desperately trying to get back and get control of Education to get control of their children you know they put them in front of the one-eyed monster so so long that that they've their thinking has gone away and and so the the we realize that things are falling apart the problem is that it's probably to the point of no return you know what I'm saying it's gone but we're here this morning you took the time this morning to uh to prepare and come out to church and make the sacrifice because you believe there's another life you believe in even Beyond this life a Christian Life is a good way to live if there was no Heavenly reward and take this in the way I'm saying it if if it was just a matter of what lifestyle that you would choose a Christian life is still the best life there is but added on to this great life is eternal life so this is a life that we're just getting a foretaste of of to this life that we have in Christ Jesus is just of foretaste of things to come just a little bit of a blessing to us the peace The Joy the happiness that's her path is understand standing the good things of God it is just a foretaste it hasn't even entered into the hearts and the minds of men the things that God has prepared for them that love them oh if you think it's good here I'm telling you it's I it's it I don't have words to describe it I can't even begin to utter the glory of the things that God's got for his children but the great struggle is is we don't want to miss it we don't want to miss the rapture we want to make the rapture we want to be serious and and and deeply committed to making that journey to being prepared for that to being enrapturing condition if in other words what if it profeth a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul the Lord put just such an effort out in the years of his ministry here on Earth to let us know that there is a kingdom there is a land beyond the river there is a life worth living for that this world is temporary that this world will be destroyed that this world is not our home in my father's Health are many mansions if it were not so I would not have told you I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also and I come again to receive you that you might be where I am also and I know Christianity Today is getting to be something that's foolish because man no longer wishes to retain God in it in their knowledge they don't even want to consider God and the more they take God out of their thinking the crazier their thinking gets yes all kinds of places everywhere whatever thing comes to their imagination but we want to be sober we want to be diligent we want to be purposed we want to have a clear vision and a clear understanding of the path that we're on we want our footsteps to be ordered by the Lord we don't want to just haphazardly live a life and then come down at the end of the road and look up and say oh what do I get no I want to settle it right now amen I want to be assured in my heart that I'm packing the ticket I want to know beyond of a shadow of a doubt that I'm born of the spirit of God that there's no question again we're not here to uh belabor the point we're not here to to condemn anybody this morning but what we are saying is we want to be able to consciously look in the mirror of God and ask ourselves am I ready am I mad do I have that token do I have that Blessed assurance and if you don't it's freely given amen he wants to truly freely give it and so I think uh one of the great things that is needed of all of us individually and as a church body is to really recognize the day that we live in and understand what the message is to us as Believers this morning what would it be that God would want to deal with our hearts about what what could we receive of him this morning that would focus Us in on what we need to be focused in to reveal to us the things that are vanity the things that aren't worth our effort I always Marvel at this kids that spend so many days and hours just you know in this phony electronic game okay what does it pay out you know if if you know lots of dollars come spewing out of the their phone you think well they're doing this for a reason but what they've done is they've ate up time and they've ate up their brain cells and let me say this this morning that God has allotted you a period of time I don't know how many days that he has allotted ahead of me he's allotted me 70 uh of three some years and months and hours and days to this point but I'm held accountable for the time that God gives you and you're held accountable for the time what do you use that time for and and do you value the time that God's given you do you value your life and it's not too late I don't care how old you are it's not too late it's not too late for me to have a Revival it's not too late for me to reset my course it's not too late for me to clean up my life and to apply the token and to say that with the days that I've got left I'm going to use it for the kingdom of God but just don't be drifted toss to and fro by every wind to Doctrine out on the Seas of time but I'll give an anchor set in your life and that's what we wanted to just get to this morning is about being able to have God deal with our hearts and I'd like to read a few statements and I thought I found this true if Keith and this is in this same message that we're talking about on paragraph five he said today we find our places churches organizations and so forth begin to weaken again after this great Revival that had just swept the land we find out that that they add a little here or break down a little here or something over here that just can't work it never will work God would not let it work at first till we find out things are starting to weaken how many know is that okay I mean people aren't more Americans don't go to church now he used to 68 75 of America went to church now it's below 50 percent it's weakened the the power of God is weakened the spirit of God is weak and the the the it's just he tells us and he's warning us it's it's weakened we're living in a weakened Society you'll hear some more great statements that he makes he says and he says the reason for that is is the Revival is over so there was a time that there was a great a great outpouring of the spirit God was moving convicting people dealing the spirit of God was moving people were giving their hearts to the Lord there was a great move of of the spirit of God moving on America and it was given our country its last call but that's died down it's gone away and he makes this statement he says of course according to history Revival only lasts about three years and then revivalists lasted about that long then they live on the reputation of what they was in those three years that's something isn't it you know they they have three great years maybe of ministry and now they just live back off of the reputation of what they was I don't want to live on what I was I want to live for what I can be he says now he says he says he says of course he says now we find the Revival the interest of the people has fallen all together away now a 20-minute sermon is is a long time 15 years ago you could stay all night long and all day and all night and just keep on I stayed eight days and eight nights without leaving the platform and there was five times as many there as there was when we it started but now just a little while tired see the people can't help it that's the Revival's over so uh it's it's like it's like uh if I could say that pointing out this is what that you're up against you are now up against the fact that you're living in a fallen away Society people aren't interested in God 20 minutes sermon is is too long the people are just tired I'm tired I'm hot there's nothing there to uh to uh create that that zeal so it behooves us that we recognize the effect of the atmosphere around us and and the day that we live in what it is that our enemy is that this spiritual Amnesia that the world's trying to put on us the the pressure that they're trying to put on us the difficulty to being a Christian that they're trying to put on us and we we we we we got if we see it and we recognize it then we got to realize we we got to stand up against what's trying to defeat us it is no good standing at the front door with the shotgun and leaving your back door unlocked you know you got to fight your enemy where your enemy's at and he's very deceptive and then I just wanted to read this because it's we serve a great God he said this is in paragraph 14 I believe he says now it's a little different here because you find here the people's becomes more or less uh chance uh taking gospel hardened but here you can teach you you can't teach them intellectual religion now this is what he's saying you can't teach them intellectual religion because they won't receive it you pass them tracks or go in and start talking about Christ or things like that they'll walk away and leave you standing there see they won't listen to you mohammons or or none of them because they have an intellectual religion I've got to see something positive something in action see it with their own eyes stand there and look at it see it spoken of the word and then come to pass that's what they look for once like that and then it's all over they're really believe it then in other words people aren't going to accept it intellectually anymore look your spirit and the the the Inner Man In You the seed in you is no longer going to accept an intellectual religion you yourselves have to reject the intellectual you start rejecting yourself you start rejecting your own religion you start rejecting your own intellect you so I said I don't want this kind of religion I just don't want to be taught I just don't want to hear them say brother Bram said this brother REM said that again I don't want it to be intellectual to me there's a deep inside the believer that's calling for a reality now look at what he said the Revival's over harder to be a Christian than ever you're meeting more resistance nobody wants intellectual they want to see something well do you realize that that real hunger is in you it's been a long Cry Of My Heart Lord I just don't want someone to come up here and pray for me lay hands on them pray a prayer for him and then say to them you go away according you know you go believe it for yourself what part did I play in them I just did a little religious ceremony but I want to be able for my faith to connect with their faith until something happens and that's what the people are looking for something that they can see that said see that spoken and see it come to pass see we're only on the say side and the speak side we need to get over to where we have the faith for the come to pass sign and he says this he goes on he said he says they'll really believe it then so God is just as much God tonight as he ever was in other words unbelief doesn't stop God this cold formal religion this doesn't stop God God still is real still is powerful can still do for you exceedingly abundantly above what you can think or ask he's still Divine he's still Supernatural that hasn't changed so what's changed the environment around the believer the believer is losing their understanding and their ability to communicate with God amen yeah and I'm talking Beyond just sitting down and reading your Bible and feeling of inspiration I'm talking about how are the footsteps of the righteous LED of the Lord every day how does he deal with you how does he communicate with you how do you know it's him how how does he talk to you and so he's he's as the Everest that's true we believe him like that we believe he heals the sick he saves the Lost he fills with the Holy Ghost those who have hunger hearts and waiting for him amen is that your great heart's desire he says may we purpose in our hearts tonight to be quiet before the Lord wait upon him wait Moment by moment expecting the right word to be said or the right thing to be done that would give us the appropriate faith that would Dash right in to the blessings of God that's quite a statement that would that we would we would purpose in our hearts to be quiet before the Lord until the right thing is said the right thing is done that appropriates the faith in us that we can Dash into the blessing of God that we can catch a glimpse of the blessing of God and run into it it's hard to come into church and quiet your spirit it's it's quiet and hard to sit there waiting for the right thing to be said the right thing to be done everything becomes common we don't think God speaks we don't think God deals with us we don't think he knows what we're going through we we almost get to the point that we think that he's far away and he's not mindful of us but he is mindful of you he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he's still Supernatural do you believe that and so we we recognize that he says now let us be real sincere and hopeful now that what we have asked for it would be wrong to ask for something and then disbelieve it this paragraph 24 in the book that I'm using he says disbelieving see we don't we don't get enough sincerity with our worship you know can I throw another word in here we don't just focus on the worship if we don't focus on the words we don't focus on the present it comes time to worship we like the ham we like the melody uh you know I love it but when you begin to Worship You focus on him you draw his face in you to look upon his faith you're sincere you recognize his presence your whole attitude you're you're the atmosphere you're creating okay it's not for granted you you get sincere about it I mean you're singing praises to the Lord you know your kids don't want you know someone to I mean you ever talk to somebody and they're talked into yeah and talking on the phone they're not sincere about that conversation they're not sincere about what you have to say there's no anticipation could you hear what he said he said let's re real sincere and hopeful now that the things that we ask for we're going to receive now if I say this because he just told us that everything's falling away is starting to die out it's starting to get dim look if you're sitting in the drought then you've got to realize I better give some spiritual water I better get sincere about my soul how sincere would you get if the Lord came down here not me but he actually appeared here this morning Atkins stood here visible before your eyes and said only eight souls in here are going have any of you considered you might go to hell well I don't believe you're going to go to hell but I want to certainly make sure I'm not I don't want to chance it I don't want to walk on the guard rail on the edge of a cliff saying I hope I don't fall off I hope I don't fall off you know what I mean I hope a wind don't come I hope the rail don't break no we don't stay on the edge we move right as far close to the mountain as we can be that isn't no skill it ain't no skill to see how close to the world you can be and how you can come into church forget that make full account of your salvation make your election and calling sure that's the scripture make your election and calling sure apply the token get every questionable thing out of the way let's make the last mile of this road don't don't there's no need Faking It you're not faking me out I can't tell if you're a Christian or not I mean I could judge the way you dress you know and I might be able to measure what I think you know or don't know but other than that I can't tell you know who does know though you know you know if the Lord appeared today you know whether you've been back in the shed smoking dope or you've been out doing this or doing that you know that nobody else knows nobody else needs to know but there's one that does know he knows so it might be smart for us to say hey he knows I know he knows maybe me and him ought to get on the same page try to get things right right he said he said we must be deeply sincere I wonder can you hear all right he talks about hearing all writing about and he says now just be yourself simple humble waiting for the coming of the Lord now we don't believe in glamor something Shining you know I always said Hollywood shines but Christianity glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing Hollywood shines with plate class Society oh glamor but the Christian glows with humility the way up is always down now I trust that everyone will be filled with the Holy Spirit and now before you can be filled with the Holy Spirit you've got to die to yourself first in order to be born again amen and with that comment there I would like to go over and and uh pick up where I would like to uh I take the prophet of God goes for a little section where he explains what James John and every things talked about you can get the message and read it but I want to listen for about 21 minutes this morning and then I'll close with a few comments together okay Peter and them on the Mountain and all of the symbols and types that are lying there the deity and the Lord says hear ye him so that's what emphasizing this morning hear ye him when he speaks do you hear what what does he use to reach you and to touch you and so in this 21 minutes he he he might not say that exactly the way that I'm saying it but listen and to see what it is that the spirit's doing as our Messengers preaching to this people how is he trying to reach him how what's he trying to get to him what's he trying to create in their heart what's he trying to bring to their mind well to what what is he trying to get him to focus on and maybe through listening to this it it'll be a a great uh a blessing to you and would just go forward uh from there because I think it's our uh our great understanding and may I say this before we listen to this part I'd like to hear this is what the messenger says remember the Bible said the Holy Ghost only sealed those who sigh and cry for the Abomination that was did in the city I'd like to take your Pastor out take the other pastors here how many members of your church that's laid on their face and cried nightly daily for the Abomination done in the city there see the Zeals all gone I hope we can fire up our Zeal this morning would you listen with me this morning to 21 minutes of our messenger listen and see if if he could speak to your heart okay so I I think it's uh I don't know what paragraph they have but this is from the message I guess you could have a device uh it's it's 40 a paragraph 47 I have I don't know what it is in some other form but I think I got mine from the table so uh paragraph 47 listen to what our messenger has to say and I believe it's for us this morning don't you amen Lord bless you just 21 minutes thank you foreign Peter called it the Holy Mountain because the holy God had been on this mountain and before God does anything usually on the earth he usually speaks of It Out of Heaven first did you ever notice that he always speaks from Heaven first the supernatural always manifest itself and then comes down and to the people if you notice before Israel was called out of Egypt Moses had tried to do that believing that he was the outfit yeah that's where we're finishing yeah paragraph 47 I'm sorry uh no it's uh now uh now in the Old Testament we find in the books of the New Testament also in Galatians just okay that uh yeah ours don't match up um do you find it there yeah all right yes thank you all right great okay now in the Old Testament we find in the books of the New Testament also in Galatians and so how Paul explaining it he was placing a son like in the Old Testament now when a father had a a great a kingdom you notice and uh over here also in the Bible it says Matthew the uh 24th chapter I believe it is or no Saint John the 14th chapter I'll take that one another English interpretation of it says in My Father's House is many mansions doesn't that sound kind of strange to us today in My Father's House is many mansions mansions in a little house many mentions in a house ICF another uh and the translators that translated that for the king see in that day a kingdom was called a house and the father was a king over the house in my father's kingdom is many mentions as the right way the a Hebrew way of interpreting our moffatt made it worse than ever in my father's apartment houses many apartments like we were going up there to that shows what a carnal mind can do with the word of God that's right our studio not long ago in Athens Greece and seen the picture painted of what they call Adam Eve that Eve was the most hideous looking thing I ever seen in my life and Adam looked like some prehistoric giant why it goes to show that what the carnal conception of what God's creation is it takes the spirit of God to reveal pain and God's word is revealed only by his Spirit rides hid from the eyes of wise and reveal to bathe such as we'll learn your God was standing there now he was doing exactly what he asked them to do now in a father's great heritage where he had he had many Hard Men working for him now this is a little teaching here I hope it don't hurt but I just won't make a point your face started right that when we get started we'll be on the right foot notice now when a baby son was born into this family all of this father he was born a son but yet he had no inheritance just as a son now there's where I think that we Full Gospel people let down a little bit on our Doctrine see we take a person say well nice deal with the Holy Ghost he speaks with tongues that's it no you just only began yeah yeah you've just been born into the family that's all that's the reason today that we are churches is not progressing the way they should be I think after this great revivalists swept the world in these last few years I think the saints of God ought to be in the heavenlies everywhere and the power of God going into hospitals and everywhere else and great signs and wonders and miracles taking place but he can't get the people stand still long enough if we sow denominational seeds we reap a denominational Harvest exactly that's what we've done if you notice that word there in the Hebrew former and lattering farmering means a sowing ring and then when the spirit Falls it falls on the just and unjust if we sold denominational seeds we just reap the denominational Harvest that's what we've done the Baptist took a million more and 44. hard to tell what they are nice the great advantages Billy Graham and many of them are swept look at our Pentecostals through oral Robertson Tommy Osborne and great man like that well what have we done we've had members got better churches bigger membership what we need is quality not quantity that's the hunting of the Bride today Ella easer had an awful time finding finding quality and then to get her ready to go was the next thing after he found him so that's that's the next thing to do we're hunting for that now the Holy Spirit God's servant as Eliza was his hunting for that quality that genuineness that's something that won't take back on God's word will stay in our liver down a weak service down here at Grass Valley on Abraham only seed and so forth how did that genuine Royal seat of Abraham holds that word regardless of how ridiculous it sounds or anything else he stays right with it because he's the Seed of Abraham right now notice in the Old Testament now this boy when he was born into a family now the first thing the father did after he got old enough to begin to be tough is his son when he's born certainly he's the family name he's got it but he has no inheritance yet you have to find out what kind of a person that's going to be before he has an inheritance now the father to be sure that that son had the right training hunted the very best tutor that he could find and he never got one that would just pull punches to find favor or something like that say well I'll make a report on the boy he's doing all right because the father might lift me up a little he's going to get somebody's going to tell him the truth and he and now if the boy did real well how the the tutor liked to walk up to the father with a good honest faith and faith and say yes sir your son is doing fine but I would be shameful if you'd walk up there and tell her his boy is a renegade how he had hate to do that now I wonder today that when God has called his Pentecostal church about 50 years ago I wonder if and when he called the church at the beginning what kind of a tutor did he put over the church yeah he sent the Holy Spirit to be the tutor and today we've twisted around with Bishops and Cardinals and popes and everything else with all kinds of ecclesiastical ideas and dogmas it's added and tuck away from that Bible to other people don't know what to believe amen right amen they don't know which way to turn yes the poor people like a bunch of sheep having a snow Shepherd a bunch of geese without a leader that's right they don't know which way to fly everything it's just gone every way this says this way I'm listening this way and well they don't know what to believe but God sent to his church the holy spirit amen that's the tutor and that tutor will tell the truth before God amen he he teaches the children the word in the beginning was a word and the word is with God and the Word was God will judge the church as I said a while ago by his word the Bible said I felt that come to me the Bible said in your the God would judge his church by Jesus Christ that's right and Jesus is the word amen so it's a word made manifest if Christ Still Remains Christ he takes that word and manifests amen there you are it's a word living among us coming to life now this tutor what if that boy was awful he wasn't about the father's business you just do anything how that tutor would be a shame to walk up before the father and say sir I I hate to tell you but your boy is just not doing very well I imagine it blush turn his face away what do you think the Holy Spirit does today when he comes up before God our Father with the report from the church that we broke up in 900 different organizations won't have Fellowship one with another and everybody got this that and the other nobody just want to make more members bringing in more this and that I imagine he turns his head I could say something right Bernie here it might hurt but you know this is the House of Correction you believe it I'm glad you said that I mean Sylvia what are you thinking God would do today when the Holy Spirit comes and tells him it in our churches that we've accepted dogma's instead of his word what do you think we accept Creeds instead of Christ what do you think he does when our when he comes up and says that his daughters is all bobbed off their hair wearing sharks smoking cigarettes that's the Bible said such can't enter the misfleet you said don't make any difference don't you let the devil tell you that if God said so Paul said in your Galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel in this life preach let him be a curse why did it make it makes it over his shoulder and turn to a pillar of salt you've got to take the word amen there's a lion somewhere we've got to get back to the gospel back to Christ back to the Living Word not bypass it for some something this way you've got to believe it well if you're going to say they don't believe in healing anymore your stripes wasn't vain to them because they say days of Miracles has passed oh he must have to blush when he says that before the father Yes see they don't they don't believe it they're getting away from it day by day falling farther and further away you know that you don't have to think about some of you old people have been in this longer than I have looked back a few years ago what it was all night prayer meetings amen what do you do tonight let out on Wednesday night maybe by six o'clock or seven o'clock maybe don't even come to pray maybe you want to go see some old filthy television thing of some woman married four or five times to some man or man married four or five times then say you love God staying away from prayer meetings watch we love Susie or Elvis Presley or some of them guys that sold their birthrights for a mess of Elvis Presley was a Pentecostal boy sent more souls to hell and Judas ever would sure cause taking these young girls and they say well he's very religious don't you believe such a thing as that religious Satan is too it's always Cain don't you believe that it's just the devil's worst to get you kids out there on them floors all this blogly Wiggly and all that nonsense twisting all kinds of stuff out there vulgar living half dress some of Youth Pentecostal women's ashamed that's right you man will let them do it you're worse than they are but doing it right a man supposed to be the room of his own house and what do we got today no wonder we can't have faith no one that can't be a healing services in America we got away from God Amen not long ago I stood there in South Africa at a meeting one day and seen as many as 10 000 native women didn't know right left hand naked is to come in this world and receive Christ as personal Savior and while they were standing there with their hands up and receiving when they dropped their hands they folded their hands to walk away covering up as much of them as he could Holy Ghost himself making them know they were naked how can you say that but blanket native who knows nothing about God received the Holy Ghost and realize they're naked and these American women stripping every year came to be singing in choirs and Christians supposed to be there's something wrong somewhere and it ain't the god of his Bible amen and you know as you know Wonder we can't have revivals or we can't pass into this no wonder that things can't happen the Tudors coming before the father shaking his hand oh my that's terrible the way they're doing well that's true what's the matter some little ticket meal ticket or something or a little something if somebody's afraid to say something that's God's word reach it or leave it alone now strange thing some lady said to me not long ago I made a remark after coming back she's had a lot of manicure on you know the you know the brothers called it the I seen one the other day honestly I felt this I was Eclipse as a businessman's breakfast and I was standing out there waiting for Brother to argue about to come up and one of these women come up these water head haircuts and one of the great big things like that I never seen such a outfit in my life that that might have been a nice looking woman but she looked like a prehistoric animal because she was standing there I I ain't saying that for a joke that's this is no place for joking this is the Bible this is God's Trina and there she stood there with with blue over her eyes and and read over the top of that and oh I I said I'm a I see plegri I've seen leprosy but I never seen anything like that I thought the woman I thought the woman was sick and I walked over two years ago to ask her I tell her I say sister uh pardon me but I'm a missionary I pray for the sick could I help you and just about time my hair come two three more women up the same way and I thought you don't mean to tell me these American Americans are acting like that I could see the natives out there do that that's a heathen Drake I can see them put mud in their face and things make color but nothing enough what civilized people is supposed to be you talk about civilization we're the whole Pinnacle swung backwards it's exactly right amen all such a disgrace I said something about it one time the lady met me outside she said Mr random I'll give you to understand I'm Pentecostal I said well praise the Lord and act like it she said well she said do you think it's wrong and for a woman you said about a woman putting on a man's garment I said the Bible said she said I don't wear shorts she said I'll wear slacks I said that's worse the Bible says some Abomination for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man right God is infinite God can never change amen his decision is perfect show me one time God changes he doesn't he made the recommendation of the Garden of Eden that's the only place to worship God was God but it's always the only glorifies you've heard him say that the whole time I shall not killed but I say to you whosoever is angry with his brother you hear him say thy son I commit adultery but I say unto you whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her listen here and she said well I'll tell you now she said um uh they don't make clothes like uh like that I said they still make sewing machines and sell Goods there's no no excuses either you're just gonna be left without an excuse listen let me ask you to say this one thing and we'll leave the subject because that's for your pastors but I just this that you know what I think about it now look when you come to the Judgment ball did you know you can be condemned right there for committing adultery yet be just as pure as a living Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a woman the lust after and some of you women let your girls go out there and and put on them pose and walk out there now walk that sinner comes down the street and looks up on that woman lustly he's going to have to answer for it at the day of judgment for committing adultery who did it who's guilty she was for presenting herself like that it's exactly right don't fall out with me talk god about it that's right but that's what the Holy Ghost comes up before the father said how could we ever build a church up on something like that amen how can listen France it's time to clean the from the top of the pulpit come to the janitor down there and start over it's just like a bunch of you take the birds lay their eggs in the springtime and the old mother bird can lay a nest the eggs and she not don't have to be with her mate but she can lay them eggs and she can hover them she can turn them and she can stay there until she Stars herself and she gets the poor she can't get off the nest and they'll never hatch while they're rotten they're rot right in the nest that's just what's the matter today we just took in so many members and so forth and bathing him here and babe in America just got a nest full of rock Mage it's time to clean the thing out and get them people with the make Christ Jesus with the word of God back in action [Applause] then you'll see Christ riding on the scene on the power he cannot come as long as these things are blocking him that's right no wonder the tutor come up before the father and bless us and say yeah your church yeah I know it says that but they don't do it you mean they're not they're not doing it there you are what a disgrace what a Pity that must be before the father when the tutor comes up the Holy Spirit and brings that cause he is our tutor we know that huh now this the and the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible the Bible said so man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible so the Bible is written by inspiration there's no private interpretation it's just the way it's wrote right there just take it and believe it act on it God will bring it to pass I've never seen him promise anything yet but what he done you'll always do it now here comes the here comes the tutor up now what if his he comes up before the father how he feels ma comes up and says oh your son is progressing he's just like a chip off the old block as we call it down the South he's just exactly like you he's just so interested in all the sick and The Afflicted he's so interested in the salvation of the people he's so interested in all this he believes every word you said you know what he's running a church just exactly like you'd run it if you were there you know the way your son run it when he was there yes that's the same way he's doing it and you know you had wrote in there he's the same yesterday today and forever yes well that's just exactly what they're doing oh my ah how the Folly must say that's my son that's my child that's the reason he could smile here Jesus had carried out every word of them that's it you carried out just exactly to the word now because he was that perfect son and he is the same and he died to become the vine that we might become the branch that he could energize us with his life to make the same life that he had living in US they would do the same thing Jesus said in Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen now we watch what he done see we're having time tonight but we'll take it up later and see what his Works was maybe tomorrow night then see if he'll perform that same works if he does he Remains the Same now then God will be pleased with that but when we go around saying well I tell you we belong to the so-and-so and I I asked the woman at one time on a prayer line I said are you a Christian she said I'll give you to understand she said I burn a candle every night like that had anything to do with Christianity burning a cantile every night I said well that no more than slopping Hogs every night see I said that wouldn't be a bit more to me I said are you born again you know Christ as your savior has it become a real reality are you living in Christ is Christ Living in you that day you Lord I am in the Father the father me you and I and you that's it God living among these people that's the way and we find out on this day now we take if that son had been a good son he was just exactly now remember he was a born son I don't miss this he was a born son but year after year he progressed he was constantly about the father's business you've done the work just exactly where the father did how the tutors said oh that's wonderful tell a father why it's just exactly where you'd run it if you were there he bawled out this he condemned this he give this a place he done this just exactly the way you do no different just exactly it's just like you there it's your life ain't even sure because you sure tell he's the son of God because he was born after you see he does the same thing stays right with your word never misses a word stays right into it punches it right on through oh the father must say that's wonderful and there come a day then if this son continued on there come a day that what they call the placing of a son then the father called a group of people together in the city he took his own son and dressed him in a lovely robe and set him up high so everybody could see had a ceremony and he adopted his own son that had been born into his home are placed him and when he did that son's name after that was just as good as the father's name on the chapter whatever his signature them days there was a seal of wrinkles many of them Couldn't Write there's a Penitentiary offense to ever to copy that seal they had on the back of the ring and they would and I said like that and he could wear his father's ring why his name is just as good as the fathers was now that's what God's trying to get his church to a place that where we are Sons and Daughters of God see but we're we're in trouble we're letting everything and now the the world trying to smother the real thing down is trying to make people scared of Communism don't you just be a spirit are the common isn't that's nothing amen amen let's just take a few quick remarks and then we'll close this morning that's the reason he could smile Jesus had carried out every word of it he carried out just exactly to the word now because he was the perfect son and he is the same and he died to become the vine that we might become the branches that he can energize us with his life to make the same life that he had live in US then we'll do the same thing see if I have this uh he says now that's what God's trying to get his church to to a place that where we our sons and daughters of God but we were troubled we're letting everything now the world's trying to smother the real thing down is trying to make people to scare the communism so the world's trying to smother the same thing now now I there's two things that I want to say here in closing and in a couple uh scriptures and and I wanted okay so we know what God's purpose is now I know you're struggling against the world I know you're struggling against the flash I know the Revival's over I've tried to lay that all out there you've got plenty of excuses to sit in the nest and rot okay I sympathize with you okay but I think God is by saying those things to us there's two things that are transpiring here one is called conviction God's deals and speaks to you through two Avenues and I don't have other ways to describe it so I'll try to give you some scriptures and not bog you down but I hope that you can just grasp this God's God to deal with you concerning the Inner Man just look in the scripture to start Romans 7 7 22. just Romans 7 22 Will Will just read that scripture really quick he says he says he says for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man if you read second Corinthians 4 and 16. second Corinthians 4 and 16. he says for which cause we faint not but through our outward man though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day amen let's read Ephesians 3 and 16. Ephesians 3 and 16. Paul says this he says whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with the might by his spirit in the inward man and so God is dealing so you have all these outward things all the revivals over nobody's interested in God you're living in Lady of SIA okay so you've got all this lousy world that we live in and there's nothing from the outside that's inspiring you to be a Christian there's no reward in this world but reproach as a brother told me the other day he said Just remember Brother David no good deed goes unpunished if if and that's the way it is right all right so if you're going to let this amnesia could this this we live in perilous times if you're going to let the darkness if you're going to let all all the excuses all the condition of the world if you're going to allow that to paralyze you and and become the hindrance to rise up and stop you well well then you're stuck dead in your tracks but we got to break through he's saying well God's trying to get us to where we can walk in the power and the faith of his word that we can be stimulated so there's a lot of Oppression and then I agree everybody wants to be popular nobody wants to be Christian the world don't want to hear about Christianity your job don't want to hear about Christianity your school don't want to hear about Christianity they don't want your ideas they don't want your thoughts so that's what he said you can't try to sell them on that now he says now you've got to demonstrate the power of the Resurrection you're just one more voice you open your mouth to people today and start talking about the lord they're just going to try to decide whether you're CNN or Fox you got to have something more than that you've got to fight for something more than that but you've got one thing we know that God is trying to get his church back to being the Sons and Daughters of God having that seal in their hand that the works that I do they'll do also now you've got to cook if I could decide that's what I want to say to you this morning if you've got to realize that God's got to navigate you through this dark and perilous Lady of sea and age blind miserable poor wretched naked and don't know it but he said those that hear my voice I will grant for them to come in and eat the evening meal with you so God is not so desperately interested in fixing all the problems that surround you you know you can pray all day Lord just put me the amongst people that just believe the way I believe thank you well as our brother testified Wednesday we can go create a community throw our cell phones away throw our electricity away throw our running water away right go back to horse and batteries just shut out the whole world live in our own thing but that's not what the scripture says it says we are in the world but we're not of the world we we light our candles we're a Shining Light to what we believe what we stand for what's right what's truth that's what we're here for we're here to find out can spread the good news that of course anybody else that's hungering and thirsting after righteousness so God deals with us and he deals with us through these two great words that I'm going to use and one is conviction he convicts the spirit convicts us of sin of unbelief he said when I send you the comforter when he comes he'll reprove the world because of sin or unbelief God convicts you [Applause] there's nothing wrong with coming under conviction that's how he deals with the inward man when you start to go astray you feel that conviction the conviction of the Holy Spirit the reprove on the Immigrant you might think everybody else in the world sees it I've sat in church under the preaching of the word of God and thought every eye in that place was on me they all know he's talking about me nobody knew nothing but my inward man Ward man knew I wasn't reading my Bible my man knew I wasn't praying and making intercession father he's just like you interested in the Lost interested in The Afflicted interested that ought to bring conviction to us it ought to it ought to speak to us he's speaking to the inner man he's convicting us of our unbelief you're not living right you might be perfect and then he'll convict you you're not doing anything show me your faith without your works I'll show you my faith by my works one of the ways he deals with us is through conviction conviction is not condemnation conviction is what allows you to know you need help God doesn't convict you to condemn you he convicts you to let you know he's there to make a difference you can sit in church and everything's fine tell the word of God crosses the problem you have and then you feel convicted it might feel like condemnation but condemnation is a final judgment if you reject the conviction you get condemnation but he deals with you by convicting Your Heart by speaking to Your Heart by addressing you addressing your thought addressing your action he's bringing you conviction he keeps he's trying to stir up that inward man and get a message to the inward man that's what the spirit does it convicts us of unbelief it convicts us of sin so you're living your life if you understand trying to bring it down home you're dealing in your daily life you're going to come up against this situation you're going to come up against that situation you're going to come up against this person you've got to be aware that God is going to convict you I don't want that to be something that goes away I wanted to be something I'm more aware of I've taken all kinds of classes on on protection and and and you know how to keep safe and all those things and the thing they begin to teach us know your surroundings know your situation you know don't walk close to an alley entrance don't stay out away where you can be seen stay out a way where you can't be reached all these things that they teach you it's all about an awareness now can you imagine going through this life and not being aware of how that God is trying to speak to you he deals with you through conviction thank God how would I know I don't want to be a blind leader or blind I want the tutor to be there I want the spirit of God to be there I want him to deal with my heart I want him to speak to me so Lord how how am I gonna I feel like doing this certain thing why lean that way now how am I going to hear from God people say well I want to hear an audible Voice or I want he convicts your heart he brings you under conviction we should be so aware of that so conscious of that but if you just keep overriding that conviction and Order of writing that conviction and it gives dollar to you and dollar to you and you know you might turn on a song the first timing and you feel that conviction that song ain't right but you like that beat you like that beat you just like that beat I love that beat you want more don't you no you gotta you gotta be a cute right there he's speaking to me he's leading me he's talking me don't go there don't do that don't go that fast don't think that way he's there every time the spirit of God is there to convict the believer of sin he does it he's trying to get this church in a place where they can manifest the word and manifest him in the flesh and if they can't hear the conviction of his Spirit the stop signs the the slowdowns the the don't do that don't think that don't go there Satan don't care if you hear the gospel if it don't convict you how do you think it was when he talked about that bobbed hair and makeup and all that stuff and all the women in there you think any of them felt conviction I felt conviction just hearing that tape realizing that I'm a little short here praise God conviction means that he's got something there to help he's not convicting it condemned he's convicting to alter your ways correct it does not mean condemnation it means to alter the direction that you're going in it's a change of course conviction is there to change your course you're going down a certain way everything's fine boom conviction comes up something stirs up on your inside you get that question that's raised in your heart that little doubt that rises out where there's a doubt you do what you leave it out you stop you pray about it you filter it through the word don't be afraid of conviction I pray for it father convict my heart if there's anything in my life that's not like you what convict me of it deal with me show me can you imagine a young girl meeting a guy you know he's a sweet talker you know you know all the girls think she's just the guy he's so handsome and he's the quarterback and everything like that he just comes all soft-spoken and you think oh he picked me you know your ego's just blooming all over the place and he ain't got nothing but a pitchfork and a couple forked horns and just a sweet talker he don't have one good intention about you your reputation or nothing you'll feel a conviction but you override that conviction and you get to the place that that conviction doesn't deal with you anymore then God might have to go to a more drastic measure we don't want to go there we're talking about being led into Perfection this morning one of the ways that God deals with his church and speak to you is through conviction be aware of conviction be aware of that stop be aware of that voice be aware of that feeling that that that I don't know I don't have words to express it but in my life I can just feel that little shaking and little trembling on the inside something ain't right here this ain't right I might not know what it is he don't have to explain but if he convicts you stop because God's trying to lead you somewhere doesn't have to be good or evil there's a lot of good things that are lawful but they're just not expedient they're not good to transform you into what he wants you to be you might have a great plan a great work that you want to do for God at something just ain't right about it your heart's under conviction you really don't feel like going that way and he stops you our messenger was on his way to Israel the spirit convicted him didn't he condemn them it stopped them don't call it's not the right time your ministry will misrepresent to them I don't know all the reasons you understand it it doesn't hurt to stop conviction now God's dealing with that not on this outside man not in this fleshly man he's dealing with the Inner Man that inner heart don't keep walking over that conviction no wonder he said you've got to fight your way into trouble it's hard to go to hell you have to drop every voice every conviction everything keep dropping it down pushing it down pushing it down and I hope that even in listening to that tape you you take an examination of yourself and you come under conviction hey I'm not really pressing the mark I'm living that when I get to the Judgment I hope that he just decides I can come in uh-huh that's like I just don't even know if I can even come up with an example of how scary that is make full proof and I wanted to finish this morning if we could uh turn to first John and the second chapter of verse dime now this has many different terminologies that we use but I'd like just to read the rest of the chapter starting in the 18th verse let's just start with the 15th verse and we'll read this verse and go as we begin to close this morning love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but of the world if that brings you under conviction that's good that's God saying I have something that I can exchange that for I can give you For the Love of the world I can give you the love of God for the unless of the eyes I can give you ice have conviction is good conviction is God's way of saying to you I have something different for you stop don't go there I've got something different God never criticizes without a solution God never does anything that he hasn't done himself that's a quote so when you got convicted conviction isn't no that's bad conviction is God's way and don't take that I've got something for you I've got word for you I've got spirit for you I've got understanding for you I've got eyes have for you I've got gold Trident and fire for you I've got white reniment for you conviction is God's way of letting you know that he has something else that's what I hope we concentrate on it's it's what's God's Got What the tutor has what he's trying certain choices in our life is going to produce certain results and God wants to keep you from burying the fruits of decisions that don't allow you to become more like him you let an infection go untreated and a little infection that could be treated with a little bit of antibiotics can turn into amputation no amputation will save you and he will amputate let me give the spiritual thing he will prune he'll remove the dead branches he'll prune you you best treat it you know a lot of things sicknesses go into remission to the treatment stops them for a while but they never Purge it out and that's why he said in order to be born again you've got to die first you can't be born again until you die conviction is what God uses to bring you to death to where you say I want that out I I don't want this to be bothering me more I want to put an end to it I'm ready to die out now so it can be removed so many Christians has put things in remission and then they try to go on in life and all of a sudden here it comes back and here they're dealing with it again when they thought things were going good let conviction have its full effect conviction is wonderful for all that he said and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doth the will of God abideth forever what great wisdom that little thing that he's stopping you from that will pass away all the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye all those things will pass away the pride of life but those that do the will of the father abideth forever little children it is the last time and as ye have heard the Antichrist shall come and even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time somebody believes that they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they wouldn't no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they are not all of us but ye have an unction from the Holy One and ye know all things that's the second way that God deals and leads his church is with unction you know what the word unction means it comes from meaning anointing being smeared with oil he deals with you by anointing you I'm closing just hold on for a second that little voice in the inward man that little unction that little call that little draw that little thing that you just feel led to do that inward voice that inner man that Holy unction he says by that unction ye know all things think of it we're talking about how does God lead us how does he speak to us I'm living in this last hour I'm living this perilous time I'm living in this time where they've rejected the lord they're totally no light we're in the lady you'll see an age there's total darkness how is God going to get through to me he can't use any of these other channels he's going to talk to the inward man he's going to talk you through conviction and through unction can you identify the two in your life can you identify when God's giving you that little push that little tug that little call that little awareness that little voice that's still Small Voice another term for an unction that deep calling to the Deep another term for her unction that little feeling LED I just feel led I feel led to seeing this song I feel led to do that I feel led to be testified I have that Uncle I have this compelling Fort inside of me that's moving me in a certain direction that's the spirit the oil anointing you unctioning you smearing you with this oil that's where the word unction comes from that's how he deals with you can you imagine if we get to the place that we're not affected by that anymore we're not affected by conviction we're not affected we go into what intellectual religion it won't work and God will not allow it to work he won't allow it now he's if he's going to deal with us not only as individuals but as a church as a body we've all got to come into tune I just want to finish reading I know it's tired but at least it's air-conditioned in here he says you have a have an unction from the Holy One and you know all things I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ he is Antichrist that denieth the father and the son whosoever denieth the son the same hath deny hath not the father but he that acknowledged the son hath the father can I say that that's the word you can't deny the promised word of God for this hour and say you have the father this is not a man-made Ministry [Music] it has not something that a man came along and had a meeting with God and felt inspired and and said I I'm going to believe I'm going to pray for the sick and be for a Prophet this was an anointed vessel that was brought to this Earth for the sole purpose of delivering to this church this morning that we are being called to be at Sons and Daughters of God and that's his purpose is to have sons and daughters like he is herein is the love of God made perfect that as he is so are we in this world do you understand that this morning he is trying to turn you transform you through the whole process of your life you didn't get the Holy Spirit when you did you just began to bring you to the full maturity of a statue of a perfect man where the love of God is shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit we're in a perfection the Tudor's here and he's telling you I I can't deal with you through that world anymore there's no Avenue left to the world I'll send you the comforter and he'll reprove you of sin and lead you into all truth and righteousness who now he can only deal with one thing he's only got one thing left that's preaching of the word but if it doesn't convict you and it doesn't give you unction then what good is it I could go out here and preach to the tree stumps same word same gospel but God's going to take the words that are preached and he's going to transform transfer them to the inner manned through conviction or unction that's how he's going to deal with it you've got to become completely aware that God is trying to speak to you every day though the outer man perish praise God we are strengthened in the Inner Man though the world around us is perishing the inner man is still alive though the conditions are getting terrible they want to take Christ out of Christmas they want to take the Bibles down they want to remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse they will they want to take crosses down don't matter they can't stop him from speaking to the Inner Man amen they can't stop him from convicting you and reproving you of unbelief they can't stop the anointed one anointing your spirit and giving you the unction and the leadership to do the right thing boy if it's ever now that you need to connect with the tutor and cut off these other voices let us just finish reading I I just don't feel I have the ability this morning but I guess I'm just trusting that the tutor and the function and the conviction will do the work for me he said let that therefore abide in you what what's he talking about that Holy unction that was giving you to the Holy One let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye shall continue in the Sun and in the father and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you why is he writing these things because there's a seducing Spirit the Antichrist spirit is at work there there were actually you I mean I'm going to lose it I'm sure but they're actually substituting thinking with artificial intelligence the world is worried that artificial intelligence is going to take over the world this is not the Twilight Zone this is worse than the Twilight Zone this is not the outer limits this is worse than the outer limits it's insane Clay's saying we better get a hold of this artificial intelligence else there will be no turning back not even human thinking maybe you're not scared of it well I ain't as scared of it because guess what there's another intelligence the one that causes the sap to go into the tree the ones that cause the one that's going to speak to me it's going to convict me it's going to give me holy unction it's going to deal with me amen he says it and this is the promise that he hath promised up even for life these things I have written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is true and is no lie and even as it hath taught you shall ye abide in him you have an unction you have an anointing that was given you what a beautiful thing I'm writing you concerning the deception that's out there the liar that's out there anything that doesn't confess Jesus Christ is not of God I'm warning you of all the voices of all the spirits of all the seduction of those that have come to seduce you and take you away from the truth I'm warning you about the world and the condition of the world and the Darkness that's a uh upon the Earth I'm here telling you but you've got something you've got something treasure it revive it listen to it get in tune with it but the anointing which he have received of him abideth in you that unction that voice on the inner man that ye need not any man teach you but the same anointing teacheth you all things and is truth and is no lie even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if ye know that he is righteous ye know that everyone that death righteousness is born of him that we won't be ashamed at his appearing Church if there's ever a time we need to get serious and sincere if it's ever a time we need to renew our communication with him if there's ever a time that we need to know that he's speaking to our hearts it's now if you would say this morning brother McGarry I don't think God talks to me ask him to open up a line of communications with your spirit he's got a free plan it doesn't have minutes it's eternal he'll give you his spirit if you're willing to trade the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life for eternal life if you're willing to lay down if the spirit of God's bringing you conviction if you're not sure of the end result of the path that you are on it behooves you to sit back and ask yourself where is this taking me where is it taking me where is this he said all this Elvis all these people say he says it's just to get you young girls out on the floor doing that Boogie Woogie people like the Boogie Woogie they'll go to a wedding the Boogie Woogie don't get me on that one I could show you videos of what we call believers and rock and roll and you can't tell the difference between the dance moves he just got his front leg out there and that leg just going like that you know and everything and everybody's around and you go to look at a picture of Elvis Presley nothing serious anymore we just think we can get away with anything we can't he's trying to anoint us give us function convict us let's set the lines of communication up Let the spirit of God lead you into all truth and all righteousness let him be a lamp unto your path get back serious with God and and measure up and line everything up let's get the filter back in your life I'm preaching to myself this morning God help me there's too much at stake and how can I help others until I get the beam out of my own eye let this Spirit convict me oh God let your spirit speak to my inner man there's no other place left Lord for me that I need no man teach you but the spirit Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you the church is built on Revelation the church is built on conviction and unction and when Jesus wrote In The Sand when they were going to storm that woman caught and prostitute the scripture says and they were convicted and left one by one praise God for conviction praise God for unction praise God that we have an inner man and we don't aren't led by the outer man praise God that he's mindful of us and he wants to bring us in to what that he was that we can hear him and have life and have life more abundant God bless you this morning brother Billy [Applause] let's understand this morning key of f amen because healing
