Description:
Fruits of Our Election
June 21, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 
Br. Matthew McGeary

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that if we call upon the name of the Lord we shall be saved oh God I have a need tonight my family has a need tonight let's just go before him heavenly father in an atmosphere like this we know that all things are possible not because of what man has done but it's because of what you have done because you shed your blood upon Calvary Lord and you purchased us tonight fight that we could be free from sin we can be free from guilt we can be free from the world that we can stand here a Victorious church because of what you did Lord when you spread forth your arms there on Calvary you said it is finished Lord may we have a confidence tonight to move past the humanity to move past the veil to see you standing in all of your glory in the midst of your bride tonight that we might give you glory we might give you honor we might give you praise Lord because you're worthy of it all you're worthy of all of our adoration Lord every breath every minute that we live Lord you're worthy of it so may we just give you our life right now may we just lay down our thinking and our ideas Lord the things that have become familiar the things that have been common even the four walls and those who might sit next to us Lord but may we realize that right now it's where the Great I Am is present amongst us and if we can just release ourselves into your presence Lord and break into the supernatural realm father we can behold Grace things tonight so we Just Surrender ourselves to you Lord that you would have your preeminence in this service your preeminence in each individual Lord because that's what you've come to do we just surrender to you and pray these things in your most wonderful and gracious name the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise His wonderful name if you have your Bibles let's just turn into second Peter chapter one man I don't know if a prayer request was turned in for brother Billy a little Jeremy fractured or broke his arm so they were at the hospital so just remember Little Jeremy he's in a lot of pain and I wasn't able to make the service they had to take him to the hospital so so just remember the family uh brother Billy and the family Little Jeremy just pray that the Lord would take away that pain matter of fact one we just why don't we just go before the Lord Heavenly Father lord it's just on my heart just to intercede for little Jeremy Lord and the family you know the pain you know the hurt Lord but father even a doctor can set a bone but it takes you to heal Lord you're the great physician Lord I pray that you just move upon the scene right now just mend that little arm Lord restore it back take away the pain that you would receive the glory and the honor in all things we pray we commit them to you in Jesus Christ name we ask it amen we're reading out of uh II Peter verse chapter 1 verse four through eight would read like this whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature I only know one divine nature all right there's only one divine nature and you have been given a word and you have been given a promise that you might be a partaker of that divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving diligence notice giving diligence is something that we got to pay attention to we got to work for we got to strive add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience into patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you for if these things be in you and abound well it's not good enough to just say they're there well it's there it's there but they need to abound we saw or we see in the scripture the divine nature Jesus Christ he he could have just said well I am what I am but he manifested what he was those attributes abounded for if you do these things in you and abound they make you that you shall never be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ may the Lord just bless the reading of his word you may be seated we'll also be reading a few other places uh if you'll turn with me to John chapter 12 verse 24. but I like that you notice uh and the scripture we just read it says if you do these things right if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of Jesus Christ well you you weren't called to be Barren and you weren't called to be unfruitful and so as we just move on over into John 12 24 just some familiar readings he says verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit you turn on over into John chapter 15 verse 5. John chapter 15 verse 5. I am the Vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me in my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so look at the formula if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples well if we're going to Bear much fruit then we have to abide in him and his word has to abide in us and then we can ask what we will then we will bring much fruit then will the father be glorified and I just want to speak to you a little bit tonight on fruits of your election fruits of your election if we'll also turn over into Romans 4 16 and just uh speaking a little bit on Abraham here Paul would write in Romans chapter 4 verse 16. I hope reading our Bibles is okay if we've gotten away from our Bible we've gotten away from God and I would I would uh recommend you do this when you listen to the message of the hour go back and search out what the prophet says to the scriptures you will find out it's Bible Bible Bible Bible Bible Bible and we allow things to be so common and you let it become a phrase and and and and forget that there is a living Oracle of God speaking the word making it flesh making it tangible if you start to trace those things back you'll find out in one paragraph there might be four or five and you get in and you see what Paul was saying and imagine you find that it's Christ and it starts tying together because that's what was given to the church to make this Bible live but you got to put it together if you if you don't if the if you don't allow the messenger of the age to ground you into the scripture then then you're one-footed because that's what the very message of the hour was founded was it was on the Bible and you can't have the New Testament without the Old Testament it's two Wings it gots to fly together and this message has to have the the Bible it it's all the word of God it all is fitly and joined together so just speaking on the fruits of your election we look into Romans chapter 4 and verse 16 it would read like this therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the sea not to that only witches of the law but to that also which as of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were so we know that God by his grace and according to election has given us a promise and he has given us the holy spirit that we might be able to make this word become a reality in our daily lives God didn't give Abraham a promise and just say that you know hey you're going to be the father of many nations and it just became a buzzword when he where he went around and says hey I'm a father of many nations I'm a father of many nations and my seed is going to be uh numbered like the the Sands and the stars and it was just something uh that was out there that was some uh a phrase and he didn't have no understanding or no perception of really what was being promised unto him but Abraham knew exactly what had been promised to him he said you're going to be the father of the many nations you're you're going to have a son you're going to bring forth a son you're going to bring forth a child and Abraham was believing that promised word and he would not let off of that he staggered not at the promise of God because God had given him a word God had to give him a promise and there was something that Abraham was going to produce because he was elected he was chosen in Genesis chapter 12 out of everybody on the whole face of the world and all the planet God could have chose anybody but he chose Abraham and he came there to Abraham and he said Abraham I want you to separate yourself because I've elected you and I've chosen you and there's something that I want to accomplish in your life I'm going to give you a promise well you we see ourselves right there in the pattern you know I I was thinking of this how it struck me you know then they many times will have a a Raffles or or something like that you know everybody buys a raffle ticket and you put your name in there and and you know there's these great odds it could be who knows you know uh uh a hundred thousand people raffle or or you know 500 or whatever but all of a sudden you know uh uh if your name's been called you've been selected you've been chosen I remember uh uh back in the day when when I I used to do do sales for a fitness club and believe it or not I I used to have a jobs outside of what I do now my my kids I tell me yeah you know I had like 20 jobs before I started doing tree work like what so one of them was I was I was uh selling uh health care and it was kind of funny we always needed leads and people to call and they would have these boxes deposited all over the Metroplex and you could sign up for a two-week free uh a membership so we could get you in there and try to sell you welcome to find out what the what a lot of the salesmen would do they would just open up the phone book and say you've been selected you know those little boxes you see there and your name was turned in like man I didn't turn in my name you didn't turn on my I didn't know anything about it well you know what you didn't know anything about it but you've been elected and you've been chosen like what are you talking about there was a what yeah I'm going to have a bride in the end time and I have elected and I have chosen you and I have given you a promise that you would bring forth much fruit see you're the elected you're the ordained you're the chosen vessel that I've made a promise to you've been elected and you've been chosen for it so when we look into the Bible and we start to read there in Ephesians chapter 1 and and verse 4 it says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be blameless before him in love oh we're going to be the blameless spotless bride and that that that and then you predestinated unto adoption these things become common to us like something that's just uh uh a phrase you know something that we're not earnestly contending for uh but but I as we move forward there there has been something that has come on display in the evening time to show the Bride of what these promises actually mean when they take on flesh it's not something that's left out there on the ether somewhere and you're just wondering well I guess I'll be what God made me someday no we have a pattern in the word we have scripture and we have end-time manifestations to show the bride exactly what she's going to be and there ought to be a heart crying the believer tonight that you're not going to stop short I'm going to make my calling an election sure that I produce everything that God has promised me for to produce because I see it in the word and I'm not going to stop short it's my inheritance there ought to be something in you that's hungering and thirsting for righteousness that's not going to stop short you're not going to back up you're not going to let the things of Lady you'll see and the things rob you of your time and your daily concentrated life living in the presence of the Shekinah Glory we got to move past the things of the world we gotta move past the flesh we got to get into that secret place we gotta break through the veil we gotta break through the barriers why because we've seen one live amongst us who broke through the denominational veils he broke through the barriers of Lady osia he broke through into the presence of God soaring in Heavenly places where all things are possible and that's your inheritance you've been elected you've been chosen to bring forth the fruit of the age Oh Glory to God oh let God do with your heart you move over into Ephesians uh chapter 2 I believe verse 10 we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works for ordained that we should walk in them the question is are you walking in them come on this is adoption hour this is the hour of the manifestation of the sons of God we know what it ought to look like we know what an overcomer looks like let's not play ignorant around here we've seen a sheath wave I say we've seen it well I must confess I didn't see it with my natural eyes I wasn't here uh that many years ago we see it in the word we saw it in the prophets a portion of the word we saw it in Jesus Christ the fullness of the word and by Divine promise at the revealing of the son of man we've seen the fullness of the word back in flesh again in our generation displaying what the word is come on that was so you could know what you're being called to be yeah they were first called Christians at Antioch because the life that was in Christ Hallelujah the sheath wave was raised up there if I be lifted up I will draw amen unto me and there The Mercy Seat was lifted up there on Calvary oh and the veil was written there was the mercy see hanging in plain view the sheath wave and it was way back to them on the day of Pentecost in the life that was in the sheath way was now back on the believer performing the same signs the same wonders the prophet of God says I long to see the days of ananias and Sapphire which sin would be called out at the back door have we stopped shark have we forgot what we've been called to have we been wooed bye lady Lucia have we been wooed by education have we been wooed by learning have we been trying to understand the message have we been trying to do two plus two equals four and we've missed the very person of the word let God speak to your heart right now the greatest battle ever thought is in your mind and it's easy for us to learn to to lean towards learning and understanding and trying to be able to to hold our own amongst the brethren come on come on you want to be able to sit down and when somebody starts to ask you questions you want to feel that you don't feel like a duck out of water I'd rather you feel like a duck out of water and say I don't know but I Lord reveal it to me but we settle for for for a mental understanding of the greatest thing that's ever struck Humanity in this generation oh Shake Yourself Church young people Shake Yourself we've allowed ourselves to sink into a denomination into a religion and we allow ourselves to accept terminologies for the very Life of Christ living out in the individual I know what I'm talking about we get complacent we get satisfied oh foolish Galatians having begun in the spirit are you now perfected with all of your learning are you now perfected with your works are you so easily wooed away from that hunger and thirst for God to continue to reveal himself to you that you've gotten a little bit of learning and now you've gotten puffed up with your position and your ability to hold down the front row at church and be able to spit a few lyrics to make some people realize you believe the message or are you in a daily communion in a consecrated life in the Shekinah Glory where you've broke through the veil and it's dropped down behind you and you're hit away oh man I am the Vine here are the branches where is the fruit boring it's not in the Vine it's in the branch second Peter would say wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and your elections sure because if you do these things you shall never fail what kind of results are you getting what kind of fruit are you bearing in your life you want to give diligence to that we're called to be fruitful we're called to be christ-like we're called to go on to perfection in John 15 8 we'll just have a lot of scriptures and quote to move through I believe that's what we had read in our text it says wherefore the rather and give tillages to make well it says in 15 8 hearing is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples well look we know the fruit of the spirit is it's love and joy and peace and long-suffering gentleness goodness kindness Faith meekness tempers those things we want to see those fruits abounding in our life Jesus would give a parable it might be Matthew 5 I'm not sure but uh no it'll be a little later than that but Jesus gives the parable he says you know it's like this the the the vineyard uh the master of the vineyard he came out and said hey every year I come to this fruit tree and it's not burying any fruit he said why why in cumberth the pew why take up the place on the church pew if it's just fill in a dead spot why are we going to encumber the ground why why are we gonna I encumber if this flesh if it ain't gonna produce any fruit let's just get rid of the thing but what if the husbandman of the vineyard say no let's don't get rid of it now but let me dig it let me dung it let me give it some attention let me make the calling an election sure let me deal with it as a son let me go have a talk with them Lord let's not get rid of them but but let the Holy Spirit come by his way uh let us start to speak to his heart let me start to deal with him let me start to point out his air and where he's missed the mark and how he's going down the wrong path let me start to deal with them Lord let me dig it let me dunk it let me create an atmosphere around the seed that it can break and bring forth the fruit that you desire you gotta be that one and before you can be that one for others you gotta be that for yourself I ain't saying that you got to do it but you gotta look to him and let him do it in you the prophet of God say the problem is is we're too strong we're too Headstrong I think one of the things we lacked the most is meekness and humility his presence produces meekness and humility that Prophet lived in it how could he be lifted up when he was in a constant communion with the great creator how could he ever be lifted up within that presence oh we saw what that presence did it was a discerner of the thought intent of the heart nothing was hid think of how one's felt around them this is whether biscal would testify of driving in the car there and the angel of the Lord come in the prophet of God would say he come to me over a thousand times but every time I'd like to die I ain't saying every one of us are called to live in a presence like that but we're all called to live in his presence we're all called to receive all his blessings and I know when you get alone into his presence oh he's a dissolver of doubts he's a sober of problems he knows how to bind the Brokenhearted he knows how to comfort those that are comfortless he knows how to deliver those that are in captivity if you could just come into His presence see it's in his presence where things change it's in his presence where there's life take that manna from out behind the veil and it was death it was dead substance Aaron Drive take it out from behind the veil and it was just a stick but back in there Hallelujah in that presence it was life it was the sustaining of life it brought forth oh that's what's come to the believer today the Shekinah Glory has come that you could live in there this isn't some promised word way out there that that can never be obtainable but this is this is we're talking about the fruits of your election something that you've been chosen to be a part of we could take time on the talents the parable about the talents how each one was given a talent and we could spend some time there on the talents and how one would just bury it well I didn't want to lose it I didn't I was afraid I I knew you gave me one talent I didn't want to lose it what are you doing with the gift of God what are you doing with the message of the hour God's given you a vaccine he's giving you the Cure all this death and darkness and everything you see on the Rampage he has entrusted you with the very token the very vaccine for the condition what are you doing with it what are what are we doing with the message you you got to store it on your cell phone what you got it in tapes and books you got it in the Bible Elena what are you doing with it acting like the world going to the same places as the world listening to the same Christian rock as the world come on I'm talking about what is the fruits of your inaction what you have been called to be now we got some places to go so by God's grace we'll move there prophet of God would say and you must be born again when you're born again God vindicates you well chew on that a little while when you're born again God vindicates you Hallelujah well I just want to get excited on that right there I just love this message two words three words one little sentence whoa when you're born again God vindicates you so if you've been born again tell that Old Devil watch out God's going to vindicate me oh he's going to vindicate you well not really me but what he's done in me you know the old song you can't cross the bloodline huh you say I'm the purchased possession I'm the Royal seed I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and I have been born again and he is going to vindicate me not really me but the word because I am his word well we'll get there in a little while if you really find out who you are what you've been chosen for what the fruits of your election really is when you're born again God vindicates you well we might be a while tonight but I I leave tomorrow and I fly out and I'm going to be gone for a little bit now y'all pray for me I might not see y'all for a little bit but maybe we can just have a little good time tonight I have uh we'll fly out tomorrow I ask for your prayers but we fly out tomorrow it'll be an overnight flight we'll get in on uh um Friday and then drive over to Romania and then we have we'll be preaching Saturday night Sunday morning Sunday night Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and fly back on Monday so we'll covet your prayers but if if there was any place I'd rather be it'd be right here with my brothers and sisters at home so when you're born again God vindicates you that's how God vindicates all of his nature what by there fruit that's the way he vindicates his ministry that's right all of his servants are Vindicated the same way he vindicates nature how do you know it's a peach tree because it brings peaches how do you know it's an apple tree it's bearing apples how do you know it's a Christian signs bear from it Christian Life comes out of it how do you know he's a teacher the word comes from him how do you know he's a prophet the word comes through him Bears record Vindication it proves itself how does it become that when it dies and becomes one that's right when we die and become a new creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling now now don't let that move on by when we die and become a new creature in Christ Jesus it gets us with our calling we stay with our calling the cycle of Revival and death is over I'm sorry but when you're born again and the Holy Spirit gets you with your calling and you stay with your calling the cycle of Revival and death is over sure we're gonna have temptations we're gonna go through trials we're going to go through hardships but the cycle of Revival and death is over because you have been born again and it brings you into your calling and you stay with your calling why because you have now entered into his rest and when we enter into his rest then we cease from our own works right you've entered into the secret place sure we want to have a pattern of good works and that's good but we want to be led by the spirit the prophet goes on to say the fruits of the spirit follow us when we are his servants when we are born again the fruits of Christ life follow us that's right how do you know it's a peach tree it gots peaches how do you know he's a Christian he acts like Christ he walks like Christ he talks like Christ he lives like Christ above sin Victorious now why allow the devil to rob you from your inheritance because right now you're already connecting dots of things in your life sure Satan wants to use that as condemnation but those very things that are flashing before you are flashing before you because it's something you want to have the victory over it's something you want to live above and if that's something that you desire and it's in the word then don't justify a condition of a repeated cycle you say Lord I that this is what I've been elected for and I have been called to be christ-like to walk like Christ to talk like Christ to live like Christ to live above sin to be victorious what does he do say see see what I've done no Christ didn't do that he gave all praise to the father that's right that's how you know it by their fruits you shall know them so it's what Christ is doing in you and through you what he's doing in your life and not all only what he's doing in your life but what he's doing in your life through you for others see there's where we want to really get to the place to where we're so born again and the the cycle of Revival and death is over that now you've become a prisoner of Christ and now you're the vehicle that God drives down to the crisis come on I have needs to go by Samaria God is calling a bride that you would be the very body you are the body you are the body of Christ The Headstone right so you're going to be the vehicle you're going to be the body that God wants to use to bring forth his word in this age but that takes a surrendered life and I think that's where a lot of us myself included we find ourselves coming up short is we're not surrendering we're not Redeeming the time there's such a vastness of this word that God is wanting to pour into you and we're only scratching the very surface look at the prophet's life the prophet would say it it wasn't me it was what I surrendered myself to he said oh no it wasn't the seventh angel it was the mighty Angel it was the son of man he said I'm just a mute hey I like the microphone I I'm just one that he spoke through see it was something that he surrendered to him he had a part to play you have a part to play and it has to be something that you surrender yourself to look You Gotta Lose Your Mind you gotta lose your thinking and that's what has come to us as the very mind of God that that we could forget about our thoughts and our ideas and we we could come into contact and come into a union with this word that it would be the very governing factor of our life that we would be so submitted and so surrendered and so in the Channel with him that his very mind would be living through us have we heard it so much that we're just we we we're not even making our calling and elections we're not even hungering for these things because oh brother Matthew it's been 60 years and and preachers have been saying the same thing over and over and over and I listen to the tapes over and over and well Faith come by hearing we need to hear it over and over and over and over because faith comes by hearing the word and I I this bride Hallelujah she's not going to want that one word slip Glory it was by one word that Eve caused the fall of all man but this bride by every word spoken out of the mouth of God we will not let one word slip because you're ordained for it you are predestinated for it it's the very fruits of your election to bring forth the word of the age well brother Matthew I hear our position I hear adoption I hear manifestation I hear predestination election third pool I need something I can use brother Matthew all of these buzzwords ain't doing me any good I need something yeah yeah that's true you need something kind of like Little Junior you know the the storms are flashing and the Lightning's going he come out of bed and say Mom I'm scared it's the lightning Junior go back upstairs go get in bed and you know being a good little boy he went back got in bed and there comes the lightning and thunder and it's it's flashing and he said Mama Mama and being a good old mom she comes up there what is it Junior I'm scared well Junior what are you scared about well it's the Thunder and it's the darkness well you know Jesus loves you and he protects you say yeah Mama I know that but I want a god with skin on it I want a god with skin on where you know that's what you've been called to be Hallelujah you've been called to be god with skin on it but the purpose of the sheath wave in our generation was god with skin on it to show you that if that was the first one to maturity a god with skin on it they call you Gods who the word of the Lord comes to well I got news for you the word of the Lord has come to the bride ye are Gods because the word of the Lord has come to you you are the very god with skin on it it's what you've been called to when you come to him some of us just need to get desperate we just need to get desperate are we living come on are we living like the rapture is on let's just take inventory matter of fact why don't we all open up our cell phones and look at the apps on our phone let's look at our internet history and see if the fruits of your life testify well come on Church what are we doing I know I get on my hobby horses but but we need to are we living like he's coming today I think that's the paradox if you don't realize he's he's already started he's already here his coming has already ascended are we living like we're in the Rapture age are we living like we're in the bright age look we're talking about fruits of your election so so we want to do all these big things but what about the little foxes that spoil the vine we're wanting to be this Great Mighty Victorious Church well ask yourself what would Jesus do and move on Down the Line to people who manifested the word for the age and ask yourselves would they do that would the prophet be found around these things would the prophet be found doing that better yet where I get totally smitten to the core is we say that Jesus is in US we see that Jesus is with us but I wonder if he was sitting in the chair next to you if we would do half the things that we do now we're just dealing with unbelief I'm sorry well we just got a hammer at home because we got a good place to go but we we might as well get it all let's just get all the sin out oh we got a Rapture to get to we got a body change to get to we got Brothers to save we got sisters to say we got prodigal sons we got people who need healing in their body let's get this show on their own I'm tired of playing Church up one month and down the next this revival today come on what's the matter with us has the mighty Angel come down as the Capstone descendants and Grace Grace are you in a union with him then live like it act like it talk like it walk like it believe like it be that Victorious church that God has called you to be when you come to him don't come as a floater I'll go up and try it and see if it works you'll never get nowhere but when you come with this kind of determination that you have sold out locks talking Barrel when you're tired of the world and sin and unbelief and frustrations and doubts and come to the Living God with an anchor surely tightened in the Rock of Ages the holy spirit is here to pull you into the presence of the Living God that will give you that faith that overcome anything there is in the world sickness disease and even death itself hey do I need to read it again have you been there have you gotten that when you're sold out Lock Stock and Barrel you're tired of the world is somebody here tired are you tired of the world are you tired of the sin are you tired of the unbelief the frustrations and the doubt don't let Pride hold you there just keep holding on don't let nobody know I'm just going to keep holding on you know in your heart where you're at the words of discerner of the thought intent of the heart and you know that achy feeling in your soul and you know you're not resting and you know you're just trying to hold on and you know what's around the corner and you're dreading the day you come back to that besetting sin and you hope you don't fall why live like that but you got to get sick of that thing you're gonna get tired of that thing tell that older I hate you devil I'm tired of you I'm sick of living this way I don't want to be this way anymore God's calling you he's asking you lay it down there's an anchor to the Rock of Ages the Holy Spirit here to pull you into the presence of a living God that'll give you a faith that'll overcome anything now this is what I'm asking look at your life in the fruit of your life are you living an overcomer life come on you know that this isn't uh this isn't a condemnation it's like you know if hey man you you've been elected and been chosen you won the Lamborghini and you're out there driving a pinto hey you yeah you in the pinto did you know you can be driving that thing over there that you were you were elected you were chosen like all you just if you just just get out don't worry we'll repo that just get out don't worry about your old car the registration all that just just turn it off come on come on you don't have to it's we got a new car for you the engines knocking the oil's leaking be setting Sands all over can't get the victory websites and and lust and all these things holding it just turn the car off just say car devil I'm done with you I'm just gonna get out of this thing I'm tired of driving this old clunker around I'm ready to be a new creature in Jesus Christ you've been elected you've been chosen go ahead and turn the key off get out of there why don't you just slam that door shut and say I ain't coming back I'm stepping into a new dive I'm stepping into a new car I'm stepping into being an overcomer I'm stepping into what I've been called for well somebody come on somebody why don't you just do it go ahead and get out of that old car it ain't taking you nowhere but the hell but Christ has come to apprehend you and bring you into his presence it's your decision it's your decision do you want it I got all my radio stations already programmed I got you know the vanilla Smith the new car smell in this are you so blind God has a storehouse a new life Joy beyond measure joy unspeakable and full of Glory we just need to surrender to the message just need to surrender to it I think some of us you know this thought struck my heart some of us don't realize there's a bounty out on you you ever you know they have some shows out there big dog the Bounty Hunter and if you skip bail what's gonna happen the big dog is Gonna Come chasing you they call them bounty hunters so for view that don't know this if you get in trouble with the law there's a price that you got to pay to get out of jail and it'll be a big big fee a hundred thousand dollars well now there's places called a bails bondsman they will kind of vet you and say hey you know I'll put up the money for you it'll cost you ten percent you give me ten thousand dollars I'll give the court the rest of the money and it it's it's a it's a bail so as long as you come back to court you get all the money back but if you skip your court date that bail bondsman is out ninety thousand dollars and there's one way that he can get his money back if he can get you back in that court or get you arrested so what does he do he he hires an outside agent called a bounty hunter and it says look this guy skipped bail and he's on the run and I want you to go get him and I want you to bring them back to the court so I can get my deposit back I can get my money back well I got to thinking about that you know some of us have just skipped bail Christ paid the price for your Sid he paid to get you out of jail and he just wants you to come to the court because you know what's going to happen at the court hey it's gonna you're gonna be forgiven Case Closed justify it's over but all you're doing is running you're just running from the very source of all of your joy the source of all of your deliverance and little did you know there's a bounty out on you I think it's just time you surrender to the message of the hour and say I'm done running I'm ready to to surrender myself to the word and whatever God wants to do in my life that's where it gets hard because we have dreams we have aspirations we got this boy we got this girl we got this school we got this degree and all of these things that we want to do seek ye first the kingdom of God scripture says in Revelations 3 19 as many as I love I rebuked and chasten be zealous therefore and repent I say some of you as we move towards the home stretch here time to repent trying to repent time to turn yourself in hey correction starts at the house of God if we ever get to the place where we don't need to repent and we feel like we just got it all buttoned up something wrong something's wrong but if we can just humble ourselves in his presence in an atmosphere like this and say Lord I realize I'm living below my privileges I realize Lord I believe this message I believe what I'm hearing but I'm not seeing the fruits of this message in my life and I need to repent Lord I need to repent I believe this message Lord I I believe what I'm hearing but Lord I'm not seeing the fruits of this message in my life Lord forgive me But Here I Am Lord maybe I didn't surrender in the past maybe I didn't come Lock Stock and bear like in the past but Lord here I am I'm willing and I'm ready because Lord the Rapture could be tomorrow and I don't want to miss it I want to make my calling an election sure the prophet of God would say in adoptions verily I say unto you you that's little gods now we want to move towards the other side we want to we want to start moving towards look we've repented we're making things right we want to start and start now seeing the fruits of this word in our lives we want to start being an expectation for it you've got to be an expectation you get what you expect right if you're just satisfied with the way you're living and not expecting something further to unfold in you then you become complacent verily I send you you that's little Gods if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you have what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world in nature is groaning it's crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons field Sons speak and their word is backed I believe we're on the border right now that's 1960. that's May 22nd in the evening time that was a few years ago and he said we're right on the border right now I believe we're living in the hour to where the very things that the prophet has spoken the Bride of Jesus Christ is now coming into maturity where we are seeing these things before our very highs I'm in expectation of it I am looking for it and I don't want to stop somebody from getting there prophet of God said if my faith can't go where Enoch don't let me get in somebody else's way don't justify and make excuses well he said at this and it really doesn't mean that no I believe it's I think you can speak the word and all of heaven will back it up that's what we've been restored back to that's what we're speaking on is you're elected to bring forth the fruit for your age or the season don't saddle for anything less don't settle for a feeling don't settle for an emotion don't settle for just a pattern of good works don't don't come so far and they say well you know this is as far as I'm going to come so I'll just manufacture something that's but that was the problem all down through the Old Testament Prophet said eve couldn't wait right Eve couldn't wait she could wait for a husband Abraham and Sarah Sarah just she got soap you know well I can't do anything about it here's Hagar could wait a Madman if we're not careful come on you you hear what the prophet's saying if we're not careful and have a single eye for this message and for what we've seen produced from this message if we start getting our eye on something else we'll lean towards a substitute we'll lean we'll lean towards towards some uh uh substitute for what God is wanting to bring to pass in you but we got to be like Abraham and stagger not at the promise say I don't know when but it's coming I don't know when but it's coming I don't know when but it's here it's here right now it's for you don't settle for anything less the scripture says in First John 3 2 Be Loved now we are the sons of God it does not appear what we shall be but we do know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is well I want to tell you something don't miss his appearing don't let the presence of God go unrecognized now we're coming down to our day we're coming down to Luke 17 30. we're coming down to the revealing of the son of man don't let the presence of God go unrecognized don't let his appearing go unrecognized what was it that happened to Abraham and Sarah there on the plains of memory it was his appearing God appearing in the form of a man Discerning the thoughts and intents of Art and speaking the word who was Melchizedek looking for Hallelujah he didn't come up there and say where's Abraham he came to that tent and said where's your wife where is Sarah and when he spoke he said according to the time of life Sarah was going to conceive and bring forth the promised word the prophet of God would say in the in the unveiling of God he said the Shekinah Glory manifest him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out to you that's the reason that he had to Veil Moses face because in him was the word she give me about 10 or 12 more minutes he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah I hope you can put two and two together he's not going to come right out and say it he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from seeing Jehovah and he veils himself today in Earthen vessels with the Shekinah the outside looks like a bunch of Holy Rollers old Badger skins but the inside hides the Shekinah Glory what did Malachi 4 5 come to do it came to pull you into it came to bring you into that secret place I'll meet you in there but you see we got to stay in the presence we got to stay in the word we gotta lay in the presence of the Sun because outside of this message outside of God veils himself in his word understand that Luke 17 30 was his word and he veiled himself in it when it comes the season when the a when it comes time for the season of the word god veils himself in it search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me it was the very word the very word that had been prophesied now taking on skin God's always failed himself in skin can't you see it there that Pillar of Fire that came down that logos that was caught in that burning bush and Moses turned aside to see it he said Moses I have come down I have come down but then what did he do he sent Moses the prophet of God picks it up and says look he said I have come down it was God going in the form of a man and then he showed that in the time when that Pillar of Fire came down there behind Badger skins in the temple never to come out again showing that he's veiled behind skins until John saw it on the Jordan River descending upon the Lamb of God veils himself behind skin but when you come out of that presence he veils himself in his word look out this message has to become alive this message produces his presence Hallelujah Hallelujah this message produces his presence and outside of that what happens outside of the present a bunch of Wiggle tails and death gets in and that's the problem we got today a lot of people have gotten out of the presence of the message they've mixed a bunch of man's Creeds and ideas and brother branna meant this and he meant that and I'll tell you what the interpretation is and they've tried to manhandle the word of God but this word is unhandled by man it is the Virgin word of God that has come to the Bride of Jesus Christ if you'll just stay in its presence if you'll just feed on it and lay in the presence of the sun you'll bring forth the fruit of the word it's what you're elected to it's what you're called to if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all sin oh I'm running out of time but there that day on Calvary when the veil was rent there was The Mercy Seat hanging in plain view for all men to see what was it it was the word made flesh I want to ask you what has come to you The Mercy Seat the word made flashes come to the bride that you too could live in the Shekinah Glory the prophet would say this in the Rapture God's word is original it's the word and it has to bring forth its kind it's kind in its season elected predestinated by the father God so by God's grace we'll just try to close along these lines just look at look at Hebrews chapter 11. oh of those Patriarchs all of those Heroes of Faith we're living out the word in their season Abel Abel was elected oh yes he was he was elected he knocked he was elected no law he was elected Abraham he was elected we're talking about fruits of your election you want to see fruits of your election look into Hebrews 11. by faith Hallelujah by faith Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain why could Abel do that he was elected faith is a gift that's any man should boast that ought to produce such a humility in the pride how can we be so lifted up and look down on other people just because they can't catch the gift of God to us your heart should break for him you should pray for him and say oh God if you're willing Lord reveal yourself to him Lord is there something I can do to impart life Lord they were good to me now we're talking about fruits of election by faith Enoch by faith Abraham faith comes by hearing the word that those were all fruits of their election they were all playing out their part in the great drama so those are all patterns in the word look we're coming down to our hour put your seatbelt on you you you're you know it's like being in the lineup right anybody ever seen a baseball game you might be back ninth and sometimes back ninth you don't feel too good because you're ninth like that means out of nine people if there was 12 you might have been 12 but since there's only nine you're the worst hitter on the team so you're ninth and you get into the climax of the game and your number one hitter comes up and you're number two and number three and number four and you're you're five you know the one that sits in the pocket there oh man the anchor there and they've drove it in the runs and you've got down to two outs and now it's game seven of the World Series it's bottom of the ninth inning there's two outs bases are loaded it's a full count and the last guy in the lineup everybody's like number nine but the great conductor says that's the way I drew it up that's exactly the way I wanted it I actually have been waiting for this moment for this time for this climax for this moment through all time I've been building to this very hour and this very moment and you feel like the least of all of them but you are the one God predestinated to put death under your feet you're the one he predestinated to live in their Rapture age you're the one he predestinated the live in the bright age you're the one he predestinated to catch the revelation of the son of man you're the one that was predestinated to catch Revelations 10 1-7 you are elected and you were chosen to be the fruit of this age Hallelujah [Applause] the last shall be first and the first shall be last they all played out their part but you got to know the sheet music all right we see the sheet music that they played out we see what Abel had to do right we see what Enoch had to do he had to walk with God we see Abraham we can look down through the scriptures right you can you see the sheet music can you see the part each one of them had to play come on Stay With Me just a little bit more to go hope we're not boring you we see the part that they had to play but now you know I'll be brother Branham um maybe in the unveiling of God or Mighty God unveiled before us I believe he talks about the the drama of Peter and some of the wolf or something like that where you got to know the sheet music right everybody the conductor right everybody's playing their part and it's playing out a picture it's playing out a great drama and everybody got to know their part right win to play on the sheet music you got to know the sheet music you got to know your part that's what the message of the hour has come to do is to tell you your part to tell you your part and praise God we had a rehearsal Hallelujah we had a sheath wave come and show us our part we didn't have to guess what it was he showed us what it was he showed us what it looks like he showed us what the word made flesh for the age looks like and acts like and talks like believes like speaks like well that ain't too fanatical for you it's the fruit of the age the prophet of God says in the Mighty God unveiled before us the word of God is lauded to each age what it is to be and Jesus was the Fulfillment of all the prophecies in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily it was in him he was the one that was in Joseph he was the one that was in Elijah he was the one that was in Moses he was the one that was in he was the one that came to Gideon he was the all these predestinated ones and the time would fail me to tell about Barack and Gideon and all these ones and all the women that received their dead back to life he was the one that was in them he is the one that's in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world each one played their part now I like the story of Gideon we'll end right here along along these lines here come Gideon's turn to play out his part and get in there you know he's thinking on the prophet had given his message and he's thinking all the Our Father Abraham Our Father Isaac and and all of these things he's thinking about all the Royal Seed of Abraham and he's there thinking on the message of the hour and all of a sudden there comes an angel that says Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor who me I I think you got the wrong guy no Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor a prophet of God would pick that up and sound now Gideon thought it was an angel but it was the angel of the Lord Capital Ale o r d it wasn't an angel it was the angel and Gideon who me I'm a mighty man of Valor Gideon was elected he was chosen and the mighty Angel if you will the angel of the Lord he came to Gideon and said Gideon thou Mighty Man of Valor now Gideon didn't feel like a Mighty Man he didn't look like a mighty man he didn't think he was a mighty man but the only thing that mattered was who said what he was the angel of Lords that did in you are a mighty man of Valor the angel Lord came down and said get in you're a mighty man of Aller do you realize what has come down according to the opening of The Seven Seals the mighty Angel has come down and said you are my bride you are predestinated you will bring forth the word of God you will bring forth the fruit of the age it wasn't an angel speaking it was the mighty Angel speaking maybe we'll just call for the musicians we'll keep working towards a close I had to plug this quote in just before service here he says now Gideon when he was out there on the thresh in his wheat no doubt but the prophet's message was going through his heart what that Prophet said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob just be real Reverend now as we come to a close I am the one that brought you out of Egypt I am the one that give you what you've got turn to me and there he and his father out there threshing this wheat and an angel came to him or he thought it was an angel it happened to turn out it wasn't an angel it was God himself because you got to watch that capital l-o-r-d-u-c and when he spoke to Gideon Gideon was a little surprised he said now Mighty Man of Valor he didn't know he was maybe you don't know you are you might be many of those Mighty Men of Valor tonight sitting here the great conductors come down it's time for you to Play Your Part you want to know what your part is it's an open book in plain language the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in their designated decreed season you want to know why you're here and as each member came forth it expressed and took its place in the body thus the bride is the literal spoken word seed bride foreign I believe God came down himself and spoke his bride into existence I believe that with all of my heart it's not what I did get in I think we need some Gideons in here they're recognize who's talking to them [Music] play that song in G for me that the angel of the Lord has come down he's opened the word he's revealed the son of perdition he's revealing himself to you that you can
