me as I would be speaking tonight uh the devil try to put me under pressure all day long but I know that God is uh is good that he will help us tonight to say something that will be of beneficial to us all then let's open our Bibles in the Book of John uh chapter 14 it's a welln very well-known scripture that we know John chapter 14 and we'll read verse 19 [Music] the Bible says yet a little while and the world see me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also amen and we'll take Ephesians chapter 3 Ephesians Ephesians chapter 3 [Music] you for do ver verse three Ephesians 3 from verse 3 to 12 it says Ephesians chapter 3:3 it says how that how that by Revelation he made known unto us unto me the mystery as I as I wrote therefore a few words whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mysteries of Christ which in other age was not made known Unto the Sons of man as it is now re revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophet by the spirit that the Gentile should be fellow Heirs of the same body partakers of his promis in Christ by the gospel go El whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all the saint of all the saints in this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentile The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heaven places might be known by the church the manif manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my uh tribulations for you which is your glory let's pray Lord we ask you bless once again in your word it's just you that could give life in this word that we reading because you said man is just a failure to begin with but you are everything to us bless us once again tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats bless the Lord for being in his house tonight uh the scriptures that we read uh God placed on my heart a little subject um and I will say I'll call it God needs us in order to fulfill his uh purpose or his work God needs say in order for him to finish his work because we know God always need man when God created everything the Bible says every time he [Music] created God will see that the creation was good and the scripture will say it was the morning and it was the night there was the first day the second day until the moment that God created a man he created man in His image in his resemblance when man when God created man he realized it was the achievement of the finishing of his work that he rested when God [Music] rested he gave Dominion of the the the the holding of the power of the earth to man he gave the jurisdiction of the of the earth to man and man had all the power and all the power all the the the might for Earth everything that God represented in heaven man was that representation on Earth man was God on Earth what everything that man uh said God was bringing it to pass the the words of man had the same value as the words of God as long as this man who was placed here on Earth kept the word abided in the word uh the devil came [Music] in and because the devil knew as long as man kept the word that he had all the power the devil came with a portion of the word the devil didn't come to say that the word was not true even when he came to Jesus he didn't come to contradict the word he came with a portion of the word to say that has God really me said yes it's true that God said that but you also know he brought the reasoning in the word and Eve begin to reason with the word and because of one word that was misplaced in the word of God man lost his position when man lost his position what did Adam do Adam who was who who could hear the voice of God Adam whom when God came in the garden of e he had the capability or the attribute to communicate with God when he broke the word he started to go away to move away from the word he started running from the presence of God that's what the devil Christ to do to bring us far away from the presence of God to take us far away from where we can hear the word of God but God but go God who created Man In His Image he didn't he didn't want man to remain in that condition regardless that even the fact that men broke the word of God even though men voluntarily broke the word of God God went searching for that man God came down in the Garden of Eden crying out Adam Adam where are you sometimes we find ourselves in situations where the devil is causing us to move away away from the word of God as true as God did it with Adam when when when if you are Sons and Daughters of God you will hear the voice of God coming after you to tell you Adam Adam where are you to try to bring you back in that position because God want man to be back in the position of godship when God plac his seed in him the the seed that God places places in us it's nothing else but the portion of God himself it's it's God himself in us so we can represent him here on Earth Lord God went in the process of redeeming man and the price was paid it was the uh the the blood of an innocent one Christ himself he came to pay that price bring us back in the position that we had in the Garden of Eden sometimes we don't uh we fail to imagine the privilege that we have to be Sons and Daughters of God sometimes the activities or the the the things of the world the pressure of this world it makes us believe that we are only human we are human it's true but we are not human like all the other humans because what makes the difference it's the seed that God placed in us the the seed that causes that that gives us the hunger and the thirst for the word of God this this this seed that gives us the hunger and The Thirst to be like God Jesus Paid the price but before he went Jesus told his disciples I'm not going to leave you alone I will come back again I will come back again to you I will be with you and even in you until the end of the Earth that's what Jesus said it said the world will see me no more but ye shall see me because I'll be with you and because I live you shall live also the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away and sometimes we say those words but we don't understand or we don't capture the the the deepness or the revelation of what we are saying and sometimes we read the scriptures in the Bible we know these scriptures sometimes but there will be a time and a moment where something will happen that will cause that scripture to become a revelation I remember in brazaville in in the church they they have where they have displayed the script scripture that says that be still and know that I am God and every time we came to church we read that scripture pretty much every day we were used to that scripture and but one day I needed God in a certain circumstance I was praying for a Circ God for a circumstance I came to church and as a habit I read that scripture out there and I went I went on my knees I began to pray uh the Lord according to that situation and when I open my eyes I I go right back to that scripture it didn't have the same meaning anymore because that day it was God telling me directly that in your situation be still and know that I am God and God wants to take us at on he wants to bring us back to his image and to his resemblance says God could have used anything in nature but God chose to abide or to dwell in man God chose to work in man so God needs you and I in order for him to work God made a promise to Abraham it says your seed shall be that will go to a Strange Land and they will go into bondage for 400 years but at the end of the 400 years I will come myself to deliver them from my mighty hand but when the 400 years was up instead of seeing God himself coming down we see a man of of 80 years old with a stick in his hand to say that I've come to deliver the people the same man that 40 years before he was Stronger he killed one Egyptian and he created a big Scandal but when he came back 40 years after tired with a stick in his hand he destroyed the whole Army and he didn't make any Scandal why because it was a man that God took that God used so he can fulfill his promise there was a king in Israel who went away from God Ahab what did God do he found a man when they said in the book of Kings they didn't even know where it came from the story starts Elijah the TSH one of the the the the the Dwellers of GAD says it was a man like of the same nature as us but God could use that God could take and with with his word there would be no rain there will be no DS at least be by my word that it will be only at my word and when spoke those words God accepted that word God made it so that nature will obey that word a man liken unto passion like you and I Joshua a man of like passion in in the midst of the battle he realized that if the sun was to go down that maybe they would have lost the war he didn't go pray he said Son stand still uh Moon stay over there until I finish that which God has committed unto me and nature heard that a man of the same nature as us why it was men that was given unto God they were men that considered every word of God there was a a man Whose desire and and the the heart's desire was to please God they could have had H faults but the desire was to be pleasing to God in every circumstance and God always need man God always need man and tonight my prayer when I say Lord that every time you need a man here I am and I want that to be the prayer for each one of us that from tonight Lord I want to live in such a way I want to consider your word in such a way that every time you need a man Here I Am Lord I give myself to you God saw the the the the unic the EOP the Ethiopian unic he was on his horse reading the Bible the word he was reading the book of Isaiah that he didn't understand God saw that he was reading God saw that he couldn't understand what he was reading God could have opened up his eyes he could have G God could have given him the Revelation but God didn't do that God went and looked for Phillip he said Phillip I have a mission for you here is someone who doesn't know the word someone who needs baptism there is someone who needs the kingdom of God go meet him philli go help him God takes Phillip and take him to where the unic was a man Cornelius a good man who prayed God if if God could have descended in the house of Cornelius and bring the Holy Spirit down like he did it in the day of Pentecost in the upper room but God didn't do it that way God went to look for Peter it says Peter I have a mission for you look at Cornelius with all those that are in his househ they have need of the the the Salvation go in the house of Cornelius so you can help him God meets Paul Saul on the way to to to Damascus God himself the pillow of fire speaks s why are you persecuting me it says oh Lord who are you it says I'm Jesus that you are persecuting uh Paul repented but God didn't give him everything that he needed go God tells him go to ananas oh tonight if God can help us to be an anas to be a Philip to be a Peter to be someone that God can use to help somebody else to to help uh uh uh make light or somebody else's burden to bring somebody else in the presence of God says in the message uh Look Away to Jesus preach member 29th evening 1963 paragraph 256 it says what you look for if you if you are you looking for a a peer person some people think that because the Holy Spirit Works through you you would have to be uh some long Pious fellow walk around and and not even that's not the Holy Spirit God don't deal through Angels like that or supposed to be God deals through man the Bible says that Elijah was man like like passion as we are but you couldn't be with him till you see Jesus uh uh Peter and John at the gate called beautiful and when they pulled them when they pulled them up there about the healing of that man they had perceived that they were ignorant un learned but they they they also perceived that they had been with Jesus see because his life was reflecting through them now depend on what you are looking for God is not looking for us to be like Angels who would walk like Angels but God is looking to see the reflection of Christ through us the works of Christ in our life don't in Simplicity like we are to be useful for somebody else to be in the bridge to bring somebody else in Christ paragraph 28 the woman had read the Bible speaking about the Samaritan woman she know she know there was coming a messiah and she knew what the Messiah would do and as soon as Jesus said to her bring me a drink she said it's not customary he's just an ordinary man he said now if he had been sitting there with with a great big turbine on and all all kinds of ornament over him of some holy man of a holy person why the woman would have said well here's a priest and went on or there's some kind of Rabbi and went on because she was a prostitute so she couldn't have approached a rabbi a holy man so if Jesus was to appear as a rabbi as a a very holy man certainly this prostitute woman just by looking at him from distance she she was going to go a different direction but Jesus looked like an ordinary man but yet all the the the the the fullness of God was dwelling bodily in him we can only be ordinary man but fill with God to represent Christ in this Dying World he says paragraph 260 Minister something something another I see a man come to eat today where I went to eat and that fellow came in and he had enough crosses and things on him uh it's a good thing sometimes them fellow have that I think you ought to you ought to live you got to live to you got to live to life a life you don't have to have a lot of clergy clothes to prove what you are sometimes they drink and carry on so much and smoke cigarettes and everything and they have to wear this uh uh the clergy clothes uh clergy clothes to even know whether they are minister or not that's right I will tell you the clergy clothes for a man to wear is the baptism of the holy spirit that will identify you as being with Jesus Christ with Jesus that's what will do that that that God will finish his mission in you it's not our appearance God can use anybody says that you may be a wash woman you can be an engineer you can be a servant whatever you are God doesn't need your social status for anything and even when he came on Earth he took Peter who couldn't even sign his name he took Matthew who was a a tax collector he took Luke who was a doctor but when they were together there were no difference they did you couldn't tell who's who the the the the identification that was most remarkable was that they had Christ in them that they were finishing or doing the works of Christ that they were walking with Christ says in the deity of Jesus Christ parag paragraph 79 [Music] the deity of him who is he some of them makes him a little a little uh baby he the one who stood on the invisible oh my platform wrecked out his hand and he spoke and said let there be light and there was light that was Jesus Christ for he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not he was he is deity of God look what he did back there talk about miraculous back there you talk about shouting when he performed the miraculous back there when he talked when he did miraculous back there to make the things that are now out of things which was not he spoke and it was so and that same power the same christu Hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it was wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost how much we live under our privilege the same power that brought the world into existence is in the people that have the Holy Ghost that's true men and women it's time that we found out who we are the devil the devil is trying to hide you back tell you you are some little cow down something that's what the devil is trying to tell you oh look every time you pray it's like God is not listening he's not hearing you you're not you're nothing that's the devil God placed in you his seed and he promised that when the world will see him no more you will see him that because he lives you shall live also the devil is trying to intimidate you minim he's trying to uh degrade you but you are a son of God you are a daughter of God it says that the tell tell you that you are something cow down something you are not you are son and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you hallelujah hallelujah is not in heaven will say that everything that God was he poured into Christ and everything Christ was he poured into his church so deity that was in heaven that was God above us it deity Among Us God With Us and today it's deity in us God in us is in you hallu yeah I know you think I'm crazy I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that the almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God in a human being may God help us realize that that the deity is no longer in heaven God dwells in US is not living in us just so we can hide it for ourselves but so we can continue his work so we can do the same things that he did paragraph 81 and he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs oh bees ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but what was what was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down the plagues and everything in the day of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the age of Sword raised the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what will it be who is he Christ the deity and brothers sisters that deity is in you and a and in a little while the world will see me no more shall see me for I will be with you and even in you to the End of the Age it says Christ in the manger no no Christ in you hallelujah hallelujah we are we are we are not worshiping Christ in the manger by Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life hallelujah hallelujah the Creator God himself dwelling in a human being it it it does not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see him as he is for we'll be made like him the spirit in a human being God in a human being God plac his seed in US since before the foundation of the world so we can be his Representatives we can say a man he's a a man when he has a child that child can only be a man or human we are we are children of God deity has to be in US and our walk like the Walk of Jesus has to influence somebody in representing Jesus our surrounding has to have Christ in us not to I walk everyday walk we have to be like Jesus and sometimes the devil uh takes us and causes us to flirt with the world to flirt with sin just for one objective that we may lose in our spirit that we are sons of God that deity dwells in us that's what he did with Adam when Adam sinned all he could say to himself I lost deity I I lost the relationship with God but God wanted to bring him back God always is trying to bring us back says in the message influences preach February 15 1964 paragraph 9am says that's the way sin is don't Tri with it don't see how don't don't see how close you can get to it see how far you can stay away from it don't take no chance if you're going to take a chance I don't I don't I it says I don't want no chance um an old Scotchman one time they said was uh was going to cross a mountain and the carriages was waiting each man wanting to take him across he said I want the best timster to take me one of them said well I can drive I can drive my six horses at the full Gallop within 10 Ines of that Rim around the around the mountain and says far off its death he said I'm I'm good enough attempts to to drive my horses safely around there within 10 Ines of my wheels and not far off and the other said I can I can beat that I can drive I can drive within six in or 4 in I'm sorry I think we're reading the div is it uh paragraph 12 yeah the other said I can beat that I I I it says within I can drive within six inches and four inches never fall off he said he said what about you sir he said this is the third person he said well I don't know I don't like to do that I just hung I just hung the bank he said you take me that's right that's one it isn't how close you can come or how well you think you are fortified to stay away stay it says stay just as far away from sin as you can stay sometimes most time like you you know the devil will take you very close you I'm a Christian you know I'm going to resist but says stay as as far away as you can go as far away as you can you said well I can do this there's no harm in doing this well if there is a question in your mind don't you do it at all anywhere there's a question stay away from it then see then you are absolutely living by faith if there's no if there's no question if there's a question leave it then leave it don't go around it at all look stay away from it the devil will try to bring your excuses but if you want to keep deity in you if you want to continue the works of Christ in the manifestation of the Holy Ghost but what saying stay as far away as you can don't try to come closer and to see how far you can get closer but stay far away as you can and the best way to stay away from that is every time you want to do something what is the scripture say Lord what do you say should I do this should I associate myself with it should I associate myself with such and such if there's a doubt says don't do it and that's how Christ by his holy spirit we'll do that we are his Representatives he needs you he need me tonight he needs you tonight he needs every single one of us tonight to fulfill his work to continue his work regardless of who you are even a child God can do something through a child you know the story of non it was a young girl came and helped non to go to go receive his healing even a young child God can use him he can use so he can help somebody to get into the kingdom of God God needs every single one of us God needs us continues paragraph 26 remember the Bible says you are living written Epistles read of all men oh not many people don't want won't read the Bible but God made God has made you a living representative you are a walking letter they said [Music] should should be walking Bible Christ in you you should be the walking word of God and if you profess to be a Christian and not that you influence you your you're you're influencing you will you will you will you will make you will make will make you have you will have will make you have to answer for many Souls that you've turned away aside as turn away from Christ uhhuh it behooves us tonight to think about that for every man woman boy girl know what you were coming into the Judgment you might escape this that or the other you might beat uh the uh income tax and might escape the internal revenue you might do one thing or another you might you might have run the speed limit and the cup never catches you but one day judge is going to catch you that's certain and we know that man must die and after that the Judgment death is not a hard thing it's a judgment after death that's the bad part and there what you've done in uh on life and how you've influenced others you'll have to answer for it on that day how much more are we are we are we to set aside every weight and the sin that so easily besets us that we might run with patience the race that set before us looking not to the Creeds to the denomination to some the person but to Jesus Christ who is the author and the finisher of our faith we know the Bible says glory be to God that it's us that will judge the Earth and that's why the Bible says that the Judgment starts in the house of God God attracts our attention so we can be in His image and his likeness and on that day we will not be the ones to be answering like brother is saying here of the bad influence because we would have lived like Christ because we would have represented Christ then we can judge he says parag paragraph 30 how we should think them things friends sternly reverently as we see this day approaching and knowing that any any time your life's Pages the book may be close tonight and tomorrow will be too late for you to do it don't put off what you can do today for tomorrow tomorrow may never come don't put to tomorrow tonight that we may put ourselves in the state of urgency to say Lord if you have if you need a body here I am from tonight I give myself I want to follow you I want to consider your word I want to continue your work don't put to tomorrow what may be done today because tomorrow may never come men and women boys and girls maybe sitting here tonight will be in the morg before daylight it's true then your book is closed and you'll never have any another chance this may be the last this may be the last that you'll ever have think of it seriously you say Well it probably isn't probably it's probably it isn't but it could be but remember someday the book is going to close and what you are doing now and especially you people who are claiming to be Christians separate yourself from the things of the the world have nothing to do with the with this with the world Shan it for somebody is watching you somebody is watching you and you you're going to not only send yourself there but going to take them to them to the bad place and you're going to have to answer for your influence the Lord wants us to reconsider our walk we were not created to live like humans to collaborate with sin collaborate with the world but to be Sons and Daughters of God to be representatives of God when God said that from it will come out of this generation a bride a church pure with uh with no uh uh no spot no uh no wrinkles with nothing of resemblance when God said it's like a uh uh uh uh uh he's defying the devil but he's counting on you in counting on me to say to Satan that I told you that there will be somebody with no uh uh spot here they are amen amen right he's counting on you and I it doesn't mean you won't make mistakes it won't mean that you won't fall but says that the just it's not one who's without sin but it's the one who confesses his sins and when they confess their sins because it's not of his nature because it's not of his life to sin but something happened but it's not of their nature the nature is to be like Christ and the more we cry out and the more we'll read of his word and the more we'll pray and the mo will be able to hear his voice and every time the devil will try to bring you to the limit of sin that voice will come to you says that man cannot sin without first rejecting the word of God the devil will first cause you to to reject the word of God but God is telling you tonight that he didn't create you to reject his word but he created you so you can represent him he created you so you can prove to this dying generation that he still has Sons and Daughters even if before you came to church you did something terrible you did something that the surround your people surrounding you knew that you did wrong I want you to consider your position tonight that I am a Son of God tonight that I'm a daughter of God tonight that from tonight I'm going to give my life to the Lord so that you himself can use and even with when I go back the one that saw me commit a sin they told me that I was still a sinner I can remind him that I'm not a sinner God didn't create me to be a sinner God created me to be a son and a daughter and for then from from tonight I'm going to show you until the end of my life that I'm a son and a daughter of God that I'm a Son of God that I will walk according to the word of God that I will meditate upon the word that I will pray to God I will testify of his greatness through my life that my life will only be the representation of God my brother my sister God needs you tonight God need every single one of us with no exception if God permitted for us to be gathered here the scripture says that the word of God is like a rain it cannot fall and return without fulfilling the reason why it came God knows knows certainly that we probably didn't represent him sufficiently but he wants from tonight on that with all our heart that we give ourselves to him so we can represent him that with all your heart don't look at The Human Condition look at at the promise of God look at him who made the promise we heard it last time with the pastor that the most important thing is the one who made the promise is he able if the answer is yes then the question is answered he made the promise because I live ye shall live also that the world will see him no more but you you will see him that the only way for the world to see Christ uh God today it will be through you and I but for us to be that let's not let the devil take us to the limit of sin to bring us to flirt with the world to take us into the destruction of the world what brother Matthew read last time with the artificial intelligence was responding the devil will occupy us on the 24 hours it don't shift 8 to 12 hours it gives you about 8 to 12 hours of work over over time and when you come backs oh did you read the news there elections and the ballots I don't know what's going on with them you you watch it and spend two hours trying to figure it out but oh did you not watch YouTube you go for another three hours by the time you finish you are tied five minutes of prayer and the day is gone and there the devil is sitting there with his hands crossed it says mission accomplished mission accomplished you will say in your head oh I I still go to church every time there's church I go I pay my ties I pay my offering I'm a Christian but the relation with God do you represent him today can God count on you can God count on me let's stand we'll invite the musicians the Bible tells us our bodies are the Temple of the Living God if the Living God dwells in US it means it it means we are alive we have eternal life we have the life of God and that life of God it has to move us so we can have the hunger and The Thirst for God so we it has to push us so we have the hunger and the thirst for the communion with God may God help us so we can have a little more time in prayer and a time in the reading of the word and a time in the uh hearing of the tapes that's what allows us to to approach or come closer to him that's where we real we we come in the realization of the inspiration of the word of God in our lives you could be in a situation you put a tape of and you hear he speaks exactly about what the situation you're going through experience it's it causes an experience it gives you the the the the desire to continue the desire for you to love that God the God who knows you who knows your problems and who's talking to you God need everyone of us let's bow our heads let's pray Lord Jesus Christ by stitch up words you spoke to us even myself in particular we come to you take our lives take our being take everything that we are do that what you will do your will oh Lord don't let us be occupied and busy with other things may we can that we may by let us consider the communion with you Lord we commit ourselves to you we need you Lord you said that without you we could do nothing I commit my brother I commit my sister as you said these words you said in your word be holy as your father in Heaven is Holy be perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect when you said it Lord is because you know that we can be perfect and we know Perfection is only in you I pray oh God that you may may let your spirit just fall upon us may you fill our souls with your spirit that your Perfection oh Lord that your life be in us oh Lord that we may fulfill your work Lord we commit ourselves to you be lifted up forever as we believe with all our hearts that you hear our prayers in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen okay to be like [Music] Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him all through life need from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like [Music] him amen you know it's it's God's power to trans trans form it's not our power to transform I like what our brother said you know you you have to go to the Lord to have help you and uh he sure beckons us to come we have a baptism tonight and uh uh brother Enrique wants to be baptized and uh he knows the hand of the Lord protected him from a very serious situation and how he wants to uh just been on his heart uh you know when God goes to dealing with you he's not going to let go you know he he he doesn't start something and not finish it you know the brother told me his testimony one time we went by the house there and and he wasn't real mindful of the Lord you might say but he said so when lesie and I walked into the house he felt something speak to his heart to get baptized he you know he didn't know anything about baptism but we know why God does it because God's got a a way of doing things he's got a provided way and the formula is repent the formula isn't go make everything right and when you're a saint you know what I mean then come to me no it's when repent means to change I want to change I I want to I want to be different and I'm I'm willing to go to the water and and be cleansed and to be baptized for the remission of my sins that I may receive the Holy Ghost so if uh one of the deacons would take our brother I guess they're taking him to go get him ready and and uh I I know some of you might have young children if you feel you need to go to get your uh children ready for bed uh I understand that but if you'd like to stay and welcome our brother as he gets baptized uh we surely like you to do that so God bless you we're going to go prepare for baptism it'll be here in just a little bit so God bless you go ahead amen we'll just continue to sing that song and I think it's a good time maybe to take a moment and reconsecrate your [Music] life are you going
