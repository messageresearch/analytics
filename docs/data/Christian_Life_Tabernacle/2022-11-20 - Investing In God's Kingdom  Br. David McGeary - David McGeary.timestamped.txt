[12:47] in
[12:48] they'll be bringing into subjection in

[12:52] Lord we dedicated and we surrender all
[12:54] to you right now and to pray that you
[12:57] would have your way
[12:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[13:00] pray this morning
[13:02] amen amen
[13:04] [Music]
[13:06] amen good to be gathered in the house of
[13:08] God
[13:09] I certainly want to welcome everyone all
[13:11] our visitors God bless you this morning
[13:13] Emmanuel may turn around and welcome
[13:15] someone is invited by the cosmen about
[13:17] celebrating this morning
[13:32] foreign
[13:43] God bless you
[13:45] um
[13:48] this is a surprise to you it's also a
[13:50] surprise to me
[13:52] and the Lord bless you
[13:55] but a few words that I can say to
[13:58] get us to read Psalm 100. if you want to
[14:02] turn to Psalm 100
[14:04] we're entering into a week of
[14:06] Thanksgiving
[14:09] and um
[14:10] you know a lot of the times people in
[14:12] this world might identify with
[14:13] Thanksgiving with other things that the
[14:15] Lord May bless them with
[14:17] it may be a family member it may be
[14:20] something that they may try to identify
[14:21] with as far as their personal identity
[14:24] and thankfulness of how they can express
[14:26] their thankfulness to the Lord
[14:29] but we know as a people
[14:31] elected and predestinated of God
[14:34] our thankful heart is a little different
[14:38] and we don't thank him at least myself
[14:40] we don't thank him because he's given me
[14:42] something or
[14:44] because he's provided for me no those
[14:47] things are good they're just benefits
[14:49] but we thank him for him electing us
[14:53] and it's not a thankfulness of
[14:57] just boasting within ourselves of just
[14:59] saying
[15:00] you know Lord I'm so glad by the grace
[15:02] of God that you've given me life no it's
[15:05] greater than that because this election
[15:07] comes with power
[15:08] this election comes with attributes this
[15:11] election comes with the word of God and
[15:14] he's a shepherd of all things and he
[15:17] leads he's sheep
[15:19] and he sheep or he's called I'm sorry
[15:22] he's he's sheep or he's elect
[15:24] and they won't follow another voice
[15:28] they won't follow another man
[15:30] and so our thankful heart today as we're
[15:33] reading this psalm
[15:35] um
[15:36] the verses three and four really stood
[15:39] out to me it says know ye that the Lord
[15:41] he's God
[15:43] it is he that had made us
[15:46] and not we ourselves we are his people
[15:49] and the Sheep of his pasture
[15:53] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[15:56] and into his courts with praise be
[16:00] thankful unto him and bless his name
[16:05] and I wanted to read this quote but
[16:08] Abraham says in the lemon dove in 1960
[16:12] I think it's August 5th
[16:14] it says
[16:16] now I've wondered now I've often
[16:18] wondered why God ever represented us as
[16:21] Lambs
[16:23] we are the Sheep of his pasture
[16:26] if you notice a lamb is one of the most
[16:30] unusual animals
[16:33] that lamb cannot find his way back when
[16:36] he's lost I've race sheep and let her
[16:39] let her sheep get lost
[16:40] he will stand there and bleed till he
[16:43] dies he cannot find his way back he's
[16:46] got to have the shepherd lead him back
[16:49] and we will never find our way back
[16:52] through any other way but through the
[16:55] shepherd
[16:56] the human race lost it
[16:59] he needs they need the shepherd back we
[17:02] cannot find our way back through
[17:04] educational programs we cannot find our
[17:06] way back through science we cannot find
[17:09] our way back through religion the only
[17:11] way back
[17:14] and that's by the shepherd and we know
[17:17] who the shepherd is because in the
[17:19] beginning was the world and the Word was
[17:21] with God and the Word was God and the
[17:23] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[17:26] so let's all read Psalm 100 this morning
[17:30] as we read it together
[17:32] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye
[17:35] Lands serve the Lord with gladness come
[17:39] before his presence with singing know
[17:42] naive that the Lord he is God it is he
[17:45] that had made us and not we ourselves we
[17:48] are his people and the Sheep of his
[17:50] pasture enter into his gates with
[17:53] Thanksgiving and to his courts with
[17:55] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[17:58] his name for the Lord is good his Mercy
[18:02] is Everlasting and his truth endured to
[18:06] all generations amen God bless you
[18:09] amen God bless you may have your seats
[18:12] amen
[18:16] God's attributes were manifested to
[18:20] explore out in this life saying we have
[18:23] called to Revelation by the last
[18:27] prophets may say oh and we know who we
[18:31] are I know what we raise our full praise

[46:21] amen and amen God bless you this morning
[46:27] uh nice to be in the house of the Lord
[46:30] and have a little bible study this
[46:32] morning if you have your Bibles and you
[46:35] would turn with me to the gospel of Mark
[46:47] and this is the scriptures
[46:50] concerning the Rich Young Ruler
[46:53] and uh uh for a reference
[46:59] if you would like to go back and read it
[47:03] I'm ministering from the message that
[47:06] brother Branham preach called investment
[47:09] and he preached it in several different
[47:12] places uh the one that worked is like is
[47:16] in August is 63 but he preached it
[47:20] several times so
[47:22] uh
[47:24] it caught my attention you know and I
[47:27] mean that it must have been a subject
[47:30] that uh
[47:33] is worthy to be considered
[47:36] you you understand when someone repeats
[47:38] something over and over again you might
[47:41] take a moment to say wait a minute there
[47:45] might be something here
[47:46] so naturally you know I can never do it
[47:50] justice but you have the original source
[47:53] so I hope I encourage you to go back to
[47:56] the original source as we ask the Lord
[47:59] to stimulate our hearts and our minds
[48:02] this morning amen
[48:04] it says
[48:09] and this is just after he had blessed
[48:11] the children
[48:13] and when he was gone forth into the way
[48:17] there came one running and kneeling to
[48:22] him
[48:23] and asking him good Master what shall I
[48:28] do that I may inherit
[48:33] eternal life
[48:35] amen and
[48:38] um
[48:41] and Jesus said unto him why call us
[48:45] doubt me good
[48:47] there is none
[48:50] good but one that is God
[48:55] amen thou knowest the Commandments do
[48:59] not commit adultery do not kill do not
[49:03] steal do not bear false witness deprived
[49:07] fraud not honor thy father and mother
[49:12] and he answered and said unto him master
[49:17] all these have I observed from my youth
[49:23] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[49:29] said unto him
[49:31] one thing that lackest
[49:34] go thy way
[49:36] sell whatsoever thou hath
[49:39] and give it to the poor
[49:42] and thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven
[49:46] and come take up the cross and follow me
[49:51] and he he was sad at that saying and
[49:56] went away grieved for he had great
[49:59] possessions
[50:01] amen and Jesus looked around about
[50:06] and said unto his disciples how hardly
[50:09] shall they that have riches enter in to
[50:13] the kingdom of God Heavenly Father we
[50:16] ask you to bless us in Jesus precious
[50:19] name we pray amen God bless you may be
[50:22] seated
[50:29] dude
[50:38] we noticed that in this story and as if
[50:42] you go back and read or listen to these
[50:44] sermons
[50:46] you'll notice that
[50:48] this Young Rich and ruler or this young
[50:53] person he's a pretty good type or
[50:56] example of most people
[51:00] in general not only people that have a
[51:03] lot but people uh in general they have a
[51:08] great desire to do something or to
[51:15] accomplish something but when it comes
[51:18] time to
[51:20] paying the cost
[51:22] that's when things change
[51:25] and we notice that this uh ruler he must
[51:29] obviously noticed that Jesus had
[51:34] something
[51:35] he had something to offer he had
[51:38] something that he was showing forth we
[51:42] know that in the scriptures like in
[51:45] Matthew
[51:46] 9 and 35 Acts 20 and 25 those are
[51:52] scriptures that were referring that
[51:55] Jesus went forth preaching the kingdom
[51:59] of God
[52:01] so he he was he was went and began to
[52:06] preach that there's something that
[52:09] exists that that that is there that's
[52:13] real and it we like to use this
[52:17] expression if uh I could in no means to
[52:22] uh make it seem of less value but Jesus
[52:27] was presenting or we might use the word
[52:30] selling
[52:32] uh not in the fact that he was asking
[52:36] for uh some something monetary but he
[52:41] was mating the people aware that there
[52:44] was another kingdom
[52:47] and I believe that all of us here this
[52:52] morning
[52:52] uh realized that there's got to be
[52:56] something more than just this world
[53:01] uh we can look over the time of the
[53:04] world and we can see the progression of
[53:07] it
[53:08] uh I mean it's hard to believe uh I hope
[53:12] this isn't too carnal but it's hard to
[53:15] believe that at one time there was no
[53:17] indoor plumbing
[53:22] you know look how soft you are
[53:25] you can't imagine life without indoor
[53:28] plumbing
[53:29] there was a time that there was not a
[53:32] telephone
[53:35] there was a time that there wasn't an
[53:39] automobile
[53:42] ah
[53:44] let's all walk over to brother Tommy's
[53:47] house for
[53:49] lunch
[53:50] I'd get there about two weeks from now
[53:55] come up because we want to uh
[53:59] try to catch our minds this morning
[54:03] imagine that there was not an airplane
[54:09] imagine the only way you could get
[54:11] across the ocean was in a boat
[54:15] driven by wind
[54:17] and it would take two or three months
[54:21] to travel
[54:24] imagine that there was no electricity
[54:29] that everything that you did was
[54:34] by candlelight
[54:36] okay
[54:38] could you imagine that
[54:41] you only had one or two dresses
[54:48] or even worse one pair of shoes
[54:51] hmm
[54:53] that was for the Sisters
[54:57] you could imagine all the things that
[55:02] uh
[55:04] we have now
[55:06] and how soft living has become
[55:09] and
[55:11] and
[55:14] in
[55:15] realizing this we realize that things
[55:20] have progressed and we've got science
[55:24] and technology and
[55:27] education and all these great things but
[55:31] all these great things are
[55:34] are of the devil
[55:38] because they're not of the kingdom of
[55:41] God
[55:42] and so when Jesus came Jesus came
[55:45] preaching that there is a a land uh
[55:51] beyond the river if we could say it that
[55:55] or life after death
[55:57] but so many times that we begin to place
[56:02] that life after death as being the
[56:06] kingdom of God
[56:08] but the scripture tells us behold the
[56:11] kingdom of God is at hand
[56:13] if you would read in Matthew that's what
[56:16] John went out preaching he preached
[56:19] repent of your sins
[56:21] and and behold because the kingdom of
[56:25] God is at hand
[56:27] so the kingdom of God is is uh more the
[56:32] Bible tells us than words it it's uh it
[56:37] is the power of God for that's First
[56:40] Corinthians 4 and 20 the kingdom of God
[56:44] is not in word only but in power
[56:48] so the the scripture was trying to allow
[56:53] us to realize that there is another
[56:56] kingdom and now we talk about seeking
[56:59] the kingdom of God and so first of all
[57:02] Jesus came preaching the kingdom of God
[57:06] he and that was what that he was trying
[57:10] to get man to realize that there's more
[57:13] to this life than this life
[57:18] and there's more to this world than just
[57:22] the carnal world that you see
[57:25] all the things that man has done all the
[57:29] technology and all the great things that
[57:33] have gone forth to make life easiest for
[57:35] us we've got to realize that that's
[57:38] Satan's Eden
[57:40] that's the kingdom that Satan is
[57:43] building
[57:45] that we would seek his kingdom
[57:48] instead of the kingdom of God
[57:52] and Jesus came to
[57:56] bring us to the awareness that the
[58:00] kingdom that we see the Easy Living that
[58:04] we see the the way that man thinks uh I
[58:11] I kind of Marvel at the thinking of man
[58:15] we don't want to have the thinking of
[58:16] man we want to have the thinking of God
[58:20] but I think it's for good for us to
[58:23] realize you know to that man now they
[58:26] don't they want to get rid of all fossil
[58:30] fuel and they want to run on batteries
[58:33] because uh
[58:36] they don't want the air that they're
[58:39] breathing
[58:40] to get polluted
[58:42] to where that they can't breathe and yet
[58:45] they'll eat so much junk
[58:49] you know what I mean that's destroying
[58:52] their body there there's being destroyed
[58:55] from within
[58:57] trying to protect themselves from what's
[59:00] without
[59:02] and I think if we're not careful
[59:04] spiritually we get destroyed Within
[59:09] and and that's what we want to grow
[59:13] stronger in this morning
[59:15] and just wanting to share this little
[59:18] short thought with you this morning that
[59:22] there is another kingdom
[59:24] there is something else that runs
[59:27] parallel
[59:28] to the life that we're living
[59:32] to the uh daily emotions we have in our
[59:37] five senses and our emotional inlets and
[59:41] all the things that we come in contact
[59:44] with and that we strive for uh we strive
[59:49] to survive
[59:51] we feel that it's important to maybe
[59:55] have some of these luxuries pay our
[59:58] electric bill pay our water bill uh you
[1:00:02] know have an automobile rent an
[1:00:04] apartment rent shelter uh to have all
[1:00:08] these things and act and we become
[1:00:11] totally conscious of of the world that's
[1:00:15] around us and and we begin to uh to
[1:00:21] strive of for that comfort and for that
[1:00:25] existence
[1:00:28] and a lot of effort Goes Forth to that
[1:00:32] but wouldn't it be wonderful and and I'm
[1:00:35] going to talk this morning because I
[1:00:37] believe you're all believers
[1:00:39] we come off a wonderful uh weekend of
[1:00:44] meetings
[1:00:45] and we saw in those great things the how
[1:00:48] the Lord came and spoke to us and I know
[1:00:51] many of you enjoyed because it was
[1:00:54] placed in such a beautiful manner about
[1:00:58] the will of God for our lives
[1:01:01] and uh how brother Michael brought out
[1:01:04] about uh the arrows
[1:01:07] that in this Bible story we remember he
[1:01:10] talked about a man just took an arrow
[1:01:12] and shot an arrow uh he just shot it out
[1:01:16] towards the enemy he didn't have a
[1:01:18] Target
[1:01:19] but there was a prophecy right that the
[1:01:21] dogs would lick the blood so God used
[1:01:24] that Arrow to strike the king and
[1:01:28] fulfill that prophecy
[1:01:30] and so we realized then that God had
[1:01:33] prophecy for our lives
[1:01:36] that he wants to fulfill
[1:01:39] and we realize that by using that
[1:01:43] analogy that uh when we have need of
[1:01:46] something that of the scripture tells us
[1:01:50] that don't be worried about those things
[1:01:54] right that God's got uh
[1:01:58] we can use in that terminology he's got
[1:02:00] an arrow or he's got a plan for your
[1:02:04] life because he said that he would
[1:02:07] Supply our every knee
[1:02:09] so he knows the beginning from the end
[1:02:13] he knows where you'll be tomorrow
[1:02:16] he knows where you'll be in two weeks
[1:02:18] from now
[1:02:19] he knows everything that's going to come
[1:02:22] your way
[1:02:23] he knows the burdens that you have he
[1:02:26] knows the sufferings he has he knows he
[1:02:28] knows the enemy
[1:02:31] that's going to attack you
[1:02:35] he understands that in fact he he gave
[1:02:39] us the weapon already
[1:02:41] to defeat all the attacks of the enemy
[1:02:45] that ever will come against us every
[1:02:48] circumstance every trial every battle
[1:02:52] and everything he's already given us
[1:02:55] something to to combat that he gave us
[1:02:58] his word
[1:03:00] he knew the battle would be in our mind
[1:03:03] he knew that's where Satan would get us
[1:03:06] is with our thinking just thinking
[1:03:09] thinking thinking you know have you ever
[1:03:12] had uh one of those nights I I'm
[1:03:16] mentioning this because I just had one
[1:03:18] where you can lay down but your mind
[1:03:20] won't stop
[1:03:23] I mean it's just
[1:03:26] and you're trying
[1:03:29] you're just trying to get to sleep and
[1:03:32] you want to just go to that other realm
[1:03:35] you know where you dream dreams and and
[1:03:38] you kind of your body just seems to rest
[1:03:41] but your mind's just churning churning
[1:03:44] churning well that's what he does to us
[1:03:46] all the time
[1:03:48] he keeps our mind working and working
[1:03:51] and working and working
[1:03:54] and and laboring and and struggling and
[1:04:00] trying to survive and yet the Lord came
[1:04:04] preaching a kingdom that says I give you
[1:04:08] peace that surpasseth understanding
[1:04:12] I give you Joy
[1:04:14] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:04:18] look he told the the little lady at the
[1:04:22] well because she says he's she said give
[1:04:26] me the drink and and and she said this
[1:04:29] isn't customary he said if you know who
[1:04:32] I was
[1:04:34] if you knew what I had to offer
[1:04:37] if you knew what I was telling people
[1:04:40] about
[1:04:42] if you knew what I was preaching
[1:04:45] if you knew what I was going to The
[1:04:47] Villages and the highways and the byways
[1:04:50] and into the cities and into the
[1:04:53] synagogues and telling everybody uh what
[1:04:57] I've been showing them and what I've
[1:04:59] been presenting to them you would ask me
[1:05:04] for the product
[1:05:06] because that I'm presenting
[1:05:10] he says because I have Living Water
[1:05:15] and if you drink of this water you'll
[1:05:18] never thirst
[1:05:22] can you imagine you'll never hunger
[1:05:25] you'll never thirst after the things of
[1:05:28] the world there there won't be a desire
[1:05:31] to have to survive there won't be a
[1:05:34] desire to have to climb the ladder there
[1:05:37] won't be a desire for the things of the
[1:05:40] world
[1:05:42] but there's something that can come that
[1:05:45] that satisfies the soul
[1:05:49] and and that is the kingdom of God
[1:05:53] the kingdom of God is something that's
[1:05:56] present tense
[1:05:59] and so that's what he was preaching
[1:06:02] he was preaching the existence if I
[1:06:05] could say this of a place where there
[1:06:09] was rest
[1:06:11] come unto me all ye that are heavy laden
[1:06:14] and I will give you rest
[1:06:18] I wonder how many uh believers
[1:06:22] and let's take them not only within the
[1:06:25] framework of this message
[1:06:27] but Believers of all Faith people that
[1:06:31] claim to believe
[1:06:34] in the Lord Jesus who have no rest
[1:06:41] they have no security
[1:06:44] they have no place of comfort
[1:06:48] they're always worried
[1:06:51] about what's down the road
[1:06:54] they're always concerned about their
[1:06:57] finances they're always concerned about
[1:07:01] their health
[1:07:04] you know I mean I I drive by I try it
[1:07:07] every now and then to go work out a
[1:07:09] little bit you know what I mean and then
[1:07:11] the the only benefit I ever get from it
[1:07:15] is sore muscles
[1:07:18] and you got to go back at it again you
[1:07:20] got to keep up keep it up
[1:07:23] and and but they're concerned about
[1:07:25] their life they're concerned about their
[1:07:27] health they're concerned about their
[1:07:29] jobs they're concerned about their
[1:07:31] station in life
[1:07:33] whether they're climbing the ladder
[1:07:35] going up the ladder they're concerned
[1:07:37] about their 401K uh do you know how much
[1:07:41] money do they have for the future
[1:07:45] and the Lord said that fool
[1:07:48] no it's not
[1:07:50] that your life may be required of you
[1:07:53] this night
[1:07:54] they've got this this terrible burden
[1:08:00] and and the burden is the burden of this
[1:08:05] world
[1:08:07] to be able to keep up
[1:08:10] with the world
[1:08:13] and and we've seen in time
[1:08:17] how people have came to recognition of
[1:08:22] the world and the way that it's going if
[1:08:25] you go back and look at the Mennonites
[1:08:27] and the the different uh the Amish and
[1:08:32] the different people back in that air
[1:08:34] when the Industrial Revolution came and
[1:08:38] they saw the advancement of man because
[1:08:41] they recognize that
[1:08:45] that's right you understand as being the
[1:08:49] the things of the world
[1:08:51] and things that would take them farther
[1:08:54] away from God so they they stopped right
[1:08:58] there
[1:09:00] they weren't going to take on the
[1:09:04] technology
[1:09:08] of the gasoline engine
[1:09:13] of machine driven things
[1:09:17] because they weren't sure where it was
[1:09:21] leading
[1:09:24] they couldn't find evidence of it in
[1:09:27] their scriptures
[1:09:28] so I want you to look at a people
[1:09:32] that saw
[1:09:35] the world
[1:09:40] I I I'm just being honest with you this
[1:09:43] morning you know what I mean I I hope
[1:09:45] you don't
[1:09:46] just come here so that I can flatter you
[1:09:51] you know oh you're all going to heaven
[1:09:56] it's going to be an easy run
[1:09:58] no it's not
[1:10:03] but but they recognize and I think
[1:10:06] that's sometimes that where we fail to
[1:10:08] to come to the realization is is what
[1:10:12] the world is
[1:10:16] what is the world
[1:10:19] can what are the the the things of the
[1:10:23] world
[1:10:27] and I think that isn't one of the things
[1:10:31] that we're all striving here this
[1:10:33] morning is I believe we're all here
[1:10:35] because we want to we know there's
[1:10:38] another kingdom
[1:10:42] we know there's another life a
[1:10:44] Spirit-filled life
[1:10:47] we understand that so if you can look at
[1:10:50] a people that today
[1:10:54] our God
[1:10:57] living with horse and Buggies
[1:11:01] no lights
[1:11:03] candles
[1:11:05] they don't want to go
[1:11:07] any further
[1:11:09] because they had a recognition of the
[1:11:12] world
[1:11:14] and of course we know that they things
[1:11:16] begin to break down and okay and they
[1:11:19] begin to try to come up with other
[1:11:21] things we're not necessarily here to
[1:11:24] talk about their lifestyle and their
[1:11:28] choices but we are talking about how
[1:11:32] that man
[1:11:35] in different times recognized the world
[1:11:41] and the things of the world
[1:11:44] so let's just turn in our Bible I don't
[1:11:47] really have a a any exact pattern that
[1:11:51] we're
[1:11:52] we're going to but
[1:11:54] let's look over in uh
[1:11:57] Matthew uh
[1:12:03] the sixth chapter
[1:12:17] let's just go to the 19th verse
[1:12:20] so one of the things we talk a lot about
[1:12:23] here being in the message is the mind of
[1:12:28] Christ
[1:12:29] right let this mind be in you that was
[1:12:32] in Christ to think like Christ what is
[1:12:35] the word the thoughts expressed having
[1:12:38] the word of God having the word of God
[1:12:40] in our thoughts thinking like the word
[1:12:43] of God that's what we want because
[1:12:46] that's what our our hearts desire is is
[1:12:49] if we're not going to have you you've
[1:12:52] heard the expression a change of heart
[1:12:55] well they had a change of heart in the
[1:12:58] matter well that means they changed
[1:13:00] their thinking about it they changed
[1:13:03] their reasoning about it they changed
[1:13:06] their approach about it
[1:13:09] that's why we always give one another
[1:13:12] the benefit of the doubt
[1:13:14] you know we don't automatically take a
[1:13:17] negative stance against something or
[1:13:20] somebody that everything that they're
[1:13:23] doing they've got an alternative motive
[1:13:25] and objective you know stand back and
[1:13:28] don't make judgment don't be quick to
[1:13:30] judge
[1:13:32] don't let Satan push you from one side
[1:13:35] to the other or get a bad feeling or a
[1:13:38] bad opinion about somebody or or let him
[1:13:41] plant a seed in your mind against
[1:13:42] somebody oh they're just stuck up
[1:13:45] they're just this knob or or they're
[1:13:47] just this or they're that that there may
[1:13:49] not be a lot of of the other side of the
[1:13:52] story that you don't know
[1:13:56] so you you don't you don't come you're
[1:13:58] slow to judgment slow to wrath slow to
[1:14:02] speak evil
[1:14:05] you know what I mean because there might
[1:14:07] be something that comes along that
[1:14:10] changes your thinking
[1:14:15] I I remember brother uh
[1:14:19] uh Ernie villain wave I I believe he
[1:14:23] preached the message called a paradigm
[1:14:25] shift
[1:14:27] because he's gone to be with the Lord
[1:14:29] but uh he said that the minute people
[1:14:33] have it opinions
[1:14:34] of something
[1:14:36] and and they'll look at it and they'll
[1:14:39] have an opinion about it and then all of
[1:14:42] a sudden certain information
[1:14:45] becomes available and instantly they
[1:14:49] have a complete Paradigm Shift about
[1:14:52] something
[1:14:54] about somebody
[1:14:56] you know what I mean when you find out
[1:14:58] more information it changes your heart
[1:15:01] it changes your attitude it changes your
[1:15:06] approach because now you have a greater
[1:15:09] Enlightenment and a greater
[1:15:11] understanding and that's what we're here
[1:15:13] to do and that's what our messenger came
[1:15:16] to do was to open our eyes that we could
[1:15:19] see things the way God sees it
[1:15:24] and when you begin to see things the way
[1:15:27] God sees it it becomes more evident to
[1:15:30] you that what Satan's trying to sell you
[1:15:37] Satan appears as an angel of Light
[1:15:42] and that doesn't mean he shows up in a
[1:15:45] shining suit of armor
[1:15:49] no his things
[1:15:53] that he offers appears to be beneficial
[1:15:58] to you
[1:16:02] for your betterment
[1:16:06] you know what I mean I I'm not good with
[1:16:09] technology I just missed it by a few
[1:16:11] years
[1:16:13] but everything they think is beneficial
[1:16:18] a paperless Society
[1:16:23] a cashless Society
[1:16:27] everybody does everything not on their
[1:16:30] phone well I can't see it
[1:16:34] I can't touch it
[1:16:36] I don't believe it's there
[1:16:42] Leslie will say your boarding passes on
[1:16:45] your phone I'd make me a paper one
[1:16:48] I'm the only one in line with the paper
[1:16:51] but I know I got it
[1:16:55] I'm not going to go to that stupid box
[1:16:58] and touch the wrong thing and have that
[1:17:01] dude disappear
[1:17:03] and then stand there for 15 minutes I
[1:17:07] know it's in there somewhere
[1:17:10] I don't even know if it's there
[1:17:13] or if it's up there
[1:17:15] This Cloud deal scares me
[1:17:21] because to me now I know I'm crazy like
[1:17:24] I said that you can't I can't help it
[1:17:26] I've done lost it a long time ago
[1:17:29] but if he's supposed to come in the
[1:17:31] clouds then what's this other thing up
[1:17:34] there in the clouds
[1:17:36] to me it's just a perversion
[1:17:41] you know just the type
[1:17:45] I lost my thought
[1:17:48] s May where was I at
[1:17:55] e all right I don't know what I was
[1:17:57] talking about before I started talking
[1:17:59] about this
[1:18:00] but anyway so we we know that there's
[1:18:02] this uh another kingdom so we know the
[1:18:06] battles in the mind and everything is
[1:18:08] like beneficial and he wants it to make
[1:18:12] it look beneficial but so let's look at
[1:18:15] how Jesus
[1:18:17] looked at things
[1:18:21] now remember
[1:18:24] all the kingdoms of the world were
[1:18:27] offered to him
[1:18:34] oh yeah he offered them Steve Jobs and
[1:18:37] Bill Gates and Amazon and and uh
[1:18:43] Zulu land and you name it
[1:18:46] they were all offered to him all the
[1:18:49] kingdoms of the world all the things
[1:18:55] that had control
[1:18:58] over the people
[1:19:04] all the things that control mankind
[1:19:08] were offered to Jesus
[1:19:12] all the sports world
[1:19:15] just think
[1:19:17] this morning people got out is freezing
[1:19:20] cold
[1:19:21] but they got out real early
[1:19:24] they put paint on their face
[1:19:28] they put numbers on their on their uh
[1:19:34] uh clothes you know what I mean Viking
[1:19:38] hats and big cheese heads and whatever
[1:19:41] other crazy thing that they're
[1:19:44] worshiping
[1:19:46] and they're going to get up and they're
[1:19:48] going to drive down there real early and
[1:19:50] they're going to start a barbecue and
[1:19:52] they're gonna sit there all day so then
[1:19:54] they're going to pay three four hundred
[1:19:56] dollars
[1:19:57] to go in and watch people running around
[1:19:59] for a couple hours
[1:20:03] those things
[1:20:04] were controlling
[1:20:08] the minds and actions
[1:20:13] of the people
[1:20:16] and they were all offered
[1:20:23] to Jesus
[1:20:25] but look at his mind
[1:20:27] let's just read here
[1:20:38] the 19th verse of the sixth chapter
[1:20:42] the mind of the Lord
[1:20:45] lay not up yourselves Treasures
[1:20:49] upon the Earth
[1:20:51] where moth and rust doth corrupt
[1:20:56] and where thieves break through and
[1:20:59] steal
[1:21:05] this morning about three o'clock in the
[1:21:07] morning
[1:21:09] all of a sudden I have a panic attack
[1:21:13] I think my goodness I didn't lock the
[1:21:16] trailer up
[1:21:19] and I've had one stolen
[1:21:21] so at three o'clock in the morning I'd
[1:21:23] get out of bed
[1:21:27] oh you don't think that this mind
[1:21:31] will make you do things
[1:21:34] how do I get out of bed and I wasn't
[1:21:36] sleeping good anyway and I got dressed
[1:21:39] and I drove over to the church and lo
[1:21:41] and behold there the trailer was and
[1:21:43] somebody had put the bucket down on it
[1:21:45] and it was safe and secure and I went
[1:21:48] back home to try to get
[1:21:51] some sleep
[1:21:55] you know what I'm saying and and so the
[1:21:59] power of these things is a man man where
[1:22:02] thieves break through and steal
[1:22:05] so in other words I had to be totally
[1:22:08] aware
[1:22:10] that there's people out there that steal
[1:22:15] you understand a thief to me is one of
[1:22:18] the lowest down human beings there are
[1:22:24] that's me personally
[1:22:26] I can't believe somebody would steal
[1:22:28] another person's livelihood steal their
[1:22:31] tools steal the things that they work
[1:22:34] with I mean who who would do such a a
[1:22:38] thing like that
[1:22:41] somebody that doesn't have the mind of
[1:22:45] Christ
[1:22:46] that's who does those things people that
[1:22:49] are living with a different mindset a
[1:22:53] different mind in them they don't have
[1:22:56] the mind of the Lord they only have the
[1:22:58] mind of the world and the things of the
[1:23:00] world and they seek after the things of
[1:23:02] the world but listen to what he's saying
[1:23:05] here he says late night your Treasures
[1:23:06] up where Thief Rick Inman but lay up
[1:23:10] yourselves Treasures in Heaven
[1:23:13] where neither moth nor rust of corrupt
[1:23:16] or where thieves do not break through
[1:23:20] nor steal
[1:23:25] for where your Treasures is there will
[1:23:28] your heart
[1:23:30] be also
[1:23:33] the light of the body is the eye
[1:23:37] if therefore the eye be single thy whole
[1:23:41] body shall shall be full of Light how
[1:23:44] many knows what he means when the
[1:23:46] singleness of I that doesn't mean one
[1:23:48] eye people
[1:23:52] it means when you're only looking and
[1:23:56] concentrating and projecting in one way
[1:24:00] in one way another those that seek the
[1:24:04] kingdom of God first their whole body
[1:24:08] will be their light now isn't this what
[1:24:10] we've all been talking about be more in
[1:24:13] the kingdom of God more like Christ more
[1:24:16] have our light shine
[1:24:18] be more spiritual
[1:24:22] doesn't everybody want to hear be more
[1:24:24] spiritual than more carnal
[1:24:28] why because we know what the reward of
[1:24:31] carnality is
[1:24:33] the wages of sin is what death
[1:24:39] the gift of God's eternal life
[1:24:47] but if I I be evil
[1:24:50] the whole body shall be full of Darkness
[1:24:53] if they're they're
[1:24:55] if they're for the light that is in thee
[1:24:59] be Darkness how great is that Darkness
[1:25:06] think of these things we don't even
[1:25:07] realize how dark
[1:25:11] Things Are
[1:25:13] or even in your lives if there's things
[1:25:16] in there that aren't right
[1:25:18] how how dark is that Darkness
[1:25:24] I want to get rid of that Darkness don't
[1:25:27] you
[1:25:30] no man can serve two masters
[1:25:33] for either he will hate the one and love
[1:25:37] the other or else he'll hold to the one
[1:25:40] and despise the other you cannot serve
[1:25:44] God and Mann them
[1:25:48] or the world
[1:25:50] see it's coming down Church to one or
[1:25:54] the other
[1:25:56] religion
[1:25:58] and denominations
[1:26:01] and the world religious system allows
[1:26:04] you to do both
[1:26:09] and that was the condition of this Rich
[1:26:11] Young Ruler
[1:26:14] he wanted to serve God because he
[1:26:17] recognized that there was something
[1:26:18] there that he didn't have and he wanted
[1:26:22] it
[1:26:24] what must I do
[1:26:28] to have what you have
[1:26:32] because Jesus was preaching the kingdom
[1:26:35] in other words he possessed something
[1:26:37] didn't he he possessed a life
[1:26:41] and an atmosphere and an attitude and an
[1:26:46] ability that was Supernatural in other
[1:26:50] words what he had is he had a power
[1:26:56] he had a power
[1:26:59] over the things of the world
[1:27:02] in other words because things of the
[1:27:04] world that didn't get him
[1:27:11] he said foxes have holes and birds have
[1:27:14] nests but the son of man has no place to
[1:27:18] lay his head in other words I don't have
[1:27:21] worldly possessions
[1:27:27] he relied on the father
[1:27:30] he was walking the our Prophet described
[1:27:34] it to light to us like this he was a
[1:27:36] Mystic
[1:27:37] hmm
[1:27:38] walking in a world all of his own
[1:27:42] tax time
[1:27:45] fish
[1:27:49] needed some Finance throw your net
[1:27:53] on the other side
[1:27:56] why does that murmur that the hath
[1:27:58] brought no bread
[1:28:01] look at his mind
[1:28:04] look at where he was
[1:28:06] look at really look at the Kingdom
[1:28:11] that he was preaching
[1:28:13] the power that he was preaching his
[1:28:16] freedom from the world what it was that
[1:28:19] he was representing and telling people
[1:28:22] existed
[1:28:26] he was showing everybody that there was
[1:28:29] another existence
[1:28:34] of another kingdom another way to live
[1:28:38] another Power another way of thinking
[1:28:42] another way of approaching
[1:28:47] and he wasn't entangled with it
[1:28:52] and this Rich Young Ruler saw that and
[1:28:56] he wanted some of it
[1:28:59] well let's just continue
[1:29:10] therefore I say unto you take no thought
[1:29:13] of your life
[1:29:20] how many is good at that
[1:29:24] we're loaded down with thoughts of our
[1:29:26] life
[1:29:33] I don't can you imagine me spending 10
[1:29:36] minutes in front of the mirror
[1:29:41] I ain't going to change it
[1:29:45] I got a change coming
[1:29:48] Hallelujah
[1:29:50] but I'm not why should I care about that
[1:29:53] be clean
[1:29:55] you know what I mean
[1:29:58] I don't believe in not being clean
[1:30:00] I don't believe in coming to church not
[1:30:03] having bathed in two or three days and
[1:30:05] think that the the aroma that you set
[1:30:08] off is spiritual
[1:30:14] look I believe in being clean but he
[1:30:17] says take no thought of your life what
[1:30:20] ye shall eat
[1:30:22] or what you shall drink
[1:30:24] nor yet for your body
[1:30:27] what ye shall put on is not the life
[1:30:32] more than meat and the body more than
[1:30:35] reign of it
[1:30:38] now we're talking about the mind of the
[1:30:40] Lord how he looked how he proceeded
[1:30:43] behold the fowls of the air for they so
[1:30:46] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[1:30:48] Barns and yet your heavenly father
[1:30:51] feedeth them are ye not much better than
[1:30:55] they
[1:30:57] which of you taking thought
[1:31:00] can add one cubic unto your stature
[1:31:08] and why take he thought for intimate
[1:31:12] consider the lilies of the field
[1:31:15] how they grow
[1:31:17] and toil not neither do they spin and I
[1:31:22] say unto you that even Solomon and All
[1:31:25] His glory was not arrayed like one of
[1:31:29] these wherefore if God so clothed the
[1:31:32] grass of the fields which today is and
[1:31:37] tomorrow is cast in the oven shall he
[1:31:40] not much more clothe You O ye of little
[1:31:45] faith
[1:31:47] in other words you that don't believe
[1:31:51] that this other Kingdom
[1:31:55] that's running parallel
[1:31:58] and alongside this world that our flesh
[1:32:03] is in
[1:32:04] exists
[1:32:08] I wonder how many are of us are totally
[1:32:11] aware that there is another kingdom here
[1:32:16] right now
[1:32:24] and we can't serve
[1:32:27] both of them
[1:32:31] what was Lady Elsia
[1:32:34] lukewarm
[1:32:37] what is lukewarm it's a mixture of hot
[1:32:41] and cold
[1:32:47] it's a lukewarm person
[1:32:50] trying to serve the
[1:32:52] world
[1:32:54] and serve God too
[1:32:56] this Rich Young Ruler was the evidence
[1:33:02] of the lady of sea of spirit
[1:33:06] in that day
[1:33:09] when it came time to sell out
[1:33:15] a hundred percent to this life
[1:33:20] this power
[1:33:23] this way of thinking and this existence
[1:33:27] of the kingdom of God that's here right
[1:33:31] now
[1:33:33] he knew in order to do that he would
[1:33:36] have to live leave this thinking this
[1:33:40] world these possessions
[1:33:45] he said what must I do to inherit
[1:33:50] the kingdom
[1:33:54] if I could just for this morning get it
[1:33:56] out of your mind the kingdom is in
[1:33:59] heaven
[1:34:07] Heavens were those that possess the
[1:34:09] kingdom go
[1:34:11] when this world is destroyed but they
[1:34:15] already have the kingdom
[1:34:17] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[1:34:22] Luke 17 21
[1:34:24] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[1:34:32] why if it's within you it's something
[1:34:34] that you possess
[1:34:36] is something that's going to give you
[1:34:39] something that's going to separate you
[1:34:41] from the world and the things of the
[1:34:43] world let us finish reading
[1:34:46] therefore take no thought
[1:34:49] saying what shall we eat
[1:34:51] or what shall we drink
[1:34:55] or whether with shall we be clothed
[1:34:58] for all these things do the Gentiles
[1:35:02] seek
[1:35:03] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:35:05] you have need of all these things
[1:35:08] but seek ye first
[1:35:12] the kingdom of God
[1:35:14] and his righteousness and all these
[1:35:17] things shall be added unto you
[1:35:20] take their no thought
[1:35:23] for the morrow for the moral shall take
[1:35:26] shall take thought
[1:35:29] for
[1:35:30] the things of itself
[1:35:33] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:35:37] thereof
[1:35:39] he was showing and preaching a kingdom
[1:35:43] then he showed the existence
[1:35:47] of that Kingdom
[1:35:51] he showed the existence of that Kingdom
[1:35:53] when he met the woman at the well
[1:35:55] he showed the existence of that Kingdom
[1:35:58] when that Widow came with her dead son
[1:36:02] on the way to bury him
[1:36:05] and that Kingdom and the fruits of this
[1:36:08] Kingdom which the wages of sin is death
[1:36:10] came in contact with the resurrection
[1:36:13] and the life
[1:36:16] and when those two kingdoms collided
[1:36:21] as Amen in the way
[1:36:24] his life
[1:36:27] was greater than the death that he
[1:36:31] encountered
[1:36:34] and
[1:36:36] he beheld the Widow
[1:36:39] he understood her plight he understood
[1:36:42] her sorrow but because of what that he
[1:36:45] was that death could not go past him and
[1:36:48] he proved that his kingdom I am the way
[1:36:52] the truth the life no man cometh unto
[1:36:55] the father but by me
[1:36:57] he showed evidence of his kingdom and
[1:37:01] raised that person from the dead he
[1:37:03] showed evidence of the kingdom when he
[1:37:05] raised Lazarus
[1:37:07] every miracle
[1:37:09] that he went through was trying to prove
[1:37:13] the evidence
[1:37:16] of the Kingdom
[1:37:19] that it exists
[1:37:22] that it's real
[1:37:27] that is life
[1:37:30] so the kingdom exists
[1:37:35] the scripture tells us
[1:37:38] I believe if we would read it in first
[1:37:41] John
[1:37:42] 2 and 15. I'm going to close quickly now
[1:38:04] listen what he said
[1:38:08] love not the world
[1:38:10] neither the things that are in the world
[1:38:14] If any man loved the world the love of
[1:38:18] the father
[1:38:19] is not in him
[1:38:21] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:38:25] the flesh the Lusk of the eyes the pride
[1:38:28] of life is not of the father but is of
[1:38:33] the
[1:38:35] world
[1:38:37] the world passeth away
[1:38:43] and the lust thereof and he that does
[1:38:47] the will of the father
[1:38:49] abideth for
[1:38:52] ever
[1:38:55] what is the world
[1:38:58] and the things of the world
[1:39:03] have you ever thought really and
[1:39:05] understood what is the world or the
[1:39:08] things of the world why is he telling us
[1:39:11] seek first the kingdom of God and all
[1:39:14] these things other things will be added
[1:39:15] unto you take no thought for your
[1:39:18] clothes take no thought for this take no
[1:39:20] thought for that don't get caught up in
[1:39:22] that thinking don't get caught up in
[1:39:25] that way of life be content in whatever
[1:39:27] state you are seek ye first the kingdom
[1:39:30] of God and its righteousness
[1:39:35] so what
[1:39:37] the prophet had brought brought out he
[1:39:39] said that this Young Rich ruler
[1:39:41] came up
[1:39:43] he saw the kingdom that Jesus was
[1:39:45] preaching
[1:39:47] and he wanted to be a partner
[1:39:50] in it
[1:39:52] he wanted to have some of it he wanted a
[1:39:56] possession
[1:39:57] but when it came time
[1:40:01] to pay the price
[1:40:05] to get that kind of power
[1:40:09] oh my
[1:40:12] God to get that kind of a spirit
[1:40:16] that Jesus possessed
[1:40:19] in other words for him to have the same
[1:40:22] spirit that Jesus did the same mind the
[1:40:26] same attitude the same approach the same
[1:40:30] freedom
[1:40:34] Jesus didn't have to go to the cross
[1:40:37] he went to the cross for you
[1:40:40] to make an entrance the Bible says into
[1:40:45] the Glorious kingdom of God he went
[1:40:48] there so you could leave the world
[1:40:52] and the things of the world and come
[1:40:55] into a spiritual life
[1:40:59] and a possession
[1:41:03] let me say that again a possession
[1:41:08] of something that would allow you to
[1:41:12] have no thought
[1:41:14] right of what tomorrow holds
[1:41:18] no thought about your retirement
[1:41:24] no thought about your bank account
[1:41:27] no thought of your survival
[1:41:32] or the things of the world
[1:41:40] Jesus said because I live
[1:41:43] you shall live also
[1:41:47] what are the prophets oh man if he gains
[1:41:49] the whole world and loses his soul
[1:41:56] this guy wanted all that
[1:42:00] but he didn't want to pay the price
[1:42:10] now
[1:42:13] and I had a bunch of quotes but I'm not
[1:42:15] going to read them this morning I'm
[1:42:16] going to try to close
[1:42:20] Jesus said he presented
[1:42:23] the young man
[1:42:25] an opportunity
[1:42:28] to invest
[1:42:30] in the Kingdom
[1:42:34] and that's the part that I feel this
[1:42:37] morning
[1:42:39] and I feel it for myself first
[1:42:44] and possibly if I need it then maybe
[1:42:48] possibly we all ought to consider it
[1:42:53] so it's not a judgment thing or a
[1:42:56] condemnation thing or going through the
[1:42:59] congregation and trying to seek out uh
[1:43:02] what your little problem is to cause
[1:43:06] some sort of conviction on you
[1:43:10] so that you would make some sort of
[1:43:13] emotional
[1:43:15] response of repentance
[1:43:20] that that that doesn't do any good
[1:43:24] because most people that repent
[1:43:29] are repenting for what that they've done
[1:43:33] it's a past tense movement
[1:43:39] I'm sorry I did this I sorry I did that
[1:43:42] I'm sorry I did this oh I shouldn't have
[1:43:45] done that I regret doing that I wish I
[1:43:47] never had that on my record the trouble
[1:43:49] with that type of repentance is you're
[1:43:52] really repenting for something that's
[1:43:54] already been forgiven
[1:43:59] the repentance should be
[1:44:03] for what you invested in
[1:44:08] that you put your time and your effort
[1:44:12] and your energy into the world and the
[1:44:16] things of the world
[1:44:22] this man was offered the opportunity to
[1:44:25] invest
[1:44:28] in the kingdom of God
[1:44:31] another sell what you have give it to
[1:44:33] the poor that was an investment just
[1:44:36] like that man took his money and went
[1:44:40] and bought wheat fields
[1:44:43] because the weather was good and he knew
[1:44:46] there would be a greater yield than the
[1:44:49] cost
[1:44:52] so an investment if I could just read
[1:44:55] the definition the investment is to put
[1:44:58] money time labor devote energy to an
[1:45:03] undertaking
[1:45:04] that is worthwhile and produces a
[1:45:09] prophet
[1:45:13] you invest
[1:45:15] because you believe you're going to get
[1:45:18] greater in return than what you put into
[1:45:22] it
[1:45:26] that's when investment means
[1:45:30] that you get better now look at us
[1:45:36] first of all
[1:45:38] we invest invest means to invest time
[1:45:43] I don't have a phone
[1:45:45] I have a phone but it's in my office
[1:45:49] but take somebody
[1:45:51] if I was to sit here hand me that chair
[1:45:54] right here
[1:45:55] can you hand me that chair I'd come down
[1:45:57] and get it but I want to use it because
[1:45:59] I'm getting tired
[1:46:01] and I'm old
[1:46:03] so I'm going to sit down
[1:46:06] now I got this phone here
[1:46:09] and I'm going to sit here for the next
[1:46:11] 30 minutes playing sick bird
[1:46:15] you know what sick bird is I heard about
[1:46:18] it
[1:46:20] and I guess there's what
[1:46:22] battle whackers and moon hunters and all
[1:46:26] that other thing
[1:46:28] I want you to understand
[1:46:30] video games is a terrible investment
[1:46:38] a terrible investment
[1:46:43] there's no prophet in it
[1:46:45] there's no future in it there's no
[1:46:48] return in it
[1:46:50] the next time you apply for a job right
[1:46:53] on there I reached the fifth level of
[1:46:56] Masters of the Universe
[1:47:02] that guy is going to say this guy wastes
[1:47:05] his
[1:47:07] time
[1:47:09] there is no return
[1:47:13] on his energy
[1:47:16] his time
[1:47:18] his money
[1:47:20] his devotion
[1:47:23] no return on it whatsoever wasted
[1:47:30] you don't think God
[1:47:32] mentions that
[1:47:34] people who have a talent
[1:47:37] and bury it and waste it
[1:47:43] it'll be taken from you
[1:47:46] I want you to if you could get it in
[1:47:48] your mind
[1:47:50] when you sit down there at that computer
[1:47:52] and and do all those things
[1:47:57] that is a terrible
[1:48:00] terrible terrible worthless investment
[1:48:10] what do you put your time into just tell
[1:48:13] me what's the return
[1:48:17] I don't know I know none of you guys up
[1:48:19] here spend time on your cell phones
[1:48:22] you're smarter than that
[1:48:24] but can anybody tell me what the re
[1:48:27] return is on Battle Warriors of America
[1:48:34] if you complete the game
[1:48:40] you mean you could nobody because I'm I
[1:48:42] wouldn't hope any of you wouldn't be
[1:48:44] able to
[1:48:45] but it's the thought of it
[1:48:50] can you imagine all the effort
[1:48:54] that's put forth
[1:48:58] all the money and time that's put forth
[1:49:02] into something that's going to fail
[1:49:05] Heaven and Earth
[1:49:07] will pass away
[1:49:10] but my kingdom Jesus says is Everlasting
[1:49:14] I'm preaching an everlasting Kingdom
[1:49:19] now this Kingdom that we're talking
[1:49:22] about is a power
[1:49:26] hey man
[1:49:28] go in the upper room
[1:49:31] and Terry there until you are endued
[1:49:35] with power from on high
[1:49:41] that's the kingdom
[1:49:44] the kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You
[1:49:50] let me just read a few statements in
[1:49:54] and I I won't be long
[1:49:59] foreign
[1:49:59] there's not one more sign done until
[1:50:03] Sodom was burned the last thing that the
[1:50:07] church is going to see is Christ
[1:50:09] manifested in his power in fullness in
[1:50:14] his church just before the fire falls
[1:50:21] now God's kingdom is net this is
[1:50:24] paragraph 132 out of Investments
[1:50:28] preached in a
[1:50:35] ugust 3rd 1963.
[1:50:39] now the kingdom of God is never of the
[1:50:42] world
[1:50:43] no matter how many intellectual men you
[1:50:46] can stand up
[1:50:48] I'm not condemning those people
[1:50:51] but I'm trying to show you a trick that
[1:50:54] Satan has done
[1:50:57] they cannot I don't care how big
[1:51:01] your Pentecostals you Oneness
[1:51:04] all once
[1:51:06] the threeness to unite with you
[1:51:10] you and the threeness once the Oneness
[1:51:13] and the Church of God and so forth to
[1:51:15] unite with your
[1:51:18] 31 odd organizations become one you
[1:51:22] Methodist Baptist and so forth the same
[1:51:25] way
[1:51:28] the economical Council
[1:51:30] that's just meeting over there this week
[1:51:33] to discuss the problems
[1:51:36] they're all wanting to unite in one
[1:51:40] and they'll do it the Bible says they'll
[1:51:42] do it make an image unto the Beast
[1:51:46] you see where the very background comes
[1:51:49] from a beast is a power
[1:51:52] and it will be a power but it will be
[1:51:56] the wrong power now I want you to
[1:51:58] understand the the whole thing of this
[1:52:01] world
[1:52:02] through education is to give you power
[1:52:05] to be able to make more money and
[1:52:09] survive and have a better life in this
[1:52:12] world
[1:52:15] what are the things of the world the
[1:52:18] things that the world has to offer all
[1:52:21] their inventions all their Easy Living
[1:52:24] all their comfortable underwear
[1:52:29] I've never heard so many advertisements
[1:52:31] about comfortable underwear
[1:52:36] boy
[1:52:37] I just got to go out and pay 45 dollars
[1:52:41] for a pair of comfortable undies
[1:52:44] give me a break that ain't a good
[1:52:47] investment
[1:52:50] not when you didn't buy Fruit of the
[1:52:52] Loom for for 12.
[1:52:59] what kind of sales pitch
[1:53:05] did you fall for
[1:53:09] you've been sucked
[1:53:12] into the world
[1:53:15] and the things of the world all the
[1:53:18] things the world has to offer to make
[1:53:21] you think you're better to think you're
[1:53:23] prettier to think you're more
[1:53:25] comfortable to think you're going to be
[1:53:27] more successful the success of a
[1:53:30] Christian is the rapture
[1:53:33] [Applause]
[1:53:37] they're gobbling us up
[1:53:41] they're gobbling us up by trying to get
[1:53:45] us to keep up
[1:53:49] remember
[1:53:50] Satan's wiser
[1:53:53] than the Sheep
[1:53:57] he's more crafty
[1:54:01] everything's greater bigger higher
[1:54:04] Society more comfortable more easier
[1:54:06] well got to have this got to have got to
[1:54:09] have that
[1:54:13] you know everything's a big event go
[1:54:16] down spend all kinds of money
[1:54:18] on game tickets
[1:54:23] I forget what event it was
[1:54:27] that was coming to town
[1:54:29] the ticket started a thousand dollars
[1:54:34] a thousand bucks
[1:54:38] that's a lot of money
[1:54:41] and you got a 50 50 chance you paid for
[1:54:44] the loser
[1:54:46] yeah
[1:54:48] I would rather put my money on a winner
[1:54:52] right
[1:54:54] I'd rather feed the poor
[1:54:57] I'd rather help the father and the Widow
[1:54:59] Widow in their affliction
[1:55:03] right I'd rather go the extra mile and
[1:55:07] turn the other cheat but we've been
[1:55:09] sucked in
[1:55:11] to investing in the world and the things
[1:55:15] of the world
[1:55:17] I should take a whole sermon going
[1:55:20] through all the things of the world that
[1:55:24] are worldly Earthly things
[1:55:30] I thought oh I think I'll drive a new
[1:55:32] pickup truck
[1:55:34] yeah so I go we're not going to look at
[1:55:35] a pickup truck here's the pickup truck I
[1:55:37] want to pick up a truck just like the
[1:55:39] one I got out there mines is several
[1:55:41] years old it's a 2015. it's heavy still
[1:55:46] looks good still runs good what's the
[1:55:49] bottom line I don't need a new pickup
[1:55:54] I don't need heated seats
[1:55:56] I don't need something that just comes
[1:55:58] up and picks me up puts me in the seat I
[1:56:02] sat down in the seat it moves right up
[1:56:04] to where I need to be
[1:56:07] right all the mirrors adjust just right
[1:56:12] and I don't even have to turn a key
[1:56:15] boom
[1:56:19] do I have to be aware what's around me
[1:56:21] no
[1:56:22] because it's got a beeper for this side
[1:56:24] a beeper for that side in fact I don't
[1:56:27] even have to parallel
[1:56:30] Park
[1:56:32] I just pull up and say Park me
[1:56:36] and it says
[1:56:39] Yes master
[1:56:43] and it goes you you
[1:56:49] so I'm going to give up all my ability
[1:56:54] and I'm going to lend all my
[1:56:56] coordination all my thinking to this
[1:56:59] machine
[1:57:02] that is now going to take over my life
[1:57:05] and make my life simple
[1:57:09] I like it
[1:57:12] it's ninety thousand dollars
[1:57:16] I don't like it
[1:57:21] because I'm not going to invest
[1:57:25] and put my money
[1:57:27] ninety thousand dollars in something
[1:57:30] that some fool out there I shouldn't
[1:57:32] call them fools that some person that's
[1:57:35] not paying any attention to can smash
[1:57:37] into
[1:57:42] that ain't wise
[1:57:46] I'm trying to just bring a point this
[1:57:49] morning
[1:57:50] the appoint is investing
[1:57:54] listen to what he says here
[1:57:57] he says Jesus said his kingdom was not
[1:58:00] of this world
[1:58:01] he said is my he said if it was his
[1:58:05] kingdom his disciples would fight but he
[1:58:09] said my kingdom is of above the kingdom
[1:58:13] of God is not an organization that can
[1:58:16] make great things it's the power of God
[1:58:20] the holy spirit in the human life
[1:58:26] that's what the kingdom of God is so
[1:58:30] what I'm trying to say this morning if
[1:58:32] we want more of the kingdom of God
[1:58:37] more of the power of God how many wants
[1:58:40] more the kingdom of God and more of the
[1:58:42] power of God
[1:58:45] how many wants to be more spiritual
[1:58:49] to be able to discern between Good and
[1:58:53] Evil
[1:58:54] to be able to recognize the world and
[1:58:58] its sales pitch
[1:59:02] now if you want that
[1:59:06] you've got to invest
[1:59:12] you've got to invest in the kingdom of
[1:59:17] God
[1:59:20] just back to my carnal example
[1:59:23] instead of sitting there
[1:59:26] trying to have this little man
[1:59:29] jump through loops and jump onto
[1:59:33] walkways and do all this stuff and the
[1:59:37] whole game is designed for you to fail
[1:59:43] and for you to labor and labor and labor
[1:59:46] and labor and work and work and think
[1:59:48] until you can get this little stupid
[1:59:51] thing on the screen
[1:59:54] that doesn't exist in reality
[1:59:59] to make a jump
[2:00:04] you don't think God's Gonna judge you
[2:00:07] for wasting your mind and your time on
[2:00:12] such junk as that
[2:00:18] yeah
[2:00:19] let alone all the other stuff we do
[2:00:22] I'm preaching it myself
[2:00:25] I realize I invest a whole lot of time a
[2:00:30] whole lot of thought in a whole lot of
[2:00:32] energy in things that profit nothing
[2:00:42] it wouldn't matter what kind of
[2:00:44] beautiful mansion that I built
[2:00:49] I can tell you the end of that mansion
[2:00:55] can you imagine a builder saying I built
[2:00:59] this mansion
[2:01:00] and it'll withstand the fires of hell
[2:01:04] by this mansion
[2:01:07] and it'll survive the end of the world
[2:01:12] no it won't
[2:01:14] they built a boat
[2:01:17] that God couldn't sink
[2:01:21] and it just ran into an ice cube
[2:01:26] and when blue
[2:01:30] they built their Invincible thing didn't
[2:01:33] they
[2:01:34] we're gonna go to the moon and we're
[2:01:36] going to escape this dying Earth
[2:01:40] you don't think the judgment's of God
[2:01:42] follow
[2:01:44] Jesus said if light is in you
[2:01:47] then great is that light and darkness is
[2:01:50] in you you know what they do if they
[2:01:52] went up to the Moon
[2:01:54] they'd start killing one another they'd
[2:01:56] start robbing one another they stopped
[2:01:59] stealing one another they would try to
[2:02:01] outdo one another
[2:02:04] why do we want to invest
[2:02:07] and put our time and put our effort and
[2:02:10] put our money
[2:02:13] into stuff that's going to fail
[2:02:18] we had a sign in our day
[2:02:23] we had the sign of Malachi 4 5. Luke 17
[2:02:27] 30 Revelations 10 7. we had one come in
[2:02:31] our generation turn this back to the
[2:02:33] audience discern the thoughts and
[2:02:35] intents of the heart prophesy to us what
[2:02:38] was coming the immorality the
[2:02:41] destruction what lady you'll see was
[2:02:44] going to turn into we've had every
[2:02:46] evidence that the kingdom of God exists
[2:02:50] and it's the holy spirit in you in power
[2:02:58] do you want the holy spirit in you in
[2:03:01] power
[2:03:02] to overcome the world
[2:03:06] power to speak your food into existence
[2:03:08] if there's none to be had
[2:03:15] are you willing to invest in that
[2:03:17] Kingdom
[2:03:21] are you willing to listen to a tape
[2:03:23] instead of play Mario Brothers
[2:03:26] are you willing to read your Bible
[2:03:31] instead of watching a movie
[2:03:35] are you willing to forgive somebody
[2:03:40] instead of the joy that you get
[2:03:43] thinking evil thoughts
[2:03:46] well some people just love to be mad
[2:03:50] they love to gossip
[2:03:53] they love to have a pity party
[2:03:58] they'll say things to people that are so
[2:04:00] hurtful
[2:04:02] that they don't even realize how hurtful
[2:04:04] it is
[2:04:07] but they can't control their tongue
[2:04:12] would you like to invest
[2:04:14] in bridling your tongue the tongues and
[2:04:17] unruly member
[2:04:20] and bitter and sweet can't come from the
[2:04:22] same Fountain people's tongues have got
[2:04:25] them in more trouble and more heartache
[2:04:27] been done more damage and cause more
[2:04:30] hurt feelings
[2:04:32] you know we can play all we want
[2:04:35] that were elected and we're the ones
[2:04:38] that's going
[2:04:42] but if you haven't invested in the
[2:04:46] Kingdom you have no representation there
[2:04:49] the kingdom of God is not in word the
[2:04:53] kingdom of God is not you saying that
[2:04:57] you're elect it's not you saying you're
[2:05:00] the bride it's not you saying you
[2:05:02] believe Satan believed this message and
[2:05:05] he fears and tremble your belief and the
[2:05:08] confession of your tongue amounts to
[2:05:11] nothing
[2:05:13] show me where you put your time
[2:05:16] show me where you put your money show me
[2:05:19] where you put your energy show me what
[2:05:21] you've done for the kingdom of God show
[2:05:24] me by your Works what you believe
[2:05:30] no everybody's skating
[2:05:36] they love to hear about the kingdom
[2:05:41] but they won't give a buck
[2:05:43] they won't give an hour
[2:05:46] they won't give a minute they won't give
[2:05:49] a prayer and they won't do any research
[2:05:54] Paul told Timothy
[2:05:56] study
[2:05:58] to show yourself approved
[2:06:03] that men might know
[2:06:05] what is the hope of your salvation
[2:06:10] so I'm I'm I'm saying it in this
[2:06:13] dramatic manner
[2:06:15] because I've come to understand
[2:06:17] something
[2:06:20] that faith is more than just the
[2:06:24] confession of the mouth
[2:06:27] faith is where that what you invest in
[2:06:34] if you want the power
[2:06:37] of the Resurrection
[2:06:40] if you don't have the Holy Spirit
[2:06:44] then I ask are you investing to get it
[2:06:48] are you praying
[2:06:51] maybe fasting
[2:06:54] maybe turning every stone
[2:06:57] going back and making things right in
[2:06:59] your life
[2:07:01] maybe go out and do a good work and help
[2:07:05] somebody
[2:07:10] there's givers and there's receivers
[2:07:14] there's askers and there's suppliers
[2:07:18] what do you want to be
[2:07:20] I know for a fact you can out give God
[2:07:24] said You cast your two mites
[2:07:29] he'll take care of you
[2:07:31] you can't out give God all you that are
[2:07:35] holding on and pinching your penny
[2:07:39] you're deceiving yourself
[2:07:45] I remember I had an opportunity one time
[2:07:47] they needed a road cut I was working as
[2:07:49] a chainsaw man
[2:07:51] and I could go out and cut this road
[2:07:56] take me six hours
[2:07:58] they're gonna pay me three thousand
[2:08:00] dollars
[2:08:02] now three thousand dollars and nineteen
[2:08:06] and seventy two
[2:08:08] was a good lick of change
[2:08:12] probably equivalent to thirty thousand
[2:08:14] dollars today or more
[2:08:17] but I had to do it on Sunday morning
[2:08:24] I had a choice to make
[2:08:27] oh I went through the Mind battle oh
[2:08:30] their Ox is in the ditch
[2:08:33] this would be a good
[2:08:35] a good testimony
[2:08:39] that I went out and did that for him
[2:08:43] but the word said
[2:08:46] the prophet said I read it he don't work
[2:08:49] on Sunday
[2:08:51] now some of you might have jobs you work
[2:08:53] on Sunday that's fine if you're a nurse
[2:08:55] maybe something like that maybe you have
[2:08:57] sift James but I do everything in my
[2:09:00] power to get out of it
[2:09:05] I'd go talk to your boss I would tell
[2:09:07] him I go to church on Sunday morning I
[2:09:10] give that time for the resurrection I
[2:09:12] can come in at six or I can come in at
[2:09:14] seven but I'd make some sort of
[2:09:17] sacrifice
[2:09:19] but you know what the problem with that
[2:09:21] rich young River was he didn't want to
[2:09:23] make the sacrifice that's what the
[2:09:25] prophet of God said when you go back and
[2:09:27] read this message he says they all
[2:09:30] believe in God
[2:09:31] but they don't want to separate
[2:09:33] themselves from the world they all
[2:09:35] believe in God and they want the power
[2:09:37] of God but they don't want to sacrifice
[2:09:43] they don't want to invest
[2:09:48] and if you don't continue to invest
[2:09:52] eventually your inflation
[2:09:57] get your investment
[2:10:00] if you're trying to run on the Holy
[2:10:03] Ghost you've got
[2:10:04] yesterday
[2:10:06] the evil of tomorrow
[2:10:09] is greater
[2:10:11] than what you have
[2:10:14] if you only got them you only put a
[2:10:17] gallon of gas in your spiritual tank
[2:10:21] you can only go so far
[2:10:25] and it runs out
[2:10:28] my truck sitting in my driveway this
[2:10:31] morning I took Leslie's car because I
[2:10:33] ran it down to where it said I got one
[2:10:36] mile till empty
[2:10:42] why
[2:10:44] I was too busy
[2:10:47] to invest
[2:10:50] in the time it took to put gas in my
[2:10:53] tank
[2:10:55] and now it's sitting there
[2:10:58] worthless
[2:11:07] this kingdom is real
[2:11:10] and this power is real
[2:11:14] but you're not going to receive the
[2:11:16] dividends of it without the investing in
[2:11:19] it
[2:11:21] you're not going to grow without reading
[2:11:24] more you're not going to grow without
[2:11:26] praying more you're not going to grow
[2:11:29] without studying anymore
[2:11:31] you can't just go on what you had
[2:11:35] yesterday
[2:11:38] the Hill's going to get steeper it's
[2:11:41] going to take more horsepower or
[2:11:44] spiritual power or white horsepower let
[2:11:47] me say it that way
[2:11:51] Lord of Lord in Kings of Kings it's
[2:11:54] going to take investing
[2:11:57] in the spiritual things
[2:11:59] to grow into rapturing conditions
[2:12:05] we're preaching way too much
[2:12:08] that it's just a big old gift from God
[2:12:10] that we don't have to do nothing
[2:12:14] that's not what he said
[2:12:17] he said go wait there and Tarry
[2:12:21] go there and invest your time your
[2:12:24] prayer you're thinking and I will Indo
[2:12:28] you with power from on high and then
[2:12:30] when they got that power he said go into
[2:12:33] all the world preach the gospel Lay Your
[2:12:37] Hands on the sick preach the repentance
[2:12:39] from sin
[2:12:43] another you got the power invest it
[2:12:48] put it into something worthwhile that it
[2:12:51] might grow
[2:12:55] how would you let your whole Christian
[2:12:57] existence you get up there and he says
[2:13:00] what do you have to show for the power I
[2:13:03] give you
[2:13:05] me
[2:13:09] not one convert
[2:13:11] not one witness
[2:13:13] not one prayed for the sick
[2:13:16] not one person counseled and loved or
[2:13:20] anything
[2:13:23] you just thought what you had was good
[2:13:26] enough
[2:13:31] and he's going to ask where's the return
[2:13:34] on the talent
[2:13:36] it would have been better if you would
[2:13:39] have invested it
[2:13:41] so I'm telling you church this morning
[2:13:44] and I'm taking this to myself
[2:13:49] yes we're elect
[2:13:52] yes were his chosen yes he did all these
[2:13:56] things yes he gave us power
[2:14:03] but he wants us to invest it
[2:14:08] that's a whole nother part of the true
[2:14:10] Gospel of God
[2:14:12] he wants you to take what you've given
[2:14:15] it's been freely given
[2:14:19] freely give
[2:14:24] he wants you to invest
[2:14:28] in the kingdom of God
[2:14:30] seek ye first the kingdom of God all the
[2:14:34] world he will take care of so Lord
[2:14:37] richly bless you and maybe it took me a
[2:14:40] long time to say that because I really
[2:14:43] didn't want to say it
[2:14:45] because everybody's happy with just
[2:14:48] being told you're going to be there
[2:14:50] regardless
[2:14:55] will you be lost
[2:14:57] maybe not
[2:14:59] the scripture says watch how you build
[2:15:02] and what you there build on because if
[2:15:05] you're not you'll be destroyed by
[2:15:08] fire
[2:15:10] your Works will be consumed by fire
[2:15:14] that you might be saved
[2:15:17] I'm saying let's be wise
[2:15:21] let's be wise as serpents and harmless
[2:15:24] of gods let us invest in the kingdom of
[2:15:28] God let us understand what the kingdom
[2:15:31] of God is let us ask for discernment of
[2:15:34] what the world is I shouldn't have to
[2:15:36] sit up here and explain to you what the
[2:15:38] world is and things of the world
[2:15:40] anything that's contrary to the word of
[2:15:42] God's Antichrist
[2:15:45] let's do what's right
[2:15:48] let's actually realize there's existence
[2:15:51] Kingdom we've seen the evidence we know
[2:15:54] that it's real the opportunity has been
[2:15:57] given to us to invest in it that we
[2:15:59] might receive the benefits no investing
[2:16:03] no benefits
[2:16:06] end the story
[2:16:10] I'm afraid we're getting close to
[2:16:12] Running on Empty
[2:16:17] we've used up all of our knowledge we've
[2:16:20] used up all of our Revelation we've used
[2:16:23] up everything we've got we've used up
[2:16:25] all the padding on the the backs of one
[2:16:28] another we can done I got quotes in here
[2:16:31] what he talks about
[2:16:33] it's unbelievable
[2:16:36] we've used all that up it's time we
[2:16:39] start filling our tanks again
[2:16:41] so we can make the rest of the journey
[2:16:43] and God bless you this morning brother
