Description:
Sunday Morning

August 6, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] foreign I'm looking forward to What the Lord Has in the store we just want to invite brother Mike at this time to open our service in prayer let's all just stand and how many's come with an expectation this morning amen I know that our Lord will not only meet your expectation but he'll go above and beyond so let's just enter into prayer with them brother Mike to open the service and then we'll go right into our song reading and you can be seated after after the prayer God bless you let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus once again we're just grateful for the opportunity to come into your presence father Lord we just depend upon that promise that we're two or three are gathered in your name that you'll be in the midst Lord and you've put us under your name you've called us by Your Name Lord which means that you're present when we're gathered together in your name and father we are looking forward to you to to speak to us to move on hearts Lord we're here to worship you and to lift you up Lord we pray that you would be magnified and glorified and that your word would be lifted up and that no not be the efforts of man or that we would look to the abilities or the words of man but father that we would depend upon your presence Lord we all brought needs before you Lord and you bring Promises to the service Lord we look forward to the work that you're going to do we commit the service to you we ask for you to have your way we ask for you to speak to each one of us Lord meet every need Lord draw us closer to you we pray in Jesus name amen I'm going to be seated just a minute it's uh I was reading this week and you know as an old man toward the end of his life David wrote a wonderful promise in psalm 37. verse 23 it says the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand I have been Young and now IM old yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed Betty begging bread you know I think there's such a comfort in that promise you know something David was able to share after a lifetime of walking with the Lord but it wasn't always easy you know it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows and great victories you know he had a hard life he had struggles he had battles to fight and some he lost he had very difficult experiences and circumstances to go through but this was his this was his testimony at the end of the journey you know as we look at Psalm 6 this morning you know this is one of those examples where you see David at a spot where he's calling out to the Lord for his assistance in a time of struggle time of great trial and you know as you read it your initial reaction is well this is kind of a bummer wow you know but you know he at the time he wrote this he was under great pressure there was something that was such a burden to him and such a struggle for him that you know he he was crying out to the Lord and what's interesting is we may not know the specific circumstances that he was that he was in but it was one of those things that got him to such a place where he called out in verse one and two began to wonder if the Lord was angry with him or if the Lord was punishing him in some way you know and I suppose at some point in time each of us find ourselves in a spot like that you know much of the chapter is about David crying out to the Lord seeking his relief seeking his deliverance and in an hour where he was in great need but you know it struck me as I read this that it doesn't matter what David's circumstance was yeah it was hard it was a struggle it was pressure but it never tells us what the problem was the detail of his struggle it didn't matter what remained from the circumstance was the word that was spoken as a result of the event you know every circumstance every trial every burden caused some word to come forth out of this son of God and that's what stood not the details of the trial remember David's testimony at the end of The Journey the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord he delighteth in his way though he fall he will not be utterly cast down the promise of Psalm 37 was a result of his experience in psalm 6. you know as job said job by the way was one who God said there was none like him in all the Earth but job said it this way in verse chapter 23 verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold you know there's a shine there's a sound there's a voice there's a word that comes forth from one as a result of a trial but you know as we read Psalm 6 . it occurred to me as I was reading this that the kind of trial the kind of challenge that he was dealing with at that time is not really what you might think it might be you know very often we'll focus on the really big challenges the really big burdens of Life those things that are life-changing those things that are heavy loads and but you know as David was crying out to the Lord he used an interesting expression here in chapter six he used it several times to describe the situation the circumstance he was in in verse 2 heal me for my bones are vexed and in verse 3 my soul is sore vexed but thou O Lord how long he's vexed his bones are vexed his soul is vexed it's not a word that's used all that often in the scriptures it's used a few times but it's used multiple times here in this chapter and I got to thinking that's such an unusual word what does that even mean really you know it comes from a Latin word which means to disturb but if you look it up in the dictionary this is the words that it uses to Define vexed to feel annoyed frustrated or worried especially with trivial matters and I got to thinking about that and trivial matters things that don't matter to be vexed is to be frustrated annoyed worried by the little things that just don't matter the constant demand the constant pressure of having trivial things the things that don't matter pecking away at us day and night the job the bills the news the politics the cost of groceries or gas the car that's in the shop again maybe it's the plumbing leak at the house the expectations of life it just saps away at our strength every day and none of it matters it vexes our bones it vexes our soul you know David speaks of it absolutely wearing him out stuff that isn't important but demands so much from him in verse 6 I am weary with my groaning all the night make I my bed to swim I water my couch with my tears this is interesting verse seven mine eye is consumed because of grief all those trivial things the things that don't matter that build up day after day after day constantly demanding our attention causing our eye to drift away from what's important and spend all our time focusing on the stuff I worked for a man once that said Mike it's just all stuff just stuff it's not important you know but all those things David calls those things his enemies in verse seven all those things that demand his attention that are trivial they mean nothing they're there to frustrate him they're there to wear him out they're there to take his eye his Focus off the main thing to Cloud his vision all those things are designed to get us to respond to their demand whether that we're rather than waiting on God you don't want to get the pressure gets to such a point where you just can't take it anymore brother Brandon preached a sermon several times letting off the pressure where it's just the constant noise of the little things that don't matter that wear us down [Music] you know a lot had a similar problem where his righteous Soul was vexed by the things that he saw and had to deal with every day that same word was used vexed it's that pressure and every bit of it contrary to the word of God but you know as I was reading this chapter you know David finally gets to the place and finds the remedy that we all have to find in verse 9 the Lord hath heard my supplication the Lord will receive my prayer you know as brother Paul preached Wednesday night you know I so enjoyed that if you they weren't here please listen to the recording of that it's it's the remedy for this exhausting stream of demands of life the trivial things that ultimately don't matter you know Solomon said this in Proverbs 3 trust in the Lord with all thine heart oh having a heart for nothing else just trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thine own understanding don't rely on how things appear to you don't try to figure it out in all thy ways in every way acknowledge Him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise and thy own eyes don't think you can figure it out don't even try fear the lord and depart from evil you know what's interesting about that passage in Proverbs 3 is after you go through all that verse 8 says this it's the remedy for vexed bones it shall be held to thy navel and Marrow to thy bones you know so as I was reading that we can go ahead and stand we're going to read this little Psalm together you know I was just reading that as David was expressing his weariness and his desperation from the constant pressure of the little things of life I thought it was a great reminder of don't don't allow ourselves to get caught up in that get frustrated by that get worn down by that look up commit your ways to him seek his face turn unto him don't try to figure it out don't try to respond to the demands it was certainly a helpful reminder to myself let's just read that chapter six together oh Lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure have mercy upon Me O Lord for I am weak O Lord Heal me for my bones are vexed my soul is also sore vexed but thou O Lord how long return O Lord deliver my soul o save me for thy Mercy's sake for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks I am weary with my groaning all the night make I my bed to swim I water my couch with my tears mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of mine enemies depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping the Lord hath heard my supplication the Lord will receive my prayer let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly amen praise the Lord amen you may have your seats I was just as we were reading that Psalm that song struck my heart I am weak but Thou Art strong I thought maybe we could just sing that because in our weakness he's strong I I so enjoyed that that's what this age is designed to do is tear you down but we've received one that builds us up and when we're weak he is strong let's just sing that um I am weak but Thou Art strong will and Jesus [Music] thank you [Music] anymore it is [Music] walking close to me [Music] deadly safe [Applause] Let It Be [Music] [Applause] this world where we live [Music] yes [Music] amen praise the Lord pray that's all of your desires amen I want to sing that song Wonderful Wonderful Jesus says to me oh my heart

that he would touch them but when is his disciples saw it they rebuked them but Jesus called them unto him and said suffer the little children that come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall the no wise enter therein amen so that's why we dedicate babies bring infants we don't baptize them that's their choice but we we pray for him amen let's sing it oh Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] amen Hallelujah I first met Suzanne in Congo she came to my hotel to introduce herself and it's been a while now at least two children ago I like to tell the story on brother Patrick because it's a tremendous testimony brother Patrick was working at a certain place I don't remember the job exactly but uh uh he was working there and his life was just crumbling around him and he was working next to a person that used to follow the message and used to be in in church but they had backslid and they were on the work and it just happened to be on the same job that Patrick was on so Patrick said looked over at him and said nah he said I'm just tired of living I think I'm just going to end my life and I can't sleep I haven't slept for days and days and I'm I'm just tormented he said I'm just gonna end in my life and the fella there backslid guy he said oh don't do that he said go see these people they have to have them pray for him and so brother Patrick came over to our house and I believe brother Billy was there interpreting I don't know if you spoke much English then did you know you've come a long way and so he couldn't even speak English and at and we prayed and for him and at peace just and I said well I said I just pray that that you can get some rest and you can sleep in this tormenting spirit will leave you and you'll want to live and so he got and Billy wanted to give him a a book so they got out and built his car and Billy reached down and grabbed a book and it was demonology so he gave it to Patrick and so we prayed for Patrick well a few weeks later I saw Patrick coming up across the parking lot and I said oh Patrick how are you doing he said Oh Brother David I just can't sleep he says I'm listening to these tapes and I don't even want to stop he thinks it's just so wonderful and the Lord really delivered him and now he's giving them a life amen and you know the prophet of God said if God could give you the best thing that he could give you besides salvation was a good wife amen so that's next in line and he gave him salvation now he gave him a good wife and and so we're going to ask the Lord to bless us today so Patrick I'm not going to hold her she looks so pretty but would you hold her up for everybody to see you want me to hold her okay huh [Music] she knows something's not right here hey amen I'll let you hold her brother Patrick as you pray for her and ask the Lord to bless her and then we'll all pray together go ahead dedicate your daughter Lord Jesus we thank you once again this morning Lord I came to present Joyce before you the blessing gift that you have given to us Lord we ask you that you will bless her maybe there'll be a blessing to us in our life Lord we ask you that she may be growing the wisdom in your path so that she can be more like you Lord Jesus we thank you for everything where her heart

the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you that's the best part of being a pastor if you at all just stay like little children then life would be so so nice amen you got it amen all right let's all stand this morning turn in our Bibles to the gospel of Saint John um the 14th chapter and we want just to read uh the first few verses of this scripture here and and then we also want to turn over to a second Timothy the second chapter of the 12th and 13th verse let not your hearts be troubled I thought brother Paul again touched on that beautiful let not your heart be troubled and that's that's our foundation this morning let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also and whether I go with ye no and the way ye know and Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto me but to the father but by me and if he had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him amen I go to prepare a place for you let's turn over the second Timothy here and and read this great a verse that is a beautiful verse starting with the 11th second Timothy the second chapter the 11th verse it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we sh shall also live with him if we suffer we shall reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated there's no way this morning that uh I have the capability whatsoever of doing any of the sermons that our Prophet preached Justice but I'd like just today to Fellowship a little round uh with you out of this sermon things that are to be now we touched on Modern events are made clear by prophecy and and we understood in in doing so and talking about those things we we talked about the way things are now and we realize the way things are now is because they were prophesied and spoken to be this way I I mean it it we understand that the battle is in the mind and Satan has raged that battle to the point that people are absolutely losing their mind their thought process no longer has any common decency about it whatsoever they just don't know how to think that so much information is coming from them so much data and things are coming to him that man's mind is just not capable of functioning in fact I think man has lost so much faith in their own mind that they have gone to an artificial intelligence they would rather trust a machine or or some Gathering of some information to come up with with something that's not even real it in order to uh find some sort of Escape it's it's a total uh lack of of mental facilities and that was prophesied to be here that there would be perilous times that come that men would be lovers of pleasure lovers lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God not wishing even to retain God in their thinking and because they don't retain God in their thinking God gives them over to a reprobate mind in other words a mind that can only produce reprobation things that are are totally uh uh just I I don't even know how to say it I can't comprehend uh what's transpiring we know that it said as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man and can and we right now are in the day of the revealing of the son of man you say no that was just when the prophet of God was here he spoke the word but there was a whole people that that hadn't even been revealed to yet it was spoken and it was manifested and Vindicated but now it's being revealed to the Sons and Daughters of God and in that day that he was revealing himself and making his word known and opening the Mysteries and feeding his flock with the storehouse in that day in that time that that would transpire that the world would absolutely be given to a reprobate mind a Sodom condition in the time and we see that condition as that Revelation grows in the bride the Sodom condition gets worse and worse it's just it's just going along that way and and so we we we recognize uh these things and uh so we we see what things are and because they've been prophesied these modern events have made have been made clear by prophecy but but now we're not only talking about things that are but the things that are to be and with that through we want to emphasize on because because of what was prophesied we see what is now so now if we can see what's prophesied then we can understand what we need and what part that we play in that and so I'd like us if this morning if I could just uh make this set so in our heart uh and if it's on my heart so much that each of us understand the the great value of our predestination who we are and and what's transferring and what's going on and recognize the day in our message and step up to the challenge step up to the challenge leave those things which are behind behind and press for that higher calling this morning we want to make the rapture Rapture Rapture Rapture it's all about the rapture so you know we we see this great scripture here and in them show us the father and and in paragraph 22 the prophet of God makes this statement he says it was easy for those Jews who have been taught through generations to believe that there was a great Supernatural God but to think that that God had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son Jesus Christ God tabernacled in a body of Flesh that was a little too much for them to understand that was then but I could say it it's the same thing today they can't quite understand God coming down and tabernacling himself in a bride God made manifest in flesh that can understand the great God and they built temples in churches they can understand a god afar off they can understand a God that that is great and powerful but what they can't understand is that God taking the form of Flesh and especially taking the form of Flesh in redeemed Sons and Daughters of God now if it's hard for a man to understand that right then you've got to realize it's hard for you to understand that that's why it gets so important to pray for revelation that you can understand that this is what God wants to do he wants to take form in flesh the bride in the bridegroom are one so that's what man couldn't understand they couldn't understand they could understand the great God that could do all things but they just can't get it into their understanding that this great God wants to come down and abide in flesh if you abide in me and I abide in you ask what you will Hallelujah father that they may be one as We Are One think of it this morning you look at yourself and you can you you look at yourself and you say oh no look there's no way that's happening but look what we just read he said if we believe not yet he abideth faithful because he can't deny himself so he can't deny what he spoke what he prophesied he can't deny it in others he said he'd have a bride he's going to have a bride so he can't deny it he will remain faithful remember he's faithful to his word Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away God is determined to bring everything that he's spoken to pass Paul was a part of that and when Paul was out persecuting the church at Ken laying Havoc with the church and all this and God has had already in his mind chosen Paul to be that first church age Messenger to bring his gospel to the Gentiles he's out fighting it total opposite of everything and all of a sudden a pill or a fire intervenes in his life and he's gets smote to the ground blind and he cries out Lord who art thou Lord he said I'm Jesus whom you're persecuting I'm going to show you the things that you have to suffer go by the Wake straight and he speaks to a prophet and they find them why God had it in his mind he'll do whatever it takes don't be not troubled Amen in my father's house are many mansions I've gone away to prepare a place for you how Mac so he's going to perform his word he can't deny himself he can't deny you if your name's on the lamb Book of Life he put it there you didn't put it there you didn't deserve to put it there you didn't get there by any other way but by predestination all he foreknew he preached the predestinated and all he predestinated he justified in all he justified he Sanctified and all that he Sanctified he glorifies amen you didn't have anything to do with it now that's good if you don't fight it right but if you fight it you're in for a real a real knock down drag out and guess who wins Hallelujah amen so we understand these things that they could see that that he was a great God but they couldn't understand them bringing the flesh and that's the same battle that we're up against today so so just a little watch as we read this this next part of that statement he said but he said now as you have believed in God believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions and I go to prepare a place for you Jesus life was fixing to end here on Earth he had showed the people and proved to them that he was Jehovah manifested in flesh by the great signs and wonders and the references of the Bible that he had referred to to himself and he proved that he was God manifested oh I hope you can read into that statement for our days and he said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose I am going away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also therefore Jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not the end ended in death wow now that something to take into consideration isn't it and he wants us to take it into consideration just follow with me just a little bit and I'll try to move as fast as I can he says down here in a little bit he said now but he was telling them that after death there is life because I go to prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there that he was speaking to them that there was a life after this life is ended so he can't go to prepare a place for you if he's not going to take you there he can't deny himself he is the word now he told us don't let your hearts be troubled in my father's house are many mansions I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also so by telling us that he's telling us what will be well just like we see by the modern events made clear by prophecy prophecy spoke of where we're at now therefore prophecy spoke for where we're at now and that has come to pass because then walk with him telling what things that will be will also come to pass in other words God's word can't fail it won't return void so where we were wanting you to pick up this morning and let's follow this through because he's really trying to get something deep in our heart here and I would really trust that each of you could maybe if you prayed about it go back and and listen to this uh message he said okay he said and what a consolation that ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into what a consolation amen he said and as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawn close then it began begins to to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it's now it's a continuing of this same life in another world another place Hallelujah as you see that day approaching you pack up and you get closer and you prepared but if you keep putting that scene that day afar off then you keep putting your preparation afar off you are you always think that uh I've got time I've got time I've got time but you actually and I can't go into all this teaching this morning but just to say this to you you are living in a time where times no more you understand this says quickening time the word of God is coming forth and it's quickening it's bringing to life the seed of God it ain't no great big time thing you know what I mean we're at the end the last word has been given the resurrection word has been given the transformation word has been given the quickening word has been given and that word is now going out performing exactly what it was preached to do and it's manifesting so you can't keep you can't keep pushing this down the road in fact he tells us he says there'll be many many a young person as we heard this morning in our prayer request our brother Jay just lost his younger brother Jay's not an old man many of people have passed away I've Had The Misfortune of of of of doing funerals for young children of course I know where they're gone but there's one thing that we're certain of one thing only God's word will come to pass he said I've gone away to prepare a place for you and I will come again and receive you and we know we're in that time we know that he's come now in our generation he's come veiled himself in the ministry of the son of man which was none other than the Lord Jesus Christ veiled in a son of man which means a prophet it was him veiled in a prophet standing there you would look up and see William Branham and yes that looked like brother Branham brother Branham but what was transforming in here what was coming out of him the works that he was doing were not the works of brother Branham it was the work of the Lord Jesus Christ revealing himself through the ministry of a son of man showing that he had come back and returned back to receive his bride that where he is we may be also hearing is the love of God made perfect that as he is so are we in this world we're not in a light situation we're in a serious situation but praise God God's given us a peace that's her path that's understanding and he's given us joy unspeakable full of Glory to go with us as we make this journey so we we we understand that we're we're here that that that he's done that because this was the time that that he's chosen to reveal himself and to gather his bride up and to have an invisible Union with her that they can be one and that if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body so I I don't know how long things can go on I I I I I know now there's a lot of things going on in our country in this United States of America that it's divided and and people are there the law they're trying to change the law and change things where people don't have the freedom to speak like they used to have they they want to they want to now determine that if you say something that and it causes a reaction that that can be a crime believe me they want to take the ability for me to stand here and preach that that a person that's under the demon possession of homosexuality can be totally delivered by the healing power of God we know that people go through stages you know but but God matures it sometimes we used to come like tomboys or something you know you see a little girl climb a tree or or or maybe you want to swing a baseball bat you don't all of a sudden go oh turn her into a boy you understand God's got a course for all those things those things work out the word of God Satan's the author of confusion when you start hearing gender confusion what does that tell you tells you there's a devil speaking somewhere and you know what sets you free from confusion the truth sets you free the true gospel not every person's the same right but don't alter God who by taking thought can add one cubic to their statue and now they want to take thought I'll tell you that's ignoramicism that is the highest level but what does that tell you it tells you the hour of our deliverance is approaching look up for your Redemption draws nigh this is your great comfort our great comfort is not in what things are now but our comfort is and what things are to be that's what we're looking forward to it I'm just a pilgrim here I'm just traveling through I've got no earthly home but I've Got a Mansion Over Yonder amen so let's just as we read on he says he was telling there was life after death now listen to this as we go through talking about God not being able to deny himself your birth here was pre-planned I don't ever think no matter what way you came or where you came who you came through your birth here was pre-planned God that's the word of God that's right that's right I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here come on okay that's because you have got something to fulfill it right he pre-planned it he cannot deny himself oh and I went out this morning that we would see the word of God plainly and get on board quit letting Satan divert us to all other options and confusions and Roads and and decisions that our heart would be set on one pure decision I'm going to make the rapture [Music] thank you am I hearing things okay I'm okay everybody else is insane but he said everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world that you would be here the infinite god node and to to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be on earth and how many times it would bat its eye that's infinite see you you are little Minds cannot fathom that infinite what infinite means the infinite God who knows all things therefore there's nothing out of cater not even in the I thought as our brother brought out not even in the challenges of your own life what he's what you're going through that that's to mature you right if you suffer with them you'll reign with him If you deny him he'll deny you but if you are having trouble believing he remains faithful to you why because it's not based on your ability to create belief it's based on Revelations and if you go through a dry time you go through a confusion time if you believe God he remains faithful and he will give you the Revelation to clear up your question [Music] if you believe in God also believe in me stay true God speaks in his own time he'll take care of it he'll throw everything out there you don't know why you are where you are but he does and you have not and you are incapable of changing what God has predestinated for your life even that preacher that decided he was just going to give it all up and went and got a bunch of things he's going to sit down at his church and get hung God just took him home you can't mess my plan up son I'll just take you now God knows what's best he said if we know the word of God now listen to this dick is a wonderful statement now when I make this statement I I I I I don't want us to get into any negativity here or any condemnation every word of God that's spoken is given to you for life there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit in other words if you look at things in the spiritual realm there's no condemnation but if you look at the flesh the very statement I'm going to read which should be a burning light in you to throw your hands up and say praise God it'll drive you down but believe have faith without faith it's impossible to please God because their Works were not mixed with faith it profits them nothing but if you believe it God's based on faith in fact Jesus's Ministry was his own faith believing what God's word said about him if he can believe what the word said about him can't we believe what the word said about us listen to this if we know the word of God we know where we're living yeah if you don't know where you're living the word of God can show it to you a lot of people don't know where they're living what am I doing where am I at what's going on what's what's with my life I don't know is this ever going to happen for me is this ever going to happen for me you know Doug you know anyway don't get there he said if we know we know where we're living we know the hour that we're living in we know what lays ahead we see what we've passed and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his Works Through the Ages that was up to the Book of Revelation and then he promised that it that that is to come so all of his promises are true God cannot speak any word without it being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass before the foundation of the world these are things we know how many knows what's passed seven Church ages seven Messengers we know the seals have been opened do you understand that go down here just take a trip you'll run over to the Methodist Church over there and walk in there and say the Seven Seals have been opened they would know what you're talking about but you know what has happened you know Malachi Force comes he showed what that first order horse rider was what the second he showed word the Jews were at he shows what things to be we saw the opening of the seventh seal we saw the cloud come we saw all these great things we've seen what's come to pass not only have we seen what's come to pass right he says he he says we we know let me just read that again he says we know the hour we're living in do you all know the hour you're living in you're living in the day of ladyocia the closing hours of time man is going to blow himself up tell them hello for me I'm going to put a basket out there and every cell phone is going in the basket and then you can worry about it later okay have the courtesy and the respect to God to turn them things off and if you can't live without it please stay home so everybody take a moment right now get your phones and turn them off now I give you the chance if your phone's rings I'm going to have a deacon come and have you and take you outside if we can't have enough respect for the word of God and for the house of God and you think we're going to make a rapture then we might as well quit playing Church is that plain enough I mean I'll get pushed into a corner line yeah I think there's nobody that shows more grace then I shall because I need a ton of it but this isn't about this is about his house and it's about him so let us go on he said so we we know the hour we're living in we know what lays ahead receive what's passed why and the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ his Works Through the Ages right so you've seen that you've seen what he says the words come into pass now let's go on paragraph 31. you were all pre-planned by God there's a many a day I wish that God made me different but he pre-planned me to be this way all that I went through all the trials all the tribulations all those things later in this message if you go read it brother Branham talks about all that he had to go through with his father drinking and all the bottles and the skills he said it made me what I am so if you don't want to be nobody else nobody can take your place nobody can take your place amen he cannot deny himself he cannot deny you of course that's what Satan's always been trying to do is try to put some mark on you not that he would deny you but that you would deny yourself but he will can't deny himself he says we're all pre-planned nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that planned for many generations back get over it already he made you the way you are because that's the way he wants you to be he knew what you would suffer he knew your weaknesses he knew all those things he died for you he provided Grace for you let us just go on he said he says just think you at one time as I'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the bedding ground of the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you became a person expressed in the image like your father then there was Fellowship well he's trying to give a carnal understanding so you can see that you were in God in the beginning now he's expressed you we're not going to go into a lot of that this morning now the only way you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to be you have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always that's what Satan's trying to hide that was the mystery of the seventh seal that was the mystery of the opening of the seals you always were in him he cannot deny you if he pre-planned you how can he deny you how can he deny his own works of his own hands he can't do it right right he can't deny you if he that the scripture tells us that we are his workmanship in Christ Jesus for ordained unto good works that we should walk in them so all he's trying to do is through the revelation of God's word is get you to that position God is not against you if God be for you who can be against you is this devil out here who's trying to Blind us and keep us from it he always wants us to be struggling with our flesh always wants us being conflict always wants he never wants us to look over the barriers and look up to not what we are what's going on here what what things are to be and if we can look to the things that are to be then we can say that's what I am [Music] amen amen now you've created a healthy man that you're going to walk into the gun now you know where you're walking what am I walking to I'm going to get to it if you can just bear with me I'm walking to something there's something I've got to be now the prophet of God's going to take a few moments here and I'm going to try to go through it and and do my best but I'm glad you have the tape to go listen to it yourself because I can't do this Justice but he says you had to ask you to be in him always the the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there ever was even a molecule your spiritual life and in a moment brother REM is going to separate the spiritual life from the physical life are we okay sorry for cheering you out about the cell phones I can't therefore you he said expression spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there even was a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God the gene of life was already there he know it now he put it in you and you're the manifestation of that life you are not a sinner devil struggling to try to become a Christian if Satan can hit you in that battle if he can get you in that struggle with that flesh trying to overcome the flesh trying to overcome trying to become something you can't become what he made you right he's the only one that can manifest what he made and he can't deny the fact that he thought it and in order not to deny it he spoke it in order to vindicate it what he spoke came to pass so we can sit there and look at the stars the moon the everything and say God spoke this I know there's a God the gospel is written in heaven I know what's going to be because he's spoken and he can't deny me if I'm a part of him Hallelujah have faith have faith believed this morning believe you're a daughter of God believe you're a Son of God believe what he spoke about you if you believe not he still remains faithful because he can't deny himself but don't live below your god-giver and privilege when you recognize that you'll have to fight like Jacob did you'll have to wrestle with that angel you'll have to kick that devil out you'll have to possess his Gates you'll have to claim your inheritance you'll have to say you're out of here I've come to fight I'm tired of you defeating me not by Will not by might but my spirit saith the Lord amen that's all he wants to do is keep you from laying hold what you can actually say in your heart I have a mansion I've got representations my representation is in this word because he spoke it I come from God I go to God and in the meantime Satan me and you are going to fight tooth and nail you're going to try to take it away from me you tempted my Lord Jesus on the mountain you argued with him on the mountain you fought with him on the mountain he he told you to cast yourself down and what did he do he defeated them every time with the word of God it is written in my father's house are many mansions I go to prepare a place for you that where you are I am you may be also it is written and who is it written of it's written of me yes can you grab that this morning I don't care what Satan says I don't care how he's battling your mind I don't care what you've done I don't care if you're having a struggle to believe it he cannot deny he spoke it he cannot deny the Book of Life he cannot deny the names that he put on it oh Hallelujah where's my rest where's my peace my righteousness is this filthy rags but he's my righteousness let us just go on forgot where I was now you're an expression he says a gene of life that God as a Son of God now you were expressed after his word has come to you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are a son and daughter of God therefore you get what I mean you are now made you're setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate now let's I mean I got a purpose I thought I was no I won't go there I got to keep myself because I won't get through this I'll never get through this this is eternal I would just want to leave something with you that gives you Supernatural hope that you'll finally just look at that buzzard and say you are a line buzzard Wherever You Are yes sir Wherever You Are mentally physically spiritually wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes his attributes you had to be I don't hear an option here instead of saying I'm wondering if it's me instead of saying oh I'm I just don't I'm not living right just take the word and say I believe it I don't see it I don't understand it but if he said so then that's the way it is I had to be no matter where I'm at I had to be here I had to be in this spot it was all pre-planned I'm here for I'm in this spot for a purpose I don't know what it is I don't understand it but he knows we've got to change her thinking we gotta quit thinking like sinners trying to become sons of God I'm going to say this I hope it makes sense but we got to start thinking I'm a Son of God in sin and I got to get out glory to God I'm a Son of God that's not doing something right I've got to start doing right but if you will never do anything because you weren't part of the pre-planning committee God never consulted us right right which one of you counseled God how do you think I would have designed myself what the heck I would have looked like Saul he was a failure right all the Giants of the Land of Nod they were all failures right who would have designed himself a little Ruddy Shepherd boy with no Beauty in them that you would be desired God knew what he was doing he made you every trial every situation you're in he knew you would be here time to move on get over it already quit pouting quit feeling sorry for yourself why don't we just say no matter what state I am I'm going to serve God as our brother brought out the brother on the ash sheep I'm here to worship I'm here to worship praise God God's got it in control he will not lose me he will not forsake me nothing can pluck me out of the palm of hands if he's starting to work in me he'll finish it in the end I'm in good hands he's a good shepherd he'll leave the 99 to come after me Hallelujah I'm eternally secure in Christ Jesus and he goes on now if you had you had to be if you ever if you've ever got eternal life then you always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation of the world nuke that you would be here and when the work of the water the washing of the water of the word fell upon you it what it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God as you have with your Earthly father see your citizens of the Kingdom not citizens but your children Sons and Daughters of God of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwelleth in you now think of that you always had it now when are we going to believe that here's a messenger telling why because not everybody has it but I don't compare myself with everything buddy one thing is because when I hear that voice I believe it yes am I ashamed of myself yes when I listen to this tape and I hope you all sit someplace turn off all the distractions and really listen to it I didn't know how I was ever going to make it but then he made it for me he didn't say I go to prepare a place for all them he went to it's just you've got to believe church have faith change the way you think about yourself believe in yourself believe that he can take it you've got us you've got lust from me you've got gaming problems I don't care what problems you have he's a deliverer [Music] amen he said [Music] I I want to go to this little part if you'll be with me it says now then if if it was Jesus was the fullness of God had manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifested in the flesh you were here in him then [Music] have you has that ever really sunk in you say okay here I am right now I'm I'm into this I'm I'm I got a bad relationship coming I've got all this stuff you list all your problems you Heap them up but the one thing you were with him then why were you with them then because he died that the chastisement of your peace was upon him and by your stripes you are healed you were him then because he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were when you were here in him right so if you were in your father yeah right yeah yeah and your great-grandfather okay that's your fleshly being then your spiritual being had to be in your father yes who is your father the word so when he was walking then you were in him then you were in there why because you were the bride that was going to be taken out of his size the first Adam was going to become a quickening spirit who is that who is that it's you it's not somebody else it's you it's me hallelujah it's me I'm leaving here I'm going in Rapture I have another body that's been prepared for me I come from God I go to God I'm already risen because he's risen [Music] he says it here he says you were within a man when he was on Earth when when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him you were buried in him and now you are risen with him manifested attributes of God sitting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to a new life and setting Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ do you see yourself you were positioned in this age amen you were placed in this age you didn't stumble upon this message God made a way to get this message to you because what was the message he was trying to give you get over yourself for a few minutes look what I've done look what I've planned I pre-planned your life so maybe you're sitting here you've got all kinds of problems you got everything that's all fine yeah we can have the spirit of God through the cross of Calvary you can repent of that right and if you've never been baptized you can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Ghost but the word of God said if you sin and any man that says he hasn't sinned is a liar but if you sin and you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive him amen is it so hard for us to believe he loves us he loves you he loves you so much he gave us only begotten son to come down here and die for you to pay all the praise for your sins that nothing could be laid to the charge of God's elect because the seed of God remaineth in him positionally placed the revelation that you have been positionally placed in lady osia the most ugly time there's ever been the most evil time the most deceitful age you think he would place you here if he wasn't going to provide something to take care of you right I'm going to fly now fast he's not going to leave you nor forsake you he gave his word now listen to look here's our position you've been positionally placed now listen to your position now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denomination we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride expected and what is the word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or a denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're in now we're now living my purpose all right now let's change gears can I have 30 more minutes you're really free to leave anytime if you find you got flat tires that's because we don't want you to leave is that right that's our position he says nobody else could listen he said Martin Luther could not express the attributes that were we expressed because that that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corn of wheat that fell underground nobody kind of right you have been put here to fulfill this purpose because you are part of things that are to be you are prophecy manifesting he said the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the Bible expressed it's growing in the bride the full statue it's growing in the bride this is growing in you do you understand this purpose is growing in you did you hear him say it it's growing in the bride it's starting to take hold it's starting to grow it's starting to manifest it's starting to come to the surface you see that right he says he says therefore the bride in the Rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by God all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it that's all pre-plan that's paragraph 37 sorry it's all pre-planned God knew it would be here he made it that way so that when we get there he's gone to prepare a place for us when we get there it'll be all prepared just like even this night was prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him that all tells him all these things by foreknowledge amen do you believe that now let's let this sink in don't look at your present condition look at things that are to be when you're sick if you look at your present condition what do you see sick but when you look at a well person and a healed person when you look at what's to be then you confess what's to be and God can do nothing for you till you confess it first so you see what he said I believe what he said that this would be I'm sick are you sick yeah you're sick you've got Panther yeah you can't just I don't got cancer I'm not sick that ain't faith faith is in what he said is going to happen not confessing what is faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen so you might look in the mirror you don't see no perfect person right but you know what he said about you that's what you're believing you start confessing that you start confessing that to Satan you start playing those games and all of a sudden you say wait a minute I am not going to spend my life this is not a reflection of Jesus Christ this is not a reflection of my purpose to show my neighbors To Shine the Light of the Gospel Satan has got me locked up in a room I'm in prison you're in prison you're in a mental prison playing against an artificial intelligence with a game you can never win wake up you're not called people they're all into the Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys America's team so they haven't won a playoff game don't matter don't matter their Super Bowl they're the greatest and they win the Super Bowl and then one day it's over it's all about next year next year next year you know what that is that's Forever Learning and never coming to the realization of the truth I I promised I'd close but I'm so I'm just this has got me so much he said I don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance paragraph 41. now just think when you come to this world everything had to be for prepared for you or prepared rather for you I don't hardly understand how that we could not think a God that could prepare all these good things for us we could not trust him he brought us to this chaos that we're in now and prepare the good things of life for us here how much more can he trust and prepare the things that is to come see be Eternal things it seems I say very strange did you know that God prepared everything for you just think just think about it God prepared you're coming here some of you like mountains he made mountains some like deserts he made deserts some like planes you know where you can see for mouth some like myself loved the ocean Coast I love the ocean he some like winter some like summer some like spring some like fall all that was prepared because he knew you were coming here he prepared the air that you breathe he prepared the food that you eat he prepared everything for you when you got here you are you are not living by your own strength you're living by the hand of God so you understand that and now this is what we're going to close with here this morning because we want this to set in deep he says look at your Earthly parents before you come here paragraph 44 before you come here before they knew you was coming made ready for your coming now he's given a type so you can see this just think of that now your Earthly parents which is an Earthly parent is only a type of a Heavenly parent if we knew how to give good gifts to our children how much more does our heavenly father know how to give good gifts to his children Jesus spoke they made ready you're coming they made a little crib and got a little some little booties and little clothes and so forth they made ready everything for you to arrive prepared before you even come here on Earth can you believe that now just think of that for a moment and he says on here in paragraph 49 but the father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here right he knew that you were coming he prepared everything here for you got here he prepared the gospel for you he prepared the time of your salvation for you he prepared the time of your deliverance for you it's all pre-planned he knew that when you would get here he would have an angel there to protect you he knew all those things he prepared everything for you before you even got here God already made preparations for your coming to this earth amen God can do one thing that God can't do is lie all about it he pre-planned your coming the weather the everything your life all of its all be pre-planned Generations before you got here it's all pre-planned you are not out of the plan of God you are not struggling to get into the plan of God we're letting Satan blind us we're letting the world and the love of the world blind us from the things that God has and prepared for them that love him he's looking at your weaknesses so you can't use God's power Satan does not want you to rise up he does not want you to become that Invincible Army he's keeping you by looking at yourself he's keeping you from seeing everything that he said man does not live by bread alone but by every word of the mouth of God he's he's he's he he's he's told so many lies he's built civilization he's been education Abraham didn't believe he was going to get that baby by science Abraham believed that God said so and when Abraham tried to sell his wife off as his sister God made the king repent you're a dead man what do you mean I'm a dead man he told me it was his sister I was I'm righteous you know I'm good he said you go have him pray for you figure that one out if you can figure that out you can figure say you tell me why you're saved tell me what you did tell me your Works your greatness how spiritual you are and then he comes right back around says you cannot lay anything to the charge of my elect why they had eternal life from the beginning he already wiped it clean it was all on him he said but the father he be and he prepared everything for you when you got here your first coming here he had ready for you when you got here isn't that marvelous to think of what he's done think of it now listen just for a moment now think paragraph 77. now think if God in his Mercy has a mother right and isn't that what a mother does before uh you know if if she if if he got a little something you know and the mother has a craving well why does she have that craving because the baby inside her needs something maybe a calcium maybe a vitamin or something so when the Earthly mother is fixing to prepare that baby and that baby's gonna come forth all of a sudden that mother has a craving you know oh I gotta have ice cream I've got to have this I I just just this craving for this and that and because there's some life in her that has need of something and if that life doesn't get what it has need of it won't come out right now that's in the natural as a type of the spiritual it says now now this is paragraph 76. now think how that God we should behave ourselves and act like Christians our cognit should be like Christians because we are aliens here this is not our home we are just put here temporarily we've got to go every one of us tonight oh my we gotta leave we've got to go now if you want to stay but I want to go now think God in his Mercy has a mother before a little baby is born is craving for vitamins and the mother's word speaks forth dad I want cantaloupe or watermelon I want something another it's out why he'll do everything he can to get that because he knows he wants his child born as perfect as it can be see and he'll do everything that he is able to do to get it how much more abeler is he to get it he is a creator now think how able he is to prepare for us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there is something in US calls to live and there's something in us that calls to do right then God will will call somebody to the platform or Pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why if it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone to prepare you've got to be real word bride of Christ so there's a body waiting for you your spirit's got to come into that body it can't be a deformed spirit so what happens is just follow me through you can't change what you are but what happens is we're at this time the hour that we're living right now I'm going to read it to you we're at that time where we start to hear from that body we know that he's got to prepare his plane then we are craving to be ready to get ready for that body then we said I can't act like this take it from me I can't think like this take it from me I can't go there in this condition he take provide for me the Deliverance provide for me the word how much more can he provide for you what you have need of to be prepared for that body blessed be the name of the Lord there's a call in our hearts look at just like he talks about that little boy paragraph 104. how do you look in God's mirror does it reflect a daughter or son of God is there something which you hear that does it make you hate the man that's saying it or is there something pulling saying I know that man is right because that's in the scripture then that's the vitamins needed for this body that's ordained to be there a house that the other one is going to need when you get there see this house if we have borne an Earthly image we will bore a Heavenly image you see what he's saying he's saying the reason you're calling these things because that's the vitamin this other house needs this other body needs this body needs a perfect Christian this body needs something that's without spot or wrinkle because so this body's there it's in God's mind and it's predestinated a spirit to come from this life when this body falls off into that body but it can't be deformed so what God do he sent a messenger put a man in the Pulpit to tell the truth to give the vitamins to prepare this spirit for that body do you see it he says remember we think so much of this body we put so many clothes on it we do so many things that's unnecessary change after change after change all these things oh just everybody just let somebody start something paint your steps red and watch the Joneses paint there's red do you change from a Chevy to a Ford they just can't stand it now listen it's matching time you let a woman come to church certain kind of hat on watch all the women will get that especially the pastor's wife see you just Watch What Happens now that's the truth it's absolutely the truth it's matching time brother it ought to be matching time all them all them things is for a purpose I don't care whether my clothes match my trousers I have a hard time my wife and daughter-in-law somebody will tell me what kind of tie to wear with it I don't care whether they match though I want my experience to match God's word that's the thing because that's where I aim to live not down on the corner Yonder with the Joneses but Yonder in the glory where Jesus is gone to prepare a place for me yes we want that yes sir keep from all this and these are my last statements they're not mine but they're his this old Earthly Tabernacle here you know what it is this body is like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once where but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you hang it in the closet for you've got one better you've got a better coat it's more up to date than one you used to wear that's worn out what it's that garment you are inside of that there you see this body you're in you're inside of it this ain't going because you've got a better one you're inside of this this bore the image of your Earthly what's inside of you Bears the image of your heavenly so just in the natural you start to cry so this spiritual this is matching time do you understand that so the spirit that's in this old coat is now trying to match up with the word body that's there because they they both want to become one in other words it's not this happenstance idea that you're just gonna live and then you're gonna get up there and then God's gonna make a judgment on you we're not called for that we're positioned we're placed we're revelated we know where we've been we know where we're going we know what we're doing now we understand the plan of God you understand it's matching time what's taking place the the Inside Man is crying for the vitamins that will make it fit out their body that's the time that's where we're at this morning it's matching time because it's the time to match our lives up with the word [Music] not not by strength not by my but by his spirit Lord this isn't matching send me the vitamin send me the word oh send me the Deliverance match me up it's matching time there's a promise I'm not matching up with a god match me it's matching time I want my experience to match the word god match me do it send the vitamin just like mother crave watermelon just like the Crave cantaloupe Lord my spirit's craving your word it's craving your spirit is craving your deliverance it's craving your healing because I gotta match up what's happening yeah I'm not gonna condemn myself it's like starving to death inside of a supermarket there's no need to there's there's no need for you to keep condemning yourself there's no need to keep beating yourself over your head for your filthy habit it's time to stand up and say I've got a place prepared for me and God's preparing me for my place because he can't deny himself Lord help my unbelief help me get Victory help me overcome help me get rid of bitterness help me match up with that image that you are that I can reflect that You Are My Strength you are my righteousness you're all that I have need of I'm putting off this old coat this code isn't me I'm inside of this coat David McGarry is inside of here he says you got a better coat the one you used to wear it's wore out what is it it's the Garment you are inside of that there this garment only done what it bore the image but you don't need it anymore now you've hung it up it's a rag and that's the way this old body is you you bore the image of the Heavenly yet it's not you you are inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it and bringing it in line with the word of God you're inside yourself your being the inside of you is bringing it into subjection because it knows it's got to come into subjection because it's putting off this body and it wants to match up oh Hallelujah this body is just an old coat and someday what you'll do with it if you was only the only the Garment for a while that is like the Earthly garment this body your real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you'd call William Branham or Susie Jones or whatever it is see someday it'll hang in the earth Hall of memory of you it'll put out yonder in a grave that somebody will put a tombstone on here lies Reverend so and so John or so and so on so and so that'll lie there as a memory of you the people just see you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that the old code itself just bore the image of the heavenly it only bore the image of what was on the inside of that you see what I mean oh little children do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight paragraph 115 that do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight that's something there's a body waiting Yonder there's a body waiting to be received people don't be deceived don't be deceived the Devil is a deceiver even the wedding garment you must wear it it must be now we're at the evening time the Earthly body is now ready to be dissolved we're preparing to enter into the Heavenly and we now feel the strange call to God to go to this great even Eden and before we can be born here our little bodies cry for something that had to be provided or we would be an Afflicted child here if it wasn't is it sinking in God has no afflictions up there there everyone perfectly lined up the bride just exactly like the groom was the word manifested in its season God grant tonight children each and every one of you there is a heaven to go to there is a hell to stay away from there's there's so many things that we we could say but I hope you understand what he's saying there's a call now it's a matching time now maybe you've never been there before maybe you fought the fight and you struggled and I could go all back to this book and talk how brother Brown talks how you mature it's all in there but he says now it finally comes down to where there's a a a strange call in the bride because they know the hours at hand yeah and they want to match up because it's matching time and I hope you feel that I hope we shake ourselves I hope you understand what I'm saying it's time to put those things behind as when we used to think of a child but now we're adults we're called let's make our calling an election sure let's connect with our future let's get involved in the things that are to be and I'd just like to close with this paragraph the musicians can come you know there's a yeah and you know if you read this message or you go back and study it we know what that Mansion is that he has over there it's a body and this is just for some people that had wondered what that body will be like uh and uh and so I'd like to read this to you in closing because he's got one for you he's got one of these bodies right here for you so then I seen that and these women run up and was throwing their arms around me and hugging me and calling me brother and now they were women but there can never be sin in that place they were a woman paragraph 126 I'm sorry Brothers paragraph 126. they were a woman but there can never be sin in that place they were a woman but see what made us now a what made us now a woman with a gland a female gland and the man with the male gland it's for raising children there it won't be they'll all be one gland but they'll still be in the form the Earthly image that they were here will be there but there will be never can be sin it'll all the same they'll all be that they'll all be no more children raised there that's right it'll be that way so I look and these women and he goes on just think of that body this one caused us a lot of trouble but that one's not going to have all that reproductive energy and all that stuff oh Glorious Day amen amen oh oh happy day when Jesus comes do you love them this morning you want to match up hey man let's Stand Together I hope you're encouraged this morning I know I've read a lot and I know it's hard because I'm not a good reader and I suppose I can just preach it but I want you to be anchored in what he said and I hope you go back and you take this message things that
