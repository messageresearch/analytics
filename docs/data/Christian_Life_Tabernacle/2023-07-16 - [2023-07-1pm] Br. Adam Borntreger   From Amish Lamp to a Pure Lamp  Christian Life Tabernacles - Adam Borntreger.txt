Description:
Br. Adam Borntreger
July 16, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas
Growing up Amish, no regents, and thankful for where the Lord has brought me. From a Amish lamp to a burning pure lamp of the Lord. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Sarah God bless you I found out you you sing so we're gonna have to fit you in soon so anyway Lord bless you all tonight brother Adam how do you say your last name born Traeger born thank you brother amen praise the Lord well I have to say uh I've learned a very valuable lesson this weekend and that it's not not to share about how long I like to study before a sermon seems like he Brother David decided it's best to just uh call me on the spot if I do that so I appreciate all the prayers and um if y'all would let's turn turn to the scripture Leviticus 24 starting with verses 1 through 4. and while you're all turning there I I just wanted to say that um I'm going to be taking the time to just share my testimony tonight and my my a little bit of my life story so when you reach that you say Amen praise the Lord Leviticus 24 1. and the Lord spake unto Moses saying I want you to to notice right there I want to stop right there for a little bit and just take time to think about that for a minute and the Lord spake unto Moses and if you think about that it's no different than the Lord spoken to brother Branham it's no different it's the only difference is the name it could have very easily been changed around to where it could have been an hour day that Moses was here and brother brother Brandon would have been back there and the Lord spoke to brother Branham and he's it's the very same thing in our day that he spoke to brother Branham and he gave us the words it was the very inspiration that came to Moses then it was the very inspiration that came to brother Brandon in our day so the only difference is uh the Lord said the prophet spoke in our day was recorded by a tape whereas uh the words that was recorded by Moses was in in in in in letter form and in verse 2 it says command the children of Israel that they bring unto the pure oil now if you notice command this was not a request if you will if you feel like it it was a command in that day that they bring unto Aaron the priest a pure oil and it had to be a pure oil it was not just any oil it was not just a just any oil that they found or any oil that they could produce it had to be a pure oil uh from an olive olive beaten for the light to cause the lamps to burn continually without the veil of the testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation shall Aaron order it before the Lord continually and if you notice I want to stress in that word a little bit as well continually as it is mentioned uh three times it in in these verses without the veil of the testimony in the Tabernacle of the congregation shall Aaron order it from the evening into the morning before the Lord continually it shall be a statute and in other words a statute stands for in it translates to law it in in in other words it is it is before the Lord continually it shall be a law forever in your Generations he shall order the lamps upon the pure Candlestick and as the prophet said a Candlestick also is uh in that day it's it's good for a lampstand it was a lampstand and so in other words it would be a pure lampstand before the Lord continually and I just love the detail that they put in that it was not just any lampstanding he said he said that for a reason a pure Candlestick a pure lampstand before the Lord continually let's go to the Lord of Lord of Prayer Lord Jesus father such a wonderful Name Lord that in a time of need in a time of whatever we may be going through or in a time of rejoicing father is that Great Name Lord that we love to we love so much and we love to speak in that great name father we live by your name and we just thank you Father for this opportunity tonight to be able to come and worship you again father I just pray Lord you would help me father just to Lord just to get out of the way father that you can come down and just bless your people tonight father for Lord it is my desire father Lord to just step out of the way that you can just use my words my voice father just to come down and speak to these people and to be a blessing to everyone and be a blessing to me Lord and Lord I just we just thank you Father for this opportunity tonight to come before you again I just pray a blessing over everything that would be said and heard tonight and we pray all this in Jesus holy name amen you all can be seated I want to say that first of all I want to say thank you to Brother David for this opportunity and it is a privilege and an honor to be here tonight and um I have to say I'm I'm just very young yet in in the ministry and and this is my first time that I've ever had that I've only had two hours to prepare for a sermon pray for the Lord so like I said I I wanted to start with um sharing a little bit of my life story and starting out I I grew up as a little Amish boy and and for many of you who may not be familiar with the Amish they I do respect their their way of living and their original motive of the why they want to live the way they did they want it to be separated from the world they chose to live that lifestyle because it was their way of being separated from everything that was going on they wanted to live a holy life before the Lord and that's the best way that they knew to do it and so that is the lifestyle that I grew up in there was no technology there was we um we our way of getting around was with a horse-drawn carriage horse and Buggies while we called it and I grew up in northeastern Missouri was born and raised there and growing up it was a very simple life we we didn't have like I say we didn't have technology we didn't have electric we didn't have we uh finally at the age of at the age of I'm get I if I remember right it's like seven or eight is when I first remembered that we actually were able to have running water in our house that uh we always had to carry water in we had running water into the property but we never were able to have it into the house so we had to go out to the to the um what would it was a hydrant out in the middle somewhere we just had to get a pail of water and take it inside that's where we drink our how we had our water to do whatever we needed to do and so finally um the bishop which is the bishop of the community every Community has to have a bishop that is that is how the community has run that the bishop decides what how we live and what we live by we have all these Traditions that we live by and and and some communities are allowed to have cell phones some are allowed to be able to drive vehicles they can't own them but they can drive them some are allowed to have cell phones they can't own them but use them some can use them and own them um so every Community is a little bit different it is all based on what the bishop decides just to put in simple terms and in our community in particular we did we were not allowed to have cell phones we were not allowed to have uh Power mowers the only power mower that I had was push them by my arms and that was a challenge but it was a good great exercise we didn't go to the gym but that was the perfect way to do it and so it was very simple it was a very very simple life we um we would get home in the evenings the house was dark we had to grab a match FInd matches and um light our lamps and that was what was our light we had maybe a lantern a gas lantern that we would use to have in our living room would be hanging on the ceiling and we'd have to take it down from ceiling light it hang it back up and that would be our light and then of course once we head to bed we weren't able to do like Matthew as able to Matthew McGarry is able to do he can just say hey Google turn off the lights it didn't work that way it was it was hey honey could you go blow out the lantern please and so it it was it was that was our lifestyle we did not have heater AC we did have heat and that was a wood stove and it it would uh having a wood stove would really help my mom clean the house a lot more often with all the smoke blowing around every time um but no AC the only AC we had was the windows open all day and all night and a hot summer day with screens to keep the insects out of course but we had flies all around every time every day and I have to say I've I I was always a strange person because I enjoyed them but my mom didn't she hated me and my mom she would I remember coming home from our private school we had a little private school in the community and I loved it it was it was um it was a it was easy to haven't you know our personal little school we all spoke the same language and in this in this case we had one language and that was our German which is everybody knows it by Pennsylvania Dutch and that was our language so we learned that language at home so we actually had to learn the English language we had to learn that so that was actually part of our schooling was to learn that language because that's something we were not taught at home um so under my family we all left the Amish at the same time so under our family that's still our main language is is the German language and and um uh so uh I I have many fond memories from our our little private school but I I I I remember coming home and my mom would be baking and she didn't have a guest so like I said it was wood so even if it was 90 degrees outside with no AC all the windows would be open and we'd still have that hot wood stove burning to bake whatever she was baking or canning whatever she was doing and it was extremely hot on the in in that house it was very very hot I had now now the fact that we have all the AC and everything we have I'm just trying to think back and imagine how we survived it but but I forgot those days honestly and I don't regret it um so yeah she uh she would bake with her with her wood stove and so that was part of my chores and evening was to make sure that we still had wood supplied in the house every evening and then we had livestock as well and it was fun I loved I loved taking care of the chickens and summer times was my favorite time there was not that many responsibilities growing up it was like heaven you know I could go back in the woods and we would build our houses we would we would be inspired by all these western books we didn't have movies so we had western books and as boys we have fun reading these books and you know talking about these Six Guns and how they would twirl them on their fingers and all that you know it was it was fun we we would pick up little branches that looked like pistols and we would use those and we'd play around and and then we'd have friends over and we'd ride ponies and our horses you know we it that that that was our life and I really enjoyed it I I have to say I don't regret where I came from but at the same time I'm glad I'm not there either I'm I'm very thankful that the Lord has shown me the truth in this day and my family we all we all left at the same time like I said we we we came to the message but I'll I'll come back in come to that in a minute and so and yeah in in in the summertime it was we were Carefree we were able to do what we we weren't able to do everything we wanted to do we had boundaries but still we were able to play back in the woods we were able to uh it it was just it was all I can say is I have many many fond memories of of doing that and and um and being a strange kid as I am or it used to being I'm not anymore my wife still thinks I am but I thought I'm pretty normal by now I used to enjoy going out in the chicken coop and just laying down and having the chicken set all over me and it was relaxing I'd take a nap like that and and um and yeah um unfortunately my family didn't see it that way but I I used to when I was younger I'd go out and eat with the dog when I was hungry after supper all the scraps would be thrown out for a dog to eat and then my family would find me out there eating eating with the dog and so I've I've always been been very very strange and I've also had some struggles in my uh years in school I never we had eight grades in our school and I I I never made it to the eighth grade I I was dyslexic and my teachers did not understand what was going on and and I just had trouble with learning and of course being a private school you know we none of the teachers they were basically just hired by the community all right we'll pick a young girl here she'll take this on like she's been through the grades so she understands a little bit she knows the answer if she can help us that's basically it there was no there was no training that the teacher went through there was nothing for her to learn how to really be a good teacher and so so they would never really understand my challenges and and so I just I I found it hard I wanted to learn but I found it hard to and I just based I just soon lost my interest in learning so I uh in later years and my mom just homeschooled me and and the rest of my siblings actually and and I I was criticized many times in school and it thinks it just I I wasn't very well liked among the students and so I I found it a challenge I found it a challenge to I had this stuttering problem and and it just seems like I couldn't do anything right and then in in in later years growing up I made so many mistakes and like I said I I I was a crazy child so I I have to say I embarrassed my dad a few times as well and so but yet at the same time I always felt like I have a purpose I have a purpose in life and I didn't know what it was but there was just something in me at growing up like that feeling like many Town sailing alone I just didn't have friends and I was just odd the rest of my siblings did um and it hurt and though nobody really seemed to notice and I wouldn't share anything I kept all that bottled up inside and and I was trying to make sense of of this life and and in in later years that took effect on me but I've always I've always felt like there's just something more that I can do and so finally as the years went on my dad started reading the Bible and that is something you just can't do in the out the Amish community is read an English Bible it's not allowed and the reason for that is because the English Bible if you truly take some time to study it it things are revealed to you and in the Amish community there's so many things that the Traditions that the Amish have and well first of all um uh uh uh Jesus himself speaks out against the traditions of man so that's already puts all that away but the more that my dad started reading the scriptures he he began to question whether the Amish lifestyle was right and whether um it truly took us to heaven the way they were saying it would it's the only way you can go to heaven is if you live the Amish life so basically every 99.99 of all the world is lost in from the Amish Viewpoint the only the embouchure can be saved and the only way anybody can be saved is if they join the Amish community so they basically have to leave everything behind they have to join us and live our lifestyle in order to be saved and go to heaven so basically in my relatives eyes and everybody that knows that we left the Amish we're lost to them but it just it's it I have a burden for them because they don't know they don't know what we know and like I said I just praise the Lord that he's revealed this to me because I I I I was just thinking about that you know I could I could very easily not be here anymore because of of the things I've gone through I've studied with suicidal issues for many many years and it it was it was hard and I wanted to take my life so many times and finally I I knew that life was wrong that thought process was wrong and and finally one day my dad seen that he had to he had to do something for me and so he sent me off somewhere he said he's he sent me to a um to a seminar in Colorado and it was all about seeing finding your purpose in this life and it was a blessing even though this this place that I was sent to had um you know it had it it was not based on Christian values it was based strictly on helping people become a better you just to put in simple terms and so he sent me there hoping that would help me in which he did and I I I just thank the Lord for for leading me that way um it was there that I've learned I've learned that I have a purpose in life and it was there that I I took some time to really find my purpose and what I've always wanted to do was to be a blessing to the people and and anyway but uh back to my story so my dad began to question whether it was right and so finally he left we we all left um uh my mom my dad both they just they they just my dad first it was revealed to him that this is not right the Amish way is not right and so he he um I came to my mom she was a little bit reluctant but then finally one night she was really burdened about this and and and the the the the the Lord tester that night revealed it to her and and that was it so after that we left the Amish and I was excited of course like I I I was a redneck as a family so when I heard that they were leaving I was excited I was like now I can wear jeans I don't have to I don't have to abide by these rules anymore I can I can drive a car now and I was excited but before all this happened to back this up a little bit I was not aware that my parents were going through this process and my dad had a palette we would sell pallets to a certain company and so it was me and my brother's job to build these pallets and so one afternoon while we were building pallets we got bored and so we were like well we're going to go do a little fishing my parents ain't home anyway and they won't know so we went out to the pond to do some fishing and suddenly I seen the van come around the curve and I was like oh dad's coming so we quickly we started running up there and just as we got up close to the shed I seen him coming in the driveway mine was sitting in the passenger seat my dad was driving and I was feeling like a center for disobeying him and not doing pallets but at this point I was wondering which of us is actually the real sinner because he's driving a car so at that point it that was that was the the changing point for us um he he drove behind the building parked the vehicle my mom wouldn't decide and and uh they both went inside actually and he he had one of my little brothers come out and um tell us tell me and me and my brother Joe that we got to come inside and I was like oh we're in trouble and so we go inside and he just sits down with the family and he's like I want you all to know that this is not wrong in God's eyes for us to drive a vehicle it's not wrong and God's eyes for us to change our lifestyle he it it's as long as we serve him that's all that matters but it is not wrong to drive a vehicle and change our clothes that's that's not a problem and so I was like okay it didn't I did not question it after that I was like okay that's fine perfect and at that point my mind started rolling like okay what else can I do now and so but uh for my oldest sister she's the oldest of family Mary she's she was the only one that was a little bit she was at the point where she was coming she was at the age where she was looking to get baptized in in into the Amish community and once you do that you're locked in so if you leave after you're baptized into the Amish community you're you will be shunned and you will not have any access unless if you want to return to the Amish there's a process you have to go through there's a long process uh you have to go through to come back in basically what they would consider the purification stage for you to come back and so she was come to that age where she was uh you know she really wondered whether my parents were making the right step but with a little bit of persuasion she finally was like okay it's it's good and so the whole family left we all left at the same time and and then of course it was hard after that because our relatives found out uh both of my grandparents on both sides um found out and so they were of course trying to convince us that it's wrong but my parents were settled their ways and there was no changing they were they were out and so we just we just followed our parents and then we started looking for churches to go to we went through so many different denominations and none of them it just it just it just did not sit in our minds it it there was just something wrong and it just did not satisfy us and that we we were um we were very uh unsettled with every church that we went to and we went to many of them out of state friends were like you know after we left we had many friends out uh in in in in in different denominations they were like oh well why don't you come to my church you know they were so excited like come join us you know so we went to so many different churches and none of them uh just it it just wasn't right and so um then uh brother Matt Morse which is uh use was my former Pastor uh he pastors a church there in Arkansas and that's actually where my family's at right now um so he started uh we were very good friends with him and so he he started coming up and having holding a Sunday service with us and he would just preach to the family and so we had a little church Gathering there and he would not mention the name William Branham but he would he would um and it I uh he has he has a very deep burden for touching people you know outside and so he has this very unique way of of preaching this message without using Brother random which I I I I I've heard so so many ministers do that so I'm not just pointing towards him but uh what I'm saying is just he's he was really good at that and so he uh he would be um uh you know he he'd be bringing the message and he's for some reason it was just there was something about it my dad was like that's so powerful that's such a you know that's such a powerful thought and so he he really had great respect for brother Matt and finally um his Uncle David Morse uh was holding special meetings and so brother Matt was like well why don't you come down and and um visit our church and so we were like sure that was the very first message church we ever went to very first and at that point we didn't know it was a message church but uh that was the first one and we liked it it was something about the church so it it it was just it just sat right it was just something about it that's what we're looking for we didn't know it at the time but you know there there's a reason that it says in the scriptures where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered and so at the time we didn't know why but it just that that was right and so so then we got introduced to the brother random to all the tapes from Brother random and for some reason I just never had a question about it when I listened to that very first message well I I I have to go back to this what actually got me in and and convinced that the prophet was uh you know that brother random was a prophet in our day um uh was one afternoon when we got introduced to it my dad was sitting in the living room with his computer and my mom was sitting there too and they were looking at a video of brother Branham in the discernment line in the prayer line and I walk in and I looked at that and I was like I my mom and dad were just sitting there watching that they were very into it I noticed that I was like and that woman started crying he was talking to the woman pointing and she just started crying I was like wow that woman's putting on a good show and my dad was like no that's real I was like okay what did I just do so I just looked at it for a little bit longer and I was like after that it just it just clicked I was like okay that was it so as soon as I listened to an actual message from brother Brandon I was like wow so after that it was just like that's absolute I just never it it it it it it it there was no longer a question in my mind and then it um the the Revelation just struck me which a few years later I was struggling with that for a while but a few years later um another brother uh helped me with that to understand that these messages these recorded tapes uh all these messages that brother Brandon preached is basically the word of God revealed so it's not that we can separate these messages from the word of God it was just uh a greater revelation of what the word is actually talking about and without that I mean how would we really uh just personally for myself if it if it wasn't it if it wasn't for the message it'd be very hard for me to to be able to understand what the word is truly saying there's so many things that brother around me even says that I'm still hard to understand but you know we don't we don't understand it but we believe it you know and so so it it it it was just after Brandon uh you know the message wasn't introduced to us there was no question about it anymore we we um we we we we we we've been following the message ever since then that was the turning point and and then um we we were in the message for five or six years at least and with no church to go through to go to we we would live stream a church in South Carolina and uh finally brother Matt had it was laid on his heart to to start a church in BlackRock and to Black in in Black Rock Arkansas and so he did and uh that was about four years ago and he invited us to come and of course we've been in the message already uh for for a few years at that point so yeah um and I was like yeah you know that's uh from where we were living to there was six hours it was like we don't have that far to move we'll just move down there we can have that as our home church and that was our very first message church that we could actually call home and and we moved down there and um and I'm I'm I'm I'm getting a little ahead of myself I I want to back up to say this I I got baptized and I was searching and longing for the Holy Spirit and one evening after this is why we were live streaming uh the church in South Carolina uh one evening it was after Wednesday night's service there was an altar call and there were just I mean almost every person that church was up there the Elder praying and something just hit my heart I just I was like Lord I just want to be right and so that night I went up to my bedroom that was just a burden and I just couldn't help it I went up to my bedroom and I just cried for a full hour I felt like the worst sinner ever but at the end of it the Sleep presence just came over me and I knew and it is it was an experience that I cannot explain what I was experiencing at that full in that full hour but it changed something changed in me at that point and I'm gonna say since I've received the Holy Spirit from that point life has not been easy has not been easy at all it has been many many battles along the way but it has also been uh many years of molding many flaws and habits bad habits and things in my life that does not serve me in my relationship with the Lord and it's it's just like um the scripture says I I can't call it now exactly where I was but God led a prophet down through The Potter's House to show him how the Potter will take a piece of clay and mold it and I've learned that that's our that's our life we have a purpose here and it's he's molding us into that perfect that Perfect Image that he has of us and that has been that has been my the the the the the the process in my life and um and then since since we've been in Arkansas we've been there for about four years and back when I was 16 after we had left the Amish we we left out the damage when I was uh uh almost 15 years old and at the age of 16 I just had this something in my heart that I just I felt like I wanted to be a speaker I wasn't thinking about preaching but I wanted to be a speaker of some kind I wanted to be a blessing to the people I didn't have an education I don't have very much of an education at all but I I I I I I I I I I I wanted to be a speaker I longed to be before people and to help people I wanted to see something that would be a blessing to people and that just kept going in my mind on and on all the way up till uh we went to Brother Mass church and so finally I told Brother Matt I just I I feel like I feel like I'm called to breach and of course he didn't take that lightly and he didn't take me seriously um so I had to I had to come back to him a few times and finally finally um one evening it was like okay well you want to take the Wednesday night service I was like sure and um of course being as nervous as I was and trying to stay with my notes I I have to say I was kind of unsatisfied with that with my first message but it it it was a start and we have we all start somewhere uh and then um about less than a year later I have to back that up it was before I actually started preaching um of course being new new in that church yet and we had many many great friends in that church people wanted to help us and uh uh and so you know I wasn't I didn't have uh I was not in a relationship with any girl and so many of the friends down have friends down there thought that you know that they should find somebody for me and I did not ask them to but I I kind of felt like I have the right to make up my own mind here but anyway unfortunately um we had special meetings there in Arkansas and uh um many of you might know know the rent the Reynolds family there in Arkansas but anyway they're very good friends with um uh brother Bryce and his family and so Sarah um of course not knowing anybody either um sister Haven which was a very good friend of Sarah's thought that it might be a good idea to get us together and of course me being a strange fellow that I am I didn't think it was a good idea so when I caught wind that this was taking place I did my best to avoid her but at the cafeteria after service that night this was on a Friday night after service I immediately went out it was dark outside so nobody could see me so I went out in the dark I was out there by the vehicles and my brother Joe comes out and he's like hey Haven's looking for it and I was like oh yeah she is I was like she was like he was like yeah she's looking for you and she she wants you to come up and I was like yeah no I don't think I will just tell my brothers to come we're leaving and so we left church and we go over to the to the uh cafeteria where uh where they were serving food and in the food line I see brother Joe and Haven but I didn't see Sarah and and so brother Drew was like come over here and so I was like okay um so and then he he I come over there and he's like I want to introduce you to a very good friend of mine and that was Haven I mean uh Sarah's standing in front of those two and and so she turns around with a big old smile on her face you know and she was shy and I was shy and I didn't want to talk to her and and so uh and so I shook her hand with a big smile and and then he was trying to keep the conversation going but I didn't say anything and she didn't say anything so so finally I just shook my head and I said that's what I told brother Joe I said I gotta go find myself and I went outside and and so I did not say anything for the rest of that evening to her I did not even look at Sarah I did not want anything to do with her I was perfectly fine making new friends there were a whole bunch of young boys there so I was out just having a good time and I was my evening was going really really well but then I was actually talking with Haven's fiance they were not married yet they were engaged I was talking with him brother Ben Lovell and and Haven walks over there and she was kind of sad I could tell she seemed kind of upset she didn't she she didn't make eye contact with me directly and she didn't smile either um and then she told Ben it's time to go so I was like okay yeah you gotta go ahead and that night on the way home it something just struck me I was like what did I do wrong Lord I felt like I was living in such a world of condemnation I was like what in the world did I do I I it it didn't make sense and then but I was feeling so bad because I had turned my back on Sarah I I I was feeling horrible about that I was like I just I couldn't get it on my mind after I left the cafeteria going home it was just it was such a heavy burden in my heart I was like I I I I I I I I felt like the worst sinner ever and so the next day the burden kept getting worse and worse and then that was on Saturday so the whole church was gathered at a campground and we were playing volleyball and having a good time and but I wasn't having a good time I felt like crying and so I uh at that point I just wanted to apologize to Sarah for turning my back on her and then leave her alone I don't want anything to do with her but I just want to tell her that I'm sorry I felt so bad that I did that to her the night before I felt like a disrespected lady and so but that didn't happen I never got that opportunity and that night in church service I was at that point I was feeling so horrible that I could not even focus on the ministering of the word on the entire message I was feeling horrible and and so finally at the end of the service the spirit of God was just moving in the building and people were coming up to the Altar and I finally just raised my hand I said Lord I will talk to her tonight if you will just take this burden from me and immediately as I said that I heard a clear Audible Voice that said don't turn your back on the one I send and as soon as I heard that I immediately flipped from not wanting to get married to I knew this was the girl I'm going to marry and she didn't know that of course not and so through our entire relationship I felt like I was walking on thin ice because I didn't want to you know shy her away I had to be very very careful not to you know mistreat her in any way um and but it it and I I I did not tell her what happened until we were engaged I I was very careful with who I shared the story with because I did not want to use it as an advantage of convincing her that she's the one uh and I don't take this story very lightly it it it it it it was very it was very special and very special experience to me and that was that was the the turning point for me before that I have to be clear I did not want to get married at all um and so that was going through my mind I was I I I was just going to grow up to be a bachelor and single I'm good and so but that night it it all flipped for me and so then during our our relationship I I started preaching and um and then of course we come to a point where we wanted to get married a year later and then I decide well if we're getting married I'll move to Oklahoma and my did that not it did not sit with my pastor or my family it was it was quite a quite a hard decision to make but when I tend to make decisions I stick with them and so uh though I had a lot of objection on either side I did it anyway and uh I had this I had this burden on my heart to help Brother Rice in in his church there in Claremore and I I uh he you know he's he's he's pastoring alone and and he takes almost every Sunday and Wednesday service alone he's he's doing uh it's it's it's a big load on him and plus he's he's working sometimes as well and it was on the heart that you know I just want to be a blessing to him in his little church and and so I'm I'm I moved out there for that reason and and I I've been helping him out uh here and there and and um uh that has been that that has been my my desire through um I have to say since in from my growing up years up until now having the uh you know the problems that have been dyslexic and hard of learning and all that not any much of an education at all it I have a soft spot for people like that it's like whenever I see a person who's uh has some type of an issue it's just it's just it just hits me like I I just have a burden for people like that just because I've I I I I've been there and I know how it feels like but I I I I I believe that it has it has it turns out it has been a blessing because it gives me a greater burden to help people like that indeed and I have an opportunity to do that and uh I'm able to touch people where where I couldn't if I hadn't gone through the things I've been through and so um it's so I've wanted it wanted to make this my purpose in this life and I've I've I've I've I believe this should be the purpose of every Christian I I wanted to share this little story too it just come to my mind actually while I was in Florida one time uh the whole family was there and my older brother he was a great influence to me but he moved to South Carolina to the church that we were live streaming and he he he wanted a message church at that point we weren't going to any message church so he wanted to go to a message church so he moved down there and for some reason it just didn't work out for the rest of the family to move we wanted to but it just didn't there were too many complications it just didn't work out and so we finally just decided Well it's just not the will of the Lord for us to do so the Samuel moved my older brother Samuel moved down there anyway and uh though he wants to admit it or not I know he was looking for a girl so you know that's a good reason to move um uh anyway he he got married and now I get to enjoy his little his little son whenever I get to see him cute little fella too um anyway we were in Florida and Samuel I was dealing with depression suicidal issues at that point and Samuel told me something that always stuck to me I was like what's my purpose I just want a purpose I want something to do I I I want to make a difference I can't just go through this life working a job going home doing nothing and just repeat this cycle all over again I have to have something that I can do I want to make a difference for people and Samuel was like you know the greatest purpose you have in this life is to serve the Lord and that just stuck with me it just it it hit a little differently that time and I got to thinking about that statement the greatest purpose we have is to serve the Lord and yes it is the greatest purpose we have in this life but and this purpose that we have every single individual it can Branch out a little bit differently for some it is preaching that is their that is their the the the the way that they serve the Lord for others it is um you know just being a just living a clean pure holy life on the street you're still preaching a message to people whatever it is everybody it can Branch out a little bit differently to every individual but still we have that one purpose and that is to serve the Lord and so uh cut uh coming down to a close I just wanted to make this statement that always stuck with me our purpose is to serve the Lord and to keep our lights shining in this wicked Dark Age that we live in and while I was studying one day I uh came across the scripture and it just really hit my heart and it is it it it just could caught my attention and my my my my Bible here has a title for every every uh topic and or or or the verses that uh whatever the verses are talking about it has a small title for that and it just hit me when it said oil for the lamps and I was I started studying on that and that's where it really where it really stuck with me that um you know we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham and just as it was in the natural Seed of Abraham it was commanded of them that they bring unto Aaron a pure oil amen beaten for the light it had to be a pure oil and a olive that was beaten so it was basically this is not going to be an easy task either to bring this oil but it was a command so they had to beat this oil out of this Olive and it was not it it it it it it it was not an easy task to be able to do that but they had to do this continually and that's what I want to stress on tonight is the fact that be in the spiritual seat of Abraham that is required of us too it is a law to our generation that we have to continually keep before the Lord we have to how do we produce this well how do we get this oil we get it by reading the word this is where the oil comes from because as the prophet said as the prophet said that the oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit Well what is the holy spirit it is the word of God and and Jesus said that he would never leave us comfortless but he would send a comforter to us and in order to keep feeding that keep feeding the fire of God the oil to keep it lit because when you receive that fire when you receive the Holy Spirit and you receive the fire of God in your heart it can go out if you don't feed it if you don't continue to beat that Olive and you keep feeding on the word and if you don't continue to keep before the Lord in prayer and yes I know it gets hard so many times for us because in this wicked world that we live in it's dark and we have demons just like uh Brother Davis said this morning a 200 000 demons it is not easy to get down to our knees and pray sometimes it is not easy to sit down to read the word because we have so much to do there's all this work that needs to be done and and uh schedule I mean we have so our schedule is booked we have so many things that we need to meet we have all you know we have uh friends so we got to help and and just everything that we have to do so it is it is not an easy task but it is important that we keep beating we keep producing that oil from the word of God and continue in prayer and that produces the oil to keep that lamp burning and if you notice it has to be on a pure Candlestick a pure lampstand not just any lampstand but how is our lampstand tonight I'll repair before the Lord it is a very sobering thought to think about that what if what is our heart like tonight that heart that is where the light is burning continually and from the heart is where where everything that we do in our daily lives flows out from the heart what your actions is in your natural life will show what is inside your heart so is is is our lampstand is it pure is it pure enough to be able that the fire of God can actually burn on top of that landstand and from the lampstand I I I I I love how the prophet explained that so beautifully he said that in this lab stand the lamp sits the top of the lamp stand and there's a wick that hangs down into the oil and it burns from the oil so it sucks the oil up through that Wick and then it burns on top of that and so we it it is important that we constantly keep that oil there or the fire will go out and I uh and I'm just going to end with this quote right here how the prophet said I love it so much in in in 1953 uh Witnesses is it is the title of this message he said but brother let your light shine in the darkest places where it is really needed out in the hedges and the highways in the bar rooms out down the street everywhere you're at let your light shine as a witness and I love that that is so beautifully said because in this day and age the the thing that we need the most is for our light to shine and it is very critical and it is not as we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham it is a law in Our Generations that we keep producing that lamp that oil continually it is it is not just a it is not just a whether you feel like producing this oil if you notice it was a command it was not just well today I'm busy so maybe tomorrow maybe next week or well I don't feel so good today I'm kind of sick I'll I'll just take the day off and maybe watch a movie uh maybe tomorrow we'll we'll I'll I'll I'll read my Bible I kind of feel like maybe tomorrow might be a better day for me that's not what God said it was a command whether you feel like it or not whether you have time for it or not it doesn't matter what you're going through this is a requirement that we constantly keep feeding on the word of God and producing that oil to keep that light burning because if you don't feed on the word of God and you don't keep in prayer that like that fire will go out the uh the fire of God cannot live and cannot survive without oil it just cannot so um I that that was that that was on my heart tonight and I I I I I'm just going to close and say I really appreciate this opportunity and I thank you all for listening it's a blessing being here and I'm just glad that I'm have this opportunity to come down and and to be a blessing to the church and to be able to film this building for you all God bless you all [Applause] it's an individual Affair isn't it you know God deals with each of us you know and Sarah I know you didn't get to tell your side of the story but uh uh you can tell me your side of the story and I'll relay it to everybody for you but you know I I appreciate what we heard because I know that within the framework of it you could all relate to the troubles you went through the Mind battles you had the the insufficiencies you felt but he never forsook you amen that's right you know he brought you through it all because he made a promise a long time ago that nothing could pluck you from the palm his hand and and he'll always remain that way and it's it and we always just trust that that hunger brother prophet of God said that draw what what you're drawing in you know he said that's that's what determines whether you have the light what you what do you want to pull into your life what do you want to pull into your life even Corinthos our brother said uh his problem of being the lexic stutters a little all those complexes that had was no excuse he didn't use it as an excuse because what was hungering on the inside and if you can connect with that deep calling to the deep that deep will always respond it'll always be there to get you through your complex to get you through your doubt to get you through the the times that you feel like you're different and that you're alone and that you're separated and you're going through all this inner turmoil he's still there and he promised I'll never leave you in fact we know for a fact that it's through those times that he's there the most amen oh yes when you think he's the farthest away he's really the closest amen um you know I I thought of something I had an opportunity to visit with a a young man the other day in it It's a Wonderful testimony um me and Leslie had went to visit and we walked into the house and and I I I guess we all packed a presence with us I hope the presence we pack is the presence of the Lord amen that you make could make a difference in the atmosphere I was talking about uh how brother Andrew the other day just his approach and he changed the atmosphere you know what I mean and it it makes a difference you we don't know why but certain people just have that ability you know I've never had the ability to make a good first impression you know what I mean but after I finally win a friend we're friends for life you know I have very few but uh it's something that ability to understand that you you can just your presence your attitude can can make a difference in and uh you know when when I uh sometimes when I'm not feeling well there's certain Brothers I'll call to pray for me because for some reason God hears their prayer you know I mean it makes a difference so we need one another but we walked into this house and this young man was there and he said you know the minute you walked in the door I felt a feeling all over me that I needed to be baptized and so first of all he was wondering what was that you know and I said well you know it it was just the Lord it just the time you know and and it's such a human response but he wanted to I said God told you to be to be baptized they said do it obey it and and of course he thought well my life's not right you know what I mean there's things I'm doing I'm not I'm not living for God I don't I'm not believing the way that I should and I said you know you don't get well before you take the medicine that's right amen that's true you know what I mean and so many people want to do that they want to get well before they take the medicine they want to get right before they get baptized they want to try to clean their house before they give their heart to the lord it's never about that it's like our brother said I command you oh yeah amen so when he speaks move you know what I mean when he talks your heart act upon it just let it just put it into his hands and he'll do it and uh I know what it's like when God sends you somebody so I know that part of your testimony really well you know I had someone call me on the phone and very strange but we've had 50 some years together so I believe it was the Lord amen so I I trust you feel something in your heart tonight that you feel that that God's with you and no matter what you think your circumstance is the footsteps of the righteous are still ordered by the Lord that's right amen and he's determined not to lose a one amen and he'll get you who you have need of having he'll provide for your life he'll take care of you put God first amen and all also be added unto you God bless you let's stand this evening that's which y'all pray for Adam and I guess they call you little Amos because you're a junior right yeah okay so we uh asked y'all just to keep them in prayer it's been extremely hot and they're all the way up in the top of that attic and it's about 107 probably 112 or 14 degrees up there and then when he sprays his gun that phone comes out of there at about 128 degrees so it hits there that chemical is you know poofing out and it's really hot and uh so if you just pray that God really give them some Supernatural uh strength and and just really make it go well form and it's quite a sacrifice that he's put out on our behalf so don't forget him in prayer and I hope you know you always have a place here and you'd love to have your fellowship with us and speak to us again if you love the Lord as you can spell our head a moment before we sing this song as our brothers spoke tonight [Music] maybe you looked at yourself a little bit maybe you have some doubts or some worries or maybe you have some uncertainties but whatever it is you want to turn your hands to heaven and say Lord you know all the desires of my heart you know
