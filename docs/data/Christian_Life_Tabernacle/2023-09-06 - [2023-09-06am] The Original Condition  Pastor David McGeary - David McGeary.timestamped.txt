[28:29] truly
[28:30] you are a comforter
[28:33] you're our hope in this dark time where
[28:38] man has
[28:41] wished no longer to
[28:44] keep you in their knowledge or to live
[28:47] by your ways
[28:51] where those that love you are becoming
[28:54] in the minority
[28:58] but father we have this great hope
[29:02] and this great promise you promise never
[29:05] to leave us or never to forsake us
[29:09] to be with us and even in us till the
[29:12] end
[29:13] Lord we ask that you would bless your
[29:15] word tonight in this little Wednesday
[29:18] evening service
[29:20] we just trust that you'll be our portion
[29:23] of you'll Grant to us your peace the
[29:28] comfort of your word father as we just
[29:30] Fellowship to stir up our minds in our
[29:33] hearts in remembrance of you bless each
[29:37] need this evening we pray in Jesus name
[29:41] amen amen amen God bless you let's turn
[29:45] in our Bibles to
[29:47] that The Book of Joel and then we'll
[29:51] read a couple other scriptures also
[29:54] found in in our in the Bible and uh you
[29:59] know someone came to me and they asked
[30:01] me uh one of the young ones they said
[30:04] are are you like Jeremiah or Hagee I I
[30:08] said I'm a hagamine
[30:13] agamine right
[30:16] hagamaya
[30:18] there I am hagemaya all right let's read
[30:21] this this is pretty good uh scripture I
[30:24] I think it's something that will bless
[30:26] our hearts he said
[30:29] the word of the Lord came to Joel the
[30:33] son of
[30:35] vanilla I'll hear this ye old men and
[30:40] give ear all ye inhabitants of the land
[30:43] hath this men in your days or even in
[30:48] the days of your fathers
[30:51] tell ye your children of it and let your
[30:54] children tell their children and their
[30:57] children another generation
[31:00] that which the Palmer worm hath left
[31:03] half the locus eaten and that which the
[31:08] locusts have left half the cankerworm
[31:12] eaten
[31:13] and that which the canker worm have left
[31:17] the caterpillar hath eaten
[31:21] Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your
[31:24] word in Jesus precious name we pray amen
[31:28] amen let's also turn over uh if we could
[31:32] uh
[31:34] you may be seated
[31:40] I believe it's the book of
[31:43] Colossians
[31:45] and um
[31:47] let me see if I can
[31:50] find that scripture here in the book of
[31:53] Colossians
[31:54] we'd like to read
[31:57] let me see if I can find it here
[32:02] I don't think I can find it but so we'll
[32:05] just read the one that we have in Jude
[32:07] uh the first uh Jude chapter and of
[32:12] course you know that there's only one
[32:13] chapter in Jude
[32:15] and it says beloved
[32:18] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[32:21] you of the common salvation
[32:23] as it was needed for me to write unto
[32:26] you and exhort you that ye should
[32:30] earnestly contend for the faith which
[32:34] was once delivered to the Saints and uh
[32:39] and so what what brought this
[32:43] thought on my heart
[32:45] was you know we just came out of some
[32:48] wonderful meetings I thought they were
[32:49] wonderful meetings they knew that
[32:51] presence the Lord was there and our our
[32:55] faith has been lifted up
[32:57] and we know that we've been studying and
[33:01] talking about faith because without
[33:03] faith it's impossible to please the Lord
[33:07] and the Lord wants us to believe he
[33:10] wants us to believe that all things are
[33:12] possible
[33:13] he wants us to believe that
[33:16] that whatever that he has for you is
[33:21] yours to have
[33:22] he wants you to be short of nothing he
[33:26] wants you to reach all the fullness of
[33:29] your potential in fact it's the father's
[33:32] perfect will that he gives the children
[33:35] the kingdom and so he he wants to do
[33:38] more for us than I think that we even
[33:41] comprehend that he wants to do for us
[33:45] and so he's looking for a church that he
[33:49] can have fellowship with and and of
[33:52] course the enemy is always there like a
[33:55] roaring lion and trying to
[33:58] devour us and so when we read this uh
[34:04] little scripture here and the thought
[34:06] that comes we find out that the the
[34:10] enemy is always trying to eat away at
[34:15] the church he doesn't you know he he
[34:18] doesn't just always come with a like a
[34:22] great big smack you know what I mean or
[34:25] try to knock you out all at once he just
[34:27] eats at you and eats at you and eats at
[34:31] you and just kind of choose uh choose
[34:34] you down and down and then you pretty
[34:37] soon you don't have any remembrance of
[34:41] what that you were and I think that's
[34:45] the saddest
[34:48] part about
[34:49] being backslid or getting away from the
[34:52] Lord is that you forget what he once
[34:56] were and that's what happened to the
[34:59] church the church forgot once what they
[35:02] once were and so even Jude is the last
[35:07] uh book in the Bible before the Book of
[35:10] Revelation so we know that some time had
[35:13] passed in the church and he's saying
[35:16] Church we've got to contend for the
[35:19] faith that was once delivered to the
[35:22] Saints in other words things are
[35:24] slipping away the other writers write
[35:27] James and those right you know he says
[35:30] there's spots and wrinkles in our Feast
[35:32] they've cometh amongst us and and
[35:35] they're they're eating away at us
[35:37] they're they're trying to take us away
[35:39] from what made us what that we are and
[35:43] so we we in the church wanting to rise
[35:48] up and and I think we we feel that in
[35:50] our heart we feel that God opens the
[35:53] word to us that he's he's trying to let
[35:56] us know that he's here for us to do for
[35:58] us exceedingly and abundantly above what
[36:01] we can even ask or think he he doesn't
[36:04] want us to be cowardly he doesn't want
[36:07] us to be weak he wants us to be strong
[36:10] he wants us to be full of Might he wants
[36:13] us to take pleasure in him and his word
[36:17] and so uh in this little sermon that
[36:21] came on my heart as I and I hope that
[36:24] you can go home and and maybe read it
[36:26] this week and and listen to it and study
[36:29] a little bit but it's called The Palmer
[36:32] worm the Locust the cata uh the canker
[36:35] worm and the caterpillar and so that
[36:37] that's what uh and and in this thing I'm
[36:41] just going to take a little bit of it
[36:43] tonight and just fellowship with you I
[36:46] was telling the brothers in the back
[36:47] he's I says you know it's been a while
[36:49] well since I preached and I don't know
[36:52] if I can do it anymore and uh you know
[36:55] so I I hope that I can get this across
[36:59] and then I'm heading towards uh Phoenix
[37:02] this weekend to preacher
[37:06] a banquet I never preached a banquet in
[37:09] my life I had to go get a pair of tux
[37:12] and a formal banquet and I thought well
[37:15] my goodness by the time I get up there
[37:18] I'll have gravy spilled all over on me
[37:21] and if everything you know what I mean
[37:23] and what do you tell so it's old people
[37:27] that that have been married
[37:30] 40 years and older that has been married
[37:34] now anybody that's been married that
[37:36] long knows that you ain't gonna tell
[37:39] them nothing
[37:40] and secondly I've been married 50 some
[37:44] years and I still can't figure it out
[37:47] so you know it's what do you do you you
[37:51] know you you just go by faith right and
[37:54] you trust that God did it and then
[37:56] they're going to have another uh service
[37:58] with uh I guess young married couples
[38:01] and uh it's been so long since I've been
[38:05] young married I forgot what that's like
[38:07] but I know one thing hasn't changed and
[38:10] that's God's word so if you ever prayed
[38:13] for me you prayed for me this weekend
[38:15] you know what I mean because I'll tell
[38:18] you that's out of my comfort zone I'm
[38:21] not very comfortable with uh situations
[38:24] like that and and uh but we just trust
[38:27] that the Lord will do something and and
[38:30] forward so we want to think just a
[38:33] moment because I think it's our hearts
[38:36] desire that
[38:38] we don't want to be a people that's
[38:41] always up and down
[38:43] you know what I'm saying we want to get
[38:45] to that place where we're strong and and
[38:48] we want if I I'm going to say this and I
[38:51] know it's going to sound not sound of
[38:54] the right way and I hope it's taken the
[38:56] right way but the church has got to get
[39:00] weaned off of preachers
[39:03] can I say that that way you know what I
[39:06] mean that that that when we come
[39:09] together to gather around the word of
[39:11] God we we come up as peers we come as
[39:15] equals we come fellowshipped each one's
[39:19] bringing something uh uh to the meal
[39:22] that it's not just a a one cook it's a
[39:26] it's a spiritual potluck you know and uh
[39:30] people have testimonies in their heart
[39:32] and they have the love of God in their
[39:35] heart and they they know they have
[39:37] something that's radiating them because
[39:39] God done something for him
[39:42] in their day and and it's a wonderful
[39:47] time to be a Christian and so the the
[39:50] church is is rising up to a place where
[39:54] it it's not just sitting there and
[39:58] absorbing sermons the prophet of God uh
[40:01] approached that in the church Church age
[40:03] book you know that you just sit there
[40:06] and try to absorb but we want to move
[40:08] past that as individuals we want to be
[40:11] able to know that we're positioned right
[40:14] in the Lord and our hearts right with
[40:16] God and and God's dealing with us and
[40:19] and we're we're listening and hearing
[40:22] from them and it's it's not always
[40:25] getting up out of the mud but it's it's
[40:27] coming up and saying Lord what can I do
[40:30] for you today oh oh give me an
[40:33] opportunity to witness give me an
[40:35] opportunity to help something there's a
[40:37] confidence that that is around the
[40:40] believer and around their experience and
[40:44] around their fellowship with the lord
[40:46] they're confident that their sins are
[40:49] forgiven they're confident that they
[40:51] love the Lord and they're confident that
[40:53] God loves them
[40:58] that he'll never leave you nor forsake
[41:01] you and it's not built on something that
[41:05] you have some ability you have or some
[41:08] great spiritual uh spirituality that you
[41:13] have it's based on what he did for you
[41:16] and you're in love with what he did for
[41:19] you and you haven't forgot that
[41:22] and and that's what uh we find in the
[41:26] scripture always happens that people
[41:29] forget
[41:30] they forget where they come from the
[41:33] scripture says and you know it he says
[41:35] and he wrote in the Statue of a perfect
[41:37] man a man that doesn't add these things
[41:40] and doesn't have these things he's
[41:42] forgot where he's come from
[41:45] I see it all the time people they get in
[41:48] the message after a while and and they
[41:50] came from nothing they didn't even know
[41:52] how to read the Bible they they didn't
[41:55] even know what the Bible said
[41:57] but a Divine interpreter came along
[42:00] began to preach and they could start to
[42:02] read and they could start to set study
[42:05] and all of a sudden they forgot where
[42:07] they got everything you know what I mean
[42:09] they they walk around like you know I
[42:11] got this this is mine and heck and and
[42:14] and it just it doesn't create the
[42:18] atmosphere that the message really
[42:20] wanted to create
[42:23] you know if it wasn't about seeing how
[42:27] many uh you know what influence you
[42:30] could have
[42:31] you know it's about kind of atmosphere
[42:34] do you create
[42:36] and I love that we've always been told
[42:39] that that a great person makes everybody
[42:43] around them feel great
[42:46] you know they're secure
[42:48] I know they talk about wealthy men and
[42:51] and and how so many of them are ordinary
[42:54] drove the same pickup truck lived in the
[42:57] same house you know what I mean they
[42:59] they didn't have nothing to show they
[43:01] they realized that that they're blessed
[43:05] and you know the scripture tells us that
[43:08] we should be content in whatever state
[43:11] that we're in
[43:12] even Texas when it's hot
[43:15] and so we these things that that are are
[43:22] stored up
[43:23] in the house for us the storehouse of
[43:26] God's word they're really they're
[43:29] they're so beautifully placed to meet
[43:32] every challenge that comes upon us and
[43:36] this the word of God tells us that all
[43:38] scriptures has given us first
[43:40] instruction
[43:42] reproof of sin for wisdom and for
[43:45] knowledge and and so we we find out that
[43:49] in order for the church to get back to
[43:53] what it was in the beginning and to be
[43:55] restored back because we if even as we
[43:58] heard a Sunday about the the restoration
[44:02] of it is that's what Malachi 4 was
[44:04] forced to restore back the faith
[44:08] that our fathers had
[44:11] and we just since we've been talking
[44:13] about faith and Billy's beautiful
[44:15] message on faith by love and we don't
[44:19] want to leave that thing
[44:21] because you can't build on anything
[44:25] unless you have the right foundation the
[44:28] foundation is the it is the most
[44:31] important thing of anything that you
[44:35] build
[44:36] ick and the the greatest house with the
[44:39] greatest work and the greatest uh
[44:42] carpentry and the greatest stone work in
[44:45] everything if that Foundation isn't on
[44:47] Bedrock it'll crack
[44:49] then it'll falter so let this talk
[44:53] because this Joel's telling us here that
[44:56] that it's going to be eaten so I want to
[44:59] just read a little bit to you have a
[45:02] little short moment of Fellowship
[45:05] he says now this scripture that Joel
[45:09] spoke
[45:10] of is fulfilled today as we the Gentiles
[45:15] have received it
[45:18] so this is fulfilled today that this
[45:21] eating is going on and uh you know I I
[45:27] never thought in my lifetime that that
[45:31] my a house that I had ever would ever
[45:33] have termites
[45:35] and one day I was there and and
[45:39] Leslie looked up in her bathroom cabinet
[45:42] says oh what this paint looks like it's
[45:44] bubbling so you know I went to touch it
[45:46] and I pushed my finger right through the
[45:48] cabinet
[45:50] and I looked and then I got and I looked
[45:53] back and I took it down I had termites
[45:56] and without even realizing it
[46:00] all the outside looked good
[46:03] but it was eating at the inside
[46:07] and that's what happens to Believers the
[46:10] outside looks good the the daily actions
[46:14] look good their appearances look good
[46:17] but but it's on the inside that Satan
[46:20] eats at you it eats on your emotions it
[46:23] eats on your feelings it eats on your
[46:26] your thinking it eats on your faith so
[46:28] you know someone could be on the outside
[46:30] could be fine but on the inside there
[46:33] there they're all tore up
[46:38] you know so uh and that's a trouble
[46:41] sometime with the church as long as
[46:43] everything looks good you know we we
[46:45] don't want anybody to come in that maybe
[46:48] that's uh doesn't look just right
[46:50] because you know we we want our outside
[46:54] to look good
[46:56] but you know if your inside is right the
[46:58] outside don't bother you
[47:01] because you've got a confidence that the
[47:04] same God that cleansed you up can
[47:07] cleanse the other person up you're
[47:10] welcome you're not ashamed of the Gospel
[47:12] what will you think you know oh you know
[47:15] if somebody came into our church and
[47:17] like in a pair of pants or something a
[47:21] lady or something or maybe her hair
[47:23] wasn't as long as we wear our hair oh
[47:25] those people
[47:27] forget those people every single one of
[47:31] us should say a soul is going to be
[47:33] saved today oh God Quicken their heart
[47:36] deal with them that that's not going to
[47:39] hurt me
[47:41] why because I have a promise right
[47:44] nothing can plucked me out of the palm
[47:47] of his hand look we we got to understand
[47:50] that these there A lot of times what's
[47:53] being eaten at is not on the outside
[47:57] it's on the inside it's what's going on
[48:00] in our hearts in fact what's going on in
[48:03] our minds and Satan gets in our minds
[48:05] and if if we let something in our mind
[48:08] that's not right if it drops into our
[48:11] heart and our thinking's not right our
[48:13] attitude's not right our approach isn't
[48:16] right and uh and and everything's kind
[48:20] of thing but yet we can maintain a good
[48:23] posture
[48:24] how are you today fine fine
[48:27] you know how many people have taken
[48:30] their lives and everybody around them
[48:32] was totally astounded
[48:38] because we get content
[48:41] and so we we want to we want to
[48:45] work on the Inside Man
[48:49] on the inside person
[48:51] that the love of God is shed abroad in
[48:54] our heart that our judgments are right
[48:56] our our
[48:59] discernments are according to God's word
[49:02] that that were full of grace and we're
[49:06] full of compassion again that we're
[49:09] we're really possessing uh fruits
[49:13] in real fruits Christian fruits
[49:16] christ-like fruits you know that that
[49:21] that's the love of How It's manifested
[49:23] is that as he is so are we in this world
[49:26] so we want to talk about this eating
[49:29] because we want to have faith we want to
[49:31] have a church that has an atmosphere
[49:35] that all things are possible
[49:38] not a bunch of politics and you know I
[49:41] get so tired of brother McGary reading
[49:44] quotes because he can't read and he
[49:46] pronounces everything wrong you think I
[49:49] I put the quotes up on I put the quotes
[49:51] on the board see that I'm not
[49:53] responsible
[49:57] you know what I mean because hey I I
[49:59] know I can't read but anyway and we're
[50:02] going to try to read so okay so the
[50:04] first thing we understand that he said
[50:06] all the pump worm can't worm all these
[50:09] things eaten
[50:10] okay it's today
[50:14] so we know he's eating today so we know
[50:18] if if he if if he doesn't he eats what
[50:22] he can't consume
[50:25] then the next one consumes and the next
[50:28] one consumes so sometimes Clayton drives
[50:31] you down to a hole and all of a sudden
[50:34] he backs off
[50:36] but you've become content in that state
[50:41] you know and just because you got to
[50:44] reprieve and that he's no longer working
[50:47] on you you think okay now I'm okay no
[50:51] you want to get back what he took
[50:56] you want to get back everything he took
[50:59] from you because then he he goes off and
[51:03] then the next one comes and it starts
[51:07] eating well because you you had this
[51:10] first one eating at you and he's gone
[51:13] you don't recognize when the next one's
[51:16] there
[51:18] and he's just slowly chewing away not at
[51:22] the outside
[51:23] on the outside now look at the outside
[51:25] oh we're building the church and people
[51:27] are coming and wow it's good and we have
[51:30] me on the outside
[51:33] it looks like you got a A revival going
[51:37] on
[51:38] but if the people
[51:40] aren't having their hearts changed on
[51:43] the inside it's just fakeness
[51:50] you know I mean so we want to deal with
[51:53] the real thing
[51:56] so this is paragraph of 46 and 47. and
[52:01] so we're just going to talk a little bit
[52:03] and fellowship a little bit so you
[52:06] understand uh
[52:08] where my whole heart is
[52:10] where it is as the pastor what What
[52:14] fields that I I want to lead the flock
[52:17] into I don't want to lead them into more
[52:20] Revelation and more explanation
[52:24] you know what I mean I I don't want to
[52:25] spend my my Ministry
[52:28] continually preaching the son of man
[52:31] that God came into deity and where we
[52:34] are I want something that's living on
[52:38] the hearts of the believer
[52:40] and I want every I want every uh member
[52:46] of our fellowship to be more fruitful
[52:51] than I ever was and to receive the full
[52:54] wages
[52:56] no matter what hour
[52:58] that you started to work in
[53:01] so he says now he says and these insects
[53:05] if you'll get your book on insects
[53:09] you'll notice that four different
[53:12] insects is the self same insect in four
[53:17] different stages of its life
[53:21] okay so this is the person that's eating
[53:24] at us so we know who that is right
[53:27] but it commit he he comes in different
[53:30] stages
[53:31] that he says
[53:33] of his life and
[53:36] all of us know
[53:38] that a cocoon is nothing but a
[53:40] caterpillar covered over and it's going
[53:43] to hatch out a butterfly and the
[53:45] Butterfly is a caterpillar before it
[53:48] hatches out the Palm worm the locus and
[53:52] so forth is the same it's the self same
[53:55] insect
[53:56] now whatever now listen close
[54:00] whatever happened in the first place
[54:03] with the insect of the Palmer worm is
[54:07] just become a caterpillar and the
[54:10] caterpillar become a locust later and
[54:13] whatever it it was that started in the
[54:17] beginning is still the same things
[54:20] that's causing the trouble today
[54:25] and let's go back now to the scriptures
[54:28] and find out what started
[54:31] so it doesn't matter its purpose
[54:36] of all those stages okay to self same
[54:40] thing it's the same thing that's causing
[54:42] the trouble so it doesn't matter okay
[54:44] you know brother Matt and Thomas and I
[54:47] was fellowship and he looked over me
[54:48] says I said you know you when you think
[54:50] about it David he says
[54:53] the word hasn't changed
[54:55] man hasn't changed
[54:57] it's still the same
[55:00] oh man's been the same and God's been
[55:03] the same
[55:04] so whatever troubles we have
[55:07] they've come and and and they come but
[55:11] the blessings of God are the same
[55:14] so we're talking about now we're just
[55:16] going to go quickly here says now listen
[55:18] close
[55:20] whatever happens in the first place the
[55:22] impound is the same find outstandard Now
[55:25] 49 now we know that we can only build a
[55:31] church
[55:32] first upon the material that God gave us
[55:37] to build it
[55:39] with
[55:43] think about that
[55:45] you can't bring nothing else in not
[55:48] psychology not science you know we've
[55:51] been trying to look for lighting for the
[55:53] church and so I go to these places and
[55:56] everybody wants us to you know have a
[55:58] light show
[56:01] you know spotlights and and things and
[56:05] they keep sending me videos and pictures
[56:07] you know what I mean of the backdrops
[56:10] and these big screens and and and
[56:13] everything was like they want me to get
[56:15] a guitar or something you know and turn
[56:18] into a a rock star preacher that ain't
[56:20] how the church started
[56:28] so he he says that you gotta build with
[56:31] what God gave us to build with
[56:35] he didn't give us fancy words
[56:38] he didn't give us psychology he built
[56:42] the church with the power and
[56:44] demonstration of the Holy Spirit that's
[56:46] what he built the church with he built
[56:49] the church proving that he's resurrected
[56:52] from the dead he proved the church to
[56:55] proved that the church was built that he
[56:58] didn't leave us
[57:01] but he was still with us
[57:04] back what the church was built on
[57:06] so just think of it if you want to build
[57:10] yourself up spiritually
[57:13] and and really be restored
[57:17] and have the cleansing Start From the
[57:20] Inside Out you've got to use the
[57:23] material that God gave you to build with
[57:29] don't leave it
[57:31] it's the same material that Peter had
[57:35] that James and John that they had in the
[57:39] beginning
[57:40] it hasn't changed Satan it changed all
[57:44] the surroundings around us for the one
[57:47] purpose to try to get us to think that
[57:50] the original material won't work
[57:53] but praise God for a prophet Malachi 4 5
[57:57] came and proved us that he was the same
[58:01] yesterday and ever and that the same
[58:03] word worked
[58:05] to get us back to the word
[58:09] amen so look what he does it's beautiful
[58:11] I love it forgive me
[58:13] he had that God gave Spirit that's all
[58:16] we have
[58:17] and I think I know this is strong
[58:22] and it's on tape hundreds of people
[58:25] around the world will hear it
[58:27] but before we can ever have
[58:30] a building of the Church of God we have
[58:34] to restore back all those things that
[58:39] these insects has eaten out of it we'll
[58:42] have to go back and find out what the
[58:46] insects eaten
[58:47] and I we're not going to go into that
[58:49] all all the depth of it I hope you can
[58:52] go back personally and do that we'll
[58:55] have to go back and find out what the
[58:58] insect eat
[58:59] and before this Vine of the Lord the
[59:03] caterpillar he's
[59:06] divine
[59:08] were the branches and before we can ever
[59:12] find out
[59:14] or the church can stand
[59:17] in its formal and original Power it'll
[59:22] have to go back and find out what the
[59:25] insect eat and the church will have to
[59:28] be restored back to that and it will
[59:33] never stand in its power and Glory of
[59:37] its first standing
[59:39] so those things have taken something
[59:42] away from the church
[59:45] so the biggest thing is that man just
[59:48] moves on and they get content
[59:52] and they go so far and they get content
[59:54] they get so far I I don't think we
[59:57] should be content until every one of our
[1:00:00] children every one of the people that
[1:00:03] will come in contact have the gift of
[1:00:06] God
[1:00:07] which is the Holy Spirit
[1:00:12] we we
[1:00:14] got to get Beyond Survival
[1:00:18] you know to be a real working believer
[1:00:23] fitted and joined together each one
[1:00:26] supplying the need of the others that's
[1:00:29] the church and I know Satan locks us
[1:00:32] into our personal struggles and our
[1:00:34] emotional struggles and like I said he's
[1:00:37] destroying us on the inside
[1:00:40] and that's what we're just talking a
[1:00:42] little bit about this evening is if if
[1:00:45] the inside God works from the inside out
[1:00:50] the church world and religion works from
[1:00:54] the outside in
[1:00:58] like I say it's like we want everything
[1:01:01] that we want to be well before we take
[1:01:04] the medicine
[1:01:06] the best time to take the medicine is
[1:01:08] when you're sick the best time to repent
[1:01:11] is when you're in the Sin
[1:01:16] you know there's no past it's like some
[1:01:20] belated card
[1:01:22] so we want to stash just now if the bark
[1:01:25] is torn off
[1:01:27] of a tree we've got to get barked back
[1:01:31] on it again
[1:01:34] grow the bark first you can't have
[1:01:37] apples until you grow the Bark for the
[1:01:40] bark is the sap line and the sap line is
[1:01:44] the lifeline
[1:01:46] and the scriptures God's holy Bible is
[1:01:50] the lifeline to any church
[1:01:56] so think of it if you're out of
[1:01:59] fellowship with your Bible you're out of
[1:02:02] Fellowship
[1:02:03] with your lifeline
[1:02:06] because the scriptures are given
[1:02:09] to supply life to you
[1:02:12] not the carnal life but the life to the
[1:02:16] inward man that inward man that inward
[1:02:18] person so with that inward person so
[1:02:21] built up you're so confident in the
[1:02:24] promises of God that you really aren't
[1:02:27] so hung up on what your outside looks
[1:02:30] like
[1:02:32] and I'll tell you I got news for y'all
[1:02:35] it's a news flash
[1:02:38] if the Lord doesn't come you'll all die
[1:02:48] unless you're born again
[1:02:50] and then the first death won't harm you
[1:02:55] but you don't want the second death
[1:03:02] he said
[1:03:04] he said
[1:03:07] you got to bring it
[1:03:09] through the he's he was right here
[1:03:15] um because I'm 51.
[1:03:17] okay
[1:03:19] if the bark is tore off we've got to get
[1:03:21] it back on it again grow the bark first
[1:03:25] you can't have apples until you grow the
[1:03:27] bark the bark is the sap line the sap
[1:03:30] line is the lifeline and the scriptures
[1:03:32] God's holy Bible is the lifeline to any
[1:03:36] church how could we ever bring up grape
[1:03:39] sap through Sycamore bark
[1:03:42] it won't work we've got to have
[1:03:45] Grapevine bark we've got to have the
[1:03:49] original bar there's only one way that
[1:03:53] that bark can ever come back to the Vine
[1:03:57] is when God grows it himself
[1:04:04] think of it
[1:04:06] all the preaching is just to let you
[1:04:10] know that there's a God that can grow it
[1:04:13] but God's got to grow it himself
[1:04:18] in other words if the meeting doesn't
[1:04:20] grow it
[1:04:22] the meeting might provide the atmosphere
[1:04:26] that God can grow it but it's got to be
[1:04:30] God growing the bark
[1:04:33] or the lifeline and you've got to know
[1:04:35] it's God you've got to know God did this
[1:04:38] God did this
[1:04:40] I didn't join this I didn't a part of it
[1:04:43] the church didn't do it God did it God
[1:04:46] dealt with me God healed me God touched
[1:04:49] me God convicted me God spoke to my
[1:04:52] heart praise God I'm in fellowship with
[1:04:55] God God's real and he's alive
[1:04:59] but God's got to do it
[1:05:03] and you can't look
[1:05:05] for anybody else to do it
[1:05:08] the best thing somebody could tell you
[1:05:11] is what the scripture said
[1:05:14] and we know that the message of the hour
[1:05:17] is the scriptures interpreted
[1:05:20] I'm not separating her they're wanting
[1:05:23] the same thing it's what was written
[1:05:26] made flesh
[1:05:27] just like Jesus said search the
[1:05:29] scriptures they speak of me
[1:05:32] you know I have not come to destroy the
[1:05:34] law but I've come to fulfill it we've
[1:05:36] seen the Fulfillment of scripture in our
[1:05:39] day but God's got to grow it
[1:05:44] and if we're not careful we we start
[1:05:47] looking out across the Realms of the
[1:05:50] carnal world and looking for Solutions
[1:05:54] I've seen people come up with all kinds
[1:05:56] of solutions if I go here if I do this
[1:05:59] if I do that
[1:06:01] you know it's Human Nature
[1:06:03] but the bottom line is the first church
[1:06:06] was what it was because God made it what
[1:06:09] it was
[1:06:11] and when we can get in our heart Lord I
[1:06:13] want you to make me
[1:06:17] I want you to put the bark on me
[1:06:21] and sometimes he's got to take the old
[1:06:23] hide off before he can put the new bark
[1:06:25] on but that's all right
[1:06:28] right that's we're okay with that
[1:06:31] right so he says
[1:06:37] he says is when God grows it himself we
[1:06:41] cannot make
[1:06:43] some we can't make some and put on it it
[1:06:47] won't work no man-made skiing will ever
[1:06:51] work it'll take God's way or it'll never
[1:06:55] live mandate schemes will not work you
[1:06:58] might wrap a rag around the tree and say
[1:07:01] Let It Grow the rag wasn't God's program
[1:07:05] it's got to be bark lifeline and when it
[1:07:10] comes from its roots it'll produce the
[1:07:13] same life that the tree had before the
[1:07:16] insect ate it
[1:07:19] that's pretty good
[1:07:21] yeah right because isn't that really
[1:07:23] what we're all we're all talking about
[1:07:27] isn't this really what the church is the
[1:07:30] gospel is we're trying to get back
[1:07:34] to what our fathers had
[1:07:37] and they knew Jesus personally
[1:07:40] they know what he was they know what he
[1:07:43] said they understand the gift of the
[1:07:46] Holy Spirit they knew the Holy Spirit
[1:07:48] was to lead them and guide them for
[1:07:50] bring them in remembrance of all the
[1:07:52] things that father the father had told
[1:07:55] them in fact they counted on him
[1:08:00] and let's just listen to this little
[1:08:02] I'll try to close up real quick
[1:08:05] he said
[1:08:06] this is paragraph 65. I'm going to drive
[1:08:09] this down and I want you to listen
[1:08:13] let it be God truth
[1:08:16] let
[1:08:17] it's line up with what God Said
[1:08:20] regardless of what anybody else said
[1:08:24] I want to use four different things or
[1:08:27] what I see in the scriptures that these
[1:08:30] insects has eaten off of the Church of
[1:08:33] the Living God and has got the vine of
[1:08:37] God crippled or stunted
[1:08:41] you never say you weren't the Vine
[1:08:44] so these things are crippling the church
[1:08:48] he said
[1:08:50] paragraph 610 now let us go back I want
[1:08:54] to name four things just as scripture as
[1:08:58] I know how to
[1:09:00] to be that these insects has eaten from
[1:09:03] the church
[1:09:04] from its first original
[1:09:09] condition
[1:09:10] and that's what we want to just spend
[1:09:13] just a second on tonight the original
[1:09:15] condition
[1:09:17] what was the condition of the original
[1:09:21] church and what made the church be like
[1:09:24] that
[1:09:25] he said
[1:09:27] now the first thing the church was
[1:09:29] established on the day of Pentecost
[1:09:31] Peter preached the inaugural sermon
[1:09:34] at the
[1:09:37] baculatoria service when the church was
[1:09:40] born the Christian church was born on
[1:09:44] the day of Pentecost and if God is
[1:09:47] infinite
[1:09:49] is infinite
[1:09:52] and cannot change his church must remain
[1:09:56] as it was at the beginning do you admit
[1:10:01] that
[1:10:02] congregation says amen paragraph 71. So
[1:10:07] what we're finding now is that it has to
[1:10:11] be
[1:10:12] the original Foundation
[1:10:15] and so
[1:10:18] when the church started
[1:10:21] they were
[1:10:23] faced up against the great persecution
[1:10:26] they're locked up in an upper room
[1:10:29] right but they have a promise
[1:10:32] he said you go there and wait until
[1:10:36] you're endued with power on high I will
[1:10:40] not leave you comfortless I will come
[1:10:43] again and be with you even in you
[1:10:47] another is I I'm I I'm not going to
[1:10:50] separate from you I am the vine ye are
[1:10:54] the branches
[1:10:55] the branches for all the life from the
[1:10:59] vine the church was there they had made
[1:11:02] their stand they believed them they're
[1:11:04] locked up in an upper room they're
[1:11:06] afraid they don't know they're hearing
[1:11:09] stories are flying around about things
[1:11:12] going on and then all of a sudden his
[1:11:16] presence comes in and now they're
[1:11:20] they're they felt his presence and they
[1:11:24] know it's him
[1:11:27] it's not a third person
[1:11:30] it's not it's not uh a sensation it's
[1:11:35] him he's there in spirit form
[1:11:41] I I will not leave your forsake I'll
[1:11:44] come again I'll be with you I'll send
[1:11:45] the comforter the spirit of Truth well
[1:11:49] who what did he say I am the way the
[1:11:52] what the truth the spirit of the truth
[1:11:55] The Same Spirit that's in me that made
[1:11:58] me what I am you can look at a man and
[1:12:01] see that I was just a Man From Galilee
[1:12:04] there is no difference in me but there
[1:12:06] was a spirit in me that made me
[1:12:09] different that was my father's spirit
[1:12:11] and I'm going to send that Spirit back
[1:12:15] on you it's a free gift
[1:12:22] now that was their comfort
[1:12:26] because that
[1:12:28] what their faith
[1:12:31] was built in
[1:12:33] their faith was built in the presence of
[1:12:37] the Lord
[1:12:40] it wasn't built on what we sometimes
[1:12:43] think of just the scriptures because
[1:12:46] they had the law
[1:12:49] and they had the teachings
[1:12:53] but there's no way you can make those
[1:12:55] teachings work
[1:12:57] so what their faith was built on the
[1:13:01] very Foundation that the church was
[1:13:03] built on was the presence of the Lord
[1:13:07] and their fellowship with that presence
[1:13:11] that's what they were Anchored In
[1:13:15] they had Fellowship
[1:13:18] in his presence
[1:13:20] and I I encourage you to go
[1:13:23] read this more so that was the
[1:13:26] foundation
[1:13:28] paragraph 77. now the first thing I'd
[1:13:32] like to speak to you for a few minutes
[1:13:34] is after we have found out the
[1:13:37] foundation
[1:13:39] must be original it must go back to the
[1:13:42] foundation it must go back to where it
[1:13:46] was a Vine something is wrong with it
[1:13:50] and the vine is not operating right
[1:13:53] let's go back and find out what's wrong
[1:13:58] so what's wrong is they were built on
[1:14:01] faith
[1:14:03] that's what the church is built on
[1:14:06] we want to build it on a lot of other
[1:14:09] things
[1:14:11] but the the church is individuals fitted
[1:14:15] and joined together each of us having
[1:14:17] faith so that's what Jude said let's
[1:14:20] contend for the faith what was the faith
[1:14:23] that they had their faith was in the
[1:14:26] presence of God with them they knew he
[1:14:29] was with them
[1:14:33] they knew he was there
[1:14:36] they knew their experience was real
[1:14:39] they knew he said he'd never leave them
[1:14:42] nor forsake them
[1:14:44] they could count on them
[1:14:49] they didn't need sensation they knew he
[1:14:52] was there because he said so
[1:14:56] they knew he wasn't far away
[1:14:59] he they knew he was watching
[1:15:02] they knew he knew what their needs were
[1:15:04] what their sufferings were they they
[1:15:08] knew that that that he promised them
[1:15:12] that he would lead them and guide them
[1:15:14] that's what they Anchored In I'm telling
[1:15:18] you sometimes we try to Anchor our faith
[1:15:20] in our own life
[1:15:23] our own Works what we see in the mirror
[1:15:26] how we're living
[1:15:29] well that Faith changes every day this
[1:15:32] Faith doesn't change
[1:15:34] the faith of the believer is they know
[1:15:37] that he's there with you he's there with
[1:15:40] you he paid the price for you well you
[1:15:43] were yet sinner he died for you and if
[1:15:45] you fail he said if you cry Abba Father
[1:15:48] and repent I'm there to just the full
[1:15:52] and Faithfully forgive you so the church
[1:15:55] was built on that
[1:15:57] it was their Foundation when he came in
[1:16:00] that upper room they knew he was here
[1:16:04] and when they went out they said men and
[1:16:07] Brethren they're not drunk this is what
[1:16:08] was promised to Joel I'll pour out my
[1:16:11] spirit he's here he's present he poured
[1:16:15] his Spirit out on us
[1:16:18] they knew it
[1:16:22] now can you imagine
[1:16:24] each of you here tonight
[1:16:26] knowing he's there with you
[1:16:33] when that pipe blew up Tim and all that
[1:16:35] steam come pouring out there weren't you
[1:16:37] glad he was there
[1:16:39] you could look a lot worse than you do
[1:16:42] right now
[1:16:43] that's her hope
[1:16:45] that's where our faith is our faith
[1:16:47] isn't in our Doctrine our faith is in
[1:16:49] his presence it's in him
[1:16:52] that's what that and that's the first
[1:16:55] thing that Satan tried to eat away from
[1:16:58] the church is the presence of God with
[1:17:01] them
[1:17:02] the days of Miracles has passed the
[1:17:05] things he does fast like now we're going
[1:17:07] to get in on our intellect
[1:17:09] I don't know about you guys but my
[1:17:12] intellect is starting to suffer
[1:17:17] ask anybody that's around me
[1:17:21] he says paragraph 81 and the faith of
[1:17:24] the Saints was not in creeds
[1:17:27] not in denominations not in church
[1:17:30] buildings not in associations but in the
[1:17:35] presence of the Living God hallelujah
[1:17:42] so now you know I didn't make that up
[1:17:44] I love perching it
[1:17:46] but I didn't make it up that's what he
[1:17:49] said
[1:17:51] so when you start looking out at people
[1:17:53] that are hurting and being destroyed on
[1:17:56] the inside you know the first problem is
[1:17:59] is they don't know he's with them
[1:18:04] they think he's forsaken them
[1:18:07] remember when the prophet of God was
[1:18:09] sitting by his little baby's bed
[1:18:12] the first thing that Satan tried to
[1:18:14] tempt him with was he's not with you he
[1:18:18] doesn't love you he's not here anymore
[1:18:21] but he said something welled up inside
[1:18:24] of me because he knew he meant them
[1:18:27] and he said though he slayed me yet will
[1:18:30] I serve him
[1:18:33] so we're talking about faith
[1:18:37] a people that has Faith a people that
[1:18:40] has confidence a people that hearts are
[1:18:44] not condemning them because he's greater
[1:18:47] than your heart
[1:18:49] and the first church was built on on the
[1:18:53] faith of his presence
[1:18:56] and we'll just close here he says that
[1:18:59] but in the presence of the Living God
[1:19:02] they had Faith to heal the sick cast out
[1:19:06] Devils do Miracles and all these great
[1:19:09] promises that Jesus made the first
[1:19:12] church held on to that it was the life
[1:19:17] line listen here listen close to what
[1:19:21] I'm telling you the ever presence of the
[1:19:24] Living God is the lifeline of any church
[1:19:29] or any bunch of people the ever presence
[1:19:34] of the Living God to perform and to do
[1:19:38] and to act and to live with the people
[1:19:42] as he did at the beginning
[1:19:49] how many loves that
[1:19:53] isn't that beautiful
[1:19:56] let's lay it down a little more
[1:20:00] if the presence of the Living God
[1:20:02] brought a Pentecostal with power and
[1:20:07] signs and wonders and brought a people
[1:20:10] to the full glory of God till they
[1:20:14] shouted spoke with other languages and
[1:20:17] went and martyred for the faith let's
[1:20:20] earnestly contend for that Faith until
[1:20:24] death shall set us free earnestly
[1:20:27] contend for it we will not compromise
[1:20:30] upon reading books taking some man-made
[1:20:34] theology will not compromise upon some
[1:20:37] Creed or some prayer books or some some
[1:20:40] somebody else has
[1:20:43] said
[1:20:46] what is your faith
[1:20:49] built on
[1:20:51] so if
[1:20:57] it's so simple
[1:20:59] that
[1:21:01] if you don't feel that prison seek it
[1:21:06] knock
[1:21:07] it shall be open seek and you shall find
[1:21:13] but it doesn't matter
[1:21:15] if if you understand all the Mysteries
[1:21:18] and can explain all the Mysteries if if
[1:21:22] you're not confident
[1:21:25] that he's mindful of you
[1:21:28] and that he's present with you
[1:21:31] well let me say it this way if you don't
[1:21:34] know that Satan's robbing that from you
[1:21:37] because he promised he would be
[1:21:41] he's just right here in your life
[1:21:47] but if you're not believing it if you
[1:21:49] don't believe Lord you know I got this
[1:21:51] problem you know I battle this you know
[1:21:54] why
[1:21:56] Satan Works me over you know it just
[1:21:59] takes me one second and I I just I'm
[1:22:02] back where I was at
[1:22:05] I need your help
[1:22:09] he said cast your cares upon me where I
[1:22:12] care for you
[1:22:14] he that is in you is greater than he who
[1:22:16] is in the world
[1:22:19] see if that's what our faith is
[1:22:22] our faith is in his presence his
[1:22:25] presence with the church
[1:22:27] that's why we can pray for the sick not
[1:22:31] because God's given this guy a gift and
[1:22:34] he's got this guy's got a gift and this
[1:22:37] guy's got a gift and now with this gift
[1:22:40] he can heal and with this gift he can
[1:22:42] prophesy and with this gifts he can do
[1:22:45] that and he can do that no no
[1:22:47] no it's because he is here because he
[1:22:51] said he would be here wherever two or
[1:22:54] three are gathered together in my name I
[1:22:56] will be there to perform every word I
[1:23:00] said amen Lord let me recognize your
[1:23:03] presence the prophet of God preached the
[1:23:05] whole message the presence of God
[1:23:07] unrecognized
[1:23:11] I love the messenger he stands there and
[1:23:13] all of a sudden says he's here
[1:23:16] I take every Spirit what did he have his
[1:23:19] faith in he had his faith in the ever
[1:23:22] presence
[1:23:23] glory of the word of God Amen so that's
[1:23:28] just
[1:23:29] where he started
[1:23:31] tearing it away from the church then we
[1:23:35] can go into Fellowship how he broke down
[1:23:37] fellowship and how he broke down this
[1:23:39] and he broke down that and he took it
[1:23:41] all away but remember what he said
[1:23:44] if the church is ever going to return
[1:23:47] back to the original it's going to have
[1:23:50] to remove
[1:23:52] these things that were taken from it
[1:23:57] and the foundation of the perfect man is
[1:24:00] faith faith in what
[1:24:03] we get it faith in what I believe faith
[1:24:06] in what I'm taught no it's faith in his
[1:24:11] presence amen God bless you let's Stand
[1:24:14] Together sorry if I was too long
[1:24:17] you love the word I mean I hope that
[1:24:20] helped you tonight
[1:24:21] that encourage you that if you're
[1:24:24] dealing with the troubles on the inside
[1:24:26] remember he's right there
[1:24:28] he knows what you're thinking he knows
[1:24:31] what's happening on the inside when
[1:24:34] nobody else does all right you got to
[1:24:36] let everybody run out that's running out
[1:24:45] all righty let's bow our heads in prayer
[1:24:48] a gracious Heavenly Father
[1:24:51] we love you
[1:24:54] this evening
[1:24:56] I just hope the word of the Lord that
[1:24:59] your messenger has brought us
[1:25:01] we'll lift them up that they can think
[1:25:04] in their heart and know Lord you're with
[1:25:07] me
[1:25:09] I know your presence is right here
[1:25:14] Lord now I may have not done right
[1:25:18] but I'm inviting you back close to me
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:24] and I want to have faith Lord in knowing
[1:25:28] that you're here
[1:25:32] that every promise in this book is mine
