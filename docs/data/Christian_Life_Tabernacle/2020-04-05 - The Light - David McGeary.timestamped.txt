[3:55] and that's one thing for certain let's
[3:58] pray this morning once again our
[4:01] gracious Heavenly Father Lord here we
[4:07] are just morning in the midst of the
[4:11] lady you'll see an age of people that
[4:14] are blind miserable wretched naked and
[4:21] don't know it
[4:23] and have a claim that they have need of
[4:28] nothing and Lord here we sit so needy of
[4:34] you Nord we just have no hope
[4:43] outside of you
[4:45] nor those that are listening in watching
[4:53] we just ask that you would be our
[4:57] portion and help us father this morning
[5:02] that you would take rain over any
[5:06] difficulty Lord in that you'd make a way
[5:10] for us we ask your blessings now this
[5:14] morning on this service in Jesus
[5:18] precious and Holy Name we pray amen amen
[5:23] lord richly bless you this morning as we
[5:34] yes Lord richly bless you this morning
[5:37] and and this has certainly become a a
[5:40] technical age and it's I was telling
[5:45] someone I said it's hard to pastor an
[5:48] invisible congregation and it's hard to
[5:52] use technology when you're not a
[5:54] technical person so we don't know what
[6:00] all the outcomes of everything is but we
[6:03] just know that we just go forward and
[6:05] that's all that we can do amen it's nice
[6:08] we're going to have some baptisms after
[6:11] the service this morning and people's
[6:15] hearts are desiring God and so we're
[6:18] really looking forward to that this
[6:22] morning amen if we have your Bibles this
[6:25] morning I'd like to turn over into the
[6:28] book of Matthew and read a few
[6:32] scriptures found in the book of Matthew
[6:36] the fourth chapter starting with the
[6:39] twelfth verse and we just like to have
[6:42] just a little Bible study this morning
[6:48] to encourage us in the hour that we're
[6:52] in and with all of our hearts we just
[6:55] trust that the Word of God is our
[6:57] portion and we're going to be
[7:00] ministering this morning out of a
[7:02] message called there is a man here that
[7:06] can turn on the light amen I just felt
[7:10] it was timely for this situation that
[7:14] we're in and we'll just take a small
[7:17] thought from it this morning and because
[7:21] that's about all that we can do is when
[7:26] you're little your thoughts are little
[7:28] and but we have a god that can multiply
[7:31] them amen he took a little bread and a
[7:35] little fish and fed thousands with it so
[7:38] we hope that his word this morning can
[7:40] feed you I know you love his word so
[7:43] let's turn in Matthew and the twelve
[7:47] and we want to read this portion of
[7:53] Scripture and it says in Matthew the
[7:57] fourth chapter in the twelfth first now
[8:00] when Jesus had heard that John was cast
[8:04] into prison he departed into Galilee and
[8:11] leaving nazareth he came in dwelt in
[8:15] Capernaum which is upon the Seacoast in
[8:20] the borders Zebulon and Nephilim that it
[8:27] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[8:31] Isaiah the prophet saying in the land of
[8:36] Zebulun and the land of Neath iam by the
[8:42] way of the sea upon jordan galilee of
[8:47] the gentiles the people which sat in
[8:51] darkness saw great light and to them
[8:55] which sat in the region and shallow of
[9:02] death light sprung up and from that time
[9:07] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[9:12] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[9:17] father we ask you to add your blessing
[9:20] to the reading of the word and we may be
[9:24] with us this morning
[9:26] amen god bless you may be seated this
[9:28] morning amen
[9:31] and if if you happen to be at home and
[9:35] you you have your there's a man that
[9:39] turns on the light I'll refer to a few
[9:43] paragraphs here and there but the we
[9:47] read not realized that the first place
[9:49] that light was ever spoken of was in the
[9:54] book of Genesis in Genesis chapter 1
[10:00] and three and we see the picture that is
[10:05] drawn here that Jesus went to the coast
[10:09] and and he heard that John was put into
[10:12] prison and that must have been the sign
[10:15] to him that it was time for him to start
[10:20] preaching the gospel because John was
[10:23] the forerunner and the forerunner had
[10:26] been taken off the scene now Jesus was
[10:30] going to go out and vindicate improve
[10:33] the things that John had said to be true
[10:38] so the it was time for his ministry to
[10:42] start and so we realized that light that
[10:47] he said the people sat in darkness they
[10:50] they sat in the shallows and swallows of
[10:53] death so they were in a place that in
[10:57] their condition they were a place in
[11:00] their life that they they lacked light
[11:05] they were in darkness and and and being
[11:09] in darkness we know that that left them
[11:12] in a condition they didn't know which
[11:14] way to go which way to turn they were
[11:17] adrift
[11:18] they were just adrift and they couldn't
[11:22] say you can't go in darkness and and so
[11:26] we see in Genesis that the Word of God
[11:29] spoke in Genesis if get said let there
[11:32] be light and so that's the first time
[11:36] that light was spoken of and we know
[11:39] that in the scriptures that we
[11:42] understand that we know what light was
[11:47] because it was the result of what was
[11:51] spoken so the light was the vindication
[11:54] of what was spoken so God said let there
[11:59] be light and then light appeared and so
[12:03] we knew what he meant by light so light
[12:07] was the vindication of what he spoke and
[12:11] what he
[12:13] and so that's the thing that that
[12:17] marvelous that we see that that's what
[12:20] he meant when he said let there be light
[12:24] and you know we kind of have an idea in
[12:29] our mind that when he said let there be
[12:32] light that he created the Sun but that's
[12:36] really not the the truth of light and so
[12:41] if I could read this these great things
[12:45] to you that God has said this is what he
[12:49] said in the 60th 64th paragraph of
[12:54] there's a man that can turn on the light
[12:57] now I believe that the Sun and so forth
[13:01] was already in existence I believe the
[13:05] moon as it goes that those things were
[13:08] already in existence so the Sun was
[13:12] there the stars were there but yet the
[13:15] earth was in darkness so if you could
[13:18] picture the earth being here sitting
[13:21] here like this and over here was the Sun
[13:23] and over here was the moon but yet
[13:26] around all the earth was a fog there it
[13:30] was a Miss and it lied in darkness sort
[13:35] of like that if you could see the very
[13:38] type even with these people that sat
[13:41] there they were in darkness they were
[13:43] covered with mist they were they
[13:46] couldn't see clearly they didn't know
[13:49] what really what life was all about and
[13:52] he goes on he says but I believe what
[13:55] was here that the world was going to was
[14:00] going to be used and therefore and it
[14:04] moved in and there was fog and mist all
[14:08] over the earth making it dark and God
[14:11] said let there be light and darkness
[14:14] faded away and that became a cloudless
[14:18] sky amen so we understand that when he
[14:23] says light it has a
[14:26] deeper meaning than just a light of the
[14:30] Sun because the Sun was already in
[14:33] existence and the moon was already in
[14:36] existence but there was no light because
[14:40] of the fog that that the world sat in in
[14:45] the mist that they sat in okay and it's
[14:49] so easy sometimes for us to feel that we
[14:52] have light amen
[14:55] and so we understand that there that
[14:59] that was God's way of doing things
[15:03] he always did things that way he always
[15:08] uses separation if God is a separator
[15:14] we've heard the great message preached
[15:17] that God's Word calls for total
[15:20] separation from unbelief even in the
[15:23] garden isn't it funny now that they
[15:26] talked about separation we want
[15:28] everybody separated which can't be
[15:30] within six feet of them or separate
[15:33] separate separate well it wouldn't it be
[15:36] wonderful of man separated from sin that
[15:39] way amen but God always calls for
[15:43] separation if he's ever going to use
[15:45] something the first thing he's got to do
[15:48] is he's got to separate the light from
[15:51] the darkness anytime that God is going
[15:55] to use anything he's got to separate the
[15:58] light from the darkness he's going to
[16:00] use a people or if he's going to use
[16:03] anything if he's going to use any people
[16:06] if he's going to use any individual he
[16:09] has to separate the light from the
[16:11] darkness okay and so you know even if he
[16:15] wants to use a man he's got to get all
[16:17] the untruth out of him he's got to get
[16:20] all the darkness out of his life he's
[16:22] got to get rid of all the testimony that
[16:25] doesn't represent him
[16:27] so if God's going to identify himself
[16:29] with something he's got to remove all
[16:33] the darkness out of it all the things
[16:36] that aren't are ungodly all the things
[16:38] that
[16:39] would their reproach because remember
[16:42] the light is the representation of the
[16:46] word a the man so that's the way it is
[16:50] with God it's just that that when he
[16:53] says something let there be light
[16:56] and he's going to show forth the light
[16:58] and so he's going to say I'm going to
[17:01] I'm going to manifest myself I'm going
[17:04] to manifest my word I'm going to show
[17:08] what I meant
[17:09] that can't be mixed with darkness and
[17:12] that was the trouble with lady ousia it
[17:15] was lukewarm it was hot it hold it was a
[17:19] mixture of everything so it didn't
[17:22] represent what God meant when he spoke
[17:26] his word and that's what God does he's
[17:30] he when he speaks his word he brings it
[17:34] to pass just exactly what he's folk just
[17:39] exactly what he meant and the
[17:43] interpretation of that word is light so
[17:48] the interpretation of the word of God
[17:51] the manifestation of the Word of God it
[17:55] now becomes light because light and word
[17:59] are the same thing so when he said let
[18:03] there be light and that light came that
[18:06] was the word so the light and the word
[18:09] is the same thing the true manifestation
[18:13] of the word is the word in the beginning
[18:15] was the word and the Word was with God
[18:18] and the Word was made flesh
[18:20] so the manifestation of what was with
[18:23] God was the Word of God and that was the
[18:26] light of men and John expressing this in
[18:31] in his great epistles and and his great
[18:35] gospel that this light that came from
[18:39] God and this light was a light that
[18:42] separated and and Jesus even spoke those
[18:46] words he said I haven't come to divide
[18:48] he said I mean to unite but I've come to
[18:52] I'm good people are going to be
[18:54] separated because light automatically
[18:57] separates darkness and so we understand
[19:02] that that if the Sun was in existence
[19:06] and the moon was in existence and man
[19:09] laid in great great darkness well so
[19:11] then we also realized that that the seed
[19:15] was already here a marecus seed well it
[19:20] was there now what does the light do so
[19:24] the seed was there and when he said let
[19:26] there be light he rolled back the light
[19:29] and this diplays to us both naturally
[19:32] and the spiritually because it's the it
[19:36] it's a type because God was showing
[19:40] forth himself in nature the invisible
[19:43] things of God are clearly seen in the
[19:46] visible things around us so in the plan
[19:49] of nature God was unrolling and
[19:53] revealing the way that he does things
[19:56] amen we can see just through the seasons
[20:00] and after week we can see the
[20:02] resurrection in the nature of winter and
[20:05] the SAP and the leaves and after and
[20:08] those things so there's many things we
[20:10] could see than the zodiac in the sky
[20:13] that the first gospel was written in the
[20:16] sky so God's been manifesting himself it
[20:19] was one of his great purposes was to
[20:22] manifest himself to reveal himself to to
[20:26] show himself but he didn't want anybody
[20:30] interpreting himself he didn't need me
[20:34] to say this is what God is this is how
[20:38] he is and man did that they built totem
[20:41] poles they built worship trees they
[20:44] worshiped the Sun they carved out graven
[20:47] images and God said no you thought shalt
[20:49] not have a graven image and that means a
[20:52] mental graven image you can create a
[20:57] great image in your mind you can create
[20:59] a God in your mind that is not a God of
[21:04] the
[21:06] and and so that is just such a very
[21:13] simple understanding to understand that
[21:17] that the word becomes light so when God
[21:21] speaks his word and that word is
[21:24] manifested now you know this is the
[21:28] light Afghan so God's always been
[21:31] separating and that's what he does so we
[21:35] understand that that the seed was also
[21:40] here the seed was here just like in your
[21:47] life the seed was in you it was already
[21:51] here
[21:52] the seed was there now the light had to
[21:56] come and shine on that seed because the
[22:01] life was in the seed and what it needed
[22:04] was light to make that seed live because
[22:08] nothing can live without light both
[22:12] naturally and spiritually Amen you can't
[22:16] separate botany life from the Sun and
[22:20] you can't separate the spiritual seed
[22:23] from the Word of God it will not mill it
[22:28] only lives by the Word of God it only
[22:31] lives by the light and since the light
[22:35] in the word are the same thing the
[22:38] spiritual soul has to live by the light
[22:41] of God's Word a man commits flesh and
[22:46] blood a man does cannot supply what man
[22:51] has need of amen heaven and earth will
[22:54] pass away but my light my word my life
[22:58] will never pass away so the seed was
[23:02] there and when the light began to shine
[23:05] on that seed it that brought to life
[23:09] what that seed was supposed to be so it
[23:16] took the light
[23:17] to manifest what that seed was supposed
[23:21] to be so the light striking the seed the
[23:25] life striking the light in the seed
[23:28] manifested that seed and when that seed
[23:31] became manifested that was the spoken
[23:35] word what God spoke and what he meant
[23:38] when he said let every seed and so is it
[23:42] with Christ may I read this to you this
[23:46] is in paragraph 73 and that's the way
[23:50] God has today his seed is already here
[23:54] his word the only thing it needs is
[23:58] light on it and and he is that light for
[24:06] he is the word the word and the light is
[24:10] the same thing amen to you and you got
[24:15] to understand so the word in the life is
[24:18] the same thing in the light is the same
[24:22] thing in other words the word has life
[24:25] in it man the life is there it is the
[24:31] light of the word the life in there is
[24:37] the light of the word amen so that the
[24:42] dead-letter doesn't do anything it's the
[24:45] life that's in the word that's the light
[24:49] of that word that word shows what the
[24:53] word meant that's what shows what Jesus
[24:56] spoke when he said the things that he
[24:59] said amen is the life that was there the
[25:04] life that was in the word he said he
[25:08] said and the germ life lays within the
[25:13] grain the life is what breaks forth and
[25:17] brings forth the life out of the grain
[25:20] that's the way that Christ is in the
[25:25] word makes the word do what it's
[25:30] supposed
[25:31] to do amen
[25:34] so the life of Christ on the word makes
[25:41] that word do what it's supposed to do
[25:46] amen so when the sunlight and the life
[25:50] of God's Word
[25:52] strikes a true seed believer it's going
[25:56] to produce in that true seed believer
[25:59] what that believer is supposed to do
[26:04] what he was created for what his purpose
[26:10] was what God had in his mind in the
[26:14] beginning what God's thought was that he
[26:17] expressed so when the light the word
[26:20] which is the light strikes the word let
[26:24] there be light that was the word the
[26:27] light came forth and so when God speaks
[26:30] to the believer and speaks the word that
[26:33] life comes to life and that believer
[26:36] becomes and that word becomes what it's
[26:40] supposed to be it does what it's
[26:44] supposed to do
[26:48] amen and so he says it makes the word do
[26:53] what it's supposed to do just like the
[26:57] life in the grain of wheat or whatever
[27:00] it is makes the wheat do what it's
[27:03] supposed to do amen in other words it
[27:06] becomes wheat and it's the life that's
[27:12] in it all life amen so we have to begin
[27:19] to realize that that there's got to be
[27:24] something that brings life life
[27:30] intellect won't do that it take
[27:33] something beyond something from the
[27:36] outside even the seed itself even if it
[27:40] had life in it it couldn't manifest
[27:45] itself without the Word of God without
[27:49] the life and the Word of God striking
[27:52] the seat the world was there and the
[27:55] light was there the Sun was there the
[27:59] moon was there because I said in the
[28:01] beginning God created heaven and earth a
[28:05] man I don't know how long it took before
[28:09] but one day he said let there be light
[28:14] and the light was the removing of the
[28:19] darkness it wasn't creating the Sun the
[28:22] light removes the mist it removed the
[28:26] fog and now allowed the seed of God to
[28:30] become what it was supposed to become it
[28:34] took a life to bring the light 8-man and
[28:40] so we see that this was the way God
[28:43] works he says so life is only by the
[28:48] Word of God made manifest just think of
[28:53] it life only caused by the Word of God
[28:58] made manifest if he spoke it but if it
[29:03] never if it never produced s-- anything
[29:08] and there's if life didn't come that
[29:11] wasn't living word you just say let
[29:16] there be light
[29:18] but so life had to come by the spoken
[29:22] word it had to become by the word
[29:26] because oh and so the life is only by
[29:30] the word manifested life comes only by
[29:34] the word of God made manifest now listen
[29:39] to the statement because we're wanting
[29:42] to give us something this morning that
[29:45] gives us a sure path in where we are
[29:48] today he says as long as it Just's is in
[29:53] the book like this
[29:58] it still can be questioned okay so as
[30:06] long as it lays in letter form as long
[30:09] as it lays in a book like this we can
[30:12] question what does he mean what did he
[30:16] say what did he meant but what is life
[30:19] what is wheat what is a lion what is a
[30:23] bear okay you know what is water what is
[30:28] fish
[30:29] what separates as long as it lays here
[30:32] everybody has a right to their own
[30:39] interpretation everyone has a right to
[30:43] draw any conclusion that they want to
[30:48] drive so as long as it just stays here
[30:51] then it can be questioned but when it's
[30:55] made manifest then you see the product
[31:00] of what its spoke of being so now you
[31:08] see the product of what he spoke to be
[31:11] manifested now do you know so when Jesus
[31:14] preached his gospel he was preaching the
[31:18] gospel and he said now the spirits going
[31:21] to come and he's going to bring you into
[31:24] remembrance and their words he's going
[31:26] to bring to life in you everything that
[31:29] I preached so the world will know what
[31:33] it was that I was speaking so the word
[31:36] has to be made flesh so the word was
[31:39] made flesh
[31:40] now the flesh is being made worth so the
[31:44] flesh is manifesting what that he
[31:47] preached so it could be questioned so if
[31:54] he meant and then that is the light on
[31:59] the word that's what the word said so
[32:04] and then when it becomes to pass that is
[32:09] life in
[32:11] light life in life amen light bringing
[32:18] life life light bringing life again and
[32:26] so that it it has to be that way and and
[32:33] so whenever it's the same thing he says
[32:38] that when life when the life that's in
[32:41] the word strikes the seed the seed does
[32:45] what it's supposed to do if so the word
[32:52] can strike but until that words
[32:57] quickened and made alive in the believer
[33:02] he has just as much right to go on his
[33:06] intellect as anything he has a right to
[33:11] draw his own conclusion he has a right
[33:14] to his own interpretation he has a right
[33:18] to his own understanding but when life
[33:21] comes and kind of manifests the promise
[33:27] of that word then there's no question of
[33:37] what God had in mind and remember you
[33:44] can't grow without light not only can
[33:50] you can't grow without light you can't
[33:53] go without life and it brings to mind
[34:01] the which mention in this message about
[34:06] the the story of the young girl in
[34:10] Carlsbad cavern and so she was she was
[34:17] in Carlsbad cavern and and they went up
[34:23] and I have been there and
[34:25] you go there and and I forget how many
[34:29] thousands of feet but if you could ever
[34:32] make it the Carlsbad Caverns
[34:35] it is a very worthwhile trip I'm sure
[34:39] it's shut down now because they're
[34:42] afraid these amoeba
[34:44] is going to get down in the rocks down
[34:47] there or something but there's no light
[34:49] there so nothing can grow without light
[34:55] and so this
[35:02] we I thought about walking down and then
[35:07] it it's a long walk
[35:09] and I thought praise God there's
[35:12] elevators so we went in and we got our
[35:16] little ticket and we went down and and
[35:19] they do that when you get down at the
[35:21] bottom they turn off the light if I'm
[35:27] talking about darkness beyond
[35:30] comprehension I mean if there's no light
[35:35] anywhere you just can't go you don't
[35:42] know where to turn you don't know where
[35:43] the door is
[35:44] I mean you can start feeling your way
[35:47] but if you've never been there before
[35:49] you don't even know what you're feeling
[35:51] you have no orientation and amen and so
[35:56] you've got to have something that you
[36:00] draw an orientation of something that
[36:03] you have a relative point somewhere that
[36:06] you can have a reference but with no
[36:09] reference whatsoever you are just
[36:12] stumbling in the dark amen that's why
[36:15] God put a North Star out there and once
[36:18] they discovered that North Star they
[36:21] knew how to navigate and a spiritual
[36:24] person navigates by the North Star of
[36:27] God's Word he has the Word of God he
[36:33] knows that he knows by what his
[36:36] reference point is he knows which
[36:39] direction to go in and so he was there
[36:43] and and she started screaming out
[36:49] because she couldn't see she couldn't
[36:53] see her mama she couldn't see her daddy
[36:55] she couldn't see anything she was left
[37:00] with herself
[37:03] she knew she was there but she knew she
[37:07] was in darkness and her little brother
[37:12] is the story throws cried out he said
[37:15] sister there is a man here that can turn
[37:20] on the light
[37:22] and I thought of the world now in its
[37:28] present condition they know something's
[37:32] happening they know something's
[37:37] happening I mean children have a sense
[37:43] that something is going on I mean people
[37:51] know that they may not have jobs they
[37:54] don't know what they're gonna do about
[37:55] bills life is no longer the way they
[37:58] knew it they can't leave the house
[38:03] someone brought me an article that said
[38:06] that the most booming business at this
[38:09] present time is divorce attorneys I
[38:15] don't know why but I guess people aren't
[38:20] used to being with one another you know
[38:24] they're not used to being their home
[38:25] with the kids they're not used to not
[38:28] going to their office and having a place
[38:30] of escape in other words it's bringing
[38:32] people to places of thinking of things
[38:36] and considering things that they've
[38:38] never considered before and in other
[38:42] words their present-day reality has they
[38:47] found out it wasn't real it was a world
[38:52] that they had made up in their own minds
[38:55] a world that they were living a comfort
[38:58] zone that they were living in but the
[39:01] reality was not the depth of reality
[39:05] wasn't there I thought of poor sister
[39:10] Gayle Singh you know her sister passed
[39:13] away the other day from this
[39:16] virus she lived in New York but all her
[39:19] other sisters her nieces or nephews all
[39:22] whole families are stricken in other
[39:28] words like they've never had to deal
[39:31] with things like this before
[39:34] so they know that something is happening
[39:37] but they don't know what is happening
[39:41] what is happening append so it puts us
[39:46] in a place where they don't know where
[39:48] to go okay what's the next step how can
[39:54] I plan my future what are the things
[39:57] that that need to I need to do at the
[40:05] end so though those are questions that
[40:07] start this world and I thought of
[40:09] children are known that that's why
[40:11] they're wanting to be baptized they want
[40:13] to be right with God there's something
[40:16] that's in a child that knows that life
[40:19] has something to do with the
[40:22] supernatural
[40:23] they haven't been perverted yet by all
[40:26] the things of the world they still have
[40:28] that innocence about them that they
[40:30] realized hey there's got to be somebody
[40:33] in charge here and that's where
[40:39] everybody's at who's in charge who's in
[40:44] charge of this I know who's in charge
[40:47] and he the boy smoked out and said
[40:52] little sister there's a man here who can
[40:57] turn on the light I know what does light
[41:04] do there's a man here who can separate
[41:08] us from this darkness there's a man who
[41:15] can turn on the light and separate the
[41:19] darkness from the light there's a man
[41:21] here engineer here the one who planned
[41:24] this
[41:25] the one who put it into motion the one
[41:27] who developed it here's a man here that
[41:30] can shed light just like the man working
[41:34] on the carburetor the fellow was having
[41:38] trouble
[41:38] he said if you build this in two times
[41:41] this and five times that you do this
[41:44] than that and everything in room brrroom
[41:46] it run the guy turned around and said
[41:48] who are you
[41:49] a man he said I'm a man that can turn on
[41:53] the light I'm the engineer I made the
[41:58] thing I know what it was supposed to do
[42:01] and when he shed the light on it it did
[42:05] what it was supposed to do and when God
[42:10] gets in his word and the spirit gets in
[42:14] God's Word the word does what is
[42:17] supposed to do it'll never fail helped
[42:24] it'll never fail so he sends he always
[42:27] sends light because he separates light
[42:31] from darkness there's a man here that
[42:36] can separate the light from darkness
[42:40] there's a man here that can separate the
[42:44] word truth from deception so what is
[42:49] light light is the word manifested so
[42:55] when a promise is made in God's Word God
[43:01] said let there be in the last days the
[43:06] spirit of Elijah
[43:09] let there be Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30
[43:16] revelations 10 7 when he spoke those
[43:21] things and those the words that were
[43:25] spoken manifested then the manifestation
[43:30] of that word became life
[43:36] it became light and that light has a
[43:41] purpose if the purpose is to separate it
[43:48] just separate is to provide a
[43:53] manifestation so the thing can do what
[43:59] it's supposed to do and so what it was
[44:03] the light the manifest light so when the
[44:06] word is manifested and it becomes into
[44:14] manifestation or interpreted existence
[44:17] and all of a sudden you see what he
[44:20] spoke this is what he spoke here it is
[44:23] in flesh now that becomes light and
[44:28] light separates word truth from
[44:32] deception it separates life from death
[44:42] it separates kernel from spiritual it
[44:49] separates eternal from temporal and
[44:54] that's the problem with the lady OCA age
[44:57] it's caught up in the temporal it's got
[45:03] to believe that carnal blessings is a
[45:06] sign that God's with you it's a they
[45:11] begin to judge things by the flesh gods
[45:17] forests because we have a bigger
[45:19] building well look at those great big
[45:21] empty big buildings they've got I mean
[45:27] if God is not in buildings God is in his
[45:30] word God is in the life of his word that
[45:35] can manifest itself and bring something
[45:39] to do what it's supposed to do and if
[45:44] something's not doing what it's supposed
[45:46] to do
[45:47] it is in rebellion and that was God's
[45:50] complaint against Israel they were a
[45:53] rebellious nation they never kept his
[45:56] Commandments
[45:57] they never did what they were supposed
[45:59] to do they kept going after the world
[46:02] the things of the world the ways of the
[46:05] world and they kept trying to mix God's
[46:08] light with darkness God will spilled
[46:14] that out of his mouth that was the light
[46:17] so there was a man that came in our day
[46:21] and he had the light of the word of God
[46:26] because he was the word of God
[46:30] manifested and the word of God
[46:33] manifested brings light and light brings
[46:39] life and the word was to manifest would
[46:45] bring light to the true seed believer
[46:48] and that would produce a life in him
[46:51] what he was supposed to be he's to
[46:57] separate just like Satan told Eve Oh
[47:03] surely you won't die yeah you're gonna
[47:06] die because the word said the day you
[47:10] eat thereof is the day you die guess
[47:13] what she ate she died her death was the
[47:19] manifestation that the Word was truth no
[47:25] matter how she explained it no matter
[47:28] how she thought about it what was spoken
[47:34] was truth and when that was brought to
[47:39] the line of the test the word manifested
[47:44] that that was the light the day you eat
[47:47] thereof is the day you die I remember it
[47:52] being told to me by people who were
[47:54] there when brother brems
[47:59] spoke of I believe it was Dimas shift
[48:03] Aryans daughter or granddaughter I'm not
[48:06] remembered exactly the story but when
[48:10] that was spoken and prophesied hundreds
[48:14] and hundreds of people began to prophesy
[48:19] oh no she won't God will raise her up
[48:24] the Lord will be mighty you you are a
[48:28] servant of God God would never let this
[48:30] and on and on and on and on and on and
[48:36] on they went there was one problem it
[48:43] was thus saith the Lord and she passed
[48:51] away just when God wanted her to pass
[48:56] away just when God wanted to take her
[49:00] home we don't control God our lives
[49:07] should be where God controls us we
[49:11] shouldn't we believe we shouldn't be
[49:14] there where we're drawing our own
[49:16] conclusions trying to build our own
[49:18] futures trying to figure out the way
[49:21] that this is going to go or the way it
[49:23] should go
[49:24] or saying well this is what they should
[49:26] do hello everybody
[49:30] this is what they should do you know
[49:32] well I don't want what man wants to do I
[49:35] don't know what God wants to do what is
[49:38] God have in mind where where can I find
[49:41] where can I find my answer well there's
[49:44] a man here who can turn on the light
[49:50] okay and so why would man or why would
[49:55] we not accept the provided light
[50:03] it shall be light in the evening time
[50:08] the path to glory you shall surely find
[50:12] that in other words this light was a
[50:16] light unto our path because you can't go
[50:21] without the light you can't make
[50:24] decisions in darkness that's why people
[50:29] are deceived
[50:30] I had a few cracks in my house I would
[50:38] blame it on the Builder but I was the
[50:41] Builder so I blamed it on the earth so I
[50:46] hired a few fellas to come out and give
[50:49] me an estimate well I didn't hire him
[50:52] they offered to give me a free estimate
[50:56] and I said sure come out you know let me
[51:00] find out what I've got going and they
[51:02] measured the house and they take a
[51:04] bubble and they measure and they draw a
[51:06] great big platform out and I had three
[51:09] guys and and their measurements were all
[51:13] within a half of inch of one another
[51:16] once guys solution was ten to twelve
[51:20] thousand the next guy solution was was
[51:24] seven to some thousand the other guys
[51:27] solution was five thousand to three
[51:30] thousand dollar well I just happened to
[51:33] have a good friend he's a Muslim
[51:35] gentleman he's become a good friend of
[51:37] mine he's the number one soil engineer
[51:40] in Dallas Fort Worth worked for the
[51:45] government
[51:46] just he's a soil engineer I brought all
[51:49] the drawings over there sat him down the
[51:52] first thing I didn't say anything he
[51:54] said none of these guys charged you for
[51:56] this did they and I said no he says
[52:01] because all they're in the business of
[52:03] doing is putting in piers
[52:06] he says they don't do anything for your
[52:09] foundation and he went on to explain me
[52:12] about the earth and how it moves and how
[52:14] old my house was and that not nothing
[52:17] that they had to do was been did to do
[52:22] anything and I got the truth and the
[52:29] deception of it was is that they don't
[52:33] have any control over it and one of
[52:38] those fellows and I'll give him credit
[52:40] he was a Seventh day Adventist and it
[52:44] didn't take long he noticed Leslie and
[52:46] we started talking about prophecy and
[52:48] the word of the Lord and his take on
[52:51] things and we had fellowship and he
[52:53] finally looked at me he says you know
[52:55] you really don't have a foundation
[52:56] problem I thought or bless that guy he
[53:03] was the cheapest guy he said depends on
[53:06] how fanatical you want to get and I went
[53:11] there and and and Sam told me exactly
[53:14] the same thing now I have somebody that
[53:20] shines light on it and this fella knew
[53:26] that I had this engineer because I told
[53:30] them so when the light beep in the sign
[53:33] the truth begin to come out because
[53:39] that's what light does it separates the
[53:41] Word of God is more powerful and sharper
[53:45] than a two-edged sword separating the
[53:50] marrow in the bone if it discerns the
[53:55] thought in the intent of the heart so
[53:59] the Word of God discerns if the intent
[54:02] of the heart is really to follow the
[54:06] word and become the word not just use
[54:11] the word but to have that light
[54:18] that word become a guiding light in
[54:22] their life okay so why would I go ahead
[54:27] and go to the most expensive guy let
[54:31] them drill holes on my floor take up my
[54:34] brand new carpet do everything he does
[54:37] give him $15,000 when it wasn't going to
[54:42] do one thing for me I thought this guy
[54:46] is like a denomination his motive and
[54:54] objective his work is motive and
[54:56] objective is money at key and there is
[55:00] absolutely no guarantee he said well
[55:07] we'll test your plumbing for leaks how
[55:10] much is that four hundred and fifty
[55:12] dollars go down to Home Depot buy a
[55:17] fifteen dollar screw on valve you screw
[55:20] it on your hose bid you turn on the
[55:23] water if you watch the pressure go up
[55:26] and you watch it for ten minutes fifteen
[55:29] minutes sometimes they leave it
[55:31] overnight and they come back and if the
[55:35] pressure doesn't go down you don't have
[55:38] a leak 400 bucks
[55:40] I told I'll tell you what you let me go
[55:45] do all your test leaks I'll give you 150
[55:49] you don't even have to do it and I'll
[55:51] check them all be if your house leaks
[55:54] they don't guarantee to fix it it's a
[55:58] gimmick it's a deception why would
[56:03] people reject true light why would we
[56:10] not accept a provided light that was
[56:15] going to bring us into truth was going
[56:18] to separate us from deception was going
[56:21] to separate the carnal in the spiritual
[56:24] was going to separate the temporal from
[56:27] the eternal
[56:30] separate life from darkness why would we
[56:33] it's not accept that and it's a
[56:38] beautiful thing because people live in
[56:42] the glare of another age it's a false
[56:46] light that could deceive some a false
[56:53] Claire a false light that's quite Satan
[56:56] appears as an angel of what light
[57:01] because the only thing that will deceive
[57:04] is a false light the Great Train Robbery
[57:08] was false lights they set up a light
[57:10] stopped the train they deceived them so
[57:14] it's a it's a false light it's a glare
[57:19] that we're talking about why people
[57:23] would reject the Word of God that came
[57:30] and was vindicated and proved to be the
[57:34] promised word that was promised it was
[57:39] spoken
[57:40] it was manifested here's the angel
[57:45] here's the prophet of Malachi four or
[57:48] five here's the angel of revelations ten
[57:51] seven revealing the mysteries
[57:54] discerning the thoughts intents of the
[57:57] heart manifesting the Ministry of the
[57:59] Son of Man here's the scripture what he
[58:06] promised to do I promise you lady I'll
[58:09] see you I promise you Gentiles I will
[58:13] not leave you in the deception but I
[58:15] will send your life
[58:17] it shall be life the path the glory you
[58:21] shall find but why would they reject it
[58:26] because of a glare of a false light the
[58:31] glare of another age now when this we've
[58:36] been to start this trouble
[58:40] I've received many songs many
[58:45] testimonies many phone calls from people
[58:50] and friends telling me of all the things
[58:55] that God does and this is what we do we
[59:03] tell how good he is God's good we tell
[59:11] how loving he is we tell how kind he is
[59:22] we tell of all the wonderful things he
[59:27] has done for us little testimonies
[59:33] people helping one another people
[59:36] praying for things and and God bring it
[59:40] to him God's sending people by all these
[59:44] marvelous wonderful things that God's
[59:47] doing he healed us he delivered us he
[59:54] provided for us and all of it is true
[1:00:02] every bit of it is true because that's
[1:00:08] his side of it you understand that's
[1:00:14] what he promised to do he's keeping his
[1:00:21] word that's his side of it but the very
[1:00:26] fact that he's good the very fact that
[1:00:29] he shows his rain the rain on the just
[1:00:31] and the unjust the even fact that he
[1:00:34] provides for the fatherless and Gannon
[1:00:37] and for the widow and their fliction
[1:00:39] even though he feeds the poor and he
[1:00:42] feeds the hungry and he does all those
[1:00:45] things he does everything he promised he
[1:00:48] would do
[1:00:51] they see his side of it and don't they
[1:00:56] understand that that's becoming their
[1:00:59] judgment I kept my word to you I
[1:01:07] provided for you I healed you I
[1:01:10] delivered you he did it to Israel over
[1:01:13] and over and over again and every time
[1:01:15] they would go away he'd come right back
[1:01:23] but there was a day that they rejected
[1:01:28] him for the last time and so we seek
[1:01:35] that his side of it
[1:01:40] he said I'll provide the light I'll
[1:01:45] provide the Sun but if you turn it down
[1:01:49] and you reject it and there's the fact
[1:01:55] that someone sits there with their hands
[1:01:58] raised in the air and they're feeling
[1:02:01] the blessings of God and the Shekinah
[1:02:04] glory is all around them it doesn't make
[1:02:06] it right that they've got bobbed hair it
[1:02:10] doesn't make it right that they've got
[1:02:11] are adorned and Gorda gold apparel and
[1:02:15] they're there they're painted faced the
[1:02:19] blessings of God does not eliminate the
[1:02:22] truth of his word if he doesn't it
[1:02:28] doesn't separate that could they get
[1:02:32] caught up in the glare of the blessings
[1:02:37] and reject the provided light that's
[1:02:43] going to separate them from the
[1:02:45] deception God really bless me
[1:02:51] so I can cut my hair no I will not deny
[1:02:59] that god bless them
[1:03:02] just like the lady that said God called
[1:03:05] me to preach I don't know about that but
[1:03:07] it's con cherry to his word heaven and
[1:03:13] earth will pass away but my word will
[1:03:15] not pass away when you reject the light
[1:03:19] you reject the way that you have to go
[1:03:23] you're providing your own way you're
[1:03:26] taking your own judgement and the Word
[1:03:29] of God says away seemeth right unto a
[1:03:32] man but the end of that way is death he
[1:03:36] provided a light he provided a
[1:03:39] vindication he provided a manifestation
[1:03:43] so that manifestation could be light so
[1:03:47] we could walk in the light as he is in
[1:03:51] the light we walk in the revealed light
[1:04:00] of the age what are we gonna do in this
[1:04:05] time what are we gonna do in the midst
[1:04:08] of this trial what are we going to do
[1:04:11] how do we prepare follow the light stay
[1:04:17] with the light stay with the revealed
[1:04:20] way to live stay with the revealed look
[1:04:23] a Word of God you stay with the Word of
[1:04:26] God the Word of God will produce exactly
[1:04:29] what it said it would do and you will do
[1:04:32] what it said to do I've never seen the
[1:04:34] righteous big bread what are you going
[1:04:39] to do different brother McGary nothing I
[1:04:43] have the light I'm going to walk in that
[1:04:47] light there's a man here that can turn
[1:04:50] on the light
[1:04:55] it will guide us through all darkness no
[1:04:59] matter when it is or what it is the path
[1:05:04] to glory you shall surely find it
[1:05:11] doesn't matter God provided a light he
[1:05:16] provided a manifestation he he provided
[1:05:19] a revealed word the revealed word the
[1:05:23] manifested word becomes the light to our
[1:05:26] path it's the way we go doesn't matter
[1:05:32] what changes the light doesn't change
[1:05:35] the manifestation doesn't change the
[1:05:38] word doesn't change I don't care what
[1:05:43] plans they need to make what are we
[1:05:48] going to do we're going to follow the
[1:05:51] manifested revealed Word of God just as
[1:05:56] it was spoken and given to our age it
[1:06:01] will do what it's supposed to do keep us
[1:06:09] from deception keep us from death keep
[1:06:18] us from carnality keep us from temporal
[1:06:22] allottee what is designed to do it is
[1:06:29] designed to separate us from the
[1:06:31] Fellowship of the world come out from
[1:06:34] amongst in my people and be ye separate
[1:06:36] and I'll call you my sons and my
[1:06:39] daughter he is this separate us it's not
[1:06:43] for us not to get caught up into the
[1:06:45] deception
[1:06:47] and if it was given to as us a provided
[1:06:54] light okay and sure people can speak of
[1:07:02] all the glory and goodness of God and
[1:07:05] every bit of it is true but that's not
[1:07:11] the seed that's in you the seed that's
[1:07:15] in you is let every word of man be a lie
[1:07:18] and every word of God be true
[1:07:21] the seed that issue is your you're going
[1:07:24] to follow the Word of God and what are
[1:07:30] we going to do what are we going to do
[1:07:33] but keep following the Word of God the
[1:07:36] provided light the provided way because
[1:07:40] there's a message that can turn on the
[1:07:43] light there's a message that can show
[1:07:48] you and answer your questions and deal
[1:07:52] with your heart it's been proved to be
[1:07:57] true and it works over and over again so
[1:08:01] I I don't need to come up with something
[1:08:04] new I I don't need to be caught in the
[1:08:12] glare okay
[1:08:18] people that might claim or God's with us
[1:08:21] I don't care how if you sing like an
[1:08:26] angel and you're annoying it a man
[1:08:30] that's got long hairs a pervert
[1:08:37] see we don't want the reproach we don't
[1:08:42] want the things that separate us from
[1:08:45] the deception we don't want the things
[1:08:49] that makes us be separate we don't want
[1:08:53] the things that that puts our heart on
[1:08:56] heavenly things an eternal thing that's
[1:08:59] the hard part but when you see the light
[1:09:04] and you have a revelation of the
[1:09:07] manifested word of the hour when you
[1:09:10] have a revelation that this is the
[1:09:12] message that God since this is a prophet
[1:09:15] this is the fulfillment of those
[1:09:17] scriptures the cominius tree of the son
[1:09:19] of man appeared as it was in the days of
[1:09:22] Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in the days
[1:09:25] of Noah every single one of those
[1:09:27] conditions have been met this word has
[1:09:30] been manifested it has come to pass
[1:09:32] exactly the way it's spoken and you
[1:09:34] realize that and you recognize that as
[1:09:37] being the light you will not be deceived
[1:09:42] by the glare if not you'll start running
[1:09:45] after the glare because there's no
[1:09:49] reproach in the glare it's all God's
[1:09:56] good God's good all the time he fed
[1:10:05] everyone that crucified Him he healed
[1:10:13] many of those that said away with him he
[1:10:20] brought light into their heart
[1:10:23] he bought deliverance cast out their
[1:10:26] Devils it's not even recorded in the
[1:10:29] book or the books of this earth the
[1:10:33] things and the works that were done by
[1:10:35] his hand how many mines he restored how
[1:10:39] many marriages in restoring how many
[1:10:41] lives he turned around the very presence
[1:10:45] of God walking amongst men and yet men
[1:10:51] rejected him
[1:10:53] because he claimed to be the son of God
[1:10:58] but he was the son of God and today they
[1:11:04] reject the light that God sent to
[1:11:09] provide for us and keep us from the
[1:11:13] deception of the angel of light and they
[1:11:18] get caught up in the glare of the
[1:11:20] goodness of God and I say yes God's good
[1:11:24] when someone tells me of all what God
[1:11:27] does I say yes God does that I'm not
[1:11:32] judging people
[1:11:34] it's not given me to judge it's given me
[1:11:38] to remove the beam out of my own eye
[1:11:41] before I remove the sliver it's given to
[1:11:45] me to make sure my life is lined up with
[1:11:49] the manifested word it's given to me
[1:11:53] that that word produce itself in me I'm
[1:11:56] not here to condemn but I don't want to
[1:12:02] get caught up into the glare and the
[1:12:07] justification of things that are ungodly
[1:12:14] and when the day comes many will say
[1:12:19] Lord Lord we did all these things he
[1:12:22] said depart from me I never knew you in
[1:12:26] other words my light and my life and my
[1:12:34] word never manifested in you for you to
[1:12:39] be what I planted I bless you sister but
[1:12:45] I didn't plant in this earth a bobbed
[1:12:49] hair gold ordained pants wearing
[1:12:56] miniskirt woman that presents her body
[1:13:01] that serves authority over the man
[1:13:06] doesn't take her position that's not the
[1:13:10] seed I plan it did the Sun Shine on you
[1:13:14] yes
[1:13:17] were you blessed of the Spirit yes but
[1:13:23] you rejected the light whether it would
[1:13:27] transform you into what I plan it that
[1:13:33] was the hard part
[1:13:36] the hard part is staying with it
[1:13:41] but it's what you are
[1:13:47] it's what we're going to do we're going
[1:13:51] to stay with the Word of God we're not
[1:13:54] going to compromise for food we're not
[1:13:57] going to compromise for permission to
[1:14:00] open church if they say you've got to
[1:14:04] change what you preach oh you can't
[1:14:06] we're not going to do it because this
[1:14:10] earth is going to pass away but that
[1:14:13] word is not gonna pass away so just
[1:14:18] remember this beautiful time of darkness
[1:14:20] that we're in people don't know what's
[1:14:23] happening but we know what's happening
[1:14:26] what's happening is there's a seed
[1:14:29] that's sitting in the light of the Sun
[1:14:32] and it's ripening into the image of
[1:14:36] Jesus Christ and one day it'll be
[1:14:39] harvested and rapture they say these are
[1:14:43] uncertain times we are certain of one
[1:14:47] thing and that is the resurrection and
[1:14:51] the soon catching away of the bride god
[1:14:55] bless you let's pray together our Lord
[1:15:02] Jesus if the believers father would go
[1:15:11] and
[1:15:15] [Music]

[1:15:22] through it they would see how important
[1:15:30] that the provided light that God sent
[1:15:36] tune again a vitreous x I will not leave
[1:15:44] you comfortless but I'll come again I'll

[1:16:10] father's in the days of the voice of the
[1:16:15] seventh angel when his message shall
[1:16:19] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:16:23] should be finished unto the angel of leo
[1:16:28] sia write these things says the faithful
[1:16:32] and the true witness the beginning of
[1:16:36] the creation of God Lord may we not
[1:16:41] forget the revealed word that has been
[1:16:44] manifested in our day and the power of
[1:16:49] the word that you delivered us to
[1:16:52] transform us out of this world
[1:16:55] bless those at our home I wish I could
[1:16:58] see their face I wish I could shake
[1:17:02] their hand I wish I could give them

[1:18:13] but may we keep our eyes on you the word
[1:18:18] knowing that heaven and earth will pass
[1:18:22] away but you promised that nothing can
[1:18:26] pluck us out of the palm of your hand

[1:18:32] your sheep and you sheep hear your voice

[1:19:09] they have no place in the resurrection I
[1:19:15] ask that you provide a spot for them in
[1:19:18] the final judgement because they've
[1:19:22] tried to live for you but they couldn't
[1:19:26] grow without the light they couldn't
[1:19:31] mature without the life of the word it
[1:19:34] couldn't go any farther than they our

[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:37] the sorrows here
[1:25:44] Oh
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:26:22] wonderful many times I have questions
[1:26:26] about you know when to when to baptize
[1:26:33] someone but I always decided in my heart
[1:26:37] to baptize them when they ask because I
[1:26:42] feel that a child has a lot better
[1:26:47] chance of fighting the wiles of the
[1:26:53] devil when they've made a commitment to
[1:26:55] the Lord then just sending them forth
[1:26:58] with nothing so this is her heart
[1:27:03] wanting to do what's right and I believe
[1:27:06] God will honor her and keep her and this
[1:27:11] will stand for her when she has to make
[1:27:15] a stand
[1:27:16] so that's always been my approach and
[1:27:20] and she becomes a part of us and we keep
[1:27:24] her in our prayer amen let us read in
[1:27:27] the book of Acts and it said in the 21st
[1:27:35] verse and it shall come to pass that
[1:27:37] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:27:41] Lord shall be saved
[1:27:43] he men of Israel hear these words Jesus
[1:27:46] of Nazareth Amanda proofed of God among
[1:27:50] you by miracles and wonders and signs
[1:27:54] which God did by him in the midst of you
[1:28:00] all ye yourselves also know and as we
[1:28:07] read it says
[1:28:19] this scripture as we read on it says for
[1:28:26] David it is not ascended into the
[1:28:28] heavens when he said to himself the Lord
[1:28:32] said unto my lord sit down out on my
[1:28:36] right hand until I make thy foes thy
[1:28:39] footstool therefore let all the house of
[1:28:43] Israel assuredly that God who hath made
[1:28:46] the same Jesus whom ye have crucified
[1:28:49] both Lord and Christ and when they have
[1:28:53] heard this they were pricked in their
[1:28:55] hearts and said unto Peter and the rest
[1:28:58] of the Apostles men and brethren what
[1:29:01] shall we do Peter said unto them repent
[1:29:04] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:29:09] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:29:11] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:29:16] the Holy Ghost where the promise is unto
[1:29:19] you and to their children and to all
[1:29:22] that are afar off
[1:29:25] even as many as our Lord our God shall
[1:29:28] call and with many other words did he
[1:29:32] testify and exhort saying save yourself
[1:29:35] from this up towards generation amen and
[1:29:40] we believe that our little sister has
[1:29:43] felt a call on her heart amen our
[1:29:51] gracious Heavenly Father you said to go
[1:29:54] into all the world and preach the gospel
