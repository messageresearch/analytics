[44:42] the songs we sing We Can't capture that
[44:44] goodness can we
[44:47] all the words we have in our vocabulary
[44:51] can't describe his magnificence
[44:55] I like that song so much we sing that if
[44:59] words
[45:00] felt like rain from my lips
[45:04] it couldn't express it all
[45:06] so we say Lord listen to our heart
[45:09] amen let's turn our heart to him one
[45:11] more time this morning this evening our
[45:14] gracious father
[45:17] we heard such wonderful word this
[45:19] morning
[45:21] Lord that we could feast
[45:24] forever
[45:27] Lord there's no ability
[45:31] within us father
[45:34] that could match to that
[45:39] the Lord we just know that
[45:42] by grace and mercy you'll touch the
[45:45] heart and encourage
[45:49] your people
[45:51] we just come humbly before you Lord and
[45:56] trusting
[45:58] as you said in your scriptures you said
[46:01] come let us reason together
[46:05] and though your sins be like Scarlet
[46:09] I will make them white as snow
[46:13] Lord we just long for your working
[46:15] within our lives we ask you to bless us
[46:19] now as we read your word in Jesus name
[46:22] we pray amen
[46:25] amen if you have your Bible
[46:28] the only person that could come behind
[46:31] this morning's message and preach is
[46:34] brother Tom but
[46:36] I I told Brother Tom that I just let him
[46:40] do one service and and he said he was
[46:43] grateful so we'll do our best
[46:47] but certainly uh
[46:50] has said it's very difficult to come
[46:52] behind such a great Fellowship this
[46:55] morning
[46:57] let's turn to Hebrews and I I just want
[46:59] to
[47:00] um
[47:01] continue on a little bit from
[47:07] Wednesday night and
[47:09] and um
[47:12] keeping in mind all the things that were
[47:15] spoken to us
[47:18] this morning so Hebrews 11 we want to
[47:22] read
[47:23] um
[47:24] the starting in the 11th chapter
[47:28] and uh
[47:29] fifth verse
[47:33] and certainly Enoch uh is special to us
[47:38] because that's the kinmanship we want to
[47:42] have we want to be of the class of Enoch
[47:45] right he says by faith Enoch was
[47:48] translated that he should not see death
[47:51] and was not found because he had
[47:56] translated him
[47:58] for before his translation he had this
[48:01] testimony
[48:03] that he pleased God
[48:06] but without faith it was impossible to
[48:10] please him
[48:11] for he that cometh to God must believe
[48:14] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[48:17] them that diligently seek him
[48:20] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[48:24] things not seen as yet moved with fear
[48:29] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[48:32] house by which he condemned the world
[48:37] and became heir of righteousness which
[48:41] is by
[48:43] Faith Also let's turn over to Ephesians
[48:48] the second chapter of Ephesians
[48:52] and
[48:56] read the 10th verse here which is a
[49:00] great
[49:01] verse read many many times if I messaged
[49:05] believers
[49:07] for we are his workmanship created in
[49:10] Christ Jesus under good works which God
[49:14] hath before ordained that we should walk
[49:18] in them heavenly father bless your word
[49:21] to us in your precious name we pray amen
[49:25] amen you may be seated
[49:34] we know it's a a great thing
[49:37] for
[49:38] Believers to recognize the day that
[49:42] they're living in
[49:44] and to be able to look out upon the
[49:48] things that are transpiring and to be
[49:51] able to place yourself in the plan of
[49:55] God I think the scripture here points
[49:58] that Noah uh
[50:02] had that ability that what was credited
[50:05] to Noah that he was warned of God the
[50:08] scripture just simply saying
[50:11] by faith Noah being warned of God of
[50:15] things not yet
[50:17] see not seen as yet moves with fear and
[50:23] prepared an ark for the saving of his
[50:25] house
[50:26] and
[50:28] of all the things that the message is
[50:31] there's one thing that we're sure that
[50:34] it is it is a warning of the oncoming
[50:37] judgment
[50:39] it it is simply spoken out and told us
[50:44] the things that are to come and I think
[50:48] it behooves us I believe to be moved
[50:52] upon with fear and and I don't mean the
[50:56] kind of fear that the world has but the
[50:59] beginning of wisdom is the fear of God
[51:03] the ultimate respect for What God Says
[51:08] and that what he says is going to come
[51:11] to pass
[51:12] uh you know many times
[51:16] people mistake a lot of things that they
[51:19] mistake a perception uh for reality but
[51:24] perception isn't necessarily reality and
[51:27] perception isn't necessarily the way
[51:30] that things are
[51:32] Noah he was preparing an art for things
[51:35] that have not yet been seen but he was
[51:38] warned of God by faith in other words by
[51:42] Revelation
[51:43] Noah knew that it was going to rain and
[51:46] that God was going to destroy the world
[51:49] by flood because God had revealed it to
[51:53] him and and he wasn't afraid of the
[51:57] reproach
[51:58] to accept the word of God and he was
[52:01] moved by fear he prepared an art now the
[52:05] ark wasn't for him only it was for his
[52:08] house and so it was Noah prepared was
[52:12] something that was Far encompassing
[52:15] besides himself it was something that
[52:18] could include others so it was you know
[52:21] so much of the world talks about uh all
[52:25] inclusion all inclusion well I only
[52:28] believe in one thing you should be
[52:30] included in and that's the born to
[52:32] gained experience of a Christian that's
[52:35] what fixes everything but we see that
[52:38] these great people were moved on by
[52:42] faith and and we looked at that a little
[52:45] bit and we began to talk about it and we
[52:49] begin to see that Faith isn't something
[52:53] that we necessarily
[52:56] can have on our own
[52:59] and faith and belief are different
[53:03] things altogether people believe many
[53:06] things you know they believe that the
[53:09] world was clear they believed if you
[53:12] went so fast that you would
[53:14] roll off the Earth or something would
[53:17] happen to you all these different uh
[53:20] beliefs that they had so there's got to
[53:24] be something within the believer that
[53:26] separates belief in faith or comes to
[53:31] the true understanding of what faith
[53:35] really is and I I honestly feel that
[53:40] faith is one of the Mysteries
[53:43] that was kept from all the churches
[53:47] Through the Ages and at this last age
[53:51] that God was going to have a people that
[53:54] he was going to show things reveal
[53:57] things and break understandings too that
[54:00] that ages before us would not be able to
[54:05] accept
[54:06] even though they were great believers
[54:09] they wouldn't be able to accept these
[54:12] great things and he makes this statement
[54:14] he says well that's the same way with
[54:16] preaching Divine Healing or anything
[54:20] else as you go along you begin to learn
[54:24] if you don't learn there's something
[54:27] wrong see you've got to learn and we've
[54:31] got to learn how to accept God and what
[54:36] it really means
[54:39] and I I like that because I think that
[54:42] God has something that he's longing for
[54:45] us to accept
[54:47] and as we go a little bit I just uh I'll
[54:50] just take a few moments to
[54:54] um express my heart to you again I think
[54:58] that we received enough food to
[55:01] certainly last us but we want to just
[55:04] fellowship with you this evening
[55:07] mother man makes this statement in the
[55:10] paragraph 122 of works as Faith
[55:15] expressed
[55:17] and that to me it's an astounding
[55:19] statement
[55:21] he says Jesus said
[55:23] that no man can come to me
[55:26] except my father draw him first
[55:30] and all the father hath given me
[55:33] will come to me
[55:35] no man can understand
[55:38] who he is
[55:42] or how it is
[55:47] except be revealed to you
[55:51] by the revelation of God
[55:55] and then faith in that you act
[55:59] accordingly
[56:03] now going back to paragraph 105.
[56:07] now Faith is a revelation from God
[56:12] now Faith is a revelation
[56:15] there's where I want to stay there just
[56:18] a moment
[56:19] it's a revelation
[56:22] he has revealed it to you by grace
[56:28] it's nothing you did
[56:31] you didn't work
[56:34] yourself up into faith
[56:38] you ever have faith
[56:41] it's given to you by the grace of God
[56:46] if you ever have faith or and really in
[56:49] one way we don't have faith
[56:53] it's not something that we have
[56:56] now it's a great dilemma that we are
[57:02] facing here
[57:03] so we don't have faith
[57:07] it's a gift of God lest any man should
[57:10] boast it's not something you can
[57:13] manufacture it's not something that you
[57:15] can work up that's it's not something
[57:18] that you can Define
[57:20] it it'll be honest with you it's not
[57:23] really something that you can physically
[57:26] share with somebody else I I would love
[57:29] to give you a portion of my grace or I
[57:33] would love to give you some uh some
[57:35] substance that I have here because faith
[57:38] is a substance it's something that you
[57:41] know you possessed it's a a reality to
[57:44] you it's not a perception it it's real
[57:48] to you and it's real to you because it
[57:51] was given to you but it's not something
[57:54] that you have it's uh you can desire for
[57:58] it
[57:59] and you should pray for it and I love
[58:02] the man when Jesus spoke to him and he
[58:05] said can you believe and the man really
[58:07] took a look at his condition and he
[58:11] finally looked at the Lord and said Lord
[58:13] help my unbelief help me Lord what
[58:17] you're talking about I need and if you
[58:21] ever are lacking something in God's word
[58:24] he's always opened a door for you to
[58:28] receive it he says ask and you shall
[58:31] receive seek and you shall find knock
[58:34] and it shall be opened to you
[58:37] but we we have such a tendency to sit in
[58:41] condemnation because we think of
[58:44] ourselves really higher and above what
[58:47] we are
[58:49] I'm sure that if we were to write our
[58:52] own obituary we would all write
[58:54] ourselves into the kingdom as saints of
[58:57] God
[59:00] I love it when men attach
[59:03] titles to themselves you know I'm an
[59:07] apostle you know I'm a prophet I'm an
[59:12] elder you know I'm an elder in in in the
[59:16] message and uh
[59:18] why
[59:20] we're still children in the message
[59:24] there is so much more of God's word for
[59:28] us to have there's such more more of the
[59:31] spirit of God that we need how you know
[59:35] can we say that we walk in the spirit we
[59:38] talk in the spirit we live in the spirit
[59:41] that we do nothing till God first shows
[59:45] it to us that that as he is so are we in
[59:49] this world herein is the Capstone set
[59:52] forth that as he is so are we in this
[59:57] world and so we we it's not very
[1:00:01] difficult for anybody to preach to us
[1:00:05] how short we are
[1:00:08] I mean that that's a a simple gospel
[1:00:12] you're all sinners
[1:00:15] if you don't say you're Sinners you're a
[1:00:17] liar
[1:00:19] you know we've all sinned and we all
[1:00:21] fall short of the glory of God take a
[1:00:24] look at yourself in the mirror see all
[1:00:27] your faults and all your shortcomings
[1:00:29] and come running to the altar
[1:00:32] you can spend your life at the altar
[1:00:35] and you'll never be able to get rid of
[1:00:38] one of the things that you've got
[1:00:40] bothering you
[1:00:43] you don't have the ability
[1:00:47] and and that's what we begin to see in
[1:00:51] this great quote that we just read just
[1:00:56] a moment ago he said he said no man can
[1:01:01] understand in who he is or how it is
[1:01:08] how it is
[1:01:10] that what
[1:01:12] I think if we could just grasp for a few
[1:01:16] seconds this evening is how is it
[1:01:20] now your whole definition of how
[1:01:23] something is is all carnal
[1:01:28] because you can only are trapped
[1:01:32] by the five senses that you have to
[1:01:36] touch
[1:01:38] taste feel smell here so you you we
[1:01:42] judge everything through those senses
[1:01:45] you know it's nothing against that God
[1:01:49] gave us those they're a gift of God to
[1:01:52] us those five senses those five inner
[1:01:55] senses they're God's gift to us but he
[1:01:58] says they're not meant to lead us
[1:02:01] he gave them to us to make contact with
[1:02:04] one another I'm glad when I talked to
[1:02:07] Ben wall that I can see him
[1:02:11] and if I don't uh see them and I just
[1:02:14] talk to them on the phone there's a
[1:02:15] longing in my heart to see him I I don't
[1:02:19] like texting people
[1:02:21] okay Mick there's no contact there
[1:02:23] there's no census there there's not even
[1:02:26] hearing there there might be seeing
[1:02:28] there but I'm given to all the
[1:02:31] perceptions uh that I have of what that
[1:02:35] text means
[1:02:38] and you got to be careful you know I've
[1:02:41] tried to pull a few people's legs by
[1:02:44] text
[1:02:47] you know say something funny or make a
[1:02:49] comment or anything and they just
[1:02:51] totally took it out of context and
[1:02:54] everything and I'm days and months
[1:02:56] trying to redeem myself
[1:03:03] but we
[1:03:07] there's a way that God has and we need
[1:03:12] to know what it means to accept him
[1:03:17] and so as we we look at Faith
[1:03:21] and we read really what it is it's not
[1:03:25] something you have it's a gift of God
[1:03:27] and he said no man could come unto me
[1:03:30] except my father draws him first and all
[1:03:33] the father hath given me will come to me
[1:03:36] and no man can understand who he is or
[1:03:40] how it is except you it be revealed to
[1:03:45] you by the revelation of God and then
[1:03:49] Faith acts accordingly I believe brother
[1:03:52] Tom touched on that this morning
[1:03:55] but how it is
[1:03:59] I think that's one of the most beautiful
[1:04:02] things
[1:04:04] that has been revealed to us in this day
[1:04:08] is how that it is
[1:04:13] how is it
[1:04:14] how did God choose to do things what was
[1:04:20] uh his purpose what was his plan how he
[1:04:25] chose to to touch man and to reach out
[1:04:29] to man
[1:04:30] and and to
[1:04:33] carry out his plan
[1:04:36] now we read in Ephesians
[1:04:40] this great scripture that says that we
[1:04:44] are his workmanship
[1:04:46] right created unto good works
[1:04:49] that we should walk in them
[1:04:53] now what a paradox
[1:04:57] we don't have faith
[1:04:59] unless he gives it to us
[1:05:01] and yet we have good works that were
[1:05:05] foreordained to walk in
[1:05:08] now here we find ourselves
[1:05:12] if I could say that in a situation
[1:05:16] where we're supposed to accomplish
[1:05:18] something
[1:05:19] that we have no ability to accomplish
[1:05:24] we've been tasked with something
[1:05:28] that we're unable to accomplish
[1:05:35] I can't I can't accomplish it
[1:05:39] I'm foreordained unto good works I don't
[1:05:43] know what they are
[1:05:46] I don't know how to to
[1:05:49] accomplish it I don't have no power to
[1:05:53] perform them
[1:05:55] well I am in a fix
[1:05:59] I'm in a fix
[1:06:01] I'm ordained to do something yeah
[1:06:04] yeah I I I'm I'm have good works that
[1:06:08] I'm supposed to walk in
[1:06:11] that they they I'm I'm his workmanship
[1:06:15] I don't even know how that he works I
[1:06:18] don't know what's going on I'm striving
[1:06:21] Within Myself to labor to find out what
[1:06:27] these works are and to accomplish these
[1:06:30] works and and to to do something that
[1:06:33] I'm supposed to do I read the Scripture
[1:06:36] it lays out the things that I'm supposed
[1:06:38] to do ways that I'm supposed to live and
[1:06:41] the more that I read it the more that I
[1:06:44] find out that I can't do this
[1:06:50] but praise God that's how it is
[1:06:54] because he has a way he he's he's he's
[1:06:58] he's put us in the place
[1:07:01] to wear that we have no righteousness
[1:07:05] we have no ability there's nothing that
[1:07:09] we can that we can do we have no ability
[1:07:13] to do it and yet we can't use our
[1:07:17] excuses for not doing it
[1:07:20] oh my
[1:07:23] God Paul found himself in that spot and
[1:07:26] finally he said I sought the Lord I
[1:07:28] sought the Lord I sought the Lord Lord
[1:07:31] if I would have my eyes fixed Lord if I
[1:07:33] could do this Lord I could if I could
[1:07:35] get this done if I could get this done
[1:07:37] oh what a marvelous program that Paul
[1:07:40] laid out for his own Deliverance
[1:07:45] well a lot of times we lay out our
[1:07:48] deliverance program
[1:07:51] we lay out other people's salvation
[1:07:54] program
[1:07:55] or if they would do this and they would
[1:07:57] do that and if they would just come to
[1:07:59] this meeting or if they would just go to
[1:08:02] the youth meeting or if they would just
[1:08:04] come here brother such and such preach I
[1:08:07] just know they'd get saved
[1:08:10] I had a lady one time
[1:08:12] come to church
[1:08:15] and she felt that if her
[1:08:18] granddaughter
[1:08:21] could be
[1:08:24] play the part of Jesus
[1:08:26] in the manger
[1:08:28] at our Sunday school Christmas play
[1:08:33] that her grand her children would get
[1:08:37] saved
[1:08:43] and I thought wait a minute
[1:08:46] there's only one provided place that God
[1:08:48] meets anybody
[1:08:50] that's under the shed Bloods but she
[1:08:54] just so felt in her heart
[1:08:56] that if she could just get that baby in
[1:09:00] that manger at that play
[1:09:05] that they'd be saved
[1:09:08] now I don't know about you yeah
[1:09:11] but you don't take a sixth month old
[1:09:13] baby away from its mother and stick it
[1:09:17] on a pile of hay and think it's going to
[1:09:20] sit there and act like an angel
[1:09:25] beautiful
[1:09:26] right
[1:09:28] that's absurd
[1:09:33] but so many times our minds and our
[1:09:36] thoughts live in absurdity
[1:09:39] you know we just simply can't come back
[1:09:41] to the the place that we realize that
[1:09:45] we've got to be that we're we're tasked
[1:09:48] with something that we're unable to
[1:09:51] accomplish
[1:09:54] and of course I I couldn't
[1:09:58] very well let the
[1:10:01] child be in that
[1:10:03] I don't know what the other kids would
[1:10:05] do I don't know what they do with the
[1:10:07] baby quit crying I I I don't know all
[1:10:11] the things that could have happened and
[1:10:14] so I just simply
[1:10:16] I could simply said you know sis it's
[1:10:20] just not a very good idea it's just not
[1:10:23] wise to put this baby in this manger
[1:10:27] scene in front of all the people and and
[1:10:30] you know it's just you know uh it's fine
[1:10:35] I just can't do it oh my goodness I sent
[1:10:39] her kids to hell
[1:10:43] and I thought wait a minute
[1:10:45] come on what makes it work
[1:10:49] it's nothing we can do
[1:10:52] it's by grace
[1:10:54] my grace is sufficient for you my
[1:10:57] strength is made perfect
[1:10:59] and weakness
[1:11:01] so we have
[1:11:04] a group of people
[1:11:07] that's foreordained
[1:11:10] prophesied about
[1:11:13] and spoken to reach Great Heights
[1:11:18] and many times we we speak about those
[1:11:21] things that we are going to be an
[1:11:24] invincible Army
[1:11:27] but we can accomplish that
[1:11:31] we're the last voice in this last stage
[1:11:35] oh that's that that's a great prophecy
[1:11:39] but how are we going to get there
[1:11:44] how are we going to get from point A to
[1:11:48] point B now we talk about point B we
[1:11:53] talked about what it is we believe it's
[1:11:56] existence we we believe that if it's
[1:11:58] spoken if it it's true
[1:12:02] but he never Dawns on us that there's a
[1:12:06] part of this word that's been given to
[1:12:10] us that how it is
[1:12:13] how it is how it is that you get from
[1:12:18] here to there how it is that you get
[1:12:21] from sickness to health how it is that
[1:12:25] you get from bondage to Freedom how it
[1:12:28] is how it is how it is God in this last
[1:12:32] day has chosen and elect lady to reveal
[1:12:35] to Earth how it is
[1:12:40] she's not going to sit in darkness
[1:12:44] she's not going to sit in wonderment
[1:12:49] just like he told Elijah take your coats
[1:12:52] might the thing
[1:12:55] just like he said take your rod and
[1:12:58] strike the sea
[1:13:02] every place that he spoke take the Altar
[1:13:05] and burn it on fire there's always a how
[1:13:08] it is for the believer
[1:13:14] God's already laid out the process
[1:13:17] he's already spoken to it
[1:13:20] how it is what he does how that he's
[1:13:24] going to get this bride how he's going
[1:13:27] to take her from the church world how
[1:13:30] he's going to separate her how that he's
[1:13:33] going to cleanse her yeah
[1:13:36] it's all it's all there
[1:13:39] and we're actually sitting in a time
[1:13:42] where our eyes are actually viewing
[1:13:46] the very how it is
[1:13:49] that he spoke
[1:13:55] he says this great things
[1:13:59] okay and I love him so much
[1:14:03] this is how it is
[1:14:06] but in the face of all this unbelieving
[1:14:10] doubting age and things
[1:14:14] that we have went through
[1:14:16] and live in today that's paragraph 70 of
[1:14:20] proving his word
[1:14:23] the worst of all
[1:14:25] in the face of all this doubt
[1:14:29] God goes right on proving his word to be
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:35] he has in every age
[1:14:38] so that's how it is
[1:14:41] how it is it's in the face of doubt it's
[1:14:45] in the face of evil it's in the face of
[1:14:48] the most deceptive age that it's ever
[1:14:51] been he chooses the time to prove his
[1:14:55] word he does it always when the law of
[1:14:59] contrast is at its greatest
[1:15:05] the darker it is the greater the light
[1:15:08] shine
[1:15:09] so this is how it is he's he's he he
[1:15:13] he's not
[1:15:15] asking us to reason
[1:15:18] he's not even asking us to understand he
[1:15:22] just says this is how it is
[1:15:26] in the face of all unbelief in the time
[1:15:29] of the great darkness in the last days
[1:15:31] perilous times shall come men shall be
[1:15:34] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:15:36] God not wishing to retain God in their
[1:15:39] knowledge that God gives them over to a
[1:15:41] reprobate mind that is how it is
[1:15:48] that one Noah by Revelation saw what was
[1:15:52] coming
[1:15:53] he moved with fear
[1:15:57] and prepared himself in heart
[1:16:00] he didn't know when it was going to
[1:16:01] start with rain he didn't know how long
[1:16:04] he was going to preach he didn't know
[1:16:06] when it was going to be but there's one
[1:16:08] thing he knew he knew it was going to
[1:16:11] rain and he acted accordingly
[1:16:17] because to him
[1:16:19] that's how it was
[1:16:24] have we got the how it is down
[1:16:29] I always like to paint a bed of roses
[1:16:32] for me
[1:16:33] I stand in the mirror in the morning and
[1:16:35] say good morning Hercules
[1:16:39] you're looking great today
[1:16:43] and then the truth comes in and says you
[1:16:46] know dear you'd feel a lot better if
[1:16:48] you'd lose 25 pounds
[1:16:54] now
[1:16:55] I like the perception
[1:16:59] better and I do the reality
[1:17:02] but I've got to accept
[1:17:04] how it is
[1:17:08] if you're not serving God
[1:17:11] a hundred percent
[1:17:14] you will never get any better until you
[1:17:17] can accept how it is
[1:17:19] if your backslid you just got to say I'm
[1:17:22] backslid if you made a mistake I made a
[1:17:25] mistake the great beautiful part about
[1:17:27] the scripture is you'll never repent for
[1:17:30] a mistake you don't think you made
[1:17:34] and you'll go on living in the deception
[1:17:37] of your own righteousness
[1:17:41] which in God's sight is a filthy Ray so
[1:17:45] you drape yourself with a filthy rag of
[1:17:48] your own righteousness you go on
[1:17:50] pretending I really didn't say that I
[1:17:53] really didn't do this I really didn't
[1:17:55] mean that and you give a heap full of
[1:17:57] extra of excuses when the word of God
[1:18:01] says you stand naked before God the one
[1:18:04] whom we have to deal with
[1:18:11] you're not fooling him
[1:18:13] you know why because he knows how it is
[1:18:18] he knows who you are
[1:18:21] why you are
[1:18:23] where you come from and where you're
[1:18:26] going it's about time to get with the
[1:18:29] program
[1:18:31] I'd like to make contact with the one
[1:18:34] that knows what's going on
[1:18:38] we used to teach sales training and we
[1:18:42] we see so many people they'd walk into
[1:18:45] the store to sell a project and they'd
[1:18:47] talk to the checkout Clerk
[1:18:53] oh this is a great product you ought to
[1:18:56] have this you know well all she can sit
[1:18:59] there and say well can I buy a bottle
[1:19:03] you got to get to the right Source
[1:19:05] you've got to get to the right guy
[1:19:08] you've got to get to the man that's got
[1:19:10] the power
[1:19:15] another thing we always talk is you had
[1:19:18] to have a prepared
[1:19:20] presentation
[1:19:24] you've got to be able to what are you
[1:19:26] trying to accomplish what are you trying
[1:19:28] to say what are you wanting to do and we
[1:19:31] just heard the other day through the
[1:19:32] word of God that God prepares
[1:19:35] he prepares his people he's been
[1:19:37] preparing you
[1:19:39] to have the right approach
[1:19:42] he's been preparing you to know who to
[1:19:45] go to who it is that gets things done
[1:19:48] how to approach him what your approach
[1:19:51] is how to present to him your case
[1:19:55] what you're asking for you're asking for
[1:19:58] a sale because instantly in the form of
[1:20:01] a type so whatever your case is you've
[1:20:04] got to know what you're presenting
[1:20:08] you can't go into somebody says now I
[1:20:10] think this stuff works
[1:20:15] and I hope it won't damage
[1:20:18] your material
[1:20:21] well that ain't gonna fly
[1:20:24] and yet
[1:20:26] we're told to approach the throne of
[1:20:28] grace
[1:20:29] boldly
[1:20:33] and and this is what God's been longing
[1:20:37] for
[1:20:37] he's been longing for this this seed to
[1:20:42] mature
[1:20:45] into the place that they can approach
[1:20:48] his throne the same way that Jesus did
[1:20:54] so let's go back this phone and keep
[1:20:56] reading
[1:20:57] he said
[1:20:59] God goes
[1:21:02] and all doubt goes God goes right on
[1:21:05] proving his word to be right
[1:21:09] and he has in every age
[1:21:12] unbelief
[1:21:14] doesn't stop God
[1:21:17] it doesn't hinder him
[1:21:19] I don't care how much the world
[1:21:21] unbelieves it's still going to happen
[1:21:25] unbelief doesn't do anything but
[1:21:29] condemns the unbeliever
[1:21:32] the unbelief will send the unbeliever to
[1:21:34] Hell it'll Rob him of every blessing
[1:21:38] that God promised to him but it doesn't
[1:21:41] hinder God from going right on with with
[1:21:45] the believer see unbelief doesn't stop
[1:21:49] God it only stops the unbeliever
[1:21:54] that's how it is
[1:21:58] now if really think
[1:22:00] what that means
[1:22:02] if you could accept that
[1:22:05] you wouldn't beat your brains out
[1:22:09] on the unbeliever
[1:22:12] you wouldn't cast your pearls
[1:22:15] Before Swine
[1:22:18] you'd speak the word
[1:22:20] without fear or favor
[1:22:23] you would cast your seed
[1:22:26] knowing that some might fall on this
[1:22:28] ground some might fall on that ground
[1:22:31] you don't try to pre-determine you don't
[1:22:34] try to pre-design you don't try to do
[1:22:38] this like so many people I see that
[1:22:41] believe this message they look for a
[1:22:43] round for some good Pentecostal sister
[1:22:47] it's got her hair all tied up right and
[1:22:49] putting on a nice little dress and and
[1:22:53] look so good and they think that's a
[1:22:56] candidate well let me tell you she has
[1:22:59] veiled with such a religious spirit
[1:23:03] that even raising the dead wouldn't open
[1:23:07] her eyes
[1:23:08] but we'll walk past the little person
[1:23:10] that's tattooed we'll walk past the
[1:23:13] little person that's got a drug problem
[1:23:15] we'll walk a past somebody that's
[1:23:18] through emotional trouble oh we've
[1:23:20] pre-qualified them that God can help
[1:23:23] them let me take the easy Road let me
[1:23:26] find somebody else that looks like they
[1:23:28] might be able to talk with me why don't
[1:23:30] we just take the power of the
[1:23:33] resurrection and present the gospel and
[1:23:36] give them a chance to believe
[1:23:40] because it's not going to be given by
[1:23:43] their faith they don't have faith but
[1:23:46] the grace of God can give them a
[1:23:49] revelation
[1:23:52] I'll guarantee you a 99 of the people in
[1:23:57] this message would have never brought it
[1:23:59] to me am I pre-saved condition
[1:24:06] yet I was screaming
[1:24:09] on the inside for God
[1:24:13] I was hungering amen for light
[1:24:17] I was trapped
[1:24:20] in a dark tunnel and I had no way out no
[1:24:24] ability to get out
[1:24:28] I was a slave
[1:24:32] nobody got me out
[1:24:36] he got me out
[1:24:41] he got me out
[1:24:43] and when he got me out
[1:24:45] he got me out
[1:24:48] I'm never going back there
[1:24:51] if I come into judgment it won't be for
[1:24:54] that condition
[1:24:57] because he burned that prison down
[1:25:02] though he goes on here and he say it
[1:25:05] doesn't stop God now listen to this
[1:25:07] great statement here
[1:25:09] this is paragraph 72 how does
[1:25:13] he make his word known to the people
[1:25:19] how does he do it
[1:25:20] how is it
[1:25:24] I I'm serious with us tonight mostly for
[1:25:28] my church we're happy for the visitors
[1:25:31] but that's questions to us
[1:25:34] do we understand how God works do we
[1:25:37] understand what it means
[1:25:40] can we recognize him working right
[1:25:44] I don't want to walk by God doing
[1:25:46] something great and not give him the
[1:25:48] honor and glory for it
[1:25:51] I want I sound that I might see
[1:25:55] he says how does God make his word known
[1:25:59] to the believer first
[1:26:02] God knowing that there would be
[1:26:05] unbelievers
[1:26:10] I like that now watch the wisdom of God
[1:26:16] knowing there would be unbelievers
[1:26:18] and how the majority would be
[1:26:21] unbelievers
[1:26:23] he is by foreknowledge
[1:26:25] predestinated a seed for every age that
[1:26:30] would believe it Hallelujah that's how
[1:26:34] it is
[1:26:37] he wasn't going to go change the
[1:26:39] unbelievers they were unbelievers to
[1:26:42] begin with
[1:26:43] in his wisdom
[1:26:45] knowing that there would be unbelievers
[1:26:48] knowing that would be rejected knowing
[1:26:51] you didn't have any ability to come out
[1:26:53] of the darkness you were in because you
[1:26:55] were born in unbelief you were born in
[1:26:57] sin which is unbelief came into the
[1:27:00] world speaking lies you were hopeless
[1:27:05] but all the wisdom of God
[1:27:09] I'll put something in them to believe
[1:27:11] with I'll plant a seed there
[1:27:16] Oh by his great wisdom by his grace
[1:27:19] that's how it is that's how it is he
[1:27:22] said how it is he how God how was God
[1:27:25] going to get this gospel to the believer
[1:27:30] how is he going to make his word known
[1:27:33] in His Infinite Wisdom he was going to
[1:27:36] put a seed
[1:27:40] something in there
[1:27:42] that they could believe with
[1:27:47] oh
[1:27:51] the pearl of great price the treasure in
[1:27:54] the field
[1:27:57] everything
[1:27:58] sell all that you have
[1:28:02] yes that that that's a prized possession
[1:28:05] that's been given to you that's greater
[1:28:09] than Mona Lisa it's greater than
[1:28:10] anything of any value what would a man
[1:28:13] give in exchange for his soul that seed
[1:28:17] is the most precious thing on Earth
[1:28:21] today it's immeasurable it's unvaluable
[1:28:29] and just to think it might have been
[1:28:31] sold for 30 pieces of silver
[1:28:35] he predestinates a seed for every age
[1:28:38] that would be there
[1:28:40] now if you'll notice in there
[1:28:43] for each age goes right on with his word
[1:28:46] everything right on time nothing hinders
[1:28:49] God God goes right on every click is
[1:28:53] moving just exactly right we think
[1:28:57] sometimes it's not going to work right
[1:29:00] but don't worry
[1:29:03] sometimes we just don't think it's going
[1:29:06] to work right
[1:29:08] this message just ain't going to work
[1:29:13] sometimes we give in to things
[1:29:17] because we don't want to offend this we
[1:29:20] don't want to offend our uncles we don't
[1:29:21] want to offend our ants and this is the
[1:29:24] way we've done it for so long and
[1:29:27] everything and we actually partake
[1:29:31] in heathenism
[1:29:37] heathenism
[1:29:39] people that confess
[1:29:43] for heathenism
[1:29:48] people today said well I want to win
[1:29:50] this guy to the to the Lord so I'm going
[1:29:53] to take him to a Cowboy game
[1:30:00] look if you don't got something to keep
[1:30:03] you from a Cowboy game how in the world
[1:30:05] he does he think that he's going to get
[1:30:07] something for me for from you that he
[1:30:10] don't have
[1:30:13] he's got what you got
[1:30:19] the scripture says come out from amongst
[1:30:21] them and be ye supper
[1:30:24] how separated are you you've got a seed
[1:30:29] you're not looking to change people's
[1:30:31] minds you're not looking to give them a
[1:30:34] religious experience you're looking to
[1:30:37] take the word that's in you and see if
[1:30:40] it'll Quicken a seed that's in them
[1:30:47] that's all you're hoping for
[1:30:50] pre-adventure
[1:30:52] they have a seed pre-adventure they have
[1:30:55] enough faith pre-adventure I'm going to
[1:30:58] testify to them I'm going to tell them
[1:31:00] that Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations
[1:31:05] 10 7 that God came in this generation
[1:31:08] and veiled himself in flesh did the same
[1:31:11] Saints and wonders that Jesus did prey
[1:31:13] Adventure
[1:31:15] that there's something inside of them
[1:31:17] that'll scream amen
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:26] no but we go on their ground
[1:31:31] we go on their ground
[1:31:34] actually I could read you quote after
[1:31:37] quote which I'm going to do
[1:31:40] I'm going to show the videos
[1:31:44] on the screen
[1:31:45] in front of the church
[1:31:48] so that it's totally understood
[1:31:54] Beyond any shadow of a doubt
[1:31:57] this wedding dancing is of the devil
[1:32:04] it's hedonism
[1:32:06] I don't care whether you feel you've got
[1:32:08] to honor your grandfather honor your
[1:32:11] good the word of God says blessed is he
[1:32:13] who is not offended in me
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:20] sorry
[1:32:23] that's how it is
[1:32:28] I love the dance
[1:32:30] I was a Dancing Fool
[1:32:35] oh I couldn't wait for the high school
[1:32:37] dance
[1:32:39] because I could do the two-step the
[1:32:41] three-step the triple step the back flip
[1:32:43] the splits I could do the the one foot
[1:32:46] Jim James Brown across the stage
[1:32:51] you know what I mean oh they'd all stand
[1:32:53] back and watch me act like a fool
[1:32:57] it's about time we come fools for Christ
[1:33:01] but that just how it is
[1:33:07] because you say well why is that
[1:33:09] important because we're not going to go
[1:33:11] any higher
[1:33:15] you understand that
[1:33:16] we're not going to go any higher
[1:33:20] we're not going to climb up
[1:33:23] we're not going to mature and come we
[1:33:26] come to the realization of how it is
[1:33:29] how are we going to get raptured how is
[1:33:32] it what is it I've got a seed
[1:33:37] I've been separated out
[1:33:40] I have something they don't have
[1:33:43] that's what he said he said the reason
[1:33:45] they can't accept it is they don't have
[1:33:47] anything in them to believe with
[1:33:51] you know that girl one time just walked
[1:33:54] by that dance hall
[1:33:58] and before she knew it
[1:34:00] she was in there
[1:34:02] and she had a taste for it
[1:34:07] she remembered all the memories
[1:34:09] how it felt
[1:34:11] the anointing of that dancing may I say
[1:34:14] it again the anointing
[1:34:17] the religious anointing that comes with
[1:34:21] it
[1:34:22] and all the dancing and all the feeling
[1:34:25] and and all the
[1:34:28] emotion both and said before she knew it
[1:34:35] she was in there dancing
[1:34:38] just like that
[1:34:40] just like that
[1:34:43] Spirits get on things
[1:34:47] at Heathen worship
[1:34:50] we're not even supposed to eat things
[1:34:52] that are offered to idols
[1:34:57] and it just just that quick
[1:35:00] you say why because it's the inability
[1:35:03] for people to stand back and look how it
[1:35:06] is how is it what are they doing
[1:35:09] there's dancing and then there's dancing
[1:35:13] what devil put that in your brain
[1:35:18] what did he say you filter everything
[1:35:21] through the word of God till there's
[1:35:24] nothing left but the Holy Ghost
[1:35:28] I'm not trying to put condemnation on
[1:35:30] anybody it's time that the church wakes
[1:35:33] up
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:35] he's got something for us he's got
[1:35:38] something for us that we're going to
[1:35:41] walk in a foreordained work that we
[1:35:44] bring destinated to do the question is
[1:35:47] how do we get there
[1:35:50] what's her path
[1:35:53] how did what did he choose to do
[1:35:56] how did he choose to get us from this
[1:35:59] terrible condition that we're in
[1:36:02] so that's so easily to fall from the
[1:36:05] flesh to sin the scripture says the Sin
[1:36:09] that so easily besets us
[1:36:12] the nature that we have the human nature
[1:36:15] that so rapidly comes to the surface
[1:36:18] with a little bit of pressure
[1:36:22] if all the drivers out there
[1:36:25] that I cursed and sent to the bad place
[1:36:29] if they were off the road there'd be one
[1:36:31] or two cars
[1:36:38] you know you get to the place sometimes
[1:36:40] you think man I wish you'd just get in a
[1:36:42] wreck
[1:36:45] not even realizing that your thoughts
[1:36:48] speak louder in heaven than the very
[1:36:50] words that come from your mouth
[1:36:53] we don't want a reason
[1:36:57] there's something that we want
[1:36:59] we want revelation
[1:37:02] glorious we want the gift of God
[1:37:06] faith comes by Revelation you don't have
[1:37:10] faith
[1:37:12] it's given to you by the grace of God
[1:37:16] you don't have Revelation you might have
[1:37:19] conclusion
[1:37:22] or you might have perception
[1:37:24] but Revelation is something that the
[1:37:27] church is supposed to be praying for
[1:37:28] because it's what God's going to use to
[1:37:32] move us from A to B
[1:37:34] to get us to The Works that are
[1:37:36] foreordained for us and he goes on just
[1:37:40] to say
[1:37:44] he says as as we're reading up here he
[1:37:48] says God will prove it so so
[1:37:52] he says no matter how much the rest of
[1:37:54] them claim to be oh I believe brother
[1:37:59] see if you do
[1:38:01] God will prove it so because we looked
[1:38:05] and see the others how can we say then
[1:38:09] see if it's by the True Believer that he
[1:38:14] proves his word
[1:38:16] not by those who say they believe but
[1:38:20] those who really believe it's by his
[1:38:24] believing children that he proves his
[1:38:27] word
[1:38:29] how many beliefs there's going to be a
[1:38:31] bride
[1:38:33] how many believe she's going to be
[1:38:34] without spot or wrinkle
[1:38:36] who's he going to prove that by
[1:38:42] it's not going to be a mystical uh he
[1:38:47] said there's a bride so she's out there
[1:38:48] somewhere
[1:38:49] no he's going to take that word
[1:38:52] and prove what he said
[1:38:55] by believers
[1:39:00] they have a seed
[1:39:03] so he's got the Quicken that seed is
[1:39:06] that right he's got to send the word to
[1:39:09] that seed he's got to bring that seed to
[1:39:12] life that that seed grows into a fleshly
[1:39:15] form and now God could say there is my
[1:39:19] word come to pass
[1:39:25] that's you
[1:39:29] now I know what you look at yourself and
[1:39:32] you think it's impossible
[1:39:35] but it's not done by you
[1:39:38] he planned it to be done by grace
[1:39:44] let's read again a little bit we'll
[1:39:46] close
[1:39:47] now I want you to notice
[1:39:49] he does it
[1:39:51] that way in every age
[1:39:53] he does it every time by the same method
[1:39:57] he has to take believers
[1:40:00] then in order to have Believers to meet
[1:40:04] that word
[1:40:05] he has got to predestinate it to that
[1:40:10] age
[1:40:11] you see it
[1:40:14] why am I here
[1:40:19] what what is he transforming me into
[1:40:24] he's transformed me from what I am to
[1:40:28] what that he wants me to be
[1:40:32] he's doing it I can't do it
[1:40:35] but the one thing I can know
[1:40:38] is that he's made it known to me how it
[1:40:41] is
[1:40:44] this is how it is
[1:40:46] he plants the seed
[1:40:49] to be there to receive the promise
[1:40:52] and then he brings that seed to life
[1:40:56] he said you see it he's got to
[1:40:58] predestinate this thing to be there to
[1:41:01] meet the challenge of the age do you get
[1:41:04] it do you feel it do you see it do you
[1:41:08] understand it right that's what's
[1:41:11] happening today this is how it is are
[1:41:14] you seeing it do you feel it I actually
[1:41:17] sometimes wonder do I really feel that
[1:41:20] Seed Life in me and how separated I am
[1:41:24] from the world and how God's actually
[1:41:26] working on me to transform me and take
[1:41:30] me out of this world into a kingdom I
[1:41:33] haven't seen yet
[1:41:36] okay
[1:41:38] that's what we're here for
[1:41:41] we're here to leave
[1:41:45] we're the Rapture
[1:41:48] the rapture's on
[1:41:51] you're part of it he's transforming you
[1:41:54] that's where we're not part of the world
[1:41:56] we're in the world we're not of the
[1:41:58] world
[1:41:59] I don't care what else is going on the
[1:42:02] unbelief don't stop God he said it
[1:42:04] that's the way it's going to be he's
[1:42:06] going to have a people in The Bride I'm
[1:42:08] part of that person
[1:42:12] and if I'm not a light for that time I'm
[1:42:14] a part of those that come out of the
[1:42:15] Grave I don't know what part I'm going
[1:42:17] to play but I'm going to play the part
[1:42:19] he's predestinated for me to play
[1:42:24] don't you love them
[1:42:27] yeah because he said he said
[1:42:30] and that's what's happening today he
[1:42:32] predestinated it to this by his
[1:42:35] foreknowledge
[1:42:37] and when he predestinated in Malachi 4 5
[1:42:42] it's got to happen
[1:42:44] when he came over and predestinated
[1:42:47] anything to happen in his word
[1:42:50] he had to prove his word to be so
[1:42:53] and when he predestinates anything to
[1:42:56] happen or says it'll happen he knows
[1:42:59] that seed will be there just at that
[1:43:04] time he predestinated a bride she's
[1:43:08] going to be there going to be a Rapture
[1:43:13] she's going to be there he predestinated
[1:43:16] it by his foreknowledge see then there's
[1:43:19] nothing going
[1:43:22] to stop it
[1:43:28] isn't that wonderful
[1:43:31] you know he says in God's power to
[1:43:34] transform
[1:43:37] he says
[1:43:41] it's not the word that quickened it's
[1:43:44] the spirit that quickens
[1:43:47] I I had that
[1:43:49] quote and I I lost it and I'm just going
[1:43:52] to pretend but I want you to think about
[1:43:54] it for a moment
[1:43:55] he says he sent the
[1:43:57] Spirit to Quicken the word
[1:44:00] he said when the life that's in the
[1:44:03] spirit
[1:44:06] meets the life
[1:44:08] that's in the seed
[1:44:10] it will produce what that seed was to be
[1:44:19] so now here we are we've got the seed
[1:44:24] he has got to send the spirit
[1:44:27] to meet the life and the seed because
[1:44:29] without that Spirit without that
[1:44:32] quickening without that revelation of
[1:44:35] faith without God showing you by grace
[1:44:40] you can't achieve it
[1:44:43] people can read the books see what's
[1:44:46] there but they're in
[1:44:49] capable of achieving it
[1:44:53] we're trying to achieve it through
[1:44:55] Revival
[1:44:56] and brother Branham preached and told us
[1:44:59] that in this last day there would be a
[1:45:01] false Revival
[1:45:04] they try to achieve it by an outpouring
[1:45:06] of gifts
[1:45:08] which is wonderful It's a Great Taste Of
[1:45:11] Glory goodbye but it doesn't produce it
[1:45:14] there's only one thing that produces it
[1:45:19] s revelation
[1:45:21] by grace
[1:45:25] it's God
[1:45:28] opening your eyes and letting you see it
[1:45:32] nothing you can do you're helpless
[1:45:35] you're just sitting there helpless you
[1:45:38] can actually know it's being like like
[1:45:41] being paralyzed and laying in bed and
[1:45:44] having a great desire to get out of bed
[1:45:47] and walk and you you hear that there's
[1:45:49] all these works that you can do and all
[1:45:52] these things you're supposed to be able
[1:45:54] to accomplish and all these great things
[1:45:56] that's laid before you but yet you're
[1:45:58] paralyzed
[1:46:00] you can do nothing
[1:46:03] until he comes down reveals to you that
[1:46:07] you're healed and then he quickens that
[1:46:09] and makes it come alive
[1:46:14] oh that's the beautiful that's the super
[1:46:17] sign God present with us quickening his
[1:46:20] word and making it come flesh
[1:46:23] Church
[1:46:25] we're on the verge of the greatest thing
[1:46:28] that we've ever been part of
[1:46:32] it and it's going to be accomplished not
[1:46:35] by us but by him
[1:46:39] by faith
[1:46:41] by a gift of God by Revelation by making
[1:46:45] himself good he says he proves his word
[1:46:48] all of his words just think of it all of
[1:46:52] his word and you
[1:46:55] were his word he was the word and you
[1:47:00] were part of his word and that's the
[1:47:03] reason you're sent here to confirm your
[1:47:06] place
[1:47:08] in this life
[1:47:13] that's something
[1:47:15] to confirm your place
[1:47:18] in this life
[1:47:20] Lord what am I here for I'm here to be
[1:47:24] in the rapture
[1:47:27] okay
[1:47:30] maybe I got a few years
[1:47:32] I don't know if I'll be here
[1:47:35] but I'll confirm that my voice is going
[1:47:39] to cry out he's coming
[1:47:42] and the Grave's not going to hold this
[1:47:44] body down
[1:47:47] one day I'll Fly Away there's a kingdom
[1:47:50] I'm going to there's a land beyond the
[1:47:53] river
[1:47:54] I believe it with all my heart
[1:47:58] I'm trusting in it I'm going to live
[1:48:01] according the word struck me I'm going
[1:48:04] to separate myself from unbelief oh even
[1:48:07] so come quickly Lord Jesus cleanse me
[1:48:10] from all unrighteousness Lord put it in
[1:48:13] my mind give me that thinking man's
[1:48:15] filter set my soul on Fire Lord this is
[1:48:19] how it is
[1:48:22] how is it by election
[1:48:26] he put a seed
[1:48:28] and he quickens it by his word
[1:48:33] no other way
[1:48:36] but his way
[1:48:42] amen I'm happy
[1:48:45] because despite all that I am
[1:48:50] he picked me
[1:48:57] not by power
[1:48:59] not by might
[1:49:02] but by my spirit
[1:49:04] saith the Lord
[1:49:06] I'm one of them
[1:49:10] I'm one of them no someone look at me
[1:49:12] and say you can't be one of them yeah
[1:49:14] you're probably what you're seeing can't
[1:49:16] be
[1:49:20] but that's not how it is
[1:49:24] how it is he put a seed there
[1:49:28] because he knew there would be unbelief
[1:49:30] and he knew if he didn't put that seed
[1:49:33] there I would go the way of the
[1:49:34] unbeliever if he didn't put that seed
[1:49:37] there I wouldn't accept this message if
[1:49:39] he didn't put this seed there I wouldn't
[1:49:42] know he's the same yesterday today and
[1:49:44] forever if he didn't put that seed there
[1:49:46] I could do nothing
[1:49:49] and if he didn't Quicken that secede
[1:49:51] with his spirit and make it come alive
[1:49:54] all I could do is believe unto believe
[1:49:57] unto believe unto I believe he's a
[1:50:00] Healer but Lord reveal to me by faith
[1:50:04] and Grace my healing that what I believe
[1:50:07] might become flesh
[1:50:10] the separation of believing in faith is
[1:50:13] all in his hands
[1:50:15] right it's all in his hands and the
[1:50:17] prophet says above all things pray
[1:50:21] for revelation
[1:50:23] pray to have it made real pray for it to
[1:50:26] be quickened don't condemn yourself
[1:50:28] don't put yourself on the outside
[1:50:31] there's a deep inside of you calling
[1:50:34] Lord I want it to be real
[1:50:37] I want it to be real
[1:50:41] and I'll share this with you in closing
[1:50:45] and maybe I've shared it with you before
[1:50:49] but I used to listen to those tapes
[1:50:51] brother Ben was healing this person and
[1:50:54] healing that person and I I was 21 years
[1:50:58] old again I was cutting Timber and I was
[1:51:02] this
[1:51:03] solid as a rock
[1:51:05] and alls I wanted to do was be healed
[1:51:10] Lord Heal Me I wanna I wanna feel
[1:51:14] healing I wanted to feel healing you
[1:51:17] know how it is when you're a child you
[1:51:19] think as a child
[1:51:21] I never realized I had to get sick
[1:51:25] before I could get healed
[1:51:27] how was it I was a spitting image of
[1:51:31] Health
[1:51:33] I could run up a mountain in a pair of
[1:51:36] spikes chop down a tree walked down that
[1:51:38] tree saw all the limbs up cut it up in a
[1:51:40] bunch of logs grabbed my saw and run
[1:51:43] over to the next tree shovel the stump
[1:51:45] all the way down I'm telling you I was
[1:51:46] as hard as this pulpit
[1:51:52] I felt good
[1:51:55] I thought I looked good
[1:52:00] so I said oh God heal me God heal me oh
[1:52:03] I want to be healed I want to be healed
[1:52:05] I just want to be healed I want to
[1:52:06] experience that I wanted to experience
[1:52:09] it walking right over everything he'd
[1:52:11] been doing for me
[1:52:13] set me in the mountains of Montana
[1:52:16] being able to hunt and fish and
[1:52:18] everything was glorious
[1:52:20] and I just never remember one day I'm
[1:52:22] working out there and I'm
[1:52:25] hooking logs up for the the the
[1:52:29] skid loader to pull him up and he put
[1:52:33] this log off of the a log and all of a
[1:52:36] sudden this sapling was laying under
[1:52:38] that log and that sapling come up just
[1:52:41] like a catapult and it come right up
[1:52:43] here and caught me in my arm my hand was
[1:52:47] like that it broke my thumb
[1:52:50] caught me under the arm took my arm out
[1:52:53] a joint flew it up in the air I couldn't
[1:52:56] work
[1:52:59] now I needed healing
[1:53:06] now I needed healing
[1:53:10] now it become a reality
[1:53:12] and I was in a meeting
[1:53:15] and now I couldn't work
[1:53:17] and I finally looked out and said oh God
[1:53:20] heal me
[1:53:21] and I got so desperate I just threw my
[1:53:23] hands up in the air and I said oh God
[1:53:25] heal me
[1:53:27] my hands was up my thumbs were out I was
[1:53:31] going Heal Me Lord Heal Me Lord and all
[1:53:34] of a sudden I was healed
[1:53:35] nothing I did
[1:53:40] of course I learned a great lesson
[1:53:46] realize how it is
[1:53:50] how it was is I was well
[1:53:53] and I should have thanked God
[1:53:55] for it
[1:53:59] I should have recognized where I was at
[1:54:02] and the condition that I was in and not
[1:54:06] been ashamed
[1:54:08] because I could say this if you're
[1:54:10] backslid don't be ashamed
[1:54:16] don't be ashamed
[1:54:19] ask for Revelations
[1:54:23] ask God
[1:54:25] to give you faith
[1:54:28] to overcome
[1:54:31] it's nothing you can do
[1:54:34] you don't have it it has to be given
[1:54:38] alls God wants to see is if you want it
[1:54:45] do you really want to be raptured
[1:54:51] then act accordingly
[1:54:54] do you really want to be separated from
[1:54:58] the things of the world
[1:55:00] then ask him to show you
[1:55:03] what world is in your life
[1:55:08] he promised he wouldn't leave you or
[1:55:11] forsake you he promised he would supply
[1:55:15] all your needs he's with supplied he
[1:55:18] take care of you if you're sick
[1:55:22] and the doctors can't help you
[1:55:25] ask for revelation
[1:55:28] pray for revelation
[1:55:30] can't emphasize to the church enough
[1:55:34] how important it is to pay pray for
[1:55:39] Revelation because Revelation is
[1:55:43] faith
[1:55:44] it's a gift of God
[1:55:46] lest any of us should boast it's nothing
[1:55:50] you can do it's something he gives you
[1:55:54] by his grace
[1:55:56] Lord
[1:55:58] move
[1:56:02] in me
[1:56:06] all the senses are great but they're not
[1:56:09] given to lead you the church is built
[1:56:13] upon Revelation it's not built upon one
[1:56:17] Revelation one time
[1:56:21] it's not how you build a building
[1:56:23] no other greater Foundation can any man
[1:56:27] lay
[1:56:28] but let every man watch how he builds on
[1:56:32] that Foundation whether it's wood hay or
[1:56:35] stubble
[1:56:36] what do we put on our foundation
[1:56:39] by Revelation to Revelation faith upon
[1:56:44] faith upon Faith that's how God's builds
[1:56:48] the church that's how it is that's how
[1:56:50] the Rapture is that's how we're going to
[1:56:53] get in the Rapture that's how we're
[1:56:55] going to get from point A to point B
[1:56:57] he's going to reveal to us reveal to us
[1:57:00] we're going to walk he's going to reveal
[1:57:03] we're going to walk he's going to reveal
[1:57:05] we're going to walk he's going to reveal

[1:57:10] to know it but what happens there's a
[1:57:13] seed in me that he can Quicken there's a
