[23:15] a band if you could just come and take
[23:16] those needs.
[23:24] Let's bow our hearts.
[23:26] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[23:29] humbly come before you once more, Lord.
[23:33] with many requests upon our hearts. Lord
[23:35] Jesus,
[23:37] you've heard them as they've gone forth.
[23:39] Lord,
[23:40] there's not an answer man can give that
[23:43] is better than what you can provide.
[23:45] Lord, we're trusting, Lord, in you
[23:48] because you said in your word, your
[23:50] promise that if we bring all our cares
[23:52] upon you, you take the load. Lord, you
[23:56] said cast your burden upon me, Lord.
[23:59] Sometimes the yoke is too heavy for us,
[24:01] Lord. But if we could give it to you. We
[24:04] weren't made to bear it, Lord. But we
[24:07] were made to surrender it all to you.
[24:09] The one that's got the answers for
[24:11] everything, Lord Jesus. We see the
[24:13] attack on our sister Genie. Lord, the
[24:16] devil's fighting, but we know our God is
[24:19] greater. We know our God is stronger,
[24:22] Lord Jesus. And you work all things for
[24:24] our good, Lord Jesus. Sometimes we have
[24:27] to change how we talk, Lord. It's not
[24:30] this happened to me, but this happened
[24:32] for me, Lord. For you do everything for
[24:35] our betterment, Lord Jesus. We just
[24:37] surrender everything in your hands,
[24:39] Lord. You saw all the uplifted hands
[24:41] that were raised, Lord Jesus. You see
[24:44] the hearts of everyone that is in this
[24:45] house, Lord. Those that are not but have
[24:48] the desire to be here, Lord Jesus. You
[24:50] see their hearts, Father. We want to
[24:52] lift them up now as well, Lord Jesus.
[24:54] And we ask as the word goes forth, Lord
[24:57] Jesus, may we open our minds, our
[24:59] hearts, Lord, let the word sink down
[25:01] deep on the inside, Father, and take
[25:04] your mind, Lord Jesus. It's too late of
[25:07] an hour to be messing around. Father,
[25:09] it's time for soldiers to stand at their
[25:11] post of duty and fight the good fight,
[25:14] Lord. We love you, Lord. We pray for the
[25:16] tithes and the offerings. Lord, bless
[25:18] those that are able to give, Lord Jesus.
[25:21] and give work and jobs to those that
[25:22] have a desire to but aren't able to.
[25:24] Lord, that we might be able to give,
[25:26] Lord, for the furtherance of your
[25:28] kingdom, Lord. We're all looking for
[25:30] that last one, Lord Jesus. And maybe
[25:33] it's the last dollar in our pocket
[25:34] that'll be able to support to get
[25:36] somebody to receive the word, Lord
[25:38] Jesus. Help us have a giving heart, Lord
[25:40] Jesus. Be cheerful in all that we do,
[25:43] Lord. We surrender the rest of the time
[25:45] into your hands, Lord. Giving you full
[25:48] preeminence. have your way, Lord Jesus.
[25:51] There's such an atmosphere, Lord, that
[25:53] comes in moments like these, Lord. It's
[25:56] not because of the noise that you're
[25:57] here, Lord Jesus. But it's because you
[25:59] promised in your word where two or three
[26:01] are gathered, you'd be in our midst,
[26:03] Lord. We know in whom we're standing
[26:05] before, Father. So, we have complete
[26:07] trust knowing the King of Kings is here.
[26:11] The Amen is here, Lord Jesus. So, what
[26:14] can stand against, Lord? We love you,
[26:16] Lord. We ask all these things in the
[26:18] wonderful, precious, mighty,
[26:21] gracious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:23] we pray. Amen.
[26:27] F.
[26:34] The blood
[26:38] that Jesus
[26:42] shed for me
[26:48] way back
[26:51] on high
[26:54] calary.
[26:58] Oh, and a cloud
[27:01] that gives me strength
[27:05] from day
[27:08] to day.
[27:10] Oh, we will never
[27:15] lose
[27:17] it.
[27:21] Oh, and for he reaches
[27:26] to the highest
[27:29] mountain.
[27:33] Oh, let it flow
[27:37] to the Lord
[27:40] with mighty
[27:46] above.
[27:48] and gives me strength
[27:52] from day
[27:54] to day.
[27:57] He will never
[28:01] lose
[28:03] it.
[28:08] Oh, and it's
[28:12] my doubt
[28:15] and cause
[28:17] my fear
[28:21] and
[28:24] it
[28:27] all
[28:29] my feet.
[28:31] Oh, and of
[28:34] thy kiss me straight
[28:37] from day
[28:40] to day.
[28:43] For you will
[28:47] hallelujah
[28:49] for
[28:55] we reach
[28:58] to the high.
[29:01] this mountain
[29:09] to the Lord
[29:13] mighty.
[29:18] The blood
[29:20] that gives me strength
[29:23] from day
[29:26] to day.
[29:29] He will lay
[29:32] her loose.
[29:35] Just sing it one more time. Oh,
[29:40] for it reaches
[29:43] to the highest
[29:47] mountain.
[29:51] Oh mighty flow
[29:58] might be
[30:04] the blood
[30:06] that gives me strength
[30:09] from day
[30:11] to day.
[30:15] He will never
[30:18] lose
[30:21] his power.
[30:24] Hallelujah.
[30:27] All there's a fountain
[30:31] and that is flowing.
[30:35] Oh, and from a place
[30:39] called Calary
[30:43] and his
[30:56] Let's all stand as we sing it.
[30:59] that you
[31:05] let's sing it as we pass all
[31:26] we Oh, I should I
[31:35] was
[31:38] hallelujah.
[31:40] All angels came
[31:44] outside.
[31:46] Oh, this fountain
[31:53] for me.
[32:04] Heat.
[32:13] Heat.
[32:35] Amen. Thank you, Father. Lord, we're so
[32:38] thankful that there's cleansing power in
[32:42] the blood.
[32:45] And Father, that blood takes it to the
[32:47] sea of God's forgetfulness to be
[32:50] remembered no more. flowing from
[32:53] Calvar's mountain. Oh Lord, we're so
[32:56] grateful. We ask you to bless us this
[32:58] evening in our time of fellowship. We
[33:01] ask it in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[33:05] Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn uh
[33:08] to uh the uh book of uh First Kings, the
[33:14] 19th chapter.
[33:16] And we just want to start at the uh
[33:20] ninth verse.
[33:31] uh n Kings 19 and he says, "And he came
[33:36] hither unto a cave and lodged there, and
[33:41] behold, the word of the Lord came to
[33:44] him, and he said unto him,"What dust
[33:48] thou hear, Elijah?
[33:52] And he said, "I have been very jealous
[33:55] for the Lord God of hosts. For the
[33:59] children of Israel have forsaken thy
[34:02] covenant, have thrown down thine altars,
[34:07] and slain the prophets with the sword.
[34:11] And I, even I
[34:15] only am left, and they seek my life to
[34:20] take it away.
[34:22] And he said, "Go forth and stand upon
[34:26] the mount before the Lord, and behold,
[34:30] the Lord passs by, and a great and
[34:33] strong wind the mountains, and break in
[34:38] pieces the rocks before the Lord, but
[34:41] the Lord was not in the wind." And after
[34:45] the wind, an earthquake, but the Lord
[34:49] was not in the earthquake. And after the
[34:53] earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not
[34:57] in the fire. And after the fire, a still
[35:03] small voice. And it was so when Elijah
[35:07] heard it that he wrapped his face in his
[35:10] mantel and went out and stood in the
[35:14] entering of the cave. And behold, there
[35:17] came a voice unto him, saying, What dust
[35:21] thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I have
[35:24] been very zealous for the Lord God of
[35:27] hosts, because the Lord of Israel hath
[35:31] forsaken thy covenant, tore down thine
[35:34] altars, and slain thy prophets with the
[35:37] sword, and I, even I only am left, and
[35:42] seek my life, and they seek my life to
[35:46] take it away." Amen. You may be seated.
[35:49] Lord add his blessing to the reading of
[35:52] the word. Uh
[35:58] we
[36:00] if you follow the story farther
[36:04] Elijah finds out that he had that 7,000
[36:09] had not bowed their knee to the Lord.
[36:12] But I just wanted to to uh I want to
[36:16] listen to this evening. Uh we're just
[36:18] going to listen to about 45 minutes of
[36:22] the tape that we referred to this
[36:24] morning, the way back. And I I I just
[36:29] thought in that scripture how beautiful
[36:32] that it is because he says that God
[36:36] wasn't in all the thunders and all the
[36:38] mountains and the wind and the fire and
[36:41] all those things, but he was in the
[36:43] still small voice.
[36:45] And even when the Lord moves in a mighty
[36:49] way,
[36:51] &gt;&gt; uh we could have a wonderful worship
[36:53] service. We could uh we could have an
[36:57] anointed ministry
[36:59] that you you just know it's the
[37:01] anointing of God and it just encourages
[37:04] you and and and raises you up and sets
[37:07] you on fire. But in all that, if there's
[37:11] not a still small voice
[37:14] &gt;&gt; in that speaking to you, it'll never
[37:17] take effect.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And even when you when you're listening
[37:21] to a minister preach and if he's under
[37:24] the anointing or whatever style that he
[37:27] has, I I listen to some ministers, they
[37:29] they've just got a humor that just gets
[37:32] you and and and and you enjoy the word
[37:35] or or they're a deep teacher. It doesn't
[37:37] matter what that it is. When it all
[37:40] comes down to, it comes down to what is
[37:43] speaking to you from the inside out
[37:46] &gt;&gt; because God works on the inside.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; And so you we've got to just if I can
[37:53] say that is understand as we listen uh
[37:58] to this message that the messenger is
[38:01] going to preach. You know, I I I I just
[38:05] see how he just starts out preaching and
[38:07] then how he just comes into the
[38:09] anointing and the words just coming
[38:11] forth. But it doesn't do you any good if
[38:15] if it doesn't
[38:18] raise up and you don't hear that still
[38:22] small voice speaking to you. And that's
[38:25] why that
[38:27] sometimes brother Brandon makes the most
[38:29] profound statements
[38:32] and deep statements in just the calmst,
[38:37] mildest, casual
[38:40] way.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; He'd just be talking and he'll say
[38:44] something that's just absolutely
[38:48] &gt;&gt; if you stop and think,
[38:50] &gt;&gt; "Wow, that's unbelievable.
[38:54] And and what does that is the still
[38:57] small voice. And so that it as we're
[39:02] talking about that each of you have that
[39:05] still small voice because each of you
[39:08] have that inner man on the inside that
[39:12] that that voice of conscience that God
[39:16] put there to speak to you. And you don't
[39:20] want to substitute that for anything. So
[39:24] it doesn't matter the the the type of
[39:27] ministry. It doesn't matter whether it's
[39:30] evangelistic, whether it's teaching,
[39:33] whether it's pastorial
[39:35] or whatever type of the teaching,
[39:37] whatever
[39:39] power that it comes into or how it
[39:42] stimulates you intellectually,
[39:44] emotionally, all those things are fine.
[39:47] But along with that,
[39:50] &gt;&gt; you have to have the still small voice.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; That thing that begins to talk to you on
[39:57] the inside when something said and it
[40:00] brings you under conviction and and and
[40:04] you got that's where God is. He's in the
[40:08] still small voice speaking to you. The
[40:11] wonderful still small voice. and and uh
[40:16] sometimes it comes in conviction,
[40:18] sometimes it comes in many different
[40:20] ways. Sometimes it's just something
[40:22] inside you saying you know you're not
[40:25] doing right or also it's something it's
[40:29] an uncction that says you ought to do
[40:31] this, you ought to do that. So as we
[40:34] listen to this, I know we are believers
[40:36] here, so we know we're going to hear the
[40:38] truth. But along with listening, listen,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; you you know what I mean? So listen for
[40:48] the still small voice. And and you know,
[40:53] I I'm a I'm a firm believer in in the
[40:56] storehouse. I just have to be honest
[40:59] with you that that uh you know that God
[41:04] he knew there would be a famine in the
[41:06] land so he stored up spiritual food that
[41:09] we can we can go back and and in this
[41:13] hour that we live in
[41:16] there's there there's not a question
[41:20] because he preserved to us the voice and
[41:24] and he and you know we think sometimes
[41:26] science science is is all for Satan.
[41:29] Now, God, he he allowed the science
[41:33] &gt;&gt; so he could capture the voice for us.
[41:36] So, I can sit here today and listen to
[41:40] the voice of God
[41:42] &gt;&gt; and and through that voice listen to the
[41:45] still small voice and and let God speak
[41:50] to you. I believe the tape's a couple
[41:52] hours long. There's tremendous
[41:55] discernment at the end of it. But but
[41:59] God can speak to you this evening in in
[42:02] in just a a way. And and it's not
[42:05] consensus. You know, it's not what we
[42:07] all believe he said. There's things he
[42:10] says that we all agree on, but it
[42:12] becomes personal
[42:15] &gt;&gt; and when the still small voice
[42:18] speaks to you. So don't always start to
[42:21] listen when there's the thunder and the
[42:24] lightning and the wind, but always be
[42:28] listening to that still small voice. So
[42:30] this is the way back. Uh he's going to
[42:33] read the same scriptures we read this
[42:36] morning. I'm going to play the uh I'm
[42:39] going to play it from the beginning.
[42:42] um uh just uh you know he talks about
[42:46] tickets for the full gospel business and
[42:48] things that don't seem to be any ma
[42:51] matter but I I just like you to see the
[42:55] way that he approaches the people and
[42:58] then how he goes on to speak sometimes
[43:02] saying s such
[43:04] very straightforward things but yet you
[43:08] can feel the love that he has you know
[43:11] what I mean? He he really has the same
[43:16] spirit of Elijah. They have tore down my
[43:19] altars. They have killed my prophets.
[43:23] You know, they seek to kill me. And
[43:27] that's what the church was doing. It was
[43:30] leaving the real true word of God. And
[43:33] we had a voice that spoke out and called
[43:36] us back to that. This still is the the
[43:40] hour and the word of restoration. So,
[43:44] uh, we've read the word of God, so we
[43:47] will not stand when Brother Brandham
[43:49] reads the scripture, but I I I trust
[43:51] you'll enjoy just 45 minutes. It's 5:40,
[43:55] so that means we we should be done by
[43:58] 6:30 and we'll we'll let you go. So, God
[44:01] bless you and and and enjoy this
[44:05] message. Uh, thank you.
[44:11] You may be seated.
[44:25] again
[44:34] before
[44:36] Yay. I sing with the Yord.
[44:54] Marvelous to see the simplicity of the
[44:57] working of the spirit and people who are
[45:01] uh just humble enough to listen and
[45:05] believe it and just keep it how we think
[45:08] that exhortation
[45:10] from God that we should be waiting and
[45:14] he'll do a work among us.
[45:18] We thank him. Now, uh, it was a little
[45:21] long last night. I just got in and few
[45:24] minutes ago and and I was sorry to keep
[45:27] you standing like that and, um, try to
[45:31] hurry up tonight if I possibly can. And
[45:33] tomorrow morning, the businessman's
[45:35] breakfast at the Washington.
[45:38] And um uh I was just told by a brother
[45:42] who has the tickets that the tickets
[45:44] must be purchased tonight on kind of
[45:46] having enough room to see when they get
[45:48] enough uh room sold out for in the
[45:51] morning so they can have the things
[45:52] ready. And he said be sure to get your
[45:54] tickets. I suppose they'll be at the
[45:56] front of the uh room up there uh tonight
[46:00] and tomorrow night if the Lord willing.
[46:03] I want to never know but just thinking
[46:06] if he's willing I'd like to speak on a
[46:08] special something tomorrow night that is
[46:10] on we have all things in Christ. I a
[46:14] little familiar text but today it just
[46:17] come to me and I just want to talk on it
[46:20] tomorrow night the Lord willing. Then I
[46:22] think we have a Sunday morning and then
[46:24] Sunday night the Lord willing I want to
[46:27] preach on the subject the countdown
[46:30] ready for the church to move out. See
[46:32] the countdown thing. You know what the
[46:34] countdown is. And um I believe we can
[46:37] prove it by the scriptures that we're
[46:39] right now in the countdown.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Now, so pray for us. And if you haven't
[46:45] got any church to go to Sunday morning,
[46:48] we'd be glad to have you here Sunday
[46:50] night. Of course, if you got your own
[46:51] church, that's your first post of duty.
[46:54] We expect you to attend that. But if you
[46:58] um don't, while we'd be glad to have
[47:00] you. And um I
[47:03] understand that tonight if we can get
[47:05] through quick enough, we're going to
[47:07] have a a little prayer line. Billy said
[47:09] he'd give out some prayer cards here. I
[47:11] think that was right. Yeah. That we're
[47:14] going to have a prayer line to pray for
[47:15] the sick. And sometimes I somebody has
[47:20] told me lots of times said, "You ought
[47:21] to stay with that praying for the sick.
[47:23] You ought to try to do this other."
[47:25] Somebody's called me not long ago and
[47:28] said, "What are you always picking on
[47:30] them women for?"
[47:34] Well, I'm not picking on them. He said,
[47:36] "Well," I said, "Won't you leave them
[47:38] women alone?"
[47:41] said all them men about their
[47:43] organization and everything. Very
[47:45] prominent brother. And I said, "You
[47:49] don't believe it that scriptural for him
[47:50] to do that, do you?" He said, "No, but
[47:53] said," didn't the Lord call you to pray
[47:54] for sick? I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Well,
[47:57] won't you stay with that?' I said, 'I
[47:58] do.' And he said, let if he called you
[48:01] to pray for sick, let let the preachers
[48:03] take care of that. I said, but they're
[48:05] not doing it.
[48:09] He said,
[48:11] he said, "Well, I said I I
[48:16] got to." He said, "Well, most of the
[48:18] people in I know I guess million people
[48:21] consider you to be a prophet." I said,
[48:22] "I'm not no prophet." He said, "But the
[48:25] people think of you that way." He said,
[48:27] "Frankly, I do myself." I said, "Thank
[48:29] you." I said, "Sometimes he shows me
[48:32] things that's coming and never lied to
[48:35] me yet, and he won't because he's God.
[48:37] He can't. And um and he said, "Well, uh
[48:40] if you be
[48:42] God's servant like that, why don't you
[48:44] teach them women and things how to
[48:46] receive high spiritual gifts instead of
[48:48] keep fussing at him about cutting their
[48:50] hair and wearing shorts and makeup and
[48:52] things?" Said, "You ought to teach them
[48:54] greater things and how they can receive
[48:56] great gifts and do something." I said,
[48:58] "How you going to teach algebra when
[49:00] they won't even listen to their ABCs?"
[49:06] learn that and then we'll start on
[49:07] something else. And sounds rather
[49:10] sacriiggious. An old minister, thank
[49:12] you. An old minister one time went to
[49:16] hold a a meeting at a place and he said
[49:19] preached the first night on repentance,
[49:21] the second night on repentance, the
[49:22] third night, fourth night, fifth night.
[49:24] The deacons met him back there and said,
[49:26] "Brother, we enjoy that message on
[49:28] repentance." But said, "Have you got
[49:30] something else you can preach on?" He
[49:31] said, "Oh yes. I'll wait till they all
[49:33] repent first and then start on something
[49:35] else. So
[49:37] I walk into the house of God and see
[49:39] every thing lined up looking fine. Then
[49:41] we start something else.
[49:44] So So you're you I do desire your prayer
[49:47] and I don't say those things to be bad.
[49:50] You know that
[49:52] I'm zealous.
[49:54] It's God's daughters. It's God's sons.
[49:58] And we ought to behave like that. We
[50:00] ought to act like it. and try to come up
[50:03] with it. I'm way short. Ask your prayers
[50:05] for me and I'm praying for you. So,
[50:08] we'll pray together for each other and
[50:10] maybe someday God will bring us all
[50:12] together and a great something. He'll
[50:14] take us up out of all this chaos here.
[50:16] Anyhow, I'm kind of getting tired of
[50:18] this old pest house. Anyhow, aren't you?
[50:20] I like to take a solo flight one of
[50:22] these mornings when he comes. Now,
[50:26] I gave out last night that after talking
[50:29] about the Jubilee and calling to return
[50:32] back to the original Pentecost and to
[50:36] the message, I said tonight I would try
[50:39] to speak a little bit on how to get
[50:41] back. You know, there's no need to tell
[50:43] anybody what to do unless you tell them
[50:45] how to do it. That's the uh thing. Now,
[50:50] there's the text that I want to read.
[50:52] I've I've used it before, but maybe not
[50:55] exactly in this way, but I thought it
[50:58] fit in good and I just have to bring it
[51:00] that way. So, I'm think that
[51:05] uh bringing this on how to get back and
[51:09] there's many ways out, but there's only
[51:12] one way back.
[51:15] I was a fellow said one time in in the
[51:18] mountains, he was we was up there,
[51:21] another fellow and I who were licensed
[51:23] guides in Colorado, he had a group of
[51:26] people on the other side, a little dude
[51:28] outfit and they brought some fellas in
[51:29] there and the guide himself got lost and
[51:32] he was wandering around back there. He
[51:34] drove up where we was at on a horse. He
[51:36] said, "Hey."
[51:38] This fellow was with me, Mr. Jeff, kind
[51:40] of a quick spoken man. He said, "Hey."
[51:43] said, "How you get out of here?" He
[51:44] said, "How'd you get in here?" He said,
[51:47] "That way." Well, then that's the way
[51:48] out. So, the way back again. So, that's
[51:52] it. It's just it. Let us read now in the
[51:56] book of 2 Kings and the first chapter of
[52:01] Second Kings, two or three verses. And
[52:03] we want to take a a subject
[52:06] and use for a text
[52:09] the way back.
[52:13] Then Moab rebelled against Israel after
[52:15] the death of Ahab. And Ahaz fell down
[52:18] through the lattice in the upper chamber
[52:21] that was in Samara and was sick. And he
[52:24] sent messengers and said unto them, "Go
[52:26] and inquire of Beelzebub, the God of
[52:29] Acre, whether I shall recover of this
[52:32] disease."
[52:34] But the angel of the Lord said unto
[52:36] Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, and go up
[52:40] and meet the messengers of the king of
[52:42] Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not
[52:46] because there's not a God in Israel that
[52:50] you go to inquire of Beelub, the God of
[52:55] Acre?"
[52:56] And then I heard brother Moore a few
[52:59] moments ago on the uh intercom there uh
[53:04] speak and he didn't know what I was
[53:05] going to read this for a text on talking
[53:07] about a bomb
[53:10] and I want to read that in Jeremiah
[53:12] 8:22.
[53:14] Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no
[53:17] physician there? Why then is not the
[53:20] health of the daughter of my people
[53:22] recovered?
[53:24] a question why
[53:27] why isn't the health of my people
[53:29] recovered now I would like to say that
[53:34] we are most happy to be enjoying this
[53:38] great time of fellowship and I hope that
[53:42] the Lord will not let one person come in
[53:45] here without being saved and one without
[53:47] the Holy Ghost but one will be filled
[53:49] with the Holy Ghost and every sick
[53:50] person be healed. I'm just looking
[53:53] forward to that and we're believing it.
[53:56] Now, our story starts off tonight with a
[54:00] people that had like last night had got
[54:02] away from God. And that's the most
[54:05] miserable thing that I could think of is
[54:08] someone a believer away from God.
[54:12] And we find out here that this king of
[54:14] Samaria hasn't the reason he was away
[54:18] from God because he had the wrong kind
[54:20] of tutoring, the wrong kind of raising.
[54:24] His mother was a heathen and his father
[54:27] was a backsliden Israelite, Ahab. And
[54:31] through there, he hadn't had very much
[54:33] bringing up in the way of the Lord,
[54:35] though by the people. And God has never
[54:39] left himself without a witness.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And God had a witness in that day. But
[54:46] his father hated this witness. And his
[54:49] name was Elijah the prophet. And his
[54:52] mother hated this witness.
[54:55] But yet it was God's witness stood just
[54:57] the same. God's always got a people
[55:01] somewhere that he can point to and say,
[55:03] "That's it.
[55:05] Oh, I want to be among that number.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we all want to be there. It's
[55:11] the desire of every heart. We want to be
[55:13] among that number that God can say,
[55:16] "This is my people."
[55:18] Look at them. They're an example of what
[55:20] I am. They are reflecting my life and
[55:24] theirs. They have surrendered their life
[55:26] and I'm reflecting mine life through
[55:28] theirs. What a beautiful thing. What a
[55:31] how it must make God feel good to know
[55:33] that he's got somebody he can put trust
[55:35] in. And he had a man and his name was
[55:38] Elijah. And now this man God had
[55:41] blessed. Not always material blessings
[55:44] mean that you're you're right with God
[55:46] because he caused the wicked to prosper.
[55:49] But this man had had succeeded his
[55:54] father his father's death and Ahaza had
[55:58] preceded him and he was going right in
[56:01] the same way his father was going and
[56:03] his mother doing wrong before God and he
[56:08] fell to the lattice in his house and was
[56:11] sick perhaps maybe it mashed him up
[56:14] inside inwardly bleeding or or some
[56:17] disease set in maybe an infection from
[56:19] his fall might have broke his ribs or
[56:22] punctured his lungs or something that he
[56:25] was uh very sick and he wondered about
[56:29] whether he was going to live or not. And
[56:32] so instead of going to him, what he
[56:34] should do, he sent some messengers,
[56:37] perhaps a palace guard that he had
[56:40] confidence in, sent him over to Acorn,
[56:43] to the god Beelub,
[56:46] uh, devil, a fortune teller, over there
[56:51] to inquire whether he was going to live
[56:53] or not. Now, what a rude thing that
[56:57] would be for a man who was king over a
[57:00] supposed to be spiritual people. A
[57:03] people who believed in God and yet their
[57:06] own leader consulting something else
[57:08] besides the thing that he ought to
[57:10] consult him.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He ought to know the he knowed the laws.
[57:15] They were priests in the land. There
[57:17] were churches and so forth. And there
[57:19] was a prophet who had the word of the
[57:22] Lord. And instead of doing that, he
[57:24] wanted to take the most popular route.
[57:27] I think that's what's the matter today.
[57:30] We want that that most popular route.
[57:35] And when God makes a way, the people
[57:37] gets away from him and God makes a way
[57:40] for that people to return back to him
[57:43] like I was speaking of last night. And
[57:45] the people refuse to do it. Then God
[57:48] asked why. He always asked that. Why
[57:52] didn't you do it? So if he makes a way
[57:55] and we refuse to do it, then then he
[57:58] asks why we didn't do it. And I would
[58:01] rather get it fixed up here than to wait
[58:03] for him to ask me judgment why I didn't
[58:04] do it. Uh some man's sins go before
[58:07] them. Others follow. I want mine to go
[58:10] on before me. Confess and then I I want
[58:13] to be right when that time comes. As the
[58:16] old colored brother said, you know, a
[58:19] long time ago said, I talked to the Lord
[58:21] and I told him I wanted my way clear. I
[58:24] didn't want no trouble when I come down
[58:25] to the river. So, I think that's about
[58:28] the way we all feel. That kind of
[58:29] expresses it that we don't want no
[58:31] trouble at the river because it's going
[58:33] to be a awful push and shoving time at
[58:36] that time. So, we want to be sure that
[58:38] we're right.
[58:40] Now
[58:43] this king, there was a way provided for
[58:46] him to find out from the Lord, but he
[58:50] refused to do it.
[58:53] And then God took his provided way,
[58:57] which was his prophet. And maybe the
[59:00] king didn't even consider this uh
[59:03] whiskered, bald-headed fell uh that was
[59:07] not very well thought of amongst the
[59:09] people. His message was always
[59:11] condemning and biting and shoving and
[59:13] the people around because he couldn't do
[59:16] nothing else. He was a prophet. The word
[59:19] of the Lord comes to the prophet and the
[59:21] prophet has to stand on the word. And
[59:22] when the word's not obeyed, there's
[59:24] nothing to do but rebuke. That's all. So
[59:27] this fellow didn't mean to be bad. He
[59:29] just had to do it because he was not
[59:32] governed by his own thoughts. He was
[59:34] governed by the spirit of God.
[59:36] And that's the way we all should be
[59:39] governed by the spirit of God. And if we
[59:41] are, then we see sin, it makes us sick.
[59:44] There's something about it. It even
[59:46] grieved God's heart. One time he ever
[59:48] made a man because sin was so awful in
[59:52] the earth. Now,
[59:55] so he asked God had a way for him to
[59:58] know it, but he didn't take that way. He
[1:00:00] took the most popular way that there was
[1:00:02] among the people. And uh I hate to say
[1:00:06] this, but we're always seeing slogans,
[1:00:09] America back to God, back to God hour
[1:00:12] and things like that, but the thing of
[1:00:14] it is they want to come back the way
[1:00:16] that man has achieved for them to come
[1:00:18] back. They want to come back in their
[1:00:20] own way of thinking, their own way of
[1:00:23] doing. And usually it's contrary from
[1:00:26] God's way of returning. And then when
[1:00:29] they turned DOWN GOD'S PROVIDED way for
[1:00:31] them to return, then they God asked them
[1:00:35] why why did you do it that way? Now like
[1:00:39] we call a a time now the used to be the
[1:00:42] presidents would say we'll call a 15
[1:00:45] minutes of prayer all the machinery
[1:00:48] stop. That'll never do it. IT'S GOT TO
[1:00:51] TAKE A BREAKING UP.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; It's got to take a dying out.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; It's got to take a regeneration. It
[1:00:58] don't take an hour of prayer. It takes
[1:01:00] until
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; you come back.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; It's a bringing back coming back to the
[1:01:07] facts of faith and coming back to not
[1:01:10] even that it's not a something that you
[1:01:13] imagine or a declaration of creeds or or
[1:01:16] some through some instrumentality of man
[1:01:19] but it's through knowing Christ himself.
[1:01:22] Know him not even the word. He if you
[1:01:25] know him, you know the word because he
[1:01:27] is the word.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Then you've got to come back to that
[1:01:30] reality. Uh God wants to manifest
[1:01:34] himself to his people and the church
[1:01:37] wants to manifest itself to the people.
[1:01:41] More numbers, bigger crowds, richer
[1:01:43] people, so forth like that. BETTER
[1:01:46] DRESSED. THAT'S WHAT'S GOT US IN THE
[1:01:47] CHAOS we're in. IT
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; BE BETTER OFF IF WE ALL WORE SACKCLOTH.
[1:01:52] IT'D BE BETTER OFF IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A
[1:01:54] JOB,
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; be going to one another's house and and
[1:01:57] see if we could get something to eat.
[1:01:59] I'd rather be see the church in that
[1:02:01] condition and yet spiritfilled than to
[1:02:04] see it WELL POLISHED AND DRESSED IN BIG
[1:02:06] things and then dying in the spirit.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; God makes a way and we refuse it. We
[1:02:14] don't return the way that he provides
[1:02:15] for us to return. And Hezekiah did the
[1:02:19] same thing. He was like many of us
[1:02:21] today. He was just too stubborn.
[1:02:25] HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO. YET, he knew
[1:02:28] ELIJAH WAS OUT THERE IN THE WILDERNESS.
[1:02:30] He knew THAT THERE WAS A GOD IN HEAVEN,
[1:02:32] BUT HE WANTED TO TAKE THE MOST POPULAR
[1:02:34] WAY, go over to where all the people
[1:02:36] through uh the prophetist they had had
[1:02:40] there, the
[1:02:42] Ahab's wife Jezebel, and she was a
[1:02:44] heathen. They wanted to go over to Acron
[1:02:47] and consult one of the idols if he would
[1:02:49] return because being a king if he would
[1:02:53] lower his self down uh get himself
[1:02:57] unpopular with the people. That's a
[1:02:59] trouble. That's a trouble the way our
[1:03:02] women do today. That's the reason that
[1:03:04] man YOU TALK ABOUT CHRISTIANITY SAY I
[1:03:07] BELONG to so and so that don't have
[1:03:09] nothing to do with it. I I may belong to
[1:03:12] a certain organization. That still don't
[1:03:15] mean you're a Christian.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Christianity doesn't consist of joining
[1:03:19] something. Christianity consists of a a
[1:03:23] family. A birth into a family.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You are a Christian by birth. But it's
[1:03:30] most popular say I'm Methodist, Baptist,
[1:03:32] Presbyterian, Pentecostal or something.
[1:03:34] I I'm that saying saying I'm born again
[1:03:38] of the spirit of God. the Holy Ghost has
[1:03:40] come upon me and I'm a new creature in
[1:03:43] Christ.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's the that's the way. But the king
[1:03:46] wanted to be popular and that's the way
[1:03:48] the people take it today. And they might
[1:03:51] put revivals across the country and uh
[1:03:54] have slogans of a million more in so
[1:03:56] many years or uh increase their
[1:03:59] membership and their scholarship and
[1:04:01] what more and it'll NEVER NEVER YOU'RE
[1:04:04] GOING FARTHER AWAY ALL THE TIME.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WAY BACK. GOD HAS A WAY BACK.
[1:04:10] I want to speak to you about that way
[1:04:12] back.
[1:04:13] And uh you must come back the WAY THAT
[1:04:16] GOD PROVIDED FOR YOU TO come back. Now,
[1:04:20] let's talk on these this king just for a
[1:04:22] moment. The reason he didn't want to
[1:04:24] because he was stubborn. He just didn't
[1:04:27] he just wanted to be like the other
[1:04:29] people. um he uh had his own ways and he
[1:04:34] wanted to be that way and he wanted to
[1:04:36] be come back the popular way and um he
[1:04:40] didn't want to take the way that God
[1:04:41] provided for him. So he just ignored
[1:04:44] that prophet and what the prophet would
[1:04:46] say because oh no doubt the prophet
[1:04:48] would sharply tell him repent.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; GET RIGHT WITH GOD. YOU'RE NOT FIT TO BE
[1:04:54] A KING. And oh how that would droop his
[1:04:57] feathers down before the people. See as
[1:04:59] a king. Oh my. He couldn't stand that.
[1:05:02] So maybe the devil over there and and
[1:05:04] the idol would say oh great king Dr. So
[1:05:08] and so you're Jesse. he could be popular
[1:05:10] amongst the people and have a great
[1:05:12] famous name. Oh, how people love the
[1:05:15] praises of things. And so he thought if
[1:05:18] he could get that, why he'd be stuck up
[1:05:20] before the people. He'd be a polished
[1:05:22] man before the people. And I hope you're
[1:05:25] reading between the lines while I'm
[1:05:26] meaning. So then he thought he'd be a
[1:05:29] great person, BUT HE WOULDN'T COME down
[1:05:31] to that man who had telling the truth.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And he really thought he's putting
[1:05:35] something over on him. So he sent the
[1:05:38] servants. He said, "Go over and inquire
[1:05:39] of the god of acronyub if I'm going to
[1:05:43] get well of this disease or not." And
[1:05:45] the LORD GOD KNOWS THE HEART OF EVERY
[1:05:48] MAN.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; He knows the intention.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, "You can't hide nothing
[1:05:53] from God."
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; No, sir. HE SAID, "GO UP there in the
[1:05:59] road and meet him." AND ASKED HIM, "WHY
[1:06:03] DOES HE DO A THING LIKE THAT? IS IT
[1:06:05] BECAUSE there is not a God in Israel? Is
[1:06:10] it because he don't have a prophet? Is
[1:06:12] it BECAUSE THAT THESE THINGS DON'T
[1:06:15] EXIST? THEN WHY WOULD HE GO OVER DO A
[1:06:18] THING LIKE THAT YET BEING AN ISRAELITE?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I WONDER WHY THAT MEN AND WOMEN TRY TO
[1:06:24] DENOMINATE PEOPLE INTO A FELLOWSHIP OF
[1:06:29] OF DENOMINATION INSTEAD OF BRINGING THEM
[1:06:31] BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATION.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL RIGHT.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS ABOUT IT.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THE MOST POPULAR WAY.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; I belong to so and so. I'm Dr. So and so
[1:06:45] from certain certain organization. I'm
[1:06:46] for Purdue. I I have a scholarship of so
[1:06:49] and so. I got my PhD, my LLD. That don't
[1:06:52] mean nothing to God.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Not a thing.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Elijah might not had a LLD or PhD.
[1:07:00] Frankly, we don't know nothing about
[1:07:01] him. He just come on the scene and went
[1:07:03] off the scene the same way. We don't
[1:07:05] know who his pap and mama was. Don't
[1:07:06] know nothing ABOUT HIM. BUT GOD KNEW
[1:07:08] ABOUT HIM.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; He found a man that he could use. AND
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; HE FOUND A MAN THAT WASN'T AFRAID. NO
[1:07:16] MATTER THE WHOLE NATION AGAINST HIM, HE
[1:07:18] STILL CALLED BLACK, BLACK AND WHITE.
[1:07:19] WHITE.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; God sent us another. That's right. Send
[1:07:24] us somebody that's not afraid. Somebody
[1:07:26] that don't uh re have to have the honor
[1:07:29] and praises of man. SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS
[1:07:31] ONLY TO GOD and believes God and speaks
[1:07:34] the truth.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; That person will do that. GOD WILL
[1:07:36] VINDICATE THAT TRUTH TO be truth.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Tell me what man could close the heavens
[1:07:41] in the days of his prayer. Could Acre
[1:07:43] and the God of Acre do it? Could the God
[1:07:46] of Achre do the things that Elijah did?
[1:07:47] Certainly not. Show that there was a
[1:07:49] living God with Elijah. But this man was
[1:07:52] so stuck up and popped up to he didn't
[1:07:55] want to lower himself to such a thing.
[1:07:59] BUT ELIJAH GIRDED HIMSELF UP, WENT UP
[1:08:02] THERE AND stood in the road. This old
[1:08:04] woolly looking fell standing out there.
[1:08:07] He didn't have on a clergy coat and so
[1:08:09] forth, but he he had a woolly face and
[1:08:12] maybe his bald head sunburned and his
[1:08:15] hair sticking out. You'd probably run
[1:08:17] him away if he was begging and come up
[1:08:19] there and stood in the road like that.
[1:08:21] The Bible said he was hairy all over and
[1:08:24] he had a piece of leather girded around
[1:08:25] him. That wasn't very much of a clergy
[1:08:27] suit, but he couldn't show any
[1:08:29] credentials or what fellowship he come
[1:08:31] from. But brother, he had it beneath his
[1:08:33] heart. HE WAS IN FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD CUZ
[1:08:35] HE HAD thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; That's the way back.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He had thus sayeth the Lord. Wasn't much
[1:08:45] to look at but earn that little old
[1:08:47] skinny body be a heart that God lived
[1:08:50] in. Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; He stood up there in the road with his
[1:08:52] hands folded, watched them come up,
[1:08:54] stood right in their way, and when they
[1:08:57] got up, uh, he probably crossed the
[1:08:58] path, stood there. He said, "RETURN AND
[1:09:02] GO BACK." AND ASKED HIM, "WHY DO YOU DO
[1:09:06] A THING LIKE IT IS because there's no
[1:09:08] God in Israel? Doesn't he have a prophet
[1:09:11] to consult these things? Because he's
[1:09:13] done this." TELL HIM, "THUS SAYAITH THE
[1:09:15] LORD, HE'S NOT coming off of that bed."
[1:09:17] Oh my. God will work his way despite
[1:09:20] anything anybody else can do about it.
[1:09:22] God's going to do it. He's going to do
[1:09:24] it in his own way.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; We ain't going to stop it at all. We're
[1:09:27] not going to even hinder it. That's all.
[1:09:30] He's going to do it anyhow. He's going
[1:09:31] to have a church. I don't care who says
[1:09:33] he won't and how many unbelievers rise
[1:09:36] up. God's going to have a church without
[1:09:38] spot or wrinkle. He's going to be there.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; He done said he was.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; I just strive to be part of it. That's
[1:09:45] all. Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; He might send preachers across the
[1:09:48] country preaching. Everybody might turn
[1:09:50] them down, throw them in jail, kick them
[1:09:51] out of town. He'll have the church just
[1:09:53] the same.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; As old John said, God's able of these
[1:09:56] stones to rise children of Abraham.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; God's still God.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; He can do he Paul where the the church
[1:10:04] in their decision had made a Aaron
[1:10:07] choose metheus. But that Paul a little
[1:10:09] old hooknose hottempered Jew. He said,
[1:10:12] "I'm going to show you what I'm going to
[1:10:13] do with him." He made him one of the
[1:10:15] greatest apostles of all of them because
[1:10:18] it was a work of God did something.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Now we find this prophet speaking in the
[1:10:25] name of the Lord and sending him back.
[1:10:28] And the king said, "WHAT KIND OF A MAN
[1:10:30] STOPS YOU?" BUT he was a funny looking
[1:10:32] fellow. Said he was hairy all over and
[1:10:35] he had a piece of of leather about his
[1:10:38] loins. He said that was Elijah the
[1:10:41] Tishbite. He know his number was up.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; He knowed something was wrong. When that
[1:10:47] Elijah come back and said, "Tell him,
[1:10:49] thus sayeth the Lord, he's not coming
[1:10:51] off of that van." Oh my. That settled
[1:10:54] it.
[1:10:55] People today question.
[1:10:59] It's just like a a patient
[1:11:02] LAYING ON A DOCTOR'S STEP when the
[1:11:05] doctor has medicine for the patient's
[1:11:08] disease
[1:11:10] and the patient refuses to take that
[1:11:12] medicine
[1:11:15] for his inoculation
[1:11:17] and he MAY BE SO CLOSE TO THE REMEDY
[1:11:20] UNTIL HE IS SET RIGHT ON THE DOCTOR'S
[1:11:23] DOORSTEP AND DIE.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. is because he refuses the remedy.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing in church.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; NOW THEY SIT RIGHT IN THE PEW AND DIE
[1:11:39] SINNERS,
[1:11:41] DIE UNBELIEVERS.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NO REMEDY.
[1:11:46] THERE'S A BOMB in Gilead.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; BUT UH IT'S THE PEOPLE'S OWN STUBBORN
[1:11:53] WILL.
[1:11:55] There's plenty of Holy Spirit,
[1:11:58] but it's THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT IT.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus said THE SICK NEEDS A DOCTOR.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IF THE DOCTOR COMES AND THE
[1:12:09] SICK WON'T ACCEPT THE DOCTOR?
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT GOOD CAN THE DOCTOR DO?
[1:12:16] WE NEED A DOCTOR
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; AND A PATIENT NEEDS TO TAKE HIS MEDICINE
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS IS a sick world and a sick
[1:12:25] church at a sick time,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:29] So if the patient dies sitting on the
[1:12:33] DOCTOR'S STEPS NOW, YOU CAN'T BLAME THE
[1:12:37] DOCTOR.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF HE PROVES HE'S GOT THE MEDICINE
[1:12:41] IN THERE FOR THE REMEDY,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; got the medicine in there for his for
[1:12:46] his for the remedy for his cure. AND THE
[1:12:49] PATIENT SITS on the steps and I ain't
[1:12:51] going in there. While inside is THE
[1:12:54] REMEDY, WELL, YOU'VE GOT CERTAIN
[1:12:56] DISEASE. WHY? HE'S GOT A MEDICINE
[1:12:58] CABINET FULL IN THERE THAT'LL KILL THAT
[1:13:00] DISEASE. IT'S A POISON DRUG THAT'LL
[1:13:03] KNOCK THAT DISEASE OUT. HERE'S OTHERS.
[1:13:07] THEY GOT HEALED. Look at them. They had
[1:13:09] that disease and they've got it NO MORE.
[1:13:10] AND THE DOCTOR'S GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINE.
[1:13:12] AND YOU SIT ON THE STEP AND SAY, "WELL,
[1:13:14] I COME THIS FAR. If he wants me to get
[1:13:16] healed, he'll come out here and do it."
[1:13:18] Oh, no. No, no, that's not it. NO.
[1:13:22] YOU'LL DIE ON THE steps and it won't be
[1:13:25] the doctor's fault. Neither will it be
[1:13:27] the lack of medicine. Is because of the
[1:13:30] own stubborn will of the people that
[1:13:31] wouldn't take the medicine. And the
[1:13:33] church is the same. WE'VE GOT PLENTY of
[1:13:37] scripture. WE GOT THE THING THAT'LL
[1:13:40] STRAIGHTEN THE CHURCH OUT.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE THING THAT'LL SEND YOU BACK
[1:13:44] TO WHERE YOU WAS 50 YEARS AGO.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO TAKE IT.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO WANT TO GET WELL. A CURE
[1:13:53] of these diseases, THESE SPIRITUAL
[1:13:56] DISEASES MUST have it.
[1:14:00] Now, it's a dangerous thing. we had in
[1:14:03] our country just now that salt vaccine.
[1:14:07] Uh they asked everybody to take it all
[1:14:09] young and old to inoculate from this
[1:14:12] horrible polio
[1:14:14] and everybody thousands went in to take
[1:14:17] it. And uh how did they how did they do
[1:14:20] that? You see, you find out in taking
[1:14:23] doctor's medicine, you know, IT'LL WORK
[1:14:25] ON SOME people and then it won't work on
[1:14:27] the others because that, you know,
[1:14:31] everybody ain't made alike. Now, we have
[1:14:33] this penicellin.
[1:14:35] I carry a card in my pocket. So that if
[1:14:38] I'd ever have an accident, a doctor must
[1:14:40] never give me penicellin. It would kill
[1:14:42] me. So, it'll kill some people and help
[1:14:45] others because the serum doesn't work
[1:14:47] just right on all the people. Do you
[1:14:50] ever think the way they find a serum,
[1:14:52] the way they do it, they read books and
[1:14:55] chemists go and take certain germs and
[1:14:57] they mix them together and different
[1:14:59] poisons till they get a formula,
[1:15:02] something that won't kill the patient
[1:15:04] BUT WILL KILL THE germ and that's the
[1:15:06] way they work. Then they get all this
[1:15:08] together and then they go GET HIM A
[1:15:10] GUINEA pig and they get a long needle
[1:15:12] and s this in the guinea pig and squirt
[1:15:15] him full of it. And then if THE GUINEA
[1:15:17] PIG SURVIVES IT, then they squirt it in
[1:15:20] you and see if you survive it. Well, uh,
[1:15:23] that's all right. They've done great
[1:15:25] things, see, IN DOING THAT. BUT THAT'S
[1:15:28] THE WAY THEY FIND OUT HOW TO work on the
[1:15:30] people. Now,
[1:15:33] you find out that everybody isn't made
[1:15:36] just like a guinea pig. So, it it
[1:15:38] doesn't work on everybody. BUT I WANT TO
[1:15:41] TELL YOU ONE THING. God's inoculation
[1:15:45] works on everybody.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; It'll work on everybody.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It'll it'll help everybody that takes
[1:15:52] it.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Uh God asked the question, is there no
[1:15:57] bomb in Gilead? Or is there no physician
[1:16:01] there?
[1:16:03] Then if there is, WHY IS THE DAUGHTER OF
[1:16:06] MY PEOPLE not recovering? The sickness,
[1:16:08] the infirmity of my daughter. That would
[1:16:11] be the church, the daughter of my
[1:16:14] people, which the Orthodox church is
[1:16:17] speaking directly to us. The daughter of
[1:16:19] my people has not recovered from her
[1:16:22] sickness. Is it because we have no
[1:16:24] physician or we have no no uh he has no
[1:16:27] medicine to work with, no bomb, no
[1:16:30] physician? Now we are told by medical
[1:16:34] science today which we highly salute for
[1:16:36] these things that
[1:16:39] if uh we have these different
[1:16:41] infirmities and fail to take these
[1:16:44] inoculations, it's a dangerous thing.
[1:16:47] You might lose your life if you don't
[1:16:49] take it. We're living in a day of of sin
[1:16:51] and sickness. WE GOT MORE SICKNESS THAN
[1:16:53] WE EVER HAD, but it causes more sin and
[1:16:57] and things than we ever had. That's
[1:16:58] where sickness come from. Sickness is a
[1:17:01] result of sin. Before we had any
[1:17:04] sickness, we had no sin. And sin
[1:17:06] followed sickness. See, I mean, u
[1:17:09] sickness followed sins. Pardon me. Um
[1:17:11] had sin first and the results of of sin
[1:17:14] brought sickness.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Now, and therefore, now as sin
[1:17:18] increases, sickness increases. And we've
[1:17:22] got the best doctors we ever had. We got
[1:17:25] better drugs than we ever had.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; WE GOT MORE HOSPITALS than we ever had.
[1:17:29] We got better trained man than we ever
[1:17:31] had. AND WE GOT MORE SICKNESS THAN WE
[1:17:34] EVER HAD.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; WHY? WE GOT MORE SIN THAN WE EVER HAD.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; We got more people. And when people
[1:17:42] begin to multiply, THEN SIN AND VIOLENCE
[1:17:45] SETS IN
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; THESE BIG CITIES. Not like living out in
[1:17:48] the country, the walled in cities that
[1:17:50] we talked about last night. You take
[1:17:52] these walled in cities, you're always
[1:17:54] getting sin. And when we get these other
[1:17:56] kind of spiritual walled in cities,
[1:17:58] you're always mixing everything with it.
[1:18:00] Sin, too.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Now, we find out the doctors tell us
[1:18:04] that the number one killer is heart
[1:18:07] trouble. Well, I don't disagree with the
[1:18:09] doctor cuz I'm not a doctor. But I'll
[1:18:11] say one thing. Number one killer isn't
[1:18:13] heart trouble. NUMBER ONE KILLER is sin
[1:18:16] trouble.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Sin is number one killer,
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; not heart trouble. So many say today,
[1:18:23] you know, brother Brandham, you you say
[1:18:26] these things too hard. We have to sin a
[1:18:28] little every day. WE JUST GOT TO.
[1:18:31] SOMEONE SAYS, YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRHAM, I
[1:18:33] CONDEMNING SMOKING. And uh I do believe
[1:18:36] that man shouldn't smoke. I believe in
[1:18:38] holiness, CLEANNESS
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT SOUL, BODY, AND SPIRIT.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And he said WE I JUST GOT TO SMOKE. I I
[1:18:47] just have to smoke a little. I JUST GOT
[1:18:49] TO DO IT. And we hear so many say that I
[1:18:52] GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE SOCIABLE DRINK IN
[1:18:55] ORDER TO HOLD MY JOB. WE HEAR WOMEN SAY
[1:18:58] I JUST GOT TO CUT MY HAIR AND WEAR MY
[1:19:01] DRESSES UP TO DATE TO keep my social
[1:19:03] standing in my church.
[1:19:07] If I don't, THE WOMEN SAY I LOOK TOO
[1:19:08] OLD.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, but I'm going TO SAY
[1:19:12] SOMETHING. THAT'S PENTECOSTAL
[1:19:15] PROSTITUTION.
[1:19:20] It's right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; THE REASON THEY DO IT IS BECAUSE THEY
[1:19:24] HAVEN'T TRIED THE INOCULATION.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVEN'T TRIED GOD'S SERUM FOR SIN.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And these things.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:35] I go tell you the way back.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; They want to come back. You must get
[1:19:40] inoculated. You must take God's bomb.
[1:19:43] God's serium. He's got it. IT'S A DOUBLE
[1:19:46] CURE for sin.
[1:19:49] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S OWN
[1:19:52] SON, WITH THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:19:55] CLEANS YOU FROM SIN AND FILLS YOU FOR
[1:19:57] SERVICE.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; That's the way we have to come back
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; is through THOSE ELEMENTS THERE. YOU
[1:20:03] DON'T HAVE TO DO THOSE THINGS. You don't
[1:20:06] have to do it. And the VERY REASON YOU
[1:20:08] DO IT, some minister said to me not long
[1:20:10] ago, HE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, I TRULY
[1:20:13] BELIEVE THAT THIS BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:20:15] GHOST THAT YOU SPEAK OF IS the truth." I
[1:20:17] really believe that. He said, "My church
[1:20:19] teaches the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:20] but we believe we receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:22] when we believed when moment we believe
[1:20:24] that Abraham believed God and he was
[1:20:27] counted unto him for imputed to him for
[1:20:29] righteousness." I said, "That's true."
[1:20:30] But then God gave him the seal of
[1:20:32] circumcision as A CONFIRMATION OF HIS
[1:20:34] FAITH. I SAID, "IF YOU'VE never received
[1:20:36] the Holy Ghost yet, God's never
[1:20:37] recognized your faith."
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; We're the children of Abraham. He said,
[1:20:41] "If I did that, oh, Brother Brandham, if
[1:20:44] I did that, then I'd be put out of my
[1:20:47] church." I SAID, "WHAT?" I WAS. And he
[1:20:49] said, "Well," I said, "Well, uh, I can't
[1:20:52] do that." And I said, "Why can't you DO
[1:20:54] IT? JUST TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T DO IT."
[1:20:57] HE SAID, "WELL, WELL, I COULDN'T GET ANY
[1:20:58] OTHER MEETINGS ANYWHERE." I said,
[1:20:59] "NONSENSE. IF GOD CALLS YOU TO THE
[1:21:02] GOSPEL, HE'S GOT A PLACE FOR YOU TO
[1:21:05] PREACH. YOU GOT SOMEBODY THAT'LL LISTEN
[1:21:07] TO YOU.
[1:21:09] CERTAINLY, THERE'LL BE SOMEBODY who will
[1:21:12] listen. Stand on the street corner, SAY,
[1:21:15] "YOU THROW ME IN JAIL, THEN PREACH TO
[1:21:16] THE JAILER."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Somebody Paul did it that way. They all
[1:21:23] got saved.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You say you have to do it. No,
[1:21:27] you don't. The reason they do it is
[1:21:29] BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TESTED this
[1:21:31] inoculation. They haven't taken the
[1:21:33] toxine yet for it. There's something
[1:21:36] that'll cure that that'll cure that
[1:21:38] scare you got. There's something THAT'LL
[1:21:40] MAKE YOU DRESS AND ACT LIKE A LADY.
[1:21:41] THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE YOU LIVE
[1:21:43] like a Christian. There's something
[1:21:44] that'll that'll make you be SO FULL OF
[1:21:47] GOD TILL YOU STAND TO GIVE a testimony
[1:21:50] that'll shake the shingles. Who's on top
[1:21:51] of THE HOUSE? IF YOU'LL JUST TAKE THE
[1:21:54] INOCULATION,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT to take the toxin.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; You got the disease. SO, THERE'S ONLY
[1:22:00] ONE THING TO DO IS TAKE THE TOXIN TO GET
[1:22:02] RID OF IT. THAT'S THE WAY TO RETURN BACK
[1:22:05] TO NORMAL CHRISTIAN HEALTH. The church
[1:22:08] is sick.
[1:22:11] It's puny.
[1:22:13] It's anemia.
[1:22:15] It's got malignancy.
[1:22:17] AND THERE'S NO EARTHLY CURE FOR IT.
[1:22:20] EDUCATION WON'T DO IT.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; WE'VE TRIED IT.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; DENOMINATION WON'T DO IT. WE'VE TRIED
[1:22:27] IT.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; YOU ONLY MAKE IT WORSE. THERE'S ONLY ONE
[1:22:31] WAY BACK AND THAT'S THROUGH THE BLOOD OF
[1:22:34] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; INOCULATION.
[1:22:40] Come back to Christ. Come back to the
[1:22:42] HOLY SPIRIT. COME BACK TO LIFE ETERNAL
[1:22:45] AGAIN. That's the way we get back. The
[1:22:49] people say, "I have to do this to keep
[1:22:50] my standard with the people." You don't
[1:22:53] have to do it. It shows a shallowess. It
[1:22:56] shows a cowardliness.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And a PREACHER THAT'LL STAY IN THE
[1:23:00] PULPIT AND COMPROMISE ON the principles
[1:23:03] of CHRIST BECAUSE SOME BUNCH OF BISHOPS
[1:23:07] DOMINATE HIM AND TELL HIM YOU HAVE TO DO
[1:23:08] THIS or we punch you out of the
[1:23:09] fellowship. YOU'RE A COWARD. STAND
[1:23:12] THERE.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; TELL THE TRUTH. AMEN.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; No matter what the price is. Look at
[1:23:20] Stevens that morning. Our little Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost brother standing before the
[1:23:24] Sanhedrin council council the seventh
[1:23:26] chapter of Acts. He said, "Ye man of
[1:23:28] Israel, you that dwell in Judea and so
[1:23:31] forth, how our fathers come up out of
[1:23:33] Macaponia and so forth, begin to tell
[1:23:35] him that he got wound up, got started,
[1:23:38] the Holy Ghost come up on him." He said
[1:23:39] he shined, his face shine like an angel.
[1:23:42] HE SAID, "YOU STIFF NECKS,
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; UNCIRCUMCISED OF HEART AND EARS, YOU
[1:23:47] ALWAYS DO RESIST THE HOLY GHOST. LIKE
[1:23:49] YOUR FATHERS DID, so do you."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He knowed where he was standing. He know
[1:23:57] his position. His face not might have
[1:24:00] shined like a light up there, but an
[1:24:02] ANGEL KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; And an angel IS A MESSENGER THAT'S
[1:24:06] COMMISSIONED from God.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE DOWN. HE KNOWS
[1:24:11] EXACTLY THEM HALF A MILLION HOWLING
[1:24:14] WOLVES OF CLERGY OUT THERE CONDEMNING
[1:24:16] THAT MAN FOR THE WAY HE WAS DOING AND
[1:24:19] THE SERMONS HE WAS PREACHING. AND
[1:24:21] STEPHEN STOOD THERE AND SAID, "YOU'RE
[1:24:23] UNCIRCUMCISED OF THE HEART and ears
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and you RESIST THE HOLY GHOST LIKE YOUR
[1:24:28] fathers did.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; So are you doing the same thing?" He was
[1:24:31] telling them the way back
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; to the God that opened up the Red Sea.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Tell them to the God who rained the
[1:24:38] plagues down in Egypt. But they didn't
[1:24:40] want to take the way back. So they
[1:24:41] stoned the messenger. You don't get rid
[1:24:44] of it that way. It still hangs on. The
[1:24:46] one that witnessed become one of them
[1:24:48] pretty soon. Paul, right? Yes. They
[1:24:52] haven't tried the toxin. You know the
[1:24:54] reason they do it? They're afraid of
[1:24:56] that new birth. I mean the real new
[1:24:57] birth. Oh, everybody say, "Sure, I
[1:25:00] believe you must be born again." Yes,
[1:25:02] sir. Yes. But when it comes to the real
[1:25:04] birth, they believe the new birth by
[1:25:07] shaking hands, saying a bunch of creeds
[1:25:09] or something. They call that the new
[1:25:10] birth. That ain't the new birth.
[1:25:14] Uh they're afraid of the new birth.
[1:25:17] Listen, any birth is a mess. I don't
[1:25:20] care where it's in a pig pin or where
[1:25:21] it's at. It's a mess. Any birth and
[1:25:23] stores is a new birth.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; It'll make you do THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T
[1:25:26] think you'd ever do.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; BUT IT BRINGS LIFE.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE YOU CAN HAVE LIFE, YOU HAVE
[1:25:31] TO HAVE DEATH. PRAISE GOD.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; BEFORE A SEED CAN REPRODUCE ITSELF, IT'S
[1:25:36] GOT TO DIE.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER AND NOT ONLY DIE, BUT IT'S GOT
[1:25:39] TO ROT.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER TO GET NEW LIFE OUT OF IT, IT'S
[1:25:43] GOT TO DIE AND ROT IN ITSELF.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; AND SO DOES EVERY SINNER. Every man, NO
[1:25:49] MATTER HOW HIGH HE'S EDUCATED AND HOW
[1:25:51] MUCH HE'S POLISHED, HOW MANY uh degrees
[1:25:54] he has in a church OR SO FORTH, HOW MANY
[1:25:56] OF THESE THINGS, HOW MANY COLLEGES HE'S
[1:25:58] EDUCATED OUT OF, HE'S GOT TO DIE TO HIS
[1:26:01] OWN THEORY, HE'S GOT TO DIE TO HIMSELF.
[1:26:04] HE'S GOT TO DIE TO EVERYTHING TO BE
[1:26:06] REBORN AGAIN BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; You make him cry and boohoo and speak in
[1:26:14] tongues and jump up and down and carry
[1:26:15] on like a maniac. But he's got new life.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That's what it takes to do it. He's got
[1:26:23] to have new life. They're afraid of the
[1:26:25] new birth. The new birth is a mess. Now,
[1:26:27] they call new birth. Oh, here they Oh,
[1:26:29] sure. I believe in being born again. And
[1:26:31] they say they're born again and deny the
[1:26:33] word. Say they have the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:35] take the scriptures and plainly TEACH
[1:26:37] THE BIBLE HOW IT IS. AND THEN THEY SAY,
[1:26:39] "OH, THAT WAS for another age." And mean
[1:26:41] that the Holy Ghost that's in you will
[1:26:43] witness that is for another age. what he
[1:26:45] said is to you and to your children to
[1:26:47] them as far off even as many as the Lord
[1:26:49] our God shall call.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He can't lie.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; If there's a spirit in YOU THAT DENIES
[1:26:56] THAT to be the truth, THEN IT'S NOT THE
[1:26:58] HOLY SPIRIT BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:26:59] WROTE THE WORD.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's as solid as I know how to place
[1:27:05] it.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; It takes death to produce life. You got
[1:27:10] to die to your own thinking. YOU GOT TO
[1:27:12] DIE TO YOUR OWN THEOLOGIES. YOU GOT TO
[1:27:14] DIE TO YOUR OWN SELF, TO your own human
[1:27:17] ways. You've got to be regenerated, a
[1:27:20] new creature, a new creation. BEFORE YOU
[1:27:23] CAN BE THAT, YOU CAN'T be two at THE
[1:27:24] SAME TIME. YOU GOT TO DIE TO ONE IN
[1:27:26] ORDER TO BE BORN IN THE OTHER.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; It brings a mess. And it causes a mess,
[1:27:31] too. But you're you got new life. What
[1:27:34] difference does it make? You got to do
[1:27:36] it.
[1:27:38] You know, there was a time when we
[1:27:40] couldn't even inoculate people for
[1:27:42] typhford fever. I'm looking at a friend
[1:27:45] of mine, a nurse sitting here watching
[1:27:47] me while I'm speaking this. But that's
[1:27:49] right. And sister, now there's a time
[1:27:51] when they didn't have inoculation for
[1:27:53] taport fever. Thousands died with it.
[1:27:56] There was a time when they didn't have
[1:27:57] inoculation for polio. Thousands and
[1:28:00] thousands of little children died. But
[1:28:02] now there's no excuse. We have
[1:28:04] inoculation. That's right.
[1:28:07] All right.
[1:28:09] Now, there was a time when this toxine
[1:28:12] or bomb, which we'll call toxine of God,
[1:28:17] there it wasn't too perfect because it
[1:28:19] was called it was by the blood of goats
[1:28:22] and sheep and cattle and so forth. It
[1:28:25] didn't exactly take away sin. It just
[1:28:27] covered sin. A man had to go year by
[1:28:30] year and make his confession and so
[1:28:31] forth. There was a time when it was
[1:28:34] right. But now the worshipper once
[1:28:36] purged has no more conscience of sin.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And what is sin? Unbelief. Unbelief in
[1:28:42] what? The word.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Certainly. If you say you believe God
[1:28:46] and deny his word, well, you don't
[1:28:48] believe him. If you say, "I believe,"
[1:28:50] Brother Brandham, say, "But he's wrong.
[1:28:51] He's Well, how can you do that?" You
[1:28:54] couldn't do it. I know you WAS WRONG
[1:28:56] BECAUSE YOU didn't believe me.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; And if you SAY YOU BELIEVE GOD AND DENY
[1:28:59] HIS WORD, WELL, THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE
[1:29:01] GOD BECAUSE GOD IS HIS WORD.
[1:29:04] AMEN.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. You've got to
[1:29:05] accept the word. THAT'S THE WAY BACK
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; back by the word path and the word is
[1:29:10] God. Now, we find that and we see that
[1:29:14] one time that that inoculation wasn't
[1:29:16] too good. There was a conscience always
[1:29:18] of sin and he had to come year by year
[1:29:20] and make his offering. But now in
[1:29:22] Hebrews, it tells us that if the
[1:29:24] worshipper is once purged, he has no
[1:29:27] more conscience of sin or otherwise no
[1:29:30] more desire to sin. The whole thing's
[1:29:32] gone from him. There's no more. You
[1:29:34] don't have to sin every day. You don't
[1:29:35] have to do these things. You do IT
[1:29:37] BECAUSE YOU WILLFULLY WANT TO. And the
[1:29:39] reason you willfully want to IS BECAUSE
[1:29:41] YOU NEVER DIED TO YOURSELF.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I know that's scorching,
[1:29:45] but it's good.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; When you die to yourself, then you
[1:29:50] become a new creature.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Then those things are gone. And if you
[1:29:54] try TO ACT LIKE YOU got him before you
[1:29:56] have, it's like a I said the other day,
[1:29:58] like a blackbird trying to put peacock
[1:30:00] feathers in his wings.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Say, you see, I'm a I'm a peacock. He
[1:30:04] isn't. That's something YOU STUCK IN
[1:30:06] YOURSELF. It has to grow from the inside
[1:30:08] out.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THE HOLY SPIRIT IS. IT'S
[1:30:11] NOT SOMETHING YOU smear on or something
[1:30:12] like that. IT'S A NEW BIRTH. YOU GOT TO
[1:30:14] BE BORN AGAIN. AND THESE VIRTUES OF THE
[1:30:16] HOLY GHOST HAS TO COME FROM THE inside
[1:30:18] out.
[1:30:21] And when world and sin and cutting hair
[1:30:23] and painting comes out against the word
[1:30:25] of God, it shows the Holy Spirit's not
[1:30:26] there.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; That's a direct evidence.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So what would you call it? Pentecostal
[1:30:31] prostitution.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Committing spiritual
[1:30:35] fornication with the God of heaven. What
[1:30:38] a shame of disgrace it is. Oh, that's
[1:30:40] horrible. Yes, sir. Now we find out that
[1:30:44] when man tries to find a serum, a doctor
[1:30:47] to give to his patient to inoculate him
[1:30:49] from
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; lesson on what the Holy Ghost is,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; what the new birth is, what the baptism
[1:31:07] of the Holy Ghost is,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; what it is to fake it.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:31:18] this voice
[1:31:20] was
[1:31:22] created and designed by God for you.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; He gave you an ear to hear it.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; He gave you a heart to receive it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean it it it cuts you
[1:31:38] just the way it cuts somebody else. But
[1:31:41] could you hear when he came down he said
[1:31:43] what the this is what the evidence of it
[1:31:46] really is and and you've got to want to
[1:31:49] have it
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; but
[1:31:53] he said the problem is people are
[1:31:54] afraid.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; You know you don't have to be afraid of
[1:32:00] God taking over your life.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; He promised you'd never beg bread. He
[1:32:06] promised he'd always be there for you.
[1:32:09] He promised he wouldn't forsake you.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; He promised if you'd stand for him, he'd
[1:32:14] stand for you.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; He promised if you're ashamed of him
[1:32:18] here, he'll be ashamed of you there.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; And it it's just what it is. And that's
[1:32:25] what we've got to get back to. And so
[1:32:28] education don't do it.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't do it.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It takes God starting to work
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; from the inside. Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Out. And if if uh you want to uh go back
[1:32:44] and and
[1:32:45] uh pick this up and and and listen to it
[1:32:50] uh and and finish it up. Uh I I would
[1:32:54] recommend that.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But but you that's that voice on the
[1:33:00] inside that when he he says things, you
[1:33:04] know it's true. But that voice on the
[1:33:06] inside says, "That's where I've got to
[1:33:08] work. That's where I've got to do
[1:33:10] better. That I've got to separate myself
[1:33:13] from this. I I've got to pray more. I've
[1:33:16] got to read my Bible more. I' I've got
[1:33:18] to get more sincere. I've got to get rid
[1:33:20] of my fear. I've got to seek the face of
[1:33:23] the Lord, what he would have me to do."
[1:33:26] So, the voice is going out, and that
[1:33:28] applies to everything.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; But the inside voice is what applies to
[1:33:33] you. And that's the quickening of the
[1:33:37] spirit making that word alive. You can
[1:33:41] have the word, but the word killleth,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; but it's the spirit that brings life
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; to it. And and I I I just thought I just
[1:33:51] felt that that
[1:33:54] it just really where we want to go,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; right? We want to go back
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; to really being. We don't care about our
[1:34:01] popularity. We don't care about what
[1:34:05] anybody thinks. We just want to have
[1:34:08] that life of the Lord. And we want to
[1:34:12] apply the token to our lives. And and
[1:34:14] and if we have sin that so easily besets
[1:34:18] us, then we know that
[1:34:21] we got to confess that sin, get in the
[1:34:23] presence of the Lord, and let him purge
[1:34:26] us from it.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; There's no need condemning ourselves,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:31] You know, if you had polio,
[1:34:33] then you can't condemn yourself for
[1:34:35] polio. The only thing that condemns you
[1:34:38] if you don't take the medicine for
[1:34:39] polio.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That that's when
[1:34:44] the problem is. If you find yourself in
[1:34:47] a condition, you know, that's what he
[1:34:50] said. It's not it's not wrong to be sick
[1:34:53] sitting at the doctor's doorstep. He
[1:34:56] said that wasn't the sin. the sin was
[1:34:59] not to take the doctor's medicine,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; And and and so that's the that's the
[1:35:07] process. And the the only the only place
[1:35:11] you're going to find the desire to do
[1:35:14] that is in your heart,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Because in their heart, they didn't want
[1:35:18] it,
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:21] They want to be associated but they
[1:35:23] don't want the effect of it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; You know, so they provide another way.
[1:35:28] There's no other way,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; You know, you must be born again.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You know, you you and and and God will
[1:35:36] do that.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Don't even put an image in your mind
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; of what being born again is. Don't even
[1:35:44] look at it like a like a one-time
[1:35:47] experience or or something that you go
[1:35:50] through. No, it's a life
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; that comes into you. And as that life
[1:35:56] journeys, you'll find yourself you get
[1:35:59] the spirit of God. I'm just speaking
[1:36:00] from experience. I was a hippie. I had
[1:36:03] long hair, but you know, I got the Lord
[1:36:06] touched my life. I had drugs in my
[1:36:09] bedroom. I had drugs in my car. I had
[1:36:12] drugs to sell, you know, I had music. I
[1:36:16] had everything. It was all there. I
[1:36:18] didn't go b I wasn't born again. And
[1:36:21] then walked in and everything was gone.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I had to start purging.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I had a a a fantastic
[1:36:35] mural
[1:36:37] painted on my wall because, you know, I
[1:36:39] like Bob Dylan. I had a fantastic mural
[1:36:42] painted on my wall. Very uh
[1:36:47] great painter in the realms of that I
[1:36:50] was in. And and when I when I wanted to
[1:36:52] take it down, I was going to paint that
[1:36:54] wall. They came and they took a skill
[1:36:57] saw and cut that painting out of my
[1:37:00] wall. Took it down and and put some
[1:37:04] sheetrock back up in in the place. I had
[1:37:07] to purge.
[1:37:10] That wasn't too smart then
[1:37:12] cuz Lesie had a complete set of Beatle
[1:37:15] albums still in their original cover and
[1:37:19] I don't know what do we do? Do we throw
[1:37:20] it in the dump?
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You know, of course, don't go look on
[1:37:29] eBay for that thing right now.
[1:37:32] You know what I mean? But you don't sell
[1:37:34] stuff back to the devil. You know what I
[1:37:37] mean? So you you destroy it. You don't
[1:37:40] give it back to the devil so he can use
[1:37:42] it ON SOMEBODY ELSE. YOU DESTROY THAT
[1:37:44] THING.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And you got to purge. And the spirit is
[1:37:50] life. And how do you take the city? You
[1:37:53] take it one city at a time. You take it
[1:37:55] one battle at a time. One purging at a
[1:37:58] time. You know, I mean, and you just you
[1:38:01] deal with it.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; And every time you deal with it, it's a
[1:38:05] battle. Yes.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And every time you deal with it, it's a
[1:38:08] struggle. And every time you deal with
[1:38:10] it, you have to overcome.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's why people throw things down and
[1:38:15] then they go back and pick it up. I
[1:38:17] mean, he said it right in there.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; They don't get rid OF IT BECAUSE THEY
[1:38:22] STILL WANT IT.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; But you got to have a revelation that
[1:38:29] what he has to offer is better. Yes,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; and you don't have to have both.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He alone will do it.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have the the world.
[1:38:45] That's Lady
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Oia.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; They want to have the world. They want
[1:38:48] to have their jobs. They want to have
[1:38:50] their things. They want to mix
[1:38:52] Christianity with it. How can I still be
[1:38:55] in the world and be a Christian? There's
[1:38:58] 900 different denominations that give
[1:39:01] you a way to do that.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; 900 different ways,
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; thousands of voices,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; but this voice,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; the one voice,
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; the one that knew,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; the one that God sent
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; to bring us back.
[1:39:26] preaches it exactly
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; what it takes.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I thank God that he has a church
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; and a people
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; that's predestinated
[1:39:39] to that birth.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; It's their inheritance.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; What is an inheritance? It's something
[1:39:51] that that God leaves you.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:54] I wasn't going to bring this story up
[1:39:57] because Matthew shared it with me and I
[1:39:59] I I thought maybe he'd have it in one of
[1:40:01] his sermons one time, but then I
[1:40:04] realized that preachers always rob one
[1:40:06] another's sermons. You know what I mean?
[1:40:09] But Matthew, they did a job. He had a
[1:40:13] guy that worked for him and and when
[1:40:17] they were doing that job, he found
[1:40:20] $500,000 in the house that or the tree
[1:40:23] that they were working on.
[1:40:26] So he gave it to his boss
[1:40:30] and he told the owners of the house,
[1:40:34] "I find $5,000
[1:40:37] $500,000
[1:40:39] in your house and I gave it to the
[1:40:41] boss." Well, the boss kept it.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; So, the owners of the house
[1:40:49] sued
[1:40:51] the buyer for the 500,000.
[1:40:55] But then the family, the original
[1:40:57] family, they came and sued.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; So, you had three people
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; in the lawsuit.
[1:41:06] You had the
[1:41:08] the contractor and his claim was finders
[1:41:12] keepers,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; right? You had the owners,
[1:41:21] you know what I mean? And their claim
[1:41:24] was, well, the guy said, I I bought it
[1:41:28] as is. And their
[1:41:31] their claim was, well, it wasn't part of
[1:41:34] the sale.
[1:41:36] BUT THEN THE ORIGINAL FAMILY CAME BACK.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And they said it was it was our
[1:41:44] inheritance.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And when the court ruled on it, who do
[1:41:50] you think they gave it to?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The finder's keeper?
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; No. You think they gave it to the one
[1:41:57] that bought the house with it in it?
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; No. They gave it to its original
[1:42:02] inheritance because they said it was a
[1:42:05] mislaid inheritance.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Let me know when you preach on that. I
[1:42:10] want to hear it.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THEIR INHERITANCE ALL THE TIME
[1:42:16] THOUGH WAS MISPLACED.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what we GOT TO UNDERSTAND.
[1:42:21] SOMETIMES OUR INHERITANCE GETS
[1:42:23] MISPLACED, BUT IT'S STILL ours
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; and we're predestinated to it.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; We can have it.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; AND WE'RE MADE NOT TO BE AFRAID.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY STEPHEN, HE WASN'T AFRAID.
[1:42:40] AND FINALLY, WHEN that anointing got on
[1:42:43] him, HE SAID, "YOU STICK NECK
[1:42:45] UNCIRCUMCISED OF HEART AND EAR.
[1:42:48] YOU DO REJECT AND KILL THE PROPHETS LIKE
[1:42:50] YOU DID BEFORE.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid of it.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's imitated.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's misused.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; We can't be afraid that it's made
[1:43:08] mockery of. You can't be afraid of of of
[1:43:12] other things that go on.
[1:43:15] You've got to listen to your still small
[1:43:17] voice
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; if you want it.
[1:43:22] That's because there's a deep
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; calling for a deep
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and God's got a promise
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; that you can lay hold of.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; And God will manifest that promise in
[1:43:40] your life. And that's why Peter could
[1:43:43] stand there on the day of Pentecost and
[1:43:46] says, "Men and brethren, these are not
[1:43:48] drunk as you suppose, but this is what
[1:43:51] was promised
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; by the prophet.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; I'll pour out my spirit."
[1:44:02] And that's what we need to be the
[1:44:06] evidence of good strong Christian life.
[1:44:10] Daylight, whether you shout, it's not in
[1:44:13] the fire. It's not in the storm. It's in
[1:44:16] that still small voice that speaks to
[1:44:19] you in your heart. It's the spirit of
[1:44:21] God living in you and producing a life.
[1:44:27] It's
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; not in signs and wonders. Signs and
[1:44:29] wonders follow.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; It's a result of having the life.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; But he said if you don't have the life,
[1:44:36] all you become is a what did he say? A
[1:44:38] crow with peacock feathers.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; You're trying to be something that
[1:44:44] you're not.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you. Have you ever seen
[1:44:50] somebody try to imitate Brother Bram's
[1:44:52] ministry? It's miserable.
[1:44:55] I mean, I've seen him. Oh.
[1:45:00] There's some out someone out there right
[1:45:02] now that hurts in their back.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Got back trouble.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's somebody. Oh, I I feel it
[1:45:11] right over here. Right over here.
[1:45:13] There's someone that's having financial
[1:45:15] trouble.
[1:45:20] Oh, I feel it. There's someone over here
[1:45:23] just have some upset stomachs.
[1:45:29] AND SOMEONE'S JUST THERE. OH, THAT'S ME.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; WELL, you might as well re read Dear
[1:45:34] Abby or your horoscope. I like the one
[1:45:37] that turned us back to the audience.
[1:45:39] There's a vision right there. I see you.
[1:45:42] Not today. Not right now. I SEE YOU 25
[1:45:44] YEARS AGO.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I SEE A DOG CHASING YOU DOWN THE alley
[1:45:49] and you getting in there and that's
[1:45:50] where you PICKED UP THAT SPIRIT. THUS
[1:45:52] SAYAETH THE LORD.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:45:58] That's somebody that really had it.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And you can check them all out. Nobody
[1:46:06] ever spoke like this man spoke.
[1:46:11] Yes, sir.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; And you were called and elected
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; and chosen
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; to hear that voice
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and let that voice bring you back
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; to where you come from.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And I hope you caught that gist through
[1:46:30] that tape that there's Elijah, there's a
[1:46:33] voice, and the church wasn't taking it.
[1:46:35] They got too proud, too stucked up
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; for brother Brandham.
[1:46:44] They wanted to be more modern
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and more popular.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; I'll just be honest. There's people in
[1:46:51] today that want to leave out the ABCs
[1:46:55] in order and make the message more
[1:46:58] palatable.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hoping that more people would come and
[1:47:03] then they would hear about brother
[1:47:04] Brandham.
[1:47:07] Now, could you imagine somebody
[1:47:08] introducing me to Brother Bam and never
[1:47:10] tell me about this and never telling me
[1:47:12] about that and then me getting the book
[1:47:14] and go back and realize that you're not
[1:47:15] preaching the word of God. The very
[1:47:17] thing they're trying to bring them to is
[1:47:19] the very thing that's going to condemn
[1:47:20] them.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about somebody.
[1:47:27] You can go up to somebody that's got
[1:47:31] bobbed hair and and shorts on and
[1:47:35] everything and you tell them the truth.
[1:47:36] If that seeds in there, they're going to
[1:47:38] blush.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest experiences that I
[1:47:45] ever had in my life was in Mexico
[1:47:49] preaching in a church. And I remember a
[1:47:52] woman, she drove up into that meeting in
[1:47:56] a Mercedes Benz
[1:47:58] and I guess as the world would call it,
[1:48:01] I think they call them knockouts or
[1:48:02] something. Very beautiful Hispanic lady,
[1:48:06] you know, well made up, well jewelry and
[1:48:09] everything. And I heard the whispers,
[1:48:12] you know, she was an ill-famed woman and
[1:48:14] that's where she got her money. And they
[1:48:16] would go out and live in the world like
[1:48:18] that and then bring the money back to
[1:48:19] their families. She come in to church
[1:48:22] and we were preaching about like a
[1:48:24] passport and what you could carry and
[1:48:27] what things were you weren't allowed to
[1:48:29] bring into the country. You know how
[1:48:31] they have a list that you have to do you
[1:48:33] have any of this? And we brought that
[1:48:35] through the gospel. YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS,
[1:48:37] you can't take that, you can't take
[1:48:38] that. And I'll never forget it. She come
[1:48:41] down from that back row
[1:48:44] carrying her high heels in her hand,
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; HER HAIR DOWN, TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER
[1:48:50] FACE, taking off her jewelry AS SHE
[1:48:53] WALKED DOWN TO THE ALTAR TO COME DOWN
[1:48:55] AND GET THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; You never know who this gospel will
[1:49:04] touch.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of this message. Don't
[1:49:08] be ashamed of this voice. There's an
[1:49:10] elected people out there to hear it.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Play it for them.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Give it to THEM TO READ. TELL THEM ABOUT
[1:49:17] IT.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; It's their salvation.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, that's still small voice
[1:49:25] will rise up inside of them
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; and bear witness
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; to the truth.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; He can find you. Don't be deceived.
[1:49:34] Don't let it get away. Don't let the
[1:49:36] world
[1:49:38] take you away from this. The wages of
[1:49:42] sin is death.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; But the gift of God is eternal life
[1:49:46] through Christ Jesus who is the word.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; So the word will do it
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; every time.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Let's stay with the word of God. Let's
[1:49:57] be proud.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; And I mean with a humility proud. I
[1:50:02] don't mean arrogant, but let's be
[1:50:04] thankful. the thankful pride
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; of this message
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; and what God's done for it
[1:50:11] and and the courage
[1:50:15] of the prophet of God to stand there
[1:50:18] in the face of all things and speak this
[1:50:21] truth that we might live.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you. I hope you enjoyed the
[1:50:28] tape. I hope the service
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; and the direction today will stir your
[1:50:32] hearts
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; and that you in yourself
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; within yourself, your own still small
[1:50:38] voice will say, "I need to return back
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; to that voice
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; and to that leadership
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; and to that and that token applying in
[1:50:50] my life. I need to get my attitude
[1:50:52] right, my thinking right, my nature
[1:50:54] right, my spirit right. I need to work
[1:50:57] on myself.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Not going to condemn anybody else. I'm
[1:51:01] going to remove the beam from my own
[1:51:03] eye. I'm going to get things right in my
[1:51:06] life. I'm called to get things right.
[1:51:09] It's my inheritance to get things right.
[1:51:11] It's my It's my calling to to have this
[1:51:14] spirit and have God manifest that spirit
[1:51:18] in the nature and the lifestyle and the
[1:51:20] frame and the person that he made me to
[1:51:23] be.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:51:26] We're not clones.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; We're children.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Each one of us individual
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; shining a light where nobody else can
[1:51:37] shine it. Nobody can take your place. So
[1:51:40] let's take our responsibility to be
[1:51:43] everything that God made us to be. God
[1:51:48] bless you. Let's stand. I'll ask brother
[1:51:50] Billy come and lead us in a song. The
[1:51:52] musicians to come. Uh,
[1:51:55] I I like listening. I tell you, I
[1:51:57] listened to this tape by myself and it
[1:51:59] was so much better listening to it with
[1:52:01] you.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't because I could say he was
[1:52:09] talking about you and not me.
[1:52:13] But you know what? I felt I knew I
[1:52:15] wasn't alone.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Poor Elijah. He thought he was the only
[1:52:20] one. Yeah.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; But yet there were still those
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; that were holding out for the original,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; the real thing.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; And I I'm thankful there's been a lot of
[1:52:32] things to run after. I've been in this
[1:52:35] message a long time.
[1:52:38] You know, like you know, I come in in
[1:52:40] early 70
[1:52:43] and I've seen a lot of substitutes and
[1:52:46] the only thing that's ever stood and
[1:52:48] remained the same is what God put in the
[1:52:51] storehouse.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; You have a place to eat.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; I may leave.
[1:53:00] The church may have a different pastor.
[1:53:02] The congregation might flip. But the
[1:53:05] storehouse is eternal.
[1:53:07] It's the eternal word of God and it will
[1:53:11] always be there for you to feed on and
[1:53:14] it'll always lead and guide you. Let's
[1:53:16] pray. Our gracious heavenly father, we
[1:53:19] so enjoyed the word of God today.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Lord, and I I preached
[1:53:24] from this message this morning and just
[1:53:28] highlighted
[1:53:31] some of the things
[1:53:35] that were moved on me. And Father, we
[1:53:38] listened to it tonight and I'm sure that
[1:53:41] there was so much more there for the
[1:53:44] people to receive.
[1:53:46] There's enough food for us all.
[1:53:51] For every need, for every vitamin need,
[1:53:53] for every physical need, for every
[1:53:55] spiritual need. There's enough food
[1:53:58] there, Father, for every single person
[1:54:01] here.
[1:54:04] Father, it's a type of you taking
[1:54:07] one fish
[1:54:09] and one loaf and multiplying it
[1:54:13] until everybody was fed.
[1:54:19] Oh God, I just trust that
[1:54:24] we'll fall back in love with following
[1:54:27] you.
[1:54:30] We'll fall back in love with searching
[1:54:32] the scriptures
[1:54:35] and finding eternal life.
[1:54:38] We'll fall back in love to listening and
[1:54:41] and obeying every little thing.
[1:54:45] We'll fall back in love with the
[1:54:46] correction of the spirit
[1:54:50] moving on us.
[1:54:55] We'll fall back in love with the
[1:54:57] fellowship
[1:55:00] of you in your word.
[1:55:05] Lord, you know, I'd like to see more of
[1:55:07] our believers return on Sunday.
[1:55:12] Many places don't even come to church on
[1:55:14] Sunday evening.
[1:55:18] But Lord, I'd like to
[1:55:21] have a desire amongst our people, such a
[1:55:25] hunger for God's word that they wouldn't
[1:55:28] trade it for anything.
[1:55:32] So I just ask that you would just help
[1:55:35] us
[1:55:37] all of us in our own heart to rededicate
[1:55:42] ourselves
[1:55:45] and know what we have. Know that we have
[1:55:49] the pearl of great price. That we have
[1:55:52] the lost coin,
[1:55:54] Father. that we have the treasure in the
[1:55:57] field
[1:55:59] and that we'll sell all we have to have
[1:56:02] it. We ask that you'd grant that to us
[1:56:05] in Jesus precious and holy name we pray.
[1:56:10] Amen. What are you playing
[1:56:13] for?
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Made for more. Yeah, I like that song.
[1:56:16] Let's just sing that. I I like that
[1:56:19] verse. I wasn't made to tend a grave.
[1:56:24] The wages of sin is death. I wasn't
[1:56:26] meant to live my whole life to go six
[1:56:31] feet in the ground.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Now, if you ever at my funeral
[1:56:37] and you see that old wrinkled man there,
[1:56:40] that ain't me.
[1:56:44] You're going to look at the person I
[1:56:46] hated more than anybody else in the
[1:56:49] world.
[1:56:51] So when you walk up and look in that
[1:56:53] cliff and you look down there and you
[1:56:54] say, "Man, David McGary hated that guy."
[1:56:58] Did you know David McGary hated you?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; He hated you so much he left.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; He hated you so much he didn't want to
[1:57:11] live with you no more.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to divorce this thing.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:20] And there's only one way of divorce we
[1:57:22] know of and that's death.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; You don't hang it on a tree. It goes
[1:57:29] back to where it come.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; It goes back to the earth and then I get
[1:57:33] my original back.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's something in me calling
[1:57:38] for my original. There's something in me
[1:57:40] that wants my body. I hear my theophony
[1:57:43] calling. Oh my.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to go on, but I want to leave
[1:57:47] a testimony. behind.
[1:57:51] I want to leave a way in the sand.
[1:57:59] Many times I think maybe that's just why
[1:58:01] God brought me into life when he did.
[1:58:05] I met all the people that knew brother
[1:58:07] Brandham. I talked to them all. I spent
[1:58:10] hours walked in the woods with brother
[1:58:13] Roy Borders.
[1:58:15] Sat down with Earl Martin, talked with
[1:58:17] Dave Bis. sat down with Billy Ball, Roy
[1:58:21] Robersonson, just named him one after
[1:58:23] the other and heard him tell me about
[1:58:26] him, how he was, his nature, his spirit.
[1:58:36] Alan Mciri, I sat down and talked to
[1:58:39] with him.
[1:58:42] He told me how it was when brother
[1:58:44] Brandham was there in this meeting
[1:58:47] and how they came to him in his house
[1:58:49] and told him that they were no longer
[1:58:52] going to go with him with brother
[1:58:53] Brandham. Yeah. I don't know if he was a
[1:58:55] trustee or something in the church. He
[1:58:57] was somebody that was a powerhouse in
[1:59:00] that church.
[1:59:01] And he looked at me and he said, you
[1:59:03] know, they they wanted me to to
[1:59:08] not listen to the prophet more. said. He
[1:59:10] looked at me and he looked straight in
[1:59:12] the eye. He said, "I couldn't do it."
[1:59:20] I was over at DW
[1:59:24] W. Grant's
[1:59:26] church where brother Brand preached in
[1:59:28] Dallas. He came up to me and he said,
[1:59:31] you know, he said, and I told him, he
[1:59:35] say, I walked in, he came up to me and
[1:59:37] he he said, uh, who are you? says,
[1:59:39] "Well, but grant I'm I'm David McGary. I
[1:59:41] have a little church in Fort Worth, just
[1:59:42] a few of us, but we believe, you know,
[1:59:45] that Brother Bram's a prophet, and I
[1:59:46] wanted to come see this place." He
[1:59:49] grabbed me by the little pals.
[1:59:52] He's a little guy, littleer me, and he
[1:59:53] looked me right straight in the eye. He
[1:59:55] said, "David, you see all these crutches
[1:59:57] we have in this forer?" He said, 99 and
[2:00:01] 9/10 of them came from Brother
[2:00:03] Brandham's meetings.
[2:00:06] And he said, "Whatever you do," he said,
[2:00:08] "you do not leave, Brother Brandham." He
[2:00:11] was the only true prophet I ever knew.
[2:00:16] And his son was preaching
[2:00:19] on the pulpit.
[2:00:24] You know, he died just a few days after
[2:00:27] that.
[2:00:30] I believe it was his going out
[2:00:31] testimony.
[2:00:36] Don't leave this church. Don't leave
[2:00:39] this message. Don't leave it just the
[2:00:42] way that he said it. Stay with it just
[2:00:45] the way he said it. Listen to it. Let's
[2:00:48] keep playing it in our church. Let's not
[2:00:50] be ashamed of it. We might be
[2:00:53] oldfashioned, but let us have the
[2:00:55] oldfashioned religion that comes with
[2:00:57] it.
[2:01:01] We weren't made
[2:01:04] for anything else. We were made for this
[2:01:07] word.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; We were made for the same anointing
[2:01:12] that fell on the day of Pentecost.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Not a substitute, but the same life.
[2:01:18] Don't be afraid of it. Don't be ashamed
[2:01:21] of it. It's life and it's life eternal.
[2:01:26] Amen. I know
[2:01:30] that I was called to believe this. Help
[2:01:32] me sing it.
[2:01:35] I know who I am

[2:17:43] Oh, and a love that goes from
[2:17:48] west
[2:17:50] and runs as deep as it is wide.

[2:18:05] Lord, you know all our fears.

[2:18:19] but we long for you to hear.
[2:18:27] So listen to our hearts
[2:18:34] here as spirit sing.
[2:18:41] A song of praise that flows
[2:18:48] from those who have we need.

[2:19:04] awesome God
[2:19:07] you are.
[2:19:10] Words are not enough
[2:19:13] to tell you of our love.
[2:19:17] Listen to our hearts.
[2:19:23] Oh, and if words could fall I pray
[2:19:31] from this lips are mine.
[2:19:38] And if I had a thousand years,
[2:19:45] I will still run out on time.
[2:19:52] Oh, if you listen to my heart,
[2:20:00] Lord, every people say,
