[3:13] let's bow our heads
[3:15] Lord we just love you so much Lord we
[3:19] counted a
[3:20] privilege to be gathered together again
[3:22] this morning Lord and truly we can do
[3:24] nothing of ourselves Lord so we invite
[3:27] you
[3:28] we light your presence Lord and we know
[3:31] Lord as the word Goes Forth Lord we can

[3:39] you can change circumstances Lord

[3:48] you can move forward
[3:49] we love you Lord be with the remainder

[3:53] amen
[3:55] thank you
[3:56] hey man God bless you this morning I
[3:59] want to welcome everyone in the house of
[4:00] guide all our visitors man you can turn
[4:02] around and welcome someone who's invited
[4:04] by the microphone so I'm reading this
[4:06] morning
[4:29] you know it was uh
[4:32] reading the message why Christ speak
[4:34] this week
[4:36] and I always
[4:39] pay special attention to brother
[4:41] branham's prayers
[4:43] I love to go through the services and
[4:45] just listen to how he prayed
[4:47] and he made a statement as he was
[4:49] opening the service there and he was
[4:50] praying before he took the text
[4:53] he said Lord Thy word lays open on the
[4:57] pulpit
[4:58] and realizing that someday it'll be
[5:01] closed for the last time
[5:04] then the word will be flesh
[5:08] and then we're grateful for this time
[5:10] this morning open to us by the Holy
[5:13] Spirit
[5:14] the contents of this word that we shall
[5:16] read
[5:17] May the Holy Spirit teach us today the
[5:20] things that we ought to know
[5:22] and may we then in return listen closely
[5:25] to every word
[5:27] weigh it deeply
[5:29] and may we be able to catch what the
[5:31] holy spirit's trying to reveal to us
[5:35] for we realize if he should anoint us
[5:37] then the anointing is not in vain
[5:40] it's for a purpose
[5:43] that it might work to the good to the
[5:45] Lord
[5:46] and may our hearts and understanding be
[5:48] open Lord
[5:51] you know I was thinking about that just
[5:53] continuing to think about leadership
[5:57] we're going to go to Psalm 32 this
[5:59] morning
[6:02] this is a Psalm that brother Branham
[6:04] preached out of
[6:06] in the message God's eye
[6:11] you know specifically he was reading
[6:12] from verse 8.
[6:14] which says this I will instruct thee
[6:18] and teach thee in the way which Thou
[6:21] shalt go
[6:23] I will guide thee with mine I
[6:28] you know from this verse brother Branham
[6:30] preaches just a whole
[6:32] message
[6:34] on
[6:36] you know seeing things through God's eye
[6:40] you know certainly we're familiar with
[6:41] scriptures like Hebrews 11 1 and Isaiah
[6:45] 55 8.
[6:48] you know we're familiar with second
[6:49] Corinthians 5 7 it says we walk by faith
[6:53] and not by sight
[6:57] you know we certainly know
[6:58] intellectually that we don't rely on
[7:01] what we see
[7:03] or feel or hear around us for leadership
[7:08] but when we read that verse that says I
[7:10] will guide thee with mine I
[7:14] you know walking by faith is not walking
[7:16] blindly
[7:18] it's not blind faith
[7:21] or blind Trust
[7:24] you know there is still sight it's just
[7:27] not ours
[7:31] you know sometimes if we're not careful
[7:33] we can consider Faith almost to be
[7:35] fatalistic well he knows what's best
[7:38] or I'm just trusting him
[7:41] but you know wandering about without
[7:43] Direction
[7:45] is not faith
[7:48] there is still direction there's
[7:50] guidance there's purpose
[7:54] so that but it's not based on what we
[7:55] see
[7:56] or what we feel or how we feel
[8:01] but it's based on what he sees
[8:05] you know the real question is is do we
[8:07] know what he sees
[8:10] do we know what he says
[8:14] you know it's uh
[8:16] as a preacher once said
[8:19] you know we know that God's will is his
[8:21] word
[8:23] but I heard someone once say his will
[8:26] is exactly what you would do if you saw
[8:30] what he saw
[8:33] brother Brandon says this in God's eye
[8:35] he says in that guiding eye wasn't to be
[8:39] gone at the going of the Lord Jesus
[8:42] he was to continue forever in his church
[8:46] and when he rose on the third day and
[8:48] ascended up on high and sent the Holy
[8:50] Spirit back
[8:52] that the church tonight looks through
[8:54] that same guiding eye
[8:57] that guides his people in all truth
[9:01] and he is truth
[9:03] or said another way as many as are led
[9:06] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[9:09] of God
[9:10] 's eye
[9:14] you know it's something we have
[9:17] it's something we know
[9:21] it's not something that is hidden
[9:24] the question is
[9:26] do we have it
[9:28] do we look through that same guiding eye
[9:32] that Jesus himself looked through
[9:37] the scripture says I will guide them
[9:39] with mine I
[9:43] you know earlier in chapter 32 and verse
[9:45] 5 David says this I exalt I acknowledge
[9:48] my sin unto thee
[9:50] my unbelief
[9:52] and my iniquity which we know is
[9:55] pursuing your own will
[9:57] you know it's following some other
[9:58] leadership
[10:01] have I not hid I said I will confess my
[10:04] transgressions unto the Lord and thou
[10:06] forgavest the iniquity of my sin
[10:09] Selah
[10:10] you know this is David
[10:12] in prayer asking the Lord to forgive him
[10:15] for pursuing some other leadership
[10:18] other than God's eye
[10:21] iniquity
[10:24] this is a constant struggle for all of
[10:26] us I think you know not to be led by
[10:29] something other than God's eye
[10:33] but you know then David makes this
[10:35] statement in verse 6. for this shall
[10:39] everyone that is Godly pray unto thee
[10:42] in a time when thou mayest be found
[10:47] there's so much to unpack in that
[10:49] statement
[10:52] you want to know what Godly looks like
[10:55] it's someone who's constantly pursuing
[10:58] the leadership of God's eye
[11:02] not Blind Faith or blind trust but the
[11:06] guidance that his spirit gives
[11:10] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[11:13] they are the sons of God
[11:18] you know the last statement that David
[11:19] makes in that verse in a Time
[11:22] when thou mayest be found
[11:26] you know there's certainly all kinds of
[11:27] scripture that deals with the time that
[11:29] he may be found but
[11:32] you know Jesus once told the religious
[11:34] people of his day John 7 34 ye shall
[11:38] seek me and shall not find me
[11:42] and where I am thither ye cannot come
[11:46] and of course this stirred them all up
[11:48] and they began to wonder what is this
[11:50] what this was that he was talking about
[11:52] but he goes on to verse 38 he that
[11:55] believeth on me
[11:56] as the scripture hath said out of his
[11:59] belly
[12:00] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[12:03] and then John goes on to explain in
[12:05] verse 39 but this he spake this spake he
[12:09] of the spirit
[12:10] which they that believe on him should
[12:13] receive
[12:17] he later said in John 14 but the
[12:19] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[12:21] the father will send in my name he shall
[12:24] teach you all things
[12:29] God's eye
[12:31] God's leadership
[12:34] for this shall everyone that is Godly
[12:37] pray unto thee in a time when thou
[12:40] mayest be found not blind faith not
[12:43] wandering around without guidance
[12:46] but having his View
[12:48] his eye
[12:50] on on any matter
[12:54] I will instruct thee and teach thee in
[12:56] the way which Thou shalt go
[12:59] I will guide thee with mine I that's our
[13:02] promise
[13:04] you know I'm grateful that we can have
[13:06] God's eye this morning
[13:09] we can have his View
[13:11] on any matter
[13:14] but it's all about do we
[13:17] pray for it
[13:18] do we seek that in the time when he may
[13:21] be found
[13:23] for this shall all that are Godly pray
[13:27] I want to go ahead and read Psalm 32
[13:29] this morning it's just a fantastic
[13:30] chapter but I would also encourage you
[13:33] to listen to that tape God's eye I think
[13:35] it's a wonderful sermon let's read this
[13:38] together chapter 32 blessed is he whose
[13:42] transgression is Forgiven whose sin is
[13:45] covered blessed is the man unto whom the
[13:48] Lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[13:50] Spirit there is no guile when I kept
[13:53] silence my bones waxed old through my
[13:55] roaring all the day long for day and
[13:58] night thy hand was Heavy upon me my
[14:01] moisture is turned into the drought of
[14:03] Summer silo I acknowledged my sin unto
[14:06] thee and my iniquity have I not hid I
[14:09] said I will confess my transgressions
[14:11] unto the Lord and thou forgavest the
[14:14] iniquity of my sin Selah for this shall
[14:17] every one that is Godly pray unto thee
[14:20] in a time when thou mayest be found
[14:22] surely in the floods of Great Waters
[14:24] they shall not come nigh unto him Thou
[14:27] Art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve
[14:30] me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me
[14:33] about with songs of Deliverance see them
[14:35] I will instruct thee and teach thee in
[14:38] the way which Thou shalt go I will guide
[14:40] thee with mine I be not as the horse or
[14:43] as the mule which have no understanding
[14:46] whose mouth must be held in with bit and
[14:49] bridle lest they come near unto thee
[14:51] many Sorrows shall be to the wicked but
[14:54] he that trusteth in the Lord Mercy shall
[14:56] Compass him about be glad in the Lord
[14:59] and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for

[58:17] [Music]
[58:19] let's also turn to First Kings chapter
[58:22] 18.
[58:24] all right
[58:33] we're just going to read verse 30.
[58:42] and Elijah said unto all the people
[58:46] come near unto me
[58:50] and all the people came near unto him
[58:55] [Music]
[58:57] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[59:01] that was broken down
[59:14] and
[59:24] with the stones he built an altar
[59:27] in the name of the Lord
[59:32] okay
[59:40] and it came to pass at the time of the
[59:43] offering of the evening
[59:46] of the evening sacrifice the Elijah of
[59:50] the Prophet came near and said
[59:52] Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let
[59:58] it be known this day
[1:00:00] our God in Israel and that I am that
[1:00:05] servantages
[1:00:12] you may have receipts
[1:00:23] foreign
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:46] I'm preaching the gospel
[1:00:49] into a message Church
[1:00:54] the last time I preached might have been
[1:00:56] maybe nine ten years ago
[1:01:00] but we know that it's not us she is
[1:01:04] but it's the it's the Holy Ghost the
[1:01:06] holy word
[1:01:08] that leads
[1:01:10] and that brings the anointing over the
[1:01:13] word
[1:01:16] it's not after what we know in our
[1:01:19] knowledge
[1:01:20] but it's based upon the revelation of
[1:01:23] the word that he brought down
[1:01:28] through the prophet of this last age
[1:01:34] before I uh bring you the word this
[1:01:36] morning
[1:01:40] I would want to bring before you this
[1:01:43] morning the testimony of my life
[1:01:47] and how God
[1:01:58] based on Allah
[1:02:08] through the harmony of the law of God
[1:02:11] okay
[1:02:14] um
[1:02:16] we I grew up in a family of a
[1:02:19] Pentecostal family daughter all my life
[1:02:26] and uh around 19 and 70 but Intimates
[1:02:32] my parents
[1:02:35] came to the Pentecostal denomination at
[1:02:39] that time yeah so
[1:02:45] there was a time or season into the into
[1:02:49] the culture where there was there was
[1:02:50] communism
[1:02:52] and and religion was really was cut down
[1:02:55] it was strict
[1:02:59] and anybody that would want to give
[1:03:02] their hearts to the Lord or get baptized
[1:03:05] they would have to go in the evening
[1:03:08] time where people wouldn't see them
[1:03:12] they would have to hide from the
[1:03:15] authorities of the government
[1:03:17] and I remember that my parents
[1:03:21] they went into the wintertime
[1:03:24] when there was when there was ice and
[1:03:27] all the rivers were frozen
[1:03:29] and the brothers that were taking them
[1:03:33] to get baptized our spot gatza they
[1:03:36] actually broke the ice from the water
[1:03:39] and that's where they were baptized
[1:03:43] this was a system
[1:03:47] when I was six years old
[1:03:50] and I came and I grew through
[1:03:54] system of the Pentecostals
[1:03:57] and the first Contact that I've Came
[1:03:59] Upon this message
[1:04:02] was somewhere in a bus
[1:04:05] uh
[1:04:08] there was there wasn't uh at that time
[1:04:11] in the country there wasn't an ability
[1:04:13] to own a car because it was expensive
[1:04:15] yeah
[1:04:17] and all the transit thing that I was
[1:04:19] doing was through the Public Service
[1:04:21] public service yes
[1:04:25] and and going to my job and as I was
[1:04:29] traveling through the bus
[1:04:32] uh there's a man that came to me
[1:04:36] and he just asked me a simple question
[1:04:41] he said is there three gods or is there
[1:04:44] one God
[1:04:48] there was the first Contact Prima impact
[1:04:53] primer impact it was the first impact
[1:05:05] to be convinced of either one of those
[1:05:08] things three gods or one God
[1:05:12] from that moment on
[1:05:14] there was something that moved inside of
[1:05:17] unfortunately the Deep call in the Deep
[1:05:21] from that moment
[1:05:47] the feeling of the Liberty
[1:05:58] a Christian and how it should have been
[1:06:01] lived
[1:06:02] uh
[1:06:04] situations
[1:06:07] you know the
[1:06:09] situation
[1:06:12] yeah the the stability I would say of
[1:06:15] the of the message uh
[1:06:32] in Europe there was a second hand
[1:06:36] Revelation
[1:06:38] and it had a lot of everything
[1:06:42] honest
[1:06:45] it was a negative influence
[1:06:49] and really what the message was
[1:06:56] searching foreign
[1:07:32] it was because he carried me through all
[1:07:35] my life
[1:07:37] and uh
[1:07:42] in about 1984.
[1:07:46] I got married I'm trying to shorten it
[1:07:49] up a little bit
[1:07:54] the Lord took me through
[1:07:58] through fourth spiritual team
[1:08:02] Shinto experience into a very special uh
[1:08:06] way of taking me
[1:08:08] intro experience
[1:08:10] it was a
[1:08:12] unique relationship between God and man
[1:08:17] um
[1:08:18] in 1984 I I got married with my wife
[1:08:23] sister Deborah yeah
[1:08:25] and I was from another city and my wife
[1:08:28] was from another city she
[1:08:31] around
[1:08:33] this is a
[1:08:38] Universal Credit there was a level of
[1:08:42] Christianity
[1:08:45] uh
[1:08:47] sotia and where the wife
[1:08:54] there was
[1:08:57] there was there was a connection between
[1:09:00] the wife and the husband and how you can
[1:09:03] feel from the Lord the unity exactly
[1:09:06] like it to be your wife
[1:09:08] there was that that connection you can
[1:09:10] feel it you can just see it you can see
[1:09:13] personal attitude you can see it in
[1:09:15] their attitude
[1:09:16] you can see in the way that they were
[1:09:18] comporting my important yeah
[1:09:25] between between husband and wife exactly
[1:09:29] it's it's really what unites a husband
[1:09:32] and a wife
[1:09:35] and then in 1985.
[1:09:39] my firstborn came into the world and uh
[1:09:44] in 1987
[1:09:47] my second child came
[1:09:54] my second child that was born to the
[1:09:56] family
[1:09:58] at about five years old
[1:10:05] the Lord
[1:10:08] he he wanted to take us through a test I
[1:10:12] want to tell you something
[1:10:16] and Christianity is a process
[1:10:37] at the school
[1:10:39] and vets you learn
[1:10:42] through three weeks
[1:10:45] and then you come you have a test
[1:10:51] in the process of maturity he teaches us
[1:10:55] but then there was also a test
[1:11:18] he will always be next to you
[1:11:24] and at five years old I under I I we
[1:11:27] found out
[1:11:31] John had leukemia
[1:11:34] she is
[1:11:36] he was a very subtle child
[1:11:40] he was an aggravator
[1:11:42] energetic he wasn't really energized or
[1:11:47] she
[1:11:49] at five years old
[1:11:52] we went to him to the doctor and I will
[1:11:56] um
[1:11:57] she was a uh it was a female doctor yeah
[1:12:01] from Russia from from Russia she was
[1:12:04] from Russia
[1:12:06] and she was 70 years old at that moment
[1:12:23] he always aligns them from the wave he
[1:12:25] knew in the beginning to line them out
[1:12:28] she Dr Rochester and this doctor told us
[1:12:34] after all the results and the tests that
[1:12:37] they've done on the child
[1:12:40] uh Mr Stefan
[1:12:44] foreign to be able to prolong
[1:12:49] the life of the child
[1:12:52] I need these medications right here
[1:13:02] 80 of his cells were already cancerous
[1:13:06] at that moment
[1:13:07] and he only had 20 left of of life
[1:13:28] at that time you couldn't find such
[1:13:30] medications so we reached out beyond our
[1:13:32] borders
[1:13:34] and uh
[1:13:36] outside is
[1:13:38] this is all we can do as a human ability
[1:13:43] but in the light of the lord we
[1:13:46] understood the test but it's because
[1:13:48] it's a test of our life
[1:13:53] I went home with my wife chances and I
[1:13:58] said you know what
[1:14:01] we have a God that's not changed
[1:14:05] he is the same yes yesterday today and
[1:14:10] forever
[1:14:12] you know what
[1:14:15] um
[1:14:16] we Bow Down On Our Knees
[1:14:21] we went back all the way down the line
[1:14:24] of our life
[1:14:28] and we wanted to see where
[1:14:31] in what moment maybe
[1:14:36] we faded away from the Lord we fell in a
[1:14:41] way
[1:14:43] and we went and repented
[1:14:57] my whole family and my whole church at
[1:15:00] that moment
[1:15:01] in three months
[1:15:04] the child ended up having zero children
[1:15:09] cancerous cells
[1:15:13] three
[1:15:15] years
[1:15:16] this is God
[1:15:19] today he's 37 years old
[1:15:23] he's never received a sickness
[1:15:27] he heals forever
[1:15:32] This Is Our God
[1:15:40] in 2001
[1:15:45] the Lord
[1:15:46] um
[1:15:47] before this actually
[1:15:54] and I was I was a servant into the
[1:15:58] Pentecostal churches at that
[1:16:01] momentia through a missionary that came
[1:16:04] from Norway

[1:16:10] the ministry for about eight years
[1:16:13] um
[1:16:14] and totaches steam within all this time
[1:16:18] yeah uh which organization
[1:16:22] within all this time the organization
[1:16:25] she uh
[1:16:27] and in the things that I was involved
[1:16:32] they tried to promote me
[1:16:36] to send me to a theological School a
[1:16:40] university a University Vancouver in
[1:16:43] Vancouver
[1:17:19] for your life
[1:17:23] they were wanting to promote me to send
[1:17:25] me to a Biblical School
[1:17:40] there was only one thing that I had to
[1:17:42] do is just take a test
[1:17:45] I'm not this tool I took the test
[1:17:51] it was one point
[1:17:53] foreign
[1:18:03] that kept me away from passing
[1:18:08] who was there
[1:18:11] it was God
[1:18:13] it's a legit you understand
[1:18:17] there's a lot of things that we don't
[1:18:19] understand
[1:18:20] all we have to do is we believe
[1:18:24] that he is in control of all things for
[1:18:28] you and your life for your family
[1:18:35] nothing is done
[1:18:38] unless it is from his plan from the
[1:18:40] beginning
[1:18:48] the Lord
[1:18:51] was able to bring us here to the states
[1:18:54] uh it probably fought to look at
[1:18:57] supposed to spoon taught the detail
[1:18:58] darling it may be a lot for me to go
[1:19:01] through the details but for also the
[1:19:03] spoon but I want to tell you in all
[1:19:05] these little things
[1:19:07] the hand of the Lord it was with us
[1:19:15] it protected us
[1:19:22] I just want to say one more thing that
[1:19:25] the Lord's done for me and my family
[1:19:28] in Los Angeles
[1:19:32] after living in the Los Angeles area for
[1:19:35] about six years
[1:19:36] in Springfield Missouri the Lord moved
[1:19:39] us into Springfield Missouri
[1:19:41] uh
[1:19:45] there the Lord had another plan
[1:19:51] he takes us through his plan
[1:19:57] at that moment I had three weddings in
[1:20:01] one year
[1:20:02] the museum
[1:20:05] the Lord wanted us to grab all that
[1:20:09] needed to be grabbed
[1:20:11] to come into our family
[1:20:15] before he can bring us into Texas
[1:20:18] to the message to the message

[1:20:34] the Lord and your life takes you he he
[1:20:38] leads you
[1:20:39] mean
[1:20:41] and the ways that your human
[1:20:44] understanding cannot understand
[1:20:49] we have to be stabilized
[1:20:52] in the word of God and in his truth
[1:20:56] because Isaiah says
[1:21:02] my thoughts before that I know of you
[1:21:06] I'm going to departure I have thoughts
[1:21:08] of Peace
[1:21:10] of joy

[1:25:52] we have to go back to God
[1:25:56] we have to go back see
[1:26:00] all the things go to the Lord

[1:28:06] while the resorts were coming
[1:28:11] and this time we actually we were there
[1:28:13] longer than normal

[1:29:06] that's just a complex but here's
[1:29:08] complete
[1:29:10] it's healed
[1:29:14] this is God
[1:29:20] works when he wants how he wants to do
[1:29:24] and through whom whoever he wants to
[1:29:26] church is the judge if legend for us one
[1:29:30] of those things that we have to
[1:29:31] understand Brothers
[1:29:33] we don't have to base our our our
[1:29:37] understanding upon what we know
[1:29:40] that we have to do is to believe
[1:29:45] he is right here listening to your
[1:29:48] prayers
[1:29:54] agreeing with what they're asking God
[1:29:58] will give it to him
[1:29:59] it's true
[1:30:03] if God is here
[1:30:06] everything is possible that's right did
[1:30:10] you believe that
[1:30:11] praise God Amen
[1:30:14] let him move move in our midst open your
[1:30:17] hearts
[1:30:19] let any any fault anything just be here
[1:30:23] we don't join the church
[1:30:26] We Belong amen we are sitting together
[1:30:30] like a family
[1:30:31] we have to support each other we have to
[1:30:34] care for each other
[1:30:38] that's the line of God
[1:30:46] Dr raspuss and a doctor said
[1:30:51] we don't understand
[1:30:54] Mr doctor uh
[1:30:58] maybe the science we'll never understand
[1:31:02] these things
[1:31:03] but we
[1:31:06] intelligence we understand because
[1:31:09] we have a dog that created the bone
[1:31:16] and through him all things are possible
[1:31:26] this is what the Lord has placed upon my
[1:31:29] heart
[1:31:31] church
[1:31:33] one thing
[1:31:35] one thing that I want to maybe bring to
[1:31:38] the surface
[1:31:39] yes
[1:31:40] that is that always
[1:31:44] God from the beginning
[1:31:47] he placed his word Kashi oleje as a law
[1:31:53] and all his creation yeah
[1:32:18] and into the habitat of him where he
[1:32:22] created for him to live in
[1:32:34] it was a law
[1:32:38] and the water didn't pass the borders
[1:32:42] from where he put them
[1:32:45] is it true
[1:32:49] when he separated the drive from the
[1:32:53] waters
[1:32:55] the waters couldn't pass through
[1:32:58] because we all understand the word the
[1:33:01] word says
[1:33:04] on top of the waters and God was the
[1:33:08] Supra was hovering upon the waters
[1:33:15] when he told that every seed
[1:33:18] s
[1:33:20] to be able to bring after its own kind
[1:33:24] is
[1:33:26] behind the words
[1:33:32] that was made that everything that was
[1:33:35] dead to come to life
[1:33:40] That's the Law of God
[1:33:51] of its kind
[1:33:57] when he said his word is it's a law
[1:34:04] Natura the nature
[1:34:06] that was created of God a spotless
[1:34:10] behind the the law of God yes the
[1:34:13] obligator it's obligated
[1:34:17] to be able to come to life
[1:34:23] the the fish of the sea
[1:34:27] they have the law of God
[1:34:30] that was created
[1:34:36] in the way and in the creation of how
[1:34:40] God created them to be
[1:34:44] habitat their habitat was to live in
[1:34:47] water
[1:34:49] if you take them out
[1:34:53] you understand
[1:34:56] yes
[1:34:58] I'm gonna go up and get a little air
[1:35:02] and then I could go all the way down to
[1:35:04] the bottom no
[1:35:07] the nature was created to live in that
[1:35:11] habitat
[1:35:18] the uh the birds and all the the fowls
[1:35:22] of the air
[1:35:24] was created after the law
[1:35:29] created them
[1:35:32] for them to live in
[1:35:36] response
[1:35:38] never do you ever can hear them say I
[1:35:42] will try to fly
[1:35:44] no no
[1:35:46] their nature
[1:35:50] they just spread their wings
[1:35:53] free
[1:35:58] free
[1:36:02] because the law was put there in them
[1:36:07] what was what was for what word they
[1:36:10] created for
[1:36:12] eign
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:16] were created
[1:36:27] he made it that all the creation of the
[1:36:31] nature and the world to depend on the
[1:36:33] sun that's true
[1:36:42] when the sun aligns with the world
[1:36:50] shines upon the face of the Earth
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:37:08] no matter of what the condition is
[1:37:12] that's true
[1:37:18] shines upon the Earth
[1:37:22] time
[1:37:44] it comes out to life
[1:37:47] amen
[1:37:51] Luna yeah is the reflection of the sun
[1:37:57] and it transmits
[1:38:00] it transmits the nature of the Sun
[1:38:07] when the sun shines Luna the moon
[1:38:11] represents the the reflection of the sun
[1:38:15] the sun reflects and the moon shines
[1:38:24] the church yes
[1:38:27] it's the reflection of Christ
[1:38:31] which is which is the which is the Sun
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:40] which shows the lights and the nature of
[1:38:43] Christ
[1:38:46] y behind the church
[1:38:51] says the authority of the word of God
[1:38:57] through the Holy Spirit
[1:39:01] which was given to the church
[1:39:04] they are Pune to put an application an
[1:39:09] application
[1:39:11] the law of God
[1:39:16] what I want to bring to the surface
[1:39:19] is
[1:39:20] that always
[1:39:25] nature lines up with the law of God
[1:39:38] of God
[1:39:40] that's true
[1:39:45] God drew a line
[1:39:53] God saved the natural seed
[1:39:57] because we know that Sarah represented
[1:40:01] represents the church
[1:40:06] that all of them had to come out of
[1:40:18] of Christ
[1:40:25] how much more the god that saved the
[1:40:29] natural seed
[1:40:31] s
[1:40:34] the Royal seed
[1:40:40] s
[1:40:42] through the death and resurrection of
[1:40:44] Jesus Christ
[1:40:47] he brought the restoration of the church
[1:40:51] to the stature to the original stature
[1:40:56] and he changed the nature the sinful
[1:40:59] nature
[1:41:00] and without life
[1:41:04] to a new life
[1:41:07] the law and grace of God
[1:41:14] let's turn to Galatians
[1:41:25] chapter 2
[1:41:29] verses
[1:41:42] amen
[1:41:46] Galatians to 20.
[1:41:53] I was crew I am crucified with Christ
[1:42:00] nevertheless I live
[1:42:03] yet
[1:42:06] but Christ liveth in me
[1:42:09] and the life which I now live through in
[1:42:13] the flesh
[1:42:14] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:42:19] who loved me
[1:42:21] and he gave himself for me
[1:42:38] in Christ Jesus
[1:42:44] Ephesians chapter 2
[1:42:51] .
[1:42:55] from from verses 1 through 10.
[1:43:04] and
[1:43:05] and you had he quickened who were dead
[1:43:08] and trespasses and sins
[1:43:11] where in time passed he walked according
[1:43:14] to the course of the world of this world
[1:43:17] according to the prince of the power of
[1:43:19] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:43:23] the children of disobedience
[1:43:26] among whom also we all had our
[1:43:29] conversation in time past in the lust of
[1:43:32] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:43:35] flesh ended mind
[1:43:37] and were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:43:40] even as others but God who is rich in
[1:43:43] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[1:43:47] had loved us even when we were dead in
[1:43:51] sins and quickened and had quickened us
[1:43:55] together with Christ by Grace ye are
[1:43:58] saved and had risen us up together and
[1:44:03] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:44:05] in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come
[1:44:08] he might show the exiting Riches of his
[1:44:11] grace in his kindness towards us through
[1:44:14] Christ Jesus for by Grace we are saved
[1:44:18] through faith and that not of yourself
[1:44:22] it is the gift of God not of The Works
[1:44:27] lest any Mass shall boast for we are his
[1:44:30] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:44:34] good works which God had before ordained
[1:44:38] that we should walk in them
[1:44:41] that's true
[1:44:42] amen
[1:44:44] yes
[1:44:46] it's a no creature in Christ Jesus a new
[1:44:50] creation
[1:44:52] we don't think the same
[1:44:56] noise we don't we can't talk the way we
[1:44:58] want to
[1:45:00] we don't live the way we want to
[1:45:04] we don't dress the way we want to
[1:45:12] um
[1:45:13] we have to align
[1:45:17] of God
[1:45:22] the word of God is the law
[1:45:28] um
[1:45:28] which brings the enforcement
[1:45:32] and the authorities
[1:45:34] that stays behind the church
[1:45:39] and all that you ask in my name
[1:45:42] I will give it today
[1:45:47] are to agree
[1:45:50] if the church is
[1:45:53] together comes together
[1:46:00] the church is united in one mind and one
[1:46:04] of course
[1:46:06] one
[1:46:09] desires with the same love not made of
[1:46:14] man
[1:46:16] he's here
[1:46:18] he will grant it he will grant it
[1:46:24] I rather the play I'm a portion I have a
[1:46:29] portion of a tape if it's okay okay
[1:46:33] for 10 minutes for 10 minutes
[1:46:40] this message
[1:46:44] this message puts you in function
[1:46:48] just open your mind open your heart let
[1:46:52] him talk to you yes directly okay
[1:46:55] so it's uh the plate from 88 to 110.
[1:47:02] foreign
[1:47:22] for God has a law
[1:47:25] and his worries alone
[1:47:27] and God in this word made certain claims
[1:47:31] to the church
[1:47:34] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:47:37] claims Hallelujah upon Satan say give it
[1:47:41] back Eva
[1:47:43] and he has to do it amen because we can
[1:47:47] take God's agent the Holy Spirit
[1:47:51] go right down on our knees
[1:47:55] and say it's thus saith the law
[1:48:01] he's got to give it up that's all
[1:48:04] because the holy spirit said to make him
[1:48:06] do it
[1:48:07] heaven
[1:48:09] the law of the land is to enforce it's
[1:48:12] by the land for the land but the law of
[1:48:16] the spirit of God
[1:48:18] as the force Satan to give up that which
[1:48:23] he is unrightfully deceitfully taken
[1:48:26] from God Amen
[1:48:30] Souls of man he took from God
[1:48:33] Souls of women children
[1:48:35] sickness of the body he placed upon
[1:48:38] people where God made him in his image
[1:48:40] Amen to be like him
[1:48:43] and the church is given the rightful
[1:48:46] legal rights
[1:48:48] Emma by the Bible
[1:48:51] to take the holy spirit amen and enforce
[1:48:55] this upon him
[1:48:58] I believe I just quoted the last meeting
[1:49:00] here I'm not sure
[1:49:02] but a brother came to Louisville from
[1:49:04] down in Georgia and left his car sitting
[1:49:08] over there and someone stole it
[1:49:10] and he had his clothes his wife's
[1:49:12] clothes his shoulders closed his brother
[1:49:13] Evan sure uh they're usually here they
[1:49:16] drive 1500 miles every day he wouldn't
[1:49:18] have service here coming in here to have
[1:49:20] service and the poor fellow is here
[1:49:22] without anything again 700 and something
[1:49:25] miles from home
[1:49:27] I didn't know what to do he turned it
[1:49:29] into the police but they had a big
[1:49:30] racket Louisville they were stealing
[1:49:31] cars and painting them and you don't
[1:49:34] have to have a title there to sell it
[1:49:36] and they'd make you a title in a few
[1:49:37] minutes say any number you want to put
[1:49:38] on it and so they were having a terrible
[1:49:41] time so we got down on our knees
[1:49:46] Cena Jesus wouldn't have had to do that
[1:49:48] for he was the word
[1:49:51] now we are not the word the word of the
[1:49:54] Lord came to the prophets they wasn't
[1:49:57] the word but the word come to them
[1:49:59] but Jesus was a word
[1:50:02] he didn't have to pray he was God
[1:50:05] himself
[1:50:06] but we are are His prophets his shirts
[1:50:11] who the word of the Lord comes to
[1:50:13] him then the prophet is Vindicated by
[1:50:16] whether it's the word of the Lord or not
[1:50:17] but what he says comes to pass so then
[1:50:20] we had a scripture here that Jesus said
[1:50:23] wherever two or more are gathered in my
[1:50:26] name
[1:50:28] and if they will agree I'll be in their
[1:50:32] midst and if they will agree on touching
[1:50:35] any one certain thing and asked it don't
[1:50:38] doubt it they shall have what they've
[1:50:40] asked it'll be given to them now there's
[1:50:43] there's the law
[1:50:44] yeah now the one it's here to enforce
[1:50:47] that law is the holy spirit amen how
[1:50:51] about people who don't believe in the
[1:50:52] Holy Spirit
[1:50:54] would reject people see you're rejecting
[1:50:57] your own peace and mercy now
[1:51:01] we got on our knees about five name a
[1:51:04] brother Fred zoffman and many of the
[1:51:06] others is there four or five man and we
[1:51:09] knelt down and I pleaded this case
[1:51:11] before God
[1:51:13] and then I took the word of the promise
[1:51:16] and sent it forth
[1:51:19] the great Holy Spirit as he took the
[1:51:22] word discern the summons oh
[1:51:26] and broke and I saw a man going towards
[1:51:29] Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow
[1:51:31] shirt on driving this truck
[1:51:34] the Holy Spirit come upon him
[1:51:37] condemning
[1:51:38] and he turned around about halfway I saw
[1:51:42] him come back and park that car on a
[1:51:44] certain street over across the river
[1:51:47] here
[1:51:49] I raised up and told the brother thus
[1:51:53] saith the Lord
[1:51:55] and when they started out they went on
[1:51:59] the road and there was a car sitting
[1:52:01] there half empty with gasoline where the
[1:52:03] tank had 50 word had been filled up just
[1:52:05] enough taking halfway to Bowling Green
[1:52:07] and bring him back now those men are
[1:52:09] sitting right here this morning is a
[1:52:11] witness what is it
[1:52:12] enforcing
[1:52:26] and if Satan has robbed you of the
[1:52:29] privilege of being a son or a daughter
[1:52:31] of God we have a right this morning by
[1:52:34] the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of

[1:57:25] try
[1:57:26] just let it go
[1:57:28] and let God Amen do everything for us
[1:57:35] the the church has to line with the law
[1:57:40] of God the nature his nature
[1:57:45] and I want to take the scripture here in
[1:57:48] the second Peter chapter one
[1:57:55] it's the characteristics of the life of
[1:57:58] God
[1:58:03] I don't know
[1:58:08] second Peter chapter two chapter one
[1:58:12] verses three to nine
[1:58:18] okay
[1:58:21] according at his divine power had given
[1:58:24] unto all the things that pertain unto
[1:58:26] life and godliness
[1:58:29] through the knowledge of him that had
[1:58:31] called us to glory and virtue
[1:58:34] hereby are given unto us exceeding great
[1:58:38] and precious promises that by these ye
[1:58:42] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:58:45] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:58:48] the world through lust and besides this
[1:58:51] given all diligence added to your virtue
[1:58:55] add to your faith virtue
[1:58:58] and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:59:01] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[1:59:04] and to patience godliness and to
[1:59:08] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:59:11] brotherly kindness charity for if all
[1:59:15] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:59:19] they make you that ye shall neither be
[1:59:23] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:59:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:30] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:59:33] blind and cannot see a far off
[1:59:38] and had forgotten that he was purged
[1:59:42] from his old sins
[1:59:52] let's also turn to um
[1:59:54] First Peter chapter five
[1:59:59] what I want to bring into the surface is
[2:00:02] that God exactly
[2:00:08] the nature here in in the world that
[2:00:11] he's created has a
[2:00:13] lawyer the the church has a law
[2:00:18] with what we have to align ourselves
[2:00:22] into the Harmony
[2:00:27] and confirm the authority of the church
[2:00:37] if the law that he's created can't work
[2:00:40] for the nature
[2:00:42] it doesn't work in its Harmony
[2:00:46] straight to unite and work together
[2:00:49] it'd be it'd be a mess
[2:00:52] IAH that's why even in the church
[2:00:57] we have to align with the word of God
[2:01:03] that creates the law and it's the law
[2:01:07] that brings the authority
[2:01:10] that the Holy Ghost applies
[2:01:14] of God upon your life
[2:01:18] you understand
[2:01:23] um
[2:01:26] what I want to show you is
[2:01:31] in which we have to align ourselves to
[2:01:36] putense
[2:01:38] so we can apply the love of God so when
[2:01:42] we when we cry out
[2:01:44] Lord here I am
[2:01:47] what would you like me to do for you
[2:01:57] education
[2:01:59] the Elder which are among you I exhort
[2:02:03] who I am also an elder and a witness of
[2:02:07] the sufferings of Christ
[2:02:10] and also a partaker of the glory that
[2:02:12] shall be revealed
[2:02:15] feed the flock of God which is among you
[2:02:18] taking the oversight thereof
[2:02:21] not by constraint but willingly not for
[2:02:26] filthy looker but of but of a ready mind
[2:02:30] neither as being Lords over God's
[2:02:33] Heritage but being examples to the flock
[2:02:37] and when the chief Shepherd shall appear
[2:02:40] he shall receive a Crown of Glory that
[2:02:43] fadeth not the way
[2:02:45] likewise ye younger submit yourself unto
[2:02:49] the Elder yea all of you be subject one
[2:02:53] to another and be clothed with humility
[2:02:56] for God resisted the proud and give it
[2:03:00] grace to the humble humble yourselves
[2:03:04] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[2:03:06] that he may exalt you in due time
[2:03:10] casting all your care upon him for he
[2:03:14] careth for you amen
[2:03:18] there's the line
[2:03:20] there's a line
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:24] from an old nature a sinful nature into
[2:03:27] a Heavenly Godly nature
[2:03:32] let's also turn back to Ephesians
[2:03:37] chapter four
[2:03:42] I I'm hoping that I'm not being too long
[2:03:47] are you okay
[2:03:54] from 11 to 13 through 13.
[2:04:00] Ephesians chapter 4.
[2:04:04] and he gave some Apostles and some
[2:04:07] prophets and some evangelists and some
[2:04:10] pastors and some teachers
[2:04:13] for the prefer for the perfecting of the
[2:04:16] Saints for the work of the ministry
[2:04:19] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[2:04:23] till we all come in a in the unity of
[2:04:26] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[2:04:30] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[2:04:34] measure of the stature of the fullness
[2:04:37] of Christ
[2:04:42] the Lord placed
[2:04:45] a a linear or linear a line and biserica
[2:04:50] in a in a church and kind of thoughts
[2:04:53] within everyone
[2:04:56] we have to align conforming to the word
[2:05:01] if the law can be applied
[2:05:05] it doesn't have authority
[2:05:21] he says Lord I've done all these things
[2:05:23] according to Thy Word
[2:05:31] so the Holy Ghost can assist the
[2:05:36] application of the Lord within the
[2:05:39] alignment of the church and his word
[2:05:41] that's true
[2:05:43] amen
[2:05:54] I also believe that the The Fellowship
[2:05:57] of brothers and sisters and the uh uh uh
[2:06:03] as a church former we are forming the
[2:06:07] body of Jesus Christ correct
[2:06:10] okay
[2:06:15] all the understanding that
[2:06:20] is that the church
[2:06:23] it's not something that we consume
[2:06:28] we only come two hours in the morning
[2:06:30] two hours two hours in the evening
[2:06:34] maybe on Wednesday another two hours
[2:06:37] and then the rest
[2:06:41] oh that's that George
[2:06:44] does that church
[2:06:48] David says like this
[2:06:52] look how good and and how how pleasure
[2:06:56] it is
[2:06:57] that the that the brothers
[2:07:02] fellowship or live together
[2:07:08] if a portion or a body part is is
[2:07:11] hurting
[2:07:13] the whole body suffers that's truth
[2:07:19] if your brother is suffering
[2:07:22] and
[2:07:23] for us we don't care
[2:07:26] are we part of the body
[2:07:33] I want you to think upon these things I
[2:07:37] want you to just open your hearts and
[2:07:40] the desire to search for God Luther join
[2:07:43] the truth it's not to join them
[2:07:49] to be able to partake and be part of a
[2:07:52] church
[2:08:05] to be able to to feel with the one
[2:08:08] that's crying
[2:08:12] or maybe to be able to to to to
[2:08:16] be sorry to to be able to feel for the
[2:08:20] one that doesn't even have salvation
[2:08:24] yeah it's a legit you understand this is
[2:08:28] this is the mind or or the thoughts in
[2:08:31] the in the Church of God
[2:08:33] uh
[2:08:37] a lot of the times you know this this
[2:08:40] world
[2:08:45] the more we get involved into what this
[2:08:48] world is offering us
[2:08:52] with so much more we actually get away
[2:08:55] from the word
[2:08:58] a lot of times there's uh there's
[2:09:01] there's coming in our life uh
[2:09:03] um selfishness selfishness
[2:09:06] you know uh you know I have my own
[2:09:10] problems uh
[2:09:13] um
[2:09:14] let everybody else think upon their own
[2:09:16] things no
[2:09:18] no
[2:09:19] we us we are family
[2:09:26] we have to be able to carry the burdens
[2:09:29] for one another
[2:09:39] when the church aligns
[2:09:54] to be able to function and even here in
[2:09:56] the church
[2:10:00] I believe that the deacons have their
[2:10:03] place
[2:10:06] to be able to watch over the church
[2:10:10] to be able to discern the church
[2:10:20] to the church
[2:10:23] um the
[2:10:24] um the causes of all the the the
[2:10:28] the requests or maybe burdens inside of
[2:10:31] the church
[2:10:33] being able to to carry each other's
[2:10:36] burdenska
[2:10:39] um brotherly kindness and fellowship
[2:10:41] to be able to pray for one another and
[2:10:44] created to be able to trust one another
[2:10:49] important
[2:10:50] and to be able to
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:53] hold each other's burdens
[2:10:58] foreign
[2:11:34] deviated a little bit from the word
[2:11:39] and the the altar that the offerings
[2:11:43] were coming on
[2:11:45] foreign
[2:12:11] two opinions how how long do you want to
[2:12:14] do that
[2:12:19] how much how many how much more do you
[2:12:22] want to hold between two opinions and
[2:12:24] serve other gods
[2:12:26] asked us he says today
[2:12:30] which God is real
[2:12:33] and what I want to bring to the surface
[2:12:37] a lot of times
[2:12:41] our personal family Alters
[2:12:45] a lot of the times they're torn down
[2:13:01] to
[2:13:05] be able to bring a evening sacrifice
[2:13:09] in the presence of God
[2:13:13] is it true
[2:13:16] it's the fourth important it's very
[2:13:19] important brothers and sisters
[2:13:37] uniting or maybe the restoration of the
[2:13:40] husband and the wife
[2:13:46] it's repairing the relationship between
[2:13:50] fathers and children
[2:13:52] you see reparations
[2:13:58] and builds the the restoration between a
[2:14:01] pastor and a church
[2:14:09] based upon the Altar and the lean the
[2:14:13] the line of the word of God
[2:14:29] if the musicians can come
[2:14:43] another relationship
[2:14:48] this this altar that needs to be
[2:14:51] um rebuilt
[2:14:54] it's between the church and Christ
[2:15:28] how we arrive
[2:15:31] down
[2:15:49] in that relationship
[2:15:54] re-established reconstructed to be able
[2:15:56] to get into the line of the world
[2:15:57] because we want the church here to grow
[2:16:01] we wanted to be alive
[2:16:05] to be able to be present here truly
[2:16:23] amen
[2:16:30] I'm trying to find the proper way to
[2:16:33] express something
[2:16:35] meaning
[2:16:37] God put something inside of me
[2:16:42] three names
[2:16:43] uh
[2:16:47] is
[2:16:49] he he put um Brother David he put him on
[2:16:53] his heart like
[2:16:56] um like uh like a like a burden yes it
[2:16:59] was a burden upon his heart David
