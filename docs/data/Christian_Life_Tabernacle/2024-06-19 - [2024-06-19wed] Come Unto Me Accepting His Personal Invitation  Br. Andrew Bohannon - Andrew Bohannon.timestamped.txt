[45:52] wonderful to see brother manasse and his
[45:54] bride to be Lord richly bless you you
[45:56] know it's one of those things that when
[45:58] you see the natural taking place you
[46:01] know something that you're always
[46:02] excited for in that day when it comes
[46:05] and then you finally realize this is
[46:08] what God intended and you know that's
[46:10] what it's like for us as Believers you
[46:12] know God wants to have a union with each
[46:14] one of us amen so we're so grateful for
[46:17] that and trust that you know whenever a
[46:21] person accepts the responsibility of

[46:49] wonderful well if you have your Bibles
[46:51] and while you're standing we won't be
[46:54] long by the help of the Lord but I just
[46:56] had the this little thought that as
[46:58] Brother David was ministering he said
[47:00] something in his last service about
[47:01] coming to the table and coming to his
[47:04] feet is just something that's been on my
[47:06] heart and you know if I could just point
[47:08] to something that the Lord said and it
[47:10] encourage your heart then I say that it
[47:12] was a good time in the Lord amen you
[47:15] know it says this in Matthew chap 11
[47:18] we're going to read in 25
[47:21] to3 and we'll also go to Philippians
[47:23] chapter
[47:24] 2 but Matthew chapter
[47:34] 11 says this in verse
[47:38] 25 says at that time Jesus answered and
[47:43] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[47:46] Heaven and Earth because thou has hid
[47:49] these things from the wise and The
[47:51] Prudent and has revealed them unto babes
[47:55] even so father
[47:57] for it so it seemed good in thy sight
[48:02] all things are delivered unto me of my
[48:04] father and no man knoweth the son but
[48:08] the father neither knoweth any man the
[48:12] father save the son and he to whomsoever
[48:17] the son will reveal him come unto me all
[48:21] ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
[48:24] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[48:27] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[48:31] in heart and shall ye shall find rest
[48:34] for your souls for my yoke is easy and
[48:38] my burden is light amen and another
[48:41] scripture there found in Philippians
[48:43] chapter 2 a very familiar verse of
[48:49] reading it says this in Chapter 2 and
[48:52] verse 5
[48:56] we might just uh get our fingers uh
[49:00] ready for a few page turning
[49:03] but says this let this mind be in you
[49:08] which was also in Christ Jesus amen you
[49:11] may have your seats we trust the Lord
[49:13] will add a blessing to the reading of
[49:14] his word I also wanted to flip over to
[49:18] Isaiah chapter
[49:22] 1 Isaiah chapter
[49:25] 1 and we'll look at um verse 16 but
[49:30] maybe I'll just jump right into this
[49:32] quote that been B bubbling on my heart
[49:34] since Brother David preached out of it
[49:37] it must have been a month or two ago but
[49:38] in
[49:39] identifications and you could just hold
[49:41] your finger on that Isaiah scripture but
[49:43] it says this in
[49:46] identification in um he says now you
[49:50] study that character a little bit and
[49:52] then you look at
[49:54] yourself and and I look at myself but
[49:58] that's what he
[49:59] was that's who he was that's why he was
[50:04] to save
[50:06] you he took he become you that you might
[50:10] become him he took your load of sin
[50:14] therefore when we come to meet him we
[50:16] will not have to we will not have to
[50:19] stand we could not stand in his presence
[50:23] there's no way for us to do it but when
[50:26] we stand in him see he's already
[50:29] recognized the
[50:31] sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom
[50:34] I'm well pleased he recognized it there
[50:38] was no blemish on him and yet he
[50:41] suffered Temptation like any man yet he
[50:44] was scorned he was made fun of he was
[50:46] persecuted from the hour he was born
[50:49] until he died and yet he returned good
[50:52] for
[50:53] evil you cannot know way ever produce a
[50:57] character like that only accept that
[51:00] character in you a church cannot do it a
[51:04] Creed cannot do that a denomination
[51:06] can't do that education can't do that it
[51:10] must be a birth it's got to be a dying
[51:14] out letting God in by the grace of
[51:17] Christ mold this type of character in
[51:20] you that you become him and your life
[51:24] and his is the same then you are Sons
[51:26] and Daughters of God oh what a rest for
[51:30] the people of God think about it he gave
[51:33] his life so that we can have it
[51:36] [Music]
[51:42] amen now this is a little bit more of
[51:45] what I wanted to share out of this same
[51:47] message he says how can God and this is
[51:50] in paragraph 111 how can God come into a
[51:53] place like that when they deny the word
[51:56] when watches over his word to vindicate
[51:59] it to make it come to pass oh I thank
[52:02] God that God is here to make his word
[52:04] come to pass think about it and this
[52:07] word pushes out how can is pushed out
[52:11] how can he identify himself something
[52:14] like that we've got to take the entire
[52:18] Full
[52:19] Gospel amen we must and now being that
[52:23] we have identified ourselves as Full
[52:25] Gospel people people let us mold our
[52:28] character now we're invited to mold to
[52:32] be molded in His image that we might
[52:35] reflect his
[52:37] presence my what an
[52:40] invitation think about that you know
[52:43] sometimes if someone invites you over
[52:46] for dinner or something you know they
[52:48] have something that they want to give
[52:49] you they have something that they wanted
[52:51] to have some fellowship with you over
[52:53] think about it and this is an invitation
[52:56] that God Almighty is placing before his
[52:58] people before the whole world he says
[53:01] now we're invited to be molded into his
[53:03] image that we might reflect his presence
[53:07] and the works that I do shall you do
[53:09] also and the life that I live so shall
[53:13] you we're invited by God to take him as
[53:17] an example and let our character be
[53:20] molded like
[53:22] his what a thing my then when we let his
[53:27] character be in us then we have become
[53:30] Sons by having the mind of Christ the
[53:34] Mind mind which is his character your
[53:38] mind makes your character let the Mind
[53:42] Paul said of
[53:43] Christ this mind that was in Christ be
[53:46] in you let that mind be in you it molds
[53:51] the character of a Son of
[53:55] God just listen a minute how can we have
[53:59] the mind of Christ that was in him and
[54:01] deny the things that he commissioned us
[54:03] to
[54:04] do how can we place miracles in the past
[54:08] when the very Christ himself was God and
[54:11] God in him in the presence of God
[54:14] there's always
[54:17] miracles he said you call me Lord why
[54:21] call me Lord and do not the things that
[54:23] I have commanded you I laid down for you
[54:27] to do don't you see where we've gotten
[54:31] to where the church is drifting I find
[54:34] it a lot a whole lot among the
[54:36] Pentecostals too we're drifting from
[54:38] that Lifeline we must get back to that
[54:41] friend come back because we're getting
[54:44] big now you see the businessmen's
[54:47] publication is the greatest one as much
[54:50] maybe is what Oral Roberts has got and I
[54:54] find out that when when we get to
[54:57] getting big then we go to acting big see
[55:01] and that's where Israel did and I got to
[55:03] thinking it's not so much about the
[55:05] establishment but it can be but
[55:08] sometimes it's our attitudes it's
[55:10] sometimes we have within ourselves by
[55:13] our natural birth we have a dying
[55:15] character we we at the beginning when
[55:19] mankind fell they begin to take the
[55:21] blessings of God and put them on the
[55:23] inside like selfishness containment the
[55:26] bless blessings of St of God stop right
[55:28] here and all of a sudden that's the kind
[55:31] of character that you and I are born
[55:33] with but Jesus Christ never lived a day
[55:36] for himself he had a living character he
[55:39] when he was spoken evil of when he was
[55:42] persecuted and mocked and ridiculed he
[55:45] only returned good for evil what a
[55:48] character what an example and we're
[55:50] invited to come to him how many times do
[55:54] we have issues in life where the
[55:56] schoolmate or a work uh acquaintance or
[55:59] somebody in our family's done something
[56:02] and all of a sudden we forget that we've
[56:04] been invited to mold our character to
[56:06] his we immediately revert back to our
[56:09] old dying character and all a sudden we
[56:12] got problems and we we got difficulties
[56:15] but we want to recognize the invitation
[56:18] is every minute of the day God is
[56:20] present all the time to fulfill his word
[56:23] to give us this kind of life to set in
[56:26] course what he promised it would be I in
[56:29] you and you in me oh isn't that the Cry
[56:33] of the heart's desire of the believer
[56:35] today I want this mind to be in me that
[56:38] was also in Jesus Christ that thought it
[56:40] not robbery to be equal with God oh my
[56:44] and he died for this purpose we don't
[56:47] want this purpose to be in vain in our
[56:49] lives we don't want to just serve God by
[56:52] tradition we don't want to just believe
[56:54] oh I I'm part of this church I do this
[56:56] and I do that but oh my every day I'm
[56:59] going to God In Prayer I'm going to him
[57:02] he said come unto me God I'm taking your
[57:04] word I'm coming to you I have this
[57:06] problem I have this difficulty I want to
[57:09] come to him even like the brother says I
[57:11] want to thank God I want to worship you
[57:14] I want to be like that one leper that
[57:16] after 10 of them were healed I come back
[57:18] and praise you I thank you you're
[57:20] faithful to your
[57:21] word blessed be his name
[57:26] come unto me you know in an invitation
[57:30] when you're invited somewhere you want
[57:32] to at least give the honor and say I'm
[57:35] going to accept it I'm going to receive
[57:37] this invitation you know I thank God
[57:41] every time he was invited somewhere he
[57:43] showed
[57:45] up oh God I want to be that kind of
[57:48] Christian in the face of ridicule in the
[57:51] face of anything if it's your will God
[57:54] give me the grace to stand yes
[57:58] no yes Lord I want to be the one that
[58:01] says yes Lord I'll
[58:06] go oh my come to the
[58:09] table come to receive his word amen I
[58:13] didn't have much in the way of notes but

[1:00:59] choice huh we've been invited to come

[1:01:05] new birth it was as it was accounted
[1:01:09] with with the natural Act of man the
[1:01:11] desires of humanity that sin nature but
[1:01:15] he's saying now come let us reason think

[1:01:28] an invitation let me Ponder this Lord
[1:01:31] let me go to you in prayer I can't
[1:01:34] understand how my nature it's the dying
[1:01:37] nature how I can be on my knees and see
[1:01:40] that you paid the price and by coming to
[1:01:43] you and just receiving it by faith I can
[1:01:47] be white as snow you as
[1:01:51] individuals how many's experienced the
[1:01:53] love of Christ and the Forgiveness of
[1:01:55] your sins there's Witnesses here if you
[1:01:58] haven't come to that place he's inviting
[1:02:00] you to come be washed
[1:02:05] amen be clean and put away the the evil
[1:02:09] doing amen praise God think about
[1:02:14] it you know I I got to thinking of an
[1:02:17] example you
[1:02:19] know
[1:02:21] uh praise God in Genesis chapter 4
[1:02:26] you know when worshippers you know Cain
[1:02:29] and Abel they were worshippers they both
[1:02:32] came and they did their religious
[1:02:34] service and yet in one of them you know
[1:02:37] I just sometimes I think about it you
[1:02:39] know Adam and Eve when they were in that
[1:02:42] Perfection and then they fell into sin
[1:02:45] you know when God said I will put
[1:02:48] enity I will bruise the Serpent's heel
[1:02:51] or I will bruise the heel and I will
[1:02:54] crush the head God promised promising
[1:02:56] even then that there was going to be an
[1:02:58] atonement there was going to be one that
[1:03:01] would come and pay the price of sin but
[1:03:04] yet now see no doubt Adam and Eve they
[1:03:07] had experienced this glory of God in the
[1:03:11] Innocence it was a dispensation of
[1:03:14] Innocence they were naked and didn't
[1:03:16] have any shame but the moment they
[1:03:18] crossed that line then they began to
[1:03:21] have oh I was naked and I hid myself and
[1:03:23] then they started putting fig leaves and
[1:03:25] then they started trying to do something
[1:03:28] but yet what did God do God he clothed
[1:03:31] them with animal skins God was
[1:03:34] foreshadowing that great
[1:03:37] atonement see no doubt Adam and Eve they
[1:03:40] were talking with their children you
[1:03:42] know that was one time it was so
[1:03:45] glorious it was Majestic but we took
[1:03:48] this experience and you know what
[1:03:50] happened we were cast out of the garden
[1:03:51] really Mom Dad what are you serious can
[1:03:55] you imagine
[1:03:56] you know and all of a sudden the the two
[1:03:59] boys are going man this is incredible
[1:04:01] story and that's why some of us some of
[1:04:03] us young people may be going man this is
[1:04:05] an incredible story what he's telling
[1:04:07] but oh my when all of the sudden it was
[1:04:10] their time to go and make an altar and
[1:04:13] worship this these two boys they begin
[1:04:17] to do as they begin to what would you
[1:04:20] know hey what would be pleasing to God
[1:04:22] and all of a sudden they started placing
[1:04:24] you know Cain he placed faed his you
[1:04:26] know things of the field cuz he was
[1:04:28] tiller of the soil so no doubt he
[1:04:30] brought all the crops and the Beautiful
[1:04:31] F he made a beautiful worship to God and
[1:04:35] here you know Abel even was just you
[1:04:38] know just a shepherd and he you know
[1:04:41] something in him Pro it probably struck
[1:04:44] him because he was he had the ability to
[1:04:47] receive from God and no doubt Faith
[1:04:50] cometh by hearing and somehow there was
[1:04:53] a connection made that you know what
[1:04:56] I I need to slay a lamb because there's
[1:04:59] no way to worship God except under the
[1:05:02] shed blood of an innocent lamb something
[1:05:04] had to strike him the scripture says
[1:05:06] that Abel by faith offered a more
[1:05:09] excellent sacrifice unto God and Faith
[1:05:11] cometh by
[1:05:12] hearing it wasn't a knowledge hey you
[1:05:15] know what Adam and Eve telling no it was
[1:05:18] God dealing with individuals it was a
[1:05:21] personal Reckoning and and no doubt he
[1:05:24] said oh oh I know I you know this is
[1:05:28] what you require and all of a sudden
[1:05:31] here here comes the story where where
[1:05:33] you we're looking at Cain and and here
[1:05:35] it is in verse 5 he says but unto
[1:05:38] Cain and to his offering he had not
[1:05:41] respect and Cain was very wroth and his
[1:05:45] countenance
[1:05:46] fell oh he was
[1:05:48] mad you're like wait a minute and all of
[1:05:52] a sudden he says and the Lord said to
[1:05:54] Cain why thou wro why why aren't th why
[1:05:59] is that countenance fell why you know
[1:06:02] when God comes to you asking it's his
[1:06:04] grace it's time to get
[1:06:06] honest it's time to have a heart tohe
[1:06:08] heart he's coming to you he he he's
[1:06:12] willing he's easily to be
[1:06:15] entreated my I I want to be invited to
[1:06:19] that character when there's something
[1:06:21] going wrong I want somebody to be be
[1:06:23] able to come to me and I don't all of a
[1:06:25] sudden and give him the hammer I want to
[1:06:28] be able to say you know what okay I
[1:06:30] understand you know I want to have that
[1:06:33] understanding heart of God but here he
[1:06:35] is God's telling Cain he says
[1:06:37] why and he says if thou will do well
[1:06:41] shalt thou not be
[1:06:43] accepted yeah if
[1:06:45] thou if thou does not well sin lith at
[1:06:50] the door and unto thee shall be his
[1:06:53] desire and thou shalt
[1:06:56] and he shall rule over
[1:06:58] you
[1:07:00] okay you know I think the the mercies of
[1:07:03] God in the
[1:07:04] invitation see right then and there he
[1:07:09] he saw the light of the day in Abel as a
[1:07:14] worshipper of spirit and truth and his
[1:07:16] offering was accept but he was so
[1:07:20] jealous and he could not humble himself
[1:07:23] to do like his brother did
[1:07:26] and God warned him you know God always
[1:07:28] sends warning before judgment and he
[1:07:31] warned him he said you know what if you
[1:07:34] refuse to walk in this accepted way your
[1:07:37] sin
[1:07:38] nature the desires that you have will
[1:07:42] now control your every
[1:07:45] move you know your sin nature is not
[1:07:48] immune to this same
[1:07:51] thing that's why we must accept his
[1:07:54] invitation
[1:07:55] we must come to him we must say let this
[1:07:58] character I want to receive this
[1:08:00] character
[1:08:03] tonight and unto thee shall his desire
[1:08:07] and he Thou shalt rule over him oh my
[1:08:10] think about
[1:08:12] that and that's just one of the ways
[1:08:14] that we see in the scripture when
[1:08:17] someone turns down the invitation when
[1:08:20] someone refuses the light of the day
[1:08:22] okay my there's nothing but judgment and
[1:08:25] you see the manifestation of the fruit
[1:08:27] of the rejection he goes and out of
[1:08:29] jealousy he kills his brother and then
[1:08:31] he says oh am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:08:34] trying to cover the
[1:08:36] tracks
[1:08:39] my the human nature the heart of men is
[1:08:43] desperately wicked who can contain
[1:08:46] it but we look at this example found in
[1:08:51] John chapter 6 if you'll go with me
[1:08:53] there
[1:08:56] won't be
[1:08:58] long by the help of the Lord are you
[1:09:00] feeling okay all right praise
[1:09:03] God so in John chapter
[1:09:07] 6 and I believe we'll read in 60 John
[1:09:13] chapter 6
[1:09:25] he says many therefore of his disciples
[1:09:28] when they had heard this they said this
[1:09:31] is a hard saying who can hear it and
[1:09:34] when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:09:36] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:09:38] them do this offend you what if what and
[1:09:42] if ye shall see the son of man ascending
[1:09:45] up where he was
[1:09:48] before and it is the spirit that
[1:09:51] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[1:09:54] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:09:55] spirit and they are life but these are
[1:09:58] some of you that believe there are some
[1:10:01] of you that believe not for Jesus knew
[1:10:04] from the beginning who they were that
[1:10:06] believe not and shall betray him and he
[1:10:09] said therefore I say unto you that no
[1:10:12] man can come to me no man can come unto
[1:10:15] me except it be given of him of my
[1:10:20] father praise God for election
[1:10:25] no man can come to me can come unto me
[1:10:29] except he be given of my
[1:10:31] father and that from that time many of
[1:10:36] the disciples went back and walked no
[1:10:40] more with him you know some some people
[1:10:43] connect and and we believe that you know
[1:10:46] to to reject the Seal of God is to take
[1:10:50] the mark of the beast now to receive the
[1:10:53] Seal of God by the B AP ISM of the Holy
[1:10:56] Ghost you're sealed until the day of
[1:10:57] redemption right but you see the
[1:11:00] rejection of what Jesus was talking
[1:11:03] about and it's just so happens to be in
[1:11:05] John 666 so if you want to take that go
[1:11:09] ahead but he says then Peter confessed
[1:11:12] his faith he said then said Jesus unto
[1:11:15] the twel will ye also go
[1:11:20] away and then Simon Peter answered him
[1:11:23] Lord to whom whom shall we go thou Hast
[1:11:27] the words of eternal life and we believe
[1:11:31] and are sure that thou art that Christ
[1:11:35] the son of the Living God Amen I thank
[1:11:39] God for that because what a revelation
[1:11:42] what a rock when you go to him he gives
[1:11:44] you that same
[1:11:46] rock it takes all of the fear and dread
[1:11:49] of being saved today and lost
[1:11:52] tomorrow you're secure
[1:11:55] see I wonder when when we've been given
[1:11:59] the invitation to come unto him do we do
[1:12:03] we take do we receive it do we do we do
[1:12:06] it or is it just I did it two years ago
[1:12:09] I gave my heart to the Lord two years
[1:12:11] ago but now what he's saying and Peter
[1:12:14] is even testifying where else would we
[1:12:17] go think about it when we're going
[1:12:19] through a crisis oh we got to go to the
[1:12:22] doctor because there's a crisis on oh we
[1:12:26] got to go get financial aid cuz I don't
[1:12:28] know how we're going to pay for your
[1:12:29] school we got to go here we got to go
[1:12:31] there but Peter was saying where else
[1:12:34] will we
[1:12:36] go thou alone has has the words of Life
[1:12:39] see I believe sometimes in our Humanity
[1:12:43] we're all guilty of it we go to other
[1:12:45] places first okay but I want to give him
[1:12:48] the preeminence I said God you've given
[1:12:51] me this test you've given me this trial
[1:12:53] you've given me this situation
[1:12:55] that I can come to you and you can
[1:12:58] father me out of this
[1:13:00] situation you've given promises that I
[1:13:03] can be a partaker of divine
[1:13:05] nature so I want to take you at your
[1:13:07] word I want to come to you and look in
[1:13:10] what the the revealed word of the hour
[1:13:12] what the Bible says concerning my
[1:13:14] condition my
[1:13:15] situation I want to come to him take him
[1:13:19] at his word
[1:13:26] H you
[1:13:28] know I just want to tell you I think
[1:13:31] there's many reasons to go to him and
[1:13:34] I'll just say it this way like John said
[1:13:37] in chapter one but just run through a
[1:13:39] few scriptures and just point to the
[1:13:41] Lord but he says in the beginning was
[1:13:44] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:13:46] the Word was God and the same was in the
[1:13:49] beginning with God all things were made
[1:13:52] by him and without him was not anything
[1:13:55] made that was that was made and him him
[1:13:59] in him was life and the life that
[1:14:03] was the light of men I think that's a
[1:14:06] good reason to go to him he has life
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:11] amen and he's the creator of all
[1:14:15] things if there's an impossibility he's
[1:14:18] a way maker where there's no
[1:14:20] way we can go to him because we can know
[1:14:23] he made all things for him and by him so
[1:14:28] my condition didn't take God by surprise
[1:14:30] my situation but he's waiting for me to
[1:14:33] come to him he's already put the
[1:14:35] invitation out he's just waiting to see
[1:14:37] if we'll take his invitation say Let It
[1:14:40] Be according to your
[1:14:43] word
[1:14:45] my he says there was a man sent from God
[1:14:49] whose name was John the same came for a
[1:14:51] witness to Bear witness of the light
[1:14:55] that all men through him might believe
[1:14:57] oh my we can go to him because God has
[1:15:00] sent a message that we might believe
[1:15:03] that's a good reason to come to the
[1:15:05] table some of these things seem
[1:15:07] confusing and we're trying to talk it
[1:15:09] over with this person and that person
[1:15:11] and this person but we can't live by
[1:15:12] second hand we got to go to him there's
[1:15:15] one that's witnessed I've been in the
[1:15:17] presence of the Shak of glory and he's
[1:15:20] here
[1:15:22] tonight don't go to this person and
[1:15:25] person for your understanding go to the
[1:15:27] source come unto
[1:15:31] me he was not the light but he sent to
[1:15:34] Bear witness of that light and that was
[1:15:37] the True Light which lith every man that
[1:15:40] cometh into the world and he was in the
[1:15:42] world and the world was made by him and
[1:15:45] the world knew him not he came to his
[1:15:49] own and his own received him not but as
[1:15:52] many as received him to to them gave he
[1:15:56] power to become sons of God even to them
[1:15:59] that believe on his name which are born
[1:16:03] not of blood nor by the will of the
[1:16:05] flesh nor by the will of man but of God
[1:16:08] I think that's a good reason to go to
[1:16:09] him because he's the only one that has
[1:16:12] the power to make you be the Son of God
[1:16:15] that God's called you to to be the
[1:16:17] daughter of
[1:16:18] God oh my that's a good reason to go to
[1:16:22] him cuz he has the power right to
[1:16:27] transform he has the power to take what
[1:16:30] he promised as a promise giver and when
[1:16:34] you go to him and then he instructs you
[1:16:37] and then you act upon his word according
[1:16:39] to the instruction and you will find out
[1:16:41] real quick that he's also a promis
[1:16:43] keeper Hallelujah
[1:16:45] Glory
[1:16:48] Hallelujah oh
[1:16:52] my you know we must go to
[1:16:56] him we must go to him it says this in 19
[1:17:00] or excuse me we'll back up to 17 he says
[1:17:03] for the law was given by Moses but Grace
[1:17:06] Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ no man
[1:17:11] hath seen God at any time the only
[1:17:14] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[1:17:17] the father he hath declared him oh my
[1:17:21] think about that think about that you
[1:17:24] know if you need some Grace in your life
[1:17:27] if you need some truth in your life come
[1:17:29] to Jesus says this that the law came by
[1:17:34] Moses but Grace and Truth by Jesus
[1:17:37] Christ and if you're confused about the
[1:17:40] matter who the father is he said this no
[1:17:44] man has seen God at any time the only
[1:17:47] begotten son which is in the bosom of
[1:17:50] the father he hath declared amen oh my
[1:17:55] when we go to him we can understand God
[1:17:58] gives us sight to see and to understand
[1:18:01] praise
[1:18:03] God God is the only one that can give
[1:18:06] Revelation Jesus Christ is the only way
[1:18:18] amen I believe it's in John
[1:18:20] 14 we have to go to him because the
[1:18:24] scripture says in John
[1:18:26] 14 and this is the the Declaration he
[1:18:31] said that he's declared him but he says
[1:18:34] let
[1:18:35] your let not your heart be troubled ye
[1:18:38] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:18:41] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:18:43] were not so I would have told you I go
[1:18:46] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[1:18:49] and prepare a place for you I will come
[1:18:51] and again I will come again and receive
[1:18:54] you until myself that where I am there
[1:18:57] ye may be also and whether I go you know
[1:19:00] and the way you know Thomas said unto
[1:19:03] him Lord we know not whether thou goes
[1:19:06] and how can you we know the way Jesus
[1:19:09] said unto them I am the way the truth
[1:19:12] and the life no man come unto the father
[1:19:15] but by me so if we want to go we need to
[1:19:18] go to him because he's the way
[1:19:27] amen and Hebrews 9 and
[1:19:30] 28 just having a little Word
[1:19:34] Fellowship Hebrews
[1:19:37] 9 it's in here
[1:19:49] somewhere the scripture says there in
[1:19:52] 20 in uh 28 he says so Christ was once
[1:19:57] offered to Bear the sins of many Lord
[1:20:00] and unto them that look for him shall he
[1:20:05] appear the second time without sin unto
[1:20:09] salvation that's right now as I read
[1:20:11] that today I started pondering that but
[1:20:14] he just said for those who look for him
[1:20:18] he shall appear now I understand that
[1:20:21] there's been a fulfillment but you know
[1:20:24] also understand that scripture has a
[1:20:27] compound
[1:20:29] manifestation so now if God is going to
[1:20:32] come see the character that was in
[1:20:35] Christ was a sinless nature but he's
[1:20:39] saying now if you will accept this
[1:20:41] character if you will accept this mind
[1:20:44] then by a Divine
[1:20:47] transaction by you accepting that then
[1:20:50] you can also just like the scriptures
[1:20:53] stating here be be without sin unto
[1:20:56] salvation oh my you know the scripture
[1:20:59] says if we say that we haven't sinned we
[1:21:02] lie and the truth is not in us but that
[1:21:05] has a n on the end of that sin sinned
[1:21:10] but now when you come into Christ you
[1:21:12] are now identified with your sacrifice
[1:21:15] you are now in
[1:21:17] him when God looks at you he doesn't see
[1:21:21] you if you're identification is in the
[1:21:25] one who bid you come just like Peter he
[1:21:28] said Lord if that's you bid me come if
[1:21:32] the word said it I'm stepping out I'm
[1:21:34] stepping out on your word you said I
[1:21:37] would have a sinless nature you said by
[1:21:40] accepting this character that was in
[1:21:42] Christ then I too am spotless according
[1:21:46] to your word I might be walking into
[1:21:48] fulfillment praise God but because I
[1:21:50] have the ticket of invitation cuz I've
[1:21:53] received the spirit of Christ amen he's
[1:21:55] not looking at you he's looking at your
[1:21:59] identification when I see the blood I
[1:22:01] will pass over you the token must be on
[1:22:04] display I've come and I've bowed before
[1:22:07] him daily in prayer hearing the word of
[1:22:10] God I've got my instructions I've come
[1:22:13] and now I'm walking I'm walking in
[1:22:15] truth I'm walking in the
[1:22:18] light I know that the blood of Jesus
[1:22:20] cleanses us of all unrighteousness
[1:22:28] I am losing track of
[1:22:35] time amen he's the way he's the only way
[1:22:38] to be saved that's right can you imagine
[1:22:41] trying to find some satisfaction in some
[1:22:44] affiliation in church or some knowledge
[1:22:48] of being associated with people who wear
[1:22:51] dresses and skirts that's that's okay
[1:22:54] that's within our ranks that's one way
[1:22:57] to be accepted in the fellowship but
[1:22:59] we're looking to be accepted in the
[1:23:02] Beloved and we have to be born again we
[1:23:05] have to receive his spirit and be
[1:23:07] transformed be made a new creature in
[1:23:10] Christ Jesus so we must come to him and
[1:23:13] ask him to take those old rags and give
[1:23:16] us his spirit so we can be born
[1:23:19] again
[1:23:23] amen see we have to go to
[1:23:26] Jesus because he's the only
[1:23:31] truth you know in Hebrews chapter 9 and
[1:23:35] 16 we'll just back up a little bit but
[1:23:38] he says for where a testament is thereof
[1:23:42] also of a necessity be the death of the
[1:23:47] testator for a testament is of force
[1:23:50] after a man is dead or men are dead
[1:23:53] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[1:23:56] while the testator liveth whereupon
[1:23:58] neither the first testament was
[1:24:01] dedicated without blood that's right for
[1:24:03] when Moses had spoken every precept to
[1:24:07] all the people according to the law he
[1:24:09] took blood of calves and goats with
[1:24:12] water and Scarlet and hos and sprinkled
[1:24:15] it both the book and all the people
[1:24:17] saying this is the blood of the
[1:24:20] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[1:24:23] you more over he sprinkled the blood
[1:24:26] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[1:24:29] of the ministry and also All Things Are
[1:24:34] by the law purged with blood but without
[1:24:38] the shedding of blood is no remission of
[1:24:41] sins that is the truth God has declared
[1:24:44] it in the Old Testament in a shadow
[1:24:47] through bulls and goats but praise God
[1:24:50] when the Virgin was overshadowed by the
[1:24:53] Holy Ghost according to to Gabriel's
[1:24:55] visit we know that the Lamb of God was
[1:24:59] born into this world and introduced by
[1:25:01] John oh my think about that
[1:25:06] truth we want to be identified with our
[1:25:11] sacrifice we must come to him for our
[1:25:14] identification we must be willing to let
[1:25:16] go of our old character cuz that
[1:25:19] character identified you you were a
[1:25:21] harlot you were a wine Biber you were
[1:25:23] all of these different things but we
[1:25:25] must come to the place where we say you
[1:25:27] know what that's not my identification
[1:25:29] I've come to the Lord and he's told me
[1:25:32] he is I am the apple of his eye I am
[1:25:36] bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:25:39] flesh my I go back to the scripture in
[1:25:42] Genesis chapter 2 and I begin to see in
[1:25:46] verse 18 He says and the Lord said it is
[1:25:48] not good that a man should be alone I
[1:25:52] will make him a help meat for him
[1:25:54] this is not just a man speaking but God
[1:25:57] said I will make a help meat oh and just
[1:26:02] to think that all of this creation
[1:26:04] everything that's in existence and what
[1:26:06] working in motion is because God had one
[1:26:09] plan that he wanted to execute and he
[1:26:12] wanted to have a bride for his son
[1:26:14] praise God that they can have a family
[1:26:17] and be a family praise God and God wants
[1:26:20] you to know and have the same kind of
[1:26:22] Fellowship
[1:26:25] H that's why he's made a way that's why
[1:26:27] he shed his
[1:26:28] blood we couldn't come to him like I
[1:26:31] believe it was our pastor saying you
[1:26:33] know like Oh I'm a sinner and I'm this
[1:26:35] and that and yeah we look at ourselves
[1:26:37] we identify ourselves but God is saying
[1:26:39] look the way I look I want to heal your
[1:26:42] eyes so you can see the way I see come
[1:26:45] to me I want to give you healing for
[1:26:47] your
[1:26:49] eyes we must come to him because he's
[1:26:51] the only
[1:26:52] healer can you imagine like if all I put
[1:26:56] is confidence in the doctor I am going
[1:26:58] to be
[1:27:00] disappointed they can have
[1:27:04] 99.9 percentage of success in a
[1:27:07] treatment and all of a sudden I become
[1:27:11] that 0 percentile because if God's
[1:27:14] wanted to show me that he's my healer
[1:27:16] and I put all my confidence in something
[1:27:17] else you know what I'm going to have
[1:27:19] these struggles and these difficults
[1:27:22] it's going to continue on because God is
[1:27:24] a jealous
[1:27:26] God come to me I'm your healer by my
[1:27:30] stripes you are
[1:27:40] healed
[1:27:42] my think about it you know we got to
[1:27:45] come to him to really
[1:27:47] know that we have life you know when you
[1:27:50] look
[1:27:51] at when you look at John chapter
[1:27:55] 11 and we're all familiar with the
[1:27:58] testimony of our brother Lazarus you
[1:28:01] know he was a faithful
[1:28:04] servant and uh in John chapter
[1:28:08] 11 we'll go to
[1:28:15] 25 well we'll just back up to 23 Jesus
[1:28:18] said unto her thy brother shall rise
[1:28:20] again and Martha said unto him I know
[1:28:23] that he will rise
[1:28:26] again in the resurrection at the last
[1:28:28] day and Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:28:30] resurrection and the life he that
[1:28:33] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:28:36] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[1:28:40] believeth in me shall never die
[1:28:42] believest thou this oh my when we come
[1:28:46] to him he reveals himself that he is the
[1:28:50] resurrection and the life when we come
[1:28:52] to him and he reveal kills himself then
[1:28:55] he says okay now it's your time to make
[1:28:57] your
[1:28:58] confession when you come to him and he
[1:29:00] speaks to you and he says just like with
[1:29:02] Martha she said yay Lord I believe and
[1:29:05] he was bringing her to a further
[1:29:06] revelation of himself that's what he's
[1:29:08] doing to us every day if we'll come to
[1:29:11] him he wants to unfold himself further
[1:29:13] and more into our lives
[1:29:15] amen my I feel like I got to speed up
[1:29:18] here you know Jesus we must go to him
[1:29:23] because he's our
[1:29:25] lasting
[1:29:26] achievement you know it's one thing that
[1:29:30] I think we strive in life to have a
[1:29:32] successful life you know I think it's
[1:29:34] put in us to to do certain things to go
[1:29:37] to school and to give her all to be
[1:29:40] academic to do you know good studies and
[1:29:43] or if if we feel that you know our
[1:29:45] calling is sports then we'll we'll train
[1:29:48] according you know to to success in that
[1:29:51] area or if you know if if you know
[1:29:54] Finance is a big thing for somebody then
[1:29:57] they'll look to achieve a great wealth
[1:29:59] and you know if if you know if you feel
[1:30:02] in your heart you know God's called you
[1:30:04] to be a preacher well then you'll do and
[1:30:06] you'll fast and you'll pray and you look
[1:30:07] to the Lord and if you want to be a
[1:30:09] deacon or musician or if you want to
[1:30:11] have a place or a position you'll do all
[1:30:14] of those things God willing and those
[1:30:16] things are achievements great but they
[1:30:18] are not lasting they are
[1:30:21] temporary but he if we go to him he's
[1:30:23] the only lasting
[1:30:27] achievement when you get into Christ
[1:30:30] it's a permanent
[1:30:32] position when you finally get there it's
[1:30:35] a lasting achievement you don't get
[1:30:38] kicked out the next
[1:30:43] day you know if we'll go to Colossians
[1:30:46] chapter
[1:30:47] 1 I'm trying to go a little bit fast
[1:30:50] because I got a couple more things I
[1:30:51] just want to share with you in
[1:30:54] Colossians chapter 1 and
[1:30:57] verse we'll just start there um you know
[1:31:01] Brother David speak was speaking about
[1:31:03] the ministry of reconciliation when he
[1:31:05] was preaching last and I I just you know
[1:31:08] to think that God has given us the
[1:31:11] ministry of
[1:31:12] reconciliation you know he says be ye
[1:31:14] reconciled but then after you're
[1:31:16] reconciled and come into Christ now you
[1:31:19] the same Works he did God is telling you
[1:31:21] to go out and do
[1:31:24] he's giv you power to become a Son of
[1:31:27] God to conduct his business the way he
[1:31:30] did to cast out Devils to Open the Eyes
[1:31:34] of the blind to unstop deaf
[1:31:37] ears to raise the
[1:31:39] dead to impart
[1:31:41] life
[1:31:49] my says this we'll just read there in 19
[1:31:53] he says for it please the father that in
[1:31:55] him should all fullness dwell and having
[1:31:59] made peace through the blood of his
[1:32:02] cross by him to reconcile all things
[1:32:05] unto himself by him I say whether they
[1:32:08] be things in Earth or things in heaven
[1:32:11] and you that were sometime alienated and
[1:32:14] enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet
[1:32:18] hath he
[1:32:19] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[1:32:22] through the death to present you holy
[1:32:25] unblamable
[1:32:27] unreprovable in his sight if you
[1:32:31] continue in the faith grounded and
[1:32:33] settled and not moved away from the hope
[1:32:36] of the Gospel which you have heard and
[1:32:39] which we have preached to every creature
[1:32:41] which is under Heaven whereby I Paul
[1:32:44] made a
[1:32:45] minister amen and who now rejoice in my
[1:32:50] suffering for you and fill up that which
[1:32:52] is behind the afflictions of Christ in
[1:32:54] my flesh for his body's sake which is
[1:32:57] the church wherefore I am made a
[1:33:00] minister according to the dispensation
[1:33:02] of God which is given unto me for you to
[1:33:05] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[1:33:07] which has been hid from all from ages
[1:33:11] and
[1:33:12] generation from Generations but now is
[1:33:15] made manifest to his
[1:33:17] Saints to whom God would make known The
[1:33:22] Riches of his glory and this mystery
[1:33:24] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:33:26] you the hope of glory amen and that's
[1:33:29] you know that's that's another reason
[1:33:31] why we must go to him because he's the
[1:33:33] only one that can manifest his glory in
[1:33:35] our lives that's right it is actually
[1:33:38] God in you to will yes and do of his
[1:33:41] good pleasure so we must go to him and
[1:33:44] him energize the faith of the Son of God
[1:33:48] inside of us to move us into action but
[1:33:52] we must go to him and ask you know the
[1:33:56] scripture says that he that lack wisdom
[1:33:59] let him ask so we don't go to God like
[1:34:03] we know it like I know the Mysteries I
[1:34:05] know the seals I know what God wants I'm
[1:34:07] I'm going to pray God this is your no if
[1:34:09] you lack wisdom concerning a matter go
[1:34:12] humbly before him God I don't know I
[1:34:15] have this knowledge of things I went to
[1:34:18] school I have an experience but I'm
[1:34:20] lacking something and the scriptures
[1:34:23] told me to come come that I've been
[1:34:24] invited to ask you and you would not
[1:34:27] turn me
[1:34:28] away amen thank God for the invitation
[1:34:32] to
[1:34:38] ask you
[1:34:48] know the last one of the last things I
[1:34:51] want to say is you know we must go to
[1:34:53] him because he's the only one that has
[1:34:56] translation he's the only one that can
[1:34:58] change us okay in a moment in a weekl
[1:35:01] number
[1:35:04] nine in
[1:35:07] John we'll go to John chapter 6 once
[1:35:10] again and just read
[1:35:17] this this would be our last scripture
[1:35:19] that we read
[1:35:28] in John chapter
[1:35:33] 6 let's start there in um verse
[1:35:38] 32 then Jesus said unto them verily
[1:35:41] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[1:35:44] the bread from heaven but my father
[1:35:47] giveth you the true bread from Heaven
[1:35:50] okay for the bread of God is he which
[1:35:54] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:35:58] unto the
[1:35:59] world then said unto him Lord moreover
[1:36:04] give us this
[1:36:05] bread and Jesus said unto them I am the
[1:36:08] bread of life he that cometh to me shall
[1:36:12] never
[1:36:13] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[1:36:16] never thirst but I say unto you that ye
[1:36:20] also have seen me and not belied all
[1:36:23] that the father had given me shall come
[1:36:26] to me and he that cometh to me I will in
[1:36:30] no wise cast out for I come down from
[1:36:33] heaven not to do my own will but the
[1:36:35] will of him that sent
[1:36:37] me and this is the Father's will which
[1:36:42] hath sent me that of all which he had
[1:36:47] given me I shall lose nothing but should
[1:36:51] raise it up again in the last day
[1:36:54] and this is the will of him that sent me
[1:36:56] that everyone which seeth the son and
[1:36:59] believeth on him may have everlasting
[1:37:03] life and I will raise him up at the last
[1:37:05] day amen and the Jews then murmured at
[1:37:08] him because he said I am the bread which
[1:37:10] came down from heaven and they said is
[1:37:13] this is not this Jesus the son of Joseph
[1:37:17] whose father and mother we know how is
[1:37:21] it then that he SA sayith I come down
[1:37:25] from heaven Jesus therefore answering
[1:37:27] and said unto them murmur not among
[1:37:30] yourselves no man can come to me except
[1:37:33] my Father which hath sent me draw him
[1:37:37] and I will raise him up in the last day
[1:37:39] it is written in the prophets and that
[1:37:41] they shall be taught of God and every
[1:37:44] man therefore that is have heard and
[1:37:47] have learned of the father cometh unto
[1:37:51] me not that any man hath seen the father
[1:37:55] save he which is of God hath seen the
[1:37:58] father verily verily I say unto you he
[1:38:01] that believeth on me hath everlasting
[1:38:04] life and I am the bread of life amen
[1:38:08] praise God do you feel like you you have
[1:38:12] been built up in the vitamins of God do
[1:38:15] you know that you're a privileged person
[1:38:18] you're an individual that has a choice
[1:38:21] tonight things that you have been fa ing
[1:38:24] trials circumstance situations you've
[1:38:27] been holding them in your heart and God
[1:38:29] is still a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:38:31] Tents of the heart so as you've come to
[1:38:34] him tonight don't leave tonight without
[1:38:37] giving and accepting God for what you
[1:38:41] need God he will not turn you away in no
[1:38:45] wise will he cast you out if you're
[1:38:48] saying oh God I've been believing you
[1:38:49] for a long time let this be the night
[1:38:52] that you receive it am let let your
[1:38:55] faith rise up to the place that it's by
[1:38:58] his invitation just like with Peter the
[1:39:01] moment he knew it was God calling him he
[1:39:05] gave him the faith to step out and the
[1:39:07] supernatural happen this is not a man
[1:39:10] speaking so much if if it's God in your
[1:39:13] heart and God is speaking to you it's
[1:39:16] God Amen respond to the call amen we'll
[1:39:21] invite the musicians why don't we
[1:39:38] stand you know I think we're privileged
[1:39:41] people when we consider that the Creator
[1:39:44] God he wanted to be in Fellowship he
[1:39:47] wanted us to know him in the power of
[1:39:48] his resurrection you know and to God
[1:39:52] will never
[1:39:54] overstep the power that you have to
[1:39:56] choose okay there's a power of Satan
[1:39:59] there's a power of God and then there's
[1:40:01] a power of decision you can tonight
[1:40:05] consider the thing that's been plaguing
[1:40:07] you the confusion or the distress or the
[1:40:11] difficult but God has given us a
[1:40:13] decision he doesn't want you bound and
[1:40:16] the word of God is not bound it's not
[1:40:19] limited to our unbelief God wants to
[1:40:22] come and meet you where you're at now if
[1:40:26] God has spoken to your heart and it's
[1:40:28] not coming to me Jesus said come unto me
[1:40:31] and I believe like the faith of Abraham
[1:40:33] you know when he was given the promise
[1:40:36] in Genesis
[1:40:37] 12 I just think about it if we're the
[1:40:39] faith Seed of Abraham and God came to
[1:40:42] Abraham and he said I will see this is
[1:40:46] God now saying I am going to perform
[1:40:49] this it does not have anything to do
[1:40:51] with you I am going to make you a father
[1:40:54] of many nations and all a sudden he
[1:40:58] began to recognize who was talking to
[1:41:01] him and you know what he did you know
[1:41:05] what he he he was given an invitation
[1:41:08] and all of a sudden you know what the
[1:41:10] old man the old nature you know he he
[1:41:12] started looking out and he says you know
[1:41:14] what hey if we're going out into this
[1:41:16] land and you now we're being driven out
[1:41:17] to go do this thing hey when we get to
[1:41:20] the you know where Pharaoh is and stuff
[1:41:22] just tell them you know you're my sister
[1:41:25] you know and all of a sudden that nature
[1:41:27] see but now God is allowing him to be
[1:41:30] exposed on his side that God's trying to
[1:41:33] deal with sometimes God's allowing us to
[1:41:36] expose our other
[1:41:38] side the the dying character part but oh
[1:41:42] my all of a sudden when he began to
[1:41:44] realize it didn't have anything to do
[1:41:47] with that it had everything to do what
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:50] Said and all of a sudden when he began
[1:41:53] and and God came to him again then he
[1:41:55] began to make an altar he began to
[1:41:57] establish Stones Revelations one on top
[1:42:01] of the other and realize this is the
[1:42:03] place of my worship God is only pleased
[1:42:06] by Revelation if God has giving you a
[1:42:09] revelation place it upon the altar
[1:42:11] tonight and say God from this day I know
[1:42:14] I'll be changed I know I'm changed now
[1:42:18] we don't come here by tradition this is
[1:42:20] not to gain a carnal knowledge this is
[1:42:22] to hear from God God speakly to you as
[1:42:25] an individual and God is looking for you
[1:42:28] to
[1:42:29] respond I don't care who's looking I
[1:42:32] don't care who sees me my God moved on
[1:42:34] my invitation I invited him to come to
[1:42:37] be the guest of honor then he turns
[1:42:39] around as a gentleman and says but I've
[1:42:41] invited you to come oh my think of it
[1:42:46] and then just looking at the situation
[1:42:49] and how God is dealing with Abraham and
[1:42:51] then all of a sudden they were in a
[1:42:52] great fellow ship and now he tells him
[1:42:55] separate yourself he's already laid out
[1:42:57] the promise I don't want to open the
[1:42:58] Bible cuz I'll start going again but you
[1:43:01] know I just think think of it how he's
[1:43:04] he's wanting to have this fellowship
[1:43:05] with you that he can reveal that he's a
[1:43:09] dynamic God that he has supreme
[1:43:12] authority and if you'll take his word
[1:43:15] and put it on your lips God will bring
[1:43:17] it to
[1:43:18] pass amen let us pray
[1:43:24] [Music]

[1:53:09] gone he's calling you tonight I I want
[1:53:13] to accept that invitation and say Lord
[1:53:15] I'm coming you know I was thinking it's
[1:53:17] like you know me deciding to show up at
[1:53:20] the White House tonight and just show up
[1:53:21] they won't let me in but if I say the
[1:53:24] president called me if I say they
[1:53:26] invited me that's why I'm here they have
[1:53:28] to let me in why because I have an
[1:53:31] invitation of him that called me he that
[1:53:33] called his voice makes the
[1:53:36] way his voice provides the means by
[1:53:40] which you can come
[1:53:42] in we didn't call ourselves here tonight
[1:53:45] he called you to be here he and he that
[1:53:49] called you I love what the scripture
[1:53:51] says he's that started to work will
[1:53:53] bring it to a finish because when he
[1:53:55] calls he has the means by which he can
[1:53:58] bring the power of
[1:54:00] transformation to take you and make you
[1:54:02] a finished product Oh the only thing I'm
[1:54:06] excited about is I heard the voice I
[1:54:09] heard the calling well you you look like
[1:54:11] a mess I know but I heard the calling oh
[1:54:15] you you look like there's nothing good
[1:54:17] about you I know but I heard his voice
[1:54:20] his voice is good enough to provide
[1:54:22] everything I have need of to wash me to
[1:54:25] cleanse me to give me the clothes that I
[1:54:28] need to put me in shape so I can be
[1:54:31] presented before him our entrance into
[1:54:34] the feast is the calling come unto me
[1:54:38] and I want to just say tonight don't
[1:54:40] don't don't ever turn that invitation
[1:54:43] down and I believe with all my heart
[1:54:45] that every time we come to church we
[1:54:47] hear this voice and we hear the word of
[1:54:50] God it's an invitation it's no knocking
[1:54:52] into our hearts and say come I I know
