Description:
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Evening Service: June 3,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

that you have come to do something specific for each one of us Lord may this time not slip away from us in vain but Lord may we look with a whole heart to know that you are here to perform your word or we just surrender ourselves to you now we ask that by your Holy Ghost you would come and take complete control of the service more as we dealed ourselves to you as the hearer would yield themselves to you Lord to anoint our lips right there ears to hear more than we asked that you'd break the bread of life as only you can we ask it in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord I mean if you have your Bibles we'll be reading out of Isaiah 55 verse 11 man it's wonderful to see each one of you out to the house of the Lord maybe we'll just read this scripture isaiah 55:11 and then we'll go to Philippians 2 1 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing we're unto I sent it that scripture could certainly be expounded upon no matter when the Lord speaks his word it could lay there for hundreds or thousands of years but it's going to come into manifestation and it's going to to make it to the one that it was intended for Philippians 2 1 be reading to verse 9 Philippians 2 1 there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let us esteem one another better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mine being you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon in the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name Amen you may have your seats and just in thinking on this the scripture I was just just seemed like the Lord had placed the the scripture in my mind let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus and maybe for an odd title tonight I just want to speak to you on God's time capsule God's time capsule as this as I just as the Lord placed this scripture into my heart and I was just meditating upon that let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus those words just came to my heart God's time capsule and I I wasn't sure what the Lord was trying to show me and so I first had to find out what a time capsule was by definition and as I looked into the Webster dictionary it says this container holding historical records or objects representative of a current culture that is deposited as in a cornerstone for preservation until discovery by some future age and I just started to in my heart just started to see the mind of the Lord and that because we know that Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone and he is the word of God and God is there's things that are laying in the word that God has spoken there's a thought of God that he is expressed and no matter what it's going to come to manifestation and maybe just as I just just expound my heart to you I also want to maybe in the forefront say that you are God's time capsule be God has placed a predestinated seed in your life though you were in the mind of God before the time was ever even spoken into existence but yet God had something that he intended for your life to manifest and so there was a thought concerning you that he had spoken and now this little predestinated seed was sown out there in time until the appointed time had come and then everything that was within that expression or in that word was going to be manifested in the time that God had allotted for it and you know just in as we begin to minister you know we've been kind of thinking along the lines of God's secret place you know in the time of trouble God shall hide me in the secret of his tabernacle you David said there's one thing that I have desired and you're the secret of his Tabernacle was that holy place and you know as we as we minister in this direction you know we want to have that hunger we want to have that desire and that craving that we would come into that secret place because it's in there that we're feeding on the secret things of God and God is making himself known to the believer look this walk is by revelation it's not a one-time revelation it's not a one-time revelation but we need God to continue to reveal himself and continue for his word to unfold and we just don't want to to get complacent be in in recognizing what God has done in this day and then off of that alone go and not realize that there's so much there more laying before us that God is wanting us to manifest and just in this thought that I was looking at on God's time-capsule I started to maybe look at time capsules that have have been found and they they remember the expression is something that is sealed away for a future age and they say there's all kind of time capsules that are buried around Washington DC I guess you know that the thought behind it is is that you you'll take something if we were going to bury a time capsule we would maybe take things that we felt were relevant to our code turn to the signs of the times and then we would bury it in the ground for a future age but I'm telling you don't worry about burying any time capsules because there ain't going to be no future age to dig it up all right but the thought was I believe that Paul Revere he had he a plant he had he had a dug a hole and placed a little container there in Washington DC and I I from what I understand they felt that it was maybe dated or something that he had done that in 1795 of if I remember properly and and oh they they they just dug it up about five years ago and and they started to look at the contents in there and I believe there was like an image of George Washington and and there was some engraving that a written engravement on a little piece of metal that I believe Paul Revere was a metalworker and there was also I think they call it a pion shilling that was I think it was dated from the 1600s or something that was in there and so they could take these artifacts and they could look at him but you know they could only presume what Paul Revere was thinking when he put these things into that cornerstone uh uh you know why did he feel that these things were relative why did he feel that that people - 300 years down the road would even care but he thought that you know what I will I will take these certain items that I'm going to place them in there and then all these were discovered several hundred years later and then these these are experts or whatnot they they look at these things and maybe they try to piece together in their mind what what its relevancy was to the time and you know you could just make the type and the parallel with where we're going and I just was thinking upon a cornerstone that how brother branham when he was laying the cornerstone there and the tabernacle there in 1933 he also I was laying a cornerstone and and there on that morning in 1933 as we've recently spoke about the Prophet was caught up into a vision and in that vision God had shown him that he would be preaching to the to the worlds and he was at one time Eames in the vision he was there at the Tabernacle preaching he was thanking the Lord for the tavern the angel Lord picked him up and put him there and the big blue sky and he said he said he told him that that wasn't the tabernacle but this is your tabernacle because he had a message that was going forth to the world and as he came out of that vision the the the angel of the Lord told him read 2nd Timothy 4 and you know he turned and he turned into his Bible and you know when he started to read 2nd Timothy 4 and it said do the work of evangelist it says I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preached the word and be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions and do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry and all that just struck a chord with the prophets heart he says he just ripped it out the page I was out of his valuable and he ate me and he went to lay in there the cornerstone in the tabernacle and he put the that little scripture there in the cornerstone with maybe some other items and they placed it there at the building of the tabernacle because there at that time the Prophet felt you know this this scripture is relevant and I'm going to place this in the cornerstone of the time and I go look that was not just by chance that wasn't just a carnal thing that was done but no was in that same year in 1933 that there at the Ohio River he'd be baptizing there and we're familiar with this testimony that they're a pillar fire came was starred as some would call it and it spoke there and said as John the Baptist for and the first coming of Jesus Christ so shall your ministry for on the second coming of Jesus Christ and there when a ministry out to the world the healing ministry all around and around the globe at wit there for 10 years 20 years just going forth from the power and demonstration of showing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and as you know you think of this now just laying in that cornerstone there was that scripture second Timothy four and you would wonder maybe if somebody if if the Lord was to tarry and time went on and somebody was maybe doing something to the tabernacle who knows maybe it would become a storehouse maybe they would be tearing it down somebody might come upon the contents in there and they would wonder what all of it meant they would wonder why is this even in here but see the only way they would know that if the person who put it in there could come and tell them this is what was happening this is what I was thinking this was the very a hard purpose of why I placed that in there and that's what we've seen now that Christ the true cornerstone which was rejected the word lay in there for generation after generation and men have been pondering and pondering what the word meant to know they've come to interpretations and they've come to false religions and all these things and they've wondered and they've probed that what all these mysteries are laying there in the Bible but all I could say the only way we could have the true revelation is if the word himself came and he started to break the bread of life and it revealed the mysteries that was laying within the word to us then we would have the mind of God then we'd have the thoughts of God we would know what isn't it was we would know what his heart purpose was we would know what his planned before the foundation of the world and why the scriptures were laid in there like they were only if he could come and he would be the one that would break the bread of life and he would be the one to interpret the scripture all then we would know what the mind of God is let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus as I thought upon these things oh I believe it's in this day it's at this age that there's being big things that have been preserved all the way down to this hour that the Lord Jesus Christ has descended with an open book and he has leased the seven seals given the bride of Jesus Christ his mind that you would know what to do with his word oh that's the day and age that we're living in just thinking of the Cornerstone they're laying in the tabernacle even the Prophet that day wouldn't know the whole meaning of the scripture that he'd laid there for there he read the first five verses and believe it was in 1962 God dealt with the prophet's heart there I believe Aberdeen North Carolina was where he was I believe about in May 1962 I believe it was the the age of the Lord asked the Prophet to take a brother by the name of Joseph Bossier out into the yard and so he took this brother out into the yard and they were having a little fellowship there and brother Joseph said to brother Branham brother Branham have you ever read the rest of second Timothy four I believe maybe in pertaining to his ministry of pertaining to himself and brother Branham just no I never I never really have and brother Branham starts to explain there as he's preaching I believe present stage of my ministry in September of 1962 he starts to show that look I never I never read of the rest of 2nd Timothy 4 he said he said the first part that part that he had ripped out the very reason he had placed that there in the tabernacle there in 1933 those first five verses he says that's been fulfilled tonight that work has been done but oh now he was entering in to another part of his ministry he starts to talk about a climax in his ministry the first pool has gone forth the second pull his mouth Lord and hear something was laying in the word but it was laying there until a time that it was going to be revealed it was sealing that own it was a mystery maybe laying right there for the prophets life but now as it moves on down and his ministry is unfolding first pull second pull now in 1962 oh there's coming a crowning of his ministry what is it it's those mysteries it's those Ponder's it's the loosening of the seven seals it's that third pull it's revealing trashed oh there was something there laying in the word until an appointed time it had been sealed away from the ages all the mystery that had been hidden through the ages but now is coming forth to the crowning time of the prophet and we know that a prophet is the divine learn the word of the Lord comes through the Prophet and that's where we receive the mind of Christ it's from a vindicated messenger that God my strips are ordained according to a divine promise of revelations 10-7 said at the sounding of the seventh angel message when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of God will be finished Oh have you been come under the headship of the message that has been delivered in the seventh age you can know the very mind of God Oh hallelujah thank God for his promises thank you thought worst truth there the learned had gone forth God had spoke the word had been written there in the scripture some 2,000 years ago laying there but he said my words shall go forth said my word shall go forth you bring that up isaiah 55:11 for me so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth 2000 years ago it's not going to return to me void if I said behold I send you Elijah the prophet there is going to be a you to receive the Elijah the Prophet it was spoken over 2,000 years ago all the soul shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me boy learning shall accomplish that which I please and what did he want to accomplish if we had time to go down that way God wanted to accomplish a bride he wanted to accomplish a bride that wasn't like Eve he wanted to have a bride that was bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh that would reject the devil's lies that would say no to all the lady you'll see itami nonsense out there tommyrot somebody the Prophet would call it all that would look to him and him the word only hey that was God's great achievement is that he would Shiva brown and how does he do it he doesn't by his word and now our part to play and it is to believe him and take him at his word and say yeah amen to every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's how we live man don't live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God oh do you start to think of the things that have been spoken concerning you the things that God wants to achieve all these things we've heard for years a bride without spot or wrinkle your you justify you never did it in the first place his word has gone forth it is not going to return unto Him void it's going to be manifested in the lives that the names have been put in the Lamb's Book of Life and look when that when the devil tries to fight you on that and tries to point to your life and tries to point to you the way of living don't look at yourself you pull him right back to the word we overcome just like Jesus over time it is written it is written he said he said he doesn't say you overcome by you know what I did a really good job yesterday I did a really good job the last three months I've been a really good job the last three years you know I'm really proud of myself if you want to go to a religious a way of serving the Lord that's exactly what the devil wants to offer you he wants to beguile you in your mind into you thinking that there's something that you can do to earn salvation I'm here to tell you by the Lord of Lord there's nothing you can do to water salvation salvation is the grace of God it is a gift of God that's any market most all that is salvation so I want to tell you tonight if the Lord could just bring you some deliverance I don't care how far you've gone I don't care how far you've got I don't care the terrible things that you've done oh it's not by works that you wore salvation it is by the grace of God and what we do is we identify with the sacrifice we say Lord forgive me for the things that I've done may the bleach blood of Jesus tries to be applied to my life and when you do that you're justified what's in that's how powerful the blood is what's in you don't have to pray the same amount of prayers the sins you did sin doesn't compete with the Word of God we're not Catholics we don't do penton's Matthew yes this is for your sins today you need to pray 430 times and today you're gonna write it on the chalkboard and when you're done you're forgiven no no look that you're the reason Jesus Christ came to Calvary had even died because he placed your name of a Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the law and it was his whole intent and purpose to come and take your place for everything that you had ever done and when you come in contact with that bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ sin is annihilated the prophets head its goal it goes all the way back and it's stuck on your accuser oh how do you like that devil you're gonna be the one to burn in hell for all the things you thought you made me do that's the gospel oh what a victory you ever catch a revelation of justification always set your spirit free so you can just start to soar in the Havanese and heavenly places in Christ Jesus you can be freed from that burden of sin and know that if he said it I believe it oh thank you Lord Jesus well we have to stick with the word we have so much intellectual religion in this day people adding to the word people taking away from the word you know we have so much religion even inside the message with people's interpretations and they go out on this limb and they go out on that limb a brother branham said in the the church age book he said in the last stage we've come back to the capstone revelation which is the most important revelation of the Godhead in the whole Bible we've just been fellowshiping on these things and just thinking of how in our day we know that the lamb has come forth to claim the book and there he's come forth to claim the book and there's these thoughts and and my some ministers preach it this way some some maybe I preach it that way and start to to wonder and ponder adda how the lamb has left the mercy seat and as their mercy anymore and if you go back and fellowship with with brothers that were there back in the in the in the 60s there in the 70s and oh am I such a sobering time and I want to say that it should still be a sobering time but my you start to think of this of what was really accomplished when the lamb came forth for redemption rights he came and took the book that was in the hand of him on the throne that book he took it and then he opened the book and he loosed the seals thereof and you look at this what is taking place here brother Branham says in the first seal that all of these people I'll just read it here it says he's talking about them going through the tribulation now we're we're just linking this with the blood of Jesus Christ if you've pled the blood of Jesus Christ the bleach of that the blood of Jesus Christ annihilates sin and so in this thought here of why would the church go through tribulation the Prophet is showing that if you have pleaded the blood of Jesus Christ and you've received the truth of the hour of the blood of Jesus Christ you have been forgiven and you are justified and the argument of denominations and some churches is that know that you still have to go through tribulation with the Prophet clearly shows why would you have to go through a tribulation the tribulation is a time for purging it's a time that you go through for purging and if you've come in contact with the blood of Jesus Christ what are you being purged for and the Prophet makes this statement there in the first seal he says they thought they were under the blood he says the purging of the trial the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood backing up they say they go through the purging of the trial of the tribulation because they're not actually under the blood they claim they are but they're not that's the prophets word how can they go through a trial to purify them when the bleach blood of Jesus Christ takes every symptom of sin and stuff away from you and you are already dead and your life is hid in him through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost now let's just move down the line a little bit to just make a little progress the scripture says in 1st John 1:7 it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin so it's important that you have to recognize your day and its message many people recognize the day they're living in alrigth uh denominational world and I don't even think you have to be a Christian to recognize this things at the end when people like managed the end of the world as we know it people have lost their minds we've put laws in order so that criminals could legally wear masks and loot stores and go out in the public and not be identified it just looks it just is such a strange peculiar time that we're living in but you can recognize the day you're living it but we must recognize the message many people recognize the endtime but we must recognize the light of God's gospel at the end time and just reading out of the indictment I just want to maybe show something where brother Branham is going to show as as this exodus from Judaism into Christianity as we would say that the law was a type in a shadow the law was given as a type for when the anti-type came it was a shadow and brother Branham says now and the indictment he says now in Christ is God's provided land notice how appropriate it was now showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when it wasn't in fact it was in effect until that hour the blood of the Lamb was alright until that day but now at the crucifixion it changes the old systems is done there was a new one and the lamb was at the sacrifice the lamb the sacrificial lamb was on the ground speaking of Christ they were condemning and doing the very thing that they had to do that's right God be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day so the prophets about to make a transition here he's showing how there was a change in a dispensation how the law had been given by God and it was in effect until Jesus Christ who was to fulfill all the law and condemned sin in the flesh the law was given until the time that the true lamb would come and that when the true lamb would come then there would be a changing in the dispensation he says God be blessed for us seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this day showing that there's another a change here because the churches is doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ lured from then on it comes the word and the word only from the old Paschal Lamb passed away and Christ become a lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day that the denomination crucified the Word of God and accepted a creed instead of the word that's the day the word come into full effect that's just been here recently so if you looked at the type here brother branham is pointing out here at this exodus from the law that here they had been the God that established the tabernacle in the temple and he'd go into the outer courts and then you could you could progress there into the holy place and then behind the holiest of Holies there was the Shekinah glory where the high priests would go once a year and atone with the sacrificial lamb for the sins of the priests and for the people once a year and that was in tight of the true lamb that was going to come but now when Christ the word hufa was fulfilling all the laws I hadn't spoken now he had come and he was there he says he was on the ground and there at the crucifixion what happened god rent the veil in the temple in the proper sense what was it doing it was showing the world the real mercy state it was showing to the people but a real mercy see look you've been doing this as a type and as a shadow for so long but now I'm tearing the balance showing you that Jesus Christ the lamb the sacrificial lamb he has come and he has paid the price for sin he is the mercy seat so no longer was the old order gonna work anymore there was no mercy on that old mercy seat because now the true mercy seat Jesus Christ had come and he there he was he was lifted up there on Calvary to draw all men unto Him there was the true mercy seat hang in there and now the Prophet is showing mine he's showing that what has happened in our day the word has come once again and proving that it's the same yesterday today and forever but there's been available of tradition there's been a veil of unbelief there's been a veil that's been put over the eyes of the people and they have not been able to see him it's been veiled to him but he's showing what happens in this change of this dispensation as he says the early guy me says the lamb was on well I could say that I see he's preaching this the lamb was on the grounds again he had come with an open book in hand to loose the seven seals there was true mercy as that capsule was descending they say grace granny's grace you never did it in the first place you are justified oh there was the truth Marcy see coming to the Gentiles revealing himself to his bride and the veil of traditions have been ripped it had been torn away and there was showing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever according to a divine promise he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be of the days of the revealing of the Son of Man all that Scripture was laying there a long time it was laying there a long time like a little time capsule sealed up just moving right on down the time until the hour for the contents and for the truth that were locked up in there to be revealed oh thank you lord John 6:63 says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are alive the message that we have received it is spirit and it is life if you could look past the veil and see that it's God's word being manifested a divine promise that God had ordained that he would come to the Gentiles proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever and he would speak words of life oh he would speak words of life and he says it's the word and the word only his word is bringing forth life and Paul said in second Corinthians 4:7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us oh we have this treasure that very things that he's speaking of the very things that the prophets spoke of the very manifestation in the very life the very Holy Ghost it's in an army earthen vessels it's in your skin oh praise God for the truth praise God for the revelation praise God that he saw fit to call my name I like how the Prophet there at spoken word as the original CD says the word is in the bride and she knows what to do with it she has thus saith the Lord or she stands still oh my we have this treasure in earthen vessels the very word that God sent the very thing he wanted to achieve in the last days there's a bride right here feeding on the word riping in the presence of the son going to manifest these very things that was spoken but we know that God is wanting to reveal the very secrets of his heart to his bride just reading out of Colossians 1:25 says wherefore I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which has been hidden the ages and from generations but has now made manifest to his Saints to god would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory the prophet says this was as text for christ the mystery of God revealed and reading from that message he says now God had a purpose and a hidden mystery that's what I want to speak onto the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to the present hour that we're living my what a statement the entire Bible just skipping down a little further the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had Wow that's a big statement one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of all the believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's great role is in now and the last day he has revealed it and shows it one goal let think of the emphasis the Prophet is putting here now he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible I tell you I'd be like what age is that I want to be there if God had one goal and one thing he was one Express and all the acts of all the believers down through the whole Bible and everything was leading up to one purpose and one thing that God wanted to achieve those were all in type with God's great goal is in now in the last days he has revealed it and shows it we could stop down on a little bit to talk about what we received in our day but I just want to say this is not a way of thinking this is not something you mimic this is not something that you can you can sit down and collectively people together but this is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you prophets say we should pray for revelation I would encourage you to pray for Revelation and pray O God reveal this water to me there's so many things oh if I understand a thousandth of a percent I don't even know but oh god I know there's so much more for me and planning for Revelation Lord that this revelation would continue to unfold to me on a personal level Lord can reveal yourself to me but you know people will carry the message in their mind for years you you can I mean you could walk somebody through Scripture and through the Bible and through that I look there's tons of witnesses and testimonies to vindicate what God has done in this hour just depends on what you're looking at but if you can get somebody and get them to look at all these things and you can talk them through it man you get a group of people that's on fire for the Lord and everything like yeah this is what God's doing they can get excited they can actually accept the message in their mind and they will walk with it for years and then they can actually get stimulated although they can get excited they can go to the church meetings they can jump up and down I remember one brother oh man he was up on the platform and and they were rejoicing and everything is somebody through a message book and he did it through a message book and it was flying through the air and the sky was rejoicing it land in his hand and oh it took off to the hills I got the message I got the message all of the greatest thing that ever happened his life nowhere to be found he actually was stands the message had because it was something that had come on their intellect and it's something that could come on their mind and as we as I've been thinking about the order of the tabernacle the Devi said one thing I haven't desired is the dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life but David didn't stop there David didn't stop just welling in the house of the Lord because oh you can enter into the tabernacle there you can come in the east and then at the altar he could be in outer courts and there they were doing the just the regular in workings of the tabernacle there with the priests and accepting sacrifice and everything you could come in there it wasn't that limited many people have been in there and seen what it was like and you could look around and you could know what it was like to be there in the inner court but then as you progressed a little further if you went into the holy place all you've gone a little further now you've come into the error that the seven golden candlesticks are the priests will come in there to offer the prayers and there's the table of showbread oh you've come in a little further maybe if you want to look at it like first pull second pool but Davis said one thing have I desired it's a dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life were in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the secret of his Tabernacle you see these people all Miller into God but they they when they cut the the message intellectually when they thought maybe it just on their flesh and and maybe they've gone stimulated oh when the times and the troubles and the hard things come there's not something there to keep them what David said all I want to go into the secret place I want to tell you as the believer if you can move past the intellectual thinking and even move past just a little stimulation on your flashes a little hallelujah praise God revelations 10 seven and you can enter in into that secret place into that Shekinah glory where God reveals himself to you and you come into a union by the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh the seas can rage the students can come ona seem like you're at your wits in and you're going to die but there's an anchor you know you've met God you know you've been on those sacred sands on the backside of the desert that's where God had to take Moses but Moses intellectually we all think men well I see what God's doing flouted Moses on down the Riveter raised him right there in the house of Pharaoh he gots the kingdom and all the armies that is disposal this is just maybe a clean sweep good plan God no no God doesn't need our ability God doesn't need the help of man God said you know what Moses I'm gonna send you on the backside of the desert I'm gonna take out all of your intellect all of your reasoning all your ability so then you're dependent on me and me alone and nobody gets you to that place you know what he tells you I don't need any of your ability and I don't need any of your excuses right now but lord I can't talk I can't talk right I stutter when I talk you know I'm gonna old man look at me I mean my wife she gots a temper I mean what am I gonna go do I've seen the armies down there like I mustn't take somebody else or look I don't need your ability oh that's that what's so wonderful about that message perfect strength the perfect weakness look God doesn't meet our ability and he don't meet your excuses stop making excuses that Gamble is just giving you excuses so you don't manifest who you really are I don't care how many times you've fallen I don't care how many times you've get it up here gone your time capsule he put that word inside of you and he's protecting that seed cream all the way down to the lady Elsie and all the potential that God has placed in that seed it's being loosed in the seventh chart egg to manifest everything that has been spoken of the bride oh praise God Oh Lord oh God you might have your ups and downs you might be down and out you might feel like nothing's going right you might feel that your home life is a wreck you might feel your family life's done you might feel your jobs done that's we go through we go through seasons some longer than others maybe you feel like you've been in a winter season your whole life but as the Lord was clicking in that scripture sin will not have minion over you that is thus saith the Lord sin will not have dominion over you blessed is the man in whom God will not impute sin that's not something you did that's something he said we just believe it and watch the manifestation take over our being glory to God my when you when you realize that you're in possession as our pastor was talking about you are in possession of the promise the promise has been given to you that abstract title deed that our pastor was talking about oh when you get that when you when you have the Holy Ghost let me just read this from the Prophet he says in force then we have the privilege to enforce a plan Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is the law and God in this word made a certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all because the Holy Spirit's there to make him do it look the Holy Spirit is the enforcer you have a right according to the word if if a brother can have this car stolen drove all the way out there for the meetings to be in the means with brother Branham if somebody stole his car they got down on their knees and they prayed and the Holy Spirit went on down the road and convicted the person that stole that color daddy I can't remember he just drove it back to a spot and got out but the car they found the car with just enough gas to get back if God can do that for a vehicle that was stolen he said we have right to save you the demo tonight get it back so what about your joy what about your peace what about the joy of your salvation that the dentist trying to rob you from I say you should say no huh get it back you can't have a devil you that's been worrying about your family and your sons and your daughters that may be seen what way would you say get it back you can't have it I have a divine promise according to the Word of God you just stay right there you keep standing upon the promises for your healing for your loved ones for your family members you say get it back it's mine the scripture says in Ephesians 4 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption glory to God where time capsules Church we're God's time capsule there's two parts to that is word and then the receivers of that word my what a what a glorious thing maybe a simple thought I know we hear it many times but I don't about you but I need to I didn't know who I am cuz I go wandering around out there on a daily and and it can be hard but it's good to be reminded know Lord's telling you I love you you can do it it's alright I know you failed I know you made a mistake but I'm here for you there is therefore now no condemnation and then who are in Jesus Christ so the devil keeps trying to heat that on the reason we have condemnation and that connection because we don't have any confidence in God just please the blood just come back just come back to where you left and that's all you have to do just make the things right plead the blood of Jesus Christ and let's go let's go slay some Giants let's go let's go get back to work as our pastor I'm looking forward to that if Lord will and if he would lead we'll just look for a place to finish here really quick but oh you realize that grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption look that Holy Ghost is there manifesting everything all the potentials that God has placed inside of you look you're an eternal being you know that you're in the tournament you came from God you're going back to God so I don't care the prophet talks about look you can I don't care if you bury me in the scene I don't care if if you burn me at the stake I don't care if I you feed me to the Lions if that spirit if that Satan spirit that was in Jesus Christ dwelling you it will quicken your mortal body I don't care if you're laying at the bottom of the ocean I don't care if you've been burnt at the stake or you've been fed the lives oh one of these glorious mornings you're going to rise you're gonna rise in that great resurrection when the Trump of God sounds and we're all gathered together with him in the air and for us that are alive and remain we will not hinder those that asleep why because there's something that is sealed within these vessels were sealed until the day of our redemption the Prophet says and remember this is out of the rising of the Sun and remember we are flesh of his flesh Jesus Christ we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones oh there's no way out of it we're going to rise that's all you're going to rise Easter means more than just a tradition it also is now it is also now for our bodies are quickened with him and we're sitting in heavenly places and this body may rot in the sea it may rot on the ground there may not be even a spoonful of ashes but she is coming forth for the spirit that raised up my Lord from the dead has quickened this mortal body it's quickened your mortal body and we are Bennett his beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life that I've talked about so much you know no wonder he said fear not for as Paul said death where is your sting grave where is your victory I'm full of quickening power that's be to God who give us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir quickening power oh my he is alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 notice Messiah The Anointed One so is his bride the Messiah see The Anointed One notice death does not stop God's quickening power death can't stop it when you've got it it's eternal there ain't nothing going to stop it well hallelujah the devil can't stop you your mistakes can't stop you nothing can stop that Holy Spirit seal that is upon your life so let's just get back to work and tell that devil he has no right he has no right on these grounds he's taking your joy he's taking her peace he's taking you out of the house of God oh you said get it back John 6:37 says then all the father has given me shall come to me when I read that word today shall it made me think of in my studies we have what they call osha regulations and there's they have suggestions and they have things that are mandatory you know workers on site shall wear a hard hat that's that's not an option if OSHA shows up they will find you a hefty sum for not following the guidelines and as I read that it just struck me you know what all the father have to given me shall come this is the word going forth and it's not going to return them to avoid all those names that are put on the lands book of life all of them are going to come and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out so if you're feeling something tonight you're feeling unworthy you're feeling a little under the weight of the world he's not going to cast you out you just make make your heart right with God and rejoice the musicians would come we'll just look for a place to finish here the Prophet says in Christ the mystery says this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one see the whole thing is God in man one God a man was one there and God and man is one here see what is it being filled with his spirit him having the preeminence that's what's God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be Christ in Christ in us and all of us together one the Holy Spirit he also says in the same sermon he says notice God making himself known we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government this is in a group revelation we don't get we don't sit down and compare notes and say well I think this is how the first seal in that second seal unfolded and and that sounds good to me that sound good to you okay if you don't understand something keep praying for revelation don't you don't have to you don't have to try to come up with some explanation to so you feel better about it look there's things that I know that you could come up and ask me and maybe I feel a little embarrassed I say you know what brother honestly I don't know I just know what he said but I'm still praying for more revelation but I recognize what God's done in this day and I'm so thankful for says but my revelation that Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you what God did in Christ Christ designate what songs did in Christ what science did God in Christ Christ doesn't you ask are we happy that we've just come into the outer courts of the tabernacle are we happy that maybe we've gone into the holy place I'll say no lord I want to go all the way into the holiest of holies jesus said of that game that's this day at that day when the revelation has made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I and you and me when the revelation has made manifest that day you shall know that I am in the father are one I am in the father and the father in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's I and you and you and me man I felt like this then when the revelation comes forth and it's eyeing you and you and me personal to you you need that revelation to you personally it is a Lord I believe it Lord reveal it manifest I say Oh God grant us a greater revelation of your word look Paul knew Jesus Christ by what by revelation how did Peter know by revelation Peter could have said I touched him I've handed them the Word of Life I've seen him with my eyes I meet with him I fished with him but when Jesus turned to him and said Peter write Church who do you say that I am he wasn't speaking to the multitudes he wasn't speaking to the seventy he was speaking to the twelve knowing even one of them was a deadly sin Peter who do you say that I am he said thou art the Christ the Son of God and Jesus said flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my heavenly father which is in heaven I reveal this to you the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it see was by revelation it has to be revelation just like the disciples after his resurrection think of think of the discouragement that these disciples were going through everything that they were believing for here they believed that this was the Messiah he was going to restore the kingdom and all of a sudden just like that he's taken from him and he's crucified he's been laid away a tomb they had left jobs they have left families they have left everything and they were following Jesus Christ the Messiah and what was Jesus Christ doing he was fulfilling his word and so he enrolls on that third day oh what a glorious time he had condemned sin in the flesh and now he had risen the mighty conquer that risen Oliveri comes to the disciples on the road to Emmaus and they're discouraged though the sun's here the world has resurrected and now he comes to his children there and they're discouraged and he starts to tell them fools and slow of heart to recognize the word and all the things that must have been fulfilled pertaining to the life of Christ see they were still lacking they were still needing further revelation there is still further unfolding there was a change in dispensation that had taken place even when you think about the disciples when they went fishing Lord had already appeared to him two times but here he comes on the bags that you can't anything no no I'm just throwing out on the other side all right you see maybe they would say like I've heard of that before but it wasn't until that net was filled up with fish that they realized that something was familiar and that's when something transpired that's when something clicked and the scripture says all Peter he guard himself and jumped in the water and swam all the way to shore and the scripture says they came up and gathered around yet some fish on the fire it says and the disciples Durst not ask him who it was because they knew it was Jesus why because he was failed their eyes were withholding him they couldn't recognize him in this unfolding of the word and all I've been just rejoicing on here Mary being up the tomb she'd come there to the tomb and the Lord has risen he's there he's talking to Mary and Mary all she's saying oh you tell me where his body is tell me where his body is this is all woman to sir if you're just having little does she know she's speaking to her heart [Music] but she's lacking a little revelation she's she's lacking a battle being taken away from her eyes but when Jesus is married when the Lord called her name the man was taken away don't you realize the true name is in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was feeling of my seven fields but the Lamb he had done me an accessory work and he's now he's come forth and he took the book and he's open the book and the part that said your name was in there and it was a little sing of your name you realized this message is calling your name and it's taking the valet and you're beholding the Lord Jesus Christ and our day let's tan [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] what a wonderful word it's not gonna happen because we want to make it happen it's gonna happen because that's what he promised for this time hey man I thought love even at the very end as you were speaking of the disciples on the road to Emmaus the promise had already been fulfilled it was done it was all done all that he took was just so we could catch up with our revelation and I could say this tonight I believe everything that God promised will come the past rapture is going to happen we just need to catch up in Revelation we just need him to open our eyes a little more and open it a little more so we can see it it is going to happen not because we want it because he said it's gonna happen crystal tonight while the wonderful God he is we're so thankful that spirit of God what you're worried by [Music] I lift my hands and surrender laying all on the altar I don't want to pretend right be still by your head I'll take you and I hide it in my heart today [Music] [Applause] [Music] her natural poise and I am help me [Music] if you just come in dismissed [Music] amen let's pray together give thanks Heavenly Father Lord we just want to thank you Lord Jesus for meeting with us tonight for coming and expressing your heart to us Lord [Music] time capsules God just having the very word failed within us to be revealed at that in our season of God and this is the season father you've come forth now and prove that to us mortem we just want to give you thanks Lord Jesus father God we just disregard who we think we are now on that Lord and we accept who you say we are in Christ Jesus and how you made us Lord that we would receive this message Lord we accept that father God we accept your sacrifice or God we love you Lord father God we just honor your word father by believing in it Lord and we are an anticipation of you fulfilling those promises and lies to us as individuals god

and your precious and holy [Music] when a walk some [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
