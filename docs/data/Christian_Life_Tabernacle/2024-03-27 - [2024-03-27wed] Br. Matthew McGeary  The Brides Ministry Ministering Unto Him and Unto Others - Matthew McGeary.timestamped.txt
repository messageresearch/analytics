[41:36] fulfilled in the hour uh that we are now
[41:39] living Christ and the bride becoming one
[41:41] an invisible Union if you'll turn to
[41:43] John chapter 20 we'd like to read from
[41:46] there as
[41:50] well there might not be no natural water
[41:53] in this
[41:55] building but I'm not so much interested
[41:58] in those things of the natural but the
[42:00] spiritual and his his presence is here
[42:03] he's moving amongst us I'm so thankful
[42:05] for that in John uh chapter 20 we're
[42:08] just going to read a few verses here 21-
[42:16] 23 then said Jesus to them again peace
[42:19] be unto you as my father hath sent
[42:23] me even so I even so send I you just
[42:28] notice that now as the father sent him
[42:31] he's going to send you the same
[42:34] way so peace be unto you as the father
[42:37] hath sent me even so send I you and when
[42:40] he had said this he breathed on them and
[42:43] saith unto them receive ye the Holy
[42:45] Ghost whosoever sins ye remit they are
[42:49] remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye
[42:52] retain they are retained amen we just
[42:55] pray a blessing on the word you may be
[42:56] seated
[43:04] as the f as my father has sent me even
[43:07] so I send you and then he goes on to say
[43:11] receive ye the Holy Ghost and I just
[43:13] want to bring your attention to a
[43:14] portion of scripture in Luke uh chap 4
[43:18] and verse 18 now as Jesus is now coming
[43:21] to fulfill his ministry he comes into
[43:24] the temple and there's a book that is
[43:26] handed unto him and he's going going to
[43:27] start take the book and he's now SP to
[43:30] declare he's going to turn into the word
[43:32] he's going to find his identification
[43:34] he's going to find his ministry in the
[43:36] word he's going to open it and he's
[43:38] going to say the spirit of the Lord is
[43:40] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[43:43] preach the gospel to the poor he hath
[43:46] sent me notice that he hath sent me so
[43:49] the same way come on now the same way
[43:52] the father sent him he said I'm going to
[43:54] send you and now he's making a DEC ation
[43:57] here he's taking the book he's opening
[43:59] up the book and he's saying the spirit
[44:01] of the Lord is upon me so if the spirit
[44:03] of the Lord was upon him the spirit of
[44:05] the Lord is going to be upon you because
[44:07] he hath anointed me to preach the gospel
[44:10] to the poor he hath sent me to heal the
[44:12] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[44:14] the captives and the recovering of the
[44:16] sight to the blind I want to say his
[44:17] ministry has not stopped he's still
[44:19] doing the same thing today he's still
[44:22] preaching the word he's still healing he
[44:24] that has sent me to heal the
[44:25] brokenhearted to preach to Deliverance
[44:27] to the captives recovering of sight to
[44:29] the blind to set Liberty to them that
[44:31] are bruised I wasn't going to try to
[44:32] start this fast but it just happens to
[44:34] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[44:36] and he closed the
[44:38] book and he gave it again to the
[44:40] minister and sat down in the eyes of all
[44:42] them that were in the synagogue were
[44:44] fastened on
[44:46] him you know your your attention kind of
[44:49] catches that ER where he he takes the
[44:51] book he opens the book and now he's
[44:53] declaring the manifestation of the word
[44:55] telling everybody look this day this
[44:57] scripture is fulfilled and then he
[44:59] closed the book I I'm so glad that the
[45:01] same one has come again but not with a
[45:03] closed book come
[45:05] on but he's come with an open book he's
[45:09] come revealing the seals and the
[45:11] Mysteries and just wanting to bring your
[45:13] attention he said the same way he sent
[45:18] me it's the same way I send you so I
[45:23] just been feeding on the Easter seal the
[45:25] prophet of God would say
[45:27] his uh Messianic anointed ones believe
[45:30] that I believe he's referring to he's
[45:31] the same yesterday today and forever he
[45:33] goes what is the Messiah what is the
[45:36] messiah messiah is Anointed one and now
[45:39] if he was the Messiah by being the
[45:42] anointed one for that day to fulfill the
[45:45] word of God to be the Redeemer and the
[45:47] anointed one and God raised up that body
[45:51] his bride is the anointed one for this
[45:54] day it's already raised with am in the
[45:57] resurrection because these two are one
[46:01] the resurrection we are now in the
[46:04] resurrection we are setting with him in
[46:06] the resurrection but only those who have
[46:08] life oh I wonder do you have life
[46:11] tonight if you don't have life I say
[46:13] come to the Fountain oh it's flowing
[46:16] rich and free that you can be born again
[46:18] that you can be delivered that you don't
[46:20] have to be stooped in darkness and death
[46:22] and all these things but you can have
[46:23] that same Life coming to you amen yes so
[46:28] now just just moving to build a thought
[46:30] here notice how he says his bride is the
[46:32] anointed one for this
[46:35] day if he was the anointed one of that
[46:37] day to fulfill the
[46:39] scripture he now has anointed ones for
[46:41] this
[46:42] day to fulfill the
[46:45] scripture now I want to just labor on
[46:47] this for a little bit uh tonight and uh
[46:50] the prophet of God would say he did not
[46:52] complete all his work while in his
[46:55] Earthly Ministry
[46:58] so now he works in and through the
[47:01] bride she knows that for it was not yet
[47:04] time for him to do certain things that
[47:06] he must now do but he will now fulfill
[47:08] through the bride the work which he left
[47:11] for this specific
[47:15] time catch what the prophet is saying
[47:18] that when he came here first time in his
[47:21] Earthly Ministry there was things he did
[47:23] not fulfill then but now there are
[47:26] things that have been left for this
[47:28] specific time that he's now fulfilling
[47:30] through the bride that he had a Ministry
[47:33] when he first came and he has a Ministry
[47:35] now that he is now fulfilling through
[47:37] the bride of Christ I'd like to speak to
[47:40] you a little bit on the bride's
[47:43] Ministry and maybe as a subject
[47:46] ministering unto him and unto
[47:49] others and and we could you know
[47:51] something that just deeply moved upon my
[47:53] heart over the last couple weeks was in
[47:56] that ministering to him and un to others
[47:58] just just think of the love of God there
[48:00] loving him and loving others because
[48:02] without the love of God it profiteth us
[48:04] nothing so uh just building a thought
[48:06] here and launching out the prophet of
[48:08] God would say in proof of his
[48:09] resurrection he'd say and man in his own
[48:11] mental way of thinking is wrong to begin
[48:14] with he is an alien from God he is cut
[48:17] off without hope without god without
[48:19] mercy and the only thing that he can do
[48:22] is come and accept Christ and then the
[48:25] Holy Spirit comes in and the that was in
[48:27] Christ is in you Jesus said the father
[48:30] that sent me is with me oh my what a
[48:32] declaration what a word the father that
[48:35] sent me come with me listen and as the
[48:38] father sent me so do I send you he don't
[48:42] only send
[48:45] you but he goes with you that makes me
[48:50] happy he didn't just say hey there's a
[48:52] big army out there and there's ladyo and
[48:54] it's just darkness all around I'm just
[48:56] going to
[48:57] go on out there and see if you can pass
[48:59] the test he said no I'm sending you out
[49:01] there but I'm not only sending you but
[49:03] I'm going with you I'll be with you even
[49:06] in you until the end of the world all
[49:08] that was in God was poured out into
[49:10] Christ and all that was in Christ was
[49:12] emptied out into the believer the church
[49:14] God is with you well maybe somebody here
[49:19] feels you feel a little bit lonely you
[49:21] feel like you're fighting all alone and
[49:23] you feel like you're you you just
[49:24] nobody's there to help you I want to
[49:25] tell you you're not alone
[49:28] tonight the same one that called you the
[49:30] same one that sent you the same one is
[49:32] with you yes lo I am with thee always
[49:36] even to the end of the world that's the
[49:38] Declaration of God's word that's what
[49:40] the Bible says that's what I
[49:44] believe oh what a
[49:47] declaration what a declaration just
[49:50] think in the beginning was the word and
[49:52] the Word was with God and the Word was
[49:56] made flesh and dwelt among
[49:58] us but who hath declared him the only
[50:02] begotten of the father he has declared
[50:05] him and if he declared him in his first
[50:07] Ministry there is a bride now upon the
[50:09] face of the earth that is declaring that
[50:12] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[50:14] and forever look no no man has seen God
[50:17] at any time but as Christ Jesus has
[50:20] declared him he is now living in a many
[50:22] membered body bride of Jesus Christ with
[50:25] a Ministry fulfilling those scriptures
[50:27] which was left for the end time for you
[50:29] to fulfill and now that Ministry is
[50:31] working through you come on you might as
[50:33] well accept
[50:36] it
[50:38] you take ownership
[50:40] tonight you're not here to fulfill a a
[50:43] natural career you have a spiritual
[50:46] career you're here for a purpose you're
[50:48] an attribute of God that he is expressed
[50:51] in the end time that you would fulfill
[50:53] the word of God the prophet of God said
[50:55] if you are born of him and you're filled
[50:57] of
[50:59] him and then he gives this example of
[51:02] like a tree if you take the life out of
[51:05] an apple tree and you put it into a pear
[51:07] tree and he's starting to say look if
[51:09] you've been born again and filled with
[51:11] the Holy Spirit then the same life that
[51:12] was in Jesus Christ is now in
[51:15] you if the life of Beethoven is in you
[51:19] prove
[51:20] it you'll find out real quick I don't
[51:23] have the life of Beethoven in me I can't
[51:25] think like them I can't play like them I
[51:28] I I couldn't even act like
[51:31] them but if the life was in me now I
[51:35] would be able to sit down and
[51:37] demonstrate to you that the same life
[51:40] that was in Beethoven is in me and then
[51:42] my actions and my Works would
[51:44] demonstrate to you that I know what I'm
[51:46] talking about I wish I could start
[51:49] naming things that he you
[51:51] know whatever composed and all that and
[51:54] and start to play all these Symphonies
[51:56] and things and and then you would sit
[51:58] around like my I mean maybe this is
[52:00] Beethoven
[52:02] reincarnated can you hear how he's
[52:04] hitting that just right he's he's
[52:05] hitting every note I want to say this
[52:07] bride of Christ is going to hit every
[52:09] note you might not feel like your life
[52:12] is hitting every note you might not feel
[52:14] like your life is in harmony but I want
[52:16] to say there's a prophetic word that has
[52:18] been spoken out over your life you might
[52:20] not be hitting all the notes right now
[52:22] but in God's economy you're going to hit
[52:24] every right note because he's the great
[52:27] composer he has it all in his control
[52:30] and he elected you and he predestinated
[52:32] you that you would come into the image
[52:35] of perfection in the hour that we are
[52:37] now living that this word would take on
[52:39] flesh and the bride of Christ would be
[52:41] the very Ministry the same Ministry that
[52:44] was on the earth in his first coming is
[52:46] now here once again during his second
[52:48] coming oh that makes me happy yes
[52:53] sir then all of our actions if he
[52:57] declared him then all of our actions
[53:00] should declare him all that was in God
[53:03] he poured into Christ and all that was
[53:05] in Christ he poured into the believer
[53:08] amen now I like this scripture here in
[53:10] John 1:12 it says but as many as
[53:12] received
[53:14] him to them gave he power to become the
[53:17] sons of God even to them that believe on
[53:21] his name now just notice that saying
[53:23] there power to
[53:25] become so then all of the potential is
[53:28] laying there the prophet of God as we've
[53:30] gone through God's transforming power
[53:32] said God put the seed in there with the
[53:34] potential that it would be what he said
[53:37] it would
[53:39] be names that are written on the Lamb's
[53:42] Book of
[53:44] Life all of the potential is there the
[53:48] power to
[53:49] become so then when you're looking at
[53:51] the seed maybe it's not that big great
[53:54] apple tree with its with with it
[53:56] branches spreading out there and
[53:57] providing shelter and fruit and all this
[54:00] but in that seed there is the power to
[54:03] become right so I don't know where
[54:06] you're at in the stage of the journey
[54:08] but I want to say my sheep hear my voice
[54:11] and if God has given you an ear to hear
[54:14] what the spirit is saying to the church
[54:16] Hallelujah then there is power for you
[54:18] to become what he has spoken of you oh
[54:21] nothing can stop
[54:23] it you might as well start rejoicing
[54:28] I mean you you might as well be like a
[54:30] somebody at the starting line in a race
[54:32] and just tell everybody else hey sorry
[54:34] about
[54:35] it sorry about it I'm going to win this
[54:38] thing all the demons are trying to say
[54:41] I'm bigger I'm stronger I've seen so
[54:44] many like you before but you don't
[54:46] understand I got power to become I got
[54:49] power to finish this race I got power to
[54:51] manifest what he spoke of me not in
[54:53] myself but he's the one that spoke it
[54:55] right
[54:56] right let that seed get in the right
[55:00] atmosphere ain't nothing here to stop
[55:02] it you can pour a foundation and you
[55:05] just let the atmosphere just get right
[55:07] and all of a sudden that little seed
[55:08] will say hey I'm watch out I'm coming up
[55:12] you can bury a little Lily Pond thing
[55:14] way down there in the muck and mire way
[55:16] down there where it just seems darkness
[55:18] and filth and no good thing could come
[55:20] out of there but let the atmosphere just
[55:22] get right let the light start calling
[55:23] say come unto me come unto me all ye who
[55:26] for a heavy laden and I will give you
[55:28] rest oh he give you an ear to hear the
[55:30] word if you say Lord I believe you Lord
[55:32] I believe you and all a sudden
[55:33] something's being germinated something's
[55:35] coming to life something's springing
[55:38] forth because there's power in that seed
[55:41] to become what God said it would
[55:45] be the seed has power in
[55:48] itself my the power of
[55:53] transformation power to become exal ly
[55:56] what the word said it would
[55:59] be now I know when you listen to the
[56:02] prophet and he speaks the words
[56:04] concerning the bride something in your
[56:06] heart says
[56:08] amen amen I believe it Lord I believe
[56:12] that you'll have a bride without spot
[56:14] without wrinkle a virtuous bride that
[56:16] can do all things that you shall do the
[56:18] Greater
[56:20] Works well go ahead and start pointing
[56:22] to yourself he's talking about me like
[56:25] the boy in the here you know looking him
[56:28] like man what is that thing over there
[56:31] and then finally he said Mama that's
[56:33] me you have to look into the pages of
[56:35] the Bible and look into the message you
[56:37] got to say mama that's me he's talking
[56:40] about me when you're on that the ra
[56:43] ready to start that race and maybe
[56:45] before they start the race look now the
[56:47] the one that's going to finish is going
[56:49] to be the bride without spot or wrinkle
[56:52] he's talking about
[56:53] me they have eternal life they've always
[56:56] had Eternal hey he's talking about me
[56:58] yes there's no way for them to miss it
[57:01] they were predestinated before the
[57:03] foundation of the world they will
[57:05] ordained to Good Works they shall do the
[57:07] Greater Works hey you hear that he's
[57:09] talking about
[57:12] me but you know the devil's always right
[57:15] there wanting to point to everything
[57:16] else there's somebody else go there oh
[57:19] you made a last race you tripped up you
[57:20] fell you don't have the strength you
[57:23] you've tried over and over and over well
[57:25] who you listen listening to this
[57:27] tonight let's not listen to what the
[57:29] devil's saying not let's not listen to
[57:31] what the pastors is saying but let's
[57:32] listen to what the Lord is
[57:35] saying look light brings
[57:38] Life Light brings life and then if
[57:41] there's power to
[57:43] become the light of this message of the
[57:45] hour will bring forth the life that's in
[57:48] the
[57:50] seed you got to feed on it you got to
[57:52] lay in the presence of the sun if you
[57:56] feel like you're faltering and you're
[57:57] not uhh uh becoming fruitful like you
[57:59] would want to see the message of the
[58:01] hour be in your life you got to you got
[58:03] to make sure you've repented that you've
[58:05] been baptized that you're believing for
[58:07] the holy ghost that you're feeding on
[58:08] the word of God and you're saying like
[58:10] Mary said be it unto me according to Thy
[58:12] word Lord I want to manifest these
[58:14] things I want to see this word in
[58:16] manifestation in my life because as we
[58:19] walk in the light as he is in the
[58:22] light we have Fellowship one with
[58:25] another in the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:26] cleanses us from all of our sins so just
[58:29] uh laboring to lay a foundation brother
[58:31] Brandon would say this and Jesus keeps
[58:33] all of his appointments he would say
[58:35] that's the way God has brought his
[58:37] church from justification and
[58:39] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[58:41] Spirit and now the ministry of the
[58:43] spirit which is what quickens the word
[58:46] that Ministry in the church will have to
[58:48] be just exactly like
[58:52] his just like this when my shadow here
[58:55] of my hand if I never seen my hand seen
[58:58] the shadow it kind of gets pale and gets
[59:00] away but as it gets closer and
[59:03] closer the negative and the positive are
[59:07] coming together until they both become
[59:11] the same
[59:12] thing now he's using a a a easy example
[59:16] to show exactly what is happening with
[59:19] you and the
[59:21] Capstone he's using an example to show
[59:24] exactly what's happening between you and
[59:26] the
[59:27] Capstone that you and the Capstone are
[59:29] coming so close together that you are
[59:32] becoming the same thing now that might
[59:35] sound like tall orders I'm sorry about
[59:37] it but it's just what he said you were
[59:39] and he said I've given you power to
[59:41] become what I've spoken and now this
[59:43] bride is coming into a union with this
[59:45] revealed word of the hour exactly when

[1:01:32] so on track on the things in the
[1:01:36] natural you you get these these athletes
[1:01:39] and things man their their diet is so
[1:01:41] dialed in they know every gram and every
[1:01:44] ounce and and they have dieticians and
[1:01:47] and and they got people that babysit
[1:01:49] them and they flying chefs to cook their
[1:01:51] meal and they know it's like a machine
[1:01:53] man they know every little gram of every
[1:01:55] little thing that they're putting into
[1:01:57] that body because they want to get the
[1:01:58] best results out of their
[1:02:01] investment I mean think about it some of
[1:02:03] these guys are signing now 200 million
[1:02:05] $500 million
[1:02:07] contracts to play a
[1:02:12] game
[1:02:15] amazing I think that's
[1:02:19] amazing and the whole world looks at
[1:02:21] that say my wouldn't that be something
[1:02:23] you start doing the math on side with
[1:02:25] one time we did it I think some guy gets
[1:02:27] paid like it's something crazy I like
[1:02:31] $100,000 each game he plays and you boil
[1:02:35] it down he gets $50,000 in a bat he goes
[1:02:37] up there and swings a stick three times
[1:02:40] thank you for your service here's
[1:02:45] $50,000 but if you watch their regiment
[1:02:47] and their routine of what it took to get
[1:02:49] to that place right the amount of
[1:02:53] discipline and everything that they put
[1:02:55] into that and I wonder what about us who
[1:02:57] God has ordained and predestinated here
[1:03:00] to fulfill all the scripture that has
[1:03:02] been left for the bride to fulfill do we
[1:03:05] wake up or are we just being so easily
[1:03:07] deterred look at this and look at that
[1:03:09] and watch this and and some guy wink at
[1:03:11] you this way or that way and you're so
[1:03:13] moved and oh he likes me and so you're
[1:03:14] you're doing all your little post back
[1:03:16] to him and getting the right filters and
[1:03:17] everything and puckering up your lips
[1:03:19] because you you want him to like
[1:03:21] you is that what's is that what you is
[1:03:23] that what life is about is is that what
[1:03:26] what you're living for no you're living
[1:03:27] to be pleasing un and that's what I want
[1:03:29] to preach to you a little bit tonight is
[1:03:30] about ministering unto him because
[1:03:33] before we can minister to others we must
[1:03:35] be able to minister unto him you got to
[1:03:39] be in a relationship with him you got to
[1:03:41] be in a Oneness with him it got to be
[1:03:43] husband and wife living together
[1:03:45] bringing forth fruit of the word because
[1:03:47] then and only then when you come into
[1:03:49] that Union then can can you begin to
[1:03:51] minister to others but until that time
[1:03:55] it's kind of like
[1:03:57] hearsay like that story one time when I
[1:04:00] believe the you know the boy was out
[1:04:02] there waving the flag and he come home I
[1:04:05] believe it was the queen and uh he got
[1:04:07] back oh honey did you see the uh did you
[1:04:09] see the queen yeah I saw what's wrong
[1:04:13] that's that's why we went
[1:04:15] there is so that you can see the parade
[1:04:18] and you could see the queen why are you
[1:04:19] crying he's like I saw the queen well
[1:04:21] what's wrong the queen didn't see
[1:04:24] me

[1:06:31] others all I've been interested is what
[1:06:33] you could do for me I've really never
[1:06:35] been interested in what I could do for
[1:06:37] you Lord forgive me I I've just been
[1:06:40] piggybacking I've just been a squatter
[1:06:42] on your grace I've just been taken
[1:06:44] advantage of you oh a lot of people do
[1:06:47] it a lot of people take advantage of our
[1:06:53] savior there's promises laying in the
[1:06:55] word there's some people that that that
[1:06:57] pay ties and do they don't even go to
[1:06:58] church they just pay ties because they
[1:07:00] know if they do it there's a blessing in
[1:07:02] it and then there's ones of us that sit
[1:07:04] right here in the house of God and we
[1:07:05] don't even pay
[1:07:08] 10% we we pay our bills first and then
[1:07:10] we get down the line and then we we give
[1:07:12] them an
[1:07:13] IOU well it's a new year I mean Lord
[1:07:16] forgive me for last year that ain't no
[1:07:19] way to
[1:07:19] live ain't no way to
[1:07:23] live but when you're in a union with him
[1:07:26] and you can come to him in reverence and
[1:07:28] sincerity say
[1:07:29] Lord I love you thank you for Calvary
[1:07:34] thank you for what you're doing
[1:07:36] Lord what can I do for
[1:07:39] you now you're starting to minister unto
[1:07:43] him just trying
[1:07:45] to progress here a little
[1:07:50] bit just to still laying this Foundation
[1:07:53] here as the prophet would say and
[1:07:55] question and answers on the seals would
[1:07:57] the bride of Christ have a Ministry
[1:07:59] before the
[1:08:01] Rapture sure that's what's going on
[1:08:03] right now see the bride of Christ
[1:08:05] certainly it's the message of the hour
[1:08:08] see the bride of Christ sure she
[1:08:10] consists of Apostles and Prophets and
[1:08:12] teachers evangelists and pastors is that
[1:08:14] right that's the bride of Christ sure
[1:08:16] she's got a Ministry a great ministry
[1:08:20] the ministry of the hour it'll be so
[1:08:23] humble amen there it
[1:08:27] is this ministry of this hour in the
[1:08:32] bride of Christ it will be so
[1:08:36] humble not some big public display not
[1:08:40] some big great denominational move but
[1:08:43] what did he say in this third poll he
[1:08:44] said I will meet you in
[1:08:47] there th this is an invisible Union
[1:08:49] where Christ and the bride are becoming
[1:08:53] one they're becoming the same thing and
[1:08:57] this ministry will be so humble that it
[1:08:59] would be veiled in a people like this
[1:09:01] gathered together in Bedford Texas on a
[1:09:03] Wednesday night not some big something
[1:09:07] fantastic out there but but in the
[1:09:09] simple common people that love this
[1:09:12] message and believe it with all of their
[1:09:14] heart that is where this ministry is
[1:09:16] being manifested is in each one of you
[1:09:19] and now the question is is do you want
[1:09:21] that Ministry to come to its fullness in
[1:09:24] your life
[1:09:26] not
[1:09:28] parttime not just on Sunday or
[1:09:33] Wednesday but every hour yes of every
[1:09:37] day your life is a Ministry unto
[1:09:41] him and unto others and it would be so
[1:09:45] humble and I love how the prophet of God
[1:09:47] would start see sir that's what's going
[1:09:49] on and certainly it's the message of the
[1:09:51] hour the bride of Christ sure it
[1:09:52] consists of Apostles and Prophets and
[1:09:54] teachers evangelists and pastors is
[1:09:55] right that's the bride of Christ she's
[1:09:58] got a great ministry the great ministry
[1:10:00] of the hour I love how the prophet of
[1:10:02] God starts to tap into Ephesians 4 and
[1:10:05] he's starting to talk about the
[1:10:06] five-fold ministry and and pastors and
[1:10:08] teachers and evangels what are those
[1:10:10] given for it's for the edifying and the
[1:10:12] perfecting of the
[1:10:13] saints that we would come into that
[1:10:15] unity and that Harmony he would go on to
[1:10:17] say speaking the truth and
[1:10:20] love oh if we're going to have a
[1:10:23] Ministry I say there's a a lot of people
[1:10:25] out there that speak truth but they lack
[1:10:32] love a lot of people out there uh
[1:10:35] preaching the message of the
[1:10:37] hour and some of them do it like a
[1:10:43] boast they're they're
[1:10:45] boasting but I just love how this
[1:10:48] message was
[1:10:50] brought as the father sent me so I send
[1:10:52] you you see the reverence you see the
[1:10:54] humility you say you see how it was
[1:10:57] brought in love oh but don't don't
[1:10:59] mistake that that reverence and humility
[1:11:00] for weakness cuz that was the greatest
[1:11:03] Force this world had ever seen is the
[1:11:05] love of God and that's what we want to
[1:11:07] come into is that love yes that
[1:11:11] love to where we're coming into a Unity
[1:11:13] with with Christ which is love like the
[1:11:15] scripture would say in 1 John 4:16 he
[1:11:18] would say and we know and we have known
[1:11:21] and believed that the love of God ha to
[1:11:23] us God is love and he that dwelleth in
[1:11:27] love dwelleth in God and God in him
[1:11:32] there's the secret there's the humility
[1:11:35] there's the ministry it's dwelling in
[1:11:39] love
[1:11:41] love since when did we
[1:11:43] ever get to where all of our doctrines
[1:11:47] and all of our know how is our
[1:11:50] boast and we've left we've left off the
[1:11:53] very life the very character of the
[1:11:56] message in which way it was
[1:11:58] brought where we got to lie we got to
[1:12:00] correct everybody else we got to show
[1:12:02] everybody else where they're wrong and
[1:12:03] this church over here and that church
[1:12:04] over there and well you know this
[1:12:06] preacher preached that so I'm going to
[1:12:07] preach this to bring them into B are you
[1:12:09] kidding
[1:12:10] me there's one voice to this
[1:12:13] age and you will be the final voice to
[1:12:16] this age under yes sir that
[1:12:20] voice but if you ain't under that voice
[1:12:22] it's just a bunch of voices and it's
[1:12:24] just a bunch of conf conf usion right we
[1:12:27] might as just go back to the Tower of
[1:12:30] Babel he said he said he said but he
[1:12:32] said he said he said we want to come to
[1:12:34] a place where we're speaking the truth
[1:12:38] in love as a prophet of God would say if
[1:12:40] you dwell in love you dwell in God for
[1:12:43] God is love they that dwell in God dwell
[1:12:46] in love see and love has no hatred love
[1:12:49] is not jealous love is not puffed up
[1:12:53] love did not beh misbehave itself love
[1:12:55] is always gentle sweet forgiving
[1:12:59] kind oh now we're learning how to speak
[1:13:01] the truth in Love no matter how bitter
[1:13:04] the others is Love Remains itself love
[1:13:07] is the ultimate of Grace love is
[1:13:11] God's ultimately for us after all other
[1:13:14] gifts and things has vanished our
[1:13:16] prophecies our tongues our
[1:13:17] interpretations all we've ever done and
[1:13:20] what more When Love Comes in it's the
[1:13:22] ultimate it's above all it because all
[1:13:24] of others will fail it's the Supreme
[1:13:27] Court's
[1:13:30] decision
[1:13:32] Hallelujah I like
[1:13:35] that I like the Supreme Court's
[1:13:38] decision his Supreme
[1:13:42] oh turn the picture to the right who is
[1:13:45] that up there it's the Supreme judge
[1:13:48] decision yes sir Hallelujah
[1:13:52] Justified who me who says it's the
[1:13:56] Supreme judge's
[1:14:02] decision what is the
[1:14:04] decision what produced that decision
[1:14:08] love
[1:14:10] love as the scripture would say in
[1:14:12] Ephesian this great love wherein he has
[1:14:15] loved
[1:14:16] us oh
[1:14:18] my have we have have we become so puffed
[1:14:21] up so educated and so Mesi that we don't
[1:14:24] have no
[1:14:27] love just because another group doesn't
[1:14:29] believe it the way we do they're they're
[1:14:34] off just because oh my
[1:14:39] friends if we ever get to that place
[1:14:42] we've missed it we've totally missed
[1:14:45] it remember the story about the prophet
[1:14:48] one day is he was going into the
[1:14:50] diner and he slipped in there and he saw
[1:14:53] the woman carrying on with that police
[1:14:55] officer and he thought my Lord how can
[1:14:57] you tolerate
[1:14:59] this I mean this such filth everywhere
[1:15:03] why don't you just wipe it off the face
[1:15:04] of the Earth and he kind of felt that
[1:15:07] feeling come by and he thought maybe I
[1:15:09] just kind of step off here for a moment
[1:15:11] and all of a sudden he seen that Vision
[1:15:13] Break Forth and he saw like a bumper of
[1:15:16] blood going around the
[1:15:19] world and he saw his sins coming up and
[1:15:22] and before it could reach Heaven's
[1:15:23] throne there was a bumper of blood that
[1:15:26] was protecting it from ever reaching to
[1:15:28] the throne and he said and then I seen a
[1:15:31] little book there I kind of climbed up
[1:15:33] and I saw a little book there that said
[1:15:35] uh HH brother brandom and it said I
[1:15:38] noticed it was all of my sins in there
[1:15:42] and there he was standing there he was
[1:15:43] bleeding and he was bloody and he was he
[1:15:46] was gasping for air and he he looked at
[1:15:49] that book and he looked at the Lord he
[1:15:50] said Lord I'm sorry I did that to you
[1:15:53] will you forgive me
[1:15:56] and he stuck his hand into his side and
[1:15:59] he pulled his hand out and he wrote on
[1:16:00] there
[1:16:01] pardoned and he threw it in God's sea of
[1:16:06] forgetfulness and then he said I forgave
[1:16:09] you and you want to condemn
[1:16:13] then he said oh I I seen where I was
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] then it changed my
[1:16:23] attitude see it brought brought them
[1:16:25] back into the right channel you got to
[1:16:28] stay in the right
[1:16:29] channel right that what the prophet has
[1:16:31] said you have all the potentials but if
[1:16:33] you got to stay in the right channel you
[1:16:35] got to stay in the channel of the word
[1:16:38] you got to stay under the leading of the
[1:16:40] holy spirit because it can be so easy
[1:16:42] for you to get out of your place where
[1:16:43] all of a sudden you're looking at
[1:16:44] something and you're judging it and in
[1:16:46] you wanting to judge it God's wanting to
[1:16:48] bring
[1:16:49] Grace and now that the prophet was
[1:16:52] channeled right he walks in there and
[1:16:54] walks up
[1:16:58] where is the love of
[1:17:02] God how many of you ever walked up to a
[1:17:06] stranger and wanted to tell them God
[1:17:09] loves
[1:17:10] you see something compelled him to do it
[1:17:14] there was Christ was there to say look
[1:17:16] you you can't look at him that
[1:17:18] way let me get you channeled right and
[1:17:21] then now in the right channel he walks
[1:17:23] in there says excuse me ma'am can I sit
[1:17:25] down oh well now that seat's t oh I
[1:17:26] understand I I I'm not I just I wanted
[1:17:29] to share something with you and he
[1:17:30] begins to tell her I was over there
[1:17:32] judging you but but God come
[1:17:34] down and has shown Grace and he led her
[1:17:38] to the
[1:17:40] Lord there's the
[1:17:43] ministry he would be so humble that it
[1:17:46] could be in a restaurant
[1:17:47] diner he would be so humble that it
[1:17:50] would be on the job force or it' be in
[1:17:51] your school it would be in the cafeteria
[1:17:53] it'd be at a gas it would be be
[1:17:55] somewhere where you're not walking
[1:17:57] around with
[1:17:59] judgment but you're walking around in

[1:19:38] projected what
[1:19:41] happens Sovereign Grace takes over when
[1:19:45] he came into the restaurant what was he
[1:19:46] first doing projecting judgment that's
[1:19:49] right but When Love Was projected yes
[1:19:53] sir Sovereign Grace took
[1:19:57] over you are missg
[1:20:00] Grace you are the love of God expressed
[1:20:03] to a dying
[1:20:07] generation where are people going to
[1:20:09] find
[1:20:11] it I love this story we had some
[1:20:13] fellowship on this story
[1:20:16] here about a week ago of that brother
[1:20:19] brandom going hunting with bertke and
[1:20:22] he's up there on that hunt and and and
[1:20:25] all of a sudden they're taking a little
[1:20:27] break there I think they're eating some
[1:20:28] sandwiches or something and Bert pulls
[1:20:29] out that little deer call that's going
[1:20:33] to imitate a baby
[1:20:36] deer to call a mommy out from hiding
[1:20:39] that he could shoot it and brother
[1:20:42] bandam looks at Bert says oh Bert you
[1:20:43] wouldn't do that he said all with that
[1:20:45] kind of those lizard eyes and gave him
[1:20:47] that little grin he's like oh no and he
[1:20:49] begin to blow on that thing and make
[1:20:51] that call for a mother deer and all of a
[1:20:54] sudden
[1:20:55] just in no time I I from what I
[1:20:58] understand those deers during during a
[1:21:00] hunting season they they just hunker
[1:21:02] down they don't come out especially in
[1:21:04] the daytime they're like
[1:21:06] Houdini they they'll they'll get away
[1:21:08] and escape and hide down and you you
[1:21:11] hardly ever find them except maybe in
[1:21:13] the early hours of the day and maybe
[1:21:15] late at night when they start to move
[1:21:17] around but here he starts to make this
[1:21:19] call and up Comes This Mother Dear
[1:21:21] standing out
[1:21:23] there
[1:21:25] and he takes up his gun he begins to aim
[1:21:27] it at the deer and brother Brand's over
[1:21:29] there going oh
[1:21:32] Bert don't do it don't do it he said he
[1:21:35] was a dead shot he'd blow that mother
[1:21:38] deer's loyal Heart Plum out of
[1:21:41] it and he said he he got zeroed in he
[1:21:44] kind of uh hunkered down there waiting
[1:21:46] for the shot and he kind of waited there
[1:21:48] and finally looked up and all of a
[1:21:50] sudden he saw the rifle going like this
[1:21:52] all over he threw it down and said
[1:21:54] brother R lead me to that Jesus of yours
[1:21:57] what was it he saw love being
[1:22:02] projected oh it moves my heart if if if
[1:22:06] love of a natural Mother Dear being
[1:22:09] projected for its Fawn or for its D or
[1:22:13] if
[1:22:14] that if that was enough to convert a
[1:22:21] man I thought about that story I would
[1:22:23] have thought it would have been the
[1:22:24] concerning of the thoughts I thought it
[1:22:26] would have been brother brandom telling
[1:22:28] him well bir the way you're this way and
[1:22:30] that way and and it would have been
[1:22:31] water bapt it would have been this and
[1:22:35] that but all it took is him seeing the
[1:22:38] love of a mother projected something
[1:22:40] that wasn't fake something that was real
[1:22:43] standing up in the face of danger saying
[1:22:45] I love you that was love being projected
[1:22:49] and Sovereign Grace took over and
[1:22:50] directed that man to the Lord Jesus
[1:22:53] Christ
[1:22:55] if that mother dear could minister to
[1:22:57] him how much
[1:22:59] more should our lives be being
[1:23:02] ministered to those that are around
[1:23:05] us prophet of God says in God's provided
[1:23:09] place of worship he says now Jesus
[1:23:11] himself said at that
[1:23:12] day when the son of man is being
[1:23:15] revealed in other words the son of
[1:23:18] man the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:23:22] himself the church will come through
[1:23:24] justification through Luther through
[1:23:28] sanctification through Wesley through
[1:23:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:23:32] Pentecostals and go right on into to the
[1:23:35] Perfection of the son of man when
[1:23:38] husband and wife will be the SE same
[1:23:41] selfers God will be so manifested into
[1:23:45] his bride his church till they will be
[1:23:48] both the same they are
[1:23:52] one now I I I'm thankful to be living in
[1:23:55] this
[1:23:57] hour I hope these things aren't becoming
[1:23:59] so familiar that we can't even rejoice
[1:24:02] in
[1:24:03] them and and it's become uh just these
[1:24:06] four walls and the ministry of the
[1:24:08] message is just listening to tapes and
[1:24:10] hanging out with people that recognize
[1:24:12] Malachi 45 you're missing it all you're
[1:24:14] missing it all it's Way Beyond Creeds
[1:24:17] and and dogmas and
[1:24:20] doctrines there is something in the
[1:24:22] Supernatural realm and in heaven places
[1:24:25] that is taking place where things are
[1:24:26] breaking so fast out there where God is
[1:24:29] coming into a union with a bride and
[1:24:31] that he is fulfilling his word that he
[1:24:32] has left for this bride to do for this
[1:24:34] specific work it's happening young
[1:24:36] people it's
[1:24:38] time you might be so uh focused on
[1:24:40] school you might be so focused on boys
[1:24:43] or you might be so focused on this it's
[1:24:45] time this is bride time yes this is
[1:24:48] Eagle time this is Rapture
[1:24:52] time put him first yes he'll take care
[1:24:55] of all those other things I understand
[1:24:57] we're in the world but we're not of the
[1:24:59] world if you I understand we want jobs
[1:25:02] and we want careers but don't let those
[1:25:03] things govern your life don't let them
[1:25:06] rule you don't let them tell you where
[1:25:09] to live and where to go don't do that
[1:25:11] you'll miss it you let the Holy Spirit
[1:25:14] lead you let the holy spirit guide you
[1:25:16] yes I I would rather you know as brother
[1:25:19] Brandon would say many times to minister
[1:25:21] I'd rather be under a bridge uh uh
[1:25:23] drinking Branch water soda crackers and
[1:25:25] trespassing the word of the
[1:25:27] Lord and so many people will sell their
[1:25:30] Birthright for for a bowl of
[1:25:34] Stew it's not even good
[1:25:38] stew comparative you kidding
[1:25:43] me what does this world have that it can
[1:25:46] offer that
[1:25:48] compares tell me tell me why the richest
[1:25:51] men in the world are still working you
[1:25:53] ever figure that one out are you kidding
[1:25:57] me you're worth 40 billion 200 billion
[1:26:01] and you're still
[1:26:07] working they're searching for something
[1:26:10] right that this world can
[1:26:13] never never satisfy yes sir all your
[1:26:18] Lear Jets and all your
[1:26:22] Islands they still working what are what
[1:26:25] are they working for they're working to
[1:26:31] die and what's going to be left of
[1:26:34] them like Elvis Presley a fleet of
[1:26:38] Cadillacs and some 1950 greatest
[1:26:44] hits was it worth
[1:26:46] it like that one that cried just a just
[1:26:51] a drip of water on my tongue
[1:26:55] how easily we trade it
[1:26:57] away but we can't be satisfied with just
[1:27:02] recognizing oh my name's on the Lamb's
[1:27:04] Book of Life and I'll get there on we
[1:27:07] have tonight yes and we have the moment
[1:27:09] that we are now living in right that
[1:27:12] Christ might lead us and guide us in the
[1:27:14] moment that we're living in to minister
[1:27:16] unto him and to minister unto
[1:27:19] others that that Christ and the bride
[1:27:22] are becoming one I don't want
[1:27:24] belabor the service and take the time
[1:27:27] but we understand how uh that God when
[1:27:29] he started to create the world and he he
[1:27:31] came up to man and he said everything is
[1:27:34] good but when he looked at Adam there
[1:27:37] alone he said it is not good that man
[1:27:40] would dwell alone so he said I will make
[1:27:43] a help meat for him and he where was
[1:27:46] that help
[1:27:48] meat it was within it was part of him
[1:27:52] and God separated that help meat out of
[1:27:55] him and brought her unto him and what
[1:27:58] did Adam do he gave her her
[1:28:01] identification he told her look you're
[1:28:03] bone of my
[1:28:04] bone you you have come from me so
[1:28:07] therefore I call you woman your bone of
[1:28:09] my bone and your Flesh of My Flesh you
[1:28:11] see what God was mirroring there in the
[1:28:14] beginning he's now come in the end time
[1:28:16] and he said the same thing to you look
[1:28:19] you you you came out of my side at
[1:28:22] Calvary I predestinated you to this age
[1:28:26] that you would live in that you would
[1:28:28] fulfill my word but you are part of me
[1:28:31] you are now bone of my bone you are
[1:28:33] Flesh of My Flesh you are life of my
[1:28:36] life you came from
[1:28:39] me we are one there's this Oneness
[1:28:42] there's this Unity but what was the
[1:28:45] purpose of the Bride when God was was
[1:28:49] mirroring that out and reflecting he
[1:28:50] said it's not good that man should dwell
[1:28:53] alone
[1:28:55] the purpose of Eve was to minister unto
[1:28:57] Adam that there would be a union there
[1:28:59] that there would be a Oneness that they
[1:29:01] could Minister one to the
[1:29:04] other so then what about
[1:29:08] us you have a great ministry but it's
[1:29:11] it's not just limited to trying to to go
[1:29:13] out and prove to the world you're
[1:29:15] superhuman I can do all
[1:29:18] things because I know all things cuz
[1:29:22] he's revealed all things no no it's
[1:29:25] it's humble it's it's it's led by the
[1:29:29] spirit and in order to get to that we
[1:29:33] must recognize as a prophet of God would
[1:29:36] say this who is he says he's referring
[1:29:38] to the scripture in Revelations 5 he
[1:29:40] came and he came 10,000 times 10,000
[1:29:43] that right ministered to him the bride
[1:29:48] the queen and king who is your little
[1:29:50] Queen in the home she ministers food to
[1:29:53] your right
[1:29:55] when she ministers to you that's what
[1:29:57] the bride ministers to Christ the word
[1:30:00] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:30:03] every word see she ministers the word to
[1:30:06] the king manifesting his promise word in
[1:30:09] the age that she's living

[1:33:33] we we got to revisit those things we got
[1:33:35] to work on those things we we got to
[1:33:36] minister one to another uh if if we're
[1:33:39] not careful it's so easy to allow the
[1:33:41] cares and things of the world where we
[1:33:43] just want somebody else to bless us and
[1:33:45] we're not ministering to
[1:33:46] them and I say shame on us forever
[1:33:49] getting to the place where we fail to
[1:33:51] minister unto our Lord he's worthy to be
[1:33:54] ministered to he's worthy of praise and
[1:33:58] adoration he's worthy of our
[1:34:00] time he's worthy of us to steal away and
[1:34:03] get away and say Lord this is now your
[1:34:05] time I need to talk to
[1:34:08] you I need to get in your presence

[1:38:26] the son of man you become Bread on his
[1:38:29] table now you're ministering now you're
[1:38:32] becoming the word made flesh ministering
[1:38:35] the word back to the
[1:38:37] groom we'll just ask for the musicians
[1:38:39] to come no way to turn this corner and
[1:38:43] let you
[1:38:44] out in time for
[1:38:49] breakfast that's my heart's desire is I
[1:38:51] want to minister to the Lord
[1:38:55] I want to serve him I want to be
[1:38:56] pleasing I want to worship I want to
[1:38:58] love him with all of my
[1:39:02] heart and I know these things are
[1:39:05] Elementary but that's exactly what
[1:39:08] Malachi 4:5 has
[1:39:10] done just as God brought Eve un
[1:39:15] Adam elzer our messenger has brought us
[1:39:19] under our
[1:39:21] groom where we find our ident
[1:39:24] ification where we find out who we
[1:39:28] are and now
[1:39:31] church it's time to
[1:39:34] become what he said we are he said you
[1:39:37] have to be anointed you must be born
[1:39:40] again our
[1:39:41] theology our good works our church our
[1:39:45] understanding it's not good
[1:39:47] enough it's not
[1:39:50] enough the prophet of God said Moses
[1:39:52] knew a whole lot you can play something
[1:39:56] softly Moses knew a whole lot about
[1:40:01] God but when he came into the presence
[1:40:03] of that Pillar of
[1:40:06] Fire that's where he found out his
[1:40:09] mistakes it's where he found his
[1:40:12] failure sure we come into the presence
[1:40:15] of this message we realize we're
[1:40:18] lacking we look into it say oh my I
[1:40:20] believe I believe this
[1:40:22] word but the prophet of God said it also
[1:40:25] had what he
[1:40:26] needed it had what he
[1:40:29] lacked so if you're lacking
[1:40:32] tonight it's laying right here in the
[1:40:36] word if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:38] it's here for
[1:40:42] you it's the spirit that quickeneth the
[1:40:46] flesh profiteth
[1:40:48] nothing but it's the words that I speak
[1:40:50] unto you they are Spirit in his life
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] you are the anointed one for this
[1:40:59] day you believe
[1:41:01] that
[1:41:05] you you can't put it off on anybody else
[1:41:07] there has to be something in the heart
[1:41:10] of the
[1:41:11] believer that is saying you know what
[1:41:14] it's time for me to fulfill the
[1:41:17] ministry that God has placed me here
[1:41:20] for I've been ministering to a whole lot
[1:41:23] of other
[1:41:24] needs things that are just going to be
[1:41:27] that are going to pass
[1:41:29] away but Lord you said heavens and earth
[1:41:31] will pass away but my
[1:41:33] word your word will never pass
[1:41:37] away that's what I want yes I want to
[1:41:41] just let all of those things fade away
[1:41:44] and I want to allow the mind that was in
[1:41:45] Christ Jesus to be in me that I must be
[1:41:49] about the father's
[1:41:51] business Lord that this unit that this
[1:41:53] harmony Lord that you're speaking of
[1:41:55] would come into
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:42:01] me I'm tired of babying the flesh man
[1:42:04] I'm tired of catering to the things of
[1:42:07] the
[1:42:08] world Lord if you said and if you said
[1:42:10] I'm supposed to be the anointed word of
[1:42:12] this day
[1:42:14] Lord Lord I want to empty out tonight
[1:42:16] that you could come Lord I've been so
[1:42:19] filled up with the things of the world
[1:42:21] I've been so consumed with jobs and
[1:42:23] bills and and just trying to make in me
[1:42:27] that I've totally forgot about you
[1:42:30] Lord and I realize I can never fulfill
[1:42:33] what you've placed me here to fulfill if
[1:42:36] I'm not ministering unto
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:39] you not if I'm not coming under the
[1:42:41] presence of your word if I'm not coming
[1:42:44] into a Unity with
[1:42:46] you so I say Here I Am
[1:42:49] Lord I'm here to empty
[1:42:51] out I want that anointing Lord I want
[1:42:55] that Holy Spirit to
[1:42:56] come to come upon my
[1:43:00] life to make this word
[1:43:04] live not just on
[1:43:08] Sunday oh maybe this sounds
[1:43:12] repetitious I believe what the prophet
[1:43:15] [Music]
[1:43:17] spoke I believe that there is now a
[1:43:20] great ministry taking place in the lives
[1:43:24] of the Bride that's sitting
[1:43:26] here and now we need to embrace
[1:43:30] it where is your
[1:43:33] ministry where is your
[1:43:36] Pulpit it's wherever you
[1:43:39] are it's your
[1:43:42] school it's your
[1:43:44] home it's your
[1:43:47] family but we've
[1:43:49] forgotten we've forgotten that we are to
[1:43:51] be the Tabernacle love the Lord that all
[1:43:55] that was in God he poured into Christ
[1:43:57] and all that was in Christ he poured
[1:43:58] into you so then the works that he did
[1:44:01] you
[1:44:03] do maybe with every head
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:12] bowed maybe there's somebody here that
[1:44:15] hasn't come into that type of unity that
[1:44:16] kind of
[1:44:22] Oneness
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:27] and Jesus said Peace be unto
[1:44:30] you as my father has sent
[1:44:33] me even so send I

[1:44:41] Ghost with every head bowed is there
