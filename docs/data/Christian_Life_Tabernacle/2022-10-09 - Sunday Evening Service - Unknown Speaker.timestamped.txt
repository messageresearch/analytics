[15:42] [Music]
[15:47] welcome back to the house of the Lord
[15:48] amen we we cherish that cross of calvary
[15:53] you know brother Brandon talked about
[15:56] if we had just one drop
[16:01] of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[16:04] shed
[16:05] how precious it would be to us
[16:08] and how much faith it would render but
[16:13] how much more blessed
[16:15] is the purchase of that blood
[16:18] if we had a diamond that would buy us an
[16:21] island we could go live on
[16:23] in Paradise
[16:27] and we had to sell that diamond to gain
[16:28] access to that Island
[16:30] once we're on the island you wouldn't
[16:32] rule losing the value of the diamond
[16:34] because you got the island
[16:39] I don't want to profane the blood of the
[16:40] Lord Jesus
[16:43] it wasn't in vain
[16:44] [Music]
[16:46] but if we don't live up to what
[16:48] he purchased
[16:50] then we do profane the blood of the Lord
[16:53] Jesus there's a sacrifice offered
[16:57] there's healing and there's salvation
[17:01] let's claim it
[17:04] for the word the Lord says the eyes of
[17:07] the Lord are over the righteous
[17:10] and his ear is open under their prayers
[17:13] let's go before him
[17:16] gracious and kind Heavenly Father we
[17:18] approach you once again Lord
[17:21] humility
[17:23] Lord it just lowliness realizing that
[17:27] we're nothing but flesh and Clay Lord
[17:31] but Lord we
[17:33] we've been changed
[17:36] we're not of that simple nature anymore
[17:38] Lord we we claim this we have an
[17:42] indwelling spirit
[17:44] Lord that you said you'd pour out upon
[17:46] us Lord that you'd come back you'd be a
[17:48] comforter
[17:49] that you would bless us and keep us you
[17:52] wouldn't leave us a forsake as you'd be
[17:53] with us and even in us and to the end
[17:57] so Lord we claim that tonight
[17:59] we have needs Lord amongst us
[18:03] Lord that we want to press upon you
[18:08] Lord to fulfill what we have need of
[18:12] we've been taught Lord that you want to
[18:14] be reminded of your word
[18:17] so Lord we
[18:20] we come Lord
[18:22] at the off at the altar of Thanksgiving
[18:25] of repentance of
[18:30] Lord we just we want to pour out
[18:33] ourselves before you realize that it's
[18:36] by you and your word Lord that we have
[18:39] access to the throne of God
[18:43] Lord there's
[18:45] many sick or needy Lord that just remain
[18:48] on our hearts
[18:50] there's people here tonight Lord with
[18:53] emptiness and woefulness
[18:55] Lord had just been
[18:57] discouraged we pray Lord at each one of
[19:00] these things can be met
[19:02] consolidate here at the house of the
[19:04] Lord as we go from this place Lord we
[19:06] can be lifted up not just in the flesh
[19:09] Lord but in our Spirits as we heard this
[19:11] morning Lord
[19:12] realizing
[19:13] our Prophet said that the spiritual
[19:15] Realm
[19:16] is even more real
[19:19] than the Physical Realm
[19:21] but Lord that all this negativity
[19:24] is going to one day accentuate the
[19:26] positive
[19:27] and Lord we're going to see clearly
[19:30] what you intended from the beginning

[19:35] what we have need up tonight Lord we
[19:37] just want to move up a little higher

[40:14] [Music]
[40:23] enjoy detail and hearing your voice he
[40:27] asked me to bless
[40:30] you
[40:36] need a way to keep my
[40:38] sermon a little short
[40:40] s
[40:43] and then we'll have it uh and I'll try
[40:47] not to get too excited I thought as I
[40:50] listened to this I said you know this
[40:53] whole sermon is only an hour and 30
[40:55] minutes long
[40:57] and there's more in it than I could
[41:00] preach in 10 years but uh so we're going
[41:04] to just read our scripture that we read
[41:06] this morning found in Isaiah the seventh
[41:10] chapter and uh
[41:12] and uh read from uh that again and uh
[41:19] and then let me see if I can find that
[41:22] here and then we will uh
[41:27] get prepared to uh listen to
[41:32] that so Isaiah 7 said
[41:37] the 10th verse moreover the Lord's fake
[41:40] again
[41:42] to to
[41:43] azad's saying
[41:46] ask the assign of the Lord thy God ask
[41:50] it either in the the depth
[41:54] or in the highest above
[41:58] but Asad said I will not ask neither
[42:01] will I tempt the Lord
[42:03] and he said hear ye now o House of David
[42:07] it is a small thing for you to weary men
[42:11] but will ye weary My God also therefore
[42:15] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[42:18] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[42:22] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[42:27] Lord bless you
[42:29] you may be seated so we're certainly uh
[42:34] talking about
[42:37] the sign and uh I had a wonderful
[42:43] a chance to have some fellowship uh this
[42:47] afternoon and we had a sister come to
[42:51] church and she came to the church
[42:55] for the first time and and the reason
[43:00] that she came to church was because she
[43:03] had a dream about a storm
[43:06] and um so in this dream that she had
[43:10] about a storm it it touched her so much
[43:14] that she made contact with her family
[43:16] and said I want to go to church and then
[43:19] when she came to church well the first
[43:22] thing we began to talk about was the
[43:24] oncoming storm and preparing for this
[43:27] storm and and so
[43:30] so she came to fellowship and we got to
[43:34] talking and I says well do you go to
[43:36] church she says I don't go to church
[43:38] and I said well you know better than
[43:41] that and she said yeah she says but I'm
[43:43] going to start going to church so I
[43:45] thought that was pretty good here open
[43:47] that for me would you
[43:49] and um
[43:52] as they took a bone out of my hand and I
[43:55] don't have uh much strength in that but
[43:58] we're going to listen to 40 minutes
[44:00] right now out of the message super sign
[44:04] and we're going to start with paragraph
[44:07] 55. and uh but I just want to read this
[44:11] statement uh to you again before we go
[44:15] forward and uh I I wanted to I was going
[44:18] to try to preach this next part but
[44:21] he can do it so much better that I just
[44:24] felt that to play this part and it says
[44:27] now that's the way the gospel is today
[44:32] uh
[44:33] it can only be seen this is paragraph
[44:36] 54. it can only be seen
[44:41] in the way that God presents it to you
[44:47] and that's why the church will never
[44:49] flourish on second-hand revelation
[44:53] you know so how many understands how God
[44:56] chose to present the message to us he
[44:59] chose to present it to us through
[45:02] Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30 Revelations 10
[45:07] 7. in order to present it to us who
[45:11] weren't there he stored it up
[45:15] in a storehouse put it on magnetic tape
[45:19] that we too could hear and listen and
[45:24] hear that voice so that voice wasn't
[45:27] lost
[45:28] to us
[45:30] and now so the only way we can see it is
[45:35] the way he presented it
[45:37] and and so we've had that presentation
[45:41] in our day and and so he says and if
[45:45] it's presented to you outside the
[45:47] continuity of the Bible then it's not
[45:51] God telling you that
[45:53] you can't make the Bible lie it's
[45:56] infallible word of God
[45:59] and it has to agree with the continuity
[46:04] of his the rest of his word it just
[46:08] can't say this one place
[46:11] and this something else
[46:14] and do this over hit and Scatter it hits
[46:19] the target every time the word does so
[46:24] you have to make it in the continuity of
[46:29] the rest of the word therefore his way
[46:33] has always been in the word to send a
[46:39] prophet before that time therefore he
[46:43] makes his word Vindicated
[46:47] and so where we pick at up after that
[46:51] statement brother Brennan makes this
[46:53] statement now I want to speak just a
[46:56] minute on what is a prophet I think
[47:01] you'll enjoy it uh just a few of us will
[47:04] listen to 40 minutes and then we should
[47:08] be out here in just a little bit it's uh
[47:11] I don't know what time is it 5 30 40
[47:13] minutes then maybe we'll be out by what
[47:17] 6 30 7 something like that close anyway
[47:21] I love listening to the message don't
[47:24] you amen I think you'll enjoy this
[47:26] there's some other comments brother
[47:28] Brandon makes in here and brother Ram's
[47:32] going to make a statement why people
[47:35] build
[47:36] big nice houses
[47:41] you ever can think of that
[47:44] and there's he tells you why
[47:47] he tells you why people go build these
[47:49] great big gigantic houses
[47:52] you know so listen to that it's really
[47:55] good
[47:56] and then he he talks about a lot of
[47:58] little things and then at the end of
[48:01] this he talks about
[48:03] how important you are
[48:06] as a believer
[48:08] because if you didn't believe it it
[48:10] wouldn't be a message
[48:12] and so there's some really wonderful
[48:14] things here that I think you'll enjoy so
[48:17] God bless you as we listen to our
[48:19] messenger explain to us what is a
[48:22] prophet God bless you
[48:25] now we might speak here just about what
[48:28] is a prophet now in the English terms
[48:31] according to the English terms of it it
[48:33] means a preacher
[48:34] well that's the English terms but in the
[48:37] Hebrew terms it's called seer
[48:40] and a Seer was the one who had the
[48:43] interpretation of the written word
[48:46] and he foresaw things that was to come
[48:50] and when he spoke of the things that was
[48:52] to come and proved that he was a Seer
[48:56] then he no they knowed he had the right
[48:58] interpretation of the scripture because
[49:00] God through him manifested the written
[49:04] scripture for that day
[49:07] Hallelujah
[49:09] don't be Soulful wake up
[49:13] that was a plain identification
[49:17] a seer
[49:18] a fourth teller not tell her fourth and
[49:21] the only way that they know he's getting
[49:22] the right interpretation to do the
[49:23] scripture because what he said come to
[49:26] pass
[49:27] then they know he was called of God God
[49:29] said that
[49:31] and then he noticed that it did it come
[49:33] right back in continuity with the word
[49:35] for that day
[49:36] Jesus said search the scriptures when
[49:39] they seen he could discern the thoughts
[49:41] that was in their mind they called him
[49:43] Beelzebub he said search the scriptures
[49:45] they're the ones that testify on me the
[49:47] continuity of the scriptures run it
[49:49] perfectly but the sign of the time he
[49:53] was God's side of the time
[49:56] he was the manifestation of the written
[50:00] word and also could foretell what would
[50:03] happen
[50:04] and they could not deny it he was a
[50:07] super sign of the day
[50:09] he certainly was notice
[50:12] the continuity of his unchanging word
[50:14] also the Holy Spirit
[50:17] Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come
[50:19] upon you he will remind you or reveal
[50:23] these things I've told you and also
[50:26] we'll show you things to come
[50:28] now the Bible the people say today there
[50:30] is no such a thing as a prophet in the
[50:33] world why as if Paul said it in the
[50:35] church there were first apostles
[50:38] prophets teachers pastors and
[50:39] evangelists
[50:42] certainly there was
[50:44] the Holy Ghost is the prophet
[50:47] when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[50:50] he will reveal or teach you show you
[50:53] these things I've told you it's all been
[50:55] in a riddle you don't understand them
[50:58] now because it's not far your age now
[51:00] but when the Holy Ghost has come he will
[51:03] make those things live outright to the
[51:06] promise not only that but he'll show you
[51:09] things that is to come
[51:12] Glory
[51:14] the continuity of God's word God's
[51:17] promise God's spirit
[51:21] we're living in the hour
[51:23] watching the unfolding of the Prophecies
[51:26] of the age coming to pass
[51:29] what a great time that we're living in
[51:31] the Holy Spirit was the surest things
[51:33] that was to come
[51:36] man has ever tried to achieve and make
[51:39] for himself a name by making him a super
[51:41] sign
[51:42] what makes a man try to make himself
[51:45] something super over the other
[51:47] why does he do that
[51:54] sinner but his statue he's a fallen Son
[51:57] of God
[51:58] why does he make himself such a pretty
[52:00] home making it better all the time is
[52:03] the the bird don't make his home any
[52:05] different the groundhog still lives in
[52:07] the ground like he did a thousand years
[52:09] ago see the bird still builds a nest
[52:11] like he did a thousand years ago
[52:14] see but man is increasing why he's a any
[52:18] and he is a fallen Son of God
[52:20] there's something in him that tells him
[52:22] that a palace more beautiful than
[52:25] something in him is trying to find it
[52:27] it's searching for it
[52:28] oh if we look at some of these homes
[52:30] today what will them be on the other
[52:33] side when a fallen nature can do a thing
[52:36] like this
[52:38] what will it be but that's what makes
[52:41] him do that is nature inside of him
[52:43] though he is Fallen he tries to make
[52:46] something in himself he tries to do that
[52:49] it's been from the beginning Adam he
[52:52] tried to make a super religion without
[52:54] an atonement
[52:56] they're still trying to do it
[52:58] a super religion make a religion so he
[53:01] could live any way he wanted to without
[53:03] an atonement and still have a covering
[53:06] he tried to do it in the beginning and
[53:08] he's still trying to do it but God's
[53:11] provided what he wasn't atonement and
[53:13] it'll never work the other way
[53:15] it has to come back to an atonement
[53:18] Nimrod tried to build a super Tower a
[53:22] religious Tower whether it be anybody
[53:24] that would a little Tower might have
[53:26] been 30 feet high but he wanted to make
[53:28] something super
[53:30] something greater so he built him a
[53:33] tower
[53:34] that wasn't his day Nebuchadnezzar
[53:36] wanted to build a super City
[53:39] he took the pattern off of Heaven
[53:42] The Swinging Gardens the river Euphrates
[53:44] by the throne just like the Water of
[53:47] Life the River of Life running by the
[53:49] Throne of God
[53:51] he tried to make a super City
[53:53] the United States
[53:55] a few years ago tried to make a super
[53:57] ship
[53:59] they made it so they said it would never
[54:00] sink it couldn't be saint
[54:02] God put the Titanic in the bottom of the
[54:05] sea
[54:06] or is that man's achievement well never
[54:09] amount to anything it's all Dustin going
[54:11] back to the Dust
[54:13] what's in him Russia Today is trying to
[54:16] raise up a super scientist
[54:18] that can do some scientific things to
[54:20] conquer the world
[54:21] France not all gold thought they could
[54:23] still have their women whining big time
[54:25] so they made himself a called imaginal
[54:27] line
[54:28] had their guns all towards Germany the
[54:31] arch enemy if they ever come this way
[54:33] we'll just live any way we want to we'll
[54:35] make a big super line out here and make
[54:37] out of concrete horn or guns and to ever
[54:39] come we'll touch a button it'll all fire
[54:41] and blow him back in Germany
[54:43] Germany marched right around behind it
[54:46] they forgot
[54:48] soil Weavers off
[54:52] god with his my hands shows this world
[54:55] he cannot stand
[54:59] but they want to Super sign
[55:01] they made him imagine online
[55:03] at Germany marched out of behind because
[55:05] he forgot so they could put the gun on a
[55:07] tour
[55:08] you could roll it back around the other
[55:09] way and shoot they forgot that that's
[55:12] just what the church is forgetting today
[55:14] they got a super Church they got a super
[55:16] denomination they got super dressed
[55:19] people they got everything they want
[55:20] super ministers with super education but
[55:23] you forget that God's word cannot fail
[55:27] it's got to come the way God said it was
[55:30] going to come
[55:31] there's no way of getting around it
[55:34] Along come Germany later on they thought
[55:36] that was a good idea so they'd fix it so
[55:38] they could turn their guns the other way
[55:40] so they built themselves a line called
[55:42] the Siegfried line
[55:43] but American Blockbusters blow them out
[55:46] of the ground
[55:47] see they're trying to make something
[55:49] super super all the time churches today
[55:52] won't their super denomination we've
[55:55] tried for a long time methodists take
[55:56] all Baptists take all then the
[55:58] Pentecostal come in the race they take
[56:00] all Catholics try to take all so they
[56:02] find out a little scattered group they
[56:04] can't do it but put them together how
[56:07] scriptural it sounds put us together
[56:10] put us together
[56:12] we'll do it then we'll run communism out
[56:15] of the ocean not knowing that God raised
[56:17] up communism to defeat him
[56:20] that's a big word for a preacher to say
[56:22] but I get so sick of hearing this
[56:23] communism communism you know there's
[56:25] signs of Communism but the hour you're
[56:27] living in you don't know nothing about
[56:28] it
[56:30] and you know God promised to do that the
[56:32] same as he started to raise up
[56:33] Nebuchadnezzar destroy Israel
[56:36] because they didn't walk in his way the
[56:37] Bible plainly teaches that this is the
[56:40] hour for it to happen
[56:42] we find out in the day that we're living
[56:44] all these things are not nothing hid
[56:47] it's something that God has revealed in
[56:50] the word but people are too blind to sin
[56:52] today we think well now if we can all
[56:55] get together in the unity there is uh in
[56:58] the council the multitude of council
[57:00] there is safety that is true but what
[57:02] kind of multitude are you Counseling in
[57:06] how can you walk together how can you
[57:08] throw these denominations together some
[57:10] of them Believers and some unbelievers
[57:11] and some make believers
[57:13] how do you go to put them together and
[57:15] walk together how can two walk together
[57:16] except they'd be agreed it's also
[57:19] written
[57:21] look here what they do they make
[57:23] themselves a multitude one time they did
[57:26] the same thing in the Bible
[57:28] when Ahab was in trouble
[57:31] and uh they have sent down for Jehovah
[57:34] to come down from from Judea and and to
[57:38] find out if he would take these armies
[57:40] and help him fight the battle and
[57:42] Jehoshaphat a Believer out of connection
[57:44] with these God went down there and said
[57:47] yes said there's a piece of ground up
[57:49] there that belongs to us
[57:52] that's ours God gave it to us the
[57:55] prophet Joshua lauded us at ground and
[57:58] now we find out that it belongs to the
[58:01] enemy the enemy is growing wheat on
[58:04] Earth it should go in the bellies of us
[58:07] Hebrews and now they're taking it over
[58:09] there with the Enemy said shall we go up
[58:13] will you go up with me well now Jehovah
[58:15] not taking the second thought said well
[58:17] sure my church is your chariots my
[58:20] Horseman's your Horseman my footman is
[58:23] your footman we are brothers let's agree
[58:25] together we'll make an alliance and
[58:27] we'll go up that is struck him we better
[58:30] seek God first oh my before you join
[58:34] that thing you better seek God first
[58:38] you better find out before you throw
[58:39] your church in such a babbling as that
[58:41] you'll have to do it or either take the
[58:44] mark of the beast but when
[58:47] they said Ahab said certainly I want to
[58:50] thought of that I said I've got 400 down
[58:53] here at the Seminary Hebrew prophets the
[58:55] best there is in the country there's no
[58:57] better anywhere we'll go get them not
[59:00] come the prophets of the all prophesied
[59:02] sure there was exactly with the the
[59:05] right idea they thought it said
[59:07] certainly that belongs to Israel if God
[59:10] gave that to Israel it belongs to Israel
[59:12] but God only gives you these things on
[59:15] conditions
[59:17] that's what I think about the gifts of
[59:19] the Spirit in the church today so many
[59:21] says it needs to be in there but it'll
[59:24] only come in there utter conditions
[59:27] Northern Minister said to me not long
[59:29] ago won't you quit picking on them women
[59:30] and men about this side of the other
[59:33] said they'd regard you as a Seer a
[59:35] prophet said why don't you teach them
[59:36] how to receive the Holy Ghost and great
[59:38] gifts I said what would they do with
[59:40] them
[59:42] said you you are to teach them better
[59:44] things than trying to tell them how to
[59:46] cut their hair and wear their clothes
[59:47] and so forth like that you shouldn't do
[59:49] that I said how am I going to teach them
[59:51] algebra when they won't even listen to
[59:52] their ABCs
[59:54] thank you
[59:55] how do you go to do that
[59:57] they got the God gives these gifts on
[1:00:00] conditions
[1:00:01] and that land belonged to Israel on
[1:00:03] conditions that have stayed true to God
[1:00:05] but look what I Renegade they had in
[1:00:07] there for a pastor
[1:00:10] let's let in idolatry and everything
[1:00:12] else be swept in but the prophets
[1:00:14] thinking that that belonged to God
[1:00:16] belonged to Israel was a gift to Israel
[1:00:18] they ought to possess it that's the same
[1:00:21] thing taking place today
[1:00:22] but remember
[1:00:24] when they all prophesy would want a
[1:00:26] carbon one of my things zedekiah I've
[1:00:29] met him a great big set of iron horns he
[1:00:31] said you'll take these and push the
[1:00:33] serious come out of the country with
[1:00:34] them
[1:00:35] and they just didn't suit this uh
[1:00:37] religious good moral man uh Jehoshaphat
[1:00:40] he said well haven't he got one more
[1:00:43] one more when we got 400
[1:00:46] 400 with one of cards say we'll have the
[1:00:49] Council of churches we just do it see
[1:00:51] they're all in unity said they're
[1:00:53] everyone in agreement
[1:00:54] say why don't you go ahead and just go
[1:00:57] on up with me he said isn't there just
[1:00:59] one more
[1:01:00] that you could consult about this that
[1:01:03] has contact with God
[1:01:05] he said yes he's one more but I sure
[1:01:07] hate him
[1:01:09] that's it
[1:01:10] oh let not the king say so said
[1:01:13] Jehoshaphat let's go consult him and see
[1:01:16] what it would be he said there's one
[1:01:18] yeah I know and the son of England said
[1:01:20] Micah but said I hate him
[1:01:22] said he's always putting curses on me
[1:01:25] he's always telling me I'm wrong and uh
[1:01:28] hell's waiting for me I said I hate to
[1:01:30] eat here and preach
[1:01:31] now the rest of minutes won't even have
[1:01:33] them in their churches
[1:01:35] said we've kicked him out a long time
[1:01:37] ago out of the association
[1:01:39] said I don't even know where you'd find
[1:01:40] him oh I said don't let the king say so
[1:01:43] let's go get him so then one of the
[1:01:45] association went action he said now
[1:01:47] Micah you got a chance to get your
[1:01:48] membership card back again if you'll say
[1:01:50] the same thing they say see you're just
[1:01:52] so good if you'll agree with us that we
[1:01:54] all should join the council and all
[1:01:56] going together well yes you be one of us
[1:01:58] oh but God's always got somebody you'll
[1:02:01] stand true
[1:02:03] he said as the Lord God Lives I'll only
[1:02:06] say what he tells me to say hey
[1:02:10] that was the sign to Jehoshaphat
[1:02:13] you know how the story goes and he said
[1:02:16] why God said although 400 in a council
[1:02:19] was against him yet he stood and it was
[1:02:22] a sign to Jehoshaphat and Jehoshaphat
[1:02:26] wouldn't go out there so we find out how
[1:02:28] the outcome was because that man's word
[1:02:31] was exactly what the prophet's word that
[1:02:33] have been prophesied for ahab's day
[1:02:36] because he took the righteous and nabob
[1:02:39] and slayed him in things God told him
[1:02:42] through the Prophet Elijah that the dogs
[1:02:45] will lick your own blood that's right
[1:02:47] and what would take place and how they'd
[1:02:50] eat Jezebel he prophesied that was the
[1:02:53] word and Micah was the one who could
[1:02:56] bring it to pass amen he was a prophet's
[1:02:59] sign of that day
[1:03:00] that only listened to him it has never
[1:03:03] failed God always sends it
[1:03:06] everybody's always wanting a sign we're
[1:03:08] supposed to look for signs that's right
[1:03:10] but religious uh scriptural signs not
[1:03:13] religious signs Bible signs
[1:03:16] everybody was going to look for a sign
[1:03:18] and they know this should be a super day
[1:03:19] God's seeing the end from the beginning
[1:03:21] so he said I'll give them a sign
[1:03:24] a super sign
[1:03:26] I'll give them an eternal sign
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:31] I'll give him one that'll never fail and
[1:03:34] never pass away
[1:03:36] amen they want a sign so I'm going to
[1:03:39] give them on the super sign
[1:03:42] he didn't come in the Polish of the
[1:03:44] world the way they expected him to come
[1:03:46] but what did he say a virgin shall
[1:03:49] conceive
[1:03:51] that was a sign that was a super sign a
[1:03:56] virgin shall conceive amen a super
[1:04:00] uh super sign not a natural sign but a
[1:04:04] super sign a virgin conceiving see a
[1:04:07] supernatural sign
[1:04:11] Supernatural it was a super sign for a
[1:04:14] virgin I never did it before but she
[1:04:16] shall conceive
[1:04:17] what was it to be his name Shall be
[1:04:20] Called Emmanuel how would it be God in
[1:04:24] man will become one
[1:04:26] that's a super sign
[1:04:29] oh God
[1:04:31] if the world could only see that
[1:04:34] that God is near one
[1:04:40] the super sign was that first man that
[1:04:42] God could come into
[1:04:44] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:04:46] and all Christ was he poured into the
[1:04:48] church
[1:04:50] super sign God and man together that was
[1:04:54] to be the Super side of the last day
[1:04:56] when the entire Bible was to be
[1:04:58] fulfilled in the last days
[1:05:00] a super sign a virgin shall conceive and
[1:05:05] this conception when it's brought forth
[1:05:07] will be God manifested In the Flesh
[1:05:11] a super sign they still don't believe it
[1:05:14] but it was anyhow it's still a super
[1:05:16] sign notice super sign they've got
[1:05:19] Superman today they got fictions of
[1:05:23] Superman
[1:05:24] all these other kind of super things but
[1:05:26] the church has got a super sign
[1:05:29] God back in the church manifested in
[1:05:32] human flesh
[1:05:34] God you're not a man he's sure super
[1:05:37] sign notice the Eternal sign an
[1:05:41] unfailing sign it will never fail
[1:05:45] man at the word and man become one
[1:05:50] when God's word and man become one is
[1:05:55] Saint John the first chapter says in the
[1:05:57] beginning was the word and the word is
[1:05:58] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:06:01] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:06:05] that's the super sign
[1:06:07] or if that was a super sign of that day
[1:06:10] when that same spirit that was on Jesus
[1:06:14] Christ comes into his church to manifest
[1:06:17] the written word for today that's still
[1:06:20] the super sign
[1:06:22] the church can have the sign of the
[1:06:24] council all of them getting together for
[1:06:25] a fake world peace and all they want to
[1:06:28] be the Baptist can say we got a million
[1:06:30] more and 44. the Methodist should make
[1:06:32] any kind of brags they won't do Oneness
[1:06:34] or Trinity's whatever they may be but
[1:06:36] the super sign is still God ever remains
[1:06:39] true to that super sign it's God in man
[1:06:43] manifesting his written word
[1:06:47] his word when he the Holy Ghost has come
[1:06:49] upon you he'll reveal these things show
[1:06:52] them to you and we'll show you things to
[1:06:54] come Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:06:57] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:58] exactly
[1:07:00] Abraham's
[1:07:02] supersede he was
[1:07:04] super Sun Abraham had one son he begot
[1:07:08] that by the natural flesh that was Isaac
[1:07:11] then he had another son that son was the
[1:07:14] faith
[1:07:15] that was Jesus
[1:07:16] he was the son of Abraham son of David
[1:07:19] Son of God he foresaw it in the vision
[1:07:24] faith in his promised word shown in the
[1:07:28] last to show forth in his last days
[1:07:30] Abraham we're supposed to be Abraham's
[1:07:33] seed if we are dead in Christ we are
[1:07:36] Abraham's seed and Heir with him
[1:07:38] according to the promise
[1:07:40] now
[1:07:41] why was this super sign given to Abraham
[1:07:44] because that it would bring forth the
[1:07:47] super sign of the last day it has to be
[1:07:50] displeased God showed Abraham the end
[1:07:52] from the beginning and what was going to
[1:07:54] take place God manifested in man his
[1:07:58] super Faith son
[1:08:00] man
[1:08:02] that could not destroy this son they
[1:08:05] could destroy Isaac they could destroy
[1:08:07] Jacob and the sisters after them but
[1:08:10] this super son could not be destroyed
[1:08:14] Abraham
[1:08:16] the Seed of Abraham the faith that not
[1:08:20] the natural seed but the faith that
[1:08:22] Abraham received not by the law of
[1:08:25] circumcision but by the faith in the
[1:08:27] word
[1:08:28] Abraham's super Faith son which was
[1:08:32] Jesus Christ now all his other sons died
[1:08:35] but this son could not be killed he was
[1:08:40] killed but could not stay dead the grave
[1:08:42] could not hold him he's the same
[1:08:44] yesterday and forever notice Genesis 22
[1:08:47] 16 and 17 upon the mount where God
[1:08:51] showed Abraham to go and there he saw a
[1:08:54] ram hooked by his horns in the
[1:08:56] wilderness
[1:08:57] notice quickly now
[1:08:59] after
[1:09:00] you took Isaac and bound him which was
[1:09:03] his natural son lady him upon the the
[1:09:07] altar to take his life
[1:09:08] and they started to take his life in
[1:09:10] Obedience of love to God and when he did
[1:09:13] something happened
[1:09:15] he heard a boy saying Abraham stay your
[1:09:18] hand for I know that thou loves me and
[1:09:20] then he heard a ramble hooked by its
[1:09:23] horns in the wilderness behind him and
[1:09:26] he called the name of the place Jehovah
[1:09:28] Jireh notice God said and
[1:09:32] uh your seed the Seed of Abraham now
[1:09:36] would possess the gates of its enemies
[1:09:41] he would take the gates possess the
[1:09:44] gates he promised it now his natural
[1:09:47] seed did just that
[1:09:49] all of Abraham's natural seed was the
[1:09:52] prophets to come after him that was
[1:09:55] Moses Abraham's seed and when he did he
[1:09:59] came to the gate in a line of duty
[1:10:02] he came to the gate of the Red Sea after
[1:10:05] teaching the children of Israel of the
[1:10:07] promised land that God had promised he
[1:10:09] was God's prophet he had been manifested
[1:10:12] before the people as God's prophet God
[1:10:16] created by him God did all kinds of
[1:10:19] signs and wonders by him and he stayed
[1:10:20] just exactly with God's word because he
[1:10:22] sought God first and he knew his
[1:10:25] position he knowed he was born for that
[1:10:27] age to manifest the word of God at that
[1:10:30] time and then right in the line of duty
[1:10:33] he come up against something that he
[1:10:35] know not what to do
[1:10:37] that was the Red Sea but what happened
[1:10:41] the Seed of Abraham was promised to
[1:10:44] possess the enemy's Gates
[1:10:46] so when the Red Sea become a gate that
[1:10:49] he couldn't come to God moved upon the
[1:10:52] scene and took the gate and went away
[1:10:54] with it and Moses walked across the sea
[1:10:57] on dry land
[1:11:00] assess the gate
[1:11:01] the Hebrew children
[1:11:03] possess the gates at the fiery furnace
[1:11:06] that could not even burn them Daniel
[1:11:09] possessed the enemy's gates at the line
[1:11:11] miles it could not be open to eating
[1:11:15] Samson one time caught in the a bunch of
[1:11:19] people uh he faced him in the city and
[1:11:22] when he did he pulled those great big
[1:11:24] Gates out of the Rocks put him up on his
[1:11:27] shoulders and walked up the top of the
[1:11:28] hill why was he he was still in the
[1:11:31] Covenant his locks are still hanging on
[1:11:32] him the promise is still there and he'll
[1:11:34] possess the gates of his enemy hey man
[1:11:38] sir certainly all these died fine
[1:11:42] Warriors of the faith they all died then
[1:11:45] come on the scene the super Seed of
[1:11:49] Abraham the Royal seed the super Royal
[1:11:52] Sea Jesus Christ which was Abraham's
[1:11:55] Faith son
[1:11:57] that he saw by faith through a promise
[1:11:59] of God and he'd bless all be the father
[1:12:02] of many nations his supersede come on
[1:12:04] the sea what do these others do they
[1:12:07] possess the gates of lions the Gates of
[1:12:10] Fire the gates of the sea the gates of
[1:12:12] the city and everywhere they come they
[1:12:14] was able to possess the gates because
[1:12:16] they were promised it but when it come
[1:12:18] to death they all had to die now here
[1:12:21] comes a royal seat on not only did he
[1:12:24] possess the gates of the enemy but he
[1:12:26] possessed the gates of death Hell In The
[1:12:29] Grave rose up on the third day and
[1:12:31] opened up the way
[1:12:33] rent The Veil from top to bottom and
[1:12:37] made a way for every man or woman who
[1:12:39] desired to come to him to come he
[1:12:41] possessed the gates not only did he that
[1:12:43] but those who had died in faith he led
[1:12:46] captivity captive and let's set it on
[1:12:48] high and give gifts unto man
[1:12:50] that's Abraham's supersede that's the
[1:12:54] Royal Sea Jesus Christ the super sign
[1:12:57] remember it was an everlasting sign a
[1:13:00] supernatural Everlasting sign Jesus was
[1:13:05] he arose from the dead they cannot hold
[1:13:07] him death Heller the grave cannot hold
[1:13:09] him Hebrews 13 8 as I said he says same
[1:13:11] yesterday ever to show to show this
[1:13:16] super sign in this age watch let's take
[1:13:18] the path of Abraham just for a moment a
[1:13:21] type of a seed Abraham the prophet watch
[1:13:25] God has spoken to him in many ways since
[1:13:27] he had left the child here the city of
[1:13:29] her he had traveled along and God had
[1:13:31] showed him many great signs that
[1:13:33] appeared to him showed him all kinds of
[1:13:35] things that would happen told him what
[1:13:36] would take place all these things he had
[1:13:38] told him but before he received his
[1:13:42] promised son
[1:13:43] he was standing near the gates of the
[1:13:46] Gentiles just above Sodom and before he
[1:13:50] received uh his his super son or his son
[1:13:54] that was to be born a super son of
[1:13:57] course
[1:13:58] before he received him not the Royal one
[1:14:00] now but before he received him he
[1:14:03] received the super sign
[1:14:06] what was it God came down to him in a
[1:14:10] form of a man
[1:14:13] notice
[1:14:15] that man that talked with him it stood
[1:14:19] at the tent where he was at and
[1:14:21] performed a super sign
[1:14:25] and when his super son came on the scene
[1:14:27] his super Sun performed the same sign to
[1:14:30] show that he was Abraham's supersede
[1:14:33] he's fine
[1:14:34] and he promised the same thing in the
[1:14:37] last days
[1:14:40] you see what I mean
[1:14:43] Abraham before the just before the
[1:14:47] promised son arrived as we were looking
[1:14:49] for now Abraham's seed Royal seed
[1:14:52] that was a natural seed this is a royal
[1:14:55] seed when the national seed got their
[1:14:58] sign they they rejected it
[1:15:00] so have well nothing but the Royal seeds
[1:15:03] still that church seed rejected again
[1:15:05] they've always done it but notice what
[1:15:08] kind of a sign was it let's just look
[1:15:10] see what the super sign was
[1:15:12] there was a man came up three of them
[1:15:15] and did you notice when when Abraham saw
[1:15:18] three men coming
[1:15:19] he went out he said my Lord
[1:15:22] will you pass by me come in and sit down
[1:15:25] let me fetch a little water and wash
[1:15:27] your feet and take a marshall of bread
[1:15:28] then go about your business he saw three
[1:15:30] coming and called the three one lord
[1:15:34] lock the church nominal down down there
[1:15:38] in Sodom he saw two coming and he said
[1:15:40] my lords
[1:15:43] Abraham knowed these 3r1
[1:15:47] there's actually only one of them
[1:15:49] watched two of them went in and Sodom
[1:15:51] and the one stayed with him
[1:15:54] he said my Lord
[1:15:56] notice the one that stayed with him
[1:15:58] Abraham being a type of the called out
[1:16:01] not in Sodom the elected for that hour
[1:16:05] now remember the Gentiles were fixing to
[1:16:08] be burned just like it is now
[1:16:11] the Gentile world is to be destroyed by
[1:16:14] fire we know that
[1:16:16] I watched the super sign God came down
[1:16:20] in a form of a man and performed a sign
[1:16:23] with his back turned to the tent and
[1:16:25] asked where Sarah was
[1:16:27] and Abraham said she's in the tent
[1:16:29] behind you and he said I'm going to
[1:16:33] visit you according to the time of life
[1:16:34] watch that eye see I will visit you and
[1:16:38] while she didn't call him Abram just a
[1:16:40] few days before that he was Abram but
[1:16:41] God changed his name in the spirit
[1:16:43] talking to him but here's God in flesh
[1:16:47] had just eat a calf that Abraham killed
[1:16:50] drinking the milk from the cow and eat
[1:16:52] bread
[1:16:54] think of it a man Dusty clothes dirty
[1:16:57] feet
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] God
[1:17:01] you say it wasn't God Abraham said it
[1:17:04] was
[1:17:05] he said it was Elohim
[1:17:07] the one that created the heavens and the
[1:17:09] Earth the all-sufficient one
[1:17:12] God in a human form amen
[1:17:16] and he performed a sign to Abraham to
[1:17:20] let him know that
[1:17:22] at the Gentile world wasn't in
[1:17:25] and he was that supersede he said where
[1:17:30] is Sarah said she's in the tent behind
[1:17:32] you he said I'm going to visit you
[1:17:33] according to time of life and Sarah did
[1:17:35] something she kind of laughed
[1:17:37] he said why did Sarah laugh
[1:17:40] saying these things can't be he
[1:17:42] perceived the thoughts that was in
[1:17:45] Sarah's mind in the tent behind him and
[1:17:48] he knew that was God now look Jesus when
[1:17:52] he come on the earth he was that super
[1:17:55] seed and when he come he declared to the
[1:17:58] people the very same thing
[1:18:01] is that right
[1:18:02] now knowing that this end time was
[1:18:05] coming and said the things that I do
[1:18:07] shall you the same because God said I'm
[1:18:09] going to give you an eternal Everlasting
[1:18:12] sign amen
[1:18:14] there's a super sign
[1:18:17] look at the track of the church it's
[1:18:18] come up through Luther Wesley
[1:18:20] Pentecostal denominations we've had
[1:18:22] Revelations and all other kinds of
[1:18:24] things we had speaking in tongues we've
[1:18:26] had gifts of healing we have everything
[1:18:28] manifested but look right at the end
[1:18:31] time
[1:18:33] before the burning and to destroy the
[1:18:36] super sign appears mysteriously right on
[1:18:38] the scene again before us amen God
[1:18:41] himself not a man but God faith
[1:18:44] manifests a super sign on Everlasting
[1:18:49] sign an eternal sign a super sign God
[1:18:53] manifested In the Flesh
[1:18:56] same sign that his son did his super son
[1:18:59] promised the same at the end as it was
[1:19:02] in the days of Sodom so shall it be at
[1:19:05] the coming of the son of man
[1:19:07] the super sign will return we've had all
[1:19:11] these other things the path of Abraham's
[1:19:13] Royal seat has come up that same path
[1:19:15] and Abraham come up but just before the
[1:19:18] destroying of the world the super sign
[1:19:22] must appear again on Eternal Everlasting
[1:19:25] Resurrection sign that proves that the
[1:19:28] Royal seed could not be killed like
[1:19:30] Daniel and like the rest of the prophets
[1:19:33] was the grave couldn't hold him because
[1:19:35] he the others conquered the gates of the
[1:19:39] enemy such as fire and lion and sword
[1:19:42] and so forth they conquered that but
[1:19:44] this Royal seed conquered death hell in
[1:19:47] the grave
[1:19:48] nothing could hold him why he's an
[1:19:51] everlasting super sign
[1:19:53] that is a super sign the resurrection of
[1:19:57] Jesus Christ after being dead for 2 000
[1:20:00] years still stands in the midst of us
[1:20:02] the same as he did there manifesting
[1:20:04] himself in his church in human now she's
[1:20:08] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:10] hey man a virgin shall conceive and from
[1:20:14] that time God and that'll be one United
[1:20:17] together
[1:20:18] an everlasting Eternal sign a super sign
[1:20:22] he lives
[1:20:23] he lives Christ Jesus lives today
[1:20:28] you may ask me how an oily as he lives
[1:20:31] within my heart I see him Among Us
[1:20:34] all of his elected seed will see it
[1:20:37] yes sir the elected in his day saw it
[1:20:40] the predestinated got to see it in the
[1:20:43] midst of unbelief they still believed it
[1:20:45] they set right amongst unbelievers and
[1:20:47] still confessed it publicly there you
[1:20:49] are the Son of God of the king of Israel
[1:20:52] home right amongst thousands of
[1:20:55] unbelievers one man by the name of Simon
[1:20:58] Peter walked out he said your name is
[1:21:01] Simon and you're the son of Joseph what
[1:21:03] was that that super sign
[1:21:05] that was a prophet sitting there that
[1:21:08] was a super sign and Simon Peter
[1:21:11] accepted it regardless of what anybody
[1:21:13] said a big old husky uh bully become a
[1:21:16] Meek lamb before god notice that was
[1:21:19] Nathaniel a teacher a scholar indeed who
[1:21:22] believed God
[1:21:24] and uh Philip went over and brought him
[1:21:27] back from this his City brought him over
[1:21:29] when he come Lord Jesus was standing
[1:21:30] Jesus said behold and Israelite indeed
[1:21:33] in whom there is no God he said Rabbi
[1:21:36] when did you know me this is astonishing
[1:21:38] I've heard my great great great great
[1:21:40] grandfathers talk about so and so on so
[1:21:42] and so way back I never heard of him
[1:21:44] how'd you know me Jesus said before
[1:21:46] Philip called you when you were under
[1:21:47] the tree I saw you I super sign amen
[1:21:52] priests and rabbis is finished there was
[1:21:54] God's Eternal super sign
[1:21:57] yes
[1:21:59] he had to go by Samaria remember his
[1:22:01] three races of people ham Sam and
[1:22:03] japheth's people he went by the
[1:22:05] Samaritans there come a little woman out
[1:22:07] at the well to get some water Jesus as
[1:22:10] soon as he spoke to her he said bring me
[1:22:12] a drink she said you have nothing to
[1:22:14] draw with and so forth that a
[1:22:15] conversation went on and talked about
[1:22:17] the racial problem and so forth hey to
[1:22:19] what he said to her go get your husband
[1:22:21] and come here
[1:22:22] now she said this man's trying to get
[1:22:24] smart with me see
[1:22:27] I don't have any husbands that you've
[1:22:29] told the truth you've had five and the
[1:22:31] one you're living with now is not your
[1:22:32] husband
[1:22:34] super sign
[1:22:35] listen at her sir
[1:22:38] I perceive that thou art a prophet
[1:22:41] super sign
[1:22:43] a manifestation of the word for that day
[1:22:46] watch
[1:22:47] you're a prophet but I don't see in the
[1:22:49] Bible where any prophet's supposed to be
[1:22:50] at this time but we are looking for the
[1:22:52] Messiah
[1:22:54] and when he comes he will manifest God's
[1:22:58] promise word
[1:23:00] that poor little woman mode more about
[1:23:02] God than half the preachers of the day
[1:23:05] in that estate why she was predestinated
[1:23:07] to it when that light struck at that
[1:23:09] seed come to life
[1:23:12] and hide it no
[1:23:14] look at Nathanael he didn't care he
[1:23:16] didn't care who stood there he stood
[1:23:18] right before his priest and all said
[1:23:19] Rabbi you're the Son of God you are the
[1:23:22] king of Israel that we look for he saw
[1:23:23] the super sign
[1:23:25] there's still a woman in the midst of
[1:23:27] all the trouble she's in run down
[1:23:29] through the city and said come see a man
[1:23:31] that's told me what I've done isn't this
[1:23:33] the very Messiah isn't that what we're
[1:23:36] looking for
[1:23:38] supersonic
[1:23:39] now remember the Gentiles never got it
[1:23:42] then but they're kept they're receiving
[1:23:44] because God can't change his continuity
[1:23:46] he has to remember he promised it he
[1:23:50] said he would do it he promised he would
[1:23:51] do it and in the last days he would do
[1:23:53] it Jesus said so as it was in the days
[1:23:56] of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of
[1:23:59] the son of man where promised in the
[1:24:02] last days according to Malachi 4 that
[1:24:04] someone would raise up in the last days
[1:24:06] that would try to bring back and Shake
[1:24:09] back all the coldness and all the
[1:24:10] traditions and things and restore the
[1:24:12] faith of the people back to the
[1:24:14] apostolic fathers again to the original
[1:24:16] word
[1:24:18] yes you said that was a that was Elijah
[1:24:21] and John oh no not Elijah in John's time
[1:24:25] was Malachi 3 ma Sam I miss you before
[1:24:28] my Feast because immediately after this
[1:24:31] prophecy went forth the whole world was
[1:24:33] burned up
[1:24:34] two thousand years has passed the world
[1:24:36] wasn't burnt up and the righteous walk
[1:24:37] out on the dust of the of the ashes of
[1:24:39] the wicked brother and sister we are
[1:24:42] living in the days of supermarkets super
[1:24:44] jets super highways super races super
[1:24:47] everything else and there is a super
[1:24:50] sign
[1:24:51] we've had the sign of religion we've had
[1:24:53] the sign of Revival we've had the sign
[1:24:55] of getting together we've had the sign
[1:24:57] of speaking in tongues we've had the
[1:24:59] sign of Healing The Sick we've had all
[1:25:01] these signs but yet we find in the Bible
[1:25:04] that the last sign before the promised
[1:25:06] Sun arrived it was a super sign
[1:25:10] Jesus said as it was then before the
[1:25:12] promised sun arise again that super sign
[1:25:14] would come on the Earth again I declare
[1:25:16] it to you tonight in the name of Jesus
[1:25:18] Christ it's on earth now not only that
[1:25:20] but it's right here among us tonight the
[1:25:23] Holy Ghost God's super signed the
[1:25:25] resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:25:27] it cannot fail it's an eternal sign it
[1:25:31] can never be changed
[1:25:32] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:25:34] it'll never change it's an eternal
[1:25:36] Everlasting sign God manifested in human
[1:25:40] flesh may God made himself known in
[1:25:43] human flesh you leave that to be the
[1:25:45] truth
[1:25:46] with all your heart you believe in
[1:25:49] don't shut yourself up like a turtle in
[1:25:51] a shell if there's any Turtle you take
[1:25:53] the shell out
[1:25:55] let the Holy Spirit come in don't close
[1:25:57] yourself to some Creed or denomination
[1:25:59] brother sister the hour has arrived I
[1:26:02] believe that God's done as much as he's
[1:26:04] going to do the next thing is action of
[1:26:06] the church or either we're going to be
[1:26:07] lost
[1:26:10] I just asked anybody to dispute that to
[1:26:13] be so
[1:26:15] I've asked it around around the world
[1:26:17] and not one time as everybody anybody
[1:26:18] ever tried it they know better
[1:26:21] no better because it's a word
[1:26:26] they want to accept it
[1:26:29] if it's a time don't put it off too long
[1:26:33] many people wanted to accept Jesus they
[1:26:36] thought they'd do it in some other
[1:26:37] convenient time once said
[1:26:39] they won't accept Christ but they put it
[1:26:41] off too long
[1:26:43] some of them tried to get him off their
[1:26:45] hands and tried to wash it off of the
[1:26:46] water pass the buck on to somebody else
[1:26:49] but it backfired it's on your hands
[1:26:51] tonight don't write back in your lap
[1:26:54] Hebrews 13 8 regardless of how many
[1:26:56] counselor churches we have Still Remains
[1:26:59] as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:27:01] and forever
[1:27:02] works that I do if it if his life is in
[1:27:05] you it'll manifest Jesus Christ amen now
[1:27:09] you all can't be that one but you can be
[1:27:12] a part of that with your faith
[1:27:14] all of them couldn't be a Jesus when
[1:27:16] there's on Earth but they could believe
[1:27:17] him and accept the message
[1:27:19] there was one Moses one Elijah one Noah
[1:27:23] on down always been that but the rest of
[1:27:26] them could accept it and they would have
[1:27:28] had no Ministry and there should be
[1:27:30] somebody believe it
[1:27:31] Jesus would have had no Ministry lest
[1:27:33] somebody believed it Paul would have had
[1:27:36] no Ministry let somebody believe it the
[1:27:38] Holy Ghost has got no Ministry by the
[1:27:40] word today unless somebody's willing to
[1:27:42] get away from their Creed and come back
[1:27:44] to the word again
[1:27:46] no matter how well it sure and how real
[1:27:50] a chair it's here now I know it's here
[1:27:54] I feel it I know it's here the word says
[1:27:58] it's your wherever two or three are
[1:27:59] gathered in my name I'm in the midst of
[1:28:01] them
[1:28:02] I truly believe that he's here the same
[1:28:05] yesterday today and forever
[1:28:11] amen
[1:28:13] oh my it wasn't that beautiful
[1:28:17] just just think and as you know brother
[1:28:19] Brandon would go on
[1:28:22] and prove this over and over again by
[1:28:25] turning his back to the audience
[1:28:28] by Discerning the thoughts and intents
[1:28:30] of the heart and say what what was the
[1:28:33] final sign
[1:28:34] it was God
[1:28:36] veiled in human flesh
[1:28:39] speaking to us the words
[1:28:42] of Truth
[1:28:44] um and and we can certainly see and
[1:28:48] understand that this is the way that God
[1:28:51] chose to speak to his church and so I
[1:28:54] just trust that that was a a blessing to
[1:28:56] you tonight I I just I'll never drive
[1:28:59] down the
[1:29:01] road again and look at a great big
[1:29:03] gigantic house and ever look at it the
[1:29:05] same
[1:29:06] I'll just see there's a poor man
[1:29:09] that's trying to do everything
[1:29:12] to get back
[1:29:14] to what his original state was
[1:29:17] and that's what man's trying to do to
[1:29:20] get back to their original state
[1:29:23] because they're Fallen and they want to
[1:29:26] get back to their original state and but
[1:29:29] you can only get back by the way that
[1:29:32] God provides for you to get back
[1:29:35] there wasn't a wide open Choice there
[1:29:38] was a way I am the way the truth the
[1:29:41] life no man comes unto the father but by
[1:29:45] me and what was that way it was a super
[1:29:49] sign have you ever had the the scripture
[1:29:56] of possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:29:59] ever explained so more perfect than that
[1:30:04] how they possessed all the gates
[1:30:06] every time there's a something that
[1:30:09] stopped you from your possession a gate
[1:30:12] that Satan rose up whether it be water
[1:30:14] whether it be fire whether it be this
[1:30:17] and there was one last gate and that was
[1:30:20] death and he possessed that gate and now
[1:30:23] we know we can possess the gates
[1:30:26] of our enemies anything that's standing
[1:30:29] between you and God you can possess that
[1:30:31] what a beautiful explanation of the
[1:30:35] scripture and so we find that that when
[1:30:37] a man's building these big houses
[1:30:39] they're trying to build some because
[1:30:42] there's something in them calling
[1:30:44] because they want to get back and and
[1:30:47] this is what Malachi 4 5 was Luke 17 30
[1:30:50] wherever I will restore the faith I will
[1:30:54] restore the way back to them and that
[1:30:57] way was the way that God provided in
[1:31:00] this day through the ministry of the son
[1:31:03] of man and there's no other way to get
[1:31:08] there
[1:31:09] isn't that beautiful
[1:31:12] isn't it just
[1:31:14] wonderful
[1:31:16] and you've been privileged
[1:31:19] to have the isab
[1:31:21] to see it it can only be revealed to the
[1:31:26] predestinated don't be ashamed
[1:31:29] of this gospel it's the life
[1:31:32] I I know a lot of people they don't like
[1:31:36] the product that the message produces
[1:31:39] so they try to change the product let me
[1:31:42] tell you the product of this message is
[1:31:44] the rapture
