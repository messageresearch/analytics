[30:22] opened the seals there of lord and and

[30:48] and we are here to just walk in the
[30:50] complete work of the lord jesus christ
[30:53] father there's nothing new that's going
[30:55] to be said here tonight

[30:58] the faith oh god for the things which
[31:00] have been completed

[31:44] ask us things in the name of the lord
[31:45] jesus christ we pray
[31:47] amen amen it's good to be gathered in
[31:50] the house of god
[31:54] let's open our bibles we'll try not to
[31:57] be too long
[31:58] we'll try not to be long
[32:06] i was thinking about what brethren said
[32:08] they said we could just come to church
[32:09] and read the scripture that would be
[32:12] enough
[32:14] uh let's open our bibles in a scripture
[32:17] that our pastor read last sunday
[32:19] hebrews 11. we're gonna start there
[32:37] yes that's from verse one it says now
[32:39] faith is the substance of things
[32:42] hoped for the evidence of things not
[32:44] seen
[32:46] by it the elders obtain a good report
[32:48] through faith we
[32:49] understand that the world were framed
[32:53] by the word of god and so that things
[32:56] which are seen or made of things that do
[32:59] not appear
[33:00] i just want you to pay attention it says
[33:02] by faith we understand
[33:05] you know oftentimes when we within our
[33:08] minds
[33:09] when we think about faith it means we
[33:12] don't understand
[33:13] it we don't have to understand and i was
[33:15] thinking about it and
[33:16] it just dawned on me that faith is the
[33:19] understanding that you don't have to
[33:21] understand everything
[33:22] that's right
[33:25] you don't have to know how god is going
[33:27] to work it out when is he going to work
[33:29] it out exactly
[33:30] you just understand that it's it's god
[33:32] is going to do it
[33:33] if you promise it in his word it's going
[33:35] to come to pass that's the understanding
[33:37] that faith brings to us
[33:39] it says by faith abel
[33:43] by faith abel offered up often offered
[33:46] up offered up offered unto god a more
[33:49] excellent sacrifice than
[33:52] than cain by which he obtained witness
[33:55] that he was
[33:56] righteous god testifying of his own gift
[33:59] and by and by it being dead
[34:02] yet speaketh by faith enoch was
[34:05] translated that he should not see
[34:07] death and was not found because
[34:11] god had translated him for before his
[34:14] translation he had this testimony
[34:17] that he pleased god it says but without
[34:20] faith
[34:21] it's impossible to please god to please
[34:24] it's impossible to please him for he
[34:26] that cometh to god
[34:27] must believe that he is and that is a
[34:30] rewarder of him
[34:32] that diligently seek him by faith noah
[34:35] being warned of
[34:36] god of god of things
[34:39] not seen as yet move with fear
[34:42] prepare an ark for the saving of his
[34:46] house
[34:48] by which by the which he condemned the
[34:52] world
[34:53] and became heir to the righteousness
[34:56] which is
[34:57] by faith by faith abraham
[35:00] it was when he was called of god when he
[35:02] was called to go out
[35:04] into a place which uh
[35:07] which should after receive for
[35:10] inheritance obeyed
[35:12] and went out not knowing wherein they
[35:15] went by faith he's so adjourned in the
[35:17] land of promise
[35:19] as as in a stranger it's his country
[35:23] dwelling
[35:23] in tabernacles with isaac and jacob
[35:27] the heirs with him of the same promise
[35:30] for he looked for a city which
[35:33] he had which which had foundation
[35:37] whose build and maker was god and
[35:39] through faith also
[35:40] sarah herself received strength to
[35:43] receive the seed
[35:45] and was delivered a child when she was
[35:48] past the age because he's so adjourned
[35:52] he so because she judged him faithful
[35:56] who had promised therefore
[35:59] sprung there even even of
[36:03] one and him as good as dead
[36:07] so many of the stars of the sky and
[36:10] multitude
[36:11] and and as the sense
[36:14] which is by the the shore immutable
[36:17] innumerable
[36:19] it says these die all in faith not
[36:21] having received the promise but having
[36:23] seen them far off were persuaded of
[36:27] them and embraced them and confessed
[36:30] that there were strangers in pilgrim on
[36:33] the earth
[36:34] for they that say
[36:38] such things declare plainly
[36:41] that they seek a country it says and
[36:44] truly
[36:45] if they had been mindful
[36:49] of that country from whence they came
[36:52] out
[36:53] they might have had the opportunity to
[36:56] have returned
[36:57] but now they desire a better country
[37:01] that is in heavenly wherefore
[37:04] god is not ashamed to be called their
[37:07] god
[37:08] for he had prepared for them a city
[37:12] by faith abraham when he was tried
[37:15] offered up isaac and he had received the
[37:18] promise
[37:19] offered him only on for his only
[37:22] begotten son
[37:23] of whom he was it was said
[37:26] that in isaac shall the seed be called
[37:30] a accounting that god accounting that
[37:33] god was able to raise him up
[37:35] even from the dead from whence he also
[37:38] received him
[37:39] in a figure
[37:43] by faith isaac blessed jacob and eso and
[37:46] received things
[37:47] and and concerning things to come
[37:51] by faith jacob when he was dying
[37:54] blessed both sons joseph
[37:57] and worship and worship and leaning upon
[38:00] the top
[38:01] of his staff by faith joseph when he
[38:04] died made mention
[38:06] of the of the departing of the children
[38:08] of israel
[38:09] and gave them commandment concerning his
[38:12] bones
[38:12] by faith moses when he was born
[38:16] was hid three months of his
[38:19] parents because they saw he had he was
[38:22] it was a proper child because they they
[38:25] saw he was proper child
[38:27] and they were not afraid of the king's
[38:30] commandment
[38:31] by faith moses when he saw when
[38:34] he he was come to years refused to be
[38:38] called
[38:38] the son of pharaoh's daughter let's also
[38:42] turn
[38:42] one more scripture back in mark i
[38:45] believe it's mark
[38:58] 11.
[39:00] and let's start from verse 20.
[39:04] it says and and in the morning as they
[39:07] passed by
[39:10] they saw the fig tree dried up from the
[39:13] roots
[39:15] and peter called to remember and said
[39:18] unto him
[39:19] master behold the fig tree which thou
[39:22] curseth is withered away and jesus
[39:25] answered and said unto them
[39:27] have faith in god for verily verily
[39:31] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[39:34] shall say unto this mountain
[39:36] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[39:39] the sea
[39:40] shall not doubt in his heart but shall
[39:44] believe
[39:45] that those things which he hath said
[39:47] shall come to pass
[39:49] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[39:52] therefore i say unto you what so what
[39:55] what
[39:56] what things soever ye desire when he
[39:59] prayed
[40:00] believe that ye receive them and ye
[40:03] shall have them
[40:06] and when he stand praying forgive
[40:08] forgive forgive
[40:11] if ye have art against against any
[40:15] that your father also
[40:18] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[40:21] trespasses
[40:22] but if you don't you do not forgive
[40:25] neither will your father
[40:26] which is in heaven forgive you your
[40:28] trespasses
[40:30] that's why i had father we ask you bless
[40:31] your word in the name of jesus christ
[40:33] you pray amen
[40:34] may have your seats tonight
[40:42] i just want to speak for a few minutes
[40:44] there was just uh
[40:47] something that that came to my heart
[40:50] even as our pastor was talking about
[40:54] faith last sunday
[40:56] um and i i've i've been
[41:01] i've been studying on on the the
[41:04] perfect faith and just going over and
[41:07] some of the things that brother branham
[41:09] says to
[41:09] to just understand the even the very
[41:12] context of what he speaks in that book
[41:15] we we know if you read it you one of the
[41:18] things you realize is
[41:20] the creation of the scroll was a
[41:22] challenge
[41:23] that god gave him god wanted to elevate
[41:26] his faith here he was and he was
[41:29] trying to find some food to eat and he
[41:31] had
[41:32] hunted and done everything that he could
[41:34] and he didn't have it
[41:36] and and something within his heart and
[41:38] he heard the voice he said well why did
[41:39] you just speak it
[41:41] and so and he stood there and we know
[41:44] the story of
[41:45] all the stages that he went through
[41:48] trying to think it was just
[41:50] going out of his own mind and the things
[41:52] and speaking the squirrel and asking for
[41:54] some
[41:55] completely unreasonable
[41:58] way that the scroll will get to the
[42:00] place just because he wanted to make
[42:02] sure that he was in a vision he wanted
[42:04] to make sure
[42:05] is this really happening and and then he
[42:08] we went so when he preached that message
[42:10] perfect faith he's basically
[42:12] encouraging us or trying to bring us to
[42:15] a place
[42:16] where we could be lifted up in a place
[42:18] and he says
[42:19] this is to help to rub some of the
[42:22] unbelievable some of the make-believe i
[42:24] think he says that's the word he uses
[42:26] i'm trying to rob some of the
[42:28] make-believe and some of the things to
[42:30] get you to the place and
[42:32] and and to get us to a place where we
[42:34] can actually come
[42:35] into contact with god and receive the
[42:38] type of faith that we desire
[42:40] and out tonight i want to just speak
[42:44] for a little bit i want to speak on
[42:46] faith
[42:47] inspires a faith a faith inspired
[42:50] attitude a faith inspired attitude and i
[42:54] just thought in my heart that
[42:56] real faith inspires an attitude um
[43:00] a person who believes you you don't see
[43:02] them
[43:03] walking with the head down and wondering
[43:06] what am i going to eat tomorrow
[43:07] what's going to happen to me today and
[43:09] you know
[43:11] they're not moved by natural
[43:13] circumstances
[43:14] and and and to me that's such a paradox
[43:18] because
[43:19] in most circumstances we all move by the
[43:22] things that goes
[43:23] around us and even speaking to myself
[43:26] and and to me even as speaking of this
[43:30] it's more something that my heart is
[43:32] desiring to acquire
[43:34] to receive to to move up to it's not
[43:37] necessarily just some type of education
[43:39] something that we read we say what
[43:41] branham says and we try to repeat it
[43:43] but but how do we get how do i get
[43:46] myself to become to the place
[43:49] where i can receive the type of faith
[43:51] that even our prophet is speaking of
[43:53] because i realize it seems like our
[43:56] attitude depends on what's happening on
[43:58] that day
[43:59] you know if things seems to fall apart
[44:01] the whole day
[44:02] my my i mean so is the attitude
[44:05] it seems like you know it just seems
[44:07] like oh i wish you know i had hoped this
[44:09] was going to go okay but it didn't i
[44:11] hope that one
[44:12] you know i i did everything i could so
[44:14] this could work out how did it go wrong
[44:16] and
[44:17] and and we seem to be and and if you
[44:19] woke up in the day where everything went
[44:21] away
[44:24] not sure what's going on here so is your
[44:26] attitude you feel like oh you know your
[44:28] attitude is great and you know you have
[44:30] a smile on your face and
[44:32] and you you feel like your faith is just
[44:34] you know reason up a little more
[44:36] you feel like god is hearing you and in
[44:38] a day's way it doesn't go like plan
[44:41] the heaven is shut up god is no longer
[44:43] interested in you
[44:45] you know he's forsaken you and he's
[44:48] pulled out all his blessings
[44:50] he taught that you are not the child
[44:52] that he taught you where
[44:53] you know all everything falls apart but
[44:56] how do we get to a place where we are
[44:58] not
[44:58] moved how do we get to a place where we
[45:01] are not
[45:02] shaken how do we get to a place it
[45:04] doesn't matter what's going on outside
[45:07] i'm going to stand here because the word
[45:09] of god said so
[45:11] because he promised and he's able to
[45:13] keep the promise
[45:15] so as i said you know the the the the
[45:18] the attitude and an inspired
[45:20] attitude the faith that that is that
[45:23] inspires an
[45:24] attitude when you read the word attitude
[45:27] it speaks about
[45:28] it it's uh and and it says it's a subtle
[45:31] way of thinking
[45:33] it's a feeling for someone or something
[45:36] typically
[45:37] is uh is it says it's reflected in a
[45:39] person's behavior
[45:41] so so one cannot claim to have faith
[45:44] and not not being reflected in the
[45:46] behavior so the attitude and the faith
[45:49] is directly connected
[45:51] because the person who has faith it's
[45:53] reflected in the attitude
[45:55] i was thinking about the prophet speaks
[45:56] about the slave from africa
[45:59] who was brought and he said that they
[46:01] took him and they
[46:02] took him and he was the son of a king
[46:04] and they took him and yeah he was in the
[46:06] strange place where he didn't know
[46:08] anybody and yet he was in sleeping with
[46:10] other slaves and everything and
[46:12] and yet the prophet said there was
[46:14] something different about this
[46:16] particular slave
[46:17] because when they came they realized
[46:19] everything they assigned him to do he
[46:21] did it perfectly
[46:23] and he did it he never wandered he never
[46:25] questioned he never
[46:26] he did everything orderly and he wasn't
[46:29] uh his wall didn't fall apart like the
[46:32] others where they lost hope
[46:34] and even though he knew perhaps he'll
[46:37] never go home
[46:38] even though he knew that that was
[46:40] perhaps the end of him
[46:42] but one thing that was different about
[46:44] this slave but him says that he knew
[46:46] who he was and that he knew that he was
[46:49] a son of a king
[46:51] he knew that as it was he was
[46:53] representative of a certain country and
[46:55] a certain place
[46:57] so the things around him didn't face him
[46:59] the world around him didn't cause him to
[47:01] fall into pieces
[47:03] and i began to think about it and i
[47:05] began to think even about myself
[47:07] it's very important we realize that we
[47:09] are not of this world
[47:12] and i want to say this this world could
[47:15] fall apart
[47:16] and it is falling apart your life can
[47:19] fall apart
[47:21] your the whole world you could lose your
[47:24] house you could lose your family you
[47:25] could lose everything
[47:27] what is it that's so important more than
[47:29] the eternal life that god
[47:31] has given you to come to the place where
[47:34] you realize that this life can be taken
[47:36] away
[47:37] i have another life already inside of me
[47:41] and there's another body already waiting
[47:43] for me
[47:45] and the reason why we fall apart because
[47:47] our focus
[47:48] becomes on the present we we we forget
[47:52] the blessings that's upon us we forget
[47:54] everything
[47:55] you know something goes wrong directly
[47:57] we go read the book of job and
[47:59] uh we sympathize with job and we forget
[48:02] that we're still sleeping in the house
[48:04] we have a car to drive
[48:06] we have food in the pantry we feel like
[48:08] oh i'm job and all my life is falling
[48:10] apart and
[48:11] oh i i have this sickness and directly
[48:14] we we feel like we have
[48:15] boiled like job had and we feel we have
[48:18] all those things and
[48:19] and yet we are some of the black blessed
[48:22] people there are on the face of the
[48:24] earth
[48:25] as and yet we are compared to other
[48:27] christians in other country
[48:29] we have it more than anybody
[48:34] how do we move from there and get to a
[48:36] place where we have a faith that is
[48:38] inspired
[48:39] a faith that inspires an attitude in us
[48:42] to realize that
[48:43] i have been blessed here and no one is
[48:46] going to move me
[48:47] until god is done with me
[48:51] jesus didn't create that faith within
[48:54] himself
[48:55] faith is a gift of god god placed
[48:57] something within him
[48:59] and he knew without a shadow of a doubt
[49:01] based on the relationship that he had
[49:04] with god
[49:04] that i have been placed here for a
[49:06] purpose
[49:11] so it says an attitude is a manner or
[49:13] it's a disposition
[49:16] it's a feeling of a position it's a feel
[49:19] a feeling or position etc it's regard a
[49:22] personal
[49:23] thing it's a tendency or orientation
[49:26] especially of the mind
[49:28] so you can have an orientation towards
[49:31] negativity or positivity towards
[49:34] something
[49:35] it's a thinking where something is going
[49:37] on and
[49:38] and and the mind begin to wander or
[49:41] something
[49:42] you think about it as a other uh as
[49:45] something being positive or being
[49:46] completely negative
[49:48] but adam speaks and he says this in the
[49:50] message
[49:51] uh uh moses he says he says now
[49:54] and and and i want you to to see how
[49:56] he's bringing this out it says now
[49:59] the only thing the only thing
[50:02] the only thing that is for you that is
[50:05] for you is to stimulate your
[50:06] is to stimulate the faith of the people
[50:10] that they might see god god's
[50:13] willingness to heal the people
[50:15] it says now as far as it comes to
[50:19] healing
[50:20] it's your faith in god
[50:24] your pastor can anoint you with oil
[50:29] at your own church and your faith in god
[50:33] will bring the same result now
[50:36] yeah and i want to say this it's it's in
[50:39] the atonement
[50:41] it's not something that somebody brings
[50:43] to you
[50:45] it's in the atonement it's in the price
[50:47] that was paid for
[50:48] it's part of calvary it's the benefit of
[50:51] calvary
[50:52] it's part of the work that god has
[50:54] already completed
[50:55] so as we sit here it's very important we
[50:58] realize
[50:59] as far as the work of god it's all
[51:02] completed
[51:03] we're not sitting here talking about a
[51:05] work that needs to be done
[51:07] that needs to be performed no the our
[51:10] faith gets us into a place where we
[51:13] receive that work
[51:15] where we walk into that work and it
[51:17] comes to pass within our life but as far
[51:19] as god is concerned the work is already
[51:21] completed
[51:22] so now he says god is a healer no ma he
[51:25] says
[51:26] no man is a healer god is a healer these
[51:29] gifts are only to show you
[51:32] what god's attitude towards the people
[51:36] what what's god's attitude towards the
[51:38] people to get you
[51:40] back to believe in god because
[51:43] if you haven't got faith enough to
[51:46] believe for your sickness
[51:47] for your sick body you haven't got
[51:49] enough faith to believe in rapture
[51:52] so now here he is is telling us these
[51:55] things are done
[51:56] so we can uh have our faith lifted up
[52:00] so we can come into such a faith where
[52:03] we can come to the place where we
[52:04] realize
[52:05] god's a healer nothing is going to
[52:07] change that
[52:08] you you can die of sickness today it
[52:11] doesn't mean god has stopped healing
[52:14] that's in the disposition of god and
[52:16] what he wants to do with you
[52:18] but as far as god is concerned his what
[52:20] it was
[52:21] in the beginning is still the same today
[52:24] he hasn't changed one bit
[52:26] so where we where where we come short is
[52:29] when we think
[52:30] that everything that god is in regards
[52:33] to us
[52:34] it changes based on who we are or it
[52:36] changes based on where we are
[52:38] no god is wanting to move us forward
[52:41] into faith
[52:42] so we can receive all of those blessings
[52:44] that are waiting for us
[52:48] so here he is he's showing what is god's
[52:51] attitude towards man
[52:52] god wants you to be healed god wants you
[52:55] to be safe
[52:56] god wants you to be prosperous he died
[52:59] for you he gave his life for you
[53:03] he he he done all that he could his
[53:05] attitude
[53:06] in fact says that he died for the sin of
[53:09] the whole world
[53:11] that's the kind of god he is he's not a
[53:13] a
[53:14] god who hates you he's not a god who's
[53:16] against you
[53:17] he's not a god who thinks evil about you
[53:20] he's a god who loves you
[53:22] even the evil that comes upon you is to
[53:24] return you back in the path that he
[53:26] wants for you to be
[53:30] and if we can come into that mindset
[53:33] it helps us come to the place where the
[53:36] the things that happen around us will
[53:38] not have to move us
[53:40] because we understand that all things
[53:42] work together for the good
[53:43] of them that love him all it is is god
[53:46] trying to bring me in the path that he's
[53:49] predestinated for me to be
[53:51] i don't have to worry about outside all
[53:53] i care about is what my father thinks
[53:58] god's attitude towards us he says
[54:02] that's what that's what he says and he
[54:04] continues on it says
[54:06] he says now
[54:10] i see now
[54:14] it says i see now
[54:17] if i could get my version of showing you
[54:21] god's attitude towards healing
[54:24] he says if you've been preaching divine
[54:28] healing and practice divine healing
[54:30] through the age
[54:32] and you have the gospel of the holy
[54:34] spirit then brother sister
[54:36] the same result would come right here
[54:41] this afternoon by healing it was the
[54:44] holy ghost
[54:46] it was it was by the holy ghost
[54:50] you believe that sure but when i got to
[54:53] preaching
[54:54] when i got to preaching of the of the
[54:56] power of the holy ghost
[54:58] and he began to take the word of god
[55:02] and place it out there it says every
[55:05] holy ghost filled child
[55:07] will reach out and grab that and grab
[55:10] and grab it like that my
[55:14] they they grab it they grab it right out
[55:17] it helps it says it's a they're
[55:20] hungering for it
[55:22] brother if you will turn around and
[55:25] realize he was wounded for your
[55:27] transgression
[55:30] you talk about god's attitude uh
[55:33] you know while we were yet sinner and
[55:35] i'll say this
[55:36] it will take us eternity to even
[55:38] comprehend the very love of god
[55:41] that it will allow even for us to come
[55:43] down as sinners
[55:45] and it will allow us to do all kinds of
[55:47] things our mind wanted to do
[55:49] it'll allow us to spew out all kind of
[55:52] nonsense and
[55:53] say all kinds of things we wanted and be
[55:55] caught up in all kinds of sin
[55:57] but yet he made a provision that one day
[55:59] will be changed
[56:03] you think about the love of god and that
[56:06] it would he send his only begotten
[56:08] pervador says it's not even that he sent
[56:10] his son but he himself will come
[56:13] and and and dwell in the mortal body and
[56:16] give
[56:16] the life of the only one who couldn't
[56:19] give his life
[56:20] who shouldn't give his life the only one
[56:22] who could condemn
[56:23] the only one who could stand and say i
[56:25] have the right to destroy the whole
[56:28] thing
[56:30] that he will come in and give his life
[56:32] and and through your stumbling and your
[56:34] failing
[56:35] and everything and and he's watching you
[56:38] as a baby just stepping out of sin and
[56:40] out
[56:40] and and go and mess up your faith and
[56:43] all and it's just watching and watching
[56:45] and being patient with you oh i tell you
[56:48] just just breaks the heart
[56:50] to realize that he could have taken your
[56:52] life away
[56:53] for one cuts word he had the right to do
[56:56] it
[56:58] but yet he let you live so that i can do
[57:01] what
[57:01] oh i say like david it says if you let
[57:04] this mortal leaves i'll praise you
[57:07] it says i just one more person just one
[57:09] more body
[57:10] all i want to use the whole strength
[57:12] that you have given me
[57:14] every aorta every strength within my
[57:16] body
[57:17] i want to use it to praise you
[57:20] why because there is no god like he is
[57:23] there's never been one even closer to
[57:25] him
[57:26] he's the creator of heaven and earth and
[57:27] he hasn't changed
[57:31] he would allow us to come to a place
[57:34] where
[57:35] we can even come into the knowledge of
[57:37] him
[57:38] and he would call us for a fellowship to
[57:40] come and sit around the table
[57:42] he will open to us the mysteries of the
[57:45] seven seals and
[57:46] the future homes and the serpent seas
[57:49] and all this thing
[57:50] so we can come into a fellowship like
[57:52] we've never known before
[57:58] but madame said i used to think god was
[58:01] against me
[58:02] that he hated me he was mad at me
[58:07] uh he was against it and and oftentimes
[58:10] that's the picture we get
[58:12] that's a picture that's a a mind
[58:16] you know that's why the scripture says
[58:18] that
[58:19] the the the faith is the substance of
[58:22] things not
[58:23] seen even as our pastor was preaching
[58:26] in other words we with the the evidence
[58:28] of faith
[58:30] is not found within our five senses
[58:33] if you get to a place where you can
[58:35] touch it you can explain it you can
[58:37] understand it
[58:38] it's no longer by faith it's no longer
[58:41] by phrase then it becomes by your mind
[58:43] it becomes by the senses but faith is
[58:46] the evidence of not
[58:47] seeing not seen what is the evidence of
[58:50] things not saying
[58:51] you as a right sinner who walked in sin
[58:54] couldn't save yourself couldn't do
[58:56] anything good about yourself
[58:58] one day you heard about the gospel you
[59:01] had faith dropped within your heart
[59:03] and through that faith god comes and he
[59:05] deposits something within your heart
[59:08] the holy spirit start quickens the seed
[59:10] that was inside of you
[59:12] and causes you to live a life that's
[59:14] clean compared to what you were living
[59:16] before
[59:17] what did that faith came to action
[59:22] the evidence is not found you you you
[59:25] couldn't
[59:26] it's like a pig in the in in a pigpen
[59:29] trying to clean himself with the water
[59:31] around him
[59:34] the evidence of it is not within the
[59:37] things of the world
[59:38] the earth cannot provide it science
[59:41] cannot provide it
[59:42] the things around cannot provide what
[59:44] can provide it is if you tap into this
[59:47] defined god
[59:48] by faith he drops it down and he makes
[59:50] it a reality within your life
[59:56] he says and jesus asked a question
[1:00:01] let me skip this it says this in
[1:00:02] unchanging god it says
[1:00:04] therefore if god's attitude towards one
[1:00:07] sinner
[1:00:08] and towards one sinner
[1:00:12] and wanted to repent and adam and eve
[1:00:15] and god made a way for them to repent
[1:00:18] and forgive them and forgive them
[1:00:22] that sinner and then he says
[1:00:25] and the next sinner comes god
[1:00:28] has got to do the same thing to that
[1:00:31] sinner
[1:00:32] it says oh or he did wrong when he acted
[1:00:35] the first
[1:00:36] for the first sinner it says and if a
[1:00:39] man was sick
[1:00:40] and god healed one man then is
[1:00:44] then if he ever if if ever another comes
[1:00:48] to god he's got to do the same thing
[1:00:52] he says he or he did wrong when he
[1:00:54] healed the first one
[1:00:56] if he comes he says if he comes on the
[1:00:59] same ground
[1:01:00] it says what a resting place
[1:01:04] for the soul that's seeking refuge
[1:01:10] a rest for a christian to know that i
[1:01:12] have a place
[1:01:14] i have a god i have a place where i can
[1:01:17] put
[1:01:17] all that i am in and i know that i'll
[1:01:19] get the same result every time
[1:01:21] to know that there's a person there's a
[1:01:24] god who died for me and he gave his life
[1:01:26] for me
[1:01:26] and i can reap the benefits of it and
[1:01:29] and live a life not having to worry
[1:01:31] about that anymore
[1:01:32] knowing that he made a way and that was
[1:01:34] the perfect way
[1:01:35] he didn't make a way so he can come back
[1:01:37] and take it out he made a way so you can
[1:01:40] continue
[1:01:43] now what i'm saying says it says
[1:01:47] and then it says and then and
[1:01:50] and jesus asked a question it says when
[1:01:53] i return to the earth
[1:01:55] will i find faith it says
[1:01:58] there's got to be a church full of faith
[1:02:03] and god god send these things down
[1:02:07] to stimulate faith our faith
[1:02:10] to prove what faith is
[1:02:14] it says see what i mean those things
[1:02:18] that's the way it can operate now
[1:02:22] now i want you now to listen to what he
[1:02:24] says now
[1:02:25] he he he he's discerning on the prayer
[1:02:27] line he speaks now
[1:02:28] he talks and he says
[1:02:32] he speaks in in the tape there's a black
[1:02:35] spot he says
[1:02:36] it says please at blank spots it says it
[1:02:38] says
[1:02:39] uh very highly elated when
[1:02:43] it says when when they give
[1:02:46] their prayer card when they got the
[1:02:48] prayer when they gave the prayer card
[1:02:50] you know the first the first night here

[1:03:06] being my neighbor you know those things
[1:03:09] that are godly that are godly
[1:03:12] that are godly the truth is that right
[1:03:15] he says that's right
[1:03:17] it says if you'll do this if you will
[1:03:20] solemnly believe
[1:03:21] now which which which you know
[1:03:24] i'm telling you the truth all right
[1:03:27] now if you believe you if you believe

[1:04:43] this
[1:04:43] is the prophet speaking to this woman uh
[1:04:46] based upon what she had heard
[1:04:48] in other words we could see as it comes
[1:04:49] in a prayer line but what i'm going to
[1:04:51] say well
[1:04:52] you know you you have this and you have
[1:04:54] this will detect whatever this

[1:05:05] want to say this
[1:05:06] the word of god did the same thing with
[1:05:08] you
[1:05:09] it came and it detected your sin it
[1:05:12] detected your weakness
[1:05:13] it detected your down part it told you
[1:05:16] everything about who you were
[1:05:17] and he didn't just stop there now he
[1:05:19] came and he says
[1:05:21] that you are not what you are supposed
[1:05:22] to be now that before the foundation
[1:05:25] god made you to be his son or his
[1:05:27] daughter and move forward to that
[1:05:29] display destination
[1:05:31] oh i tell you i want to send you tonight
[1:05:33] and say i'm moving in that direction
[1:05:35] with happiness
[1:05:38] what are we supposed to be down about
[1:05:41] he's giving us eternal life
[1:05:42] he told us we'll inherit the world it
[1:05:45] will never inherit everything
[1:05:47] he's given us food to eat it's giving us
[1:05:49] a place to sleep
[1:05:50] he's giving us a place to worship him
[1:05:52] he's giving us brothers and sisters that
[1:05:54] we can come
[1:05:55] and gather together with what have we
[1:05:57] said of hell
[1:06:01] you say well this is just a prayer line
[1:06:03] now listen to what it says
[1:06:05] i want you to be the happiest person in
[1:06:08] texas while you are here
[1:06:09] and when you get to indiana be the next
[1:06:12] happiest person because
[1:06:14] i'll be back right there
[1:06:19] oh i tell you i tell you we got to be
[1:06:21] competing in happiness
[1:06:23] not in sadness we got and i'm not
[1:06:26] talking about competition in the sense
[1:06:27] of the natural
[1:06:28] i'm talking about being one that's
[1:06:30] positive all the time
[1:06:32] i'm not talking about just a a a
[1:06:34] show-off or
[1:06:35] a put-on or something but one that
[1:06:37] realizes
[1:06:38] that i'm here because god blessed me
[1:06:41] here
[1:06:41] and his word identified who i am his
[1:06:45] word told me that i was a sinner
[1:06:47] it was word talked about how i was to
[1:06:49] come in this world
[1:06:50] but the same word told me that even
[1:06:53] though i came in the way that i came
[1:06:55] but that was not my beginning my
[1:06:57] beginning was in his mind
[1:07:04] we have to believe something we have to
[1:07:06] walk by something
[1:07:08] and i believe that oftentimes we walk by
[1:07:10] our minds
[1:07:11] by the tormenting by the things that the
[1:07:14] devil is approaching us
[1:07:15] and yet we are not realizing it what we
[1:07:18] are well whatever
[1:07:19] says he he comes to me and he he says oh
[1:07:22] you have no frames and nobody loves you
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:24] and he comes and he tries to bring me
[1:07:26] down he says i remembers it
[1:07:28] and then he says and when when when
[1:07:30] those things come and god comes on the
[1:07:32] scene
[1:07:32] i point back to him and says tell me
[1:07:34] what this is now
[1:07:39] tell me who this is now you know he'll
[1:07:42] come and put sickness upon you and
[1:07:44] put all kinds of things and try to show
[1:07:46] you that you're not what you were
[1:07:47] supposed to be and all those things that
[1:07:49] oh look at you you fall again and
[1:07:51] everything oh next time remind him he
[1:07:53] says
[1:07:54] when you're standing on the mountain top
[1:07:56] reminding him he said
[1:07:57] how did i get here there's a god who
[1:08:00] blessed me here
[1:08:01] there's a god who died for my sin i'm
[1:08:04] here
[1:08:04] just reaping the benefits of what was
[1:08:06] offered at calvary
[1:08:08] i'm here walking in the revelation of
[1:08:11] what our messenger gave us
[1:08:18] sorry i i think i forgot my phone it was
[1:08:20] in my pocket let me just silence every
[1:08:22] minute
[1:08:27] but one of them says we have the devil's
[1:08:29] answer
[1:08:31] and the devil's answer is the
[1:08:33] manifestation of the word
[1:08:35] it's you the devil's answer is not
[1:08:39] it's not a dead letter because the dead
[1:08:41] letter has been courted by all the
[1:08:43] churches
[1:08:44] it's been courted everywhere and the
[1:08:46] devil looks at it
[1:08:47] in fact he goes and he sits around
[1:08:53] but there has to be a group of people
[1:08:55] which are the manifestation of the
[1:08:57] letter
[1:08:58] they are moved by the spirit that wrote
[1:09:00] the letter
[1:09:01] and when they come into manifestation
[1:09:04] those are the ones that the devil is
[1:09:05] afraid of
[1:09:08] my brother how faith has to inspire an
[1:09:11] attitude
[1:09:12] an attitude that looks at the devil and
[1:09:14] say i have been
[1:09:16] i'm the weapon that's been made to
[1:09:18] defeat you
[1:09:22] i am the weapon how come you the weapon
[1:09:25] i am the word of god that says that
[1:09:28] there will be a bride in the last age
[1:09:30] i am the word of god that says that the
[1:09:33] manifestation of jesus christ
[1:09:36] will be in his bright body i am the
[1:09:39] manifestation of it says
[1:09:40] that we shall come anywhere that will
[1:09:43] put the devil under our feet
[1:09:45] that the seed of abraham will be
[1:09:46] manifested in the end time
[1:09:48] not the jews but a group of people which
[1:09:52] are part of the royal seed
[1:09:53] by the same faith that abraham has that
[1:09:56] will come and walk upon the face of the
[1:09:58] earth
[1:09:59] i tell you that's what i desire most
[1:10:04] if we fail to obtain to our inheritance
[1:10:07] then we are no different
[1:10:09] we're just another group of of of of
[1:10:12] gathering and
[1:10:13] well you know we might as well call
[1:10:14] ourselves a different name
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:17] but there's a manifestation of this hour
[1:10:20] that's groaning within the hearts of the
[1:10:23] believer
[1:10:24] and they can taste it they've come close
[1:10:26] to it
[1:10:28] god is as well the chief wave in front
[1:10:30] of them
[1:10:31] they've seen it and nothing is going to
[1:10:33] stop them because
[1:10:34] they desire that more than anything the
[1:10:37] world can offer
[1:10:47] so when you get back to indiana be the
[1:10:49] next happiest person
[1:10:52] because i'm coming back right there
[1:11:03] i want to say let's not be driven
[1:11:08] the scripture says let this mind be in
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:12] that was also in christ who taught it
[1:11:15] not
[1:11:16] robbery to be equal with god
[1:11:20] now we know but when i made the
[1:11:22] statement on
[1:11:24] hundreds of times it says the right
[1:11:27] mental attitude
[1:11:29] to the divine promise will bring forth
[1:11:32] the good
[1:11:33] and i'm paraphrasing it and i want to
[1:11:35] ask you tonight
[1:11:37] what was jesus mental attitude
[1:11:41] what was his attitude the scripture says
[1:11:45] but says in perfect faith that he
[1:11:47] believed
[1:11:48] everything that the word said about him
[1:11:56] he believed everything that the word
[1:12:00] said about him
[1:12:02] we're going to go in the rapture i
[1:12:03] believe it how is it going to happen
[1:12:07] i don't understand but i understand that
[1:12:10] it's okay for me not to understand
[1:12:19] and i think it's not often time we focus
[1:12:23] on the big things but we are tripped by
[1:12:25] this
[1:12:26] things every day because the scripture
[1:12:28] says you shall be the salt of the earth
[1:12:30] and
[1:12:31] it says that that that the world will
[1:12:34] look upon us then they will
[1:12:35] thirst but how are they going to thirst
[1:12:38] if all i have is this bad attitude if i
[1:12:41] complain like everybody else
[1:12:45] and once bad attitude is there it
[1:12:47] doesn't come along
[1:12:49] it brings its cousin bad atmosphere
[1:12:55] and once bad atmosphere is there then
[1:12:58] things start to go wrong
[1:13:01] it's a chain they're connected
[1:13:08] you know i was going to print it out but
[1:13:10] i think we've heard it many times where
[1:13:13] it talks about the story about brother
[1:13:15] brian i'm washing dishes
[1:13:20] where just the atmosphere in the home
[1:13:23] seemed to not have been riding and
[1:13:26] everything in
[1:13:28] and you know he could have called
[1:13:29] everybody and say let's get on our knees
[1:13:31] and
[1:13:32] let's pray let's cast out all the devil
[1:13:33] that are tormenting you
[1:13:38] he could have
[1:13:42] but he stepped in and he began to just
[1:13:46] do the little things and he began to
[1:13:49] just to spread his own atmosphere
[1:13:52] he begins to just set up the right
[1:13:53] attitude
[1:13:55] and all of the sudden it was all
[1:13:58] contagious
[1:14:03] we we we sometimes
[1:14:06] are brought into despair we are brought
[1:14:10] into
[1:14:10] a place where we we become
[1:14:14] this this this price within our own self
[1:14:17] and and we just feel like the heaven is
[1:14:20] shut down
[1:14:21] and and and it seems like i've been
[1:14:24] trying and it seems like nothing is
[1:14:26] working
[1:14:30] i'd say perhaps we've been trying the
[1:14:32] wrong way
[1:14:34] perhaps we've been not identifying just
[1:14:38] how
[1:14:38] to take control of the situation says
[1:14:41] that
[1:14:42] faith is the master of circumstances
[1:14:46] now and i want to say this having said
[1:14:48] that that means to me
[1:14:51] that circumstances are always going to
[1:14:54] change
[1:14:56] how many here have been in circumstances
[1:14:58] where you thought i think this is the
[1:15:00] end of me
[1:15:03] i think i'm not going to live to pat to
[1:15:06] i'm not going to live to see tomorrow
[1:15:08] i think you know this is it i think god
[1:15:10] is done
[1:15:11] i think i i've done this is the last
[1:15:15] i'm not going to see tomorrow this is it
[1:15:17] and everything
[1:15:18] you're here you're here
[1:15:22] how did you survive that
[1:15:26] it's not in the jurisdiction of your
[1:15:28] thinking to predict what's going to come
[1:15:30] tomorrow
[1:15:31] it's not in the jurisdiction of what
[1:15:34] what's going on around you to determine
[1:15:36] what tomorrow is going to be
[1:15:37] why determining tomorrow is what the
[1:15:39] word says tomorrow is going to come
[1:15:41] that's why parvati says jesus he
[1:15:43] believed
[1:15:44] everything he believed everything that
[1:15:46] the word said about him
[1:15:47] and in believing everything that the
[1:15:49] word was said about him
[1:15:51] he had the confidence to walk in and act
[1:15:54] according to it
[1:15:59] but the things that stop us the most
[1:16:00] part says
[1:16:02] it's the heart condemnation
[1:16:06] we get to a place where we did it here
[1:16:08] we
[1:16:09] we did wrong here we did wrong here then
[1:16:11] when we stand we don't have confidence
[1:16:12] in god
[1:16:18] but i believe we can walk in the path
[1:16:20] where we can stay away from the things
[1:16:22] of the world
[1:16:24] and the god who's the master of all
[1:16:26] things will come and take the
[1:16:28] condemnation away
[1:16:29] you know i i always find it amazing it's
[1:16:32] always the last
[1:16:33] mistake you make is the biggest that's
[1:16:36] right
[1:16:36] you know you'll come and and you you
[1:16:38] make a mistake and
[1:16:39] and and the one that you've been
[1:16:41] thinking about being the biggest is no
[1:16:43] longer the biggest the satan comes and
[1:16:44] says
[1:16:44] oh there you are again i told you you
[1:16:47] were a failure i told you this i told
[1:16:49] you this
[1:16:52] if you follow that direction where are
[1:16:53] you going to end up
[1:16:58] he says but um says
[1:17:02] now all right it says now this is the
[1:17:05] angel of god
[1:17:06] that sends from from jesus christ to
[1:17:08] testify of the church
[1:17:10] in the last day in the last days are
[1:17:13] here
[1:17:14] it says it doesn't he he doesn't heal
[1:17:17] anybody
[1:17:18] but it will help bring your faith up
[1:17:21] to that place to a place and then he
[1:17:24] says and when you are seeing
[1:17:26] a person standing here on the platform
[1:17:30] to you all there and it says how can
[1:17:33] how many here is to be prayed for
[1:17:37] for the meeting it says for the meeting
[1:17:39] meeting closes
[1:17:40] it says let's see your hands it says i
[1:17:43] know
[1:17:43] there's a lot there's a lot over 50 here
[1:17:47] i see
[1:17:48] the prayer card around the holding and
[1:17:50] everything it says now
[1:17:51] notice when god is doing something here
[1:17:54] on the platform
[1:17:56] his attitude towards you out there
[1:18:00] also it says it's his
[1:18:04] attitude towards you out there also you
[1:18:06] believe that
[1:18:08] and while he's being done here on the
[1:18:10] platform remember
[1:18:12] if you believe with all your heart no
[1:18:15] doubt in your heart
[1:18:17] i will assure you god will put it right
[1:18:20] out
[1:18:21] and call you call you who are out there
[1:18:24] and raise you up from the building
[1:18:27] that's right
[1:18:28] now i i and this just hit my mind
[1:18:30] perhaps in a way that he never
[1:18:32] before i want to say this that's why
[1:18:36] it's so important even when we listen to
[1:18:39] those prayer lines
[1:18:40] it's you that is talking to it's
[1:18:43] you that is praying for it's all you
[1:18:47] have to do is take that person
[1:18:49] substitute yourself on that person where
[1:18:52] it is
[1:18:53] put whoever you want in that place and
[1:18:56] the results are bound to be the same
[1:19:00] this is not just us recording an event
[1:19:04] and people shouting and screaming and
[1:19:06] we can hear it and say oh i wish i was
[1:19:09] there i wish i could have been there
[1:19:11] oh god is not bound by time
[1:19:14] it's not bound by space his word is
[1:19:17] eternal so therefore when that is being
[1:19:20] performed
[1:19:21] you might as well put yourself there and
[1:19:23] say i receive it
[1:19:26] [Applause]
[1:19:28] that's the area but i'm saying it says
[1:19:31] faith knows no defeat
[1:19:33] you can't defeat faith because defeating
[1:19:36] faith is defeating god
[1:19:38] it says faith it's got muscles and a
[1:19:41] hairy chest
[1:19:43] in other words when face stands up
[1:19:45] nothing can speak
[1:19:48] amen when when one has already heard
[1:19:51] from god
[1:19:52] and he's standing there there's nothing
[1:19:54] that can move him
[1:19:56] but here we are moved and toast about in
[1:20:00] and and today we think we got our
[1:20:02] healing tomorrow we think we lost it
[1:20:05] you know today we think we delivered and
[1:20:06] tomorrow oh
[1:20:08] i i think it's back again i i think i
[1:20:11] need to go back for prayer and
[1:20:12] everything
[1:20:13] it says if you had perfect faith you
[1:20:14] wouldn't even come to the prayer line
[1:20:22] but how do we get from where we are to
[1:20:25] obtaining it
[1:20:27] and i say this it's to have the same
[1:20:31] disposition
[1:20:33] the same attitude and the same
[1:20:38] coming forth like jesus did because
[1:20:41] remember
[1:20:42] it's his attitude towards the word that
[1:20:46] produced everything
[1:20:47] because he came and he had a certain
[1:20:50] disposition
[1:20:51] a certain understanding that his life
[1:20:55] was given to him for a purpose and that
[1:20:58] he
[1:20:58] was bound to fulfill the purpose for
[1:21:00] which his life was given
[1:21:02] and he knew that god will not take his
[1:21:05] life unless he fulfilled the purpose for
[1:21:07] which he came
[1:21:08] and he knew that he would not be taken
[1:21:10] out of the earth
[1:21:11] that's why he could sleep when the winds
[1:21:13] were tossing
[1:21:17] just imagine that and his disciple came
[1:21:20] and says
[1:21:21] master cannot that we die
[1:21:25] if you die where do i go
[1:21:29] won't we die together
[1:21:38] i think the devil has got a mind and i
[1:21:41] know the battle is in our mind
[1:21:43] but i believe the word of god is a
[1:21:44] weapon but madam says that the word of
[1:21:47] god will defeat the devil
[1:21:48] any place any time under any
[1:21:50] circumstance
[1:21:52] when you take that word you put it
[1:21:53] within your heart with faith
[1:21:55] you are bound to achieve everything that
[1:21:57] god wants you to achieve
[1:22:01] so he says
[1:22:05] he says he speaks about the farmers it
[1:22:08] says now
[1:22:11] what does the farmer do
[1:22:14] he sows wheat well look at the harvest
[1:22:19] the next morning what if he goes out
[1:22:23] there and uncover it
[1:22:25] and says why aren't you sprout
[1:22:29] sprouted there's nothing to it
[1:22:34] i ain't gonna have no wheat well
[1:22:39] he isn't he says then he's not going
[1:22:41] he's not going to have wheat
[1:22:43] if he keeps on digging it up
[1:22:46] looking at it he will never have wheat
[1:22:49] you just saw it and let it alone
[1:22:55] and i think that's where our struggle is
[1:22:58] let it alone
[1:23:00] leave it alone leave it alone you've
[1:23:03] committed in god's hands
[1:23:04] leave it alone you've given it to god
[1:23:07] leave it alone you've done all that you
[1:23:10] could
[1:23:11] you do the man part and let god do the
[1:23:13] god part
[1:23:15] give it to god believe the word i i'll
[1:23:18] i'll tell you
[1:23:19] thinking about when i'm talking about
[1:23:21] how that he was sick to his time he was
[1:23:23] sick and they told him that if he
[1:23:24] continued to eat beans he's gonna die
[1:23:27] he went and he believed that he was
[1:23:28] healed and he continued to eat it
[1:23:30] and he's about to die
[1:23:37] and then i asked myself a question do i
[1:23:41] have the same
[1:23:41] attitude am i displaying that same
[1:23:44] attitude
[1:23:45] am i everywhere in my dealings in my
[1:23:48] things every day when i walk up in the
[1:23:50] morning
[1:23:50] am i displaying that same attitude
[1:23:55] or am i the attitude that i got to go
[1:23:58] dig it up
[1:23:59] let me go check
[1:24:02] perhaps it didn't stick i need to try
[1:24:04] again
[1:24:09] we torment it within our minds and we go
[1:24:11] dig it up
[1:24:12] something happen we go dig it up we go
[1:24:14] dig it up we're going to do
[1:24:15] he says leave it alone
[1:24:23] he says there it is
[1:24:26] it's up to god to bring it forth
[1:24:30] it's up to god to send the reign
[1:24:34] it's you that accept teach you that
[1:24:37] except on the on god's on
[1:24:39] it's you that accept god on his word
[1:24:42] hallelujah
[1:24:43] it's up to god to bring forth his word
[1:24:45] to pass
[1:24:48] you accept the word god brings the word
[1:24:51] to path
[1:24:53] it says no man is worth anything
[1:24:56] any a no man is worth more any more than
[1:24:59] his word
[1:25:00] and god is not worth a bit more than his
[1:25:03] word
[1:25:03] is and i say this with a challenge
[1:25:07] in faith that every promise of god
[1:25:10] will bring forth to pass if you take it
[1:25:13] in the right mental attitude
[1:25:16] that's right look at it and believe it
[1:25:22] i want to say this
[1:25:26] let's have that right man of attitude
[1:25:32] the scripture has gotten promised for
[1:25:35] our age
[1:25:35] and things that not just for our age
[1:25:38] even our personal life that we need to
[1:25:40] see
[1:25:40] we are called to be overcomers of this
[1:25:43] generation
[1:25:44] we are called to overcome the world
[1:25:46] that's around us
[1:25:47] we are influenced by the world but we
[1:25:49] need to overcome it
[1:25:51] we are called to overcome and to bring
[1:25:53] forth the manifestation of the bride of
[1:25:55] this hour
[1:25:56] we are called to overcome individually
[1:25:58] sin within our lives and
[1:26:00] unbelief and the things that torment us
[1:26:02] we are called to take all of that and to
[1:26:04] bring it under subjection
[1:26:06] we are called to come and preach this
[1:26:08] gospel to the sinners
[1:26:12] and how are we going to do that if we
[1:26:15] continually dwell in this kind of
[1:26:20] mindset
[1:26:22] the scripture says god is not a man that
[1:26:25] he should lie
[1:26:29] it's not a son of man that he can come
[1:26:31] and change his mind
[1:26:33] when he speaks his word in fact you find
[1:26:36] it in the world most time
[1:26:38] you know people will say good things
[1:26:40] about you and and think you're the best
[1:26:42] worker and all the things and everything
[1:26:45] you make one mistake and find out what
[1:26:47] you are
[1:26:50] they'll talk and talk your praises today
[1:26:52] and tomorrow
[1:26:53] and tomorrow you become nothing
[1:26:57] that's what the world is suffering oh
[1:26:59] you look at it it's just
[1:27:00] this one there's no perfect person the
[1:27:02] person rises
[1:27:04] my goodness they go dig up every wrong
[1:27:06] that he's ever done
[1:27:13] that's the world but with god it's not
[1:27:16] so
[1:27:17] in fact says if he takes it and he puts
[1:27:20] it in the sea of god forgetfulness
[1:27:22] it's no more to be remembered it's done
[1:27:25] as far as
[1:27:25] is concerned and if a man god digs it up
[1:27:28] it's up between him and god
[1:27:30] as far as god is concerned is done
[1:27:37] i tell you i want to work for this kind
[1:27:38] of god i want to give my life for this
[1:27:41] kind of god
[1:27:42] one who can come and even when i can
[1:27:44] make wrong even when i can
[1:27:46] fall who can come and look at me and say
[1:27:48] son you don't have to worry about
[1:27:50] it it was never about you to begin with
[1:27:52] it's about the work that i'm trying to
[1:27:54] achieve
[1:27:54] i'm just using you as a vessel i'm just
[1:27:57] using your mouthpiece
[1:27:58] and you feel like you have allowed me to
[1:28:00] speak therefore i'll speak to you
[1:28:03] that's what we are called to be
[1:28:05] mouthpieces and nothing more
[1:28:07] the power is god's power the healing is
[1:28:10] god's healing
[1:28:10] they're doing it god's doing oh i tell
[1:28:13] you if we can just do a better job
[1:28:15] speaking and doing the things that he
[1:28:17] wants us to do
[1:28:18] he will fulfill his word because it's
[1:28:21] his promise
[1:28:23] so i say to you that the scripture says
[1:28:26] let this mind that was in christ be also
[1:28:28] in you
[1:28:29] that he taught it not robbery to be
[1:28:31] equal with god
[1:28:33] my brother my sister we have been in
[1:28:35] this generation
[1:28:36] called to be equal with god we have been
[1:28:39] called to be
[1:28:40] god's bride in the image of god in the
[1:28:44] world like he was
[1:28:45] in the same property that he was have
[1:28:47] the same attribute
[1:28:49] like he did we have not been called to
[1:28:52] be any lower
[1:28:57] and if we can only accept that if we can
[1:29:00] only walk in that
[1:29:02] if you can let that dominate your mind
[1:29:05] take over your mind
[1:29:06] fill up your mind if you can let that
[1:29:09] consume you every bit
[1:29:11] if you can let that becomes the most
[1:29:13] desirable things that you want
[1:29:15] if you can let that become your goal he
[1:29:18] will take you there
[1:29:20] the thing is we have so many other goals
[1:29:22] we want to do this we want to do this we
[1:29:23] want to achieve this we want to achieve
[1:29:25] this
[1:29:25] but oh i want to have a single goal and
[1:29:28] my goal is to be what you call me to be
[1:29:31] my goal is to be the happiest christian
[1:29:33] in texas
[1:29:34] my goal is to be what you've called me
[1:29:36] to be my goal
[1:29:38] is to have a faith attitude an attitude
[1:29:41] that shows what god has done
[1:29:43] i tell you this faith inspires
[1:29:50] expectation
[1:29:52] it's my faith speaks about that woman
[1:29:57] oh mommy we're running just a thought
[1:30:00] it's
[1:30:00] not going to be too long if the musician
[1:30:02] could come
[1:30:03] oh she came and
[1:30:06] the gentile woman barbara says she never
[1:30:10] seen a miracle done before
[1:30:14] never she came
[1:30:18] and jesus looked at it and said you
[1:30:20] don't give the children
[1:30:22] bread to dogs do you the meats that's
[1:30:25] reserved to children
[1:30:27] the food that's reserved for children we
[1:30:29] don't give it to dogs do we
[1:30:31] she said you're right but even dogs
[1:30:36] it's from the crumb i tell you my
[1:30:39] brother my sister
[1:30:41] her eyes was on the price she knew what
[1:30:44] she was looking for
[1:30:46] and nothing could stop her she knew what
[1:30:49] she was there for
[1:30:50] and there was no bad attitude there was
[1:30:53] no nothing that was going to come within
[1:30:55] her way
[1:30:56] she knew who he was and there was
[1:30:58] nothing that was going to stop her
[1:30:59] receive what she
[1:31:00] wanted god i'll tell you this we have
[1:31:03] known who god is in this generation
[1:31:06] we have seen him with our eyes i'm not
[1:31:08] talking about
[1:31:09] the man but i'm talking about the god
[1:31:12] who was in the man
[1:31:13] god is known by his characteristics his
[1:31:16] characteristics have been made known to
[1:31:18] us in this ice age
[1:31:19] we have seen him and i can say with john
[1:31:22] what our hands has touched
[1:31:24] our eyes have seen you said well you
[1:31:26] didn't touch the prophet
[1:31:27] yes i didn't touch the prophet but i've
[1:31:29] touched god by touching you
[1:31:31] i've touched god by touching my brother
[1:31:33] my sister well our eyes have seen
[1:31:35] our eyes have behold the glory of the
[1:31:38] living god
[1:31:38] what glory he's taken a bunch of sinners
[1:31:41] and he's washed them clean and he's
[1:31:44] giving them his power within them
[1:31:46] so they can sit and glorify him my
[1:31:48] brother my sister when you look you're
[1:31:50] looking at god
[1:31:57] concerning eternal life what else are we
[1:32:00] going to talk about eternal life
[1:32:02] if we're not going to talk about the
[1:32:04] people around you you know we're not
[1:32:06] i think you know people want oh you know
[1:32:09] i'll tell you about moses
[1:32:10] i wasn't there when moses was there
[1:32:14] i'll tell you about jacob it's just the
[1:32:17] story i read
[1:32:20] but oh if i can talk about one that i've
[1:32:22] seen here
[1:32:24] that came it was a sinner and god
[1:32:26] changed his life
[1:32:28] and made him whole if i could talk about
[1:32:30] myself and
[1:32:31] where he took me and what he has made me
[1:32:34] that's the testimony of jesus christ
[1:32:36] don't just stop and say i'll read the
[1:32:38] bible you are the written bible
[1:32:41] manifested tonight you are here as an
[1:32:43] epistle the scripture says
[1:32:45] to manifest the glory of god we have
[1:32:48] seen god in this generation
[1:32:50] and i say this let's not stop short of
[1:32:53] our commission
[1:32:54] in the end time let's move forward with
[1:32:56] it
[1:32:57] wherever it takes us let us go why
[1:32:59] because
[1:33:00] i have seen god and i have to tell
[1:33:03] somebody
[1:33:07] that's why people run into all kinds of
[1:33:09] confusion with this message
[1:33:11] all they've seen is just the red stories
[1:33:14] and the red message books
[1:33:16] about what god did and everything and
[1:33:19] never seen one for themselves
[1:33:21] how can a man see a miracle perform
[1:33:25] god come down and do something
[1:33:28] and then look at that same god that same
[1:33:30] messenger
[1:33:31] and say this is of the devil
[1:33:36] a man will send sin and say if god
[1:33:39] doesn't come behind this don't believe
[1:33:41] it
[1:33:43] if he doesn't come and prove what i just
[1:33:45] preached don't believe it
[1:33:47] if he just doesn't come and stand behind
[1:33:49] what i just said don't believe it
[1:33:53] who has ever said that
[1:33:59] let's not forget what's been made
[1:34:00] available to us
[1:34:02] let's not just take this for granted but
[1:34:05] let the love of jesus christ abound
[1:34:07] within your heart
[1:34:08] let some fire be uh flamed up within
[1:34:11] your bones and say
[1:34:13] god i have seen you and i believe you i
[1:34:16] have touched you for myself
[1:34:18] i have i've come in contact with you my
[1:34:21] life is what it is today because i came
[1:34:23] in contact with you
[1:34:24] therefore i'm standing here i'm gonna
[1:34:26] have the right mental attitude
[1:34:28] i'm gonna speak my expectation i'm gonna
[1:34:31] walk by expectation
[1:34:33] why the same god who done before is here
[1:34:35] to do the same
[1:34:36] i'm here whatever i have not seen yet
[1:34:39] i'm here
[1:34:40] believing that god is gonna bring it to
[1:34:42] pass
[1:34:44] why because he's made himself available
[1:34:48] to me
[1:34:48] he's opened my eyes that i can see what
[1:34:51] a grace let's all stand today
[1:35:12] he says this
[1:35:16] always remember
[1:35:19] always remember church it says
[1:35:22] god's words are true
[1:35:26] i believe the right mental attitude
[1:35:27] towards any divine promise of god will
[1:35:29] bring you the past
[1:35:31] if you can look at it in the right way
[1:35:34] but remember he's been
[1:35:39] it's been my standard in life
[1:35:43] i try to do this the first thing i want
[1:35:47] the first thing i find out is whenever
[1:35:50] whenever it's the will of god or not
[1:35:53] then i know it's god's will the next
[1:35:56] thing
[1:35:57] is my objective towards it my motive and
[1:36:00] objective
[1:36:01] in doing it then if it's god's will
[1:36:04] if it's a will of god and my mother my
[1:36:07] motive my objective is right my motive
[1:36:10] is right
[1:36:10] i have faith that it's it that it will
[1:36:13] be done
[1:36:15] because firth it's the will of god
[1:36:18] my objective is to glorify him my motive
[1:36:22] is
[1:36:23] is to give him all the glory it's not a
[1:36:26] selfish motive about it
[1:36:28] if you have a selfish motive it won't
[1:36:30] work if the objective is to make
[1:36:33] to make money for yourself or something
[1:36:35] why
[1:36:36] it will not it will need it it will it
[1:36:39] will never succeed
[1:36:40] and then you will try to do something
[1:36:42] outside of his will
[1:36:44] outside of the will of the lord then it
[1:36:47] will work
[1:36:48] it won't work in the big to begin with
[1:36:50] so
[1:36:51] there it says so there is a genuine
[1:36:54] faith
[1:36:55] it says but you must come in the real
[1:36:58] channel of god
[1:37:01] to have that genuine faith there is a
[1:37:04] human
[1:37:04] faith there's faith of god and you must
[1:37:08] have a godly faith to believe
[1:37:10] now then have a godly faith you must
[1:37:13] have the mind of christ in you
[1:37:16] then that's how god is projected to you
[1:37:21] visions revelation
[1:37:24] i want you to catch that
[1:37:28] it's the word of god it's the will of
[1:37:31] god
[1:37:32] it's the mind of god i have the right
