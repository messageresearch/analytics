you dear heavenly father we come before you this morning lord with grateful hearts to be here lord to come in your presence lord because we know that your word says that you'll be here lord we're just so appreciative of this time lord that you've given us may we not take it for granted lord but come with expectation to hear from you lord cover us in your word cover us in your love lord just as the song we just saying lord we just rely on you and we're looking forward to your presence amongst us lord speak to us and bring us closer to you bless the remainder of the service lord each part or it may be pleasing to you and may our hearts be open we ask these things in the lord jesus christ amen amen amen certainly want to welcome everyone in the house of god and then all our visitors will welcome you this morning as you invite buddy mike for some reading amen i trust you're excited to be in his presence this morning amen as the scripture says as the days approach the believers gather together amen god bless you good morning and i think we're all familiar with that message that brother branham preached trying to do god a service without it being his will and the scripture that he chose when he was speaking out was mark 7 7. it says this how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men you know what i was doing i've been making it a commitment which i generally fail every year to read through the bible this year and uh read through a similar passage in matthew where jesus was saying something similar of the pharisees and you know you read scriptures like that and you tend to ascribe those things to the pharisees or the religious leaders of the day or you know religion and denomination and everything other than us but you know as i was thinking over this it you know occurred to me how much of what we do how much we commit our our time to our efforts to isn't really instructed of the lord not really lead of the lord you know even good things even things that feel religious feel spiritual but have we really heard from the lord on doing that or are we doing it because we think it's right right you know we know the story in exodus of the children of israel who you know were were slaves and you know it says in the beginning of exodus that they had utterly committed themselves to building treasure cities under pharaoh you know to the point that when a prophet came with a deliverance message they they pushed back on that because he was messing with their livelihood but you know that was not their original occupation when they first entered into the chill into egypt and they gave witness you know joseph brought his brothers before pharaoh they gave witness that their occupation was to be shepherds so somewhere along the line they forgot their original occupation and got caught up building treasure cities for pharaoh instead of being shepherds you know i think that sometimes we get so busy maybe building cities that we've forgotten what it is and maybe this is just for me but you know certainly as we go about our time and our day you know how much do we spend on things that aren't necessarily thus saith the lord but they're what we're told are the right things to do being responsible citizen we do this being a good student i do this being a religious person i do this but have we gone before him as individuals to receive thus saith the lord about that you know jesus said that i do nothing nothing unless i the father shows me first you know it wasn't because of what was taught but what i have heard for myself right brother randy you know mentioned the scripture matthew 7 on wednesday it says that you know many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works you know i thought about that that's a pretty good resume of works those are some good spiritual religious things but he still called it iniquity because it was their own works it wasn't thus saith the lord you never knew me you know and so it was just kind of a reminder to me personally that to be so careful about the work that we do the work that i do being first a result of thus saith the lord and seeking him first that i don't get caught up doing all these other things that i forget the principle thing to seek his face psalm 127 we'll go ahead and read that this morning it's a short passage but it opens with this verse it says accept the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchmen wakeeth but in vain
