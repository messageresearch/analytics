[50:38] of the doctrine of baptism and the
[50:40] laying of hands and of the resurrection

[50:51] gracious father we thank you once again
[50:53] tonight we perhaps father that you come
[50:55] by our way and speak to us that's the
[50:57] desire of our heart we love you and ask
[50:59] those things in the name of jesus christ
[51:01] amen
[51:02] command you may have your seats
[51:10] amen certainly enjoyed the word this
[51:12] morning
[51:13] uh
[51:14] i was in the back and brother david
[51:16] asked me what is it you know what are
[51:18] you going to preach on i said well you
[51:20] you
[51:21] basically just said everything i wanted
[51:23] to say and better
[51:24] so i just
[51:26] i was supposed to say to preach on
[51:28] wednesday
[51:29] but then with the weather
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] it was moved the service was canceled
[51:35] and these are just
[51:37] some of the things if i could say that
[51:39] resonated with me
[51:41] from our meetings that we had in even
[51:43] this morning they just became so clear
[51:45] in my heart
[51:46] and so i pray that as we go through that
[51:49] something will speak to you
[51:52] last time when we spoke we spoke on
[51:54] moving to perfection and
[51:56] we read the scripture that says be
[51:58] therefore perfect as your father in
[52:00] heaven is perfect
[52:02] and i hope as i go through this that it
[52:04] would connect it with what was uh spoken
[52:07] this morning because i feel like the
[52:09] word has just been continuing and just
[52:11] going in a direction where
[52:13] god is calling up to move up in higher
[52:15] ground i believe that the broad is
[52:18] coming into a place where she comes to
[52:20] the realization of what the word was all
[52:23] about of what she was put here on earth
[52:25] to do and i believe as we look into the
[52:28] world we could the word of god when we
[52:30] see the events that's happening outside
[52:32] if we look carefully we'll see that what
[52:35] god is trying to do within his body and
[52:37] i think that's what's important
[52:39] recognizing what god is doing in the
[52:41] world is wonderful
[52:43] recognizing what what's happening as far
[52:45] as the signs are concerned is good but i
[52:48] want i'm more interested in what god is
[52:50] trying to do in me
[52:52] i'm more interested in what is it that
[52:53] god is trying to do in our midst what is
[52:56] it that he's wanting to take this bride
[52:58] and the word that is written revealed in
[53:00] the end time so we said be therefore
[53:02] perfect as your father in heaven is
[53:04] perfect and we made a comment that there
[53:08] could not be a need for perfection
[53:10] or there could not be a requirement for
[53:13] perfection unless god build it to be
[53:15] perfect unless god allowed it and build
[53:19] it so that it could get to the
[53:20] perfection so you can't ask perfection
[53:23] from something that can never reach it
[53:25] or you can never ask a
[53:28] someone who lacks something who lacks
[53:31] the ability who lacks the competence who
[53:33] lacks everything in order for them to
[53:35] achieve something they will need to get
[53:37] it from somewhere and we realize that
[53:40] god
[53:41] here as we read it says be therefore as
[53:43] your father in heaven is perfect in is
[53:46] in direct communication and saying that
[53:48] you are of your father and your father
[53:51] is perfect therefore you can also be
[53:53] perfect we said it last time it's not
[53:56] because of uh he's he's requiring
[53:59] perfection is because of who our father
[54:01] is he's saying we can be perfect because
[54:04] he's directly connecting you to himself
[54:06] he's letting you know that you can be
[54:08] perfect as i am perfect
[54:11] now uh we we read as a definition of
[54:14] perfection it's the process of of
[54:17] achieving
[54:18] uh either spiritual maturity of coming
[54:21] or coming into a perfection it's the
[54:23] action or the process of improving
[54:26] something until it's thoughtless
[54:30] until it's thoughtless or can come to
[54:32] the uh
[54:33] as close as possible to being without
[54:36] defect
[54:37] so and tonight i want to continue but i
[54:40] want to just give it a different title
[54:43] perhaps it would help us as we continue
[54:45] on even from what was spoken
[54:48] this morning i want to speak on the
[54:50] source of your perfection
[54:53] the source of your perfection
[54:55] the scripture reads in john 15 and 16 it
[54:59] says ye have not chosen me i have chosen
[55:02] you
[55:03] i'm speaking about the source of your
[55:05] perfection ye have not chosen me i have
[55:09] chosen you and ordained it that ye shall
[55:12] go forth and bring forth fruit
[55:14] so when we when we go when we go out of
[55:17] here or when we look at ourselves even
[55:20] tonight we have to come to an
[55:22] understanding even as a scripture saying
[55:24] god is not talking to us as human beings
[55:28] as we sit here with our natural senses
[55:31] and with our emotions spiritual stances
[55:34] god is communicating to us as eternal
[55:37] being that is trying to bring us into
[55:39] the realization of something he's saying
[55:42] that ye have not chosen me i have chosen
[55:45] you so if you sit here tonight the need
[55:48] to come into perfection is not something
[55:51] that wait on you for you to say well i
[55:54] don't understand how i'm going to get to
[55:55] perfection i don't know what the first
[55:57] step is going to be i don't know what
[55:58] the second step he's saying that ye have
[56:00] not chosen me i have chosen you in other
[56:04] words i will provide what is needed in
[56:06] order to get to perfection i know the
[56:08] way to perfection i have chosen you i
[56:12] called you to be perfect and i have
[56:14] chosen you to be perfect that you may
[56:16] bring for fruit it's not up to you it's
[56:19] up to my choosing it's up to my doing
[56:22] that you understand that i have chosen
[56:24] you did i know even as a pastor said
[56:26] this morning he knew all
[56:28] things when he came to choosing you
[56:31] there is nothing that's hidden before
[56:34] god there was not a
[56:35] sin that you had committed there was not
[56:37] a word that you had spoken there's
[56:39] nothing past present and future that
[56:42] you're gonna do that's gonna catch god
[56:44] by surprise it says well i didn't expect
[56:46] that from him or oh that's surprising
[56:48] that's not what i expected for him to do
[56:51] but he says i have chosen you in other
[56:53] words he knew you and he placed you and
[56:56] he predestinated you so you can be
[56:59] perfect
[57:01] i was thinking about this as i was
[57:03] reading uh he have not because i thought
[57:05] it went so well with what our pastor was
[57:07] speaking this morning i began to think
[57:10] uh you know i i when i was young i i
[57:13] just not even many years ago
[57:17] i grew up my mom had gone
[57:20] away when i was around four or five
[57:22] years old and i hadn't had a chance to
[57:24] talk to her in many years
[57:26] and and after so many years i believe i
[57:29] was
[57:30] maybe 20 or so years um i had a chance
[57:33] to talk with her on the phone
[57:36] and and and you know and
[57:38] you pick up the phone and you feel
[57:40] there's no connection you're trying to
[57:42] talk and and you you're just trying to
[57:45] figure out where to start and and things
[57:47] like that and and then but then we began
[57:50] to talk and talk and and she would ask
[57:52] me a question or ask me something and i
[57:55] will remain quiet and just not know what
[57:57] kind of answer to give and everything
[57:59] and and and she would say she made a
[58:02] comment she's like you know that's just
[58:04] how you were when you were a kid it said
[58:06] you know when you you heard something
[58:08] you didn't like you would go you will
[58:10] shut completely down and here i am in my
[58:13] 30s and i thought i had changed and i
[58:15] thought you know i had progressed i had
[58:17] matured and everything and something can
[58:20] be spoken about me when i was young and
[58:22] directly i can relate to that even in my
[58:25] older age
[58:26] something would directly connect and
[58:28] i'll say well i don't know i wonder how
[58:30] she knew that we'll talk and then she'll
[58:32] say something and and she will drop and
[58:34] and finally you begin to realize that
[58:37] she knew more about me than i knew about
[58:39] myself
[58:40] and i'm here to announce to you my
[58:42] brother my sister god knows more about
[58:44] you that you even know about yourself
[58:47] sometimes we think we surprise ourselves
[58:49] on some of the things we do you do
[58:51] something you're like well whether it be
[58:53] good or bad oh i didn't expect i didn't
[58:55] know i could do that i didn't know i had
[58:58] that ability to understand it so i
[59:00] didn't know i could either do that or or
[59:02] things like that that's in the human
[59:04] realm but i want to tell you this
[59:06] morning god knew the seed that he had
[59:08] planted god knew what he had planted it
[59:11] is nothing you can do that will surprise
[59:13] him in fact he knows more about you than
[59:16] you know about yourself
[59:19] we go through situations we go we try to
[59:22] figure out things you know every day
[59:24] when there's a new something new that
[59:26] comes up it seems like it's the end of
[59:28] our lives i don't know how i'm gonna get
[59:30] out of this i don't know how this is
[59:32] going to go but yet god comes and he
[59:34] takes you out of it oh something else
[59:36] happening like i think i'm stuck and
[59:38] this is the end of me and god comes and
[59:41] he takes you out of it why he knows
[59:43] where he's taking you
[59:45] all he's asking is for you to follow his
[59:48] leading as we heard this morning that
[59:50] the children of god are those that are
[59:52] led by the spirit of god
[59:55] so i want to say this morning
[59:58] tonight
[59:59] we can take all the understanding of
[1:00:02] everything that we are we can look at
[1:00:04] everything that we do we can sum up
[1:00:07] everything about us and come to a
[1:00:09] conclusion that regardless of what we
[1:00:12] have done regardless of what we're going
[1:00:14] to do
[1:00:15] god has chosen us
[1:00:19] and why is that important
[1:00:21] because it answers the question about
[1:00:24] all your humanity
[1:00:26] about all of your thinking
[1:00:28] about all the possibility that could you
[1:00:30] you could lay before you if you can come
[1:00:33] to an understanding that it doesn't
[1:00:36] matter what happens to me god has chosen
[1:00:38] me he answers all the questions of life
[1:00:42] it completely answers everything so you
[1:00:44] can be at peace to know that as i'm
[1:00:47] walking he's walking with me if he had
[1:00:49] chosen me he's not gonna leave me he's
[1:00:52] gonna walk with me in the morning he's
[1:00:54] gonna walk me with me at night he's
[1:00:56] going to be with me every day
[1:00:58] now but one of them speaks now listen he
[1:01:00] speaks about perfection he's in the
[1:01:03] message water waters of separation this
[1:01:05] is what he says
[1:01:08] he says
[1:01:09] god looking through the blood
[1:01:11] he doesn't see you no more as a sinner
[1:01:16] now this is i'm talking about your
[1:01:17] source of perfection
[1:01:19] he's saying as he looks through through
[1:01:21] the blood he doesn't see you no more as
[1:01:23] a sinner he sees you redeemed amen you
[1:01:28] are redeemed because he's always seen
[1:01:31] you through the blood of through christ
[1:01:34] that's the reason we can be perfect
[1:01:39] the reason we can be perfect tonight is
[1:01:42] because god when he looks at you he sees
[1:01:45] you through the blood of christ
[1:01:47] and he says that's how we could be
[1:01:49] perfect not perfection not perfect in a
[1:01:53] sense of sinless we are perfect in the
[1:01:56] eyes of god when we are in christ
[1:02:00] hallelujah oh it's not about being
[1:02:03] sinless what i cannot do wrong here my
[1:02:06] thoughts are always perfect no as long
[1:02:08] as we are in this place we'll be caught
[1:02:10] up in those things as long as we are
[1:02:12] perfect we'll think wrong we'll do wrong
[1:02:14] and we'll be caught up in things we
[1:02:16] shouldn't be and all of that but as far
[1:02:18] as god is concerned when he has chosen
[1:02:21] you he chose you in christ and in christ
[1:02:25] it's already done
[1:02:27] in christ there's nothing to be added in
[1:02:30] christ it's already finished in christ
[1:02:33] he paid the price that was supposed to
[1:02:35] be paid in christ he died for you in
[1:02:38] christ he made you sing less in christ
[1:02:41] he provided everything that was needed
[1:02:43] in order for you to appear sinless
[1:02:45] before
[1:02:46] him not perfect in a sense of sinless we
[1:02:50] are perfect in the ass of god when we
[1:02:53] are in christ that's the reason he said
[1:02:56] be perfect even as your father in heaven
[1:02:59] is perfect paul in the 10th chapter of
[1:03:02] hebrews trying to explain
[1:03:05] uh the law having a shadow of good
[1:03:07] things to come
[1:03:08] not very not the very image of things
[1:03:11] that could ever
[1:03:13] make
[1:03:14] the comer unto perfection
[1:03:16] because god was looking through animal
[1:03:19] blood
[1:03:20] but how he looked through the blood of
[1:03:22] his son
[1:03:23] perfection by it says perfection comes
[1:03:26] by christ
[1:03:28] jesus or by jesus christ
[1:03:31] and yes and i want to ask who's jesus
[1:03:33] christ the word
[1:03:36] perfection comes to jesus christ who is
[1:03:39] jesus christ the word in other words
[1:03:41] when you believe the word when you let
[1:03:44] the word work inside of you when you
[1:03:46] believe it you walk by it you talk by it
[1:03:49] when you let the world change you when
[1:03:51] you let the world brings you in the
[1:03:53] image of what god predestinated for you
[1:03:55] that's how you become perfect now he
[1:03:58] continues on he says now
[1:04:00] i'm not perfect in your sight i love
[1:04:02] this you may not be perfect in my sight
[1:04:06] but what about in god's sight
[1:04:10] you may look and says i know the
[1:04:12] failings of that one i know him very
[1:04:14] well i know they're not perfect and you
[1:04:16] can i can look at you and say the same
[1:04:18] in all the things but the things that we
[1:04:20] have to consider it's not in one and
[1:04:23] other sites that matters that's why the
[1:04:26] scripture says we are foolish to compare
[1:04:28] one with another but what we need to
[1:04:30] look in god's economy to look at in
[1:04:33] god's sight and he says that's where he
[1:04:36] lays if you are born again in the body
[1:04:39] of christ
[1:04:40] then god looks
[1:04:42] upon you as a perfect
[1:04:45] as perfect as christ
[1:04:47] was himself amen
[1:04:51] nothing you can do
[1:04:52] it's not by our any uh by any of our
[1:04:55] works you can do it all by grace it says
[1:04:59] by grace it's by grace god has give as
[1:05:03] give you this offer
[1:05:05] he says and if you accept it in the
[1:05:08] sight of god you are perfect
[1:05:11] if you accept this word tonight
[1:05:14] oh what a privilege to know that if we
[1:05:17] accept a message the word that god has
[1:05:19] sent us in this end time
[1:05:21] automatically you are perfect in his
[1:05:23] sight we're not perfect because we're
[1:05:25] better than the world and because we
[1:05:27] don't do anything wrong we are perfect
[1:05:30] because the word cleanses us why because
[1:05:33] the word takes away the desires of the
[1:05:35] world the word that takes away the
[1:05:37] nature of the word it keeps us pure and
[1:05:41] it causes us to obey his commandment
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:46] it says
[1:05:48] accept
[1:05:49] a
[1:05:50] you you've accepted it and in the sight
[1:05:52] of god you are perfect redeemed washed
[1:05:55] in the blood of the lamb without fault
[1:05:58] without blame without blemish without
[1:06:01] spot isn't that marvelous he asked
[1:06:04] and and the scripture says
[1:06:07] i was thinking in first
[1:06:08] first peter 1 and 23 says
[1:06:11] being born again
[1:06:13] not
[1:06:14] of corruptible seed
[1:06:16] but incorruptible
[1:06:18] by the word of god which liveth and
[1:06:21] abideth forever
[1:06:25] being born again
[1:06:27] not of corruptible seed
[1:06:29] but
[1:06:31] it says by the word of god which liveth
[1:06:35] and abideth forever in other words if
[1:06:38] you are born by the word of god you live
[1:06:41] forever if you are born of the word of
[1:06:44] god you abide it forever why because if
[1:06:47] he lives you shall live also why because
[1:06:50] everything that god is you become why
[1:06:53] because the nature that god was and and
[1:06:56] even the scripture tells us heaven and
[1:06:57] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:07:00] never pass away being born by the word
[1:07:03] causes that you can be eternal
[1:07:10] now
[1:07:12] the scripture says here
[1:07:16] and i'm not going to read through all of
[1:07:17] it
[1:07:18] in luke chapter 8
[1:07:21] it speaks about the parable of the sower
[1:07:25] it
[1:07:26] says and i'll read from verse 4 he says
[1:07:31] and it talks about the man who came and
[1:07:32] chose it it says and much people
[1:07:35] gathered together and
[1:07:37] and came to him out of
[1:07:39] every city and speak
[1:07:41] any spec by by parable
[1:07:44] and soul went out
[1:07:45] to sow his seed
[1:07:48] and he sold
[1:07:49] some fell on the wayside
[1:07:52] and it was
[1:07:53] trodden down
[1:07:55] and the falls of the air devouted
[1:07:58] and some fell upon the rock
[1:08:00] and as as soon as it sprung up
[1:08:04] it was a weathered away because of lack
[1:08:07] of moisture
[1:08:09] and some fell upon the torn
[1:08:11] and the tone
[1:08:13] sprung up with it and choked it
[1:08:16] another fell on good ground and sprung
[1:08:18] up and bare fruits
[1:08:20] and a hundred fold
[1:08:22] and when he had said these things he
[1:08:25] cried
[1:08:26] and he had
[1:08:28] and he had the ear to he he that has an
[1:08:30] ear let him hear
[1:08:32] and his disciple asked him and saying
[1:08:35] what
[1:08:36] what might this parable be
[1:08:40] and he said unto unto he said
[1:08:43] unto you it is given to know the
[1:08:45] mysteries of the kingdom
[1:08:48] but to others
[1:08:52] but to others in parable
[1:08:55] that seeing that they might not see and
[1:08:58] hear that they may not understand
[1:09:00] now i i think this becomes very
[1:09:03] important because
[1:09:05] we i think as we advance more and more
[1:09:07] we see that
[1:09:09] this message is not understood by
[1:09:12] intellect
[1:09:14] and only those that came in by
[1:09:16] revelation will remain at the end
[1:09:18] because we can see
[1:09:20] how much
[1:09:22] the intellect people or those that enter
[1:09:25] in by intellect how their intellect is
[1:09:27] falling down
[1:09:29] how all of those things that people
[1:09:30] perceived and the understanding that
[1:09:33] they had and and and what they thought
[1:09:35] that they knew because they had believed
[1:09:38] and and somebody came and told them
[1:09:40] something different and they walked away
[1:09:42] but you realize even we can say this
[1:09:46] here he is in saying that i'm speaking
[1:09:48] such so that only a particular group of
[1:09:51] people will understand this
[1:09:53] i'm saying these things the way i'm
[1:09:55] saying it's because it's not given for
[1:09:58] everybody to believe it's not given for
[1:10:01] everybody to receive what i'm saying but
[1:10:03] this is said in such a way that it will
[1:10:06] only catch a certain group of people
[1:10:08] that i have in mind
[1:10:10] and and i begin to think even you know
[1:10:13] we think about the message of the hour
[1:10:15] and the things that uh the prophet came
[1:10:18] in his life and the things that he
[1:10:19] preached now we can look at the first
[1:10:22] bull and realize that everybody accepted
[1:10:24] it
[1:10:25] why because it had to do with the flesh
[1:10:28] you hold someone by the hand and you you
[1:10:31] tell them what sicknesses they had and
[1:10:33] all those things and people looked at it
[1:10:35] and they were attracted by it
[1:10:37] when the second bull came the discerning
[1:10:40] of the spirit saying something that only
[1:10:42] you knew
[1:10:44] again still within the flesh and the
[1:10:46] spirit realm where a man who was
[1:10:49] somewhere who only knew who was there
[1:10:51] and knew that nobody else knew this but
[1:10:53] someone could tell you that you would
[1:10:55] believe that too
[1:10:57] but oh when he came to the third pool he
[1:10:59] began to think or to speak about a
[1:11:02] certain description that was never heard
[1:11:04] before he began to talk about the seed
[1:11:07] of god that was predestinated before the
[1:11:09] beginning and he had nothing to do with
[1:11:12] the flesh he had nothing to do with the
[1:11:14] spirit of man all he had to do is you
[1:11:17] had to believe the word and let it come
[1:11:19] to pass
[1:11:22] no connection in fact it will come to
[1:11:24] say that i say these things and others
[1:11:26] will go away
[1:11:28] i say these things others will be driven
[1:11:30] away others will question why is this
[1:11:33] but he's saying it knowing that it's
[1:11:35] said this way to only attract the elect
[1:11:37] at the end time
[1:11:44] so he speaks of this parable and in 14
[1:11:46] it says
[1:11:48] that which fell among the torn
[1:11:51] are they which when the herd go forth
[1:11:55] and choked and choked with a care in the
[1:11:57] riches and the pleasures of life and
[1:12:00] bring no fruits to perfection
[1:12:02] but in 15 it says
[1:12:04] but that it says
[1:12:06] but that one good doubt but that on good
[1:12:09] ground
[1:12:10] are they
[1:12:11] which in an honest and good heart having
[1:12:14] heard
[1:12:15] the word
[1:12:17] that says they keep it and it brings
[1:12:19] forth fruits with patience
[1:12:23] we
[1:12:25] and i just want to say this
[1:12:27] it's important
[1:12:29] that as a church of the living god
[1:12:32] we come to an understanding that god is
[1:12:34] not interested in dealing with us
[1:12:37] through our flesh
[1:12:39] god is not even interested to dealing
[1:12:41] with us through our spirit mind as a man
[1:12:44] human mind but god is interested in
[1:12:47] dealing in the seed that he had planted
[1:12:50] inside of us so we can operate by the
[1:12:53] seed that he had planted and not by our
[1:12:56] flesh or thinking
[1:12:58] so he could be by faith alone and not of
[1:13:00] works
[1:13:01] so he could be something that god
[1:13:03] himself will come and bring it to come
[1:13:06] to pass
[1:13:07] i was thinking about the other parable
[1:13:09] that we read the last time which it
[1:13:12] spoke about how that the sower came and
[1:13:15] he saw seed and this was in matthew 13
[1:13:18] 25
[1:13:19] matthew chapter 13
[1:13:21] how that he came and he sow seed and the
[1:13:23] enemy came and he saw a different seed
[1:13:27] and and and then at the end at verse 30
[1:13:29] it says that let them grow together
[1:13:32] until the harvest and in that time of
[1:13:35] harvest i will send the reapers to
[1:13:38] gather together first a tear to bind
[1:13:41] them and to burn them but then gather
[1:13:44] the wheat unto my barn so here he is in
[1:13:48] the same at the end time meaning the
[1:13:51] time when the seed will have grown now
[1:13:54] we said this last time it's very
[1:13:56] important you realize yerry is when when
[1:13:59] he's saying that when they came and they
[1:14:01] said why don't we go out in the field
[1:14:03] and pull out all the tears that were
[1:14:05] the wrong seed that was planted he says
[1:14:07] no leave it alone
[1:14:09] let it grow together
[1:14:11] let it grow together it says but if you
[1:14:14] go at that time when they're still young
[1:14:16] you may hurt the seed
[1:14:18] in other words
[1:14:20] i was i i i was thinking so much about
[1:14:22] this and the scripture came to my heart
[1:14:25] where it says and i believe it's in
[1:14:27] galatians chapter 4 it says it says now
[1:14:30] i say that an heir as long as is a child
[1:14:35] different nothing from a servant
[1:14:40] in other words the church in his infancy
[1:14:42] when he doesn't know it's what what what
[1:14:45] it's all about and it doesn't know about
[1:14:47] its power it doesn't know about what he
[1:14:49] owns what is mine and it doesn't know
[1:14:51] about the position that god was trying
[1:14:54] to put it in a child when he's young
[1:14:56] when he's not about the father's
[1:14:58] business when he doesn't understand what
[1:15:00] is the father wants me to do when he's
[1:15:02] still young and and he's crying and all
[1:15:05] he wants is milk in it at that age it's
[1:15:08] no different from from a servant
[1:15:11] it's not different from a slave a
[1:15:13] servant but when a child
[1:15:16] grows up
[1:15:17] when a child gets into maturity when he
[1:15:20] comes into its perfection when he grows
[1:15:23] up and he becomes to a place where he
[1:15:24] understand what the father wants it to
[1:15:26] do
[1:15:27] at that time the the tear can be taken
[1:15:30] out and the seed will hold at that time
[1:15:33] it comes into the maturity it will come
[1:15:36] into the function of what god
[1:15:39] predestinated it to be
[1:15:43] and i want to say this that's why it's
[1:15:45] so important in this end time we realize
[1:15:48] that god is bringing his church into
[1:15:50] maturity he doesn't want us just to
[1:15:52] gather here and not know the reason why
[1:15:54] we gather here he doesn't want us to be
[1:15:57] those uh that are just excited the word
[1:15:59] comes and we jump up and down and we
[1:16:02] scream and everything and we go back
[1:16:04] being the same people no but he wants
[1:16:06] people that will step into possession
[1:16:09] the word of god at the end time is
[1:16:11] supposed to produce a more mature bride
[1:16:14] but than what the word produced in the
[1:16:16] first church ages that's why as we stand
[1:16:18] here we claim this promise why we've
[1:16:21] come into an understanding that what god
[1:16:23] is doing in this end time he's not
[1:16:25] looking for a baby but he's looking for
[1:16:28] a mature pride
[1:16:29] one who can stand and say this is my
[1:16:32] word this is my promise and i'll stand
[1:16:34] upon it until god brings it to pass
[1:16:41] and i'll say this
[1:16:43] it's very important
[1:16:44] don't forget that
[1:16:46] adoption was predicated on the conduct
[1:16:49] of the child
[1:16:52] the understanding of the business of the
[1:16:54] father
[1:16:55] the understanding that
[1:16:57] i have been given a responsibility
[1:17:01] i have been given a position i have been
[1:17:03] given something so i can bring the word
[1:17:06] of god to come to pass
[1:17:08] the scripture says that if you abide in
[1:17:10] me
[1:17:11] and my word abide in you
[1:17:14] ye shall ask what you will and i shall
[1:17:17] it shall be done
[1:17:19] it says wherein the father
[1:17:21] the year is
[1:17:23] wherein is my father glorify that you
[1:17:26] bear much fruit
[1:17:29] it says so much that he may so much
[1:17:32] so ye shall be my disciple
[1:17:35] as my father has loved me so i have
[1:17:37] loved you continue in my love it says if
[1:17:41] ye keep my commandment ye shall abide in
[1:17:44] my love and even as i have kept
[1:17:47] my father's commandment and abide in his
[1:17:50] love
[1:17:51] these things i have spoken unto you that
[1:17:54] my joy it says that
[1:17:56] my joy
[1:17:58] that my joy
[1:18:01] might remain in you that you be joy
[1:18:05] and your joy might be full
[1:18:07] this is my commandment and if we love
[1:18:10] and i love one another as i have loved
[1:18:12] you
[1:18:14] what is his commandment his commandment
[1:18:16] that is that we may keep his word
[1:18:18] his commandment is that we may come into
[1:18:21] the perfect place where we can bring
[1:18:23] forth coming to maturity where we can
[1:18:26] bring forth fruits
[1:18:27] is
[1:18:28] his joy his that we may come into a
[1:18:31] place where we can understand what is it
[1:18:33] that god is trying to achieve with us
[1:18:36] now he speaks in the message
[1:18:39] fellowship by redemption it says
[1:18:42] but if if god could not condemn his
[1:18:45] first creation
[1:18:46] how much more it is impossible for him
[1:18:49] to condemn his second creation
[1:18:52] he says
[1:18:54] when you are created anew in jesus
[1:18:57] christ
[1:18:58] you can't do it yourself
[1:19:04] i'm talking about the source of our
[1:19:06] perfection
[1:19:08] because so many of the time and
[1:19:11] time and time again the believer's
[1:19:13] greatest challenge is yourself
[1:19:16] the believer's greatest opposition is
[1:19:18] ourselves
[1:19:19] the believer's greatest challenge is
[1:19:22] every time we walk up we look at
[1:19:24] ourselves in the mirror we have to try
[1:19:26] to overcome that person that we see in
[1:19:28] the mirror
[1:19:30] we have to try to conquer that person we
[1:19:32] have to try to read the word of god and
[1:19:35] position ourselves
[1:19:36] not as what we see with our eyes even as
[1:19:39] the prophet said you look at me you see
[1:19:41] my fault i look at you i may see you
[1:19:43] imperfect but it says how about what god
[1:19:46] is seeing
[1:19:47] so a believer's positioning
[1:19:50] is to come to the place where you lose
[1:19:53] your own mind
[1:19:54] when you lose your own understanding
[1:19:57] where it doesn't matter what the devil
[1:19:59] is trying to show you what you
[1:20:01] interested in is what is god trying to
[1:20:03] show me
[1:20:04] what is he wanting me to see about
[1:20:06] myself oh i tell you i tell you this
[1:20:08] morning
[1:20:09] tonight let me i headed here let me see
[1:20:12] if i can read it because it's very
[1:20:14] important uh we we read it i believe in
[1:20:17] the rising of the sun this is paragraph
[1:20:19] 31 it says now the the the very essence
[1:20:23] of the message that was sent it is the
[1:20:25] rising
[1:20:26] is risen from the dead his benef his
[1:20:30] beneficiaries who shares that
[1:20:33] resurrection with him it says they draw
[1:20:35] benefit from this
[1:20:38] in other words
[1:20:39] from what from what god is seeing them
[1:20:42] not from what they're saying about
[1:20:43] themselves but listen to this draw
[1:20:46] benefits from this by proving to the
[1:20:48] world that he is alive we cannot do it
[1:20:52] by word only we cannot do it by some uh
[1:20:56] tradition of man
[1:20:59] we only reflect exactly what we are
[1:21:03] pointing to
[1:21:06] we only reflect exactly what we are
[1:21:10] pointing to
[1:21:11] and if you keep pointing to yourself you
[1:21:13] keep pointing to yourself you're never
[1:21:15] going to achieve anything but oh if i
[1:21:17] can walk up in the morning and hear the
[1:21:20] bride isn't invincible on me and say i'm
[1:21:23] pointing to death the bride will be so
[1:21:25] much like him i'm pointing to death oh
[1:21:28] the bride will go and she'll be the
[1:21:31] final voice i'm pointing to death the
[1:21:33] bride will be in the same image as the
[1:21:36] husband i'm pointing to that
[1:21:38] amen
[1:21:40] so he says you cannot do it by yourself
[1:21:43] no matter how much you you you you want
[1:21:46] to do it you cannot he listen to this it
[1:21:49] says it's a gift it's the it's a gift of
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:54] no man can make okay no man can come to
[1:21:57] me except the father draws him and all
[1:22:00] that comes to me i'll give him
[1:22:02] everlasting life and raise him up again
[1:22:04] in the last day
[1:22:05] and when listen to this and when god has
[1:22:09] borne you anew has borne you anew
[1:22:13] by the holy ghost
[1:22:15] he can only look upon you as perfect
[1:22:18] work
[1:22:22] oh i tell you this
[1:22:24] it it it it's so important we can see
[1:22:26] this well it says when you when god has
[1:22:28] bought you anew
[1:22:30] by the holy ghost he can only look at
[1:22:33] you has a perfect word because when god
[1:22:37] has bone you anew
[1:22:39] by the holy ghost he can only look at
[1:22:40] you as perfect work because he did it
[1:22:43] himself
[1:22:46] he says glory
[1:22:48] amen he can't condemn you for he had he
[1:22:52] because for you are my workmanship amen
[1:22:56] oh my he says i feel like shouting like
[1:22:59] the methodist think of it
[1:23:01] you are god's workmanship
[1:23:04] he did it by how
[1:23:06] sovereign grace
[1:23:08] not because you jumped not because when
[1:23:11] you went to church not because you
[1:23:14] turned a new page
[1:23:16] but because god by his mercy brought you
[1:23:20] into christ to fellowship and look upon
[1:23:23] you as perfect work of his own why
[1:23:27] i brought him
[1:23:29] i presented him to to my to the blood
[1:23:32] he's there's nothing wrong there's
[1:23:35] nothing wrong with my work he said
[1:23:37] you are god's workmanship
[1:23:41] to come to an understanding that i am
[1:23:44] god's workmanship i am the work of god
[1:23:48] and i was thinking about this this
[1:23:50] afternoon oh you think about christ the
[1:23:52] mystery of god reveal is that such a
[1:23:55] revelation even what something that
[1:23:58] it just tremendously opens up more and
[1:24:00] more there he is god makes his creation
[1:24:03] satan comes and causes god's creation to
[1:24:06] come to fail now god takes his word he
[1:24:09] puts it in the womb of a woman where he
[1:24:12] they it's nothing to do with the women
[1:24:14] but it's all god's word and that word
[1:24:17] comes to pass and within that word that
[1:24:20] one seed is contained all the other
[1:24:23] seeds that god had in the beginning all
[1:24:25] the plain of god that he had why it was
[1:24:28] hidden in christ if satan knew it he was
[1:24:30] never going to kill him
[1:24:33] but what he didn't understand is the
[1:24:34] plan of god was in christ so therefore
[1:24:37] when he died you died with him when he
[1:24:40] was again you raised with him that's why
[1:24:42] he said that the plane was in christ
[1:24:47] if we can only understand that way when
[1:24:49] we come to our bible we read that he
[1:24:52] overcomes sin i can say i can overcome
[1:24:54] that too why because i was in him when
[1:24:57] he went to the cross
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:01] the plan was not that christ will die
[1:25:04] and who was wrecked so god can figure
[1:25:06] out another way to bring the other seeds
[1:25:09] no the plan was the devil came and
[1:25:12] caused the creation to come to fall but
[1:25:15] god had a single plan
[1:25:17] the scripture says that the lamb was
[1:25:19] slaying before the foundation of the
[1:25:21] world what was he doing the plane was
[1:25:24] always christ the blood has always been
[1:25:26] christ the plan is christ all together
[1:25:29] so the understanding that in him all
[1:25:32] that god was
[1:25:36] the very first form that god took
[1:25:39] it was him the word
[1:25:41] so here he came
[1:25:43] he showed it
[1:25:45] when he came into the garden i was just
[1:25:46] talking about david about this
[1:25:48] he showed what he was going to do but
[1:25:50] the devil missed it
[1:25:52] it came and it took it was always adam
[1:25:56] it was always about adam
[1:25:58] but when adam was there he comes and
[1:26:00] out of adam he gets even
[1:26:03] he shows he says that's exactly what i
[1:26:05] want to achieve and everything but satan
[1:26:07] didn't see that so he didn't know that
[1:26:10] when he came to christ and he killed him
[1:26:12] that all he did was release the bride
[1:26:15] let christ come and when it died when he
[1:26:18] resurrected all the victory that he had
[1:26:21] the bride had it too
[1:26:25] in fact people still miss it today
[1:26:27] because they go back in the bible they
[1:26:29] don't understand what is this right that
[1:26:31] you guys are talking about who's the
[1:26:33] bride where is she the bride is him in
[1:26:36] the last day it's the manifestation of
[1:26:38] christ what he always wanted to do from
[1:26:41] the beginning
[1:26:43] hallelujah
[1:26:49] it says
[1:26:52] because not because you jumped
[1:26:55] not because
[1:26:56] you went to church
[1:26:58] or you turned a new page
[1:27:01] he says
[1:27:02] but he bought you
[1:27:05] in christ
[1:27:08] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:27:11] the whole entire mystery
[1:27:14] of how god was going to unveil himself
[1:27:17] like we heard this morning who's this
[1:27:19] bride how is she gonna come and we'll
[1:27:21] read it in a moment i'm just jumping
[1:27:23] ahead of myself what is all about her
[1:27:26] where did she come from who she is
[1:27:28] what's her representation it was all in
[1:27:31] christ in other words when she began to
[1:27:33] begin to be manifested it was nothing
[1:27:36] but christ himself reflection being made
[1:27:39] into her
[1:27:40] so now it says
[1:27:43] he says hebrews 2
[1:27:45] ephesians 2 and 10 it says for ya we are
[1:27:47] his workmanship created
[1:27:50] into union with christ jesus unto good
[1:27:53] works
[1:27:55] but when it says in invisible union it
[1:27:57] says
[1:27:58] now
[1:27:59] listen to this oh this is wonderful
[1:28:01] you're all the book
[1:28:03] is gone
[1:28:06] with the old union
[1:28:08] now
[1:28:09] your name
[1:28:11] in the old
[1:28:12] in it has been transferred
[1:28:15] you say
[1:28:17] do you mean to tell me my old book god
[1:28:20] put it in the sea of god forgetfulness
[1:28:22] to stand perfectly before god he says
[1:28:25] now your name is now in the new book
[1:28:29] not in the book of life but in the
[1:28:31] lamb's book of life
[1:28:33] now he asks
[1:28:34] what lamb book what what what the lamb
[1:28:37] had redeemed not the old book of your
[1:28:40] nature natural union but a new book the
[1:28:43] bride he says hallelujah your new life
[1:28:46] in the lamb's book of life your marriage
[1:28:50] certificate
[1:28:52] yo now let me let me continue on the
[1:28:54] marriage certificate hallelujah where
[1:28:57] your true eternal term from the
[1:29:00] beginning takes hold
[1:29:03] i want to stop there for just a minute i
[1:29:06] think oftentimes we approach
[1:29:07] christianity in such a wrong way where
[1:29:10] people are here you hear the word you
[1:29:12] said i want to be that i want to be that
[1:29:14] and you try to
[1:29:16] work yourself up into something and into
[1:29:19] justification into sanctification either
[1:29:21] you heal or you shouldn't steal oh i
[1:29:24] will try my best not to steal and
[1:29:25] everything that's not the way god has
[1:29:28] been working it out god has been working
[1:29:30] it out from eternity into the person
[1:29:33] that you are here and i want you to
[1:29:35] understand that's why because it's very
[1:29:37] important we see it he says when it's
[1:29:40] when when the germ eternal gem takes
[1:29:43] hold in other words the seed that god
[1:29:45] planted inside of you takes hold of this
[1:29:48] flesh causes it to walk by god's word to
[1:29:52] speak by god's word to think by god's
[1:29:54] word what is it something took hold of
[1:29:57] you
[1:29:58] and what is that that's that eternal
[1:30:00] term
[1:30:04] we come to church we hear
[1:30:06] oh you need to be baptized oh god i need
[1:30:08] the baptism so i can do right i need
[1:30:11] this i need this
[1:30:13] and i want to say this to you tonight
[1:30:15] the rain never changes the nature of the
[1:30:19] seed
[1:30:23] when the rain falls on the chassis and
[1:30:25] just the rain doesn't take the wheat and
[1:30:28] turn it into something else the rain
[1:30:30] doesn't take the tomato and turn it into
[1:30:33] carrots it doesn't take an apple and
[1:30:35] turn it into something else the rain
[1:30:38] facilitates what was already
[1:30:40] predestinated within the seed and only
[1:30:43] brings it into manifestation
[1:30:48] i tell you that's why he says you always
[1:30:50] had eternal life you always been with
[1:30:52] god
[1:30:53] it's the part of you that always wanted
[1:30:55] to be with god and god is reconciling
[1:30:58] with our part
[1:31:00] you didn't become a christian you were
[1:31:02] always a christian
[1:31:05] oh i tell you the revealing of the seven
[1:31:08] seals the third poll it brings confusion
[1:31:11] to the world but it's such a price to
[1:31:13] the bride it's the life itself
[1:31:19] why because you really said
[1:31:21] i always wanted to be that
[1:31:23] and then he comes and tells you well
[1:31:25] the reason why you always wanted that is
[1:31:27] because you were that
[1:31:32] let me say this eternity existed before
[1:31:34] time could exist
[1:31:36] let's not get it twisted we are not
[1:31:38] human trying to press into eternity no
[1:31:42] eternity was there before so in other
[1:31:44] words we're going back to what we were
[1:31:46] in eternity
[1:31:54] it says
[1:31:56] your that germ from the beginning takes
[1:32:00] hold
[1:32:01] and i want to say this if i can implore
[1:32:03] you tonight
[1:32:04] let that germ take hold of you
[1:32:07] don't try to control the germ of life
[1:32:09] that god has placed within you satisfy
[1:32:12] you with the things of the world let it
[1:32:14] take hold of you because that's what god
[1:32:16] is speaking to this word is addressed to
[1:32:19] the germ not to your intellect not to
[1:32:21] your understanding not to this human he
[1:32:24] said things we can never understand it
[1:32:26] with our mind
[1:32:29] he says you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:32:32] blood he says how can he say such a
[1:32:34] thing
[1:32:35] it was never meant for intellect
[1:32:38] those that were called by intellect they
[1:32:40] fought right there
[1:32:42] but there were those eagles those that
[1:32:45] were called more than just for the
[1:32:47] intellect they said you know what i
[1:32:50] don't understand what you just say
[1:32:52] i can't explain what you just told me
[1:32:54] but one thing i know is you have the
[1:32:56] words of life and therefore whatever it
[1:32:58] is that you want me to do i will follow
[1:33:05] it says
[1:33:06] hallelujah that determined germ
[1:33:08] takes hold
[1:33:10] and you are it says you are not only
[1:33:12] forgiven but you are justified glory to
[1:33:15] god romans 5 it says romans 5 and 1 it
[1:33:18] says therefore you are justified by
[1:33:20] faith
[1:33:21] now he says this this is in a message
[1:33:25] same message trying to do god the
[1:33:27] service
[1:33:28] he speaks about the bride now he says
[1:33:30] the word the evening message carries out
[1:33:33] evening results
[1:33:35] he says the evening message my soul
[1:33:37] evening seed
[1:33:39] not the morning seed evening seed
[1:33:42] he says is that right that's why it's
[1:33:44] important we speak about luke 17 30. now
[1:33:48] it's important to realize this mystery
[1:33:50] was hidden and it was not revealed until
[1:33:52] the same time so if you looked at it
[1:33:55] from the standpoint of before no one
[1:33:57] understood who this bride was how she
[1:34:00] was going to come what's her name all
[1:34:02] about her that's why i'm saying oh i
[1:34:04] tell you it's such an inspiration
[1:34:06] because when when david was speaking
[1:34:08] this morning i just i just about threw
[1:34:10] my notes and said i don't know what i'm
[1:34:12] gonna say but i began to realize it's
[1:34:14] god trying to say the same thing it was
[1:34:16] all hidden until the same time so in
[1:34:19] other words for you to know who this
[1:34:21] fright was how she was gonna come
[1:34:23] everything about her you had to listen
[1:34:26] to the voice of the seventh angel
[1:34:28] messenger
[1:34:30] it didn't come by anybody else it didn't
[1:34:32] come by any other teaching in fact but
[1:34:35] of adam says this takes more than just
[1:34:37] theology or studying the scripture or
[1:34:40] trying to put the scripture together
[1:34:42] this is divine inspiration from god
[1:34:49] it says the meat sin
[1:34:51] the meat seed it's the seed back it was
[1:34:54] a denomination it died and it perished
[1:34:56] but the evening time message will show
[1:34:58] the evening
[1:34:59] results like to show
[1:35:01] to show the evening time results he says
[1:35:04] now he says in jesus time midday it
[1:35:07] showed the midday result jesus it says
[1:35:10] the the the the beginning message saw
[1:35:13] the beginning result he met creation
[1:35:16] he made his son
[1:35:18] in his own image in the midday
[1:35:20] in the evening time he made
[1:35:23] a bride for it
[1:35:28] the bride was not made
[1:35:30] until the evening time
[1:35:34] no one knew anything about this bride
[1:35:38] until the evening time
[1:35:40] that's the revelation of her
[1:35:42] it says see
[1:35:44] it see it says see
[1:35:46] what by his word
[1:35:49] how did he form the earth how did he
[1:35:51] speak into existence by his word
[1:35:55] he says how he how
[1:35:58] he says who was his son the word in the
[1:36:01] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:36:03] with god and the word was made flesh and
[1:36:06] dwelt among us now i want you to
[1:36:08] remember tonight
[1:36:10] this morning we read this when he asked
[1:36:12] who is the son of man he repeated the
[1:36:15] same sentence he says who is the son of
[1:36:17] man he says in the beginning was the
[1:36:19] word the word was with god and the word
[1:36:21] was god in other words the son of man
[1:36:24] was not william branham the son of man
[1:36:26] was the revealing of all the thoughts
[1:36:28] that god had within him before the
[1:36:31] foundation of the world and you will
[1:36:33] take it and encapsulate it in the flesh
[1:36:35] of in the body of jesus that when it
[1:36:37] comes it will open the whole mystery
[1:36:44] it says
[1:36:46] how
[1:36:47] it says
[1:36:48] who was the son the word in the
[1:36:50] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:36:51] god and what was god and it was made
[1:36:53] flesh and dwelt among us how will he how
[1:36:56] will he take his bride
[1:36:58] by the word
[1:37:00] not by a new cart not by theologian's
[1:37:03] idea but according to his word he will
[1:37:05] identify her
[1:37:08] he says don't put one thing to it or
[1:37:11] take away anything from it leave it that
[1:37:14] way see he says now
[1:37:16] 178 it says the evening time he
[1:37:20] he says the evening time he promised he
[1:37:22] would reveal through the opening of the
[1:37:25] seven the seven seals and show what the
[1:37:28] church had missed back there revelation
[1:37:31] 10 malachite 4 luke 17 30 he says
[1:37:34] he said
[1:37:35] he he will do it now let's not mix it up
[1:37:40] let's keep it
[1:37:41] right like that
[1:37:45] let's keep it the way it is
[1:37:48] why because
[1:37:51] people came and they probe and they
[1:37:53] probe them
[1:37:54] they came in the probe and they thought
[1:37:56] that they had the only interpretation
[1:37:58] about what was going to happen and oh he
[1:38:00] was going to do this here all this pride
[1:38:02] and what is even the definition of bride
[1:38:05] and everything let me continue on for
[1:38:07] the second time
[1:38:08] and he continues on this is another
[1:38:10] message he says
[1:38:12] he says
[1:38:13] it says
[1:38:16] let me skip here speaks about the seed
[1:38:18] it says
[1:38:19] in a very plain language
[1:38:21] in a very plain language to the true
[1:38:24] bride of christ was made in the mind of
[1:38:28] god eternally
[1:38:31] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:38:34] christ was made was in the mind of
[1:38:37] christ eternally
[1:38:40] he says do not express until
[1:38:45] each came forth in the designation
[1:38:48] decreased season
[1:38:50] as each member came forth became
[1:38:52] expressed into the place of it in the
[1:38:56] body
[1:38:57] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:39:01] word seed bride
[1:39:03] the literal spoken word seed bride and
[1:39:06] though she is feminine by designation
[1:39:09] she is also called the body of christ
[1:39:12] it is very apparent that she ought to be
[1:39:16] called
[1:39:17] for
[1:39:18] for for
[1:39:19] for for that she's predestinated him
[1:39:23] come from the same source
[1:39:27] oh my brother my sister this is not
[1:39:30] another creation lower than what was
[1:39:33] made in the beginning
[1:39:35] this is christ now you remember when eve
[1:39:38] came about this was a byproduct which
[1:39:40] was made after the whole creation was
[1:39:42] finished oh but it was only in types and
[1:39:46] the reason why god let her fail was
[1:39:48] because he had a greater plane in that
[1:39:50] fall that he would come now and out of
[1:39:53] christ himself there will come a bright
[1:39:55] that can never fail why because the same
[1:39:58] as he was this pride is going to be
[1:40:05] he says it's the very apparent that she
[1:40:08] ought to be called
[1:40:09] that she was predestinated in him came
[1:40:12] from the same source was eternal with
[1:40:15] him and now manifested in many members
[1:40:19] body whereas god was manifested in one
[1:40:23] in our lord jesus christ
[1:40:25] oh he continues on he says now then
[1:40:29] now then he says
[1:40:31] here we are coming to a conclusion what
[1:40:33] is the conclusion
[1:40:35] as the eternal logos was manifested
[1:40:38] in the sun
[1:40:40] and
[1:40:41] and jesus dwelt
[1:40:43] and in jesus dwell all the fullness of
[1:40:45] god bodily and the eternal was one
[1:40:50] and eternal and that eternal one was the
[1:40:52] father manifested in the flesh
[1:40:55] thereby gain the title of son
[1:40:58] even so eternal is the thoughts
[1:41:02] is the thoughts in our turn
[1:41:05] became the manifest the the many members
[1:41:07] spoken word seed
[1:41:09] manifested in flesh those eternal
[1:41:12] thoughts doubt those eternal thoughts
[1:41:14] now manifested in the flesh of the son
[1:41:17] of god
[1:41:18] even as we are all we are so-called
[1:41:22] did not become seed by rebirth
[1:41:26] we were seed and therefore we were
[1:41:28] reborn by only but for only the elect
[1:41:32] can be reborn what is he saying
[1:41:35] this is part of god's plan in the
[1:41:37] beginning
[1:41:38] the bride existed in the beginning she
[1:41:40] was eternal with him she
[1:41:43] didn't gain somehow her eternal life
[1:41:45] because of christ and then christ died
[1:41:48] for her and then
[1:41:49] you know god made her no all of that was
[1:41:52] part of god's plan that through the
[1:41:55] redemption she can be connected right
[1:41:57] back
[1:41:58] she's equal with him
[1:42:12] he says
[1:42:17] the true church of jesus christ the
[1:42:20] bride
[1:42:21] is like pure gold
[1:42:26] her
[1:42:26] righteousness is his righteousness
[1:42:30] her attributes
[1:42:32] are his own glorious attribute
[1:42:35] her identity is found in him
[1:42:41] was he he says
[1:42:44] what what he is
[1:42:46] she is to reflect
[1:42:50] what what he has
[1:42:53] she is to
[1:42:54] manifest there's not a fault in her
[1:43:00] you talk about our source
[1:43:02] of perfection
[1:43:06] i say this the only thing we see
[1:43:07] ourselves with fault
[1:43:09] is if when we keep our eyes on this
[1:43:11] mortal man
[1:43:12] when we look at the mortal man the
[1:43:14] struggle that he goes through
[1:43:16] but remember the promise is
[1:43:19] it's the seed
[1:43:20] that has to come to that revelation and
[1:43:23] when the seed comes through the
[1:43:24] revelation it promises it will take this
[1:43:27] flesh under his subjection
[1:43:30] but it has to start with a seed it which
[1:43:33] has to start with thy eternal germ
[1:43:35] within you
[1:43:36] coming to the manifestation of realizing
[1:43:39] who's this bride the bride is the word
[1:43:42] coming to pass the bride is the
[1:43:44] manifestation of this hour he says at
[1:43:46] one place the bride is what christ
[1:43:49] promised that the manifestation of him
[1:43:52] anybody who wants to see him will have
[1:43:54] to see him through the members of the
[1:43:56] bride
[1:44:02] he says
[1:44:06] if i could just skip for the take of
[1:44:07] time
[1:44:10] it says
[1:44:16] now
[1:44:19] if we are those attributes of god
[1:44:22] we cannot live by creed
[1:44:25] we cannot live by denomination
[1:44:27] we must live by the word
[1:44:30] because the bride is part of the
[1:44:32] bridegroom
[1:44:33] like any wife is part of her husband
[1:44:36] therefore we must
[1:44:38] be that word bride
[1:44:40] and
[1:44:41] what is the word bride
[1:44:44] the manifestation
[1:44:46] of this hour
[1:44:47] the bride not a creed not a denomination
[1:44:51] but a living oracle of god
[1:44:56] the leaving word
[1:44:58] of god the leaving word of god
[1:45:02] now remember we just read it says
[1:45:05] by the same word that he created the
[1:45:07] heavens and the earth in the beginning
[1:45:10] by the same word in the noon that he
[1:45:12] came and he spoke his son christ to come
[1:45:14] into existence by that same word he's
[1:45:17] speaking and calling the bride at the
[1:45:19] end time
[1:45:21] he says
[1:45:23] he says
[1:45:25] a living attribute of god displaying
[1:45:29] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:45:32] of god in the form of a bride
[1:45:35] that that to be expressed in this hour
[1:45:37] that we are living in
[1:45:39] it says martin luther could not express
[1:45:41] the attribute that we express because
[1:45:44] that was in the beginning the
[1:45:46] resurrection like a corn of wheat that
[1:45:49] went into the earth
[1:45:51] the bride it says the bride in the end
[1:45:53] time it says and notice
[1:45:56] not only the bride wash
[1:45:59] washed forgiven
[1:46:01] but she's also justified
[1:46:03] it says did you ever
[1:46:05] did you ever try the word did you ever
[1:46:07] try the word justified and see what it
[1:46:09] means
[1:46:11] now for instance if brother green speaks
[1:46:14] about how if he didn't do anything or if
[1:46:17] he went and did something and you say
[1:46:19] he's forgiven that's forgiveness but if
[1:46:21] he never touched it you can never come
[1:46:24] and say you are forgiven because i never
[1:46:26] done it in the first place so the the
[1:46:28] righteousness of christ
[1:46:31] has come that's come upon the bride has
[1:46:33] brought the bride into a position where
[1:46:36] she's not even accused she's not even
[1:46:39] found guilty she's not even found having
[1:46:42] been associated with those things
[1:46:48] why because
[1:46:49] we are his workmanship
[1:46:53] i want to just say this
[1:46:55] it's very important as a member even as
[1:46:58] the last time because remember when we
[1:47:00] hear these things about wars and rumors
[1:47:02] of wars and and and there's things
[1:47:04] that's happening you know people get all
[1:47:06] oh the end time the end time yeah but
[1:47:09] it's very important we realize us that
[1:47:11] are part of the member of the bride how
[1:47:13] am i advancing towards that perfection
[1:47:16] we can't be settled with just saying oh
[1:47:19] i go to church and i hear the word as
[1:47:21] our pastor say this morning satan will
[1:47:23] let you do those things satan will let
[1:47:25] you come to church he will let you even
[1:47:27] hear and rejoice part of it but what he
[1:47:30] doesn't want you to do is to become one
[1:47:32] with that word is to let the eternal
[1:47:35] seed and say god i'm all for you
[1:47:38] whatever you want to do with me let the
[1:47:40] seed inside of you take hold and begin
[1:47:43] to manifest who this bride is
[1:47:46] now listen to what he says
[1:47:48] he speaks about
[1:47:50] i can even relate this to what's
[1:47:52] happening outside it says
[1:47:54] like israel it says back in the promised
[1:47:57] land
[1:47:58] she don't know it says she don't know
[1:48:01] how she's how she got back she was just
[1:48:04] automatically put back there
[1:48:07] why
[1:48:08] national force put her back in her place
[1:48:15] he says now
[1:48:16] i'm going to say something
[1:48:19] national force put israel in a homeland
[1:48:23] national forest puts the church in the
[1:48:26] world council of churches
[1:48:28] but the power of god will put the people
[1:48:30] in the bride
[1:48:32] we are being moved by the power of god
[1:48:35] and perhaps our understanding even when
[1:48:38] we say the end time the manifestation of
[1:48:41] son oftentimes people jump quickly to
[1:48:44] just say you know all we think about is
[1:48:46] oh scroll being brought into existence
[1:48:48] mountain being uh brought down or stones
[1:48:51] being controlled and all of those things
[1:48:53] but i want to remind you that the
[1:48:55] manifestations of sons becomes starts
[1:48:58] with a new birth it starts with the new
[1:49:01] birth and the sea taking hold and it's
[1:49:03] one step and walking by one step until
[1:49:06] he brings you into that position to the
[1:49:09] place where he wants you to control
[1:49:10] whatever he has placed before you
[1:49:13] it's not just walking up and say well
[1:49:15] let me try today can i can i move
[1:49:18] mountains in can i do this and can i do
[1:49:20] this no it's the power of god within the
[1:49:23] word of god the same power that saved
[1:49:26] you the same power that convicted you
[1:49:28] that same power that took away the
[1:49:30] nature of the world that same power is
[1:49:33] controlling you why because he's putting
[1:49:36] you in the members of the bride
[1:49:41] and he says
[1:49:44] the world forces this way
[1:49:47] the world forces that way
[1:49:49] but god forces upwards
[1:49:52] the spirit of god which is the word of
[1:49:55] god
[1:49:56] my word is spirit and life
[1:49:59] will put the bride in her place
[1:50:02] it says cause
[1:50:04] she's recognized her position in the
[1:50:06] word
[1:50:07] then she's in christ
[1:50:11] i tell you being in christ means so much
[1:50:13] more to me today than he did yesterday
[1:50:16] why because i'm understanding that
[1:50:19] all i have to do
[1:50:21] is find out what did christ do
[1:50:24] when i know what he did
[1:50:26] then i know i can do it
[1:50:29] you say what do you mean
[1:50:30] because
[1:50:32] i'm in him
[1:50:35] remember he spoke about united states
[1:50:38] it says all that she is
[1:50:41] all of her failure i i identify with
[1:50:44] that
[1:50:46] all of her glory identify with that
[1:50:48] everything she's ever been
[1:50:50] but not just to identify in all the
[1:50:53] failures but also identifying all its
[1:50:56] victory
[1:50:57] every victory that it's ever won
[1:51:00] every war every good thing that it's
[1:51:02] ever done in the natural you identify
[1:51:05] with it too so are the members of the
[1:51:08] bride everything that christ is we are
[1:51:11] called to identify with it so therefore
[1:51:13] we can't look at ourselves and say i'm a
[1:51:15] failure i'm this you're looking at the
[1:51:17] wrong person
[1:51:19] looking at the wrong place
[1:51:21] you're starting it all wrong
[1:51:24] what you have to realize is i need to
[1:51:26] find out that seed that can take hold of
[1:51:29] this flesh
[1:51:30] it's no longer my life as peter as paul
[1:51:32] as as the disciple can paul casey says
[1:51:35] it's no longer me that liveth it's
[1:51:37] christ i live how is it that christ that
[1:51:39] lives within me it's a seed it's a life
[1:51:42] within me that's controlling this flesh
[1:51:45] what i want to do i can't do it because
[1:51:47] what i want to do is something tells me
[1:51:49] to do something different why it's a
[1:51:51] seed god has a purpose for that seed he
[1:51:54] has a direction in the path that he
[1:51:56] wants it to take and nothing can stop it
[1:52:00] why because we're going back to eternity
[1:52:03] amen god bless you if you could stand
[1:52:05] amen the musician they're gone
[1:52:12] amen
[1:52:17] amen did you get all that
[1:52:20] i'm glad you did because there's a lot
[1:52:21] in there that's right i'm still feasting
[1:52:24] on it trying to figure it out
[1:52:27] you know what it's not by figuring it
[1:52:29] out is it
[1:52:30] it's my revelation
[1:52:32] hey man i hope that you got
[1:52:35] that one statement brother billy made
[1:52:37] just thrilled me so much he said even
[1:52:39] though she was in the feminine
[1:52:42] part
[1:52:44] if we can just get it in our mind
[1:52:48] in the beginning
[1:52:50] god made man and what
[1:52:52] his image and likeness adam was the
[1:52:54] first adam and he was both what
[1:52:58] male and female
[1:53:01] that's how they were together in the
[1:53:03] beginning
[1:53:05] him and her
[1:53:08] united together
[1:53:11] to make what god had in his mind
[1:53:14] you're the female part of god
[1:53:17] amen
[1:53:18] and now we're being brought what
[1:53:20] back together again
[1:53:22] back joined up to exactly what god had
[1:53:25] oh if you can when you how can you say
[1:53:28] bride
[1:53:29] without saying wife
[1:53:33] how can you say bride without saying
[1:53:36] union
[1:53:37] how can you say bride without these two
[1:53:39] becoming one
[1:53:42] you know
[1:53:43] when we can start thinking of ourselves
[1:53:46] as a bride
[1:53:49] you know a lot of people i have a lot of
[1:53:51] good friends
[1:53:53] and i if i could i don't know how the
[1:53:56] vocabulary to express it
[1:53:58] but
[1:54:00] good
[1:54:01] sisters that are
[1:54:02] good friends

[1:54:08] good
[1:54:09] uh friendship

[1:54:26] they don't have access
[1:54:28] but the wife has access leslie has
[1:54:31] access
[1:54:32] in in in the natural if i leave
[1:54:34] everything goes to her
[1:54:37] well what did he do when he left
[1:54:41] he left everything to her
[1:54:44] because she's him right
[1:54:46] oh it's we're entering in you understand
[1:54:50] we're entering in to a new
[1:54:54] mental
[1:54:56] and spiritual relationship with the word
[1:55:00] to we're no longer sinners
[1:55:03] we're no longer
[1:55:04] working our way to heaven but we're

[1:55:24] word of god when you start approaching
[1:55:26] it i'm one with this

[1:55:44] oh it gets so good
[1:55:48] it gets so good it gets so wonderful
[1:55:52] we can't keep walking around oh i'm
[1:55:54] trying to work my head i hope he takes
[1:55:55] me to heaven when you come up and say
[1:55:57] i'm married

[1:56:23] and he espouses himself to her
[1:56:26] and tells her that
[1:56:28] he's going to come back and marry her
[1:56:31] so now they're one
[1:56:33] she's rejoicing in the world's laughing
[1:56:35] at her
[1:56:36] but you know why
[1:56:38] they all got dolled up but he had all
[1:56:41] the money
[1:56:43] to make her and dress her and do
[1:56:46] whatever he wanted for her
[1:56:51] he had all of it
[1:56:54] he just wanted someone
[1:56:56] that he could become one with
