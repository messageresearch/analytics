[40:17] evening

[40:22] strong we ask you to bless us now in
[40:26] your precious name we pray amen
[40:29] amen God bless you let's open our Bibles
[40:32] this evening
[40:33] um and certainly enjoyed the word this
[40:37] morning and the move of the Lord and we
[40:39] want to just talk a little bit
[40:42] along some lines there to help us
[40:46] we want to turn to scripture Matthew the
[40:50] 12th chapter the
[40:53] 43rd and 45th verse
[40:56] of Matthew the 12th chapter
[40:59] and look
[41:17] 43
[41:19] and 45 of
[41:22] Matthew the 12th chapter
[41:25] and
[41:32] okay
[41:33] my page is stuck together here here they
[41:37] are
[41:39] it says
[41:45] all right
[41:54] all right let me see if I got it right
[41:56] here
[41:57] Matthew
[41:59] 43 yeah right okay okay it's a 42nd
[42:04] verse and it says 30 43rd verse the 12th
[42:08] chapter
[42:09] when an unclean spirit is gone out of a
[42:12] man
[42:13] he walked it through Dry places seeking
[42:16] rest
[42:17] and findeth none
[42:19] because then he said I will return unto
[42:23] my house
[42:24] from which I come out and when he has
[42:28] come he findeth an empty swept and
[42:32] garnished then go a thief and take this
[42:35] with him seven other Spirits more wicked
[42:39] than himself and they enter in and dwell
[42:43] there and the last date of the man is
[42:46] worse than the first even so shall it be
[42:50] also unto this wicked generation father
[42:54] we ask you to bless your word to us in
[42:57] your precious name we pray amen amen God
[43:00] bless you may be seated
[43:06] foreign
[43:10] I don't know exactly how to go about uh
[43:14] saying what's on my heart
[43:17] but
[43:18] um
[43:21] what I'd like to talk about is
[43:25] how that we can keep
[43:30] our experience Deliverance in healing
[43:34] what's what's the secret
[43:38] to keeping it
[43:40] and and I think if we can just go for a
[43:44] moment and understand how the spirit
[43:47] works
[43:48] and then we could see our our place in
[43:52] it because I love services like this
[43:56] morning that when the Lord offers uh
[44:00] that through the word of God his
[44:03] delivering power act and so you you hear
[44:07] a message and it stimulates your heart
[44:10] because maybe you're in a like our
[44:13] brother brought this morning maybe
[44:14] you're in a place where you're down he's
[44:17] called it being in a season and and so
[44:21] you hear a a tithing of gladness and you
[44:25] hear uh the word of God being expressed
[44:28] to you and you hear those things and it
[44:31] causes in you a great joy
[44:34] and a great stimulation and you're glad
[44:39] to hear it because it's good news hey
[44:42] I'm not stuck here God cares you know
[44:45] this isn't the end of the matter God's
[44:48] in control so it it brings to us a hope
[44:52] and it brings to us
[44:57] a sense of well-being or Deliverance
[45:01] that I don't have to stay here
[45:03] and and so when when we're moved upon uh
[45:08] a lot of times then we will go to be
[45:10] prayed for
[45:11] and uh and the the presence of the Lord
[45:15] will come and it will it'll bless us
[45:20] and we we have that blessing in in our
[45:25] lives and and so we feel like God's done
[45:28] something for us
[45:30] but if it's not taken a step further
[45:33] that's what we want to talk about how
[45:35] can we hang on to that experience
[45:38] and and so we we we understand we've
[45:42] been taught uh we have such a great uh
[45:47] teacher in our messenger Not only would
[45:52] I say that we saw the love of God on
[45:54] display
[45:56] projected to us uh we saw that Jesus
[46:01] Christ was the same yesterday today and
[46:03] forever and we saw that all things were
[46:07] possible I think that's what our hope
[46:10] comes in is that no matter how dark it
[46:13] looked or what dark the dark decision it
[46:15] it seems like we've made or the
[46:17] consequences the gospel comes and tell
[46:20] us I'll take that and throw that in the
[46:23] sea of God's forgetfulness to be
[46:25] remembered no more you can have a fresh
[46:29] start so the spirit moves and and so I
[46:34] just wanted to bring this out in just a
[46:36] couple because it's so simple and I
[46:38] don't want to be long can I but I want
[46:41] us to understand
[46:43] that we get lost
[46:45] in the transition
[46:49] and so this is what the prophet of God
[46:51] says in the Easter seal
[46:55] he says now we notice it's the same
[46:58] spirit that raised him from the grave
[47:01] that dwelleth in US
[47:05] now how could that be the spirit that
[47:09] raised up
[47:10] God Jesus from the dead has dwelt in us
[47:15] and we just listen to a wonderful tape
[47:18] on that didn't we Perfection now there's
[47:21] nothing we can do but a perfect gift
[47:23] came and it was the perfect sacrifice
[47:26] for whatever that we have need of and
[47:29] because he became a Kinsmen Redeemer now
[47:33] his Spirit can return back on the
[47:36] believer and so we we have that now he
[47:40] says the spirit he says now it's the
[47:45] spirit that quickens not the word that
[47:48] quickens now when he said when we're
[47:51] talking there the word we're not talking
[47:53] about the word the person Jesus we're
[47:56] talking about the scriptural promises
[48:01] they don't quicken in themselves in
[48:05] other words you read the promise right
[48:07] so you read the promise I'll forgive you
[48:10] of your sins I'll I'll deliver you I'll
[48:14] do this I'll do that I'll do this Peter
[48:16] says by these great and precious
[48:18] promises we are partakers of divine
[48:21] nature so we have that scripture uh
[48:26] written there and that's what the
[48:29] preaching of the Gospel does it comes
[48:31] along and it brings to your remembrance
[48:34] that scripture okay do you remember that
[48:39] that that's your promise and that's
[48:43] something that's spoken of you but
[48:46] that's not what makes it alive
[48:49] and this is what he goes on to say he
[48:52] said now it's the spirit that quickness
[48:55] it's not the word that quickens just
[48:59] reading it doesn't Quicken it
[49:01] you understand just seeing it's there
[49:04] and doesn't Quicken it it takes an
[49:07] outside force
[49:09] is it something to move on you and to to
[49:14] bring that scripture to you by
[49:18] revelation
[49:19] and now you take it as this is this
[49:24] pertains to me
[49:26] actually it's been quickened to you and
[49:29] Quicken means that it's been made alive
[49:31] right so now the spirit that quickens is
[49:35] not the word that quickens is the spirit
[49:37] that quickens the word or gives that
[49:42] word life
[49:44] now there's our key point tonight gives
[49:50] he says
[49:52] gives it wings to fly gives it access
[49:57] it's the spirit that does that
[50:01] now so we're wanting to talk about the
[50:03] experience how we can hold on to it look
[50:06] in our lives what takes place if we find
[50:10] ourselves in a time of need we find
[50:13] ourselves we all go up and down we all
[50:16] black tie we're all on the mountain and
[50:18] in the valley and everything and we go
[50:21] through those things in the word of God
[50:23] extends to us hope and then the spirit
[50:26] comes along and quickens that to us and
[50:30] he makes it alive and he makes it so
[50:34] that that we can grab hold of it and so
[50:39] when when the spirit it when it IT
[50:41] quickens it and it becomes alive now
[50:46] though this is where what we've got to
[50:49] transform
[50:50] Ed into because you understand that the
[50:55] season as our brothers spoken for in
[50:57] this season that we're in is we're
[51:00] moving past being
[51:03] recipients but we're being possessors
[51:08] so uh to become a possessor of
[51:12] Deliverance and not just a recipient
[51:16] so that promise is always there it's
[51:19] always there for you every time you're
[51:21] down every time you're sick every time
[51:24] you sin that healing's always there for
[51:27] you every time that that you you
[51:30] backslide that Deliverance is always
[51:33] there for you but we want to how can we
[51:36] move past always always being of the
[51:41] recipient of it every time that we need
[51:44] it and now become the possessor of it
[51:49] so it's always there for us foreign
[51:52] you know what I mean he can always go
[51:55] drink from that fountain drink from that
[51:57] Fountain but this is a time that where
[52:01] that Fountain no longer wants to be on
[52:03] the outside where you're drinking from
[52:06] it every time you need it but now it
[52:09] becomes something that you own
[52:11] you have
[52:14] the the secret to that is we don't want
[52:19] to be because I see it over the years is
[52:22] that
[52:23] the Lord will once again let us know
[52:27] that he wants to deliver us
[52:32] he wants to heal us he's a mighty God
[52:36] and we all rejoice in that praise God my
[52:39] God can do anything
[52:41] we have a god that is above all power
[52:45] and and almight and we take hope in that
[52:49] and and then we run we run to that
[52:53] Fountain and we get that deliverance and
[52:57] we're temporarily if I get
[52:59] use that word we're delivered and we
[53:04] feel that Deliverance can we feel that
[53:06] joy we feel that weight lifted off of us
[53:09] we feel that burden come from us we've
[53:12] had a real genuine experience
[53:17] but how do you hang on to it
[53:20] okay well how does it transform from
[53:24] being something that you could just
[53:26] received something that's just blessed
[53:29] you something that's just anointed you
[53:32] to now where it becomes something that
[53:35] you have
[53:36] that you possess
[53:39] Ed
[53:40] okay because you'll never go back you'll
[53:43] you'll never go back
[53:46] for that same thing over and over and
[53:49] over and over and over again
[53:52] because it's like the it's like the
[53:57] the the the
[53:58] Deliverance fountain
[54:01] or The Cloud of troubles and the clouds
[54:04] of Trials and the worries of life
[54:07] and the cares of Life choke up our choke
[54:11] out the vision of it
[54:13] and then the word of God comes and opens
[54:16] the fountain to us again and then we run
[54:18] in there and we take a drink
[54:21] and we Rejoice we're glad we praise God
[54:24] we feel that but then we go out from
[54:28] that and it's not long those same clouds
[54:31] come in again
[54:34] okay and we find I'm returning back I'm
[54:36] returning back I'm returning back
[54:40] what does the believer have to do
[54:46] in order to connect
[54:48] that Fountain doesn't get clouded over
[54:52] because it's something that he has
[54:58] that can't be taken over it changed your
[55:01] life
[55:02] like our brother talked about this
[55:03] morning I loved it how how the seasons
[55:06] they come upon us different times and
[55:09] different season comes upon us but can
[55:12] those seasons have an effect on you but
[55:15] there Comes A Time in the believer's
[55:17] life where no longer are those Seasons
[55:21] governing him he's governing the seasons
[55:24] he's a Mystic he walks in a world by him
[55:28] off he's in control of every situation
[55:31] in every circumstance and there is this
[55:34] thing isn't getting me no more
[55:37] amen it's bit me a hundred times and
[55:40] I've ran through the fountain a hundred
[55:43] times and God's delivered me a hundred
[55:45] times but now I'm I want to come to the
[55:48] place where I don't go there anymore
[55:53] I really want to come to the place where
[55:55] I don't go there for me anymore but I go
[55:59] there for somebody else
[56:03] because I've I I've grabbed the hold
[56:07] of what it is that he's doing
[56:12] that's because old people go to the
[56:14] fountain at the end and they they they
[56:18] partake of the
[56:22] they partake of the blessing they play
[56:25] take of the water they partake of the
[56:28] Tree of Life freely they partake of it
[56:31] but they can't grab a hold of it and
[56:35] it's okay if I could just uh
[56:39] say it this way because when they go
[56:41] there
[56:43] and they hear the word of God it
[56:45] inspires them and they say I want that
[56:49] I want some of that I need that
[56:53] but they never really understand what it
[56:57] is they got
[57:02] they felt it
[57:05] they felt the effect of it
[57:08] it moved on their heart
[57:11] and it's gone
[57:13] and praise God
[57:16] praise God but you can't stop there
[57:20] you understand you can't say I I got I
[57:24] got delivered
[57:25] I got healed
[57:28] you got to know what was it that you got
[57:36] what was it
[57:39] what happened
[57:41] what has taken place
[57:43] then when you can grab a hold of that
[57:46] and you know what it is then you can
[57:49] possess it but you can't possess
[57:52] something that you don't know what it is
[57:54] you know it was a Feeling
[57:57] you know you know the result of it do
[58:00] you know how you felt full of fresh air
[58:03] and fresh breath how many's experience
[58:07] when a ton of bricks is lifted Alfalfa
[58:10] yeah
[58:11] why it's wonderful
[58:14] but if I was to say to you what happened
[58:18] well we've got to get past the place we
[58:21] say I don't know God just did it
[58:26] because God doesn't do things like that
[58:30] God only does what he says he would do
[58:34] God keeps his
[58:36] word
[58:38] he said so that settles it
[58:41] look a Believer has got to be able to go
[58:45] back because that's faith
[58:48] so when you hear the word you respond
[58:53] if you'll come and we'll lay Mark your
[58:56] hands on you you'll feel forgiven you've
[58:59] you'll be healed you'll be made well and
[59:02] the believer comes up and they
[59:04] experience it
[59:07] they have the results of it
[59:10] and they go off the platform rejoicing
[59:13] because they no longer feel the way that
[59:17] they felt they feel the burdens lifted
[59:19] and everything but you they can't
[59:21] identify
[59:23] what has taken place
[59:27] what did he just do
[59:31] now you will say he delivered me I say
[59:34] no
[59:35] I say it's beyond that
[59:39] he fulfilled his word
[59:44] so if you if if so if you don't know
[59:48] what if you don't know what happened to
[59:51] you
[59:52] then then that's what causes you to to
[59:56] go back and forth back and forth back
[1:00:00] and forth because you don't know what
[1:00:02] did he just do
[1:00:04] what has transpired what has taken place
[1:00:08] what was this
[1:00:10] and when I know what it is then I can
[1:00:13] grab a hold of it and I can possess it
[1:00:16] when you don't know what it is you can't
[1:00:19] you can't take it
[1:00:23] you can get the benefit
[1:00:25] and it is wonderful but how would you
[1:00:28] like to go from where you felt it
[1:00:31] do you have it
[1:00:36] you know and and and if you have it
[1:00:41] then it's with you always to do the same
[1:00:45] thing over and over and over again you
[1:00:50] have it now
[1:00:53] it's like it's like
[1:00:55] it's like uh a medicine you know you
[1:00:59] take a medicine you take the medicine
[1:01:01] every time you're sick but if you
[1:01:03] possess that medicine
[1:01:06] and every time that sickness arises that
[1:01:09] medicine's already there because you
[1:01:12] possess it
[1:01:14] so it's always on the spot it's always
[1:01:18] on the spot it's always there doing
[1:01:20] exceedingly and abundantly for you above
[1:01:24] what you can even ask or think it's not
[1:01:27] something you got to go searching for
[1:01:29] because it's not something you've got to
[1:01:31] be told about you you've heard it once
[1:01:34] you understood what it is you take
[1:01:37] possession of it now you always have it
[1:01:41] present tense with you and it'll
[1:01:44] continue to do always for you what it
[1:01:48] did the first time
[1:01:51] you understand where I'm going
[1:01:54] and that's because because you know what
[1:01:58] you got
[1:02:01] you know what you got you know what
[1:02:03] happened
[1:02:04] you know what's come to pass
[1:02:07] so God he only brings to pass his word
[1:02:11] Peter said by these exceedingly great
[1:02:14] and precious promises we become
[1:02:17] partakers of divine nature
[1:02:20] look when when so when you receive
[1:02:24] something of him
[1:02:28] the quit the spirit is quickening that
[1:02:32] word to you giving that word wings and
[1:02:36] making that word come alive what we have
[1:02:40] to know is what word
[1:02:44] did he just make come alive
[1:02:51] because Faith final resting place
[1:02:54] is the word of God
[1:02:56] this is in God in Simplicity for faith
[1:03:00] is the substance of things
[1:03:02] hope for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:03:06] and Faith takes its final resting place
[1:03:09] on the word of God there is where it
[1:03:14] Finds Its resting place you understand
[1:03:17] it's the resting place of God's word
[1:03:22] so faith is the resting place is God's
[1:03:26] word so when something transpires in
[1:03:28] your life you've got to come to the
[1:03:31] realization and bring yourself to the
[1:03:33] spot that you study the scriptures
[1:03:36] because in them there's a life
[1:03:39] so you know what scripture
[1:03:42] just got fulfilled
[1:03:46] in me
[1:03:49] what was that when they laid hands on me
[1:03:52] and I got well
[1:03:55] you've got to be able to take that back
[1:03:58] and find the scripture the Elder shall
[1:04:01] lay their hands on me and we shall
[1:04:03] recover they shall anoint me with oil go
[1:04:07] into all the world preach the gospel Lay
[1:04:09] Your Hands on the sick and they shall
[1:04:11] recover when you experience that you've
[1:04:15] got to take it back to the word of God
[1:04:17] and you've got to say this is my resting
[1:04:20] place because this is what just has come
[1:04:25] to pass the scriptures have been
[1:04:28] fulfilled in me
[1:04:33] not an experience
[1:04:36] the experience is wonderful it's the
[1:04:38] it's what brings that word to life
[1:04:42] you can't you can't feel the presence of
[1:04:45] God without having experience
[1:04:49] I mean it's It's Supernatural
[1:04:54] but when it when you when you can come
[1:04:57] back and you can look at it and then you
[1:04:59] can say you can say this is the
[1:05:03] scripture that has been fulfilled it
[1:05:06] says now that word has been made flesh
[1:05:10] in me
[1:05:13] now you've got something to Anchor to
[1:05:18] that won't go away
[1:05:21] now you can possess that I own that
[1:05:26] I'm not talking about the experience the
[1:05:28] experience was wonderful
[1:05:33] I'm not talking about the emotion it'll
[1:05:37] make you emotional
[1:05:40] I watched a little uh
[1:05:43] news clip
[1:05:45] uh
[1:05:48] a very seldom have some of these things
[1:05:50] that happen
[1:05:52] that
[1:05:53] just moved me because the person
[1:05:56] involved is so genuine
[1:06:00] when is the time because I believe his
[1:06:02] name was brother Mike the man that got
[1:06:05] shot
[1:06:06] by the policeman the policeman literally
[1:06:08] was trying to take his life
[1:06:10] can he got up in the courthouse
[1:06:13] and he told the judge
[1:06:16] I want this court to know I've come to
[1:06:18] know the Lord Jesus Christ I totally
[1:06:20] forgive this man
[1:06:23] and that got me
[1:06:26] the other
[1:06:28] clip I saw and I don't even mind if you
[1:06:30] go look it up
[1:06:33] there was a police officer in Dallas
[1:06:36] here
[1:06:37] oh oh I guess it was a few years now
[1:06:40] that she's came home from work and she
[1:06:43] got off on the wrong floor
[1:06:45] to open the door to his her apartment
[1:06:49] thinking that it was her apartment and
[1:06:51] there was a gentleman in there and they
[1:06:53] they
[1:06:55] she she shot him
[1:06:59] and she was convicted
[1:07:02] of murder
[1:07:05] and I know there's a great disputing and
[1:07:09] all that female police officer
[1:07:13] but at the sentencing hearing
[1:07:17] the brother
[1:07:19] of the gentleman that was shot
[1:07:22] took the stand
[1:07:26] and he said okay was bitter
[1:07:30] I was full of hatred
[1:07:33] but his grandmother talked to him
[1:07:35] and he sat on that stand and he told
[1:07:38] that lady he says I don't
[1:07:41] hate you
[1:07:42] I forgive you
[1:07:44] I'm sorry this has ever happened
[1:07:48] to you
[1:07:50] and he looks up at the judge and he says
[1:07:52] your honor may I give her a hug
[1:07:57] the courtroom's in shock
[1:08:02] and the murderer they said it was murder
[1:08:05] I'm not put judged with that I don't
[1:08:07] think she intentionally meant to kill
[1:08:10] him but they felt with her training she
[1:08:13] should have not done that
[1:08:15] Eric and the
[1:08:18] brother
[1:08:19] of the person embraced in that courtroom
[1:08:23] and they cried on one another's
[1:08:25] shoulders
[1:08:27] that got me
[1:08:29] that was something that was genuine that
[1:08:33] was true forgiveness
[1:08:36] because someone that really genuinely
[1:08:38] forgave from their heart
[1:08:41] and wanted to show compassion can
[1:08:44] sympathy
[1:08:46] for the the the
[1:08:49] person that got themselves in a
[1:08:52] circumstance that was going to ruin
[1:08:56] their life forever
[1:08:58] because now she had to live with what
[1:09:00] she had done
[1:09:03] it
[1:09:04] was I watched it become flesh
[1:09:08] it no longer was something that was just
[1:09:11] on the paper a real genuine forgiveness
[1:09:14] when I saw Mike forgive that okay it no
[1:09:17] longer was just a written scripture
[1:09:20] about something now I can actually sit
[1:09:23] back and see it playing out in human
[1:09:27] form in flesh
[1:09:30] and when you receive a Deliverance you
[1:09:33] look receive a healing can you do you
[1:09:36] receive an experience that is not the
[1:09:40] experience in itself it's the word being
[1:09:43] made flesh
[1:09:47] that's what you've got to go back and
[1:09:49] anchor to that's what gives you the
[1:09:52] ability to take possession of it not
[1:09:55] because it's an experience because
[1:09:57] experiences fade
[1:10:02] they go away
[1:10:05] they're seasonal
[1:10:11] how many of you have shouted and just
[1:10:13] rejoiced
[1:10:15] five weeks later you're not running
[1:10:16] around shouting and rejoicing
[1:10:20] because the scripture says can in John 3
[1:10:25] 5 and 6.
[1:10:27] Saint John 3 5 and 6.
[1:10:33] and if you want if they have it on board
[1:10:36] if you want to read it it says Jesus
[1:10:38] answered and says verily verily I say
[1:10:40] unto thee accept amen
[1:10:44] be born both of water and of spirit
[1:10:50] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:10:54] that which is born of flesh is flesh and
[1:10:58] that which is born of spirit is spirit
[1:11:00] all if we could just come to the place
[1:11:03] we could separate our flesh from our
[1:11:05] spirit
[1:11:07] when we can do that then our spirit can
[1:11:10] take control of the flesh
[1:11:13] and it takes can control of the flesh by
[1:11:18] the word
[1:11:19] because Satan's battle is in the mind
[1:11:24] but the only weapon that God has given
[1:11:27] us to defeat Satan is his word
[1:11:31] and that's what the spirit does it
[1:11:34] quickens that word it makes it alive now
[1:11:38] it if it don't return back to you as the
[1:11:42] word being fulfilled then you've
[1:11:45] anchored in the experience but the
[1:11:48] experience is just the result it's not
[1:11:51] the cause
[1:11:54] the word was the cause the promise was
[1:11:58] the cause that's what you've got to see
[1:12:01] that you possessed you you now possessed
[1:12:05] that word promise because it was
[1:12:08] manifested in you and it became flesh in
[1:12:11] you that's what you see
[1:12:16] because what you felt will go away
[1:12:21] but if you know it was the word
[1:12:24] and you know it was the promise being
[1:12:26] fulfilled and you know what God did for
[1:12:29] you and you know what he did and you
[1:12:32] know how he did it now that becomes
[1:12:35] yours for eternity
[1:12:40] because Faith doesn't rest in the
[1:12:43] experience
[1:12:45] it doesn't rest in the healing
[1:12:48] it rests in the word
[1:12:50] because it's the evidence of things
[1:12:53] hoped for not seen
[1:12:56] so when you experience it which I love
[1:12:59] the experience I'd hate just to have
[1:13:01] some dry boned
[1:13:02] word experience
[1:13:04] that ain't no fun
[1:13:07] I like to see the devil defeated
[1:13:11] I don't like the guy
[1:13:15] I don't think he likes me
[1:13:19] but that that's not connect I don't walk
[1:13:22] away and say oh I was blessed
[1:13:27] well the rain falls on the just in the
[1:13:29] unjust
[1:13:33] or while that was wonderful
[1:13:35] and you're so happy what he did you
[1:13:38] understand what I'm trying to say you've
[1:13:40] got to take it back to where it can rest
[1:13:47] or where it can stay
[1:13:50] where it'll always be there because now
[1:13:53] it's your possession God fulfilled this
[1:13:57] scripture in my flesh Heaven and Earth
[1:14:00] will pass away but his word will not
[1:14:03] pass away that's no longer something
[1:14:06] that I experienced it though I
[1:14:09] experienced it but now I've taken it
[1:14:12] back to the word and now it was the word
[1:14:15] may flesh in me now I have that now as
[1:14:18] being a part of me I'm a possessor of it
[1:14:22] God fulfilled this scripture in this
[1:14:25] flesh right here
[1:14:29] take that from me
[1:14:32] you can't
[1:14:36] but if you don't take it back to the
[1:14:38] word to Anchor you now you start chasing
[1:14:41] the experience
[1:14:45] why because you name you've never laid
[1:14:48] hold of it
[1:14:51] it's like an Elusive Butterfly
[1:14:54] you felt it you've seen it you want more
[1:14:56] of it you want more of it you want more
[1:14:59] of it but if you know that that
[1:15:01] scripture is in you it's always there to
[1:15:05] be quickened when you need it
[1:15:11] you've already got the letter
[1:15:14] you've already got the token you've
[1:15:17] already got the ticket
[1:15:19] you don't got to go back up to the
[1:15:21] ticket counter and say I need another
[1:15:23] ticket I gotta take another trip
[1:15:28] no it's been settled
[1:15:30] why has it been settled not by the
[1:15:34] experience but by the word that was
[1:15:37] fulfilled
[1:15:42] that's where Faith rests
[1:15:46] it's the Promise by the promise we're
[1:15:50] partakers of the nature
[1:15:52] you can be a partaker of the nature but
[1:15:55] if you don't know what promise brought
[1:15:58] that to pass you have no identification
[1:16:04] that's when Jesus meant Satan
[1:16:08] he never said get behind me I've got the
[1:16:11] power
[1:16:13] ah
[1:16:15] he said it is written
[1:16:18] it is written
[1:16:21] let's just finish the scripture read a
[1:16:23] couple more
[1:16:24] it says
[1:16:29] can't enter the kingdom of God that
[1:16:31] which is born of the flesh is flesh that
[1:16:33] which is born of the spirit of spirit
[1:16:35] Marvel not that I say ye must be born
[1:16:39] again the wind bloweth wherever it
[1:16:42] willeth
[1:16:43] can thou hearest the sound of it but
[1:16:46] cannot tell from whence it cometh or for
[1:16:50] where it goeth so is every man that is
[1:16:53] formed of the spirit
[1:16:55] those things come and go
[1:16:59] we don't go by feeling do we
[1:17:02] did you feel it it's what did you
[1:17:05] believe it
[1:17:07] what do you believe
[1:17:09] you believe what he said if he said so
[1:17:13] that settles it
[1:17:15] if you if you received your healing
[1:17:20] and you've been revealed to you that
[1:17:22] you're healing you might rejoice in the
[1:17:25] season of your healing but sure enough
[1:17:29] Satan's going to come back like that
[1:17:32] unclean spirit and he's going to knock
[1:17:34] trying to get back in
[1:17:39] now what did God give you to keep him
[1:17:42] out
[1:17:45] not the feeling you had not the
[1:17:48] rejoicing that you had though if you got
[1:17:51] it you would rejoice
[1:17:56] praise God
[1:17:58] Shout
[1:17:59] say hallelujah
[1:18:01] but when you're done with the experience
[1:18:04] can you're done with the joy make sure
[1:18:08] you're Anchored In God's word
[1:18:12] this is what he said
[1:18:15] this is what's come to pass this is the
[1:18:19] scripture
[1:18:20] that God just got done fulfilling in My
[1:18:23] Flesh and I know Heaven and Earth will
[1:18:26] pass away but this word will not pass
[1:18:29] away
[1:18:31] got to get back to the word
[1:18:33] that's what there's so many people that
[1:18:36] go through experiences and they go
[1:18:38] through meetings and they go through
[1:18:40] these things and they know it's God and
[1:18:43] they Rejoice it's God and they worship
[1:18:45] God for it but they've never been able
[1:18:48] to take it back and find it in the
[1:18:50] scriptures search the scriptures for in
[1:18:54] them you think you have eternal life but
[1:18:56] they are which testify of me
[1:19:00] now you're becoming a possessor
[1:19:03] you're possessing that gate of the enemy
[1:19:07] he can no longer come through that gate
[1:19:11] because you have a scriptural
[1:19:13] fulfillment of the word lock in that
[1:19:17] door
[1:19:19] Hallelujah
[1:19:21] I'm telling you church it's word
[1:19:25] he is the word he was the word made
[1:19:28] flesh and when that promise scripture is
[1:19:33] fulfilled in you now you're that word
[1:19:36] made flesh
[1:19:41] and so no matter if you're sick as a dog
[1:19:44] you can say by his stripes I'm Healed
[1:19:51] the Lord delivereth me out of all my
[1:19:53] troubles
[1:19:55] he's my healer his thoughts towards me
[1:19:58] are good
[1:20:00] you take the word
[1:20:04] but if you've got to see it
[1:20:07] as being the word
[1:20:10] you've got to have the Revelation that
[1:20:14] that is what just happened to you
[1:20:19] what happened to you was that word
[1:20:22] coming to pass in you it was quickened
[1:20:26] and made alive
[1:20:28] for it says
[1:20:30] give the
[1:20:32] spirit it's the spirit that quickens so
[1:20:37] you know that that spirit
[1:20:40] came down on you
[1:20:43] and you felt it
[1:20:46] and it quickened that and made it alive
[1:20:51] you got the results
[1:20:53] now the question is what did he just do
[1:21:00] why leave that unanswered
[1:21:06] if that's unanswered
[1:21:08] you don't know where it came or what it
[1:21:10] did or what happened
[1:21:12] but when you can come back and get that
[1:21:15] scriptural
[1:21:16] Foundation
[1:21:19] when you can stand on it and said what
[1:21:22] happened to me was the word
[1:21:26] was fulfilled in me
[1:21:31] that's what
[1:21:33] I possess
[1:21:35] I possess the Fulfillment of the word
[1:21:38] because that won't pass away
[1:21:41] can that good he goes on to say look
[1:21:43] it's beautiful he says now the weed
[1:21:46] alone is just a wheat
[1:21:49] but when the quickening life gets into
[1:21:52] it into the wheat then it gives it life
[1:21:58] and we which are once death made in the
[1:22:02] image of God yet dead in sin and
[1:22:05] trespasses there's some way God had to
[1:22:09] get this quickening life into your
[1:22:12] mortal bodies I'm talking about your
[1:22:16] body
[1:22:17] so that quick knee life had to come in
[1:22:20] your body and now so you know what it is
[1:22:22] what just happened to me
[1:22:27] I felt something
[1:22:31] I was blessed I rejoiced I was happy
[1:22:36] which is true
[1:22:38] but take it that step further I've been
[1:22:40] quickened
[1:22:42] the words been made alive so now me and
[1:22:46] the word become one that's the invisible
[1:22:49] Union of the pride in Christ
[1:22:52] them recognizing that God is quickening
[1:22:56] the word that they are in them and it's
[1:23:00] coming to life
[1:23:03] and they know it's the word
[1:23:06] and they're resting
[1:23:10] on the word
[1:23:12] because that's its final resting place
[1:23:15] what I just experienced was not the
[1:23:19] experience itself though it was
[1:23:21] wonderful I've just experienced the
[1:23:26] scripture
[1:23:28] coming to pass in my life and be mating
[1:23:32] real therefore me and that scripture are
[1:23:36] one and I've just had an invisible Union
[1:23:39] with the bridegroom and the Heavenly
[1:23:42] bride
[1:23:43] oh I love it
[1:23:45] he said
[1:23:48] you know we could go to
[1:23:50] another great scripture
[1:23:54] of course we know the one in Peter
[1:23:57] that's always there how about did we
[1:24:01] read John 5
[1:24:03] John 5
[1:24:06] uh 37 38 and 39.
[1:24:12] and the father himself who hath sent me
[1:24:16] hath borne witness of me
[1:24:19] and ye have neither heard this voice at
[1:24:23] any time heard his voice at any time nor
[1:24:27] seen his shape
[1:24:29] and ye have you have not his word
[1:24:34] abiding in you
[1:24:36] for whom he hath sent him ye believe not
[1:24:42] they were blind
[1:24:45] search the scriptures
[1:24:47] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:24:50] life
[1:24:51] and they are
[1:24:53] they which testify of me
[1:24:57] ye will not come unto me that ye might
[1:25:00] have life
[1:25:04] oh Church
[1:25:06] that's what moves us into the next level
[1:25:11] where
[1:25:12] Pentecost they rejoice in the experience
[1:25:17] but they couldn't anchor to the word of
[1:25:20] the hour
[1:25:23] but now can you imagine when you put
[1:25:25] those both together
[1:25:29] praise God
[1:25:31] now you're worshiping for his word
[1:25:36] you're worshiping him for what he really
[1:25:39] is
[1:25:40] cannot kiss an anointing that falls
[1:25:43] under Justin on you not just a spirit
[1:25:46] that can be so close it would deceive
[1:25:49] the very elective possible that you have
[1:25:51] a pure identification that this was the
[1:25:57] word that came to pass
[1:26:02] but you got to search the scripture
[1:26:07] see we have we go through something
[1:26:11] and it's wonderful
[1:26:14] a brother comes up we pray for you
[1:26:17] and and we we say you're healed go for
[1:26:21] it and you feel it you walk away and
[1:26:24] then all of a sudden you're in dry
[1:26:25] places
[1:26:27] and because you didn't search the
[1:26:30] scripture
[1:26:32] and anchor that
[1:26:34] to a resting place
[1:26:37] where you could always know it's there
[1:26:39] and always have it and always refer to
[1:26:43] it
[1:26:43] yeah
[1:26:45] you start missing the experience
[1:26:50] so you hunt
[1:26:52] The Experience down
[1:26:54] the prophet of God said you run from
[1:26:56] revival to Revival to Revival
[1:27:02] I love the story of the newspaper boy
[1:27:05] it come up and he said
[1:27:08] he said Barbara said you believe you're
[1:27:11] healed he says I believe I'm Healed go
[1:27:12] your way you're healed
[1:27:16] and he's back in the prayer line three
[1:27:18] or nine nights later and he says
[1:27:22] I still can't see he says I thought you
[1:27:23] told me you're healed I thought you said
[1:27:26] the word of God said by your stripes I'm
[1:27:29] Healed
[1:27:30] now he no longer took it from what he
[1:27:34] felt he took it to the word so now it
[1:27:38] didn't matter how he felt
[1:27:42] because he had a precious promise
[1:27:48] and because of that word he was going to
[1:27:51] be a partaker of that divine nature
[1:27:55] so he didn't give to the word through
[1:27:58] the experience he got to the experience
[1:28:01] through the word
[1:28:04] and that's what lasts
[1:28:08] because now you're no longer going from
[1:28:11] recipient to recipient to recipient
[1:28:16] or when you see people that just come to
[1:28:18] the altar time and time again
[1:28:20] every time the atmosphere gets to a
[1:28:23] certain place the atmosphere causes
[1:28:27] the movement
[1:28:31] but if it could ever take that
[1:28:33] experience to the word they would never
[1:28:36] have to return there because they
[1:28:39] already possess it
[1:28:41] it's already in them it's on the spot
[1:28:44] they don't have to go up there to get it
[1:28:46] they got it
[1:28:52] what happens when I sin don't say you
[1:28:55] don't sin we've all sinned it come short
[1:28:56] of the glory of God any man who says he
[1:28:59] sinneth not a liar but we have a
[1:29:01] petitionary so when you know that in the
[1:29:03] word right and you make a failure you
[1:29:06] cry Abba Father
[1:29:07] and you confess your sins and he's
[1:29:10] faithful and just to forgive your sins
[1:29:12] you don't have to run to the
[1:29:14] confessional
[1:29:19] Spirits in you
[1:29:21] convicting you of sin you become a
[1:29:24] possessor
[1:29:26] and not a recipient
[1:29:28] is that communion
[1:29:31] that's coming to the church
[1:29:33] where
[1:29:35] flesh the word was made flesh
[1:29:38] now flesh is being made word
[1:29:44] because they have an experience and then
[1:29:47] they take that experience back to the
[1:29:50] scripture they identify it in the word
[1:29:53] they know what scriptures was just
[1:29:55] fulfilled they know what word that just
[1:29:58] came to pass in them now they know that
[1:30:01] them in that word are one father may
[1:30:05] they be one as We Are One
[1:30:10] oh my
[1:30:12] God makes me want to go read John 17 and
[1:30:15] run around the block
[1:30:20] I think I can make it
[1:30:24] because it's word
[1:30:26] it's him he did it you've got you've got
[1:30:30] evidence
[1:30:36] you've got evidence the words the
[1:30:39] evidence
[1:30:41] they can say well I don't see you don't
[1:30:42] I don't see no
[1:30:44] I don't see nothing happen on on you
[1:30:48] right there
[1:30:50] that has come to pass in me
[1:30:53] I've experienced that scripture
[1:30:56] that word has made meat and flesh I am
[1:31:00] now one with that word
[1:31:03] I am
[1:31:04] that word it's happened it's real
[1:31:08] but if you don't take it back hear me if
[1:31:13] I if I've experienced something in the
[1:31:16] 50 years or so that I've been in this
[1:31:18] message
[1:31:21] is that I've seen people come
[1:31:24] in and out up and down run to the altar
[1:31:28] run back try everything in the book
[1:31:31] because they've never found a scripture
[1:31:36] to identify their experience
[1:31:41] I'm not saying do away at the experience
[1:31:45] find it in the word
[1:31:48] can if you can't find it in the word
[1:31:50] then which one's wrong
[1:31:56] then the experience is wrong kids
[1:31:59] nothing wrong with having a bad
[1:32:01] experience if you can filter it out of
[1:32:04] your life
[1:32:05] but if you don't take it to the word you
[1:32:08] take this great bit untrained
[1:32:11] experience remember the beautiful quote
[1:32:14] Matthew read us the lady come up in the
[1:32:16] prayer line
[1:32:18] and he said sister could you be still
[1:32:20] just a minute she's going praise God
[1:32:23] hallelujah God's A Healer I'm so glad to
[1:32:25] be here thank you Jesus and everything
[1:32:27] and he said lady
[1:32:29] could you be still
[1:32:31] I want to contact
[1:32:34] your spirit
[1:32:36] what did he say search the scriptures
[1:32:38] you don't listen to him you don't come
[1:32:40] to me
[1:32:41] that you might have life
[1:32:44] she just kept going on she wouldn't be
[1:32:47] still she kept shouting the Lord so
[1:32:49] brother remember just prayed to her and
[1:32:50] walked away she said you know she
[1:32:52] probably had cancer
[1:32:54] and is dead tonight
[1:32:56] why because she wasn't
[1:32:59] taught right
[1:33:04] she was taught it was the experience
[1:33:06] and the emotion if you would have taken
[1:33:10] it to the word then she would know I
[1:33:13] have the word
[1:33:15] the word is my ticket to the throne
[1:33:22] if you come up to be prayed for
[1:33:25] or you come up for deliverance
[1:33:28] and you don't have a word ticket
[1:33:32] a token you don't have a promise
[1:33:36] to present him that he's obligated to
[1:33:41] and if it was just the emotion of the
[1:33:43] preacher or the Bible story that brought
[1:33:46] you there you'll have an experience but
[1:33:50] it won't hold
[1:33:55] and I want you to be able to hold on to
[1:33:57] these experiences hold on to these
[1:34:00] expressions of Joy hold on to these
[1:34:03] deliverances Hulk to hold on to these
[1:34:06] things I want you to know I've had a
[1:34:08] word experience
[1:34:12] and every time you come to that word
[1:34:15] that experience will boil up in you
[1:34:19] it's a Fountain of Living Water
[1:34:22] it's always there
[1:34:24] because you're not a recipient
[1:34:28] you're a possessor
[1:34:31] you possess it
[1:34:33] it it's yours it's
[1:34:36] it's wonderful
[1:34:39] you have it
[1:34:41] and that's the only thing Satan's trying
[1:34:43] to keep you from
[1:34:47] is you identifying yourself in the
[1:34:49] scripture
[1:34:54] he never wants you to be able to say
[1:34:57] this scripture and me are one
[1:35:03] because once you become a part of any
[1:35:05] Scripture you've got eternal life
[1:35:11] I'm the word
[1:35:14] the word was made flesh now flesh is
[1:35:17] being made word
[1:35:22] if you get blessed in the spirit
[1:35:26] and you would
[1:35:30] be emotional
[1:35:32] praise God
[1:35:34] go back and tie it
[1:35:37] to the scripture
[1:35:39] what scriptural promise
[1:35:43] just came to pass in my life
[1:35:47] because if you don't
[1:35:49] you're traveling in a foreign land
[1:35:52] without ID
[1:35:57] you're just you're going to go from
[1:35:58] Pillar To Post
[1:36:01] anytime the enemy appears as an angel of
[1:36:04] Light
[1:36:05] you're on board
[1:36:09] but our case is not for the things of
[1:36:12] the world
[1:36:12] our taste is for God's word
[1:36:15] God's word gives genuine experience
[1:36:19] if you have an experience
[1:36:22] take it back to the word Peter said
[1:36:24] these men they were they they spoke in
[1:36:27] tongues they were blessed he says should
[1:36:30] we forbid them water
[1:36:32] seeing that they've already had the Holy
[1:36:34] Ghost they took the experience back to
[1:36:37] the word
[1:36:38] made it a fulfill
[1:36:40] word experience now it could never be
[1:36:44] defeated
[1:36:46] do you know where your strength is
[1:36:49] you know how to hold on to your
[1:36:53] experiences
[1:36:55] to your healings
[1:36:57] to your deliverances
[1:36:59] take them back and anchor them in the
[1:37:03] word
[1:37:04] so you know I've got word for this
[1:37:10] so many people
[1:37:13] don't have word
[1:37:16] he even told Peter I mean Timothy study
[1:37:20] the scriptures
[1:37:24] study this scripture
[1:37:26] make full proof of your ministry by
[1:37:29] studying God's word
[1:37:31] find the scripture
[1:37:34] that produced your experience
[1:37:38] and that experience will never leave you
[1:37:43] don't find the scripture you'll keep
[1:37:46] looking for the experience
[1:37:48] because it's elusive it blows it moves
[1:37:52] it comes as it will and it comes as it
[1:37:55] goes
[1:37:56] and so I thought some of you had some
[1:37:59] wonderful experiences this morning
[1:38:03] and I'm happy for that
[1:38:06] but I don't want it to go away I don't
[1:38:08] want you to be back in the dumps again
[1:38:09] in six months
[1:38:14] I don't want every time the pain comes
[1:38:16] in your body you don't think it happened
[1:38:19] the first time
[1:38:23] but God's word is what
[1:38:26] eternal
[1:38:27] it never passes away
[1:38:30] find your experience in the word of God
[1:38:34] how many knows the prophet taught that
[1:38:38] got to line up to the word
[1:38:40] if it don't line up to the word The
[1:38:42] Experience goes not the word
[1:38:45] but when you can get the two of them
[1:38:47] together that's a chord that's not easy
[1:38:51] broken
[1:38:52] and so that's what my heart's desire for
[1:38:57] you is is that when you feel the move of
[1:39:00] the spirit
[1:39:01] you you feel an unctioning of the Holy
[1:39:05] Spirit you feel a quickening or a
[1:39:09] revelation what is the number one thing
[1:39:13] every true bride messenger does
[1:39:16] takes it back to the word the way of a
[1:39:21] true Prophet is he takes everything back
[1:39:24] to the word
[1:39:27] so don't be afraid of the experience
[1:39:31] if you can line it up with the word
[1:39:35] and once you do
[1:39:38] you got it forever
[1:39:41] once you know you're saved you're saved
[1:39:44] I'm sorry
[1:39:46] it ain't my fault I got saved
[1:39:52] it might be a different way you have not
[1:39:55] chosen me I've chosen you
[1:39:59] that you might be fruitful
[1:40:02] and that your fruit right might remain
[1:40:05] and what so everything of your ask of
[1:40:08] the father in my name he'll do it
[1:40:12] that's the maturity
[1:40:14] that we're talking
[1:40:16] so I'm all for
[1:40:18] all the
[1:40:20] of course we're going to build some room
[1:40:22] at the church and then you can do
[1:40:24] cartwheels down the aisle as far but but
[1:40:27] when you get down to the end of that
[1:40:29] aisle I want you to stand in front of me
[1:40:31] and said that was Luke 17 49.
[1:40:36] that's what you just saw
[1:40:39] you just saw Isaiah 3 4. I'm just making
[1:40:42] these up
[1:40:44] you understand you didn't see me you
[1:40:47] didn't see any motion you saw word made
[1:40:51] flesh
[1:40:53] William Branham was word made flesh
[1:40:59] you didn't see a hillbilly Kentucky
[1:41:01] preacher you saw Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30
[1:41:05] Revelations 10 7 you saw scriptural word
[1:41:09] made flesh and because it was word you
[1:41:14] saw the promised results of that word so
[1:41:18] when you see the word you'll get the
[1:41:20] promised results of that word
[1:41:25] if you go dancing around with a
[1:41:27] tambourine you come back up and say I'm
[1:41:29] dancing like Miriam dance down the beach
[1:41:32] Genesis such an exodus
[1:41:38] that'll stop a critical
[1:41:40] path
[1:41:42] who's going to say anything against the
[1:41:44] word of God
[1:41:47] because it's life
[1:41:49] in life eternal
[1:41:52] and oh I tell you that's the one thing
[1:41:55] Satan can't handle
[1:41:58] he can impersonate anything but
[1:42:02] God's
[1:42:04] word
[1:42:06] it's simple
[1:42:07] don't misunderstand me
[1:42:11] because what you have
[1:42:14] he said I gave you fruits that your
[1:42:17] fruit might
[1:42:18] remain
[1:42:22] I want you to have something that sticks
[1:42:24] with you forever
[1:42:27] Paul said I'm speaking in tongues and
[1:42:29] more than you all
[1:42:32] I think it's wonderful
[1:42:35] I think it's all good
[1:42:37] if you've got word for it
[1:42:40] but if it's generated by somebody else's
[1:42:43] experience
[1:42:45] is second hand
[1:42:49] so we want to go past
[1:42:51] the initial preaching is to bring you
[1:42:54] the good news
[1:42:55] now it's your part to take the good news
[1:42:59] identify it and take possession of it so
[1:43:03] you can say I and the word
[1:43:07] are one
[1:43:09] and now we're getting into that
[1:43:12] invisible Union we're getting into that
[1:43:14] Capstone because Jesus says it's been
[1:43:18] freely given
[1:43:20] freely give
[1:43:22] now you can impart that scripture
[1:43:26] now you can impart
[1:43:30] eternal life because you've had that day
[1:43:32] on Calvary
[1:43:34] where the spirit of your sacrifice has
[1:43:37] returned back in you and he's quickened
[1:43:40] to you
[1:43:41] the word that he has just made alive in
[1:43:45] you and now you know that you and the
[1:43:48] word are one
[1:43:51] that's the greatest thing in the world
[1:43:53] Church
[1:43:54] there's there's nothing like it
[1:43:57] search the scripture
[1:44:01] read what the prophet of God said
[1:44:05] find yourself
[1:44:07] in the word find your experience in the
[1:44:11] word and when you do it becomes
[1:44:15] eternal
[1:44:17] and you'll never lose it
[1:44:20] but too many people lose it because they
[1:44:23] haven't tied it down
[1:44:26] you got me
[1:44:28] is it simple
[1:44:30] I want to make it simple and I want you
[1:44:32] to possess every joy that you have ever
[1:44:36] had Satan can steal from you everything
[1:44:39] that's not word
[1:44:42] because it's his
[1:44:45] but what's word is God's
[1:44:48] and ye are God's Little Children fear
[1:44:52] not because it's the father's good
[1:44:54] pleasure to give you
[1:44:56] the kingdom God bless you tonight Lord
[1:45:00] be with you
