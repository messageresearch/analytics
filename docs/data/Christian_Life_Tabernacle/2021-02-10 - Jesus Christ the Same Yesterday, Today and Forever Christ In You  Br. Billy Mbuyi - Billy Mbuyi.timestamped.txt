[23:43] colossians colossians chapter 1
[23:48] let's start from verse 10 it says that
[23:54] that you might walk worthy of the lord
[23:58] unto all praise being fruitful in every
[24:02] good work
[24:03] it says an increasing knowledge of god
[24:06] strengthened with all
[24:08] might according to his righteous power
[24:12] unto all patients and long-suffering
[24:15] with joyfulness
[24:17] giving thanks unto the father which has
[24:20] made us meet to the
[24:23] meet to the partakers of inheritance of
[24:27] the saints in light
[24:28] who had delivered us from the power of
[24:31] darkness
[24:32] and has translated us into the kingdom
[24:34] of his dear son
[24:36] in whom we have redemption through his
[24:38] blood
[24:39] and forgiveness of sins who is the image
[24:42] of the invisible god the first born of
[24:45] every creature
[24:47] by him where all things were all things
[24:51] created
[24:52] that are in heaven that are in earth
[24:56] visible and invisible whether there be
[25:00] that be thrones or dominions or
[25:02] principalities or powers
[25:04] all things were created by him and for
[25:08] him
[25:09] and he is before all things and by him
[25:12] all things consist so he's before all
[25:15] things and by him all things consist
[25:18] and he is the head of the body the
[25:22] church
[25:23] who is the beginning of the with who is
[25:26] the beginning the first moment
[25:28] from the dead that in all things that he
[25:31] might have
[25:32] the preeminence it continues on it says
[25:36] for it please the father that in him
[25:39] should all fullness dwell and
[25:42] having made peace through the blood of
[25:45] his cross
[25:47] by him to reconcile all things unto
[25:50] himself by him
[25:52] i'd say whether whether they be
[25:55] things in uh in earth or things in
[25:58] heaven
[25:59] and you that were sometimes alienated of
[26:02] the
[26:03] and and and enemies in your mind
[26:06] by wicked work yet now
[26:10] had he reconciled in the body of his
[26:13] flesh through death
[26:15] to present you holy and unblemished
[26:18] and unprovable in his sight
[26:21] if ye continue in the faith grounded and
[26:24] settled be not move away from the hope
[26:28] of the gospel which he have heard
[26:32] which was preached to every creature
[26:34] which is under heaven
[26:36] wherefore i paul may i paul made a
[26:39] minister
[26:41] who now rejoiced in my suffering for you
[26:45] and filled up that that which is behind
[26:49] of the affliction of christ in my flesh
[26:52] for his body's sake which is the church
[26:55] wherefore i am made a minister according
[26:58] to the
[26:59] dispensation of god which is given to me
[27:03] for you the fullness of the word
[27:06] the fullness the for the full the to
[27:09] fulfill the
[27:10] the word of god even the mystery which
[27:13] had been
[27:14] heard from ages and
[27:17] from generation but now is made manifest
[27:20] to his sense to whom
[27:24] god would make known what is the richest
[27:28] of his glory of the mystery among the
[27:30] gentiles
[27:31] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[27:35] whom we whom we preach warning every man
[27:38] and teaching every man in all wisdom
[27:41] that we may
[27:42] present every man perfect in jesus
[27:45] christ
[27:46] amen you may have your seats also
[27:50] we will just turn in hebrews
[27:53] 13 and we're going to read from verse
[27:58] 5 it says let your conversation
[28:02] hebrews 13 and verse 5. it says let your
[28:05] conversation
[28:06] be courteous
[28:10] be without let your conversation be
[28:12] without coveredness
[28:14] and be content in such thing as ye
[28:17] have for he has for he has said
[28:21] i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[28:24] so that we may boldly say
[28:27] the lord is my helper and i will not
[28:30] fear what man
[28:31] shall do unto me remember them which
[28:34] have rule over you
[28:36] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[28:39] whose faith follow consider the end of
[28:42] the conversation
[28:43] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[28:46] and forever
[28:48] amen you know
[28:56] i was trying to get out of not preaching
[28:58] the day
[29:00] i told brother david i forgot how to
[29:01] preach
[29:03] and that didn't work
[29:09] and so we'll i hope we'll say something
[29:13] that's of
[29:14] benefit to you this evening
[29:18] i i just want to
[29:23] just to to to read few things and to say
[29:26] a few words
[29:28] about you know just something that uh
[29:31] came to my heart you know and and i hope
[29:33] i could just express it
[29:35] um the way i i have it um
[29:38] i just want to speak about jesus christ
[29:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[29:44] and specifically i want to speak on uh
[29:49] christ in you christ in you
[29:52] and i want to say this christ in you
[29:54] today
[29:56] christ in you today
[29:59] as we read in the scriptures
[30:03] paul was trying to to
[30:06] to speak and let them know that there
[30:08] was a hope that was to come
[30:10] and there was a hope that it was
[30:12] speaking of
[30:13] regarding the gospel basically trying to
[30:16] show them
[30:17] that all of these things that they heard
[30:19] and all these things
[30:21] the gospel that was preaching being
[30:23] preached to them was not in vain
[30:25] that they he had a hope that was
[30:27] attached to it
[30:28] and and and it brings it down to say
[30:30] that the hope of glory was christ in you
[30:33] now when you read this as even as paul
[30:36] has written it i i was so
[30:38] you just look at it he began by just
[30:41] letting them know that we're praying for
[30:43] you
[30:43] and you know we we we are with you and
[30:47] and all those things and
[30:48] but then he began to speak about
[30:52] moving from how that they should stay
[30:54] with the gospel into things and then he
[30:56] began to speak about even the mystery of
[30:58] christ
[30:59] christ he knew being the hope of glory
[31:01] now
[31:02] we can brenham speak so many i preached
[31:04] so many messages about christ
[31:06] jesus christ uh the same yesterday today
[31:09] and forever
[31:10] and he speaks and i could say tonight
[31:13] you know
[31:13] it's wonderful for us to gather here and
[31:16] no doubt if if we open the bible as we
[31:20] begin to speak about david
[31:21] we will all rejoice about the story to
[31:24] see how that
[31:25] god used to man and you know i i
[31:28] don't know if i'll have time to read
[31:30] those quotes
[31:32] i think one of them he was speaking
[31:33] about
[31:35] isaiah he's saying that a man just like
[31:38] you and i
[31:39] he says a man with us up and down ups
[31:42] and downs a man that
[31:43] you know just like us and and no doubt
[31:46] and and he says amen
[31:47] with his up and down and men like just
[31:49] like me um
[31:51] bringing us into the scriptures bringing
[31:54] us into the word of god so we can
[31:56] identify and see ourselves
[31:58] in what he was preaching and and and so
[32:01] and and that becomes very important
[32:03] because like i said we could read about
[32:05] david
[32:06] we could read uh about moses we can read
[32:09] about all of them in fact brother
[32:11] branham says
[32:12] that christ yesterday we could see
[32:15] christ
[32:15] yesterday it was the spirit in the old
[32:18] testament
[32:19] we could see christ in david we can see
[32:21] christ in moses we could see all of that
[32:24] and that's something that we hold dear
[32:26] that's something that helps us
[32:27] that's something that we read and we see
[32:30] god and we see his pattern and
[32:32] everything
[32:33] but i would say this but what he also
[32:35] wanted to let the people in our
[32:37] generation know
[32:38] that that is not sufficient it's not
[32:41] good enough for us to just talk about
[32:43] christ yesterday
[32:44] but we have to identify christ today
[32:48] it's the identification of christ today
[32:51] in in one of the messages
[32:55] i'm sorry i'm just going to be all over
[32:56] the place uh
[32:58] uh i believe it's it's it's about the
[33:01] trip to
[33:01] india he talks about uh a man
[33:05] i believe his name was reid had dr reed
[33:08] had who had met this muslim
[33:10] young man who began to question him and
[33:13] he said that he came and he says you
[33:15] know why don't you believe in christ and
[33:17] why do you believe in jesus christ i
[33:19] said
[33:19] well we believe in muhammad he said well
[33:21] we have a book and
[33:23] you know the bible he speaks about the
[33:25] the export and everything he says well
[33:27] we have the koran
[33:28] and then he begins to speak to him he
[33:30] says well you know
[33:33] he says jesus will do he will save you
[33:35] and he will give you all this and
[33:37] everything i'm just paraphrasing
[33:38] he says well the quran just offers as
[33:41] much joy as the bible does
[33:44] and so he began well you know you will
[33:46] have this he says well
[33:48] we believe that if we die we'll have
[33:50] something too
[33:52] so if it's about things to come
[33:55] everybody can
[33:56] can can dream all they want everybody
[33:59] can can say all they want
[34:01] and if it's about the past we have a
[34:03] record
[34:04] just like you have and so he he
[34:07] he began and and one of the things which
[34:10] as you read it
[34:11] one of the things that you realize that
[34:13] was lacking
[34:14] was the ability to manifest christ today
[34:18] was the ability and brady venom talks
[34:20] about it in one place i believe in the
[34:22] token or some place it says
[34:24] i wish they would have called me or
[34:26] something like that or
[34:27] you know i wish i would have talked to
[34:28] the brother and everything in fact i've
[34:30] already came to see brother branham
[34:32] so he speaks about how that they will
[34:34] you could come
[34:35] the gospel can be preached to where we
[34:37] could talk about history
[34:39] we could talk about what god did and the
[34:41] exploit and the things that he did
[34:43] and we can turn around and begin to talk
[34:45] about the promises
[34:46] all the future promises and everything
[34:49] and that's what christianity in the
[34:51] world
[34:51] has become you look at all it becomes a
[34:55] court of conduct well
[34:57] you know the bible says you shall not
[34:58] steal and you shall not lie you shall
[35:01] not do this and you shall not do this
[35:03] and
[35:03] and people go and they practice those
[35:06] things and they call that christianity
[35:09] when you ask him about christ today it
[35:13] doesn't even cross their minds
[35:15] it's all about well you know this is the
[35:17] bible in order for us to go to heaven
[35:19] we're gonna beat ourselves into
[35:21] obedience we're gonna beat ourselves
[35:23] into
[35:23] submission and do those things and and
[35:26] and try
[35:26] so hard until we can manifest these
[35:29] things and
[35:30] weigh ourselves and see if we've done it
[35:32] all then god will accept us
[35:34] the the understanding and the the coming
[35:37] into the realization
[35:38] that there is such a message as christ
[35:41] today is missing
[35:43] and this is one thing that the message
[35:45] has brought in such
[35:47] power in such a reality for us to know
[35:51] it doesn't do any good to talk about a
[35:53] god of the past
[35:54] it doesn't do any good to to talk about
[35:56] the exploit and everything
[35:58] if those things cannot be done today
[36:02] if those things cannot be touched today
[36:05] they cannot be manifested today they
[36:07] cannot be felt today
[36:09] what good is it if we're going to talk
[36:12] about the future
[36:13] anybody can dream what they want to
[36:15] dream about the future so what we need
[36:17] is a god of yesterday
[36:19] who can manifest what he promised
[36:21] yesterday or what he promised today
[36:23] today
[36:24] and then if i receive what he promised
[36:26] today then i know
[36:27] he's taking me somewhere
[36:31] now i i was thinking you know barbara
[36:34] will oftentimes say
[36:35] you know god said let her be and if
[36:38] there wasn't
[36:40] then god didn't say it or he will say
[36:42] well
[36:43] you know he did this over here if he
[36:45] doesn't do it here then it's not god
[36:47] and often time my mind uh just uh
[36:51] uh drops him to the qualification well
[36:54] if it's not god are we denying god are
[36:57] we saying it's not god
[36:58] no he is trying to bring us to a place
[37:01] for us to come to the realization
[37:03] that the attributes and the
[37:05] characteristics of the god who wrote the
[37:07] bible
[37:09] is such that if he did one thing he's
[37:11] obligated to keep it again
[37:13] [Music]
[37:14] he's obligated to do it again so if
[37:17] those characteristics are not together
[37:19] then it's not the right the right god
[37:21] that we're worshiping
[37:23] if those characteristics cannot be kept
[37:25] if he did it yesterday he's able to do
[37:27] it today
[37:28] if he promised he will do it he's here
[37:30] to fulfill his word
[37:32] if he doesn't fulfill then it's not the
[37:34] god that we're worshiping
[37:37] he says in the message christ jesus
[37:40] christ the same yesterday today and
[37:41] forever he says
[37:43] now he says but christianity after a
[37:46] a worldwide experience christianity is
[37:49] one of the true
[37:50] religion it's the only religion that
[37:53] that could show an empty grave it's the
[37:56] only one
[37:57] that the founder any man
[38:01] or no man like him ever stood on earth
[38:04] and said
[38:05] i have power to lay down my life and
[38:07] take it again
[38:08] and a little while the word see me no
[38:10] more and yet ye shall see me
[38:12] the unbeliever won't see me no more but
[38:15] yet ye shall see me for i am i
[38:18] am i personal pronoun i'll be with you
[38:21] even in you
[38:22] to the end of the consummation jesus
[38:25] christ the same
[38:26] yesterday today and and forever
[38:29] so now he's talking about this reality
[38:32] of god
[38:34] that continued to manifest itself every
[38:37] time
[38:38] this the reality of this god who who
[38:41] stood up there and said i have the power
[38:43] to lay down my life and take it up again
[38:45] and not just that but he says
[38:47] i've made the promise that i'll be with
[38:49] you even in you
[38:50] until the end so he says now we can come
[38:54] we can come to the thought it says now
[38:57] if if he is the same he is not dead
[39:01] he is risen from the dead he promised
[39:04] andy
[39:04] and his believers would see him all
[39:07] down to the end so this god
[39:11] is promised to be made manifest or to be
[39:14] seen
[39:15] every time his believing children are on
[39:18] the scene
[39:19] every in every age he's made available
[39:22] his presence so that his believing
[39:24] children will know him
[39:26] so they can see him so they can hear him
[39:29] and then he says
[39:31] plump to the confirmation and they that
[39:33] would see him
[39:34] he says now if he is the same yesterday
[39:37] today and forever
[39:38] many men have have talked many men
[39:42] have talked to i've talked to says well
[39:45] uh in one way he is the same the bible
[39:48] didn't
[39:49] didn't say that in a way he said he is
[39:51] the same
[39:53] and if we hunger to see him
[39:56] he says with the same enthusiasm that
[39:59] the greek did
[40:02] they had heard of him they came
[40:05] and they got to see him through the
[40:08] courtesy of one of his disciples
[40:10] he says well he says can't we do the
[40:13] same
[40:14] if he is the same yesterday today and
[40:16] forever so
[40:17] if we have gathered here tonight with
[40:20] the same
[40:21] enthusiasm with the same desire with the
[40:24] same expectation
[40:25] but he's asking can't we not see him and
[40:28] i want to say him we can see him
[40:30] [Music]
[40:32] now let me just say this this revealing
[40:34] of the son of man that we have seen in
[40:36] the end time
[40:38] is nothing like anything before
[40:41] i mean jesus christ came and and and and
[40:43] he came
[40:44] we could as i let me just profess that
[40:47] we it's the same thing that we've seen
[40:49] in the time of jesus
[40:51] why a man can stood there we can read
[40:53] the bible and recall
[40:55] when jesus was on the boat and he
[40:57] stopped the winds or when he did
[40:58] the scripture says they looked at him
[41:00] and says what manner of
[41:02] men is this that even the wings and the
[41:04] wave will obey him
[41:06] that's the same ministry that we've seen
[41:08] manifested here
[41:10] it was the ministry to manifest the son
[41:12] of man
[41:13] something that will catch the attraction
[41:16] of everybody
[41:19] in such a way that everybody came
[41:22] everybody and i'm talking not just
[41:24] believers the unbeliever followed
[41:26] everybody came why because it was such a
[41:29] power
[41:30] such a an eye-opener such a display of
[41:34] the reality of god
[41:36] that a man will stand there and speak
[41:38] about things that nobody has seen
[41:42] and and it wasn't done so we could just
[41:45] gather here and say
[41:46] well we have received a great ministry
[41:48] in all of those things now it was done
[41:50] so we may know
[41:51] under what god are we serving that same
[41:54] god is here tonight doing the same thing
[41:58] it was done so we may know what gospel
[42:01] we have received
[42:02] we didn't receive this is not the men's
[42:04] intellectual
[42:05] or the understanding of the explanation
[42:07] of what the bible is and it's not
[42:09] this is jesus christ manifesting
[42:12] according to the promises that he made
[42:14] in the bible
[42:15] that the gentile will receive and see
[42:18] the same manifestation that the jew was
[42:20] seen
[42:22] that's why when he stood there when he
[42:24] began to call there is nothing that
[42:26] could stand before him
[42:29] because this is not a man just trying to
[42:31] you know i can stand here
[42:32] and say okay you can come i'll pray for
[42:34] you and i'll see if god can heal you
[42:37] and if you have faith you will receive
[42:39] it you know and you can
[42:40] pray or one after another and so forth
[42:43] but this is not
[42:44] so this is god standing there
[42:47] presenting something that will catch
[42:49] every man's eye
[42:52] so he says it says now
[42:55] we can talk about the resurrection we
[42:58] can speak of it
[42:59] but if it it but but if it isn't a
[43:02] reality
[43:03] then it just becomes a mere myth it says
[43:07] it's a story
[43:08] but if it's proven that it's the truth
[43:11] then it says then we are among the
[43:13] people
[43:13] the most happy what we're desiring is
[43:16] not
[43:16] a a story or a myth or something
[43:20] it's that reality of a god who can come
[43:23] and manifest this word to us tonight
[43:27] he speaks again in the message
[43:32] the word the word become flesh
[43:36] he speaks it says and i said now
[43:39] i said
[43:53] he says
[43:57] he says so i need an absolute so i took
[44:01] i'm sorry this is in the message the
[44:02] absolute
[44:04] and then i'll drop on to the other one
[44:06] it says so
[44:07] i need an absolute so i took one i took
[44:11] i took one god's word so i read
[44:15] in the word and he says and he has said
[44:18] in in john chapter and saint john
[44:20] chapter one it says
[44:21] upon this absolute i'll build my church
[44:24] that's right
[44:25] so i took him and i took him at his word
[44:28] revelation 22 and said
[44:30] whatsoever shall take one word out of
[44:33] this
[44:34] or add one word to it add one word to it
[44:38] to to that to that add one word
[44:41] to that's the absolute that's the end of
[44:45] all strife
[44:47] it says this is the absolute whatsoever
[44:51] whatsoever takes anything from it
[44:54] or adds anything to it god said i'll
[44:56] take
[44:57] his part out of the book
[45:00] so that has to that so that had to be
[45:03] the absolute
[45:04] and jesus said that men shall not live
[45:07] by bread alone but by every word
[45:10] then i knowed i know this every word
[45:14] as he said precept upon
[45:18] precept line upon line that's the way it
[45:20] had become
[45:21] just as it's written then he said if you
[45:24] abide in me
[45:28] he is the word my words abide in you
[45:32] you can ask what you will i know then
[45:35] if christianity it says i
[45:38] know then if christianity was the word
[45:41] of god
[45:43] he was the word
[45:46] and by accepting the word the word lived
[45:50] through
[45:50] him and then i know if i abide in him
[45:55] and my if i have if i abide in if i
[45:59] abide in me
[46:00] if he abide in me and my word in you
[46:03] ask what you will and if you are the
[46:06] word
[46:07] if you are if you are in the word
[46:10] and part of the word you will only ask
[46:13] what the word tells you to ask it says
[46:17] no it says no that's the that's
[46:20] not the day you are living in then ask
[46:23] accordingly
[46:24] and then it says so therefore back to
[46:27] the subject it says talking about
[46:29] talking now this personality but i'll
[46:33] uh but i'm tired it says i'm
[46:36] tied to jesus christ to him by his word
[46:40] he is my absolute i found that
[46:43] all these denomination things had the
[46:46] absolute
[46:47] and each one each one they had their own
[46:50] absolute
[46:51] teaching the code of conduct
[46:56] so so here he is again saying it was no
[46:59] longer
[47:00] about god abiding into the people
[47:03] causing them to live a certain life or
[47:05] doing certain things
[47:07] it became all it became is okay we'll
[47:10] take the bible
[47:11] we'll read it says in corinthians that
[47:14] women shall not cut their hairs men
[47:16] shall not do this
[47:17] and they do this and then you know they
[47:19] figure out a way to obey those things
[47:21] and they go home and they call that
[47:22] christianity and
[47:24] and and he began day in and day out and
[47:26] men will try
[47:27] always approaching god from the
[47:29] standpoint that we are sinners
[47:31] and we're trying to get to the kingdom
[47:33] of god and the better we do the better
[47:34] god will accept us
[47:36] forgetting that there was a promise that
[47:38] god was to send of his own spirit
[47:41] in fact the promise when i say jesus
[47:43] christ today
[47:44] i want to say this you are jesus christ
[47:47] today
[47:49] jesus christ today is the revealing of
[47:51] god in his own body
[47:53] a group of people that have received the
[47:55] spirit of christ
[47:57] and they're manifesting the works of
[47:58] christ why because it's christ
[48:01] living through them and he cannot fail
[48:03] because he didn't fail when he was in
[48:05] jesus christ
[48:06] because it was the word that was spoken
[48:08] from the beginning
[48:09] and that same word is doing the same
[48:11] things in the myth
[48:15] so he says the code of conduct good
[48:17] behavior
[48:18] it says how how to do good how to be a
[48:21] good
[48:22] person a good so it becomes those things
[48:24] how they become
[48:26] how they can do good and how they can
[48:28] it's not we are not interested and i
[48:30] want to say this
[48:31] if you are a christian you will become a
[48:32] good citizen
[48:36] if you are a christian you will have
[48:37] good morals you have all of those things
[48:40] but it's not us following after those
[48:42] things it's the life that i have
[48:44] received that produces those things
[48:47] because man has taken this as said here
[48:50] it says they came and they took out the
[48:53] whole christianity
[48:54] has become uh uh uh uh almost to a place
[48:58] where
[48:59] you know they've forgotten the abiding
[49:01] of christ
[49:02] into his people which will produce the
[49:05] very things that they're looking for
[49:08] so he says in the message the word
[49:12] becomes first it says now
[49:15] now as i said as elijah the prophet
[49:18] brought
[49:20] all the prophets of baal and so forth to
[49:23] the mount carmel
[49:26] to prove and say that god
[49:29] uh who is god and said
[49:32] he says now there's only one thing that
[49:34] can that
[49:35] there's only one thing to do and then
[49:38] and then if your gospel is right then
[49:42] then uh if your gospel is right
[49:46] then let me leave mine and serve you
[49:49] and serve yours now here stand the death
[49:53] and dumb boy
[49:54] i love this yes then the death and dumb
[49:57] boy
[49:58] it says which one of your gods can make
[50:01] him whole
[50:04] the paul said i didn't come with the
[50:05] enticing words
[50:07] i oh i wonder how many people came and
[50:10] perhaps those that preached before him
[50:12] how the demonstration and all kinds of
[50:14] things they did
[50:16] and how they came in the great orators
[50:18] and
[50:19] they will come and how some will come
[50:21] even like the prophet of el
[50:23] great sacrifices that men were making
[50:26] but here he is a simple gospel
[50:29] he says well you know we have a deaf and
[50:31] dumb here
[50:32] which one of your gods will make him
[50:34] whole he says if you do
[50:36] i'll serve your god
[50:40] and that's why it's so important that
[50:43] the christ that projected out of us
[50:45] the christ that's been projected out of
[50:47] us is the life of christ that's showing
[50:50] to people
[50:51] this is my god this is what i'm having
[50:54] to present
[50:55] and you show me your god and oftentimes
[50:58] you have
[50:58] you don't even have to say a word and
[51:00] often
[51:01] they fall under conviction you know i
[51:03] remember you know i was at work one day
[51:05] and
[51:06] and you know i was trying to get
[51:08] something to eat and this young man i
[51:09] was working with
[51:11] he said oh you know let's get in my car
[51:12] and everything and we got in the car and
[51:15] my goodness music was just blasting out
[51:17] and
[51:18] and i was trying to even tell him to
[51:20] just lower it down and
[51:21] and so you know i and and so he said
[51:24] you know when we got in the car it says
[51:26] i said you know
[51:27] can you i said i'm a christian he said
[51:29] yeah i'm a christian too and everything
[51:31] he asked me what kind of music he
[51:32] listened i said
[51:33] i only listened to christian music and
[51:35] that was the end of it and the thing
[51:37] came down
[51:38] i didn't even have to say much why
[51:40] because
[51:42] oftentimes we think well you know i
[51:44] gotta go and say this and preach this
[51:46] and
[51:47] and do this and present to him the the
[51:49] mysteries and do this no
[51:52] your very life because remember it's not
[51:55] you
[51:56] the the very life is the life of christ
[52:01] the very attribute is the attribute of
[52:03] christ
[52:04] again the same things that he did in
[52:07] christ
[52:08] he healed the sacred it called the
[52:10] afflicted and
[52:11] and he called the sinners and everything
[52:13] that same life is doing the same thing
[52:15] in you
[52:16] there's not even much words that needs
[52:18] to be said the very life when it's
[52:20] presented
[52:22] will cause the same effect why because
[52:24] it's the same god
[52:27] so it says which one of your god it says
[52:32] let me send you a damn boy which one of
[52:34] your gods can make him whole
[52:36] and give him and and and and and give
[52:39] him
[52:40] give him his hearing and his speech he
[52:42] says
[52:43] that's what i want to see that's what i
[52:45] want to know see
[52:47] it says which one of which one can
[52:49] restore the speech of this boy
[52:51] and everybody was silent
[52:55] you know often time we we we we get
[52:58] engaged
[52:59] into things that we probably shouldn't
[53:01] be in and in the debate of the
[53:04] scriptures and the things
[53:05] all where we need to do is just present
[53:07] christ
[53:08] and what he was send us to do and he
[53:11] said
[53:12] and i said now christianity had been
[53:15] represented to you
[53:17] in the form of doctrine and in
[53:20] pamphlet and in the bible which
[53:23] which i am for it it says 100
[53:27] but god helps those missionaries
[53:30] to go there and to live god help those
[53:33] missionaries to go there and to live
[53:35] there
[53:36] yes sir but i said it's not
[53:39] fully being represented to you you see
[53:43] it's been represented to you in words
[53:46] only in word only but god
[53:51] that wrote that wrote that word that god
[53:54] already
[53:55] that that you you've got already
[53:58] got places in your heart and now come to
[54:01] a place
[54:02] till he's going to make the world live
[54:06] see make himself make himself
[54:10] in the word he says now i said
[54:14] he stands here stands a lead the death
[54:17] and dumb
[54:18] he can't speak or hear or nothing he's
[54:21] been born
[54:22] that way and the holy ghost is the holy
[54:25] spirit is here
[54:28] and revealed the sins and the things and
[54:31] and the people
[54:32] and just almost fainted when he's when
[54:35] he said
[54:36] when when they said that you know and
[54:39] all of them
[54:40] make so much noise you can't understand
[54:42] because
[54:43] it's cause they just they just had this
[54:46] militia to watch them
[54:48] you know and and and and it was just
[54:51] up and down and my they said people from
[54:54] all over india was there so you don't
[54:57] you
[54:58] he says you couldn't tell what uh uh
[55:00] what was there
[55:02] you see how many or or
[55:05] it says how many or nothing you can't
[55:08] understand
[55:08] it says so then uh this little boy
[55:12] when i brought him up there so here he
[55:15] is
[55:15] it wasn't so much about you know oh
[55:18] let's
[55:19] go to this book and let's do this
[55:21] ceremony it was about
[55:22] god the holy spirit coming down to
[55:25] reveal his word
[55:26] and bringing people into the fault to
[55:29] catching the attention of the people
[55:31] and showing them what god had offered
[55:33] and presented for that time
[55:38] but when i'm says in the message deity
[55:40] of jesus christ
[55:42] he says and brothers and sisters that
[55:45] deity
[55:45] is in you he says
[55:49] a little while the world see me no more
[55:51] but yet you shall see me
[55:54] for i am with you it says even you
[55:57] even in you to the end of the age
[56:00] christ in the manger it says christ in a
[56:04] manger
[56:05] no christ in you hallelujah
[56:08] we are not worshipping christ in the
[56:10] manger
[56:11] but christ in you the holy ghost
[56:15] we and and i talked about even the
[56:17] expression tonight
[56:19] it's easier for us to be gathered and
[56:21] when we worship it says
[56:22] you know god who's in heaven and worship
[56:25] him and god and
[56:26] and and create some type of imagination
[56:29] of the location where god is and
[56:31] everything
[56:32] but the prophet is here telling us it's
[56:34] christ who's in you
[56:36] making sure you know the location of
[56:38] where god is
[56:40] you didn't come here by your own self
[56:42] you didn't save yourself
[56:43] everything about you it's not by
[56:45] yourself it's him that brought you here
[56:47] so when you worship him you look at the
[56:50] god who's taken you out of sin
[56:52] and who's done this great work to bring
[56:54] you here that's the god you worship
[56:57] because when the enemy becomes a living
[56:59] god then he becomes a god
[57:01] that you know that you've seen his works
[57:03] and everything
[57:05] he says the holy ghost it says the hope
[57:09] of
[57:09] the hope of life hallelujah the creator
[57:13] god himself dwelling in human being it
[57:16] does not yet
[57:17] appear what we shall be but will shall
[57:20] but we'll see him as he as he is
[57:24] as he is for
[57:27] will be made like him it says
[57:30] no room for him
[57:33] it says people around here say
[57:37] they are they are christ the churches of
[57:40] christ
[57:42] they go to and what happens last night
[57:46] open up the christianity the christmas
[57:49] present
[57:50] let's see about daddy here
[57:53] there it says what was on the christian
[57:55] what was the christmas tree
[57:57] of many of many men last night
[58:01] set a box of beer somewhere in the room
[58:04] it's
[58:05] set the box of worm of beer it says no
[58:07] room for jesus
[58:08] all for beer open up mom's mama's
[58:12] present
[58:13] a deck of cards cards it says no room
[58:17] for jesus no no room for jesus
[58:20] the cards that's right
[58:23] instead of a little bible or something
[58:28] or something to to the children it's a
[58:31] little g-man book
[58:33] a little something like that no room for
[58:35] jesus
[58:36] instead of going to church they go to
[58:39] the shows
[58:40] dances everything and call themselves
[58:43] christians
[58:46] that's not the life christianity is not
[58:50] a confession of the mouth
[58:51] without the life christianity is just
[58:55] not a man standing there and claiming
[58:57] that i'm a christian and i've been
[58:58] saving all of this and this
[59:00] and here he is the the very in other
[59:03] words
[59:03] as we said you don't even have to open
[59:05] your mouth look your life your very life
[59:08] speaks about it all
[59:11] it says my brother when deity of god
[59:14] by the holy ghost come into a human
[59:17] heart
[59:18] it cults out everything that christ
[59:20] hasn't created
[59:22] you are you know that's the truth
[59:25] and that's the kind of gospel we want we
[59:28] want something not just
[59:29] the refraining of doing something or
[59:32] going there
[59:32] because remember the idea is not for you
[59:35] to
[59:36] come to a place where you stop drinking
[59:38] you stop smoking or
[59:40] that's like even as brother branham is
[59:42] listed no the idea is that spirit comes
[59:45] upon you
[59:46] it uproots everything of the world out
[59:48] of you
[59:49] it puts you into work for jesus christ
[59:54] amen you know because that that's why
[59:58] i i even made that segment it's not the
[1:00:00] satisfaction that you know i don't feel
[1:00:02] like drinking beer or going to a bar or
[1:00:05] going to a club and everything
[1:00:06] that's not my satisfaction my
[1:00:08] satisfaction is christ
[1:00:10] today revealing this flesh my
[1:00:13] satisfaction
[1:00:14] is christ walking on this earth doing
[1:00:16] the same thing that he did when he was
[1:00:18] here today 2000 years ago
[1:00:21] and i will say this the manifestation of
[1:00:23] christ
[1:00:24] and the characteristics of christ has
[1:00:26] been manifested
[1:00:27] in this bride in this end time according
[1:00:30] to the bible
[1:00:31] why because christ the mystery of god
[1:00:33] revealed it was christ the bride
[1:00:36] revealed in his own flesh
[1:00:46] he says oh
[1:00:52] christ the hope of glory in you
[1:00:55] not in the cradle in you
[1:01:00] that was one time god was back in the
[1:01:02] beginning
[1:01:04] then he came into moses he came into the
[1:01:08] children of israel
[1:01:09] in coming two he came into the cradle
[1:01:12] but now we are worshiping him
[1:01:16] we are worshipping him way back
[1:01:20] like some but now we are worshiping him
[1:01:23] way back like some priests
[1:01:26] pre prehistorical something when christ
[1:01:29] is in you the the the worshipping him is
[1:01:34] something of the past
[1:01:35] oh we we thank you god because you gave
[1:01:38] your life for us you died on calvary
[1:01:41] and and as you as they're praying they
[1:01:43] they the envisioning the robe and the
[1:01:45] man with the robe and going on to the
[1:01:47] cross
[1:01:48] we thank you for the blessings and your
[1:01:50] promises never
[1:01:52] uh coming to a place where we can make
[1:01:55] any contact between what happened to
[1:01:57] calvary
[1:01:58] and you today never coming to a place
[1:02:01] where there's
[1:02:02] you can connect it to and say what did
[1:02:04] what i'm experiencing
[1:02:06] today is the product of what happened at
[1:02:08] calvary
[1:02:09] what's happening in my flesh how i've
[1:02:11] been saving all those things
[1:02:12] is a product of what he did why because
[1:02:15] i can testify a calvary because i'm a
[1:02:18] living proof
[1:02:21] not because somebody told me the story
[1:02:24] not just because it's written in the
[1:02:25] bible
[1:02:26] but i'm a living proof because i've seen
[1:02:28] my life and i know
[1:02:30] that calvary is real because i'm the
[1:02:32] result of what calvary produced
[1:02:41] he says
[1:02:45] he says in the message
[1:02:49] israel and the church his picture says
[1:02:54] well i said i said then do you believe
[1:02:58] he says do you believe that you can
[1:03:00] drink
[1:03:01] i said no i never said that
[1:03:05] it says a grain a grain of wheat can
[1:03:09] only produce
[1:03:10] wheat it cannot produce cocker bird
[1:03:13] it says there's no desire in it there's
[1:03:16] no
[1:03:17] life in it to do it to produce the
[1:03:19] cocker bird within it
[1:03:22] to produce the cocker bird with and if
[1:03:25] we are
[1:03:26] we in jesus christ he continues on and
[1:03:29] says
[1:03:29] paragraph 63 says don't be deceived
[1:03:34] you had better search this close now
[1:03:38] see if you keep saying
[1:03:41] don't condemn me to do this or don't
[1:03:44] condemn me to do that
[1:03:46] things of the world it says now i'm
[1:03:48] going to hurt
[1:03:50] just a little bit pull the feathers back
[1:03:53] the other way it says but
[1:03:58] it's this it's this one one sure
[1:04:00] evidence that you've never been
[1:04:02] to christ you've never been
[1:04:05] born again he that loved the world and
[1:04:08] the things of the world
[1:04:10] the love of god is not in him now
[1:04:13] if you just quit the things if you just
[1:04:17] quit
[1:04:17] doing it because you know you ought to
[1:04:20] do it
[1:04:21] and quit doing it it says that's the
[1:04:24] sign that you haven't got
[1:04:25] nowhere yet it says
[1:04:29] when that thing becomes dead in you
[1:04:32] the nature of it is gone away
[1:04:36] there's another person in there
[1:04:39] in that only there's only person in
[1:04:42] there
[1:04:42] and and it can only produce
[1:04:45] the holy spirit that was in christ
[1:04:49] in you
[1:04:52] it says produces the christ like nature
[1:04:56] nothing you do what he did
[1:04:59] he chose he chose that he chose that
[1:05:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:08] and he drops in in paragraph 66 he said
[1:05:12] he says someone said well
[1:05:16] i know i got saved because i quit
[1:05:18] smoking
[1:05:19] that wasn't why you got saved that
[1:05:22] wasn't why you got saved
[1:05:24] you got saved because god chose
[1:05:27] you before the foundation of the world
[1:05:31] to save you
[1:05:35] god chose you before the foundation of
[1:05:37] the world
[1:05:38] to save you that's the scripture
[1:05:41] teaching amen
[1:05:42] now you see being found out it's not
[1:05:46] us it's him he chose us
[1:05:50] abraham couldn't sell well bless god i
[1:05:53] come down from the tower of babel
[1:05:55] hallelujah that's why i got saved he's
[1:05:58] got
[1:05:59] he says he'll have saved the whole bunch
[1:06:02] of
[1:06:02] he would have saved a whole bunch then
[1:06:04] if that's the reason why
[1:06:06] if that's the reason they'd done it he
[1:06:08] didn't do
[1:06:09] he didn't do that it's in his program
[1:06:14] and and i i just want to say this
[1:06:17] i think there's a beauty for us to look
[1:06:20] at the word of god
[1:06:22] and begin to realize that there is a
[1:06:24] manifestation of christ
[1:06:28] for within our flesh that is promised
[1:06:31] for us to do in this end time
[1:06:33] there's a manifestation or there's a
[1:06:35] promise in the bible
[1:06:36] the uh pouring but random says you know
[1:06:39] i believe it's in the message
[1:06:42] the mighty god revealed before us it
[1:06:44] says it's not so much that
[1:06:46] god emptied himself out but it was that
[1:06:48] he changed his form
[1:06:50] from one to another the same god to do
[1:06:53] the same thing
[1:06:54] that he promised he would do and i
[1:06:56] believe if we can if we begin to focus
[1:06:59] on that tonight
[1:07:00] coming to the realization that we are
[1:07:02] being placed here
[1:07:03] for the manifestation of christ within
[1:07:05] our flesh
[1:07:07] like i said i was moved by the testimony
[1:07:09] of cosmonaut and
[1:07:11] and and brother uh brother joseph so
[1:07:13] much that
[1:07:14] you know it was something that moved
[1:07:17] within them
[1:07:18] the word was spoken god spoke to their
[1:07:21] heart and they move upon that same
[1:07:23] action
[1:07:25] and and pravanam says oftentimes he says
[1:07:28] he even spoke about elijah and all of
[1:07:30] them he said
[1:07:32] isaiah and all of them he says it was by
[1:07:35] them
[1:07:35] yielding to the word of god he says
[1:07:38] isaiah spoke things that would make
[1:07:40] sense
[1:07:41] he said things that would make sense but
[1:07:43] yet he said it
[1:07:44] because why it was yielded to the word
[1:07:47] of god things that didn't make sense to
[1:07:48] the head
[1:07:49] he spoke it anyhow why because it was
[1:07:51] the spirit of god that moved upon him
[1:07:54] so that's why it becomes so important
[1:07:57] that we are the people
[1:07:58] that are sensitive and can be moved by
[1:08:01] the spirit of god
[1:08:04] otherwise all we become is a bunch of
[1:08:06] learners
[1:08:07] you know the scripture says this and
[1:08:09] this and that's exactly what i'm going
[1:08:11] to do and not being moved by the spirit
[1:08:13] at all
[1:08:14] you know when the spirit comes it brings
[1:08:16] the interpretation of the scripture
[1:08:19] that's why the prophet can come in this
[1:08:21] hand it says by god's grace we have
[1:08:23] received the interpretation of the
[1:08:25] scripture
[1:08:25] of the bible what was the interpretation
[1:08:28] you know he speaks about the
[1:08:29] the old pharisees how they will come and
[1:08:32] read the scroll and follow into the
[1:08:34] action
[1:08:35] and yes this young man and and i seem to
[1:08:38] be messing up
[1:08:38] everything but when i'm asked a question
[1:08:41] it says
[1:08:42] what was the vindication the works was
[1:08:45] not a vindication
[1:08:47] because they had more works than jesus
[1:08:49] did the vindication was
[1:08:52] jesus was doing it according to the
[1:08:54] promise of that hour
[1:08:57] jesus was doing it based upon what the
[1:08:59] spirit moved upon him
[1:09:01] to do what the word of that hour was
[1:09:04] written about him
[1:09:05] or if we could be a people that could
[1:09:07] come into this place
[1:09:09] let the spirit move upon us and
[1:09:11] interpret the scripture for us
[1:09:13] to walk in it
[1:09:21] he says
[1:09:35] question and answer he says i thought
[1:09:36] this was
[1:09:39] wonderful it says a french scientist
[1:09:42] said
[1:09:45] less than less than three three hundred
[1:09:48] years ago
[1:09:49] if a man would ever if a man
[1:09:52] would ever make the terrific speed of 30
[1:09:56] miles an hour
[1:09:58] gravitation will take him from the earth
[1:10:01] now this is a scientist
[1:10:04] right it's got the title of scientists
[1:10:07] and nobody talks about him
[1:10:11] he says 30 miles an hour well
[1:10:16] do you think that scientists would refer
[1:10:18] back to to him today
[1:10:19] would refer to to that today far be it
[1:10:24] no sir it says they got growing about
[1:10:28] nine nine to ten hundred ten hundred
[1:10:31] miles an hour
[1:10:32] yet or something in the rocket
[1:10:35] it says then sixteen hundred it says
[1:10:38] sixteen hundred miles an hour still
[1:10:40] taking him out uh
[1:10:42] it's still still taking him forward
[1:10:46] scientist has taken a man
[1:10:49] more forward greater things
[1:10:53] with his mind than what
[1:10:57] it says then what and what's the only
[1:11:00] thing that is
[1:11:02] the tree of knowledge father and the
[1:11:04] ministers
[1:11:06] taking him with a spirit which is
[1:11:09] unlimited
[1:11:11] but here is what it is science
[1:11:14] is not science and looking back to what
[1:11:17] science said a few years ago
[1:11:20] science is taking what they've got now
[1:11:23] and moving forward for something new
[1:11:26] something else it says but we asked the
[1:11:29] preacher well
[1:11:31] but we asked the preacher whoever says
[1:11:33] well we'll see what moody said
[1:11:35] about it we'll see what wesley said
[1:11:37] about him
[1:11:38] it says i don't care what they said
[1:11:40] about it
[1:11:41] i know what god said about it now
[1:11:47] i know what god said about it now now i
[1:11:50] want to say this
[1:11:52] that's why it becomes that's why the
[1:11:53] word of god is not dead manner
[1:11:55] it's not old manner that we continue to
[1:11:58] eat the same way and we continue to eat
[1:12:01] it's a revealing of the word of god it's
[1:12:04] god coming and taking something
[1:12:06] anew taking something that was written
[1:12:09] and being bringing the interpretation
[1:12:12] back to us
[1:12:12] so we may know what the need is today
[1:12:15] it's god taking his word
[1:12:17] and bringing the interpretation of it
[1:12:19] today
[1:12:21] you know it's saying here they're not
[1:12:23] looking back and
[1:12:24] always in in the equation every time
[1:12:27] they work out an equation about how to
[1:12:29] do something and said
[1:12:30] well keep in mind we said that you know
[1:12:32] we couldn't go 30 miles an hour
[1:12:33] no they forsaken that they've taken that
[1:12:36] aside and everything
[1:12:37] that's why even the prophet comes and
[1:12:39] tells us in this time
[1:12:40] that we couldn't go back and take noah's
[1:12:43] message and apply today
[1:12:45] is it the word of god absolutely we
[1:12:48] couldn't take uh
[1:12:50] wesley message and apply it today no is
[1:12:52] it the word of god yes
[1:12:54] but we've come into a place where god
[1:12:57] has sent us a prophet and is interpreted
[1:13:00] as the word for our time
[1:13:02] is interpreted as the word for our hour
[1:13:05] he's shown us in the map
[1:13:07] where we are and what we need to be
[1:13:09] doing and that word by eating it
[1:13:11] is translating us into the forward
[1:13:14] looking
[1:13:15] of what god wants us to fulfill
[1:13:20] we could sit here and talk it's uh it's
[1:13:22] jesus today
[1:13:23] i'm interested in jesus today i'm
[1:13:26] interested in seeing jesus
[1:13:28] talk to me i'm interested in touching
[1:13:30] the hands of jesus this
[1:13:32] tonight i'm interested in conversating
[1:13:34] with jesus
[1:13:35] i'm interested in moving forward with
[1:13:37] jesus
[1:13:41] if the musician could come
[1:13:48] i was thinking about the story
[1:13:52] that porter ranum says this woman that
[1:13:55] he went to the hospital and he was to
[1:13:57] pray
[1:13:58] to the with the woman that was
[1:14:01] just right next to it there was a
[1:14:03] curtain that was separating them and it
[1:14:05] was open it says
[1:14:07] you know let's bow our head and pray and
[1:14:09] that's how the woman
[1:14:11] screamed now they said shut down that
[1:14:13] curtain
[1:14:16] it says yesterday i said aren't you a
[1:14:18] christian it says
[1:14:19] i'm a methodist shut down that curtain
[1:14:28] and if we're not careful that's what
[1:14:30] people become
[1:14:32] i'm a message believer i'm this and this
[1:14:34] you give yourself a bunch of titles
[1:14:37] it's not about titles it's jesus christ
[1:14:40] i want to see him but when it speaks
[1:14:42] about
[1:14:43] so we would see jesus it says in order
[1:14:46] for them to see
[1:14:47] it they had to go into the manifestation
[1:14:50] of that hour the veil of god for that
[1:14:53] moment
[1:14:54] what was he into it was in the veil
[1:14:56] called jesus christ
[1:14:58] and when he manifested himself those
[1:15:00] that desire to see him
[1:15:02] saw him within the veil but the critic
[1:15:05] though
[1:15:06] that went well you know we got the words
[1:15:08] of moses and
[1:15:09] you know we're not going to move away
[1:15:10] from the word they fail to see
[1:15:12] god that same creator manifested into a
[1:15:15] flesh
[1:15:16] all but those that came with the fervent
[1:15:18] heart and those that came with
[1:15:20] expectation and the desire they were
[1:15:22] able to look past the flesh and see
[1:15:24] god manifested himself and it's not
[1:15:26] different from this end time
[1:15:28] people can look and say jesus i mean you
[1:15:31] know when they think about jesus they
[1:15:32] think about this great creature
[1:15:34] they forget to see that in this end time
[1:15:36] the manifestation
[1:15:38] is jesus in the body
[1:15:42] in a people that don't look like much
[1:15:45] in just the regular people
[1:15:48] in just the people walking and going to
[1:15:50] the same jobs that they're going
[1:15:52] eating at the same restaurants that
[1:15:54] they're eating
[1:15:56] oh if they can only take that
[1:15:57] opportunity to realize
[1:15:59] you know if all the people in the bible
[1:16:02] that things happen too
[1:16:03] mary wasn't doing anything special she
[1:16:06] was just walking and doing
[1:16:08] a regular thing when the angel came to
[1:16:10] her you know abraham didn't come out
[1:16:12] and pray for god to hear him and no he
[1:16:15] was just doing what he did every day
[1:16:17] and god came into that path that's how
[1:16:19] god comes
[1:16:20] and with us it's no different it's you
[1:16:23] just doing the things that you do every
[1:16:24] day
[1:16:25] taking care of your family going to work
[1:16:27] and doing all those things
[1:16:29] god is being manifested in those things
[1:16:31] god has been manifested to those at work
[1:16:34] god has been manifested in your family
[1:16:36] god is manifesting in the people that
[1:16:38] you're coming in contact with
[1:16:40] the only thing is we have to be
[1:16:41] surrendered and aware
[1:16:43] of what it is
[1:16:50] in the message of paradox it says jesus
[1:16:53] said a little while the world will
[1:16:54] won't see me no more but ye but yet you
[1:16:57] shall see me for
[1:16:59] i'll be with you even in you john 14 and
[1:17:02] 12 he said
[1:17:03] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:17:05] do shall he do also
[1:17:06] more than this shall he do because i go
[1:17:08] unto my father
[1:17:09] it says that's the reason he said in
[1:17:11] mark 16
[1:17:13] the signs shall follow them that believe
[1:17:16] he says it was it was a living god
[1:17:19] in a man that could lay himself out
[1:17:23] before god
[1:17:24] according to the word of god and the
[1:17:26] word of god
[1:17:27] would make them will make would be made
[1:17:30] manifest
[1:17:31] in him a man that could lay himself
[1:17:37] before god and the word of god will be
[1:17:40] made
[1:17:40] manifest in him he didn't say he was a
[1:17:43] superman
[1:17:45] a man that will lay himself before god
[1:17:47] and then the word of god will be
[1:17:49] manifested
[1:17:50] in other words why was jesus born as a
[1:17:53] baby
[1:17:56] he could have just came in as an adult
[1:17:59] you know and
[1:18:00] died and and do all of those things but
[1:18:03] he came
[1:18:04] because it was for twofold one was to
[1:18:07] give of his own life
[1:18:09] so he could save us but the other he was
[1:18:12] actually creating a way showing a way of
[1:18:16] overcoming
[1:18:18] in the human flesh it was showing us how
[1:18:21] because
[1:18:22] when we go back and refer ourselves on
[1:18:24] how we overcome
[1:18:25] we look at his life it was a life lived
[1:18:28] within a flesh
[1:18:29] it was not a life lived just as a god
[1:18:32] but by him coming
[1:18:34] one of the purpose was to die but the
[1:18:36] other was to show us a way to overcome
[1:18:38] how we confirm the things how we dealt
[1:18:41] with things
[1:18:41] how we relied on nothing but what the
[1:18:43] father showed him
[1:18:45] and the same spirit that was in christ
[1:18:47] in the bride
[1:18:48] prabhanam tells us that she do she does
[1:18:51] nothing
[1:18:52] except what god shows her why because
[1:18:55] that shows that it's the same spirit
[1:18:59] it says and every time you see a man
[1:19:02] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:04] that's a paradox how that god of heaven
[1:19:08] makes himself known to this man he says
[1:19:12] talking talking through him
[1:19:16] walking through him living through him
[1:19:18] it's a paradox
[1:19:20] and when we are in the image of god and
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] and and god took of his own image and
[1:19:27] brought it himself
[1:19:28] into the image of his own brought into
[1:19:31] the image of his own
[1:19:32] image that he made himself
[1:19:36] it continues on it says god once lived
[1:19:39] in a man
[1:19:40] then sinner drove him he said then sin
[1:19:43] drove him away
[1:19:45] it says and then god killed his own son
[1:19:48] and let and then let god come back to
[1:19:51] live in his own people again
[1:19:53] yes sir that's a paradox it's strange
[1:19:56] it's strange things how that he does it
[1:20:00] the church god chose his church
[1:20:03] to be a paradox how that he took
[1:20:07] how that he took instead of the polish
[1:20:10] scholars
[1:20:12] making a church the theologian he took a
[1:20:15] bunch of
[1:20:16] ignorant unlearned fishermen and he gave
[1:20:19] them the key to their kingdoms
[1:20:23] not the caiaphas the high priest
[1:20:26] learneth what he did what did he do
[1:20:30] he says he gave it to the ignorant
[1:20:32] fisherman
[1:20:33] not a man who knowed all the ins and
[1:20:36] outs
[1:20:37] he gave it to a man that had uh
[1:20:41] that had prostrated himself before him
[1:20:45] and knowed him now you know not
[1:20:48] it says not to know him in his book
[1:20:53] his book is life but to know him his
[1:20:56] life
[1:20:57] the keys was given to peter paradox
[1:21:01] he will do that instead of caiaphasi's
[1:21:04] the smartest man
[1:21:05] in the religion realm he gave it to
[1:21:07] peter
[1:21:10] he's given it to the people that are
[1:21:12] coming and bowing before him
[1:21:15] prostrating themselves before giving
[1:21:17] themselves before him
[1:21:19] those are the ones that have the keys
[1:21:22] and i want to say tonight
[1:21:23] the keys have been given to you it says
[1:21:26] has he
[1:21:27] been hidden to the wise and the prudent
[1:21:28] but to you is given to know the
[1:21:31] mysteries of god let's all stand
[1:21:46] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:21:50] christ in you
[1:21:56] jesus christ today that's just by heads
[1:22:00] our gracious father we're so thankful
[1:22:01] lord
[1:22:04] lord oftentimes we don't understand all
[1:22:07] the ins and outs and
[1:22:09] but father our hearts desire is to
[1:22:12] come into a fully manifestation of
[1:22:14] christ today lord
[1:22:18] but i believe it's the outcry of every
[1:22:20] creation
[1:22:22] to manifest you in the best way that we
[1:22:24] can
[1:22:26] oftentimes our flesh comes on the way
[1:22:28] and
[1:22:29] we do and we say things father that we
[1:22:32] don't mean to
[1:22:35] but lord jesus we have a comfort in our
[1:22:37] heart to know that
[1:22:39] you've only manifested yourself to those
[1:22:41] that the father had given you in the
[1:22:43] beginning
[1:22:46] as your prophet said that you save
[1:22:49] us because it was predestinated for
[1:22:53] you to come in this age and to save us
[1:22:56] father i pray that you strengthen us
[1:22:58] today lord
[1:22:59] father where we are weak that you may
[1:23:01] give us strength
[1:23:03] where we've come short father that you
[1:23:04] may
[1:23:06] just give us lord encouragement and help
[1:23:08] us so we may overcome those things
[1:23:11] because what we desire more than
[1:23:13] anything is that manifestation of you
[1:23:15] lord
[1:23:17] we ask tonight that you bless each and
[1:23:18] every one lord
[1:23:21] father whatever the desire is tonight or
[1:23:23] the need is tonight
[1:23:25] lord we committed into your hands and we
[1:23:27] ask that you move upon it because you
[1:23:29] promised you will do it
[1:23:31] you said that ask and ask abundantly
[1:23:33] that your joy may be full
[1:23:35] lord we ask that you bless the people
[1:23:37] lord we commit everything to you we ask
[1:23:40] that you protect us father

[1:33:49] i was just thinking his brother billy
[1:33:51] was closing there when he he said
[1:33:53] mary was doing something ordinary
[1:33:56] abraham was doing something ordinary
[1:33:58] it kind of strikes me we can look
[1:34:00] forward to doing ordinary things
[1:34:03] it's just in the going to the work just
[1:34:05] in doing the normal things just doing
[1:34:07] the laundry and the dishes
[1:34:09] that the supernatural is happening
[1:34:12] christ

[1:34:37] things we can also display a life
[1:34:40] that someone would acquire lord what is
[1:34:42] our hope they would inquire lord what is
[1:34:44] our
[1:34:45] passion lord they'd be able to see
[1:34:47] within us that there's something
[1:34:48] different
[1:34:50] lord you're not asking us to go and just
[1:34:52] perform all these signs and
[1:34:54] and do all these big things lord you're
[1:34:57] asking us to be faithful in the small
[1:34:58] things
[1:34:59] you're asking us to be sincere lord and
[1:35:01] when we have a sincere heart
[1:35:03] you can use that you can use a person
[1:35:05] lord that will yield to yourself and
[1:35:07] what you have and what your word is
[1:35:09] and then within those things those other
[1:35:11] things those signs will follow
[1:35:13] even as brother david's been preaching
[1:35:15] lord the signs don't go before us lord
[1:35:17] but
[1:35:18] when we have your spirit the one we
[1:35:19] dedicate our lives those things are
[1:35:21] around us they follow us
[1:35:23] and those are the things that the people
[1:35:25] see and draw into you
[1:35:26] but we want to put you on display we
[1:35:28] want to be your billboard lord we want
[1:35:30] to be able to
[1:35:31] be something that you can reflect
[1:35:33] yourself off of
[1:35:34] lord this church is on fire lord and
[1:35:36] we're just asking that you continue to
[1:35:38] just

[1:35:41] reach out into
[1:35:42] the community as we reach out into lord
[1:35:44] our jobs and schools and to the people
[1:35:46] that we're able to reach
