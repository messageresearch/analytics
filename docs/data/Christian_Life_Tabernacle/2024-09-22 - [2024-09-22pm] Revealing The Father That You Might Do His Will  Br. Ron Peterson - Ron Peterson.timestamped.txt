[24:30] amen amen what a wonderful God we serve
[24:34] amen Amen brother Craig is a song and a
[24:36] testimony if it could come at this
[24:52] time God bless you brothers and
[24:55] sisters um some of the brother already
[24:58] know the testimony but
[25:01] um in uh business they tell you to do
[25:03] bullet points if something's long and
[25:06] anybody that knows me knows if I get
[25:08] excited or nervous I might talk too much
[25:10] so uh Lord uh this is a testimony and a
[25:14] praise report to the Lord um for what he
[25:18] did for me and uh I'll just try to get
[25:21] right to it um about a year ago I was
[25:24] coming to church uh in July of
[25:26] 2023 and um
[25:29] I looked over my shoulder backed out and
[25:32] uh backed out and somebody was going too
[25:35] fast and rear ended my extera and as
[25:37] part of my job I um I have to drive for
[25:39] a living so um they said it was my fault
[25:43] it was on my personal vehicle and I knew
[25:46] that would affect my driving record so
[25:49] um I tried to fight it but they said at
[25:51] worst it would be a 50/50 accident even
[25:53] though the person was probably doing 20
[25:55] or 25 M an hour in uh my apartment
[25:59] complex um so I told my employer and she
[26:02] wasn't too thrilled about it but a
[26:04] couple months later I'd been out all
[26:06] night um somebody was I think called out
[26:08] or something so I sometimes we go out at
[26:10] night and do
[26:11] X-rays and um I told them in the morning
[26:15] that
[26:16] um I was really tired I should probably
[26:18] take a few hours and they wanted me to
[26:20] go out anyway so um I was in a vehicle
[26:23] in apartment complex turned it too
[26:26] closely ripped the front end of the
[26:27] vehicle off so two accidents in a very
[26:30] short period of
[26:32] time and uh so
[26:34] essentially the employer had told me to
[26:38] uh um she basically pressured me into
[26:40] just saying they're going to call me
[26:42] they're going to and say that it was a
[26:44] hit and
[26:45] run and um so I just kind of listened to
[26:49] her and
[26:50] then
[26:52] um kind of went along with it for a
[26:55] moment and and then I immediately was
[26:57] convicted and I was like I'm not going
[26:58] to do that and uh so long story short um
[27:03] she was texting me and pressuring me to
[27:05] say it was hit and run and um I
[27:09] essentially she says she's a Christian
[27:11] and I told her you could bring this up
[27:13] to your pastor I could bring to my
[27:14] pastor we know what they'd say and um I
[27:18] said I'm not going to lie I'm going to
[27:19] tell the truth and she said that well
[27:22] when when we renew your insurance you
[27:23] might lose your job and I said well if
[27:25] it's the Lord's will for me to be with
[27:26] the Road Runner I'll be with the Road
[27:27] Runner
[27:29] and uh it kind of um affected the
[27:31] relationship with the employer since
[27:33] then so um couple weeks back the time
[27:37] for Renewal came up I don't know if she
[27:39] forgot about it but she said that um um
[27:42] she was calling me kind of freaking out
[27:44] and asking me some questions and anyway
[27:47] she said I had nine points on my
[27:49] record and she wanted me to go to the
[27:52] DMV and they wouldn't really be helpful
[27:54] without an
[27:55] appointment well the interesting thing
[27:57] is when I moved to Texas I had a
[27:58] California driver's license and shortly
[28:02] after um I think it was in
[28:05] 2022 I had got a Texas driver's license
[28:08] so I think all the points were going on
[28:10] to the California driver's license so
[28:13] went and got a print out uh it says you
[28:15] have no accidents or anything completely
[28:19] clear interesting I think that's in the
[28:22] sea of God's forgetfulness I don't know
[28:23] how they work
[28:25] but um so I get it it's I've got the
[28:28] records it says no accident so um and
[28:31] then I I heard something come over the
[28:32] pulpit right around that time it says
[28:34] it's not my business how he did it let
[28:36] go and let
[28:37] God so I was as a controlling person and
[28:42] trying to handle everything I can I'm
[28:45] I'm calling my insurance I'm calling
[28:46] them I'm I'm getting frustrated I'm
[28:48] trying to get answers and I was like you
[28:50] know what Craig just and I thought about
[28:52] how faithful God's been in my life and
[28:55] how he's even when I was in very sinful
[28:57] States my life he's um he's pulled me
[29:00] into the CFT of The Rock and and just
[29:02] shielded me from trouble even when I was
[29:06] wrong and so anyways um there was this
[29:10] it was the time and um so they were
[29:12] literally litigating about whether they
[29:15] were going to be able to keep me I
[29:16] forwarded my copy of my driver's license
[29:18] what the printout was and I asked some
[29:20] of the brothers brother Roger brother
[29:22] Jeff Howard and some of the brothers at
[29:24] the brother brother brother Matt's um
[29:27] morning study
[29:28] to pray for me and a lot of scriptures
[29:31] just kept popping into my mind and I
[29:33] thought well Jesus Christ is the same
[29:35] yesterday today and forever and if the
[29:38] same conditions are met he's going to be
[29:40] faithful and
[29:43] so um I'll just read a couple little
[29:45] scriptures I pulled out and then I
[29:46] actually posted but I just keep it
[29:48] really simple because y'all are better
[29:53] you guys have a very good knowledge of
[29:55] the word and I'm I'm still putting on
[29:56] the whole armor so to say
[29:58] say but the one thing
[30:01] that that struck me is
[30:06] that if we you know the word says that
[30:10] in the beginning was the word the word
[30:11] was with God and the Word was God and so
[30:14] when we keep his word and we stay in the
[30:16] word he's going to be he's going to
[30:19] stand for us and so I believe that to be
[30:22] true and so he's our Rock and our
[30:26] strength he's our shelter in the
[30:29] storm and so I started getting a piece
[30:32] after the brothers prayed for me and I
[30:34] was driving to Dallas and I just was
[30:36] listen Rel listening to a message
[30:37] brother Billy was singing and I just I
[30:39] had a piece come over me in the car and
[30:41] I just knew I had a revelation that
[30:43] whatever it was it was done and and I
[30:46] even posted to the brothers that um
[30:49] regardless of the um regardless of the
[30:53] outcome
[30:56] that I'm trusting in the Lord for his
[30:58] will in this matter God bless you and
[31:00] thank you for your
[31:01] prayers
[31:03] so I think because I stood for the word
[31:06] that the Lord stood for me and I just
[31:08] want to read a couple um scriptures
[31:10] because this is stuff that he says in in
[31:13] his word whosoever therefore shall
[31:15] confess me before men I will confess him
[31:17] before my Father which is in heaven but
[31:19] whoever shall deny me before men I will
[31:22] also deny him before my Father in
[31:26] heaven and then in Psalm
[31:28] 62 but there I'll read something before
[31:31] that verily I say unto you whatsoever
[31:33] you bind on Earth shall be bound in
[31:35] heaven and whatsoever soever you shall
[31:37] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[31:39] again I say unto you that if two of you
[31:41] shall agree on Earth as touching
[31:43] anything they shall ask it should be
[31:45] done for them so that my father in
[31:48] Heaven may be glorified where two or
[31:50] three are gathered in my name there I'll
[31:53] be in their midst
[31:54] so I just was just trusting in the the
[31:58] Lord I had Brothers praying um in that
[32:01] moment and they were actually talking to
[32:04] the insurance company and um like I said
[32:07] the interesting thing is that I got the
[32:09] print out and that my Texas printout
[32:12] with my Texas driver's license from 2022
[32:15] before both accidents has zero points on
[32:18] it so I thought that was wonderful so I
[32:21] I don't know how God did it exactly but
[32:23] I think that he just cast all of that
[32:26] into the sea of the forgetfulness and as
[32:28] of this moment as far as I know I have a
[32:30] clean Texas driver's license and I'm and
[32:32] uh I had the the assurance that God was
[32:34] going to have my back I stood for his
[32:37] word he stood for me and uh he's
[32:39] faithful and just and I just wanted I
[32:40] just feel that testimony was for
[32:42] somebody and uh the other day um I was
[32:45] listening to a message and a sentence
[32:47] came in my heart in my mind dropped into
[32:50] my heart why haven't you given my
[32:54] testimony not mine but his and and so I
[32:58] believe that was from God and I believe
[32:59] that was for somebody here I'd already
[33:01] shared this with some individuals and so
[33:03] I'm I get very nervous when I speak in
[33:05] front of people so I just wanted to um
[33:08] to share that with you brothers and
[33:09] sisters and um I'm not going to read
[33:11] Psalm 62 and Psalm 46 um but I will say
[33:15] God is our refuge and our strength the
[33:16] very has uh present help in time of
[33:19] trouble um and I don't fear anymore and
[33:22] so I I know that he's um he's had his
[33:24] hand over my life for about four or five
[33:26] years now and I just I'm so thankful
[33:28] that he plucked me out of the world so I
[33:30] just wanted to thank God and praise him
[33:32] for what he's doing and um I I was
[33:35] wondering if um maybe brother Ben could
[33:37] help me with a song that I love but I'm
[33:39] not really good I don't have the right
[33:41] voice for it I'm down from his glory
[33:44] could you help me with that when anybody
[33:45] wants to sing along I just um I I love
[33:48] that song and I've always wanted to sing
[33:50] it thank you brothers and sisters
[33:58] I don't know what key you guys sing it
[33:59] in whatever
[34:05] you down from his

[56:25] I'd like you to turn with me if you
[56:27] would in your Bibles to St John chapter
[56:33] 4
[56:36] amen I told David in the back office I
[56:39] said uh for those of your church that
[56:42] fact checks everything that I said uh I
[56:46] said that the the the word of the
[56:49] Lord uh 200 and some odd times even in
[56:53] the New Testament that is incorrect
[56:54] there only there's only 30 13 times in
[56:57] the New Testament 234 in the old uh if
[57:00] you fact check that
[57:02] maybe I might be off a little time or
[57:04] two but that's okay when you're my age
[57:07] you give a little bit of Grace sister
[57:09] Elizabeth God bless you your husband met
[57:11] me this morning I'm Elizabeth's husband
[57:15] you know Elizabeth stiny I said who
[57:16] don't know Elizabeth stiny I said she's
[57:19] very popular anyway God bless you sis
[57:22] good to see you yeah yeah as your face
[57:25] turns red there
[57:27] we I'm going to read here from St John
[57:30] 4:
[57:32] 25 through 26 the woman saith unto him I
[57:37] know that Messiah cometh which is called
[57:41] Christ and when he has come he will tell
[57:44] us all
[57:46] things and Jesus saith unto
[57:49] her I that speak unto
[57:53] thee am he may God bless the reading of
[57:56] his word you all may be seated this
[57:58] evening in the presence of
[58:01] God
[58:03] Amen now we had stopped
[58:06] there this
[58:09] morning in our first
[58:12] uh part there we we talked about how
[58:15] Samuel the word of the Lord came to
[58:17] Samuel and it wasn't known to him the
[58:20] word hasn't been revealed to him at that
[58:23] time understand that the revelation of
[58:25] God comes in a due season and a due
[58:28] time brother random said that God keeps
[58:31] all his appointments and he is going to
[58:34] keep as an appointment with you he's
[58:37] going to reveal things in due season
[58:41] even to you now you have to understand
[58:45] that when you are a child you think as a
[58:48] child you speak as a child you
[58:50] understood as a child but when you
[58:52] become a man so there Comes A Time In
[58:54] spiritual
[58:56] uh let's say relationship and growing up
[58:59] and spiritual
[59:00] maturity that you begin to catch things
[59:03] that you didn't catch
[59:05] before and so it is even with our Bible
[59:08] and with the message of the hour I am
[59:10] absolutely
[59:12] amazed at when I listen to tapes now I
[59:16] read my Bible now it takes on a whole
[59:20] new um emphasis a whole new
[59:23] understanding yes I read it before yes
[59:26] I've heard it before but now because I
[59:29] have a greater mature understanding it's
[59:32] revealed to us in season so we thank God
[59:34] for that amen even Jesus told his
[59:37] disciples he said look I have many
[59:39] things yet to share with you but seeing
[59:42] that you cannot bear them now how be it
[59:45] after I'm gone you'll begin to catch
[59:47] these things and I will have the Holy
[59:50] Spirit bring to your
[59:52] remembrance everything that I've spoken
[59:54] to you so I want to take and uh I'm not
[59:58] going to take a whole lot of time here
[1:00:00] uh tonight with you and and hold you too
[1:00:04] long but uh let's uh take uh let's call
[1:00:08] this the Christ of God part two and I
[1:00:11] want to take a subject and a subject the
[1:00:15] reason I give a subject is I'm going to
[1:00:17] go in a certain
[1:00:18] direction okay so if you know the
[1:00:22] direction in which you're going it's
[1:00:24] it's sometimes good for the people and
[1:00:27] uh so I want to call uh the subject
[1:00:32] revealing the
[1:00:35] father that you might do his
[1:00:39] will revealing the
[1:00:41] father that you might do his will
[1:00:45] remember now that Jesus told us so many
[1:00:47] times look I did not come to reveal
[1:00:52] myself the son can do nothing except the
[1:00:55] father reveal it to
[1:00:57] so he says my job is to come and to
[1:01:01] reveal the
[1:01:03] father understand when eternity breaks
[1:01:06] into that great realm when we go from
[1:01:09] mortality to
[1:01:11] immortality and we begin to understand
[1:01:14] even to know him as he is
[1:01:17] known you will have a such a greater
[1:01:20] understanding at that time right now you
[1:01:23] have a partial
[1:01:24] reality and God deals with you he's
[1:01:27] moving you from the understanding as a
[1:01:29] child into the understanding of a man
[1:01:32] and so you begin to catch things that
[1:01:34] you didn't catch
[1:01:36] before and so um we know that this
[1:01:42] anointing this Christ of God again like
[1:01:45] I
[1:01:46] said that it was the name Christ was
[1:01:49] never used in the Old Testament it's
[1:01:51] only used in the New Testament and yet
[1:01:54] brother brandham comes and says look it
[1:01:58] was Christ and
[1:01:59] David playing out his part he said this
[1:02:02] great Bible is a
[1:02:05] drama and it has act one scene
[1:02:09] one in the beginning
[1:02:12] God so we began to now see that God has
[1:02:15] this great
[1:02:17] drama and then it comes down into our
[1:02:20] day and understand we are playing out a
[1:02:22] drama right
[1:02:23] now every one of you have a
[1:02:26] position excuse
[1:02:29] me and that part is an extremely
[1:02:32] important
[1:02:34] part just like a watch has many parts to
[1:02:38] it and the parts that are the most
[1:02:40] important are not the parts you
[1:02:44] see it's the behind the
[1:02:46] scenes it's the mainspring it's the
[1:02:49] little sprockets and things that keep
[1:02:51] moving but understand you say well I may
[1:02:54] not have a great integral part yes you
[1:02:57] do even the Bible says do not the the
[1:03:01] comely parts do not th those That You
[1:03:04] Don't See play a very important part and
[1:03:06] when one of those suffers the whole body
[1:03:09] suffers is that
[1:03:11] correct and so we understand how
[1:03:14] important it is that each one of us pay
[1:03:17] uh play an important part now if you've
[1:03:21] ever watched an
[1:03:22] orchestra and you watch the great
[1:03:24] Maestro and he gets up here and he's
[1:03:26] orchestrating and uh I happened to see
[1:03:29] one
[1:03:30] time and uh a very well-known Maestro we
[1:03:36] were in the country of
[1:03:38] Vietnam and uh we had a day before we
[1:03:42] were leaving to go home we had been
[1:03:44] preaching there in Vietnam for about two
[1:03:47] weeks long story short we went and said
[1:03:50] hey we have tonight off why don't we go
[1:03:52] see this this great music musical thing
[1:03:56] that they were putting on I've never
[1:03:58] seen one and so he comes out they
[1:04:00] introduce him he comes out he bows to
[1:04:04] his orchestra he bows to the people and
[1:04:08] he he's got some kind of little pencil
[1:04:10] like thing you know tick tick tick tick
[1:04:14] like that and he turns around to his
[1:04:21] orchestra everybody
[1:04:30] and now as he begins to orchestrate the
[1:04:32] music I want you to understand he was
[1:04:34] the
[1:04:35] music he was only orchestrating each one
[1:04:39] and you would watch he would do certain
[1:04:42] things like this and he would over here
[1:04:44] and he'd tell them okay come up like
[1:04:46] this he point to another and Sh and
[1:04:48] everybody was playing their
[1:04:50] part and so it is in this end time we
[1:04:55] had a great
[1:04:56] mestro a prophet of God telling us that
[1:04:59] each one of us have an integral part in
[1:05:02] this great Symphony or this great
[1:05:04] drama you must Play Your Part the little
[1:05:07] Piccolo does not have the lead in every
[1:05:10] part of the music and every stanza but
[1:05:14] when he is to play He's supposed to
[1:05:16] play and I remember right at the uh
[1:05:20] cresendo when everything was coming to a
[1:05:22] head and you could feel it and the m
[1:05:28] like this and his hair is moving all
[1:05:30] over he's just going and he points to I
[1:05:33] think it was the lead
[1:05:36] violin and like this and this guy stands
[1:05:39] up and I mean he set that thing on
[1:05:42] fire he
[1:05:45] was and just going and going and it was
[1:05:48] coming to a great cresendo I want you to
[1:05:52] understand that we are now this brother
[1:05:55] R is saying look this is it this this is
[1:05:58] greater than the
[1:05:59] creation this is greater than Genesis 1
[1:06:02] in the beginning God
[1:06:04] created this is the cresendo of why he
[1:06:08] did the creation this is why he went to
[1:06:11] Calvary this is why he shed his blood
[1:06:14] this is the crescendo because this is
[1:06:16] the whole wrapping up this is the final
[1:06:19] finale and just like the fireworks that
[1:06:22] you see on July the 4th and they boom
[1:06:25] boom boom but the the climax of every
[1:06:28] fireworks is the last minute and all of
[1:06:31] a sudden you hear and all a
[1:06:36] sudden and the whole sky lights up I
[1:06:39] want you to understand brother Brenham
[1:06:41] said look you you read uh the seven
[1:06:44] Church ages because it lays a foundation
[1:06:47] for the Seven Seals and he said like a
[1:06:52] um Roman Candle a Mighty uh burst of
[1:06:57] Illumination coming forth boom in the
[1:06:59] first church age second Church age boom
[1:07:02] Another illumination until finally we
[1:07:05] come down here to the last Church age
[1:07:08] this is the cresendo and burst after
[1:07:11] burst of Illumination until before our
[1:07:15] wondering
[1:07:16] eyes 11 or 1200
[1:07:20] sermons come into a
[1:07:22] pattern and we see Christ
[1:07:26] and we say oh my God it was not just one
[1:07:32] sermon it was not just one
[1:07:35] Revelation but Revelation upon
[1:07:38] Revelation sermon upon sermon here a
[1:07:41] little there a little and as it begins
[1:07:45] to reveal itself to
[1:07:47] you and you understand your
[1:07:51] part and you begin to play your part
[1:07:54] because
[1:07:55] it's so important until you know your
[1:07:59] position like I told you in this morning
[1:08:02] brother R said when the true church
[1:08:05] catches the true Revelation now there
[1:08:08] when you say when the true church there
[1:08:09] must be a false church and catches the
[1:08:13] true Revel there must be a false
[1:08:15] Revelation you understand there is a
[1:08:18] paradox and so it says when she begins
[1:08:21] to understand her
[1:08:23] position and so it is we as the bride of
[1:08:26] Christ I want you to understand that now
[1:08:30] with this is not the orchestration of
[1:08:34] man this is the orchestration of the
[1:08:37] Holy
[1:08:38] Spirit and he is now the great Maestro
[1:08:41] and what's amazing is the brothers in
[1:08:44] Africa in the
[1:08:47] Philippines up in Canada around the
[1:08:52] world Ministries are catching Revel
[1:08:55] ation that they've never caught before
[1:08:57] and they're not sitting here sending
[1:09:00] notes to one
[1:09:01] another nor are they streaming one
[1:09:04] another's services I don't need to
[1:09:06] stream other Men's Ministry I want to
[1:09:09] stream his ministry by way of the Holy
[1:09:12] Spirit understand what I'm saying I'm
[1:09:14] not against that but I want to be under
[1:09:17] the main channel of inspiration of the
[1:09:20] Holy
[1:09:21] Spirit the Holy Spirit alone is the
[1:09:24] divine revealer of the word of God
[1:09:28] therefore without the Holy Spirit you'll
[1:09:31] not catch what God is
[1:09:33] doing now this anointing that we call
[1:09:36] the
[1:09:37] Christ brother Bram said now be careful
[1:09:39] on the on the level of
[1:09:42] anointings he said you can have the
[1:09:44] anointing of the Holy Spirit on you 24
[1:09:47] hours a day in your soul black as night
[1:09:49] and on its way to
[1:09:51] hell he said depends on the outer Court
[1:09:54] inner Court holy of holies Body Spirit
[1:09:58] Soul so we see you can activate the
[1:10:01] gifts of the Spirit anointing on the
[1:10:06] spirit Caiaphas
[1:10:09] prophesied we see those
[1:10:12] things and so you understand it's not
[1:10:15] just the operating of the gifts brother
[1:10:19] Brenham when he came one of the hardest
[1:10:21] things now when did the seven Church
[1:10:23] AIDS the seventh Church Church age when
[1:10:25] did it begin what
[1:10:27] year what year did it begin 19 what 06
[1:10:32] you know that I'm this is not I'm not
[1:10:33] trying this isn't school you're not
[1:10:35] going to get an F CU you
[1:10:37] flunk because you missed okay
[1:10:40] 1906 when was brother Brenan born
[1:10:44] 1909 so he was already Born Into the
[1:10:47] lysan age which now remember Pentecost
[1:10:51] started in 1906 and it went like a
[1:10:53] wildfire
[1:10:55] gifts and anointings and talking in
[1:10:58] tongues and all kinds of manifestation
[1:11:01] of the spirit and they said this is the
[1:11:03] latter rain and brother Brenham had to
[1:11:05] come and wean us away from former
[1:11:09] teaching to say this is not the latter
[1:11:11] rain because the mor Reign the the the
[1:11:14] former Reign had not yet
[1:11:16] come so he's weaning us away from what
[1:11:20] we call
[1:11:22] Pentecostalism tongues and
[1:11:24] interpretation and all this stuff and
[1:11:27] manifestations brother Brenham so much
[1:11:29] of the time and he get up and start to
[1:11:31] preach
[1:11:33] and like that and and then all of a
[1:11:35] sudden then he'd say well thank you Lord
[1:11:37] and everything and how could he correct
[1:11:39] all of this stuff that wasn't his home
[1:11:42] church and Gifts were operating thank
[1:11:44] you Lord we appreciate that and
[1:11:47] everything but then he would tell his
[1:11:49] Brethren he even told Brother Billy Paul
[1:11:52] and I got the chance to travel with him
[1:11:53] and he said one time there was tongues
[1:11:56] and
[1:11:57] interpretation
[1:11:59] and brother brandham told Billy Paul he
[1:12:02] said that brother that spoke in tongues
[1:12:04] and the one interpreted he said I had
[1:12:07] the
[1:12:08] translation of the tongues that that
[1:12:10] brother was speaking and He was cursing
[1:12:15] God now brother Brenham even there with
[1:12:17] Brenham Tabernacle he said okay I've let
[1:12:19] you play with the gifts all these years
[1:12:22] it's time that we're going to put them
[1:12:24] in order
[1:12:26] okay and what caused Junior Jackson and
[1:12:30] Don rutle to split off they were the
[1:12:32] sister churches what caused them to
[1:12:36] split because brother Brandon put Church
[1:12:38] order put it in order he said okay
[1:12:40] tongues and interpretation we're not
[1:12:42] going to have it anymore we're going to
[1:12:43] take the gifts in the back room I'm not
[1:12:45] here to teach you all this stuff I want
[1:12:47] to take you in a certain direction that
[1:12:49] brother Brenham is weaning his church
[1:12:52] away and if I could say this the whole
[1:12:55] Church age away from all of this former
[1:12:59] teaching so he's got to bring us back to
[1:13:03] correct teaching that we might
[1:13:05] understand this anointing that is called
[1:13:07] the Christ because the rain falls on the
[1:13:10] just and
[1:13:12] the
[1:13:14] unjust so he said you don't judge it by
[1:13:17] the
[1:13:18] anointing don't judge it by the signs
[1:13:21] judge it by the word many of them have
[1:13:24] called them elves Apostles and are not
[1:13:27] and we have found them to be
[1:13:29] Liars he said now that's a bold
[1:13:32] statement to be said he said how is it
[1:13:34] then that you judge the people he said
[1:13:37] it's not you judging them it's the word
[1:13:39] judging them that's why the word is our
[1:13:46] absolute the word of God is our absolute
[1:13:49] the message of the
[1:13:50] hour if we could say this is our
[1:13:53] absolute also because his absolute was
[1:13:56] the
[1:13:57] word brother Brenham we uh that is such
[1:14:00] an amazing thing that that it could be
[1:14:03] the uh 23rd chapter of the Book of
[1:14:06] Revelation or whatever he said oh no my
[1:14:08] brother that would be adding to the
[1:14:10] word he said what it is is God's
[1:14:13] revealing what's already been in
[1:14:15] there but it's been hidden
[1:14:20] so this woman received the Messi sign
[1:14:23] it's one of the few times
[1:14:25] that Christ revealed
[1:14:28] himself personally to a
[1:14:31] individual we said the one woman the one
[1:14:35] that speaks to you is
[1:14:37] he now she goes and tells everybody hey
[1:14:41] come see a man what a stir she runs into
[1:14:43] the City come and see a man that told me
[1:14:46] all this so let's let's kind of drop in
[1:14:49] now into this part of the scripture and
[1:14:52] it causes stir he discerned my heart
[1:14:55] told me
[1:14:56] everything and it wasn't until they
[1:14:59] heard
[1:15:00] themselves from The Words of Christ
[1:15:02] himself catching the logos thought of
[1:15:05] God that they actually then became
[1:15:09] Believers not because someone told them
[1:15:12] to come and see but they came and saw
[1:15:17] themselves all of you got this by a
[1:15:21] personal revelation though somebody told
[1:15:24] you come and see
[1:15:25] somebody gave you a tape and book
[1:15:28] somebody shared with you but it's when
[1:15:30] you had an experience with God that your
[1:15:33] eyes come
[1:15:35] open now on the road to
[1:15:41] emus which means Earnest desire you have
[1:15:45] two disciples after the crucifixion of
[1:15:49] Christ and they are now sad and
[1:15:52] downtrodden got long faces
[1:15:55] and the resurrected Christ comes and he
[1:15:58] walks along with them are we together in
[1:16:00] the scripture now okay now he's walking
[1:16:04] with them why are you so sad what what
[1:16:07] what's going
[1:16:09] on haven't you been around here what
[1:16:12] this man we that we called Jesus we we
[1:16:15] thought that he was the Messiah and all
[1:16:18] of this but you know what they crucified
[1:16:20] him and we're upset and and now we're in
[1:16:22] fear of our lives and we're downtrodden
[1:16:24] and and everything and he began to take
[1:16:27] the scriptures concerning
[1:16:29] himself and he began to lay the
[1:16:32] scriptures is it not written and every
[1:16:34] they and it it caused what I call
[1:16:36] heartburn because they said did not our
[1:16:38] hearts burn within
[1:16:40] us but it still didn't open their
[1:16:43] eyes understand here is the resurrected
[1:16:46] Christ the one that they had seen and
[1:16:47] heard
[1:16:50] preached and he's walking with them but
[1:16:53] he's now in a form that they don't
[1:16:57] recognize
[1:16:58] him and so now he's walking along with
[1:17:01] him sharing the word their hearts are
[1:17:04] burning and yet they don't know who it
[1:17:07] is and he made the Bible says he made as
[1:17:10] though he would go
[1:17:12] further you know God is Con is is not
[1:17:15] stagnant he's constant like the sun from
[1:17:19] east to west it doesn't stop it's
[1:17:22] constant you understand and and so God
[1:17:25] is a constant one moving that's why
[1:17:29] you've got to move with him you got
[1:17:31] Revelation now but you need more
[1:17:34] tomorrow so just like a teacher okay you
[1:17:37] did good you passed the class for sixth
[1:17:40] grade but now you got
[1:17:42] seventh you can do better than what you

[1:17:47] teachers Inspire their
[1:17:50] students good teachers in any school

[1:18:01] they Inspire and every one of you I will
[1:18:03] have all of you to witness this that you

[1:18:14] name but you remember the ones that
[1:18:16] inspired you you remember the ones that
[1:18:20] had uh something that quickened inside
[1:18:23] of you that that the that told you hey

[1:18:43] I am she would dress up and she would
[1:18:47] only she would come out and she says the
[1:18:49] whole class can be
[1:18:51] dismissed if you can guess who I am

[1:18:56] robe and says just some
[1:19:00] line at two

[1:19:16] set free thank God for those smart
[1:19:23] people let me let me tell you when one
[1:19:25] person in the church begins to catch
[1:19:27] Revelation it causes others that's oh my
[1:19:31] Hallelujah because you know what faith
[1:19:34] energizes
[1:19:36] faith as iron sharpeneth
[1:19:39] iron I want you to understand there are
[1:19:41] some preachers that preach real well and
[1:19:45] boy I tell you what that they the
[1:19:47] Eternal rainbow and this and that and on
[1:19:49] and on and they preach and they're so on
[1:19:51] fire and they speak so fast I cannot
[1:19:54] even think as fast as some of these guys
[1:19:56] preach much less think about how does a
[1:19:59] Translator
[1:20:01] translate and I telling you
[1:20:04] God and you're going my
[1:20:09] goodness and sometimes you come out
[1:20:11] after the service wow what did he say uh
[1:20:15] uh hold on hold on uh give me a hand
[1:20:20] give me
[1:20:22] um I don't remember what he said but
[1:20:25] boom my man he was
[1:20:27] inspired he might have been so inspired
[1:20:30] but if he was up here and it doesn't
[1:20:32] transferred to you it did you no
[1:20:34] good now I want to ask you on brother
[1:20:37] Brenham sermons when you listen is it so
[1:20:39] high and so above you you never caught
[1:20:41] it wow he was so deep he was so
[1:20:45] spiritual I couldn't catch it
[1:20:49] no brother brandham if he taught
[1:20:51] something and he talked about how many
[1:20:54] of you know he got a sermon off a
[1:20:57] cigarette
[1:20:59] pack and the remember he's walking along
[1:21:03] and he sees a cigarette pack a cigarette
[1:21:07] pack and the the voice tells him pick it
[1:21:11] up I ain't going to pick it up he's
[1:21:13] arguing I ain't going to pick up the
[1:21:15] cigarettes they're filthy no no go back
[1:21:18] and pick it he picks it up a thinking
[1:21:20] man's
[1:21:22] filter wow hee preaches a whole sermon
[1:21:26] on a thinking man's filter and he takes
[1:21:29] natural filters spiritual filters the
[1:21:31] word of God's filter on and on and when
[1:21:34] you got
[1:21:35] done you understood he talked about a
[1:21:38] filter and he said now God's word is a
[1:21:41] filter and he said we just don't take
[1:21:44] and let everything that comes through it
[1:21:46] because from Genesis to Revelation if it
[1:21:49] doesn't line up if the umum Thum doesn't
[1:21:53] light up by revelation from Genesis to
[1:21:56] Revelation let it
[1:22:01] go so a lot of times it there will be so
[1:22:04] much
[1:22:07] information and since when do we think
[1:22:09] now I'm not against this please do not
[1:22:13] take me
[1:22:15] wrong but but is anointing have to be
[1:22:22] loud I want to ask you when you're in
[1:22:25] your prayer closet and you have a real
[1:22:28] intimate
[1:22:29] time with God do you scream your
[1:22:37] prayer I will tell you and I'm sharing
[1:22:39] with you now a little bit of me
[1:22:42] personally when I have something so on
[1:22:45] my heart and I'm
[1:22:46] burdened and I'm in my prayer closet
[1:22:49] before God there are times I can't even
[1:22:53] say with words
[1:22:56] oh oh
[1:23:00] God oh God and moanings and
[1:23:06] groanings that cannot be
[1:23:08] understood is a language that God
[1:23:12] understand and I speak intimately to him
[1:23:16] in a
[1:23:17] broken contrite spirit he said a broken
[1:23:21] and contrite spirit I will not refuse
[1:23:23] sayi God
[1:23:27] so I remember I'm just giving you an
[1:23:30] example and please forgive me if some of
[1:23:32] you are from Germany and you speak
[1:23:34] German or whatever but I was over there
[1:23:37] from 84 to 89 with the voice of God
[1:23:40] recording
[1:23:42] and I remember we were in a German
[1:23:45] church
[1:23:49] and I will just kind of give you an
[1:23:53] example of how they would ask a brother
[1:23:56] to pray brother so and so
[1:24:00] come come and see
[1:24:09] here and they come
[1:24:11] up and they start very
[1:24:20] softly
[1:24:22] for and
[1:24:29] and on
[1:24:30] until
[1:24:32] God screaming and
[1:24:34] yelling in
[1:24:39] Jus am
[1:24:47] man sounds like a
[1:24:49] Pharisee he is known by broadening his
[1:24:52] fla trees by his long
[1:24:56] prayers reminds me of what was
[1:25:01] it pho's dying Ten
[1:25:04] Commandments remember that guy with it
[1:25:07] he got the lamp
[1:25:08] oh the son of Egypt you are dying and
[1:25:12] everything like that and Pharaoh look
[1:25:14] that old wind
[1:25:17] bag it is not by how loud you pray your
[1:25:21] prayer
[1:25:25] sometimes I will say the most effective
[1:25:29] sermons to the people are the ones that
[1:25:33] you
[1:25:35] understand and when you get done with
[1:25:37] the sermon you remember the sermon you
[1:25:39] remember the title you remember the
[1:25:42] scripture you remember who preached it
[1:25:45] you'll say back in 1984 I remember you
[1:25:47] were here and you preach thus and thus
[1:25:49] and I'll tell you that had an effect on
[1:25:51] me sermons that don't have an effect
[1:25:54] don't cause you to go
[1:25:58] higher sermons that have an effect cause
[1:26:01] you to go home to get closer with God to
[1:26:06] get into that intimate detail I'm not
[1:26:11] against I myself am an emotional
[1:26:15] person but when the Holy Spirit came in
[1:26:19] the meetings of brother brandham how
[1:26:21] many of you listen to tapes
[1:26:26] I want to ask you when he when he says
[1:26:29] yeah he's been preaching he said okay
[1:26:31] now I said I just want you to all be
[1:26:32] real reverent I want you to sit real
[1:26:35] still don't move don't get up to go to
[1:26:37] the use the
[1:26:38] restroom he said you know what I'm
[1:26:40] waiting
[1:26:42] for it's
[1:26:45] him maybe I said something that didn't
[1:26:48] please him you all know I'm just and all
[1:26:50] of a sudden he says he's here now I take
[1:26:54] every Spirit under my control for the
[1:26:56] glory of
[1:26:57] God and he says now don't move and
[1:27:00] brother Brandon preferred the organ over
[1:27:03] the piano do you all know that at the
[1:27:06] end of the service
[1:27:10] why the spirit of God is Meek like a
[1:27:14] dove and a percussion
[1:27:17] instrument
[1:27:19] okay you understand only believe ding
[1:27:23] ding ding ding D ding ding ding whatever
[1:27:27] right you got to you got to hit this
[1:27:29] thing but the
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:37] organ he said he's here now he's Meek
[1:27:41] he's gentle like a dove don't nobody
[1:27:45] move all of a sudden that you you've
[1:27:48] seen in the
[1:27:49] movie there's a black woman
[1:27:52] woo oh
[1:27:55] oh brother Ram he's still and all of a
[1:27:58] sudden he said he's looking he looks
[1:28:01] away he
[1:28:04] keeps he says excuse me that colored
[1:28:09] woman right back here and she's standing
[1:28:11] up now she's not making a
[1:28:14] spectacle but God is there dealing with
[1:28:17] her heart he said the pillar of fire is
[1:28:20] right above you
[1:28:26] you see my brother my
[1:28:29] sister so much of the
[1:28:31] time we think that unless it's loud it's
[1:28:35] not
[1:28:37] anointed volume is one thing I believe
[1:28:39] in using
[1:28:42] volume but a still Small
[1:28:45] Voice and a sermon where the preacher is
[1:28:48] preaching to you to where you can
[1:28:51] understand it has an effect to where the
[1:28:54] even the little boys you can ask
[1:28:57] them what did that Minister preach
[1:29:00] about and if even the little ones didn't
[1:29:03] catch it there's something wrong so
[1:29:08] anyway the testimony of the woman
[1:29:10] stirred the
[1:29:12] people but I want you to see
[1:29:18] here now let me see here excuse me
[1:29:20] because I I didn't print this out
[1:29:25] in St John 4: 41 and
[1:29:29] 42 remember she's gone into the City and
[1:29:32] said come see a man that right who under
[1:29:36] the first and second pull told me all
[1:29:39] these discernments discern my heart and
[1:29:41] oh my came right so remember first and
[1:29:45] second pole are
[1:29:46] attractions third poll is not third poll
[1:29:51] separation because when did Jesus
[1:29:54] changed his
[1:29:55] ministry St John
[1:29:58] 6 when he said except you eat my blood
[1:30:00] and drink eat my flesh drink my blood
[1:30:03] you have no part with me and many of his
[1:30:05] disciples said this is the hard saying
[1:30:06] who can hear it and the Bible says and
[1:30:09] many of his disciples walked with him no
[1:30:12] more is that right what verse is that St
[1:30:15] John
[1:30:16] 666 mark of the
[1:30:18] beast and they went away so Jesus now he
[1:30:22] went after him he said oh
[1:30:25] me light oh
[1:30:27] in
[1:30:29] oh he began no did did did he go and
[1:30:33] chase him and say excuse me oh pardon me
[1:30:36] excuse him I'm so sorry I offended you
[1:30:40] come back here come I don't want you to
[1:30:42] eat my flesh and drink my blood I'm not
[1:30:44] a
[1:30:45] cannibal you know what he
[1:30:47] did he walked down there to his
[1:30:50] disciples
[1:30:55] does this offend
[1:30:57] you
[1:30:59] Peter does this offend
[1:31:02] you can you handle
[1:31:05] this why don't you
[1:31:07] go why don't you go also is this too
[1:31:11] much can you not handle it does this
[1:31:14] offend
[1:31:17] you you see the word of God revealed in
[1:31:19] its season can become an offense and
[1:31:22] they walked away this hard
[1:31:24] saying when brother Brenham changed his
[1:31:27] ministry and went from first and second
[1:31:29] poll they all left him Full Gospel
[1:31:31] businessmen closed their doors brother
[1:31:34] Ram said I sat in Tucson for 18
[1:31:38] months not an
[1:31:41] invitation at the Apex of his ministry
[1:31:44] revealing of the
[1:31:46] seals but he's changing the
[1:31:49] administration you understand it became
[1:31:52] an offensive pull does does this offend
[1:31:57] you the word of God Brother David
[1:32:00] preached over there in Congo God's a
[1:32:03] separator oh you really believe that
[1:32:05] God's a separator as he did in the
[1:32:08] beginning Genesis 1 he separated light
[1:32:10] from Darkness God through his whole
[1:32:13] Bible separated and it wasn't until God
[1:32:16] had Abraham separate from lot lot you
[1:32:19] see kept Abraham
[1:32:22] back until he separated from from lot
[1:32:26] then Abraham got the promise when you
[1:32:29] separate from out of the
[1:32:32] world come be ye separate sayeth the
[1:32:35] Lord I will receive you so the final
[1:32:39] separation in this seventh Church age is
[1:32:41] going to be what
[1:32:43] Rapture to in
[1:32:47] bed to it work final separation I'm
[1:32:51] going to separate the foolish from the
[1:32:53] wise
[1:32:56] right and we can all sit here and say oh
[1:32:59] I believe we're all wise virgin we have
[1:33:02] the Holy Spirit I want to know do you
[1:33:03] have the Holy
[1:33:05] Spirit is he revealing to
[1:33:09] you or are you just so excited that
[1:33:12] you're part of the called well let's go
[1:33:16] beyond
[1:33:18] calling let's make our calling and our
[1:33:21] election sure
[1:33:24] lest we
[1:33:26] fall so the testimony of the woman
[1:33:29] stirred the people let me just show you
[1:33:31] I'm sorry I I I'm just kind of going
[1:33:34] here and there but I feel comfortable
[1:33:37] and I don't feel I have to impress you
[1:33:40] is this okay brother
[1:33:42] David okay St John 4 verse 41 and
[1:33:48] 42 and many more believe because of his
[1:33:51] own word
[1:33:54] and said unto the woman now we believe
[1:33:57] not because of thy
[1:33:59] saying not because of your testimony
[1:34:01] yeah you stir us come see a
[1:34:05] man but we have heard him
[1:34:08] ourselves and know that this is
[1:34:12] indeed the Christ the savior of the word
[1:34:17] of the world the testimony of the woman
[1:34:20] caused to stir come see a
[1:34:22] man but but it wasn't until they heard
[1:34:26] themselves Christ
[1:34:29] speaking then they
[1:34:32] believed so it's been with each one of
[1:34:34] us hey somebody had to tell you hey God
[1:34:37] sent a prophet oh yeah well there'll be
[1:34:39] a lot of false prophets in the end time
[1:34:42] too yeah okay well just come and
[1:34:46] listen I remember my wife had been my
[1:34:50] girlfriend before we got converted into
[1:34:52] this message
[1:34:55] and I had backslid went away from God
[1:34:58] wasn't doing right she came over to
[1:35:00] visit me from Phoenix she lived in

[1:35:13] of my
[1:35:15] testimony I lit up a marijuana cigarette
[1:35:18] in front of her and she absolutely
[1:35:21] freaked out she said I'll tell you
[1:35:24] what I want nothing to do with you if
[1:35:28] you're going to act like that and do the
[1:35:30] things of the
[1:35:31] world she said I don't want a boyfriend
[1:35:34] that's going to be dabbling in that kind
[1:35:36] of stuff
[1:35:38] okay so she cut off that relationship
[1:35:41] she flew back to
[1:35:43] Phoenix and I thought yeah okay cool you
[1:35:46] know how you're you want to be cool all
[1:35:47] right yeah I guess that's not the one
[1:35:49] well when I get converted a couple weeks
[1:35:51] later in fact I'll I'll tell you
[1:35:55] I was at a meeting in Bird Rock
[1:35:57] Fellowship in Laya
[1:36:00] California I am still seeking I was
[1:36:03] raised up in California my now my
[1:36:06] parents weren't
[1:36:08] Christians never once we went to church
[1:36:12] together my dad was a jockey and third
[1:36:14] bread Horse Rising Jesus Christ was a
[1:36:17] cussw word I'm going to fast forward to
[1:36:20] a meeting that I went to in Bird Rock
[1:36:23] Fellowship in laa California and sister
[1:36:25] lesie wanted to hear it from my side of
[1:36:28] the perspective because I went there and
[1:36:31] there was a black man preaching and I
[1:36:34] had notes on a piece of paper from the
[1:36:37] surfboard shop that I was working at in
[1:36:41] enenas California or
[1:36:44] lucadia from Sunset surfboards and the
[1:36:47] black Minister said the church will go
[1:36:50] through the
[1:36:51] tribulation Enoch and Methuselah here's
[1:36:53] the dates and everything I wrote down
[1:36:55] all and I thought well I guess so I
[1:36:57] guess so at the end of the service there
[1:36:59] was a man that stood
[1:37:00] up and he said no he said well let me
[1:37:03] just correct something he said the
[1:37:05] church will go through the tribulation
[1:37:07] but not the
[1:37:09] bride he said th thus sayith the Lord
[1:37:12] besides that you're a false prophet you
[1:37:15] know who that man
[1:37:17] was he's sitting in he that Troublemaker
[1:37:21] over here
[1:37:23] this guy over here that's thus sayeth
[1:37:26] the Lord man I tell you this place blew
[1:37:28] up the
[1:37:30] ministers you have to seen it they were
[1:37:33] up on the platform and the host Pastor
[1:37:35] is coming to the to the pulpit to get
[1:37:37] the microphone and he's having no that's
[1:37:39] my PO let stop I'm going to say this of
[1:37:43] all he says as long as it's brought in
[1:37:47] love we can listen to any man's
[1:37:49] doctor yes love love love love
[1:37:54] love what the world needs now right this
[1:37:58] is the Peace Love Jesus movement and so
[1:38:03] everybody oh yes love love so the man's
[1:38:06] they made him sit down but the man stand
[1:38:09] sitting next to him his name was Ron
[1:38:12] McCain and he stood up just as Meek and
[1:38:15] as humble as he could and he said I'd
[1:38:18] like to bring to you the doctrine of
[1:38:20] William Mary and brandham and it was a a
[1:38:23] bigger nuclear
[1:38:26] explosion and they said of all the
[1:38:29] ministers in the
[1:38:32] world we will never allow the doctrine
[1:38:35] of William Mary and brandham be brought
[1:38:37] over this Pulpit or taught no matter if
[1:38:39] it's brought in love or whatever and I
[1:38:41] thought wait just a second you just said
[1:38:43] if it's brought in love we can listen to
[1:38:45] any man but not this man and so I had a
[1:38:48] man sitting next to me I said hey who is
[1:38:50] William brandom he said I don't know
[1:38:54] and I said I'm fixing to find
[1:38:57] out well guess what I get
[1:39:01] converted and within two weeks I go to
[1:39:05] somewhere where we're going to play a
[1:39:06] tape and guess who's
[1:39:09] sitting guess who's sitting in the
[1:39:12] corner of that room the
[1:39:16] Troublemaker the outspoken
[1:39:20] guy that's why I love Brother David
[1:39:24] he's not a
[1:39:30] politician but we came into the message
[1:39:33] together and by God's grace we'll finish
[1:39:38] together
[1:39:40] huh
[1:39:42] now I want you to
[1:39:46] understand that Saul when he was on the
[1:39:49] road to
[1:39:51] Damascus there was an experience that he
[1:39:54] had remember he's he's he is killing
[1:39:57] many of the
[1:39:58] Christians putting them in
[1:40:03] jail and 1 Thessalonians
[1:40:07] 4 verses 15 through
[1:40:10] 18 for this we say unto you by the word
[1:40:13] of the Lord now here's one of those
[1:40:14] times that the word of the Lord
[1:40:17] comes that we which are alive and remain
[1:40:19] unto the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:40:21] prevent them which asleep for the Lord
[1:40:23] himself self shall descend from heaven
[1:40:25] with a shout with the voice of an
[1:40:27] archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:40:29] the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:40:31] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:40:34] shall be caught up together caught up
[1:40:36] together that word harpazo caught
[1:40:38] up let me say this if you're not caught
[1:40:41] up in this message right now you'll not
[1:40:43] be caught up in the
[1:40:45] Rapture harpazo to take with
[1:40:50] Force it's not your will it's his will
[1:40:56] then we shall that are alive and remain
[1:40:58] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:41:00] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:41:02] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:41:04] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[1:41:06] words do you know the the doctrine of
[1:41:09] the Resurrection was not found in the
[1:41:11] Old
[1:41:14] Testament no such thing they didn't have
[1:41:18] it so we picked this up in Romans
[1:41:21] chapter 8
[1:41:23] and we
[1:41:25] see Ro Romans 8 ver8 if you want to
[1:41:28] follow along so then they that are in
[1:41:30] the flesh cannot please
[1:41:33] God but ye are not in the flesh but in
[1:41:36] the spirit if so that the spirit of God
[1:41:40] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[1:41:43] spirit of
[1:41:46] Christ he is none of
[1:41:48] his but if this but if Christ be in you
[1:41:52] somebody say Christ
[1:41:54] if Christ the anointed
[1:41:57] word be in you the Dead the body is dead
[1:42:01] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:42:03] because of righteousness but if the
[1:42:05] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:42:08] the dead dwell in
[1:42:10] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:42:13] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:42:16] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:42:19] you so the word of the Lord is not just
[1:42:22] an
[1:42:23] anointing but the anointing is becoming
[1:42:26] a revelation by way that we call the
[1:42:29] message of the
[1:42:33] hour it becomes a living epistle you
[1:42:36] take the book and eat
[1:42:39] it now
[1:42:43] Saul of Tarsus was on his road to
[1:42:48] Damascus and he has an experience before
[1:42:50] God he's on his horse and he sees a
[1:42:53] bright light brighter than the midday
[1:42:56] Sun knocks him off his
[1:42:58] horse and into the dust where he
[1:43:02] belongs and he says Lord who art thou
[1:43:06] brother Braham said any man knows that
[1:43:08] here is a theologian and he's
[1:43:12] asking because he was a Hebrew of
[1:43:15] Hebrews a Pharisee of
[1:43:18] Pharisees and he says Elohim
[1:43:23] who art
[1:43:25] thou he said I'm
[1:43:28] Jesus whom thou
[1:43:31] persecutest isn't it hard to kick
[1:43:33] against the Pricks and his eyes became
[1:43:38] blinded so now he cannot see sometimes
[1:43:41] God has to Blind you to open your
[1:43:48] eyes and then he Holy Spirit comes to a
[1:43:52] man called Anna
[1:43:53] anas ananas I have called you to go pray
[1:43:57] for Saul of
[1:43:59] Tarsus excuse
[1:44:01] me did I hear that right Saul of Tarsus
[1:44:06] isn't he the same one
[1:44:08] Lord that's been killing Christians and
[1:44:10] putting them yeah yeah that's the one I
[1:44:13] would say it took a a man of great
[1:44:15] Revelation I would have asked the Lord
[1:44:16] several times are you sure I'd have put
[1:44:19] my hearing aids on I would have done
[1:44:20] anything hey are
[1:44:24] come on now let's be
[1:44:26] real could you imagine knocking on
[1:44:28] Saul's
[1:44:32] door is Saul home I hope he's
[1:44:35] not yeah he's here he's waiting for
[1:44:40] you so all God sent me to pray for
[1:44:48] you lays his hands on him and the scales
[1:44:51] come off his eyes
[1:44:54] he started a work in that day by sending
[1:44:59] annias
[1:45:01] ananas to go not to ananas and safire
[1:45:04] another
[1:45:05] man could you imagine if that is a
[1:45:09] pyramid scheme man he just pushed
[1:45:12] himself every convert that Paul got in
[1:45:15] theas went higher you understand that
[1:45:19] thank God that there was a man that
[1:45:20] followed the leadership of God
[1:45:24] the message of the hour is not to stay
[1:45:26] on tapes and
[1:45:28] books otherwise everyone who has a
[1:45:32] library who has the possibility to have
[1:45:36] the tapes to listen to them everyone
[1:45:39] would have the same
[1:45:42] Revelation but it's not the ownership of
[1:45:45] Bibles and of books and of tapes that
[1:45:49] gives you
[1:45:51] Revelation my Road to
[1:45:54] Damascus my pastor Floyd Patterson who
[1:45:57] was the pastor of our church in
[1:45:59] Flagstaff he asked me if I would go to
[1:46:02] Europe and open up at that time spoken
[1:46:06] word do you guys remember some of you
[1:46:07] old-timers remember spoken word
[1:46:10] publication if you had to get
[1:46:12] books is it there anybody here remember
[1:46:15] spoken word okay there's a few of you
[1:46:19] spoken word was Roy borders who printed
[1:46:22] mid millions millions of books and sent
[1:46:26] them all over the
[1:46:28] world and stamped on the inside of that
[1:46:31] says and these books are printed free of
[1:46:33] charge and given to people around and
[1:46:36] they are the
[1:46:37] transliteration directly off the tape if
[1:46:39] brother Brenham stutters and God he said
[1:46:43] and but but uh uh that's what they like
[1:46:46] a stenographer in a court of
[1:46:49] law if he said and Moses built an arc
[1:46:53] and went through the flood you don't
[1:46:54] correct it you just print it because
[1:46:57] it's
[1:46:58] transliteration you understand
[1:47:00] transliteration is not trying to take
[1:47:02] out all of
[1:47:04] the little mistakes in thethethe and and
[1:47:07] verily verily or
[1:47:10] whatever so my pastor when Roy borders
[1:47:13] died took over spoken word
[1:47:15] publication he said brother Ron would
[1:47:17] you be willing to go to Europe and open
[1:47:20] up a spoken word office I said I'd be
[1:47:23] more than happy to Sandy how many names
[1:47:26] were on the spoken word mailing list
[1:47:29] when we went to Europe because now
[1:47:31] Europe how many people in Europe need
[1:47:34] only English books because what they
[1:47:37] speak French
[1:47:40] German
[1:47:41] Italian how many were there
[1:47:44] Sandy
[1:47:47] 43 on the spoken word meiling list
[1:47:51] because why sand in English book to a
[1:47:53] man who speaks
[1:47:57] French
[1:47:59] no no P
[1:48:03] English I don't understand
[1:48:05] English
[1:48:07] so anyway long story short we moved over
[1:48:12] there I was I think 34 years of age I
[1:48:15] think something like what
[1:48:17] was
[1:48:19] 31 just a punk kid 31 can you imagine
[1:48:25] moving your family and your kids over
[1:48:27] into a foreign country you don't speak
[1:48:29] the
[1:48:31] language we went over there
[1:48:34] and we started and started getting the
[1:48:38] books and started Distributing them
[1:48:41] throughout to the pastors the different
[1:48:43] ones that were on the mailing list
[1:48:45] now year and a half later guess what
[1:48:48] Brother Floyd
[1:48:50] gives spoken word publication
[1:48:53] to Joseph
[1:48:55] brandham and they changed the name what
[1:48:57] do they change the name
[1:49:00] to voice of God
[1:49:03] recording okay now you all have heard a
[1:49:05] voice of God recording okay so brother
[1:49:08] Billy Paul and Brother Joseph come over
[1:49:12] and uh they inherit a work that we we're
[1:49:15] already
[1:49:16] doing spoken word publication European
[1:49:20] office so Brother Joseph we knew what
[1:49:22] one another we knew one another by name
[1:49:24] Billy Paul and I we knew one another by
[1:49:26] name but it wasn't a intimate
[1:49:28] relationship I'd only met him several
[1:49:30] times Joe is about a year and a half two
[1:49:32] years younger than I am I'll be 72 in
[1:49:36] December
[1:49:38] so this guy's an older guy than me he's
[1:49:41] going to be 75
[1:49:43] soon anyway we we go over there they
[1:49:46] inherit so Brother Joseph and brother
[1:49:48] Billy Paul come to us and they said
[1:49:50] brother Ron uh would you stay
[1:49:53] on as a representative and we're going
[1:49:56] to change the name to voice of God
[1:49:57] Recordings and we're going to start
[1:49:59] getting the tapes and books out to the
[1:50:01] people here in Europe would you stay
[1:50:03] over for another six months until I can
[1:50:05] get somebody else I said sure sure well
[1:50:07] six months turned into another three and
[1:50:09] a half years and so we worked with voice
[1:50:12] of God to help to start I told Brother
[1:50:16] Joseph at that time if any of you
[1:50:19] remember the printing of the books and
[1:50:22] most of us had a pretty
[1:50:24] good library of
[1:50:27] books and pamphlets of brother Brenham
[1:50:30] that came out from spoken word and we
[1:50:32] put them in our office and at that
[1:50:36] time spoken word had been printing some
[1:50:40] of the Dallas series Topeka series
[1:50:44] shreport series and it's good to have
[1:50:46] those they're they're nice but I Don't
[1:50:48] Preach from most books most of the time
[1:50:51] you preach from the what we call the
[1:50:53] meat sermons the ones from
[1:50:55] Jeffersonville what Christ The Mystery
[1:50:57] of God reveal what is the attraction etc
[1:50:59] etc
[1:51:01] okay so I told Joseph I said Brother
[1:51:04] Joseph these um Brethren over here um
[1:51:08] can you send us conduct order and
[1:51:11] Doctrine no they're there we don't have
[1:51:13] them in print right now uh how about the
[1:51:17] Hebrew series no they're out of print
[1:51:20] right now well what do you have the all
[1:51:23] available book list well we have the the
[1:51:26] Topeka series The Dallas and I said
[1:51:29] Brother Joseph thank God I'm I'm glad
[1:51:31] those books mean something but I said
[1:51:34] the Brethren over here need to get the
[1:51:37] books that they need to be able to
[1:51:39] translate it to the people so the people
[1:51:42] can
[1:51:43] hear the word of God in their
[1:51:47] language and so Brother
[1:51:51] Joseph um he and I I said now I'm going
[1:51:55] to share with you a very
[1:51:58] intimate relationship or discussion that
[1:52:01] I had with Brother
[1:52:05] Joseph and Brother Joseph knows and he
[1:52:09] and Billy Paul's passed away now you all
[1:52:11] know
[1:52:12] that he was there
[1:52:14] also and I told him I said Brother
[1:52:17] Joseph may I ask you a question before I
[1:52:19] go to work for
[1:52:21] you you yes sir brother Ron go ahead how
[1:52:24] do you feel about what your daddy said
[1:52:26] about you are you a
[1:52:29] prophet what do you believe oh brother
[1:52:33] Ron and he rolls his eyes like brother
[1:52:35] Brenham does in in the the film yes
[1:52:38] brother cops I'll be more than happy to
[1:52:41] serve our Lord in Israel and Brother
[1:52:44] Joseph goes oh he said brother Ron if I
[1:52:48] could change my name I would I just want
[1:52:51] to try to get the
[1:52:53] my the Daddy's message out to the
[1:52:56] people and I said so are you a preacher
[1:53:00] no no I'm not a I don't feel to be a
[1:53:03] preacher I said well do you feel
[1:53:06] yourself to be some kind of a prophet
[1:53:07] and he said I don't understand what
[1:53:09] daddy said Now understand I'm going to
[1:53:12] share with you and this can go back to
[1:53:15] you can send it some of you that are
[1:53:17] Joseph Believers send it to Joe he knows
[1:53:19] i' I had this conversation with him
[1:53:21] personally so it won't offend him we
[1:53:23] talked about it I said Brother Joseph
[1:53:25] may I share with you is this okay with
[1:53:28] you guys I said may I share with you how
[1:53:31] I see it I said there's three kinds of
[1:53:34] prophets according to scripture a major
[1:53:37] word
[1:53:38] Prophet
[1:53:40] major there are seven Church ages and
[1:53:42] there are seven
[1:53:44] stars seven Major
[1:53:47] Prophets I said and that prophet's
[1:53:50] already come the major prophet in fact
[1:53:52] in your seven Church age book it's
[1:53:55] blank it doesn't have the name brandom
[1:53:57] under the seventh star that's a fill
[1:54:00] in you put it there so the major prophet
[1:54:04] to this age was
[1:54:07] who William
[1:54:09] brandom then you have Minor Prophets
[1:54:12] brother Bram said Minor Prophets are um
[1:54:16] Ephesians 4 they are the ministry right
[1:54:20] Apostles prophets evangelists pastors St
[1:54:22] preachers right and he says we all know
[1:54:25] that a preacher is a new testament
[1:54:28] Prophet because when he speaks he
[1:54:31] prophesies propo one whom the word of
[1:54:34] the Lord comes
[1:54:37] to and I said and then the third
[1:54:39] position is there are prophets liken
[1:54:42] unto
[1:54:43] agabus and agabus in the book of Acts
[1:54:46] prophesies two
[1:54:48] times now brother Brenham said there are
[1:54:51] men like a un agabus who can and will
[1:54:55] prophesy and he said agabus prophesied
[1:54:58] about Paul he who takes this girdle
[1:55:00] shall be bound in Jerusalem you know the
[1:55:03] prophecy and another was a famine in the
[1:55:05] land he prophesied a Dar the scriptures
[1:55:09] said he said God can operate that gift
[1:55:12] one or two times and never use it again
[1:55:15] but he's still a prophet you understand
[1:55:17] that's a
[1:55:18] gift as a
[1:55:20] prophet so
[1:55:23] I said but Brother Joseph I said
[1:55:26] look I
[1:55:28] said instead of you sending all of the
[1:55:31] tapes over to
[1:55:33] me why don't we get a a duplicator do
[1:55:36] you remember the old duplicators where
[1:55:38] you have the master and the four
[1:55:41] slaves and you could duplicate a C90 in
[1:55:44] about five minutes put the master in put
[1:55:48] the empty
[1:55:50] blanks and they would hit and then they
[1:55:54] record and man you could just so instead
[1:55:57] of sending all of the tapes coming from
[1:56:01] Jeffersonville let me I'm your
[1:56:03] representative it's still a voice of God
[1:56:06] production let me do the tapes here he
[1:56:09] said no no they're they're not anointed
[1:56:11] if they're not made in
[1:56:13] Jeffersonville I said excuse me excuse
[1:56:16] me yeah they're not anointed unless
[1:56:20] they're from Jeffersonville so what I
[1:56:22] did this is the real truth I had a
[1:56:25] cassette from Harold
[1:56:27] hilderbrandt end time message Tabernacle
[1:56:30] from up there in
[1:56:32] Edmonton a tape duplicated brother Ram
[1:56:35] sermon I took a voice of
[1:56:38] godan I took them behind my back Billy
[1:56:40] Paul and Joseph are in my
[1:56:43] office and I put one of them in and I
[1:56:46] said now tell me which one is
[1:56:49] Anointed I said you're spiritual
[1:56:53] which one's anointed he said well that's
[1:56:56] not fair I said' wait a second you just
[1:56:59] told me one's anointed one's not he said
[1:57:03] well actually brother Ron the anointing
[1:57:04] is on The
[1:57:05] Voice I said you got that right not on
[1:57:09] who duplicates
[1:57:12] it not where it comes
[1:57:16] from now when brother brandom talks
[1:57:18] about a copyright he means copy it
[1:57:21] right don't do like they did in Arizona
[1:57:23] and cood he said there's some in Arizona
[1:57:26] that are cutting and splicing and making
[1:57:27] me say some
[1:57:29] no copy it right that's that's a
[1:57:34] Kentucky understanding copy it right he
[1:57:36] didn't understand all this
[1:57:39] legal stuff that it you know you have to
[1:57:42] have a copyright and all this and do you
[1:57:44] remember the here I
[1:57:47] stand you remember the picture with
[1:57:49] Joseph
[1:57:52] here I
[1:57:56] stand well pretty soon saints of God the
[1:58:01] message began to become
[1:58:03] polarized the people listen to tapes and
[1:58:06] people that hear
[1:58:09] preachers and it become to become
[1:58:12] polarized and it's getting
[1:58:15] worse I want to ask
[1:58:17] you brother renam
[1:58:20] said the final voice to the final
[1:58:25] age is not Revelations
[1:58:31] 10:7 he said the final voice to the
[1:58:33] final age will be the bride of Christ
[1:58:35] and they under their
[1:58:39] messenger saying what he said what's
[1:58:42] amazing is Brother David and I so much
[1:58:45] of the time years ago different ones
[1:58:48] were telling us say only what he said
[1:58:50] but they never said what he said
[1:58:53] but we got it drilled in our hearts say
[1:58:55] only what he said on tape praise God so
[1:58:58] now do you guys remember' Neil haliva
[1:59:00] with ego
[1:59:02] Computing man I tell you what this is a
[1:59:05] history lesson also well Neil haliva got
[1:59:09] the first uh all of the tapes and books
[1:59:12] put onto uh a computer and you could go
[1:59:15] and get uh folio views do you remember
[1:59:19] that that was the computer applic folio
[1:59:24] views and now you could type in with
[1:59:27] your old computer and you could take a
[1:59:30] computer and you type in the love of
[1:59:33] God parentheses
[1:59:36] and and that old computer it take 30 to
[1:59:39] 40 minutes for it to come up with all of
[1:59:41] the quotes because it's
[1:59:43] thinking and then if you had to print it
[1:59:45] out it it take
[1:59:47] forever now you can have it on your cell
[1:59:50] phone you can fact check me you can fact
[1:59:54] check anyone and you can see whether or
[1:59:56] not the prophet of God said
[1:59:58] it
[2:00:01] now I said those things in sharing an
[2:00:05] intimate detail with
[2:00:08] you I worked for them for five years in
[2:00:13] Europe finally in 1989 November of ' 89
[2:00:16] we left Europe to come back to
[2:00:20] America because the voice of God had
[2:00:23] spoke to me when I say the voice of God
[2:00:26] I I had God deal with
[2:00:30] me and told me to go to Arizona to start
[2:00:33] a church go to
[2:00:35] Phoenix because I would have never chose
[2:00:39] Phoenix I would have
[2:00:41] chose
[2:00:44] Hawaii French
[2:00:46] poesia
[2:00:48] Tahiti Bora Bora some South Pacific
[2:00:52] Island cuz I'm a surfer born on the
[2:00:54] beach and thought you know I remember
[2:00:56] the first time we heard of a brother in
[2:00:59] Hawaii a pastor had a church in Hawaii
[2:01:01] do you guys remember that there was a
[2:01:03] pastor yeah we were at the meetings the
[2:01:06] December
[2:01:07] meetings um of
[2:01:11] 1972 and there was a brother his name
[2:01:13] was Lonnie Jenkins you guys remember
[2:01:15] brother
[2:01:16] Lonnie yeah he got up and introduced
[2:01:19] himself well he said well God bless you
[2:01:21] I'm I'm from Hawaii and my brother and I
[2:01:25] and Mitch Buckingham good friend of ours
[2:01:27] we came in the message together all of a
[2:01:29] sudden we all three got the Epiphany
[2:01:31] same
[2:01:32] time that's our
[2:01:36] pastor I can believe the message and go
[2:01:39] surfing Sunday
[2:01:42] afternoon so we went and talked to
[2:01:44] brother Lonnie after service he said
[2:01:46] sorry brother and he said uh I'm moving
[2:01:48] I'm moving to tuon
[2:01:58] the Bible says and let me finish with
[2:02:00] coming back to our thought the Christ of
[2:02:04] God because Galatians 2 and2 says
[2:02:08] this I am crucified with
[2:02:11] Christ nevertheless I
[2:02:14] live yet not
[2:02:17] I but Christ liveth in
[2:02:20] me and the life which I now live in the
[2:02:23] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[2:02:26] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[2:02:30] Galatians
[2:02:32] 4:19 my little
[2:02:35] children of whom I travail in
[2:02:41] birth again until
[2:02:44] Christ be formed in
[2:02:47] you birth
[2:02:50] pains I'm not not wanting to birth a
[2:02:53] Doctrine a
[2:02:55] Creed a
[2:02:57] denomination I
[2:03:00] travail with birth pains brother Brenham
[2:03:04] I
[2:03:06] travail that you might be birthed in
[2:03:10] Christ sir we would see Jesus as I'm
[2:03:14] bringing this to a
[2:03:20] close 19
[2:03:23] 64 paragraph 29 why would you condemn me
[2:03:26] when I say I am the Son of
[2:03:28] God when you call those who the word
[2:03:31] came to
[2:03:34] Gods Abraham was considered a
[2:03:38] god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God
[2:03:44] because the word of God came to them and
[2:03:48] they were in portion Gods Jesus said
[2:03:51] said they were he said you call them
[2:03:55] Gods paragraph 30 now you see when the
[2:03:59] man was anointed like Joseph he
[2:04:01] portrayed Christ when Moses was
[2:04:05] anointed he portrayed Christ when David
[2:04:09] was anointed he portrayed Christ all
[2:04:12] leading up to Christ and he was the
[2:04:15] fullness of the
[2:04:16] word the word was made manifest in him
[2:04:19] and he was the complete anointed Ed one
[2:04:22] who had it by
[2:04:25] portions we have it by
[2:04:28] portions he was the anointed one the
[2:04:32] entire plan of God was laid in
[2:04:37] him in a sermon
[2:04:41] perseverant
[2:04:43] 1964 paragraph
[2:04:46] 64 he is here tonight to vindicate to
[2:04:50] reveal every promise that God made for
[2:04:52] this age he's here to do it he was in
[2:04:57] the days of the prophets he was in Moses
[2:04:59] he was in David he was in
[2:05:01] Elijah he was the in the rest of them to
[2:05:05] reveal God's promise of that age God
[2:05:08] laed his word to each age and he sends a
[2:05:11] prophet and the word goes to the prophet
[2:05:13] and straightens it out and that's
[2:05:15] exactly what he's done through all the
[2:05:18] ages and he is God and changes not Jesus
[2:05:21] Christ Christ is the prophet tonight
[2:05:24] that stands Among
[2:05:25] Us he is the one here in the form of the
[2:05:28] Holy Ghost who knows everything and can
[2:05:31] reveal everything that he desires to
[2:05:35] do
[2:05:38] now let me musicians if you want to come
[2:05:41] I just trying to bring this place to a
[2:05:43] close I didn't really mean to Rabbit
[2:05:46] Trail and go off about voice of God
[2:05:49] those are very
[2:05:53] intimate conversations that I've
[2:05:57] had with Brother Joseph and brother
[2:06:00] Billy
[2:06:02] Paul I miss brother Billy
[2:06:06] Paul of all the men on the face of the
[2:06:09] Earth that was with and witnessed and
[2:06:12] saw
[2:06:13] more of the Holy Spirit and of God's
[2:06:17] Prophet preaching and saw more miracles
[2:06:19] and witnessed more things of the
[2:06:22] prophet's Ministry is now
[2:06:25] gone used to be that I could write him a
[2:06:28] letter Hey Brother
[2:06:30] Billy what was it like what what this
[2:06:33] and I'd ask him a question he'd turn
[2:06:35] around and send it to
[2:06:40] me were any of you in the meetings of
[2:06:43] brother brandham any of you here or
[2:06:45] where any of you
[2:06:48] ever saw
[2:06:52] so that means that most of us are not
[2:06:54] first generation we weren't
[2:06:57] there we didn't see
[2:07:00] it I didn't see it I didn't come in
[2:07:02] until
[2:07:03] 1971 I'm born out of due
[2:07:07] season but greater is he who has not
[2:07:10] seen and yet
[2:07:13] believed little did your pastor and I
[2:07:18] realized that when we all of a sudden
[2:07:20] got these tapes
[2:07:24] and we heard this
[2:07:27] voice come out from her my people be
[2:07:31] separate
[2:07:34] my you long-haired
[2:07:36] Ricky here we all had long
[2:07:42] hair I remember when I cut my hair I had
[2:07:45] shoulder length hair and so when I cut
[2:07:47] it I kind of had a beetle
[2:07:50] haircut and I thought I'd done God a
[2:07:52] great service I come late to the tape
[2:07:55] service then and come in and I came in I
[2:07:58] shook everybody's hand as we as the tape
[2:08:00] was going on but I came in a little bit
[2:08:02] late so I was shaking God bless you God
[2:08:04] bless you like that and I'm kind of
[2:08:05] brushing my hair nobody said anything
[2:08:09] nobody nobody said a thing and I I
[2:08:12] finally was so bold enough I went over
[2:08:14] and turned off the tape I said is nobody
[2:08:17] going to congratulate me because I cut
[2:08:19] my hair
[2:08:21] you know what they said no we expected
[2:08:24] that now shut up and turn on tape back
[2:08:30] on see a lot of times we think we do God
[2:08:33] a great service no that's your
[2:08:36] reasonable
[2:08:39] service been serving the lord in this
[2:08:41] message now since
[2:08:43] 1971 I've seen a lot of people come and
[2:08:48] go I've seen a lot of directions this
[2:08:51] and that different anointings
[2:08:53] come and it's all for a
[2:08:57] purpose but I thank God that he's kept
[2:09:00] me right in the middle of the
[2:09:01] road I haven't gone off to this and I
[2:09:04] haven't gone off to that but I've stayed
[2:09:06] right here
[2:09:08] and I've tried to stay with just the
[2:09:11] simple
[2:09:12] message but I know
[2:09:15] this that we're not following just the
[2:09:20] prophet we're following the Pillar of
[2:09:23] Fire which is the anointing
[2:09:26] hallu you understand that he said that
[2:09:30] anointing watch that logos thought that
[2:09:32] was with there the children of Israel
[2:09:35] they were not following
[2:09:37] Moses they were following Moses because
[2:09:40] Moses followed the pillar of
[2:09:44] fire so even Pharaoh said what kind of a
[2:09:48] leader would lead his people up to the
[2:09:51] Red Sea and mountains on both sides so
[2:09:53] that we could kill them all what kind of
[2:09:56] a great leader is that and there was
[2:09:59] Moses in a quandry till God said take
[2:10:02] your
[2:10:04] staff you've all seen it in the Ten
[2:10:07] Commandments
[2:10:09] amazing he takes his staff and he stand
[2:10:13] still and see the glory of
[2:10:16] God he Parts the
[2:10:19] waters they go overr you all know the
[2:10:24] story well you know who they were
[2:10:26] following because the pillar of fire
[2:10:27] went before
[2:10:29] them you know who we're following even
[2:10:31] today go ahead and play something softly
[2:10:34] sisters whatever is good for you
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:58] I believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[2:11:00] yesterday today and
[2:11:02] forever he changes
[2:11:05] not the same God that was with the
[2:11:08] children coming out of Egypt is the same
[2:11:11] God that we saw the same Pillar of
[2:11:14] Fire the same
[2:11:16] Works how many believe we are in another
[2:11:19] Exodus
[2:11:21] we
[2:11:22] are and John was told to come up
[2:11:26] hither Book of
[2:11:28] Revelation chapter
[2:11:30] 3 and I John was in the spirit on the

[2:12:33] okay that's
[2:12:35] okay I know
[2:12:37] [Music]
[2:12:39] this so
[2:12:41] I I told my
[2:12:43] girlfriend remember she cut me off
[2:12:46] because I wasn't and any any good
[2:12:48] Christian girl you young Christian girls
[2:12:51] if you start liking some boy and then he
[2:12:53] does something wrong and he goes into
[2:12:55] the world you cut it
[2:12:57] off tell him get lost adios
[2:13:03] Amigo
[2:13:05] right and she told me
[2:13:09] that but the first one I wanted to call
[2:13:12] when I came into the message I called
[2:13:13] Sandy I said hey Sandy come on over I
[2:13:17] said I believe we found a prophet I'm a
[2:13:20] Christian I've gotten
[2:13:22] baptized she didn't hear anything about
[2:13:24] a prophet or anything she just wondering
[2:13:26] what happened to
[2:13:27] [Music]
[2:13:29] Ron we come to listen to a tape that
[2:13:32] night she flew over from Phoenix to San
[2:13:35] Diego I picked her up at the airport we
[2:13:38] went to listen to a tape we turned the
[2:13:41] tape
[2:13:44] on good evening
[2:13:46] friends and I'm praying oh God open her
[2:13:50] eyes to see what I've
[2:13:52] seen and by the end of the
[2:13:55] table nobody told her about the way she
[2:13:58] was dressed nobody said anything nobody
[2:14:01] said anything about makeup and
[2:14:03] fingernails and all of
[2:14:05] that but from that day
[2:14:09] forward
[2:14:11] Sandy had a revelation that God sent a
[2:14:17] prophet and I'm very very pleased
[2:14:21] that she is my
[2:14:24] wife have we ever had arguments H not
[2:14:28] really
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:33] arguments we've had some severe
[2:14:35] fellowship
[2:14:38] before never thought about
[2:14:41] divorce maybe murder but not
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:46] divorce because you know if we're honest
[2:14:49] with one another that you know what yeah
[2:14:52] she's a woman I'm a man she sees it one
[2:14:54] way I see it another but I've never had
[2:14:57] to tell
[2:14:58] her to go take that dress off take those
[2:15:02] high heels off take this and that and
[2:15:05] people say well brother Ron I know why
[2:15:07] she wears flat shoes cuz she's 2 and a
[2:15:10] half inches taller than
[2:15:14] you no wrong
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:22] n and I'm I'm thankful that God opened
[2:15:27] her
[2:15:29] eyes because when you see my
[2:15:33] wife you see me when you see a
[2:15:36] reflection of her because if I preach to
[2:15:38] you one thing and she looks like a
[2:15:41] jezebel something
[2:15:44] wrong that
[2:15:46] right so I love to take my wife with me
[2:15:51] I've been to many countries and I love
[2:15:53] to take my wife because she stands there
[2:15:55] as a standard they look at
[2:15:58] it and
[2:16:00] so God bless you all thank
[2:16:04] you it's a pleasure to be here with
[2:16:08] you I shared with you some
[2:16:11] things from my heart tonight that I
[2:16:14] don't really share a lot of
[2:16:17] places so maybe you can hold the tape

[2:16:26] could how many of you know that brother
[2:16:28] brand had a he had a switch on the side
[2:16:31] of the the pulpit in the Tabernacle you
[2:16:34] ever seen the thing it says on Blank
[2:16:36] Spot on

[2:16:41] that he could turn off the main tape
[2:16:45] recorders Blank Spot on tape let me tell

[2:16:55] fine
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:05] brother we didn't even know brother
[2:17:08] brenham's
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:13] name we thought his name was Jeff from
[2:17:17] Indiana because that's what was on the
[2:17:19] end of the tape
[2:17:21] the Box the real toore Jeff from
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:29] Indiana well Brother David we came into
[2:17:31] this
[2:17:33] thing we started listening and
[2:17:37] [Music]
[2:17:42] man just a bunch of
[2:17:45] kids didn't know nothing
[2:17:49] [Music]
[2:17:51] one thing we had was a desire to serve
[2:17:56] him to follow
[2:17:59] Christ took us out of California David
[2:18:01] went up into
[2:18:03] Montana we went up into
[2:18:06] [Music]
[2:18:08] Oregon who would have ever thought that
[2:18:10] God had take a hippie like you and take
[2:18:12] him out of San Diego and put you right
[2:18:14] down here in Dallas Fort
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:18] Worth Whoever thought that God would
[2:18:21] take a surfer like me and put him in a
[2:18:24] desert like Phoenix God must have a
[2:18:27] sense of
[2:18:30] humor because if he' to sent me to
[2:18:32] French
[2:18:34] Polynesia I probably would have been a
[2:18:37] little bit loot like a
[2:18:39] lot you know yeah do you know that when
[2:18:43] you were given your choice in
[2:18:48] scripture if you're given a
[2:18:52] choice if you're not careful you're not
[2:18:54] spiritual you'll choose the wrong
[2:18:57] thing I'll choose the greener
[2:19:00] pastures I'll lean towards a better job
[2:19:04] a better place many people will change
[2:19:06] their church now and go somewhere where
[2:19:09] there's not even a church because they
[2:19:12] got a better
[2:19:14] job oh
[2:19:16] really when this is this is going home
[2:19:20] time
[2:19:21] this is when the whole cresendo is
[2:19:23] coming
[2:19:25] hey this election coming
[2:19:29] up you see the the left
[2:19:33] liberals how do these
[2:19:37] people how did this
[2:19:40] happen we might have a woman president I
[2:19:44] don't know I don't really care all I say
[2:19:48] is let me tell you this thing's fixing
[2:19:50] to real really start crumbling real
[2:19:52] quick and it's the prophet's fault cuz
[2:19:55] he preached a sermon called the falling
[2:19:57] apart of the world it's falling apart
[2:20:02] Israel
[2:20:05] anti-Semitism brother Ram said watch
[2:20:07] those same
[2:20:09] Spirits pre-tribulation Spirits Hitler
[2:20:12] musolini ikan pre-tribulation Spirits he
[2:20:17] said we're loosed against the Jews
[2:20:21] and he said those same Spirits are
[2:20:23] coming now and guess what they're going
[2:20:25] to come after the Christians and the
[2:20:26] Jews what's going to happen to the
[2:20:30] 144,000 they're going to get martyred
[2:20:32] what's going to happen to the foolish
[2:20:34] virgin that's left here they're
[2:20:40] martyred wouldn't you rather give your
[2:20:42] life to Christ now would you rather be
[2:20:45] judged now than be
[2:20:49] foolish because the fully said well my
[2:20:51] Lord delays his
[2:20:53] coming they don't get serious and they
[2:20:55] don't catch the Holy
[2:20:57] Spirit to seal them to the day of their
[2:21:01] Redemption oh if you don't have the Holy
[2:21:03] Spirit don't be caught dead without

[2:24:28] years and now here we are and you guys
[2:24:30] are picking
[2:24:31] Revelations that took us hours and hours
[2:24:34] and years and years to come to but the
[2:24:38] Harvest is full
[2:24:39] now and you should be thankful that you
[2:24:42] born in the time that you're born in you

[2:26:13] evening on your heart if you you have
[2:26:16] something on your heart
[2:26:21] I I believe it it's so
[2:26:29] wonderful that our messenger spent so
[2:26:32] much
[2:26:33] time wanting us to come to the great
[2:26:36] truth that he's the
[2:26:39] same yesterday today and
[2:26:42] forever and he said all that God
[2:26:46] was he poured into
[2:26:49] Christ and all that Christ was he poured
[2:26:53] into the
[2:26:56] church that we can be that Shining Light
[2:27:00] and no man lith a candle and put it
[2:27:03] under a bushel basket but he Seth on a
[2:27:05] hill that it might shine that others
[2:27:08] might be able to
[2:27:10] [Music]
[2:27:12] see and let us pray in our heart in this
[2:27:15] great hour as the great last days of the
[2:27:19] heart harvest the the day of the 11th
[2:27:23] Hour
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:25] worker that we'll let our light
[2:27:28] shine that our good works might glorify
[2:27:32] Our Father in Heaven because the last
[2:27:35] voice to this day as our brother brought
[2:27:37] out is the
[2:27:38] bride the testimony of their
[2:27:42] life the testimony of their
[2:27:45] dress the testimony of their M mouths
[2:27:49] the conf confessions of the Living God
[2:27:52] working in their
[2:27:55] lives the testimony of the great things
[2:27:59] that the Lord Jesus is doing for them
[2:28:03] and by them will be the gospel to this
[2:28:07] last GI
[2:28:08] generation another book of Acts living
[2:28:11] out in these last hour workers father
[2:28:15] that's my prayer for the church Lord
[2:28:18] that we would go forward and and what
[2:28:20] lies before us father that we would go
[2:28:23] forward with the revelations that you
[2:28:26] want to share with us and father we're
[2:28:29] built on the shoulders of those that
[2:28:31] have gone before us and we appreciate
[2:28:35] every one of
[2:28:36] them but father we've been called for
[2:28:39] this day and may we live the day that
[2:28:44] we're in with the
[2:28:45] fullness of all that we have within us
[2:28:50] you're a God that deserves all of what
[2:28:53] we have to give and we just ask that you
[2:28:57] [Music]
[2:28:59] would allow us to reconsecrate our
[2:29:03] lives to the
[2:29:07] reality that this message is the only
[2:29:10] way of Escape it's the only pathway out
[2:29:14] of here it's the only truth that will
[2:29:18] set us free father I just pray that that
[2:29:22] each of us would come to the realization
[2:29:26] of our own personal
[2:29:28] lives our own personal condition and our
[2:29:33] own personal
[2:29:34] surroundings and that we would just
[2:29:37] examine ourselves and say father is the
[2:29:40] word of God in my
[2:29:42] life and if it's not there the grace and
[2:29:46] mercy of God will allow it to enter in
[2:29:49] open your heart and let all that he is
[2:29:53] come into your life we ask it in jesus'
[2:29:56] name
