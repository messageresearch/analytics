[38:23] stronger i don't know how that's going
[38:25] to work out but we'll see
[38:27] let's open our bibles in numbers chapter
[38:29] 13.
[38:30] we have a little thought in our hearts
[38:32] and
[38:32] like to share
[38:34] i was watching service on sunday i
[38:36] certainly enjoyed
[38:38] what brother matthew had to bring and it
[38:39] certainly just inspired my heart amen
[38:43] numbers chapter 13
[38:45] let's start from verse 17. it's a very
[38:47] familiar scripture reading
[38:49] about the children of israel
[38:52] getting ready
[38:53] at the door of the promised land they've
[38:56] left egypt and now they are
[38:58] just getting ready to get in the
[39:00] promised land amen how many believe we
[39:02] are in the promised land
[39:04] we are here and there's a lot of promise
[39:06] that's been made there's a lot of things
[39:09] that the messenger spoke that we're
[39:10] going to do there's a lot of things that
[39:12] we desire to see and all of those is
[39:16] part of our inheritance and therefore we
[39:18] just need to know what they are and
[39:20] claim them so we can have it amen let's
[39:22] start from 17 it says and moses sent
[39:25] them up to spy
[39:27] out of the land of canaan and said unto
[39:30] them go up
[39:32] go up this way
[39:34] southward and go up into the mountain
[39:37] and see that land what it is
[39:41] what the people that dwell in therein
[39:43] whether they are strong or weak
[39:46] few or many now i want you to pay
[39:48] attention to the instructions is giving
[39:50] them of what they should when they go to
[39:53] the land what they should be watching
[39:54] for
[39:55] and he says what the land is
[39:58] and and what the land is that they dwell
[40:01] in whether it be a good or bad
[40:04] and what city they
[40:06] what city they be that they dwell in
[40:09] whether intense or stronghold
[40:12] and it says in 20 says
[40:15] and what the land is whether it be fat
[40:17] or lean whether it be word therein or
[40:21] not
[40:21] oh well and and be a good courage and
[40:25] bring off the fruits of the land now it
[40:28] says the time was
[40:30] the time was at the time of the
[40:33] the first uh rip grape
[40:36] it says
[40:37] so they went up and searched the land
[40:40] from the wilderness of zine unto rehab
[40:44] and the men came
[40:46] to hamad
[40:48] and they ascended up to the south by the
[40:50] south and came down
[40:52] unto hebron and came unto hebron and
[40:55] were in uh amen and and sheshai
[40:59] and taume and the children of anakwar
[41:03] and it says now hebron was built
[41:06] seven
[41:08] seven years before
[41:10] zeon in egypt
[41:12] and
[41:12] they came up
[41:14] they came unto the brook of
[41:17] iskoff
[41:19] and cut down
[41:21] from hence a branch with a cluster of
[41:24] grape and they're buried between two
[41:27] upon
[41:28] a staff
[41:30] now think about this think about the
[41:31] size of this grape never seen before
[41:34] and it and they brought it off the
[41:37] pomegranate and of the fig and they
[41:39] played and they were and the place was
[41:41] called the brook is called
[41:44] because the cluster of grape which the
[41:47] children of israel cut down went forth
[41:49] and then let's jump over to 30 and it
[41:51] says i took 29 it says
[41:56] i'm sorry let me not jump because i
[41:58] needed to read let's read 27
[42:01] 28 and 30 29 and 30 says and they told
[42:04] him and said he came upon the land where
[42:07] with us sending us
[42:08] and and survey it
[42:11] flowed with milk and honey and and this
[42:13] is the fruit of it now they actually
[42:16] testifying of what they saw in the land
[42:19] and it says nevertheless the people be
[42:21] strong that dwell in the land and the
[42:23] city is walled and what and very great
[42:26] and moreover we saw the children of anak
[42:29] there and the amalekites dwell in the
[42:32] land of the south and the hate sites and
[42:34] the jebusites and the
[42:36] amorites that dwell in the mountain and
[42:38] the canaanites dwelling by the sea
[42:41] and by the coast of jordan and caleb
[42:44] stealed the people
[42:46] and and before moses and said let us go
[42:49] up and once
[42:50] and possess it for we are
[42:53] able to overcome it and i bet the lord
[42:56] had the blessing to the reading of the
[42:58] word i just want to speak for a little
[43:00] bit you may have your seats on we are
[43:02] more than able to overcome it
[43:05] now if i continue on 31 and it says and
[43:07] the men that went up with him said
[43:11] we be not able to go up against the
[43:14] people for they are strong stronger than
[43:17] we
[43:18] and they brought up an evil report on
[43:20] the land which they were they had
[43:22] searched
[43:23] unto the children of israel saying the
[43:25] land
[43:27] it says
[43:28] through
[43:29] which we have gone to search it is the
[43:32] land that eated up people
[43:35] that eat it at the inhabitants thereof
[43:37] and and the people that we saw
[43:40] they're in there uh the man of great
[43:43] stature
[43:44] and there
[43:46] we saw the giants the son of anak which
[43:49] came of the giants
[43:51] and we were and he says and we were in
[43:54] our own site as grasshopper and we were
[43:58] as so we were in the site now
[44:01] it's amazing
[44:03] when you read the story and
[44:05] it seems like the more you read it to
[44:07] more insight it's one of those stories
[44:10] in the bible where you read
[44:12] and i'll say perhaps the entire bible
[44:15] every time you read it seems like the
[44:17] lord bring more insight and more insight
[44:20] to us as we walk in this world because
[44:22] we we see the children of israel and
[44:25] where they were we could certainly
[44:26] identify with our own selves being uh in
[44:29] the promised land and trying to conquer
[44:31] the promises that they've been given to
[44:33] us
[44:34] now you you you ask yourself a question
[44:37] how can somebody come in this state
[44:40] now just couple of years ago
[44:42] these people were in egypt and and they
[44:45] can tell you
[44:46] before they got out of egypt that god
[44:48] promised them and they stood them up
[44:50] before
[44:51] all the people and he told moses he said
[44:53] that i want you to remember this day
[44:56] what's about to happen why because god
[44:58] with his mighty hand was getting ready
[45:00] to bring them out of egypt and if you
[45:03] the scripture says and the lord brought
[45:05] them up forth this is in deuteronomy 26
[45:08] and 8 and it says and the lord brought
[45:10] us
[45:11] brought us forth out of egypt with the
[45:13] mighty hand and with an outstretched arm
[45:17] with great
[45:19] terribleness and with signs and wonders
[45:22] now these are not a people that have
[45:24] never seen the supernatural this is not
[45:27] a people that were not acquainted with
[45:28] the supernatural where you said well
[45:30] they just came out and they were fresh
[45:33] you know from egypt they didn't know
[45:35] anything about god they lost everything
[45:37] that they knew about god and this is the
[45:40] first obstacle so obviously you can cut
[45:42] them some slack and see that they were
[45:45] really afraid of what they was looking
[45:47] at but these are a people that if the
[45:49] story was to be told it could never be
[45:52] contained at all that they had seen on
[45:55] the way to the promised land
[45:56] we see how that god opened up the red
[45:59] sea how he came he hardened the heart of
[46:02] pharaoh the scripture says that he did
[46:04] it so he may show his might
[46:06] god was intended for his people to know
[46:09] him god is always intended for his
[46:12] people to know him he's not intended for
[46:14] us to go in the book and read some books
[46:16] and come up with some knowledge or some
[46:19] past history of what he has done and
[46:21] come here and say oh you know the god of
[46:23] isaac and jacob and the god of israel
[46:26] and the god the same god the same thing
[46:28] he did if you go out in the history of
[46:30] the bible everyone that ever walked with
[46:33] god god made himself known to them
[46:36] personally because what he wanted them
[46:39] to do was to establish your personal
[46:41] relationship with him so that when they
[46:43] encounter in obstacles that there will
[46:46] not be a people that will run away or be
[46:48] a people that will be intimidated but
[46:50] they'll be remembered that there will be
[46:52] a people that will be reminded every
[46:54] time that the god who walked with my
[46:56] father the god who brought us out of the
[46:58] land of egypt the god who took my father
[47:01] out of egypt and he crossed the red sea
[47:03] and he done many signs and wonders that
[47:06] same god is our god
[47:09] israel were regarded because of those
[47:11] things because they knew that the god of
[47:14] israel was the greatest god that there
[47:16] was and and his testimony went all over
[47:19] the world because they knew what kind of
[47:21] god it was so you can think about the
[47:23] supernatural that happened i began to
[47:25] think about yeah there were brought up
[47:27] two millions come out of egypt and they
[47:30] were to come and and when they crossed
[47:32] the red scene none of them was running
[47:34] even as we read we find out that they
[47:37] didn't say although take off and whoever
[47:39] comes up before the water can fall then
[47:41] you made it no they walked one by one
[47:44] one by one coming up with the egypt
[47:46] tommy coming in the back god taking care
[47:49] of whatever the situation was god
[47:52] opening up the red sea and bringing up
[47:54] whatever there was so that they can
[47:56] cross and he can come and close it back
[47:58] out there was not one in the myth that
[48:01] was dead that god was going to leave
[48:03] behind in fact when moses was speaking
[48:06] to that man they said well why don't you
[48:07] take half and then just take the men you
[48:10] go out and pray in the world and ask why
[48:12] would you take the children and the
[48:13] women why don't you leave them behind
[48:15] well why don't you leave your cattle why
[48:17] don't you leave this all the proposition
[48:19] that pharaoh made him he came back and
[48:21] said we are not leaving one behind the
[48:24] promise was made to the nation of israel
[48:27] and there was not one that was going to
[48:29] be left behind my brother my sister we
[48:31] need to have that same mentality when
[48:34] you see someone fall by the wayside
[48:36] don't just say well he must not have
[48:37] been a believer or well that's there so
[48:40] my god
[48:41] it was not strong enough it was not weak
[48:43] enough it was not this it was not that
[48:45] you have to be have the same mentality
[48:48] that this god had which was there's not
[48:50] gonna be one left behind i don't care
[48:53] how far off it goes we're gonna follow
[48:55] him and unless god reveal his will we
[48:58] are in the business of saving we are in
[49:01] the business of redeeming we are in the
[49:03] business of bringing everybody together
[49:07] so here it is you think about the eating
[49:10] and the drinking oh you think we have
[49:13] supply chain issues today you think
[49:15] about well to feed two millions people
[49:18] i i laid out a cross and to distribute
[49:21] food and and to make sure that everyone
[49:24] had eaten and to take care of the sick
[49:26] and to take care of whatever if one hit
[49:29] against the stone the scripture says
[49:31] there was not one feeble person in the
[49:33] midst
[49:35] think about that logistics oh i tell you
[49:37] our god is the greatest logistician
[49:39] there is on the first of the earth yeah
[49:42] it's just a little thing and people are
[49:43] struggling oh we can't buy this we can't
[49:46] get this this can we can't find this we
[49:48] can't order this it can't come fast
[49:49] enough this is what maine's economy will
[49:52] always fall but god can do it without a
[49:55] car without a bus without an airplane
[49:57] without anything why he is a mighty god
[50:02] oh if we can be inspired by the story we
[50:05] read in the bible we can get to the
[50:07] place where we understand that that same
[50:09] god is the god today
[50:11] he hasn't lost that ability but he can
[50:13] do the same for us today
[50:16] you think about the scripture how he
[50:18] spent their clothes didn't get old
[50:22] two million people walking on the way to
[50:24] the promised land you think about the
[50:26] sandals you think about the dust that
[50:29] will come up and just walking and just
[50:31] walking not running just walking and
[50:34] walking god took care of all of that
[50:37] he
[50:37] he came and he provided manner whatever
[50:40] they needed to eat they never went
[50:42] hungry he provided everything
[50:44] and these are the people that are
[50:46] standing at the door of the promised
[50:49] land
[50:51] now i want you to think about this
[50:52] because you think about how they look at
[50:55] the promised land now they go in
[50:58] they quickly forget about egypt they
[51:01] quickly forget about all the things that
[51:02] happen they quickly forget about all the
[51:05] things that god had done and they go
[51:07] back and the report that they bring is
[51:10] the land is good so obviously the
[51:12] promise was good uh
[51:14] there's the grapes that it took two
[51:16] people to carry there is the land
[51:18] falling uh flowing with milk and honey
[51:21] this is the promise is true but
[51:23] nevertheless we cannot come overcome
[51:26] those people the question i have is
[51:29] since when it was about them overcoming
[51:31] the people
[51:34] they didn't have to do it in egypt they
[51:37] didn't have to do it on the way to the
[51:38] promised land they didn't have to do it
[51:41] anywhere since when the promise changed
[51:43] to where god said it's no longer me it's
[51:46] you
[51:47] and i want to say this that is the
[51:50] source of unbelief in our hearts in our
[51:53] midst every time is whenever we move our
[51:56] eyes off of him whenever we move our
[51:58] eyes off of the promise and we look to
[52:00] ourselves in comparison with the
[52:03] challenge that's when we lose
[52:08] now let me just read it again
[52:10] there is not a place i hate that out
[52:12] here is moses instruction it says and
[52:15] then it says moses said unto them 17 to
[52:18] winning and spy the land of canaan and
[52:20] said unto them get up that way
[52:23] this way it says softwood and go up in
[52:26] the mountain and see the land
[52:29] now let's walk in it it says see the
[52:31] land what it is that the people that
[52:34] dwell wherein whether they'll be strong
[52:36] or weak few or many
[52:39] nothing to do with them what the land is
[52:42] he continues on 19 and says and what the
[52:45] land is that they dwell in whether it be
[52:48] good or bad whether it is the city that
[52:51] they dwell in whether it be tense or
[52:53] stronghold
[52:55] and and at the land that to dwell in
[52:56] whether it be fat or lean whether it be
[52:59] wood on a wood therein or not or that it
[53:03] be good it says by eb of good courage
[53:06] and bring of the fruits of the land not
[53:09] a place where it says well when you look
[53:12] at that
[53:13] look at yourself and see if you can
[53:15] really attain to the promise
[53:17] and yes where i want to remind us once
[53:20] again if it was by own
[53:22] merit by our own strength we would have
[53:25] been sitting here tonight we have to
[53:27] understand it started with the lord
[53:29] jesus it started with him coming where
[53:32] in fact when the word came to us we we
[53:34] recognize ourselves unworthy
[53:37] i i this is not for me i can't accept
[53:40] this this is too great for me i can't be
[53:42] in a congregation of saints but that
[53:45] same god he came because of the promise
[53:48] that he has made
[53:50] now we we spoke last time about the the
[53:53] the that how that life was manifested by
[53:56] the word of god and what about him says
[53:59] the word is a seed and only the word can
[54:02] bring eternal life and i want to say
[54:04] this i want to add this tonight it's
[54:06] important you realize that even our
[54:08] victory only comes by the word of god
[54:13] our strengths come from the word of god
[54:15] our healing comes from the word of god
[54:18] how how why do you why do you believe
[54:20] that you can be healed because he said
[54:23] i'm here
[54:24] why do you believe you can be safe
[54:26] because he said i could be saved why do
[54:28] you believe you can't believe you can be
[54:30] delivered because god said so so our
[54:33] strength is when we come and we stand
[54:36] upon the promised word and the things
[54:38] that he has said about us
[54:42] so he comes in
[54:44] you you there they are and the scripture
[54:46] speaks in hosea 12 and 13 it says and by
[54:50] a prophet the lord brought israel out of
[54:54] egypt
[54:56] he didn't say
[54:57] israel worked hard and they did so many
[55:00] things and then the lord brought them
[55:02] out israel did this and then god did
[55:04] this it says
[55:06] by a prophet the lord brought israel out
[55:09] of egypt and by a prophet
[55:13] by a prophet was it was he preserved so
[55:17] they were preserved they were kept by
[55:20] the power of god by the word of god by
[55:23] the prophet that he sent them the when
[55:26] they listened to him they were preserved
[55:28] when they listened to the instruction
[55:30] that he was given they were preserved
[55:32] but the moment they walked away the
[55:34] moment unbelief came that's when the
[55:37] things come to pass where they came and
[55:40] the unbelief was displayed so in other
[55:42] words the unbelief came
[55:44] only when they moved the eyes off of the
[55:47] promise and they put it upon themselves
[55:52] you think about how much of that we do
[55:54] on a daily basis
[55:56] something happened and we go out in
[55:58] pieces like i can't believe this
[56:00] happened to me i can't believe this is
[56:02] happening
[56:03] if god was with me this would never
[56:05] happening and if god was really with me
[56:08] i must have done something wrong i must
[56:10] have offended somebody i must have done
[56:13] this i must have done it it has nothing
[56:15] to do with you
[56:17] oh take everything that you are put it
[56:20] into the promise the prophet tells us we
[56:22] have the right to go into the scripture
[56:25] to find what the word says about us and
[56:27] to believe and stand on that scripture
[56:30] in fact it says joshua and caleb they
[56:32] stood on the promise
[56:37] they stood on the promise and god
[56:40] honored it
[56:44] jeremiah said
[56:46] jeremiah said
[56:48] and i want you to listen to this
[56:50] what happens when you put your trust
[56:53] in a man
[56:55] he says
[56:56] the scripture says here
[56:59] this is god taking them out first it
[57:01] says
[57:02] it says
[57:03] you perform signs this is jeremiah 32
[57:06] and 20 and 21. he says you perform signs
[57:10] and wonders in the land of egypt
[57:14] you do so this day this you don't you do
[57:17] this
[57:18] you so you do so this
[57:20] very day
[57:22] brought it brought in israel and among
[57:24] all mankind
[57:26] and you are
[57:28] and you have made
[57:29] a name for yourself
[57:32] as in as in in the case of this day
[57:35] you brought your people israel out of
[57:38] the land of egypt
[57:40] with signs and wonders
[57:42] with a strong head
[57:44] and the outstretched arm
[57:46] with great terror
[57:49] think about it for a second
[57:51] with with great terror
[57:53] all of the people that were around it
[57:56] looking at him all the people that were
[57:58] there they were wondering what kind of
[58:01] people is this
[58:03] what kind of god is this
[58:05] in fact they went to war and win wars
[58:08] just because of the reputation now i
[58:11] want to bring this to you and ask you a
[58:13] question yet they are they went into the
[58:16] promised land
[58:17] they went into in order to spy the
[58:19] promised land in order for them to get
[58:22] of the evidence of the promise they
[58:25] receive of that evidence when they came
[58:27] back they came back with the evidence
[58:29] being true but yet they brought in an
[58:32] evil report because of who they were now
[58:34] i asked you a question what was that
[58:37] when they went to rahab house
[58:40] in that land
[58:42] when they went there
[58:43] what was the the the inhabitant of that
[58:47] nation saying about them
[58:52] i want you to think about this yeah they
[58:54] are they say we are like grasshoppers we
[58:57] are no good they that we can't do
[58:59] anything and everything but you go back
[59:01] to the people that they were talking
[59:03] about that were giant the people that
[59:05] seemed like they could crush them with a
[59:08] just with the touch and everything the
[59:10] scripture says that those people say
[59:12] that the inhabitants of this land they
[59:14] are shaken
[59:15] they are trembling because they have
[59:18] heard of what the god of israel has done
[59:21] to other nations they know his
[59:23] reputation they know his power oh my
[59:26] brother my sister we have to learn to
[59:28] get ourselves out of the picture all the
[59:31] time the more we get ourselves out of
[59:33] the picture the perfect will will or
[59:35] will walk in the will of god the more we
[59:38] take ourselves out of the picture the
[59:40] more the more god's plan will come to
[59:42] pass in our lives
[59:48] so
[59:49] yeah there are
[59:51] the unbeliever is manifested
[59:54] why because
[59:56] of the flesh
[59:57] and i want to say this
[1:00:00] we didn't we were not given to overcome
[1:00:03] by the flesh
[1:00:05] as the scripture will say
[1:00:07] we were given the power to overcome the
[1:00:10] flesh
[1:00:14] the scripture never says your flesh will
[1:00:16] overcome this
[1:00:18] or your flesh will do this the scripture
[1:00:21] says that the spirit of god within you
[1:00:24] not only will overcome the flesh but
[1:00:26] will give you the ability to manifest
[1:00:28] the word of god that is spoken about you
[1:00:32] now listen to what the scripture says
[1:00:33] about flesh it says put not your trust
[1:00:36] in princes no in the son of man in whom
[1:00:40] there's no help his breath goes forth he
[1:00:44] returns to his earth
[1:00:47] he says and this is psalm 146 3 and 3 to
[1:00:50] 5. it says and in that every in the very
[1:00:54] day he starts perishes
[1:00:58] i want you to think about that put not
[1:01:00] your trust in princes the people of this
[1:01:03] world the systems of this world what the
[1:01:06] world is doing today we have covert 19
[1:01:09] tomorrow we have another uh uh uh
[1:01:12] what do you call it another uh uh
[1:01:17] another another uh
[1:01:20] version of it and tomorrow we'll have
[1:01:21] another version and another person it
[1:01:23] will it will get upgraded as we go
[1:01:29] we didn't get told that oh man i'm going
[1:01:31] to conquer this and that will be the end
[1:01:33] of it and then there'll be peace on
[1:01:34] earth no there's rumors of war there's
[1:01:37] going to be diseases there's going to be
[1:01:39] earthquakes those things are going to
[1:01:41] continue until the end those things are
[1:01:44] not going to end and therefore if you
[1:01:46] put one trust in it you will get the
[1:01:49] result of what the world is doing you
[1:01:52] will get version one version two version
[1:01:54] four you'll get to all of that but you
[1:01:57] put your stress on this unchanging god
[1:02:00] the god who's able to open the red sea
[1:02:02] the god who's able to raise up a people
[1:02:05] by his name and make all nations fear
[1:02:08] him because of that god if we walk with
[1:02:11] the same god we'll get the same result
[1:02:15] put not your trust in princes
[1:02:17] nor in the son of man in whom there's no
[1:02:20] help his breath goes forth he returneth
[1:02:24] to the earth to his earth
[1:02:26] in that very day his thoughts perish
[1:02:31] happy is the man that god of jacob
[1:02:34] happy is a man happy he's he that is the
[1:02:38] god of jacob for his help
[1:02:40] oh i'm telling you
[1:02:42] this is the god of isaac the god of
[1:02:45] abraham isaac and jacob and he wants to
[1:02:48] be remembered as that god why because of
[1:02:51] the things that he has done he wants to
[1:02:53] be remembered for his fame he wants to
[1:02:55] be remembered for the things that he had
[1:02:57] done when it comes to your situation
[1:02:59] he's bringing up a resume he's bringing
[1:03:02] up a reputation of the things that he's
[1:03:04] done in the past he's not a one-time god
[1:03:07] he's a god who's conquered every
[1:03:10] situation he's been in death he's
[1:03:12] conquered it he's been in sickness he's
[1:03:14] conquered it he's been in all kind of
[1:03:16] situation he's always walked out of it
[1:03:18] victorious he's never lost a fight
[1:03:24] now you tell me
[1:03:25] should i put my trust in that kind of
[1:03:27] god or put my trust in the world that's
[1:03:29] falling apart
[1:03:33] now we say we put our trust in that god
[1:03:36] but but but the things that we do
[1:03:39] shows us that we don't
[1:03:42] our actions sometimes fell short of what
[1:03:46] we claim that we trust this god
[1:03:49] something happened to us we lose our
[1:03:51] head
[1:03:52] oh woe it's me
[1:03:54] we try to go find the scripture of job
[1:03:57] and try to read so we can relate to what
[1:03:59] is it to be on the ice sheep
[1:04:02] something happened and we lose our mind
[1:04:04] we try to find a character that was so
[1:04:06] sad and job and and we try to find jonah
[1:04:10] in the belly walls belly and we scream
[1:04:13] it up it says woe is me
[1:04:15] oh but let me tell you this this kind of
[1:04:18] god honors his word
[1:04:20] it was not about the people in fact let
[1:04:23] me just jump ahead and say this even
[1:04:26] after they've done that god promised to
[1:04:28] destroy all of them but the scripture
[1:04:31] says that moses talked to god and said
[1:04:33] oh if you do this why when other nations
[1:04:36] will hear this
[1:04:40] what would they say
[1:04:42] they will say that surely that god was
[1:04:45] not strong enough to take them in the
[1:04:47] land that he said it would
[1:04:49] surely they'll say that oh look he took
[1:04:52] them out of egypt so he can kill all of
[1:04:54] him in the wilderness
[1:04:56] surely and the lord said i heard that he
[1:04:58] heard the words and he promised not to
[1:05:01] kill them and he promised that he will
[1:05:03] all that came out of the nation of egypt
[1:05:06] will die but they will have a new
[1:05:08] generation that will come up and that
[1:05:11] generation that never seen what happened
[1:05:13] at the red sea they never seen oh my
[1:05:16] brother my sister what a generation we
[1:05:18] live in the scripture says that he happy
[1:05:21] is he that believes that is not saved
[1:05:27] what is the difference within us today i
[1:05:29] wasn't here when the pillow fire showed
[1:05:31] up you were not here when god did those
[1:05:34] mighty and wonderful things oh but
[1:05:36] there's something placed within your
[1:05:38] heart you you the scripture spoke and
[1:05:41] you believe it
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:44] and now he said i'm the god who showed
[1:05:47] up the pillar of fire and i'm the god
[1:05:48] that's going to do the same for those
[1:05:50] who believe
[1:05:54] he says in first samuel 16 and 7.
[1:06:01] first samuel 16 and 70 says but the lord
[1:06:04] said unto samuel
[1:06:06] look not on his countenance
[1:06:10] or on his height
[1:06:12] and his stature
[1:06:15] because i have received refused him
[1:06:19] for the lord seeth not
[1:06:21] as a man saith
[1:06:23] oh i love this
[1:06:25] we measure people by what we see
[1:06:28] we look at them and
[1:06:30] you know if they seem to be all right
[1:06:32] and we we think oh that must be
[1:06:34] wonderful and everything and and the
[1:06:36] year is he comes and he looks at saul
[1:06:39] and he thinks oh this must be him and
[1:06:42] this must be this and this must be
[1:06:43] doubted and and we find out even
[1:06:47] when when the prophet went uh to select
[1:06:50] the the uh the the to the to the david's
[1:06:53] family to select the king when god sent
[1:06:55] him the first one came he looked at him
[1:06:57] and says oh surely by his countenance
[1:07:00] this must be him
[1:07:03] by his stature
[1:07:04] this must be him
[1:07:06] no doubt they had a good character no
[1:07:09] doubt they had they all looked like they
[1:07:10] were the ones
[1:07:12] but they came lord said no no no no
[1:07:16] until
[1:07:17] they were all passed
[1:07:19] and he asked he says don't you have one
[1:07:20] more
[1:07:21] don't you just have another one he says
[1:07:23] well i have one even now the dad i'm
[1:07:26] doubting
[1:07:27] i'm not sure if he's the one but he says
[1:07:30] you know what just go get him
[1:07:31] what is it going to hurt think about
[1:07:33] being a proposition what is it going to
[1:07:35] hurt you know every time you have to
[1:07:37] show up to be the one doing it is
[1:07:39] what's going to hurt you know what i
[1:07:41] mean basically nobody gives you a chance
[1:07:44] you are the bottom of the ladder you are
[1:07:46] basically everybody no one can do
[1:07:49] anything okay let's call him let's just
[1:07:50] see
[1:07:51] this has got to be done so let's just
[1:07:53] have him up here
[1:07:54] oh my part of my sister but let me tell
[1:07:56] you to god it's it's not the countenance
[1:08:00] that counted it's not the physical
[1:08:02] appearance that comes god doesn't look
[1:08:04] like what man looks god looks at the
[1:08:07] heart god looks at what he can achieve
[1:08:09] and i want to say this and in most times
[1:08:12] we forget this all the time is it's in
[1:08:15] our perfect weakness that is strong his
[1:08:17] strength is made perfect
[1:08:20] it's when we are at our bottom when we
[1:08:22] think we have lost it i have messed it
[1:08:25] up i don't got a chance or anything
[1:08:28] that's when god stands up and said now
[1:08:30] that's the time to get started
[1:08:33] i remember that i didn't write it down
[1:08:35] the testimony but random talks about she
[1:08:38] he went to a mental institution to pray
[1:08:40] for someone who was mentally ill and she
[1:08:43] was she was a woman and it gets there
[1:08:45] and this woman comes and it looks clean
[1:08:47] and everything he sends it he began to
[1:08:49] talk and all of the sudden brother
[1:08:51] branham realized that was the woman and
[1:08:53] so he couldn't believe it he says is it
[1:08:55] you he said yeah he said and he says
[1:08:58] okay you know and she began to tell a
[1:08:59] story and everything and but when i'm
[1:09:02] i'm paraphrasing it says you know why
[1:09:04] don't you give your heart back to him he
[1:09:06] says
[1:09:07] he wouldn't take me
[1:09:09] but random looks and says that's the
[1:09:11] material that god works with
[1:09:14] it's a broken heart
[1:09:15] a contrite heart it's when we've come we
[1:09:18] have nothing to prove we have nothing to
[1:09:21] show off when our desire is just to do
[1:09:23] the will of god when we've come we have
[1:09:26] nothing to offer god i don't have
[1:09:28] anything to offer all for myself i would
[1:09:31] whatever you need me to do i'll do it
[1:09:33] it's when we've come we we lay ourselves
[1:09:36] at the altar regardless of what his
[1:09:38] requirements are is when we come in that
[1:09:40] state that's when we are received
[1:09:44] it says
[1:09:46] i have received refuse him
[1:09:49] for the lord seeth not as a man saith
[1:09:52] for man
[1:09:54] looketh
[1:09:55] on the outward appearance
[1:09:57] but the lord looketh
[1:09:59] on the
[1:10:00] heart oh my brother my sister
[1:10:04] i say lord look at my heart
[1:10:06] when i come to services i don't want to
[1:10:08] be
[1:10:08] just to put on a show for people to know
[1:10:10] i'm here i want a heart to be right i
[1:10:14] want a gospel that could change the
[1:10:16] heart i want to come in contact with
[1:10:18] this living god the one who's made
[1:10:20] himself known to every people that he
[1:10:23] called out every people that he ever
[1:10:25] worked with that same god is here to
[1:10:27] make himself known to us in the level
[1:10:30] that he wants us to walk with him
[1:10:33] but whatever says in the message
[1:10:35] smearing a church age
[1:10:37] uh in the smear in the spirit of church
[1:10:39] age
[1:10:40] uh this is in the church
[1:10:42] so he says paragraph 148 it says
[1:10:46] there
[1:10:47] it says they are like the children of
[1:10:49] israel who came out of egypt and stopped
[1:10:52] short of the promised land
[1:10:55] so the issue was not coming out
[1:10:58] they did come out
[1:11:05] i don't
[1:11:06] and i want to say this
[1:11:08] it's easy having seen the level of
[1:11:10] supernatural
[1:11:12] that was around this prophet
[1:11:14] for somebody to say i'm coming out
[1:11:20] it's easy once you see
[1:11:22] a child not born with
[1:11:26] with no eyes just just a socket no
[1:11:29] eyeballs
[1:11:30] to see that restored
[1:11:33] to say i'm coming out
[1:11:37] it's easy to see a god garden who can
[1:11:40] take one that you could see was
[1:11:43] paralyzing and or one hit in a car
[1:11:46] accident dead
[1:11:48] raise him up from the dead for you to
[1:11:49] say i'm coming out
[1:11:52] it's easy for a baby who's been declared
[1:11:55] dead and a woman takes him and fights to
[1:11:58] the the people and comes and brings them
[1:12:00] to the prophet and that baby come back
[1:12:03] to life it's easy to look at that and
[1:12:05] say i'm coming out in fact many came out
[1:12:08] many wanted to follow
[1:12:10] many we hear it over and over and over
[1:12:12] and over and said oh you know he's he's
[1:12:15] not treating we don't know about his
[1:12:16] doctrine but what he does god is with
[1:12:19] him
[1:12:21] so there's some form of recognition to
[1:12:23] see that this looks different this means
[1:12:26] god is with this people this cannot be
[1:12:29] the works of a man but it's not enough
[1:12:32] to just recognize that
[1:12:35] oh my brother my sister if while we
[1:12:37] preach here if all we talked about is
[1:12:39] how great god was with the prophet then
[1:12:42] we are missing another portion
[1:12:46] coming out is wonderful coming out it's
[1:12:49] the beginning of it but that's not the
[1:12:51] end of it we have to go in and know that
[1:12:55] god for ourselves
[1:12:57] we have to go in and taste of the fruits
[1:13:00] of the land ourselves we have to go in
[1:13:03] and take off that grip and put it on our
[1:13:05] own shoulder we have to go in and eat
[1:13:07] off the fruits of the land
[1:13:13] coming up there's a good thing
[1:13:15] coming up see your parents live right
[1:13:17] see them go to church day in and day out
[1:13:20] you know i'll say this you know my my my
[1:13:23] my kids and they go to school and they
[1:13:25] they don't go anywhere but church so you
[1:13:28] know when they get to church when they
[1:13:30] get to school and people begin to sing
[1:13:32] songs they sing church songs
[1:13:35] they sing church songs they put their
[1:13:37] hands in the air and they shout and
[1:13:38] everything at first the teachers were
[1:13:40] confused they didn't understand what
[1:13:42] they were saying by both the pay
[1:13:44] attention to realize what they were
[1:13:46] doing so one day i come to pick them out
[1:13:48] they said do you guys go to church i
[1:13:50] said yeah i was like why he's like
[1:13:52] that's what they sing all day
[1:13:56] oh i realize that's wonderful but that's
[1:13:59] not the end of it
[1:14:01] you have to make that god your god
[1:14:04] you have to make that god a personal god
[1:14:06] you have to have the promise become
[1:14:08] yours
[1:14:10] you have to make that this god is my god
[1:14:13] why is he your god because he saved me
[1:14:16] because he healed me because he redeemed
[1:14:18] me because he brought me out of the
[1:14:20] world
[1:14:26] it says
[1:14:27] they came out of egypt but stopped
[1:14:31] but stopped short
[1:14:33] of the promised land
[1:14:35] it says now those children of israel
[1:14:37] left egypt about 2 million strong
[1:14:40] they all journeyed together and saw the
[1:14:42] same miracles of god
[1:14:45] all partuka of the same manner and water
[1:14:48] from the smitten rock
[1:14:51] all follow the same cloud think about it
[1:14:56] a cloud by day
[1:14:58] and a pill of fire by night
[1:15:00] the people where when they see the cloud
[1:15:03] stopped they stopped
[1:15:06] when the cloud went forth they stood up
[1:15:09] they packed up everything and began to
[1:15:11] walk
[1:15:12] they were so orderly uh i put together
[1:15:15] what tribe was to be on what sided what
[1:15:18] what they were to do what the
[1:15:20] instruction was when they heard the
[1:15:21] trumpet everything was totally done
[1:15:25] they couldn't deny the presence of that
[1:15:27] god in the midst
[1:15:29] why because it's not just what moses
[1:15:31] said it's because they saw what moses
[1:15:34] said come to pass
[1:15:39] but yet the two million strong
[1:15:42] are converted into two people
[1:15:46] my brother my sister
[1:15:48] it's not about what we do
[1:15:50] it's about what god has done
[1:15:53] and what the promise is for our age and
[1:15:55] what god has placed within your heart so
[1:15:57] you can follow this message no one will
[1:16:00] follow this unless god predestined him
[1:16:02] to follow it
[1:16:05] and the scripture barbara says that when
[1:16:07] they see the supernatural that's what
[1:16:10] quickens their heart
[1:16:12] because why when they see it they
[1:16:14] recognize that that's their calling
[1:16:16] that's god calling them
[1:16:18] now
[1:16:20] and patrick of the manor it says
[1:16:23] then the smitten rock and follow the
[1:16:26] cloud by day in the pillow fire by night
[1:16:29] only two reach the promised land
[1:16:33] only two were true real believers
[1:16:36] is that correct it says
[1:16:38] that is correct because the word tells
[1:16:40] us
[1:16:41] that the rest died because of unbelief
[1:16:44] and because of unbelief they couldn't
[1:16:46] enter hebrew hebrews 3 and 19. then
[1:16:50] since since that is so that is so
[1:16:53] and only two entered then the rest
[1:16:56] were not true believers
[1:16:59] what
[1:17:00] it says what made what made the
[1:17:02] difference
[1:17:03] to stayed with the word
[1:17:28] what
[1:17:31] and he says
[1:17:33] when the hearts of ten spies failed at
[1:17:37] kaddish barnea
[1:17:39] joshua and caleb did not stagger
[1:17:42] for they believe the word and says
[1:17:45] we are more than able to take their land
[1:17:50] it says they knew they could they could
[1:17:53] because god said
[1:17:55] because god had said i give you this
[1:17:59] land
[1:17:59] after those
[1:18:01] after all of those israelites saw the
[1:18:04] power and the goodness or deliverance of
[1:18:06] god they did not enter into rest which
[1:18:09] is the type of the holy ghost so you can
[1:18:12] you can see right now that very few that
[1:18:16] very few
[1:18:18] will believe
[1:18:19] all the way and receive the holy ghost
[1:18:24] this is
[1:18:27] this is the church book
[1:18:32] many came out but how many really
[1:18:33] believed
[1:18:34] how many really stayed with it
[1:18:37] how many really believed the word that
[1:18:38] was spoken and followed it how many
[1:18:41] really stuck with it and knew that this
[1:18:43] is the word of god you know that's why
[1:18:45] it's important because those that stay
[1:18:48] with it it's not because by their own
[1:18:50] strength that they stayed with it is
[1:18:52] because god made it in such a way that
[1:18:55] the word kept unfolding itself to them
[1:18:58] when they needed manner the word
[1:19:00] produced manna when they needed quail
[1:19:03] the word fought they caused the quail to
[1:19:05] come down every day when they needed
[1:19:07] water the word produced water why
[1:19:09] because they found themselves to be in
[1:19:11] the hiding place in him everything that
[1:19:14] they have need of to find it in him
[1:19:16] therefore they have no need to go
[1:19:18] outside therefore they have no needs to
[1:19:20] go and try to figure out what's
[1:19:23] happening outside all they are concerned
[1:19:25] with is what is the word says because
[1:19:27] they know when god has said it he's
[1:19:29] going to bring it to pass
[1:19:35] and he says here
[1:19:37] is
[1:19:38] what does it uh it says does god ever
[1:19:41] change his mind about his word he says
[1:19:43] now listen closely
[1:19:45] it says when the word test came
[1:19:50] when they came over and seen the up the
[1:19:52] opposition so great
[1:19:55] there it says
[1:19:56] the greatest opposition that they ever
[1:19:58] seen the amalekites was ten it says was
[1:20:02] ten times their size they said
[1:20:06] we look like grasshoppers
[1:20:08] the fences and the cities are so wall
[1:20:12] till they can run a chariot race around
[1:20:15] it
[1:20:15] two chariots
[1:20:17] as hard it says as hard as they can go
[1:20:20] around the wall see their cities why
[1:20:23] the spears are
[1:20:26] way out they are long they are giant why
[1:20:30] we look like grasshoppers we can't do it
[1:20:34] think about it
[1:20:37] think about it every time you read we're
[1:20:39] gonna have a body change we like
[1:20:40] grasshoppers
[1:20:43] we're gonna be translated we like
[1:20:44] grasshoppers
[1:20:47] we're gonna we're gonna be the sons of
[1:20:49] god manifested in the end time
[1:20:52] i can't overcome it too fake how am i
[1:20:54] gonna have that
[1:21:00] oh god he's going to have manifested
[1:21:03] sons and daughters that are going to
[1:21:05] have the word the bride has a message
[1:21:07] the bride has a place to play the body
[1:21:10] has a commission that she's been given
[1:21:12] that she has to play in the end time
[1:21:14] well i can't attain to that
[1:21:16] that's too high that's that's that's i
[1:21:18] don't even see how i'm gonna get there
[1:21:21] why are what are you looking at why are
[1:21:24] you keep looking at yourself why are you
[1:21:26] keep looking at your shortcomings your
[1:21:28] shortcomings no one has ever looked at
[1:21:30] themselves and perfect themselves
[1:21:34] and let me add this and say even if for
[1:21:36] some reason you come to where you can
[1:21:39] actually live a holy life
[1:21:41] that righteousness is filthy rag before
[1:21:43] god
[1:21:46] so what's the use of even trying
[1:21:49] oh but those that cry out day and night
[1:21:52] god i want to promise i desire the
[1:21:55] promise i have my family i have a need
[1:21:58] within my heart i have opposition
[1:22:00] wherever i go i have the devil buffeting
[1:22:03] me i need that overcoming power god said
[1:22:06] he's ready for the promise
[1:22:10] in other words the power to receive what
[1:22:12] we need it comes directly from the
[1:22:14] promise to you why because you believe
[1:22:17] the promise god is obligated to give it
[1:22:19] to you
[1:22:21] why because
[1:22:23] his word
[1:22:24] must come to pass
[1:22:26] what is this word is eternal life
[1:22:29] it's not has nothing to do with the
[1:22:31] human it's a heaven it's eternal life
[1:22:35] coming to be manifested in the mortal
[1:22:37] realm
[1:22:39] it says
[1:22:40] and two men stood on the word caleb and
[1:22:43] joshua wait a minute we are two million
[1:22:46] it says what a million wait wait a
[1:22:49] minute you two million people shut up a
[1:22:52] minute
[1:22:53] i thought that was wonderful
[1:22:55] oh this is two million people just
[1:22:57] roaring up and down oh
[1:23:00] we surely won't be able to do this in
[1:23:02] the evil report and the two people out
[1:23:04] of two million just caused them to all
[1:23:07] shut up for a second
[1:23:09] listen
[1:23:10] we are more than able to overtake the
[1:23:12] land we are more than able to do it why
[1:23:15] because they were basing the thought
[1:23:18] based on the testimony of whose god they
[1:23:21] were serving they have seen him in
[1:23:23] battle they have seen him come to fight
[1:23:26] they have seen him up in the red sea
[1:23:28] they have seen him do the herd is power
[1:23:31] the herd of his doing the herd all the
[1:23:34] nations were trembling remember they're
[1:23:37] the ones that heard that that ray of
[1:23:39] room and tell them
[1:23:42] when they came in they had they heard
[1:23:44] and they came and said okay what shall
[1:23:46] we do for you it says well i want you to
[1:23:48] save my family and everyone that comes
[1:23:50] in this house that says well you put the
[1:23:52] purple scarlet you put the i'm sorry the
[1:23:54] red uh uh
[1:23:56] uh you you tie a red scarlet uh uh
[1:23:59] clothes on there that will happen and it
[1:24:01] says but we have heard of the reputation
[1:24:04] of your god
[1:24:08] i tell you this when the seed of god
[1:24:10] hears the word
[1:24:11] it doesn't care what the opposition is
[1:24:14] because every time he hears the word he
[1:24:16] only hears good things he only hears
[1:24:19] blessings he only hears power he only
[1:24:22] hears improvement he only sees what else
[1:24:24] can i overcome what else can i take why
[1:24:27] because it's built in them
[1:24:32] think about this they saw the same thing
[1:24:36] they saw the same land
[1:24:38] they saw the same people
[1:24:40] they saw the same exact thing oh my
[1:24:43] brother my sister when we walk in this
[1:24:45] world we see the same thing
[1:24:48] we see the same thing or you know in
[1:24:50] fact sometimes people lament about the
[1:24:53] same thing both question and
[1:24:54] non-christian but we are told that our
[1:24:57] hope is not here we have this is not our
[1:25:00] continuing city this will be burned but
[1:25:03] we have a place that god has prepared
[1:25:05] for us that we're going to go to
[1:25:12] not only did they hear about
[1:25:15] how good the land was
[1:25:17] but they also heard about the reputation
[1:25:19] of their god
[1:25:21] what happened to the others when they
[1:25:23] were spoken
[1:25:24] how can how come they didn't hear it
[1:25:29] how come they only heard they only
[1:25:31] trusted what they saw
[1:25:33] but when the news came
[1:25:36] the people are trembling because of your
[1:25:38] god that part of the message was lost in
[1:25:40] translation to them
[1:25:44] the bride will be when she recognizes
[1:25:46] she is she will be an invincible army
[1:25:50] i need to examine
[1:25:54] under what circumstance will she be an
[1:25:56] invincible army
[1:25:58] what should really happen before she
[1:25:59] becomes
[1:26:00] you know you know sometimes we feel like
[1:26:02] before we can do anything we have to
[1:26:04] walk up and have a halo around our head
[1:26:06] and and lights just sun flashing in your
[1:26:09] face you know oh god is with me then i'm
[1:26:11] gonna go do something that's not how it
[1:26:13] works that's not how they did it
[1:26:15] that's not how gideon did it he took a
[1:26:18] plow he says i'm going to work i'm going
[1:26:21] to do why because god already said it it
[1:26:23] doesn't matter what i'm looking at
[1:26:30] you know we think god has to come and
[1:26:32] tap you on the shoulder says come on
[1:26:33] come on go go go it's time to go he's
[1:26:36] already said it he's already tapped you
[1:26:38] on the shoulder he calls you to hear
[1:26:40] these words he calls you to know this
[1:26:43] message he calls you to be saved he
[1:26:45] calls you to be where you are today and
[1:26:48] if he already done it what are you
[1:26:50] waiting for
[1:26:56] and he says
[1:27:00] what were they based on
[1:27:03] it says god said i've given you the land
[1:27:06] it's yours
[1:27:10] now if you go a little further
[1:27:13] when they came to conquering the land
[1:27:16] how much effort did they actually put
[1:27:18] into conquering the land
[1:27:26] we are our own greatest enemy our
[1:27:28] prophet tells us
[1:27:32] so
[1:27:33] if you were to come to them after
[1:27:35] jericho and ask
[1:27:37] can you tell me exactly
[1:27:40] what tactical battle
[1:27:42] that you guys put in place and what kind
[1:27:45] of weaponry you had to overcome the two
[1:27:48] chariot that was running on top
[1:27:50] of the building
[1:27:53] strong ones
[1:27:55] a wall cd that you couldn't penetrate
[1:28:03] oh if we can only put our trust in this
[1:28:05] god
[1:28:06] and the reason why we're talking about
[1:28:08] it today is not so we can refer to some
[1:28:10] history this is a reality of god and
[1:28:14] this is what he told
[1:28:15] moses and he told abraham he says i'm
[1:28:18] telling you i'm doing this because i
[1:28:20] know you're going to keep the story
[1:28:22] alive not just you're going to keep it
[1:28:24] alive because we serve a god who's done
[1:28:27] it in the past who's done it in the past
[1:28:29] and he's here to increase your faith to
[1:28:32] let you know i've done it i'm gonna do
[1:28:34] it in the future i'm here to do today i
[1:28:37] did it yesterday today and forever i'm
[1:28:40] here to take you to what i promise i
[1:28:42] will do you just trust my word you just
[1:28:45] walk in my word you believe what i've
[1:28:47] told you you continue to believe this
[1:28:49] message the body change will happen
[1:28:52] it's not a question whether is it gonna
[1:28:55] happen will happen
[1:28:56] when would it happen when god wants it
[1:28:59] to happen
[1:29:01] and when he wants it to happen trust me
[1:29:03] you will be ready to receive it
[1:29:08] he didn't say we're going to change our
[1:29:10] own bodies
[1:29:11] in fact let me say this
[1:29:13] the scripture says
[1:29:15] we call this translation the scripture
[1:29:17] says
[1:29:18] that he has translated us already from
[1:29:21] the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom
[1:29:23] of light
[1:29:26] we already started our change long time
[1:29:28] ago
[1:29:31] this rapture is not something new
[1:29:33] it's just part of the process it's
[1:29:36] better to process the change that we've
[1:29:37] been experiencing all along it's part of
[1:29:40] getting word of the worldliness of the
[1:29:42] desires of the world and becoming more
[1:29:44] and more into his image he started it
[1:29:47] and you know what it is and he wants you
[1:29:49] to keep walking in it the moment you
[1:29:52] step you take a step back you know
[1:29:54] you're not going in the right direction
[1:29:56] you know something tells you you are
[1:29:58] going in the wrong direction why because
[1:30:00] it's taking you to a body change it
[1:30:02] doesn't want you to change
[1:30:05] if the musician could come
[1:30:12] it says like those fellows come up
[1:30:16] they come up there and they eat of the
[1:30:18] grapes
[1:30:20] isn't it amazing that
[1:30:23] even in the state that we were in
[1:30:28] god will let people experience this
[1:30:30] goodness even in the world
[1:30:33] think about that
[1:30:36] he would actually let them taste of his
[1:30:38] goodness
[1:30:41] but the ones that are not seed
[1:30:43] they don't come back
[1:30:45] but the true seed when they taste of his
[1:30:47] goodness
[1:30:48] they have nowhere else to go
[1:30:51] they say like peter where would we go
[1:30:54] it's you that has the words of eternal
[1:30:55] life we were looking for eternal life
[1:30:58] and we have found it
[1:31:00] we didn't know what eternal life was you
[1:31:02] made it known unto us we didn't know who
[1:31:04] god was without this message all we knew
[1:31:07] some told us there were three gods and
[1:31:09] thou told us there were one god but he
[1:31:11] was mad at us some told us there were
[1:31:13] steps so we could get to him they told
[1:31:15] us all kinds of things some told us we
[1:31:17] got it when we shouted some told us well
[1:31:19] you know when we speak in tongue then
[1:31:21] god was good with us oh they told us all
[1:31:24] kind of stories oh but when we came in
[1:31:26] contact with this living god the god of
[1:31:29] this bible the god of this message when
[1:31:32] he made himself known to you he began to
[1:31:34] pull out all
[1:31:35] the unbelief
[1:31:37] all the wrong teaching you know what is
[1:31:40] he doing he's walking you to perfection
[1:31:43] he's walking you through the body change
[1:31:45] and i say my brother my sister what is
[1:31:47] the body change is a perfect walk in
[1:31:49] this message
[1:31:51] it happens as you walk with it
[1:31:54] it happens as you eat of it it happens
[1:31:56] as you partake of him
[1:31:58] when you partake of him the worldliness
[1:32:00] fall off he comes to the place why
[1:32:03] because he cannot exist where cleanness
[1:32:05] is not there he cannot exist where all
[1:32:08] kinds of things are that's why we have
[1:32:10] to empty of ourselves and put him and
[1:32:12] when you put him you can desire only
[1:32:15] more of him
[1:32:16] let's all stand
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:31] but ranam says on god of this evil age
[1:32:33] it says notice
[1:32:35] the day of man he calls this the day of
[1:32:37] man it says
[1:32:40] if you want to put it down you put that
[1:32:42] down i'm going to read it
[1:32:45] but first corinthians 5 1-5
[1:32:48] so i'm sorry first corinthians 4 1-2
[1:32:53] first corinthians 4 1 and 5.
[1:32:56] paul was speaking
[1:32:59] paul was speaking of the being judged by
[1:33:02] men
[1:33:04] it says
[1:33:06] look what all the the brag
[1:33:09] on the comment is then some it says
[1:33:11] and then somebody trying to get somebody
[1:33:14] to go to the moon
[1:33:16] i'm sorry my my page is just all
[1:33:18] scrambled up i can't see anything
[1:33:21] let me just skip a little bit
[1:33:25] if you can put it up there is god of
[1:33:27] this evil age
[1:33:28] paragraph 84.
[1:33:34] approaching 65
[1:33:37] it starts with notice
[1:33:40] the day of man
[1:33:57] the day of man is in quarters
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:30] it says just keep going higher
[1:34:33] i want to pass the milky way on go on
[1:34:37] just keep going yes
[1:34:39] paragraph 86 it says
[1:34:42] it says
[1:34:43] all it says and the whole world today is
[1:34:46] dedicated themselves to the knowledge
[1:34:49] which comes by satan and men's day is
[1:34:52] glory it says and men's day is glorified
[1:34:56] it says not by the word of god but the
[1:34:59] knowledge that is that he has
[1:35:01] now think
[1:35:03] let that soak in and i thought this was
[1:35:05] really critical think about that and
[1:35:07] when you play this tape back on this day
[1:35:10] on this point here stop for a while and
[1:35:13] think oh my
[1:35:15] oh my my heart just melted when i heard
[1:35:18] that he says
[1:35:19] how works are exalted above god's word
[1:35:22] and manifested works
[1:35:24] the wisdom of satan
[1:35:26] which he gives to eve at the beginning
[1:35:30] now listen don't miss this the wisdom of
[1:35:32] satan is exalted to the throne of
[1:35:35] worship in men above the vindicated
[1:35:38] word of god for the hour
[1:35:41] our churches proves that they
[1:35:45] that they
[1:35:46] their doctor so and so teacher so and so
[1:35:49] professor so-and-so
[1:35:51] has exalted their own knowledge and
[1:35:54] so-called from satan truth above the
[1:35:56] vindicated promise made clear right
[1:35:59] before them and men fall for it
[1:36:03] his scientific achievement
[1:36:05] trying to prove god's word
[1:36:08] wrong think about how that's happening
[1:36:11] today
[1:36:12] i mean it's all about science don't even
[1:36:15] think about saying anything bad about
[1:36:16] science they think you're a madman
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:20] don't even think about
[1:36:22] ever saying anything outside of science
[1:36:24] it's all science science says where is
[1:36:26] it leading us to the tree of knowledge
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:31] but at the same time what god is wanting
[1:36:33] to impart to his people is the
[1:36:35] understanding that when this is
[1:36:36] happening at the time when this will be
[1:36:39] happening that god will be in the midst
[1:36:42] of them performing his word and bringing
[1:36:45] it to come to pass what is god wanting
[1:36:47] to do where he is set in seating and all
[1:36:50] the knowledge and all the things
[1:36:52] god is looking up for people that can
[1:36:54] live by his word
[1:36:56] by his promise it says would you take my
[1:36:59] word he says well science looked great
[1:37:01] it says yeah but would you take my word
[1:37:03] would you let would you let my word come
[1:37:06] into your heart would you listen to what
[1:37:08] i promise i'll do in this age and only
[1:37:10] those that will take that word
[1:37:12] regardless of everything that's out
[1:37:14] there those are those that will manifest
[1:37:16] the seed of god
[1:37:19] it says
[1:37:20] man's theolo theology
[1:37:23] explaining explains god's word to the
[1:37:26] people
[1:37:28] and make it
[1:37:29] of non-effect again
[1:37:31] like it did in the denomination age when
[1:37:34] jesus appeared on the earth jesus said
[1:37:36] you're hypocrite for by your tradition
[1:37:39] they
[1:37:40] that the interpretation
[1:37:42] it says that their interpretation has
[1:37:44] took the word of god and made it of
[1:37:47] non-effect
[1:37:49] you don't need somebody to interpret the
[1:37:51] word to you
[1:37:52] you want god to be his own interpreter
[1:37:55] i heard say that you are a healer
[1:37:58] i need healing tonight
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:01] that's the only interpretation i can
[1:38:02] take i heard you are a savior i need
[1:38:05] saving tonight
[1:38:07] i heard you are a gift of all good gifts
[1:38:10] i need some gifts tonight
[1:38:13] and not only that he wants us to do that
[1:38:15] but he also wants us to reflect the same
[1:38:18] thing
[1:38:19] we can only reflect what we have
[1:38:21] received
[1:38:22] [Music]
[1:38:24] so it says
[1:38:26] the interpretation has took the word of
[1:38:29] god and made it of non-effect to the
[1:38:31] people and that's the same thing they
[1:38:33] have done today
[1:38:35] it doesn't have the effect
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:40] church becomes just a tradition
[1:38:42] we go in and we go out
[1:38:44] people show up with no expectation of
[1:38:46] the supernatural
[1:38:48] people show up and nobody's coming and
[1:38:50] saying that i know god will speak to me
[1:38:52] today i know today is the day of my
[1:38:54] deliverance i know today what i've been
[1:38:56] asking and having on my mind god is
[1:38:58] going to make it happen
[1:39:00] my sister that's the kind of expectation
[1:39:02] we need to come we're not coming to hear
[1:39:04] a man we're not coming just to hear and
[1:39:07] read some squats and say we're going
[1:39:09] home we're here in the presence of the
[1:39:11] same god we just read about the same god
[1:39:14] is here to do the same thing and it will
[1:39:17] only end so based on our expectations
[1:39:20] oh if our expectation can exceed
[1:39:23] ourselves i'm coming to church and i'm
[1:39:25] all charged at why because i'm expecting
[1:39:28] to hear from god
[1:39:30] i'm expecting that change within me
[1:39:32] let's just bow our heads our gracious
[1:39:34] father
[1:39:37] we're so thankful for the things you do
[1:39:39] god
[1:39:40] father we commit what we are into your
[1:39:42] hands
[1:39:44] lord your promise is real your promise
[1:39:46] is true
[1:39:49] father i pray that you help us overcome
[1:39:51] our humanity
[1:39:52] and no doubt everyone here tonight has a
[1:39:56] battle that they're fighting and
[1:39:58] sitting profiting them and
[1:40:01] but father
[1:40:02] your scripture tells us that it's when
[1:40:04] the word is burned into our test
[1:40:06] when we stand that test and believe what
[1:40:08] you say that's when you come to manifest
[1:40:10] your word
[1:40:12] lord we pray tonight that
[1:40:14] for every need represented in this
[1:40:16] building and i know there is
[1:40:19] i pray father that you answer it
[1:40:20] according to your word
[1:40:23] father you never left one behind
[1:40:26] you will never do it today
[1:40:28] father you never left the need undone
[1:40:32] all you said come unto me ye that are
[1:40:34] heavy laden and i shall give you rest
[1:40:38] lord we come not just as one person but
[1:40:40] as a body
[1:40:42] father those that have been coming and
[1:40:43] those that we have not seen in years we
[1:40:46] bring them to you tonight
[1:40:48] you are the god of isaac the art of
[1:40:52] jacob the god of abraham
[1:40:54] father every time those names are
[1:40:56] mentioned another dimension of what you
[1:40:59] are is being expressed lord in those
[1:41:01] words we pray father even in what you're
[1:41:04] expressing yourself in this end time in
[1:41:06] the bride we pray father that you let
[1:41:09] your work continue lord that we may be
[1:41:12] those servants that will do the things
[1:41:14] which you desire for us to do god that
[1:41:17] we may never fall short of any but
[1:41:19] always be at the post of duty father to
[1:41:22] do service for one another because only
[1:41:24] when we do that that's when the body can
[1:41:26] function
[1:41:27] help us i pray lord be with us for the
[1:41:30] rest of the week we commit our pastor
[1:41:32] into your hands ask that you bring him
[1:41:33] safe strengthen him oh god and
[1:41:36] father we commit tonight to you lord i
[1:41:38] pray that you keep everyone safe until
[1:41:40] we meet again we love you and ask us
[1:41:42] things in the name of the lord jesus

[1:43:48] heavenly father lord you
[1:43:50] spoke to us tonight lord in a way that
[1:43:52] it was personal
[1:43:54] lord there's sometimes we read things in
[1:43:56] your word and we look back and
[1:43:58] maybe think we would want to live in the
[1:43:59] day of noah or want to live on the day
[1:44:02] lord when you were in the corporal body
[1:44:03] walking on the seas of galilee lord our
[1:44:06] different times and maybe our favorite
[1:44:08] stories
[1:44:09] but i heard your prophet say today that
[1:44:11] there's no other age that he'd want to
[1:44:12] live in and lord i've heard that over
[1:44:14] the years and it just struck me today
[1:44:16] different
[1:44:17] we have the
[1:44:18] we have the word that is unfolded to us
[1:44:20] there is nothing hidden from us
[1:44:23] lord your mind has been exposed
[1:44:25] you've told us your thoughts you told us
[1:44:27] how much grace and how much love and
[1:44:29] mercy you have for us
[1:44:31] there's not a question that we have that
[1:44:33] is not answered
[1:44:34] lord you leave room for faith father but
[1:44:36] you also come behind it and you give us
[1:44:38] revelation lord and we thank you for
[1:44:40] that lord it means so much to us
[1:44:43] men over the years have probed at it but
[1:44:45] even in our in our early walks there was
[1:44:48] questions we had but you always came by
[1:44:50] and you were so sweet to answer those
[1:44:52] questions and show us what we had in
[1:44:54] need of lord what you were really
[1:44:56] thinking about us there's not a guessing
[1:44:58] game we don't have to wonder
[1:45:00] lord you're revealing yourself to us day
[1:45:02] by day
[1:45:04] lord we know there's going to be a body
[1:45:06] change
[1:45:06] lord even as brother billy said there
[1:45:08] are sometimes in our flesh we may get
[1:45:10] caught up in the questions on how and
[1:45:11] why
[1:45:12] lord but we want to put those aside and
[1:45:14] just know that you spoke it it's in your
[1:45:15] word and we want to claim it
[1:45:18] we thank you for your goodness your
[1:45:19] grace and your mercy we commit all
[1:45:21] things into your hands and we ask these
[1:45:23] things in jesus name amen
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:29] man let's just think that is our
[1:45:30] dismissal we'll think about it
[1:45:47] [Music]
