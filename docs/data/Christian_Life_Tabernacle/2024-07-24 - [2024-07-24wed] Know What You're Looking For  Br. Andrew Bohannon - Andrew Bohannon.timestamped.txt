[48:29] day Lord and even as we have this time
[48:32] now Lord we know that we've heard that
[48:35] there's some that had been in accidents
[48:37] Lord how do we know that this may be our
[48:39] last service Lord may we put all our
[48:42] energy and our effort and our Focus Lord
[48:45] may it be Lord that there will be a
[48:47] desperate cry if I don't have another
[48:49] day I got to get what I'm asking for
[48:51] from the Lord may you open our
[48:54] understanding Lord will you give isav
[48:56] Lord will you oh God break back the
[48:58] shackles and the clouds of the enemy
[49:00] Lord that the sh the sunshine of the
[49:03] light of this gospel can shine in Hearts
[49:05] today Lord be lifted up father as we
[49:08] commit all the needs all that we are
[49:11] into thy faithful hands in Jesus
[49:13] Christ's name we pray
[49:16] amen we just have a little thought and
[49:19] um if you want to turn with me we'll
[49:21] just go right into the I was thinking um
[49:24] something that been a theme
[49:27] Paul prisoner and then hearing about the
[49:30] authority of God's word and then you
[49:32] know Delight ourselves in the Lord so
[49:34] I'm just trying to stay in that same
[49:36] channel but if we go to the book of
[49:38] Hebrews and we'll turn to chapter 6 I
[49:41] just as um brother Paul was ministering
[49:44] on Sunday I just thought something that
[49:46] he said he says um about how whenever we
[49:50] miss um seeing Jesus Christ the same
[49:54] yesterday in every scripture and he said
[49:56] something I don't remember the quote but
[49:58] this is how I wrote it down in my notes
[50:00] but it says we with natural thinking
[50:02] miss the whole scriptures of the
[50:04] speaking of Jesus Christ and you know we
[50:07] we want to know our enemy amen so we by
[50:10] natural thinking we miss Jesus Christ
[50:13] the same and as the word of God is
[50:15] preached we know that we must look and
[50:17] see ourselves in the
[50:19] scriptures because Jesus Christ is alive
[50:22] today where is he living in you amen
[50:25] that's the hope of glory so as we go
[50:27] through the word of God look to see
[50:29] yourself in the mirror of God's word
[50:32] amen so we just uh there in Hebrews
[50:36] we'll go to
[50:39] verse we'll start off there in verse 11
[50:42] in the book of Hebrews chapter
[50:46] 6 feeling good this evening
[50:53] amen praise the Lord verse 11 the
[50:57] scripture says
[50:58] this for we desire that every one of you
[51:01] do show the show the same diligence to
[51:05] the full Assurance of Hope until the
[51:09] end that ye be not slothful nor
[51:11] followers of them who through faith and
[51:16] patience inherited the promise I love
[51:19] that as we we see that there's a desire
[51:22] to show the same diligence of the full
[51:25] Assurance of Hope and I love this
[51:27] because he's connecting that patience
[51:30] and faith are working together to
[51:32] inherit the promises amen so he says for
[51:36] when God made promise to Abraham because
[51:40] he couldn't swear by no greater he swore
[51:44] by himself saying surely blessing I Will
[51:48] Bless thee and multiplying I Will Bless
[51:51] thee and so after he had patiently
[51:55] endured
[51:56] he obtained the promise man for men
[52:00] verely swear by the greater and an oath
[52:03] for confirmation to them an end of all
[52:08] Strife wherein God willing more
[52:11] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of
[52:14] Promise the IM immutability of his
[52:17] counsel confirmed it by an oath that by
[52:21] two immutable things in which it is
[52:24] impossible for God to lie that we might
[52:27] have a strong consolation who have fled
[52:30] to The Refuge to lay hold upon the hope
[52:33] that set before us for which hope we
[52:37] have as an anchor of the Soul both sure
[52:41] and steadfast and which entereth into
[52:44] within the
[52:46] veil whether the Forerunner be of us
[52:50] entered even Jesus made an high priest
[52:53] Forever After the order of melchisedec
[52:56] and one more scripture in
[52:59] Genesis Genesis chapter
[53:02] [Music]
[53:14] 17 we'll start there in verse one one
[53:16] and read to verse
[53:20] 11 and when Abraham was 99 years old and
[53:24] 9 years old the the Lord appeared to
[53:28] Abram and he said unto him I am the
[53:30] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[53:34] perfect and I will make my Covenant
[53:36] between me and thee and will multiply
[53:39] thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his
[53:42] face and God talked with him saying as
[53:45] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[53:48] and thou shalt be a father of many
[53:50] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[53:53] be called Abram but thy name shall be be
[53:56] called Abraham for a father of many
[53:59] nations I have made thee and I will make
[54:02] thee exceedingly fruitful and I will
[54:04] make Nations out of thee and Kings come
[54:07] out of thee and I will establish my
[54:10] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[54:13] seed after thee in their generations for
[54:16] an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[54:20] thee and thy seed after thee and I will
[54:23] give unto thee and to thy seed after
[54:26] thee the land wherein thou art a
[54:28] stranger all the land of Canaan for an
[54:32] everlasting possession and I will be a
[54:35] God and this and God said to Abraham
[54:38] Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore
[54:41] thy and thy seed after thee in their
[54:44] generations and this is my Covenant
[54:47] which ye shall keep between me and you
[54:50] and thy seed after thee every Manch
[54:53] child among you shall be circumcised
[54:56] ized and ye shall circumcise the Flesh
[55:00] of your foreskin and it shall be a token
[55:02] of the Covenant between M between me and
[55:06] you amen the Lord added a blessing to
[55:08] the reading of his word you may be
[55:12] seated you know I just got to thinking
[55:15] about you know just the the word's been
[55:18] so precious and it's just been wonderful
[55:21] how the Lord's been opening it up to us
[55:23] and you know as as brother Paul was
[55:25] minister Min and I I thought that was
[55:27] just tremendous course all the Sunday
[55:29] was wonderful and you know I got to
[55:31] thinking about this this you know God
[55:34] promised to give us our heart's desire
[55:38] and he said I believe it was in Psalms
[55:41] 37 if you delight yourself in the Lord
[55:44] and you know really that's that's the
[55:46] Cry of the believer is you know I don't
[55:49] want the things of the world you know
[55:51] they have a pull on us you know we have
[55:54] these two these two natures and they're
[55:57] Waring for attention Waring for
[56:00] affection there's the the natural desire
[56:03] of the man through his mind and you can
[56:07] see something like if I get a good
[56:09] education then I'll have a good job and
[56:12] then I won't have to worry about money
[56:14] but then there's the contrasting is
[56:16] there's a desire of the heart to do
[56:19] what's pleasing to the Lord amen and and
[56:22] that's the the desire to do the will of
[56:25] God and in the will of God God provides
[56:28] for our needs in that place we don't
[56:30] have to worry about food and clothing
[56:34] and shelter but he said seek ye first
[56:36] the kingdom of God and so as we find out
[56:38] that you know as human beings we are in
[56:41] this great conflict we're in a great
[56:43] battle and this battle we just want to
[56:45] be mindful as we're going through as
[56:47] pilgrims of the Cross we're seeking a
[56:50] city whose Builder and maker is God and
[56:53] so the little thought that I had tonight
[56:56] I just maybe just to kind of let you
[56:58] know where we're headed but know what
[57:00] you're looking
[57:03] for a lot of times if you go to a
[57:06] certain place they have these games
[57:08] where it's like you got to find these
[57:11] Clues and different things but you
[57:12] sometimes don't know what you're looking
[57:14] for sometimes they'll give you Clues but
[57:16] all of a sudden you just kind of find
[57:18] yourself not really knowing where you're
[57:20] going right but praise God God didn't
[57:24] leave us without a guide amen God didn't
[57:26] leave us without a witness some examples
[57:29] that have gone before us that we can
[57:31] look to and point to and say God made a
[57:33] way for them how did God do it I want to
[57:36] know what you're looking for what are we
[57:39] looking for sometimes the question it
[57:41] can be in a form of a question what are
[57:44] you looking for but then in another time
[57:46] it can be in a
[57:47] declaration what are you looking
[57:50] for and so it's this this subject kind
[57:54] of came to me because of the the way
[57:57] that you know thinking about the desires
[57:59] of our heart and how they conflict and
[58:01] they battle against the desires of the
[58:03] mind they're at War within us they have
[58:07] a pull a natural pull to pull us into
[58:09] the things of the world but there's
[58:10] another pull I feel the pool of God
[58:13] calling me because this world can't
[58:15] stand that's right and we have to have a
[58:18] sobriety and so there's there's an
[58:20] approach to our desires amen you know
[58:23] there's the natural desire of the man
[58:25] and and then there's the natural desire
[58:28] or the spiritual desire of the heart
[58:31] amen and it's so important to realize if
[58:33] you're if you're pointing to something
[58:35] you you're looking at something the the
[58:38] desires of something they influence your
[58:41] direction they influence your decisions
[58:44] if the devil can dangle some carrot
[58:46] before us and we start looking at it
[58:49] through the lens of our natural mind he
[58:51] will get us hooked on things that all of
[58:54] a sudden will go further than when we
[58:56] want to go and we'll stay longer than we
[58:58] want to be there but praise God that if
[59:01] we'll let that inside something that one
[59:03] that's controlling inside the boiler
[59:05] room if we'll let him lead praise God
[59:08] we'll be free of the bondage and the
[59:10] shackles that the devil always tries to
[59:12] take and Allure our eyes and get us
[59:15] looking at the wrong things but praise
[59:17] God we can look into the word of God and
[59:19] see God has a plan for us he said I know
[59:22] the thoughts that I think towards you
[59:24] thoughts of Peace not of evil
[59:26] to bring you to an expected end and yeah
[59:29] it's just one of those glorious things
[59:31] that we can look into the word of God
[59:33] and see how God he he used our Prophet
[59:36] as an example and I'll be preaching a
[59:38] little bit out of a message called conf
[59:40] confirmation and evidence it was
[59:42] preached in
[59:44] 1962 on June
[59:46] 21st even in the introductory prayer
[59:49] brother brandom just lays
[59:52] out this wonderful thought and I'll just
[59:55] read it to you as he says gracious
[59:57] heavenly father as we come
[59:59] tonight upon the solemn occasion to
[1:00:02] speak to thy people we realize the great
[1:00:06] need of the hour praise God aren't you
[1:00:08] thankful that there was somebody who
[1:00:09] realized the great need of the
[1:00:12] hour truly we might think we need this
[1:00:14] and we might need that but oh God he he
[1:00:17] brought his word amen and that's what
[1:00:20] exactly what we needed and he says we
[1:00:22] realize the possibility of a great
[1:00:24] outpouring of the spirit we can just
[1:00:27] approach it in the right way he says so
[1:00:31] we come in the name of the Lord Jesus to
[1:00:33] ask mercy and then father we realize
[1:00:37] tonight again that we have before us the
[1:00:42] purchase of the blood of Jesus and how
[1:00:44] we would handle this and it's too much
[1:00:48] of a job for a human being so we ask
[1:00:51] Lord that you would let the Holy Spirit
[1:00:54] Come and minister to each of us and give
[1:00:56] us of the things that we have need of if
[1:00:59] our desire be thy will Lord we pray that
[1:01:02] you will pour out our desires to us
[1:01:05] tonight amen isn't that a wonderful
[1:01:08] thing you know it's a lot of times
[1:01:11] because I think it was even James
[1:01:13] sometimes we pray and we ask a miss that
[1:01:16] we would consume those things Upon Our
[1:01:18] natural lust but my brother brandham
[1:01:21] stay that the great need of the hour is
[1:01:24] that we would have the desire for God
[1:01:28] and God had planted this thirst in a
[1:01:30] human
[1:01:31] heart every single one of us in here
[1:01:34] today has a thirst for God you wouldn't
[1:01:37] be here if you didn't have that thirst
[1:01:39] for God but the devil was a perverter of
[1:01:42] that thirst and he came and corrupted
[1:01:45] the desires of man to go after the
[1:01:48] things of the world there's a part of us
[1:01:50] that is of the
[1:01:52] world and so we want to recognize this
[1:01:55] is a great battle Shadow it's easy to
[1:01:57] look over our shoulder and look back and
[1:02:00] different things but we want to stay in
[1:02:01] the
[1:02:03] Battleground we want to know what we're
[1:02:05] looking
[1:02:06] for I'm looking for the Lord to lead
[1:02:08] amen I'm looking for the Lord to satisfy
[1:02:11] my
[1:02:16] desires in paragraph 34 brother Brown
[1:02:19] says this I'm thinking on confirmation
[1:02:22] and
[1:02:23] evidence and he says it seems like man
[1:02:26] always required confirmation and some
[1:02:29] sort of evidence he says and so much
[1:02:32] more as the time and the age and the
[1:02:36] Skeptics that we're living you know I
[1:02:38] think this is so wonderful because in
[1:02:40] this time you think about I mean you can
[1:02:43] go to any kind of Avenue whether it's
[1:02:45] through a security breach you there has
[1:02:48] to be a confirmation now they have these
[1:02:50] different programs where they have all
[1:02:51] these different levels of security I got
[1:02:53] to have this confirmation first before I
[1:02:56] can know evidently that you're the
[1:02:58] person that is authorized to come into
[1:03:01] this portal or or we need to have a
[1:03:03] confirmation for uh this politician or
[1:03:07] we need to have confirmation um that the
[1:03:09] package was delivered Amazon has this
[1:03:13] thing where they take pictures they have
[1:03:14] to have they have to produce an Evidence
[1:03:17] when there is ever a claim that hey this
[1:03:19] did not show up we made the order we
[1:03:22] paid the money and we don't have the
[1:03:24] package
[1:03:26] but now we're living because there's so
[1:03:27] many Skeptics there's so many
[1:03:31] impersonations there's so many things
[1:03:33] that pervert truth that we are now in
[1:03:36] this age in this time where we have to
[1:03:39] have confirmation we want to have an
[1:03:41] Evidence Hallelujah but there's a
[1:03:44] corrupt way to seek after
[1:03:47] evidences but God has made a way that we
[1:03:50] can have a confirmation and an evidence
[1:03:52] that really satisfies our heart's desire
[1:03:56] and we can know what we're looking for
[1:03:59] God didn't just make it so mysterious he
[1:04:01] actually made it at the end time that
[1:04:03] all the secrets and Mysteries of God
[1:04:05] would be fulfilled in plain view for the
[1:04:07] the believer today so we know what we're
[1:04:10] looking for we're looking into the
[1:04:12] message of the
[1:04:13] hour We're looking into the face of
[1:04:20] God so much more is the time the time of
[1:04:24] age of skeptic ICS that we're living in
[1:04:27] everything must be
[1:04:28] confirmed it must be an Evidence to it
[1:04:32] and the evidence of the confirmation
[1:04:35] gives us aurity of what we're looking
[1:04:39] for I mean Believers aren't just going
[1:04:41] to fall for anything in this hour it can
[1:04:44] look it can have songs that claim jesus'
[1:04:47] name it can have all of the the the
[1:04:51] clothing of a religious
[1:04:54] individual but by their fruit they are
[1:04:57] known that's we we're not deceived we
[1:05:01] are the we are the type we are of the
[1:05:03] attribute that can't be
[1:05:07] deceived now we we can make
[1:05:10] mistakes but praise God God he he comes
[1:05:14] by our way and gives us a little touch
[1:05:16] with those nail scarred hands and we say
[1:05:18] oh Lord that enemy he had me trapped but
[1:05:21] thank God for the blood I'm wrong Lord
[1:05:23] you're right amen
[1:05:26] that's the desire of our heart we want
[1:05:27] to be right with God we don't want to
[1:05:29] have nothing in between our our
[1:05:32] relationship with the
[1:05:34] Lord and then secondarily once we have
[1:05:37] that we don't want to be have nothing in
[1:05:38] between our brothers our sisters we
[1:05:40] don't have nothing against our neighbor
[1:05:42] we don't have nothing against our
[1:05:44] coworker or anybody we don't want to
[1:05:46] have no guile we want to be free in the
[1:05:49] spirit we're going to be able to worship
[1:05:52] him whether at work or in church or
[1:05:55] going down down the
[1:05:56] street praise
[1:06:02] God praise God you know it's one of
[1:06:04] those things
[1:06:09] that you know you think about when
[1:06:11] somebody if if what we're going to be
[1:06:14] restored to is the Faith of Our Father
[1:06:16] Abraham and if you know you go out and
[1:06:20] you purchase a car or a home or
[1:06:22] something you know there's people that
[1:06:25] make purch purches on property that they
[1:06:27] they do it what's called sight unseen
[1:06:29] they'll just they'll just buy a piece of
[1:06:31] property because it's a good deal they
[1:06:32] never even looked at it or anything all
[1:06:35] of a sudden they just because that's
[1:06:36] part of their investment strategy
[1:06:38] they'll go and buy a bunch of deals from
[1:06:40] auction or whatever and then all of a
[1:06:42] sudden they have this you know deed it's
[1:06:45] a title and though they never seen it or
[1:06:48] anything they have the right to that
[1:06:51] property amen and you think about it
[1:06:54] that's what faith is is you know a lot
[1:06:57] of the promises of God you you don't see
[1:07:00] with your natural eye but by faith you
[1:07:02] know that it was purchased that you can
[1:07:04] have healing you can be saved you might
[1:07:08] not be able to physically say this is
[1:07:11] it you you might not be able to give an
[1:07:14] Evidence to somebody uh with the natural
[1:07:17] like this is this is it but there's
[1:07:20] something on the inside that answers
[1:07:22] back that says I possess this right God
[1:07:25] has confirmed it to me not just because
[1:07:28] I seen it in the word of God but God has
[1:07:30] done something for me I possess
[1:07:42] something it's a
[1:07:44] confirmation when someone buys a car
[1:07:46] it's a confirmation to him that he owns
[1:07:49] that car because he has the deed or the
[1:07:51] title in paragraph 36 he says and then
[1:07:54] if we bought a piece of the ground
[1:07:56] though we've never seen the ground know
[1:07:58] nothing about the ground yet we have the
[1:08:02] abstract deed to the ground it belongs
[1:08:06] to us whether we've seen it or not it
[1:08:08] still belongs to us the car belongs to
[1:08:10] us whether we have seen it or not yet we
[1:08:13] have the title given to us and we hold
[1:08:17] it in our possession in our
[1:08:20] name that that title shows that we own
[1:08:24] the car
[1:08:26] the abstract tells we us that we own the
[1:08:32] property
[1:08:34] amen oh when Jesus Christ paid the price
[1:08:38] at Calvary you didn't realize it but you
[1:08:42] had an inheritance you were already an
[1:08:45] heir of promise we read the scripture
[1:08:49] you are the faith seat of Abraham and
[1:08:52] God when he manifest the son his son
[1:08:54] Jesus Christ Christ he loosed The
[1:08:57] Inheritance back to us all he's asking
[1:08:59] is if you will believe my word take me
[1:09:02] at my word healing is a part of your
[1:09:06] inheritance salvation is part of his
[1:09:09] inheritance Redemption for your
[1:09:13] family praise
[1:09:15] God the promise of an endless life
[1:09:19] amen praise
[1:09:23] God Hebrews 11 says faith is the
[1:09:27] substance of things hoped for the
[1:09:29] evidence of Things Not Seen see it's a
[1:09:33] substance see and he said that it's not
[1:09:36] something it's not
[1:09:39] hope most
[1:09:41] people come with hope but faith is a
[1:09:45] substance it isn't something that you're
[1:09:48] hoping for When Faith takes a hold you
[1:09:51] have a substance
[1:09:56] you know I I just love how it just the
[1:09:59] prophet will take it and it anchors
[1:10:02] because really what it is showing us as
[1:10:05] Believers that's what's In My Heart Lord
[1:10:08] I can accept that and I can believe it
[1:10:10] that way because it resonates it
[1:10:12] harmonizes with what's in here now but
[1:10:16] the natural mind can say well I hope I'm
[1:10:18] I'm
[1:10:20] Healed we have to fight that enemy
[1:10:30] when faith has taken a hold it has it
[1:10:34] you have a
[1:10:36] substance not just a myth you've got a
[1:10:39] hold of something you know it nothing
[1:10:41] shakes you from it it's yours you're
[1:10:45] positive you got it in your hand you got
[1:10:49] it it's your
[1:10:51] possession praise God you know you know
[1:10:56] the scripture says faith is a gift of
[1:10:59] God God has given you Faith that's right
[1:11:03] it is a powerful weapon against the
[1:11:05] lives of the
[1:11:09] enemy you
[1:11:11] know it's uh we just kind of want to
[1:11:14] testify about
[1:11:16] something you know one of the things
[1:11:19] that when I think about faith you know
[1:11:22] before you ever really started thinking
[1:11:24] about God and before you even wanted to
[1:11:27] think about serving God there was
[1:11:29] something that was a desire in your
[1:11:31] heart it was for me I didn't want to be
[1:11:35] the person that I was
[1:11:37] and but I realized by predestination now
[1:11:42] that God had planted that something
[1:11:44] inside of the heart that all of a sudden
[1:11:46] I can start saying wait a minute I'm not
[1:11:49] looking to carry on this kind of life i'
[1:11:52] I'd rather not even live for that kind
[1:11:54] of life cuz I realize that where that's
[1:11:57] taking me is into a place I don't like I
[1:12:01] don't
[1:12:02] want it doesn't harmonize with something
[1:12:05] that I feel like is
[1:12:07] possible I mean it's hard to explain but
[1:12:10] for the believer you
[1:12:12] know you know how you're here how you're
[1:12:17] here tonight to serve God it was
[1:12:21] impossible but God rich in mercy God who
[1:12:24] had a all on your life God wanted to
[1:12:27] show you what his plan
[1:12:29] was and make you a partaker praise
[1:12:34] God you know you think about the if if
[1:12:38] someone was
[1:12:39] starving and and they were dying they
[1:12:42] were on the verge you know but if if if
[1:12:46] what they needed was that loaf of
[1:12:50] bread and that loaf of bread was
[1:12:52] standing there but in order to possess
[1:12:55] it I needed a quarter and we know this
[1:12:59] if I had the quarter and that
[1:13:01] represented my healing from starvation
[1:13:05] my dying if I had that in my possession
[1:13:09] it would be good as gold because now I
[1:13:11] know it's just a matter of taking it in
[1:13:14] but I already have it now and that's the
[1:13:18] substance that he gives when he makes us
[1:13:21] a joint air in Christ
[1:13:23] Jesus when he makes that
[1:13:26] reality when you come into his kingdom
[1:13:29] who did that was it just your desire no
[1:13:33] no it was the call of God but the desire
[1:13:36] brought you to a reality that I can't go
[1:13:39] another day without him that's
[1:13:49] right now that quarter represented the
[1:13:52] purchasing power so you have purchasing
[1:13:56] power in the economy of God think about
[1:13:59] how many people if they're going to buy
[1:14:02] cars or Properties or businesses or if
[1:14:05] they're in a market business and they
[1:14:07] got to buy books or different things can
[1:14:10] you imagine how happy they would be if
[1:14:12] all of a sudden alls they lack to be
[1:14:14] successful in their business was
[1:14:15] purchasing power oh if I just had a
[1:14:18] million dollars I would buy
[1:14:21] $20,000 worth of this and 50,000 of that
[1:14:25] all of a sudden they would feel they
[1:14:26] start feeling a little bit
[1:14:28] looser man the bands are just man my
[1:14:31] business potential is just
[1:14:33] increasing praise God but when you have
[1:14:36] a substance of
[1:14:38] Faith okay you have power with
[1:14:43] God praise the Lord they want to shake
[1:14:46] off all that natural stuff boy it just
[1:14:50] clogs the channel I'm a witness it clogs
[1:14:53] the channel but praise God to to know
[1:14:57] that like what brother Billy was
[1:14:59] preaching about the authority of God's
[1:15:00] word God has entrusted you with
[1:15:04] virtue you have the power to move God on
[1:15:08] the
[1:15:09] scene to call him on the scene oh
[1:15:13] my
[1:15:15] my he said so that's the way faith is
[1:15:18] Faith is something that you have you
[1:15:20] know you've got it and when you receive
[1:15:24] faith that God
[1:15:26] is then that God is going to give you
[1:15:30] this yet your healing might not be there
[1:15:33] but yet something has anchored within
[1:15:35] you that tells you that it's going to be
[1:15:38] all
[1:15:39] right we we want to know what we're
[1:15:41] looking for I might not have the
[1:15:44] manifestation of my healing but I know
[1:15:46] that God is and God is giving it to
[1:15:53] me there's there got to be something
[1:15:56] happen where it anchors in our
[1:15:58] heart you know it's very simple in many
[1:16:02] ways we we complicate it because we have
[1:16:05] a natural mind but God he's the one that
[1:16:09] chose you you didn't come to this by
[1:16:12] your
[1:16:13] choosing now you're here to remain by
[1:16:16] your
[1:16:17] choosing but he's the one that Drew
[1:16:20] you amen then he gave you a new heart he
[1:16:24] gave you you a new spirit to desire his
[1:16:27] will oh praise God for the hand of God
[1:16:30] in our lives
[1:16:42] M
[1:16:43] Amen in verse 40 it says this see it's
[1:16:47] it isn't a myth it's not an imagination
[1:16:49] it's a substance and anything that is a
[1:16:51] substance is isn't a myth it's something
[1:16:54] that you actually got AO a hold of it
[1:16:57] now there's where many people fail to
[1:17:00] get healed is they have hope instead of
[1:17:02] Faith you hope that you will your your
[1:17:05] kind of imaginary fade because you feel
[1:17:08] like you
[1:17:10] are you're you're uh appropriated that
[1:17:14] but when actually you got a hold of
[1:17:16] Faith it's a substance it's something
[1:17:19] real then you hold that that's what
[1:17:22] brings it I wish I could have that
[1:17:27] instantaneously faith that I'd like to
[1:17:30] have I'm sorry I don't have
[1:17:36] it the only way that I got anchored
[1:17:39] faith is when he tells me something to
[1:17:42] do or shows me to do
[1:17:44] it my well I just think this is
[1:17:48] something that I needed to hear praise
[1:17:50] God you know brother brandom he was a he
[1:17:54] was a very special bird that he could
[1:17:56] see we're Eagles in here right amen he
[1:18:00] could see and he can hear directly from
[1:18:03] God Amen right and that gave him what he
[1:18:07] called a anchored great faith amen amen
[1:18:12] I'm sure that if you were in that place
[1:18:13] where you heard from God daily and you
[1:18:15] saw Visions like he it would give you
[1:18:17] great anchored faith
[1:18:28] he
[1:18:29] said if he would appear on this platform
[1:18:32] tonight and say to me go to the
[1:18:34] presidential graveyard tomorrow morning
[1:18:37] at 10:00 call George Washington from the
[1:18:40] dead I'd invite the whole world to come
[1:18:43] and see it done and watch it done yes
[1:18:45] sir for I have faith in what he been
[1:18:49] told me and never because never has he
[1:18:52] failed to confirm whatever he said to me
[1:18:56] so I have faith in it believing it that
[1:19:00] it is the truth because it's a builtup
[1:19:05] affair down through life since a little
[1:19:07] boy all the visions of the thousands not
[1:19:11] one of them has ever failed therefore it
[1:19:14] is the truth it gives me Faith I got
[1:19:18] faith in what he says now I've often
[1:19:21] wondered if sometimes I didn't go beyond
[1:19:24] the boundaries and say God Give Me Faith
[1:19:27] to speak to this one to speak to that
[1:19:29] one to speak to that one now we realize
[1:19:32] that our lord Jesus being Emanuel never
[1:19:35] did that for he plainly said in
[1:19:38] John 5 and 19 verily verily I say unto
[1:19:42] you the son can do nothing but he sees
[1:19:44] the father doing not hears the father
[1:19:47] saying but sees the father doing that
[1:19:50] doeth the son
[1:19:52] likewise there's got to be something
[1:19:54] that happen to make you have the EV this
[1:19:57] evident evidence this
[1:20:00] confirmation now if God said you're it's
[1:20:03] going to rain in the morning it wouldn't
[1:20:04] be hard for me to make to to to make
[1:20:07] ready for rain because I know it's going
[1:20:10] to
[1:20:13] rain now if we can change that
[1:20:17] around from seeing a vision or hear the
[1:20:20] audible voice of God but change it
[1:20:23] around to the initial way of having
[1:20:25] faith is by hearing the written word of
[1:20:29] God we want to know what we're looking
[1:20:33] for this is the Simplicity of the Gospel
[1:20:38] to be able to go into the storehouse as
[1:20:40] individuals God has already invited us
[1:20:42] to come we can go for
[1:20:45] ourself we don't need another man to
[1:20:48] tell us that God has already invited
[1:20:51] us that's right and we can take the the
[1:20:54] written word and hold to it God has
[1:20:57] loosed the promises for us amen
[1:21:01] amen now when God comes into our midst
[1:21:04] and proves himself to us in giving the
[1:21:07] US the Holy
[1:21:08] Ghost oh I love that that's enough for
[1:21:11] me amen how many have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:14] praise God you know what God is so
[1:21:17] faithful it's it's a simple formula
[1:21:20] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:21:23] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:21:25] receive the Holy Ghost it's that simple
[1:21:28] you have the right to the promise God
[1:21:30] has loosed you he's paid the price it's
[1:21:33] a simple formula the hard part is is the
[1:21:39] repentance what we think about the the
[1:21:42] matter well I'm I'm still young I got
[1:21:44] more
[1:21:45] time that voice hasn't died that's right
[1:21:48] that voice is still
[1:21:50] speaking and the devil uses humans just
[1:21:52] like God he's seen God using humans and
[1:21:56] he wanted to do the same thing but I'm
[1:21:59] here to say that God is faithful to his
[1:22:02] word if you'll repent and you'll be
[1:22:05] baptized God will bring an Evidence
[1:22:07] he'll bring a
[1:22:13] confirmation now when God comes in our
[1:22:15] midst and proves himself to us in giving
[1:22:17] us the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues
[1:22:19] giving interpretation sending gifts
[1:22:21] Among Us like that or prophecies
[1:22:24] that stands at the certain place and
[1:22:27] says a certain thing and does a certain
[1:22:29] thing and proves it time after time and
[1:22:32] it never fails that should build us into
[1:22:36] a place that would give us a hold on
[1:22:39] that word that we wouldn't let it
[1:22:44] Loose it ought to be an Evidence right
[1:22:47] there as long as God said so that
[1:22:50] settles it
[1:22:52] see you know when you think of about
[1:22:55] because we're living in that time of
[1:22:57] Skeptics because we're living in the
[1:22:59] time of
[1:23:00] impersonations people I just heard a
[1:23:02] testimony a brother was telling me that
[1:23:05] people impersonated his business like
[1:23:07] they just shut his whole thing down on
[1:23:09] the web and they were copying like the
[1:23:12] way it was an impersonation and I don't
[1:23:14] know how many thousands of dollars that
[1:23:17] they bezzel or whatever you call it but
[1:23:19] there was an impersonation you know no
[1:23:21] doubt that Wars against the flesh now
[1:23:23] they're skeptical the next thing and the
[1:23:25] next thing well I I got to have now a a
[1:23:28] greater
[1:23:29] confirmation that that as you know the
[1:23:32] different things come through you you
[1:23:34] you know that's just the age that we
[1:23:36] live in you know but this is what I love
[1:23:40] so much is you know though there's a
[1:23:42] bogus though there's impersonators
[1:23:44] there's a real genuine that I had to be
[1:23:46] made off of there's a real
[1:23:48] Christian just because there's a lot of
[1:23:51] false doesn't mean there's real
[1:23:53] Witnesses of the Resurrection Direction
[1:23:55] that's
[1:23:56] right
[1:24:03] amen as sure as there's a false there's
[1:24:05] got to be a real one that's made off of
[1:24:07] so there is a real Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:24:10] Spirit a real Divine Healing a real
[1:24:13] power of God a real faith in the word
[1:24:16] and that is the confirmation something
[1:24:19] that's anchored how glorious it
[1:24:22] confirms man looks for that
[1:24:25] it's a
[1:24:26] natural it's a natural it's natural of a
[1:24:32] man excuse me God made man that way
[1:24:37] that's the way God made up a man so
[1:24:42] therefore making up a man with that kind
[1:24:45] of
[1:24:46] makeup God does something to answer to
[1:24:49] that man's
[1:24:51] desires aren't you glad about that amen
[1:24:54] thank God can give you an Evidence God
[1:24:57] can give you a confirmation we're not a
[1:25:00] bunch of sign Seekers but we know that
[1:25:02] God has given
[1:25:05] evidence so that we can know we're on
[1:25:07] the wrong road if we're going the wrong
[1:25:09] way or if we're on the right way we can
[1:25:12] continue that's the kind of God he
[1:25:18] is you know as we looked a little bit
[1:25:20] last time but the Journey of Abra oh my
[1:25:23] just think about it you know and we just
[1:25:26] maybe go to uh Genesis
[1:25:29] 15 and and just thinking about how that
[1:25:32] you know this this witness that God you
[1:25:37] know he gave that that promise to
[1:25:40] Abraham but then he confirmed that
[1:25:43] promise amen and he did it with an oath
[1:25:46] but we'll just read a little bit here in
[1:25:48] 15 uh and paragraph
[1:25:51] 4 Genesis 15
[1:25:54] and
[1:25:55] four he says and behold the word of the
[1:25:58] Lord came to him saying this
[1:26:02] is this shall not be thine Heir but he
[1:26:05] that shall come forth out of thine own
[1:26:08] bowels shall be thine
[1:26:10] Heir and he brought
[1:26:12] forth he brought him forth abroad and
[1:26:15] said look now towards heaven and tell
[1:26:18] the Stars if thou were able to number
[1:26:20] them and he said unto him so shall thy
[1:26:23] seed be and he believed in the Lord and
[1:26:28] he counted it unto him for righteousness
[1:26:31] and he said unto him I am the Lord that
[1:26:34] brought thee out of AA and out of the
[1:26:36] caldan to give you this land to inherit
[1:26:39] it and he said Lord
[1:26:43] God whereby shall I know that I shall
[1:26:46] inherit
[1:26:48] it isn't that isn't that awesome you
[1:26:52] know if we're the fa seat of ab Abraham
[1:26:55] we want to know what are we going to be
[1:26:57] looking for how are we going to know
[1:27:01] hallu he said and he said unto him take
[1:27:05] me a hepher of three years okay and a
[1:27:08] she goat of three years old and a ram of
[1:27:11] three years old and a turtle dove and a
[1:27:13] young pigeon and he took upon him all
[1:27:17] these and divided them in the midst and
[1:27:20] laid each piece one against the other
[1:27:23] but the bird divided he not and when the
[1:27:26] fouls came down upon the carcass Abraham
[1:27:30] drove them
[1:27:32] away and when the sun was going down a
[1:27:36] deep sleep fell upon Abram and low and
[1:27:40] horror of great Darkness fell upon him
[1:27:42] and he said unto Abram know of assurity
[1:27:45] that thy seed shall be a stranger in the
[1:27:48] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[1:27:51] them and they shall afflict them 400
[1:27:54] years and also that Nation whom they
[1:27:57] Shall Serve I will judge and afterwards
[1:28:01] shall they go out with great substance
[1:28:04] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[1:28:07] peace and thou shalt be buried in a good
[1:28:10] old age but in the fourth generation
[1:28:14] there shall come hither again for the
[1:28:17] iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
[1:28:20] and it came to pass that when the sun
[1:28:23] went down
[1:28:25] can I say in the evening
[1:28:28] time and then it came to pass that when
[1:28:31] the sun went down and it was dark and
[1:28:34] behold a smoking furnace and a burning
[1:28:37] lamp passed between those pieces in the
[1:28:40] same day the Lord made a covenant with
[1:28:43] Abraham Abram saying unto thy seed will
[1:28:46] I give this land from the river
[1:28:51] Egypt unto the Great River the riv euph
[1:28:54] fores amen and I just think about that
[1:28:58] God you know this is what he said and I
[1:29:02] is so special to think about how God
[1:29:04] told him now this is going to be the way
[1:29:07] that I'm going to
[1:29:09] confirm how how is this where how how am
[1:29:13] I going to know that I'm going to
[1:29:14] inherit
[1:29:16] this God wants to give us confirmation
[1:29:19] of our inheritance and so he lays these
[1:29:22] sacrifices he was told to him in the
[1:29:24] middle and all of a sudden at the at the
[1:29:27] evening time at the setting of The Sun
[1:29:29] there was this Burning of and this this
[1:29:32] flame that went between the the
[1:29:36] sacrifice my think about God coming in
[1:29:39] between that
[1:29:41] sacrifice he's saying now that's how
[1:29:43] you'll know that's what you'll be
[1:29:45] looking
[1:29:46] for praise
[1:29:49] God God coming in a
[1:29:52] sacrifice oh my
[1:29:55] he says this in paragraph 52 he says now
[1:29:57] Faith God told Abraham here he gave him
[1:30:00] the promise and then God confirmed this
[1:30:03] promise to him gave him an Evidence by
[1:30:06] taking an oath before him and the
[1:30:09] immutable thing is that God cannot lie
[1:30:13] and not only that when he promised him
[1:30:18] then beyond that he swore to
[1:30:21] it now God taking an oath to
[1:30:26] himself you got to swear to someone
[1:30:29] greater than you and there was no one
[1:30:31] greater to to swear to greater than
[1:30:34] himself so he swore to himself and the
[1:30:38] promise was unto Abraham and is a
[1:30:41] conjunction to his seed after him not
[1:30:43] seeds but his seed and Christ is the
[1:30:47] Seed of Abraham and we being in Christ
[1:30:50] The Life of Christ in US makes us
[1:30:53] Abraham's
[1:30:54] children and Hees with him according to
[1:30:58] the promise amen God you you know my
[1:31:02] heart you know I desire to be identified
[1:31:05] you you know my desire is to see myself
[1:31:08] in this
[1:31:10] word and when you're in Christ you're
[1:31:13] Abraham's seed praise God you're heir to
[1:31:16] every
[1:31:18] promise
[1:31:20] my my
[1:31:27] in Galatians chapter
[1:31:29] 3 just point to another little Paul
[1:31:33] picks this up and I just thought my
[1:31:35] goodness thank God for his
[1:31:46] prophets Galatians chapter
[1:31:48] three verse five says this
[1:32:02] he therefore that Minister unto you the
[1:32:05] spirit and worketh miracles among you
[1:32:07] doeth he by the law The Works of the law
[1:32:10] or by the hearing of Faith even Abraham
[1:32:13] believed God and it was account
[1:32:15] accounted to him for
[1:32:17] righteousness know ye therefore that
[1:32:21] they which are of Faith the the same are
[1:32:24] the children of Abraham and the
[1:32:26] scripture foreseeing that God would
[1:32:29] justify the Heathen through faith
[1:32:32] preached before the the gospel unto
[1:32:35] Abraham saying in the shall all the
[1:32:38] nations be blessed so then they which be
[1:32:42] of Faith are blessed with faithful
[1:32:45] Abraham for as many as are the works of
[1:32:49] the law are under the curse for it is
[1:32:51] written cursed is everyone that can
[1:32:55] continueth not in all all things which
[1:32:59] are written in the book of the law to do
[1:33:01] them but that no man is justified by the
[1:33:05] law in the sight of God it is evident
[1:33:09] for the just shall live by
[1:33:13] faith and the law is not Faith but the
[1:33:18] man that doeth them shall live in
[1:33:22] them amen
[1:33:25] and Christ ha redeemed us from the curse
[1:33:27] of the law being made the curse for us
[1:33:31] as it is written cursed is every man
[1:33:33] that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing
[1:33:35] of Abraham might come onto the Gentiles
[1:33:38] through Jesus
[1:33:40] Christ that we might receive the promise
[1:33:42] of the spirit through faith Brethren I
[1:33:46] speak after the manner of men though it
[1:33:48] be but a man's Covenant yet if it be
[1:33:52] confirmed
[1:33:54] no man disallow or added there
[1:33:57] unto now to Abraham and to his seed were
[1:34:00] the promise promises
[1:34:03] made he said not to thy seeds as of many
[1:34:08] but as of one into thy seed which is
[1:34:12] Christ and this I say that the Covenant
[1:34:15] which was confirmed before of God in
[1:34:18] Christ the law which was 430 years after
[1:34:23] cannot disano that it should make the
[1:34:26] promise of non-ff for if the inheritant
[1:34:30] be of the law it is no more of promise
[1:34:35] but God gave it to Abraham by promise
[1:34:39] wherefor then serveth the law that was
[1:34:43] added because of transgression till the
[1:34:46] seed come shall come to whom the promise
[1:34:49] was made and it was ordained by angels
[1:34:53] in the hand of a mediator now a mediator
[1:34:56] is not a mediator of one but God is
[1:35:00] one is the law then against the promises
[1:35:04] of God God forbid for if there be been a
[1:35:09] law given which could have given life
[1:35:13] verely righteousness should have been by
[1:35:15] the
[1:35:16] law but the scripture hath concluded all
[1:35:19] under sin that the Promise by faith of
[1:35:24] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[1:35:26] believe amen but that before Faith came
[1:35:32] we were kept under the law shut up unto
[1:35:34] the faith which would afterward be
[1:35:37] revealed therefore the law was our
[1:35:40] school Master to bring us to Christ and
[1:35:43] we might be justified by
[1:35:46] faith but after that faith has come we
[1:35:52] are no longer under School
[1:35:56] Master
[1:36:00] amen for all of the children of God by
[1:36:04] faith we are all children of God by
[1:36:06] faith in Jesus Christ for as many of you
[1:36:08] are baptized unto Christ have put on
[1:36:12] Christ
[1:36:13] amen and then 29 it says there and if
[1:36:16] you be in Christ then ye are Abraham's
[1:36:19] seed and HS according to the promise
[1:36:21] praise God you know we take the old Old
[1:36:23] Testament the New Testament we want it
[1:36:25] all
[1:36:32] amen you know I got to thinking about
[1:36:35] the journey and you know you think about
[1:36:37] Abraham and how God made that Covenant
[1:36:39] with him and he he gave him this big
[1:36:42] promise and all of a sudden immediately
[1:36:44] he goes in to Egypt and you know he he
[1:36:48] all of a sudden you know maybe with his
[1:36:49] own thinking he tells Sarah you know hey
[1:36:52] when we get over there just let them
[1:36:54] know straight up that you're my sister
[1:36:57] cuz she was beautiful and all of a
[1:36:59] sudden you know that the Pharaoh wanted
[1:37:01] to have Sarah's wife and God had plagued
[1:37:05] pharaoh and his kingdom because of that
[1:37:07] thing that he did he had a carnal a
[1:37:11] natural thinking to preserve his own
[1:37:13] flesh and this is the thing maybe he
[1:37:17] wasn't looking forward at the decision I
[1:37:19] don't know if if he was thinking wait
[1:37:22] God already said that I would be a
[1:37:25] father of Nations how can he wipe me out
[1:37:27] but it's part of the journey it's part
[1:37:30] of the Journey of
[1:37:32] Faith and then you think about it then
[1:37:34] God comes to him and says okay now he
[1:37:37] goes through and he says now I want you
[1:37:38] to to separate you know to to you know
[1:37:41] just further on it's just like us God
[1:37:44] wants us to separate from the things of
[1:37:46] the
[1:37:48] world God wants us to be free to worship
[1:37:52] him to serve him
[1:37:54] to honor his
[1:37:56] word and then I got to thinking about
[1:37:59] you know after Abraham you know he's you
[1:38:03] know he's given uh Hagar he's like go
[1:38:07] ahead and you know and ishma came and
[1:38:10] then all of a sudden and I believe it's
[1:38:13] in this uh Genesis 17 but you know
[1:38:16] Abraham came to a place where you got a
[1:38:17] name
[1:38:19] change you know and that's the Journey
[1:38:21] of the believer there comes a time where
[1:38:24] you know your name has changed and
[1:38:27] you're no longer identified with that
[1:38:29] old man all of that old thinking that
[1:38:31] old nature but God he wanted to give him
[1:38:35] something think about it when he was 99
[1:38:39] years old he was told that it was going
[1:38:42] to come from his loins it was an
[1:38:45] impossibility there was no way that this
[1:38:48] could have happened in his thinking but
[1:38:52] because God said so
[1:38:54] and he believed God he had he had this
[1:38:57] built up Faith to believe that God would
[1:39:01] confirm it time and time and time again
[1:39:04] every time he made a promise God was
[1:39:06] faithful it didn't necessarily go maybe
[1:39:08] the way he thought it would but God
[1:39:10] brought it to pass it's the same for
[1:39:14] us you know by these exceedingly
[1:39:17] precious promises we are partakers of
[1:39:19] divine divine nature to think the deity
[1:39:22] dwells in within each one of us and but
[1:39:25] God he wanted to have this token this
[1:39:29] you know I
[1:39:31] mean I don't know when I had my son and
[1:39:34] we were at the hospital and you know the
[1:39:36] circumcision you know that's that's kind
[1:39:38] of um you know it's one of those things
[1:39:40] that you know you know you just kind of
[1:39:44] you feel for the children but Abraham
[1:39:47] was
[1:39:48] 99 and but God he he's like I'm going to
[1:39:52] give you something
[1:39:54] that you can have as an
[1:39:56] evidence that you can know that you know
[1:39:58] that I'll fulfill my word it might be
[1:40:01] painful it might be hard you know God
[1:40:04] gave you a desire God gave me a desire
[1:40:06] to serve him but we can't serve him by
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:09] law it has to be by the heart that God
[1:40:13] gave us to believe all things are
[1:40:15] possible despite what we think right
[1:40:18] true and so he comes to this place now
[1:40:20] he's got this sign that he can point to
[1:40:23] and said God he made the promise to me
[1:40:26] that I would be I would have this and it
[1:40:29] was a further unfolding of what was
[1:40:31] promised in Genesis in in in in the
[1:40:34] garden how that that seedline would come
[1:40:38] praise God now God's unfolding a little
[1:40:40] bit more of what his plan
[1:40:42] was to bring
[1:40:45] Redemption he's like my okay so now this
[1:40:49] impossibility is going to come through
[1:40:51] me but now he can take and he can point
[1:40:54] to something just listen to how brother
[1:40:55] Bram talks about this in paragraph
[1:41:00] 62 he says now so after confirming I
[1:41:04] wish we had time but I made a promise
[1:41:08] and God and God gave Abraham the promise
[1:41:11] then he confirmed it when he gave him
[1:41:14] circumcision it was a sign it was in his
[1:41:17] flesh and now I'm speaking to a mixed
[1:41:20] audience and you regard me as your
[1:41:22] brother now when Abraham getting old and
[1:41:24] the Bible says his body was as good as
[1:41:27] dead he could not
[1:41:30] look he could look down to the sign in
[1:41:34] his flesh and know that it was God's
[1:41:37] token that he would keep his word
[1:41:41] circumcision look at that evidence says
[1:41:45] God made the
[1:41:46] promise Sarah says I'm 90 I'm far past
[1:41:51] the act of life but when Abraham turned
[1:41:54] and looked at the evidence that God said
[1:41:56] this is a token Abraham gave glory to
[1:41:59] God and being stronger than ever because
[1:42:03] it was a token a confirmation that God
[1:42:07] would Grant it to
[1:42:10] him amen and he promised that his
[1:42:14] children would soour in a Strange Land
[1:42:17] for 400 years amen I just started
[1:42:19] thinking about that and you know we we
[1:42:22] you know that's the spiritual type the
[1:42:24] circumcision is to cut away from the
[1:42:26] worldliness and the world you know and
[1:42:29] there's more to it than that but I mean
[1:42:31] if there's some things that are hanging
[1:42:32] on to you pray God God get that out of
[1:42:35] my
[1:42:37] life that's carnal my natural desires
[1:42:40] brought me to that place but I want you
[1:42:42] to circumcise my heart circumcise my
[1:42:46] life I want this token of life that's
[1:42:49] consecrated and devoted to the Messiah
[1:42:52] coming into manifestation in my
[1:42:55] life every time no doubt no doubt every
[1:43:00] time Abraham looked at it just like each
[1:43:02] one of
[1:43:03] us the trans the the change in our life
[1:43:07] to desire the things of the world to
[1:43:08] desire the things for godone that didn't
[1:43:10] come by us right I look back on what I
[1:43:14] was that wasn't my
[1:43:16] doing that was
[1:43:20] God that circumcision of God now now I
[1:43:23] can look back and I can say you know
[1:43:25] what that was God and if God started the
[1:43:28] work he's faithful if he started the
[1:43:32] work he's going to complete
[1:43:42] it
[1:43:45] m you know I got to thinking to is you
[1:43:48] know you think about confirmation and
[1:43:51] evidence you know when we look into the
[1:43:53] scripture we see that Moses you know
[1:43:55] this he was like okay this is going to
[1:43:57] be another part of it there your seed's
[1:43:59] going to sojourn in a Strange Land for
[1:44:00] 400 years but then I'll raise up raise
[1:44:03] him out of that with a mighty hand and
[1:44:05] Moses came he gave another confirmation
[1:44:07] that God's word is true and this was the
[1:44:09] faith seat of Abraham so they can see
[1:44:12] that God came again through his word by
[1:44:16] a pillar of fire and a prophet and he
[1:44:19] gave them the word of God
[1:44:28] you know and
[1:44:29] then I believe it was
[1:44:31] Joshua that was commissioned to take him
[1:44:34] over to the promised
[1:44:37] land you know and I believe is you know
[1:44:41] Joshua is a type of the Holy Ghost and
[1:44:44] Caleb was a type of the
[1:44:46] believer amen we just want to harmonize
[1:44:49] with the word of God the spirit of God
[1:44:51] that he can take us into the Promised
[1:44:52] Land amen what what is it for us we have
[1:44:55] to come to a maturity where we can look
[1:44:57] at our lives and see Christ that's what
[1:45:00] we're desire we want to look to see the
[1:45:02] character the nature of God manifesting
[1:45:05] in our decisions that he can come and
[1:45:08] harvest us one of these days I mean we
[1:45:10] look at the world they're they're coming
[1:45:12] to maturity they're coming to a harvest
[1:45:14] of a great bomb and a fire but praise
[1:45:17] God there's a people that are able to
[1:45:20] cut away cut away from the the things
[1:45:23] and see God he's uniting us amen
[1:45:26] thinking about that leadership of
[1:45:30] God there's a better
[1:45:32] land that's what Joshua and Caleb were
[1:45:34] saying come on this is the Promised Land
[1:45:36] This Is The Inheritance that God gave
[1:45:39] our Father Abraham there's a better land
[1:45:42] we don't have to stay in the nonsense we
[1:45:45] can cross
[1:45:46] over there's a kades barnea we need to
[1:45:49] cross over we need to die out to
[1:45:51] ourselves
[1:45:55] amen that Christ can be resurrected
[1:45:58] isn't that your desire it's my
[1:46:11] desire in 70 it says so they came out of
[1:46:15] Egypt and they came to a place called
[1:46:18] Kadesh barnea I believe it was along
[1:46:23] there Joshua the great warrior
[1:46:26] them when over they spied out the land
[1:46:29] and they crossed over Jordan and they
[1:46:31] went over to the land and came back with
[1:46:33] an evidence that it was a good land that
[1:46:35] God's word was perfect and his promises
[1:46:39] are true he had the evidence the
[1:46:42] confirmation that the land was there and
[1:46:45] he had a hold of something and the land
[1:46:48] was exactly what God promised it to be
[1:46:51] two men was packing a bunch of grapes
[1:46:53] and the people could taste and of it and
[1:46:56] see that the land was good it was a
[1:46:58] confirmation that God keeps his
[1:47:03] promise and he says then Israel crossed
[1:47:05] Jordan and went to the promised land and
[1:47:07] Joshua divided the lands for them and
[1:47:10] there was they were in peace they were a
[1:47:13] nation they had their churches they
[1:47:16] planted their crops they raised their
[1:47:17] children they took took them to church
[1:47:20] and they had happy lives they put fear
[1:47:23] in all the other nations they were a
[1:47:25] great
[1:47:26] people he says they all had to die
[1:47:29] regardless of the good land they were in
[1:47:32] and the good fruits that they were
[1:47:33] eating but they had to die then one
[1:47:38] day down came the great Chief Captain
[1:47:41] the Lord
[1:47:42] Jesus and he began to tell us of another
[1:47:46] land
[1:47:47] Hallelujah this doesn't get old to
[1:47:50] me you know this this is what this is
[1:47:53] the Cry of my heart and this is what I
[1:47:54] live every day for to see this come into
[1:47:57] a reality but God is giving us evidence
[1:48:01] he's giving a foraste amen he said in my
[1:48:04] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:48:06] were not so I would have told you I will
[1:48:09] go and prepare a place for you and come
[1:48:11] again to receive you unto myself that's
[1:48:15] where
[1:48:17] you that's where I am where you may be
[1:48:20] also and I love this he says in other
[1:48:23] words like this you have been real loyal
[1:48:27] to the cause but you have to die but
[1:48:30] there's a land that a man lives and
[1:48:33] don't
[1:48:34] die there's a life after death what a
[1:48:38] promise to the
[1:48:40] people oh
[1:48:42] my to think that this nightmare one day
[1:48:45] will be
[1:48:46] over and to think that there will be a
[1:48:49] life without end I mean it's painful
[1:48:52] sometimes we want to go to each one's
[1:48:54] house and have fellowship and different
[1:48:55] things but one
[1:48:57] day one day our heart's desire will be
[1:49:00] made known we'll realize it in
[1:49:02] Perfection
[1:49:08] amen but he came to this Kadesh barnea
[1:49:11] amen he says the Judgment seat was
[1:49:14] Kadesh barnea he came to Cades barnea
[1:49:18] Calvary where upon Him bore the sins of
[1:49:22] the world at
[1:49:24] Calvary but he crossed also the
[1:49:26] Jordan that we call Jordan of death he
[1:49:30] went over into that other land and was
[1:49:33] dead three days and nights he died Till
[1:49:36] The Sun quit shining he died till the
[1:49:38] Earth was so nervous a nervous breakdown
[1:49:42] he shook the rocks out of the mountains
[1:49:44] he died and on the third day he rose
[1:49:46] back again with the evidence that there
[1:49:49] is a land where a man can live and not
[1:49:52] die die he returned back from that Land
[1:49:56] There is a life after
[1:49:59] death if you didn't know that before
[1:50:02] this service there is a life after death
[1:50:05] yes
[1:50:08] sir now he says to his disciples go I am
[1:50:12] going to give you an Earnest of this I
[1:50:15] am going to give you a confirmation of
[1:50:17] this as they did to Abraham with
[1:50:21] circumcision but waiting wait up there
[1:50:24] at Jerusalem until you got the
[1:50:26] confirmation until you got the evidence
[1:50:29] they waited and on the 10th day they
[1:50:31] came a sound from heaven like a Russian
[1:50:33] Mighty Wind that filled the building
[1:50:36] their setting they were filled with the
[1:50:38] Holy Ghost Tong of tongues of fire sat
[1:50:42] upon them and they were filled and they
[1:50:43] began to speak in other tongues and the
[1:50:45] spirit gave them entance what is it it
[1:50:48] was the evidence that our Joshua
[1:50:50] Jehovah's savior had returned turn from
[1:50:53] the dead and give us the evidence that
[1:50:55] when we die we live again on the other
[1:50:59] side confirmation confirming given the
[1:51:03] evidence of it amen aren't you thankful
[1:51:06] for that you know when you look back in
[1:51:08] your life and you see all you were
[1:51:10] caught up in the bondage of the world
[1:51:12] the muck and the sin and everything and
[1:51:15] if God called you into the kingdom of
[1:51:17] his glorious son and he transferred that
[1:51:20] unrighteousness all of that sin and the
[1:51:22] way that we were and then he deposited
[1:51:25] his own very righteousness by faith amen
[1:51:28] and we know that we passed from Death to
[1:51:30] life we know that we've been translated
[1:51:32] into his kingdom oh if God has done that
[1:51:35] for us surely he can fulfill the rest of
[1:51:37] his word to bring us to that place
[1:51:43] amen
[1:51:46] amen I thought this was beautiful in
[1:51:49] paragraph 80 he says now I said
[1:51:54] unbelief do you do those things because
[1:51:56] you do not believe if you believe why
[1:51:59] then you wouldn't do them it's
[1:52:01] attributes of unbelief and righteousness
[1:52:04] is the attribute of Faith because you've
[1:52:07] anchored in that Faith a I just think
[1:52:11] about it you know if we just point to it
[1:52:13] you know God has given us faith that he
[1:52:15] can declare his righteousness in our
[1:52:17] lives that's something we want to point
[1:52:19] to today this day the Lord has made that
[1:52:22] he can declare his righteousness you
[1:52:25] know that's the drawing card in this
[1:52:27] hour you know we can point back and say
[1:52:29] all of the things that brother bandham
[1:52:31] did but you're the very fruit of this
[1:52:33] message that's right the attraction is
[1:52:36] the message the word of the hour is you
[1:52:39] living moving doing whether you're
[1:52:42] packaging in a warehouse whether you're
[1:52:43] mowing lawns it doesn't matter you are
[1:52:45] the
[1:52:47] attraction Christ is living in you
[1:52:52] we want to know what we're pointing at
[1:52:55] God wants to use Witnesses you know I
[1:52:57] was thinking about another message
[1:52:58] brother Brandon preached called path of
[1:53:00] life and it was in the morning to this
[1:53:03] this evening service but you know in in
[1:53:06] the scripture in in psalm 16 it says
[1:53:08] Thou will show me the path of life and
[1:53:11] in in thy presence is fullness of joy my
[1:53:15] think about it we we want to live in
[1:53:17] that presence of the Lord where there's
[1:53:19] fullness of joy but he said I will show
[1:53:22] the the path of life isn't that your
[1:53:25] desire to see the path of life to know
[1:53:29] what we're looking
[1:53:30] for I thought in that message it just
[1:53:33] helped me so
[1:53:35] much you know doing carpentry you know
[1:53:38] most of my adult life and he he began to
[1:53:42] talk about you know if if he was on the
[1:53:45] job and you know as as Witnesses and
[1:53:48] this is the subject matter we're turning
[1:53:49] to now just as witnesses to go into all
[1:53:52] the world and preach the gospel he he he
[1:53:54] said there's an approach you know we
[1:53:57] want to have witnesses we want to have
[1:54:00] converts we want we want people to be
[1:54:03] taken from the shackles of sin and
[1:54:05] sickness and sorrow but we want to have
[1:54:08] the right approach to to realize our
[1:54:11] desires amen and so brother Brown's
[1:54:13] talking about you know if I go on a job
[1:54:15] site or something like that and I'm
[1:54:16] paraphrasing but he's like there was a
[1:54:18] guy he's over there whacking his thumb
[1:54:20] and he's hammering away and but now I
[1:54:22] have this new Advanced I have something
[1:54:24] that's more advanced than what he's been
[1:54:26] working he's very skilled he's been
[1:54:28] doing this all of his life but every now
[1:54:30] and then he would
[1:54:31] just you know he would H Hammer his
[1:54:34] thumb or different things but he now
[1:54:36] brother Brown saying well this new
[1:54:38] advancement is this thing where he can
[1:54:39] slide a tag and so now he's got a
[1:54:42] nematic of sorts or some kind of
[1:54:44] different technology and this was back
[1:54:46] in the 60 I don't even know if they had
[1:54:47] it at the time but brother brandom's
[1:54:49] going through he says now if I approach
[1:54:52] him and say ah you ain't got nothing in
[1:54:54] it see what I can do and I wonder if
[1:54:56] that's the way we approach sometimes
[1:54:59] with people because we've been given so
[1:55:01] much you know but I want our lives to be
[1:55:04] effectual for the gospel I want to be
[1:55:07] able to approach him you know he said
[1:55:09] you know you get to just talking to them
[1:55:11] about what they what they have interest
[1:55:13] in you know the moment that we start
[1:55:16] getting out of our world and our cares
[1:55:18] and our concerns and our difficulties
[1:55:20] and get in someone else's world they
[1:55:21] begin to to see this there's a something
[1:55:24] genuine here and if there's something
[1:55:27] Desiring there that can respond
[1:55:30] back they'll ask they'll
[1:55:33] ask
[1:55:35] amen praise the Lord I'm so grateful for
[1:55:39] the
[1:55:40] message
[1:55:42] amen you know if you want
[1:55:46] to stand with me I'm going to invite the
[1:55:48] musicians to come and just wanted to uh
[1:55:53] share a few things that was on my heart
[1:55:55] and believe that as we pointed to a few
[1:55:58] things
[1:56:00] maybe you maybe say that I don't have
[1:56:04] this I don't have this evidence I don't
[1:56:07] have this confirmation in my heart but I
[1:56:10] desire it I desire a confirmation I I
[1:56:13] want to know that I'm anchored that that
[1:56:16] day when my name is called that all the
[1:56:22] the issues that maybe are unsettled or I
[1:56:26] don't want to have no questions when I
[1:56:27] get to that River Jordan and if every
[1:56:30] heart here would just bow your head and
[1:56:33] if it's just you and the lord it's just
[1:56:35] you and the Lord and if you know in your
[1:56:38] heart you want to say God I want that

[2:04:05] surrender
[2:04:07] all
[2:04:09] hallelujah amen is that your heart
[2:04:11] desire tonight man did you enjoy the
[2:04:13] word amen that's what what are you
[2:04:16] looking for amen I'm looking for his
[2:04:18] promise to be made true in me I'm
[2:04:21] looking for his manifestation in my
[2:04:24] flesh why do I look for that because he
[2:04:26] has given me the faith to believe that
[2:04:28] his word is true he has you know the
[2:04:31] scripture says happy are your eyes for
[2:04:33] the can see happy are your ears what is
[2:04:36] that God plac his faith in you so when
[2:04:40] you will hear the word you will believe
[2:04:43] and in believing his word he's going to
[2:04:45] bring the power of transformation in
[2:04:47] your life little by little it going to
[2:04:50] walk you up and and bring you into the
[2:04:53] manifestation of what he desires for you
[2:04:55] to be the flesh is going to fight that
[2:04:57] but that's all right but the promise is
[2:05:00] greater than what the flesh can do you
[2:05:02] know I thought about a brother just made
[2:05:04] a statement that just resonated he said
[2:05:06] Abraham's Journey of Faith and I thought
[2:05:10] the Journey of Faith look at him it took
[2:05:12] him to
[2:05:13] Egypt he made some mistakes it brought
[2:05:17] out uh
[2:05:19] Ishmael but the Journey of Faith finally
[2:05:22] took him to the promised son it didn't
[2:05:25] matter how many mistakes he made along
[2:05:27] the way but Faith was preserving him
[2:05:31] when he made a mistake his life was
[2:05:33] about to be taken Faith came on the sin
[2:05:36] and said no I made a promise to this
[2:05:38] person there's nothing you can do to him
[2:05:41] he's got to live because there's a
[2:05:43] promise that's got to come but whatam
[2:05:45] says that Abraham righteousness was
[2:05:48] because he judged God to be faithful He
[2:05:51] Who made the promise he judge him
[2:05:54] faithful that he's able to produce what
[2:05:56] he said he will do it wasn't because of
[2:05:59] Abraham's ability or anything what he
[2:06:02] said is God made a promise and I believe
[2:06:05] it and he's going to come to pass and
[2:06:07] it's going to come to pass as God said
[2:06:09] it now whatever else happened in between
[2:06:12] that didn't matter he hang on to the
[2:06:14] faith he believed God was faithful to
[2:06:17] bring forth his promise and at the end
[2:06:19] the promise was manifested and we are
[2:06:22] children of Abraham by the same faith
[2:06:25] not a different Faith a faith of those
[2:06:27] that are called out of sins and you know
[2:06:30] those of the Gentile that didn't know
[2:06:32] God and those came that came out of adul
[2:06:36] idolatry God will come and he'll give
[2:06:39] the promise and if we can hang on to the
[2:06:42] promise he will bring us to that same
[2:06:45] Journey regardless of what mistakes
[2:06:47] whatever the faith is going to hold you
[2:06:50] until the very end
[2:06:52] now remember he said faith is not hope
[2:06:55] so oh I I hope God is going to no faith
[2:06:59] is something that anchors into the heart
[2:07:01] I don't know how it's going to do it I
[2:07:03] don't know when it's going to do it
[2:07:05] something within my heart tells me this
[2:07:07] word is true something within my heart
[2:07:10] can show me that I'm not what I used to
[2:07:13] be when I believed that something
[2:07:16] happened I don't know how it happened
[2:07:18] all I know is I'm not what I used to be
[2:07:21] I'm something something different and by
[2:07:22] the same token I know he's taking me
[2:07:26] somewhere the faith of Abraham he hang
[2:07:29] on and you believe God that is's true
[2:07:31] and faithful who he who made the promise
[2:07:34] will come into past Amen brother
