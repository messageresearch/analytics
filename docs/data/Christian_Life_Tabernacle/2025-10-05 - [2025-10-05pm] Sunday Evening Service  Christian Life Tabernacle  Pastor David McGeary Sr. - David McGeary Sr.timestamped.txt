[21:29] upon your heart, just lead to hand up to
[21:30] him. the brothers that are taking the
[21:32] offerings if you could come at this
[21:33] time. By the way, if you could just come
[21:35] and take this needs before the church,
[21:45] wonderful father, Lord Jesus,
[21:49] so thankful, Lord, to know that you're
[21:51] still the God that answers prayers, Lord
[21:53] Jesus.
[21:55] With all that goes on in this world, the
[21:57] chaos and turmoil, Lord Jesus, you still
[22:01] show up on time. Father,
[22:04] moved in my heart, Lord Jesus.
[22:08] There's no ground we can stand on made
[22:10] by man, Lord Jesus,
[22:13] for it's not a firm foundation, Lord.
[22:17] But you've told us to stand on you, Lord
[22:20] Jesus, the solid rock. All of the ground
[22:24] is sinking sand, Lord Jesus.
[22:27] As your children have gathered in your
[22:29] house tonight, Lord Jesus, on this
[22:31] communion night, the sacrifice that was
[22:33] made to be here, Lord Jesus.
[22:36] Father, I pray a special blessing may be
[22:38] given to each one, Lord, that sacrifice
[22:41] to be here, Father. And for those that
[22:44] had a desire to be here but couldn't
[22:46] make it here, whether it was by means,
[22:48] Lord Jesus, or wellness and body, Lord,
[22:52] Father, I pray a special blessing
[22:54] towards them, Lord Jesus.
[22:57] For your prophet said a desire to serve
[22:59] you is greater than anything the devil
[23:02] has to offer. And if a heart desires to
[23:04] be in your house, Lord, it's your
[23:07] promise for them to be here, Lord Jesus.
[23:10] Father, I pray you open up paths and
[23:12] ways that they might be able to enter
[23:14] into this house when the doors are open.
[23:16] Father, it's a special time when we
[23:18] gather together. Lord,
[23:21] prayers are answered, deliverance comes
[23:23] forth, healing is given,
[23:26] souls are saved, Lord Jesus.
[23:29] Father, we don't want to get too
[23:31] comfortable, Lord Jesus, to accustomed
[23:33] to moments like these, Lord.
[23:36] At any given moment, it could be the
[23:38] last one. Lord Jesus, we may not make it
[23:41] past the end of this service. Lord
[23:42] Jesus, if we had our hearts exactly like
[23:45] those of our fathers who were earnestly
[23:48] expecting for you to come at any moment,
[23:50] Father, lived every day with the hope
[23:53] that you'd be coming back in their time,
[23:55] Lord Jesus. But because of your prophet,
[23:58] we know it's in this hour, Lord, that
[24:00] you will make your return, Father. Lord,
[24:03] how much more are our hearts hungering
[24:04] and thirsting to see your coming, Lord
[24:06] Jesus, to take us so that we can go with
[24:09] you, Lord.
[24:11] Father,
[24:13] open up our hearts, Lord Jesus. Let us
[24:16] lay aside all weights, Lord Jesus.
[24:19] Anger, strife, disagreements,
[24:22] bitterness, Lord Jesus, that doesn't
[24:25] belong in our hearts, Lord Jesus. It
[24:27] doesn't belong around us, Father. Have
[24:30] your way in the service, Lord Jesus.
[24:32] I pray for our pastor, Lord, who gets
[24:34] ready to bring forth the word, Lord
[24:36] Jesus.
[24:38] Bless him, Lord Jesus. And for the
[24:40] tithes and offerings, Lord, I pray a
[24:42] special blessing over them. Bless the
[24:44] hands that have given, Father. And for
[24:46] those that desire, we heard you. Grant
[24:49] jobs, Lord. Grant jobs to those that
[24:51] have a heart to give but aren't able to,
[24:53] Lord, that they might be able to give.
[24:55] Father, we thank you. We leave the
[24:58] remainder of the service into your hands
[25:00] asking you to have the preeminence.
[25:02] Lord, you saw every lifted hand, Lord
[25:04] Jesus. Father, may all hands that were
[25:07] lifted leave with an answer, Lord Jesus.
[25:10] There's nothing too great for you,
[25:11] Father. One word that touches one person
[25:14] touches another in a different way. I
[25:17] truly believe from the bottom of my
[25:18] heart that every person can leave here
[25:20] changed. Father, just have your way.
[25:23] Father, we leave our own man's
[25:25] expectation out the way and we leave the
[25:26] room for the word to have its way. Do
[25:29] what you see fit. Father, we ask this in
[25:32] your precious, mighty, and wonderful
[25:33] name. Amen.
[25:39] And we'll we'll have a baptism. Let's
[25:42] just sing that as we get ready for the
[25:44] baptism tonight. I know who I am.
[25:52] I know who you are.
[25:57] Oh, the cross of salvation
[26:03] was all in her side.
[26:09] Now I am chosen,
[26:14] free and forgiven.
[26:19] Oh, when I have a future
[26:25] and it's worth delivering.
[26:33] I was an angel
[26:35] stand in the grave. I was called by him.
[26:41] Born raised back to life.
[26:46] I was made for more.
[26:55] Why would I make a bed in my shame when
[27:00] the fountain of
[27:03] is running my way? I know I am yours.
[27:09] I was made.
[27:13] [Music]
[27:15] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a great blessing that
[27:18] goes with baptism.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; And that's what I like about being
[27:25] every time someone gets baptized, I get
[27:29] &gt;&gt; you know, we can truly say, enter into
[27:33] the joy of the Lord.
[27:36] and our brothers chose to be baptism at
[27:40] his own accord. He's prayed through.
[27:43] He's thought about it. He went through
[27:46] all the man baptist and he decided he
[27:49] wanted to give his heart to the
[27:53] &gt;&gt; give a quick testimony
[27:56] then we'll baptize.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; First thing I want to say, thank you
[28:02] Lord Jesus Christ for the blessing for
[28:04] let me give my life to him.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Uh I've been thinking about it for a
[28:11] long time. My mom has been asking me for
[28:14] a long time as well. And I just um want
[28:19] to say that I will try to be the best
[28:22] and we're all human. We all make
[28:24] mistakes. But um I just want to be the
[28:27] best um soldier of God possible.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; So thank you for all the blessings. I
[28:33] praise God more than I can count. I
[28:37] think for God's
[28:41] &gt;&gt; that's the way you approach it, isn't
[28:43] it?
[28:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be the best soldier.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; That I can
[28:49] Let's read in our scriptures.
[28:51] It says, "Therefore, let all the house
[28:53] of Israel know assuredly that God hath
[28:58] made the same Jesus, whom he hath
[29:01] crucified, both Lord and Christ." Now
[29:05] when they heard this, they were
[29:07] pricricked in their hearts and said unto
[29:09] Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men
[29:12] and brethren, what shall we do?" Then
[29:16] Peter said unto them, "Repent
[29:18] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[29:22] the name of Jesus Christ, for the
[29:24] remission of sins, and you shall receive
[29:27] the gift of the Holy Ghost. For this
[29:31] promise is unto you and to your
[29:34] children, and to all that are a far off,
[29:38] even as many as our Lord God shall
[29:42] call." And with many other words did he
[29:45] testify and exhort, saying, "Save
[29:47] yourselves from this up towards
[29:50] generation." And they that gladly
[29:53] received his word were baptized. And the
[29:57] same day they were added unto them about
[30:00] 3,000 souls. and their and they
[30:03] continued steadfastly
[30:06] in the apostles doctrine and fellowship
[30:09] and the breaking of bread in and in
[30:13] pray.
[30:15] Amen.
[30:17] So, we're going to baptize our brother.
[30:20] He said, "Why did we decide right to
[30:22] baptize him in the middle of song
[30:24] service?" because I wanted him to have
[30:26] communion baptizing
[30:31] it. And after we baptize him, I think
[30:34] brother,
[30:36] we have a lot of good things ahead of us
[30:40] this evening. You believe that?
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Believe he loves you. Amen. Brother,
[30:47] it's going to be a privilege to baptize
[30:49] you. As we heard in the word, we're
[30:51] carrying out the word.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're perfor actually performing
[30:56] exactly what the word told us to do.
[30:59] We've went into all the world and we've
[31:01] preached the gospel and you've heard the
[31:04] gospel and we're baptizing you in the
[31:07] name of the father, the son, and the
[31:09] holy ghost which by divine revelation
[31:12] and Peter having the keys to the kingdom
[31:16] said that name was the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:19] and according to the word of God
[31:21] according to your testimony we baptize
[31:24] you for the remission of your sins that
[31:27] you might receive the Holy Ghost.
[31:29] So we baptize you in the name of the
[31:32] Lord Jesus Christ.
[31:35] [Music]
[31:37] [Applause]
[32:04] Amen. Um, brother Jeff had a request as
[32:08] is he's in desperate need of a job and
[32:11] we just want to pray that the Lord will
[32:13] grant him one. Amen. I know we just read
[32:16] a testimony about this morning of one
[32:19] that got a job and this afternoon about
[32:21] one and I believe the Lord will do that.
[32:24] Amen. Let's just bow heads. Gracious
[32:25] Father, you said that whatever we had
[32:29] need of, Lord, that you will provide.
[32:31] You said that look at the flowers, look
[32:33] at the little bird, Lord, Father, if you
[32:35] provided them, how much more us, Lord,
[32:38] that are created in your image. We pray,
[32:40] Lord, that you may just grant off the
[32:42] brother what he has need of, Lord, in
[32:45] order for him to live. And we commit him
[32:47] into your hands and ask this in the name
[32:50] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

[34:05] was on Christmas.

[34:40] was called by him
[34:44] and respect to life
[34:48] who I was made for.
[34:52] [Music]
[34:57] Why would I think of letting my shame

[40:16] For if you pass me this place
[40:21] I'll surely die.
[40:26] If it's possible,

[41:08] For you, oh God,
[41:11] I am with you. It's only to bring out my
[41:16] life through you. Some through the
[41:19] waters, some through the flood, some
[41:23] through the fires, but all through the
[41:26] blood. You run for the price. Refuse to
[41:31] compromise.
[41:33] At the end of the line, your reward is
[41:36] Christ.
[41:39] Run for the price.
[41:42] Oh Lord, we run for the price.
[41:49] When Satan comes to move you from your
[41:54] place,
[41:58] you will know
[42:00] that your mighty God will fight for you.
[42:07] And you will say, Satan, none of these
[42:10] things can move me.
[42:16] Neither God my life
[42:20] did
[42:21] to me.
[42:25] So you will finish your cause with joy
[42:29] which you receive
[42:32] of the Lord.
[42:35] You will testify of his grace and sweet
[42:40] love
[42:41] to you.
[42:46] You thank him for his grace.
[42:52] For he is your God
[42:55] and is with you. It's only to bring out
[42:59] his life through you. Some through the
[43:02] waters, some through the flood, some
[43:06] through the fire, but all through the
[43:09] blood. We run for the price. We shall
[43:13] not compromise.
[43:16] At the end of the line, our reward is
[43:18] Christ.
[43:21] Run for the price.

[47:45] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[47:47] &gt;&gt; yes, Lord,
[47:49] &gt;&gt; you died for your
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters,
[47:54] your friends,
[47:56] your kinsmen,
[47:59] those you knew who you were going to
[48:00] spend eternity with. We're so grateful
[48:04] for that this evening. We ask, Father,
[48:07] that you would continue to set our
[48:09] hearts on fire,
[48:11] Lord, that we would take hold of the
[48:13] commission
[48:15] to go share with the world what that you
[48:17] have done for us, knowing that you are
[48:21] life, you are hope.
[48:25] You are our salvation
[48:28] out of this dying world. and that on
[48:31] soon you'll come to receive us that we
[48:35] can be where you are also. We ask you to
[48:38] bless us tonight in Jesus precious and
[48:43] wonderful name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[48:48] God bless you. Let's open our Bibles
[48:50] this evening to the book of Corinthians
[48:54] in the 11th chapter and the 23rd verse.
[49:00] You know, it's
[49:02] it's so good to
[49:04] uh do the word of God even with
[49:07] footwashing. He told us, he said, "If
[49:09] you do these things, happy are you." A
[49:13] amen. So, uh I I'm just so grateful to
[49:16] do this this evening because it makes me
[49:19] happy. And you say, "Well, why does it
[49:21] make you happy?" Because the word said
[49:24] it would make me happy. And that settles
[49:27] it, right? God said so.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; That settles it.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's read here together. For
[49:34] I have received of the Lord that which
[49:37] also I delivered unto you, that the Lord
[49:40] Jesus the same night in which he took
[49:45] he was betrayed, took bread, and when he
[49:49] had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[49:52] "Take, eat. This is my body which is
[49:56] broken for you. This do in remembrance
[49:59] of me. And after the same manner also he
[50:03] took the cup when he had sucked, saying,
[50:06] "This cup is the new testament in my
[50:11] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[50:15] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[50:19] you eat this bread and drink this cup,
[50:21] you do show the Lord's death till he
[50:23] come.
[50:25] Wherefore whosoever shall eateth this
[50:27] bread and drinkkeeth this cup of the
[50:29] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[50:32] body and blood of the Lord. But let a
[50:36] man examine himself, and so let him eat
[50:39] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[50:43] he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily
[50:45] shall eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[50:48] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[50:51] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[50:54] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[50:57] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[51:00] judged.
[51:02] But when we are judged, we are chastened
[51:05] of the Lord, that we should not be
[51:09] condemned with the world. Wherefore, my
[51:12] brother, when you come together to eat,
[51:14] tear one for another, and if any man
[51:17] hunger, let him eat at home, that ye
[51:20] come not together unto condemnation, and
[51:23] the rest will I set in order when I
[51:26] come. Amen. What a a wonderful
[51:29] opportunity. You know, our messenger
[51:32] spoke a lot of things about communion
[51:36] and it, you know, it's actually getting
[51:40] to a place where people aren't having
[51:43] communion anymore and they're not having
[51:46] footwashing anymore. But I'm glad that
[51:50] we can read it in the word and we can
[51:53] perform it and have the blessings of it.
[51:58] So God bless you if the brothers would
[52:00] come at this time.
[52:18] And as we pray, you pray. If you have a
[52:21] petition, make it known to the Lord. You
[52:25] know, there's deliverance in communion.
[52:28] There's healing in communion
[52:33] you and he sees you fulfilling his word
[52:37] and he knows what you have need of
[52:40] &gt;&gt; and he'll pass that blessing onto you.
[52:42] He really cares for us
[52:45] &gt;&gt; and that's what's wonderful.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; He really wants the best for us
[52:50] &gt;&gt; and he's here to fight
[52:52] and so let us let us
[52:56] scripture says for another. Let us hold
[52:59] each other up in faith that God can do
[53:02] for us exceedingly and abundantly even
[53:05] above that which we can ask or think.
[53:08] Our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we
[53:11] look upon communion this evening. We see
[53:15] this broken bread,
[53:18] Lord, representing your body. And
[53:21] Father, a body that we're all members of
[53:25] in particular, Father, that you're the
[53:28] head of and Father, we take communion
[53:31] signifying that we're a part of this
[53:33] body. We bear the burdens of the body
[53:38] and we nourish one another as the body,
[53:42] each member in particular nourishes the
[53:45] other.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Father, as we heard this morning that
[53:50] your bread is spiritual food, Father,
[53:55] it's meant to be taken and eaten. And as
[53:59] you said, this is my body. I take, eat.
[54:03] And Father, it's the New Testament. And
[54:05] Father, we know that it's food indeed.
[54:08] And we're so grateful, Father. And
[54:11] Father, the cups that represent your
[54:13] blood that was shed for the remission of
[54:16] our sins that the life and the blood
[54:19] could return back on the believer.
[54:22] Father, we're so grateful for that. And
[54:24] now we ask you to bless it to us,
[54:27] Father, as each of us come take
[54:29] communion individually,
[54:32] fellowshipping with you,
[54:34] laying our burdens at your feet, knowing
[54:38] that you care for us. And Father, we
[54:41] desire to care for you. We ask you to
[54:44] bless us now this evening in Jesus
[54:47] precious name we pray. Amen. Bless you,
[54:51] musicians.
[55:20] [Music]
[55:24] God bless you. May come take communion
[55:26] as you feel led. God bless you.

[1:05:44] Amen.
[1:05:45] Let's stand together. We'll read it. Can
[1:05:48] we sing that song? I think you were
[1:05:50] playing it early. Jesus is here.
[1:05:53] The first
[1:05:56] Amen. You believe that?
[1:05:59] You say, "Well, I don't feel him. He
[1:06:01] said he'd be here.
[1:06:04] [Music]
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe if you just look for him or ask
[1:06:10] him to make himself known to you.
[1:06:15] You know, our prophet preached. He said
[1:06:18] that you'll get what you expect.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, he said
[1:06:23] there'll plenty to criticize.
[1:06:27] Amen. But if you come to touch him, his
[1:06:30] garment is here to be touched. Do you
[1:06:33] believe that?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing this as we prepare
[1:06:39] our hearts.
[1:06:45] Oh, how do you explain?
[1:06:52] How do you cry?
[1:06:58] A love that goes from east to west.
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:17] Oh, you know all our fears
[1:07:22] [Music]
[1:07:24] and words cannot express the love we
[1:07:28] feel but we long for you to hear.
[1:07:36] So listen to our hearts.
[1:07:43] Hear our spirit.
[1:07:49] A song of praise and
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:55] from those who have redeemed.
[1:08:02] We will use the words we know
[1:08:07] to tell you what
[1:08:10] awome God you are.
[1:08:15] The words are not enough.
[1:08:21] Listen to my heart.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; If words can fall, I pray
[1:08:34] from these.
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:40] And if I had a thousand years,
[1:08:46] I would still run out of time.
[1:08:53] If you listen to my heart
[1:09:00] every
[1:09:01] sing,
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:09] thank you for the truth.
[1:09:12] Thank you for the way.
[1:09:18] Listen to our hearts.
[1:09:23] [Music]
[1:09:25] Hear our spirit sing.
[1:09:31] See our praise and flow
[1:09:37] from those who have redeemed.
[1:09:44] We will use the words we love.
[1:09:48] to tell you what an awesome God
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; that one that says sickness can't be
[1:10:09] with us any longer. I think that's
[1:10:11] called Jesus is here.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Healing's here. How many believes that?
[1:10:19] Amen. Every part that he has to offer is
[1:10:23] here because he's the same yesterday,
[1:10:27] today, and forever.
[1:10:31] You know, you you don't know how great
[1:10:34] the love of God was. We had our youth
[1:10:36] meeting just here
[1:10:39] uh I guess just a month or so ago.
[1:10:45] This weekend,
[1:10:48] Brother Andrew went to Colorado to
[1:10:50] preach the funeral
[1:10:54] of a 15year-old boy, I believe. Right,
[1:10:56] Andrew?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; 16.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; He had turned 16 in August.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Just turned 16 years old in August.
[1:11:10] And some people called him out of his
[1:11:11] house and he
[1:11:14] went out of his house and they shot him
[1:11:15] dead,
[1:11:18] 15 years old.
[1:11:22] He was here for our youth meetings
[1:11:25] and now he's no more
[1:11:27] with us in this life. I just pray to God
[1:11:31] that something down in those meetings
[1:11:34] anchored in his heart.
[1:11:41] But we know he's here to heal.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; We know he's here to deliver.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; And I think if we could ever be so
[1:11:50] conscious, the prophet of God said that
[1:11:52] people do the things they do because
[1:11:55] they feel they're out of the presence of
[1:11:57] the Lord.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; But how much more would it be for us if
[1:12:01] we could recognize that presence?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. and recognize he's here to
[1:12:08] do for us exceedingly and abundantly
[1:12:11] above what we could ever ask or think.
[1:12:15] He's here to bear your burdens. He's
[1:12:18] here to break the chains. He's here to
[1:12:21] answer the questions of your heart. He's
[1:12:24] here to throw our sins in the sea of
[1:12:26] God's forgetfulness.
[1:12:30] He's here to let us know he's here.
[1:12:35] and he's here for you.
[1:12:40] Proble God said he could have bypassed
[1:12:44] coming to this earth.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to come down here and
[1:12:49] die.
[1:12:52] But he came here so that we would have
[1:12:57] a sacrifice.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; For our sins.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:03] that our accountability
[1:13:07] fell on him.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be accountable for their
[1:13:12] sins. I'll take the punishment for their
[1:13:14] sins. I'll pay the price."
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; For their sins.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Let it all fall upon me.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Just think of it.
[1:13:25] And then he comes to back in in our
[1:13:29] midst and he says, "I'm here to lead you
[1:13:31] and guide you into all truth and
[1:13:33] righteousness. I'll for not forsake you,
[1:13:38] but I'll come again.
[1:13:40] I will not leave you comfortless, but
[1:13:43] I'll come again and I'll be with you
[1:13:45] even in you till the end." He's here.
[1:13:50] Let's just sing this knowing that he's
[1:13:54] here. And let's before we wash one
[1:13:57] another's feet, let's just invite him
[1:13:59] into our heart. That the love of God
[1:14:02] would flow amongst ourselves one to
[1:14:05] another. And that he said that he'd
[1:14:08] rather see us love one another.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Then love him.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:19:18] I trust you.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; As we read in the 13th chapter of the
[1:19:32] Gospel of St. John.
[1:19:35] Now before the feast of the Passover,
[1:19:39] when Jesus knew that his hour was come,
[1:19:42] that he should depart out of this world
[1:19:46] unto the Father.
[1:19:49] Having loved his own which were in the
[1:19:51] world, he loved them until the end. And
[1:19:56] supper being ended, the devil having now
[1:19:59] put it into the heart of Judas's
[1:20:02] Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him.
[1:20:06] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[1:20:10] all things into his hands and that he
[1:20:14] was come from God and went to God. And
[1:20:19] he raised from supper
[1:20:22] and laid aside his garment and took a
[1:20:25] towel and girdeth himself.
[1:20:28] And after that he pth water into a basin
[1:20:33] and begin to wash the disciples feet and
[1:20:37] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:20:41] was girded.
[1:20:43] Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter
[1:20:46] said unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[1:20:50] feet?
[1:20:52] Jesus answered
[1:20:54] and said unto him, "What I do, thou
[1:20:58] knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:21:03] know hereafter."
[1:21:05] Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never
[1:21:08] wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I
[1:21:12] wash thee not, thou hast no part with
[1:21:16] me." Peter changed his tune.
[1:21:21] Simon Peter said unto him,"Lord, not my
[1:21:23] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:21:26] head."
[1:21:27] Jesus said to him, "He that is washed
[1:21:30] needeth not safe to wash his feet, but
[1:21:34] is clean everywhere.
[1:21:36] And ye are clean, but not all." For he
[1:21:41] knew who should betray him. Therefore
[1:21:43] said he, "Ye are not all clean."
[1:21:47] So after he had washed their feet and
[1:21:50] taken his garments and was set down
[1:21:52] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:21:56] I have done to you? You call me Master
[1:22:00] and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am.
[1:22:06] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:22:09] washed your feet, you ought you also
[1:22:14] ought to wash one another's feet. For I
[1:22:17] have given you an example that ye should
[1:22:20] do as I have done to you. Verily,
[1:22:25] verily, I say unto you, the servant is
[1:22:27] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[1:22:31] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:22:34] him. If you know these things, happy are
[1:22:38] ye if you do them. Isn't footwashing so
[1:22:43] amazingly plain?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; And yet it's such a hard thing for man
[1:22:48] to do and this modern generation. But
[1:22:52] I'm glad we can wash one another's feet.
[1:22:55] God bless you, sisters. Go to your
[1:22:57] places. Help with the children.
[1:23:00] Brothers will prepare for here. Thank
[1:23:02] you.
