========================================

you know so you know if you want your leadership to be based on being the best or career you know I guess you can from my perspective knock yourself out but I was kind of looking for something higher than that you know so here I am trying to do this exercise and I've been given these blanks that I can fill in and all I can think of are you know Be not Afraid only believe um lean not unto your own understanding be followers of me thus saith the Lord you know there's a whole book written on daring leadership and all I could think about how it's summed up in one scripture that Jesus said I do nothing unless he shows me first you know Micah 6 8 says he hath shown the o man what is good and what the lord requires of thee but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly before thy God so I was thinking about all of this as I was reading the Psalms this week which honestly is a far more effective book on leadership but I was reading chapter 26 we're going to read that this morning you know David speaks twice about walking in his integrity he says it in verse 1 I have walked in my integrity and again in verse 11 I will walk in mine integrity and you know on the surface it would seem like this is all about David's own values kind of similar to the exercise that we were going through at work but you know just as you know they would try to make leadership about their own values it would almost seem like David is saying look I I have walked in my Integrity I have made this all about my Integrity right but but this isn't about David deciding what his values are like they do in this leadership class if you look at that in verse one it says for I have walked in mine integrity and then there's a semicolon and he's going to Define what walking in his Integrity looks like it says I have trusted also in the Lord therefore as a result I shall not slide or as the song says I shall not be moved why is this because it's not defining his own course he's not defining his own values or his own definition of right or wrong which is a tree of knowledge stuff but his walk of integrity was based on trusting in the Lord and as a result he would not be moved you know what's so interesting about these man-made leadership values that they run us through is people change them you know circumstances change life events change and all of a sudden their values change or more importantly what they thought were their values becomes made known whenever they go through a certain circumstance and it's not really what they thought it was but this kind of leadership is I will not slide I will not move my walk will not change my values don't change when the circumstances change verse 11 it says but as for me I will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be merciful to me David walking in mine Integrity requires a Redemption it requires a purchase it requires someone to be merciful not me defining my values you know what is the basis for his leadership verse two examine Me O Lord and prove me try my Reigns and my heart you know being led involves someone inspecting him trying him proving him testing what's influencing him and what his desires are that's being led by the spirit by that word it says in verse 3 I have walked in thy truth if you remember when Brother David was reading the other day John 17 there was a statement that Jesus made he said Thy word is truth you know this is just David describing how he is Led what walking in his Integrity looks like John 16 13 says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself naming his own values but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you know it's uh I love how David sums it all up you know as we read this it really doesn't the thing that occurred to me as I was going through this exercise is it doesn't really matter what my values are they're probably getting in his way if you want to go ahead and stand you know though I love how David sets sums it up in verse 7 in verse 12 12. he says my foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will I bless the Lord you know as I read that I thought of some of the other statements that are made in the Psalms and the Proverbs it says lean not unto thy known understanding but in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths and then David once said in Psalm 40 you know he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of a Mirey clay all of my values all the things I used to be led by and set my feet upon a rock and established my Goings my foot is in an even place you know I don't know about you this morning but I'm grateful that I find myself in an even place that my goings have been established I shall not slide I will walk in his truth which is also my integrity and I have no idea how I'm going to write this in this my this values exercise maybe I just put psalm 26. but you know have your goings been established this morning right do you find yourself in an even place you know for me that's our leadership value at least it's my leadership value and uh we'll see if I pass the course or not but let's go ahead and read Psalm 26 together Judge Me O Lord for I have walked in mine Integrity I have trusted also in the Lord therefore I shall not slide examine Me O Lord and prove me try my Reigns and my heart for thy loving kindness is before mine eyes and I have walked in thy truth I have not sat with vain persons neither will I go in with dissemblers I have hated the congregation of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked I will wash mine hands and innocency so will I Compass thine altar O Lord that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous Works Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwelleth gather not my soul with Sinners nor my life with bloody men in whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of bribes but as for me I will walk in mine Integrity redeem me and be merciful unto me my foot standeth and even place in the congregations will I bless the Lord amen God bless you may have

this morning Lord we ask you it's your presence be our portion we ask that we would leave this morning encouraged uplifted with purpose in our heart with Assurance Lord knowing that if you before us who can be against us Lord with the promise held deep in our lives that nothing can pluck us out of the palm of your hands father May our personal relationship with you grow Lord may we know assuredly

daughter-in-law and so does that help all right I can't get off with that it's in a nichia or something What in chowski I all right now you don't expect me to pronounce that right but anyway Chase and

so much and the Lord be with you good to see you sis God's going to be good for you Hallelujah God bless you amen thank you musicians God bless you this morning we have maybe a little different uh service than normal today but we just trust that through it all it would be a blessing I I certainly I had to say that I sat in my office just having a good time about brother Mike's a little exhortation this morning and I thought if he put the primary values that you don't lead your life and I just thought him writing Holy Spirit bible message of the hour Mike would be praying for employment this morning but but we know the god that watches over us don't we he controls all things you know I remember the first time I ever got fired you know that was really a shock to me and the guy said we don't really need you more anymore and I thought you know what I I probably I fired a few people in my time and I guess I need to get what I let uh you know reap what I sow I told one guy he looked better going than he did coming and so this guy let me know and that's pretty discouraged you know it was more my ego that was hurting anything you know I was I was talented and I knew that I knew electrical work and I finally got done I thought well Lord you know I was looking for a job when I found this one and I know you'll take care of me and isn't that really what it all falls back into is that if God don't watch the city The Watchman watches me and nothing can pluck you out of the poem of God's hands to answer a few questions this morning that I've already got 10 answers for questions about what are all those ditches doing out there well that's all part of the foundation of the church building and that is what they call a post-tensions lab and what happens with all those niches there's cables that run from one end of the ditch to the other they run as you notice they crisscross and if you really look at it it looks like a big waffle and that's why they call it a waffle slab or a post-tension slab and what happens is they fill all those ditches with concrete and then they fill the top smooth and then those cables they put a machine on those cables and they put tension on those cables so it pulls the whole slab together and then they let it cure for a while and they come again and they put tension on it again or what we refer as stress so we have pre-stressed and post stress and at the end of it all those cables pull that slab together and then now that slab moves with the ground so it's not put on Piers which is a different form of slab but because the slab's so big they decided to make it stiffer so it's not real hard concrete it's real stiff and it moves as one slab and then the little Place between the two buildings that's poured absolutely separate and then that moves on its own between two slabs so I don't know if you know it but the very ground that you're sitting on this morning is moving underneath you amen and but that's that's what's going on out there and I hope my drone flyer can get up and take some pictures of it and post it up on the internet for you and if you'll pray for the weather and pray for the people that are pouring the concrete because it's real important that they do a good job I it's very difficult to control it you have to put Trust in somebody to do it and we've got the best price we could and to save us some money and so by next Sunday morning we are praying by the grace of God that that'll be poured so when you come back you'll see a slab and if the Lord continues to bless us we trust by the end of April that it'll all be framed up the walls will all be on it and the roof will be on it and that's going to take some help from some of the Brethren and we just trust that uh they will um it'll be our uh the grace of mercy of God that we just get that part of it done and so once we have the roof on it and it framed up then we'll start bricking it and then the people we can start putting the electrical in and and uh air conditioning the Plumbing's already in that's the white pipes you see sitting up so if you look at it that one group of white pipes on the far side where you park that's the men's bathroom this little group of pipes right up here is the woman's bathroom there's another group of pipes back in this corner that's the bathroom in my office and then there's a little hall bath there that we use and then the baptismal so again the church layout is very similar to this it's just wider on each side and and then our baptistry will be in the same place we're trying to make it as familiar as we can of our transition and we just trust it'll be better another thing we'd like to uh mention to you this morning if you notice there's a little teeny Pew that sits in the foyer the reason that peel is there is that is the uh um I don't know what do you call example or prototype or a sample of what the pews are going to be so I don't know if you've had an opportunity to sit on it or not we're getting the extra padding we're getting the Lombard support so if you get a chance just sit in that take turns sitting at it see how you like it and so the cost that put the pews in the church is about seventy thousand dollars uh we're working on that because the price of lumber has come down so we're going to try to negotiate the best price that we can on the on the pews but so we'll have seating for about 420 if we get all the pews and that's allowing three feet between hpu so that's plenty of room I mean you'll you'll love the room um you this isn't as crowd as it used to be you know we used to we had four more pews in this room alone before before we opened up the Overflow so um anyway so what we want to do is make you aware of somebody said they did the math for me and they said well that's comes out to about uh 200 dollars a seat and I thought well I didn't know I didn't check the math but so just just so you know that you're at least worth 200 bucks okay so that that's the space of each Pew so anyway what we're going to do is we're just going to open up a uh some little type of I think we're just going to take that white bucket out there and and we're just going to open up the ability for those that want to give Beyond and above what they're giving now so it doesn't help us if you just change your offering to pews or whatever that you give then we're still in the same boat but if you want to give just a few dollars extra ear Mark for pews then we'll just hope that we can kind of get that price down by the time we need them so uh we we wanted to Target certain things that we could do and uh so this is one of the things that we can Target altogether is say well I'm going to give ten dollars towards the pews so here's my building fund money here's my offering money here's this and then uh and this is for that and so you know I I don't talk to you a lot about money but I we the trustees and us had a meeting the other day and we discussed it and they thought it would be a good thing that the people would like to know and it's something that they could participate in so we're we're gratefully wonderful uh for that this morning and uh we just trust that the Lord will be our portion this morning so this morning we're going to start uh just a little uh if we could call it a Bible study or just going through the scriptures and there's there's there's two uh purposes that this is on my heart to to approach it the way that I'm approaching it and the reason for it is is I want you to um fall in love with your Bibles the Bible is wonderful reading it it's a joy and it's really something that you should participate in every day of your life and then learn to study the scriptures it's scriptural to study the scriptures you know what I mean Paul told Timothy study the scriptures to show yourself approved our messenger told us we should read our Bible and pray every day if you want to be spiritual and so the the Bible's full of Wonders uh is full of History uh it it's it's uh it is the summon substance of everything that we are is the scriptures now there was Revelation hid in this Bible that no man could see until God sent a messenger to open up those things which were hid in the Bible he himself thought that maybe these things would be something outside of the scriptures and he was honest about that he said I I was looking that it would be maybe something but then he came back to realize that it wasn't outside of the scriptures it was kid in the scripture but no man could see it a very similar if I could say it this way to the way that the Jews were blinded to who the Messiah was every scripture pertaining to the Lord Jesus was being fulfilled right before their eyes and he even challenged him he said search the scriptures go search the scriptures because in them you think you have eternal life but they are which that testify of me so he's actually tell him here I am in the scriptures and you can't even see it look that wasn't because God disliked them I could say in any way but really he blinded his eyes for you he didn't lose a one can ended up giving him robes white robes that he'll call the remainder of his elected from those people and he made a way for you so everything is contained within the Bible the message that is brought to us in this day is not unscriptural it's it's scripture upon scripture but it's knitted together if I could say that fitted and joined together by the Holy Spirit so that we could get the true picture of God's plan it never was God's plan to have 500 different denominations to have the people ruled over by the ministry for them to be taught one certain line of thought and to put their trust in a group of people that they're a member with all the the prophet brought back to us is he brought back the same Jesus he brought back Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he wanted every believer to know that if you have a personal relationship with him that his Spirit In You is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what it means to be borned again to be born again is to know Jesus Christ personally and what that changes of a birth is your birth from one nature to another nature your nature changes your heart's desires change there's a change in you that change can happen without sensation but it's still a change your affections change and you you have a new uh leader the leadership changes in your life it's not by affections it's not by emotions it's not by by uh any other thing but what leads you and moves you is his Spirit you're led by the spirit that you meant and you know whom it is that's leading you the holy spirit is not a third person it's not a spirit separate than God it's not the spirit separate from Jesus it's the spirit that was in Jesus Christ the nature and the spirit that was on him coming into you that that same Spirit would Quicken your mortal body and raise you if the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body and I know that some people try to draw a picture sometimes that meet that I personally don't believe in shouting or praising or dancing well you know all I I love it okay I just don't like it when it's motivated by music you know what I mean worship is the recognition of what God has done for you and praising them for it you know you know what I mean and I've been healed a time or two and shouted because of it I've seen my life like just God actually deliver me out of circumstances that were absolutely there was no way at all except for it to be the miraculous hand of God I told you the time that Leslie and I were driving in the Volkswagen bus in Montana and we came up and we hit an ice patch and we started this slide and you know what a Volkswagen buses are remember the old Veep man it was got some hippies in here and the bus went straight down on the front and you sat right there and uh I think the engine was right in the middle there and you sat right on the front of the in fact this is where the steering wheel and this was the front of the car and we act the guard rail disappeared and alls we could see was the the river below us Leslie went to the floor of the car she just fell down on the floorboard I I couldn't do that I was driving I threw my hands up and said Jesus help me Jesus helped me we came to I would say it that way around the corner on the side of the road and at least none other Eric and I I I just remember just shouting and thanking the lord now forgive me I I wasn't a Christian very long and all I did is turn to Leslie and said that was neat uh but it was him I'm telling you you know it was him in my life doing something for me and I had something to praise him about it was it was marvelous and and uh uh I I remember we were uh brother Ron Peterson and I uh were long friends we listened to choosing of the Bride together as you know brother Ron was in at the church we were going to uh back in the hippie movement there I guess they made a movie about the Jesus people movement but forget what that thing is that really wasn't the way it was I ain't seen it but I knew all those people in those days but so we kind of come in the message together and we were back out in Flagstaff Arizona and we are driving them a little I think some little pickup truck or a Volkswagen bug or whatever it was and we got to thinking about predestination and Malachi 4 5 and how we're predestinated and I'm telling you we got so excited that I remember pulling the car on the side of the road and jumping out and starting to run around the car Ron got its height he jumped out started to run around the car and people thought that he's chasing me and I was running around the car while then pretty soon it looked like I was chasing him and and around and around that car we went just a shouting and and having a jubilee but we had something to shout about in on the prophet of God says he says that you know he doesn't want praise to stop when the Music Stops you know what I mean and and shouting and jumping and praising that's all fine but you know it's it's not only for young people you know what I mean it's for people that have something that he did for him and it's such a marvelous thing that he's done Brother Paul's wife when God delivered her of that cancer in her jaw and everything if she got up here and started shouting and dancing I know why she was shouting and dancing it wasn't a song that brought it on it was a it wasn't a music it wasn't an atmosphere it wasn't the next thing that's to be anticipated you know read Corinthians 12. you know even tongues Paul said if you're going to speak in tongues let one or two speak in tongues not more than three it's what he said I didn't make this up you understand but it has a lot to do with leadership but anyway so uh he uh he laid that out there and then he said if in it but I would rather you prophesy and we know what that means that means because the prophet is a new testament preacher he said I'd rather that you tell of the scriptures and tell what what's edifying to the body that that they might grow in Christ in other words prophesying has to be the word of the Lord do you understand that it's what the Lord said and he said he said but if any man think himself to be a prophet let him acknowledge that the things that I speak unto you are of the Lord so you can't break somebody just preached about that you can't break God's pattern he's got a a great pattern and you stay with it and and you know brother Matthew shared a wonderful story with men and I and it really moved my heart but he said that the prophet of God had a prayer line and I believe in the prayer line as you know they would I think they would come from the right this way to him and he said the lady came up and he said she just would keep dancing and and praising God hallelujah and she was felt the spirit of the Lord and he said he said sister would you be still that I can talk to you and she said she just couldn't be still because she wasn't taught right Matthew what tapes that him do you remember I'll give you the tapes just read it to us would you okay so go ahead and go ahead stand up and read that portion to it yeah you can go give him a mic he don't need one but I'm sorry Matthew that sounded wrong I'll use that okay lo and behold here I am I was going to read this at the end of my sermon on Wednesday so I'll just read it and that's all I will do this is where I think Pentecost failed he says I believe it with all my heart and I think that's where the church has failed I think we've failed to bring love Among Us and to bring Fellowship among the groups and things like that and we've tried to push ourselves into something that God has not ordained and I believe that if we would just walk back down the line to God and say God here I stand nothing at all I have to offer you but my life but God I pray that you'll let me live that that I'll find Grace in your sight now you're coming along getting pretty close to the kingdom that's right then you'll see a real healing meeting when you come up to the altar don't come glory to God I receive the Holy Ghost 40 years ago praise God hallelujah that don't do no good Satan don't care how much you say that the thing of it is walk up with a true Assurance in your heart that you know where you're standing I was amazed here not long ago at a little woman come down to the platform there was two of them together and one of them come through and I said how do you do sister now remember I believe in all spiritual demonstrations yes sir I have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I know what I speak of and they come down the line the little lady come up to the prayer line and she started dancing around real fast and I said would you stand still just a minute so I could speak to you she couldn't do it and she just kept dancing around well I thought I'll just try the next one and I got the next one to come down I tried to take a hold of her hand and I said I'd like to talk to you just a little bit sister and then she started dancing around I said oh I love that it's beautiful and I know Miriam danced in the spirit I believe in it yes sir but there's times for all things you see and when you're coming up here comes soberly in the presence of God come with a perfect assured heart that God's going to keep his word and melt yourself down by the Holy Spirit and the little lady I didn't know what happened and and one of them I'm sure had cancer and she's probably dead tonight but she just wouldn't stand still you couldn't get nowhere see because the woman had been taught wrong a wonderful person no doubt and there stood a little woman now that was a Pentecostal woman and here stood a little woman a a formal denomination standing back there with a little girl and she wasn't making a move at all and she had her prayer card and she was just standing there waiting after a while they give time for her to come the little lady walked up and a little girl walked up there and took a hold of my hand she said looky here mother began to raise her leg and her mother began to cry wilted down she said brother Branham I knew it would happen I just knew it would happen she said I believed with all of my heart I said what was wrong with the child she said she was paralyzed in both legs see there it was there you are see she come the appropriate way she come God fearing God believing walking up there reverent before God believe in his promise where a real saintly woman just mistalk come across the platform I couldn't even pray for her and the woman thought she was in the spirit she was in the flesh but of course she was there she she showed what was in the spirit the fruits what proved it when you come to God you must come soberly sanely believing asking then if God heals you then raise your hands and give them praise that's right that little woman walked down there and hugged that girl the father come running out of the audience and said brother Branham I've been a sinner for years and my wife's a Christian can I find Jesus right now I said yes my brother just kneel right here that's right see that's the way we want the meeting isn't that right something that same solid and his sound that's the kind of church we want [Applause] that's the way I believe it that's what I've been trying to teach there's a way to approach you understand I'm not critical but it's because they're not taught right you don't fall out it don't do nothing for you but you come knowing if you go through a prayer line and you want to be healed you walk up there knowing you're going to be healed and when God heals you you raise your hands and you praise them if you want to be delivered and you come and you receive but you walk up soberly sanely and you give God the glory and don't take a film of yourself right and send it out on the internet for everybody to see that you have an experience that's Tick-Tock Christianity and if it's banned in the United States it ought to be banned in the Church of the Living God anyway I hope I don't sound mean but let's take our Bibles this morning and let's begin a little lesson this morning out of the book oh all right we're going to stand all right so that's good we'll read the first verse of the book of Ezra and then you can be seated book of Ezra I thought you said brother McGarry I thought you said Nehemiah yes but uh I don't want you to stand for that so let's just sit here and say in the first verse of the book of Ezra now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King of Persia and made him to Proclaim throughout all of his kingdom and put it also in writing saying God bless you may be seated today we're going to have a little Biblical history Lesson by a person that loves history but is a terrible history teacher and so what I would like to start with this morning if the brothers could put up on the board I hope it comes out pretty good at uh I I have it on mine let me see if we can get it up there for you amen so this is uh it oh this is the Assyrian Kingdom it that's not the one that I have here but uh but I'll go ahead and use this one uh the one I have is just a little different but it shows the reason I have this one but I want to point you out if you can hear me this is the land this is the city that jarrah that Nehemiah was in at the time of his writing I wanted to get the other map up but right here on this bottom place is the city of UR right here okay so how many know what What er is okay ER is not Babylon ER is where Abraham was okay when God told him to get out of uh okay there's a map of it right here very good thank you this is Elam this is the place where Abraham was and this was ER right here the city of UR and you see Babylon up there a little farther now we know that Abraham you can go back to the original map that was good so we know that Abraham traveled from ER over into what today is known as Jerusalem so we're go we're going to understand the Jewish history in all this so Abraham went over to Jerusalem and there in Jerusalem he offered up Isaac how many remember that story correct and that spot where he after offered up Isaac was Mount Mira which today is known as the Temple mount that's where they built the temple is in that spot where he offered today that spot is uh the president of a Mohamed and mosque and uh that's part of our history so we're not going to talk about the Jews so much today because what happened to the Jews during this time is that they went over into uh I'm being lost here um well anyway um just the very first one you had it's the one I can yeah that's that one this one here okay all right that's great so we know that they went over right to Israel and you you can look at this map and you can see where uh you can see where Jerusalem is and you can see it on the map on that side or this side you see Jerusalem Samaria Tyra at and uh and then down off of Jerusalem over here is if you went down to I guess here it's called Ash kalon right in there well that's where about Tel Aviv is today and so we know that the Jews went there a Great Famine came on the land and the Jews all ended up in Egypt we understand that story right so they're all in Egypt and so they're there for 400 years but what's happening to the rest of the world is that the rest of the world the Assyrians are now taking over the world and forming an Assyrian Empire now remember when you talk about Old Testament Old Testament dates work backwards New Testament dates work upward so if from if you went from a thousand BC and you win a hundred years the next year wouldn't be a thousand one hundred it would be yeah you know 900 and so everything is is going so the Assyrian Empire had ruled and you so you see the area of the Assyrian Empire and so that was the area that the Assyrians Empire was the Assyrians were a group of people and the Babylonians were a group of people one was given more to fighting the Babylonians were given more to intellect and and culture and things like that so really what happened there was an internal uh Civil War you might say and the Babylonian Kingdom came into existence and Nebuchadnezzar took over it so the Babel the Syrian Empire almost the same exact footprint became the Babylonian Empire and we know what happened the Jews returned back Israel to Palestine they began to build their City when Nebuchadnezzar took over the Assyrian Empire he went over and sacked you know what Sac means right he he bagged up everything like a grocery sack he'll he went over there and took all the riches and all the temple Goods all the things and he brought him over to to his country at which now it changed from Assyria to the Babylonian Empire basically the same land mass so you got the picture right so the Assyrian Empire became the Babylonian Empire Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon he went over to Israel and he sacked Israel he took all the children he brought the Jews into captivity he brought all the goods he took the young men as you know Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Daniel and so he basically took Jerusalem and the inhabitants of Israel the descendants of Abraham and destroyed that land took it under his control and brought the all the children of Israel that were of any value to his kingdom he brought him back to Babylon so you had the Babylonian Kingdom now instead of the Assyrian Kingdom so it was the same Kingdom so what we're what we're speaking on this morning if we could say it in that way is we're talking about the path to Restoration now we want you to take this history and apply it to yourself the path to Restoration the building of your walls and Gates and so we want to get put the setting there so the setting is now if you go to what we have on on map two I think you guys found that one is that the same one I have uh no I guess they weren't able to find the same one I had um it's the one if you're looking on it's the one that shows uh uh the conquest of the Persian Kingdom um okay on the image I just got my pictures off the internet but I'll use whatever map they put up there the best way I can okay so in what was in the beginning uh and I I don't know if you can I don't know if you could see this or not but uh uh so you see down here uh you see this this is the where Nehemiah is at the time of his book right here's the Persian Gulf right over here is a little area that's called that's called Persia it could and that's 50 55 9 BC the country of Persia begins to start its Conquest and that King is the king of Syria and his name Cyrus the King of Persia so Cyrus conquers all of the land surrounding Babylonian Kingdom that that's all of the land that you see there going up and I don't know if you notice at the top you see what city that is up at top can anybody read that Nineveh how many knows where Nineveh comes in in the Bible that's the city that Jonah went to speak against the city of Nineveh so if you go back to our map to the full map there you see how he came back all the way down from Nineveh where he he talked about judgment and he came all the way down way over here to the Mediterranean Sea just way down here to the bottom is where he fled to get on a boat right where it says Judea so you don't think he was running from the presence of the Lord and so we know that we know the story how that key uh that he got taken by the great fish and specially prepared fish came up on the ground and eventually Nineveh repented so if we go there then we see that then uh in in in 59 in 539 uh uh Cyrus conquered Babylon and so now he had conquered Babylon so he conquered all of all of the land around Babylon and then he conquered Babylon and then and he conquered by 1547 he had went all the way up and conquered Lydia which we would know today as turkey all right so then later on his son conquered Egypt and and that whole land all about there was now known as the Persian Empire and our setting is in the Persian Empire and I I hope we have this one uh um and I guess I could put these someplace else and then if we would go to map three it's an overlay of the today's Persian Empire did we foreign okay that's the one I wanted to show you first so let's go back no I just want you to understand this because there's a reason I want to you understand that is because all this is going on and God's still moving he's still got a plan he still plays plan is still coming to pass okay with all this the Jews there there where they're at they've been away in captivity but all this Empire and thing is going on this is all going on with the sons of Ishmael so this this was see Persia here that's that's where uh Cyrus was King of Persia then he came up here and he conquered all media and and conquered by by 55 BC then he went over and conquered Babylon which is all that area there he went up and conquered Lydia up there which is part of turkey and his son came down here and conquered Egypt so that was the kingdom of Persia at that time it's the kingdom of Persia that uh that Nehemiah was in when the Story begins and so we want to do one more map if they could uh find that one and it was would be map three of the ones that we had at and that is the present day area this is the present day map and is this the overlay of the Persian Empire it would be the area of the Persian Empire it looks like this the Persian Empire okay so you can uh well but I guess I just can tell you you see where Iraq is okay Iraq right there to Syria Lebanon Israel Jordan Turkey Tyran all of this area Afghanistan uh how I know how you say that okay that was all the Persian Empire okay that was all the Persian Empire in normal day setting so Babylon is now present-day Iraq do you get you know yeah I just want you to understand what you're looking at so Iraq and Iran were all part of it right down at the end of the Persian Gulf right kind of where it says Kuwait right above that is where ER was where the city that Nehemiah was in so that's the present day Kingdom of Persia Iran wasn't called Persia until 19 Iran tell uh early 1900s it was known as Persia and then it became Iraq Syria and that Kingdom eventually broke up that's the physical area that this story is transpiring in so if you want to know the history what happened to the Persian Empire a fellow raised up in Turkey by the name of Alexander and Alexander went and defeated the Persian Empire Alexander the Great and when Alexander the Great passed away his sons and different people got in battles and it broke up into four different kingdoms and then or Empires and then history started coming down so all these events from the capture of the children of Israel till the time that Cyrus takes over so this is where our story picks up is the children of Israel have left following God the Lord promised them if they would keep his Commandments he would take care of them but if they refused to keep his Commandments he would scatter him throughout the Earth so that's the promise so let's go back and start just for a few moments this morning if the book of Ezra so if you have in your mind because the picture Abraham came out of to Abraham came out of I I or Iraq to go to Israel and and Iran and all that's the present-day company so we'll just read a little bit of Ezra so you can understand the story this is 16 years before Nehemiah okay the king Cyrus now has conquered his kingdom he's taken the throne he is an offspring of Ishmael all right which we would refer to as an Arab Nation Arabic people he's The Offspring of Ishmael he believes in God okay so he's he's not a pagan I I I don't want to shock any of you but there's a lot of people that don't believe the message believe in God they love the Lord they serve them with all their heart and they will be there okay that is not your election it's not our job to change the world our duty is to profess what God has revealed to us that it might be a blessing to who's ever willing to receive it so we're not the judge you understand if someone accepts the message we trust that they'll accept the benefits of the message which is to have faith that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that the love of God is shed abroad in their heart by the Holy Spirit and I can have a fellowship with anybody that confesses the Lord Jesus Christ if they don't see it eye to eye that's fine I'm not going to condemn them for something that I receive freely from the Lord you know and if if they can't understand my Revelation what am I going to do boast that I understood it on my own that is something that I achieved and that everybody can achieve not everybody can come to this message there's an elected group of ladies you understand and each of us has a bride and as the bride that we chose there's a lot of good women but that's not the one that God placed you with so remember you you are not Christianity you are an elected lady out of Christianity for the purpose of reflect that he can reflect his person in you in the last day that you can be the last voice to a dying generation and they can see Jesus Christ Living in human flesh and not in organizations religions and systems exactly so here the word made Flash you understand we're not theologians trying to go out and straighten up the world you know if they love the Lord that's great I love how Paul approached him have you guys received the Holy Ghost since you believe he didn't say oh you bunch of unbelievers you don't got the Holy Ghost I'm so holy no he said did you know that God's Got Something greater for you we didn't even know a such thing he said well how are you baptized he says we are baptized by John unto repins he said well the Lord has a baptism of the spirit now I'm going to follow the formula if you'll repent of your sins except Jesus Christ as your savior in your heart but be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the promise they were already believers they just weren't baptized with the baptism that the Lord Jesus and they accepted it gladly and the spirit of the Lord came in their lives and in their heart and they realized now there was a presence of the Lord was leading them it switched from intellectual to spiritual leadership I would rather serve God intellectually than not serve him at all and if they're not against you they're for you and attitude means everything to the Church of the Living God going forward you can hold this message in a bad attitude and it doesn't do you any good it doesn't do anybody else any good the scripture describes it this way holding the truth of God in unrighteousness right we don't want to do that the same love that he loved you with you love everybody with amen you just love them and what what's your hope your hope is what he did for you he can do for them and that's all you what you're trying to and if they reject it they're not rejecting you they'll rejecting him and a lot of times it's just because they've been taught wrong so we began to we begin to see our story now here comes Cyrus in he's a son of Ishmael he's an Arab can you you know what I mean that's his that's his background we're not talking about Muhammad we're just talking about that he believed in the same God the god of Abraham he believed Abraham his was his father he comes over and he becomes the king the first year and God moves on his heart you know God's moving on a lot of people's hearts out there to do things when when he can't move on the hearts of people within the framework of what we follow because we're not open to nothing we kind of believe what we believe is going to get us there but my point this morning to the path of restoration to be restored is to understand that when it's Paul speaking of in Ephesians I think it's one in five that we are for ordained unto good works that we should walk in them our Pursuit here this morning is to find the good works that God has foreordained for us to do and to walk in them it's not belonging it's not joining it's not getting the right doctor it's personally young ladies young men older ladies older men uh Supreme Elders uh you it doesn't matter where that you are God had a purpose for calling you and and and and to bring us to the work that he had foreordained for us to do that we should walk in that work we're walking a lot of times in belief but we're not walking in the work that's foreign for us to do okay I I hope I'm not causing any confusion but Paul even said show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith because I'm walking in the calling wherein I was called and I hope it sets in your heart this morning that you've got to call not just a call to serve him Paul made that so simple he says that's your reasonable service that's the least that's required of you but I've got something for you to do no man lighteth a candle and put it under a bushel basket but he lets it Shine that the world might see that his good works might glorify his father in Heaven damn and we can't write that off because this is the age of what restoration this is the restoration of the Bride tree this is the restoration of the Bride back to what she was called out to do with the same power the same works that he did this is the restoration of the bride and there's a path to that restoration so we understand that this King it says in in Ezra the second verse he says and the Cyrus King of Persia the Lord of Heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the Earth and hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judea we know the story of Ezra right so what took place is that Cyrus found the men they went there the priest gathered together they came into that land and they built the temple and the temple was restored and then we can now turn to Nehemiah the first chapter and where we pick up our story Nehemiah is in that first city we showed you on the map the city of I I don't know how to pronounce it I'm sorry for my lack of ability to pronounce but he he was at a Santa which is also known as s-u-s-a I believe that's that first little town that was the winner Palace of the Persian king now who's ruling the Persian Empire is the grandson of Cyrus he says and the words of Nehemiah the son of hatch uh leha and it came to pass in the month of uh chisholu now that according to all history is our December so there was in December so the king uh uh uh exerts yes or however you said his name uh he is now at his winter dwelling and it came to pass in the month of uh Joseph in the 20th year as I was in uh the palace that hananiah one of my brethren so we know that hananiah is the brother of Nehemiah actually flesh brother came and he and certain men of Judea and they asked them concerning the Jews and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped and what were left in the Captivity and concerning Jerusalem so he was worried about his brethren he was wondering what's going on in my home even though he was in captivity he still had a land that he was longing for amen he got a land that he's longing for he knows where his root is he knows where he's from he hasn't forgot his people he just like Shadrach machine Abednego before him he hasn't let the world dilute him from being and standing to what he believes right so he kept his integrity it isn't that what we heard this morning Lord I've kept my Integrity I've kept true to my principles I kept true to what I believe in let me tell you a path to Restoration takes Integrity it takes you having principles and lines you don't cross regardless of the situation or circumstance you say well if I don't do this job or take this job this job wants me to work and I can't be in church he says but if I don't take this job I won't eat your integrity has changed you besides what you can do and what God will do for you when you stand true to your values and your integrity he'll move mountains he'll do extremely above what you can even ask or think that's the god that's got to be restored we're on the path to Restoration where God is the rules and he's the head of Our Lives the head of our heart we don't we don't we just don't compromise and the whole world is designed to make this last day lady compromise to reason because he makes it unreasonable to serve God this whole story of Nehemiah and Ezra is totally unreasonable in the historical setting that we're in so he goes he says and they said unto me The Remnant that are left of the Captivity so what was the Captivity the Babylonian captivity there were Jews that were left there now Cyrus sent to rebuild the Temple okay God moved on him he said go build the temple he sent Ezra in Jerusalem and them and they rebuilt the temple now they're coming and say what happened to those Jews how are they doing the ones that went to build the temple the ones that that were left us and are are there living in in the land of Our Father Abraham how are they doing and and he said and this is how they answered and they said to me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the walls of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gate thereof are burnt with fire their walls have become broken down what are the walls to a Christian they're the things that keep the enemy out they're Gates were burnt there was no possession of the gates of the enemy The Fortress was gone it was all broke down in fact the people were living in the ruins they had they were there because the temple was there but their lives were in what ruined what it also did Cyrus do if you go back and read the book of Ezra he went to the treasure he took all the temple jewelry all the temple artifacts all the temple things of sacrifice and he sent them all back to the temple so now the Temple's there they got all their worship going they're burning daily sacrifices they're doing all the religious things but the people's lives are in ruined an amazing type is an amazing circumstance because they have a place of worship but the people have no fortification they have no gate and they're despised in other words what that means is the people are mocking them oh you children of God you weak powerless people because history always show with the Jews that when when they were right God blessed them spiritually and physically he protected him because they were in that period of the first Exodus we're not looking for those kinds of blessing we're looking for a blessing that transforms us Plum out of here and so we find out that this is where they are so the the there that it's a reproach the walls of Jerusalem are broken down is broken down in the gates they are also burned with fire he says and it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept one of the curses of this generation is a Hardness of Heart it is we hear so much garbage so much crime so much going on in the world that that we just want to shut it out and because of iniquity man's heart were hardened come here the path of restoration is the loosening up of a hard heart the Turning of a Heart of Stone to a heart that feels you can never be restored if until you can feel what your brother's feeling how many knows what virtue that is in the Statue of a perfect man what's it called it's called brotherly kindness it's the virtue that defeats the spirit of ladyocia look when your heart's no longer Harden you care and are concerned for the needs of your fellow man you're not hardened up Believe It or Not Republicans get get saved maybe few everybody thinks Republicans is the big standard for Christianity I don't know it's just pick your devil Or democrats or all that that's all garbage we don't follow that stuff we don't get into that stuff he said follow thou me look at that so Nehemiah he he he sits down and and he Weeps and he Mourns certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven you know our messenger was given to fasting and praying we don't believe in a group fast we don't call a group fast and say everybody lets all of us fast but let me tell you fasting and praying is a wonderful way to get to the Lord it cleanses your mind it focuses your spirit this burden that struck Nehemiah when he heard about it it actually touched them so deep that he wept about it so that his fellow Believers were going through such misery and torment why could you imagine if we had that same feeling to the children of our members and to our relatives and our Outlaws that it would actually drive us to fasting and praying not a glass of milk and a bunch of Oreo cookies we say you know I'm not going to eat lunch today on behalf of brother such and such her sister such and such or I'm I'm going to take a couple days and I'm going to pray and I'm gonna fast I want the Lord to know I'm serious I want him to know that I'm I'm putting myself on the line because I'm making petition to him it's man's nature that he thinks that he's going to get something poured on him in the form of anointing without ever having any sacrifice without ever bringing the flesh under subjection without ever setting apart and setting aside at the the the things that so easily beset us the sin and the unbelief that so easily besets us the the sacrifice that it takes to shut out the world now we're talking about making a rapture we're talking about the hours closing in we have to sit in trustee meetings and actually consider what Pathways do we have if the government decides to tax us you know our trust is in the Lord but sometimes people don't have burden for nothing like I I tried to speak to you last time I think if we would go through our average offering it's like a couple dollars per person we take up space we don't have a burden for it people are sitting in the Overflow we don't have a burden for them we don't care we're just here taking care of Sunday morning obligation we don't care about what's going on in our brothers and sisters lives we're not praying for everybody we don't look for anybody I had a lady call us and tell us she said well my son's going through a real hard time so I asked the pastor to come pray for him m M he didn't want the pastor to pray for him I can understand that how to accept that he said I want Billy to pray I'm with me I I I'm not after any praise Or Glory I Billy yes preach God go pray they want Billy to pray for him either they picked another church to go to because he can pack that spirit in that church and feel no condemnation and feel no conviction you know I thought okay I don't care I'm glad you're in church I'm just glad he didn't choose a Catholic Church I mean it's it's more serious than I can make to you so Nehemiah is broken because of the condition of his brethren and he's the natural because that was he was in the natural Exodus we are now in the spiritual Exodus facing a new Exodus there is going to be another leaving can we want to get as many in as we can we want to be burdened the prophet God said the evidence of a Christian Life is people that live for other people if you're convinced your concern if you understand that there's another Exodus there's another leaving and as we've said many times the the Rapture is not a date it's a condition you're in rapturing conditions can people have shared with us the rapture's on now yes the Rapture is on now the last voice has come the preparation of the Bride the incoming Spirit to Quicken you into wrappering condition is trying to take hold in the lives of Christians in other words ladyocia is Jesus Christ standing at the door knocking to get into your heart personally where the love of God is shed abroad in Your Heart by his nature which is the Holy Spirit you become Christians Roman Empire's gonna come up it's going to take it all they're going to be put into the place they're going to put a tax because Jews are going to return to Bethlehem and the whole story of God is unfolding despite all the political turmoil and history change that's going on that's what we want to be a part of we want to be a part of God we want to be a part of his mind we want to be a part of his movement we want to be the people that is molding and making and putting the burden and putting his love in and putting his heart in that work that we're representing and standing there for what our kingdom is and we ought to be heartbroken that the kingdom of God and of this message is in such disarray they're men of trying to elevate themselves and they're trying to look at their works and and we're all broken down and we're getting away from the voice of the messenger of the hour I don't think he would be pleased what are you going to do about it David I'm going to do my part I'm going to try to have the right Spirit I'm gonna try my love my brother I'm going to try to beat the bigger Circle I'm going to watch my own personal Integrity I'm not going to let people take me down I want to be lifted up how are you going to do that well a little prayer would help a little fasting would help a little good works would help what do they call Insanity when you continually do the same thing over and over again thinking you're going to get a different result something's got to change there had to come a change in Nehemiah do you understand that there had to be something restored in Nehemiah now Nehemiah is just like you he wasn't anything special he was a cup Bearer what kind of credentials do you think Mr Kitt you would have to have to hold a cup I think you could do that couldn't you if I gave you a glass and said bring me a glass of water you could do that what happens if I told you to build a city couldn't do that without God could you but if God was with you you could build the city he was nothing not of great reputation not a great Fame maybe not even well educated but you know one thing he did have he had a right spirit he had a right spirit and when he heard the news it tore his heart up but what was taking place the hand of God was trying to restore Nehemiah out of his lukewarm position and the comfort that he was in and try to stir him up because God wanted something to be done right God wanted the walls to be built back again and the gates to be back again and God wants you to build your wall back again around your life and build your Gates because the promise is I will restore saith the Lord and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it I'll build a wall around you his word but I think our walls have gotten torn down and We Know Better We Know Better I can hear the prophet I never understood it like I did this morning him sitting back and saying the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in we let down the what the bars the wall we let the wall now all of you got a wall that you've got to maintain all of you got a gate Prophet said so he's got a Punch coming in all of us a spot that we're weak I've I know what it's like to be punched down I know how hard it is to get up but I thank God there's something in me that says where else can I go where else can I go you alone have the words to eternal life restore Me Lord the path to Restoration here's a nobody but God has positioned him and prepared him and placed him here is a god doing great things unexpected things in unexpected ways using unexpected people don't let Satan use your personality against you you remind them wait a minute I've been borned again see this personality you're picking on I'm at war with him the flesh Warth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to another but I have an author and a finisher of my faith and I'm going to lock you up and bring you under subjection I'm going to build a wall around you and I'm going to close your gate so here's Nehemiah he is God's put this whole thing in beautiful perspective he has the king I guess it's I think who that King is I might pronounce his name wrong and nehemiah's cup bear and nehemiah's continents his atmosphere and his attitude was very pleasing to the king another is the king like to be have him around it made him feel good how many knows prophet of God talks about that he says there's some people that sweet you just like to be around and there's other people you just don't want to be around at all they've always got something negative to say they'll always criticizing you know okay you know I live here in Dallas Fort Worth God put me here people always tell I wouldn't live here for nothing this is just an old dump and and all this stuff you know something go back to where you're happy I don't want to hear it I live here take your negative thing about life I can live anywhere in Christ Jesus when I picked here probably not of but God put me here I've seen Souls one here I've seen people delivered I've seen people healed I'm sorry for sister pinel's loss but I remember that they had a daughter I remember the doctor going to brother Daniel and telling him who do you want to live your wife or your daughter how'd you like that choice which one of your kids would you want to give up I think you'd give your life for all of them wouldn't you I remember him coming he said Brother David they they want me to make a choice I said you don't have to make that choice if that choice has to be made let him make it don't let them put that on you let him make it and I said the joy of the Lord is our promise of peace that surpassed understanding brother Daniel took that word he went down to that hospital and he sat down in that Chapel you think he got serious you think he said a Hail Mary a Glory Be uh he had to find the Hem of His Garment he couldn't just grab anything he had to stay there till he found the Hem of His Garment he opened up the scripture in desperation he read a scripture about the joy of the Lord was his portion and he looked to Heaven he said father if I have to make this choice I will be sad the rest of my life and that's contrary to his word he walked down that Hall and he told that doctor bring her in there delivered the baby they'll live and I I don't remember which of his children it was but I think it was Symphony I don't even know if she's here this morning the family may be grieving are you here anywhere I guess not she just lost her brother that's getting serious with God so so many things brother Almighty people say well where's God in your midst I'll tell you where he's admit I don't come to you with enticing words but I come to you with power and demonstration in the spirit you would have never believed him he walked down to the aisle like this are you here brother are you here anywhere where you at stand up I can't see you way back get them out well you're not going to have an overflow pretty quick come here brother I want you to walk down the aisle he couldn't even walk down the aisle this is the hand of God this is the real hand of God this is the real miracle of God a real genuine miracle because he he had a God-fearing wife then the wife told him it told her said get ready he's not going to live she said I don't I don't accept that you're not going to live he looked back at her and he said I didn't like that doctor anyway but they got serious it's wrong I fell apart I'm back I'm still falling apart but that's okay he was serious he got serious you think that was the last attack no he got a she had a little son I called him baby John I still call him baby Johnny probably like to strangle me for it but they told me he'd be he'd be that he'd never now he's some smart guy real high in his class because we got a God that lives we got a job God that's proved himself to us now he is asking us to come to service for him that he can bring his light to a lost and dying generation and introduce Jesus Christ of our day in word form to who will ever receive it so God had prepared Nehemiah you believe that he positioned them seemingly a nobody just a cup Bearer but he kept a good attitude he kept a good atmosphere he did a really really good job with the assignment he was given if God put him to be a cup Bearer he was the best cup Bearer there was so much was he a cup Bearer The King didn't want anybody else bearing this cup but him you know you find that characteristic in the children of Israel that serve God kept God's Commandments and loved God they found favor with everybody around them a real Christian finds favor within and without if you think the whole world's mad at you and nobody likes you it just might be you except for my case no it just might be us might be our atmosphere might be our attitude might be the way we're approaching things Prophet God said it takes the right atmosphere for something to hatch the king had placed him prepared them he allowed a burden to come on his house now let's watch this is called the path to Restoration we've seen what God did God moved on the king of Syria to build the temple and what happened all the people that built the temple they just got cold and informal they went back and fell into religion they quit pursuing they lost their vision but God raises up Nehemiah he places them as the king's servant he's sitting there serving wine and then we pick up the next few verses and so this is Nehemiah now preparing himself the path to Restoration is God gives the burden the call in your life to apply the token to clean up to prepare for the rapture and then Nehemiah prepares himself and I said I beseech the O Lord God Of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth Covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments number one rule to the path of restoration is go back and obey the Commandments keep the rules I'm not going to go over all the rules I think the rules should be written on your heart on the tablets of your heart by the Holy Spirit when the spirit of God convicts you of something he's convicting you because you're crossing the line and I said I beseech thee O Lord God Of Heaven the great and terrible God that keepeth covenants and mercy for them that love him and observe his Commandments let thine ear now be at Kenneth and thine eyes opened that doubt may US hear the prayer of thy servant basically saying Our Father which out in heaven Hallowed be thy name which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel thy servants what do you notice something there day and night when you get a burden if it's a real burden you don't lay it down you don't pass it off it becomes a desire of your heart Lord I long to see my son restored day and night you pray day and night what's God's showing us all if he could take a cup pair and catch the heart of the king what will he do for you you know Satan trembles when a Christian hits his knees that God can do for you exceedingly and abundantly what you ask this burden has now came unto Nehemiah now em Nehemiah is taking his request to the throne he's making his request known he's out there calling in the presence of the Lord he's approaching God and the first thing he does is he acknowledges the greatness of God he gives him honor he gives them praise he lets him know he's the god that can do all things he's not popping in there and say hey Daddy I got a little something for you to do he's got fear he's got reverence he knows that the god that he's approaching can do what he's asking and it's not a hope so it's a firm burden that he's consumed with that he can't go any farther in his life until he gets some sort of resolution I think a lot of people give up way too early they're not sober they're not reverent and they're not resolved they just want to get the same experience that everybody else had oh such and such dance I wanted that substance that fell out I want to fellow good get the same experience that caused them to do that then it's yours it's not copycat it's genuine it's real you know what you're talking about do You Hear the prophet of God said I alive I believe in all the manifestation I got the Holy Spirit I know what it is I know what I'm talking about he said this poor lady was in the flesh she had cancer and she's probably dead tonight because of what wrong teaching so now Nehemiah is beseeching the Lord he said I pray day and night for the children of Israel thy servants and confess the sins of thy children of Israel which have sinned against thee both I and my father's house have sinned what is sin it's unbelief God's going to hold us responsible for unexercise faith if you haven't believed for anything you haven't been a have a burden you're not trying to call the spiritual ladder you don't need God to do something Supernatural in your life and you're just on some motorboat Cruise it's not pleasing to the father he's told you hope all things believe all things all things are possible he's he'll do exceedingly and abundantly for you above of what you can ask or think we don't want to let our faith lay dormant what is this age it's the restoration of the Faith of Our Fathers we want to get on the path of restoration not to not to some carnal thing but the real spiritual faith that believes that God's word will not fail and we can have what we ask for but look what it takes a burden not a demonstration I learned that the hard way but if it's a it's a burden I want to see a miracle because there's a miracle needed I don't want to see a miracle because I want to see a miracle I don't want to see a miracle so I can show people that there's miracles foreign it's not done in public we the world had a public show I'm trying to interpret Visions but he said I'll meet you in there it's you and him you laying your burdens you praying you exalting him you confessing your sins you admitting who he is and you're admitting Who You Are and what's standing between the sinner you can the great God is our great professionary the Lord Jesus Christ the word of God and I'll try to close we're moving now okay said now he's confessing now he's preparing himself he's on the path to Restoration he's finally received a burden in his heart he's got the spirit of intercession he's got the spirit of Burden he's Desiring the best for his brethren the family it's Christ showing himself forth in his servant Nehemiah We have dealt very corruptly against thee we have not kept thy Commandments nor the statues of the judgments which thou commandeth thy servant Moses remember I beseech thee the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying hallelujah oh now he's in the greatest hour and what is he approach him with he approaches them with the words spoken by the prophets Lord remember your promise remember your word why because we're partakers of divine nature through these great and exceedingly promises when it all comes down to earth it's not about him it's about him and what he said just like Abraham he said there where's the sacrifice he says our God will provide a sacrifice God still had to provide that sector of Faith didn't he is on his way of positioning the world so that promise sacrifice could come to pass remember he will position the world so are your heart's desire will come to pass can you got a spirit that bothers you get on the path of restoration get on the path talk it over with them admit who you are admit who he is admit you can't do it finally come to the place God your word said because where's Faith final resting place Nehemiah who's on the path of restoration is now going to find a place that he can anchor because once he hits that unmovable spot and now he's got the motivation and the word of the Lord to go forward are you with us the political worlds in a turmoil they're really all living in captivity under the great Persian Empire just totally destroyed Israel but God raises up a king and told that King to rebuild the Temple now here's the relatives of that King here's a cup baroness thing who's got the right Spirit the right attitude and everything he's broken-hearted and now he's praying to the Lord he's preparing himself for the work that's on his heart you believe we're foreordained unto good works do you believe that's personal don't count yourself out of the picture he never counted you out but can take prepare yourself so I love this part remember I beseech the the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying if ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations now he sees that doesn't he that's visible he sees the condition he recognizes the day in his message but if you turn unto me and keep my Commandments and do them though they were of You cast out unto the uttermost parts of Heaven yet I will gather them from hence and will bring them into the place that I have chosen to set my name oh can you imagine this fella I have a promise Lord I want that promise restored in me I'm admitting that my fathers have left you and we've been departed of your ways but you said if we'd return what's he saying I'm returning Lord I'm returning I'm coming back to you I've transgressed I've sinned I've failed I haven't done what I should do but I'm returning to you Lord I admit that I'm away from you but I need you he's on the path to being restored his heart's full he has no place to turn he has no entrance into the Throne of God but God provided something for him what was it his word when he found that word now he has an entrance to the kingdom and he walks in there and tells the King Kings the one that has rule over the mind of the king he's serving and he says you will gather him because you have chosen to put your name this is the land you gave my fathers this is my inheritance this is my promise this is where your son is going to return and it's not ready for him Lord you said you return for me maybe how to get ready maybe I ought to put a little more effort into it may it ought to be just a little more serious to me and he goes on he says now these are thy servants and thy people whom doubt hath redeemed by the great power and by the strong hand oh Lord what's he saying Lord you've done it before you can do it again oh Lord I beseech thee let now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and I want you to notice what he recognizes himself as a servant we're all should be servants and the and to the prayer of thy servants plural considering that other people have the same burden he does and who desire to fear thy name and prosper I want us to prosper I want us to fear the name of the Lord I want us to uphold this message and the messenger that God sent in the utmost reverence in the utmost respect because it is the hand of God in our day cannot ashamed of it I'm trying to live it but I hope I'm not the only one right this is what he's saying I know I'm not the only one the prophet went to him I believe I forget who it was Isaiah my mind or one of the prophets and they went up to the Lord and they said Lord am I the only one he said no because there's 300 people here that have empowered their name was it three thousand three hundred seven thousand ooh sounds like seven Church ages and a whole lot of types I better not get going he says there's other people that feel this way isn't that just what Satan does he isolates us and make us feel that we're the only one we're the only one that's got burdens we're left alone you know what I say get back in the fight go get your Shield again we'll talk about this later we're going to close now this is the second chapter is better in the first maybe we'll talk about that tonight who knows so Lord I beseech thee now hear thy servant attentive to the prayers of thy servant and to the prayers of thy servants I want you to see how beautiful that is Lord don't only hear my prayer but hear the prayers of the people that are praying hear clever's prayer here all the prayers of the people in the house of the Lord amen hear noelle's prayer here here brother Tim and sister Melinda's prayer here brother Mike in Ellen's prayer hear Big John's prayer here Matt and Heidi's prayer I'll go through the congregation Lord hear their prayers too can you understand sometimes how really disconnected we are from the very restoration that we're supposed to be a part of this is the path to Restoration these kind of attitudes these kind of prayers these kinds of feelings are going to get the Faith of Our Fathers back because if it's not the Faith of Our Fathers it's a demonstration of power without character in that satanic just like the lady he said she's a good lady but she wasn't taught right she was in the flesh now if you run out and you don't have these basic Christian principles of love one for another and a burden one for another everything else is for naught though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and I do all these great works and have not charity what am I nothing I'm a sounding symbol I'm a tinkling brass in other words my life doesn't have a message and that's what we want we want the restoration of the message of Jesus Christ that's what's being restored to this church is the message that our fathers had who was the first fruit of that message that was waved before us where did we see what the demonstration of was a Christian that came to maturity that had that love that had that word that believed it that was making this intercession he was John the gospel the prayer of Jesus 17 in living flesh and now we've seen something before us that were to be restored to if you don't know what you're going to if you don't know what it is he's Desiring you to be if you don't know what it is that he wants restored we just played that on the tape for us then we don't know which where to go so part of the path of restoration is the preparation of yourself God positioned you where you are he placed you in this message how many thanked the Lord for that amen thank you Lord man I'd hate to be serving Mass man worse than that I hate to be a priest how would I look in a black suit with a little collar saying a rosary I don't mean to mock them but it's Babylon read hyssops to Babylons it's Babylonian Pagan worship the same rituals the same priesthood the same hierarchy in the Roman Catholic church today with all her daughters I want to be a part of that I want to be part of what God's restoring the word back into the heart of his pride and he closes in this way I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the Kings compare oh what what a distinct prayer God show me mercy in the sight of the king for I'm his cup Bearer we have not because we ask not and we don't ask because we don't know what we're to ask for and that's why I'd like to say this again in closing that's why you want to get reunited with this book this is the book of request to be made known to the Lord this is where you go to find out and and don't say well I followed the message wait a minute the message in the Bible are identical I do not separate them in any shame what part of its history part of its living today so I can see what he did because what he was yesterday he is today every promise in this book applies to my day and my hour I can go here and know what I can ask for I can go to the message of the hour and know the god that can keep that word they work like two sites okay they'll set you in the right direction they're the same thing your heart's burning with desire and he makes this final plea Lord give me grace and mercy in the sight of this man and then then the book gets real good because guess what you think he finds that Mercy I say yay do you think he accomplishes the work that God has him to do I say yay because my God can do anything but what fail have faith little flock because it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you believe that this morning you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and all of you there's no big eyes there's just us little use but who's on our side if God before us who can be against it may that be restored in our hearts this morning that God's for us let's stand together this morning [Applause] amen I probably should say it again I I appreciate sometimes you clapping because you enjoyed the scripture and everything but you know brother Branham really spoke against that did you know that anyway so I I thank you for it and and don't make it personal but maybe just look up about what he kind of said it's all about him uh we're we're talking about what do I have to do to get to the place where my faith is restored that I can ask anything in my father's name and he'll do it I want to have Lord have mercy on me that your father would find favor with me when I speak [Music] to him in your name amen this is a a great song and and we'll sing a verse of it and then we'll sing something else but okay you know how you create a clean heart in you how many knows how you do that by the washing of the water of the word amen maybe this morning if the Lord dealt with your heart in some way and you've maybe felt a little tug to seek more or what it would be that God would have you to do in life you're a part of a body not just locally but worldwide Body of Christ and every pump of your heart makes this body live and we just trust this morning that if the enemy has made you feel that you're not a park I'm here to tell you this morning that you are and he's a liar and there's no truth in him he died for you this morning and he said nothing will pluck you out of the palm of his hand he said my sheep will hear my voice in another they will not follow and Lord I just pray this morning that our hearts desire is to be restored to the true message and the true spirit that was brought in this day by your messenger and Lord not Lord not to criticize because what does it matter if they tarry tell you come our commission is to follow you [Music] and Lord we know this path of restoration is the understanding that you've placed this where you've chosen and we prepare our hearts and we make our petition known [Music] and may all of us take a burden on for our brothers and sisters that this mind that was in Christ May manifest In the Flesh of your bride we pray with all our hearts Lord so by the washing of the word of God we pray that you would create a new spirit in each of our hearts this morning As we sing this little chord amen oh create [Music] a clean [Music]

you go it's it's not just the church here that you represent you represent him and that's the most important thing that when you go you're going representing the Lord Jesus Christ that you love and serve this morning I'll let Billy have a dismissal song is there if you have anybody have a special request they'd like to lift their hand to the Lord before that God could do something exceedingly

circumstances and situations or maybe their selves are facing Financial hardship or health issues maybe they have loved ones father nor but they have a burden on their heart and they would love to see
