soldier with us tonight i don't want to call him old but we're happy to have brother jeremy with us he's one of those ministers that i don't think it's fair that he can sing and preach both but you know i said i'd rather sing guy told me you can't do either one so so but i'm so happy to have him brother jeremy so i've asked him if he would sing so if he's got two gifts he might as well use them both right and so we're grateful for that so i went out you just may be seated i guess and we'll just ask here i just found out tonight that that they're related some way to the mackie so i thought that was pretty good i don't know how exactly it all works but it's great so jeremy happy to have you and there's the piano and whatever you want to do and sing for it he said whatever i want to do there's a difference there amen you're doing pretty good over there yourself but um actually there's a song that we've been singing as a congregational back at home and maybe we can try to do that over there if i can get this out of here you love and hate technology all at once first i want to say it is a privilege to be here tonight and our family just came in and just was trying to well i'm going to break this pad or this thing all in once we're going to try to sneak in tonight but that doesn't work sometimes and that's all right i guess we'll survive and i hope that you will survive amen hallelujah there we go i'm going to try amen this is just a kind of a worship song that we've been singing at home hopefully we can just worship the lord with you on it thank you for your mercy thank you for your love it's all about your grace lord it's consuming like a fire through the trial you have brought me you raised the standard held the flood i hold my every breath lord for all that you have done let's try that again oh i thank you for your mercy sing if you know it thank you for your love it's all about your grace lord it's consuming like a fire [Music] every breath lord for all that you have done oh here it is now lord i thank you for your healing oh my soul is now set free i'm no longer in that prison for your pieces over me through the trial you've brought me you've raised the standard held [Music] aren't you thankful that healing oh i thank you for your healing are you set free oh my soul is now set free i'm no longer that reason for your peace is over me has he brought you through through the trial you have brought me you've raised the standard oh i owe my every breath lord for all that you have done through the trial you've brought me you've raised [Music] oh owe my every breath lord for all that you have done amen don't you owe everything to him amen he is worthy of all praise honor and glory for everything that he has done there's a song that maybe you know it here i sing it a lot do you know jesus be jesus and me if not i can ask my wife to come up but if you know it you go for it what key where there you are right there f um is it all right if we just stand and sing this song together [Music] before we jump into this word which is the most important thing make sure everything is out of the way do you have a need tonight that you know that only god can meet that need there's nothing that i can do if your pastor was here there's nothing he could do if brother branham was here there's nothing that he could do except your faith accept that what we need is jesus and we want him to be complete take complete preeminence of the service so let's just sing this together now jesus [Music] be jesus [Music] no longer [Music] oh resurrection [Music] jesus oh jesus and [Music] me won't you feel [Music] jesus be jesus in me resurrection power sing that last part now with that resurrection heavenly father lord you see every heart here this evening lord as we take this time to open up your word lord and speak these things father that you've laid upon our heart lord we ask that you would just i give myself to you lord and i ask that you would speak through me now through these few moments and god that there would be a heart tonight maybe that would be open and i open my heart to you lord and i say father if there's anything that's out of the way would you make it correct father lord of nothing else that we want father we have not come here tonight none of us i believe as believers lord to be seen or to be heard but to sit at your feet and to hear your word lord so now we ask again that you would please speak to our hearts as we surrender ourselves to you we love you and we thank you for it in jesus name amen god bless you this evening let's open our bibles to the book of matthew chapter five i do want to say that uh i'm looking for troy i can't miss him there you are and troy there's kelly there and so high hallelujah i told brother uh brother mcgary i said i wanted to say thank you for uh taking good care of my our family and so we're so thankful i've seen someone else up here just a little bit ago christian too i believe was up here so good to see you all greetings from north of north texas it's weird that you have to travel five hours south east to get to north texas but greetings from amarillo texas we love you we appreciate you we're going to speak on something tonight that is very simple and i i am a worker myself so i'll do my very best to not hold you too long but i believe this is relevant it's been a series that we've spoke at home uh i my son asked me he said what are you speaking on i said well if the lord leads we're going to speak on a portion of the beatitudes he says that means we're going to be there a while i said no we're not going to go through the whole thing trust me just what the lord leads tonight verse 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit don't we don't you think this is relevant today i don't want to get so caught up on what we think is revelation and what gets us to it you know there's so many people that claim to believe brother branham a god sent a prophet but yet they don't have the life that he had you know so i say this is relevant for us as believers this is not just a sunday school story hallelujah blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth and blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled amen you can be seated this evening i know that this is probably something that has been taught and so maybe if i could stir the gift that lies within you this evening and not try to bring anything new but encourage us as believers to know that though we claim a message and we claim that god sent a prophet and we we you know we claim to have these experiences that there's also a life that we as believers must live and i don't think that jesus just took this sermon lightly i think it was extremely important for us as believers and as we try to jump through this quickly we look first we're just going to try if we can to do the first four this simply blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven now defining blessed to be blessed means to be approved or to find approval in this case approved of god and the and there can be no higher blessing i want to be approved by you but there's no higher blessing than the approval of god how many can say amen so the fundamental question that we let everyone who reads the sermon on a mount is faced with is this whose approval will you seek will you seek man's approval or god's approval proverbs 16 18 and 19 says pride goeth before destruction in a haughty or arrogant spirit before a fall better it is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud so we simply know this being taught that being humble is the opposite of of pride pride says you do not need god take for instance the first fall in this thought process genesis 3 5 for god doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil now there was something that had to be appealing and i don't want to get doctrinal or dive too much but let's just look it into our humanity there was something that was appealing about that temptation and it was that they would no longer be dependent on god think about it what is the thing that every young person faces you remember if you're not too far from youth is that i can try to prove it i can try to prove that i'm not going to be that young person i can try to prove that i can be different and in that first start of the that process which might be starting on the right foot we try to do it on our own because we want to try to prove that we're not that person we're not this one and that we can do it on our own and then it turns into a self-righteous attitude and so that first temptation was that they're no longer to be dependent upon god so every day of their lives up to that point were examples of being totally dependent upon god back in the garden every day until this point they were totally dependent upon god one reason for that fall is that they no longer wanted to be dependent think about this now again just look at this this idea of it anyone but themselves and we've been living that way ever since they wanted to know she wanted to know what this was going to be like right she wanted to know uh uh you know all of all of the answers she wanted to have all the answers what is the what is the question of today the youth of today are the thought processes is we want to have an answer for everything we want we want to be able to have it explained in detail if you can't explain to me perfectly in a scientific way then you know i'm just not going to believe it and so it's always been something that has from from the beginning to where we are today is something that we see is is is very strong and rampant especially since we're at this final moment of history that poor in spirit means to be totally dependent on god psalms 51 16 i hope you don't mind if i read a portion from the amplified tonight for if you delight not in sacrifice uh for you deny delight not in sacrifice or else else would i give it you find no pleasure and burn offering verse 17 my sacrifice the sacrifice acceptable to god is a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart broken down with sorrow for sin and humbly and thoroughly pentanent such oh god you will not despise so as we are finding in these beatitudes there is something that has to happen to us as an individual that if the before you can carry on into a i would say further and deeper revelation we first must come to the understanding that we must be humble we must be poor in spirit we must have that broken and contrite heart it's not coming back to god it's like you find a lot of times today where people that that leave the church and they go out and they sow their seeds they do whatever they do and then they come back and there's some spirits that come back and when they do they come back with the attitude of well i want you to accept me i want you there's no opinion i want i want to res i want to go right back to a status first of all church worshiping god is not a status no you've got to come back and this is not even just for somebody that walks out this is for sometimes we as believers if we're not careful we backslide right in a pew and we've got to come right back to the very beginning we must be poor in spirit jesus said blessed are they happy are the poor happy are they that are of a broken heart happy are they that are humble this is not the american way this is not the worldly way to to come to a position where we have to understand that it's not about me it's we're dependent holy upon god what is he looking for he's looking for that humble heart it is not a man's confession listen to this that he is insignificant so it's not that you he wants you to come up here and say oh how horrible a person you are it's not that man's confession that he's insignificant or personally without value because that would not simply be true rather it is a confession that we by nature are sinful rebellious and in need of god's mercy and forgiveness we all have to come to that understanding that by nature we need a nature change because we are all by nature rebellious and sinners and we all have to come back to that ho to that that that position of being humble before god it is admitting that we are nothing without him now the practical if you would criteria for being poor in spirit is if i can just mention a few things and just trying to skip through here i apologize if i'm speaking too quickly i'll try to slow down if i can but a poor in spirit listen to this now is not thinking poorly of yourself it is thinking properly of yourself it is not that you think in a negative position to yourself it is not that you say oh i'm just a horrible and if that's what uh is being taught across america that is an incorrect teaching we are not to think poorly of ourself but properly that we need it is a proper thought process that i need god i cannot do anything without him i i can be a church member but i absolutely need god more than anything else i need him more than a friend i need him more than a spouse i need him more than education i need him more than a job i need him more than church membership i just need god now because if we if we're not careful satan likes to use this thinking improperly of ourselves and it turns into a false humility because false humility is just as bad as as the pride that breeds it because false humility is still pride because you're still focused on yourself let that sink in so i don't want to be focused on myself i don't want to be focused on all of the negative i want to be focused on what god can do when i come to the position of just being humble before the lord now poor in spirit is knowing yourself so you've got to know who you are you've got to know yourself accepting yourself and being yourself for the glory of god now it's not like it's not like uh in some aspects of religion to where you know you've got to accept me who i am and how i am and you've got to accept this attitude and you've got to accept these explosions and you've got to accept my you know my irish blood or my german blood i hope i'm not stepping on the media there but i don't know what blood i got but when it comes down to it i'm thinking for the blood of christ because it changes amen who i who i was but it's so it's it's it's coming to this realization that being in spirits knowing yourself accepting yourself and being yourself for the glory of god so i cannot be our brother here he cannot be me i cannot be you you cannot be me we we have to be accept what god has brought us to and accept that if we can be humble in spirit that there's so much god can do for us you are the vessel he chose and is desiring to use you if he brought you into this he's desiring to use you but before he can use you jesus says you gotta first be poor in spirit so so many are are either gaining pride in themselves so there's two sides of the spectrum here or overcome with self-doubt or false humility being poor in spirit does not mean you must be financially poor either or biblically illiterate didn't jesus tell the rich young ruler to go and sell everything and then come follow him right yes he did aren't riches among the thorns which choke the word of god keeping it from being fruitful in a person's life true again however money is not the problem the real issue is a heart condition you and i could be financially poor tonight and have nothing of value and still not be poor in spirit see as we'll see the heart of the popper may still be rich and full of self some may say that we need to be spiritually rich we need a wealth of biblical knowledge to make us mature in our faith i follow what i'm saying now but maturity is not dependent upon your biblical knowledge well there was a lot of people that had biblical knowledge that jesus walked before and they couldn't recognize who he was but again i'm not saying you to be illiterate study to show yourself approved right but again you cannot say oh bless god i've been in this message so long ain't nobody can outdo me well what kind of uh heart condition do you have so so we have to have an obedience to the word of god and when you have revelation now follow what i'm saying here it's all right to pray for revelation we need to you'll see brother branham said pray for revelation and then he also talked about time speed be careful praying for revelation why because satan might give you something and anything that's smarter than what you are if you get it it makes you feel like you revelated now all right moving on hurry up the poor and spirit have three common character traits because uh genuine spiritual poverty has these qualities brokenness humility and dependence so brokenness is that that one trait that we need brokenness is the beginning of change in our lives just because we're in church doesn't mean that we're broken and and i don't want to be broken because someone breaks me which i can't get ahead because it listen the beatitudes all tie together but these first three and four are so important they're all important so i'm not negating the rest we we believe we are strong but suddenly we understand how weak we really are our perceived strength also keeps us from seeing god for who he is the more we look into ourself the less we see of god until we are broken we see god in our image with the same limitations but once broken we can see god's omnipotent power until you think about that the lord is nigh unto them psalms 34 18 that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit brother branham says in enticing spirit say god let me from this holy this day be holy thine lord i come with a broken heart i come with a contrite spirit i love you you know i love you oh i'm so glad he knows that we love him as the song says break me lord and bless the broken pieces the poor and spirit are humble what is humility the dictionary defines humility as a lack of vanity or self-importance but genuine humility is not self-abasement or degrading of itself when we put ourselves down as unworthy or incapable it's really still a type of pride why because pride because pride in any form focuses on self brothers and sisters let me just let me just stop here and give you a a clause tonight i'm not trying to be evangelistical i'm just going to teach if i can so let's just i say god help me all right so as we just passed down the the la one of the other things that we're saying is we must be dependent on god so as i go back real quick i've wanted to bring this out see now jesus did not put on a false humility saying i'm a nobody how many can say jesus was humble right well it says it uh philippians 2 6-8 who being in the form of god thought of not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so jesus was humble but he didn't say i'm a nobody jesus knew his identity so you've got to know who you are and what god has for you without becoming arrogant this is the battle of the flesh right so we must be dependent upon god sometimes the most difficult words to say are i need help i can't make it alone we would rather say i can do it myself or i've earned it none of us like problems right or difficulties in our lives i would assume so we are much happier how many is happier tonight when everything just goes smoothly well just the traffic here is enough to say that's not happening i can tell you i'm not complaining about amarillo that's all i can say but we have to understand that we must come to a humility of spirit depend full dependence on god and we cannot have the spirit of laodicea in our life what was that spirit because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked we must be dependent upon him and him alone it's the first thing that jesus said blessed are the poor in spirit blessed are they that are humble that are broken they're a contrite spirit you know i'm not it's like a child sometimes a child when they get caught what do they do they cry because they were caught that didn't mean that they're actually broken just because you cry doesn't mean you're broken or that you are of a contrite spirit no we cry and i will get into this we i want to say god break my heart where i don't fall into this again blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed which steps right into the next one blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted that word mourn is to grieve as we see the progression of these thoughts we see how the first ties into the second because the first step of a blessed life is the recognition that we are poor in spirit that we have a deep need in our lives a need caused by our sin we learned that the first step is acknowledging that we are nothing without him and our desperate need for a savior brother branham says the holy ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else in this world your prestige your life your job your anything that there is you should not cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the mo and you say well i'm afraid they that i'm afraid that they at my work i'm afraid that my husband don't be afraid let that be the first place let everything else go let that be first well i expect to get it one of these days brother branham not one of these days now this is the time let it be first before i do anything else let me have it now he said desperate that would help answer our question when you get desperate for it really got to have it or die oh i say god tonight there we don't have to pray for years and years for the holy ghost if you want it with all of your heart it's a promise for everyone that's that desiring it it's promise it's just like healing healing you know there was not even even a there's not even a clause in healing the bible said by whose stripes that we are healed which we know that's talking of christ that there was no clause that you had clause that you have to be a believer to be healed and yet being healed sometimes in a message church if we're not careful becomes the hardest thing and a lot of times we only look at healing of the flesh like a you know don't get me wrong i'm thankful for these things but a lot of times what we need in in churches today is spiritual healing i mean healing of the mind healing of that soul breaking the chains oh but we've got to be desperate for it and recognize that it's in his word for you as a believer hallelujah so we then move to this next step and ble and i would like to read that verse four blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted and the amplified allow me to read it again blessed and enviably happy with the happiness produced by the experience of god's favor especially conditioned by the revelation of his matchless grace are they those who mourn for they shall be comforted happy are they that mourn you ever went to a party brother a birthday party and everyone was happy because they were mourning i don't really know how to say this but i thought it was pretty good when i was studying this before it says christostem i think is his name we made this statement says we may remark that this blessing is given not simply but with great force and emphasis it is not simply who have grief but who mourn and indeed this command is the sum of all philosophy for if they who mourn for the death of children or kinfolk throughout all that season of their sorrow are touched with no other desires let this sink in as of money or honor burn not with envy feel not wrongs nor are open to any other vicious passion but are solely given up to their grief much more ought they who mourn their own sins in such manner as they ought to mourn for them you take that person as he was uh explaining here when they are involved in that moment of grief because of that lost loved one that has just passed money is not in their mind this is not in their mind that's not in their mind but they are completely surrounded by that mourning or that grief moment how much more we as believers that that recognize what we have done is not against a church it's not against a pastor it's not against an evangelist but it's against a loving god happy are those that mourn they have mourned over their sin they've grieved over it think about it they have grieved over this moment brother brown says you see the trouble today we've got so much money and stuff on our mind that god can't have a place to get into our thinking and he said here in the beginning he said blessed are they that mourn i'm going to skip through a few things and i'm going to come to this position where it says there is the mourning caused by our own sin it is not only the sins now i do want to back up say this that we should mourn for the sins of our city we should never become so arrogant that it does not not just because we're better than they are that was also given to us in the scripture i'm glad i'm not like he is no there should be a mourning in our heart because of what is happening to our loving savior all right so as we move this we don't want it to just be that but it is not only the sins of others that should cause tears for we have our own sins to weep over as well our sins grieve god and therefore should grieve us as well none of us who are saved really want to sin none of us that are filled with the holy ghosts and have received a revelation of the hour really want to sin we really want to live pure lives before god can you say amen to that and before the world right we want to live a pure life not a holier than thou life but a life that is humble before before god and a humble before the world because we know of what the things the sins that god has pulled us from and the thing the grief that he has pulled us out of how much more we could say god do this for this individual and do this for them there's a song that a brother in my church thing and you'll probably know this and it's called feel the nails and an old song that been sung for years and it comes to the part i don't want to hurt you again what are you saying i never want to hurt you again you ever just love someone so much that you don't want to hurt them if you have a spouse you don't just lord help me here you don't just husbands you don't just go out there and and not do things that you shouldn't do just because you don't want to get caught but if you truly love them you don't do things out there the same with the spouse why because you don't want to hurt them you love them you see i don't come to church tonight just because i don't want the pastor to preach against me next sunday i don't get on my knees and pray because i don't want to hear about prayer life again i don't turn on a sermon just because you know i better do it because brother mcgarry said if i don't listen to a ceremony i'm going to go to hell i don't know if you said that or not but you just i'm just just let me be that way for a minute he can fix it let me just be jewish for a moment oh no we why why why do we do these things as believers because we love him you know when i was a kid i wanted to go to church and serve god because i didn't want to go to hell you know i heard do y'all steal every now and then hear a hellfire and brimstone sermon i'm sure you might every now and then it might be different but you we all hear them well that's all right that's okay we need to hear him every now and then but you see i don't wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna come to church just because i don't wanna go to hell you know i used to think how could it be said that if i end up in hell i would still love god how could it be said i used to think that until i met him oh then there was a revelation oh god i don't even deserve to be here i don't even deserve to lift my hands i don't deserve to sing i don't deserve to minister lord there's a humility he says god without you i'd be nothing and if i ended up there lord i would still sir i'd still love you with all of my heart but it takes revelation and not just a mental revelation there's got to be a heart change i don't want to hurt you lord but what do we do as humans we try and we fail now i know there's some of you that have reached perfection and i'm sorry so you can just skip through this for a moment what makes us behave the way we do we don't want to get irritable at least i hope you don't but we do no don't be looking at your spouses now we want to control our temper but sometimes we fail we don't want to speak unkind words but sometimes it just seemed to come out of us why does there seem to be such a war in us even paul was grieved with himself o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death romans 7 24 his desire to do good he found himself struggling with that opposite side again i understand you know that some of you all have reached and attained some things so just pray for me that i can reach your level the man or woman who can no longer grieve over sin is in a serious condition the person whose heart is broken because of sin is ready to be comforted but that one that cannot be broken the by what does he say blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted but if you're not broken over your sin he cannot comfort you this is not my words this is not the words of your pastor this is not even let me just say it's not even the words of of brother branham this is the words of jesus all right you follow what i'm saying second corinthians 7 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death i don't want to just be sorry because i'm caught i want to be sorry because i don't want to hurt him again so you see the progression here we we we come to this position where we are poor in spirit we're broken for it and then we move into this position and not not only are we broken for but now we're we're grievous of our sins we don't want to go back to that position and when we step into that realm then we can be comforted listen you if you're looking to be comforted from the from the pastor or comforted from your spouse or comforted from the church that's not always going to happen because we're looking for comfort in flesh and flesh will fail i don't care how much holy ghost we got in one another and god we we as a bouquet we are there to encourage one another don't get me wrong that's not what i'm saying but we've got what happened to faith what happened to knowing that god is there in that moment because you're broken in your contract this is true for the believer who sins he sins and is guilty he feels cast down and remorseful he mourns over his sin and this drives him back to jesus in repentance peace returns joy is restored how many is thankful how many remembers that time when you found yourself in that and then god began to deal with your heart and god began to break your heart and you begin to become remorseful oh i don't want to do this and what began to happen he began to give you that peace again that joy began to be restored because you were drove to repentance his spirit is revived and he is comforted david knew how to get back with god didn't he he was a repentant of man mourned over his sin psalm 69 29 says but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvational god set me upon high i will praise the name of god with the song and will magnify him with thanksgiving this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hooves the humble shall seek this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek god jesus said blessed are those that mourn for they shall be comforted the reason those who mourn are blessed is because of the comfort that's available our grief and our sorrow drives us to the source of all comfort our lord himself who gives us the comforting presence of the holy spirit you come to the position tonight where you say i'm sorry for my sin i'm sorry for what i've done i'm sorry lord i don't want to let you down when was the last time that we really said that god i don't want to let you down i know you don't want to let your spouse down you want to let the church down but god i don't want to let you down i don't want to fall into that position anymore i want to serve you with all of my heart i want to give everything to you i'm thankful for this message but listen you've got to have a life that is repentant and humble and broken blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth are we okay on time i've lost track of it so i'm already lost when y'all shut me down i'll shut trust me i'll hear it i'll feel it we know ministers know this don't we brother matthew this again is this my water it is now this again is is a full on continuous growth in relationship blessed are the meek this is a continual growth between god and man and it cannot be done without the first it's got to be a growth a process poor in spirit and mourn and that word meek to be mild or humble are you getting the drift that these all tie together they literally almost have the same meanings now this is something that we want to take in consideration can you truly be meek and happy at the same time can you picture a meek person who is a happy person the world can't you probably find it rather challenging because the world what the world thinks as meekness is weakness our misunderstanding of meekness creates this diffic difficulty in a world that thinks only an aggressive hard-working person can get ahead in life it is hard to believe that those who are meek will inherit anything much less the earth let that sink in he did not imply that being fearful or weak brings happiness instead jesus referred to attitude or outlook the meekness he described requires us to be strong people who are grounded in christ it demands us to have a personal relationship with god this kind of meekness inevitably brings happiness meekness is the way to happiness for several reasons now one of the definitions of that meekness the thayer's definition is mildness of character gentleness of spirit and also meekness meekness towards god is that disposition of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good and therefore without disputing or resisting well that's difficult in our humanity the meek know that god is in control and his word cannot fail thus they trust in him isaiah 41 17 when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue filleth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them but how hard is it to trust in that moment when you're in the moment see gentleness or meekness is the opposite to self-assertiveness and self-interest it stems from trust in god's goodness and control over the situation now this is so important meekness maintains an even temperament i'm just going to stop right there and say lord help me again i'm going to eventually attain your perfectness but i say lord i want to maintain that's why we die daily we crucify this fleck this flesh now you know i'm messing with you because i know you're all human out there y'all get the halos down for a few moments thank you i'm going to by the grace of god aristotle defined meekness as the mean between two extremes intense anger and excessive indifference it is the happy medium between too much anger and too little passion william barclay suggested that the beatitude be translated blessed it is a man who is always angry at the right time and never angry at the wrong time but how can we develop this even temperament let me just tell you one way it don't work you're not going to wake up tomorrow and say bless god today i'm going to be meek i'm sorry to burst your bubble but that just doesn't work that way it takes the holy spirit and it takes you coming to being poor in spirit right it's this process to get to meekness so and not none of this righteous indignation boy that's used a lot in this message maybe i should step off of that for a moment how can we avoid the extremes of severe anger or apathy we can't but god can do it for us what we cannot do for ourselves god can do for us we and now listen i'm not just going to sit back and say god you just do it for me no we step into his will we step into his plan we we say lord i'm open jesus be jesus and me no longer me but thee right so we do this through salvation and through the baptism of the holy ghost through being born again this is a work in our lives that god can begin to work and to deal with you and knowing with the right time to be balanced in situations where meekness must take must take root and it's important and it comes with the holy spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law notice now look even look at the disciples the difference in the disciples before pentecost after they were not perfect but you could see a full change in attitude a full change in attitude from peter from one moment cutting the air off of a soldier to the next moment silver and gold have a number such as i have give i thee what was the change the holy ghost did he not have revelation of something before the holy ghost oh hello folks we had a revelation he had an understanding of who god was but even with the revelation of who god was he still denied him you got to be born again think about the character of meekness by explanation if we could it is not weakness as many suppose but it is a mild character it is a gentle spirit now we know we as church folks have a have have a really easy time of sitting in the church and all of a sudden we begin to think of people yeah he's really talking about that one i don't know if i was just feeling that as it was jumping across or just reminding you let's just focus on what god is dealing with ourselves all right mild character gentle spirit it is the opposite as we just said of self-assertiveness or self-interest now by illustration the positive side let's think about this it is a soothing medicine meekness it sues or i cannot say it is like a soothing medicine it's that medicine is there to to soothe uh if you would that that fever or uh to calm the you know the body during sickness the negative side of it is an overdose of that same medicine can kill you all right a gentle breeze it's refreshing on a hot day especially today refreshing but a raging wind what does it do damages the rain something that can clear the air and brings forth life right but too much rain destroys any roads and soil and washes away life so how does this apply meekness is essentially power under control it is power that god gives his people which is now under control because if you use medicine in the right you know you follow what i'm saying you use medicine in the right frame it is there to help and it soothes right how many thankful well y'all might not be i'm thankful in the panhandle for rain i i'm thankful for rain but too much of it is a bad thing so we need to find the balance it again is the character of spirit in which we accept god's dealings with us as good and therefore without disputing or resisting it is the inner voice that tells the self that god knows what he's doing so just calm down and do not get bent out of shape or get out of control or lose your temper okay keep your thoughts to yourself again another thing meekness does is it develops self-control often it was used to express the idea of self-control for instance an animal that otherwise would have been wild but had been made a house pet was then called meek the animal had learned to respond favorably to commands and behaved properly in other words the beatitude could be translated blessed are they who are entirely self-controlled now it only comes through god that's what i'm trying to say it comes through him weakness is giving in to the worst that is in you but meekness is the mastery over it to be meek does not mean that you are cowardly but it does mean that you're strong enough not to retaliate when wrongly treated though having their rights those who are meek do not insist on them possessing great ability those who are meek do not flaunt it they would rather forgive than accuse self-self such self-control results in peace with oneself now i'm not here to try to preach to you some yoga mentality that's not what this is about but you do have to have confidence and trust in god you have to be at peace with whatever god has placed for you in your life and there's going to be circumstances and situations that's going to come your way listen god does not wake up in the morning i did not expect that to happen to you no he knows everything he was not surprised the moment that you gave your life to him like some of us are surprised at other people god was never surprised so he knows everything before the foundation of the world your name was in his mind and we have to be at peace that whatever circumstance comes my way whatever storm comes my way god has a way through it so those who cannot control their anger greed lust tongue or ambition will never be at peace within they will constantly be at war with themselves constantly searching how many has ever been there before i'm going to be honest i've been there what i i wasn't i wasn't that at peace i wasn't at peace with what god had for me i wasn't at peace with the circumstances i wanted to be like this one i wanted it to go this way why can't i be this why can't i have this guy to church why can't and we just begin searching and looking and then we cannot control we've got to have meekness think about this once moses met the burning bush he did not try to deliver israel his own way from that point on he trusted in god before he was a murderer after he pleaded for life you know the story what is it what does the bible say about moses numbers 12 3 now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth i mean a guy that killed somebody that was before the burning bush brother branham says take a person walk up big what they can do and all this thing don't you ever pay attention to that god's spirit is a meek spirit humble spirit full of love and compassion looking to all people and bringing all people to a knowledge of christ let's not lose sight while we're still here we're still here for souls and that includes souls that are in the church hey let's not be so please understand what i'm trying to say in a balance here let's not be so as it were looking outside of the church and forget what we have here to pray for one another and encourage one another and have that meekness and humility and in this meekness the bible says we are assured of a victory what does it say you shall inherit the earth right psalms 37 9-11 for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace psalms 22 26 says the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him and your heart shall live forever think about this now it is significant that jesus said the meek shall inherit and not capture the earth for an inheritor is a receiver not an aggressor god in his providence has structured the world so that the meek are certain to inherit it meekness is so hard to and listen you cannot just naturally develop a godly meekness i cannot tell myself to be meek because i guarantee you as soon as i tell myself to be meek satan heard it but god never intended on you to do it yourself he intended on you to have confidence in him that his holy spirit would help you through those times how many is thankful for that because by nature most people are aggressors we need a transformation meekness is knowing god knows this pain you are going through and is part of a greater plan trusting god through the trial as job though he slay me i will trust him that's having meekness in your life knowing that i don't know you know i'm not even asking to bring it on you don't even don't ask for trouble in trials because folks as long as you're breathing you're going to have them but a meek person has submitted to the lord's sovereignty and authority in his life and is full trusting him to take care of him in every situation that may come up and he is willing to give up his rights and privileges to stay under god's authority that's the attitude of a meek person i want to quickly get through this last one if you don't mind hunger and thirst for righteousness bless because this i believe is very important of following we again understand the continuing growth of the believer blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness it is again quite odd to see jesus saying happy is the individual who's hungry and thirsty because we were made to be hungry and thirsty it is a natural desire some of you our stomachs are probably growling right now trying to see if you guys were like yeah you're right it's this it's a natural desire to be thirsty and hungry so jesus again uses this common pain to illustrate the desire for righteousness that word hunger comes through the meaning through the idea of a pinching toil a yearning to famish and to crave that thirst suffer thirst and dehydration and righteousness equity or fairness of character right standing with god look at this for a few moments the word hunger and thirst here now some of you i pray that you forgive me if i don't get this exact correct but just bear with me in my folly are in what is called the imperfect tense which means that it is continuous action in other words you must always be hungering and thirsting for righteousness to be in right relationship with god it is like saying you eat today and are satisfied but tomorrow you are hungry again even the expression of the word righteousness in the original language has great meaning in the greek grammar there is this thing called the genitive case and the accusative case the genitive case is expressed by the word of such as when we say i would like a slice of bread of bread is the genitive case which means we don't want the whole loaf we only want a part of the loaf a slice or if we ask for a glass of water you know that i don't want the whole picture or the whole well i just want a glass but in the accusative case it means just the opposite it means that the person wants the whole loaf and all of the water in the picture so when jesus said blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness guess what the word righteousness was in in the accusative in other words jesus is saying blessed is the person who is always hungry and always thirsting to be in a right relationship with god in every area of our life i don't want just part of the loaf i want the whole loaf i don't want just a sip tonight god i want you to just just give me all that you have and this is a constant relationship a constant craving and yearning now you say i thought we were never to thirst again we're not to the thirst for the world again we're not to thirst for those things out there anymore but we're hungering and thirsting for righteousness and this is a continual relationship that jesus was saying when this occurs it does not mean that we're just like fatten like filling of an animal but we are continually satisfied oh i'm hey if you're just getting filled or something to eat at church you're in the wrong frame of mind but it is a daily relationship i don't want to just be hungering and thirsting just because it's sunday morning service no but this is a daily hungering and thirsting for righteousness for a closer walk with god for more of him why because again it starts being poor in spirit breaking that spirit breaking that flesh breaking those mentalities breaking those spirits and then coming and once all of that is clear and out of the way something begins to move and to churn in your life where you're saying god i don't know why i'm just craving more of you i can't wait to listen to another sermon i can't wait to put on another message i can't wait to hear the next sermon at church i can't wait to get through those doors i don't even care who's preaching lord i just want to hear your word it doesn't matter who's singing lord i just want to worship you lord why because you're a daily constantly asking for more of god continual satisfaction before brother branham says before there is a creation there has to be a creator blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness see there is something in us he he's talking to a people group of people as he asked them to raise their hands he said you raised your hand a while ago i want more of god see there is something there in you how many remembers deep calling to the deep there's something inside of you and what you know there's got to be something to respond to that listen i'm not just here for religion oh i'm not just here to have a moment of shout i say god let me live a life that is so close to you that when i walk around someone lord they'll feel that presence of humility and they'll say i want some more of that hallelujah i don't know how maybe you've ever been to like a theme park or or whatever you go to or somewhere i've even been to places to where did you ever heard where actual restaurants will send out the smell of food and they'll do that at theme parks they'll kind of it's like shoot it out and you're walking by and you're just like i wasn't hungry but i am now something caught your attention it caught that oh god let me have such an anointing in my life that i'll be walking at walmart and and some i walk right by somebody and it could be that one and just the presence that is you lord the humility as i walk by they might not have known what they were fixing to come in contact with i said lord let me have that spirit upon me amen because i want more of him think about the tree that is alive what does it do it takes in the water right the plants that are alive take in the water you know you don't have to tell it to do it you ever planted a a a tree or a flower how many has ever done that planted something all right so we're about 50 50 here and trust me i'm not a green thumb either or whatever you call it oh i planted it there it is grow grow drink water do you ever do that no why because you know that there's a nature in there that if you plant it and if it's alive without being told it just begins to drink it up baby that is born when it first comes out and it's been whooped and whatever you don't have to force it it cries and what does it do it begins to cry for food right it's in the nature you don't have to be told you don't have to teach a baby to desire food it comes from the womb with life desiring to eat that plant with life that already desires to draw it up why are we trying to force people to drink in church listen it ain't going to happen i've done come to that position that i'm not going to do it i'm just going to let the lord let the rain fall in the church and if you're alive you'll drink it and if you're dead i'll pray that god revive you why fret let god do it why as the heart planted panteth after the water broke soul panteth my soul after thee oh god my soul thirsteth for god hey listen when you are when you come into this life every human in this in this world has one spot that can only be filled by god and they try to fill it with drugs they try to fill it with alcohol they try to fill it with pornography they try to fill it with religion you know we we kind of deal with a lot of those things out there but a lot of times we need to come back to our position and realize that we can't even fill it with religion hello folks we gotta we gotta understand we gotta come back to that position we can only fill it with the baptism of the holy spirit and say god i need more of you my soul thirsteth for god it's no longer thirsting for the world it's not thirsting for religion it's thirsting for god and guess what brother mcgarry didn't have to make me do it hallelujah when god began to deal with you the pastor didn't make you drink it something just started soaking it up hallelujah you could have been it could have been on a bar stool but as soon as something struck your heart you begin to soak it up and it brought you right to the word of god and it began to transform your life and change your life and guess what you're still soaking it up hallelujah man i gotta hurry my goodness is good preaching even on a wednesday night i'm hurrying i already told him i said i'm a worker i understand i'm on vacation i'm gonna try to treat this like i'm going to work just like you tomorrow okay we need to desire the sustainable word of this hour and not the religious junk food or worldly cravings everything outside of this word is nothing more than cotton candy i mean he's never had cotton candy before boy it's all out there and it's all poofy and everything looks good and as soon as you put your mouth it's like i paid 10 bucks for that and it gave you no sustenance there was no protein in it probably you're walking out with your eyes crossed because you had so much sugar and it did no good for you oh it might have tasted good the bible says enjoying sin for a season everything outside of this word is nothing more than just cotton candy what looks good and it might taste good for a moment but it has no substance in it i said god give me that protein of the word tonight let me sing my teeth in it the bride craves more than a pleasure for a season but sustainable power to be in right standing with god may mean you are not with man and jesus lays this challenge from humility to an ardent crave for right standing with god but we also must watch that self-righteous spirit lord i don't want to become self-righteous the pharisees were devoted to the quest for righteousness but they ended up in a distorted pursuit of self-righteousness it can be easy to dismiss the pursuit of righteousness as easy always ending up in an inflated self-righteous spirit brother branham says now watch righteousness we're coming to a close now we have self-righteousness we have make-believe righteousness we have perverted righteousness all kinds but there's one real righteousness and that righteousness comes from god and this man was the king of righteousness who could he be now he was the king of righteousness the king of jerusalem the king of righteousness the king of peace he uh so let let this sink in as we come down to the end of this he said he didn't say now this is not brother brandon i'm bringing this other portion out he didn't say blessed are those whose goal is righteousness for they shall attain their goal nor did he say blessed are those who have the desire for righteousness for they will get their hearts desire rather he spoke in everyday terms regarding intense hunger i must be hungry and thirsty for god have you ever heard the statement in the sports world they're hungry how many's ever heard that boy they're really hungry you take an athlete who is well paid right you know before they got that check if you would that big payday 180 million 250 million whatever it is now probably in the billions as far as i know boy they worked hard they they gave everything they were hungry and then as soon as they got that paycheck as soon as they got that contract 10 years and we're living it boy the next year let's just throw baseball in the next year their average went from 350 down to 210. same person but they finally got what they wanted and they lost their hunger i say let's not be that way in church see we're not here to just attain some revelations and then lose our hunger this is an everyday relationship an everyday pressing i press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling right so we don't want to have that attitude luke 12 19 and i will say to my soul soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thy ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him now full this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou has provided jesus was not saying blessed are those who are concerned in a pursuing way that they might perhaps grow in righteousness he pronounced blessing on ones who are hungry for it i know famous last words of a minister but i am coming to a close with this last part when to see what what happens when disease strikes a body what does it begin to do takes the hunger and the thirst i i don't know about you but if i when i when i remember especially when i was a kid and i had the flu the last thing i wanted to do was eat the last thing you know mom was like oh you need to have that chicken noodle soup i still don't get it but you need the last thing i wanted to do was eat the last thing i wanted to do is drink anything there was a disease there was something in my body and i did and i lost the hunger the disease of doubt and fear and question victimized by problems of life we build what is called the victim mentality it is a disease that causes us to lose any will to overcome and we become justified by our circumstances look at what i've been through you wouldn't understand there are many victims in a church and it's called a victim mentality disease and that what does it do when we when we let that disease come in our life or even the disease of doubt we begin to doubt what god has done we begin to lose our faith what is it is a disease that begins to work in our spiritual life and what do you know notice begins to happen you start losing your desire to read the scripture you lose that desire to pray the desire for the house of god becomes weak as you can say you don't backslide overnight it's a disease you stop eating here and you stop eating there why because there's a disease but guess what brother i know a healer tonight that heals all diseases you know the victim mentality is so strong in america today we don't want it to creep into our churches my god is a healer you know i don't care what's happened in your life i don't care what mama did what daddy did what grandpa did i don't care what america did i don't care what the world did i don't care what satan did god is a healer of everything i say lord heal us from our disease of doubt the healest of our disease of self bring our hunger back tonight bring our thirst back tonight ii chronicles 7 14 says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land this is this is the land that god has this is dirt this is earth i say god heal me tonight lord if i've lost faith lord i pray heal me tonight if there's been some doubt heal me lord if i've been playing the victim card heal me tonight lord if there's been spiritual uh disease i pray heal me tonight i don't want to just focus always on the natural lord bring me into a spiritual relationship with you tonight let me humble myself and come to that room i can be free from fear tonight i can be free from doubt but lord i need that presence amen let's bow our heads musicians come isn't the lord good if you if i if we can humble ourselves if we can recognize our need for god and our need for a relationship with him blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled i believe we need to be honest with god in our in our moment before we turn it over so our heads are bowed and we're just in in tune with god for these few moments maybe you're here tonight and you just want to be honest not with me i don't even want to see i just want us to give you the opportunity where you're sitting right now maybe you need to go right back to the very beginning lord i need to be poor in spirit lord i've i i feel maybe that some of that meekness is i haven't been even tempered or i haven't trusted in you lord like i need to trust in you lord there's been a disease i feel of doubt i've been i've been feeling a little spiritually sick and i haven't prayed like i need to pray or i haven't worshiped like i need to worship but this these things of life these circumstances these struggles these battles that i've been going through it's been causing me to uh to not worship like i need to but god i feel you as the great physician will if you'll just walk by my way right here tonight i just know you can touch me would you lift your hand and say lord walk by my way now oh great physician would you walk by lord you see the hands tonight that are lifted lord i lift my hands to you father and i say

need one touch of the master's hand this evening lord would you move amongst your people tonight lord we want to we want to go deeper in your word we want to climb higher in the realms sometimes we need to come back to this balance of understanding how much you can do for us if we'll just trust in you to be able to trust in you lord in the storm to be able to trust in you lord when it didn't go
