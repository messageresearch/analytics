greet one another with a smile and say god bless you so we just have him come for psalm reading i always look to my left and brother mike's not there i have to start looking to my right god bless you god bless you good morning you know it's um it's interesting as you look at the news you hear all the noise that's going on in the world it's you know first thing that pops into mind is all the division that's going on you know everybody dividing around certain things but you know what's interesting is we've been taught that that is we're actually living in a time of unifying a uniting time not a dividing time you know what's happening really is people are being unified into bundles and ultimately they're being unified against the word you know but there's another uniting going on which is what we're interested in here this morning so i've been thinking a lot about unity you know if you remember a few weeks ago we read psalm 86 where the scripture said that unite my heart to fear thy name what's interesting is that's also the opening scripture that brother branham uses when he preaches that sermon a uniting time and sign which is just a fabulous message i would encourage you all to listen to that or read that it couldn't be more appropriate to the day and the hour that we live in but you know i was looking thinking about unity and i was looking at psalm 133 which we'll go ahead and read this morning and it says in verse 1 it says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity you know and that word unity is only really used three times in the scriptures this is one of those three times it's you know he describes this as uh what's interesting is when david's describing unity he attaches that to the oil in verse two that runs down aaron's beard you know and and in in ephesians 4 paul uses the word unity several times he says in verse 3 endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace so once again describing unity as an attribute or a characteristic of the spirit of god and then down in verse 13 he speaks of a time when we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ so the few times in the scripture when that word unity is used it's not around unity of knowledge or unity of belief or unity of you know cause or unity of doctrine but it's around the unity of the spirit and unity of the faith and there is no unity outside of that amen you know it's real i always like to look at webster to see how he describes a word and it's always amazing to me that the definitions that are used there unity is described as three things first the quality or state of not being multiple or oneness a condition of harmony or accord and the quality of state of being made one unification so you could have unity and oneness unity and accord all of them are the same thing in the scripture but there's one time in acts chapter 2 where it says and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and it's at that time that unity that the spirit of the lord was present the two are connected one to another with true unity the spirit of the lord and unity paul says it this way again in ephesians 4 he says there is one body one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all unity our unity where everything comes together in him as paul says again in ephesians 1 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he may gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him if that isn't the definition of unity i don't know what is that's the only unity i could ever hope for not getting wrapped around a cause or wrapped around some other thing like knowledge or teaching but unity with him you know just a couple things that brother branham said in the uniting sign in time i just would like to go ahead and read then we'll go ahead and read psalm 133 together he says now you see where we're living the uniting time when we see these things being united oh why we fail to see these things you can look in here in the scripture and see where that he promised that what he would do now we see it coming to pass we see in the church what he promised to do we see it coming to pass we see the nations coming together we see the isms uniting together we see the churches uniting together it's uniting time it's the hour of uniting that's the spirit of the age we've got to unite everything you talk about has got to be organized even the government won't receive it it's like you could be reading out of the newspaper from today right but in the but one thing he does say and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom amen you see it i uniting not no more join the church not more of this but flee from everything and tied to jesus christ see it's the uniting time god uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise so it says in verse 1 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity let's read that together just a very short psalm three verses behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the dew of hermann and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life forevermore amen amen praise the lord amen you may be seated key of f as the brothers come to take up the tithes and offerings we just pray a blessing upon those once my heart and soul [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Applause]

board for those that want to sign up amen god bless you let's open our bibles amen man we're always happy to be gathered in his presence amen there's no place where we want to be than the word than the house of god amen amen let's open uh first in matthew chapter 24 a very familiar scripture reading we're going to read from verse 1. matthew 24 it says and jesus went on and departed from the temple and his disciple came to him for show him for to show him the building and the temp of the temple and jesus said unto them there's a lot of pages just flipping sorry i went too fast and jesus said unto them see not all these things verily i say unto you they shall not be left here or stoned upon another that shall not be thrown down and they sat upon the mount of olives and the disciple came unto him privately and saying tell us what shall these things be and what shall the sign of thy coming of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many and and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see see see see the eb not be trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet foundation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famine and pestilence on the and on and the earthquakes and diverse places and all these things are the beginning of sorrows it says then shall they deliver ye thee up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name's sake and then shall many of many be offended and shall betray one another and they shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and fall false and shall rise and shall deceive many and because the iniquity abound in the love of many shall wax cold by ye that shall by he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved amen let's also open in luke's chapter eight we're going to read verse 1 to 15. luke chapter 8. first one to 15. satan he came to pass afterwards that he went through he went throughout every city and village preaching and showing the glad tiding of the kingdom and 12 and 12 were with him and certain woman and a certain woman which has been healed of of evil spirit and infirmities mary called uh magdalene out of out of whom when seven devils and joanna the wife of khushar ohed steward and susana and many others which ministered unto him of their substance and it says and when much people were gathered together we came to we came to him out of every city he spake by a parable a soul went out to sow his seed and he sold some and and he says and some fell on the wayside and some fell on the some and andy was throwing down and and the flower of the air devoured it and some fell on up on the rock as as as the as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because of its life of the lack of moisture and some fell among the tones and the tones sprung up with it and choked it and others fell up on the ground and sprung up and bare fruits and a hundred fold and when he had said these things he cried he had he that has an ear let him hear his disciple asked him saying what it what might this parable be he said and he said unto unto it in giving them in in giving to know the mystery of the king and he said unto it unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but others it in the parable but not to others in the parable that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god those those by the way side are there that hear the word and come and come then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of the heart lest they should believe and be saved they they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word of god with joy and those have no roots which for a while believe in the time of temptation fall away that which fell upon the torns a day which when they hear when when they have heard go forth and choke and choke with the cares and reaches and pleasures of life and bring no fruits to perfection but but that one that on the on the good ground they which in a honest and good heart heard the word and keep it and it brings forth fruits with patience amen you may have your seats let's also turn to one more scripture reading in john chapter 12 we're going to read from verse 20 to 24. john chapter 12 verse 20 to 24. and it says and there and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to philip which was of said bethesda of galilee and the desire him saying we would see jesus philip cometh and tell andrew and andrew andrew and philip tell jesus and jesus answered and said unto them the hour has come that the son of man must be glorified it said verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it will bring forth much fruit just want to go back to that first parable we we we read in luke chapter 8 and no doubt you know i begin to even look and identify some of the conditions with our own condition and just to give you i want to speak this morning it's just a very simple thought my title is the same life the same life and and and this is uh speaking uh with reference to a harvest time or the time of reaping so the same life and with reference to a time of reaping so we could see and and we know that as we read the scripture as we look in the bible we see that god has established patterns in the nature to teach us gaza has established uh he established laws and things in the nature that we can learn of we we speaking of the harvesting of the planting we can say this morning that you cannot sow oranges and expect to rip lemons you cannot sow mango and expect to rip apples or you you know you cannot go and and sow peaches and expect to rip bananas uh that would be very confusing uh but god has established it in a way that whatever seed was so the expectation of the harvest is the seed that was sown coming into maturity and and and and the seed that went into the ground is what's manifested in the fruit and so as jesus said here very rarely i said to you it's like the corner with fallen the ground they abide alone and dies is abide alone but if it dies it will bring forth much fruit so we begin to establish to to try to find out that you know that if if if there's going to be a harvest then god is going to have a seed that was planted is going to reap what he planted that god is going to have a harvest there's going to be a harvest is going to come and plant and and rip of that which he planted and also we are told you know even as brother mike mentioned it this morning you know i just been uh reading and listening to the message of harvest time and things that there's also a gathering together a binding together of the tares there's a binding together of the terrors that's going to happen the scripture speaks you know the the the master came and planted the seed and he said that then at night when everybody went to sleep that the enemy came into the field and he saw tares and then the next day or when the the two begin to to come up it says that the the workers came and told the masters you know we know that you planted the seed but we went in the field and we noticing that there are terrors everywhere it said that we don't know who planted it they said and the master said the enemy must have done this and then they said well should we go out and and unplug all the tears and everything it says no don't do it yet this is not the time but there will come a time where this is possible in other words at the younger age when the seed is still young at that young play age where it's just still coming up it's still just like a blade and we're still in that particular stage it's a very tender plant and you shouldn't disturb it you should leave it alone but he said there's going to come a time after the seed is mature after the seed is coming to the knowledge of what it is after the seed has recognized its position and what it was planted for after the seed is manifested and put forth of his fruit and it could be seen and he said when you come at that time and you remove the tear the seed will be able to handle it and i want to say this if you just to launch out from here the the word of god we live in the end time and barbara says this is the harvest time you know perhaps there's a time where you know uh uh people believers had a hard time and you know they couldn't take out this and you know the the one who didn't know really what the word is and when they're still at the younger age and it's hard for them to separate it's hard for them they have battle with this and they have battle with that and and they fight and all all all their life all they seem to do is fighting to find an identity but there comes a time where the seed has to come to maturity when it comes to maturity when the word comes forth when the word is spoken to it it's able to let the terror to fall it's able to remove the tear off of it why because it's been strengthened by the word of god it's received something and it's grown into strength and he has the ability has come to a place where parabanum says that the church will come to such a place where they'll be able to discern the two spirits within the framework of the church where they'll be able to accept the holy spirit and to withstand the devil spirit and and that's where we are tonight that's where we are this morning we have to have come to a place and where the word says when where even when instruction goes forth and when we are corrected by the word the word inside of your heart has to have been mature to the place where you can stand that to a place where you can say i receive it if the word says don't do this i won't do that if the word said don't go here i won't go there why because i am a mature believer i have received the word i've been feeding on the word i've been receiving the word i've been staying on the word god is backing all the green out of me and i'm in such a place where what the father desire is what i desire [Applause] this is not the time for struggling or or trying to figure out do i really want to serve god or do i this is the end time my brother my sister this is the harvest time there is no more time this could end at any time we we not promise that there's going to be a tomorrow and then another day another day the scripture says today when you hear his voice harden out your heart this is the last calling this is the last time that this world and i want to just be specific the world as a cosmos this is the last time it will hear the gospel of jesus christ this is it this is after this there's not another age there's not another coming there's not another something coming you are the last manifestation on the planet of the word of god if god is intending to do anything he will do it by the people that are presently on the earth right now receiving his word so the word now the scripture says in isaiah 8 and 7 it says the day that i saw in the wind they shall reap the whirlwind and so we we this brings us to a place where we have to realize it says that it's it was god's law that everything will bring forth after its kind that it would bring the and the purpose is for the likeness to be manifested and and you know i could just drop back to what we spoke last time uh you know the the holy spirit the brooding on the seed was so that the image of the the one who was doing the brooding will come into full manifestation and and and it was nothing else the full maturity is when the one who's doing the brooding he's looking at his seed and he's seeing himself so and so we find out it has to come to that place the seed has to move and get to that place where it's manifesting the exact seed that went into the ground where you can look at the fruits and recognize what seed is planted so prophetic says that genesis is the seed chapter he he he specifically speaks about that every seed that was to be planted every seed that was to be manifested or be brought into harvest had to be planted in genesis it says every place you look at the book of genesis it speaks it says last evening we had been speaking about the two uh that last two evening about genesis the chapter he says where god planted his seed and satan planted his seed it said that that and the balls are growing together and it says and ever since it's soon it shouldn't be the harvest time whether harvest will be ripped whether whether harvest will be ripped but but we just have to to if we just have to be two or three weeks of good revival that was gonna come uh here to go into some of these things so now he's speaking here saying that those seed had to be planted and it's gonna come a time where the harvest will be manifested so i was looking at this so it's important now you begin to realize this book of genesis everything well in regards to predestination was spoken into here everything in regards to what the seed was capable or not capable of doing was spoken here every plant what it was going to bring its ability the lack of ability everything that he should or should not do was spoken in here so and then when god said let her be god was only calling for what the seed that he predestinated on to bring forth what he planned for it to bring in other words god couldn't look at the the mango seed and call it to bring apple that will be against his own word that would be against his own plan that will be against his own thinking when he said when he planted that seed and he qualifies that seed as an apple seed when the word went forth and said let her be such that qualification brought that fruit to bring forth everything that god intended for it to bring and and and it was that way so when he called forth and and the reason and the only thing that could respond to the call was the seed that god planted god was not calling for the devil's seed as the prophet said that the devil planted his seed yes he planted it but what god said let her be it was only calling for the seed that he planted and i tell you my brother my sister the rapture is not for those that god didn't plant on this earth the rapture is not for the world the rapture is for a selected group of people that god planted here in the evening time that when the word will go forth those will receive it and those will believe it and those will manifest it and those will be taken out of here god is not a god of confusion we we can't battle within ourselves oh i just want to make it you're going to make it because god spoke that you're going to make it [Applause] we we we don't battle the world in a sense where oh i if i can do this i'll become the seed no you are already the seed the the battle within your heart is for you to give of your own self is for you to die accept the grain of wheat goes into the ground and dies then he abides alone but when if he dies it will bring forth much fruit the only way to bring food is to die the only way to bring the harvest is for the plant to go down to die and then it will bring forth the fruit so then god knew we can say this then god knew the seed that he planted and he knew in which generation he was going to call the harvest so god knew what harvest will come in the first church age he knew what harvest he will have on the second church age he knew not necessarily the harvest but it will know you will know the state or the condition of the seed that he had planted in all those ages because we can look at this as the the bride tree we could say it started off when god planted it and it was moving forward so we find out that devil saw a seed and god so is he and the prophet speaks to us and he tells us that it was always the two spirits manifesting themselves since the beginning when abel was here kane was here when when esau was he was jacob was there eso was here when moses was there janice and chambers were here when jesus was here judas was here so it was always the two and and the prophet now speaks now it's not i want you to realize this he's not attributing this other seed as just the complete worldliness but is in fact calling them that they are within the framework of the church i want you not to see where it's leading the it's leading us he's not saying well this is the world they're much of unbeliever and everything no he's saying this is this two spirits are within the framework of the church and it qualifies it by saying one is an intellectual the other is by revelation or by the spirit of god so therefore brother and sister that's why we have to be careful i tell you this the nature of the seed is to always grow forth the seed never stops to grow the moment the seed stops life is gone out of it the the seed is always calling i was thinking about what what i'm talking about uh the reverend lily said yeah he is in the muck in the mud in the pond and in the very depths and covered by all kinds of stuffing and everything but he said within the bottom where he cannot even see the sun there is something within a seed that the sun is calling an invisible calling not something that you can see or apprehend with your eyes and also an invisible calling that's happening and as the sun is calling the the line is pushing the lid is pushing the lid is pushing the lid is pushing why because the sun is calling and it's coming into a full manifestation why because it's been called and if we are being called this morning there has to be a struggle within our lives within our hearts that wants to see god today that wants to see god tomorrow that's not satisfied with this it's not satisfied with this other condition why because something is calling and i have to respond to that call but i'm says this it says he speaks about being a topologist that says i'm a topologist and i like the types and the shadows because if i know what the shadow looks like then if i have some conception of and then he says then i have some conception of what the reality looks like it says so without an education i had to go to the shadows the old testament to see what to see it foreshadowed the new and everything in the old testament speaks to calvary everything you are completed in christ you are not saved because you are you've packed the crucifix you are not safe because you go to church you are not safe because you know your your your your catechism or your textbook you are not safe because you know the bible now i want you to see where it's taking this you are saved because you know the person jesus christ to know him is life not even to know his word is life but to know him the person is life there's only one way to know him and that's to be born again of the spirit of god and i want to say this the world out there is moving into the condition that it is because there is something within their heart that's calling for the things that they're manifesting and i want to say this most of them they can't even help it they're just being moved into a condition oh they don't like this they move into it they don't like this they move they don't know that they're being brought together into the fulfillment of the prophecy of the end time condition and i want to say this if they're moving like that with no knowledge of the scripture or for anything how much more we this morning we have to understand that when we see that condition out there that we by the word of god by the revelation that we have received we need to be moved into another condition we can't stay where we are we cannot just be satisfied with what we see we cannot this message was not sent for us to gather this morning and say that god sent a prophet god sent and he did miracle when the prophet was here and yet we are we have within our midst people that need healing that need to be saved and all those things the reason why god sent the prophet was so we can recognize who he was but in recognizing him that the same god will move this morning and fulfill the word for the things that he has promised for this hour god didn't allocate his word or his power and say that i will extend my power but it will only stop at william branham the the scripture tells us that the power was given to the church to them that believe he has given them power to become sons and daughters and last week we read how he says that everything that was in christ everything that god took that and he poured into christ for what to continue his work the life is known by its manifestation a life can only be told by what it looks like a life can be told only when we see its action that's when we know what kind of life it is he speaks and he says he says he says that's been born again with the spirit of god and so and then he tells us again that we live in one of the most intellectual age where you you look at the church condition and what they fail is because everything was taken and received with intellect the the that wanted god to move only according to their understanding they wanted to see things only operates within the understanding of the mind in other words by setting up those things they stopped the move of god but when i'm saying they set up camp and the spirit to move away from them and yet they remain on the camp that's why we have the methodist camp the baptist camp and all this camp and we want to be careful that as an individual we don't set up camps we want to make sure that as individual we move with the word of god the first church was moved by the word of god it was a bunch of people where god told them go here he picked up and he went why because the spirit spoke to him to do that and that god has never changed it's the same today he moved upon the prophet he told him where to go and where not to go and that same god can do the same thing this morning and today if we will yield to him we can't hide behind the word and say well i believe the word i believe the word with no spirit moving at all the spirit is sent to move upon the word and take the word and make it life we say we believe the word but yet the actions are not matching what the word says we say we believe the word but yet what we bring what we come into is not what the world is calling us to so we find out that that it it it's such a an intellectual age you look at men's invention but but randy spoke the other day about you know how they they're coming from the airplanes and and the horse and buggy and how they move forward to the airplanes all the way up to the arsenal you look at science cars that drive themselves you can just sit in there and enjoy you can get any kind of bed you wanted that will memorize how you want to sleep and just set everything up and touch you exactly where you want to be touched and everything and set up the right temperature for you we have all kinds of things but yet within our condition we have this is the most confusing time that's ever been on the planet we have all kinds of doctors all kinds of things but yet this is the sickest time that we've ever seen all kinds of diseases that men have no idea so how can they progress so much on one hand and then go so down on the other why it's meeting the condition of what's promised at this time and so therefore when that's happening there has to be a people coming into a life i'm not talking about a preaching role an understanding of a set of mind no i'm talking about a life because we're not interested in just preaching i can preach here we can enjoy and all of that that's wonderful and the devil will not do anything but if somebody can stand up this morning and move into that word and take it and manifest it that's what causes trouble the devil is not moved by our intellect or ability to quote quotes and scriptures the what the devil is afraid of is men and women that can manifest the christ of this hour that can manifest the word of god promised for this time and that's the kind of people we want to be so and then we read this last time it says this so the same life will produce the same fruit and we wear this last time so if the life if the life that's in us is the life of christ it will produce christ now and this just came to me and and i hope you know i can bring it out that's the way i see it now i i don't believe this is a condemnation this is a promise this is not condemnation this is a promise and why this is a promise i'm speaking about harvest time during the harvest before the harvest can come there's just a little seed there but if adam says the stage is as it speaks about the stages of the seed there's a time where all the seed is just a blade and if you can come to the blade and say oh this is a tomato tree a person will look at you and say you're crazy it doesn't look anything like it it moves into from the sea but from the blade it will move into a tassel what lacking the very identification of what a tomato tree looks like or what an apple tree looks like anyway but yet it's the seed yet it's the seed so therefore we don't judge one another just because you see somebody the way they dress and everything then you attribute them yes they are christian they know no no no no no what you want to know is is there something in there is there a desire inside there that's looking for the manifestation of what's been placed inside because it can go through all kinds of stuff that's why when we look at and i'll say this oftentimes the devil takes the sons of god and he dresses them in all kinds of worldliness one that if you're not careful you'll look in the world and say there's no way god can save that oftentimes we miss the program of god because we let our mind go first i tell you god will take the most fanatic worldly person and those are the ones most of the time that go to god why because there's something that the devil is trying to hide behind there what we're interested in is something within the heart of a person that wants to move to justification that wants to go through sanctification that wants to move into the baptism of the holy spirit that want to have the love of god shed within the heart that's the progression that we are going into we're now going backwards and the scripture says that these signs shall follow them that believe so it begins with the belief i believe with all my heart i heard that word something touched within my heart you may have absolutely no criteria no display of any spirituality but within your heart god is starting a work so that's why it's so important that we recognize that i was i was thinking about just this life the life because i believe it's every christian's desire to see that life come to manifest it and why the life you know lately with all this covert 19 stuff going on you know i i was reading just got interested in what they call uh plasma therapy and we know that you know as even from the scripture i just don't think i have time probably we to read all of them but brahmana tells us that the life is in the blood the life is in the blood life is in the blood so so i just began to look so basically what they call the plasma therapy the plasma therapy is used for people what they do is they've take the life or the blood of the people who have recovered from certain illnesses and they take that blood from that blood they're able to inject it to a sick person and this and those things contaminate the person who's sick and he received this antibodies that came from this other person and he's able to fight the disease i thought about the blood of jesus this morning i thought about the blood that's been made available to the church i tell you we are not overcomers because we overcame we are overcame because the blood the life that we have received there's a blood that came by the word of god there's something that's a power that came by the word of god there's something we have received a plasma from the father that came into your sick body that came into your sin body and when you receive it it brought deliverance to you and i tell you this morning if the blood brought you deliverance if the blood brought you salvation hang on to it it's going to continue that's not the end of it the sun is coming it's going to keep going it's going to keep going it's going to keep going until it manifests at the very rapture that he's looking for the treatment we have received that's what the prophet told us we didn't get and get some antibiotics shot or some malaria tablets or something we have received the plasma of god the blood of jesus christ to wash us for a moment uncleanness to make us whole he says the blood is the bleach why what does the bleach do but i'm going to explain it says you take something you take off you take a a blue color or something it's a composition of molecule he goes down into just chemistry again well you know perhaps it's c2 and 4 5 and this and this but he said when you drop it in there it tears all of that apart and brings it back to its original and it disappears so it's the composition that makes the color it breaks away the composition so this blood when you dip your sin into it it takes whatever composition of that sin is when it's dropped in this blood it breaks away the composition it's the most powerful thing that there is on the earth oh i tell you if the world could use of this remedy it will not be in the shape that it is today so he speaks in the message to talk and he says but prove i i'll just just try to summarize so i can move forward he says but but he says but prove that the man is in the image of his creator therefore that man that man when an animal died and the blood was broken the cell was was was broken it says the life the life the life is in the blood cell when when the blood cell was broken the blood broke up it says the worshiper had to take the chemistry of the blood and put it upon the door so it could it could be seen with a literal eyes because the life was in the animal was in the because the life that was in the animal could not come back upon the man not having a soul therefore it's it would only mix it would only it wouldn't mix with the soul of a man an animal life won't come back upon the human being it continues on he says now our sacrifice today not only an ordinary human being but it was god himself that was identified in flesh here upon the earth when the blood cell broke not only did the soul of man did the soul of men or the spirit of man but god himself who was identified in the man returned back upon the believer that's the promise we have so if you're not manifesting not yet you keep pressing in that direction you keep looking in that direction time is no more we don't have time we don't have time to play churches we don't have time to just come and gather we don't know what's happening the world don't know what's happening next so so it says the blood he returned back upon the believer in the baptism of the holy spirit that's the talking that god requires today the token of today that we have to have must be the holy spirit that's required the talking with we've approved it says we'll prove it to you by the scripture without the holy ghost you do not display the token without the holy spirit you can't have the token all you're gonna have is intellect and self-will and for anybody here that's been living on earth for more than 40 years you realize that self-will will run out when you're young you still feel strong you feel like you can do it you can do it but there comes a point where you need help when you begin to realize that i cannot do it on my own i need somebody to help me i cannot understand this i need somebody to help me praise god there's somebody here this morning to help you praise god there is a spirit here willing and looking for those for those who are waiting for his appearing for those who are wanting to press into this kingdom god is making it available this morning so it says the the scripture without the spirit you do not display therefore it shows um it shows that that that you you have the and then you you identify yourself with the sacrifice god has sent you back to the they send you back the token to show that you've accepted it until that's done no matter how good you are know how much you know or how um how a college prophet or a good person teacher whatever it might be you are absolutely not recognized until the token shows until the talking so now if i could just bring it back uh to what we want to say this morning when when when we speak of a life when we say a life i i just got this definition i thought it would probably help me just summarize what i'm trying to say so a life is the sum of a sum of distinguishing phenomena or organism especially it speaks about metabolism or growth or reproduction or adapt adaptation of environment of environment so a life you know it's something that expresses uh it's a combination of things that expresses something a a life of something life is just not breathing it's just not breathing and eating it's a combination of things uh a life of something shows it's known by its characteristics so the life is a combination of things and and and as he says here it's distinguished uh uh a a life of one is different from another we're living but we are known by differently the life of human is not the same after life and animal they're both alive but it's different lives as the prophet said you couldn't take an animal and put it upon the man so it was different so barbara says this this morning it says in the message unconditional covenant he says listen you are the covenant people of god god tore christ apart at calvary making the covenant swearing by himself he took the body upon up into heaven which will return someday but the spirit he gave it back to lead the church the same life that was in christ jesus in the church tonight by the holy spirit doing and acting and performing the same thing that he did when he was here on earth you are receiving it he says you've got the covenant it's written to you so by god you can fail to make the devil mad sure sure that he says you can't fail that makes the devil mad shoot us when you realize who you are so yeah yes the prophet is setting it up in a way to to make sure that we understand that this covenant and this life has been given to the church it's made mad available for the church it's been given to you god swore by himself he'd done all that he could and this morning what he wants us to do is to receive it it's to believe it it's to seek for it it's to want to see the manifestations of it or just skip some here it says but it says now if you are if you are if you are believing right if you just confess it from your lips don't die don't do much it won't do much good but from your heart if you believe that jesus christ is the son of god you can't live the same life you once but you once lived if you believe with all your heart that jesus jesus christ is god he's saying that there's absolutely no way you can live the same life you lived before you can't you have he says if you have ever get the true view of calvary now if you are just taking the the half-hazard way you just you're just filling yourself but when you re when you really get to view of what jesus was oh my i like to preach on the deity the supreme deity of jesus christ if you could ever realize how he was what he did for you for for you men and women your heart will rent within you it says you will be willing to throw everything to throw away every trash in the world to live for him to live so that's why i'm saying this morning what the the the only time this becomes a condemnation is when we have the wrong view about what this is all about the only time this becomes a condemnation is if we're looking at it from the wrong side if we see what he had to go through what he laid down for our sake what it did for us everything that he laid down oh it causes something within your heart to live and say i can't believe somebody did all of this for me i have to embrace it i have to do everything to show my appreciation when the devil is just looking at you well you know all if all that's preached is well as long as you live out there you that way you're going to go to hell and all those things you're not calling out for anything are you doing it just throwing stones what you need is a gospel that will call that kid and tell him the life you live in is not the life that's within you you've been called to live better than what you're doing right now that is within you something that wants to serve god that's within you a seed that's calling for the reality of god the only thing you're doing right now is satisfying it with the trash of the world and one day you're gonna wake up and come face to face to him and you will not be the same anymore oh i tell you when that kid meets him one day oh i tell you all the things all the words you've been speaking will come into plain view you will realize what has been missing all along [Music] it's the same life it's not a different life it's not a condemnation life well but random says i used to think god was mad at me god is not mad at you the devil wants to present it as there's some great enmity between you and god no the only enmity exists is between his seed and god's seed so now just want to go on now so we said it's the same life but when i'm as we read the scripture here just want to come to a place here we read in john chapter 12 and specifically verse 24 it says verily verily i say unto you except a corner with a kind of wheat uh falls into the ground and dies he abides alone but if it dies it will bring forth much fruit now just wanna lay down something here now we know that jesus was the fulfillment of all the old testament prophecy so he came what the prophet had spoken to him he was the seed that was spoken of in genesis we understand the scripture says that the seed of the woman will burst the serpent head it was that seed the prophet isaiah cried out the virgin shall conceive he was that seed and as we spoke about those two spirits being together the the seed of the enemy always looked to kill or to persecute the seed of god right from the beginning it came into able to try to kill him to stop the seed that didn't stop right there he killed it god raised up another one it came and then he did it again god raised up another one so since the beginning this seed was was even as he says about isaac he says that the promised son was really not isaac but it was christ because he was speaking concerning the world seed of abraham so now we take all of that we come back into the new testament now jesus christ is born so he's the word that that has been promised now he's come to a place where he has to go into the ground so now he speaks he says here he is now i want you just to dramatize a little bit here he has his ear he's the promised seed all the power is within him everything that all the world needed is within him all of that is within him now he's realizing that i have to go into the ground and rise again otherwise i abide by myself otherwise it's just going to be me in order for me to reproduce myself i have to go into the ground is by presenting the law of reproduction that this has to go into the ground in order to come back up so now he's here showing what he's about to do so he comes and he realized that here i am this is the very man who was promised from the beginning so he comes and he reads a scripture in uh uh john 12 it speaks to job 20 24 how he must die so the seed goes and now he dies at the cross and the seed is planted and all i tell you the devil thought he got him he thought because the scripture speaks about how all the righteous men came off since abraham they came in when they died he took the sting of death and he stung them and he kept them down and jacob came same thing all of them david came and all of them as they were coming it was just holding them and holding them and holding them and so now the answer to all the prophets prophecy was here on the scene and now here he is the thinking is just like any other man but he knows exactly what he's doing in fact as he's speaking this word they have no idea what he's talking about so he comes and now is crucified and he goes into the ground and after three days oh it was the harvest time it was a time for those seed that went into the ground to be resurrected in other words his death made a way so that god could take of that spirit come back on the pentecost and distribute it to 120 that was sitting there waiting for him involvement for the promise of the father so now he comes and moved from one man into 120 in one day now but madame says this and i thought this was so wonderful i was fellowshipping with matthew just looking for this and and and he was able to find it for me so this is in the message the act of the holy spirit it says now they say having they say we was having a great time it says that report came back like the brother neville said a while ago i just kind of puffed up apostles and so forth they had some things uh something to do about it right on and when it went again and it was hard and preaching the gospel and peter and john ignore and unlearn and passed up to the get called beautiful now listen to this it says my the devil said well now they're going just out and they're going just out there preaching so it won't hurt anything it says then all these people believe in preaching everything so if it's just believing and preaching this morning the devil is okay that didn't work him up from bad he just lay down and he said i got it but listen to this but when they passed to the gate called beautiful they laid they lay them in the holy ghost said peter that man came that man can be healed he's got faith when he perceived he had faith to be healed he says stand up on your feet now i want you to realize this peter and john perceived that that man had something within him that could be healed something that could be changed he has a seed within him that could be called out something for him to receive what we have to offer so he says when he perceived that he did listen to this and and he's and when they they spoke to him he says stand up on your feet and he picked him up listen to this he picked him up and held him till his ankle bone received strength and i want to tell you this morning this is what we don't do most of the time we hear the word we go back to sleep we hear the word we go back to sleep i want to say like our pastor said we need to go out there and hold somebody's feet hold his hand let the world come to manifestation they knew that that person believed and if you believe for your child or for whatever you have there has to be some action to show that i believe this you can't just say i believe i'll just go to sleep no you keep calling on them you keep talking to them you keep bothering them you keep telling them until they had enough of you until they have enough of you they either get in or get out until they have they just can't stand it anymore and just say i'll just come anyway what we do is we let go too fast we don't hold we don't stand up and wait for the light to strengthen the scripture didn't say that when he spoke the man began to work no in fact as he stood up he was wobbling him they helped him up and they just hold him they just hold him until his legs got straight to stand on his own we need to do is to take the week in our meeting just hold them up you keep believing you keep believing just keep holding them just keep preaching to them just keep preaching to them one day they're going to walk on their own we have such a cut and dry attitude it is or it's not oh that's that can be god that oh that's how no that's not what we are called to do we are going to preach the word and preach it out and preach it out until the ankles gain strength and i want to say this this was not the end of it so as the god he got strengthened his uncle ankles and received strength and away he says he went limping and jumping and praising god he says you know what that caused more trouble than all the preaching that ever been done we need something that can cause more trouble than just the preaching we need something that's going to cause the devil to lose his mind we need something that can cause the trouble in the kingdom of the devil and what is that that's when a life comes to the manifestation so now it was just not one it became 120. they came the same in fact the scripture says they were ignorant and unlearned now this man was not a hidden person it was somebody the priest knew about the past i knew about this was not some hidden something you know i tell you well you know my son today was sick and and god healed him you know somebody people can have all kinds of doubt well you know i i don't know much and you know and you can let intellect can play into it and everything and all that but this was a public display of power of god doing it and it caused confusion and so many began to flock why because they knew that man he stood there every day asking for for begging for for little might and everything and when that happened it caused all kinds of chaos they went and grabbed them and asked him by that pride what power have you done this oh i tell you it's time for testimonies let's do this says the same jesus the same one that you took that you planted into the ground god has raised him up that life is no longer just one life it's manifested into 120. amen and i want to say this that's not the end of it because remember jesus did not appear by himself to the people saying look at me i'm raised no the proof of his resurrection was his life living within the disciples doing the same wonders and signs that he did in the beginning doing the same in fact they looked at the same characteristics of life they just looked at it the first thing that came out of mind that was like this must be christians this must be the followers of the man that we crucified why because their life was testifying of what they received oh my brother my sister in this end time we have received something but one of them says that this is the harvest time it talks about the seed he says now when the the church died if you were going the church ages it says into the dark ages the church was crucified the word the scripture says it was the christ himself was rejected so they took him in the dark ages and killed christian and all of that and that part of adam says that but in the harvest time that life is coming back and the same quickening power that came down on the day of pentecost that same quickening power has come at the opening of the world in this time we have received the same quickening power to do what to vindicate the same life that the disciples had now this is not so we can come here and manifest pentecost and the gifts and everything no this is to manifest the promise that god said that i will restore like adam as it was in the beginning so yeah we all we go past way pentecost all the way into what was in the mind of god in the beginning where a man is able to stand by that quickening power and bring things into existence we have seen that quickening power and that's the life i want to just say this this morning that's what we are called to move into it's been given to us it's our inheritance don't let anything stop you short of that revival is to keep the life to continue to keep that life the moment you stop and you get satisfied that life will leave you you become a camp but the life of god is moving and we want to move with it if the musician could come this morning when i asked you tonight this morning what is the harvest time what is the harvest time i just began to see so many connections and for the sake of time i'll just mention some of them in excuse me the harvest time is when the seed that was so come into the full manifestation of what was sown it's the time where the word is here to bring the seed to maturity it's the time where the seed is now able to stand the correction when when the the tears comes and it has to be pulled out of you the seed is mature enough to stand there and say let it be according to thy word why because the seed is fully matured all that it desires is to see what was planted in it it seemed the manifestation and it's no longer interested in the terror that's close by it wants the terror picked up it's when the spirit is bringing the same life that was in christ into the believer it's when the word is bringing forth the manifestation of true sons and daughters of god in the end time it becomes everything you look at everything that brahmana see preach you begin to realize he was preaching about harvest time there's a man here to turn on the light he that is in you is greater who is this mighty god unveiled before us christ in the mystery of god reveal it's the harvest time it was the time for it he's been he's telling you listen there was something that was planted now it's the fruit time the master is interested in the fruits and is not interested in the fruit that we can produce by our old self remember the the branch has to be plugged into the vine so the same life that's in the vine can go into the branch the branch is not given to produce its own life no it's the life that comes from the vine that produces the fruits so it's the word here to bake all the greens the unbelieve in the seeds because it's time for harvest it's the same life in the vine the same life that's been manifested in the branches and the word is here to bring forth fruits unto perfection how can we attain to that perfection by the life by the life if you could stand this morning i want to say this harvest time is adoption time [Music] it's an adoption time it means that the seed has to have been grown and gotten to a place where you know i was thinking about christ the seed that went into the ground before pentecost it had to be brought in such a place where it even confessed by its own mouth it says father let it not be my will but your will where it had to die to itself so that the this this this seed can come into the full maturity was mentioned even it says hear him but here he comes and he's about to die he says let it not be my will but your will why because in that was the father's desire manifested and we come into maturity where when we lose our own desires when it's not just about what we want what we want to see oh you know if this is not the way i want it then it's not right and no i just want the will of the father i just want to know what he wants me to do i just want to be at the place where he's called me to be when you get to that place then you're coming into because the father desires to see the fruits so he can take it and use it for his table let's just bow our heads this morning our gracious father we're so thankful this morning father lord for the life they've made available [Music] lord i can raise my hand this morning i said i desire of thy life more than anything lord i prayed this morning that you just pour it upon us lord so we may grow stay in this presence of the sun and have all the greens taken out of us we can come into the maturity that you're looking for in the perfect image lord help us father let us not be slack but let us press forward lord and continuing to eat the word to drink and to stay in the word and to let the spirit move upon us so we can bring the things that you desire lord lord we love you and ask those things knowing that you are faithful to give it to us if you place the desire within our heart if you made a way that we can have it lord we hear asking that you may give it father like the scripture says that it's the time for harvest it says but let that that you may go to the lord of harvest and pray that he may send workers into the field and your prophet said that he was the lord of harvest obviously he knew that he needed workers and why go ask him it says well that's your program even the things that we have need of that you already know you want us to come and ask so this morning we ask father that you pour your spirit out upon us father fill us with your word lead us and guide us on all truth and righteousness father let our heart burn for you more than anything lord father that if we we believe that the more we burn for you the more the desires of the world will follow us the only reason why we stole hunger for the world world is
