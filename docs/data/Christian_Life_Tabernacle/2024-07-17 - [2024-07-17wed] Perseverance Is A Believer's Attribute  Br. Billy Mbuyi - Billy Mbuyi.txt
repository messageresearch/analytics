welcome everyone all our visitors uh we certainly appreciate uh all of you for coming out to the house of God Amen who enjoy those specials let's just turn our Bibles uh uh for a scripture reading tonight uh I believe it's Mark chapter 7 amen let's start from verse 24 a very familiar scripture reading it it said in and from hence he rose and went into the borders of Tyra and of sidon and he said and then enter into a house and would have no man come uh no man know it but it could not be hid and then he said for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and he came and he fell at his feet the woman was a Greek of of sarapen by nation and uh and she besought him that he would cast The Devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children be uh let the children first be filled for it is not me to take the children's bread and cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's Crum man that's a tremendous statement right there and then he said and he said unto her for this saying go thy way and the devil and the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she came to her house she found the devil gone out out of her daughter laid upon and the daughter and her daughter laid upon the bed father we ask that you bless your word to us we commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats tonight man it's good to be Gather in the house of Goden we'll just try to uh speak for a few moments and uh um I want to give it for title uh just for our understanding and our framing of mind um perseverance is a believer's attribute perseverance is a believer's attribute in other words that's how you know one to be a believer is because they have a persevering um attribute in them um brother bham will preach this message many a times and and and he would use the definition and he will say the word perseverance it says it it means it's a steady and perseverance uh a steady perseverance in the course of action uh to never give up to in trying to make a goal or in trying to do something so one is trying to achieve a goal they have something in mind and perseverance is the steady persistence in the cause of action to getting that and if you ask Professor Google he will say it's to persisting and the steadfast without giving up so it's to persisting and steadfast without giving up it's continuing in spite of difficulties or setbacks persevering so just by the very definition we can see that that that one who's persevering there there's challenges that are going to come there's things that are going to stand in front there's there's setbacks that are going to come there's difficulties that are going to rise but they are going to continue in their steady and steadfast way in achieving a goal so as we look at it even the very quality of it when you read about perseverance it's not talking about one who's the smartest one who's the fastest and one who's got the skills and one who has just knows how to get things done no those are not the quality of one who's persevering in fact you will find it many of times it's the opposite you will find it's one who's steady it's one who's persistent who doesn't change and I talk about even the very you know we talk about uh uh uh uh in the life you will find you you you you will see it's those that go the fastest that don't get there it's those that try to go that have the most skills that don't get there it's those that are the smartest that don't get there but rather those that are patient and that it seems sometimes like they're not making any Improvement they're not making any ground and but yet they move moving slowly and surely those are th those are those that have the quality of perseverance so it's not necessarily uh uh one who has it all together one who never makes a mistakes and one who just knows how to put their words together one who knows just how to put one foot instead in front of the other and knows how to do no it's probably one who's stumbling at every turn and one who just doesn't seem to to to to look like he's even going to get out of the gate and and and but yet they're pers they're perseverant they they have a goal they want to achieve and nothing is going to turn them away from that so and you will see persevering is is not uh uh when you see it as we said by very definition of it it it shows that the opposition is going to be on your way uh that that if there was no opposition then there's no need to be perseverant I if everything will go smoothly if everything could just be place in the way that is supposed to go if everything will just flow and and and and it will go and without any effort into it there's no need to be perseverant in that situation but it rather shows that you're going to stumble you're going to fail you it may even seem like it's impossible at some place it may look like you may never get to the very goal that you're Desiring but it's the constant persevering that's going to get you there and and I say that because yeah we are uh we we live my brother will say perhaps I'll say it in a this manner to summarize so I don't read too much that we yet we are we we live in what we would call a microwave age where if something doesn't happen within a minute you don't want it anymore we we live in a time where people lack patience and we live in a Time perhaps we'll call this even with the advancement today we have the fastest phone and tomorrow we have one faster than the one we had yesterday and and it's just at the click of a button something has to happen and nobody has the the the patience or the enduring or or no no no people lack the quality of commitment to anything that will take longer and everybody wants it and they want it now and if I'll go to prayer and I pray and it doesn't happen within the first 30 seconds I give up if I if I went to prayer and and I went and I ask God I want healing and I want this I want the Holy Ghost if he doesn't give me within the first prayer that's it I'm done if it hasn't happen within a week I walk away and and I forget that I even ask about it and and so that's the very age that we live in where people they don't have within themselves the ability to remain in a certain place or to ask and stay there until it happens and and and you find out that that's the attitude of today and and and I want to say this this oldfashioned revival or this oldfashioned gospel is not made for people like that th this was made for people that will pray until it happens for people that will seek until they find it was made for people that will show up until God will do it was made for people that will believe until it happens in other word it's made for people that have perseverance within them to know that if God made a promise God will bring his promise to come to pass it was made for those people that will say if God doesn't do it I'll stay here until it does it but when I'm will speak of a man uh will call Body Robinson he said y he came in the corn field and he'll sit there and he said he stood there and he laid down and he put went down on his knees and he said that God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost you will find my bones here when you come back so that's a man that's determined to get something that's a man that would stand there and say I'm here until God does it I believe the promise until it happens I believe the promise until the very manifestation of it I see those are the ones that make the promise happen and we find out that that's the quality people lack today everybody wants something but they wanted it today and everybody wants something but they want it to happen in their timetable nobody is waiting for God to come and bring it to come to pass in their lives they lack the perseverance within the life to wait until the promise come to pass the Bible will say in Matthew 24 and verse 9 and it will say uh it will say then shall they deliver you up for an Affliction and it said to be afflicted and then he said and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then it says and then shall many be offended and it's talking about the very uh condition of the end time and this is I want to say this this was not made for the people outside this is made for the condition that will exist within the framework of the church and then many shall be offended and betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because of the because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall walk cold but he that shall endure un the end now it doesn't say him that is the fastest him that can run the fastest who him that's got it together but him that will do it just the best no but it's him that will stay until the end it's him that will believe until it happens it's a him that's why the Bible will say he said will I find faith when I come come back at the end time and the faith that he's talking about is not necessarily just the belief but people that are waiting for the promise to come to pass as he went and said that I'm going away but I'll come again I'm promising you that I shall come now he's asking a question when I come back will I find on Earth people that are still believing that promise people that are still waiting for the coming of the Lord people that are still believing that there's a God that exist and he can change the heart of people and he can heal diseases and he can make things happen is there still on Earth people that believe that the the god that people believe today is the god that can give you money and that can make you prosper and he can buy you houses and that's not the kind of God this Bible is talking about but the people that will not live by their own dependency but they will depend on God 100% for the bread they depend on God for the clothing they'll depend on God they'll know that God will provide no matter what that's the people is looking for the Devil is provided substitute for everything you got a job and it's going to pay for all that you need and you got the hospital when you seek and you got this and you got that there's no need for God but yeah he asking and he says when I come back will I find a people that will have the faith that was once delivered to the Saints the faith the faith that they will stand and believe that no matter what the circumstance is we worship a living God one who makes his word a reality to a Believer one who comes and he takes his word and he breaks it open to those that believe now let me say this that promise was not to the unbeliever I I made a statement last time I said the problem we run into is we see people fall away and we wonder what happened to them let me say this if there's any shout of doubt any portion of a doubt in your heart it will manifest somehow the word of God is unto the Believers those that will believe Until the End those that will stay with it until it happens it's not made for the unbeliever it's made for those that are sold out and they have nothing to go back to I came out of the world there's nothing in the world that attracts me I have nothing to go back to I believe this with all my heart and I'll stay here here until he makes it happen that's what the word was made for therefore they don't stay long enough to see that God manifest his word but a Believer will stay until God makes it happen in fact but what I'm said it's those that believe it they bring the kingdom of God down by their faith and they stand there and they keep calling until the kingdom comes to the manifestation those that will believe until the end so have we we we live in a time I said a micro of age and a time where people are looking for Christianity void of Trials a a a customade Christianity made specially just for you you don't have to suffer anything you don't have to give up anything in fact you have a dial where you can mix the worldliness with a little bit of Christianity and just have it to your taste and call it oh I'm a Christian that's not a Christian the scripture says if you are lukewarm it will spew you out of his mouth God is looking for people that are sold out to him people that are prisoner like we heard it last Sunday they are tied to this gospel and whatever he said they looking for the manifestation of it they're not interested in what the devil has to offer what the world has to offer they want the word of God and nothing else they live by the word and nothing else if the word said go to church they go to church if the word says you be there they'll be there if the word tells them you are here it doesn't matter how much symtom the devil will pour it doesn't matter how much how much contradiction will come to pass they believe in they stay steadfast until it happens void of Trials void of suffering in fact bam says if somebody ever sold you something like that don't take it don't believe it they think we're going to go on the bed of ease and and just uh float in the cloud and you know every time you need something you just press your microwave five minute later it's dished out to you oh you needed healing yeah it is oh you needed Deliverance yeah it is all you needed this year it is you don't have to sweat it out at all but abam says Abraham sweated it out yes sir he stood there in a dusty place when God told him the whole land believe belonged to you y was standing at the dusty place and lock over there in a place in Sodom and gomorah at the place where water was but he stood there and and he Keep On Believing until God made the promise to come to Pastor him yes they want a better of feas and Christianity that could be mixed and Christianity that you can live just how you want you know if you feel like you're too much of a Christian you could just dial it down a little bit man I'm becoming too much of a Christian I just need a little bit of and if you feel like worldliness is crippling and you dial it up a little bit then at the measure that you like isn't that what they sell us custom stuff just tell us what you want we'll build it according to your specification the scripture says the kingdom of God doesn't come by observation but it's Violent Men that step into it men that would say I don't see it but I believe it I don't see it but I believe it they will call it and it will come unto manifestation they will stay there and pull it down and God will make it happen to them that's right people don't see it because it's not made to be seen just like that it's made for us to go down on our knees to pray him to ask him to knock until the door opens to seek until we find to go and to ask him and to be changed let me say this the experience that comes with that you will never forget it but this mix up religion God will do something you won't even know he did it why because it's mixed up with so many other things but men of all that have gone to their knees and they've prayed and have asked and they've knocked and God has done something their attitude has completely changed and they never forget [Music] it why does the Bible says is the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob those are testimonies that can never be forgotten that can be told from generation to generation about a living God who came on the scene about a God who can never forget and anytime he came to their children he reminded them I'm the god of Abraham what does that mean to you when I say that if you ask one who's from Israel one of us of of that lineage whether spiritual or natural they'll tell you with my father Abraham he waited 25 years and God brought a son to him God God brought his promise to pass after 25 years and let me say this when you are really born again Christian you become a prisoner you have perseverance within your heart you're not satisfied with just seeing things go the way they go when you find one that's un bondage when you find something that's not right that perseverance begin to work in you you stand there and you begin to fight and you begin to ask and why it's given in your power to change the circumstance why it's given to you to ask and to change the circumstance it's given to you to ask until it happens it's given to you to knock until it opens but what I will say it say in this message I don't know I have a quote from both of from from multiple ones so I probably just need you to find it as I read it says now all Christian all Christians must be persistent so that there there's no excuse for us to be gathered here and one to say oh I'm not really it says all Christians must be persistent they must be perseverant and the only way you are able to do this is to First have faith in what you are trying to do yes now remember the scripture says this Faith cometh by hearing by hearing the word of God and without faith it's impossible to please God so when you have faith you are pleasing to God in achieving the goal so it says faith is what if if you have faith in what you are trying to achieve and if you have no faith you just jumping at it it says you cannot be persevering but when you really know that it's the truth I love this when you not when you oh I think it's the truth and I believe God sent a messenger but I don't know if the word is really real I don't I really don't know I'm not no when you really know from the bottom of your heart when it's been reveal to you when it's personal when you know that I'll take this no matter what happened when when you know I'll stay with the word no matter what happened when you know that this message that we have received it's not an idea from men but it's God himself speaking to you then you become persevering when you really know that it's the truth then there's nothing that's going to stop you you are really persevering then men of all age that's a been able to do anything and had faith in what they were trying to do were persevering so I want to do this just for a moment now I want you to notice there's two things that is's bringing together here so this man of old number one there was something that what they were trying to achieve in other words there's first the goal that they're trying to get to and there's faith in believing in that goal so first of all even as we come here because why is that important because when you have faith when you receive the word you have to have faith in it otherwise it's possible to achieve it so if God said that you are a son of God you have to have faith in that to begin with if God said you are healed you have to have faith in that to begin with so if you hear the word and there's no faith to believe that you can't achieve the goal so the first is to know what's the goal the goal is God made me to be a son and a daughter the goal is God made me to serve him the goal is God made me to represent him and then I have faith in that those two things will bring you to be persevering so they saw something something they were trying to achieve they had to know that it's the truth and they have faith in what they were trying to achieve in another one bam says uh this one preaching 0305 64305 he says men of all of all ages he says that has faith in what they were trying to achieve has been perseverant no man can be perseverant unless first he knows what he's trying to achieve so the achievement is always important and the first you must know what you're trying to achieve then have faith in what you're trying to get to what you are trying to get to uh you are trying to what you are trying for and that makes you perseverant something that you know is real faith is it says and it says faith is based that way faith is not based upon some myth upon something like something that well I'll just say go and do this or do that he says only the word of of some only on the word of some men but Faith takes its Eternal resting place upon the word of the Lord upon God's word which is the Bible so when we say that and I want to say this true faith can only come by the word of God true faith that makes you perseverant is not based upon your idea of the word of God but it's based upon what God has promised when you can see what God has promised in the word when you can see what the promise is for you and you have faith in that that that's what will make you perseverant let me say this true faith is what will cause you to become persevering why because true faith is a revelation if it's that's why but the prophet said we one thing that we have to pray the most about is the revelation we we and I and I feel like sometimes we are so much educated in this message that we pretty much know most of what banam says every time we hear it we know oh I yeah I know butam said that I know but the the knowledge alone will only take you so far not that knowledge is bad but what we are looking for in our daily life is for that knowledge to be quick and be move from just head knowledge to Revelation what we are looking for is for The God Who who spoke the word and who brought the word to who open our eyes let me say this we didn't open our own eyes he did that so we take thank him for that so that's why we move from Revelation unto Revelation so if he made us to recognize that this message is his message if he made us to come to the place where we have gathered here none of us made ourselves a Christian he gathers us here he brought the faith within our heart so what we need is abundant Revelation is more Revelation so he can Quicken the remaining part of the word into our lives so we can be persevering because if you don't see him in this message if you don't see him like a a Pastor said I thought it was you can examine the whole world of God and Bam says this I believe I I I don't remember what message it was I thought it was perfect Faith but I I don't remember he says what you have to do as a Believer is to put the sum of everything that you have heard you examine everything that you have heard you examine everything that you have seen and ask yourself one question is this God or it's not God you see if you're not sure it's not going to help you you you're never going to move you it's going to stop you it's going to hinder you somewhere along the way what you do is you examine everything that you heard you examine everything that you have seen you have to answer the question is it God or it's not God why because if it's God then he will bring perseverance unto your heart yes amen so yeah we are as we looked and he would speak about the underlying when you look at all of these people that were persevering you find that there's an underlying characteristics about them and I and I just want to say this because I I I I I don't I don't want us to get an idea that this is something that that is achieved by your strength that is achieved by you walking up and saying I'm going to believe the message and I'll be the best Christian there is you're going to fall flat amen I I don't want us to look at it and say oh it's going to be my my natural endurance and I'm going to give it my all and I'll try to outrun everybody you're going to fall flat I'm going to try to outdo everybody so they know I'm the best Christian you you your beginning is wrong your motive and objectives are wrong so therefore you're never going to get anywhere but but yet at the same time the prophet is saying that this man when you look at them there was never a quitting ATT attribute in them there was never a letting off attribute from them and it at the same time it wasn't so much that they were running in it fast and and and and and making themselves known and so everybody will know perhaps it was the most humble some of them you wouldn't even know because often time when we think about perseverance our our natural mind thinks about someone's ability or what a person can do or how they move about and what you see them no some of the most persevering people are probably some of the the the the the slowest people there is some of the most perseverance are some of the one that you wouldn't even notice but they're there day in and day out and and and those that come and you show off and they seem to have more fire than the others just give them a little bit of time and then to disappear so it it's not the natural ability of someone to try things out and and try to show off that they have the most Faith than everybody else but it's one who stays with it one perhaps who's a making just a little step and and and you wouldn't even notice that there's any difference but yet they are there making the biggest difference but when I'm talks about George Washington it says and I love this he says and then and then it says and now man uh and then it says and now man who has had faith in God has been perseverant and in what they were trying to do and to take man of the the the of all the walks of life he says for instance this is preaching 0305 he says paragraph 15 he says for instance George Washington he says here at the Valley Forge he says after praying all night in the snow up on the he and and in the snow and it it says and and and in the snow and up on his hips it says and and and was wet way around his waist and the river was full of ice but he caught a vision from God oh I love this if we could catch it says he caught faith that God was going to give him the victory he said he couldn't have he says he could have too much ice he couldn't have too much ice in it though over two-thirds of his army didn't have the shoes on the the on the on the feet they says their feet was wrapped in rag standing in the cold but yet he felt in his heart that God had given him the victory now let me say this this is before any instance of victory was manifested in the battlefield this is before anything before he knew the numbers of his enemies what they triy all he knew is in the natural they didn't have enough shoes they didn't have enough guns they were outgun they were out shoes they the the the enemy was more than they were but all he knew is I have victory in my heart I prayed and God showed me that I'm going to have Victory let me say this perseverance is not what's happening in the natural perseverance is an attribute of God that he drops within the heart of of a Believer before one sand is move on the mountain you already know it's going to happen our kind of perseverance is we pray we' open up one eye is it still there I need to pray a little more this is a man snow everywhere knowing physically that they were under a great disadvantage that they didn't have enough gun didn't have enough shoes to wear they didn't they were not clothes properly but yet after praying after going down on their knees something within his heart tells him you're going to have Victory and he stands up at one place but whatam says he got shot and the shot went directly from his jacket and I never stopped him he kept going until the victory came to pass that's right and I want to say this that's the kind of Christian we want to be we don't want to be all broken up by what we see we don't want to be all tired and all disappointed and and and give up just because of what we see no you see sin and you see all of that and your children are not serving God and this is happening that one is sick and this one is going on you need to go down on your knees you need to pray until Victory is in your heart yes then when you stand there it doesn't matter what you see it's never going to discourage you because you'll know that The God Who revealed the victory in your heart that God will bring it to come to pass a man who's ever met God who's ever come in contact with God is persevering right let me just jump ahead but what I'm talks about David and and I know we tell the story and and I I just began to think about it and it just broke my heart and I say you know what nobody give David a chance right now we can we can sit here and read it like it's a nice story and oh that's a great story and everything if you were in that time nobody gave him a chance he came to Saul and Saul tried to take his jacket and put it now they call him a lead oh when when they heard someone was willing at least to stand up he says bring him over they looked at him and says he's just a lad they he he says okay put this on let let's just at least try to cover so we can make the battle last at least 30 seconds but here today we we talk about it as if it was natural for that to happen happened nobody gave him a chance they went home knowing that they were going to be defeated they knew that they didn't have a chance if Saul but the the scripture Call Saul it says he was heading shoulders above everyone if Saul didn't have the guts to stand there how much more nobody could stand because he was the one who was given to be king and he was given a task to protect the nation he R away today we read it and we make David this giant and no he was not given a chance and the prophet say this if nobody gives you a chance at least if God is on your side that settles it oh my brother my sister the odd can be stacked up against you that's wonderful you don't need everybody to believe you you just need God on your side you just need a him on your side it's going to change your whole [Applause] [Music] equation he stood there and they put the jacket and like we can't even make it last 30 seconds take a and David is like this is too heavy I can't wear this I I can't even stand up my arm he couldn't even lift up his arm to go fight is like I mean this I'm just going to get there and just lay down and fall flat at least I need to be myself to try this out so he said okay let him go they let him go and yes Little David and Oh my he came and his testimony was he says so how do you think you're going to do this now when he came to Goliath I want you to understand these words that he spoke he didn't come to Goliath as himself he said that who are you to defy the army of the Living God one thing that David knew was God was it was his Israel one thing that David knew that Israel was God's nation that God gave them that Nation there were people called out David knew about the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob at least he knew something about the God that they were supposed to be worshiping he said but one day but but will say they say he comes and they ask him and said you know what I don't have much experience but one thing I know he says one thing my dad he put me overseer I want you to catch this he put me overseer over the Sheep he put me in charge of the sheep and while being in charge of the sheep it says a lion came David understood the responsibility that was laid upon his shoulder and because he stood for the responsibility that was given to him God help him defend that so the only only reason why he was able to defend against a lion and the bear is because he took the responsibility that was given him and he opposed the enemy that was coming against him he won the fight but don't forget that that same David was also anointed to be king over Israel so now he moved from one responsibility to another he's now anointed to be king therefore when he come and they stood that's why there was nobody who could even stand and let me ask you this what has God put you over see over he's giv you a family he's giving you a church he's giving you a people to be in fellowship with why don't you stand like David tonight and say God has called me to be a son and a daughter God has given me my family God has given me my wife my children therefore I'm only standing for that position and nothing else no we run away from our responsibilities we go look for somebody else to fight our battles he wasn't the strongest he wasn't the the the one who could do it the fastest but one thing he knew was I was given this responsibility and I'm standing up on the responsibility I was given he says he had that he knew he says he felt in his heart that God had given him Victory and he had prayed through the next day we know three musket bullet went through his coat without touching him and the river couldn't stop him neither could a musket bullets the the musket Bullet Stop stop him he was pers persistent because he had prayed through he had the he had faith in what he was doing in the one thing that was leading him was that was God he says now listen nothing is going to stop a man he's persistent when he knows what he's doing and got fid in what he's trying to achieve in another place he says for instance like what we call the father of our nation speaking about the same story George Washington he was perseverant when he tried to achieve the victory over the British and crossed the icy Delaware he was persevering he was there was nothing it says his soldiers half of them didn't have shoes on their feet and was robbed in rags and the winds was blowing listen to this but he had prayed all night and had victory in his heart what what we need is victory in here not out here victory in here will manifest the victory out here the problem is we don't have victory in here we're looking for the victory outside when that Blind Men screamed I'm heal he already believ in his heart that what the prophet told him was true so what was true within his heart came to manifest outside so when we pray what we looking for is God to make his word reality in here yes but when I'm talks about the couple I was thinking about it that had a Babys sick in the hospital and all that we're trying to do is to get brother bam to come and pray for the son they said we believe that if you pray for our son he'll be healed they try everything and finally bam came and the way he said it he came and they told him they said we believe that if you lay your hands on our son he'll be healed he said if that's what you believe wonderful he went and but says the doctors the doctor goes out the nurse was there he comes and he prays and he prays and he's done and they hug him and says oh thank you very much for coming thank you and but when I'm walks out and they start rejoicing hallelujah praise God he's healing praise God and the nurse is there completely confounded he looks at them and says I can't believe you're doing this it says there's not on the record anybody whose blood pressure has gone down this low where we gotten this measurement and that is says this and that instrument there's never been a case where we put all of this together and that person comes to live and I love this but when him says then this old man he says he didn't get mad he didn't rebuke you get out of the hospital or whatever get out of the room no he said he came and he put his hand around the little little uh sister he said the little nurse and he says let me tell you something you are trying to look at this instrument you are trying to get your measurement from here you are trying to understand what these instruments are saying but I am trying to look at the promise up above and if the promise up above says is heal I don't care what the instruments are telling me that's what a Christian is a Christian is not an outward person looking it's an inward person looking one who cares about what God is saying and if God says it I don't care if the righted sea is in front I don't care if the Jordan is in front as long as God said it I know it's going to move one way or the other perseverant yes we are not given to be those that will just lay down and you know the devil he'll come and wreck all kinds of hers this is going wrong over here that's going and if we're not careful all we say is well God is going to do it when he wants to do it or we just going to wait until God does it or whatever not speaking from the position of perseverance but speaking from the position of hopelessness we can't be hopelessness that word doesn't even exist in the Christian vocabulary I will believe until I will stand until I'll stay here I'll pray until until if it doesn't happen today I'll pray tomorrow I'll pray the next day I'll continue to stand in the Gap until my son is Wayward God gave it to me and I believe if God gave it to me God will bring him back how many examples we have in the Bible but when I'm talks about uh I'm probably confusing now I believe it was martyr he says yes she comes and he says master and yeah we are and we know that they there was never a case where someone is dead for 4 days and resurrected so perhaps we know of a case where one died and he was prayed for or sick he was prayed for and he raised one who just died and there was a funeral possession and he came and erased but one who's dead for four days and the nose sunk him that we never seen before but butam says perhaps they might and perhaps I'm confusing if you confusing you forgive me he's talking about how they had a reference in the Bible it could have been a shite woman or it could have been an example where elizah came and he laid upon the boy and he raised and butam says this they knew that if God was in Elijah surely God was in his son and I want to say this if God was in the prophet surely God is in the bride let's not forget that if God was in his prophet in the end time where he came and he manifested himself and that head is tied to the body and the prophet is the member of the Bride is the chief W of offering surely that God must be in his bride that's right and he came and he says he says oh I believe that thou are the Son of God and and he says I believe in the resurrection he says no I am the resurrection and life he looks at him and says yes I believe that that in the last day he'll be raised and everything he stood there and he looked at him and he cried he says take me to him they took him to him and everybody says oh perhaps it's going to go cry at the tomb and he must have really loved him and everything he comes and he stand there and after crying he looks and he says take away the unbelief take all the unbelief away roll away the stone and they roll away the stone and he called forth and he says Lazarus come forth and what says if he didn't precise Resurrection was going to happen then my brother my sister that same voice is in the bride in the end time [Applause] this message brings the voice of the Resurrection in you the the voice to speak life into existence the voice to speak things that don't exist as of the world the voice to bring healing the bring the voice to extend the kingdom of God but you here we are Hallelujah not even understanding let me say this we need to be persistent yes we need to be a persevering people I don't care what your day was like I don't care what you go through when God has spoken when God has promised something you stand there and believe it so now we look at this man and the devil always there to offer reasons why you should not be persevering offering excuses but a Believer has to make a choice and the choice is between what you see and what's been revealed in here if it's not revealed that's why he said we're going to walk by Revelation he says how do you begin in the spirit and then In the Flesh and then end up turning towards the flesh now so things can happen no if it started by Revelation it's going to finish in Revelation that's why it says to the bride Rapture is a revelation it's not a calculation of what we need to do in order to get there though it's going to be revealed when the time comes in fact I'll say this it's it's in we are in the season of the revealing of it so it could get us ready for that time we we as fellowshipping with the brothers we we walk so much in the number system in other words the numbers have to add up you tell me this is going to happen now yeah so if we add up the numbers and we understand the numbers then we go I believe it no that's not Faith that's right at least that's human Faith that's not the kind of Faith we're talking about the kind of Faith we're talking about is Noah God telling him it's going to rain when people don't even know the definition of rain can you explain you okay we want to believe your message but what do you mean rain it's like out of the sky water's going to come down it says okay now remember but says more technological than we are with atomic bomb done things that we couldn't do kept colors for years that we things that we don't even know how they did so now they looking at him and says now you know that we have instruments that we can point out there and measure everything and come up with a measurement of what rain is or if anything is going to happen you know that yes I do but guess what God showed him a vision and I never stopped him the word he said God made himself reveal unto him God told him he gave him the commandment and nothing was going to stop him let me say this that's why the scripture says we walk by faith and not by sight we don't walk by what we see we don't react by what we see no what we need as children of God is to know what is it that's been revealed to us so we can walk by it the natural that you see will change every time it looked like there was going to be rain today but I looked at it my phone says it started off with 30 40% and now it's 1% what happened it changed so if we constantly get to a place where we need to see it where we need to see a movement and and we need to shout so we know we have it we need to scream so we know we have it this has to happen we have to have a service where everybody's up then we know we got it we're going to be the most miserable people we're going to shout our backs are going to hurt and we're going to come back and do it again and get hurt and everything what we need is to know what is the promise of God for our age what is it that he's made a promise unto me therefore it doesn't matter whether you feel it you don't feel it whether you see it you don't see it what you stand on is upon the word of God once Victory is revealed in the heart the natural circumstance doesn't mean anything but what I'm say so Noah stand there and now is telling them it's going to rain and they knew that God watered the Earth he knew that there was a d th Came Upon the vegetation and everything and that's everything was water they never knew or understood anything about the rain but God told him it was going to rain and Noah believed the word of God and God made his promise to come true but says it says this it says most people today and our repeat myself I will repeat myself from last night saying they have hope instead of faith and I find people coming to the platform they're just built up in hopes but faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence the evidence it's not a myth it's not an imagination it's something you've got it's something you've got yes sir oh butam says that Moses was born with the instrument in him to get the job done you are you with me when when when a Believer comes on the scene by election he has an instruments within him what the burning bush did was to activate the instruments that was in Moses so he can go and do the job his hearts always wanted to do the job his heart's always wanted for the people and everything but when he went and tried to do it by himself he failed he was called a murderer what he needed was an activation of the instruments that was within him so he can get the job done and God does the same thing for every son and daughter of God he places the instruments inside of you you so when you hear the word of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit your instrument is activated so you can have the faith so faith is something that is in you amen it's word coming upon word it's word activating word it's word bringing the word into existence he says for instance I it says I I it says if I'm starving to death and and and and and and I had a loaf of bread that cost a quarter it says but the loaf of bread it says now when I have a quarter in my hand it says I'm just as happy if I have the loaf of bread because it's a purchas fice of the bread and when I know in my heart that I have received it and I believe that God is giv it to me I'm just as happy with faith as if I as if I was if I had healing if I was healed because I'm going to be healed anyhow I've got the substance right now nobody can take it away from me I know it's right and I can be perseverant with that oh my brother my sister when you have faith you have Deliverance when you have faith you have healing when you have faith you have your children when you're afraid you have all that you're looking for so you might as well be happy with that than when thing is going to happen why because within your heart God has already show you that it's in there how come you're going to desire something that you couldn't even obtain now remember but what says [Applause] this sickness could not be manifested unless there was a Healer the Deep call unto the Deep the fish the fan on the fish's back God would have never given the handan on the fish back unless there was water so God would have never given you the desire to be a son unless in you there was an ability to be a son God would have never given you the ability to be an overcomer unless there was overcoming that was somewhere so all you're doing by crying out is allowing God to pour into you what you were supposed to be to begin with we already saved we already healed those are attributes of a Christian we're supposed to be perseverant about those things we're not supposed to give that to give up oh oh you know just walk with our head down I don't know I've been asking God and it's not happening it's the building of the character it's the setting up for what's about to happen let me say this why would you even need to be perseverant if there was nothing on the other side perseverance is the ability that God the patience that God places in you to continue to walk it's going to happen and as you're walking changes is happening by itself as you're walking like Abraham the more my flesh is dying the more faith I have about this living God the more I know I can't produce the Sun the more I know he's going to have to do it the more what was Abraham Faith counted for righteousness he said that the more that he knew his body was dying the more that he knew that God is able to bring the son and even when he was asked to offer the son he said the same God who gave Isaac from the dead Isaac came from the dead Isaac came from God he knew that he had no ability in to bring Isaac so if God provided Isaac when his body was dead God was able to raise Isaac from the dead persevering from the promise you know what I'm just going to do this because that's the only but when says they ask him about his mom he said I couldn't say anything because God didn't show me today we want people to just say things and people speak all kinds of things without even God showing them but we need is the revealing of the word of God in our hearts so we can walk by it if the musician could comeu but one says I know living in an intellectual age and scientific age it says and it was a prophet and the Lord told him that it was going to rain and after Noah hearing the voice of God being a prophet to the the prophet to the voice of God of the Lord the word of the Lord comes to the pro to his prophet he knew he was going it was going to rain no matter what no matter what anyone said whether whether he be ever reigned he says and he never had rained before God irrigated the ground the vegetation with irrigation from the springs and so forth in the earth there was never been a cloud in the sky but yet Noah knew that there was coming water from above how is he going to do it he doesn't know but he was so perseverant he went and built an ark according to the specification that God said to him for him to build it because he had heard the voice of God did you hear the voice of God in this same time do what the voice told you the rest God will take care of it you just follow the voice The Voice told me to go to church I'm in church The Voice told me to do this I'm just following the voice the voice that told you to do what what you do that voice will take care of everything else the voice that called you and say believe my word that voice will bring you to the next step that voice will provide what you have need of along the way you just follow the voice you just believe the voice your promise is to follow the voice it's God's place for him to bring those things to transpire into your life let's all stand [Applause] oh there's just so much that could be said but will use terminology like this and I and I and I and as as I read it I just pray that let let this become the echo of our heart it says when a man gets his answer from God there's nothing that can stop him when a man knows that the word knows that the word knows the word and the will of God he will become persistent when a man has victory in his heart when a man hears the voice of God so this things is always what God is doing inside of a man is always something that is been Quicken to you it's always God's ability to communicate directly with you it's always something that has happened to you according to what the promise is it's always God coming to do in your heart God letting you know it's always by Revelation it's never by knowledge so when we receive a revelation then we can walk remember he said if God told me that he was going to raise George White George Washington he says I'll call all the whole world and tell them about it that's right now that same God has told us that we're going to go into Rapture have we told everybody now we're not sure we're going now he said surely the elect will go into Rapture those that are elected will go into Rapture how are we going to know how do we know we're going to R in Rapture because he said it how do we know we are healed because he said we are healed now it's easy to believe it for healing for deliverance for whatever but it's hard to believe for Rapture no that's not how he want us to walk he wants us to believe every word of God every promise in the book of mine whatever he says whether I understand it don't understand it I'll walk by it whether it's manifested today or didn't manifest I'll believe it why because the same God is here to make his word a reality our gracious father we're so thankful Lord for your word and father we just want to say thank you Lord because it's not us doing the pushing and the walking and but it's you leading us and guiding us father Christian walk is not made for the strong and the educated or the eloquent speakers but father is made to those who believe Lord and you promise that when we believe Lord that you will give us a revelation or something within our hearts and that will cause us to be perseverant and perhaps not as fast as they the herrow father probably just the perhaps just the slow as the slowest animal that we know often but Lord God we know we're surely going to make it because your word said he that will endure Until the End father we just ask that you give us endurance tonight oh God and you didn't promise that every day will be a sunshiny day and and we know that by your word that everything runs in season we have winter time and we have summertime and we have all kinds of seasons and but Lord the burning desires of our heart is no matter what season we find ourselves let let us be perseverant Lord let us be progressing for father let us be holding on to the word let us be making steps little by little believing knowing that you're going to make your promise a reality father We Praise You In the good times we praise you in the bad times we praise you when we don't have we praise you when we have father all we know that all things work together for the good of them that love you father increase our love for you our love for your word and help us walk according to your will and way help us be perseverant Lord increase our Revelation that we may be dedicated oh God yes that we may not be slowful and father that not be those that will be disappointed because of the challenges but father those that will continue to press on that's the desires of our heart father if there be any here that needs prayer Lord father father I lift my hands tonight and it's my heart desire Lord and Lord may you just show us victory in our hearts oh God may you just show us your word in our hearts oh God and may it be something that you're doing in our hearts not necessarily outside but let it start in our hearts Lord because we know if we see it in our hearts father the same God who did it in our hearts will make it come to pass outside we love you Lord and we commit everything we are we ask this things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen let's just sing that oh faithful one so
