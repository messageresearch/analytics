christ we pray amen amen amen we're happy to be gathering his presence this morning i want to welcome everyone both that are online and here present man as you invite foreign god bless you good morning we're going to look in psalm 66 this morning i was reading that yesterday and uh verse stuck out to me in verse four go ahead and read that real quick it says all the earth all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name selah any time you see that word sila it's an instruction to pause it's a musical term just to pause have the music stop but you know more than anything it's an instruction to stop and to consider to reflect on the significance of what was just said and so it caught my attention that that verse says all the earth shall worship thee and it occurred it occurred to me that that's that's a promise that hasn't been fulfilled yet you know it's a promise a reminder of where things are headed all this that's going on around us is coming to the point that all the earth shall worship thee isaiah 45 23 says this is the lord speaking it says i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth and righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear philippians 2 verse 9 we know this well it says wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name remember in verse 4 of psalm 66 it says they shall sing to thy name it says that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father finally in revelation 15 4 it says who shall fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee you know we know that's not where we at where we're at today is we look at all the the voices the trouble the pestilence the pressure the perversion it's all around us remember there's a day coming this is all under his control this is his mighty hand positioning all things so that one day all the earth will worship him but it's interesting here in psalm 66 as he spends some time speaking of that day there's another pause and it changes its focus in verse 8. now instead of all the earth now it's bless our god ye people it says in verse 8 oh bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard which holdeth our soul and life and suffereth not our feet to be moved you know while there may be a day coming when all flesh will worship him there's a people on the earth right now that are worshiping him so how do we worship him you know certainly with singing and with prayer praise absolutely that's a part of worship but there's more to worship than that you know there's an old saying that goes the highest form of flattery is imitation you know while that may just be something that men say there's an element of truth in that real worship true worship is when someone absolutely surrenders their own identity to take on the identity of someone else happens in the world all the time you have celebrities you have sports figures and people will absolutely lose themselves trying to dress the same way and talk the same way and live the same way and look the same way they're worshiping that individual well it's no different than when a people lays down their identity and takes up his identity that's the highest form of worship there is it says in john 4 4 john 15 it says greater love hath no man than this but that he lay down his life through a friend so there's a people on the earth right now while we're waiting for that day true worshipers who do so by laying down their life that he might live amen they bear his image they declare him not their own message not their own image not their own will not their own anything that when they see us they see him that's the highest form of worship that there is finally it says in verse 18 of psalm 66 he says if i regard iniquity in my heart if i'm pursuing my identity my message my image the lord will not hear me but i like what it says in verse 19 but verily god hath heard me you know and why is that because there was someone on the earth that was a true worshiper do we have some true worshipers in the house today maybe yeah those who lay down their own image their own life that his might live there's a day coming where the whole earth will worship him but in the meantime let us worship him with with all of our heart let's go ahead and read that together psalm 66. make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands sing forth the honor of his name make his praise glorious say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shalt thine enemies submit thy souls unto them all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name selah come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men he turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on foot there did we rejoice in him he ruleth by his power forever his eyes behold the nations let not the rebellious exalt themselves say oh bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard which holdeth our soul and life and suffereth not our feet to be moved for thou o god has proved us thou hast tried us as silver has tried thou brought us us into the net thou ladest affliction upon our loins thou has cast men to rise over our heads we went through fire and through water but thou brought us us out into a wealthy place i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered and my mouth had spoken when i was in trouble i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah come in here all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done my soul i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me amen god bless you have your seats let's see he brought me out of the maori clay amen oh my heart was distressed full and is [Music] he set my feet [Music] is

the book of revelations the third chapter and the 14th verse and let us read in the third chapter of the book of revelations in the 14th verse unto the angel of the church of ladies write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works thou thou art neither cold nor hot i would that work cold or hot so then because thou art and neither cold nor hot i will spill thee out of my mouth because thou saith i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried and fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i have also overcame him and set down with my father in his throne he that heaven here to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen i like that verse to him that overcometh well i grant to sit with me in my throne and he says hear my voice and open door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me god bless you may be seated it's nice to be in the house this morning uh lord this morning the few of us that are able to uh gather out together and fellowship around the things of the lord we just trust that the lord will certainly be your portion this morning you know last week i just addressed a little bit of the thing that's going on that has been brought to my attention and as you know um there's been videos sent out and things sent out about uh you know about the message of the hour and uh one set of videos as you know uh claims to basically be be called a trial and uh and you know and i i thought about it and i prayed about it and i i'm not gonna spend much time on it because uh i've come to the conclusion of the jury i know what the jury is going to what the verdict is going to be and i think a lot of times in a trial that both sides that are putting someone on trial they go through great lengths of the makeup of the jury they find out if people think this way and think about that way and so when i stood back i said i i looked at who is the jury right what's the jury made up out of and the jury's made up out of believers make believers and unbelievers that's who is there and we saw that in the the trial that you have is that each side presents their evidence now evidence is a very uh different type of understanding he said on the other hand evidence is something that is told by someone that has to be accepted only on belief the evidence and you present the evidence and the reason i'm coming to such a quick conclusion of the verdict in all of this it's called you look at the evidences and there's different types of evidences there's 12 different types of evidence and there's anadolical evidence that's where you compare things there's just all these different words for example there's counter evidence and all these things for example if i was to say everybody's favorite food is pizza and then someone would say my favorite food isn't pizza my favorite food is hamburger so that says that that's not everybody's favorite food because this person's food that evidence goes back and forth that evidence is uh and then there's comparative evidence and there's character evidence and if you consider the character of the person that's presenting the evidence in other words did they tell one story one time and now are they telling another story this time what's the basis of the credibility of the evidence i mean it comes down if the person's not credible is their evidence credible and and so that's one type of evidence and then there's hearsay evidence and hearsay is what you've heard somebody else say evidence you've received from somebody else and then there's direct evidence direct evidence that's the evidence that a person has experienced themselves and the direct evidence and so you know when it's all said and done there's something that's called the preponderance of evidence and that is the quality the quantity or facts greater in number quality or importance so when you weigh it all you look at what facts are important and what facts aren't important and can you draw your conclusion based on the preponderance of evidence and when someone's presenting something they both sides have their evidence and you we know that one side might come and say uh uh this is this and and this is the evidence and then the other side presents their evidence and we know the side of uh an argument is this facts didn't add up and this dates didn't match and we can't make this happen and this doesn't reason out now the other side has their evidence too the angel of the lord the pillar of fire uh how that you could go down all the testimonies the miracles the signs the wonders the prophecies and all those things and and the greater value and to the believer the the thing that finally catches them is the direct evidence what they have personally experienced from the uh of what is on trial and so when it's all said and done it's going to be a hung jury you're going to have believers make believers and unbelievers there will not be a conclusion drawn so it'll go one day to the judge amen and that's the final showdown the final showdowns the catching away of the church and so there there's no need pursuing a a a trial that's going to have a hung jury yeah there's going to be believers make believers and unbelievers but let's move on from that because i think the important thing is that about the message about trying to put the message on trial is that it becomes a distraction to what this real message is really what was the message and and i would like to refer a little bit this morning to a sermon called the way of a true prophet and what a prophet's message really is and we find out that if when god ever wants to deal with people he's always had a way of dealing with people god has never left his people without the spirit of god to call them and direct them and to reach out to them and to help them god is concerned about his sheep and he's concerned about his children and oftentimes uh as we um look into uh the word of god i think it's important not to be distracted away from really what it was that was being brought to us we get so caught up so much and does you know does this date work this date and when was this done and when was that done and that never was the purpose of what that god was trying to bring to us in others if i could say it like this that within all the confines of the message all the healing campaigns all the miraculous things that are such proof of evidence that god was with this man that if you can't believe me for my words look at my works i i've heard it testify and like i would say i would bring all these things up one of the the one person that's claiming this this isn't right and this isn't right the other side comes up and they're very testimonies and and you we can list them i mean like congressman upshaw's testimony if you could read it he talks about how he was in the meeting and health in washington the works in los angeles and the works of the lord were being done and now his heart was just on on fire and after any any how the word of god was being preached and how he was moved on and all of a sudden you know okay they say brother branham became weak as we know and they took them off the thing and then he sent back and sent a message and says tell the congressman that he's healed and he said i threw down my crutches and i ran towards the pastor i mean the the preponderance of evidence is it is you can't even begin to touch a testimonies that have come forth a man sitting in the tabernacle uh i heard the very testimony out of the mouth of the very one of the witnesses that said he sat there and he saw communion wine just be created in the cups their own testimony legs being made whole couldn't get the braces off uh on and on and on if you could the volumes of the books can't contain the whole of what the lord jesus did and we could go on for hours and hours and and the list of people that have testified what god has done for him and how the great works florence nightingale and act and oh just all the things that could come up but in getting caught up in the argument of this is right and this is wrong and he did this and he did that and no he missed this and he missed that and when you get caught up in that argument you begin to understand that the how the reasoning begins to work and and and and how that the two sides fall and we covered last week we covered that what we felt was the most substantial evidence of all was the direct evidence the personal effect of what that the lord jesus christ has done for you personally and that is the evidence that finally is the most determining factor and so but in doing this i i thought back and i said you know i don't need to defend this message i want to defend this method you know what i mean i want to bring up all the evidence all the miracles all the mighty things a command asks his father he says why why did you stay with brother branham when jack cole was your friend why did you stay with brother branham when you were in a.a allen's meetings why did you stay with brother branham why did you stay with him and the the man's answer was because he says there was nobody in all these meetings everywhere that had the presence of the angel of the lord when that angel of the lord would come into the the meetings he said the atmosphere would change everything would change you knew that that presence of the lord came you felt that presence of the lord you felt that power of the lord and a divine angel from heaven came into the room and he knew the secrets and intents of the heart and even people that disagreed with his doctrine said he never missed it and so i thought yeah that's i want to stand up for that evidence but i don't want to get caught in the battle of evidence and miss the message to miss what it was that he was trying to bring to the believer i don't want to get caught up in the argument of vindication and under vindication vindication versus air that's what takes place one side presents all what they feel is their evidence to get you to believe and the other side presents their evidence to get you to believe and that trial will always end in a hung jury people that believe the preponderance of the evidence and people that don't believe the evidence that'll start but within the framework of that there was something that was trying to be told to the church and that's what really makes a prophet a prophet in other words it's the way of a true prophet the way of a true prophet is to lay out that word and the final vindication and the final resting place of anybody's decision should be the scriptures should be the word of god amen and so i'd like to just use as used in this message and this is found on paragraph 92 in the message of a way of a true prophet in 62 and we read lady osea because i think it's evident that we can look around us and see that the conditions of lady osea are very prevalent i believe we can also look around and see that the conditions of sodom and gomorrah are very prevalent and the conditions of the day of noah are very prevalent it's it's it beyond measure and we don't want to get distracted away from the circumstances and the situation that we find ourselves in he says but those god anointed eyes of that prophet didn't narrow because of the glamour like some tourists and there's he didn't look at the great city and and look down there and see all the buildings and see all that and say wow this is something he wasn't attracted to it like a tourist might be attracted to it i i love going into old uh countries and and walking down the streets that are from the 16th century and the old alleyways and the narrow bricks and the narrower the city streets and the more windy they are and the older they are the more i'm attracted to it it's it but that's the glamour of that but that's not what caught the prophet's attention because you can understand so a prophet's made a prophet he's made a certain way and and and god's able to raise up out of stones out of nothing a prophet he doesn't have to come from an educational background he doesn't have to come from an organization he doesn't have to come from a school he doesn't have to come from a system in other words god can take nothing and move upon it raise him up and give him a message and of course we know that he has ways of attracting people to that message those are the ways of his choosing and in all those things we could get caught up on the way of attraction of how that god used uh the gifts to attract the people and to catch the attention of the people but the idea of catching their attention wasn't to catch them to the the attention drawer what drew their attention which would be the signs and the wonders that drew their attention but along with that the the signs there was a voice that came with the sign or there's a message that comes with it something that was being said and delivered and that's what we don't want to get distracted from it's like police cars racing down the road because the bridge is falling out and they're flashing their lights and everything and and you get so enamored with the flashing lights and you get so enamored with it that you forget the message was the bridge is out so you just keep driving you keep going your way and then you start arguing about the color of the lights and the and the what signs are on the side of the car and you lose you lose the whole purpose behind the ministry and there's no doubt that brethren have probably described by every radio commentator every talk show host every even the critics they testify there's never been a ministry like this not since the days of the lord have they ever seen or felt the divinity that was present they the they testify to the humility and the nature and the character now they may disagree doctrinally and that's not what i'm saying here but it's you can't forget or miss what was delivered that's like being describing the mailman and how great the mailman was and how he carried his bag and and and how his suit was impeccable and his shoes were so polished and he was always on time wind rain snow you know the mail was delivered and and uh and never opening the letter or saying i got this letter look at the letter i've got look at this letter i received this letter personally from from the from whomever and and i've got this letter and and these are all the vindications that brought this letter to me and this letter came across the ocean and and the boat was turned upside down and the bag swept to an island and somebody found the bag and go all the history of all the great magnificent miracles that delivered that message to you and never read it or never receive it and until you read it you will never know the authenticity of it you could tell me it was a letter from my wife and you could tell me all that god did and all the miracles that he wrote in order to get this to me but i'll never know it's from her until i open up and read it because i would know just by the words by the sense of feeling from the unity and the experiences and everything about it i would know if it was from her or not amen and i'm the only one that can verify its authenticity right you can say the postage date don't match uh you know they said it came this way but it was stamped over here i don't know about that i i don't know it by by its journey i know it by its content and if we don't receive the message if we don't read the letter if we don't understand its purpose then it dies in argument in other words the jury is hung it's come the unbelievers are going to disbelieve the make-believers are going to play both sides of the fence and the believers they're sold out so i think it's it's important that we focus now let's listen to this what he said he said but those anointed eyes of that prophet didn't narrow because of the glamour like some tourists but on the moral corruption to a people who was called to be blessed of god now so we we begin to the the purpose of the message begins to unfold of us what the way of a true prophet is a way of the true prophet is when he looks out he sees that the moral corruption that is on a people who have been called to be blessed of god in other words you're called to be blessed of god but you're caught up in everything else that's being offered his eyes didn't look at the glamour they didn't narrow because of the glamour it was because the indecency and the corruption of the people that had been called to be chosen of god now this is the motive this is the objective that these people were called they they were called to be the chosen of god and would act in such a way as that they're saying you're called to be the children of god you're called to something higher you're called to something greater you're called to a blessing and look what you are caught up in now why get over into all this other stuff and miss that important part of god's word wonder he said the lion roareth and who will not fear god spoke and who can keep from prophesying he's seen the corruption the decay that's what he was looking at that's when he seen all of that it didn't attract him it sickened him at his soul why he was a prophet he knowed what god had promised to bless and what a blessing was and how people acted with the blessing if if i could just hold there i think that's probably a wonderful description of what took place he's made that way he's made that corruption sickens him he's made that it hurts him in his soul when he sees a people that's blessed and blessed of god and called to be blessed of god and have turned and been drawn off to something totally perverse and the devil has perverted the devil has perverted in his day from what a real blessing was a moral declare decay a blessing to tickle the eyes and appetites of unconverted people to the will and way of god and god's way of life this was the the the substance of the purpose that god sent the message even in lady elsia he says you're blind miserable poor wretched and naked you're decayed the condition of the world you've turned into sodomites you you've left the ways of god you've left the word of god you left everything let's go back and look at the condition look at where people were the country was starting to move away from the things of god from the spirit of god the blessings of god the baptism of the holy ghost holiness begin to leave women begin to move from dresses to pants from long hair to bobbing their hair from clean face to makeup and glamour and lips and poking drugs in their lips and everywhere doing all kinds of stuff in other words the whole thing is adrift away from god you know that that's easy to all of a sudden lay aside the consciousness of our own morality this is what a prophet sees he says he had the word of the lord for the nation this is paragraph 1 1 1. he had the word of the lord for the nation but the true word of the lord was foreign to those people yet they thought they had it i hope this gets down deep they thought that they were so pious and religious that the real word of god was a foreign thing to them now we're talking about what the message was the message doesn't change and the message is scriptural amen the message the word the scripture said is an abomination for a woman to put on a garment pertaineth to the man that is the scripture that is the word of god the word of god says there's one god i am the lord thy god that's the word of god the message comes from the scriptures that's right where it is i'm amazed that someone would say oh i i saw this mistake or this thing that dad didn't add up so i went and started studying the scriptures wait a minute you never heard the message the message was read your bible pray study the scriptures look and see what the word said back to the word back to the bible back to the scriptures if you'd have stayed in the word of god and studied the scripture you may but it's because you missed the message [Music] you didn't read the love letter what was written to you that's the way it is today the true word of god made manifest is a foreign thing to lots of pentecostal people the real interpretation of the word the real woes and curses the real blessings of god is a foreign thing to many people who call themselves holiness church members christians it's a foreign thing to them they don't know it mention it to them they never heard of such a thing and yet their organizations grow and prosper getting bigger and bigger members all the time and more organizations added every year what what's the message the message is you're not you're not looking at the word the message if you're not you don't see the woes and the curses the wages of sin is death they don't see the woes that are coming the curse is we're in a woe the things that are happening that they didn't see the the the delinquency and the drugs and the addictions that were coming to a people that left the lord who quit praying in schools who quit praying at the dinner table who quit going to church who substituted football and cowboy games for going to church they're so addicted to the those losers with the star on their head to that they will stay out of the house of god and they wonder why they're full of woes people wonder why they don't realize the woes and the curses that come with and the fruits of a life that separated from the word of god and from the scriptures away seemeth right unto the man but the end that way of death and the weak pulpits who are lying to the people telling me they're fine telling the sisters it don't matter you dress this way that don't really matter that's not really matter god god doesn't really love you in other words they forget what the message was what it was he was telling us what it was that was screaming out of his heart what it was he was trying to get the people to see they it became foreign the power of the resurrection the power of faith the power of a dedicated life to christ a life of as matthew priests of self-denial a life that that is set aside for his whole purpose of knowing the scriptures reading the scriptures serving the scriptures going to the word of god for directions opening and reading every line it can tell the revelation of god's word pours into your heart the victorious life that that produces and the life of death that living that way not living that way of a surrendered life what the results were if we're not careful it's not soon that the message is no longer even heard he said then if i do not the works this paragraph 1 16 if i do not the works of god don't believe me but if the works speak themselves believe the works if you don't want to believe me look at he was doing this we dropped down to paragraph 120 but god raised up god takes what he wants to take he takes nothing usually to do his work show that it's god a man is all puffed up and thinks he's something then god can't use him because there's too much of himself that's what's a matter with christians christian church today they think they know something the bible says when a man thinks he knows something he knows nothing that he ought to know that's the trouble of today we've got so much self so much hypocrisy so much education so much religion and know nothing about the salvation of the word of god that's the pitiful part of it amen now we're starting to see the message what what he's telling us what what what the what the way of a true prophet is believe it or not with all the signs and wonders and all the miracles and all the healings it wouldn't be a true prophet until he screamed out against the sin because that's a way of a true prophet is back to the word he could have done signs of wonder signs and wonders and then never stood and preached the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ because that's the only biblical scriptural baptism there is that's right see the real evidence is in the word the real evidence is in the message he delivered amen that's right that's the real evidence because that's the way of a true prophet now they want to argue about this and they want to argue about that but my question is is the message the word of god that's the real determination did this age get in the ladylc and condition did this age get in this sodom condition did this age be as it was in the days of noah amen that's the question is the evidence of the holy spirit speaking in tongues or is the evidence of seed that says amen to every word of god see you can't be drifted and that's what struck me there's a lot there was a lot of fanaticism that followed that's right people say oh you believe brother abraham's infallible brother brown never laid anything on himself it wasn't he was infallible the message is this is infallible this word is what's infallible i i don't know did the word of god promised before the great and dreadful day of the lord that i'll send a prophet that's scriptural did it profit before the ministry of the son of man there there there's there's many things that are are laid down but the basis and the root of them is the scriptures and that was part of what this message was is go back and anchor yourself in a personal relationship with the lord jesus christ and the word of god but it's easy to miss the message it's easy to get caught up in all the signs and wonders that prove that it's right just like you can get caught up in all the questionable reasonable things that man's mind can't put together but don't you realize the carnal mind is at enni with god and spiritual things are only discerned by the spirit that's not what we're based on it doesn't do us any good if we could prove tell with everything that we're convinced you'll never convince an unbeliever never a make believer you'll never know whether he's convinced or not but a real believer reads and hears the message what the message was and that's what he do he says that let me see if if paragraph 131 he says but you think you could keep him there he says you can't cage the word of god no no it'll come forth anyhow prison bars opened one night when they tried to cage it the light come in and delivered him out and and so when you become to come to find out you begin to find out that what the church did is it left the foundation of the word of god it left what it was built on look that's where to come back he says you're building on the wrong foundation paul even said watch what every man builds on they begin to build on things that weren't buildable on they begin to build on numbers they begin to build on systems they begin to build organizations they begin to they begin to attract people by their programs and by their gems and and and by their social experience this is the message this is what's being said you're leaving god you're leaving the real baptism being born again nature change of the gospel and the product of the scriptures why get caught up in the argument when the best thing for me to do is read the message hear the message and i'm not talking about the books because if the letter killeth it killeth i'm talking about the life that was being described and the the life that was being presented to the people that they were missing what what they were lacking in the power of the presence of god of the fellowship and the union and that's all he put on display he put on display the power of the resurrection the love of god god's power to deliver god's power to heal god's power to save a presentation of the life of christ in this generation so a people could look and receive that life it never was about the postman amen it was always about what was the lord telling us through that ministry and what he was telling to me through that ministry was in this book now don't argue with me about the mailman is the message he delivered the scriptures or not is it true that we live in ladies is it true the moral corruption of the our society has decayed almost to an unreckonable state because he's talking about a way of a true prophet he's paragraph 1v2 he condemned immoral act of the churches these bunkel parties and all these things that they're having card parties soup suppers he'd condemn every one of them he blast them to hell where they come from now i'm talking about something that's looking back he's seen the blessings of people that's supposed to be blessed of people that's supposed to be living above the world okay looking at people how are people act in those blessings and instead of taking those blessings taking the scriptures they're now participating in an ungodly society and losing the very joy of their salvation the very peace of god all kinds of things are starting to flood into their ranks they're allowing women preachers they've got all kinds of hokey oils and and gimmicks they care more about how they dance and shout then they do the word of god let's don't forget the message i think that's a distraction that the enemy wants to get us caught in come to the trial let's argue the evidence and forget the message get forget what's being said what a trick and i think it's so important so amos looks out over adam he sees what how they're starting to live they see they don't pray no more they don't fast no more they don't purge themselves anymore i think people really starting to believe in purgatory yeah someplace later that god will purge them no you purge yourself now you dedicate your lives now you you put this book to your bosom okay and you read when paul says it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair or wear a garment or could be be not braiding hair and me and painted faces and and and adorned with jewelry and all these things they read it they read the scripture and they take all of the word of god i can i didn't even count the number of the times the the word of god said back to the scriptures back to the bible this is what it says and you're watching people with taking every other kind of stuff i know people went overboard with our messenger i think they're still closer to the truth than some people that just take it so lukewarm and okay and yes there was such a presence of of god in that man's life testified by people who don't even accept his doctrine and i can see somebody saying that was god it was god without the man himself being god he was a vessel in which god veiled himself in and it's a very fine line but you can't let perversion mar your judgment so if it because the vindication is in the word itself that's where the vindication lies people can argue the facts but the truth of the word of god that was in the message the message was this word brought back to us so job looks at the condition and he says the very god you serve is going to destroy you now here's ladies they're blind miserable they increase with goods he's looking at the church he's looking at the condition he's seeing the women he's seeing the deacon starting to smoke outside he's seen the pastors living the way they live he sees the choir all caught up in all kinds of things he sees different married people here different married people there he sees the the the uh uh women starting to take control of the church and be in the pulpit the bible says i suffer a woman not to preach nor to serve authority over men that's the word period that was the message no just because the fact that they don't want it doesn't mean it's not a message from god the message was the scriptures brought to the people so amos says the very god you you service going to destroy you and if i pick up here in paragraph 246 he says and brother brahm you mean god is going to destroy this yes every one of them how you know amos how did you know it's just like a doctor diagnosing a case when he finds the disease that's on the patient he knows what to do he knows what the patient has got and he knows how it how far it's advanced and he knows what's going to happen that's the way with a prophet a true prophet when he sees i don't care what you're doing when he sees sin advancing it's an eating cancer and it's in such an advance in the pentecostals and the rest of them it can't come back that's all an advanced stage it's going to perish how do you know what's going to happen i've seen people leave the message first thing they'll take off their skirts usually the first thing is their little pumps start coming up a little higher i don't know how high's high a real man of god he's just not going to want his wife put in such a position but that's where it sneaks in first you know way down at the foundation you know they they get that slipped in you know and then i don't know maybe a little polish and comes in a little bit you know and then a few more necklaces and then maybe a few more wristbands and you know see but the decay has started how do you know how do you know that's the way they're going to go how do you know that's the way of the world because that's the way of the spirit of the world that's the way of people that don't have the word of god to anchor when you cut the anchor to the word of god and start selecting the scriptures that you want to pilot your life the true message is the word and all the word because then you just start to drift slowly you no longer have your anchor to the word of god what happens you don't have an absolute you can't you can't pretty soon you've disagreed with the mailman so much that you won't read the letter you got from god then you start writing your own letter to yourself now if i wasn't doing something i'd get a letter from leslie she said first thing you say are you taking care of yourself are you eating and i know that now you wouldn't know that but i'll go forever without eating nine times when i get eat because have you eaten you don't want to work for me because i don't believe in stopping for lunch she'll call me up and say do you feed them have you fed them guys yet have you gone to lunch have you have you you done that because and that's what pretty soon you start doing you don't hear the gospel that cries out against bob haired women shorts high heels makeup rock and roll music this christian rock and roll music that crept into the church that you throw a couple of christian words on a satanic beat and it's accepted they don't they don't believe the message so now they've cut themselves off so they're not even going to receive anything that the mailman brings because they don't believe that he's really the mailman on their route he's not really the guy that's got the job of delivering the letter so they start throwing the letter go they got the disease and the disease has the rejection of god's word and when you reject god's word you will perish with the spirit of the world just like i said you can't help yourself from being a believer they can't help themselves from the spirit of the world if he who is in you is not greater than he who is in the world if you reject the word you don't have him in you to overcome the world and you will grow worldly it'll creep in might take a year might take two years people that'll lift this message now sit in denominational churches where they preach trinity doctrine for the church members have earrings on and lipstick on and and i gotta try to make sure that i i could say a lot of other things stuff they wear to church did they wear shorts to church and that's where they're at blind poor wretched and naked amos knew what it was paragraph 284 that's how amos got diagnosed the case he diagnosed it by the word of god that's how a true prophet diagnoses the case and says to them women don't you never try to go to the judgment with bob care when you know better say to the men the rest of you and you preachers denying the word in having a form of godliness and joining an organization to dodge the issue when you know better you look at the same word the true prophet would look at you look at the same word a true prophet would look at it's all a prophet does he looks to the word he sees what the word says he looks out he sees the disease he takes the word and applies it to the disease because he knows if they don't take the medicine the disease will destroy them you look at the same word the true prophet would look at the diagnosis of the case death separation just like a doctor who knows the case he knows what kinds of symptoms it's got and i think i'll just lay rest here listen for the message don't get caught up in an argument and forget to read the letter examine yourselves by the word of god look at the choice and the scribes and the pharisees thought jesus was beelzebub you know but there's a people that the letter was written to and you say brother david do you know who those people are known i don't and i'm going to treat every person that i meet anywhere in any condition according to the way the word of god says that i could confront them lay for yourself a pattern of good works that's the scripture when you're criticized turn the other cheek that's the scriptures live the scriptures and you'll be living the message because the message was back to the scriptures back to the scriptures and all that we've seen the cursing and the failing and the destruction it's all been told us it was diagnosed to us what happens when you don't take the word so i say that the jury when all the evidence is presented when each side has given all the miracles and all the vindication and all the testimonies and all those things the other side points out well we didn't get the math to add up here and and you know however god chooses to hide it from the wise and prudent remember he hides it from the wise and prudent i don't know what method he uses but when it's all said and done you're never going to come up with anything else than a hung jury so my advice to you forget the trial forget it it's got a hung jury when it's all said and done they're going to be right back where they started the unbeliever the make believer and the believer because that's the jury pool you understand that that's where they select the jury from the jury pool the very trial came from the jury pool exactly i went to a jury pool and i came up with this this trial yes well you know you forget in the trial you're going to hear the other side you know i already read the trial and i already saw who the witnesses were skeptic to make believer doubter mr impatient i've already seen the trial but i know who the attorney is it's none other than the lord jesus christ and i know who the judge is it's none other than my attorney [Music] so the verdict's in for me that trial is a hung trial my trial was at calvary when all my sins were presented and there was a price paid for him when my fine was paid and my debt was paid and he imparted to me his spirit that would cause me to forgive that would cause me to go the extra mile that would cause me to lay a pattern of good's work it's back to the foundation and the evidence of christianity is the baptism of the holy spirit giving you the power to live the scriptures my advice read the message not just the books not just the stories not just the miracles no not just listening to all the testimonies and everything but there is a personal message to you in god's word amen and he sent somebody to point you to this this will get you there the message if you read it and you see what the messenger said you will find over and over and over and over and over and over and over again back to the word this is what it said these are the truths that we are in foundly built upon is the scriptural revelation of jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever my advice i looked at the trial i saw the evidence i saw the jury pool i thought we're right back where we were in the garden believers make believers and unbelievers and when you have that time of a jury pull you get a hung jury so don't let the jury determine your fate let the pardon determine your fate the jury said you're guilty the king of kings sent a message and said you're pardoned amen it doesn't matter the evidence now because i received the pardon have you received the letter have you received the message from the throne have you received the invitation to open the door and have him come in and sup with you and you with him let's don't miss the message because of the argument just just what i wanted to share with you this morning so god richly bless you the musicians will come we have communion tonight and foot washing maybe some of you that are a home and afraid there's plenty of room to be six feet apart from somebody here today i i guess we don't have to worry i guess heaven's not going to be too crowded but i don't want to be six feet from everybody over there i'm gonna wrap my arms around and get real close to them so the lord protects you we haven't seemed to have anybody else that have much sickness at this time we have other we have other uh people that have other medical situations but we're praying for them and and god is mighty to uh deliver them those those that we're still praying for but that's what the word of god is remember the purpose of this message was to return us back to the faith of our fathers living by faith you could come to and let's stand together this morning [Music] [Music] in your heart this morning [Music] just maybe we could take a moment and examine ourselves and just ask ourselves have i got caught up in all the noise and all the voices as our brother mike so beautifully bought brought in his exhortation this morning have i been distracted to a lot of other things and a lot of other concerns and not sat down and had taken the time [Music] to receive the letter that's been sent to my heart and my soul how i sat down to look at the condition of the world around me and the effect that it's having on my spiritual life on the power that i possess and the ability to fend off temptation am i strong in the lord [Music] am i built up in the statue of a perfect man have i put on the full armor of god am i consecrated into the scriptures into the word of god lord it will never fit in this world because i don't fit in this world we're in this world but we're not of this world lord may the power of the resurrection and the return of your spirit upon the church be our portion father in the humble way this morning too refocus on what the important things are [Music] the living presence of a living god and i ask is each head spout in each heart's bowed each person in this building reflects upon [Music] their own individual life if there's one with my hand raised that might realize that they need a more consecrated life to the scriptures [Music] they need an ear to hear what the spirit says [Music] let him that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church and they'd like to lift their hands and say lord i want to start hearing what it is you were saying lord i don't want to get caught up in the argument i want to hear you and be close to you and my hands are lifted this morning that you will make me a shining light a real christian a real word living spirit-filled holy ghost christian that's my desire lord and i just lift it to you that we might be about our father's business we just ask you to guide us in all truth and righteousness in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen i think we can sing this amen oh i know the time is near everything that i hold here [Music] and every prayer [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] every day [Music] me [Music] free yes [Music] and hear him say well done [Music] well done [Music] amen before we dismiss is there anyone here this morning that is in need of prayer we won't necessarily ask you to come up but if you have a special need and you just like to lift your hand and say i need a touch of my body i i need a touch in my situation and you want to present it to the lord this morning and say lord that's what we saw in this day is [Music] a letter from you that would return our faith back to the faith of the fathers lord and i've lived it and i've believed it and i've done my best to follow your word and your scripture says that if you have a need or a care to cast it upon him for he careth for you father we're bringing these requests and these petitions to you this morning some for healing father some that the doctors diagnosed the different conditions and they have big fancy names for it and they've got tons of treatment but we lord we know that all sickness is because of the garden [Music] and it's because of sin its origin is the devil and we know that all healing comes from calvary and lord we ask today that you meet the faith of each of these people that have put their requests up may they place that request in your hands this morning and may they see your love and your grace and your mercy move on their behalf [Music] father that they can deepen their side they know that they've met you and that you've heard their prayer and that you've touched them according to your will we believe it father because we believe you're alive the same yesterday today and forever we believe that your word is never changed and our hearts desire this morning is to live by that word and father healing is a part of that word and we accept that part of your gospel this morning deliverance is part of your gospel and we accept that part of your gospel this morning in your precious and holy name we pray amen god bless you don't forget communion tonight if you're listening at home communion tonight god bless you [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
