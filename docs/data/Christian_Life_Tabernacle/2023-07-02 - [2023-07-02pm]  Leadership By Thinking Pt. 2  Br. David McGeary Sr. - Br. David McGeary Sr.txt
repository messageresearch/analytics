amen amen let's read our scriptures again that we read this morning found there in the book of Ephesians and I just want to read this little scripture once again that it says in the 21st and 26th and 27th verse the fifth chapter of Ephesians says husband loves your wives even if Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated tonight it certainly wonderful to see that a few people have a filter and so we certainly ask all those that didn't come back to the house of the Lord what thinking kept them out and and that's what we're talking about and when we talk about you having to having to address the thought process and at that and um a lot of times I don't think people even realize the thought process is taking place they don't it it it's so uh in our subconscious that it just happens with uh without an awareness and so can you imagine if your subconscious is is directing you and you're not even aware of it then how important would it be to get control of that to grasp and understand that there's something that's taking place in Me by Nature that the way that I'm built that I'm thinking these thoughts and and not ever uh really realizing if if you've ever had a problem with temper or anger or frustration uh anybody that's ever had I'm sure none of you have but you know I have had it I have a God's helping me but real bad you know and uh yeah it's a build up you know what I mean your mind gets to racing and you're You're Building all this frustration up and all these thoughts are feeling uh uh something that's that's transpiring in you and all of a sudden you have all these feelings and all these emotions they've risen to the surface and you're you're you're you're just gonna be blowing off steam you know what I mean and then you'll say something or do something and and you you don't even realize how did I get to this place you know how did I get here well you know it's it it's that that subconscious thoughts you know uh when my brother was uh my older brother when he finally in his life he was an alcoholic and and with alcoholics they they'd say that you'll you'll never start to change till you finally hit a a rock bottom place where you realize you can't go on other than that you'll always make an excuse you'll always have a reason you'll always think of of something uh to do and and I used to go to meetings with them to the AAA meetings with them and and you know I'm not against a a it's it's not a substitute for the Lord and and I I believe that's the greatest cure for alcoholism there is is is being born again but if it it's a whole process of them trying to learn to control the way they think because they're always looking for a reason to drink you know and so they develop methods of thinking that allow them to justify what they're doing regardless of the harm that it's causing them and we do that a lot with sin you know most sin is Justified because of the result that it provides us you know that's uh you know laziness is a sin you know the scripture says to do those then to know to do good and not to do it to them it is sin so there had to be a process by which that they reasoned and they thought and they they drew a conclusion that this is okay this is okay and like I said uh they people one of the things that they would talk about is that how that you can't let other people when other people disappoint you or let you down or discourage you that you can't use other people's failures as your excuse you know and so I thought that was pretty amazing because it brings us back to the fact that we have got to eat our bread with singleness of heart working out our own salvation with fear and trembling in other words if everybody's go walking off the cliff that doesn't mean that walking off the cliff is good and it doesn't mean the results of walking off a cliff are going to change because more people do it you know and and you know when we've always been in the church trying to fight the Modern Trend that was one of the things that was a great theme of the message of the hour that the prophet of God taught us he said you want to watch this modernism modern day religion modern Trends modern music modern approach to sin a new ethics code a new moral code and you know I I I sit here tonight and uh you know uh a man told me one time I said well why don't you guys have uh evening service but he said not very many people can get back to evening service and so you filter that okay but that's not what the word of God did the word of God says where if one or two can gather together he would be there so if only three of us wanted to be here then would it be worth having service you know now we could reason we got to run the bills we've got to run the air conditioner you know it it okay you don't have the seats aren't full the Imp the atmosphere feels you know kind of skimpy and it feels like it'd be better if it was more packed out I like that feeling better you know when there's just a few of us there and he preaches three kinds of Believers I know that I'm I you know I know I'm gonna I'm one of them you know what I mean and you can you can come up with a mass of of of ideas floating through your head and one of the things I really wanted to just talk a little bit about because even is that that you can't stop that from happening and I touched on it this morning that's the battle he's always pushing the reasoning in there he doesn't stop it's non-stop mind game mind battle it's non-stop it's non-stop he just never quits you know because okay have you ever woke up and oh I used to go through it every morning to go to work I used to filter every excuse that I could come up with not to get out of bed you know and and you just go through it you go through the mind that it might be for you guys you just love to pop up and go to work you know but I'll tell you I don't even the covers only feel good to me about you know seven o'clock in the morning and you know and that's when you get most of your sleep that's when you dream most of your dreams it is right at that time and you want to cling to that but something's got to push you to get out and then you go through the thought process but I I wish I had the ability to make you aware of the thought process and I think this is part of what the messengers trying to get to the church and was trying to get to the church is that this thoughts process is going on in these influences are coming to them and they've got to understand in order to climb into that Capstone they they're going to have to deal with it you just got to deal with it you're not free from dealing with it and and if if not you you'll end up creating your own uh your your whole own ideology you know and uh you know I I I just found out here the other day as many of you've known I didn't know if I shared this with the church or not but I will at this time while I was in California uh a a woman I guess a homeless person or a maybe she was homeless by choice she may have had a good family that uh uh may have got tired of the way that she was living but she decided to uh she was by a parked car and she decided to get down and crawl out in the road and lay down in the middle of the road right in front of my car and I ran over and uh and you know it was very traumatic experience for my family my granddaughter my mom and everything and it was pretty obvious to us that she was probably trying to commit to suicide and um and you know I mean I had things that I was supposed to do but it kind of rattled me because I wanted to have the right attitude towards it and the right thinking and and all those things and and have compassion for her and and everything well I just found out the other day that she's suing me and I just thought well what is she suing me for I mean I didn't complete the job that she wanted me to complete or or what you know what I mean but okay there's nothing in the world I could have done you understand if someone wants to lay down out in front of your car when you're driving by there's nothing you can do the street was dark you know it was a no situation was available to me to do anything other than what I've done but you've got an attorney now and they're going to sue and they're going to try to collect and you begin to sit back that you realize that the the society has developed a whole complete different way of thinking and the scripture says that if you no longer wish to retain God in your knowledge he gives you over to a reprobate mind and if you could ever get that across the young people and young teenagers when you start taking God out of your thinking that what there's there's only one other type of thinking that's available and that thinking is reprobated it's perverted because that's what sin is and that's what truth is Right a lie is it's truth perverted so you're going to get some form of perversion and when you build upon perversion perversion uh brings forth more perversion if it produces it it just keeps going and and it goes It goes uh it goes so far uh it gets so far out there the thinking does that it's it's lost all kinds of forms of Truth and then so you you've got to understand that there's a tide today there's a whole a whole thing a person they can they get themselves into a spot where they they think a certain thing about themselves or they they think a certain interpretation of the scriptures and and they they don't run it from Genesis to to Revelations they don't take all of it they just take a few parts of it and and they don't filter it then they're gonna build something on that and it's going to build into something and it's difficult it's difficult well he's not looking for he wants a bride that doesn't have any wrinkles or and he's not trying to tell us to get out ponds or you know Neutrogena that's not the kind of wrinkles he's worried about he'd rather see those kind of wrinkles you know wrinkles of experience wrinkles of prayer but it's it's these little bends these little tweaks in the word of God this little mixing with humanism that that he's trying to to to get out of the church and so now he's gathered a group of people together and he's going to supply them a filter now we know what a filter does how many halves of water filters a lot of your refrigerators come with water filters you can buy counter filters water filters water softeners water fills it's to change the taste of the water and how do they does a filter work it allows certain things through and certain things it keeps out so you by the by changing the filter you can change the outcome of what comes out on the other side that we we had a brother that uh uh in fact it's it's uh brother Mike Park's brother-in-law he worked for a gravel company and they could a company that made filters filter screens and by designing these screens they could crush Rock and and separate it into all kinds of different sizes and weights and everything just by how that it transferred through the filter so what's in important about the filter is the filter allows what comes through so you can't get the product until it goes through the filter if you understand I'm saying so the product is a a bride without spot or wrinkle that's the Prada but the only way that you can get the wrinkle out is to put it through the filter the only way you can get the blemish out is to put it to the filter you can't sit back and say oh I I believe I shouldn't have any blemishes that that's that's sitting back and looking with the pair of binoculars instead of looking at the mirror so the filter was given because everything has to go through it because everybody was dirty so you can't avoid going through the filter you've got to look at yourself and you've got to understand and you've got to look at the word of God and you've got to look at yourself and say in order to come up with the product that God wants or in order for me to get the the rapture which is the ultimate yes I don't want to be saved by fire in order to get the outcome I have got to go through this filter no I can't sit there and say that's god's filter that's God's word hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah I'm so glad glory to God that I've got the filter Hallelujah and that the spirit of God moves on me praise a God and one day we're going to walk in the mighty faith of the revelation of the word of God do you hear me charge are you ready to march in the name of Jesus and overcome Satan Hallelujah do you feel it brother oh I found out a long time ago that ain't preaching if I believe that would preach and not have me an organ player that know how to make this place Rock that ain't it has never been it it's when you have to take what you believe what you've been taught What You've Been Told and you as an individual say I've got to take me through that filter to me because if I don't go through it there's no way I can be cleansed let me just read a few statements today and he said and if I've got one desire in my heart and I hope that everybody listening to me has the same thing God take me through your filter as David said try me and prove me and seek if there be any evil in me then take it out Lord see I want God's filter I don't care what the world does what the church has now that's a great statement I don't care what the church has I don't care whether it has a gymnasium I don't care whether it's got the best music I don't care whether it's got the most intellectual intelligent uh Ministry I don't care what the church has because it takes pressing it down to the election it's going to press it down to what's inside of you you know and and if you're different that difference is going to be pressed to the surface we used to do this little thing in in we would take a a few Marbles and we'd put them in a bottom of a a big jar and I don't know if we put like wheat or corn or something in the jar and we would say you notice these marbles are different and and you know this was motivational training and uh I've seen motivational training I used to teach it I had I had four or five people who were in the Baseball Hall of Fame making millions of dollars a year standing on a chair in a room of people screaming at the top of their lungs get rich get rich because they were stirred up they were motivated and I thought I'm sitting there hardly making a nickel these guys are multi-millionaires and I thought what are these guys they don't want to get rich what are what are they doing they love the hype they just feed on the motivation they're they're competitors they like the motivation they they they they love that feeling that that stuff you know and it can you know here's a guy that's known for one of the greatest curveballs ever thrown in baseball going good Rich get rich I'm thinking give me the curveball give me the curveball you know it so it dawned on me so these the it's the psychic it's the motivation it's the emotion it's the the being drummed up in everything but that so he doesn't care what it has never never thought it out they're not gonna go door to door and and and sell uh engine oil or or you know soap they would never do that but boy the hype they they fed on it so now he's pointing something out there he says I don't care what the church has I want to be a thinking man now ask yourself am I a thinking person and I realize I do a lot of things without thinking and have you ever heard the expression what were you thinking what in the world were you thinking what made you think you could do this you know maybe your parents have told that to you what makes you think you're not going to get caught what makes you think what what brought that on what what were you thinking and so he's saying here I want to be a a I want to be a thinking man to think who I'm going to be standing by one of these days for judgment so what we've got to understand that so it's like the word of the Lord is coming says okay Church you've matured enough you know the doctrine now it's time for you to become thinking people you can't go no longer just taking things as they happen or as they come you've got to take control a real Son of God takes control of every circumstance he walks in a world a Mystic to himself he takes control of every circumstance so it's no more whatever comes comes whatever goes goes I'll just deal with it I can just I don't like somebody I just don't like them I just think that way if if I want to cut somebody off or find her I don't want to listen to somebody I just shut them out all that stuff is is bye bye now okay you're you're no longer free thinkers you no longer have the right to think what you want you are now called to become prisoners and to to take the filter and the responsibility of the filter and we know this he said oh yes the word of God is a thinking man's filter anyone knows that that's what your soul is filtered through the word of God and it and it makes when you come through God when a thinking man comes through God's filter it gives him a holy man's taste that's right when you come through God's filter then your tasty is a holy man's taste it makes a righteous man's taste the slogan was certainly right and we know the slogan came when brother Brennan picked up that cigarette pack it it I think it said it said a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste and he thought what a deception they can't filter out the cancer but they're trying to deceive the a person and just to throw it out to you is that they've just finally released a study that they've had for years and years and years about the negative effect of it's I want to say aspirin but it's it's it's that sweetener ask for Keen or whatever it's one of the most deadly things to sense corn syrup you all eat a lot of corns forever and we drink diet drinks and they they absolutely now realize that it's has a terrible effect on on development well who in the who's been telling us for a long time about hybrid fur Foods turning everybody into mush good you know what I mean I mean it's just it's just that real but so we he said we know that and it produces that Holy man's taste so when he saw that package at a thinking man's filter a holy man's taste and then the Lord started dealing with them that the church is not filtering and so this is what he says he says this is paragraph 87 notice but the woman who wants to have short hair and wear shorts or wear paint and things she can go right through Pentecostal filter just as easy as pie nothing about it right into death because she says well there's no harm in that if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in you she said down through this Spirit now you've got to realize that that's that's her nature right so let me read this this quote first he says he says this is 74. notice now women they want to have bobbed hair okay and I would think that's natural because long hair is a lot of work it's hot you know your hair grows long so the easiest thing to do is just cut it off that's why a lot of older women they get to the place they don't want to worry about going to the having their hair done they're just a big truck so they just chop it off what difference does it make right God loves me it's kind of they want it she said and they want to have bobbed hair they want to wear shorts paint makeup right oh there's a little spot you know and then the pretty soon they got Foundation and then the foundation they got toned and after tone they got some Scara and then they put some lip stuff on you know what I mean and pretty soon you you say who's this you know you wonder what what you know you wonder if they ever peeled off that onion what they'd really look like you know I I I tell any man this is just straightforward Miracle advice before you marry a woman you see her fresh with her face fresh washed because what she's presenting you may not be real good I just thought I'd throw that in there for just a little bit of spiritual uh advice here this today you know what I mean because you know deception is an amazing thing it's like one of those paintings you know that's got the hidden picture you know if you don't look real close you might not get the real picture so you want to make sure you see what's really under there and so she wants Bob air they want to wear shorts paint makeup these little bikinis and things that they wear nowadays they want to do it and yet they want to go to church you see that anointing upon the spirit upon the soul that's that anointing is on them they want to go to church she she wants to be a Christian and also do those things and the pastor says it's okay then if he says it's okay you can be a member your name can be on my church book here it's okay then he's giving her his denominational filter to suit a worldly woman's taste so you can find a filter to match your taste okay so she loves the world she likes the taste of it so he's got a filter for her but she's a long way from being a thinking woman but there you are that's where I found this text no she isn't a thinking woman if she was a thinking she would know the church isn't going to judge her at the last day the church is judging her now by her membership her loyalty to the circles that she belongs to and to society they are judging her now by that that's scary I don't know if it's you but that's scary but if she was thinking but God is going to judge her at the last day so she isn't thinking he's going to judge her by her word but she thinks she's okay because her church is judging her now we're a member of this group we are loyal uh we're part of the programs we we we do all these uh things and so you're all being judged now but you're being judged by the people that don't matter I mean that's it's absolutely phenomenal really what he's bringing forth here out of the word of God he's saying he just comes right out and says that you're being judged now and according to them you're all okay but you're not thinking that's not the filter you've got to go through to get there the filter you've got to go through is that little gap between the Capstone because that Capstone is the tip of the rocket that's the pod that's what's going off that's the capsule that's the spaceship that's going out of here and that spirit that sits there is the word of God the filter that's only going to allow those who go through that filter into that pod into that Capsule that's going to launch in the rapture reality what it is you can't change it she's not a thinking she isn't thinking and then he says he's talking again he says notice but the woman who wants to have short hair and wear shorts and wear paint or anything she can go right through a Pentecostal filter just exactly as easy as pie nothing about it right into death because she says well there's no harm to that if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God is not even in you now down through this Spirit then she can pull down into her soul things that isn't of God and against God's word if that's the taste in her soul so if the taste in your soul is for things of the world then you can pull things into your soul that isn't even of God you that through that spirit that anointing remember she wants to be a serve God that's an anointing and through that annoying and through that desire and through that idea of wanting to be good and wanting to serve God she can pull things down into her soul that is contrary to the word of God and feel religious now what a stark warning from the church age messenger and the prophet of this age to keep us from the greatest deception that there ever was is Satan appearing as an angel of Light that it would be so close in the last days it would deceive the very elect if possible it can actually pull things into their Spirit by the anointing that's contrary to the word yeah you've got to filter the anointing you do because there's only one thing that God recognizes is what he said every word of God is true every word of man is a lie and Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away he says and it can come through he said and it can come through the taste it can come through the thinking through the reasoning there's no harm in it I have taste I have feelings I have a feeling that this is all right she can come right on down through that right into her soul if her soul is of that type it shows that she isn't drawing through God's filter very simple we know that God's word is the thinking man's filter and then we just want to I this one up close in this because I I just think that what that if we could get to the Great understanding that we have no choice we've been on the Journey of life we've come up through seven Church ages we've come up building through the statue of a perfect man we've worked to have Temperance and patience we've worked on all these virtues we've we've worked on on godliness and goodness we've worked on all these things through seven Church ages we've been working on our flesh we've been trying to become more christ-like we've been coming all this journey that we've taken as Christians to be real Christians and to keep the word of God and now we finally path finally leads us and it leads us to this one great thing before we can enter in to that place we need to be to leave and it's this filter because go read statue of perfect man go read what he talks about the Holy Spirit go read what he talks about the holy of holies he says the spirit is there to meet you to find out if there's anything there that can't enter in so what else if you enter in there and you've got something that ain't right what happens you get tossed out how many people in their Christian Journey have tried to enter into that Perfection and they keep getting tossed out and they don't know why they don't know why they find themselves back at the that same place because you can't bypass the filter you can't bypass the wedding gown you can't bypass being made and and brought into subjection to the word you can't bypass that step just like the people that stayed home tonight I hope you're listening but let me tell you streaming ain't gonna get you there now if you have to stream because of health or you have to stream because of finances that's one thing but if you're streaming for a substitute that doesn't filter through God's word God's word says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together streaming is a deception of the devil and I just might do away with it it's poisoned the church we might as well do away with local assemblies we are we ought to do away with the ministry of the pastor feeding the sheep that God's given them because now we've got a universal church one Holy Catholic Apostolic Universal message we do I'm sorry I'm not preaching against people it's just unbelief we don't filter it the scripture says that were a body fitted and joined together each one supplying the need of the other what's I I thought what Brother Gary share with me is beautiful he said what is foot washing it's where you bear the burden of the person's feet that you're watching you're humbling yourself you're exalting them you're lifting them up you're saying I'm here to serve you I'm here for you I'm here to wash your feet put that out the window the church hardly does it anymore see the the we think we're in better shape than we really are because we can't stand back and look at ourselves because the we've we've taken the word of God to be binoculars we're looking out to see what we can see in other words we take the word of God can we see a worldly can we see denominations can we see the political trend of the day can we see the days of Noah can you see this can you see that and in one sense it is a binocular but until it becomes a mirror it has no effect on you and you don't change and I don't want to be in the same spiritual mind actions and have no growth or no developer no increase in love and power after 50 years of being a Christian I want to enter that Capstone and I've got to bring myself to the realization that I have got to go through that filter I have got to get my thinking and put it through that filter I don't have an option just because I say I'm elect just because I say I'm chosen just because I'm saying that well what have I been chosen to I've been chosen to be one of those that goes through the filter I want to be filtered try me prove me O Lord that's what he said he said he says what can I say you can't say that Bob haired woman for a woman is of god you can't say that Bob the hair woman for a woman is of God the Bible said it's not so it's the filter of the world and if you love the world one Speck of the world the love of God isn't even in you see what's that well what's drawing it is something down on the inside drawing the soul is drawing your resources through drawing the resources through the outside down through the spirit into the soul and if the soul loves the world it's dead I don't care how anointed it is out here and how righteous it is out here down here it's dead for he that loveth the world are the things of the world the love of God is not even in them no matter how religious it doesn't matter the drawing of it isn't it isn't good they draw all they draw all these things but they keep filtering out the word oh my God you know every he said each one of them has to go go through that great process he says look he says they like Esau outwardly okay Esau is religious on the outside and when it comes to religion it seemed to be more religious than Jacob was he seemed to be a better man than Jacob was but on the inside of him what he but on the inside of him what he was he was outwardly religious but his thinking was not filtered that's paragraph 116 but his thinking was not filtered so what do you think God's judging you by he's judging you by how you're filtering you're thinking this is a new Step Church you understand you know it's it's like okay you've been to class now it's time to put everything that you said be not hearers of a word but be doers of the word it is a brand new twist if I can say it that I don't have words to say what I want to say he says but his thinking was not filtered he didn't think right of the birthright he didn't think that God the birthright meant as much as God said it did he was there he was said I'm hungry what difference it makes about the old Birthright you can have it if you want it oh my I go to church I'm just as good as you are my denomination why it's one of the greatest in the world my mother belonged to it my father belonged to it all this that and the other my pastor was educated he's got so and so that puts him that much farther away from God it ain't a thinking man's filter and we could just go on but Esau failed to filter and so that's what our our our just our thought today that we want to finally bring it down you've got something in you that's drawing we've put a lot of emphasis on the seed haven't we and the word going to the seed but there's a lot of other things that mix in with it when it comes Satan appears as an angel of Light Satan is mixing his gospel he's always there to add a little something to put a little something in to to sneak in there and add to and take away so it behooves us now more than ever to recognize that I've got to stand up and with everything that's going on I've got to get steadfast in my heart the filter and may I just say in my own personal belief I believe that this is God's ultimate filter this filter worked in the days of Moses in the Old Testament when Jesus came it worked in the first church and it worked for Seven Ages but in this last stage there was another horse rider went out and he was a pale horse rider he was a mix of all the colors of all the deceptions of all the false doctrines he appears as an angel of Light he comes in the greatest deception that he's ever come we know that where histories are we know that Israel is in the Homeland we know we're in the days of Noah we know that we're in the Sodom condition all those things have come down and now there's a deception that's out there that's greater than there's ever been never there's been an age that men have made claims many men make claims to be Messengers Messengers to hear Messengers to their the eighth messenger the anointed one of Christ in the last day how many knows that that's promised in this day many will come many false anointed ones but God has given the filter to filter it all by he opened the seven seal filter to the church that now they can filter everything that said no matter how religious it is they can filter it through the word of God and you'll never get the result by bypassing the filter everything that's of God comes through the filter on this side he still loves you he still saves you but then when he takes you through the filter you're refined and he removes certain things from you and then you you're there for a while but then he brings you back and puts you through this filter and this filter and he's going to filter you right into the Capstone and one of these days the capstone's taken off excuse my analogy but it really makes me feel good because I so want to leave this world anyway God bless you we'll have communion a billy why don't you come and read the communion scriptures uh for us this evening and and I just hope that in my heart that you recognize the next time that you're pondering and thinking that you can actually stop yourself and say oh I'm thinking right now my mind's working you know like when you lay in bed and you try to go to sleep and your mind's working you say oh my mind's working in you're the day when you're living in your thing and that you catch the thoughts that are coming into you and you'll realize you know what there's a lot of things pressing in on me I better get my filter out and make sure none of that stuff gets into my heart and into my spirit and I think if I do that I'm going to find myself being a much more powerful Christian a much more word Christian and I'll have more of the nature of the Lord because let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and I think that's all of our goal isn't it to be without spotter without wrinkle so God bless you I hope you enjoyed the word today I recommend that you listen and you study uh all of the message but maybe if you get a chance just take a look at think amen's Filter Hey Lord richly bless you hey man let's talk stand this brothers are bringing let's read in First Corinthians chapter 11 we'll start from the 23rd verse says for I have received of the Lord that which I have delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he breaks it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do do this this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he also took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till I till he comes wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworldly shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of this cup for he that eateth and drink it unworldly eat it and drink it damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many a weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we will judge ourselves we shouldn't be we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore by Brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's pray for the bread and then you may be seated our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have before us this bread that represents Lord your body which is the body word that the bride feeds on now in this day Lord It's the sacrifice broken that your spirit was sent forth on a many-membered body father and we remember the great price that you paid at Calvary that you could reveal the father to us and where we were with him in eternity father and and we're so grateful for that Lord we've been praying today and as we listened in and read from the message of a thinking man's filter Lord the prophet of the hour imploring us with all of his spirit and heart to make sure that we have this filter father even communion as it's presented in Corinthians it presented as a filter let every man examine himself then let him eat at that bread whatever you do don't eat unworthily father what a wonderful example of filtering our thoughts in our hearts before we partake father filtering is a part of the very process that you've developed that everything would come through your word for everything that came from your word to return back to the word has to go through the word we ask that this communion would be that for us this evening bless this bread father bless this wine which is the life father the stimulation of the spirit the great call of God that draws us through the filter the hunger that draws us to your word and through your word that the life that was in Christ may be the life that's in us that's our hearts desire we ask you to bless this to us this evening in Jesus name we pray amen the musicians we come thank you
