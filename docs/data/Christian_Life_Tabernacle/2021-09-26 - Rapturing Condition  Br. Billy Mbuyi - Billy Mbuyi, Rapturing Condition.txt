[Music] hmm [Music] [Music] amen god bless you this morning i'm happy to be in the house of the lord david could say i was glad when he said unto me let's go into the house of the lord amen because this is where we bring all our needs all our problems he's the one who wants us our prayers amen let's stand as we open our service with this song [Music] jesus [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] he calls me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] their troubles oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] every week [Music] pray me [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] with a word of prayer [Music] [Music] just go ahead and pray this morning father we're always so grateful for every opportunity we have to be gathered together lord to fellowship one with another lords to lift up your name in worship lord but more importantly lord that we would give preeminence to your word lord that you'd come by our way and make yourself known to us lord for without your presence this is just another religious gathering lord without you giving witness to your word into speaking the hearts to changing lives it's just another church service father lord we are depending upon you to come by our way to speak to each one to make yourself known to meet every need lord we pray that lord that you take dominion over every spirit that would prevent you from having dominion in this place lord that there would be nothing distracting that there would be no thoughts of the enemy but father that it would be just you and your word from the beginning to the end we commit the service to you we depend upon you and we thank you in jesus name amen [Music] well good morning you're one of the things that you spend any time at all you know among those that are out in the world or listen to the news or there's just this theme of looking for a safe place a safe place to provide my perspective a safe place to work a safe place to go to school this desire to be safe even to the point that we're willing to surrender freedoms for it that we could be safe to search for safety you know there was a time in david's life where he was looking for a place of safety remember the story that he had that victory over goliath and had been raised up to a position in saul's army in his court and then because of his reputation he began to be a threat to saul saul began to be afraid of the fact that the people are you know beginning to praise david and so he set it upon his hearts to destroy the man and so you know the story that david had to run he was looking for a place of safety a place to get away from this king you know it's interesting that the place that he ended up in was gath the city of the philistines the very city that goliath was from why would david go there of all places you know goliath literally stood out in a crowd in his home he was also their champion known for his great battles you know no doubt people knew of the fact that they were humiliated in battle when this david killed their champion and had them running and here he is in their very town let's also not forget the goliath family there were other giants in town that had it out for david david had to deal with later in his life and he was also carrying goliath sword what could go wrong and yet that's the very place that david goes for safety you know clearly at first david was nervous about his choice you know he pretended to be crazy you know the moment people recognized him and brought him before the king but you know ultimately he and his band of men became close allies with achish the king of gath in fact in first samuel 28 akish the king of gath made david and his men part of his personal guard and he fought alongside him in the very battle where the philistines defeated the children of israel and saul was killed you know eventually the men of gath had had enough and you know pressured their king to let him go but for a time david sat strangely in safety in that place where even though all the men of gath wish they could get him alone in the darkness and have their way with him he was under the protection of a king it's a strange surreal situation that when david needed a place of safety he found it in the camp of his enemies where you think he'd be the least safe you know something besides david's own thinking brought him to this place nobody in their right mind will go i got an idea i'm going to go where i just defeated them and hide with them you know there was clearly some other leading going on there and in fact we turned into psalm 56 this morning you know psalm 56 was written during this time when david was finding safety and protection in this unsafe place he says in verse 8 thou tellest all my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book thou tellest all my wanderings the lord was directing his steps he's testifying he's recognizing that you know the steps of the righteous are ordered the lord clearly there was something leading david to this place when he sought a place of safety the lord brought him here beyond any any idea of man you know it didn't look like a safe place but for david it was the safest place in the land in verse 2 of psalm 56 giving you an idea where david's head was at he says mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time i am afraid i will trust in thee in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what man can do unto me and then again it says in verse 11 in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid of what man can do unto me surrounded on every hand by his enemy yet in the safest place in the land you know i was reading that it occurred to me that no matter where the lord has you what circumstance you're in what's going on it is the safest place in the land for you if he's directing your steps the place you find yourself in right now is the safest place in the land in spite of what might be around you you know i'm reminded of daniel and the lion's den surrounded by creatures that should have torn him apart but he was in the safest place he could be in the land safer than his own home safer than in the palace of a king right there in the middle of the lions was the safest place he could be so how was it that david could find safety in a place where there should be none it says in verse 12 thy vows are upon me oh god there was a word that had gone forth concerning david spoken by a prophet that he would be taking up a position that he would be a king he was anointed for that purpose but there was a word god's vow for his word is his vow that had to be fulfilled you know twice in psalm 56 david makes this statement in god i will praise his word you know this isn't talking about raising his hands and saying praise the lord you know with his lips in a worship service or even when he reads or hears the word of the lord god's word is praised when it is fulfilled the fulfillment of the word is the praise thereof and david recognized his part in that in god will i praise his word there will come a time when his word will be fulfilled to his praise and i have a part in that so he could dwell in safety in that dangerous place knowing he was in the safest place in the land you know all along the way every circumstance that he found himself in was part of the fulfilling of that word that had been spoken to him so where else could he be to find better safety than that in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh this physical realm can do unto me you know as with david he directs each and every one of our steps there's a word that's gone forth concerning us you know it's funny we live in an hour where everyone's crying for safety looking for a safe place but if he's directing you no matter what circumstance you're in you're in the safest place in the land so i hope that's a blessing to you but that's what stuck out to me as i was reading this we'll read psalm 56 together starting in verse 1. be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high what time i am afraid i will trust in thee in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me every day they rest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee for thou has delivered my soul from death will not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living amen amen god bless you we may be seated we don't have any song requests but um there's this song on my heart i would like to sing when peace [Music] my way see [Music] me to sing [Music] my soul is [Music] my soul [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh

don't have any prayer requests here or an announcement that means jesus has already taken care of everything but if you have any need in your heart just lift your hands now as we're gonna invite the brothers to take tithe and offerings i'm going to if my brother taught me to pray for these offerings in tithe it's just about our hearts dear lord lord we're just gathering here this morning in your name lord knowing that you're present lord every time we're here lord even when we leave the building lord we know that you're with us lord you're always with us lord lord you're ever present lord lord i just there's so many times that we get down lord or we start looking at the negative lord but as i was reading the word lord i just i caught a little personal thing myself lord that that simple little faith that we have just that brother branham speaks of lord that starts our car or just helps us to get up and walk across the room lord i i realize that same faith is the faith that you've given me to believe in you lord lord we know that each day that we walk through this world lord that without that faith we have nothing lord we just praise you lord knowing that you've given us that lord without that lord we we would be lost like the rest of the world lord lord we so thank you for your love and your mercy on our lives lord none of us would be gathered here today lord if it weren't for you lord lord we just ask that you bless the minister lord and the tithes and offerings lord we thank you for all that you do for us lord in the love you've given us lord we just love and

we sang the songs to lift up your name lord we're so thankful this morning that we can say we know the master lord that we've met him ourselves lord that he's touched our lives and he's done something for us that's why we gathered here lord father we pray that if there be any needs in our midst lord no doubt as we gather lord we always have a desire within our heart father we pray that as the word goes forth that we may receive that which we have need of father because we know that the very things we desire lord is because you place the desire within us lord if it be any natural any desire father we've been told that if we ask according to your word that you shall give it to us father we've been told that if we come and if you've done one thing one way before lord that you are obligated to do it again if we come therefore this morning lord we invite you to be the guest of honor in our midst lord father may you have your preeminence over the service lord and father use our mouth and speak to our heart lord that we may receive from you lord we don't we're not interested to receive from man we're interested to receive from god the words of life father we asked this morning that you remember brother david and i know he's ministering this morning i pray that you just give him strength lord and father bless the service that they may have a wonderful time and father remember brother matthew and brother cosman lord as the ministering father i pray that you just be with them and the word may come in such a way lord that it will touch the heart and change it oh god what a privilege it is to stand before you lord and the bible says in psalm it says bless the lord o my soul and it says forget not all is benefit who forgiveth all thy iniquity and healeth all of that diseases lord we're so thankful that we have a god who can do that be lifted up this morning we commit everything we are to you and ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen so glad to be gathered in the house of god this morning i want to welcome everyone all our visitors who are certainly happy to have you with us amen let's open our bibles in romans the book of romans chapter 8. amen let's start from verse 1. it says there's therefore no there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walketh not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus had made us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh it says god sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for his and for and for sin condemns sin in the flesh it says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilling us who walketh not after the flesh but after the spirit it says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they they are after the spirit the things of the spirit it says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for um for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god it says but you are not in the flesh amen i'm sure glad yeah again i perhaps i'll try to use as a background that's what we heard on wednesday uh you know however david brought it out so beautifully that everything it was by faith it was by faith everything that's accounted to us was by faith it says by e or not in the flesh and is ex explicitly letting us know that we are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwelleth in you it says now if any man have not the spirit of god he is none of his and if the spirit if if if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raiseth uh that raise up christ jesus from the dead dwelleth in you he that raised up that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are not debtors we are we are debtors not to the to the flesh but to live after the we are not debtors to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortified the deed of the body of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye are not have not received the spirit of bondage against again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption where whereby we cry our father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joining with christ if so be be that that we suffer with him that we shall also glorified together amen let's just buy heads our gracious father we thank you for your word we ask that you just multiply the word to our heart this morning we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen man you may be seated but also as you see that let's turn to another scripture here uh in uh first thessalonians chapter four uh let's start from verse 13. um it says but i wouldn't but i would not but i will not have you to be ignorant brother and concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as other which are not which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them which are which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for it says for we we say unto you by the word of the lord that we that they which we alive are remain and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are sleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a void of an archangel and with a trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the cloud to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with with the lord it says therefore comfort one another with these words as we read this morning there was just i guess some of the things that our pastor said on wednesday uh perhaps uh this morning i just want to go in that direction for a little bit and i hope it will be a blessing to you amen like we pray let's remember whether david and brother cosman and uh brother matthew i believe brother paul is traveling back to congo we want to remember him uh this afternoon we may have a bridal from chile he's this morning with brother jesus over there he may minister for us tonight so let's just keep that in prayer that the lord may make a way so as we read in romans we can certainly say that everything a believer obtains or everything about us is in the spirit we realize nothing is in the flesh it's all in the spirit our salvation is in the spirit we're obtained by the spirit our healing we obtain it by the spirit everything anything we try to do in the flesh will not work because the scripture tells us that ye are not in the flesh we've not been given the flesh to operate by but we are being given the spirit in order for us to transform what's happening in the flesh it's it's the it's by the spirit of god that everything happens it's by the spirit of god that the world will form it's by the spirit of god that that we are transformed to what we are today and it's by the same spirit of god that will be will receive our body change now brother david read this quote and i certainly want to go over it before we could just jump into what i have in my heart this is in the rising of the sun paragraph 3 or 7. it says look it says look what we've seen in this day quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals it says what was that the intelligence of a man no quickening power of god see quickening power of god foretold that this will take place now remember that uh sir is this the time he comes and he tells about the event and and what's going to happen he doesn't understand how all is going to transpire and everything and he's talking about all this thing is wondering if it's the end of his life and all those things and here it comes on what is the attraction of the mountain god comes and he makes his word a reality and so we can sit here and say that we have seen those things come to pass it's the quickening power of god being made manifest in this end time it's the quickening we can you know we were talking with the youth and you know some begin to ask a question you know what's the difference between the holy ghost and the quickening power when i got the holy ghost it means do i does it means that i need to wait again and get the quickening power well the quickening power is the holy spirit it's the same thing it's the holy spirit but throughout the ages we have to understand that what has happened is the the the throughout the ages that there was only a measure allotted based on the word that was dispensed in the time so if all they knew was sanctification or justification that's how they walked and the holy spirit came it was the work of the holy spirit to quicken that sanctification to them that justification to them and even the baptism of the holy ghost on pentecost but oh my we've come in such a place where we we're not going right back again at the beginning we're not going right back again to get faith and back up but now the capstone itself has come down now it's the revealing of the entire mystery of what god intended to do from the beginning so therefore the quickening power has come to reveal to you what god called you to be in the first place it's just not in a place where you say well you know you receive enough holy spirit to not do wrong and to not lie and to just try to live a good life that's not what we are about in this generation we've received such quickening power to make the word of god a reality to make god live in other words we've come back to where man once again is being brought in the condition that he was in the garden of eden where he can manifest god in his flesh where he can bring and come to a place where god's mind is his mind he can come back to a place where god can look at him and he can say something and god honors it we come back to a place where the fullness of what god uh prophesy what he says in joel that i'll pour up my spirit it's been poured into his body so he says it's quickening power that done that it's quickening fire the foretold of these things the quickening power of god made the world testify of this uh of this to be the truth the angel of the lord he says i told you was around the pillar of fire the quickening power let the word testify that this is the truth it says and in and in that they it says they didn't know what it was and we knew he said just look look at it this way it's a load up there they didn't know they took the picture they didn't know what to do with it but it's the same quickening power the prophesy of it it's the same quickening power that talked about it it's the same quickening power that said take it and turn it around and it will see what it is it's the same it's always the same god the same christ and what is it doing is manifesting himself in a greater manner to his people why because it's it's a uniting time it's a time where his desiring to become one with us is a time where his desiring to manifest himself isn't his people it's a it's a time where after he's died and he gave his life and he gave all that he was it's the time that he comes and claimed what he died for so he can fully manifest himself in a human body now he says he continues on it says in this it says he is the one who opens those seals he is those seals for the whole world of god is christ and christ is the seals he says christ is the seals that was open which is what is the opening of the seals revealing christ it says and the very and the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed and we couldn't even see it we didn't they took a picture not us they uh it says there it is standing there the supreme judge showing is the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end what an identification quickening power did that to us quickening power did that to us and then he says it's all our lord is full of quickening power let us not let us see this these things coming quickening power snatches from death to life quickening power gives us discernment to to know what's wrong with us what to do and what we have done and what what we ought to what what we have we ought to we have done and to show us and what we should have done that we and what we will be quickening power all these things so in other words the quickening power is here so it can let us know what do we need to do what is our portion uh quickening power is here to lead us to guide us quickening is quickening power is here so we can live by it so we can walk by it everything about us is by quickening power quickening his power is here to make himself a reality to us so we can understand what he wants to do with us so we can understand in what direction he wants to tell us he wants to lead us so it's always about the quickening power he says hello jesus is so full of quickening power he was he was he says he was all of it together he says he was full of quickening power he said you destroyed this body and i'll raise it up again in three days he says talk about confidence in quickening power it destroyed this body this temple and i will bring it up again and i'll bring it up in three days why he says yes he would say why he would say that he says he knew that it was written of him now i like how our messenger takes something he will speak and then now you can already sense when he's about to bring it to us you can already sense how he's about to turn it around and how he's about to just take it and and turn the light to you so you can understand it says he knew what was written of him see it says that was what was written of him by the word of god that he could not fall that he that the word of god that could not fail the word says i will not suffer my holy one to seek corruption neither will i have living soul his soul in hell he knowed that quickening power would raise him up it says we raise him up he says there wouldn't be one cell corrupt he says destroy this temple and i will bring it back up again in three days why it was prophesy the word of god a prophecy it says if it be true the word of god it cannot fail and the same prophecy of the word of god of of word of god said that it will raise them up says that we are already raised so the same word that says that is already risen up he says i'll raise he up from the dead he's saying we are also raised up with him no wonder he says fear not it is written that the spirit it says the spirit that is now what he says the spirit that is now was in him now is in us also quickening our mortal bodies fear not friends the sun is up the eson is up so here he is in other words is comforting us is letting us know he's bringing us to a place where we can have understanding this morning that the same way the spirit walked in him the same way the spirit raised him up from the dead the same way the spirit put confidence in him to know what the word said about him the same way the spirit led him to go places to do things that revealed to him visions of what he should and and where he should go and where he should not go when the spirit comes into the bride is there to do the same thing the spirit is here to lead us to give us confidence to tell us to fear not to provide for our needs to give us victory to give us healing to give all of those things why because it's the same exact spirit in fact i want to say this just so i can get to what i want to say this morning the script the spirit is here to put us into rapturing conditions and that's my title this morning rapturing condition we cannot be in the rapture condition unless the spirit of god comes and quicken us it quickens us today it will quicken tomorrow it will click it why it's making every single word of god a reality to us bringing us into a condition where we can receive the body change bringing us into a condition where we can be aware of what he has done because i want to say this what's the purpose of sending the quickening power it's not for us to just say oh we received the quickening power it's to bring a change in you remember he says it's the secret lies within the sent them seven seals it says the rapture in faith was in the seven sails the window seals will open what up in the seven sales is the quickening power so by receiving the seven sales i am receiving the quickening power i am receiving and it's transforming me putting me in the rapture condition where i'm no longer about the business of this world where i'm not interested in the things of the world where my mind is being changed where everything about me is change to where i'm focused to where i'm going amen now when you speak about to be conditioned when you say i'm being conditioned it speaks i just took a definition so i can just frame this in what we want to say this morning uh it says uh it's a it's significant influence or or it's it's something to determine the manner of the outcome of something so when you are being conditioned it it it's it's a pressure it's something that's been applied in order to to have a certain outcome and and it speaks about the similar words that could be used it's to constrain or to control to govern or to to to determine something or to decide how something is going to work out to be so when you put it in a certain condition there's a certain outcome that's expected and also i like this it says to bring something into a desired state to use it to bring something into an expected end into a desired state it's to treat it to prepare it to make it ready to radiate to in the set of readiness to temper with it to process it and and and year i was thinking about this even this morning uh yet we are you you woke up this morning you you you prepare yourself you showered yourself you got ready you took a clothes out of the closet and you took your breakfast you did whatever preparation was needed you place yourself in condition because you knew you were coming to the house of god in other words you didn't walk up this morning with your pajamas and took a cup of coffee and sat on the chair and said i was going to church that in other words if you had somebody looking at you it would be confusing but if they saw you go through the shower they saw you got your clothes ready they saw you doing all of these things automatically without you saying a word they knew that that person was getting into a condition because they're going somewhere why you put yourself in condition whatever your makeup whatever you did sure that there was an expectation of something of an action that was to take place uh and i thought about it in sense of uh perhaps in the uh wordly i was thinking about this in the sport uh mainly boxing i thought this was that a while ago i came across this and really it shocked me per se and so it was talking about there was a fight and this person lost the fight and everybody expected him to win and so i was following one of the commentator mexico and he says well you know i just looked at him when he came out and i knew he was going to lose and he said they asked him so how did you know he said oh well you know when he came out he was he was really dry you know he wasn't breaking sweat he came out so dry and that's how you know he wasn't even ready and i thought well this is interesting i said you know if i was going to a boxing match i'll try to preserve my energy all that i can so that the first punch i will give will be in the ring but no now i want you to understand this conditioning is not training training has already taken place but right before they can come out to the ring and before the match gets taught they are there in the back and just relaxing the muscles and throwing just punches and just getting ready they're there and they'll break a sweat just trying to get the combination going and all the things and they just they're shaking and just making sure that they don't get cold and everything therefore when they come into the ring oh my goodness they're just ready to go and i thought about it i said that's exactly what god is doing with us my brother my sister the quickening power is not for us to go use it over the other side oh he's wanting us to get into the ring when sickness come around you throw the punches and when something come around you throw the punches why because he's getting you conditioning for something that's about to take place he's just getting you ready he's warming the muscles he's warming everything up because if that quickening power has worked one time you are guaranteed to know that you can use it and it will work again he didn't say well i'll get my quickening power and i'll remain cold and i won't do anything and i'll wait until i get the rapture then i'll go you said no that's not how god works he wants you to move around and he wants you to go and when the enemy comes he knows how to step it and to do all those things why you are being conditioned for something that is to come oh i thought god blessed my soul and i said that's what the quickening power has been given to us for you know the scripture says it's the same thing in the end time he says that in the end time that god will send a messenger in the end time malachite 4-5 will come why because there's a bride that's about to take a flight it says in the end time even as we read it in uh first thessalonians chapter 4 it says the lord himself shall descend and verbatim says when he comes down there's three things that happen he comes down with a shout he comes with the voice and then there's the trump that follow and then he says what is the shout he asks the question what is the shout it says it's the living word of god it's the living word of god calling forth the bride it's bringing foster bride in other words if the word doesn't go out the blood will not come out therefore when the word comes forth that word as it goes forth a bride has been gathered to him and when the bride is being gathered the voice is the voice of resurrection the same voice that raised up lazard and the trump is trying to take us into the wedding supper so in other words what is that doing what is the purpose of the message of the hour oh my brother my sister to get us into condition so now now listen to this he speaks here in the message abraham grace cavanaugh i just want to see if we can go through this he says and now i want to ask you something as we go on it says forgive me sisters it says it's a mixed audience it says but you listen to your doctor so i'm your brother uh he says how would an old woman a hundred years old go into labor and give birth to a child it says it's it's 45 years old it's as if a 45 year old woman went into labor today the doctors they would have respiration and everything else in there for her it says and years a woman a hundred years old about he says with no artificial respiratory uh respiration he says he had to do something he says what did he do he just met her new again prove it he says yes sir they took a trip 300 miles to guerrera and where they got they got that when they got down there this old little old grandma abimelech fell in love with her it says it says it says the most beautiful woman he ever saw abraham straight up straighten up his hair and got black again sarah became beautiful see listen to this he says he just made a new creation so they could get they could live together again like they were young men and young women he says what what was he doing he was he had to get them in condition to receive the promised son now who does the conditioning is god who has to prepare he gives you what you need in order for you to get ready he provides what is needed for you to get ready they needed a body change and we know when we read the scripture one of the things you realize quickly is it didn't it wasn't so much that sarah had to be turned young because she was young and she didn't get a child and and this is the church because sarah is a type of church but what it would take is they had to come in quickening power that actually changed the elements inside of her to give her the ability for her to have a child oh my brother my sister it takes this quickening power to change us because remember he says he continually says it on if you go in 5152 and all those things 56 and all he will talk about oh the church is here they can't they don't have enough faith for the tooth freak and they don't have you know faith for this how are we gonna have faith for the rapture how are we gonna have faith for the rapture oh but there comes a time where he begins his message change and he begins to let you know that something has happened quickening power is coming there is the revealing of the word and the end time to give you what you need in order for you to be prepared so therefore i want to say our ability to become christian is not good enough we can cry all we want that's wonderful but because and the fact that he puts the desire in there is so you can come and receive of the quickening power to bring forth the things that you desire so it's not because the scripture says it's not my mind it's not my power but it's by this quickening power that brings about the change so he continues on he says what's the next thing after the signs goes away he says god is going to condition abraham children getting ready getting them ready to receive the promised son now you're not not talking about sarah anymore he's talking about us god is going to condition abraham's children getting them ready to receive the promised son and then he says how are we going to receive it how are we going to receive it it says we can't receive we can't receive him in these bodies we're going to meet him up in the air press god forever the trumpet shall sound the dead in christ shall rise and we'll go up to meet him he says what is he doing in the last in the last sign before the transformation the last sign before the rapture he says the most the most for most anything of the atomic bomb going to destroy the world before is it screams into the tape jesus is coming which is it says which is uh we which are lives and remain shall not be shall not present or hinder them that are asleep or dead for the trump of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise we which our lives and remains shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye it says an old man will be young an old woman will be young and will be conditioned to meet him to meet the coming promised to meet the promised coming son glory to god hallelujah the next thing in god's order so if we are being conditioned to meet the coming son and that's why this is becomes very critical to us because here he is saying there's a promise of meeting him in the air there's a promise of us coming to a place where we're going to meet him in the air there's a promise for the rapture but before the rapture can happen god is trying to change the condition he's trying to change us and get us ready into a place where we can meet him in the air and therefore in the same time that's why he sent forth malachi 4. that's why he's open up luke 17 30. that's why revelation 10 and 10 and 7 has come to pass why all of those things probably says in one place that god has given us all the material here on earth for us to be ready in other words what we need to do this morning is to eat afterward is to embrace what the word says because remember what what the quickening power did is it opened up the things that were not known before it opened up your potential that you didn't even know existed yeah he is the church and the church world will come in all they can preach about is you got to get the baptism off the holy ghost you got to get the baptism of the holy ghost and that's where they stop after you receive faith and you went into justification sanctification once you reach the baptism of the holy ghost there was nothing else to talk about they took you right back down to repentance again oh but this messenger came on the scene there he is that one place is even saying you can have the baptism of the holy ghost and still go to hell what a confusion it was to those people why because they didn't understand that there was a new entrance being open there was a new world that was open there was a new land that was being opened that all that god has been working for everything that he's been talking about why because now is not the baptism of the holy ghost but he's talking to you about your inheritance and what you should be doing i i don't want to just have enough holy ghost to not sin and and to not lie and be satisfied that's not the calling for this time that's not the inheritance in this time this time we are called in fact the scripture says about them in the end time that they have been given power to put the devil under their feet they have been given power over death now remember in the old testament when romanum speaks it says oh they all came in and they did great wonders and all those things but there was one thing that they couldn't overcome that was power over death so all of them abraham and jacob and all of them after they'd done all that they could and after they've done great things where did they find themselves locked up because they couldn't break past the death and it just had power all but when jesus came he went into the the the place of death and he went to those that were there and it took the key and when the sting of death was put in him he took it and he swallowed it and dissolved what death was and in doing so all that was to come all that was to come he came down and he gave his life he came down and he gave them the same power that he had so they can overcome death in other words we are here to change the things and to hear to to represent the kingdom of god we are here in order to move forth and to conquer for the kingdom of god we are here as a representation of what christ is to be on the earth he says he talks here it comes and he's talking about nathaniel he's talking about being put in condition this is after philip came in so philip came to nathaniel and they called him and we know that nathaniel looked at him and he said could anything come out of nazareth asking a question is there anything that can really come out of nazareth and philip told him he says just come and see for yourself come and see for yourself you know i talked about their condition for rapture one of the things that the prophet says and i'll come to it in a moment about what's happening in the end time about the condition for rapture he says the markers will go first the markets will come out first oh there's nothing to it what is that cloud they're just talking about things they don't it's just smoke the markers will always come first oh you know i i don't believe what they're talking about oh there's no such thing as god and there's no the atheist and no you know we're talking with the young people you know the reason why the world is in the state that it is is because there's been so many fake representation of what a christian should be people calling themselves christians but they're found in all kinds of things it created the whole distrust you can talk about being a christian it becomes like being a laughingstock why because they've met so many faiths but it's in that time it's in that situation it's in that condition god says i'm gonna raise a true one i'm gonna raise one who's not gonna be like the other one i'm gonna raise one who is gonna be just like i am who's gonna be my very true representation it's in that time that god chooses it's in satan's eden at the very peak of all the same that could be that god comes and he says this is exact time that i'm going to have my bride you say well could you not pick another time he says no this is the exact time why because at the peak of what the devil can do that's where i can show my past so now he's talking about nathaniel and then he says it says he says when he looked at him it says before philip called you when you were under the tree i saw you now listen it says thou are the son of god god the king of israel he says he was willing to admit to him he was willing to admit him to be the son of god because of because of what he did jesus looked at him and he said he says because i told you and you believed it says yes he says you'll see greater things than this oh my what a favor that is given to one that believes he says he was getting in condition then to see the things you can never see anything until you get into the spirit of it as always you can never see where the christianity is right if christianity is right until the holy spirit wants saves you they don't know what they're talking about oh i don't believe this you didn't come close enough all this is not right because you didn't come close enough you come closer you let this god touch you you let this message come into you you let this god do for you what he did for me you let this god come in contact you let him touch you one time he opens up your eyes and it opens up everything for you so the thing is people are approaching it with an intellectual understanding it's just scripture to scripture or something you let that reality of god touch you and you will never be the same nobody has to tell you if this is true or not because you know that it's touch you amen so it's not a matter of getting offended it's just a matter of knowing that you didn't see what i saw you didn't get touched by what i got touched with you didn't get your eyes and get open to what my eyes got open to if you saw what i saw oh we were talking about witnessing you see there's such a thing you know one of the questions that you want to know if a person is a true witness or not is you people examine when they put you up on the bench they want to see the effect of what you saw so are you a witness yeah how did you feel when you saw it nothing what did it do to you what did you think when you saw it nothing everybody's going to wonder did you really see it did you really see it did you really see did you really see what you're talking about why because the effects are enough to tell whether you are eyewitness or not the effects are enough to tell whether you are witness or not or my brother my sister i don't need the intellectual effect oh i don't need the intellectual understanding i want to change life where a person looks at me says what did you feel it says it was everything to me how did you do it changed the way i see things it changed the way i approached things it changed the way i see things why because i was touched it says you can never see where christianity whether christianity is right until the holy spirit once saved you then you can see that's where it's right he says amazing grace how sweet the sound you know i once was blind but now i see it says that's the way you have to do with divine healing you have to get into the spirit of it the holy spirit it says and let it show you and reveal himself to you when you come to that place where it's been revealed himself to you that's when you got the real understanding of what it means that's what what makes you a true weakness he says in a message my angel shall go before you he says and i want you to get close he says because you know you know you know what i'm doing and now he's speaking to a woman coming into i believe it's a prayer line it says it says i'm contacting your spirit i'm talking to you it says i want you to believe this it says i want you to believe this that god knows all things what he's trying to he says and what he's trying to do is to get you in condition to receive your healing i thought oh my that's what this whole message is all about here he is he will stand a person before him it says now i see you standing in the doctor's office and i see them examining you and and i see after you walk out i see him writing the report and and i see him right such and such and and i see you being told this and everything and and i see you walk out of that office and this is what he told you you have this is what he told you everything and it says it's not right if it's right raise your right hand and they will do so and everything oh but what is he doing it's not just for purpose to let you know something but what he's trying to you to do is bringing you into a condition why he's forcing you now he's raising your faith and it's bringing you an excuse now he's got an expected end but for him to get you in an expected hand he has to change the condition oh your condition was this is what you're told this is what your grandmother had this is what your father had this runs into the family that's the condition you are in but when you come before this god he begins to frame the condition differently he says well i see all of that i see all of that and within your mind you know no one was there when this was told to me no one saw this and if this person knows what he's talking about that means he can tell me what's to come [Applause] the reason why we can believe what's to come is because there's a perfect description of what we wear he's able to tell you what's to pass he looks at you and says now i know where you live this is your house number this is what you when you woke up this morning this is what you did and you talked and you said you will be standing in line you'll come to the prayer line and you'll be praying for such insight that was in your heart is that true you said yes so he told you what was he told you what you just did before you came therefore he can predict the future what a mighty god why condition is everything with the moment he changes the condition the outcome is changing yeah we are grew up in denomination and all we need is you are sinner you got to get right however rights you try to get you still need to get right everything it's i mean you thought yesterday you had the holy ghost and you just so happy and then next sunday you hear you don't have it it's such a confusion state and here he is and barbara calls it the cycle of revival and death that's all that was stuck in it's revival then it's death it's revival then it's death it's revival then it's death oh it took somebody to come and break the cycle and there's only one that can break the cycle and that's the lord jesus christ why because he has something that he needs to do in the end time so he comes and he breaks the cycle it says you're no longer going back why are you not going back because he goes way back he says because over here you were already this to begin with the moment you hung up for it you only identified to what was here in the beginning so if you try to go back the only place you can go back is in his mind that's what happened to us the only place we can go back is in his mind why because we go back past our parents we go back past where we were born we go back past all the things that we know why that's the quickening power in the end time amen it says and god knows all things and is trying to get and it's trying to get to you so there's already an expected end now you are here just roaming in the stream of life and just toasting to and fro now he's trying to get you in position with what was already in the beginning now what was already in the beginning is manifested in what you're going to be at the end anyway but you are here in between so what when you try to look back you can only look until you were born you can only look to your parents you can only look how you were raised and that's the only identification that's the only thing you can look at but this one comes and says okay i know this he tells you about your parents he tells you about everything but it says i also know this he takes her right back past the parents he takes you about what was in the mind of god and i says now what i'm trying to do is because of all of this this was to come to this expected end i'm trying to position you to where you're coming now it's god working the past is working the future he's working the present to bring an expected hand why because unless we are brought into that condition then we won't know where we're going or how to get there the world is here to put us in condition he says here says this has kind heavenly father we thank you we thank thee tonight for the people who are willing to come and sit in a hot building like this and make a sacrifice and come it says and be inconvenient to them it says and come to hear the gospel the preaching of the gospel and see the power of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ convicted sinners in in and their sins and bring them to the reconciliation to god and i pray father that you will bless them for their effort he says many poor people sitting here tonight suffering with heart trouble cancer stomach trouble and tb and all kinds of diseases and affliction of course this crowd pushes like essen and and thinks an intense heat and the intense heat in the building it says they are suffering as you can as as they are suffering as they said he as they sit here oh god may the holy spirit come in this in his great power like he did to the children the hebrews children in the furnace in the fierce furnace and put our minds and put on and put our minds so in condition to think upon him and listen to his blessed word he says until the heat in the building will fade away and we won't think about it no more i said god i want to be in our condition i don't want to come to church and my mind is here my mind is there and i'm thinking oh what is this one thinking what is this what is that i want my mind to be so focused on him because that's how i can receive what it has in store for me it's the conditioning of the word coming and the word being preached and one receiving within the heart that's what changes the circumstance for you to look up and to expect so he can come down and do according to his word it says if we could just come by the power of the holy ghost that we renew all the faith and all the strength granted he said he says but look friends this time is coming that we are rising that we are that there is a rising church up here and he says and we can't have faith of divine healing how are we going to have faith for the rapture we've got to move up friends we've got to get out of this old and slow church condition it says that we are in and step out and launch out in the shoreline and get into somewhere where where you lose all your senses of fear and doubt and dare all things are possible brother just just be free as free as could be you've got you you've got to sail towards heaven and nothing can stir you no way it says you are done that way that's all nothing can harm you and and i want and i want us to think about even what we minister on last time it's in looking into the unseen it's in in in moving into the five senses that's why i said we are not of the flesh but we are of the spirit if we operate by the flesh we shall surely fail but if we operate by the spirit the spirit will bring us into that condition where all things are possible where god can come this morning and minister to our heart where god can come and make himself known to each individual where whatever you came down here with a need in your heart god can make it a reality now i want to change directions for a little bit we just read the scriptures but when i'm i was looking in the message ah the the brother branham speaks in the message the rapture and and we know if you if you've ever uh read that message you you understand if it has been uh told and and preached many times how that it's strange the scripture that he chooses to bring as his opening text for the rapture so he chooses psalm 27 for rapture which is very strange because one would perhaps use first thessalonians 4 as we read it this morning but here he comes and and now he's what is he doing but when he starts to speak in that message the first thing that he's trying to paint is the condition around us the condition for the rapture and even as we read in his text you begin to see very clearly he says the lord in psalm 27 1 it says the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid is invoking a condition where fear is trying to be injected it's talking about a time where there's he's talking about a time where there's markers there's people saying all kinds of things he's talking about a time where men will lose their minds he's talking about a time where there's wars and he because the next verse he says when the wicked even my enemy when they come when my enemies and my four come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fall and now he's talking about enemies and people trying to eat his flesh and then he says though in a whole shooting camp around me my heart should not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident it's not talking about a happy time it's not talking about a time where everything is easy where you are loved by all he's talking about a time of persecution where it seems like they're trying to get the best out of you and i began to think about this because it's very important we realize that the time of rapture is the time where the devil is trying to come and distract you as much as possible with anything possible so the last thing you can think of is the rapture now i i don't care whether it's family whether it's job whether it's the your responsibility whatever anything that's put above god the devil can raise it up so he can keep your focus away from rapture and that's what david is saying here my enemy is a time of rapture but i have enemies it's a time of rapture but they're trying to eat up my flesh it's a time of rapture there's wars it's a time of rapture that's just happening why it's a time it's trying to get you distracted so you can keep your mind on something else because the moment you consider those conditions you won't be focusing on the rapture but look at david it says but one thing i have desire of the lord and not which i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the day of my life david is saying this may be going on that may be going on this may be happening over there but all my heart my desire within me is to focus on the lord if my desire is the lord my desire is to remain in the lord my desire is to do this because i know that in the time of trouble he shall hide me it says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of his tabernacle he shall hide me he says he shall set me up on the rock he says he shall set me up on the rock so here he is after the condition has been spoken after all those things and and the devil is trying to get you distracted he's trying to bring up all kinds of things they feel saying in this very time of confusion as per say it says i'll have a single heart desire that i may please the lord that was david's desire and that was his preparation for the rapture his preparation for the rapture was the lord is my light and my salvation of whom shall i fear when they when the enemy even when the when the enemy even falls when they came out to eat up on my flesh i will not fear when the war should rise against me in this will i have confidence so a one who's going in the rapture his condition is focused on one thing oh that i may dwell in the presence of god you know the enemy is the master of confusion it's the master because we understand within our minds every time we are caused to make decisions and and every day we walk up his decisions and the decisions and what he's trying to do trying to get your rapture out of your mind and i want to say this this morning that's why it's important we focus on the word it's important we realize the word has been open to us and the world is here to bring us into the right condition and the right condition is i'm here to manifest christ whether it be for my family whether it be for my job whether it be for whatever it is whatever i need to take care of i'm taking it as a sun i'm doing it as a sun why because i'm placing the lord always before me david said but but i'm says he says he's speaking about another time of confusion what i'm speaks about elijah because you have to understand it was always important that god sends his messengers because after the people have gone awhile they will find themselves right back in the condition they weren't but they were in before he will send the prophet and they will come back again he'll send the prophet he would have though they will backside and they will have to send another prophet so now he speaks about a time of elijah says a time of great confusion until people didn't even know what god to worship they didn't even know where they should go who they should worship they said but god spoke to elijah and he came and he came to balin he came to ahab and and he told them that they should come to the mount kamal the showdown it says well you know we can't keep this confusion going you go call out all your prophets and i will meet you at the mount carmel and the god who shall answer by fire that god will worship and so they gather up tonight they gather up and i want to say this it's the representation even of the time that we're living in because barbados says denomination that brought such a confusion about everything is it one god is it to god is it three god is it the baptism in the name of jesus or is it father son and holy ghost what is it it says well there's got to come a showdown the god who answers by fire let him be god he says they gather up on the mountain and here they go it says you can go first they went up and they screamed and they shouted and they cut themselves and did all kinds of things and and and you know he says when it came lunch time he came around and he says perhaps you need to scream a little louder mocking them and he says perhaps your god is on vacation you need to cry out so he can come back and they came and they screamed louder and did all kinds of things oh but it wasn't until the evening time when the evening time came he knew that this was my time and he came and says okay now let's move the altar he came and he cleaned up the altar and he put the sacrifice and he put the wood and he put everything and what madam says at one place he told them to pour water to put it until every word was soaked and the purpose was he wanted to show them that this was god in other words it's just not the fact that you can light up fire on the altar but there had to be some evidences that this is god that a man cannot do this that's why in the ministry of the son of man in this end time they can criticize all they want well you know what he preaches we don't understand though what he says lest we don't understand but when it came time for the discernment they knew that a man of flesh cannot do those things they knew there was something different about what the man was doing because he will stand there he would have the sign of the son of man in the end time where he can turn his back and begin to discern the audience people that he knew nothing about they knew that that was the sign of god put up the words they did put the sacrifice he laid it out according to the promised word and he said pour water they pour water and he soaked and he says now if god be god let him answer by fire my brother my sister the gospel that comes from god cleans provides fire is purity fire is here to cleanse fire is here to consume fire is here to click out all the things if you receive a gospel that's not cleaning you that didn't come from god that's not the god who answers by fire he says when the holy spirit dwells within your heart it will burn out all the trash it will cause you to kick out all the trash it will put you in condition for you to be a son it will put you in condition for you to manifest him oh my brother my sister this is not condemnation this morning if i have any other gospel i don't want it this is the kind of gospel i want this morning something that can change me cleans me make me something different not the same old person but someone changed the god who answers by fire and barbara says at one place for the sake of time he says he stole the same god today he hadn't changed him in a little bit if he answered by fire at that time he can answer by fire this morning if you need anything burned within you this morning he can come and burn it out the scripture says that the bride her made herself ready how did she make herself ready she's received the word my brother my sister we talk about conditioning the word the way we make ourselves ready is by obeying the word that we have been given is by us conditioning practicing and letting the word work on us letting bring out of us the things that he need for us to do let me just read this real quickly before i can close but says in the message the marriage of the lamb it says and that we know that there is going to be a bride and there is going to be a wedding supper and there's going to be a wedding sample in the sky it says that's as sure as to be as god is because it's his word and we know that those that are going to make to to that are going to make up the bride is going to be in this in his church and is going to appear before him without spot a wrinkle without it says they have the material on earth to make themselves ready you it says if you notice he says she has made ourselves ready he says now so many says if god will take evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i'll serve him he says but that's up to you see you got something to do they that overcome shall inherit the things they that overcome you have the power to do it now this is not condemnation let me say this this morning the church has gone from the cycle of revival as we said from oh i don't got it i need the holy ghost i don't got it now he's positioning you to a place where there's no place back to go you are what you are what were you what you were in the mind of god is saying to you now those that have received the message in the end time he's saying to you now that you have the power to do it you have the power to do it and i'm so encouraged this morning that i know i have the power to do it it's not my own power but is his power working in me so i can go to him and say god you gave me the power to do this therefore remember brother david says they've been given permission that's the one that he uses they've been given permission so they can stand there and say devil you don't belong in my house i have the power to cash you out why i have been given permission by the opening of the seals now listen it continues on it says shall i never take over god it says they have the power to do it it says but you must be willing to lay it down see she has made ourselves ready i like that word he continues on and says see god could not push you through like a little pipe put us out there on the other hand and then say blessed is he that overcome you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but he's got to make but but you've got to make the decision for yourself i have to make a decision for myself i'm do it says in doing that show our faith and respect to god think about it we show our faith and our respect to god by standing where he has placed us by proclaiming the things that he's want us to proclaim if he called me overcomer how can i call myself anything different [Music] all i have to do is walk in the word and say you call me overcomers i'm calling forth for the manifestation of this because you have given me permission to say this you have been giving me permission to do this and walk in it he continues on and says abraham was promised a child but it was but but he says but he maintained his promise for 25 years the ups and downs and as he that he had and the temptation in those 25 days 35 years but he held the word of the promise and israel was promised a promised land but they but he says but they had to fight for every inch of it whatever the soul of your foot threads upon i have given you god said to joshua it says it was all there the land was there god gave it to them but they must fight for it it says now listen the same way it is about divine healing god god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it i said god give me the courage god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you'll fight every inch of the way god has got amazing grace to save you he will do it but you've got to fight for every inch of the way it says i've been behind the pulpit going on 31 30 31 years and every inch every inch of that has been fighting constantly it certainly has but we must fight if we must rain so we find out that the bride has made ourselves ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run the patients the race that is set before us we must lay aside ourselves we can't say god you came i lay myself aside we've got to do that ourselves in the sudden catching away he says some say some people say well i go to church on sunday morning i listen to a pastor which is a fine preacher that's good it says i appreciate that in you or the america the world whoever it is but it takes more than good message from a pulpit it takes your life it takes you to get ready in revelation 19 chapter says 17 19 and 17 it says the bible says speaking of the bride she made herself ready no we have the word we have to walk in obedience in the word we have to apply the token we have to have to let the word live in us we have to love the word to love the truth and let it we have to go on our knees and call those promises to be manifested sometimes we do so much preaching and so much word and very little prayer we know that it takes prayer and the word for you to bring up the promises of god to come to pass it takes you going to pray and said god you said this and i'm standing here so that what you said will come to pass and i'm not moving until it comes to pass we can go example after example in the bible people who change circumstances by going to their knees people who went and they some thought they were drunk and some called them all kinds of names but they knew in doing so that they will bring the word to come to pass the scripture says be hearer endure how do we do it we go to our knees and say god you promised me this god you said in your word this is what i'll be god you said this and and i see the promise and i see the fullness of the word being revealed i'm not staying behind whatever your word says i am and therefore i'm calling upon you i'm calling upon the spirit that spoke the word i'm calling for the spirit to come and bring the world to come to pass the word is here to put us in condition he changes both the outside and the spiritual condition so we can hunger for it oh i don't know let me just say this in this end time and even perhaps more than before there's such a hunger and a desire from the true believer to see the manifestation of the hour we're not interested just in talking about a god in history we're not interested in just talking about oh he promised it's going to come one day no we are in the time where he says today ye are the sons of god today we are sitting in heavenly places so therefore i want to call it from wherever it is in the future and bring it today it's today it says when you hear your word his word hidden not your voice if the musician could come it says and when the bride because i want you to remember the rapture is only for the elected few rapture is only for those that are members of the bride who are talking in some way asking well how about someone who's in the nomination and if they receive the holy spirit then it's not up to us to judge who's going to be saved and who's not there will be those that will be in by the white throne judgment that's god's choosing but they are those that are coming from the message of the hour they are a selected few who's heard the voice of the seventh angel as he began to sound of the trumpet as he began to sound of his message as he began to call forth prabhupada says the living word of god the living bread of life bringing forth the bride as the word is going forth there's a selected view that are gathering there's a selected few that are saying i heard my name being called there's a selected viewer says that's me that is calling there's a selected view that says that's me that's me that's me that is calling the description that he gave that was my description what he talked about the past that was me when he called and he says you came from this this is your address that was me and now that he told me the past and the present he's the same intelligence that told the tree to hide his life in winter he's the same intelligence that told the geese to fly and go out when the season changed all that same intelligence is here tonight this morning to speak to us and to let us know what direction are we going rapture ready oh i want to be so light but when it says fly one place that we are heavy we we carry the burdens of the world and you know we we have this and we have this and and pretty soon we get depressed and we need a vacation we come back we are depressed from the vacation we pick up where we left off it's a complete mess oh but there's a place by me he says there's a hiding place david says that in the time of trouble he shall hide me he shall provide a place for me to be when the world is falling apart when everything seems to just go sideways where there is trouble on every side where we are persecuted when there's churches shutting down where there's all kinds of people falling away in that time it will hide me in the secret place of his tabernacle he shall hide me it says and then my head shall be lifted up above my enemies he shall set me up upon the rock upon a revelation he didn't say well i will set myself upon the rock remember when the opening of the says oh i just want to stop but just excuse me this was a place that man has never stood before remember when the sword came remember the pyramid it was a place that man has never been before we were standing on the rock of ages a place where we've never been before what is he doing he's saying you i'm your hiding place you don't have to fear you don't have to worry i predestined it all things and i am changing the conditions because there's a condition that you got to come into where the desires of the world have fallen off where the only thing you're desiring is me i feel like sometimes we are so attached to the world that that god is just have to come and cut those strings off you know the pandemic struck here and you know we felt like we're about to lose our jobs and then we started adding up i lose my job i lose my home i lose my car i lose this i lose this oh my what's gonna happen we forget that there's a hiding place for us we are not of the flesh we are off the spirit and then he says if you walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the desires of the flesh but if ye are carnally minded it's enmity to god let's all stand tonight this morning amen [Music] i want to be spiritually minded this morning i want everything about me to be spiritual in fact i want even everything that naturally comes at me the only way i look at it is spiritual you're losing your mind that's fine i probably am better off that way than i am this way because the more we look at carnally the more we don't understand but spiritually is the way we've been given let's just bow our heads this morning our gracious father we're so thankful lord for everything you do for us lord to know that you are making the condition necessary for us to be ready father the scripture speaks about the children of israel who said that when they started crying when they were in egypt when they begin to call out when they got into a condition where they didn't like what they were seeing around them when the egyptian afflicted them and it said then they began to cry for the promise but your messenger comes around and he says you are not changing us by the circumstances of the world in fact it says that the world council of churches and the forces of the world it says it will lead the church into the into the world council of churches but he says it's the power of god that's going to bring us up and i believe your word is here changing our circumstances lord opening our eyes to see the things which was doing in this end time giving us a greater reality a greater understanding letting us know the things which you had in store lord that we can claim and let it be manifested in us we pray lord this morning the desires of our heart is not to fall short of anything but it's to walk in every promise that you've laid before us lord father
