[6:49] pray
[6:50] amen
[6:54] amen well good morning
[6:57] as you can see the lot has fallen to me
[7:00] to
[7:01] do a couple of things we're going to go
[7:02] ahead and do the psalm this morning
[7:09] happy fourth of july
[7:14] you know today is independence day
[7:19] it's a time when we in america
[7:22] take time to remember and
[7:25] celebrate the freedom which has been
[7:28] so dearly bought and paid for by so many
[7:32] men and women it's the
[7:37] remembrance of being free from bondage
[7:40] being free from
[7:41] tyranny it's the remembrance of when a
[7:44] declaration of independence
[7:46] was made or at least
[7:51] that's what it's supposed to be but you
[7:53] know when we live in a
[7:55] we find ourselves in a society that's
[7:57] increasingly confusing
[7:59] freedom with bondage you know it's
[8:02] uh anyone who's a student of history
[8:05] will know will be able to recognize that
[8:09] when a declaration of independence was
[8:11] made it was with the understanding that
[8:13] the word
[8:15] would be the foundation upon which
[8:19] freedom was built
[8:22] and yet when you remove that absolute
[8:26] all it becomes is men fighting with one
[8:30] another for control of the narrative of
[8:32] the
[8:32] hour you know freedom has become nothing
[8:36] more
[8:36] than one's ability to impose their will
[8:40] and their preference and their beliefs
[8:42] and their fears
[8:43] on another person
[8:47] you know the airwaves newspapers the
[8:49] social networks are all filled with
[8:51] voices clamoring for you to get on board
[8:53] and adopt one of these messages
[8:57] all of you all of them requiring us to
[8:59] compromise on the word in some way
[9:03] you know it can be intimidating it can
[9:05] be overwhelming
[9:07] to be surrounded by all of these voices
[9:09] and
[9:10] you know if it wasn't for the lord
[9:11] coming by our way
[9:13] there's no telling which one of these
[9:16] things we would be caught up in and
[9:17] which would have dominion over our lives
[9:20] you know if we turn to psalm 124 this
[9:23] morning
[9:24] it's interesting because david
[9:27] seems to speak of a
[9:30] similar experience
[9:36] you know he's speaking of a people god's
[9:38] people
[9:39] the people of the word being surrounded
[9:42] by men who would seek to swallow them up
[9:44] with pressure and
[9:46] all because of they would not be part of
[9:49] one of those kingdoms
[9:52] you know he begins the psalm by saying
[9:53] if it had not been the lord who was on
[9:55] our side
[9:58] you know when i was thinking about that
[9:59] that's the only difference
[10:02] i imagine we could go through this place
[10:04] and start that statement if it had not
[10:06] been the lord that was by our side
[10:09] blank the room would be filled with
[10:12] testimony
[10:13] after testimony after testimony
[10:16] of what would likely have happened maybe
[10:19] beyond our imagination
[10:21] if the lord had not been by our side
[10:25] you know as we read the rest of the
[10:27] psalm you know and we'll read it here in
[10:28] a second how he describes you know
[10:30] men trying to swallow them up with
[10:32] pressure all the voices all the
[10:34] intimidation all because there was a
[10:35] people
[10:37] a people of the word a chosen people
[10:41] that would not ally themselves
[10:44] and that stood in the way frankly of all
[10:46] the kingdoms of the world
[10:49] you know i thought that sounded familiar
[10:51] today
[10:54] but you know in the middle of all of
[10:55] this david makes an interesting
[10:57] statement something that
[10:58] i guess could be a declaration of
[11:00] independence
[11:02] and it's in verse 6 and verse 7 it says
[11:05] this blessed be the lord
[11:07] who hath not given us as a prey to their
[11:10] teeth
[11:12] our soul is escaped as a bird
[11:15] out of the snare of the fowlers
[11:19] the snare is broken and we are escaped
[11:23] if that isn't a declaration of
[11:25] independence
[11:26] i don't know what is you know there's
[11:29] another people
[11:32] of the word who find themselves in this
[11:34] hour surrounded by similar
[11:36] pressure similar demands similar
[11:38] intimidation
[11:40] all asking us to compromise on the word
[11:43] in some way
[11:44] you know it's easy to in a moment of
[11:46] weakness become influenced by one or by
[11:48] the other but
[11:51] you know we have a declaration of
[11:53] independence to make
[11:55] the lord has come by our way and no
[11:57] matter how intimidating or how much
[11:59] pressure these voices or these
[12:00] influencers these narratives of the day
[12:02] might be
[12:04] blessed be the lord who hath not given
[12:06] us as a prey to their teeth
[12:08] the snare is broken and we are escaped
[12:12] you know someone came by our way and
[12:14] shined a light
[12:15] and we recognize the devil and all of
[12:17] his tricks
[12:19] and i'm grateful this morning that my
[12:21] sheep hear my voice
[12:23] and another voice they will not follow
[12:26] we can celebrate
[12:27] independence today like no other can
[12:31] the fact that we've been set free from
[12:33] all those voices
[12:34] from all those snares from all those
[12:36] influences that would seek to
[12:38] pull us down the snare is broken
[12:41] and we are escaped so let's read that
[12:44] together
[12:46] you know psalm 124 you know it just
[12:48] struck me as we're celebrating freedom
[12:50] as a country
[12:51] let's celebrate the freedom that we've
[12:53] been given the snare is broken
[12:55] and we are escaped let's read that
[12:57] together
[12:59] if it had not been the lord who was on
[13:01] our side
[13:02] now may israel say if it had not been
[13:06] the lord who was on our side when men
[13:08] rose up against us
[13:10] then they had swallowed us up quick when
[13:12] their wrath was kindled against us
[13:15] then the waters had overwhelmed us the
[13:17] stream had gone over our soul
[13:20] then the proud waters had gone over our
[13:22] soul
[13:23] blessed be the lord who had not given us
[13:25] as a prey to their teeth
[13:27] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[13:30] snare of the fowlers
[13:32] the snare is broken and we are escaped
[13:35] our help is in the name of the lord who
[13:37] made heaven and earth
[13:39] amen you may be seated
[13:43] amen let's go ahead and
[13:51] missing that song amazing grace shall
[13:53] always be

[34:35] lord we have been called
[34:41] father from every walk of life
[34:44] every circumstance
[34:48] and situations
[34:51] and the doors of our bondage were opened
[34:56] and you unshackled the chains lord and
[35:00] you let us walk free
[35:04] but lord you just didn't
[35:08] set us free lord you promised that you
[35:11] would lead and guide us
[35:15] that you would keep us
[35:18] until the day of our departure
[35:21] and lord we're grateful for that this
[35:23] morning we ask that you bless us this
[35:26] morning
[35:26] and help us with your word as we just
[35:32] lord have come to feast on it and
[35:35] listen to it and rejoice we ask you to
[35:38] bless us this morning
[35:40] in jesus precious and wonderful and holy
[35:44] name we pray amen amen
[35:47] god bless you this morning let's turn in
[35:50] our bibles we have a lot of
[35:51] out for the holiday but
[35:55] we just ask the lord would really keep
[35:57] them and
[35:59] and bless them and we
[36:03] are going to continue
[36:06] in our message the easter seal
[36:09] and you know brother branham i i've
[36:13] always
[36:15] kind of viewed it personally in this
[36:17] light
[36:18] that you know brother branham addressed
[36:22] the bigger picture which i called the
[36:26] age he addressed the age and then
[36:30] he also addressed the church
[36:34] which i refer to as the bride
[36:37] so he spoke to the whole time that we
[36:39] live in
[36:40] he addressed that he addressed the
[36:43] church and the bride
[36:44] and he also addresses the individual
[36:47] so there's all the time that he's
[36:50] ministering
[36:51] there's there's these three great
[36:54] messages that are going out
[36:57] and uh so that's why that many times we
[37:00] can read a message and look at the big
[37:02] picture
[37:03] well that's why we're taking it in
[37:05] little short
[37:07] segments and just feasting on it so
[37:11] the scripture said he was kind of a
[37:12] ruddy fella and there was no beauty in
[37:14] him that
[37:15] he could be desired so very average
[37:19] normal looking person and he had the
[37:23] uh characteristics of a carpenter
[37:28] he worked as a carpenter and so
[37:31] he might have had calluses on his hands
[37:34] or
[37:35] certain muscles that a carpenter might
[37:38] develop from doing the kind of work and
[37:41] uh
[37:42] the stories tell us that his uh
[37:45] his um you know father made furniture
[37:48] and
[37:49] and things like that so he he worked
[37:52] in like that but one day
[37:55] he he attended a
[38:00] a feast and
[38:03] just there at the feast like a wedding
[38:06] supper
[38:06] you know and uh they ran out of wine
[38:12] and of course mary knew who he was
[38:17] you know so uh and he just living a
[38:20] normal life like everybody else coming
[38:22] and going i'm sure he had friends
[38:24] had testimonies he had uh cousins
[38:28] and and uh a different uh
[38:32] people very probably a great life of
[38:35] prayer and
[38:36] kept the law and the commandments and
[38:40] was you know identified as just a really
[38:43] good
[38:44] person but one day he makes
[38:48] changes water into wine
[38:52] and things begin to change
[38:55] and they they
[38:58] his mother says bring him the water and
[39:00] they come to me he says this my hours
[39:02] not yet
[39:03] my time's not yet and they just say do
[39:06] what he ask
[39:08] and you know and i always
[39:11] i always just love that great story
[39:15] because of she knew she could count on
[39:18] them
[39:19] and she knew she was going to ask for
[39:22] something
[39:23] and that she wanted to
[39:26] do it for the young couple that they
[39:29] wouldn't embarrass
[39:30] you know just that just that kind of
[39:32] love
[39:33] that she must have had and the kind of
[39:35] love that
[39:36] mary must have had in her heart
[39:40] just as a person that god chose her
[39:43] to be uh perform the
[39:46] works of motherhood in his life she must
[39:49] have had a tender hand
[39:51] she must have had a firm voice
[39:54] she must it just must have been
[39:56] something about mary
[39:58] why that she was chosen to raise this
[40:01] child but all of a sudden he performed a
[40:04] miracle
[40:04] and his fame began to grow and as he
[40:08] began to go out and he
[40:10] went to the synagogue and he took the
[40:12] book and he said he'll bind the
[40:14] brokenhearted he'll set the captive free
[40:16] he'll heal the sick and he said this day
[40:19] this scripture
[40:21] is fulfilled and then one day in that
[40:24] same synagogue there was a man with a
[40:26] withered hand
[40:27] and and that hand came whole
[40:30] and and his fame began
[40:33] to go and grow an ordinary man he began
[40:37] to speak
[40:38] things and he began to say things and
[40:41] and the people began to come to him and
[40:44] and john who had a following
[40:47] pointed out and said behold the lamb of
[40:50] god and he gathered up the twelve his
[40:53] ministry began to grow
[40:55] and and he began to do works and signs
[40:58] and wonders
[40:59] and he began to make statements like me
[41:01] and my father are one
[41:03] destroy this temple in three days will
[41:06] raise it up again and he the things he
[41:09] began to teach the people
[41:12] recognized he was different than any
[41:14] other man he wasn't saying the same old
[41:16] things
[41:17] that there was something else he was
[41:19] talking about
[41:20] something else that he was preaching
[41:22] about about a kingdom that was to come
[41:26] about a baptism that was supposed to
[41:29] fall
[41:30] on the people that they're a reuniting
[41:34] with the father
[41:35] and the people that a removal of a law
[41:39] that kept the people in bondage that
[41:41] they could live
[41:42] not by the law but by grace in other
[41:45] words fulfill the law
[41:48] by grace and love not by rule
[41:51] or fear of punishment he began to say
[41:54] things that begin to stir the hearts
[41:56] of the people up and people can realize
[41:59] there's something different
[42:01] and he's talking about something
[42:04] different
[42:05] and they knew that he possessed
[42:07] something
[42:08] that he had something in him
[42:11] that separated him from everybody else
[42:15] even the rabbis begin and the
[42:18] great people begin to come to him he
[42:20] says master
[42:21] we know that no man can do these things
[42:23] and lest he comes from god
[42:26] and and the lord returns and he refers
[42:30] to the spirit it's a spirit
[42:32] it cometh it's listed as will it well
[42:35] and he
[42:36] he's pointing to something he's talking
[42:38] about something
[42:39] people are getting hungry and they're
[42:41] getting thirsty
[42:42] and and and so he he's
[42:46] he's making all these great statements
[42:49] and doing
[42:50] all this great work and there's a hope
[42:53] in man and now first of all their hope
[42:57] was that
[42:58] they thought he might be the one that
[43:00] unites israel
[43:02] and that they would all come together
[43:04] and they could
[43:05] rise up and put push the romans
[43:08] out of the land they had their political
[43:10] hopes and their political ideas and
[43:13] people follow them for different reasons
[43:16] you know
[43:19] the blessings maybe the possibility of
[43:21] being well the possibility of
[43:23] having bread and fishes but it finally
[43:26] came down to the fact that he
[43:30] he testified about
[43:34] i'll go into the grave you destroyed
[43:37] this temple in three days
[43:39] it'll raise up i'll not suffer my holy
[43:42] one
[43:43] to see corruption
[43:46] and and so it didn't matter
[43:49] what that he said and
[43:53] what that he had spoken he still had to
[43:57] face the same thing
[43:59] that every man and every woman has to
[44:02] face
[44:03] and that was death
[44:06] and he said i have power
[44:10] to lay my life down and i have power
[44:14] to take it up again now
[44:18] there was no question about the works
[44:22] but he then he goes makes this statement
[44:25] and
[44:25] he jumps up and he says come unto me all
[44:28] you that are heavy laden
[44:30] and i will give you rest
[44:33] what a great promise i'll give you peace
[44:37] my peace or path understanding
[44:40] i'll give you joy unspeakable full of
[44:42] glory
[44:43] he began to preach these promises preach
[44:46] these things that he was gonna give
[44:48] people the things that he was going to
[44:50] do for him
[44:51] in other words he didn't have
[44:54] just a small idol uh theological
[44:59] a gospel he he was preaching things that
[45:02] were dynamic
[45:04] preaching things that that didn't didn't
[45:07] just stir
[45:08] the mind they stirred what was in
[45:10] people's hearts
[45:12] every word that he spoke began to
[45:14] fulfill an emptiness
[45:16] it began to to create a hunger
[45:20] after more things of god there there was
[45:23] really something that was
[45:24] moving in the people but they couldn't
[45:27] lay their hands on it
[45:29] you know they sensed it and they could
[45:31] they could see the power of it and they
[45:33] could see the
[45:34] freedom that it began to give them and
[45:37] the gospel went out to the poor
[45:39] he gave hope to them that it wasn't
[45:42] through the riches of men
[45:43] it wasn't through the job that you had
[45:46] that this
[45:47] come from another source it wasn't
[45:50] something
[45:50] carnal and then he died
[45:56] they arrested him the leaders
[45:59] the religious leaders of israel the
[46:02] the high priest and and they allow the
[46:06] israel to have a governor
[46:08] and to rule their country but but they
[46:11] still
[46:12] answered to caesar and and so they
[46:15] they by their own laws they accused
[46:17] jesus of blaspheme
[46:21] and doing works on the sabbath
[46:25] and those they accused the maker of the
[46:27] law
[46:28] of breaking the law
[46:32] oh the scripture said they were ignorant
[46:35] of who he was because if they would have
[46:38] known they would have
[46:39] never crucified the lord of glory
[46:42] let me tell you how wonderful and how
[46:46] blessed
[46:46] you are to have revelation because
[46:50] just think of the things that you would
[46:52] have done
[46:53] if you hadn't had eyes have if god
[46:56] didn't let you see
[46:57] think of the message you could have been
[46:59] in and the
[47:00] troubles that we could uh of god in but
[47:03] he even gave them he said they wouldn't
[47:05] have even done it if they would have
[47:08] known so
[47:10] we we come to this great
[47:14] event of the resurrection
[47:18] and why it's so important to us
[47:23] and so we read this statement
[47:26] he says but when this this is in
[47:31] paragraph 32 of
[47:34] the easter seal so
[47:38] everything that jesus talked about
[47:40] everything he told the people
[47:43] everything that he said to him it's the
[47:45] father's good pleasure
[47:46] to give you the kingdom everything that
[47:49] he said was hanging in the balance
[47:53] and all of a sudden it says but easter
[47:55] proved it
[47:57] it sealed the word of god
[48:00] forever for the true believer
[48:05] all gloom and doubt
[48:09] was shattered at that blissful morning
[48:14] man had been shut up
[48:17] as it was in a prison house
[48:21] even to religious people before this day
[48:26] because they had seen great
[48:30] religious moves and the moving
[48:34] of the holy spirit and so forth
[48:37] so that's what they'd seen they'd seen
[48:39] jesus they've seen the work
[48:42] they've they've heard and saw other
[48:44] great religious
[48:46] events and things take place and he said
[48:49] and so forth but when man died
[48:53] it seemed to settle it so for them it
[48:57] was always for a
[48:58] season someone would rise up
[49:01] and it was good for a season but when
[49:04] that person died
[49:05] that settled it in other words well
[49:07] that's the
[49:08] end of that it was
[49:11] it was good for a time you know what i
[49:14] mean but
[49:15] it it it's it's not gonna bear fruit
[49:18] anymore
[49:18] it's like we i we have an orange tree at
[49:21] my mom's house that thing produces
[49:23] oranges like
[49:24] you can't believe it but every year we
[49:27] come back
[49:28] and we're always wondering is it going
[49:29] to keep doing it
[49:31] is going to keep doing it because one
[49:32] day
[49:34] you know that tree's not going to live
[49:37] forever
[49:40] and that's what happened to people it
[49:42] was good for a season it was good for a
[49:45] time
[49:46] that's what what every but he's that no
[49:48] you we got to hold this little thought
[49:51] this morning
[49:53] so before we can start moving down this
[49:56] great line
[49:57] of this great seal so he said
[50:01] and it just seemed to settle it
[50:05] but when this one came
[50:08] he said i have power to lay my life down
[50:13] and i have power to take it up again
[50:17] and then go prove what he
[50:20] said to me that's
[50:24] the real seal of it when
[50:27] something is said and then
[50:30] it's turned around and proven
[50:33] so when he rose on that day it
[50:36] proved that everything he was talking
[50:40] about was real it didn't
[50:43] end with him it wasn't an idea that he
[50:46] had
[50:47] it wasn't something that that that
[50:51] like a great philosopher or or something
[50:54] he wasn't a
[50:55] religious einstein what he said
[50:58] was real in other words right in front
[51:02] of
[51:02] them he said he he proved
[51:06] that was what sealed so what's proved or
[51:09] sealed
[51:09] what he said was on that easter morning
[51:13] when he rose up now and then he told
[51:16] them
[51:17] go and wait because i will send you
[51:20] power from unhigh i
[51:24] he commissioned him go into all the
[51:26] world and preach the gospel
[51:29] and these signs shall follow you but
[51:32] wait
[51:32] and go into that upper room you wait
[51:35] there until
[51:36] you receive quickening power
[51:40] from on high until you receive the
[51:43] spirit
[51:44] the power of god in our lives
[51:48] and so then we read over there in
[51:51] paragraph
[51:51] 39 he said these signs
[51:56] he said in paragraph 39
[52:00] jesus said go ye there for
[52:03] teaching all nations and prove
[52:06] to them by demonstration the power of
[52:10] god to them
[52:12] these signs shall follow them that
[52:14] believe
[52:16] so he said go to him preach the gospel
[52:18] to him
[52:19] tell them the things that i told you he
[52:21] said
[52:22] and demonstrate the power of god to them
[52:31] these signs shall fall then that believe
[52:34] them who promised and said they believed
[52:39] he gave us a de a definite
[52:42] understanding of it these signs
[52:45] would follow them that believe
[52:48] it would be the proof of their testimony
[52:53] now we can say we believe but until
[52:57] we are have the proven
[53:01] sign that he said would be
[53:05] upon us then we are just confessing
[53:08] to believers and not
[53:11] the of believers
[53:16] so we believe but we don't possess it
[53:20] now you can get into all kinds of
[53:22] teachings about
[53:23] evidences we're not interested in
[53:26] evidences we're talking with an
[53:30] individual
[53:33] the individual has to know that he's
[53:36] received
[53:37] something from god signs and wonders
[53:41] come in many different ways
[53:45] it's not always miracles
[53:49] you know i've watched people who just as
[53:51] cool as a cucumber
[53:53] had somebody just say something to in
[53:56] their face
[53:57] and and i got so mad my hairs on my back
[54:01] are all standing up and i'm ready to go
[54:03] fight their fight for them
[54:07] you know and yet they just stand there
[54:11] and they take it just just calm and
[54:14] and and loving and forgiving
[54:18] and apologize and and just say i'm sorry
[54:22] you know i
[54:23] i didn't mean to do it whatever i can do
[54:25] to make it right
[54:26] i would do it and i'm back there saying
[54:28] it's their fault
[54:30] it's their fault you know it's like
[54:33] someone gets in a wreck or you bump into
[54:35] somebody
[54:36] you know the first thing you know it's
[54:38] their fault
[54:40] you know and no problem and i thought
[54:43] wow
[54:44] that's really a sign that that person
[54:46] has something
[54:48] amen you know because anybody can
[54:50] impersonate a gift
[54:52] but to really have that nature of that
[54:54] lord and the kindness and the forgiving
[54:57] spirit
[54:58] you know we always want the mighty signs
[55:01] but it's the it's the little foxes that
[55:04] spoil the vine
[55:05] it's the beautiful fruits that also make
[55:08] the vine stand out beautiful
[55:10] so that character of your life is a sign
[55:14] and a wonder it's a wonder today someone
[55:17] can be a christian
[55:18] in the midst of all this what we're
[55:21] living in so
[55:22] don't we all so many times get when it
[55:25] comes to signs and wonders we
[55:27] we just jump up and we think that it's
[55:30] this power
[55:31] it's not the power to
[55:34] do signs and do wonders because there's
[55:36] all kinds of impersonators
[55:40] it's your faith that produces the
[55:42] miracle it's not the person
[55:45] you know what i mean i could quote a
[55:47] bible scripture to you
[55:49] and and and say a few words that your
[55:52] faith anchors in that
[55:53] but faith's final resting place the word
[55:56] of god
[55:57] and when you act and accept the word of
[55:59] god you're going to get the results
[56:01] it doesn't have anything to do it was
[56:03] your faith that you
[56:04] touched the hem of his garment nobody
[56:08] touched the hem of the garment
[56:10] for you you have to touch the hem of his
[56:12] garment
[56:13] that's why these signs shall follow them
[56:15] that believe
[56:16] the signs were never something that was
[56:19] produced
[56:20] that's where pentecost taught it they
[56:22] thought it was a ministry it was
[56:24] something you would go produce a sheep
[56:26] bears wall
[56:28] these signs just happen around them they
[56:31] don't even
[56:31] they just they believe and they pray and
[56:34] they just
[56:35] they're just praying for someone the
[56:37] lord heal my mother
[56:38] lord help my friend i just hate to see
[56:41] him suffer
[56:42] and your heart is is is goes out to him
[56:46] and you're making intercession from your
[56:48] spirit
[56:49] the holy spirit making intercession
[56:51] within your heart and you're just
[56:53] praying and you're asking god
[56:55] and all of a sudden it comes to pass
[57:01] that's right you know he didn't come to
[57:04] prove that
[57:05] god was a healer he came to prove that
[57:09] god kept his word
[57:11] and by doing those signs and doing those
[57:14] wonders
[57:14] he said if if there wasn't a message
[57:17] that followed that
[57:18] then that wasn't of god he he proved and
[57:22] vindicated by signs and wonders
[57:24] the things that he was going to share
[57:26] with us and the things that he was going
[57:28] to speak to us were true
[57:30] but there was a lot of people praying
[57:32] for the sick
[57:35] pentecostal people have been praying for
[57:37] the sick for years
[57:39] and years and years god's a healer
[57:42] our messenger didn't make god a healer
[57:46] but what he did do is he exposed the son
[57:49] of perdition
[57:50] he exposed the lie lies in the bondage
[57:53] that he had people in and he revealed us
[57:56] the true unadulterated word of god
[57:59] because he was trying to prepare a
[58:01] people for a rapture
[58:06] we're not in a religious battle
[58:09] with every church and with everybody if
[58:12] someone's a christian
[58:13] i i thank god they're a christian
[58:18] i meet a lot of pastors when i'm out
[58:21] eating in restaurants and
[58:22] someone will say this is my pastor i say
[58:25] oh brother
[58:26] i'm praying for you i i feel for you
[58:30] you know okay and and i'm glad
[58:33] i'm glad they're trying to help people
[58:35] instead of
[58:38] you know robbing the bank or something
[58:44] so you know this isn't about
[58:49] us only that's right amen amen
[58:53] we live for everybody we're christians
[58:56] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[58:58] heart by the holy spirit
[59:00] we respect what people believe that's
[59:02] what
[59:03] they believe praise god
[59:07] but if god gives a my salve that their
[59:10] eyes can be opened praise god for that
[59:16] also but so
[59:18] it was a great proof so now he was going
[59:22] to give the church
[59:24] something that they
[59:27] also would have
[59:31] identifying power to
[59:34] prove that what they were saying was
[59:36] true
[59:39] they just couldn't always point back
[59:43] so they didn't want they weren't going
[59:44] to sit there and say well
[59:46] except jesus christ is your lord and
[59:48] savior
[59:49] because he did this and he did that
[59:53] their testimony was he came and he did
[59:57] this
[59:58] and the same spirit that was in him
[1:00:02] he promised to us i will not leave you
[1:00:06] comfortless
[1:00:07] but i'll come again and i'll be with you
[1:00:09] even in you till the end
[1:00:12] so he gave us a portion of
[1:00:15] his spirit that we could do
[1:00:19] the works that he did also
[1:00:22] so now our testimony is we're
[1:00:25] identified with the word that he kept
[1:00:29] so he preached the word he sealed it
[1:00:34] by his resurrection he proved that
[1:00:37] everything that he said he turned around
[1:00:40] and proved it
[1:00:41] that was the seal of it and now what he
[1:00:44] sealed his testimony with he was going
[1:00:48] to
[1:00:48] share with you that you could seal your
[1:00:51] testimony with it
[1:00:53] you could have the same spirit that he
[1:00:56] had
[1:00:57] praise the lord i will not leave you
[1:00:59] comfortless
[1:01:00] i will come again i will be with you
[1:01:03] until the end i will lead you and guide
[1:01:06] you
[1:01:06] into all truth and righteousness praise
[1:01:10] the lord
[1:01:10] that is the promise to every believer
[1:01:17] and then we realize that that that
[1:01:20] didn't just happen by
[1:01:22] circumstance or happenstance but it was
[1:01:25] absolutely by the predestinated
[1:01:28] will of god that there was a people
[1:01:32] that were planted in the earth the seeds
[1:01:35] of god
[1:01:36] were planted in the earth they were
[1:01:39] foreordained by
[1:01:40] god to receive this spirit
[1:01:45] amen else you would sit back in your
[1:01:48] logical mind
[1:01:50] and think everybody should have it
[1:01:55] why would anybody want to turn this down
[1:02:02] because they don't all see it
[1:02:05] but you see it
[1:02:08] don't let somebody talk you out of
[1:02:10] something you see
[1:02:16] i mean if you see it you see it
[1:02:19] just realize just because they can't see
[1:02:22] it
[1:02:23] that doesn't change who they are that's
[1:02:25] fine
[1:02:26] you don't see it i see it
[1:02:30] wait you know they'll just say no it
[1:02:32] doesn't exist it's not there
[1:02:34] it's not true that's fake i didn't read
[1:02:36] about it on
[1:02:37] wikipedia that's my source of all truth
[1:02:40] and knowledge
[1:02:45] you can't get this on wikipedia
[1:02:49] you can order this on amazon
[1:02:55] this is individual this is from god to
[1:02:58] you
[1:02:59] you and god god chose you god picked you
[1:03:03] and god seals you it's not
[1:03:06] you you're elected you're separated
[1:03:09] you're predestinated you
[1:03:12] you know i'd like to be like everybody
[1:03:14] else
[1:03:17] i know not too many people want to be
[1:03:19] like me but that's all right i'd like to
[1:03:21] you know
[1:03:21] i don't want to be different i want to
[1:03:23] be odd
[1:03:25] i don't like it when all of a sudden
[1:03:26] people are doing things and i can't
[1:03:28] stand it
[1:03:29] and i go why am i like this you know and
[1:03:31] then i read the other day the prophet of
[1:03:33] god's saying i'm just i get there and i
[1:03:35] say well god why did you make me like
[1:03:37] this
[1:03:37] why do i have to be this way why do i
[1:03:40] always
[1:03:40] why can't i just love everybody and
[1:03:42] everybody loved me why he's called
[1:03:45] he predestinated he's created different
[1:03:49] and that's one thing this bride has got
[1:03:51] to come to the realization to
[1:03:53] they are created differently
[1:03:58] different you got a different ear
[1:04:01] in you you've got a different heart in
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:04] you've got a different understanding in
[1:04:06] you
[1:04:08] you're different and that's why he
[1:04:11] expressed that to us
[1:04:15] in talking about the eagle in the
[1:04:17] barnyard
[1:04:18] he was a different bird
[1:04:22] that was given to us so we could
[1:04:25] understand
[1:04:26] that we were made equals to begin with
[1:04:29] and we could only hear an eagle scream
[1:04:32] and different people respond
[1:04:34] different to the voice
[1:04:40] they thought jesus was beelzebub
[1:04:44] they thought he blasphemed
[1:04:48] you blasphemed god
[1:04:52] well he's my father i only do what the
[1:04:55] father tells me to do
[1:04:59] heretic they saw this guy that couldn't
[1:05:02] stand him
[1:05:03] but a little woman at the well she said
[1:05:06] thou art the messiah
[1:05:08] the son of the living god
[1:05:11] we've got to come at peace with our
[1:05:14] election
[1:05:17] we can't be battling with our election
[1:05:22] and so we we understood that we were
[1:05:24] predestinated we were foreordained
[1:05:27] to fulfill this role there was a time he
[1:05:30] didn't put us at the day of pentecost
[1:05:32] he didn't put us at the time of
[1:05:34] justification if
[1:05:36] if if we were living in the time of
[1:05:39] justification
[1:05:40] we would have all been down at luther's
[1:05:42] meeting
[1:05:45] because we would have been the elect in
[1:05:48] the days of luther
[1:05:49] we would have been reading his edict we
[1:05:51] would have say no this isn't the literal
[1:05:53] body of blood
[1:05:54] we wouldn't be lighting candles aren't
[1:05:57] you glad that he put you in this
[1:05:59] age at the opening of the seals when
[1:06:01] there was some really good word of god
[1:06:04] how would you like to be that your
[1:06:06] revelation would just be
[1:06:08] i don't have to go into that room and
[1:06:10] confess my sins to that priest
[1:06:12] because my sins are forgiven by grace
[1:06:16] well if you were in that catholic
[1:06:18] bondage that message would have been
[1:06:20] life to you you would have been grateful
[1:06:22] for it
[1:06:23] but praise god he didn't pick you for
[1:06:25] that day
[1:06:26] he didn't pick you for the days of
[1:06:28] wesley he didn't pick you for the days
[1:06:30] of the restoration of death
[1:06:32] he picks you for this day because this
[1:06:35] day
[1:06:35] is raptured
[1:06:42] it's like anything in the great
[1:06:47] plan of god i may not be there
[1:06:51] at the time of the actual rapture
[1:06:55] but i'm a carrier of the rapture
[1:06:58] life i will carry that life and i will
[1:07:01] preach that gospel
[1:07:03] until it comes to those that are going
[1:07:06] to manifest
[1:07:07] that thing so i'm a part of it by being
[1:07:09] a carrier of it
[1:07:15] doesn't mean that that
[1:07:18] i've got to be there to be it
[1:07:22] that's not what this message is this
[1:07:25] message is to get us in rapturing
[1:07:27] condition
[1:07:29] now i'm a possessor of the rapture
[1:07:33] i'm not a believer in it i'm a possessor
[1:07:36] of it
[1:07:37] and i will carry that possession and
[1:07:39] pass that life
[1:07:40] off and pass that word off to whoever
[1:07:43] god will give me to hear it
[1:07:49] that's why you might go on but you'll
[1:07:51] leave it with your children
[1:07:56] but if i was just preaching
[1:07:57] justification that wouldn't get it there
[1:08:01] so don't worry that you're a part of the
[1:08:04] rapture
[1:08:05] being here for it doesn't mean i don't
[1:08:08] have to be here for it
[1:08:09] i know i've got it now this is what this
[1:08:12] message is about
[1:08:14] this is what we're going into 15 minutes
[1:08:16] into this morning
[1:08:18] and then he goes on and talks about our
[1:08:19] predestination and
[1:08:21] paragraph 63 he makes this statement
[1:08:23] it's the foreknowledge of god
[1:08:26] taking place god's word
[1:08:30] so we're understanding it's the
[1:08:31] foreknowledge of god taking place
[1:08:33] our position in time our position here
[1:08:39] you know i kept so many people sometimes
[1:08:41] just feel
[1:08:42] in their heart like well if i'm not here
[1:08:45] for the rapture i wasn't the bride
[1:08:49] i don't care how i get there
[1:08:52] i'm not going to die anyway
[1:08:56] you know everything they got today is
[1:08:58] pre this pre
[1:08:59] that you know my doctor found a little
[1:09:02] spot on me
[1:09:03] that's pre-cancerous you have to be
[1:09:05] checked every six weeks
[1:09:08] you know that's changing and then
[1:09:11] now every six months and now this you
[1:09:14] know
[1:09:16] i had an itch on my back i said doc i
[1:09:18] got a itch on my back he said why does
[1:09:20] the only reason it bothers me i can't
[1:09:22] reach it
[1:09:27] and some of you probably see me up
[1:09:28] against a brick wall
[1:09:30] like a dog with mange you know that
[1:09:32] thing just drives me nuts
[1:09:34] so i go there and i say you know doc i
[1:09:37] i'd like to look at that issue what do
[1:09:39] you think the first thing he does
[1:09:41] he lays me on the table and he goes gets
[1:09:43] this thing he takes two great big chunks
[1:09:45] of skin
[1:09:46] out of me i said what are you trying to
[1:09:49] do remove the itch all together
[1:09:52] no i'm making sure it's not cancer
[1:09:55] i'm not afraid of cancer
[1:10:01] you you understand i'm not afraid of
[1:10:03] death
[1:10:05] if the lord carries i may get old and
[1:10:09] wrinkled and stooped over
[1:10:10] whatever he chooses but this
[1:10:14] body is not my end
[1:10:20] so we understood and as we went through
[1:10:23] this message that it was the great
[1:10:25] uh the great thing and then he says so
[1:10:28] god
[1:10:29] in every age ordained his church for
[1:10:32] that age
[1:10:33] a message for that age
[1:10:37] and so we understand that that's what
[1:10:39] we're doing so we're just coming down
[1:10:41] looking at those things about how the
[1:10:44] seed had to be quickened
[1:10:46] and brought to life and then we came
[1:10:49] over
[1:10:49] and and he says he says notice you are
[1:10:52] now
[1:10:53] on your way growing to
[1:10:57] the full resurrection
[1:11:00] and and we understand that so we left
[1:11:03] off
[1:11:05] i believe on uh was at the end of
[1:11:08] paragraph
[1:11:09] uh 105 and so what he brought us up to
[1:11:14] this point
[1:11:16] and we're going to listen to 15 minutes
[1:11:18] so he's progressing it now
[1:11:22] okay for what that he gave us
[1:11:25] this quickening power for our
[1:11:28] age
[1:11:33] in luther's age those who got the
[1:11:37] quickening power
[1:11:38] came out of the catholic church
[1:11:42] and accepted justification
[1:11:47] and wesley's age they came out of that
[1:11:50] and they understood that they had to
[1:11:52] have they had to have
[1:11:54] holiness and be sanctified
[1:11:57] in luther's age it was eat drink and be
[1:12:00] merry because we have
[1:12:03] grace and lou there came wesley came
[1:12:06] home said no
[1:12:07] you've got to do all things in
[1:12:09] moderation and then we've come to our
[1:12:12] age
[1:12:12] we represent something else it it
[1:12:16] you know and we go through this subject
[1:12:19] matter
[1:12:20] not with just people i've talked to
[1:12:22] recently but all the years that i've
[1:12:24] been in ministry i went through this
[1:12:26] when i first became a christian
[1:12:28] with marijuana
[1:12:32] can't you just smoke in moderation
[1:12:37] you know and every excuse and thing
[1:12:41] but that's not what you go by if the
[1:12:44] spirit of god's in you
[1:12:46] it will quicken you'll find out that
[1:12:49] all things are lawful but all things
[1:12:51] aren't expedient
[1:12:52] he because you ought to remember we're
[1:12:55] not just
[1:12:56] called to obedience to a law
[1:12:59] we have a nazarite vow this
[1:13:02] this this bride has a different
[1:13:06] vowel she has a different vowel with her
[1:13:09] husband
[1:13:10] a different a nazarite vow is separating
[1:13:13] from the appearance of evil
[1:13:15] separating from the things of the world
[1:13:17] it's not
[1:13:18] it's not that i can't do this i can't do
[1:13:21] that that's not we're led by there's no
[1:13:23] more
[1:13:24] law we're not under the law but those
[1:13:26] that are
[1:13:27] under the spirit are led by the spirit
[1:13:31] and that's where that's where things
[1:13:33] begin to understand that
[1:13:35] this isn't something a religion that
[1:13:38] we're trying to
[1:13:38] fit with every other religion or every
[1:13:41] other doctrine this is an elected call
[1:13:45] this is a proposal
[1:13:49] from the bridegroom to his bride
[1:13:53] will you marry me
[1:13:58] even they asked him he said i'll not
[1:13:59] drink any more
[1:14:01] of this till i eat it with you in the
[1:14:03] kingdom
[1:14:04] now that's where our union is it's with
[1:14:08] him
[1:14:08] and so we're going to pick up here on
[1:14:11] paragraph
[1:14:12] uh 106
[1:14:15] and he's talking to the pentecostals
[1:14:18] about
[1:14:20] about how they never went far enough
[1:14:24] but let's just listen to minutes and
[1:14:28] and and it's it's like i said it's just
[1:14:30] 15 minutes
[1:14:32] and then we'll close right up so god
[1:14:35] bless you
[1:14:36] as we're going through this message
[1:14:37] slowly the message that follows this
[1:14:40] next one we're going to go into
[1:14:42] is called the rising of the sun and then
[1:14:45] we're just going to take them
[1:14:46] all the way through 65.
[1:14:51] we're going to find out what's in that
[1:14:53] storehouse
[1:14:54] what are the things that we've read over
[1:14:56] and walked over
[1:14:57] for so many years so let's just take
[1:14:59] this 15 minutes
[1:15:01] as we advance farther and uh
[1:15:04] and so lord richly bless you
[1:15:08] this morning as our messenger speaks to
[1:15:10] us the next few minutes
[1:15:13] now but when they went up to pentecost
[1:15:16] there they received the quickening power
[1:15:20] the power that made them alive now
[1:15:22] there's where i think that your
[1:15:24] presbyterian and methodist brother you
[1:15:26] do receive potentially on believing on
[1:15:28] the lord jesus christ
[1:15:30] but the abstract hasn't come yet
[1:15:34] that's the clearing of the deed god gave
[1:15:37] abraham a
[1:15:38] promise abraham believed god and it was
[1:15:40] imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:15:42] but he sealed the covenant by the seal
[1:15:45] of circumcision
[1:15:48] and god gives you a promise potentially
[1:15:50] yet you will receive it
[1:15:52] and you're going to be raised up this
[1:15:53] body is going to be glorified
[1:15:55] with him in the end time but you see you
[1:15:57] have to get a clearance on that
[1:15:59] deed and the clearance is when every
[1:16:03] thing against it has been stricken off
[1:16:07] and you got the abstract to it you've
[1:16:09] got the seal
[1:16:11] it's yours everything's on it belongs to
[1:16:14] you
[1:16:16] amen and when we believe on jesus christ
[1:16:19] for our savior
[1:16:21] and repented or baptized and come up to
[1:16:24] believing
[1:16:24] god recognizes our repentance and our
[1:16:27] faith towards him
[1:16:29] and sends down the abstract
[1:16:32] and the abstract is the assurance
[1:16:35] it's a guarantee that everything was
[1:16:38] ever held against you
[1:16:40] you thoroughly repented amen
[1:16:43] hallelujah and the property is bolton
[1:16:47] and you hold the abstract for the
[1:16:49] assurance let somebody try to put you
[1:16:51] off the land say he belongs in your
[1:16:52] abstract in your hand
[1:16:54] let him try to do then along the land
[1:16:56] can do it
[1:16:57] because you hold the abstract and
[1:17:00] there's
[1:17:01] no devil no church or any
[1:17:04] theology that can overstep the
[1:17:07] boundaries
[1:17:08] of god's proof and abstract that the
[1:17:10] baptism of the holy ghost has recognized
[1:17:13] us
[1:17:13] in jesus christ amen we're just as sure
[1:17:17] to raise us
[1:17:18] he raised because potentially we have
[1:17:21] already
[1:17:22] raised in him amen
[1:17:25] hey man the old things what does it do
[1:17:27] to our moral bodies
[1:17:29] it turns our opinions changes our
[1:17:32] notions
[1:17:33] it sets our affections on things which
[1:17:35] are above
[1:17:36] and the smoking drinking cannon the
[1:17:39] things that you used to do it
[1:17:40] is dead it's beneath you and you are
[1:17:44] quickened and this quickening power
[1:17:47] brings
[1:17:48] your body into a raptured condition
[1:17:52] amen already notice the pentecostal
[1:17:55] people up there
[1:17:56] when they got quickened by the holy
[1:17:58] spirit listen to me
[1:18:01] when those pentecostal group up there on
[1:18:04] the day of pentecost
[1:18:06] receive their abstract deed from god
[1:18:09] surely glorify their souls they screamed
[1:18:12] they saw
[1:18:13] tongues of fire separated upon each of
[1:18:15] them
[1:18:16] and it's so quick in their body until
[1:18:19] they couldn't even speak an earthly
[1:18:20] language anymore
[1:18:22] it quickened their body to heavenly
[1:18:24] language
[1:18:27] the place they're going to quickening
[1:18:30] power of god shook their mortal bodies
[1:18:33] so till their
[1:18:34] entire mortal language was transfigured
[1:18:38] transformed into an immortal language
[1:18:42] what a quicken in power what's something
[1:18:46] it belongs
[1:18:46] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[1:18:49] the dead
[1:18:50] dwells in your mortal bodies it shall
[1:18:53] also
[1:18:54] quicken your immortal bodies we are
[1:18:57] quickened then by the power of the
[1:18:59] living god
[1:19:00] tongues quicken to a new heavenly
[1:19:03] language
[1:19:04] to speak to them are rapturing up
[1:19:06] raising up into a
[1:19:08] different atmosphere than what they'd
[1:19:09] ever lived in also with the new
[1:19:12] quickening life
[1:19:13] to them that come in them it quickened
[1:19:16] their language
[1:19:17] they spoke in new tongues oh yes
[1:19:20] now watch them um
[1:19:23] it also was designed to give them
[1:19:28] as this abstract it was designed to give
[1:19:31] them
[1:19:32] every promise that was on the grounds
[1:19:37] every promise on the grounds of god's
[1:19:40] word
[1:19:41] that was promised in the bible that
[1:19:44] quickening power
[1:19:45] was given to them to quicken that
[1:19:48] promise to them
[1:19:51] therefore they laid hands on the sick
[1:19:53] they were sealed
[1:19:55] they spoke in new tongues they done
[1:19:58] great signs and wonders
[1:19:59] because that was in god's promise
[1:20:03] and when jesus died to redeem that back
[1:20:06] to them the grounds that belonged to
[1:20:08] sons of god
[1:20:09] he demonstrated what god was how
[1:20:12] dare we to socialize that and put it
[1:20:14] into an organization
[1:20:16] we have no rights to do that it's the
[1:20:19] holy spirit today
[1:20:20] hunting out honest hearts that will
[1:20:22] believe that message
[1:20:25] everything in the bible that was
[1:20:26] promised is to that believer
[1:20:29] and when you accept it in its fullness
[1:20:31] and god knows that you'll do it
[1:20:33] he gives you the abstract to that
[1:20:36] and then every promise is made is in
[1:20:38] your possession and the
[1:20:40] holy spirit starts to quicken that to
[1:20:42] you thank you
[1:20:43] oh my what kind of people should we be
[1:20:47] how wonderful to see that god's great
[1:20:50] holy spirit here to do that power
[1:20:52] think of it when the holy ghost itself
[1:20:55] you're in a bear record of this hour
[1:20:58] amen
[1:20:59] jesus said so he's the same yesterday
[1:21:02] today and forever
[1:21:04] how dare any man to wipe that out
[1:21:07] what works that i do shall you do also
[1:21:09] john 14 12
[1:21:11] these signs shall follow them that
[1:21:13] believe that
[1:21:15] is the assurance when we see a group of
[1:21:17] people
[1:21:18] sitting together in those signs
[1:21:20] manifesting themselves that's the
[1:21:21] assurance that the abstract desire to
[1:21:24] vindicate that that's property of god
[1:21:27] amen
[1:21:28] amen so we are easter also
[1:21:31] amen we are now in our easter we've
[1:21:34] already
[1:21:35] raised hallelujah from the things of the
[1:21:38] world to the things of god's promise
[1:21:40] amen not we will we are
[1:21:44] it's the potentials it's god's promise
[1:21:46] he'd pour out his spirit in the last
[1:21:47] days
[1:21:48] and that's what they would do notice
[1:21:51] lay their hands on the sick everything
[1:21:53] was in god's promise
[1:21:55] i shall wear out my spirit the last days
[1:21:57] upon all flesh
[1:21:59] your old man shall dream dreams your
[1:22:01] young men should see visions and all
[1:22:02] these different promises that he made
[1:22:04] everything's laying right there in god's
[1:22:06] promise jesus redeemed it to us
[1:22:09] and when we become are we if we are
[1:22:11] ordained
[1:22:12] on that ground if we are
[1:22:16] ordained to be on that ground like the
[1:22:19] eagle walking in the chicken's nest
[1:22:21] amen if you're ordained on that ground
[1:22:23] the holy spirit is sure to find you
[1:22:27] amen and when it finds it you'll
[1:22:29] recognize this call
[1:22:31] you know the hour you're living you know
[1:22:34] these things are supposed to happen
[1:22:35] quickly you're raptured up to meet it
[1:22:38] and now you're sitting in heavenly
[1:22:39] places in christ jesus
[1:22:41] oh what a promise what a heavenly father
[1:22:45] who would give us these things
[1:22:47] the spirit quickens their fellowship
[1:22:49] with god so that they call
[1:22:52] the dead back to life in that day they
[1:22:55] laid their bodies up on the dead they
[1:22:57] come to life
[1:22:58] listen closely they've done the same
[1:23:01] things that jesus did because the same
[1:23:03] spirit was upon him was upon them
[1:23:06] if one spirit makes a man act this way
[1:23:08] it makes the other neck that way
[1:23:10] if one how can this come upon say he's
[1:23:12] got the spirit of god and deny the works
[1:23:14] of god
[1:23:14] amen cannot do it notice god's
[1:23:18] life which is in the greek called zoe
[1:23:22] moving through them and in them
[1:23:25] quicken their minds to his word amen
[1:23:30] now let me say it real quietly
[1:23:33] the spirit of god
[1:23:36] that moves among the people quickens the
[1:23:40] mind
[1:23:40] of the person to the promise
[1:23:44] of god see it does it
[1:23:47] look i'm trying to show you
[1:23:50] the the let you realize that i'm
[1:23:53] speaking out of the church
[1:23:54] and also quicken to life in him
[1:23:57] although uh they only
[1:24:01] or was his attributes to begin with but
[1:24:04] if god said
[1:24:05] in this day back in the beginning john
[1:24:08] doe
[1:24:09] will be my servant millions of years ago
[1:24:15] now john doe's born in sin shaped in
[1:24:17] iniquity comes the world speaking last
[1:24:19] because he's immortal
[1:24:21] but maybe he gets a little religious
[1:24:23] feeling he'll go join a church
[1:24:25] maybe he'll join pentecostal church
[1:24:27] don't know
[1:24:28] he might join anything but let him get
[1:24:31] under the atmosphere of god once
[1:24:33] see john doe is bound to recognize
[1:24:37] who his father is just as that eagle
[1:24:39] recognized who the mother was
[1:24:41] it's got to realize it see only
[1:24:45] that john doe is god's attribute
[1:24:48] that's become a word spoken and then the
[1:24:52] holy spirit seeks that word out
[1:24:54] here it is he calls him gives him
[1:24:56] everlasting life and brings him into the
[1:24:59] presence of god
[1:25:00] god's word look god had the same
[1:25:04] when he saw jesus it was it was a
[1:25:07] finished work
[1:25:08] that god finished with jesus when he
[1:25:10] said it's finished all the plan
[1:25:12] was finished and when the spirit of god
[1:25:14] comes upon you
[1:25:16] and you truly are one of god's
[1:25:18] attributes
[1:25:19] that he's spoken of now if you're not
[1:25:22] you'll wander and flusterate and run
[1:25:24] here and there and
[1:25:25] everything else and never come to the
[1:25:27] knowledge of the truth
[1:25:29] if you are one of those the old things
[1:25:33] pass away right quick see and you become
[1:25:36] new and the
[1:25:37] plan of salvation is finished you're
[1:25:39] ready to obey every word that god ever
[1:25:41] spoke of you
[1:25:42] see for you to do you're submissive to
[1:25:45] his word the contract exactly the
[1:25:49] abstract to the contract the title deed
[1:25:51] belongs to you the debts are all paid
[1:25:54] it's all struck off
[1:25:56] and as it was at the day of pentecost
[1:25:59] now
[1:25:59] let us notice the quickness quickening
[1:26:02] spirit
[1:26:03] on other people now i told you you
[1:26:06] wouldn't speak very long and i just got
[1:26:08] 20 minutes to keep my word if i do that
[1:26:11] notice the keeper one time i said about
[1:26:13] about an
[1:26:14] hour notice now
[1:26:18] this quickening power
[1:26:21] that only comes now there's a lot of
[1:26:24] mockery of it
[1:26:25] there's a lot of people that really
[1:26:26] think they got it when they haven't
[1:26:30] a lot of people do it because they've
[1:26:32] got some false
[1:26:34] impression of what they've seen other
[1:26:37] christians do
[1:26:38] satan can impersonate any of that we
[1:26:41] know that in his missionaries you can
[1:26:42] see it impersonated shouting
[1:26:44] dancing speaking in tongues all these
[1:26:46] things you can impersonate anywhere
[1:26:49] absolutely amongst heathens and people
[1:26:50] who deny there is a
[1:26:52] such a thing as jesus christ being the
[1:26:53] son of god see and they do
[1:26:55] all those things themselves but the real
[1:26:58] true quickening spirit that comes to
[1:27:00] believer
[1:27:01] quickens him to god's word that's back
[1:27:04] to eagle food again
[1:27:05] right back to where he lives man shall
[1:27:07] not live by bread alone but by
[1:27:09] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:27:12] mouth of god
[1:27:13] let us now notice this quickly spirit as
[1:27:15] it come up on other people like it did
[1:27:17] on on the day of pentecost let's notice
[1:27:20] pentecost how they acted and see if they
[1:27:22] were quickened by this
[1:27:23] quickening power that we're talking
[1:27:24] about on the day of pentecost they were
[1:27:27] all waiting up there
[1:27:29] in themselves they were afraid the jews
[1:27:32] what they were going to do so they got
[1:27:34] scared but what happened
[1:27:35] when this quickening power fell from
[1:27:38] heaven there was a bravery set up on
[1:27:40] them
[1:27:41] there was something an understanding
[1:27:44] worthy wasn't too sure of it
[1:27:46] a few hours before they know he had
[1:27:49] he died they know he had risen then i
[1:27:52] talked to him on the way but was that
[1:27:54] thing for them or was it just for them
[1:27:56] for jesus himself but here on the day of
[1:27:59] pentecost
[1:28:00] the holy spirit the abstract fell upon
[1:28:03] the believers that made
[1:28:05] them part of his resurrection
[1:28:10] made him part of his fellowship
[1:28:13] the holy spirit came and confirmed to
[1:28:16] them that they
[1:28:17] would be raised up because they were
[1:28:19] potentially
[1:28:20] raised in from cowards to brave man
[1:28:24] they were they were afraid of the very
[1:28:27] word that they
[1:28:28] thought don't let this pass over you
[1:28:31] they were afraid they
[1:28:32] know that he was that word even the jews
[1:28:35] had to admit it
[1:28:36] nicodemus said rabbi we know that you're
[1:28:39] a
[1:28:40] teacher that come from god no man that
[1:28:42] could do the things you do
[1:28:43] except god be with him now we know that
[1:28:46] we recognize that
[1:28:48] so the disciples peter had even sworn in
[1:28:50] his presence
[1:28:52] all of them had forsaken him at the
[1:28:53] crucifixion
[1:28:55] but here they are now up in this upper
[1:28:57] room
[1:28:58] in the presence of god then all of a
[1:29:01] sudden
[1:29:01] here come this holy spirit down from
[1:29:04] heaven
[1:29:05] and he quickened them and the quickening
[1:29:08] took place
[1:29:09] they wasn't afraid to make a witness of
[1:29:12] the message that they believed to
[1:29:14] know to be the truth otherwise they were
[1:29:17] afraid of it
[1:29:27] sitting here going wow you know
[1:29:30] uh i mean it's it's
[1:29:33] marvelous you know when you
[1:29:36] when you you think about it i just
[1:29:40] i just want to
[1:29:45] make a couple comments and then we'll
[1:29:47] visit uh this
[1:29:48] again when we come to another service
[1:29:52] uh some of the things that were in here
[1:29:56] but uh you understand when he uses the
[1:29:59] word
[1:30:00] abstract that that is proof of
[1:30:04] possession
[1:30:05] so when he says abstract he's also
[1:30:08] talking about that
[1:30:09] baptism that quickening power that thing
[1:30:12] that he
[1:30:13] sends you because he recognizes what
[1:30:16] you've done that you've repented
[1:30:18] you've heard the word you've you've said
[1:30:21] these things so now he's going to give
[1:30:23] you
[1:30:23] something that that seals you
[1:30:27] but he you when you see that
[1:30:31] that god always works in
[1:30:34] the same way and i just want to touch on
[1:30:38] this little part of it for a second
[1:30:41] is that god always gives
[1:30:44] the believer something to believe
[1:30:48] he gave abraham something
[1:30:51] to believe a promise so if
[1:30:55] it never everywhere down the line
[1:30:58] every time god's been a deal with the
[1:31:01] believers
[1:31:02] he bring gives them a promise something
[1:31:05] to believe
[1:31:06] so he gave abraham he said you're going
[1:31:09] to have a son
[1:31:11] abra him said impossible he said no
[1:31:14] come here the promise just wasn't that
[1:31:18] abraham would have a son
[1:31:20] his promise was that his lineage would
[1:31:23] be like the stars
[1:31:27] okay that every place that he set his
[1:31:31] foot
[1:31:31] it would be his possession as far as he
[1:31:34] could see
[1:31:35] so the promise that he gave abraham to
[1:31:38] believe
[1:31:39] was always something supernatural
[1:31:43] it was something that wasn't in the
[1:31:45] mainstream the
[1:31:47] uh the just the stream of of what was
[1:31:51] possible
[1:31:55] then that wouldn't require anything that
[1:31:57] would require
[1:31:58] education that would require logic
[1:32:02] that would require something that you
[1:32:05] could prove
[1:32:06] with your senses or with your reasoning
[1:32:09] so god
[1:32:10] always gives the believer something
[1:32:12] beyond
[1:32:13] reasoning to test whether that
[1:32:16] seed is in there so that seed is
[1:32:19] something that god
[1:32:20] put in you that allows you to believe
[1:32:23] something beyond reason now let me tell
[1:32:27] you something the rapture
[1:32:29] is beyond reason
[1:32:33] especially when you look in the mirror
[1:32:38] because you know everything about you
[1:32:40] everything who you are
[1:32:41] what you really think all your secret
[1:32:43] mistakes
[1:32:45] everything you're battling because
[1:32:46] satan's trying to chew on you every day
[1:32:49] you just sit back and say i can't make
[1:32:52] this
[1:32:56] he always gives something to believe
[1:32:58] when jesus came
[1:33:01] he gave them something supernatural to
[1:33:04] believe
[1:33:06] they had the belief that he was the son
[1:33:08] of god
[1:33:09] in other words his father was not living
[1:33:12] on the earth
[1:33:16] that's pretty
[1:33:19] now could you imagine if one of us
[1:33:21] popped up and said that
[1:33:27] you know but he proved his father was
[1:33:30] into this earth
[1:33:34] but god always gives the believer
[1:33:37] something to believe
[1:33:40] now we're just going to
[1:33:43] close here so he's always done that he's
[1:33:46] always given the believer
[1:33:48] something that for them to believe
[1:33:52] that separates them from everything else
[1:33:56] he puts the seed in them
[1:34:01] that they find there's something in
[1:34:03] there
[1:34:04] that believes it and
[1:34:08] and they they they don't
[1:34:11] and they don't even uh they don't even
[1:34:14] understand
[1:34:16] and that's why i love this statement
[1:34:21] so much i think it was
[1:34:25] he said this he says although they only
[1:34:28] was his attributes to begin with
[1:34:31] but if god said in this day
[1:34:34] back in the beginning john doe
[1:34:37] will be my servant
[1:34:41] right so if god said that
[1:34:44] he foreordained that so if you got to
[1:34:47] understand that
[1:34:48] seed you know we think seed we think
[1:34:50] it's like little
[1:34:51] something right but the spoken word
[1:34:55] is the original seed so the minute god
[1:34:58] said back in the beginning
[1:35:00] that john doe will be my servant
[1:35:03] that word that he spoke
[1:35:07] is the seed it's the foreknowledge
[1:35:10] that's got to come to pass
[1:35:12] it's not like you possess a little
[1:35:15] uh thing in there
[1:35:19] okay the seed is the word
[1:35:23] the seed is the predestinated
[1:35:25] foreknowledge of god coming to pass
[1:35:28] so what happened to john doe john doe
[1:35:32] god foreordained put that seed in his
[1:35:36] heart
[1:35:36] that he would hear it that he'd be his
[1:35:39] servant
[1:35:41] so now that's there and so
[1:35:44] that's working in john doe he says even
[1:35:47] though he's born to sinner
[1:35:49] and shaped in iniquity come into the
[1:35:51] world speaking lies because he's mortal
[1:35:57] all right but god still got his will
[1:35:59] that he spoke
[1:36:00] he says he's he's mortal he said
[1:36:05] and and he gets a little religious
[1:36:08] feeling
[1:36:10] and you'll go join church maybe join
[1:36:13] pentecostal church
[1:36:14] don't know he might join anything
[1:36:17] but let him get under the atmosphere of
[1:36:21] god once
[1:36:22] see john doe is bound to recognize who
[1:36:26] his father is
[1:36:28] just as the eagle recognized who his
[1:36:30] mother was
[1:36:32] it's got to realize it see only
[1:36:35] that john doe is god's attribute that's
[1:36:39] because
[1:36:40] a word spoken and then
[1:36:43] the holy spirit seeks out that
[1:36:47] word here it is he calls
[1:36:50] him gives him everlasting life and
[1:36:53] brings him into the presence
[1:36:55] of god's word so he at every age
[1:36:59] he's got he's he's got the promise
[1:37:03] and he said the spirit of god comes upon
[1:37:05] you
[1:37:06] and you truly are one of god's
[1:37:09] attributes
[1:37:10] if you're not you'll wander and frost
[1:37:13] frustration run here and there and
[1:37:16] everything
[1:37:17] else and never come to the knowledge of
[1:37:20] the truth
[1:37:21] he said but if you are one of those the
[1:37:25] old things pass away right quick
[1:37:28] and see and you become new and the plan
[1:37:31] of salvation
[1:37:33] is finished so the promise of god
[1:37:37] he gives the promise he gives the
[1:37:39] promise
[1:37:40] for every believer to believe
[1:37:44] and then he foreordains the believer to
[1:37:47] believe it
[1:37:49] and then he sends his spirit to find
[1:37:53] that
[1:37:54] believer and to quicken that
[1:37:57] word to them so when you begin to
[1:38:00] understand he says now we can see
[1:38:02] fully our journey in life you can start
[1:38:05] looking at yourself
[1:38:07] you look at how you come it didn't
[1:38:08] matter if you were born
[1:38:11] in a family that believed it
[1:38:16] it was only my children who were born
[1:38:18] angels
[1:38:25] no they were born in sin too
[1:38:30] shaped in iniquity came into the world
[1:38:33] speaking lies i
[1:38:34] guarantee that
[1:38:39] they were mortal
[1:38:44] but if that promise was there for him
[1:38:46] that spirit will find them
[1:38:50] so we we as we just
[1:38:53] he he says so the believers
[1:38:57] always given something to them
[1:39:01] that that they can believe in
[1:39:04] so now he gives this quickening power
[1:39:08] so we and what i want to try to break
[1:39:10] our minds from
[1:39:12] is the quickening power only
[1:39:15] for the realm of carnal
[1:39:19] carnal manifestation
[1:39:23] okay because we've been taught so long
[1:39:26] that pentecost if we have this
[1:39:27] quickening power we should out be doing
[1:39:30] works we should outbeat
[1:39:31] the miracles we should go to the
[1:39:33] hospital and do this
[1:39:34] but now we are moving in to a different
[1:39:38] time and a different age this
[1:39:41] quickening power now is the proof and
[1:39:45] the seal
[1:39:46] that you are part of the resurrection
[1:39:50] that's what brother bam starting to talk
[1:39:52] about in this
[1:39:53] first uh a few
[1:39:56] this last eight minutes uh
[1:40:00] that we we just listened to so
[1:40:03] we we see this he says this is paragraph
[1:40:06] 116. now watch them
[1:40:08] it also was designed to give them
[1:40:12] after this abstract right
[1:40:15] after they received this holy spirit
[1:40:18] after
[1:40:19] they received this promise when did the
[1:40:21] promise come
[1:40:22] they heard the word of god they repented
[1:40:25] of their sins
[1:40:26] now he sent that to
[1:40:29] show you that he's accepted you
[1:40:34] and accepted your forgiveness
[1:40:37] don't think you won't be tempted
[1:40:42] jesus was the son of god and he was
[1:40:44] tempted in every way that we're tempted
[1:40:48] and sometimes you fall the temptation
[1:40:51] but you're quick to say abba father
[1:40:54] you're quick to after repentance
[1:40:56] and bring it under the blood
[1:41:00] he said it was designed to give them
[1:41:03] every promise that was on
[1:41:06] the grounds so it's designed to give you
[1:41:10] every promise
[1:41:11] so it's also designed to give you the
[1:41:14] promise
[1:41:15] of malachi 4 5 luke 37
[1:41:19] 7 30 and revelations 10 7.
[1:41:22] those are promises that god made
[1:41:29] you understand that yes sir they're just
[1:41:32] the same as the promises of healing
[1:41:36] of deliverance of all the other faiths
[1:41:39] he said it wasn't
[1:41:41] this group of promises now this is what
[1:41:44] verbatim is starting to preach to these
[1:41:45] pentecostal people
[1:41:47] it's not only this group of promises
[1:41:49] he's proved that
[1:41:51] he showed that to be true he
[1:41:53] demonstrated i've been demonstrating
[1:41:56] that to you for the last years
[1:41:58] but there's also the promise of the
[1:42:00] opening of the seals
[1:42:01] the revealing of the word the promise of
[1:42:04] the ministry of the son of man
[1:42:06] that the believer knows
[1:42:11] he's trying to take us from the looking
[1:42:15] and believing in a rapture to
[1:42:17] understanding that we possess
[1:42:19] it
[1:42:22] that that spirit's in us
[1:42:26] and it's going to perform what it was
[1:42:30] given to perform
[1:42:33] if we were in another age we would look
[1:42:36] at that
[1:42:38] that quickening power and think i've got
[1:42:41] to go out with this quickening power
[1:42:43] and spread this gospel
[1:42:46] i've got to go do these signs of wonders
[1:42:49] but that's
[1:42:50] not why the believer has to have this
[1:42:53] quickening power in
[1:42:54] our age the reason we've got to possess
[1:42:57] this in our age
[1:42:58] because it's what's going to quicken us
[1:43:01] transform us change us that's what we're
[1:43:04] looking for that power to do
[1:43:06] we're looking for that power to bring us
[1:43:09] into rapturing conditions
[1:43:11] rapturing place
[1:43:14] we're not given to vindicate
[1:43:17] it
[1:43:21] remember the spirit quickens the word
[1:43:26] the word doesn't quicken the spirit so
[1:43:28] when you come to the place well
[1:43:30] i've got to go do these kinds of wonders
[1:43:33] they're trying to make the word
[1:43:36] quicken the spirit but if you get the
[1:43:40] spirit
[1:43:42] then that spirit is here to do what it's
[1:43:45] supposed to do
[1:43:46] and what the spirit is here to do in
[1:43:49] this
[1:43:50] hour is not revive pentecost
[1:43:54] the spirit in this hour is here to
[1:43:57] take the pride out
[1:44:01] oh i hope i can make that clear somehow
[1:44:07] we get looking that's what we're looking
[1:44:10] for
[1:44:12] when we get on track with that all these
[1:44:14] other signs and wonders will follow
[1:44:21] if if you're for ordained to be in there
[1:44:23] the sister gave the
[1:44:25] testimony he didn't have time to have
[1:44:26] her give it we'll try another day that
[1:44:28] god
[1:44:29] spared her from a car accident
[1:44:33] you know praise god he does that
[1:44:37] well you you know if she's if she's
[1:44:39] elected to be a part of that
[1:44:42] the performing of that spoken word of
[1:44:45] the transformation from this earth
[1:44:47] amen no car accident going to take her
[1:44:53] so that's why so what did that spirit
[1:44:56] give them
[1:44:57] it gave them the absolute proof
[1:45:01] right so they believe every promise that
[1:45:03] quickening power was given to them to
[1:45:06] quicken that promise to them
[1:45:08] therefore they lay hands on the sick was
[1:45:10] healed they spoke in new tongues they
[1:45:12] done
[1:45:12] great signs and wonders because it was
[1:45:15] god's promise
[1:45:16] and when jesus died to redeem them back
[1:45:20] on the grounds that they belong sons of
[1:45:22] god he demonstrated it was god
[1:45:25] and it's the holy spirit today
[1:45:28] hunting out honest hearts that will
[1:45:31] believe
[1:45:32] that message everything in the bible
[1:45:35] that was promised to the believer and
[1:45:38] you accept it
[1:45:40] in its fullness and god knows that
[1:45:44] you will do it all the promise
[1:45:48] so it it we we don't want to get
[1:45:54] so narrow on our thinking of this
[1:45:58] quickening power
[1:45:59] and this quickening power only has one
[1:46:03] purpose and that is to get me to produce
[1:46:06] signs and wonders
[1:46:08] the quickening power is going to get you
[1:46:11] to believe
[1:46:13] the promise of your day abraham believed
[1:46:16] he was going to have a son
[1:46:18] by the quickening power
[1:46:24] the disciples believed that jesus was
[1:46:27] was the messiah
[1:46:29] the son of the living god who do you say
[1:46:31] that i am
[1:46:32] thou art the son of the living god flesh
[1:46:34] and blood didn't reveal this to you
[1:46:37] my father which in heaven has quickened
[1:46:40] that to you and that's what i found that
[1:46:44] the enemy does
[1:46:46] all the time he changes the definition
[1:46:49] of a word
[1:46:53] he puts power to mean miracles
[1:46:58] he he is quickening him he that becomes
[1:47:02] a sensation
[1:47:06] it he takes the believer and
[1:47:10] he tries to get him out on the goose
[1:47:12] chase
[1:47:13] for them to try to to manufacture
[1:47:16] something
[1:47:20] so if we thought a good meeting was just
[1:47:22] some real excitement and shouting
[1:47:24] then we would have to do the things that
[1:47:26] would produce that
[1:47:29] well we're i don't care who would me i
[1:47:31] love you want to shout i love shouting
[1:47:34] i've shouted myself i love praising god
[1:47:36] i love worshiping god
[1:47:38] but the understanding of that quickening
[1:47:41] power
[1:47:42] in the hour that we live in is for that
[1:47:44] we
[1:47:45] know because we have this promise
[1:47:49] because we've had this quickening power
[1:47:52] that we are going to be translated
[1:48:01] we understand what it's what it's given
[1:48:04] uh to us for
[1:48:07] we're ordained to this ground
[1:48:12] he gave you the power of that quickening
[1:48:17] he says though you haven't been changed
[1:48:19] yet
[1:48:20] you possess it
[1:48:25] by receiving the abstract
[1:48:29] so in our hour when we receive what they
[1:48:33] in that day called the baptism of the
[1:48:35] holy spirit
[1:48:36] to go out and prove their testimony that
[1:48:40] that was given to them that power in our
[1:48:43] day is giving to us to prove
[1:48:47] that the rapture is true
[1:48:54] you may never do a miracle though you
[1:48:57] believe in them
[1:48:58] but that's not the miracle you want to
[1:49:00] be a part of
[1:49:03] because how many people do you think
[1:49:04] prophet of god prayed for
[1:49:06] that we're well how many of you you
[1:49:09] think are still living
[1:49:15] that's not what we want to possess we
[1:49:18] want to know
[1:49:20] when those disciples went into the
[1:49:23] grave because every single one of them
[1:49:26] went into the grave
[1:49:30] but they went into the grave knowing
[1:49:33] that they
[1:49:34] possessed something that would take them
[1:49:40] out
[1:49:42] so so now that's
[1:49:45] what the the challenge of this
[1:49:49] hour is to believe
[1:49:52] the promise that god's made
[1:49:57] to believe that there's a rapture fixing
[1:49:59] to happen
[1:50:00] all the signs of the world are getting
[1:50:02] close like i said
[1:50:04] i may not be here
[1:50:07] when it happens i'm not worried about
[1:50:09] that because
[1:50:11] i can know now that i possess
[1:50:15] that resurrection already in me
[1:50:18] and it will finish its work it'll take
[1:50:21] it out
[1:50:23] it'll go but it's a very real
[1:50:26] possibility
[1:50:27] that some of you could be here
[1:50:32] when something that's unthinkable
[1:50:35] takes place
[1:50:41] people coming up missing
[1:50:46] so i'm not worried about the grave
[1:50:51] now you might not think that i'm 72
[1:50:53] years old if god gave me what
[1:50:56] 15 more years what would i be 87
[1:51:01] when you look at me and say i only got
[1:51:03] 15 more years
[1:51:07] maybe 20. i know old king lived forever
[1:51:13] that ain't gonna happen
[1:51:18] do you think right now that i'm worried
[1:51:21] about
[1:51:24] doing signs and wonders
[1:51:30] you can't even tell which is real and
[1:51:32] which is
[1:51:33] faked anymore not what i'm worried about
[1:51:38] it's not what i want to know make sure
[1:51:40] that i have
[1:51:41] i want to know that that quickening
[1:51:44] power
[1:51:45] the thing that can take me out of the
[1:51:48] grave
[1:51:49] i want i just don't want to believe it
[1:51:51] but i want to possess it
[1:51:53] so when he sends you the abstract in
[1:51:56] this day
[1:51:57] that spirit he's not sending it to you
[1:52:00] just for you to do works you're in the
[1:52:03] hour
[1:52:04] of the rapture we're in the end time
[1:52:07] we're at the hour of the resurrection
[1:52:10] we're at the hour of the end of the
[1:52:12] world we're at the hour of the taking up
[1:52:14] of the church that's what i want to know
[1:52:17] and be assured that i'm a part of
[1:52:22] beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:52:25] i just don't want to know i have a
[1:52:27] spirit and i have the gifts working in
[1:52:30] me
[1:52:32] i just don't want to know that i'm
[1:52:34] living a good life
[1:52:36] and then i'm i'm i'm doing the things
[1:52:39] that
[1:52:39] he said for me to do
[1:52:45] and not answer the main question
[1:52:53] i want to know am i coming out of the
[1:52:56] grave
[1:52:59] or if the if the lord comes in my time
[1:53:02] i'm going i want to know i possess it
[1:53:06] i want to know it's sure i want to know
[1:53:09] it's over
[1:53:10] i want to know my slate has been wiped
[1:53:12] clean
[1:53:13] that he's accepted my faith and he's
[1:53:16] given to me
[1:53:18] this quickening power i want the power
[1:53:22] to quicken in me the faith
[1:53:25] and the revelation that i'm part of this
[1:53:29] this is my ground i'm on rapturing
[1:53:32] ground
[1:53:38] and then we we know that
[1:53:41] without peaking that for the individual
[1:53:46] you also know that the prophet of god
[1:53:49] was showing this is the word of god
[1:53:52] by discerning it by his ministry and
[1:53:55] said how can you know this and then deny
[1:53:57] the word of god
[1:53:59] when it's coming to pass right in front
[1:54:01] of you
[1:54:02] he wanted them to examine
[1:54:06] what that quickening power really does
[1:54:10] that quickening power opens your eyes
[1:54:14] and gives you eye sav that you can see
[1:54:18] it clothes you
[1:54:21] and white raymond it gives you gold
[1:54:25] tried in fire so
[1:54:30] this is why i say this quickening power
[1:54:34] in
[1:54:34] our day wasn't given
[1:54:39] to resurrect pentecost
[1:54:43] it was given so the believer knows every
[1:54:46] promise
[1:54:47] in the book is his even
[1:54:50] the promise of the rapture and we've
[1:54:54] as christians have always pushed the
[1:54:58] rapture
[1:54:59] down the road as being something that
[1:55:02] someday
[1:55:03] inevitably will happen and
[1:55:06] if i'm a part of it i'll be there
[1:55:10] and it doesn't matter whether or die and
[1:55:13] that's right it don't matter whether i
[1:55:14] die or i'm alive
[1:55:16] if i know
[1:55:20] that he's here
[1:55:24] and that's what i'm a part of and he
[1:55:27] sealed it
[1:55:28] wouldn't you want that question totally
[1:55:31] finished
[1:55:32] in your life i wonder how it would
[1:55:35] really make you
[1:55:36] change if you knew you possessed the
[1:55:39] rapture
[1:55:40] and you knew no grave could hold your
[1:55:42] body down
[1:55:44] how it would make you act towards other
[1:55:46] people
[1:55:48] okay remember he says well what what it
[1:55:50] ought to do to us
[1:55:53] it's just the change that assurance
[1:55:56] and and the only reason i say this is
[1:55:59] your pastor in closing this morning
[1:56:01] is because a lot of times we don't
[1:56:03] approach it that way
[1:56:07] it's always it'll happen if it happens
[1:56:11] you know and the thing about it is no
[1:56:15] it's happening how is it happening
[1:56:19] it's happening in abstract form
[1:56:24] he's giving the rapture
[1:56:27] i just don't have a better word in my
[1:56:28] vocabulary he's giving the rapture
[1:56:31] away now he's handing out the rapture
[1:56:36] in this day by the message of the hour
[1:56:40] he's handing out the rapture here's the
[1:56:42] quickening rapture
[1:56:44] here's the quickening rapture here's the
[1:56:47] quickening rapture
[1:56:48] the son of man came to give rapture
[1:56:52] to the elect seed he's given him rapture
[1:56:55] now he's given him the possession
[1:56:57] you say i don't see the rapture you have
[1:57:00] the rapture
[1:57:01] it's in you in abstract form it's in you
[1:57:04] in the deed
[1:57:05] if he gave you the deed and he gave you
[1:57:08] it then you are the possessor
[1:57:10] not the believer but the possessor of it
[1:57:13] this
[1:57:13] message has come so the bride can
[1:57:16] possess the rapture
[1:57:20] and know they possess it and know it's
[1:57:23] answered
[1:57:24] and know i'm going.
[1:57:29] and then if you have to sing in the
[1:57:32] sweet bye and buy
[1:57:34] over my box i don't know they might make
[1:57:38] it an
[1:57:38] urn i don't care i've got one waiting
[1:57:41] for me
[1:57:46] it don't matter
[1:57:49] it's settled i already know
[1:57:54] i already know i
[1:57:58] possess i have in my
[1:58:01] possession the rapture
[1:58:08] this message came to deliver
[1:58:13] the rapture to the bride
[1:58:20] i've got it
[1:58:23] if i got an abstract d on a piece of
[1:58:26] property
[1:58:26] i may have never seen that property
[1:58:31] but i know it's mine
[1:58:35] nobody can take it away from me nothing
[1:58:38] i have it because i have the paperwork
[1:58:40] i have the survey i have the record
[1:58:43] it's recorded it on the books
[1:58:48] that it's mine
[1:58:53] and that's the way it is with the
[1:58:54] rapture it's recorded on the lamb's book
[1:58:57] of life
[1:58:58] it's mine he gave me the seal of it
[1:59:01] the proof of it by giving me the
[1:59:03] quickening power
[1:59:04] by pivoting him my spirit now i know
[1:59:07] i possess the resurrection
[1:59:11] i've already resurrected and i'm sitting
[1:59:14] in heavenly places
[1:59:16] in christ jesus oh i just think that we
[1:59:19] could
[1:59:20] it is not
[1:59:23] get so caught up
[1:59:26] in the carnal manifestation
[1:59:29] and understand what it is that he's
[1:59:32] given us
[1:59:33] and what it is that this message brought
[1:59:36] us
[1:59:37] and what the peace of it is praise god
[1:59:40] i have been delivered to me by the
[1:59:43] ministry of the son of man
[1:59:45] the rapture
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:51] are you going in the rapture because i
[1:59:54] got it here
[1:59:57] i'd like to maybe play that video of
[1:59:59] gary's son
[2:00:00] one day saying going in the rapture
[2:00:03] i'm going in the rapture hallelujah
[2:00:08] i'm going in the rapture i'm going to
[2:00:12] meet him in the air
[2:00:13] how do you know i got it i've got the
[2:00:16] abstract i've got it i've got the
[2:00:18] resurrection life
[2:00:19] he sealed me in oh and
[2:00:22] i'd just like to go over that what we've
[2:00:24] read again
[2:00:26] on another sunday but anyway god bless
[2:00:29] you tonight some of you watched
[2:00:31] fireworks last night i can tell because
[2:00:33] you're all starry-eyed
[2:00:37] and that's great and then some of you
[2:00:39] will watch them tonight
[2:00:40] some of you watch them both night enjoy
[2:00:42] the rest of the day
[2:00:44] with your family it's noon now and and
[2:00:47] just have a wonderful fourth of july uh
[2:00:50] communion will be next
[2:00:52] sunday instead of this sunday and then
[2:00:55] we'll have
[2:00:56] a prayer and then i i'd like also to
[2:00:58] make a request
[2:01:00] to you all those that are maybe
[2:01:03] streaming
[2:01:06] or listening to the service but i would
[2:01:08] like our congregation
[2:01:10] as a congregation to make a
[2:01:13] special effort to put
[2:01:16] sister karen pruitt in our prayers
[2:01:20] and i've known karen for a long time and
[2:01:23] and she speaks more
[2:01:28] word with her life than i've
[2:01:31] seen a lot of preachers do over the
[2:01:33] pulpits
[2:01:34] for years she's just a rock she's steady
[2:01:39] she's kind and
[2:01:43] it just breaks my heart that she's going
[2:01:45] through such a
[2:01:46] hard time and i know that prayer makes a
[2:01:50] difference
[2:01:52] and i know that we pray but i thought
[2:01:54] maybe if our whole congregation
[2:01:57] would just make intercession
[2:02:01] on her behalf
[2:02:05] you know and she's just a lovely
[2:02:07] christian and
[2:02:09] and got uh you know
[2:02:12] grandchildren and children and
[2:02:15] everything
[2:02:16] and you you know that some of these
[2:02:18] things they can't figure out
[2:02:20] but there's nothing that gets by the
[2:02:22] great physician
[2:02:24] i know we have local needs too and
[2:02:26] different people that
[2:02:27] are going through things in our church
[2:02:30] but
[2:02:33] i don't know i just to be honest with
[2:02:37] you
[2:02:37] i think karen's lived a life that
[2:02:40] deserves our prayer
[2:02:42] so i'd like you our name's karen pruitt
[2:02:44] she's brother tim pruitt's
[2:02:46] wife a pastor in louisiana
[2:02:50] but i think that maybe all of us here
[2:02:52] could
[2:02:53] pray you young people say your prayers
[2:02:56] just remember
[2:02:57] her name the lord knows who she is the
[2:03:00] lord knows
[2:03:01] what satan's trying to do to her he's
[2:03:04] not
[2:03:04] pulling the wool over our lord's eyes
[2:03:07] we don't know but the one thing we do
[2:03:11] have is we have prayer
[2:03:14] and we can pray and we can ask
[2:03:18] the lord to touch her and i think if we
[2:03:20] would join in
[2:03:22] with those that are already praying
[2:03:25] as our whole church just praying for her
[2:03:28] and asking god to really give her a
[2:03:31] deliverance
[2:03:32] and a touch that i believe we can see
[2:03:35] the hand of god
[2:03:36] i'd like to put my shoulder to the wheel
[2:03:39] not mine personally i'd like to put our
[2:03:41] whole church
[2:03:42] pushing on the wheel to see if we can
[2:03:45] help
[2:03:46] through prayer bring her to the hour
[2:03:49] of her deliverance and the lord would do
[2:03:53] something for
[2:03:54] so that's a request that i have on my
[2:03:57] heart to ask you to join me in
[2:03:59] i pray that you would maybe make a note
[2:04:02] on uh your ipad or your phone or
[2:04:06] everything i used to make mental notes
[2:04:09] but that
[2:04:10] pad is getting wore out
[2:04:13] so just which would you do that i i
[2:04:16] believe it'll be a blessing to her
[2:04:18] and then that's what we trust so
[2:04:21] lord richly bless you let's stand
[2:04:23] together this morning
[2:04:24] musicians would come
[2:04:32] billy's away preaching
[2:04:36] in baton rouge this morning and
[2:04:39] a lot of the brothers are away but we're
[2:04:42] glad you're here this morning and
[2:04:43] we trust that the lord bless you um
[2:04:48] and um we know that god will be
[2:04:51] gracious to us so let's bow our heads
[2:04:53] this morning
[2:04:54] a gracious heavenly father
[2:05:00] lord i raised the great question this
[2:05:04] morning
[2:05:04] asking each believer
[2:05:07] do they have that blessed assurance
[2:05:11] that they possess the rapture
[2:05:16] that it's not something that's going to
[2:05:19] happen
[2:05:20] down the road like an event
[2:05:23] on the calendar
[2:05:27] it's not rapturing day or
[2:05:32] lord but for us it's a condition
[2:05:37] the prophet of god said that you're
[2:05:39] getting in rapturing condition
[2:05:42] very word he used lord
[2:05:45] it's a place where it's settled
[2:05:52] that this quickening power that was
[2:05:54] poured out
[2:05:55] on the day of pentecost
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:59] that came through the ages seeking out
[2:06:03] the believers that took
[2:06:06] the believer's bride in the day of
[2:06:12] luther and brought him to justification
[2:06:16] took the bride in the days of wesley and
[2:06:19] brought him to sanctification
[2:06:24] father when the restoration of the gifts
[2:06:27] came and the believers received your
[2:06:29] spirit
[2:06:31] they began to walk in those promises
[2:06:35] speaking in tongues and laying their
[2:06:37] hands on the sick
[2:06:42] but lord we realize now that that life
[2:06:44] has come
[2:06:45] to the hour of rapture
[2:06:52] and father that's what our desire is
[2:06:55] when we see the son of man standing
[2:06:58] there
[2:06:58] in our day imparting resurrection
[2:07:05] to that seed whose name was written on
[2:07:07] the lamb's book of life
[2:07:09] father that's what i want to know
[2:07:12] that i have and i possess
[2:07:17] i want to honestly able to say deep in
[2:07:19] my soul the lord's given me that
[2:07:22] and i hold it dear in my heart
[2:07:26] and there i have no fear of grave i have
[2:07:30] no fear of sickness
[2:07:33] i have no fear of poverty
[2:07:37] i'm not walking in fear because i'm
[2:07:39] walking in the newness of life
[2:07:42] [Music]
[2:07:44] because i have in my hand
[2:07:47] and i have in my heart
[2:07:50] that eternal presence of the mighty lord
