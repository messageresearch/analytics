[10:03] amen certainly welcome everyone in the
[10:05] house of god this morning amen happy and
[10:07] glad to be gathered here in his presence
[10:09] as revived by mike for psalm reading
[10:12] this morning god bless you
[10:33] we're going to read psalm 77 this
[10:35] morning
[10:39] you know this is one of a
[10:41] group of psalms
[10:43] that was not actually written by david
[10:48] this is written by asaph
[10:51] at a time that david was king
[10:54] asaph and a
[10:56] handful of other ministers
[10:59] levites
[11:01] they were responsible for leading
[11:03] worship
[11:04] in the
[11:05] place of the tabernacle when it was
[11:08] really just a ten
[11:11] and it says in first chronicles 6
[11:14] 31
[11:16] it says in these are they
[11:18] whom david set over the service of song
[11:22] in the house
[11:23] of the lord
[11:24] after that the ark had rest
[11:27] and they ministered before the dwelling
[11:30] place of the tabernacle of the
[11:31] congregation with singing
[11:34] until
[11:35] solomon had built the house of the lord
[11:37] in jerusalem
[11:38] and then they waited on their office
[11:42] according to their order
[11:44] you know as i was just reading that
[11:46] three different things kind of stuck out
[11:48] to me there
[11:50] first of all this
[11:52] group
[11:54] was a chosen group it was a very
[11:56] specific group of people
[11:58] in fact if you read that chapter it
[11:59] names them by name it can't be more than
[12:01] a few
[12:03] but it was a specific group of people
[12:05] that was called to do a specific work
[12:08] the second thing that stuck out to me is
[12:10] it was in a specific place
[12:13] it says there in first chronicles 6 that
[12:16] they ministered before the dwelling
[12:18] place
[12:19] of the tabernacle
[12:21] this was before the house was even built
[12:24] even before the building was made
[12:26] manifest on earth
[12:28] they had a ministry
[12:30] of worship in the dwelling place that
[12:32] temporary dwelling place of that
[12:34] tabernacle
[12:36] and then was for a specific point of
[12:38] time
[12:39] it says in first chronicles 6 that it
[12:41] was they were chosen to minister from
[12:43] the time that the ark had rest
[12:46] until the time that solomon built the
[12:48] temple
[12:49] and then they moved on to a different
[12:51] ministry
[12:52] so there was a small space of time
[12:55] when there was a temporary dwelling
[12:57] place that a chosen
[12:59] handful of people
[13:01] conducted a very specific ministry
[13:05] for a very specific
[13:06] space of time
[13:09] you know and i thought about that and
[13:12] you know it uh certainly sounded
[13:14] familiar to me
[13:16] you know i think we can all say that
[13:18] there is a chosen
[13:20] hand
[13:22] full of people
[13:23] that have been called for a space of
[13:25] time
[13:26] during the hour of the temporary
[13:28] dwelling place
[13:29] to perform a specific ministry
[13:32] for a specific space of time
[13:36] so it's a little hard not to read that
[13:38] and say mama that's me
[13:41] you know psalm 77 is one of the songs
[13:45] that comes forth from this people
[13:49] and
[13:50] you know as we read this we maybe get a
[13:52] little bit of a glimpse into what kind
[13:54] of ministry
[13:56] this people may have performed
[14:00] it says in verse 1
[14:02] i cried unto god with my voice
[14:06] even unto god with my voice
[14:08] and he gave ear unto me
[14:12] now notice this
[14:14] ministry this song
[14:17] has to do with their voice
[14:21] and there was a voice
[14:23] that went forth that says that caused
[14:26] god to hear
[14:28] so there was an effect
[14:30] of the voice that this
[14:32] group of people in their ministry
[14:34] sent out and it caused the lord
[14:37] to hear
[14:39] you know sometimes i think we get
[14:41] trapped a little bit in our own
[14:43] religious teachings
[14:44] and vocabulary
[14:47] you know when someone says the word
[14:49] minister
[14:51] or ministry
[14:52] it doesn't necessarily have anything to
[14:54] do with a man in a suit and tie behind a
[14:56] pulpit
[14:58] and when somebody says the word worship
[15:02] it doesn't necessarily have anything to
[15:03] do with the song service where the
[15:05] spirit
[15:06] is moving
[15:08] and when someone speaks of crying with
[15:11] my voice
[15:12] it doesn't necessarily mean that we're
[15:15] screaming aloud in prayer
[15:17] in fact brother branham said what that
[15:19] our thoughts speak louder in heaven than
[15:22] our words
[15:24] right
[15:26] so what is that
[15:28] but that there's a voice that comes out
[15:29] of this people so what is that voice
[15:31] what does that voice
[15:33] say
[15:36] it says in
[15:38] once again verse 1. this is an hour of
[15:40] desperation if you read the psalm
[15:43] it says i cried unto god with my voice
[15:46] and he gave ear unto me
[15:49] so what is it that caused him to listen
[15:51] in verse 10
[15:53] and i said
[15:55] this is my infirmity this is my trial
[15:58] this is my burden this is my need
[16:01] but i will remember the years of the
[16:04] right hand of the most high
[16:07] i will remember the works of the lord
[16:10] surely i will remember thy wonders of
[16:13] old
[16:15] i will meditate also of all thy work
[16:18] and talk of thy doings
[16:21] so in his hour of trouble
[16:24] it says he cried unto his voice and the
[16:27] message that he said is i will remember
[16:29] your works
[16:31] and your wonders
[16:32] and who you are and what you do
[16:36] you know this cry was not a cry for
[16:39] something new
[16:40] some new work to be performed
[16:43] something but instead it was
[16:47] to look back at who he was and what he
[16:50] does
[16:51] at what he said
[16:53] the things that the way that he works
[16:55] his wonders and to speak them forth
[16:58] the song of this ministry of this people
[17:03] you know the rest of psalm 77 starting
[17:05] in verse 13 is all about that song
[17:09] in the time of trouble
[17:12] in the hour when they had a need
[17:14] and an hour when they had a burden the
[17:16] voice of this people in this specific
[17:19] hour in the time of the temporary
[17:22] dwelling place
[17:24] was to speak forth his wonders
[17:27] his word
[17:28] his works
[17:29] how he opened it says here that you know
[17:32] it says that you redeemed a people we're
[17:35] gonna read about that waters parted to
[17:37] make a path water from the sky when it
[17:39] was dry shaking the very foundation of
[17:42] the earth when a mountain needed moving
[17:44] right this is who he is this is what he
[17:48] does and the ministry of this people is
[17:50] to speak that forth
[17:52] no matter what their need is no matter
[17:54] what situation they're in there's only
[17:56] one ministry that this people has and
[17:58] that's to declare the name of the lord
[18:01] just as that chosen group of people was
[18:03] back there
[18:05] so you know as i thought about that
[18:07] scriptures began to come to my mind
[18:09] about you are written epistles read of
[18:11] all men
[18:13] right you know that you are kings and
[18:16] priests before him
[18:18] there's a ministry that this chosen
[18:20] people is to perform in the hour they've
[18:22] been given
[18:23] and that's to proclaim the works and the
[18:26] wonders and the word of the lord not to
[18:30] look for some new work
[18:32] not to speak something new but to be his
[18:35] ministry in that time to speak forth who
[18:37] he is
[18:39] and so as i thought about that again i
[18:40] looked at that scripture and thought
[18:41] mama that's me
[18:43] so as we read this morning i i hope that
[18:45] you know you put yourself in the
[18:47] scripture and remember we're in a
[18:49] temporary dwelling place for just a
[18:51] certain space of time and there's a very
[18:52] specific ministry that we've been called
[18:54] to do there's a voice there's a message
[18:57] that we're called to deliver
[18:58] let's read that together starting in
[19:00] verse one
[19:01] i cried unto god with my voice even unto
[19:05] god with my voice and he gave ear unto
[19:08] me
[19:09] in the day of my trouble i sought the
[19:11] lord my sore ran in the night and ceased
[19:14] not my soul refused to be comforted i
[19:17] remembered god and was troubled i
[19:20] complained and my spirit was overwhelmed
[19:23] sila thou holdest mine eye is waking i
[19:26] am so troubled that i cannot speak i
[19:29] have considered the days of old the
[19:31] years of ancient times i call to
[19:34] remembrance my song in the night i
[19:36] commune with my own heart and my spirit
[19:39] made diligent search
[19:41] will the lord cast off forever and will
[19:43] he be favorable no more is his mercy
[19:46] clean gone forever doth his promise fail
[19:50] forevermore
[19:51] hath god forgotten to be gracious happy
[19:54] in anger shut up his tender mercies sila
[19:57] and i said this is my infirmity but i
[20:00] will remember the years of the right
[20:03] hand of the most high i will remember
[20:05] the works of the lord surely i will
[20:08] remember thy wonders of old i will
[20:10] meditate also of all thy work and talk
[20:13] of thy doings thy way o god is in the
[20:16] sanctuary who is so great a god is our
[20:19] god thou art the god that doest wonders
[20:23] thou hast declared thy strength among
[20:25] the people thou hast with thine arm
[20:27] redeemed thy people the sons of jacob
[20:30] and joseph selah the waters saw thee o
[20:33] god the waters saw thee they were afraid
[20:36] the depths also were troubled the clouds
[20:39] poured out water the skies sent out a
[20:42] sound thine arrows also went abroad the
[20:45] voice of thy thunder was in the heaven
[20:48] the lightnings lightened the world the
[20:50] earth trembled and shook
[20:52] thy way is in the sea and thy path in
[20:54] the great waters and thy footsteps are
[20:57] not known thou lettest thy people like a
[21:00] flock by the hand of moses and aaron

[54:55] amen let's pray our heavenly father we
[55:00] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[55:02] your
[55:03] chosen place to meet man
[55:06] is under the shed blood
[55:09] father such a powerful
[55:12] fountain that can wash us from every
[55:14] stain
[55:16] deliver us from every shortcoming
[55:20] set us free from every oppressor
[55:24] oh lord you are so good to your children
[55:27] we love you and we just ask you to bless
[55:30] us this morning
[55:32] as we fellowship around your
[55:34] wonderful word and we
[55:36] lift praises to you father in
[55:38] thanksgiving
[55:40] lord we just ask that you would
[55:43] give us
[55:44] more eyes father that we can comprehend
[55:48] the greatness that you have revealed to
[55:52] us
[55:53] father answer each of our prayers and we
[55:55] ask these things
[55:57] in your precious and wonderful name we
[56:00] pray
[56:01] amen
[56:02] amen god bless you this morning let's
[56:04] turn in our bibles
[56:06] over to
[56:08] numbers
[56:10] and we'll just ask the lord to bless us
[56:12] and
[56:13] and
[56:15] they mentioned
[56:16] sister
[56:18] ellen santiago in prayer we were able to
[56:21] go to a doctor and
[56:23] they feel that her eyesight may be
[56:28] taken care of with
[56:30] some
[56:31] cataract surgery so they're going to
[56:34] go
[56:34] in there and look at
[56:37] that this week and we just trust that
[56:39] it's the lord you know
[56:43] so if anybody needs a truck just get
[56:46] with brother joel
[56:49] he will definitely be able to
[56:51] take care of that for you
[56:53] i remember one time
[56:56] richard
[56:57] lenny greenlee were
[56:58] planning
[56:59] to move and they were living in chicago
[57:02] and
[57:03] and they were fixing up the house and
[57:05] everything and
[57:06] so sister lenny said you know what the
[57:08] only way we're ever going to sell this
[57:10] house is somebody comes up and knocks on
[57:12] the door
[57:13] and says you want to sell your house a
[57:16] day later someone walked up and knocked
[57:18] on the door said you want to sell your
[57:20] house
[57:20] so
[57:22] let's not forget
[57:24] that's the kind of god we serve
[57:28] amen that's what we want to remember
[57:32] amen we have a god that
[57:34] only manifests himself in the
[57:37] supernatural so if we can just keep that
[57:40] growing in us that's what we want to
[57:42] grow let's read here in numbers
[57:44] um
[57:46] the 22nd chapter
[57:48] and the 31st verse
[57:54] it says the lord
[57:56] then the lord opened the eyes
[57:59] of balaam
[58:01] and he saw the angel
[58:03] of the lord standing
[58:05] in the way and his sword drawn
[58:10] in his hand
[58:12] and he bowed down his head
[58:15] and fell flat
[58:17] on his face amen father we ask you to
[58:19] bless this word in your precious name we
[58:22] pray amen amen god bless you this
[58:25] morning
[58:29] this this morning we want to have
[58:32] some fellowship this morning uh
[58:35] continuing out of the message
[58:38] does god ever change his mind about his
[58:40] word
[58:41] and today we'd like to
[58:43] title
[58:45] this sermon the two lines
[58:48] the two lines and uh
[58:51] this is a uh
[58:53] a great lesson here
[58:55] uh in
[58:56] in this uh
[58:58] uh
[58:59] message uh
[59:01] of uh
[59:03] is your life
[59:05] worthy of the gospel
[59:07] and uh no not your life or does god ever
[59:10] change his mind
[59:12] about his word
[59:14] and so
[59:16] um
[59:17] this uh
[59:19] statement is
[59:22] real important i think
[59:24] as brother branham brings this out in
[59:27] the beginning now this is sunday school
[59:29] this morning okay so
[59:31] it i know most of you have just come
[59:33] back from a
[59:34] evangelistic uh
[59:37] uh you know deliverance type
[59:40] meeting where they preach the delivering
[59:42] power of the lord and and we see god's
[59:46] mighty hand
[59:47] moving and healing
[59:49] and those are our great things
[59:52] but also the scripture tells us to that
[59:55] we should have sound doctrine
[59:57] and that we should be steadfast
[1:00:00] in the
[1:00:01] in in the word of god and study to show
[1:00:04] ourselves approved so it takes a balance
[1:00:07] of it all to keep us
[1:00:10] going um
[1:00:11] and you know so we just trust the lord
[1:00:14] will bless you but brother brahm says in
[1:00:15] this message in the seventh the
[1:00:18] paragraph paragraph 70 he says in israel
[1:00:22] of the old testament
[1:00:24] is the type of the bride
[1:00:27] of the new testament
[1:00:29] coming out of the world
[1:00:31] marching on the road to canaan or canaan
[1:00:36] that we go to the millennium
[1:00:39] and so he says now this is a type
[1:00:44] or if we could use another word this is
[1:00:47] a preview
[1:00:48] so you can look at
[1:00:51] at look at israel's journey
[1:00:54] and from looking at that begin to come
[1:00:57] to an understanding
[1:01:00] of what's going to happen
[1:01:02] or what's going to
[1:01:04] face you
[1:01:05] in your journey so the things that you
[1:01:08] are going to come in contact with
[1:01:11] these are the things that are along the
[1:01:14] way
[1:01:14] uh these are the spirits that will be
[1:01:17] there these are the uh
[1:01:19] enemies that you will face uh these are
[1:01:23] the situations
[1:01:24] that will be there because he brought
[1:01:27] them through those situations so the
[1:01:30] bride can look and say oh
[1:01:34] i see that i see that i see that i see
[1:01:37] that and that we could apply the isab
[1:01:41] that we need to apply
[1:01:43] in our day because you know in in in the
[1:01:47] book of revelations that we were
[1:01:49] counseled were counseled up for three
[1:01:52] things to buy gold uh to buy gold
[1:01:55] trident fire
[1:01:57] to put on
[1:01:58] white ramen
[1:02:00] and to
[1:02:01] have isab
[1:02:03] and so we don't want to pass up the very
[1:02:06] instructions of the lord for our day so
[1:02:10] as we sit there and we we sit back and
[1:02:12] we say okay
[1:02:14] what are the three things that i need
[1:02:18] and those three things were told to us
[1:02:21] when the in in our generation he said i
[1:02:24] counsel thee and we know what gold
[1:02:26] trident fire is right it's character
[1:02:30] we know what putting on the white
[1:02:32] garments is to hide our nakedness
[1:02:34] but but to have eyes have
[1:02:37] that thou mayest see
[1:02:40] and that that's what we were talking
[1:02:42] about this morning we're talking about
[1:02:45] going to the word of god and applying
[1:02:49] the eye salve out of the word of god to
[1:02:53] our eyes
[1:02:54] and so that's part of what this message
[1:02:58] is that our messenger brought us he
[1:03:00] brought us all three of those
[1:03:03] okay in the message all three of those
[1:03:06] great requests that we were counseled to
[1:03:09] have of the lord those are brought to us
[1:03:12] now what we're talking about this
[1:03:14] morning is taking the isaf how many
[1:03:18] really understand that the messenger
[1:03:20] gave us i sat
[1:03:21] amen things we would have never seen or
[1:03:25] never recognized or never understood if
[1:03:28] the the word of god the message of god
[1:03:32] that i sav wasn't applied to us that we
[1:03:35] can see
[1:03:36] so we're counseled to do that so we we
[1:03:39] sit back and we see okay they're on this
[1:03:42] journey what things did they come in
[1:03:45] contact with what things that were they
[1:03:48] uh
[1:03:49] challenged with
[1:03:51] and and understand with isab that we
[1:03:54] should expect
[1:03:56] to uh be challenged uh
[1:04:00] by the very same things
[1:04:03] uh
[1:04:04] you know so uh that is uh that is one of
[1:04:08] the great things that we we realize and
[1:04:12] so there's another great thing that we
[1:04:15] see on this journey
[1:04:17] uh that we're taking that there's two
[1:04:21] lines
[1:04:22] on this journey
[1:04:24] okay and you say well what do you mean
[1:04:27] by a line a line of thought
[1:04:30] a a certain line of approach
[1:04:33] and so in this journey we're going to
[1:04:36] cross
[1:04:37] two lines of approach
[1:04:40] two complete
[1:04:42] uh
[1:04:44] different
[1:04:45] approaches
[1:04:47] two different means of and methods there
[1:04:51] are two different lines all together
[1:04:54] but yet we also know that they're so
[1:04:58] close
[1:04:59] they would deceive the very elect if
[1:05:01] possible what a paradox
[1:05:04] what a what a challenge and and so this
[1:05:08] challenge of these two lines is brought
[1:05:11] out in this message the the challenge
[1:05:14] that we have to face
[1:05:16] the the
[1:05:17] challenge of knowing that they're
[1:05:20] they're going to be close
[1:05:23] and there's it's not gonna be so obvious
[1:05:25] you know we've got the devil
[1:05:27] with little horns you know what i mean
[1:05:29] and a big tail and a pitchfork and oh
[1:05:32] you're
[1:05:32] wow you know you're gonna miss that guy
[1:05:35] no how many knows what the scripture
[1:05:37] says that a that satan appears as
[1:05:40] an angel of light
[1:05:44] now that's why this is the most
[1:05:47] deceiving age
[1:05:49] is ever because both
[1:05:52] both lines
[1:05:53] are represented
[1:05:55] by an angel
[1:06:00] okay this journey is in as easy
[1:06:04] as we would like to make it
[1:06:08] you know it's not as clear
[1:06:11] you know
[1:06:12] the the contrast is there
[1:06:16] but the contrast is only
[1:06:19] given
[1:06:20] to those who have eyes have
[1:06:23] to see
[1:06:25] otherwise it appears to be
[1:06:28] the same
[1:06:31] and and so as we're reading this message
[1:06:34] now
[1:06:35] we're there's a another teaching within
[1:06:38] the framework
[1:06:39] of this message that we've touched on
[1:06:42] and that's the permissive will
[1:06:44] and the perfect will of god
[1:06:47] we don't want to go into that
[1:06:49] this morning in depth at all but that is
[1:06:53] there as you study the message or if you
[1:06:56] choose to study it along with us
[1:06:59] but so we see that in this
[1:07:03] in this journey
[1:07:06] that we're we're taking if we would read
[1:07:09] in paragraph
[1:07:11] uh
[1:07:14] uh
[1:07:15] 86
[1:07:17] and we
[1:07:18] read here
[1:07:19] and we're talking about
[1:07:22] uh
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:24] the journey now just for a moment of
[1:07:27] israel and what happened
[1:07:30] it says and so we know that uh korah and
[1:07:34] dathan withstood moses and then we read
[1:07:36] down here a little bit we'll just pick
[1:07:39] up
[1:07:39] in the middle of
[1:07:42] a paragraph 85
[1:07:45] and
[1:07:46] he said ancora
[1:07:48] being
[1:07:50] being carnal
[1:07:52] wanted to raise up an organization among
[1:07:55] them he wanted to make a group of man
[1:07:59] and god doesn't deal with people like
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:05] so he doesn't deal with groups
[1:08:08] so even in our midst it's important as
[1:08:12] christian life
[1:08:14] tabernacle we don't form ourselves as a
[1:08:17] group
[1:08:20] our church
[1:08:22] our this
[1:08:23] together we're going quote unquote we're
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:28] the way we do things is the way it
[1:08:31] should be done
[1:08:32] even though we're here fellowshipping
[1:08:35] we're fellowshipping in the universal
[1:08:38] body of the lord jesus
[1:08:41] we're not fellowshipping
[1:08:43] and have any authority as a
[1:08:47] quote-unquote local group
[1:08:50] okay now now we are a body we are fitted
[1:08:54] and joined together every
[1:08:56] member supplies the need to the other
[1:08:59] but it's not based on location
[1:09:02] it's not it's not based under whose
[1:09:06] ministry that you set under you still
[1:09:09] have that individual part so god is
[1:09:13] going not going to ever deal with us
[1:09:16] as a complete group
[1:09:20] in other words where one word applies to
[1:09:24] us all
[1:09:25] the same
[1:09:26] way
[1:09:27] the word applies to us the same but even
[1:09:31] in this sermon this morning god will
[1:09:34] deal with each of your hearts separately
[1:09:38] so it's never if we could say this
[1:09:41] i heard an advertisement the other day
[1:09:44] no such thing as one sock fits all
[1:09:49] you know you got to have a sock nowaday
[1:09:51] that's according to your foot size
[1:09:54] you know you can't buy 11 to 12
[1:09:57] or you know 7 to 10
[1:10:00] or something like that i don't know what
[1:10:01] i'm going to do
[1:10:03] so uh
[1:10:04] but but you you understand the the
[1:10:07] the idea
[1:10:09] of trying to put everybody in one
[1:10:12] mindset
[1:10:13] give everybody the same revelation have
[1:10:17] everybody use the same
[1:10:20] terminology god will never do that okay
[1:10:24] and the ministry
[1:10:26] the carnal ministry will
[1:10:29] try to labor
[1:10:30] to get everybody to think the same way
[1:10:35] but no that's what you want you should
[1:10:37] be able to walk out of this
[1:10:39] sermon we should be able to get 200
[1:10:42] different
[1:10:43] explanations of what was preached
[1:10:49] many times i've talked to people and
[1:10:51] they said i really like what you said
[1:10:52] here and preached here and the whole so
[1:10:54] i said i didn't preach that did i preach
[1:10:56] that
[1:10:58] you know and i think well he missed the
[1:11:00] whole thing
[1:11:02] you know but the truth of the matter is
[1:11:04] god dealt with him in that way
[1:11:07] so understand that
[1:11:10] understand that could don't so you are
[1:11:13] not relying
[1:11:14] on what's going on with other people
[1:11:18] you know you you're not comparing notes
[1:11:21] to come up with some conclusion that we
[1:11:25] all make together as a group of people
[1:11:30] so you
[1:11:31] and so therefore if we take that a bit
[1:11:34] farther you may have revelations in the
[1:11:37] word of god that i don't
[1:11:45] it's a love affair
[1:11:47] between you and him
[1:11:49] he whispers his secrets in
[1:11:52] your ear
[1:11:55] and we would
[1:11:57] not everybody does things
[1:11:59] the way
[1:12:00] that i do
[1:12:02] so we don't have the right way the wrong
[1:12:04] way in my way
[1:12:07] we have his way
[1:12:09] and that's between you and him
[1:12:11] personally
[1:12:12] as we just study this so
[1:12:14] he he
[1:12:16] and he's saying here he says
[1:12:19] god doesn't deal with people like that
[1:12:22] it shows right there in the scriptures a
[1:12:26] type of the journey today
[1:12:32] it shows right there in scriptures a
[1:12:34] type of the journey today
[1:12:38] that organizing is not what god ordains
[1:12:46] now that's important
[1:12:49] because
[1:12:50] this is one of the things that we'll
[1:12:53] meet
[1:12:53] on our journey
[1:12:55] is the desire of men to organize
[1:13:01] to create
[1:13:03] groups
[1:13:05] to create ministerial fellowships
[1:13:08] to create certain ways of worship
[1:13:12] certain types of identity
[1:13:15] certain
[1:13:16] certain descriptions
[1:13:19] of what the move of the spirit is
[1:13:22] what the move of the spirit isn't uh and
[1:13:25] and
[1:13:26] there's none of those things can be
[1:13:28] applied in a group setting
[1:13:35] everything
[1:13:36] everything
[1:13:38] is personal
[1:13:41] so as we just read is the scripture the
[1:13:44] type of the journey organizes not
[1:13:46] ordained of god for as soon as korah
[1:13:49] done it he said to moses you take too
[1:13:53] much upon yourself
[1:13:55] in other words the whole congregation is
[1:13:59] holy
[1:14:04] now
[1:14:05] we've got to be careful because we say
[1:14:08] we are the bride we are the elect we we
[1:14:13] us us
[1:14:17] okay
[1:14:18] and and that's fine i i believe you're
[1:14:21] all saved i believe you're all filled
[1:14:23] with the holy ghost i believe you all
[1:14:26] have pure intentions and it's fine to
[1:14:29] say we we but you can't
[1:14:32] take that and say because i'm a part
[1:14:36] of this group
[1:14:38] that we're going
[1:14:40] now remember these are thinkings
[1:14:45] and lines of approach
[1:14:48] that are presented
[1:14:50] to the bride on their journey
[1:14:53] so these are the things that they're
[1:14:56] coming in contact with they're coming in
[1:14:59] conflict with another because someone
[1:15:02] wanting to put their arm around you and
[1:15:04] say worry it
[1:15:09] or we've got the right spirit here we've
[1:15:12] got the right system here okay the way
[1:15:15] our church does it if god is with us
[1:15:21] well you know if god's with us
[1:15:25] come here clever
[1:15:29] if god's with us
[1:15:32] and i leave
[1:15:37] he's in trouble
[1:15:41] because i'm going to take god with me
[1:15:43] before i i leave him with you but do you
[1:15:46] understand you can't get into this idea
[1:15:49] of
[1:15:50] us now if he's got god
[1:15:54] and i've got god and he's got the word
[1:15:57] and i've got the word then we have a
[1:15:59] unity together
[1:16:01] and we bless one another
[1:16:04] but he has got to have as we heard
[1:16:06] wednesday night a personal
[1:16:09] experience with the lord
[1:16:13] i do believe god's with us because
[1:16:14] wherever two or more are gathered in his
[1:16:16] name there he'll be
[1:16:18] but
[1:16:19] it doesn't take both of us
[1:16:24] it's when two of us come together
[1:16:30] that's the difference
[1:16:32] so you've got to understand so
[1:16:34] why this spirit is so bad
[1:16:37] is because it allows you to move away
[1:16:41] from your responsibility of a personal
[1:16:46] relationship i don't my this just keeps
[1:16:50] opening up
[1:16:52] he said
[1:16:53] and so he says
[1:16:57] in other words the whole congregation's
[1:16:59] holy
[1:17:00] why you say
[1:17:02] you're the only holy man
[1:17:05] you have no right to do any such as that
[1:17:09] you try to make yourself
[1:17:11] some
[1:17:12] big
[1:17:14] some uh yourself
[1:17:16] some big
[1:17:17] somebody big
[1:17:20] we're all holy we're all god's children
[1:17:24] and moses just turned his head and
[1:17:26] walked away he said lord what
[1:17:29] will i do
[1:17:31] and god said separate yourselves from
[1:17:34] him
[1:17:34] i've had enough of it and he swallowed
[1:17:37] him up in the earth
[1:17:39] see there was a clash
[1:17:43] now i want to talk about this just for a
[1:17:45] second there was a class
[1:17:47] when the carnal and the spiritual meets
[1:17:50] there's always a clash
[1:17:52] now
[1:17:53] we have to understand that because as
[1:17:56] christians
[1:17:58] you understand
[1:18:00] we
[1:18:01] that clash
[1:18:02] makes us feel unchristian
[1:18:09] you know what i mean
[1:18:11] we don't like that the spirit
[1:18:14] of uh a contention
[1:18:18] we don't like that you know what i mean
[1:18:21] so
[1:18:22] it's uncomfortable feeling when there's
[1:18:26] a clash between the carnal and the
[1:18:30] spiritual
[1:18:31] now if one of these spirits would come
[1:18:34] up against you
[1:18:36] somehow in some way
[1:18:39] there's people that form doctrines and
[1:18:41] they form groups and they have they have
[1:18:44] a certain teaching
[1:18:46] and they suck you into belonging to that
[1:18:49] many times people come under the
[1:18:52] influence of a certain pastor and he
[1:18:55] controls their lives did you buy a car
[1:18:57] without asking me did you go to the
[1:18:59] store without asking me you know i don't
[1:19:02] approve of those shoes i don't like that
[1:19:05] dress you know let me look at your
[1:19:07] wallet i don't like the way you folded
[1:19:09] your money up what you got too much
[1:19:11] money in your wallet you should have put
[1:19:13] some of that in the offering
[1:19:15] you know what i mean and and so oh don't
[1:19:18] don't
[1:19:20] it's that bad
[1:19:22] it's that bad
[1:19:25] you you you understand it can so uh they
[1:19:28] they they push that
[1:19:31] out there and so
[1:19:33] people become uncomfortable with the
[1:19:35] clash
[1:19:37] they don't want to say up get behind me
[1:19:40] satan
[1:19:42] oh you can't say that to the preacher if
[1:19:44] the preacher satan
[1:19:46] you tell him to get behind you
[1:19:50] rev don't mean nothing
[1:19:56] you know what i mean you're subject to
[1:19:57] one thing and one thing alone and that's
[1:20:01] god's word
[1:20:03] what settles it
[1:20:05] and but sometimes the clash
[1:20:10] makes us shrink away
[1:20:13] the clash we don't want to stand up
[1:20:16] we don't want to speak out
[1:20:19] we don't want to even do what he says in
[1:20:21] the thing he said they put their finger
[1:20:23] in their face and said you're not saying
[1:20:25] what the apostles are saying
[1:20:28] they don't want that so their life comes
[1:20:31] to a place where they're always
[1:20:33] sidestepping they're always avoiding
[1:20:36] and and sometimes you've just got to
[1:20:39] realize you've got to put your your your
[1:20:42] feet down and stand on what you believe
[1:20:46] because if you won't stand
[1:20:48] for
[1:20:50] something that you believe you won't
[1:20:52] stand for anything
[1:20:55] and then you really don't have a
[1:20:58] testimony
[1:21:01] so basically nobody can put a finger
[1:21:04] on your life
[1:21:06] they don't know what you believe
[1:21:08] or what you stand for because we run
[1:21:11] from the clash and we've got to
[1:21:14] understand the clash is going to be
[1:21:17] there
[1:21:18] it doesn't matter you've got to have
[1:21:20] that individual
[1:21:22] understanding in your heart that it
[1:21:24] doesn't de-christianize you
[1:21:28] because you have a spiritual clash
[1:21:32] and it's good people
[1:21:35] that have wrong ideas
[1:21:40] and it doesn't mean they'll remain in
[1:21:42] those ideas all their life
[1:21:45] but it's important that you feel
[1:21:49] in your life
[1:21:51] the the uh confidence in your
[1:21:55] revelation
[1:21:56] that when a clash comes that you're able
[1:22:00] to
[1:22:00] hold and stand your ground
[1:22:08] and that is the right spirit
[1:22:13] because if you have the wrong doctrine
[1:22:16] and you have the right spirit god will
[1:22:19] take care of any heirs that you have or
[1:22:22] bring you to an understanding but if
[1:22:24] you're always constantly backing away
[1:22:27] running down uh could not stay
[1:22:30] standing for what you
[1:22:32] believe
[1:22:33] nothing will ever happen to you
[1:22:36] and so what is we just look he says
[1:22:39] he said
[1:22:41] the clash is there jesus meant jesus
[1:22:43] there was a clash
[1:22:45] one the son of god the other one the son
[1:22:47] of satan just like cain and abel there
[1:22:50] was a clash when they met one of them
[1:22:53] was
[1:23:00] one of them was the treasure of the
[1:23:01] church the other one a pastor
[1:23:04] and as now we come into this day
[1:23:07] the same thing again
[1:23:12] so
[1:23:13] we're not walking over this this is a
[1:23:16] type
[1:23:18] so if you're on the journey
[1:23:21] this is
[1:23:22] this is what's going to happen
[1:23:25] so you we might as well just put our
[1:23:27] boots on and understand this is the
[1:23:29] truth
[1:23:31] the carnal denomination to the spiritual
[1:23:34] bride of christ
[1:23:36] the spiritual bride of christ is so much
[1:23:39] different from the carnal denomination
[1:23:42] till there's no comparison
[1:23:46] of them
[1:23:47] at
[1:23:48] all
[1:23:49] so we we recognize this great
[1:23:53] uh a clash and uh
[1:23:56] and uh so we we watch
[1:24:00] this clash where it comes from so if we
[1:24:03] could turn over to paragraph 100
[1:24:06] and um
[1:24:08] and we'll read this paragraph because
[1:24:11] what the reason that the clash
[1:24:14] exists okay i hope that
[1:24:19] you can bear with me this morning the
[1:24:21] reason the clash exists because they're
[1:24:25] both on two different directions
[1:24:29] they encounter
[1:24:31] one another
[1:24:33] okay
[1:24:34] but they're going in two different
[1:24:37] directions
[1:24:40] okay so
[1:24:41] when when that spirit whatever it is i'm
[1:24:44] not going to try to go through a list of
[1:24:46] them because each of us have our own
[1:24:48] different clashes but there's always a
[1:24:51] draw
[1:24:53] satan has even invited jesus
[1:24:57] to his kingdom
[1:25:00] satan offered his line
[1:25:04] his approach
[1:25:06] how he thought the world should be in
[1:25:09] other words jesus we will accomplish a
[1:25:12] better kingdom through science through
[1:25:15] education
[1:25:16] through system
[1:25:18] through organization
[1:25:21] now if you will just join my approach
[1:25:25] and my line
[1:25:29] okay we can accomplish this
[1:25:32] together
[1:25:34] now satan was no slouch
[1:25:39] he was right up there
[1:25:41] can you imagine someone that was so
[1:25:44] gifted with majesty
[1:25:46] that he could deceive
[1:25:48] two-thirds of the angels
[1:25:54] you understand so he
[1:25:56] the conversation he had with jesus was
[1:26:00] extremely eloquent
[1:26:03] and extremely
[1:26:05] persuasive
[1:26:09] so if if you're not going to take
[1:26:13] the clash
[1:26:15] you're going to take the persuasion
[1:26:24] you know it's like like you know
[1:26:27] sitting in a a a i'll use a carnal
[1:26:30] example because many of our young people
[1:26:33] are involved in sports you know you get
[1:26:36] a team and everybody's sitting there and
[1:26:38] they're all rooting for that team and
[1:26:40] there's they're jumping up when there's
[1:26:42] a first down and everything and you're
[1:26:44] the only guy sitting there
[1:26:48] because you're not rooting for that team
[1:26:52] you know what i mean
[1:26:54] and if you're not pretty soon you know
[1:26:56] what i mean you're down at the
[1:26:58] concession stand changing jerseys
[1:27:03] because you want to shout and you want
[1:27:05] to be the winner
[1:27:07] you know what i mean but if your team
[1:27:08] comes back
[1:27:11] we can do run changer jersey again
[1:27:17] you know you stick it out
[1:27:19] and so the clash is because
[1:27:22] there's a sense about you that this is
[1:27:25] not the direction i'm wanting to go
[1:27:31] okay i don't i'm not comfortable with
[1:27:33] this
[1:27:34] you know what i mean i'm not going to
[1:27:35] move till i i the lord deals with my
[1:27:39] heart
[1:27:40] so that's the individual part that takes
[1:27:43] you out of the group move and and so you
[1:27:46] can't be afraid of the clash because in
[1:27:49] the long run there's no comparison
[1:27:53] now look at this quote as we read it
[1:27:55] together
[1:27:56] that's the way
[1:27:59] the church started
[1:28:03] that's the way it started at nicaea
[1:28:09] rome
[1:28:10] when the roman catholic church
[1:28:12] at the very beginning
[1:28:14] where it come from was pentecost
[1:28:18] but when they organized and brought in
[1:28:21] celebrities into the church they started
[1:28:25] to make having prayers
[1:28:28] and running beads
[1:28:30] and praying for the dead
[1:28:32] and all these other things now see that
[1:28:35] line
[1:28:36] now that line has
[1:28:40] changed from the catholic church
[1:28:43] but it's still been coming down right
[1:28:46] it's it ended up in
[1:28:48] luther it ended up in wesley it ended up
[1:28:50] in pentecost and where's the last place
[1:28:53] it's going to try to end up
[1:28:59] right here
[1:29:02] get us
[1:29:04] to
[1:29:05] enter in
[1:29:06] to that same pattern
[1:29:12] it says running beads and others
[1:29:14] and and then it just started rolling
[1:29:18] from one air to another
[1:29:21] one air to another
[1:29:23] until
[1:29:24] look where it's gone to
[1:29:28] there is
[1:29:29] not one
[1:29:31] representation of pentecost
[1:29:34] in it at all
[1:29:36] see one air picking up another picking
[1:29:40] up another there is only one thing to do
[1:29:45] and that's clean off the record and go
[1:29:48] back to the beginning
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:55] a lot of people never cleared off the
[1:29:58] slate
[1:29:59] they liked brother branham they liked
[1:30:01] the ministry they liked the signs and
[1:30:03] wonders but they were also holding to
[1:30:06] things that they
[1:30:08] thought were true
[1:30:10] and it wasn't that they weren't true
[1:30:14] but they weren't placed in the right
[1:30:16] place
[1:30:18] and we could go into the five musts and
[1:30:21] and those things but you you've been in
[1:30:23] this word
[1:30:24] uh uh for
[1:30:25] a long time so
[1:30:27] uh
[1:30:29] and so we we find out now so we see
[1:30:33] these two paths
[1:30:35] so here's israel
[1:30:37] coming up a type of the bride being led
[1:30:40] by a what
[1:30:42] prophet
[1:30:44] pillar of fire
[1:30:45] will read the statement
[1:30:47] now they come in contact
[1:30:49] with
[1:30:51] the moabites
[1:30:54] here they come
[1:30:57] and and
[1:30:58] we'll just take a look at this except he
[1:31:02] said
[1:31:03] so they're coming along their journey
[1:31:05] and and we read here about martin luther
[1:31:08] and wesley and and going on how they all
[1:31:11] organized and god moved out of it
[1:31:13] and now we're looking at it says here
[1:31:17] in 102.
[1:31:19] now lots group here
[1:31:22] or moabite
[1:31:23] was lot's daughter's
[1:31:25] child illegitimate to start with
[1:31:29] now notice as the natural church moabite
[1:31:32] represents natural denomination
[1:31:36] natural
[1:31:38] denomination
[1:31:41] why that word
[1:31:43] because it's man's natural
[1:31:47] tendency
[1:31:50] to find birds of a feather flock
[1:31:53] together
[1:31:56] nobody wants to stand out
[1:31:58] nobody wants to be the only one
[1:32:03] right so it's a natural tendency we've
[1:32:05] got to be careful that we don't fall
[1:32:08] into the natural tendency of trying to
[1:32:11] create
[1:32:12] our own church personality
[1:32:17] you you understand the only the parts of
[1:32:20] the message
[1:32:21] that
[1:32:22] i preach on
[1:32:24] i can't preach the whole message
[1:32:29] there's parts in there that are for you
[1:32:31] that you've got to listen to that you've
[1:32:34] got to take into your heart you've got
[1:32:37] to work out your own salvation with fear
[1:32:40] and trembling it it's not let's form
[1:32:45] these are the main subjects matters that
[1:32:48] we have we'll talk about election or
[1:32:51] we'll talk about uh uh our power over
[1:32:54] the devil
[1:32:55] and all those things are great things
[1:32:57] they're very exciting things but there's
[1:32:59] a lot of other things that's going on
[1:33:02] and one of the other things that's going
[1:33:03] on is satan appears as an angel of light
[1:33:08] now that might not be the most jump up
[1:33:10] and down sermon but i'm telling you it's
[1:33:13] true
[1:33:15] so i'm not saying getting rid of the
[1:33:17] jump and up and down that's great i
[1:33:19] don't want to hinder anybody except you
[1:33:22] can only run in one line
[1:33:25] because there's no room on the side and
[1:33:27] there's no room in front
[1:33:28] so you can run from the back door to the
[1:33:30] front door and all that you want
[1:33:33] you can jump out of your chair all you
[1:33:35] want you can raise all your hands all
[1:33:37] you want that's fine that doesn't bother
[1:33:39] me it doesn't mean a thing
[1:33:42] but when you meet
[1:33:45] this natural
[1:33:47] spirit
[1:33:49] you've got to be able to recognize the
[1:33:52] two spirits in the framework of the
[1:33:55] church
[1:33:58] and so we're talking about those two
[1:34:00] spirits not as being out there look as
[1:34:04] being in here
[1:34:08] he's already god out there
[1:34:12] you understand he's not he doesn't have
[1:34:14] to conquer that
[1:34:17] he's here
[1:34:19] trying to conquer our minds trying to
[1:34:22] conquer our independence your personal
[1:34:25] independence he's offering you group
[1:34:27] solutions
[1:34:30] it's like little clicks at school some
[1:34:32] of you are still in school you know how
[1:34:34] certain girls get together you know what
[1:34:36] i mean and and it could you know i don't
[1:34:38] know if it's by
[1:34:40] hairstyle or by dress size or but you
[1:34:43] know
[1:34:44] what interest grades you know i mean i
[1:34:46] always tried to hang around the smart
[1:34:48] people
[1:34:52] i was dumber in a rock but at least that
[1:34:54] is smart enough to hang out with the
[1:34:56] nerds
[1:35:00] because i knew all those other dumb
[1:35:01] rocks of friends were never going to get
[1:35:03] anywhere
[1:35:04] i wanted to know the people that would
[1:35:06] get somewhere in life
[1:35:09] so i i don't know the reasons that
[1:35:12] people
[1:35:13] that they hang together but it's their
[1:35:15] natural
[1:35:16] tendency
[1:35:18] to uh to
[1:35:20] uh hang together
[1:35:22] and and so represents the natural
[1:35:25] denomination israel represents the
[1:35:27] spiritual church israel there was a
[1:35:31] church
[1:35:32] true
[1:35:33] was that
[1:35:34] the bride of that day
[1:35:37] called out of egypt
[1:35:39] vindicated to be
[1:35:43] the
[1:35:44] truth
[1:35:46] vindicated to be the truth
[1:35:50] you are called out
[1:35:52] to be
[1:35:53] the
[1:35:55] truth
[1:35:58] you understand no deception in you no
[1:36:01] deceit in you no false word in you
[1:36:06] when they see you they see the what
[1:36:09] the truth jesus said i am the way the
[1:36:12] truth no man cometh unto the father but
[1:36:15] by me so the only way you could come to
[1:36:18] him is by the truth therefore you're
[1:36:20] vindicated to be the truth so what
[1:36:24] you're standing for can what you're
[1:36:26] representing is not a different line
[1:36:30] you're only representing one line that's
[1:36:33] his line and his line is the word
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:40] so let's don't keep putting this off
[1:36:44] so we all say the denomination is
[1:36:47] already there
[1:36:49] no that spirit is trying to denominate
[1:36:53] this bride
[1:36:55] it's a seduction spirit
[1:36:58] that's what it said they said the angel
[1:37:00] tried to seduce me that's what satan did
[1:37:03] he seduced eve by getting her to believe
[1:37:07] that his lie was god's truth
[1:37:12] i'll tell you where the truth is
[1:37:15] the truth is in the message that god's
[1:37:18] prophet delivered
[1:37:24] don't take it on any other basis
[1:37:28] you have the ability to read it yourself
[1:37:34] and if i say brother branham said go
[1:37:38] find it
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] i'm trying to save you the trouble
[1:37:47] by putting it up there
[1:37:50] read it
[1:37:52] yourself
[1:37:56] notice when they
[1:37:58] the two of them come together both of
[1:38:00] them offered the same sacrifice
[1:38:08] both built
[1:38:10] saw seven altars
[1:38:13] both offered up clean
[1:38:16] sacrificed oxen
[1:38:19] and they even offered up rams testifying
[1:38:23] that there was a coming
[1:38:25] messiah
[1:38:27] so they believed in
[1:38:28] what they all believed in jesus
[1:38:37] that's
[1:38:38] that's the key hold to denominations
[1:38:41] we're all the same
[1:38:43] we all believe in jesus
[1:38:46] how many knows with this spirit that
[1:38:48] they offered the same oxen they did this
[1:38:51] they did all that what did it lead to
[1:38:54] it led to the marriage
[1:38:57] of israel men
[1:38:59] and moabite women
[1:39:01] and vice versa
[1:39:03] it what did it do it polluted
[1:39:08] the pure bloodline
[1:39:10] of israel
[1:39:14] and god never forgave them
[1:39:17] for it
[1:39:19] in fact we know
[1:39:22] they didn't make it
[1:39:25] and and so he said he said they even
[1:39:28] offered up rams testifying the coming
[1:39:31] messiah fundamentally they were both
[1:39:33] exactly the same
[1:39:35] fundamentally they were both exactly
[1:39:40] the same
[1:39:42] they're saying the same thing
[1:39:44] they believe the same thing
[1:39:47] and so can we find out what goes on so
[1:39:50] we he says fundamentally they're exactly
[1:39:52] the same israel
[1:39:54] down in the valley moab up on the hill
[1:39:57] i i think that's just a beautiful
[1:39:59] reference isn't it to this six or seven
[1:40:02] hills or six hills in roman
[1:40:04] and uh
[1:40:05] and moab with seven altars israel with
[1:40:09] seven aldos moab with seven oxen israel
[1:40:12] with seven auctions moaz with seven rams
[1:40:15] speaking of the coming messiah israel
[1:40:18] with seven wrens what was the difference
[1:40:21] in them
[1:40:24] okay you've got these two lines
[1:40:28] that are just
[1:40:30] really
[1:40:31] identical
[1:40:33] so close it will receive the very
[1:40:36] elective possible
[1:40:38] and he says
[1:40:40] he says so
[1:40:42] what's the difference in them
[1:40:44] fundamentally both right
[1:40:46] but you see moab didn't have the
[1:40:49] vindication of god with them
[1:40:54] they were only a nation
[1:40:56] a group of celebrities
[1:40:59] but israel had a prophet with them
[1:41:04] now
[1:41:05] i'm going to say something here
[1:41:08] and i hope i don't offend
[1:41:12] too many people
[1:41:14] because you know me for a long time it's
[1:41:16] not in my spirit ever to offend anybody
[1:41:19] or call anybody out or to point out any
[1:41:22] wrong
[1:41:23] i'm the kindest gentlest person you've
[1:41:25] ever met
[1:41:29] he said
[1:41:30] but
[1:41:31] but they had a prophet with them
[1:41:34] they had a smitten rock with them
[1:41:37] they had a pillar of fire
[1:41:40] they had a brass serpent for healing
[1:41:42] they had the blessings of god moving
[1:41:45] right along with them and there
[1:41:49] they was the called out children of god
[1:41:53] now so what did moabite
[1:41:57] do
[1:41:58] they had a prophet
[1:42:00] and they had vindication
[1:42:03] but they didn't
[1:42:05] so what did they do
[1:42:08] they went and got one
[1:42:12] so we have a prophet too
[1:42:16] now they still have their line
[1:42:19] they still have their thought they still
[1:42:21] have their approach
[1:42:23] now that spirit
[1:42:26] is in the message so they went and got a
[1:42:30] prophet too they went and got william
[1:42:33] branham to be their prophet too
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:41] now they've got a prophet
[1:42:43] it just happens to be the same prophet
[1:42:46] the elect is god
[1:42:51] but they're preaching evidences
[1:42:54] they're preaching anointings
[1:42:57] they're preaching the holy spirit as a
[1:43:00] person
[1:43:05] the holy spirit is not a person
[1:43:09] it's an office
[1:43:11] the same spirit that was in jesus
[1:43:14] was the holy spirit
[1:43:17] the same spirit that was in the
[1:43:19] beginning
[1:43:21] was the holy spirit the holy spirit if i
[1:43:24] can quote this is the same god not in
[1:43:29] flesh form but in spirit form
[1:43:34] that's all
[1:43:36] you don't ask the fact the holy spirit
[1:43:40] or the holy ghost
[1:43:42] didn't even come to speak of itself
[1:43:46] but to bring you in remembrance of the
[1:43:49] word
[1:43:50] so when we say you need to be baptized
[1:43:53] with the holy ghost we are not talking
[1:43:56] about
[1:43:57] a
[1:43:58] a separate experience
[1:44:00] many people have
[1:44:02] intellectually come to the knowledge of
[1:44:05] jesus christ as savior
[1:44:08] and based on that they've changed their
[1:44:10] lives
[1:44:12] which is good
[1:44:13] but the
[1:44:15] experience
[1:44:18] of the true believer
[1:44:20] is to have the same spirit that was in
[1:44:24] jesus christ dwell in you
[1:44:27] and the works that i do shall you do
[1:44:32] also so you can we sometimes get
[1:44:36] starting to refer to as the holy spirit
[1:44:38] like it's something different
[1:44:41] the same holy spirit that makes you
[1:44:44] praise god
[1:44:45] is the whole same holy spirit that makes
[1:44:47] you read your bible
[1:44:52] it's the same spirit that makes you turn
[1:44:55] your car key on
[1:44:59] there's not a level
[1:45:02] that all of a sudden you say the
[1:45:04] spirit's here
[1:45:08] the spirit is here
[1:45:10] because the word
[1:45:12] said
[1:45:13] the spirit was here
[1:45:18] but
[1:45:19] now that the the they're measuring
[1:45:25] i'll tell you when you have a meeting
[1:45:28] because when someone hears the word of
[1:45:30] god
[1:45:31] they go home
[1:45:32] and they apply the token
[1:45:37] and satan's moved out of their life
[1:45:42] that's a meeting
[1:45:48] and i'm sure that people rejoiced at the
[1:45:51] loaves and fishes in the days of jesus
[1:45:55] let's go look at all the demons that
[1:45:57] were cast out after that meeting
[1:46:02] okay so
[1:46:03] this spirit see that now
[1:46:06] so they went and got one so now to this
[1:46:09] spirit
[1:46:11] now moves into the framework of the
[1:46:14] church is that right
[1:46:17] what happened at nicaea
[1:46:21] satan got access
[1:46:23] to the name of jesus christ
[1:46:27] and now started putting his
[1:46:29] same
[1:46:30] system his same line was now being
[1:46:34] presented in the name of jesus christ
[1:46:39] and now he's covered up
[1:46:42] so now this same spirit wants to get
[1:46:45] back into the bride
[1:46:47] so they've got to gain access
[1:46:49] so they go find themselves a prophet
[1:46:52] which just happens to be william branham
[1:46:54] and now they're trying to use william
[1:46:56] branham to bring their same line of
[1:46:59] thought
[1:47:04] that's what i see
[1:47:08] and
[1:47:09] i i just pray
[1:47:10] that
[1:47:11] you understand
[1:47:15] because
[1:47:16] this prophet began a real prophet of god
[1:47:20] begin to challenge a real prophet of god
[1:47:26] did you know that's right
[1:47:29] what happened
[1:47:31] ben was a real prophet of god he heard
[1:47:33] from god
[1:47:37] he sought the
[1:47:38] will of the word of the lord he was a
[1:47:40] real prophet
[1:47:42] now you've got a prophet challenging a
[1:47:44] prophet
[1:47:46] and let me tell you that spirit is in
[1:47:48] this message right now
[1:47:50] of challenging people whether they've
[1:47:53] got the holy ghost or not
[1:47:59] and providing an evidence thereof
[1:48:05] i know the secret of deliverance
[1:48:06] ministry
[1:48:09] you know how you have a deliverance
[1:48:10] ministry first of all you convict
[1:48:13] everybody that they're sinners
[1:48:18] and you're needy
[1:48:21] and you're short
[1:48:24] i don't mean height wise
[1:48:26] you're lacking in spiritual things
[1:48:29] you're not spiritual you're not where
[1:48:31] you should be
[1:48:32] you know
[1:48:33] you you're a secret sinner
[1:48:37] you think that's a new approach
[1:48:42] job
[1:48:44] sat there with boils
[1:48:48] lost everything
[1:48:52] had no appearance of any victory
[1:48:55] whatsoever
[1:48:57] and his friends
[1:49:00] this other line
[1:49:05] was there convicting him of being a
[1:49:08] secret sinner
[1:49:12] but what's the one thing that job knew
[1:49:16] he had offered the sacrifice according
[1:49:20] to the
[1:49:21] word of god
[1:49:29] you know
[1:49:30] you're a sinner
[1:49:32] you're a secret sinner
[1:49:34] god would be pouring out his blessings
[1:49:37] on you
[1:49:40] no
[1:49:42] you know what all that suffering got job
[1:49:45] the greatest revelation any believer
[1:49:50] should ever have
[1:49:51] though the skin worms eat my flesh yet i
[1:49:55] will see god
[1:49:58] glory to god
[1:50:02] you don't think that was worth
[1:50:04] everything to job
[1:50:07] it didn't matter to him anymore
[1:50:09] he knew he was going to live he knew he
[1:50:11] was going to
[1:50:13] come alive
[1:50:21] so
[1:50:22] that so he says
[1:50:24] he says now look at he said they had a
[1:50:28] the blessings of god moving right along
[1:50:30] with them
[1:50:31] and they was the called out children of
[1:50:34] god 104. now we find that so perfectly
[1:50:38] types
[1:50:39] here in them churches of
[1:50:42] today
[1:50:46] as moab was
[1:50:48] not so
[1:50:50] israel was sojourner from place to place
[1:50:54] wherever the pillar of fire moved they
[1:50:57] moved with it
[1:50:58] moab not so they were settled down in
[1:51:02] their own denomination
[1:51:04] down in their own nation
[1:51:06] they didn't move
[1:51:09] they stayed
[1:51:10] there
[1:51:15] that's that comes very personal
[1:51:18] are you moving let's look at ourselves
[1:51:21] individually
[1:51:23] and i'll i'll be the question
[1:51:26] asker
[1:51:28] which i have to answer myself
[1:51:31] am i
[1:51:32] moving with god
[1:51:36] have i been in the same spiritual place
[1:51:40] have i have i prayed for
[1:51:44] revelation
[1:51:47] have i asked god to
[1:51:50] move on my spirit
[1:51:52] to transform me more like him or if and
[1:51:56] this is what we do and this is real
[1:51:59] common with teenagers and
[1:52:01] and if you've lived a while and you've
[1:52:03] raised a few you understand that
[1:52:06] that they come along and they find
[1:52:08] little comfort pockets
[1:52:13] a certain style
[1:52:15] a certain this a certain that
[1:52:17] you know i mean if you go back and look
[1:52:19] at
[1:52:21] some hairdos out of the 50s
[1:52:24] none of you would do that
[1:52:26] they took a comb
[1:52:29] and they puffed their hair way up like
[1:52:31] this and then they took a big ball of
[1:52:33] hair and stuck it in there you know and
[1:52:35] and you'd look at those hairstyles today
[1:52:37] and you'd go home but every kid had them
[1:52:44] the flip the feet
[1:52:47] you know
[1:52:52] do so any of your black sisters remember
[1:52:54] the afros
[1:52:56] i don't know why they called them afros
[1:52:58] i didn't see any when i was in africa
[1:53:01] they were american froze
[1:53:05] you don't see that anymore
[1:53:09] you
[1:53:10] know i never saw an extension when i was
[1:53:14] in school
[1:53:15] i love them nothing against them wear
[1:53:17] your hair any way you want to just don't
[1:53:19] cut it
[1:53:23] but we find pockets
[1:53:25] of comfort
[1:53:28] we find groups of comfort
[1:53:30] people we're comfortable with people
[1:53:33] that don't challenge us and if you're
[1:53:34] not careful god's pulling on your heart
[1:53:37] to move on with him and you'd want to
[1:53:40] stay put
[1:53:43] and that's the worst
[1:53:45] thing that can happen
[1:53:48] to a local assembly is when you get such
[1:53:51] a group
[1:53:52] feeling about yourself such a group
[1:53:55] anointing such a comforting song service
[1:53:58] that everybody just wants to get there
[1:54:01] and stay put
[1:54:04] but what does the eagle have to do
[1:54:07] eventually he's got to kick you out of
[1:54:11] your
[1:54:12] nest
[1:54:15] and sometimes we hop from one nest to
[1:54:17] another nest to another nest and that's
[1:54:20] fine just as long as you're moving up
[1:54:25] so if you're going to go from one nest
[1:54:27] to the other make sure it's out up the
[1:54:30] mountain towards the sky
[1:54:32] don't keep moving down into the world
[1:54:41] so
[1:54:42] this is a spirit
[1:54:45] that meets us along the way
[1:54:48] to stay put
[1:54:52] to get in a comfort zone to get a job
[1:54:55] get in the lifestyle get in our income
[1:54:57] set our budget
[1:54:59] and then i'm just going to fulfill
[1:55:02] the system
[1:55:05] i'm going to give my offering my tithes
[1:55:06] i'm going to go to church on sunday i'm
[1:55:08] going to go back to my job
[1:55:10] no
[1:55:12] this spirit that's the spirit of the
[1:55:15] other
[1:55:16] line the spirit of god's line is they're
[1:55:20] a sojourner
[1:55:22] they're moving they're moving into
[1:55:24] revelation they're moving into
[1:55:27] further thing they're praying for
[1:55:28] revelation
[1:55:29] god is taking the individual and
[1:55:33] transforming that individual into the
[1:55:36] image of his son
[1:55:40] and he wants to express himself
[1:55:44] in you the way he made you the way that
[1:55:49] he wants to by the attributes and
[1:55:52] characteristics and gifts he gave you
[1:55:58] don't be ashamed of christ in you
[1:56:01] because it's the hope of
[1:56:04] glory
[1:56:08] he says
[1:56:10] so they didn't move they were set they
[1:56:12] didn't move they stayed right there
[1:56:15] they had their celebrities
[1:56:19] maybe their revivalists listen what he
[1:56:21] said they had ordained things
[1:56:25] as they should do
[1:56:27] and they had their warriors
[1:56:30] that's preachers
[1:56:32] they had their fighters
[1:56:34] they had their king
[1:56:37] they got a lot
[1:56:40] of their orders from and so on
[1:56:43] but muam saw israel with something they
[1:56:46] didn't have
[1:56:47] and they sent over this is the
[1:56:50] paragraph 105 they didn't have so they
[1:56:52] sent over to another country and hired a
[1:56:55] prophet to come over so they could have
[1:56:58] a prophet and would have the power
[1:57:01] amongst them just like israel
[1:57:04] had
[1:57:05] amongst them
[1:57:07] now we're just going to close up here
[1:57:10] on these two lines and we're going to
[1:57:16] we're going to
[1:57:17] come down
[1:57:19] here and read
[1:57:22] and so they're talking they both have
[1:57:24] the same prophets they both have the
[1:57:26] same things let's go to paragraph 111.
[1:57:31] he said so
[1:57:33] i mean 110.
[1:57:35] and some of them said god said do this
[1:57:38] and god said do that now i don't
[1:57:41] question that
[1:57:43] but if it's out of the line of god's
[1:57:46] word
[1:57:47] the prophet no matter if he be is a
[1:57:50] prophet he's out of the line
[1:57:53] so many people get deceived like that
[1:57:57] oh this brother can do this and this
[1:57:59] brother can do that and deny the word
[1:58:04] so you understand he's pointing out this
[1:58:06] is where people get deceived
[1:58:09] is by the two lines
[1:58:12] because they're so close
[1:58:16] now you say brother gary what am i going
[1:58:18] to do
[1:58:19] the message
[1:58:21] came
[1:58:22] to reveal
[1:58:24] the son of perdition
[1:58:29] and that's why we get i sav
[1:58:32] that we can see
[1:58:34] now
[1:58:35] you think oh i'm overwhelmed i can never
[1:58:38] fight this devil
[1:58:40] god gave you the weapon to fight him
[1:58:42] with
[1:58:44] and he promised i will not leave you nor
[1:58:47] forsake you
[1:58:48] let's just close real quick here he says
[1:58:57] now i don't
[1:58:59] question that
[1:59:00] but if it's not the like he says
[1:59:02] the prophet no matter if he's a prophet
[1:59:04] he's out of the line
[1:59:07] so many people get deceived like that
[1:59:10] though i speak with tongues
[1:59:13] of men and angels
[1:59:15] though that i have gifts
[1:59:18] that i can move mountains
[1:59:21] i give all my goods to feed the poor
[1:59:25] yet i am
[1:59:27] nothing
[1:59:29] many will come
[1:59:30] to me in that day and say
[1:59:34] lord lord have i not prophesied in your
[1:59:38] name now i want you to understand this
[1:59:41] spirit
[1:59:42] it's doing works
[1:59:45] it's doing wonders
[1:59:48] they're standing up and prophesying
[1:59:51] and speaking in tongues
[1:59:56] there's everything is going on
[2:00:01] that you would think
[2:00:03] that that's god
[2:00:09] now you've got to know something so you
[2:00:13] have got to have an absolute
[2:00:16] something that your anchor to that you
[2:00:19] know is the vindicated true word of god
[2:00:25] else not what's moving you
[2:00:30] the move is moving you
[2:00:34] the very spirit
[2:00:37] that's in the framework of the church is
[2:00:40] what's moving
[2:00:42] it's what's influencing
[2:00:44] it's raising questions
[2:00:47] in your mind
[2:00:49] it's challenging you
[2:00:52] just like the prophet
[2:00:55] challenged
[2:00:56] uh
[2:00:58] challenged moses
[2:01:02] do you got the holy ghost
[2:01:06] is your church on fire
[2:01:10] is your pastor preaching the move
[2:01:13] of god
[2:01:19] i know god's move
[2:01:23] it's that pillar of fire
[2:01:25] the church moves with the
[2:01:28] pillar
[2:01:29] of fire
[2:01:33] that's what the church moves with
[2:01:36] as that fire goes into the storehouse
[2:01:40] and brings the food out
[2:01:43] and feeds it
[2:01:46] but they won't even play tapes
[2:01:53] no they'll say brother branham brother
[2:01:55] bran and brother bran and brother bran
[2:01:57] and brother brown because they've got a
[2:01:58] prophet too
[2:02:04] but tell you what he said
[2:02:10] they might say he said
[2:02:15] it's your responsibility
[2:02:27] except
[2:02:29] and yet i'm nothing many will come to me
[2:02:32] in that day and say lord lord have i not
[2:02:35] prophesied in the name
[2:02:37] have i not in your name
[2:02:40] i've cast out devils in done mighty
[2:02:42] works
[2:02:43] and i will say unto them depart
[2:02:48] from you depart from me you workers of
[2:02:52] iniquity
[2:02:53] i never even knew you
[2:02:55] yet they come
[2:02:57] with a confession
[2:02:59] that they have did it
[2:03:05] that's their confession
[2:03:08] we did that
[2:03:17] yet they come with the confession that
[2:03:19] they did it but jesus said they were
[2:03:22] workers of iniquity what is iniquity
[2:03:25] it's something that you know you should
[2:03:28] do
[2:03:29] that's right to do and yet you don't do
[2:03:32] it
[2:03:33] see what is going to be in the
[2:03:38] last
[2:03:40] days now let me tell you something
[2:03:43] brother branham was a prophet
[2:03:46] you understand if everything that he
[2:03:48] spoke was so obvious then
[2:03:53] we would have never recognized the
[2:03:56] spirituality of it
[2:04:02] they just thought brother branham was a
[2:04:04] crank
[2:04:06] they just thought he was a critic
[2:04:08] but he was literally pointing out the
[2:04:11] son of perdition
[2:04:13] trying to come in and seduce the bride
[2:04:17] of jesus christ
[2:04:21] and telling us
[2:04:23] and prophesying to us
[2:04:25] the things that
[2:04:27] were there
[2:04:29] and he says so
[2:04:31] he says here's the whole line
[2:04:34] and that's my purpose tonight
[2:04:36] i said i'd be out at nine o'clock but
[2:04:39] i'm going to be a little
[2:04:42] bit after maybe
[2:04:43] look at
[2:04:46] look that was my whole purpose to show
[2:04:50] you this line
[2:04:52] by the word of god
[2:04:55] the god has to keep his word
[2:04:58] in order
[2:05:00] to stay
[2:05:01] god
[2:05:04] so
[2:05:05] we can go on we know that baal god spoke
[2:05:08] to balaam and yet he didn't
[2:05:11] he didn't take the answer that god gave
[2:05:14] him
[2:05:17] that you know
[2:05:19] brother bram said a lot of things that
[2:05:21] people just don't want to take
[2:05:24] one you can receive the holy ghost
[2:05:26] without sensation
[2:05:29] what the evidence of the holy ghost
[2:05:31] really is
[2:05:33] what the holy ghost really is
[2:05:36] it's the spirit of jesus christ
[2:05:40] the thing you're going to be raptured by
[2:05:42] is the same spirit that well dwelt in
[2:05:44] jesus christ
[2:05:46] dwelling in you
[2:05:49] so it it it's a a beautiful thing so we
[2:05:53] can see this lines they'll fuss and
[2:05:55] they'll debate they'll do all that but
[2:05:58] let's just turn over here to paragraph
[2:06:03] 1
[2:06:04] 23
[2:06:05] and and we'll just finish up with this
[2:06:08] next few paragraphs because
[2:06:10] now we want to talk about
[2:06:13] where we've been talking about that line
[2:06:17] okay another
[2:06:19] another characteristic of that line
[2:06:22] is
[2:06:24] in paragraph
[2:06:27] 130 he says
[2:06:29] you know i'm able to promote you
[2:06:31] look where he's getting his word from
[2:06:35] the head
[2:06:36] of the nation
[2:06:37] where did moses getting his word
[2:06:40] the king of heaven
[2:06:43] amen so we understand how
[2:06:46] that this spirit promoted itself
[2:06:52] i probably i hope you're still with me
[2:06:56] but even in our ranks what happens is
[2:06:59] ministers get promoted
[2:07:04] they get promoted to fame
[2:07:06] they get promoted to a bigger name
[2:07:09] they get promoted to bigger meetings
[2:07:14] they become headliners
[2:07:21] so so this is that line
[2:07:23] you you know you begin to look at that
[2:07:26] line you look at where they're getting
[2:07:27] their orders from you you look at the
[2:07:30] things that are are going around you you
[2:07:34] start to measure them
[2:07:36] but we don't measure ourselves by that
[2:07:38] line
[2:07:40] you understand we don't measure
[2:07:42] ourselves by that standard
[2:07:45] you know they measure themselves by a
[2:07:47] better class of people
[2:07:50] they don't want poor
[2:07:52] people even though god came to the poor
[2:07:55] of this world rich in faith
[2:07:58] they like a better class of people
[2:08:01] the working-class people the person that
[2:08:05] maybe doesn't
[2:08:06] have all the same ways
[2:08:09] they don't get sucked up into fellowship
[2:08:13] they sit around the table begging crumbs
[2:08:18] and then people get lifted up
[2:08:20] they've got names they're
[2:08:22] they
[2:08:23] they've got
[2:08:24] great influence a
[2:08:26] better class of people they they go for
[2:08:29] personality
[2:08:31] the personality of the preacher
[2:08:34] it doesn't you know
[2:08:36] pair really what he's saying
[2:08:39] now he's accepted because of his
[2:08:41] personalities accepted because of his
[2:08:43] fame he's accepted because of his style
[2:08:51] measure somebody
[2:08:53] by the truth
[2:08:57] eat
[2:08:58] you know eat the pie spit out the seeds
[2:09:02] but look at the whole content
[2:09:05] of the message
[2:09:08] we're into buzzwords
[2:09:12] right
[2:09:13] say the buzzword
[2:09:15] that's all you got to hear so i'm
[2:09:17] waiting do i hear the buzzword why do
[2:09:19] they call the buzzword because i press
[2:09:21] your button and you start buzzing
[2:09:28] we want to go forward don't we we want
[2:09:30] to go higher we've got to understand
[2:09:33] there is a spirit
[2:09:36] another line
[2:09:38] that wants to interbreed
[2:09:42] and that's what the moaiths did
[2:09:44] in israel did they mix the two lines
[2:09:52] and and we know something else about uh
[2:09:56] uh
[2:09:57] moab's group they they never liked their
[2:09:59] true believer anyway
[2:10:01] down in their heart we judge people by
[2:10:04] we judge people by buildings
[2:10:07] and by beauty
[2:10:10] numbers
[2:10:12] numbers don't mean nothing
[2:10:15] number means you've got more deceived
[2:10:17] people in your midst
[2:10:22] you've got more make-believers more
[2:10:24] unbelievers
[2:10:27] numbers don't mean anything
[2:10:29] numbers shouldn't mean a thing to you
[2:10:32] one thing should move you
[2:10:34] that's the word of god
[2:10:36] so you know
[2:10:38] our worship becomes the way that we
[2:10:41] worship we base it on talent
[2:10:43] that's that line
[2:10:47] how many people get in that spirit and
[2:10:50] now they become they become
[2:10:52] performers
[2:10:56] oh yeah i've seen it
[2:11:02] now i'm going to perform
[2:11:06] they get a yodel in their voice
[2:11:09] they're in the spotlight
[2:11:11] you don't think the spotlight moves you
[2:11:14] sure
[2:11:16] it affects us
[2:11:19] we become talented you know we don't
[2:11:21] want to sit in the corner
[2:11:25] you know we don't want to sing behind
[2:11:26] the piano we don't want to sing
[2:11:29] you know
[2:11:30] pretty soon
[2:11:32] we're performers
[2:11:33] put me in the spotlight
[2:11:48] i'm for it
[2:11:50] if it's genuine
[2:11:53] but let me tell you about a genuine trip
[2:11:55] to the altar
[2:11:58] you're not dancing and running in the
[2:12:01] spirit in one service and at the altar
[2:12:05] in the next
[2:12:12] something created
[2:12:14] the change
[2:12:16] it was the mixing
[2:12:18] of the lines
[2:12:21] am i preaching too hard
[2:12:27] it's a mixing of the lines
[2:12:32] and and it's not bad it's just that
[2:12:36] you've got to know it for yourself
[2:12:38] the people are of of
[2:12:41] of that moabite line that's what they
[2:12:44] are
[2:12:46] okay that's fine
[2:12:48] we are mixed together
[2:12:52] the two seeds grow up together
[2:12:55] but it's you
[2:12:58] you that's got to be able to make sure
[2:13:02] that you can recognize that and you're
[2:13:05] not going to be moved by that and you
[2:13:08] have your absolute
[2:13:13] you know who you're following
[2:13:16] we played the tape wednesday night
[2:13:19] called faith
[2:13:22] and
[2:13:23] and
[2:13:26] people say well why do you play a prayer
[2:13:28] line from 50 years ago
[2:13:31] i'll tell you why
[2:13:33] because 50 years ago that was the word
[2:13:38] and he is the word and when we played
[2:13:41] that tape he
[2:13:43] was here
[2:13:47] he was
[2:13:48] doing the same things because he got
[2:13:52] they say god dwells in his church
[2:13:56] our line god dwells in his word
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:03] we're reading a sermon
[2:14:07] that's 50 years old
[2:14:09] and it's more true
[2:14:11] right now in this hour they didn't even
[2:14:14] recognize it then
[2:14:19] they weren't there for what he was
[2:14:21] teaching they were there for the loaves
[2:14:23] and the fishes they were there for the
[2:14:25] miracles
[2:14:27] they were there to see if they could
[2:14:29] imitate it
[2:14:34] and they always tried to criticize it
[2:14:36] they were jealous of it in
[2:14:38] everything these are things that you
[2:14:42] and i would tell you but you cannot
[2:14:44] escape
[2:14:46] the challenge
[2:14:49] that's being present it to us
[2:14:52] to eat our bread
[2:14:54] with singleness
[2:14:56] of heart
[2:14:57] and to work out our salvation
[2:15:00] with fear
[2:15:02] and
[2:15:04] trembling
[2:15:05] and and so that that was this line but
[2:15:08] let's just talk about our line for a
[2:15:10] second
[2:15:13] okay
[2:15:14] he said that let's just start it with
[2:15:16] this paragraph we'll read this and we be
[2:15:18] finished
[2:15:19] down in his heart he didn't like them
[2:15:22] they wasn't of his group
[2:15:25] and anything that didn't belong in his
[2:15:28] group wasn't right to begin with
[2:15:32] see
[2:15:33] he looked down at them and said
[2:15:37] there has been some awful thing
[2:15:40] then people did
[2:15:42] surely a holy god will curse such a
[2:15:45] people as that
[2:15:48] they
[2:15:49] they're they're illiterate
[2:15:52] they're not educated like us
[2:15:55] we're a smarter people
[2:15:57] oh they claim to serve god
[2:16:00] but look at them
[2:16:02] what are they
[2:16:03] a bunch of why a bunch of slaves
[2:16:07] mud daubers
[2:16:08] that the egyptians run out down there
[2:16:11] why god
[2:16:13] would never have anything to do with a
[2:16:16] dirty bunch like that
[2:16:21] oh god's not gonna have anything to do
[2:16:23] with somebody that sits there solid as a
[2:16:25] rock
[2:16:27] and believes every word now just listen
[2:16:29] closely
[2:16:30] we're talking about our line now
[2:16:33] where we come from
[2:16:35] what our characteristics are
[2:16:38] he failed to see that smitten rock
[2:16:41] and that
[2:16:42] brass serpent
[2:16:45] that pillar of fire
[2:16:47] he tried to judge them from a moral
[2:16:51] standpoint
[2:16:57] i can't come here every service and keep
[2:17:00] judging you
[2:17:01] by your moral standpoint
[2:17:04] and see if i can fall on some
[2:17:06] shortcoming
[2:17:08] that makes you feel
[2:17:10] that
[2:17:11] you're not living up to my christian
[2:17:14] moral standard
[2:17:19] now just think of that
[2:17:22] you're not living up
[2:17:27] to the moral standard
[2:17:31] look okay
[2:17:34] you desire to be more like the lord
[2:17:36] jesus
[2:17:38] you'll lose that
[2:17:39] when you
[2:17:40] think you've got it
[2:17:42] you will never
[2:17:44] ever
[2:17:46] think that you're good enough for god
[2:17:48] you will always have a desire to be more
[2:17:52] godly to be more free from unbelief
[2:17:54] could be more thin
[2:17:59] you will always feel unworthy
[2:18:03] i'll step out of this pulpit and i'll go
[2:18:05] to my office and i'll feel like a
[2:18:08] hypocrite
[2:18:12] i won't want to come back tonight
[2:18:16] i want to run and hide
[2:18:19] i'm going to say to myself who do you
[2:18:21] think you are
[2:18:22] you go in there and you say these things
[2:18:24] you're a nobody
[2:18:28] that's just the way it is
[2:18:31] but there's one thing i know
[2:18:34] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[2:18:37] from all unrighteousness
[2:18:40] he said it
[2:18:42] i believe it
[2:18:45] now listen to our line here as we close
[2:18:48] this morning
[2:18:50] he failed to see the smitten rock the
[2:18:52] brass serpent the pillar of fire he
[2:18:54] tried to judge them from a moral
[2:18:56] standpoint
[2:18:59] he failed to see
[2:19:01] the higher calling of god
[2:19:08] he failed to see the higher calling of
[2:19:12] god
[2:19:13] by grace
[2:19:14] by election
[2:19:17] they were in that line
[2:19:20] and with god's word they were in that
[2:19:24] line by grace
[2:19:27] by election now let's look at their
[2:19:29] characteristic
[2:19:31] they
[2:19:33] they were in that line they're with
[2:19:35] god's word and when he wanted to curse
[2:19:38] them god said don't you do it they're
[2:19:41] mine
[2:19:42] leave them alone don't touch them
[2:19:47] he said
[2:19:49] now so the man turned around went back
[2:19:53] now watch his denomination headquarters
[2:19:56] though he he he gets back
[2:19:59] they send more influential group
[2:20:03] this time
[2:20:04] they might have some
[2:20:06] instead of regular layman
[2:20:09] they have some doctors of divinity
[2:20:13] that come this time
[2:20:14] they might have bishops
[2:20:17] or maybe state presbyters
[2:20:19] they send a better group
[2:20:22] and a little more influential group
[2:20:25] somebody that had a little better
[2:20:27] education to lay it out in in plain
[2:20:33] out the plane to him better
[2:20:36] could it make
[2:20:38] it could make it reasonable
[2:20:44] you know they don't stay with just what
[2:20:46] the prophet said
[2:20:48] yes
[2:20:49] they're going to make it a little better
[2:20:51] a little more reasonable
[2:20:53] a little more palatable
[2:20:55] brother branham says some things that
[2:20:57] are extremely unpalatable
[2:21:03] he calls billy graham an angel
[2:21:06] and oral robert's an angel
[2:21:08] and
[2:21:09] he's the
[2:21:10] one that
[2:21:12] elohim stayed back with
[2:21:15] you think the world jumped up and down
[2:21:17] at the stuff he was saying
[2:21:20] they threw him out
[2:21:25] this message does not draw a crowd
[2:21:30] and because the message don't draw a
[2:21:32] crowd they try to substitute it
[2:21:35] with emotions anointings
[2:21:38] feelings and everything else
[2:21:41] somebody a little more influential
[2:21:44] someone who can get to you
[2:21:47] a little better
[2:21:49] who can explain it a little better who
[2:21:52] might have influence on you that maybe
[2:21:55] the local pastor doesn't have or or the
[2:21:58] humble church doesn't have or the little
[2:22:01] backwards brother
[2:22:03] doesn't have
[2:22:08] you know but paul said i didn't come to
[2:22:10] you with enticing words
[2:22:12] i came to you with power and
[2:22:14] demonstration of the spirit do you
[2:22:16] understand what we're reading this
[2:22:18] morning is the power and demonstration
[2:22:22] of the spirit of god to expose satan
[2:22:26] right where he's at
[2:22:31] even
[2:22:32] jesus said if you can't believe me for
[2:22:34] my word believe me for my works
[2:22:38] but what does the elect do
[2:22:40] they believe him for his word
[2:22:44] the works attracted them
[2:22:47] but they believed they believe for the
[2:22:50] word
[2:22:51] and so if he said a better more info
[2:22:53] somebody that can lay it out plainer
[2:22:57] because they want to move you
[2:23:01] into their line in their approach
[2:23:04] because they think that's what's best
[2:23:07] for you
[2:23:09] their motives aren't wrong their
[2:23:11] objectives aren't wrong they think
[2:23:13] they're helping they think they're doing
[2:23:15] god a service but let me tell you this
[2:23:18] is thus
[2:23:19] saith the lord god gave you the best
[2:23:23] weapon he could give you when he gave
[2:23:26] you the word of god in the form of this
[2:23:29] message
[2:23:33] that's what you need to be married to
[2:23:37] amen
[2:23:40] he said now listen to this
[2:23:42] this is us
[2:23:44] this is our line
[2:23:46] this is the line that we're a part of
[2:23:49] we cast down reasoning
[2:23:53] we believe god
[2:23:55] no matter what
[2:23:56] any
[2:23:58] thing else says we believe god
[2:24:02] we don't reason what god says
[2:24:06] you can't reason with it
[2:24:08] you have to accept it by
[2:24:12] faith
[2:24:14] now just turn with me real quick if you
[2:24:16] would
[2:24:18] to luke
[2:24:26] we just talked about this group right
[2:24:28] the higher calling
[2:24:30] look at luke
[2:24:32] 10
[2:24:34] and and
[2:24:36] we'll start with verse 17.
[2:24:38] i am closing i just got to close
[2:24:42] and
[2:24:43] and the 70 returned you know the story
[2:24:46] he sent him out the 70 out
[2:24:48] he said in the 70 returned again with
[2:24:51] joy saying lord even the devils are
[2:24:54] subject unto us
[2:24:57] through thy name
[2:24:59] and he said unto them i beheld satan
[2:25:02] satan has lightning falling from the
[2:25:05] heavens
[2:25:06] behold i give unto you power
[2:25:09] to tread on serpents and scorpions
[2:25:12] and
[2:25:13] over all the power of the enemy
[2:25:16] and nothing
[2:25:18] shall be any means hurt you
[2:25:22] notwithstanding
[2:25:23] in this rejoice not
[2:25:28] but rejoice because your names are
[2:25:32] written in heaven
[2:25:36] hallelujah for the lamb's book of life
[2:25:40] that's what you read
[2:25:42] you rejoice for the higher calling
[2:25:45] by grace
[2:25:47] and by election
[2:25:50] if you have your bibles there we'll just
[2:25:52] flip over again to luke the 18th chapter
[2:25:56] and we'll read this
[2:25:58] verse there
[2:26:00] he said
[2:26:01] we cast down reasonings
[2:26:06] you don't have to reason anymore
[2:26:09] he said you have accepted it by faith
[2:26:12] so
[2:26:13] this is
[2:26:14] what
[2:26:15] we are trying
[2:26:17] our line has got to come into is faith
[2:26:22] and anything that you know you don't
[2:26:25] have to reason anymore
[2:26:27] i don't know how he does it
[2:26:30] i just believe
[2:26:32] he doesn't
[2:26:33] i don't know how he is going to keep
[2:26:36] that promise
[2:26:37] but he said he would do it i believe it
[2:26:41] i accept it on the basis that i believe
[2:26:46] that it's the word of god
[2:26:52] no sensation
[2:26:54] no anointing feeling
[2:26:56] just god said so i said that
[2:26:59] you say well you can't get
[2:27:02] by with that
[2:27:04] i don't know how i'll get by with it but
[2:27:08] he said
[2:27:09] so
[2:27:10] i remember my baptist pastor told me he
[2:27:13] said why billy you will preach to the
[2:27:16] post of the church
[2:27:18] why you think anybody will hear a thing
[2:27:21] like that
[2:27:22] i said god
[2:27:24] has said so
[2:27:27] how are you going
[2:27:28] to
[2:27:29] with a seventh grade education
[2:27:32] pray for kings and preachers around the
[2:27:35] world i said i don't know
[2:27:38] how i'm going to do it
[2:27:41] but he said so and that's just good
[2:27:45] enough for me see
[2:27:48] he said so i don't know how it's going
[2:27:51] to be done but it's based on he
[2:27:55] said so alone
[2:27:59] so if malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 in
[2:28:03] revelations 10 7
[2:28:06] is the vindicated
[2:28:08] scriptures that were to be fulfilled in
[2:28:11] our age
[2:28:13] and we can look
[2:28:14] past the veil
[2:28:16] and see that was none other than the
[2:28:19] same lord jesus christ back in spirit
[2:28:22] form
[2:28:23] veiling himself in a messenger doing the
[2:28:26] same works
[2:28:29] then i believe we can have confidence in
[2:28:32] what he said
[2:28:35] and not be moved
[2:28:38] to another line of thought for any other
[2:28:43] presentation
[2:28:44] or any other
[2:28:47] uh
[2:28:48] something that's more explainable has
[2:28:50] greater feelings seems to have greater
[2:28:53] movement seems to have greater thing
[2:28:58] because it's not a group
[2:29:03] it's you
[2:29:05] sitting on your couch
[2:29:08] clicking on your recorder
[2:29:10] and knowing that god is speaking to you
[2:29:15] does that do away with the five-fold
[2:29:17] ministry no he uses the fightful
[2:29:20] ministry to bring things to your
[2:29:22] remembrance
[2:29:23] but the five-fold ministry is not to
[2:29:27] take the place of the husband and wife
[2:29:30] relationship in the bride
[2:29:37] so we come to see
[2:29:39] that we're not measured by
[2:29:42] anything
[2:29:43] what we're measured by is faith
[2:29:48] we're measured by god said so
[2:29:51] i don't know how
[2:29:53] i don't know when but if he said so that
[2:29:56] settles it
[2:29:58] he said i was elected i may not look
[2:30:01] elected i may not act elected i may have
[2:30:04] a lot of shortcomings but i'll tell you
[2:30:07] one thing he said so that settles it
[2:30:12] so do you believe it
[2:30:14] when he tells you your name's written in
[2:30:16] the lamb's book of life do you believe
[2:30:19] it when he tells you that your sins are
[2:30:21] washed away do you believe that you can
[2:30:24] have whatsoever things you ask
[2:30:28] do you believe
[2:30:31] so do that understand god's not looking
[2:30:34] to the beauty
[2:30:36] he's not looking for the emotion he's
[2:30:38] not looking for the intellectual
[2:30:40] explanation he's not looking for a
[2:30:43] system that's got great preachers and
[2:30:45] great outpourings and great things he's
[2:30:48] not looking at a group
[2:30:52] he's looking at you
[2:30:56] and your individual faith
[2:30:59] in him
[2:31:02] that's what he wants to cultivate
[2:31:07] that you say to this mountain
[2:31:09] be moved
[2:31:12] that you say to this tree be plucked up
[2:31:16] and you can have it
[2:31:18] amen
[2:31:21] don't be afraid to move up the ladder
[2:31:25] and take the power of the resurrection
[2:31:28] into your life and start claiming the
[2:31:30] things you want loved ones sick children
[2:31:33] sick parents lost children
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:38] whatever it is
[2:31:41] that's what he wants to see
[2:31:44] forget the substitute
[2:31:47] i would that you would all stand up and
[2:31:49] jump up and down like jumping jacks
[2:31:51] praise god i love to praise god
[2:31:54] i would that you spoke in tongues i've
[2:31:56] spoken tongues more than all of you
[2:31:59] praise god
[2:32:02] but when it the curtains closed
[2:32:06] and the show's over
[2:32:11] are you married to this
[2:32:16] or you're positive of it
[2:32:19] nothing wavers you
[2:32:21] nothing questions you nothing raises
[2:32:23] doubt
[2:32:26] i can grab the tambourine and dance down
[2:32:29] the beach with miriam
[2:32:31] but i know when moses speaks
[2:32:34] it's thus saith the lord
[2:32:38] the two lines
[2:32:41] and if we read this scripture
[2:32:43] let's stand together as we read this
[2:32:44] scripture
[2:32:53] superbowl the widow who sought
[2:32:56] the judge and
[2:32:59] and
[2:33:00] wouldn't let him go
[2:33:01] until
[2:33:02] she got what she asked for
[2:33:05] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[2:33:09] judge said
[2:33:11] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[2:33:16] which cry day and night unto him
[2:33:20] though he bear long with them
[2:33:25] i tell you
[2:33:27] that he will avenge them speedily
[2:33:30] nevertheless
[2:33:32] when the son of man cometh
[2:33:35] shall he
[2:33:37] find
[2:33:38] faith
[2:33:39] on the earth
[2:33:43] this message was a restoration
[2:33:46] of the position of the believer
[2:33:50] to take god
[2:33:52] at his word
[2:33:56] if anything god wants moving let
[2:33:59] it be
[2:34:00] faith
[2:34:01] first
[2:34:03] the church is built on faith the
[2:34:05] individual's built on faith
[2:34:11] all things are possible
[2:34:14] only believe
[2:34:15] let us rise in the arms of faith
[2:34:19] let us not be moved by
[2:34:21] whatever the world's doing we're not
[2:34:23] going to pattern ourselves
[2:34:25] after the way this
[2:34:27] world holds their
[2:34:30] services
[2:34:32] we're not going to worship according to
[2:34:35] what's the top 10 hip parade
[2:34:37] song
[2:34:41] you know we don't need to have a light
[2:34:43] show here
[2:34:46] we don't have to have a mini concert
[2:34:50] but what we have to have
[2:34:52] is faith
[2:34:56] you've got to have the faith that if
[2:34:57] you've got a devil
[2:35:00] that's parked in your life
[2:35:04] you'll never sing them out of there
[2:35:07] you'll never shout them out of there
[2:35:10] you'll never lay hands on them and
[2:35:13] have them come out of there
[2:35:17] the only thing that moves him
[2:35:18] is faith
[2:35:22] satan
[2:35:24] you're in my life
[2:35:26] and my life belongs to him
[2:35:29] and this is what the word says
[2:35:34] now that other line will offer you a
[2:35:36] substitute
[2:35:37] it'll offer you an emotion it'll offer
[2:35:40] you some deliverance
[2:35:44] my prayer will cast them out
[2:35:47] no
[2:35:48] everything you ever read if thou can't
[2:35:50] believe
[2:35:52] if doubts can't believe
[2:35:54] if they shall believe
[2:35:57] you shall lay hands on them and cows if
[2:36:00] they shall believe these works will
[2:36:02] follow them
[2:36:04] that believe
[2:36:08] it's not in a movement
[2:36:11] it's in you
[2:36:13] and he's given you the faith
[2:36:17] it comes with the seed
[2:36:20] and the high calling
[2:36:23] that's why paul said let's leave those
[2:36:24] things watch our behind behind and press
[2:36:27] for the
[2:36:29] high calling
[2:36:34] that's where we want to go
[2:36:36] we want to go to the hyde calling
[2:36:39] silver and gold
[2:36:41] have i none but as doubt can believe
[2:36:43] rise up and walk
[2:36:46] you can have what you asked for this
[2:36:48] morning don't be proud if your
[2:36:51] marriage is
[2:36:54] you're maybe a fussing a little and
[2:36:56] you're a little upset or there's a
[2:36:59] misunderstanding
[2:37:01] or those things we have

[2:37:29] let's go to the line that we're called
[2:37:31] up
[2:37:32] the line of the higher calling
[2:37:36] leaving those which things which are
[2:37:38] behind
[2:37:39] and rise up in the arms of faith
[2:37:44] let's find our line
[2:37:46] and let's walk in it i want to be a part
[2:37:49] of this line don't you
[2:37:52] amen
[2:37:54] let's power heads in prayer
[2:38:01] lord we just
[2:38:03] read a few pages
[2:38:07] lord we see you standing in your word
[2:38:09] today
[2:38:11] calling us to a place where
[2:38:14] we don't reason
[2:38:17] we just believe
[2:38:19] we know that
[2:38:21] our line
[2:38:23] has a true prophet
[2:38:26] we have the brass servant
[2:38:28] serpent we have the pillar of fire
[2:38:32] we have the signs and wonders and we
[2:38:34] have the truth
[2:38:35] that sets us free
[2:38:38] and father we know there's another line
[2:38:42] that's trying to
[2:38:44] intermarry
[2:38:47] because that's what happened on the
[2:38:48] journey
[2:38:50] in a perfect type
[2:38:52] they begin to blend their worship
[2:38:55] they begin to blend their musics
[2:38:58] they begin to blend their sermon
[2:39:02] styles
[2:39:05] and it all just began to blend father
[2:39:08] and it began to become a group and it
[2:39:10] began to come a movement and so many of
[2:39:12] the jews left their line
[2:39:15] and married into that
[2:39:18] and father i just stand here this
[2:39:20] morning
[2:39:22] not talking to the world i'm not talking
[2:39:24] to any other church i'm talking to our
[2:39:26] body of believers
[2:39:31] that we each become steadfast
[2:39:34] and we know our higher calling
[2:39:38] and we know that it's the faith
[2:39:41] in your word
[2:39:42] that we're resting on
[2:39:44] so we just ask you to
[2:39:47] help us this morning
