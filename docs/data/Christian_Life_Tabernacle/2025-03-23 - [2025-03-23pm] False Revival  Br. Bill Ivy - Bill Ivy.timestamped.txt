[18:04] be able to approach your throne of mercy
[18:08] and
[18:09] grace. Lord, it's in this hour, Lord,
[18:11] that we know that we can find help in
[18:14] the time of need. Amen. Father, if it
[18:17] wasn't for your grace to lead us to the
[18:20] fountain, Lord, we would still be, Lord,
[18:23] with an
[18:24] unsatisfied thirst, Father. But Lord,
[18:28] you've, oh God, you've won our heart,
[18:31] Lord. You've won our affections, Lord.
[18:33] And here we are, Lord, looking to you,
[18:35] Lord. The one who's called us and the
[18:38] one who's led us to this place tonight.
[18:41] Father, what a privilege it is, Lord, to
[18:43] have audience with you, Lord, because of
[18:45] a great cost. You paid the price. And
[18:49] Father, we're grateful, Lord, that there
[18:50] was a worthy one that came and shed his
[18:53] blood and gave us, Lord, gave everything
[18:57] for us, Lord. What a love, Lord. What a
[19:00] what a rejoicing in our heart, Lord, to
[19:03] be free by the power of the blood. And
[19:06] Lord, as we come to you, Lord, we Lord,
[19:09] we ask, God, that you would feel
[19:11] welcome, Lord. And as we lift up our
[19:13] voices and our heart, our adoration, our
[19:16] appreciation of your goodness to us,
[19:18] Lord, we pray that you'd come and
[19:20] minister. Lord, we're looking for more
[19:22] of that word to make the change in our
[19:25] lives. Lord, we ask God as this little
[19:28] local assembly, those who couldn't make
[19:30] it, that may be streaming online, that
[19:32] our faith, oh God, can touch your
[19:34] garment, Lord. Lord, by faith, Lord, may
[19:36] we receive what we have need of, Lord.
[19:38] May it help us, Lord. May it grant to us
[19:41] strength, oh God. Pray, God, that every
[19:44] need here
[19:45] that would be met by the preaching of
[19:48] your word. And when we leave here, Lord,
[19:50] may we say that we know that we know
[19:51] that it was a personal visit, Lord. That
[19:54] Lord spoke to me and I I'll be different
[19:57] from this day forward. Oh God, let it
[20:00] be. Oh God, that's the kind of faith we
[20:02] want to see in action tonight. Father,
[20:04] use your man's servant, Lord. Bless him
[20:06] in body. Bless him in spirit and mind,
[20:08] oh God. Use him, oh God. may just be
[20:11] able to lay himself to the side. Oh God,
[20:14] that can be lifted to ear to your people
[20:17] tonight. Father, we commit them to you,
[20:19] Lord. Even our sister Mary, Lord, we
[20:22] pray you'd bless her, Lord, and the the
[20:25] need, oh God, that she has for her
[20:27] sister. Lord, we just ask, oh God, you'd
[20:29] undertake, Lord, in a special way, Lord,
[20:32] that you'd be glorified in that. It
[20:34] would be another testimony of your
[20:35] grace, Lord. Shine your face upon us
[20:38] tonight, Lord. May your sweet presence
[20:41] just oh God envelop this service as we
[20:44] adore you and worship you. We thank you

[54:01] alive.
[54:05] [Music]
[54:08] Oh,
[54:15] Jesus. Jesus.
[54:20] Amen. Our heavenly father,
[54:24] where would we be if you weren't
[54:28] alive? Oh, we'd have a life of
[54:30] wonderings
[54:32] and a life of hopes
[54:36] and doubts and fears.
[54:41] But because you're
[54:43] alive, we know that nothing can pluck us
[54:46] from your
[54:47] hand. And we rest in the fact that
[54:50] you're alive.
[54:52] That you know all things. You know the
[54:55] beginning from the end. You know our
[55:00] tomorrows. Father, you hold us in the
[55:02] palm of your hand. And nothing can pluck
[55:05] us
[55:07] out. as the singer saying, "I believe
[55:10] who you are and I believe you'll do what
[55:14] you'll say you'll
[55:15] do." And Father, we live by that. We
[55:20] live by the exceedingly great and
[55:23] precious promises of your word. For by
[55:26] these we are partakers of divine nature.
[55:30] Father, we're here tonight to hear more
[55:33] of that promised word. For this is the
[55:36] bread that man lives by. That's right.
[55:39] The bread which cometh down from heaven.
[55:42] And with this bread we'll never hunger,
[55:45] will never thirst, and we'll be filled.
[55:49] And Father, we long for the day that you
[55:51] have prepared for us as we wait for with
[55:55] patience for your great appearing,
[55:58] knowing, Father, it's at any time. As
[56:01] we've gathered together here tonight to
[56:03] prepare for
[56:05] that great hour of our great catching
[56:10] away, we ask you to bless our hearts now
[56:13] in Jesus precious and wonderful and holy
[56:17] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Isn't that the
[56:22] message that we heard that he's alive?
[56:25] That's right. Amen. God just sent one
[56:28] amongst us that proved that not only was
[56:31] he alive, but he was the same yesterday,
[56:35] today, and forever. He did away with
[56:37] man's imaginations of them. He did away
[56:40] with man's opinions of him, and he
[56:43] revealed them just the way that he truly
[56:46] is. And that was life. And we heard that
[56:50] great word uh today. So, we're just at
[56:54] this time, we're just so grateful.
[56:55] Brother Bill, if you'd come and and uh
[56:59] and I I didn't acknowledge Sister Mary.
[57:01] I'd have her stand up, but but then
[57:04] she'd look at me and say, "Brother
[57:06] David, you know, so she's here. Sister
[57:09] Mary, we appreciate you." And I believe
[57:12] she's heard Bill preach more than any
[57:14] other person on earth. And and uh he
[57:18] done good this morning. Sister Mary, you
[57:20] certainly be proud of him. and and uh
[57:23] but we love brother Bill and and uh we
[57:26] just want to continue to pray for his uh
[57:30] strength and and the meetings he's
[57:32] having and all the work that he wants to
[57:35] do for the Lord. We just trust that he'd
[57:38] prosper and be in good health. So if
[57:40] you'd keep him in your prayers, we'd
[57:43] certainly appreciate it. Yes, I would.
[57:45] Brother Bill, it's an honor to have you.
[57:47] Bless you. What we always say, without
[57:49] fear, without favor. Praise the Lord.
[57:51] He's got the preeminence. Thank you. I
[57:54] tell my wife sometimes
[57:56] that if you if I go and preach somewhere
[58:00] and she's with me and if most most of
[58:05] the people here we don't know and she
[58:08] don't know. I said, "Well, now the
[58:11] preachers's wife in a case like that
[58:14] always preaches first before I do." I
[58:19] mean, it it's true. I mean, not by
[58:23] saying anything behind the pull pit, but
[58:26] everybody wants to know what the
[58:27] preacher's wife looks like, how she
[58:29] fixes her hair, how she dresses, and
[58:31] what kind of shoes she's got on, and so
[58:34] forth and so on like that. So, she's
[58:36] preached her sermon already. And now
[58:39] it's my turn to preach mine. Uh if we
[58:43] could turn in our Bibles while you're
[58:44] standing to 1st Samuel the uh 15th
[58:48] chapter and the 22nd verse. I want to
[58:52] take a little subject tonight and try
[58:55] not to hold you too long if I can help
[58:57] it. 1st Samuel 15:22, an Old Testament
[59:02] story in regards to a king, King Saul,
[59:06] and also a prophet by the name of
[59:09] Samuel. 1st Samuel the 15th chapter the
[59:13] 26 22nd verse and Samuel said he was
[59:19] speaking to Saul hath the Lord as great
[59:22] delight in burnt offerings and
[59:26] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[59:29] the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than
[59:34] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[59:36] rams. For rebellion is as the sin of
[59:40] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[59:43] iniquity and
[59:44] idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the
[59:47] word of the Lord, he hath also rejected
[59:50] thee from being king. If I could just
[59:53] say from just a modern day terms exactly
[59:57] what was being said here that obedience
[1:00:00] is the true test of a believer and the
[1:00:05] lack of it is to be rejected of God.
[1:00:10] Could we bow our heads for a word of
[1:00:12] prayer? Heavenly Father, we pray again
[1:00:15] and one thing that we have been taught
[1:00:17] is we cannot pray too much. And I just
[1:00:21] ask Lord that you would guide my mind
[1:00:23] and and help me Lord to be able to say
[1:00:28] something that will be a help and a
[1:00:30] blessing to these people and anoint your
[1:00:34] word to them and help me to step out of
[1:00:37] the way that you could speak something
[1:00:40] that would be meaningful that would be
[1:00:42] sane and sensible and that would be a
[1:00:45] help to these here today in Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. You
[1:00:50] may be seated. Um, at our church, I
[1:00:54] usually preach on Sunday morning and
[1:00:55] Wednesday night, and I have some other
[1:00:57] preachers that preach on Sunday night
[1:00:59] for me. It gives me a little break in
[1:01:01] the evening service. So, this is the
[1:01:02] first time I preach two services in a
[1:01:04] row on Sunday uh in a long time. uh I
[1:01:08] could do it and I would enjoy doing it
[1:01:10] every every time, but as we get older,
[1:01:13] we have to kind of preserve our strength
[1:01:15] uh and also give others an opportunity
[1:01:17] to exercise the gift that God has placed
[1:01:20] in their lives. And I thank God for
[1:01:23] those those men. Uh we have a couple of
[1:01:26] them there in our church that have been
[1:01:28] a great help and an inspiration to me. I
[1:01:30] love to hear them preach and some of the
[1:01:33] things that they say has always been a
[1:01:35] blessing to me.
[1:01:37] Um, and so I appreciate them. I
[1:01:39] appreciate our church just like brother
[1:01:41] David. I know that he appreciates his
[1:01:43] church. I often tell my
[1:01:45] congregation that you're the best
[1:01:47] congregation in in the whole world. And
[1:01:51] I say that
[1:01:53] sincerely. I I don't look at at as a
[1:01:57] problem, but I look at it as a great
[1:01:59] opportunity to serve the Lord and to
[1:02:02] speak to the purchase of his blood. And
[1:02:04] I believe that's what I'm doing tonight
[1:02:07] as I stand here before you. And so I
[1:02:09] just pray that the Lord will help me to
[1:02:11] say something that will be very uh
[1:02:14] positive that will help you. I'm going
[1:02:16] to use a negative title though. And but
[1:02:19] I'm going to try to bring it around in a
[1:02:20] positive way. The only reason I chose a
[1:02:23] negative title is to get your attention.
[1:02:26] And I I will refer I will refer to that
[1:02:29] title as I go through as I did this
[1:02:31] morning. Uh, and you know, and that's
[1:02:34] not unusual. Brother Brandham preached a
[1:02:36] sermon doing God's service without it
[1:02:39] being his will. That was a very negative
[1:02:42] title. Uh, Jezebel religion. Very, very
[1:02:45] negative title. But it it was drawing
[1:02:47] our attention to something. You see,
[1:02:51] I've often said that uh brother
[1:02:53] Brandham's titles, his titles to his
[1:02:56] sermons were declarations in their self
[1:02:59] and just spoke volumes. Uh Christ is the
[1:03:03] mystery of God revealed and things like
[1:03:05] that, you know, and uh so I I have you
[1:03:09] in suspense, don't
[1:03:11] I? The uh I want to title this a false
[1:03:14] revival. There's a number of other
[1:03:16] titles that I have to this because I
[1:03:18] spoke this also at our church one Sunday
[1:03:21] morning and uh and usually when a a
[1:03:25] minister preaches whether it's at home
[1:03:28] or somewhere else
[1:03:30] uh lots of times it it's coming from his
[1:03:33] own personal
[1:03:34] experiences. Uh, I've often told younger
[1:03:37] preachers as they'd come along, do like
[1:03:40] David when he went before Saul to in
[1:03:43] order to fight against
[1:03:45] Goliath. He he hadn't proved the uh the
[1:03:49] armor, the sword, and the different
[1:03:52] things that Saul as a warrior wanted to
[1:03:55] put on him. But there was something that
[1:03:57] he did
[1:03:58] prove. He didn't need that. All he
[1:04:01] needed is what he had proved, and that
[1:04:03] was that slingshot. He'd used it on a
[1:04:05] bear and on a lion. And so I often tell
[1:04:07] them, I said, "Don't try to be like me
[1:04:09] or be like anybody else. You use what
[1:04:12] you've proved, what you've experienced
[1:04:14] yourself." And so as I go through some
[1:04:17] of these things, it'll be because it's
[1:04:20] uh from personal experiences and
[1:04:22] personal things that I've had to deal
[1:04:24] with over the last few years. A false
[1:04:29] revival. False revival. They chose this
[1:04:32] text. We see King Saul, great man. He uh
[1:04:36] went to heaven in spite of his false
[1:04:41] revival and he u of course he caused a
[1:04:45] lot of damage in the process. He did God
[1:04:49] a service. Um but God did not accept
[1:04:53] that service. Knowing knowing that it
[1:04:57] was not what he was told to do, he
[1:05:01] deliberately refused the word of the
[1:05:04] prophet Samuel for what he thought would
[1:05:08] be a better idea, would be better
[1:05:11] spiritually for him and for the people
[1:05:15] of his
[1:05:17] country. And that was not the first time
[1:05:20] that he had done that. It had happened
[1:05:23] before. God gave the nation of Israel a
[1:05:26] king of their choice. You know, God will
[1:05:28] give us what we want. But sometimes what
[1:05:31] we don't want is what we
[1:05:32] need. You know, lots of times we come to
[1:05:35] church wanting to feel good, but maybe
[1:05:37] God wants you to feel bad. Huh? So, you
[1:05:39] can examine your own self and say,
[1:05:41] "Lord, help me." You know, and but
[1:05:46] anyway, um God give them what they
[1:05:50] wanted. what they they they wanted a
[1:05:52] king of their choice. And when he gave
[1:05:56] them that king, he told them, "This day,
[1:06:00] you've rejected God."
[1:06:07] What kind of man was
[1:06:09] Saul? Well, he was kingly looking. He He
[1:06:13] looked like he, you know, he could
[1:06:14] handle the job. He looked like a king.
[1:06:17] He was probably 6'2 and eyes of blue and
[1:06:22] he he just just looked apart and u he
[1:06:26] was humble to begin with even though he
[1:06:29] was a great man. He was he was humble to
[1:06:32] begin with but he didn't remain that
[1:06:34] way. Uh it's not what we start out to be
[1:06:37] but those that endure to the end shall
[1:06:39] be saved. Now, we here that are gathered
[1:06:43] here, not just the preacher behind the
[1:06:45] pull pit, not just the brothers, but the
[1:06:47] sisters as well, not just the older
[1:06:49] people, but the younger ones, we are a
[1:06:52] um people, we are a kingly people, just
[1:06:55] like uh Saul was a kingly person. Uh
[1:06:58] we're a very royal uh priesthood of
[1:07:01] people. Uh I don't stand alone in that.
[1:07:04] maybe alone in the sense that I'm called
[1:07:06] to preach from the pullpit, but we we
[1:07:09] know that God has thousands of lived
[1:07:11] voices. And it said in first Peter the 2
[1:07:14] chapter in the fifth verse, "Ye also as
[1:07:19] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[1:07:23] house, a holy
[1:07:26] priesthood to offer to do something."
[1:07:29] See, not not just the person behind the
[1:07:31] pullpit or the person in the p at the
[1:07:33] piano singing or whatever to offer up
[1:07:37] spiritual
[1:07:39] sacrifices. We got to read the whole
[1:07:41] thing
[1:07:43] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. So he
[1:07:47] wants he wants our worship. He he he
[1:07:50] wants our spiritual sacrifices. And
[1:07:53] you're here tonight. You could have been
[1:07:55] doing something else. I don't know what.
[1:07:57] But, you know, sometimes at our church,
[1:07:59] I wonder what are they what are they
[1:08:02] doing on Sunday night or Wednesday night
[1:08:04] and they're not here at church. I'd feel
[1:08:06] guilty. But anyway, you're here and and
[1:08:10] you're being blessed. Maybe they're
[1:08:12] watching.
[1:08:14] Okay. It's not the same. But anyway,
[1:08:17] it's second best, I guess. Uh but um
[1:08:21] anyway, maybe there's people watching
[1:08:23] that's not even a part of this church.
[1:08:24] we uh live stream our services and u and
[1:08:28] sometimes it's good sometimes it's bad
[1:08:30] sometimes I think you know I get in
[1:08:32] trouble uh but not so much with our own
[1:08:35] people but anyway spiritual sacrifice is
[1:08:38] that he accepts is he accepting our
[1:08:41] sacrifice is he accepting your sacrifice
[1:08:44] huh it's not the sacrifice the spiritual
[1:08:46] sacrifice because the Catholic church
[1:08:48] will sacrifice will do things you know
[1:08:51] to help people and what have you does he
[1:08:53] accept
[1:08:55] Two years after Saul became
[1:08:59] king, we see his
[1:09:03] selfwill was promoted above God's
[1:09:07] word. The Philistines, the enemy was
[1:09:11] gathered against them for battle and the
[1:09:13] people were afraid. As happens many
[1:09:17] times even in the church, certain things
[1:09:19] happen and take place and people begin
[1:09:21] to be afraid. Is what being done right?
[1:09:23] Is this being are we going in the right
[1:09:26] direction? Is oh, what about this? What
[1:09:28] about that? And and so the people were
[1:09:31] afraid. And Samuel the prophet had told
[1:09:35] King Saul to wait seven days for him to
[1:09:38] come and offer a burnt offering before
[1:09:41] they would go to battle. And when it the
[1:09:45] Philistines begin to be more and more
[1:09:48] and more and bigger and bigger,
[1:09:51] uh it seemed as if
[1:09:53] Samuel was not going to
[1:09:56] come and the people begin to scatter
[1:09:59] away from King Saul because they begin
[1:10:02] to be more afraid. And so
[1:10:06] Saul being a king and not a priest, he
[1:10:10] took it upon himself to enter into the
[1:10:13] priest's office and to offer a sacrifice
[1:10:18] himself, not being of the priestly
[1:10:21] tribe. As soon as he got through, Samuel
[1:10:24] walks
[1:10:25] up. You know, it's kind of like the fog
[1:10:28] of war. They say people that uh fight in
[1:10:31] wars and military people that many times
[1:10:35] they don't understand what the enemy is
[1:10:38] thinking more so now the military does
[1:10:41] because of uh the internet and and
[1:10:43] satellites and and all the different
[1:10:46] things that they have to use. But in
[1:10:48] times past, many times an army would
[1:10:52] would surrender, not realizing their
[1:10:55] enemy across the way that they were
[1:10:57] fighting against was just getting ready
[1:10:59] to pull
[1:11:00] away. But the fog of war kept them from
[1:11:03] understanding what was taking place. And
[1:11:06] sometimes in our Christian experience,
[1:11:08] our Christian war, our Christian battle,
[1:11:11] we're dependent on God to come and it
[1:11:13] don't seem like he's going to be there.
[1:11:15] The fog of life itself keeps us from
[1:11:19] seeing that God is on his way. He hadn't
[1:11:22] forgot us and he's never late and never
[1:11:25] will be.
[1:11:27] But Saul took it upon himself to do what
[1:11:29] he was told not to
[1:11:31] do. And so Samuel shows
[1:11:34] up and asked Saul, "What have you done?"
[1:11:38] He said, 'Well, I I I forced myself
[1:11:41] because the people they were afraid and
[1:11:45] so I I forced myself to do this be
[1:11:49] thinking you were not going to come so
[1:11:52] as to have the Lord's blessings before
[1:11:55] the battle. His his
[1:11:58] uh his idea was pretty good. He wanted
[1:12:01] the Lord's blessings.
[1:12:03] He was doing that for a good
[1:12:06] reason to have the Lord's
[1:12:09] blessings, but it wasn't according to
[1:12:12] the word of the prophet. Samuel said,
[1:12:14] "You've done
[1:12:16] foolishly. You've not kept the word of
[1:12:18] the
[1:12:19] Lord, for he wanted a man after his own
[1:12:24] heart."
[1:12:27] They defeated the enemy in that battle
[1:12:29] anyway, regardless of Saul's uh uh uh
[1:12:34] blunder, and it was a great battle. But
[1:12:37] I would say this to us here tonight, it
[1:12:39] was a false revival, though it was
[1:12:42] anointed by
[1:12:44] God. It was a false revival because it
[1:12:48] was contrary to the word of the prophet.
[1:12:53] Saul was already rejected by
[1:12:57] God. Now we know that David later became
[1:13:01] that man after God's own
[1:13:04] heart. And but we find 16 years later
[1:13:08] after this incident with Samuel uh we
[1:13:11] see again King Saul in complete
[1:13:15] uh
[1:13:17] disobedience to God. the scriptures 1st
[1:13:20] Samuel 15 and one if you'd like to turn
[1:13:24] or maybe it is being shown where you can
[1:13:27] see it. Samuel also said unto
[1:13:29] Saul, he had been sent again by Samuel
[1:13:32] to defeat the Amlch. Amcch was a type of
[1:13:34] the flesh that give Israel a lot of
[1:13:37] problems. And so the prophet Samuel
[1:13:39] says, "I want you to go and I want you
[1:13:41] to defeat them totally. Kill every man,
[1:13:44] woman, boy, girl, baby. Kill them all."
[1:13:48] And um don't spare anything, not at all.
[1:13:51] Just wip destroy the land completely,
[1:13:54] even the
[1:13:55] animals. And so the battle took place.
[1:13:59] You know the story. Samuel spared the
[1:14:02] king and the best of the flocks. And
[1:14:04] Samuel also said unto Saul, "The Lord
[1:14:07] sent me to anoint thee to be king over
[1:14:09] Israel, over his people over Israel. Now
[1:14:13] therefore hearken thou unto the voice of
[1:14:16] the words of the
[1:14:18] Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts. I
[1:14:22] remember that which Amch did to Israel,
[1:14:24] how he laid in weight for him in the way
[1:14:28] when he came up from Egypt. Now go and
[1:14:32] smite Amlch. Utterly destroy all that
[1:14:34] they have. Spare them not. slay both
[1:14:38] man, woman, infant, suckling, ox, sheep,
[1:14:41] camel, a ass.
[1:14:43] Now, that's pretty direct, pretty simple
[1:14:47] uh instructions for the king to follow.
[1:14:50] It was thus sayeth the Lord, something
[1:14:52] that he needed to do, had to do. And so,
[1:14:56] he returns from victory. He fought the
[1:14:59] battle and won. But it was a false
[1:15:02] victory or we could say a false revival.
[1:15:06] They were probably rejoicing in what had
[1:15:09] been done. But he spared Agag the king
[1:15:12] and the best of the sheep and the oxen
[1:15:14] and the lambs and all that was good.
[1:15:17] Everything that was vile and refused
[1:15:19] they destroyed. And in the process of
[1:15:23] doing that now coming back from the
[1:15:25] battle he thought he had done the will
[1:15:27] of God by saving the
[1:15:30] best be for the people. He did it for
[1:15:33] the people to to offer a sacrifice unto
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:42] Lord. 1st Samuel 15 and
[1:15:45] 20. And Saul said unto Samuel,
[1:15:48] "Yay, I have obeyed the voice of the
[1:15:53] Lord." What
[1:15:55] arrogance,
[1:15:57] huh? What arrogance. I have obeyed the
[1:16:01] word of the
[1:16:03] Lord, and I have gone the way which the
[1:16:05] Lord sent me, and have brought Agag, the
[1:16:07] king of Amalch, and have utterly
[1:16:09] destroyed the Amalocites. But the people
[1:16:13] took of the spoil, the sheep, the oxen,
[1:16:16] the chief of the things which should
[1:16:18] have been utterly destroyed to
[1:16:20] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:16:23] Gilgal. I
[1:16:25] imagine that King Saul had a smile on
[1:16:28] his face when he was telling Samuel
[1:16:30] that. Probably thinking he was going to
[1:16:32] get a big pat on the back and
[1:16:34] congratulate him for the great work that
[1:16:36] he had done for the Lord and what he was
[1:16:39] going to do in offering this sacrifice
[1:16:42] to
[1:16:44] God. And Samuel the
[1:16:47] prophet, he didn't do that. He said,
[1:16:50] "Hath the
[1:16:51] Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
[1:16:55] and
[1:16:57] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:17:01] the Lord. Behold, to obey is better than
[1:17:05] sacrifice,
[1:17:08] and to hearken than the fat of rams.
[1:17:11] For rebellion is as a sin of
[1:17:14] witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
[1:17:18] iniquity and
[1:17:19] idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the
[1:17:23] word of the Lord, he hath also rejected
[1:17:27] thee from being king.
[1:17:35] I would say
[1:17:39] this. And we have to bring these Old
[1:17:42] Testament stories that are true up to
[1:17:46] today to us that are
[1:17:49] here, those that are in the sound of my
[1:17:51] voice, wherever they're at.
[1:17:54] Whenever the outward observance is
[1:17:58] considered of greater importance than
[1:18:00] the inward love for a spiritual life,
[1:18:04] there is a perversion in your Christian
[1:18:07] faith which is displeasing to God.
[1:18:10] Remember in the church age book, brother
[1:18:12] Brennham said that the church had grown
[1:18:14] to a place where they when they stopped
[1:18:17] being persecuted by Rome and Constantine
[1:18:20] rose up and began to support the church
[1:18:23] with finances and so forth that they
[1:18:26] begin to think more of what the world
[1:18:28] thought of them than what God thought of
[1:18:30] them.
[1:18:34] if I could quote brother Brand.
[1:18:36] Um, and I will in a in a moment. But
[1:18:40] before I I I do that, I
[1:18:43] just, you know, I want to say something.
[1:18:47] And you know this just as well as I know
[1:18:51] it that the day that we're living in
[1:18:53] church there are many churches that are
[1:18:55] trying to reproduce brother Brandham
[1:18:56] again in their services and in their own
[1:19:00] ministries publicly trying to
[1:19:02] demonstrate a gift that was given to
[1:19:05] brother Brandham alone for a particular
[1:19:08] purpose a gift that was impersonated in
[1:19:12] brother Brandham's day caused carnal
[1:19:15] imperson impersonations and
[1:19:18] confusion of which was not approved of
[1:19:22] God but was done anyway. It was a
[1:19:25] worship. It was a
[1:19:26] sacrifice and we see a return by many to
[1:19:30] previous pent to a previous Pentecostal
[1:19:35] age
[1:19:37] past. An age that had truth, a
[1:19:40] restoration of the gifts, right?
[1:19:43] An age of the church which our prophet
[1:19:46] when he was here tried to
[1:19:49] correct that that age felt they they
[1:19:56] exalted they felt exalted rather in the
[1:19:59] gifts that they had the music the
[1:20:08] emotionalism
[1:20:11] and disregard started spiritual
[1:20:16] things that became more important to
[1:20:20] them as with the TV evangelists and so
[1:20:23] forth of that
[1:20:24] day they became merely entertainers. Now
[1:20:27] I'm speaking of days that I know about
[1:20:30] personally because I was a part of those
[1:20:33] days. I was in raised in the Pentecostal
[1:20:36] church. My daddy was a Pentecostal
[1:20:40] pastor. And so what does that produce?
[1:20:44] It produces a false revival. Another
[1:20:47] Janis and
[1:20:48] Jambers, no matter how great it might
[1:20:51] seem, and it will produce the same thing
[1:20:54] today if it's repeated.
[1:20:58] And so Samuel the prophet
[1:21:03] came to Saul no more.
[1:21:12] came to him no
[1:21:14] more. Do you know why he is still king?
[1:21:18] Still
[1:21:19] came. But the prophet came to him no
[1:21:23] more. You see, Saul was a great man, but
[1:21:27] he like lacked the character to lead
[1:21:30] God's people. Though he was a great man
[1:21:32] and he was a great
[1:21:34] man, there is character that leaders
[1:21:38] must have or they become
[1:21:41] unprofitable. Gifts and callings are
[1:21:43] without repentance. In other words, a
[1:21:46] person I could backslide tonight. That
[1:21:49] gift would still be there. That calling
[1:21:50] would still be there. I just would be
[1:21:54] unprofitable in the ministry that I
[1:21:55] would have. And so he
[1:22:00] um he would
[1:22:03] regardless a a a a
[1:22:06] leader must have that character. Uh but
[1:22:10] if it becomes stained uh by unbelief or
[1:22:13] disobeying God's word, then it can no
[1:22:16] longer be effective as it once was
[1:22:19] without the word.
[1:22:22] This is where many feel that they are
[1:22:24] okay with the lack of character because
[1:22:29] they may have a gift but they don't have
[1:22:31] the character to operate that
[1:22:35] gift but the gift is
[1:22:38] there and because the gift is there they
[1:22:41] feel as if they are
[1:22:45] okay. I grew up or I raised our family
[1:22:48] down in the Baton Rouge area in South
[1:22:50] Louisiana. Jimmy Swagger was big uh many
[1:22:54] years ago there. He still is. I guess
[1:22:55] he's 90 years old. But I used to even in
[1:22:58] the me as being a part of the message
[1:23:01] used to enjoy and love his singing and
[1:23:03] his preaching. He was a real
[1:23:06] preacher. But there came some things in
[1:23:09] his life that were totally wrong. And I
[1:23:12] think his own statement was that his
[1:23:14] downfall was the fact that he was still
[1:23:17] anointed after doing some of the immoral
[1:23:20] things that he done. And I would listen
[1:23:24] to him on the radio and I would be
[1:23:26] amazed at his preaching and his singing
[1:23:28] and it just really I really enjoyed it.
[1:23:32] But you know the same man later I could
[1:23:34] listen to him
[1:23:35] and it was different. It was hard to
[1:23:38] listen to him. It was hard to listen to
[1:23:42] what he was saying. It was hard to
[1:23:45] receive to receive it knowing what had
[1:23:48] took place and what it was what it was
[1:23:51] there in in in the lack in that
[1:23:53] situation. I will say that about him
[1:23:55] publicly because it's public information
[1:23:58] and he's a public character.
[1:24:01] What kind of a lack of character will
[1:24:05] make a
[1:24:06] person that we would know and love and
[1:24:08] trust unprofitable
[1:24:12] today? Well, you say, "Brother, Ivy
[1:24:14] moral issues would do
[1:24:17] that." And I want you to bear with me if
[1:24:20] you're watching. You know, uh, hear me
[1:24:23] out to the end of this
[1:24:25] sermon so you don't get the wrong
[1:24:28] impression.
[1:24:29] David had moral
[1:24:33] issues. I'm not trying to promote sin
[1:24:36] because even the Lord said that what he
[1:24:38] done would cause others to do the same
[1:24:42] thing. But he had moral issues, but he
[1:24:46] still remained a God, a man after God's
[1:24:50] own heart.
[1:24:52] He had failures and
[1:24:54] misjudgments that even harmed the
[1:24:57] people.
[1:24:59] Is that right?
[1:25:02] But he was still a man after God's own
[1:25:04] heart. Now, I'm not promoting doing
[1:25:07] wrong, you know, but I'm just trying to
[1:25:09] get to a point here in
[1:25:12] this.
[1:25:14] And but for
[1:25:17] Saul, it was different. And what he done
[1:25:20] did not seem to be as serious as what
[1:25:22] David
[1:25:24] done. But
[1:25:26] Saul
[1:25:28] deliberately disobeyed the word of God
[1:25:31] when he knew what it
[1:25:34] was. And by it, God left him. The
[1:25:38] prophet left him and never
[1:25:41] returned. You see, it's the same today,
[1:25:44] only
[1:25:45] magnified in the New
[1:25:47] Testament. Saul went right on with his
[1:25:50] ministry. He had great revivals. He
[1:25:53] became greater and greater. You ruled
[1:25:55] Israel for another 24 years, a total of
[1:25:58] 40 years before he came to his end. A
[1:26:01] terrible end. And yet he went to
[1:26:09] heaven. Saul was a leader of false
[1:26:11] revivals and many followed
[1:26:14] him knowing that he was wrong in what he
[1:26:18] was doing. Some didn't care. Others
[1:26:21] joined in with the persecution of David
[1:26:23] just to stay in good standing with Saul
[1:26:26] because after all he was the king and
[1:26:27] they wanted to stay in good standing
[1:26:29] with him in position with
[1:26:31] him. So as we look at that as we look at
[1:26:34] Saul then we I ask you what is a false
[1:26:36] revival?
[1:26:38] A false revival has all the attributes
[1:26:42] of one that is real.
[1:26:48] But it lacks humility.
[1:26:50] Brother Brandon in the sermon
[1:26:52] Christianity versus idolatry, he spoke
[1:26:55] of St. Martin in the great move of God
[1:26:58] that took place under his ministry as a
[1:27:00] messenger to the age. And he said the
[1:27:04] very secret of his power was in his
[1:27:06] humility before God. And we find today
[1:27:09] that the church yet teaching its power
[1:27:11] and teaching the signs to follow the
[1:27:13] believer. Yet we find them puffed
[1:27:16] out. Big me little you. And that it
[1:27:20] isn't like the early church. You see,
[1:27:23] they were humble. They were kind to one
[1:27:27] another and sweet,
[1:27:29] understanding. And it's so much
[1:27:32] different today.
[1:27:35] I wonder if a lot of this hasn't
[1:27:39] sidetracked
[1:27:41] us from the real kernel of the
[1:27:45] message that we want to humble
[1:27:51] ourselves. The one of the last sermons
[1:27:54] brother Brandon preached, not the last
[1:27:56] one, but one of them was God's only
[1:27:58] provided place of worship in Shreport.
[1:28:01] and he was speaking to that church that
[1:28:03] claimed to be
[1:28:05] undenominational. Uh he was speaking to
[1:28:07] them about denominations and to stay
[1:28:10] away from denominations and not to
[1:28:12] become a
[1:28:13] denomination. And as I said this morning
[1:28:16] that uh life tabernacle in Shreport
[1:28:20] became his second home as it would be
[1:28:25] and he went there many times and
[1:28:27] preached great meetings. But he said
[1:28:29] there one as as I said one of his last
[1:28:32] sermons to that church, if I go in this
[1:28:36] generation, may the people who believe
[1:28:39] this message never stand still for a
[1:28:43] denomination. Now they were going into
[1:28:45] one and even the ministry there perhaps
[1:28:48] didn't realize what was taking place.
[1:28:51] And I want to ask you, what is a
[1:28:53] denomination?
[1:28:55] Now, Brother Brandham answers that
[1:28:57] question when I finish reading
[1:28:59] this. You'll die right in your tracks.
[1:29:02] Remember that. The very hour that you
[1:29:04] mention denominations among you, I don't
[1:29:06] care how sincere you are, take
[1:29:09] man for your leader instead of the Holy
[1:29:12] Ghost to confirm his word. That's the
[1:29:14] hour that you die. There's your
[1:29:17] denomination.
[1:29:20] Taking some man for your
[1:29:22] leader instead of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:29:24] yet God has men
[1:29:26] that are filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:29:29] lead you by the word. And yet he goes on
[1:29:32] to say the genuine seed cannot
[1:29:36] cannot what denominate. So there is a
[1:29:39] seed that will not denominate. It cannot
[1:29:44] denominate because there's nothing to
[1:29:46] follow the seed but the same thing.
[1:29:53] This age is marked by
[1:29:55] deception. And that deception in the day
[1:29:58] that we're living in, you that are
[1:29:59] sitting there looking at me and
[1:30:01] listening to what I'm
[1:30:04] saying. One of the great deceptions of
[1:30:06] the day that we live in is
[1:30:09] denominationalism, which is a spirit.
[1:30:13] We've been taught. It's a spirit.
[1:30:17] remember the sermon bruise serpent where
[1:30:19] brother Brandham he came and was going
[1:30:23] to leave the ministry the field he was
[1:30:25] going to continue to preach at home and
[1:30:28] and he said they're making me an
[1:30:30] antichrist by calling me uh Jesus
[1:30:34] Christ and a week or two later he come
[1:30:37] back in the pull pit and said all the
[1:30:38] brothers have made it
[1:30:40] right and yet we know that they didn't
[1:30:43] they did maybe to brother Brandham's
[1:30:46] But if you listen to that that sermon
[1:30:48] that he preached after Bruce Serpent, he
[1:30:51] comes to a place where he said, you
[1:30:52] know, two years ago, I told them
[1:30:56] brothers that wasn't right. He said, but
[1:30:58] they never listen to me. He said, why?
[1:31:02] Because they took a spirit. And when you
[1:31:05] take a spirit, you can't show it to
[1:31:07] them. They can't believe it. And so
[1:31:10] that's what happens to people. They
[1:31:13] don't realize they're a part of a
[1:31:15] denomination. They don't realize they
[1:31:17] have a false revival. You can't convince
[1:31:20] them
[1:31:21] otherwise. Why?
[1:31:24] They take a spirit. There's nothing you
[1:31:27] can do. They take a spirit, but there's
[1:31:30] a seed that will never
[1:31:33] that will always follow God's word.
[1:31:35] Okay?
[1:31:37] I want to be one of those. I can't make
[1:31:39] myself
[1:31:42] but I can be identified as
[1:31:44] one by following the word.
[1:31:48] You see? And so a
[1:31:50] denomination is a denominational
[1:31:53] spirit in that people lose their
[1:31:57] humility. And then a denominational
[1:32:01] spirit is built upon numbers, upon
[1:32:05] pride, upon personality, upon control.
[1:32:10] and money.
[1:32:13] And then they begin to spare the things
[1:32:15] that God told them to destroy. Why?
[1:32:19] Because of the people. The people.
[1:32:30] They got to keep the people.
[1:32:34] They think more about what the world
[1:32:35] thinks of them than God.
[1:32:39] So they spare the things they were they
[1:32:42] they were told to
[1:32:43] destroy and then talking about that
[1:32:46] denominational spirit. How you can tell
[1:32:49] you young people, I see some of you
[1:32:51] taking notes. I hope that's what you're
[1:32:53] doing. Show me your picture after church
[1:32:55] and I'll tell you how nice it is. But
[1:33:01] anyway, there's something else that a
[1:33:03] denominational spirit will do. You can
[1:33:05] write it down.
[1:33:07] Okay. They will hate and persecute the
[1:33:11] Davids of this world. Those after God's
[1:33:15] own heart, the true seed,
[1:33:18] those that do not follow their their
[1:33:22] false revival.
[1:33:25] Write it down. You that we're taking
[1:33:27] notes, write it down.
[1:33:29] They will persecute the true seed, a
[1:33:32] false revival, a denominational
[1:33:36] spirit. We're living in a serious time.
[1:33:41] We can get on the news. All of us carry
[1:33:43] the news in our pocket or your
[1:33:45] purse. And we see so much confusion in
[1:33:48] the world. We see what's taking place in
[1:33:51] the Middle East with Israel. We're
[1:33:54] thankful that we have a president now
[1:33:56] that is sticking up for Israel. But how
[1:33:58] long will that last? I don't know. And
[1:34:02] so Israel's a time clock for us. And we
[1:34:07] see that she is persecuted by almost
[1:34:10] everyone. Even if she defends herself
[1:34:13] against
[1:34:14] evil and I don't want you to
[1:34:16] misunderstand uh Israel as as a nation,
[1:34:20] they are evil
[1:34:22] people. I mean they're perverts. They're
[1:34:25] every every kind just like in America.
[1:34:27] is there.
[1:34:30] But God cares about
[1:34:31] him. Why? Because of little uh little
[1:34:35] Benjamin.
[1:34:37] There's 144,000 perhaps there right now
[1:34:40] waiting for us to get out of here that
[1:34:42] this message can be revealed to them.
[1:34:46] Huh? And so for their sake, God loves
[1:34:49] them. See, but we see these things
[1:34:52] taking place. We see things we don't
[1:34:54] know what. I mean, it's like
[1:34:57] a a mystery movie or something. Every
[1:35:00] day it's something different. But but
[1:35:02] see, it's the day that we're living.
[1:35:04] We're living in a very serious time.
[1:35:06] It's got to be this way naturally and
[1:35:08] spiritually. It's going home time. As I
[1:35:10] said this morning, it's harvest time.
[1:35:14] It's a different time than it's ever
[1:35:15] been. If it's a serious time, then it
[1:35:19] should call for serious
[1:35:21] measures and very serious
[1:35:24] desires. The early church, I read about
[1:35:27] the early church history and they longed
[1:35:29] for and they look for the coming of the
[1:35:31] Lord every day. It was something that
[1:35:33] was quickened to them. They believed it
[1:35:35] would take place in that time at that
[1:35:39] time. You know, when I first come to
[1:35:41] this message in 1970 or 71, somewhere
[1:35:44] along in that, it seemed like that was
[1:35:46] the attitude of all of us. We looked for
[1:35:48] the coming of the Lord. We just expected
[1:35:50] it. We never thought our kids would grow
[1:35:53] up. We never thought they'd go to
[1:35:55] school.
[1:35:57] We never thought they'd get big and get
[1:35:59] married and have children and
[1:36:01] grandchildren and so forth, but they're
[1:36:02] still here. But what we look for that,
[1:36:04] but Paul looked for it. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:09] Every age look for
[1:36:11] it. He didn't come in 73 and a half. He
[1:36:14] didn't come in 77. But I'm still looking
[1:36:17] for him. Amen.
[1:36:22] Why? Because I see the conditions around
[1:36:24] us. All everything the deception and and
[1:36:28] what we see going on naturally, the
[1:36:30] confusion and all those things. Don't
[1:36:32] don't let
[1:36:33] that don't don't let that blow you away.
[1:36:36] It's supposed to
[1:36:38] be what we're seeing naturally and
[1:36:42] spiritually is supposed to be. But God
[1:36:46] will have a people. Amen.
[1:36:50] Settle it now.
[1:36:57] Not
[1:36:57] later. And so it's a serious
[1:37:01] time because we see a Cain worship
[1:37:05] again.
[1:37:06] thinking God will accept their worship
[1:37:10] knowing what God has said. But because
[1:37:13] pe because of the people and because of
[1:37:18] results, they believe God has accepted
[1:37:21] them and their false revival. And our
[1:37:25] prophet said, and I'm he's a lot more
[1:37:28] sterner than what I am. And whenever I
[1:37:30] preach, he said it was devil worship.
[1:37:34] Not the man in the honky tonk in the
[1:37:36] barroom and the adulterer and the
[1:37:39] whoreonger out there. No, no, not him. A
[1:37:43] devil
[1:37:45] worship. People don't want to accept
[1:37:47] that, but that's exactly what it is. It
[1:37:52] was that way with Cain.
[1:37:54] Uh it was that way with we could take so
[1:37:57] many
[1:37:58] types and you know this is the real sad
[1:38:01] thing is that the
[1:38:06] people the people accept it gladly
[1:38:11] follow
[1:38:12] it and if you
[1:38:14] don't you are considered a heretic.
[1:38:27] As in the church age book, Brother
[1:38:28] Random said, "In every case, the evil
[1:38:32] hated the righteous and persecuted the
[1:38:34] righteous. In some cases, the evil
[1:38:36] destroyed the righteous. But notice,
[1:38:39] they were planted
[1:38:44] together. They lived together.
[1:38:48] They both made claims upon
[1:38:51] God and worshiped
[1:39:01] God. Now, David did God a
[1:39:04] service without it being his will, God's
[1:39:07] will. And when he did that, it produced
[1:39:10] death. But when he consulted the word of
[1:39:13] God, he consulted the prophet. He did
[1:39:15] what God required. And the difference
[1:39:18] here was not death but was life. Because
[1:39:23] when he was corrected by the word, it
[1:39:25] humbled David to repentance. And when he
[1:39:28] repented, it was over like that. Yet he
[1:39:30] had to pay for those things that he
[1:39:32] done. But he was still a man after God's
[1:39:35] own heart.
[1:39:37] That never changed. You might have a
[1:39:40] prodal out
[1:39:41] there, Brother Jerome, but they're
[1:39:44] still, if they're a prodal, they're
[1:39:46] still God's, right? Huh? No matter how
[1:39:49] far they go in sin, they could run, but
[1:39:51] they can't hide. God knows them. If
[1:39:53] they're a prodal, they're still God's
[1:39:55] son. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:59] And we all have
[1:40:02] them. And
[1:40:04] so there was a
[1:40:06] difference. Now, how does this relate to
[1:40:09] us today to this
[1:40:15] message? We must stay away from
[1:40:18] denominational
[1:40:21] spirits. We must. And I tell you
[1:40:25] why. Because it is a
[1:40:28] spirit. Spirits go from one person to
[1:40:31] the next.
[1:40:33] I'm not trying to preach isolationism,
[1:40:36] but you know the old American saying in
[1:40:40] birds of a feather flock
[1:40:42] together. When you get around somebody
[1:40:45] that has a certain disposition, if
[1:40:48] you're not careful, that spirit gets on
[1:40:50] you and you become just like them. We
[1:40:53] raised our family in South Louisiana. My
[1:40:56] wife's family are French and South
[1:40:59] Louisiana French and they have a English
[1:41:02] accent that sometimes is hard to
[1:41:04] understand. Now, it took me 55 years to
[1:41:07] get that out of her and she she doesn't
[1:41:10] talk like them anymore. But, you know, I
[1:41:13] can tell when she talks to her sister on
[1:41:15] the telephone. I come in and she sounds
[1:41:18] just like her. She has that, you know,
[1:41:21] she picks up that spirit real easy. And
[1:41:28] Oh Lord, help
[1:41:32] me. I tell them young preachers in our
[1:41:34] church, don't preach about your wife.
[1:41:37] It's not worth
[1:41:41] it. Now, where was I at anyway?
[1:41:45] But maybe I'll change sermons here real
[1:41:48] quick. But
[1:41:50] uh anyway, um how does this affect us
[1:41:53] today? A denominational spirit is a
[1:41:55] spirit.
[1:41:59] Okay? No matter how great it
[1:42:02] appears. How do I know? How can you
[1:42:05] know? It's a denominational something is
[1:42:07] a denominational
[1:42:09] spirit. If you have the spirit of God
[1:42:11] yourself, that's a spirit,
[1:42:13] right? Uh listen to the sermon. Brother
[1:42:17] Brandon preached uh spiritual
[1:42:18] discernment. He makes it very clear
[1:42:21] there. So if you have the spirit of God,
[1:42:24] you'll know uh you will have spiritual
[1:42:28] discernment. Now I have spiritual
[1:42:31] discernment. That don't make me super
[1:42:32] spiritual. If you have the Holy Spirit,
[1:42:34] you have spiritual discernment. All of
[1:42:37] us have spiritual discernment. Okay? And
[1:42:40] so you have spiritual discern. If you
[1:42:43] have that, you know what someone is
[1:42:45] trying to
[1:42:46] accomplish, what their motive and
[1:42:48] objective is and what they're doing. You
[1:42:50] can tell right off the bat. And I would
[1:42:52] say this, these young people can tell
[1:42:54] quicker than you. It's some of us older
[1:42:57] ones. They know something that's real
[1:43:00] and something that's phony when they see
[1:43:04] it. You young people, look at Brother
[1:43:08] Ivy, man. You are. And I appreciate that
[1:43:11] very
[1:43:12] much. You're not the church of tomorrow,
[1:43:15] but you're the church of today.
[1:43:18] and you let God come into your life to
[1:43:21] give you spiritual
[1:43:22] discernment because this is a late hour
[1:43:25] that we're living
[1:43:26] in. And when God deals with your heart,
[1:43:29] you yield to him. Amen. And respond back
[1:43:33] to that God that is in you to lead you
[1:43:35] and guide
[1:43:37] you and give everything the word test in
[1:43:41] your
[1:43:42] life by knowing the word, by reading the
[1:43:46] word, finding time every day to read the
[1:43:49] word, listen to the prophet's message.
[1:43:53] And so if you have the guide, which is
[1:43:55] the spirit of God, he will lead and
[1:43:58] guide you into all
[1:44:00] truth. And where others, no matter how
[1:44:04] plain it
[1:44:05] is to you, to them, they never see it.
[1:44:11] And they say this, I don't see anything
[1:44:14] wrong with it. Why don't you just put
[1:44:16] your shoulder to our will and let's move
[1:44:20] this revival down the road. even if it's
[1:44:23] false. And when you don't go along with
[1:44:26] it, you're considered a troublemaker and
[1:44:28] unspiritual. But you know how I can get
[1:44:31] along with
[1:44:34] everybody? And you can get along with
[1:44:36] everybody. I'm going to tell you how.
[1:44:39] It's real easy.
[1:44:44] Compromise. Compromise. That's all you
[1:44:46] have to
[1:44:47] do.
[1:44:50] Compromise. But a believer won't
[1:44:52] compromise when it comes to the word.
[1:44:57] In the resume of the churches, brother
[1:44:59] Brandham said it like
[1:45:00] this. He said, speaking of that false
[1:45:03] vine, he said, "They outshine the elect
[1:45:06] in effort and zeal, but it is Leodysa,
[1:45:09] not of Christ. For it looks for big
[1:45:11] crowds, big programs, startling signs
[1:45:13] among them. They preach the second
[1:45:15] coming of Christ, but deny the advent of
[1:45:17] the prophet messenger. Though in power
[1:45:19] and signs and true revelation, he
[1:45:21] eclipses them all. Now, how do they deny
[1:45:23] it? By trying to imitate that same
[1:45:27] spirit, there was one prophet messenger
[1:45:29] to this age. Okay? And God used him for
[1:45:33] a specific thing. We all have our part
[1:45:35] and our place in God's kingdom in what
[1:45:37] we do. Said, "Oh yes, this false spirit
[1:45:40] that in the last days is so close to the
[1:45:42] real can only, now get this, can only be
[1:45:45] distinguish. It's so close. It can only
[1:45:48] be distinguished by its deviation from
[1:45:51] the word. And whenever it's caught and
[1:45:53] being an anti-word, it falls back on the
[1:45:56] one argument we've already shown to be
[1:45:58] false. We get results, don't we?
[1:46:03] We have to be of God.
[1:46:09] Told you about a false revival. What is
[1:46:11] a real revival? A real revival is an
[1:46:14] awakening. You were asleep and something
[1:46:16] woke you up. Therefore, it is for
[1:46:19] believers, true believers only. It is a
[1:46:23] move of God. And that move is like the
[1:46:26] moving of the water in a lake during a
[1:46:29] storm. And that word, the moving of the
[1:46:31] waters, has been grossly misunderstood.
[1:46:34] And I'm going to try to make it very
[1:46:36] clear, but it that's what it's like.
[1:46:37] That's what we've been taught. It's like
[1:46:39] the moving of the water during the storm
[1:46:40] in a lake. There's no more water as than
[1:46:43] there was before. It's just the moving
[1:46:45] the moving of the water. Now, what is
[1:46:48] that moving of the water? That's a
[1:46:50] revival.
[1:46:53] It is bringing the trash up that can't
[1:46:55] be seen from the bottom of the lake and
[1:46:58] throwing it out on the shore so it can
[1:47:00] be done away with.
[1:47:03] That's the moving of the water. Is the
[1:47:06] throwing the trash that's in our lives
[1:47:09] up on the bank. That's why it's for
[1:47:11] believers. It's not to bring unbelievers
[1:47:14] in. though it could do that and that's
[1:47:15] okay. But a real revival, what does it
[1:47:19] do? It may not make you happy. It might
[1:47:22] make you cry. It might make you sad. It
[1:47:24] might make you mad,
[1:47:27] but in the end, that trash comes up.
[1:47:33] You see,
[1:47:36] you might not dance in the spirit. You
[1:47:38] may weep and cry and sorry, why have I
[1:47:40] been so foolish? God help me.
[1:47:45] So that move and
[1:47:47] awakening that I'm talking about, that
[1:47:50] revival has
[1:47:54] come. It was promised and it's come.
[1:47:57] We're not looking for
[1:47:59] it. It's a message that woke the bride
[1:48:04] up. According to Matthew 25, it brings
[1:48:06] repentance to
[1:48:09] saints. that Saul was
[1:48:12] sorry of what he'd done, but actually he
[1:48:16] was sorry he got caught. He just wanted
[1:48:18] to look good before the people with
[1:48:21] Samuel at his side. That's not
[1:48:24] repentance. David sincerely obeyed when
[1:48:26] he realized his worship was
[1:48:29] wrong.
[1:48:30] And that is not a public show because
[1:48:34] God doesn't make a public show of our
[1:48:37] repentance.
[1:48:40] of what we do in disobedience or
[1:48:45] obedience. Uh because if he made a
[1:48:48] public show of what we do in our
[1:48:51] sacrifice to him, then our pride might
[1:48:53] get in the
[1:48:56] way. Then that's a denominational
[1:48:59] spirit that can
[1:49:02] come and cause us problems. When the
[1:49:05] true revival
[1:49:07] comes, you will see more prayer. You
[1:49:10] will see sincere repentance. You will
[1:49:12] see tears of joy. You'll see people
[1:49:14] moved by the word. It becomes a token
[1:49:17] life on display.
[1:49:22] Not greater personalities in the pull
[1:49:25] pit,
[1:49:28] but the poor, the persecuted, the
[1:49:32] rejected are
[1:49:34] moved are moved by the word of God. It
[1:49:38] moves them on the inside.
[1:49:41] You say, "Well, it'll move you on the
[1:49:42] outside." Yes, it'll cause you to dress
[1:49:45] right, to look right. It'll cause you to
[1:49:46] walk right. Walk with a token. Walk with
[1:49:50] a life that is in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:53] Becoming a preacher to everybody that
[1:49:55] sees you.
[1:49:58] Amen. Where there is a revival, you see
[1:50:00] people surrendered and consecrated to
[1:50:04] God. In the token sermon, Brother
[1:50:06] Brandham said, "If you have the token,
[1:50:09] and we know what the token is, okay,
[1:50:13] what is it? It's the literal literal
[1:50:16] life of Christ
[1:50:18] living in us to where when you walk
[1:50:22] young people look at brother Ivy when
[1:50:24] you walk wearing your dresses and your
[1:50:27] long hair and people see you and say
[1:50:29] what church do you go to what are you
[1:50:31] doing you're displaying the token
[1:50:34] you young men when you refuse to follow
[1:50:36] the crowd and to do the things that's
[1:50:39] right you're you're you're displaying
[1:50:42] the token. See, it's not enough to say,
[1:50:45] "Well, I have the token."
[1:50:48] A lot of people say, "I have the token."
[1:50:50] Huh? But is it displayed? The blood had
[1:50:53] to be displayed.
[1:50:55] Showing that the life was given.
[1:50:59] Display it.
[1:51:01] There's power in that. That's right. And
[1:51:04] so in that tur token sermon, he said,
[1:51:06] "If you got the token, you create a
[1:51:09] spirit around you, a power when you
[1:51:13] walk. People know that you're a
[1:51:15] Christian. They love for you to say
[1:51:17] something uh to them. They believe your
[1:51:20] word. What you say, they hold on to it.
[1:51:31] We've been
[1:51:33] taught there's
[1:51:36] two, the false and the true that will
[1:51:39] grow together until the
[1:51:41] end. And I say
[1:51:44] this respectfully, they'll grow together
[1:51:47] in the same message.
[1:51:51] leadership that brother Brandham
[1:51:53] preached. The last sermon that he
[1:51:55] preached, he had communion and he spoke
[1:51:57] at that. But the last full sermon he
[1:52:00] preached, he said this, and I'm closing
[1:52:02] with
[1:52:04] this. Uh he said, "But you see, you put
[1:52:07] a cockle burst seed and a wheat seed in
[1:52:11] the same bed and pour the water down
[1:52:14] upon them and anoint them, they'll both
[1:52:17] rejoice. They'll both grow by it." the
[1:52:21] same water. The sun shines on the just
[1:52:24] and the unjust. The rain falls on the
[1:52:26] just and the unjust, but by their fruits
[1:52:29] you shall know them. Is a token there
[1:52:32] when they
[1:52:33] walk. Is a token there when I stand
[1:52:36] behind the pull
[1:52:37] pit. You know, if I couldn't preach my
[1:52:40] way out of a wet paper bag, but if that
[1:52:43] token life is there, it would display
[1:52:45] itself out to you that you would
[1:52:47] recognize God.
[1:52:49] Amen. In the simplicity of his word
[1:52:57] goes on to say, "How can you keep from
[1:53:00] lining up with the word?" Amen. See what
[1:53:02] I mean? The water falls on the just and
[1:53:04] the unjust. Anoint
[1:53:07] it both.
[1:53:09] two two
[1:53:12] revivals in the same
[1:53:15] church, in the same message, in the same
[1:53:18] group, among the same people.
[1:53:20] They're both anointed young people.
[1:53:24] Listen to the sermon um that brother
[1:53:28] Brandham preached in regards to
[1:53:30] spiritual
[1:53:32] discernment. You don't judge the person
[1:53:35] by the gift they have, right? but by the
[1:53:38] spirit that they possess.
[1:53:41] The token life is it
[1:53:44] there? Let me finish the quote. Jesus
[1:53:47] said, "They will come to me in that
[1:53:50] day." Now, I believe we're in that day.
[1:53:54] They will come to me in that day and
[1:53:55] say, "Lord, Lord, have not I cast out
[1:53:58] devils? Have not I prophesy? Have not I
[1:54:01] done great things in your name?" He'll
[1:54:03] say, "You workers of iniquity, depart
[1:54:05] from me. I don't even know you. Go into
[1:54:09] eternal hell that's been prepared for
[1:54:11] the devil and his angels. You see what a
[1:54:14] word.
[1:54:15] Falsely worship in
[1:54:19] vain, striving in vain. Why do you do
[1:54:22] that when you don't have to do
[1:54:26] it? Why take a substitute
[1:54:29] when the heavens are full of the
[1:54:32] genuine?
[1:54:36] This was the last sermon brother, as I
[1:54:37] said, brother Brandham
[1:54:39] preached. He preached it in a
[1:54:41] denominational
[1:54:43] setting, but I think it's true to all of
[1:54:45] us
[1:54:47] today. Somehow he may have knew that God
[1:54:50] was going fixing to take him off the
[1:54:52] scene. I believe with an urgency, he
[1:54:55] cried out to all of
[1:54:56] us to recognize these things in the day
[1:54:59] that we're living in and what it is and
[1:55:02] the condition that it is.
[1:55:04] Because as he quoted the scripture, the
[1:55:07] sun shines upon the just and the unjust.
[1:55:09] The rain falls on on everybody and
[1:55:12] everybody in between. They're all
[1:55:18] anointed. But God will say, "I don't
[1:55:21] know you. Go to eternal hell." Quoting
[1:55:25] Brother Brandham, that's prepared for
[1:55:27] the devil and his angels.
[1:55:30] But I found this
[1:55:31] out over the
[1:55:35] years that there's many that you cannot
[1:55:39] help because they don't believe that is
[1:55:42] them.
[1:55:44] Do you
[1:55:46] understand?
[1:55:50] A a person that like Saul, they don't
[1:55:55] recognize that that is them.
[1:55:57] They have been convinced in their own
[1:56:00] spirit that they are right in what they
[1:56:03] do because they're offering a sacrifice
[1:56:06] to
[1:56:07] God
[1:56:08] contrary to what the prophet said,
[1:56:12] contrary to what the word of God says.
[1:56:15] That's why it's so important whether
[1:56:17] you're a young lady over there, a young
[1:56:19] man, a young man, young men over here,
[1:56:23] to know the word of God yourself.
[1:56:31] is an individual affair. It's between
[1:56:33] you and God. Not you and mom, you and
[1:56:35] dad. Between you and
[1:56:39] God. When
[1:56:41] Baleo, the great king, wanted to have a
[1:56:45] revival, who did he call to preach
[1:56:49] it? Going to have a great
[1:56:51] revival. And he wanted to call somebody
[1:56:53] to preach it.
[1:56:56] He wanted to call somebody that he felt
[1:56:58] that he could influence.
[1:57:01] Somebody that he felt would say the
[1:57:04] things he wanted him to say,
[1:57:07] would follow the pattern of persecution
[1:57:09] against Israel that he wanted to do. So
[1:57:13] what did he
[1:57:16] do? He found the best preacher in the
[1:57:19] land, the most
[1:57:23] anointed. His name was
[1:57:28] Balum. And you know,
[1:57:30] Balam
[1:57:31] prophesied and we read some of those
[1:57:34] prophecies to this day which were some
[1:57:36] of the greatest prophecies ever given in
[1:57:39] regards to the coming of the great
[1:57:41] Messiah.
[1:57:42] He was a prophet.
[1:57:45] He made he had had them make the same
[1:57:49] altars and sacrifice just like the
[1:57:52] prophet Moses down in the valley. Just
[1:57:54] like
[1:58:00] it. But there was a difference,
[1:58:05] okay, between Moses and Balum.
[1:58:12] A huge difference. Many could not tell
[1:58:15] the difference. Even godly, sincere
[1:58:18] people in Israel fell for Balam's trap,
[1:58:22] begin to be influenced by him. After
[1:58:25] all, he was a great preacher.
[1:58:29] Defiling their
[1:58:31] separation from God, from what the word,
[1:58:33] from what the prophet had said. What was
[1:58:36] the
[1:58:37] difference? It It's so so hard for
[1:58:41] people to see.
[1:58:43] The
[1:58:45] seed
[1:58:47] seed. That was the only difference. The
[1:58:51] only difference. That's what our prophet
[1:58:53] said. Moses was a true seed.
[1:58:58] Bam was a false
[1:59:00] seed. That's why there are those that I
[1:59:03] could preach this to and would never see
[1:59:06] what I'm saying. Never see it at
[1:59:09] all. and yet continue on being very
[1:59:14] spiritual. It's the seed. But if you
[1:59:17] have the seed, the token life will be
[1:59:20] there. And when you walk,
[1:59:25] listen, especially you young
[1:59:28] people. It'll be Jesus walking.
[1:59:33] Jesus can still walk. The only hands he
[1:59:36] has upon earth now, young man, is your
[1:59:39] hands.
[1:59:42] Uh he has your mouth.
[1:59:46] And so Jesus is still
[1:59:49] here by the token life that is in
[1:59:53] us. And as you walk, as you go to
[1:59:57] school, as you get an
[1:59:59] education, as you girls look for a
[2:00:02] husband, don't look for one.
[2:00:06] God will send you a husband just as well
[2:00:09] as the Holy Ghost. Amen. Huh? Just walk
[2:00:13] with a token.
[2:00:16] Let that godly life shine out through
[2:00:18] you. Amen.
[2:00:21] Judge things righteously by the word.
[2:00:24] Not by the gift that somebody has, but
[2:00:27] by the word. And how do you know? H how
[2:00:30] do I know, Brother Ivy? Because you are
[2:00:33] the word. It'll speak to you.
[2:00:38] There'll be something inside you that'll
[2:00:41] say, "That's nothing but the truth. I
[2:00:42] don't understand. I'm not going to
[2:00:44] explain it, but I know it's right."
[2:00:50] I grew up in Pentecost and as I said, my
[2:00:54] dad was a Pentecostal preacher,
[2:00:56] pastor. I saw the supernatural. I saw
[2:00:59] many great things take place. It was, as
[2:01:01] I said this morning, a great shock.
[2:01:03] Thank God for it. Uh but when this
[2:01:07] message came to me, I found something
[2:01:09] real, something lasting, and I don't
[2:01:12] want to go back to that. I want to stay
[2:01:15] with thus sayeth the Lord. And thus
[2:01:17] sayith the Lord has come to us in this
[2:01:19] generation and has spoke to those that
[2:01:22] can have thus sayeth the Lord that can
[2:01:23] receive it. Do you love him tonight?
[2:01:25] Amen. Let's stand to our feet. You that
[2:01:28] play the instruments,
[2:01:30] come and I want to sing. He's all I
[2:01:33] need. I don't know if I preached too
[2:01:35] long tonight. I hope I didn't longer
[2:01:38] than I have strength to preach
[2:01:42] really on a Sunday
[2:01:44] evening.
[2:01:46] So, he's all I need. Could we sing that
[2:01:49] as in a kiss for me? If you could do
[2:01:51] that in that
[2:01:52] cave. He's
[2:01:55] all I need.
[2:01:59] is
[2:02:01] all I
[2:02:04] need. Oh
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:07] Jesus is
[2:02:09] all I
[2:02:15] need. Is
[2:02:17] all I
[2:02:20] need is
[2:02:23] all I need.
[2:02:27] Well,
[2:02:29] Jesus is all.
[2:02:34] Lift your hands now. I worship
[2:02:37] him. I
[2:02:41] worship him. Our
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:52] worship
[2:02:55] and
[2:02:59] truth. I
[2:03:03] worship you.
[2:03:06] I will
[2:03:09] worship
[2:03:11] him in
[2:03:15] spirit
[2:03:17] and he's all I need. Once again,
[2:03:21] singing, he's all I need. He
[2:03:25] Oh, that's all you need tonight. There's
[2:03:28] nothing else you need. You just need
[2:03:31] him. He's here.
[2:03:37] Jesus is
[2:03:39] all I
[2:03:44] need. Is
[2:03:48] all I
[2:03:50] need is
[2:03:53] all I need.
[2:03:58] Jesus,
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:03] I
[2:04:08] [Music]
[2:04:20] need his name.
[2:04:26] Oh, hallelujah. That's God with us.
[2:04:30] [Applause]
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:38] Oh, that sounds good. From your heart,
[2:04:41] sing it
[2:04:43] to
[2:04:49] me. His
[2:04:52] name
[2:04:58] is
[2:05:04] everywhere. I have a
[2:05:11] longing longing.
[2:05:15] Oh, do you have that longing?
[2:05:18] He's coming soon.
[2:05:25] Anybody need prayer? We'll be glad to
[2:05:27] pray
[2:05:33] for just to
[2:05:42] be his presence.
[2:05:45] [Music]
[2:05:48] I
[2:05:51] have in my
[2:05:55] heart.
[2:05:57] Oh. Oh. One more time. Just with all
[2:06:00] your heart. Sing
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:04] that. Do you have that
[2:06:06] longing? Come on, church. Do you have
[2:06:08] that
[2:06:09] longing? Something burning deep inside.
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:16] I
[2:06:18] have a
[2:06:19] longing in my heart.
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:45] I
[2:06:47] [Music]
[2:06:52] am
[2:06:53] for him
[2:06:57] because he lives I can face tomorrow. I
[2:06:59] don't know what
[2:07:00] kid he calls
[2:07:07] healing
[2:07:14] I
[2:07:21] Yeah. Heat.
[2:07:37] Oh
[2:07:44] my
[2:07:52] word. One more time. Let's sing the
[2:07:55] chords together.
[2:08:02] Hallelujah.
[2:08:04] Worship him in your own way. Worship
[2:08:07] him. Don't let him pass you
[2:08:18] by.
[2:08:23] Yeah. Heat.
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:40] his words.
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:49] God sent his son.
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:58] They Jesus.
[2:09:02] He came to love, heal, and he came
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:09] to
[2:09:12] He
[2:09:15] for
[2:09:16] Hallelujah. He lived. He lived and he
[2:09:20] died by my part. Amen.
[2:09:28] An empty grave is there to prove my
[2:09:36] s to prove
[2:09:39] my glory to God.
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:53] Hallelujah. Heat.
[2:10:03] Heat.
[2:10:10] Glory. Amen.
[2:10:37] Just keep playing
[2:10:39] that. As I get older, as me and brother
[2:10:43] David get
[2:10:47] older, there's no going back and redoing
[2:10:49] things
[2:10:50] that undoing them and fixing them. And
[2:10:54] that's
[2:10:56] passed. You know, as a songwriter said
[2:10:58] in that song that we were singing, and
[2:11:01] if you could show it here where I could
[2:11:02] see the the words to it, I guess it's
[2:11:05] here. Yes.
[2:11:07] songwriter said, "And then one day I'll
[2:11:09] cross that river."
[2:11:12] I realize, Brother David, we're getting
[2:11:14] closer to that river all the time. Our
[2:11:15] feet's getting wet. Maybe we're ankle
[2:11:18] deep in it. There's somebody on the
[2:11:20] other side calling for us.
[2:11:23] Amen. But you know, we're not walking
[2:11:25] alone. I believe there's a theophony
[2:11:28] right beside us that we're going to step
[2:11:30] into.
[2:11:31] That theophony is cheering us on. and
[2:11:34] those on the other side said, "Come on,
[2:11:36] get your feet wet. Come on."
[2:11:40] A great crowd of
[2:11:42] witnesses. And then one
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:49] day, I'll cross.
[2:11:55] I'll fight life's final war with
[2:12:00] [Applause]
[2:12:01] Amen.
[2:12:06] And then his death is way to victory.
[2:12:19] Oh, I can almost see the lights of glory
[2:12:22] now.
[2:12:23] Amen. Glory to God.
[2:12:27] Hallelujah.
[2:12:30] Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:12:33] Oh, sing it out. Let the angels hear
[2:12:47] you. Heat. Heat.
[2:12:57] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:13:08] Oh yes.
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:30] Amen.
[2:13:32] Amen.
[2:13:33] I'm so glad the Lord spoke those words
[2:13:36] to us tonight.
[2:13:38] It is the secret. That's right. To the
[2:13:42] rapture.
[2:13:46] It's simple. The way forward is the
[2:13:50] bread of life.
[2:13:52] It's the way
[2:13:53] forward is to know him.
[2:13:58] This is the will of the father to know
[2:14:01] him whom he sent.
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:06] You know, I thought as brother Bill
[2:14:09] spoke, I've had an opportunity
[2:14:12] to visit
[2:14:15] some sites that are worldrenowned sites.
[2:14:20] And every time I go, there's a
[2:14:23] tour. You know, someone will hold up a
[2:14:26] flag from their country and the people
[2:14:29] will go on this tour.
[2:14:32] And I always notice there's some that
[2:14:34] tag along the tour. They probably didn't
[2:14:38] pay, but they sneak in and they stand
[2:14:42] and they listen and they follow it
[2:14:45] around and and you know, I I've been on
[2:14:49] those tours, but I always hire a private
[2:14:53] guide because I want to ask the
[2:14:56] questions that are on my heart. I don't
[2:14:59] want to be one of the crowd.
[2:15:02] You know, when they went to Israel, they
[2:15:06] I saw buses after buses after buses, but
[2:15:10] yet me and Lesie went with just one
[2:15:13] person so we could find out what it
[2:15:18] is. And that's what's beautiful about
[2:15:20] this word. You don't have to be a part
[2:15:23] of a crowd. Yeah, you can have your own
[2:15:27] personal guide
[2:15:30] that you can ask the questions about
[2:15:34] your life and your problems and your
[2:15:38] situations
[2:15:40] and he'll take the
[2:15:41] time because he purchased the tour for
[2:15:45] you. Not only did he purchase it, but
[2:15:48] he's your guide. He's your question
[2:15:51] answer. He knows where to take you. He
[2:15:54] knows what he wants to show you. He
[2:15:58] knows what's important. He knows what's
[2:16:00] fake and what's false.
[2:16:04] And our guide pointed out, he said, "See
[2:16:07] this building over here? That's where
[2:16:09] they make the widow
[2:16:11] mites that everybody's
[2:16:15] buying. There's probably not a rear one
[2:16:17] left anywhere, but you could pick them
[2:16:20] up by the thousand.
[2:16:23] And a real guide keeps you from p buying
[2:16:25] what's false, what's fake and what's
[2:16:29] real.
[2:16:30] And he guides you. Aren't you glad we
[2:16:33] have a guide?
[2:16:35] It's not a group of men. It's a
[2:16:39] person. It's the person that God so
[2:16:42] loved this
[2:16:44] seed as our brother so brilliantly
[2:16:48] bought brought this evening that he sent
[2:16:52] a
[2:16:53] messenger to reach out and touch your
[2:16:56] heart that you wouldn't take anything
[2:17:00] that wasn't
[2:17:03] genuine. And that's what we want to make
[2:17:05] sure this evening. Make sure that you
[2:17:08] have a
[2:17:11] guide. Make sure you know
[2:17:13] him. And his name is
[2:17:17] Jesus. That's who you want guiding your
[2:17:20] life. And I was touched in my own heart
[2:17:23] and brought under a conviction my own
[2:17:27] self. How much of the world we need to
[2:17:30] get away from? We need to get away from
[2:17:33] the voices,
[2:17:36] the other leaders, the other influences,
[2:17:39] the other things that want you to go
[2:17:42] this way and that way. We have an
[2:17:45] absolute in this hour.
[2:17:51] It was a
[2:17:52] man that was born into this earth to
[2:17:56] fulfill Malachi
[2:17:58] 4:5. Luke
[2:18:01] 17:30, Revelations 10:7, he was born.
[2:18:05] Even his words, even the shape of his
[2:18:08] mouth, his personality was designed by
[2:18:11] God to open to you those seals and those
[2:18:15] mysteries. It's not for the ministry.
[2:18:18] It's for you. Yes. His sheep. My sheep
[2:18:22] hear my voice
[2:18:24] and another they will not
[2:18:27] follow. Make sure you
[2:18:31] connect with the
[2:18:33] leadership that the Lord Jesus has
[2:18:37] sent. Make sure you're not influenced by
[2:18:43] position, influenced by anything but
[2:18:46] that voice.
[2:18:48] and that heart and your experience with
[2:18:50] him. And once again, I'd say take the
[2:18:54] time this week to
[2:18:57] reckindle that experience, to
[2:19:01] rekindle that leadership, to get back to
[2:19:04] that voice that God has sent to you in
[2:19:08] this generation to lead and guide you.
[2:19:12] And I recognize many of the quotes that
[2:19:14] brother Bill read from the church age
[2:19:18] book from different
[2:19:21] sermons. Be led, church. We're at the
[2:19:24] end. Amen. We have one voice that'll
[2:19:28] take us all the way through. So Lord
[2:19:31] richly bless you tonight. Brother Bill,
[2:19:34] I personally enjoyed that. It was
[2:19:37] personally for me. It was delightful and
[2:19:41] I can look out across all the world and
[2:19:43] apply that to so many different
[2:19:45] situations. But when it all comes back
[2:19:48] around, it all gets back to the Lord
[2:19:51] Jesus
[2:19:53] and the word that he brought to us to
[2:19:56] lead us out of here in this hour. Lord,
[2:19:59] you brother Tim, would you come dismiss
[2:20:01] us in prayer? You love the Lord. If you
[2:20:04] love him, love one another. Yes, sir.
[2:20:07] Amen. Will you do better to serve him
[2:20:09] this week? Amen.
[2:20:12] God bless you, my brother. Thank you,
[2:20:14] man. Don't you love Sunday night?
[2:20:17] It's like we had a meal this morning and
[2:20:19] then we got a second helping tonight.
[2:20:22] And since it's recorded, we might even
[2:20:24] get leftovers. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:28] Amen. I want to quote David before we
[2:20:30] pray.
[2:20:34] He said, "He that is our God is the God
[2:20:36] of salvation." Amen. Let's bow our
[2:20:39] heads.
[2:20:41] Lord, we surely can turn to no one else.
[2:20:45] Lord, when we're seeking our own
[2:20:49] salvation, but Lord, we have none of our
[2:20:51] own. You are the
[2:20:54] provider. Your word says many times
[2:20:56] over, salvation is of the Lord. So Lord,
[2:20:59] we thank you for the words we've heard
[2:21:01] today, Lord. That we can ease up a
[2:21:03] little higher on the ladder, Lord. That
[2:21:05] we're closer. We can look up. Our
[2:21:07] salvation is drawing nearer. Lord,
[2:21:10] quicken it to our hearts, we pray. And
[2:21:12] the words that were spoken, Lord, may
[2:21:13] they just rest on our minds and drop
[2:21:16] down in our hearts, Lord, and continue
[2:21:17] to feed us.
[2:21:19] Lord, by your word and your will, put us
[2:21:22] in the place,
[2:21:23] Lord, that we
[2:21:26] have, Lord, the uncction, the moving,
[2:21:29] the revelation, the desire even for what
[2:21:31] you have for us, Lord, and we might be
[2:21:34] found, Lord, that you're soon
[2:21:37] appearing, Lord, doing the things that
[2:21:40] you would have us do. Granted, Lord,
[2:21:42] that you draw us all closer to you for
[2:21:44] having been in the service tonight.
[2:21:46] Lord, as we leave this building, even
[2:21:48] Lord, may just an extra blessing fall
[2:21:51] upon us for having assembled ourselves
[2:21:54] together, Lord. Sung these songs of
[2:21:56] Zion, felt closer to you for it, Lord.
[2:21:59] Lord, those truly that have requests on
[2:22:01] their hearts, Lord. Continue to work
[2:22:04] your will in their lives, Lord. Answer
[2:22:06] them as you see fit, Lord. We ask and
[2:22:08] believe all these things in the name of
[2:22:10] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank
[2:22:13] you, brother Tim. You love him. Have you
[2:22:17] ever been sorry that you chose him?
[2:22:20] Have you ever been sorry you followed
[2:22:22] him? Have you ever been sorry that you
[2:22:25] heard his
[2:22:26] word? I've never been sorry. Amen. Never
[2:22:31] been sorry.
