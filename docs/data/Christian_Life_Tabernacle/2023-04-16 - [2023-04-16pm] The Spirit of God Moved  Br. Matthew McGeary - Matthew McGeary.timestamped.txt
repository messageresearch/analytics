[46:30] sanctuary
[46:34] that's what we're here for
[46:36] the Kingdom of Heaven is within you
[46:40] don't don't look to somebody else but
[46:44] maybe maybe each one of you can turn and
[46:46] look at your neighbor and say the
[46:47] Kingdom of Heaven is in you
[46:49] why don't you do that
[46:53] you know that's the truth
[46:56] it's not way out there somewhere
[46:58] but it's right here
[47:00] then if then if a world that's dying

[47:09] where are they gonna find it
[47:12] could you imagine having the cure to
[47:14] cancer and having the cure to to the

[47:19] it all to yourself
[47:21] it's all mine glory to God I'm going to
[47:24] heaven well if that was the attitude
[47:26] then you really don't got what you think
[47:28] you have

[48:17] Heavenly Father
[48:19] You're The Great I Am
[48:24] you're a savior you're Our Redeemer
[48:29] and to think that we are standing
[48:32] in the very place of the fullness of
[48:36] redemption
[48:38] that everyone every patriarch
[48:42] every apostle
[48:43] every Prophet that lived before us
[48:46] would want to live right now
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] we're humbled Lord may we not take it
[48:52] for granted
[48:54] may we not be
[48:57] distracted by what the world has to
[49:00] offer
[49:01] may we be focused Christians with a
[49:04] focused faith on the goal and the
[49:06] objective Lord
[49:07] not forgetting that we're in a great
[49:09] battle and a war has been set in a ray
[49:12] and we're the very ones that you wanted
[49:14] to be here to sum it all up
[49:17] we're thankful lord it's not according
[49:19] to Ability or intellect
[49:21] but it's all because of you Lord that
[49:24] we're here
[49:25] and you're the reason for our victory
[49:28] and we know that you've said that we are
[49:30] your Victory it's because you live in US
[49:33] we just want to Avail ourselves to you
[49:35] tonight that you could come and break
[49:36] the bread of life to your people
[49:38] Lord your word says that my sheep know
[49:40] my voice
[49:41] May It Be Your Voice according to the
[49:43] word that speaks to your children Lord
[49:45] and that's the voice we want to follow
[49:47] we love you now we commit ourselves to
[49:49] you in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[49:52] and praise the Lord if you're just
[49:53] turning your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 5
[49:57] we'll read verse 12 and 14.
[50:06] man I've been enjoying the nice weather
[50:07] outside
[50:10] we know it's soon to depart
[50:13] but you know it's uh
[50:15] it's easy to look into nature and
[50:17] realize that you know even as Believers
[50:20] we go through seasons
[50:22] we go through uh many times there's
[50:25] Winters and there's Summers
[50:27] but I sure like the spring
[50:31] everything's springing forth with life
[50:33] and you have all the uh the different
[50:36] colors of green emerging out and
[50:39] it's just wonderful to
[50:43] to be able to see that amen just reading
[50:45] out of Hebrews chapter 5
[50:50] and verse 12 through 14.
[50:56] for when for the time you ought to be
[50:59] teachers
[51:00] you have need that one teach you again
[51:02] which be the first principles of the
[51:04] Oracles of God
[51:06] and are become such as have need of milk
[51:09] and not
[51:11] of strong meat
[51:13] for everyone that uses milk is
[51:15] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[51:17] for he is a babe
[51:19] but strong meat belongeth to them that
[51:21] are of full age
[51:24] so who does strong meat belong to
[51:26] them that are of full age now I don't
[51:30] want to count out the young people I
[51:32] believe you can be a full age
[51:34] and be 10 11 12 years old that's not up
[51:37] to me that's up to your hunger and
[51:40] thirst for righteousness and that's up
[51:41] to God and if you want to be a mature
[51:44] rugged soldier in a full age I believe
[51:47] God can apprehend your life and Your
[51:49] Vessel and he can make you rugged men of
[51:52] the Gospel full age
[51:54] but I'm only 10 11 years old well that's
[51:56] all right we can use an anointed Born
[51:59] Again full of the Holy Ghost 10 and 11
[52:01] year old to sweep this thing on into the
[52:03] coming of the Lord
[52:04] even those by the reason of the use have
[52:08] their senses exercised to discern both
[52:11] good
[52:12] and evil let's also turn into Genesis uh
[52:15] chapter 1.
[52:23] I enjoyed the word this morning
[52:27] once again my voice is pretty rough so
[52:30] if you give me all the
[52:31] all the juice you got brother Mike that
[52:33] would be wonderful and I can just get
[52:35] try to gauge the volume by by lowering
[52:37] or raising the mic so
[52:41] Genesis chapter one and we'll just read
[52:44] the first three verses here it says in
[52:46] the beginning God created the heavens
[52:48] and the Earth
[52:49] and the Earth was without form and void
[52:51] and darkness was upon the face of the
[52:53] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[52:56] the face of the waters and God said let
[52:58] there be light
[53:00] and there was light amen you may have
[53:02] your seats
[53:09] well how many are overcoming
[53:11] in this evil generation
[53:14] amen it's
[53:16] by the blood of the Lamb it's by the
[53:18] word of the testimony
[53:19] it's by the word of the Lord how many
[53:21] has the victory
[53:23] oh aren't you thankful for the victory
[53:26] there's something about having the
[53:28] victory it just makes you excited and I
[53:30] like a lot of those veins our brother
[53:32] hit down you know a a victory doesn't
[53:34] mean you're on the Mountaintop that
[53:37] that's that's when it's easy
[53:39] you know that that's when it's easy you
[53:40] know in the church setting and in the
[53:42] church camp and here on a on a Sunday
[53:44] night or a Wednesday night you know it
[53:46] hey that's why we come together is to
[53:48] get the victory but I want to take the
[53:50] victory home with me I want to take it
[53:52] to my job I want to take it back to my
[53:54] family and when the tough gets going and
[53:56] and you feel like you're down in the
[53:58] dumps and you don't know what you're in
[54:00] and you're out one thing you know
[54:03] that he is with you
[54:05] and you have the victory look the how
[54:09] does it say you know this the sunshine
[54:10] doesn't mean God's for you and the storm
[54:12] clouds doesn't mean he's against you
[54:14] he's with you no matter what you know if
[54:17] you make your bed in hell what he's
[54:19] there if it's in heaven he is there it's
[54:22] so good to be Overcomers in this evil
[54:25] and wicked generation the prophet of God
[54:26] would say this in the church age book
[54:28] he's saying I remember this Christ in
[54:30] the true church is a continuation of the
[54:33] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[54:35] shows how the Antichrist Spirit would
[54:38] come into the church and defile it
[54:40] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[54:43] and exposes Satan revealing his Works
[54:47] attempted destruction of God's people
[54:49] and the discrediting of God's word right
[54:53] down to the time he is thrown into the
[54:55] Lake of Fire so notice that what what
[54:57] the Antichrist spirit is always trying
[54:59] to do is discredit God's word he's
[55:02] wanting to try to add to he's always
[55:04] wanting to try to take away but I I
[55:06] maybe want to bring to your attention as
[55:08] we just maybe allow God to have his way
[55:10] this evening but you know if the prophet
[55:13] of God says that one of his ways is to
[55:15] discredit the word of God we really need
[55:17] to recognize who we are because you are
[55:20] the word of God and one thing we will
[55:22] stand up for will stand up for the
[55:24] written word we'll stand up for the
[55:26] spoken word we'll stand up for our
[55:29] brothers and we'll stand up for our
[55:30] sisters but when that Old Devil comes
[55:33] and he tries to start discrediting the
[55:35] word which you are we actually start to
[55:37] give them a little ear we start to
[55:39] actually reason a little bit and we
[55:41] actually start to give them ground when
[55:43] he starts to come in and say well you
[55:45] might not be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:47] maybe you're just foolish virgin but you
[55:49] you've done a lot of good things to the
[55:51] bride and you'll make it in on a cup of
[55:53] water and then if you start to try to
[55:55] bank on that and say you know that's not
[55:57] a bad thought you know I am kind of a
[55:58] bad person I really haven't been living
[56:00] an overcoming life but you know I'm just
[56:02] going to keep doing good to the bride
[56:04] look you're coming off of your ground
[56:05] you're actually allowing him to
[56:07] discredit the word of God because you
[56:10] are the word of God the message that has
[56:12] been spoken through Malachi 4 5 has
[56:15] spoken a bride into existence
[56:18] and you are that bride and when the
[56:22] devil tries to discredit who you are in
[56:24] your position in the word then he's
[56:26] trying to make you cold formal and
[56:29] Powerless but you got to stand your
[56:31] ground and say devil ain't backing up I
[56:33] ain't gonna quit I know who I am and I
[56:36] am persuaded I've committed my life to
[56:38] Jesus Christ and he is the one that's
[56:40] residing over this vessel he is at the
[56:42] command center he's the one that's
[56:44] controlling my heart my mind my life my
[56:46] eyes and he told me that I'm an
[56:48] overcomer he told me that I'm Victorious
[56:51] and I'm not going to allow you to
[56:53] discredit the word of God in Me
[56:56] amen
[56:57] we got to start taking sides with the
[57:00] word it's so easy to to come off our
[57:02] ground when it comes to us just think of
[57:04] how much you would fight for your
[57:05] brother think about how much you would
[57:07] fight for the sister think how much you
[57:08] would fight for your savior well your
[57:10] savior did all for you that you could be
[57:12] who you are in this generation so stand
[57:15] up for yourself
[57:17] don't back up
[57:20] he cannot stand revelation
[57:23] he knows that if the people get a true
[57:26] revelation of the true church and what
[57:28] she is
[57:29] what she stands for
[57:32] she can do the Greater Works
[57:35] she will be an invincible Army I'm so
[57:39] thankful to be living in the Realms of
[57:42] the manifestation of what has been
[57:43] spoken by a Prophet this is not
[57:46] something coming off in the future this
[57:48] is not something we're looking for some
[57:50] climactic event but I believe that I'm
[57:52] standing in the presence of a mighty
[57:55] Victorious Army
[57:58] that gots the victory we're not just
[58:01] trying to rally the troops because we've
[58:03] been wounded and and we didn't win the
[58:06] battle and now we're all running back
[58:08] and saying oh the messenger's been taken
[58:10] off the scene what are we going to do
[58:12] how are we going to go in a Rapture
[58:13] we're waiting for some tent Vision or
[58:15] something I don't know what God's gonna
[58:17] do I don't know how he's going to do it
[58:19] but one thing I know is what he said and
[58:21] he said Christ is here and then if his
[58:24] if he's here then why do you have to
[58:26] fear there's a man here that can turn on
[58:28] the light and the Darkness of Lady
[58:30] you'll see it with all the dark and
[58:32] Gloom and everything around him people
[58:33] don't know which way to go there's a man
[58:35] here and what is his name his name is
[58:37] Jesus Jesus Christ is here to turn on
[58:40] the light so you can see
[58:42] I think it's profound I believe the next
[58:44] sermon he preaches that evening is Look
[58:46] Away to Jesus is that I believe that's
[58:47] right
[58:48] I love the message you can just it'll
[58:51] preach to you in titles you couldn't
[58:53] look to you couldn't even look away to
[58:55] Jesus if there wasn't a man here that
[58:57] could turn on the light but thanks be to
[58:59] God
[59:00] we have received a message to turn on
[59:02] the light so you can look away to Jesus
[59:04] look away and live
[59:07] you can do the Greater Works if they get
[59:10] a true revelation of the two Spirits
[59:12] within the framework of the Christian
[59:14] church and by God's spirit
[59:18] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[59:21] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[59:25] her
[59:28] now I might just be fullness enough to
[59:30] believe it but I believe Satan is
[59:32] powerless before me
[59:35] I believe Satan is powerless before you
[59:39] now remember Satan wants to discredit
[59:41] that word and say then why are you sick
[59:44] now let's just go back into the into our
[59:47] scripture you see God has a pattern and
[59:49] he never changes his pattern if that
[59:51] excuse would work
[59:53] then how could Jesus have a headache
[59:56] how could Jesus have infirmities how
[59:59] could all of these happen to the word
[1:00:01] made flesh that there it was something
[1:00:03] that Jesus had to go through that he
[1:00:05] could be a high priest that's touched by
[1:00:07] the feeling of your infirmity
[1:00:09] and also you are a testimony your life
[1:00:13] is an example it's the very word living
[1:00:15] out through you dear in that infirmity
[1:00:17] remember oh what remember what it means
[1:00:20] to be unconquered
[1:00:22] remember what it means to to be
[1:00:24] victorious it's not always the things
[1:00:26] that you do
[1:00:28] it's the things that you don't do
[1:00:32] so then it's in the trial it's in the
[1:00:35] sickness when you do it looks like
[1:00:37] there's no way out you can't see light
[1:00:39] at the end of the tunnel and you stand
[1:00:42] there and you say My God Is A Healer he
[1:00:45] healed me in the body he's given me a
[1:00:47] promise and I'm not gonna back up and
[1:00:49] I'm not gonna quit oh that means you are
[1:00:52] an invincible Army in the face of all
[1:00:54] obstacles Hallelujah God has raised up a
[1:00:58] bride in the face of all obstacles when
[1:01:00] it looks like all hope is gone it looks
[1:01:03] like you're never going to get the
[1:01:04] victory you stand right there in the
[1:01:06] face of the devil and say I don't care
[1:01:08] what you throw at me Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:11] same yesterday today and forever I won't
[1:01:14] back up I'm not going to quit this
[1:01:16] message is true whether it heals me on
[1:01:18] this side or that side my God Is A
[1:01:20] Healer
[1:01:22] now that's an invincible Army now you're
[1:01:24] starting to sound like an invincible
[1:01:26] Army
[1:01:28] I love the story about Jonathan you know
[1:01:30] Jonathan got a revelation uh you know
[1:01:33] Saul was his daddy and Saul really
[1:01:34] wasn't doing too good job taking care of
[1:01:36] the Kingdom
[1:01:39] Jonathan got sitting around there he
[1:01:41] said you know what
[1:01:42] let's just go take care of these
[1:01:44] Philistines
[1:01:46] he told his armor bear come on let's go
[1:01:49] let's go kill these fellas because
[1:01:51] Jonathan had a revelation Jonathan got a
[1:01:54] revelation he said you know what I come
[1:01:55] to find out
[1:01:57] it's not so much how many of uh of us
[1:02:00] that we are
[1:02:04] it's who's with us
[1:02:06] he told his army bear come on let's go
[1:02:08] if God can save us with ten thousand he
[1:02:11] could save us with ten and he took his
[1:02:14] armor Bearer over there and he slew all
[1:02:16] them Philistines because he had a
[1:02:17] revelation that God is with me we the
[1:02:20] are the elected chosen bride of Jesus
[1:02:23] Christ and nothing can stand before us I
[1:02:25] think it's time that we go to battle
[1:02:27] it's time that we go fight for our
[1:02:29] brothers and sisters we got some of them
[1:02:31] out there I'm going to get them I'm
[1:02:33] going to bring him into the house of God
[1:02:34] why because we are the Invincible Army
[1:02:37] of God
[1:02:41] by God's spirit we discern and withstand
[1:02:44] yeah brother Matthew that sounds all
[1:02:46] fine and dandy but what about getting
[1:02:48] down to where we live
[1:02:51] what about when we're all alone
[1:02:53] what about when we're on the job
[1:02:55] what about me when I'm in my trial yes
[1:02:59] by God's spirit we need to discern what
[1:03:01] is right and wrong
[1:03:03] we need to rightly divide the word of
[1:03:06] Truth
[1:03:07] Prophet would say we need Revelation by
[1:03:09] the spirit
[1:03:11] God wants to reveal his word to us by
[1:03:14] the spirit
[1:03:17] as the prophet would start to lay open
[1:03:19] that church-aged book he would start out
[1:03:21] look it's good to be a student of the
[1:03:23] word
[1:03:24] it's good to study but it takes more
[1:03:27] than that it's going to take a
[1:03:29] supernatural Revelation by the spirit to
[1:03:33] give you the very meaning of the things
[1:03:35] that are set forth in the book
[1:03:38] and just drawing from our text out of
[1:03:41] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 3 and the
[1:03:45] spirit of God moved I'd like to speak to
[1:03:47] you a little tonight on end the spirit
[1:03:49] of God move the prophet of God would say
[1:03:51] in the power of transformation he would
[1:03:53] say now in Genesis chapter 1. the spirit
[1:03:56] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:04:00] we realize that the water and the Bible
[1:04:02] said in the beginning back there that
[1:04:04] the world was without form
[1:04:07] and was void
[1:04:09] there was nothing but just a darkness of
[1:04:12] Chaos
[1:04:14] what a horrible shape it must have been
[1:04:16] in
[1:04:17] nothing but way into the darkness Yonder
[1:04:20] without light or anything
[1:04:22] and the churning of the water and the
[1:04:24] wandering star twisted around and around
[1:04:27] the orbits out there somewhere
[1:04:30] it must have been a terrific mass of
[1:04:32] something lost like it was
[1:04:34] couldn't find its way
[1:04:37] and that's what we become
[1:04:39] we become wandering Stars away from God
[1:04:42] without hope
[1:04:44] without God just churning around in
[1:04:48] darkness not knowing where we're going
[1:04:51] and God took that great chaos of
[1:04:53] Darkness
[1:04:55] and transformed it into a Garden of Eden
[1:05:00] by his word
[1:05:03] now we know the scripture says in John 1
[1:05:06] 1 it says in the beginning
[1:05:10] was the word
[1:05:12] and the Word was with God
[1:05:15] and the Word was God
[1:05:19] John 4 24 would say and God is a spirit
[1:05:24] so many times you might get confused in
[1:05:28] the scripture and it says
[1:05:30] and the spirit of God it says God
[1:05:34] created the Heaven and the spirit of God
[1:05:37] moved and God said and we hear God and
[1:05:40] the word and the spirit and if and if we
[1:05:44] if we're not careful you you might get
[1:05:46] lost in that but we want to just lay a
[1:05:48] foundation that as
[1:05:52] Jesus would say in John 4 24 God is a
[1:05:55] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:05:56] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[1:06:00] John 6 63 he would say it is the spirit
[1:06:02] that quickeneth the flesh profit of
[1:06:04] nothing but the words that I speak
[1:06:08] they are spirit and they are alive
[1:06:11] because God has an order
[1:06:14] God has a pattern he has a way that he
[1:06:16] unfolds himself he has channels and
[1:06:19] offices and times and seasons
[1:06:22] so something could be right you could
[1:06:25] even have the right Revelation or
[1:06:27] inspiration but if it's not in the right
[1:06:28] season or the right place or the right
[1:06:30] person you can be dead wrong
[1:06:32] because God has a pattern and so that
[1:06:35] something that set forth in creation as
[1:06:37] you see the word as it's even written
[1:06:40] there it's because God has a pattern or
[1:06:43] a way that he unfolds himself
[1:06:47] that's what the prophet would be able to
[1:06:48] pick that up and and explain things that
[1:06:51] no man would ever be able to go in and
[1:06:53] be able to go before Genesis 1 1.
[1:06:56] because it was the mind of God coming to
[1:06:59] the bride to reveal the hidden things to
[1:07:01] reveal the secret things to you and you
[1:07:04] we we have to realize I think one of the
[1:07:06] challenges if we're not careful and it's
[1:07:09] just man it's something that's in us and
[1:07:12] I believe it's part of something that we
[1:07:13] we must always overcome and be extremely
[1:07:15] sensitive to but we're always wanting to
[1:07:18] eliminate the paradox
[1:07:19] we're always wanting to take the
[1:07:22] supernatural out of the equation and be
[1:07:24] able to do the simple math and say well
[1:07:26] this is why
[1:07:28] but then then faith is not required
[1:07:32] because faith has to be a part of the
[1:07:34] equation so there's many things uh that
[1:07:37] that are in the word and if you keep
[1:07:40] trying to tackle down a line to go down
[1:07:43] a line and trying to make everything
[1:07:45] make sense you'll drive yourself crazy
[1:07:47] and the and the prophet of God even told
[1:07:49] ministers he said you mustn't do that
[1:07:51] you you will have a mental breakdown if
[1:07:54] you keep trying to just uh make sense
[1:07:56] out of everything and you study too much
[1:07:58] and you just study study study he said
[1:08:00] that can actually have a negative effect
[1:08:02] on you we never want to try to eliminate
[1:08:04] the Paradox we want to believe it by
[1:08:06] faith and then pray for Revelation by
[1:08:09] the spirit because if you ever come to a
[1:08:11] conclusion intellectually then it can be
[1:08:14] intellectually taken away from you but
[1:08:16] when it's revealed to you by the spirit
[1:08:19] of God then heavens and earth will pass
[1:08:21] away but that Revelation Hallelujah that
[1:08:25] Revelation that has been opened up to
[1:08:27] you is something that will never pass
[1:08:29] away it doesn't matter what happens in
[1:08:31] your life it doesn't matter if you go by
[1:08:33] the way of the Grave because that
[1:08:35] Revelation is something that's internal
[1:08:37] it's in your DNA and it must come up on
[1:08:39] that day of the Resurrection because the
[1:08:41] Revelation is the very revelation of the
[1:08:44] person of Christ and who he is
[1:08:47] he's wanting to express himself in you
[1:08:51] so we look into the scriptures God has
[1:08:53] orders and patterns and you know we
[1:08:55] we've dealt many times on the subjects
[1:08:58] where the rain falls on the just and the
[1:08:59] unjust
[1:09:02] but what makes the difference what makes
[1:09:04] the just just in the unjust unjust
[1:09:08] the rain's not the problem
[1:09:11] I like the rain
[1:09:14] I enjoy the rain it brings forth life
[1:09:16] the prophet of God said the rain was for
[1:09:19] the wheat
[1:09:22] but you see in that field
[1:09:25] there were some cocoa barrels and you
[1:09:27] know it's I I just hate weeds
[1:09:29] with a Godly hate
[1:09:33] but I don't know what it is about them
[1:09:35] guys but they can just have I mean they
[1:09:38] don't need any fertilizer
[1:09:40] they don't they just they just need a
[1:09:42] little drop of water and actually
[1:09:45] Hallelujah here I am
[1:09:49] and they're like you think there's just
[1:09:51] one of us just watch out
[1:09:53] it's Clover weed season
[1:09:56] you go out in your yard and you're like
[1:09:59] what is that it's like we are called
[1:10:01] crabgrass and we come to take over like
[1:10:03] I've been spending all this money on my
[1:10:05] yard I've been watering and weed feeding
[1:10:07] everything where did you come from
[1:10:09] because in that field there's also tears
[1:10:16] but the rain you don't when you when you
[1:10:19] water your lawn guess what you're doing
[1:10:22] you're watering the weeds
[1:10:27] do you just tear up your sometimes you
[1:10:29] do
[1:10:32] but we gotta we gotta follow the pattern
[1:10:34] in the scripture
[1:10:36] right
[1:10:38] if we get carnal you got the bulldozer
[1:10:41] out there
[1:10:42] you're like dude why do you have a
[1:10:43] parking lot in the backyard there ain't
[1:10:44] going to be one more weed in my backyard
[1:10:46] it's all concrete We're Playing
[1:10:48] Basketball you don't even play
[1:10:49] basketball
[1:10:51] as long as there ain't no weeds and
[1:10:52] guess what give it a little time their
[1:10:54] weeds will be growing in cracks in your
[1:10:56] concrete
[1:10:59] but see there's a pattern what did he
[1:11:01] say let him grow up together
[1:11:03] don't try to pull them all out there's
[1:11:06] coming forth a harvest rain and in the
[1:11:08] right season in the right time I'll send
[1:11:11] my angels and I'll bind them all
[1:11:13] together so allow the scriptural pattern
[1:11:16] to unfold I have a way of doing things
[1:11:18] as the word would say the rain falls on
[1:11:21] the just and the unjust we'll have false
[1:11:24] tries to raise up false anointed ones we
[1:11:27] will be Anointed with the real Holy
[1:11:29] Ghost but what makes them unjust
[1:11:33] there's nothing in them to Quicken
[1:11:35] they can never stay true to the word
[1:11:38] now that's a pattern
[1:11:42] they can't do it
[1:11:44] and I'm thankful it's set up that way
[1:11:46] because the prophet told us they will
[1:11:48] always deviate from the word
[1:11:52] now that's the saith the Lord
[1:11:56] so something about that unjust or that
[1:11:59] false seed will always deviate from the
[1:12:02] word and Joel 2 28 what did he say I
[1:12:04] will pour out my spirit upon
[1:12:06] All Flesh so then you start to
[1:12:10] understand he didn't say I will pour out
[1:12:12] my spirit upon only the elect I will
[1:12:15] pour out my spirit upon only my sons and
[1:12:18] my daughters no he said I will pour out
[1:12:20] my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:12:24] you know I just fellowship and not long
[1:12:26] ago with my brother David and he made a
[1:12:28] wonderful statement you know the
[1:12:30] scripture says do good to those that
[1:12:31] despitefully use you
[1:12:33] and you want to know why people in
[1:12:35] denominational systems are blessed and
[1:12:37] they put together these rock and roll
[1:12:39] songs and they sing praises to the Lord
[1:12:42] and and they have their little lodges
[1:12:44] that they go to and they are blessed you
[1:12:46] want to know who they're blessed by
[1:12:47] they're blessed by the Lord because he
[1:12:49] does good to those that despitefully use
[1:12:52] him they will use his name because they
[1:12:55] just want to take away their reproach
[1:12:57] they want to be just like Isaiah 4 they
[1:13:00] want to dress any way they want to dress
[1:13:01] they want to act any way they want they
[1:13:04] want to say give us our own bread we'll
[1:13:06] have our own doctrines we'll have our
[1:13:08] own uh uh uh uh ways about believing the
[1:13:11] word the only thing we want to do Lord
[1:13:13] Jesus is be called by your name
[1:13:16] Lord You're so far off also wonder
[1:13:19] you're such a a good God I was so lost
[1:13:22] and now you came and I am saved and I am
[1:13:24] blessed and
[1:13:26] keep drinking up that milk
[1:13:30] but let the rough get going
[1:13:32] because strong meat don't don't let that
[1:13:35] be
[1:13:36] something like
[1:13:39] a doctrinal something out in the way of
[1:13:43] Yonder that you're forever striving to
[1:13:46] get to
[1:13:48] but I believe part of the strong me part
[1:13:50] of being full age is being settled
[1:13:55] being in your position
[1:13:57] knowing what God where God has placed
[1:14:00] you and what you've been called for
[1:14:02] and that you're not so easily shaken and
[1:14:05] that situations can happen in the church
[1:14:07] or in the family and at work and you're
[1:14:10] not on edge you're not nervous you're
[1:14:12] not anxious because the scripture says
[1:14:14] be anxious for nothing and you're able
[1:14:17] to sit back and look to the Lord and say
[1:14:18] Lord what would you have me to do I
[1:14:20] believe that's strong meat
[1:14:23] when you're settled and you're not so
[1:14:25] easily moved and you're completely
[1:14:27] trusting upon the Lord and God has a
[1:14:30] pattern as we just move down this line
[1:14:31] as first John 4 1 will say believe not
[1:14:34] every Spirit but try the spirits
[1:14:36] whether they are of God because many
[1:14:38] false prophets are gone out into the
[1:14:40] world
[1:14:46] brother Branham says here in the
[1:14:48] pergamian church age
[1:14:50] but what we have in this day
[1:14:53] multitudes are working signs until we
[1:14:55] have a generation of sign Seekers
[1:14:58] that know little
[1:14:59] or nothing about the word
[1:15:03] or a true move of the spirit of God
[1:15:08] if they see blood oil or fire
[1:15:11] they are happy it matters not what is in
[1:15:15] the word
[1:15:17] so once again we're we're wanting to
[1:15:19] look what makes the difference
[1:15:21] the word
[1:15:23] it's the word that makes the difference
[1:15:25] a true move of the spirit of God will be
[1:15:29] by the word of God
[1:15:32] but a false move
[1:15:35] or just an outpouring upon All Flesh
[1:15:38] can be something that's mixed and
[1:15:40] mingled but it's it's it deviates from
[1:15:42] the word of God and from that moving you
[1:15:45] get a mixed bag of fruit
[1:15:49] now I just love God in his grace there's
[1:15:51] many and I'm sure there's many sitting
[1:15:53] here that could testify of being out in
[1:15:54] denomination and being in a service and
[1:15:57] God will speak to you where you're at
[1:16:01] and he'll start to grow that seed that
[1:16:03] seed will start to Spring forth in life
[1:16:05] but you because of God's scriptural
[1:16:07] pattern you can only go so far in that
[1:16:10] you'll come to a place that you cannot
[1:16:13] progress any further because you've got
[1:16:14] to come out of the condition you're in
[1:16:16] to go any higher because if it's not the
[1:16:19] fullness of the word then it can never
[1:16:21] produce the full seed or the full wheat
[1:16:23] plant you have to come out of that you
[1:16:26] have to come to the full word so the
[1:16:28] full word could be born in you he says
[1:16:30] but a true move of the spirit but God
[1:16:33] has warned us about that he said in
[1:16:36] Matthew 24 that in the last days the two
[1:16:38] Spirits would be so close together that
[1:16:40] only the very elect could tell them
[1:16:43] apart
[1:16:45] for they alone would not be deceived how
[1:16:49] can you tell the spirits apart
[1:16:53] give them the word test
[1:16:56] if they don't speak that word
[1:17:00] they are of the evil one
[1:17:03] so if you have questions about something
[1:17:06] that's going on and you you see some
[1:17:08] things going on and you you have a
[1:17:10] question about well is God in that is
[1:17:12] that really uh is that really of the
[1:17:14] Lord then just give it the word test
[1:17:17] and don't take hearsay for it get around
[1:17:19] and give them the word test and if they
[1:17:22] come back to you the individual comes
[1:17:24] back to you and everything is saying
[1:17:26] Amen to the word
[1:17:28] then you can say well praise God that's
[1:17:30] a true move of the spirit because if it
[1:17:33] wasn't a true move of the spirit it
[1:17:35] would be void of the word
[1:17:38] that's what I want to see I just want to
[1:17:40] see the word
[1:17:42] because if the word is there
[1:17:45] now we will move a little bit further I
[1:17:47] need to move a little further we'll just
[1:17:48] keep going because we'll get right to
[1:17:49] where I'm going
[1:17:50] and and we'll we'll uh turn some of
[1:17:53] those gazes into amens
[1:17:59] a generation of sign Seekers
[1:18:02] that know little or nothing about the
[1:18:04] word I say oh God don't let me be that
[1:18:09] well I'll say this the little I do know
[1:18:12] of the word let it be a revelation
[1:18:14] Let It Be substance Let It Be substance
[1:18:17] Faith Lord
[1:18:19] and that's what he's saying don't don't
[1:18:20] let the devil twist that on you
[1:18:22] they know little or nothing about God
[1:18:24] and the revelation of the person of who
[1:18:26] he is
[1:18:28] because remember he said you got the
[1:18:30] church
[1:18:31] Spirit and the church people but you
[1:18:33] have the bride Spirit and the bride
[1:18:34] people
[1:18:36] there's a lot of people that got a
[1:18:37] church spirit and they will out Church
[1:18:39] you man
[1:18:42] they will out Church you
[1:18:45] you won't be able to outchurch them
[1:18:48] but we're not called to out church the
[1:18:51] church spirit
[1:18:52] we're not called to build bigger
[1:18:53] buildings and have bigger hoop laws and
[1:18:55] and all of these things were called to
[1:18:57] be what God made us a humble a a a a a
[1:19:01] called out elect group that bears the
[1:19:04] reproach of Jesus Christ that searches
[1:19:07] for lost souls that are of the Kingdom
[1:19:10] bearing the reproach going about seeking
[1:19:13] who we can save
[1:19:16] not not a big program of something we
[1:19:18] can do on some big stage
[1:19:21] but an individual personal work of
[1:19:24] Christ in you in in the area or in the
[1:19:28] life where he placed you
[1:19:31] every one of you in here has a Ministry
[1:19:34] and you have a field to harvest
[1:19:38] and you have a responsibility to that
[1:19:43] so
[1:19:45] I just want to say that
[1:19:47] as we look at
[1:19:49] this generation of sign Seekers and
[1:19:52] things you know we it's easy to look
[1:19:53] back into maybe the days of brother
[1:19:55] Branham and how he came to the
[1:19:57] Pentecostals and he would he would call
[1:19:59] the restoration of the gifts that he
[1:20:01] would end up calling that like the
[1:20:02] Pentecostal age and it was from that age
[1:20:04] which was the age of the shut that that
[1:20:07] that full word that was born in the
[1:20:08] manifestation of the age they rejected
[1:20:10] it they excommunicated it out of the age
[1:20:12] so then Christ was on the outside of the
[1:20:15] church and he was saying come out of her
[1:20:17] my people and be not a partaker of her
[1:20:19] plagues but you know Spirits don't die
[1:20:21] that those Spirits are coming and trying
[1:20:24] to tempt the very bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:26] and offer things to you to try to tempt
[1:20:29] you and to deceive you in the prophet of
[1:20:31] God would say oh yes this false spirit
[1:20:33] in the last days is so close to the real
[1:20:36] it can be distinguished only by its
[1:20:39] deviation from the word so Spirits don't
[1:20:42] die Satan don't care how much you shout
[1:20:44] how much you dance how much you get loud
[1:20:46] all the weeds do it too they're the
[1:20:49] first ones to say Amen they're the first
[1:20:51] ones to dance and Shout they're the
[1:20:53] first ones to run around the building so
[1:20:55] that has nothing to do it but if your
[1:20:57] life is deviating from the word the
[1:20:59] devil don't care how Victorious you are
[1:21:02] in church he doesn't care how Victorious
[1:21:03] you are in Camp but if when you're out
[1:21:05] there on the job site and you and you
[1:21:08] and you can't express the life of Jesus
[1:21:10] Christ and you keep failing and you keep
[1:21:12] the guys keep calling it around the
[1:21:14] water bucket and they keep using the
[1:21:16] lord's name in vain and they keep
[1:21:17] telling dirty jokes and you just kind of
[1:21:20] sit around there and chuckle at it no
[1:21:22] you are Duty bound to stand up for you
[1:21:24] who are as it was brought to our
[1:21:26] attention don't you realize this whole
[1:21:28] age
[1:21:28] is designed with a Target on your back
[1:21:31] to take you down
[1:21:35] see you saw you you start to allow the
[1:21:38] devil to make you think you're some
[1:21:39] little insignificant
[1:21:42] then you start to belittle your job
[1:21:45] you start to belittle your attention
[1:21:47] it's just little on me going to the
[1:21:50] store
[1:21:52] man they probably have a they probably
[1:21:53] have a pepper rally down in hell all
[1:21:56] right everybody gather up
[1:21:59] one of the young people's going to the
[1:22:00] mall again what are we gonna do
[1:22:02] come on we can get him this time well
[1:22:05] you know boss last time last time I I do
[1:22:07] I I I I I I I I I tried to get together
[1:22:10] every sexy dressed demon in the in the
[1:22:13] city and send them in there and running
[1:22:14] by him and he didn't even turn his head
[1:22:17] well let's try something else let's try
[1:22:19] to get get him flustered let's try to
[1:22:21] get him distracted
[1:22:23] why don't we try to get him in a wreck
[1:22:25] or cut him off before he even gets there
[1:22:27] and then you get in the mall and you're
[1:22:29] all flustered and you're all frustrated
[1:22:31] and you're off your game and all sudden
[1:22:32] you start looking at something uh you
[1:22:34] don't think the devil look he's after
[1:22:37] you
[1:22:39] he knows that if he can slow you down
[1:22:42] he's buying more time
[1:22:45] because when you catch a revelation
[1:22:48] of Who You Are
[1:22:50] and the two spirits that are warned or
[1:22:52] the one Spirit but the two spirits in
[1:22:54] the church one of them that is warring
[1:22:56] against you
[1:22:58] trying to take you down
[1:23:00] and to realize that he's after you
[1:23:04] I ain't trying to put you into fear
[1:23:07] what did the prophet say you gotta
[1:23:09] recognize the devil real
[1:23:14] but then when you recognize them real
[1:23:17] do you recognize that greater is he that
[1:23:19] is in me than he that is in the world so
[1:23:23] you don't get knocked off your game when
[1:23:25] that person Cuts in front of you say oh
[1:23:27] God bless you they must be in a hurry
[1:23:29] I hope everything's that okay out there
[1:23:31] work I try to do that
[1:23:35] you know and then and then we're not
[1:23:37] careful you know you go you take the one
[1:23:39] lane off all the way up
[1:23:41] all the way up and you get in there and
[1:23:44] you're like oh I'm sorry guy back there
[1:23:45] you get down the road and all sometimes
[1:23:47] it comes up and cuts you up like hey
[1:23:48] come on man
[1:23:50] you hypocrite
[1:23:56] oh yeah this is where God Wants to Rule
[1:24:00] and reign
[1:24:02] everybody can be a Christian on Sunday
[1:24:05] morning
[1:24:08] but what about in your car
[1:24:11] in your quiet time
[1:24:14] when it's just you and
[1:24:16] who
[1:24:19] depends on who you invite
[1:24:21] depends on what kind of atmosphere
[1:24:25] and I I have been so convicted
[1:24:29] to think that there's things I've done
[1:24:31] with my Lord Jesus sitting right next to
[1:24:32] me
[1:24:34] and then you start to think
[1:24:36] would I do that
[1:24:38] if the Lord was sitting next to me
[1:24:43] well come on
[1:24:45] do we believe the very basics
[1:24:49] that we've been taught by our Lord
[1:24:51] that I am with you
[1:24:53] the Kingdom of Heaven is within you
[1:24:57] we lack revelation
[1:25:01] I lack revelation
[1:25:03] because there's many times throughout my
[1:25:06] day
[1:25:08] if his person was visible there
[1:25:13] it's because my lacking
[1:25:15] that I'm not keeping him in the
[1:25:16] Forefront Lord thou art with me Lord
[1:25:19] what would you have me to do greater is
[1:25:22] he that is in me Lord that person's in
[1:25:24] need they did this they did that because
[1:25:26] Jesus there was a pattern Jesus was
[1:25:29] always going somewhere with purpose
[1:25:33] he was always doing what God showed him
[1:25:35] to do
[1:25:37] and so we want to have that kind of
[1:25:38] purpose we want to follow that pattern
[1:25:40] that's been set for us
[1:25:47] and just speaking about patterns and you
[1:25:49] know we made that
[1:25:51] we read that quote about the the rain
[1:25:53] falling on the just and the unjust and
[1:25:55] the spirits uh working within the church
[1:25:58] and and how God has a pattern and
[1:26:02] what I was wanting to move towards is
[1:26:04] God has a way of doing things because
[1:26:06] when you start to look into the Bible
[1:26:08] and the prophet of God would take time
[1:26:10] to explain this when he talks about the
[1:26:12] uh the King David where King David got a
[1:26:15] revelation to bring the ark back to the
[1:26:18] city
[1:26:19] and there it's not that the Revelation
[1:26:22] was wrong the Revelation was right but
[1:26:26] what David failed to do is David didn't
[1:26:28] go through the right Channel and so when
[1:26:31] you start to look at things what we're
[1:26:32] talking about is there can be the
[1:26:34] Revelation can be right it can be it can
[1:26:37] be the right word but there has to be a
[1:26:39] time there has to be a season and there
[1:26:41] has to be the right channel for it and
[1:26:44] David what did he do he went ahead and
[1:26:46] he consulted his friends and he
[1:26:49] consulted the congregation but he didn't
[1:26:51] consult the prophet that was there
[1:26:54] concerning the desire or the Revelation
[1:26:57] that he had and I want to tell you
[1:26:58] that's where a lot of ministers and
[1:27:00] that's where a lot of people get
[1:27:01] themselves in a lot of trouble is
[1:27:03] because they get a revelation they get
[1:27:06] an inspiration and they run out on that
[1:27:08] Revelation and so much of it being right
[1:27:10] but when they don't consult the Holy
[1:27:12] Spirit they don't consult the prophet of
[1:27:14] God and run that back through the
[1:27:16] message they'll get themselves on a limb
[1:27:19] somewhere they shouldn't be and if they
[1:27:21] would have just consulted the message of
[1:27:23] the hour it would have protected him
[1:27:24] from making the air
[1:27:27] and I've watched Men catch a revelation
[1:27:31] but if in that revelation
[1:27:34] there's a partial a lack of
[1:27:37] understanding or or it's 99 right
[1:27:41] if you run off on that eventually you
[1:27:44] run back into another word that's
[1:27:46] contrary because the word always
[1:27:49] corrects the air
[1:27:51] and men will be bound by pride and I've
[1:27:54] watched them the word come in to correct
[1:27:57] the air and they will explain away the
[1:28:01] word that's there to correct the air
[1:28:03] because they don't want to Humble
[1:28:05] themselves to the word of God oh friends
[1:28:08] we gotta humble ourselves to the word of
[1:28:10] God lord if I'm wrong I'm wrong forgive
[1:28:13] me I don't want to be wrong or correct
[1:28:15] me send your spirit move upon my life
[1:28:18] let me look into the bible let me look
[1:28:20] into the message Lord give me a
[1:28:22] revelation because if I'm wrong Lord I
[1:28:24] know that you can correct me because
[1:28:27] those that I love I rebuke and chasten
[1:28:30] but David didn't consult the prophet
[1:28:34] so what did he do he went ahead and he
[1:28:36] started to have himself a Revival
[1:28:40] look into your Bible he got all the
[1:28:42] musicians there he set it all up and
[1:28:45] they all started to come in they were
[1:28:47] bringing the Ark of God home but what
[1:28:50] happened because he never consulted the
[1:28:52] messenger because he never consulted the
[1:28:55] prophet David was going through the
[1:28:57] wrong Channel it was the wrong time and
[1:28:59] it was the wrong season and the prophet
[1:29:02] of God said they were walking right into
[1:29:04] death
[1:29:06] and the fruits
[1:29:08] of that was that user died
[1:29:12] what did he do he reached out and he
[1:29:14] touched the cart and God smote him dead
[1:29:17] it brought forth death that false
[1:29:19] Revival that David was having it brought
[1:29:22] forth death
[1:29:24] because he didn't go through the right
[1:29:26] Channel
[1:29:27] I got to look into that maybe another
[1:29:29] time I can pick it up but but I was
[1:29:31] really uh uh really enjoying it because
[1:29:34] David named that place pereza
[1:29:37] and pereza means the breach of yuza
[1:29:42] it caused a breach so it went into a
[1:29:45] season it wasn't the time for the word
[1:29:48] to be restored back to the city
[1:29:51] but then there came a time after the
[1:29:53] breach
[1:29:55] there came a time after the breach when
[1:29:57] it came time for the word to be restored
[1:29:59] and I started to get excited about that
[1:30:01] I started to think look just just in the
[1:30:04] age of Pentecost what was it it was the
[1:30:07] restoration of gifts it was a true move
[1:30:10] of the spirit
[1:30:11] and if they would have waited on their
[1:30:14] Prophet messenger if they would have
[1:30:16] waited for the teaching Reign because
[1:30:19] all of them were hungering and they were
[1:30:22] thirsting they were crying out to God
[1:30:24] for a Revival and God by Divine promise
[1:30:27] the mechanics of Joel 2 28 he poured out
[1:30:30] a spirit upon them and now there was a
[1:30:33] manifestation of diverse manifestations
[1:30:35] of spirits and all of these things and
[1:30:38] if they if they would have stayed there
[1:30:40] and waited on the leadership of the Lord
[1:30:44] they would have received the prophet
[1:30:46] messenger in the time and season that
[1:30:49] was supposed to bring them into the full
[1:30:51] restoration of the word but what they
[1:30:54] thought in their spirit this must be it
[1:30:57] look at everything that's happening
[1:30:58] we're screaming we're shouting we're
[1:31:00] dancing we're speaking in tongues this
[1:31:03] is that restoration that was promised to
[1:31:05] come and they living in that age of man
[1:31:08] and that intellect they started to make
[1:31:10] dogmas and Creeds and were they little
[1:31:12] did they know they were walking right
[1:31:15] into death what did the prophet of God
[1:31:16] said he said tongues was a sign of death
[1:31:19] but they didn't wait
[1:31:22] if they would have waited on the
[1:31:24] teaching rain
[1:31:26] if they would have waited for the
[1:31:28] prophet Messenger to properly place them
[1:31:31] if they would have consulted the
[1:31:33] messenger of the age and not gotten
[1:31:35] ahead of God's program they would have
[1:31:38] come to the fullness of the word but
[1:31:40] they denominated and they died
[1:31:44] but what came a breach
[1:31:47] Hallelujah and then the messenger of the
[1:31:50] age that came with that teaching reign
[1:31:54] right the former in the latter rain you
[1:31:56] had you had to have the former Aid and
[1:31:58] the prophet of God taught how could you
[1:31:59] even have the latter rain when the
[1:32:01] former rain hadn't even come
[1:32:04] the former and the teaching Reign had to
[1:32:06] come what is the teachers right it's a
[1:32:08] sowing
[1:32:09] it's a sowing of seed
[1:32:13] well it's not just a sowing of seed in
[1:32:16] 1963 it's not just a sowing of seed in
[1:32:19] the 50s it's not just a sowing of it's a
[1:32:22] sowing of seed when were you born when
[1:32:23] were you born it's a sign of seed for
[1:32:25] your time and your season it was the
[1:32:28] word of God being sown into the age that
[1:32:31] that spoken word in the time of season
[1:32:33] that Harvest rain Hallelujah the Harvest
[1:32:36] rain the message of the hour Christ the
[1:32:38] word what came after the breach
[1:32:42] the Harvest rain
[1:32:46] to bring forth the life
[1:32:48] what did he say it's literally these
[1:32:51] Divine mystery truths that restore the
[1:32:53] heart back to the original Faith so it
[1:32:57] was after the breach all the age before
[1:32:59] brought for death and chaos but then
[1:33:02] there came a season of preach that
[1:33:04] Malachi 4 5 and Luke 17 30 that the veil
[1:33:07] was pulled away what was it it was
[1:33:09] Christ coming down with an open book it
[1:33:12] was the Harvest rain to bring forth the
[1:33:14] seed word that had been sown
[1:33:16] Hallelujah
[1:33:20] Oh Glory to God because God has a
[1:33:23] channel
[1:33:25] I don't do anything but what I reveal my
[1:33:28] secrets to my servants the prophet
[1:33:31] so just as David who was anointed
[1:33:34] he didn't consult the prophet just as in
[1:33:37] the age of Pentecost they were anointed
[1:33:39] but they didn't consult the prophet
[1:33:42] Spirits don't die
[1:33:44] Satan will try to get you so anointed
[1:33:47] you'll try to get you so worked up he'll
[1:33:49] try to get you so enthused you'll catch
[1:33:52] a hold of something but if you're not
[1:33:54] careful look that's why God has given
[1:33:56] you a pastor if you need if you need to
[1:33:58] counsel if you need to talk to him you
[1:34:01] can approach him as you're approaching
[1:34:02] God
[1:34:04] but if you're going to approach him like
[1:34:05] he's approaching God quit being carnal
[1:34:08] and approach your pastor and tell your
[1:34:11] pastor what you're going to do
[1:34:13] and tell him and you're just looking for
[1:34:15] him to justify what you've already made
[1:34:18] up in your heart to do it'll never work
[1:34:22] and so many times the only reason you're
[1:34:26] talking to your pastor is because you
[1:34:28] want to do something you know you don't
[1:34:30] she shouldn't be doing
[1:34:32] because you as a son and daughter of God
[1:34:35] have access to the throne
[1:34:37] you have access to the Holy Spirit to
[1:34:40] get on your knees and seek God and say
[1:34:43] Lord I need a revelation
[1:34:45] I need an answer but because you're
[1:34:47] unsettled because you don't have peace
[1:34:49] in your spirit you go to your pastor
[1:34:51] looking to justify the decision when you
[1:34:54] just need to repent and say Lord I'm
[1:34:56] sorry I'll wait on you
[1:34:58] well that's fresh so you might as well
[1:35:01] eat it up
[1:35:04] we're talking about people of full age
[1:35:09] full age
[1:35:11] the Bride of Jesus Christ an invincible
[1:35:14] Army
[1:35:15] and if you truly are torn and you have a
[1:35:17] question I promise you you can say I'm
[1:35:21] approaching my pastor
[1:35:23] like I'm approaching God
[1:35:26] and you come in there and you lay it
[1:35:28] down before
[1:35:30] and you say just tell me
[1:35:32] I need to know
[1:35:35] I don't care if what he tells you is
[1:35:37] wrong
[1:35:39] God will not hold you accountable
[1:35:42] I believe that with all my heart because
[1:35:45] you didn't approach a man you approached
[1:35:47] God
[1:35:49] see God has offices and channels and we
[1:35:51] have to have the right reverence we have
[1:35:53] to have the right respect we have to
[1:35:55] have the right reproach because if not
[1:35:57] what are we even do in church are we
[1:35:59] just playing games are we running some
[1:36:01] big Corporation and we got the president
[1:36:02] of the company and we got the CEO and we
[1:36:05] got all this and I'm just trying to work
[1:36:07] my way up the ladder so I can get my two
[1:36:09] cents in
[1:36:10] no my headquarters was Heaven
[1:36:15] Jesus Christ is the Great Captain
[1:36:18] and he set an order in the church
[1:36:21] and if we'll be faithful to that order
[1:36:23] God will bless us he'll lead us and
[1:36:25] he'll guide us
[1:36:28] see the order David had to go through
[1:36:30] was the prophet
[1:36:32] now look at Elijah one day the prophet
[1:36:34] God speaks to Elijah says look I need
[1:36:36] you to go down to zeropath
[1:36:38] I have a widow there that's going to
[1:36:40] sustain you now I find this remarkable
[1:36:42] there's a famine in the land the prophet
[1:36:44] of God will say this Widow is there a
[1:36:46] path she didn't mix with all the other
[1:36:47] people she wasn't just some
[1:36:48] make-believer but she was set aside she
[1:36:51] was consecrated but now she's in a
[1:36:53] famine right and she is now basically at
[1:36:56] the end of her Road you talk about us a
[1:36:58] bad situation
[1:37:00] I don't know how long the mother
[1:37:03] could stretch out some Mill and oil for
[1:37:06] her baby
[1:37:12] I don't know how many days I don't know
[1:37:14] how bloated the stomach was of that boy
[1:37:17] I don't know how bad the condition was
[1:37:19] but when it got down to the end of the
[1:37:21] road and she said you know what
[1:37:23] I've done all I can do
[1:37:26] I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to mix
[1:37:28] the oil and the meal together
[1:37:31] you see the oil represents the spirit
[1:37:35] the meal represents Christ the word
[1:37:38] she mixed it together but you see even
[1:37:42] though she had mixed it together there
[1:37:43] was one more component she needed
[1:37:47] she could have the spirit
[1:37:49] and because she could have the word but
[1:37:51] there was one more thing she needed
[1:37:53] because without that there was no
[1:37:56] manifestation of the word
[1:37:58] what did she need she needed Elijah
[1:38:02] and there in her time of need she went
[1:38:05] out to that gate to grab them two sticks
[1:38:07] and the Very things you have to eat it
[1:38:09] was standing there at the gate what was
[1:38:11] it it was the prophet It Was Elijah it
[1:38:15] was the one that could set the order for
[1:38:18] the events to take place and bring the
[1:38:20] supernatural
[1:38:23] without Elijah there the spirit of God
[1:38:25] is not moving
[1:38:27] follow me
[1:38:29] she had the oil
[1:38:31] she had the meal
[1:38:33] but she needed the profit
[1:38:36] now watch the order
[1:38:40] I'm about you go get me a drink of water
[1:38:42] I believe he had to come back okay now
[1:38:44] I'm about to go oh give me something to
[1:38:46] eat well I'll get you some water
[1:38:49] we got a little about that around here
[1:38:52] but oh
[1:38:54] well the thing you're requiring of me
[1:38:56] now
[1:38:58] you see I've
[1:39:00] I've been struggling for a long time
[1:39:03] I haven't been mixing down there with
[1:39:05] the denominations and everything and I
[1:39:07] haven't been
[1:39:08] given in to all those things I haven't
[1:39:10] been buying into the mark
[1:39:12] this is all I have and I've gone as as
[1:39:15] far as God's brought me till now and I'm
[1:39:17] gonna go in there
[1:39:19] I'm going to bake a cake for me and my
[1:39:21] son and we're gonna eat it and die
[1:39:25] and what did the prophet tell her
[1:39:28] go and do as you said
[1:39:32] but give me one first
[1:39:35] you see the order
[1:39:38] see we got to give the word preeminence
[1:39:43] so he gave her the promise
[1:39:48] and the crews will not run dry and the
[1:39:50] barrel will not go empty
[1:39:53] but if she would have went in there
[1:39:56] and not had given
[1:39:59] the prophet the first place
[1:40:02] the promise would have never come to
[1:40:04] pass because it wasn't the right order
[1:40:07] so we have all these promises in the
[1:40:09] word we have the Holy Spirit that's been
[1:40:12] promised to the church we have all these
[1:40:14] promises that are laying in there but if
[1:40:15] we don't give the word preeminence then
[1:40:17] we're not going to get the results of
[1:40:19] the word
[1:40:23] and what is Elijah of today
[1:40:26] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:30] that's what Elijah to the bride today is
[1:40:33] it is the Lord Jesus Christ we have to
[1:40:36] give the word the preeminence
[1:40:39] and what happened when she gave
[1:40:42] the word preeminence
[1:40:46] and the spirit of God moved
[1:40:51] and she had what she hadn't eat of oh we
[1:40:53] could just start to run down the Bible
[1:40:55] when Abraham was obedient to the word of
[1:40:58] God he took Isaac up on that mountain he
[1:41:01] said God is able to give us a sacrifice
[1:41:04] and he raised back that knife and the
[1:41:07] spirit of God moved because he was
[1:41:10] obedient to the word and all of a sudden
[1:41:13] there was a ram caught in the thicket
[1:41:15] you see you have to be obedient to the
[1:41:18] word you got to give the word
[1:41:19] preeminence and then watch the spirit of
[1:41:22] God move on the scene
[1:41:24] so we're talking about a true move of
[1:41:26] the spirit of God according to the word
[1:41:28] and the word alone
[1:41:32] that can't be right
[1:41:35] praise His wonderful name
[1:41:43] who Lord help me
[1:41:52] we'll just try to be a few more moments
[1:41:54] so just drawing back to our
[1:41:57] text where we were
[1:42:00] in the beginning
[1:42:02] in the beginning so we mentioned those
[1:42:05] scriptures Genesis 1 1-3 and and John 1
[1:42:09] 1 all of these things and the prophet
[1:42:11] would help us understand this so much
[1:42:13] better you know in the beginning was
[1:42:14] Elohim the self-existing one and he
[1:42:16] would say there I see I see the words
[1:42:19] those thoughts of gods now forming into
[1:42:21] the logos and and like a little one
[1:42:23] playing before the father what is this
[1:42:25] this is an order and a pattern of God
[1:42:28] God forming himself into the logos which
[1:42:31] was Christ the word and then the word
[1:42:33] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what
[1:42:36] was it it was God unfolding himself down
[1:42:39] to human beings
[1:42:41] that's always been his plan that's
[1:42:43] always been his pattern
[1:42:44] if you look at his pattern from the very
[1:42:46] beginning the prophet of God would say
[1:42:48] he was God the logos the word that went
[1:42:52] out of God when it began to brood upon
[1:42:54] the Earth and it brought forth marine
[1:42:56] life when the spirit of God the logos
[1:42:58] the word which God said let there be and
[1:43:00] they're with the logos which was the
[1:43:02] word and the word because all this was
[1:43:05] in the logos
[1:43:07] the whole word of God the whole Bible
[1:43:09] for every age and as the logos begin to
[1:43:12] breathe upon the Earth there come marine
[1:43:14] life and a building up and bird life on
[1:43:17] onto animal life and finally there comes
[1:43:19] something in the representation
[1:43:21] representation or looked like the thing
[1:43:24] that was brooding over it
[1:43:26] God
[1:43:27] a man in the very image of God
[1:43:31] I'm just going to ask the musicians to
[1:43:32] stand to come and because we will um
[1:43:36] not turn this corner would be here a
[1:43:38] while
[1:43:39] but I just want to maybe just
[1:43:42] maybe if we can pick this up at another
[1:43:44] time
[1:43:45] but even there God wasn't done unfolding
[1:43:48] himself
[1:43:49] there was a part of Adam
[1:43:52] that needed to become flesh
[1:43:54] there was something in Adam and if I
[1:43:56] could say like that there was a
[1:43:58] revelation inside of Adam
[1:44:00] that still had to come into
[1:44:02] manifestation
[1:44:04] and be expressed
[1:44:06] the prophet of God would say this in
[1:44:07] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:44:09] would say and when the word is revealed
[1:44:11] it expresses itself
[1:44:14] that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ
[1:44:16] was to express himself
[1:44:21] so I just want to maybe end along these
[1:44:23] lines just as you see on on on the Earth
[1:44:27] here this Earth was in this great chaos
[1:44:30] it was in this great condition it was
[1:44:33] this wandering star it seemed like it
[1:44:36] didn't even know where it was going and
[1:44:37] there was this great Chaos on it and
[1:44:39] what does the scripture say it says and
[1:44:41] the spirit of God moved
[1:44:45] well don't you realize that's exactly
[1:44:47] how you showed up in this world
[1:44:49] you showed up as a Wandering Star
[1:44:52] wondering oh where did I come from where
[1:44:55] am I going you showed up in the most
[1:44:57] wicked age an age that's designed to
[1:45:00] frustrate you and make you pull your
[1:45:02] hair out and make you wish you were
[1:45:04] never here I mean look you wonder why
[1:45:06] the news is filled with all of the
[1:45:08] things that's filled with is it's
[1:45:09] complete Insanity I believe the prophet
[1:45:12] of God said in 1963 said if this
[1:45:14] continues another 50 Years it'll be
[1:45:17] complete Insanity we're here
[1:45:20] and we're 10 15 years past complete
[1:45:23] Insanity y'all are witnessing uh it's
[1:45:27] not even my it's just be a lot of Beast
[1:45:29] out there I mean just there's they are
[1:45:32] even lacking the basic principle
[1:45:33] fundamentals of what it means to be a
[1:45:35] human being they have no common sense
[1:45:37] that they have been grabbed by a monster
[1:45:40] Darkness has totally overtake them and
[1:45:43] and and and God called you to be here he
[1:45:46] called you young people he had spoke a
[1:45:49] word and he wanted you to be the ones to
[1:45:51] be in to to express his very image in
[1:45:54] this day
[1:45:55] now you would be the ones to stand up
[1:45:57] against social media that you would be
[1:45:59] the ones to stand up against fashion
[1:46:01] that you would be the ones to be a
[1:46:02] lighthouse and testify of the truth in
[1:46:05] this dark generation
[1:46:07] yeah you showed up in this like a
[1:46:09] Wandering Star
[1:46:11] but what happened all of a sudden and
[1:46:14] the spirit of God moved
[1:46:16] what was it it was a deep calling to a
[1:46:18] deep
[1:46:19] and God said let there be and something
[1:46:22] started to transform in your heart and
[1:46:24] in your life
[1:46:28] because you're right where God placed
[1:46:30] you
[1:46:31] we're talking about an order we're
[1:46:33] talking about a pattern
[1:46:34] and you're right on time
[1:46:37] you're right in the season that you're
[1:46:38] called to be in
[1:46:40] you sometimes wonder well why
[1:46:43] me why am I going through this what the
[1:46:45] prophet said the test is the greatest
[1:46:47] thing that ever happened to you
[1:46:49] now we're trying to tie something
[1:46:50] together before we end just to
[1:46:53] not leave it hanging too too much apart
[1:46:56] strong meat
[1:46:58] strong meat belongs to them at our full
[1:47:00] age
[1:47:01] that you your senses either exercise to
[1:47:05] discern between right and wrong and Good
[1:47:06] and Evil
[1:47:08] and when you can look at the test
[1:47:13] and be mature enough to say this is
[1:47:16] the greatest thing
[1:47:18] that ever happened to me
[1:47:21] though you slay me Lord
[1:47:25] yet I'll trust you
[1:47:29] that's what he's looking for
[1:47:31] that's the kind of character
[1:47:33] that's the kind of Believers this
[1:47:35] message produces
[1:47:38] you don't need to be pampered and babied
[1:47:41] I know we need encouragement and I love
[1:47:43] encouragement more than anybody
[1:47:45] I need to hear who I am in Christ
[1:47:48] but there's the rugged part of the
[1:47:50] Christian
[1:47:53] that when you're going through the trial
[1:47:54] and you feel all alone
[1:47:57] that there's a christ-like character
[1:47:59] that's being molded in you
[1:48:02] because those that suffer look you
[1:48:04] cannot Reign if you don't suffer
[1:48:07] so then you can look at the trial that's
[1:48:09] what the prophet said you cannot you
[1:48:11] cannot Reign unless you suffer
[1:48:13] so then that's the overcoming to him
[1:48:15] that overcometh will I grant for them to
[1:48:17] sit with me now we're talking about
[1:48:18] being full age embracing the trial and
[1:48:22] saying you know what this temptation
[1:48:24] this sickness if this is what God has
[1:48:27] allowed me to come in contact with just
[1:48:29] as Paul prayed oh God I I beseech you
[1:48:31] Lord of this infirmity take it away from
[1:48:34] you Paul
[1:48:36] Brian my grace is sufficient for you
[1:48:39] just keep going on
[1:48:42] keep going on with God maybe if you know
[1:48:44] that song
[1:48:46] um something keeps holding me
[1:48:50] I like to sing it and be be flat if
[1:48:52] possible
[1:48:55] let's just all stand
[1:48:58] second Timothy says
[1:49:02] for the which cause I also suffer these
[1:49:05] things
[1:49:06] nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know
[1:49:08] whom I have believed
[1:49:10] and then persuaded that he is able to
[1:49:12] keep that which I've committed unto him
[1:49:14] against that day
[1:49:16] yeah that's strong meat that you can
[1:49:18] stand the test
[1:49:21] that you can stand in the face of the
[1:49:22] trial
[1:49:25] what is the new birth
[1:49:28] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:49:31] personally to you
[1:49:35] it has to be the spirit
[1:49:37] and the word
[1:49:39] I was so encouraged
[1:49:43] to hear a testimony
[1:49:45] from one of the young sisters from that
[1:49:47] was at camp
[1:49:49] because
[1:49:52] when it's a revelation to you
[1:49:54] it's not something you have today and
[1:49:56] it's gone tomorrow
[1:49:58] but it becomes the very fabric of Who
[1:50:00] You Are
[1:50:02] and then everything that's not of that
[1:50:05] you just said God take it away from me
[1:50:08] Lord I don't want to have that attitude
[1:50:10] I don't want to have that thought I
[1:50:11] don't want to have that thinking
[1:50:13] Lord help me to be a better husband
[1:50:16] Lord help me to love my wife more help
[1:50:18] me be more like you Lord you said
[1:50:21] husbands love your wife as Christ loved
[1:50:24] the church oh God I'm coming so short if
[1:50:26] you'll help me Lord
[1:50:28] yeah that's strong meat
[1:50:31] so easy to be selfish and look on your
[1:50:33] own need
[1:50:35] but when we really start looking on the
[1:50:37] needs of others and start to Bear their
[1:50:39] cross and start to Bear their burden and
[1:50:41] they know that we are his disciples by
[1:50:44] the love that we show one to another
[1:50:47] it's something that's constant it's
[1:50:49] alive it's not a workup it's not a check
[1:50:52] box well I did I visited that Widow and
[1:50:56] I went to I went to the the hospital and
[1:50:59] I passed out this track and I'm doing a
[1:51:01] good job no it's something that exudes
[1:51:03] out of you
[1:51:04] something that's pushing out of you Lord
[1:51:07] who can I serve today Lord
[1:51:09] who can I pray for today
[1:51:13] something that's
[1:51:14] there to stay it's a revelation
[1:51:17] this sister got up to testify she said
[1:51:21] you know I went to Camp I add a lot of
[1:51:23] fear and the devil was was fighting
[1:51:25] against me and telling me over and over
[1:51:27] and over that I wasn't going to get
[1:51:28] nothing out of the service
[1:51:30] and I had a good service and the devil
[1:51:32] come back and he was right there
[1:51:35] there in my mind you're not going to get
[1:51:36] nothing out of the service
[1:51:39] but I loved her testimony she said I
[1:51:41] went up through the prayer line and I
[1:51:43] went up there with a need upon my heart
[1:51:45] and I said oh Lord speak to me Lord
[1:51:46] speak to me she said something happened
[1:51:48] something took place
[1:51:50] and she said and I can stand before you
[1:51:53] tonight and testify I got more than an
[1:51:55] emotion
[1:51:57] I got power I said Hallelujah there it
[1:52:01] is that's overcoming power when you can
[1:52:04] come back and stand there say I got yeah
[1:52:07] I was excited yeah I streamed yeah I
[1:52:10] shouted but I got something more than a
[1:52:12] shout I got the power of almighty God
[1:52:15] living and reigning in my being
[1:52:18] that's an overcoming Church
[1:52:22] Hallelujah
[1:52:23] are we there
[1:52:30] the trials of this life
[1:52:33] we're getting stronger
[1:52:40] oh I fell was more than I could bear
[1:52:48] and I was on the verge of giving over
[1:52:57] the strength Within Myself just was not
[1:53:02] there
[1:53:05] but something keeps holding me
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:09] every day I see
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:16] to overcome my goodness
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:30] oh he's a reality
[1:53:34] something keeps holy
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:44] his temptation
[1:53:47] foreign
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:54:24] I don't believe
[1:54:27] me I try
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:42] something keeps holding me
[1:54:46] with every headbound as they saw them
[1:54:48] play
[1:54:49] Lord Jesus we're thankful
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:55] that you foresaw us
[1:54:58] before you even form this world
[1:55:01] and that we were in you and written on
[1:55:03] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:55:04] foundation of the world
[1:55:07] Lord that gives us a confidence and a
[1:55:09] courage
[1:55:12] to overcome by your word and this wicked
[1:55:14] and adulterous generation
[1:55:16] where the whole world has forsaken you
[1:55:18] Lord but
[1:55:19] Lord we don't want to forsake you
[1:55:24] we want to have our
[1:55:26] thoughts and our
[1:55:27] Ambitions and all of our hopes and plans
[1:55:30] solely on you and your word and what
[1:55:32] your will would be for our life
[1:55:34] we truly want to be Overcomers Lord
[1:55:38] we know Lord that by your spirit you're
[1:55:40] giving us revelation
[1:55:42] father if we go through the right
[1:55:44] channel in the right order and we feed
[1:55:46] upon this message
[1:55:49] Lord we know that we are the final voice
[1:55:51] to this generation
[1:55:53] but if it's not under the messenger of
[1:55:55] the age Lord then
[1:55:57] it won't accomplish what your will is
[1:55:59] Lord
[1:56:00] we have to come through
[1:56:03] your channel of inspiration Lord and
[1:56:05] stay on track
[1:56:07] so we're so thankful for this message
[1:56:09] Lord we're so thankful for your word
[1:56:12] and we know Lord you've given us your
[1:56:14] holy spirit that we could be Overcomers
[1:56:17] and that we could point back to the word
[1:56:18] and say it is written
[1:56:20] it is written get behind me Satan it is
[1:56:23] written
[1:56:24] and Lord I just want to make an
[1:56:25] invitation to anybody here who's
[1:56:28] suffering or feels they don't have the
[1:56:30] victory
[1:56:32] there's somebody here that wants to be
[1:56:34] born again or receive the Holy Ghost
[1:56:37] Lord I believe it's in atmospheres like
[1:56:39] this where births take place
[1:56:41] for your Prophet taught us it takes
[1:56:43] atmosphere to do things and
[1:56:45] Lord we've sung the songs we've preached
[1:56:47] the word

[1:58:13] and you're welcome to stay in worship
[1:58:14] you are dismissed as Cosmic comes to
[1:58:16] lead us in a few songs
[1:58:20] that moments like these pass you by
[1:58:23] we allow you to be dismissed because
[1:58:24] sometimes there's a nervous energy that
[1:58:26] needs to go
[1:58:28] you be dismissed but if something's
[1:58:31] dealing with you hard you come
[1:58:34] you let God do above and beyond what you
[1:58:36] could even think or ask because he's the
[1:58:39] same yesterday today and forever
[1:58:41] let's just sing that chorus as brother
[1:58:43] cosmon comes
[1:58:46] something keeps holding me

[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:56] die
[1:59:19] thank you
[1:59:22] there's nothing
[1:59:24] please
[1:59:28] we have a testimony so it's always a
[1:59:30] good time to testify we had a little
[1:59:32] break there so go ahead sister and
[1:59:34] testify
[1:59:39] God bless you
[1:59:43] so I went to Louisiana Camp last
[1:59:46] last weekend and
[1:59:48] I truly believe that the Lord did
[1:59:51] something for me
[1:59:52] um
[1:59:56] at first
[1:59:57] um it started um maybe around last year
[2:00:01] July just you know going through battles
[2:00:05] so many mind battles and I just I just
[2:00:07] felt like I'm not gonna make it and then
[2:00:09] I came down here at the altar and um
[2:00:12] brother Matthew and sister Gabrielle
[2:00:13] prayed for me and that day I really
[2:00:16] entered into a trial like I didn't think
[2:00:19] I was gonna make it up but I just kept
[2:00:22] on persevere and I said the Lord would
[2:00:23] bring me out I know different the
[2:00:26] difference that this message makes in
[2:00:28] each and every person so I'm Gonna Keep
[2:00:29] On standing I'm Gonna Keep On standing
[2:00:31] and he kept on getting worse and worse
[2:00:34] and I said I'm Gonna Keep On persevering
[2:00:35] because I know God has something for me
[2:00:38] and the enemy is trying to keep me away
[2:00:39] from it
[2:00:40] and so come January
[2:00:43] um we had a little get-together brother
[2:00:45] Matthew's house
[2:00:46] and you know just in activities and
[2:00:49] fellowship and all that and then brother
[2:00:51] Matthew spoke to us for like 100 or 10
[2:00:53] minutes but I feel like that 10 minutes
[2:00:55] was for me it was exactly what I needed
[2:00:58] for what I was going through so I put
[2:01:01] brother Matthew aside
[2:01:03] and I was just telling him everything
[2:01:04] that I was going through
[2:01:06] and he just began speaking as he was
[2:01:08] speaking you could notice that it was no
[2:01:10] longer him that was speaking it was God
[2:01:14] that was speaking to me and let me know
[2:01:16] that everything's gonna be okay that you
[2:01:19] were predestinated
[2:01:21] before the foundations of the world that
[2:01:23] no matter what the devil throws at you
[2:01:25] as soon as you get that revelation
[2:01:28] of who you are the enemy can stop you
[2:01:31] and I kept on persevering and then I
[2:01:35] listened to a tape by Brother Branham
[2:01:37] and he was talking about persevering and
[2:01:40] then in that sermon he talks about a
[2:01:42] gentle woman
[2:01:43] and he said great is your faith he says
[2:01:46] that thing that you have been
[2:01:47] persevering about
[2:01:49] God has done he's gonna do something for
[2:01:51] you at that point I was so scared to go
[2:01:53] to Louisiana again but I don't know why
[2:01:55] I had this fear
[2:01:57] and I I just put it in the back I was
[2:01:59] like it's okay you know maybe it's just
[2:02:00] not the leader of the Lord to just be
[2:02:01] there and then literally two weeks
[2:02:03] before I'm talking to Ella I'm like hey
[2:02:05] are you going to Camp he's like yeah I'm
[2:02:07] going with my family I'm gonna stay in
[2:02:08] the hotel I was like oh can I come with
[2:02:10] you guys I don't know where I was like
[2:02:12] and then you know
[2:02:14] I didn't actually make my decision until
[2:02:16] the Wednesday before we left for camp
[2:02:18] but I think that's the greatest decision
[2:02:21] I've ever made to just not I'm not gonna
[2:02:24] let that fear hold me that anxiety hold
[2:02:26] me because God did something for me last
[2:02:28] year and he's going to do something for
[2:02:30] me again and then we got there that
[2:02:32] Friday in the afternoon
[2:02:35] and we got there in the middle of the
[2:02:37] skit and I walked in and I started
[2:02:38] shaking that anxious feeling as this is
[2:02:42] going on and I sat there and I said Lord
[2:02:45] you know my heart I prayed this weekend
[2:02:47] to be such a peaceful weekend to give me
[2:02:49] a peace as the person's understanding
[2:02:51] and that anxiety started going away and
[2:02:53] then it would come back you'll go and
[2:02:54] everybody just said Lord please give me
[2:02:56] that peace and that peace did come even
[2:02:59] throughout the weekend I was just in
[2:03:00] prayer just you know meditating in my
[2:03:03] heart that the Lord is going to do
[2:03:04] something for me
[2:03:07] and that Friday night they called
[2:03:09] anybody who wanted the Holy Ghost out he
[2:03:11] knew that I had the Holy Ghost but I
[2:03:13] just needed that refill even just that
[2:03:16] reassurance to know that everything's
[2:03:17] gonna be okay I went to the altar
[2:03:20] obviously like
[2:03:21] no emotion didn't feel anything but I
[2:03:23] just said the Lord is still gonna do
[2:03:25] something just because I don't have any
[2:03:26] emotion just because I don't scream I
[2:03:28] don't shout like everybody else doesn't
[2:03:30] mean that the Lord didn't give me
[2:03:31] something I didn't do something for me I
[2:03:33] went back to my suit and I sat down you
[2:03:36] know just just
[2:03:37] having that faith that God has done
[2:03:39] something he has done something
[2:03:40] obviously just going through mind
[2:03:42] battles that weekend and I said and I
[2:03:44] just said Lord I'm just going to let you
[2:03:46] have full control of this weekend I just
[2:03:47] went through the weekend just
[2:03:49] persevering and as I was approaching the
[2:03:51] prayer line those mind battles just
[2:03:54] coming just coming I was like you know
[2:03:55] what Satan I'm gonna draw my sword and
[2:03:58] I'm Gonna Take You Down
[2:03:59] I have and I was just I was just
[2:04:01] claiming the promises that God has for
[2:04:04] me and I was just as I stopped to that
[2:04:05] prayer line but the wrong Spencer
[2:04:07] stopped me he said remember every
[2:04:09] promise in the book is yours God has
[2:04:12] given it to you so you go out and you
[2:04:13] claim your Victory and I just went
[2:04:15] through it was such a peaceful parallel
[2:04:18] I could not experience
[2:04:22] I cannot express the peace I felt within
[2:04:25] me and that doubt said it come and I
[2:04:27] just said unbelief I know yeah
[2:04:40] yeah and from that moment on even though
[2:04:42] that the thoughts of dollars try to come
[2:04:44] by and I said you've been defeated I am
[2:04:47] a child of God you have no authority to
[2:04:50] tell me who I am because I know who I am
[2:04:52] I know what the word has spoken of me
[2:04:55] God bless you
[2:05:03] well that was wonderful
[2:05:05] you know I thought what's so amazing
[2:05:07] about that testimony is you could even
[2:05:08] see an order and a pattern
[2:05:10] you know God speaks to somebody's heart
[2:05:12] and tells you who you are
[2:05:14] but if you just run off
[2:05:16] and don't water that
[2:05:19] what does she do what was her next step
[2:05:20] and I was listening to the message
[2:05:23] see God knows how to deal with his
[2:05:25] children and God knows how to feed you
[2:05:27] and nourish you you come to church and
[2:05:29] then you water that you have to water it
[2:05:31] in prayer you have to water it was
[2:05:33] listening to the tapes you have to water
[2:05:35] it in Fellowship you have to water it
[2:05:38] with with saying and drawing your sword
[2:05:40] and so I thought that was beautiful to
[2:05:42] see somebody overcoming God bless you
[2:05:43] hey I've all a little did she know this
[2:05:46] but I've told told my wife when I see
[2:05:47] that sister walk by a little time to say
[2:05:49] there's my hero
[2:05:51] because I watched her stand up here one
[2:05:53] time and testify
[2:05:55] and say God delivered me and and and I
[2:05:58] that took courage
[2:05:59] to stand up and and that to me is the
[2:06:03] true sign of victory
[2:06:04] is when you can stand up unashamed and
[2:06:07] just say God delivered me from this it
[2:06:10] reminds me of the woman at the well a
[2:06:12] woman that was supposed to be ashamed
[2:06:14] and an outcast of her past but it didn't
[2:06:17] matter when it came down to it and she
[2:06:19] met Jesus she ran back into the town and
[2:06:22] some come see a man who told me all the
[2:06:24] things that I'd done all the things that
[2:06:26] you did you should be ashamed of
[2:06:28] yourself nope I met the master and he
[2:06:31] delivered me of them all there's a true
[2:06:33] testimony is when you met Jesus
[2:06:36] Everything Has Changed
[2:06:38] well praise the Lord let's sing a song
[2:06:40] of Victory then what's that song he's
