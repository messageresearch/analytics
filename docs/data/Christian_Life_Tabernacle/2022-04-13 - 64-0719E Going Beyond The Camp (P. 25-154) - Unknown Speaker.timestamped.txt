[19:42] all night long
[19:44] i should have never gone astray
[19:48] and now i'm the devil's prey
[19:51] i wonder if the shepherd even
[19:55] knows i'm gone
[19:58] i feel my death is near
[20:01] then the shepherd's voice i hear
[20:05] he must be mad because i've run away
[20:12] but he comes and picks me up i've never
[20:15] seen a greater love
[20:18] i'm not good enough for him to
[20:22] treat me this way
[20:26] when i'm lost he comes to find me
[20:29] when the storm rolls and he hides me
[20:33] he makes sure i've got water
[20:36] even in the desert sand
[20:39] when there's an enemy he protects me
[20:42] when i'm wrong then he corrects me
[20:46] anytime there's trouble
[20:49] they're in front of me he stands from
[20:52] the outside looking in
[20:55] you would think i'm his only little lamb
[21:13] you would think we're so
[21:15] many lamps
[21:18] losing one wouldn't be so
[21:22] bad
[21:25] but he's been faithful taking care of me
[21:30] like i'm the only lamb he has
[21:37] when i'm lost he comes to find me when
[21:41] the storm rolls in he hides me
[21:44] he makes sure i've got water
[21:47] even in the desert sand
[21:50] when there's an enemy he protects me
[21:53] when i'm wrong then he corrects me
[21:57] anytime there's trouble
[22:00] they're in front of me he stands from
[22:03] the outside looking in
[22:06] you would think
[22:08] oh
[22:09] from the outside looking in
[22:12] you would think

[30:12] amen
[30:13] amen you may be seated
[30:15] we're going to listen
[30:17] this evening
[30:20] to a little message and
[30:22] i just wanted to make this real short
[30:25] comment we kind of a busy evening so
[30:27] we're going to try to be out here just
[30:29] in about an hour
[30:31] uh 15 minutes and then they can have
[30:33] their choir practice i don't mind if you
[30:36] practice in the sanctuary as long as
[30:38] there's no
[30:40] carrying on you know it i mean
[30:42] we don't have the facility
[30:45] but
[30:46] you know we we don't want a lot of
[30:48] things worked out in here but anyway
[30:51] i just wanted to clear that up in case
[30:53] any of my comments
[30:56] were understanding well this is the
[31:00] night before
[31:02] a lot of our congregation is going to
[31:04] head over to what we call camp
[31:07] and
[31:08] so
[31:09] i this message came on my heart and when
[31:12] it came on my heart it
[31:14] i hadn't put the two together but this
[31:17] message we're going to listen to is
[31:18] called going beyond the camp
[31:22] and
[31:23] you know it's man's nature to set up
[31:26] camp
[31:28] so you you could go to camp and set up a
[31:33] camp
[31:34] you know what i'm saying but we want to
[31:36] go
[31:37] beyond
[31:38] the camp
[31:40] and i just wanted to read two statements
[31:42] and then we'll stand and we'll turn in
[31:44] our bibles over to the 13th chapter to
[31:48] hebrews starting with the 10th verse but
[31:50] i'd like to read this verse
[31:53] he said
[31:55] he makes this statement and he said
[32:00] uh
[32:01] you know i was told some time ago
[32:04] that they had a jet plane
[32:07] now
[32:08] that can make them noises we hear around
[32:11] that shakes the windows it's when the
[32:14] plane has got so fast
[32:17] that it crosses its own sound
[32:20] called the sound barrier
[32:23] and when it goes beyond its own
[32:26] soundberry it's almost unlimited
[32:29] to what it will do
[32:33] and i think that there
[32:36] and i think in there
[32:39] we get a lesson when we go beyond our
[32:44] own sound barrier
[32:46] into the word of god
[32:48] then it's unlimited what god can do with
[32:52] the man that's ready to go beyond
[32:56] the camp
[32:58] the camp of man
[33:00] that is
[33:02] now we see
[33:03] that going beyond the camp going beyond
[33:07] this camp amen and then the prophet of
[33:10] god will make another statement
[33:12] he says three thousand years ago a man
[33:15] could meet god almost anywhere
[33:18] it was a common thing for man to meet
[33:20] god
[33:21] but why
[33:22] don't they meet him today
[33:25] there is more people thousands times
[33:28] thousands millions of more people than
[33:30] there was
[33:32] three thousand years ago and yet god is
[33:35] some
[33:36] ancient
[33:37] something
[33:38] that was talked about
[33:40] some ancient history they don't meet god
[33:43] in person
[33:44] and they
[33:45] they did that many years ago
[33:48] as i said three thousand some three
[33:51] thousand year goes
[33:53] they don't do it it's not common for a
[33:56] man to meet god
[33:57] and if a man talks about it he's
[34:00] considered a crazy person
[34:02] somebody that's lost their mind it's so
[34:05] uncommon to them well we realize if we
[34:09] can go to a place
[34:12] that we've never been
[34:14] there's things that can be
[34:16] opened up to us
[34:18] and so this is an hour and three minutes
[34:21] that we're going to listen
[34:23] and uh so we're just going to stand and
[34:26] we're going to listen to a message so
[34:29] this is to
[34:30] all of our young people that are going
[34:33] to camp don't go to camp to set up a
[34:35] camp
[34:36] go to camp to go beyond the camp
[34:40] where it becomes personal where you go
[34:42] out of your comfort zone
[34:44] out of where you are in yourself and
[34:47] into the camp of god's presence where he
[34:50] can use you exceedingly and abundantly
[34:52] and above that which you can even ask
[34:55] her things so if you have your bibles
[34:57] and you'll turn over to the scripture
[35:00] there in hebrews the 13th chapter and
[35:04] we'll start listening on paragraph if
[35:06] you have
[35:08] some
[35:09] sort of device that won't
[35:12] read
[35:13] uh
[35:16] ring or something in church it we are
[35:18] going to start at page paragraph 25 and
[35:21] going beyond the camp an hour or three
[35:23] minutes listen quite a message in this
[35:26] message amen this is our absolute
[35:29] all our future
[35:31] is built on the revelation that comes
[35:33] from this word
[35:34] heavenly father we ask you to bless our
[35:36] service to us now as we listen to your
[35:39] word father and you speak to our hearts
[35:42] in this next uh 30-61 minutes or so lord
[35:46] we ask it in jesus name amen
[35:49] god bless you
[35:52] and as christian soldiers
[35:54] let's stand at attention while we read
[35:56] the word of god
[36:05] listen close to the reading of the word
[36:08] the reason i like to read it
[36:10] my words may fail but he is one so if i
[36:13] read his word alone
[36:15] you'll be blessed
[36:17] 10th verse of the 13th chapter of
[36:19] hebrews
[36:21] we
[36:21] have an altar for all they have no right
[36:25] to eat which serve the tabernacle
[36:28] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[36:31] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[36:33] the high priest for sin
[36:35] are burned
[36:37] without the
[36:38] camp wherefore jesus also that he might
[36:42] sanctify the people with his own blood
[36:45] suffered
[36:47] without the gate
[36:49] let us go forth therefore unto him
[36:52] without the camp
[36:54] bearing his reproach
[36:57] for here we have no continuing city but
[37:00] we seek one to come
[37:03] lord god
[37:05] who is responsible for this word
[37:09] and responsible for taking care of it
[37:12] down through the ages to see that it's
[37:13] come to us
[37:15] unadulterated
[37:16] it is pure virgin word of god
[37:20] we so cherish it in our hearts at this
[37:22] moment
[37:24] break this
[37:26] text up lord into a context for us
[37:29] tonight
[37:30] that we the children of man
[37:32] might understand
[37:35] the bidding of god
[37:37] or we asked it in jesus name
[37:40] amen
[37:41] god bless you
[37:49] my subject for the this evening
[37:52] is
[37:53] going beyond the camp
[37:57] it's quite a little subject it's a
[37:59] little odd but you know
[38:02] usually we find god in odd things
[38:06] the world gets so set in a custom thing
[38:09] there anything irregular from the
[38:11] regular trend
[38:13] it becomes odd
[38:15] as i preached here a few days ago at the
[38:17] tabernacle on the oddball
[38:21] and the farmer is an oddball to the
[38:23] businessman the businessman and oddball
[38:25] to the farmer the christian is an
[38:26] oddball to the unbeliever and so forth
[38:29] yet to be somebody's fool
[38:32] so anything unusual it makes you kind of
[38:35] a fool to the the regular trend
[38:38] and therefore
[38:40] god's people and his prophets and his
[38:43] his messengers through the age that
[38:45] carried his message from the word has
[38:48] been considered fools
[38:52] to the outsider noah was a fool to his
[38:55] great intellectual
[38:57] world that he preached noah was
[38:59] certainly a fool to pharaoh with his
[39:01] foot on the throne and then forsake it
[39:03] for a bunch of mud daubers as they
[39:05] thought
[39:06] and jesus was a fool to the people and
[39:08] all the rest of them that's worked and
[39:11] lived for god has been considered fools
[39:14] they have to go beyond the camp
[39:17] that they have
[39:18] more and more i am made to believe that
[39:22] people are not getting to christ
[39:26] now i am here to try to help in every
[39:29] way that i can and make my statements as
[39:31] clear as i know how to make them and you
[39:34] suffer with me if you will
[39:36] as i look and preach across the nation
[39:40] and watch the people i i'm fully
[39:43] persuaded that the people are not
[39:45] getting to christ
[39:47] and i believe that it's the enemy that
[39:49] stole this hindrance
[39:53] because the reason i believe is he is
[39:56] not the
[39:57] object that they have been pointed to
[40:01] they have either been pointed
[40:04] to a
[40:06] a dogma or a doctrine or a party our
[40:09] experience or a sensation
[40:12] or something like that instead of being
[40:14] pointed to christ
[40:16] the word
[40:18] amen that's why i think that people are
[40:21] resting their eternal destination
[40:25] upon some dogma
[40:28] or some sensation like uh some say i
[40:32] danced in the spirit uh i spoke with
[40:35] tongues i i felt fire run over me and do
[40:38] you know all those things can be
[40:41] impersonated by the devil
[40:44] there's just one thing that he cannot
[40:46] impersonate that's the word
[40:49] in the debate
[40:51] between he and jesus
[40:53] each time jesus defeated it is written
[40:58] the word
[40:59] i believe today that the reason
[41:02] that people are not coming to christ is
[41:04] because there appointed many of them to
[41:07] a
[41:08] a denomination
[41:11] you come join our church
[41:13] or you are read our catechism
[41:16] or believe our doctrine
[41:19] are
[41:20] some system of some sort they're
[41:22] appointed in the wrong way
[41:26] and their action
[41:29] and the life that they live without
[41:32] christ proves in their own life
[41:35] is vindicated by that very thing
[41:38] for instance i don't want to hurt anyone
[41:40] stealing
[41:41] but back and forth across the nation i
[41:44] have condemned women wearing short hair
[41:47] that's the bible
[41:49] i've condemned women wearing shorts
[41:51] using makeup
[41:53] and every year it gets worse
[41:57] it shows that there is another finger
[42:00] somewhere pointing them some other way
[42:05] and they're not getting through to
[42:07] christ
[42:08] and they say we belong to a church
[42:11] our church don't don't make any
[42:12] difference what your church believes
[42:15] god said it's wrong
[42:19] and if they did get through to christ
[42:21] they would stop that
[42:24] and not only that but man would take his
[42:28] position
[42:29] if he got through to christ and be
[42:31] against that husbands wouldn't let their
[42:33] wives act like that
[42:36] genuine man don't want his wife acting
[42:39] that way
[42:40] a young fellow here in the city the
[42:42] other day like to kill two young boys
[42:45] they were at a certain polling station
[42:47] you jeffersonville people seen it in the
[42:48] paper
[42:49] and this a young girl run into a philly
[42:53] station with nothing on harley at all
[42:56] and the two young man sitting there made
[42:58] a remark and the attendant
[43:00] liked to kill the two boys and was
[43:03] arrested for it and put in court and the
[43:05] judge asked him why did you she dressed
[43:08] like this he said i think she looks cute
[43:12] now there's something wrong with that
[43:14] man i don't care if he's a sinner
[43:17] there's something wrong with him
[43:19] his love to that woman couldn't be
[43:21] genuine
[43:23] and put her out for a dog bait like that
[43:27] there's something wrong has man ever
[43:29] come to the realization they can judge
[43:31] between what's right and wrong
[43:33] did you see the new bathing suits they
[43:35] brought out
[43:36] do you know my prediction that women
[43:38] would finally come to fig leaves 33
[43:40] years ago and now they've got them
[43:42] dressed in fig leaves transplant skirts
[43:47] the word of the lord never fails
[43:52] that was to take place just before the
[43:54] end time
[43:55] come to a fig leaf again i was reading
[43:57] it in life magazine
[44:00] that was said 33 years ago before women
[44:02] took their fall is told how they would
[44:04] do it in this day and here they are how
[44:06] they wear garments like man and how the
[44:09] immorals of the woman will drop in this
[44:11] nation lowest of all the nations there
[44:14] is in the world is this america she's
[44:17] the filthiest of the bunch
[44:19] that's according to the statistics the
[44:22] marriage and divorce rates are higher in
[44:24] this nation than any other place in the
[44:26] world
[44:28] another nation's pattern we used to
[44:30] pattern from france
[44:32] filth and dirt of that nation and now
[44:35] they get their dressing from us
[44:38] we step beyond their boundaries
[44:43] i know there's some reason that people
[44:45] are not getting through to christ
[44:48] if they would they wouldn't act like
[44:50] that
[44:51] jesus suffered without the gates that he
[44:54] might sanctify his people
[44:59] with his own blood
[45:01] sanctification comes from a greek word
[45:03] compound which means cleaned and set
[45:06] aside for service
[45:09] and when god cleans his people with the
[45:12] blood of jesus he cleans them from the
[45:15] filth of the world and sets them aside
[45:19] for service
[45:22] wherefore jesus also that he might
[45:24] sanctify the people with his own blood
[45:26] suffered without the gate
[45:30] even to the full gospel people
[45:33] has come right back into the rep that
[45:35] they come out of
[45:37] what was the pentecostal church 40 50
[45:39] years ago
[45:41] they cursed them damned and ridiculed
[45:44] the churches that they come out of them
[45:46] denominations
[45:48] what did they do just like a dog to its
[45:50] vomit and a sow to its water they turned
[45:53] right back in the same place that they
[45:55] were huge from
[45:58] now their churches are just as filthy as
[46:00] the rest of them
[46:03] it was something else i said this
[46:05] morning like uh the people are like
[46:07] peter said in saint uh
[46:10] saint matthew 17 um
[46:12] 48 where he said it's good to be here
[46:15] let's build three tabernacles
[46:17] but the spirit fed him not to do it said
[46:20] this is my beloved son
[46:23] hear ye him and he is the word
[46:28] amen
[46:29] that's who we're to look to
[46:31] the word
[46:32] not our enthusiasm or something else
[46:36] he is my word hear ye him
[46:40] and what did they see
[46:42] after this voice spoke to them
[46:45] even moses and elijah wasn't present
[46:49] neither was there a creed
[46:51] neither was there anything left but
[46:53] jesus only
[46:55] and he is the word
[46:58] that's all they see
[47:00] now
[47:01] going without the camp
[47:05] we find that on their camp
[47:08] where this great occasion took place up
[47:10] on mount transfiguration as peter later
[47:14] called it the holy mountain
[47:17] where he met with them
[47:19] now i do not believe the apostle meant
[47:22] that the mountain was holy
[47:24] he meant it was a holy god on the
[47:27] mountain
[47:28] it isn't the holy church
[47:32] it's not the holy people
[47:34] it's a holy ghost in the people
[47:38] the holy ghost is holy
[47:40] he is your director and your leader
[47:43] and we find on this little camp up on
[47:47] the mountain transfiguration when they
[47:49] were commissioned
[47:51] to hear the only thing they was
[47:54] commissioned to do was to hear the word
[47:58] amen only thing they seen without a
[48:01] creed
[48:02] they never seen nothing else but jesus
[48:06] and he is the word made flesh
[48:09] [Music]
[48:11] how beautiful that is to the same camp
[48:13] that was in the garden of eden
[48:16] when god fortified his church in the
[48:18] garden of eden his people they had one
[48:21] wall to stay behind that was the word
[48:24] they had one shield one armor
[48:27] one thing because god knowed what would
[48:30] defeat the devil amen and that's the
[48:33] word
[48:34] jesus did the same thing it is the word
[48:37] it is written
[48:38] and satan tried to to quote it not quote
[48:42] it quote it for him
[48:44] and jesus said and it's also written
[48:49] now we must stay with that word and in
[48:52] this little camp that they had there of
[48:55] peter james and john
[48:57] and
[48:58] jesus moses and alive
[49:01] and in their camp
[49:03] they seen the heavenly host
[49:06] of the shadow or the pillar of life
[49:10] hanging in this cloud that transfigured
[49:13] the lord jesus and when they were ready
[49:16] to make a denomination one for the law
[49:18] and one for the prophets and so forth
[49:20] the voice said this is my beloved son
[49:22] hear ye him
[49:24] then the thought they was commissioned
[49:25] just exactly like it was in eden stay
[49:28] with the word
[49:31] that's god's camp for his people
[49:35] it seems today to be a day of when
[49:38] people are going beyond
[49:41] the camp
[49:43] and everything they're going beyond
[49:46] you know i was told some time ago that
[49:48] they had a jet plane now
[49:51] that can make some noise as we hear
[49:53] around here that shakes the windows
[49:56] it's when the plane has got so fast
[49:59] that it crosses its own sound
[50:03] called sound barrier
[50:05] and when it goes beyond its own
[50:08] sound barrier
[50:10] it's almost unlimited to what i'll do
[50:15] and i think in there that we get a
[50:17] lesson
[50:18] when we go beyond our own sound barrier
[50:23] into the word of god then it's unlimited
[50:26] what god can do with a man
[50:28] that's ready to go beyond the camp
[50:33] the camp of man that is
[50:36] now we see that going beyond the camp
[50:40] going beyond this
[50:41] i see satan also is taking his people
[50:45] beyond the camp of reason
[50:49] beyond the
[50:51] the
[50:52] the camp of of common sense
[50:57] satan taken his people the other way
[50:59] beyond the camp god taken his people
[51:02] beyond this other way
[51:04] and satan has taken him
[51:06] beyond the camp of common decency
[51:10] when it comes to a place that people
[51:13] and can act and do and get by with the
[51:16] things that they're doing today
[51:18] in the order of morals
[51:21] it's beyond my
[51:23] thoughts of how that a man can set his
[51:26] wife out there dress like that
[51:29] and then slap somebody for insulting her
[51:33] it's beyond common sense
[51:37] you ought to know better than that
[51:40] beyond common decency
[51:42] where is the stop in place
[51:45] some man or woman at my age
[51:48] i might ask you this
[51:50] what if my mother or your mother
[51:54] about 50 years ago walked out on the
[51:57] street with one of these pair of shorts
[51:59] of bikini is there what you call it on
[52:01] the law would have picked him up
[52:03] immediately and put him in the insane
[52:06] institution
[52:08] a lady left the house without her top
[52:12] clothes on
[52:13] and she should be in the institution
[52:16] because middle east say something wrong
[52:20] and if it was mentally
[52:22] to do a thing like that then
[52:25] it certainly is a sign that something's
[52:28] went insane it's still
[52:41] and when a man can smoke cigarettes
[52:45] and the doctor's proven to him that
[52:47] thousands die every year from the calls
[52:51] and can still puff away at cigarettes
[52:54] it seems like there's something wrong
[52:57] with that man's mind
[53:02] and when a man has a mental shock
[53:06] and he doesn't can't get himself
[53:08] together
[53:09] what he's doing
[53:10] he'll search every doctor's office or is
[53:12] it a country to find out what's wrong
[53:14] with him
[53:16] but then he'll stand at the bar
[53:19] or in the car
[53:21] and drink till he's totally insane
[53:26] spend his money to shove himself into
[53:28] that and if you happen to go into it
[53:30] without the intoxication of liquor then
[53:33] he'll spend every penny he finds in a
[53:35] doctor's office trying to find out
[53:36] what's wrong with him
[53:39] it doesn't make sense
[53:42] if there would come a chicken hog flying
[53:44] over the city
[53:46] and i'd get my rifle
[53:48] and go out in my backyard
[53:50] and shoot this hulk
[53:53] and 10 minutes from there i'd be in jail
[53:56] they would have me arrested
[53:58] for
[53:59] for disorderly conduct
[54:02] handling a firearm in the city
[54:05] endangering people's lives with a rifle
[54:07] shooting up in the air at the halt
[54:10] i might kill somebody you'd say
[54:13] he ought to be put away
[54:15] and then they will sell a man enough
[54:17] liquor to get him drunk and stick him in
[54:19] a car that might kill a whole family
[54:22] full and when he's caught he's given
[54:24] five dollars in cost
[54:27] premeditated murder
[54:31] what's the matter with the world
[54:34] something's wrong
[54:36] somewhere now
[54:39] going beyond the camp
[54:40] beyond decency beyond reason
[54:44] you notice our politicians today won't
[54:46] say nothing about reading the bible in
[54:48] school they're afraid they don't know
[54:50] which way the winds are blowing they
[54:52] don't know where they lose the vote or
[54:53] not
[54:54] we need another abraham lincoln
[54:58] we need another john quincy adam we need
[55:00] somebody
[55:01] who will stand up
[55:03] regardless of which way the winds are
[55:05] going
[55:06] and give her honest convictions
[55:09] the day of the nomination preacher
[55:11] though you're streaming the word the
[55:12] truth he don't know what to do he's
[55:15] afraid he'll lose his meal ticket
[55:17] we need men and women today that's burly
[55:20] with the gospel
[55:22] somebody that'll stand and tell their
[55:24] convictions
[55:26] point out what's right and what's wrong
[55:28] hallelujah whether the word of god or
[55:30] were the denominations right jesus said
[55:32] let every man's word be a lie and mind
[55:34] the truth
[55:35] amen
[55:36] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[55:38] word shall never pass away
[55:41] so you see they go beyond the camp of
[55:44] god's word to find their answers
[55:50] we hear
[55:52] what's persuaded them from the camp of
[55:55] god's word
[55:56] like he did eve in the garden of eden
[56:01] satan has done the same thing today all
[56:04] right we find that people are persuaded
[56:06] to their dogmas and creeds without the
[56:09] camp in their camp of dogma and creed
[56:13] they have a camp also
[56:15] and that puts them into his king
[56:18] his is the camp of
[56:20] education
[56:22] theology
[56:23] works
[56:25] doctor's degree
[56:26] educational
[56:29] personality
[56:31] everything that's against god's word
[56:34] camp
[56:35] god has to camp for his people
[56:38] the domination has her own camp
[56:40] three thousand years ago
[56:43] a man can meet god most anywhere it was
[56:46] a common thing
[56:48] for a man to meet god
[56:51] but why don't they meet him today
[56:54] there's more people
[56:56] thousands times thousands and millions
[56:58] of more people than it was 3 000 years
[57:00] ago
[57:01] and yet
[57:02] god is some ancient something that was
[57:05] talked about
[57:07] some ancient history
[57:09] they don't meet god in person like they
[57:12] did many years ago as i said three
[57:15] thousand some three thousand years ago
[57:17] they don't
[57:19] it's not common for man to meet god
[57:22] if a man talks about it he's considered
[57:25] a crazy person somebody that's lost
[57:27] their mind
[57:28] it's so uncommon to them
[57:32] and the case of abraham
[57:35] and it is camp
[57:37] why it was almost an everyday occasion
[57:40] that abraham met god
[57:42] he talked to him
[57:44] not only that but when they went down in
[57:48] the guerrilla to sojourn we find out
[57:50] down there that god was in the camp with
[57:53] amalek a philistine
[57:56] it was a very common thing
[57:58] they lived in the camp of his presence
[58:01] today they live in their own camp
[58:04] and they haven't got nothing to do with
[58:06] god's king they want nothing to do with
[58:08] it because it's fanatically to the world
[58:11] it's fanatically to them
[58:13] but remember when god fixed the first
[58:15] camp for people he fortified them with
[58:18] his word he always does
[58:21] but today in their camps they don't know
[58:23] that's reason you don't hear so much
[58:24] about god
[58:25] now
[58:27] i
[58:28] believe that the if the camp as moses
[58:32] how he met moses in the wilderness
[58:35] moses had a camp out there where he was
[58:37] feeding his father's lost sheep jethro
[58:40] on the back side of the desert
[58:43] and one day to this old 80 year old
[58:46] sheep herder
[58:48] he uh seen a light or a pillar of fire
[58:50] in a bush burning
[58:52] and he met god
[58:54] a man that was running from god the next
[58:56] day sometimes meeting god makes you do
[58:59] things unusual
[59:01] moses is very unusual the next day he
[59:04] had his wife setting the straddle of a
[59:05] mule with a baby on her hip his long
[59:07] beard down with a crooked stick in his
[59:09] hand going down to egypt to take the
[59:10] nation over
[59:12] now that was a ridiculous sight
[59:14] where are you going moses going to egypt
[59:16] what far to take it over
[59:20] he had met god
[59:22] a one-man invasion
[59:25] it seemed awful strange but the thing of
[59:27] it was he'd done it
[59:30] because he had met god
[59:35] just like one person going to take
[59:36] russia over that's all you need one
[59:38] person in the will of god
[59:41] moses is in the will of god and a
[59:43] crooked stick he had his hand not a
[59:45] sword or stick
[59:46] uh unusual things god does
[59:49] but remember moses had to get out of the
[59:52] camp that he had been living in to do
[59:54] this
[59:55] because he had been down there with a
[59:56] whole army and couldn't do it
[59:59] with all the armies of egypt he couldn't
[1:00:01] do it but one day
[1:00:02] god invited him into his camp
[1:00:06] he said who are you that i am that i am
[1:00:10] not i was or will be
[1:00:12] present tense i am
[1:00:15] i'm the god of abraham isaac and of
[1:00:17] jacob
[1:00:18] i've heard the people's cry and i
[1:00:20] remember my promise and this is the time
[1:00:23] for this to be fulfilled i'm sending you
[1:00:25] down moses with this stick that's in
[1:00:27] your hand
[1:00:29] what was it he now the people thought he
[1:00:31] was crazy
[1:00:33] but what had he done got out of his own
[1:00:36] camp
[1:00:37] pharaoh educated in 40 years
[1:00:40] in the school camp
[1:00:42] and he failed and it taken god another
[1:00:45] 40 years to get it out of him
[1:00:48] all of his education and all of his
[1:00:49] theology that he'd been taught it taken
[1:00:51] 40 years to get it out of him and then
[1:00:54] god used him for 40 years
[1:00:57] god has an awful time preparing his man
[1:01:00] but you see he never could get moses
[1:01:02] hold of moses to moses got out of his
[1:01:05] own man-made
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:09] the campaign from the military way of
[1:01:11] doing it and the natural way of doing it
[1:01:13] onto the supernatural way of doing it
[1:01:16] then when he got in that camp god could
[1:01:19] use him
[1:01:20] now
[1:01:21] we find out that in this wilderness we
[1:01:24] notice when
[1:01:25] they've taken taken their stand and come
[1:01:27] out of egypt into god's camp
[1:01:31] coming out of the camp with the priests
[1:01:33] and all them saying sell yourself we're
[1:01:35] slaves for the rest of time when moses
[1:01:38] the prophet came down and vindicated the
[1:01:41] word of god was at hand
[1:01:43] that god who made the promise was there
[1:01:45] to deliver the people
[1:01:47] they moved from the camp that they were
[1:01:49] in into the camp of god's promised word
[1:01:52] of the hour
[1:01:54] they believed that prophet
[1:01:56] because the sign of vindication was
[1:01:58] proven that it was exactly the word of
[1:01:59] god
[1:02:01] and the things he did prove that it was
[1:02:03] right and the pillar of fire followed
[1:02:05] him along prove that it was the word of
[1:02:08] god
[1:02:09] now in this camp miracle signs and
[1:02:12] wonders
[1:02:13] was in this camp
[1:02:15] they moved them out into the wilderness
[1:02:17] they left their natural camp they left
[1:02:20] the mud camp
[1:02:22] they left the camp made with straw and
[1:02:24] brick
[1:02:25] to dwell
[1:02:26] in tents out in the wilderness where
[1:02:28] there was no grain or nothing else
[1:02:31] sometimes god asked us to do foolish
[1:02:34] things to her own thinking
[1:02:37] if you ever leave the camp of your own
[1:02:39] reason that's the place you'll find god
[1:02:42] amen
[1:02:44] notice
[1:02:45] as they went out into the wilderness
[1:02:47] there were miracles signs when they
[1:02:49] moved into this camp now remember they
[1:02:52] left egypt's camp
[1:02:54] and moved out into the wilderness with
[1:02:57] god's camp how do you know it was god
[1:03:00] sent your people shall sojourn for 400
[1:03:03] years but i'll bring them out with a
[1:03:05] mighty hand and i'll give them this land
[1:03:08] here
[1:03:09] and they were on their road by a
[1:03:11] vindicated light a vindicated prophet
[1:03:14] with signs wonders that god was in the
[1:03:16] camp and they were on their road
[1:03:20] they had a pillar of fire they had a
[1:03:21] prophet they had manna they had living
[1:03:23] waters
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:27] their chance changed campgrounds
[1:03:31] they had to do it they couldn't see
[1:03:33] those things in egypt
[1:03:35] they had to change the campgrounds
[1:03:38] in order to see the supernatural
[1:03:41] so will the people of this state
[1:03:43] have to change the camp from them
[1:03:45] denominations that say the days of
[1:03:47] miracles has passed there's no such a
[1:03:49] thing as the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:51] and all these scriptures are wrong and
[1:03:53] they work for another age you'll have to
[1:03:55] change your compounds
[1:04:00] go beyond that tent
[1:04:02] the world things are possible
[1:04:05] all of them was vindicating his presence
[1:04:07] in the camp
[1:04:09] now notice
[1:04:11] then
[1:04:12] them they made a man-made cape of
[1:04:15] traditions and creed after moses was
[1:04:17] dead and
[1:04:18] god dealt with the people for many years
[1:04:21] uh god uh not in his camp anymore in
[1:04:24] their camp because they made a camp
[1:04:27] self-made camp
[1:04:30] remember
[1:04:31] when they were called out of egypt god
[1:04:34] provided them a prophet
[1:04:36] provided them a sacrificial lamb
[1:04:39] provided them
[1:04:42] all they had need of
[1:04:44] a word a sign a miracle
[1:04:46] a prophet to lead them an atonement to
[1:04:49] take care of them
[1:04:51] the pillar of fire to lead them and when
[1:04:53] they got out into the wilderness they
[1:04:56] still wasn't satisfied
[1:04:58] they wanted something they could do
[1:05:00] themselves grace had provided that now
[1:05:02] they want something to do themselves so
[1:05:04] they can make them an organization fuss
[1:05:06] and fight and stew who is going to be
[1:05:07] high priest who would be this that or
[1:05:09] the other one day god said moses
[1:05:11] separate yourself from him and he just
[1:05:13] swallowed him up
[1:05:14] and again saying of cora notice
[1:05:17] all these signs and wonders vindicate
[1:05:19] his presence then made it man made
[1:05:21] himself a camp a camp of creed and could
[1:05:24] tradition
[1:05:25] not god's camp of his word a camp of
[1:05:28] their own
[1:05:29] he
[1:05:30] had to leave them
[1:05:32] for he is the word
[1:05:34] he cannot stay where people are taught
[1:05:37] out of this word god cannot stay in the
[1:05:40] camp
[1:05:42] he can't
[1:05:44] he never did
[1:05:46] he must stay exactly where he's
[1:05:49] when he had to leave that camp then of
[1:05:52] that whole gang of people that he
[1:05:54] brought up out of egypt he only dwelt
[1:05:56] among his prophets
[1:05:59] to whom his word came
[1:06:02] the word came to the prophet to
[1:06:04] vindicate the hour he dwelt among the
[1:06:07] prophets and revealed to the prophets
[1:06:09] how they
[1:06:11] cursed the people and cursed the things
[1:06:14] and god taught them his commandments and
[1:06:16] the way of life
[1:06:18] and the people was always against it and
[1:06:21] persecuted the prophet and finally
[1:06:22] stoned him or sought him to pieces and
[1:06:24] got rid of him
[1:06:26] jesus said which one of the prophets
[1:06:28] didn't your father's murder
[1:06:32] which one of them are the just ones that
[1:06:34] was sent to them
[1:06:36] and said the works of your father you'll
[1:06:39] do
[1:06:39] he wasn't talking to communists
[1:06:42] he was talking to priests
[1:06:45] denominational people pharisees and
[1:06:47] sadducees
[1:06:49] i suppose his voice wouldn't change very
[1:06:51] much tonight only be a little worse
[1:06:52] maybe to them now we find out that he
[1:06:56] dwelled in among his prophets
[1:06:58] he then became a stranger to them
[1:07:01] for he dwelts only in his word
[1:07:04] to confirm it the bible said that he
[1:07:07] watches over his word
[1:07:09] to confirm it he's trying to find
[1:07:12] someone if he can just get a
[1:07:14] half-hearted man like samson
[1:07:16] samson surrendered his strength to god
[1:07:19] but he gave his heart to delilah
[1:07:21] that's the way that many times we do
[1:07:23] today
[1:07:24] just give something to god but not all
[1:07:26] but god wants all of us
[1:07:30] like an insurance policy
[1:07:33] when you get an insurance policy you
[1:07:35] might as well get full coverage
[1:07:38] and that's what this blessed assurance
[1:07:40] does for us it's a full coverage policy
[1:07:44] it covers all we have needed up here in
[1:07:46] this life and our resurrection and
[1:07:48] eternal life it includes everything
[1:07:50] notice
[1:07:51] god stayed out of their camp then for
[1:07:54] 400 years
[1:07:57] why he had no more prophets
[1:08:00] from the prophet malachi to the prophet
[1:08:03] john
[1:08:04] 400 years there's not one turn of a
[1:08:07] wheel that israel done
[1:08:11] god was out of the camp
[1:08:13] they pat him out
[1:08:15] by their creeds and their selfishness
[1:08:18] and their difference towards the word
[1:08:21] 400 years without the word
[1:08:26] from one prophet to another he journeyed
[1:08:28] until the last prophet was malachi and
[1:08:31] then there was another prophet for 400
[1:08:34] years
[1:08:35] and then god came on the scene again
[1:08:38] one day he walked among them again
[1:08:41] but their traditions had so tackled his
[1:08:44] place among them he was a stranger to
[1:08:47] them
[1:08:50] the traditions of the fathers
[1:08:53] had washing pans and and the way to
[1:08:56] groom their hair and where the certain
[1:08:58] buttons on their coat and they're
[1:09:00] certainly police priests robes and one's
[1:09:03] a staunch pharisee and the others of
[1:09:05] sadducee and that had taken the place of
[1:09:08] the word among those men to when god
[1:09:12] visit them
[1:09:13] he was a foreigner
[1:09:18] may i say this with love and respect
[1:09:21] but to drive it home
[1:09:24] it's the same thing today
[1:09:27] it hasn't changed a bit
[1:09:30] when he comes among the people in his
[1:09:32] power and manifestation to prove that
[1:09:34] his words the same yesterday today and
[1:09:36] forever because he is the word
[1:09:39] the people said
[1:09:41] a fortune teller
[1:09:42] of the elizabeth but jesus only or or
[1:09:45] something like that
[1:09:47] some clash you somewhere
[1:09:50] but it has to be that way
[1:09:53] see we haven't had a prophet now for
[1:09:55] almost 2 000 years
[1:09:59] the gentiles didn't get one you know
[1:10:01] promised at the end
[1:10:04] now we know that by scripture we know
[1:10:06] that also by history
[1:10:09] that this is promised to us now after
[1:10:12] 400 years god walked right among them
[1:10:15] one day according to the scripture he
[1:10:17] was to be made flesh and dwelt among
[1:10:19] them
[1:10:20] his name shall be called counselor
[1:10:22] prince of peace mighty god everlasting
[1:10:25] father
[1:10:26] and when he came among the people
[1:10:30] they said we'll not have this man rule
[1:10:32] over us
[1:10:34] what what fellowship card does he pack
[1:10:38] what denomination sent him
[1:10:40] he had no cooperation
[1:10:43] every church she went to they thought it
[1:10:45] out
[1:10:47] they had nothing to do with him
[1:10:49] because he wasn't one of them
[1:10:53] and as it was then so is it now the
[1:10:56] bible said the ladies church would put
[1:10:59] him on the outside and he was knocking
[1:11:01] trying to get in
[1:11:04] there's something wrong somewhere
[1:11:08] now
[1:11:09] why
[1:11:10] they had made their own camp
[1:11:12] they if they were to know the word they
[1:11:15] had to know who he was
[1:11:17] jesus said if you search the scriptures
[1:11:20] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:11:22] life
[1:11:22] they are the ones that tell you who i am
[1:11:26] amen
[1:11:27] that's what the scripture says
[1:11:29] now they testify me
[1:11:32] and if i do not the works that was
[1:11:34] promised for me to do
[1:11:36] if i do not to worship my father the
[1:11:39] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:11:40] the word was with god and the word was
[1:11:42] god
[1:11:43] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:11:44] among us now if i am that person
[1:11:48] search the scriptures and see what i'm
[1:11:50] supposed to do
[1:11:51] and if i don't qualify if my works the
[1:11:54] works that the word testifies the father
[1:11:57] testifies of me
[1:11:59] if they don't vindicate who i am
[1:12:02] then i'm wrong
[1:12:04] amen that's right if you can't believe
[1:12:06] me please
[1:12:09] the works
[1:12:10] that the word produces
[1:12:12] see
[1:12:12] he was a stranger among them
[1:12:15] they didn't know him
[1:12:16] we'll have nothing to do with this
[1:12:18] fellow just the odd fellow they've been
[1:12:20] born down there
[1:12:21] uh in a stable somewhere they believed
[1:12:23] that his mother had this baby before
[1:12:26] that it was born before it was uh
[1:12:28] had this baby
[1:12:29] from an illegitimate birth rather and
[1:12:32] then
[1:12:33] before the baby was born that she went
[1:12:35] off and married joseph and he did that
[1:12:37] just to hold a black mark off of her
[1:12:40] her character and he become an odd sort
[1:12:43] of a fella because he was a illegitimate
[1:12:45] born child and that's the reason he was
[1:12:47] and when he come out what did he do tear
[1:12:50] down their creeds
[1:12:53] turn over their tables
[1:12:55] get them out of places that's written
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:01] not aren't you told who he
[1:13:02] was it is written
[1:13:06] well they have nothing to do with such a
[1:13:07] fellow as that
[1:13:08] but way down deep in their heart they
[1:13:10] know who he was
[1:13:12] for nicodemus plainly stated that
[1:13:15] rabbi
[1:13:16] we the pharisees
[1:13:18] we know your teacher come from god for
[1:13:22] no man could do the things that you do
[1:13:23] except god be with him
[1:13:26] why didn't they confess he man
[1:13:29] it's because they're
[1:13:30] camp had set its boundaries
[1:13:34] it wouldn't let him in the camp and
[1:13:36] wouldn't let anybody go out to him
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:40] they had their own camp
[1:13:42] he combined when the gate was really
[1:13:44] closed but he found that he could met
[1:13:47] him anyhow
[1:13:49] yes
[1:13:50] same now
[1:13:51] they have he's become a stranger
[1:13:54] foreigner they don't understand it why
[1:13:56] would this be and why would that be when
[1:13:59] the word itself testifies that this is
[1:14:01] exactly what's supposed to be done in
[1:14:03] this day
[1:14:06] we went through it over and over
[1:14:08] but it's the truth he was to them in
[1:14:11] their camp
[1:14:12] a fanatic
[1:14:14] a breaker of their traditions
[1:14:18] our upsetter of their churches
[1:14:21] really just a fortune teller spears is
[1:14:24] called beelzebub
[1:14:26] that's what he was
[1:14:28] and i believe if he come among us today
[1:14:32] he'd be the same thing to us
[1:14:36] for we have tradition
[1:14:38] we have denominations
[1:14:40] we can't even get along with one another
[1:14:44] why
[1:14:44] there's only one place that man can get
[1:14:47] along that's under the shed blood and
[1:14:49] the blood was shed as a germ of life to
[1:14:52] germatize this seed the word
[1:14:56] outside of that our denominational
[1:14:58] bearers will always keep people away
[1:15:01] but he'd be a stranger today he'd be
[1:15:03] called the same thing he'd be active
[1:15:05] he'd be put out of the camp and did you
[1:15:07] know the same bible that said you'd be
[1:15:09] rejected a man a man of sorrow
[1:15:11] acquainted with grief and they rejected
[1:15:13] and we did a steaming smitten thinking
[1:15:14] of god
[1:15:16] the very scripture that told that
[1:15:19] the very prophet that sang out my god my
[1:15:22] god why has thou forsaken me my bones
[1:15:24] they all stare at me they pierce my
[1:15:26] hands and my feet
[1:15:28] when they were singing that hymn in the
[1:15:31] church
[1:15:32] their sacrifice the god that they
[1:15:34] thought they were serving they were
[1:15:36] crucifying
[1:15:38] so is it today
[1:15:40] the very god
[1:15:42] look what the prophet said amos
[1:15:45] when he come into samaria and his little
[1:15:48] eyes narrowed as he come before that
[1:15:50] scene that sinful city women laying in
[1:15:52] the street with man
[1:15:54] of modern
[1:15:56] america
[1:15:57] when he looked up over his air eyes
[1:15:59] narrowed
[1:16:00] and he had nobody sponsoring he had no
[1:16:03] fellowship card
[1:16:05] god is saying
[1:16:06] would the people hear his message
[1:16:08] no they wouldn't hear him
[1:16:10] but he prophesied and he said the very
[1:16:13] god that you claim to serve will destroy
[1:16:16] you
[1:16:17] i say in the name of jesus christ the
[1:16:20] very god that this nation claims to be a
[1:16:22] religious nation the very god that they
[1:16:25] claim to serve will destroy them in
[1:16:26] their initiative
[1:16:29] and destroy every denomination off the
[1:16:31] face of the earth
[1:16:33] but they claim to serve
[1:16:35] so notice he rebuked them and they put
[1:16:39] him out of their camp
[1:16:43] jesus suffered without the camp
[1:16:46] he put him out of the camp
[1:16:48] outside way beyond their camp we find
[1:16:52] out that the bible said in this slave
[1:16:54] stay under this lady of sea and age
[1:16:56] they'd do the same thing
[1:16:58] they would be put out of the camp now
[1:17:00] watch what he says to do now in closing
[1:17:03] put out of the camp
[1:17:04] where the sacrifices was burned that's
[1:17:06] where he belonged
[1:17:08] he was a sacrifice
[1:17:10] now brother sister do you know that each
[1:17:12] one of you all must sacrifice
[1:17:14] you must be god's sacrifice
[1:17:17] sacrifice the things of the world
[1:17:19] sacrifice your own pleasures of this
[1:17:20] world sacrifice the things of the world
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:26] you know the reason that people won't do
[1:17:28] it you know a sheep
[1:17:30] a sheep don't have but one thing to
[1:17:32] offer and that's wool
[1:17:34] and now he's not asked to produce or to
[1:17:37] manufacture some wool for this year
[1:17:39] he's asked to put to
[1:17:42] bear wool we're not asked to manufacture
[1:17:45] something we're asked to bear the fruit
[1:17:48] of the spirit that is the inside of the
[1:17:50] sheep what he is on the inside makes the
[1:17:53] wool on the outside and when a man is
[1:17:56] got christ on the inside it may seem
[1:17:59] christ-like on the outside not some
[1:18:01] artificial put on
[1:18:04] well we find when that takes place when
[1:18:06] christ comes back how is he treated just
[1:18:08] exactly like it was at the beginning
[1:18:11] always has been
[1:18:13] so
[1:18:14] he so rebuked them that they put them
[1:18:16] out of his camp and made him as a sinner
[1:18:20] which he became sin for us
[1:18:23] now after hundreds of years yes almost 2
[1:18:26] 000 years he's visit their camp again
[1:18:30] according to his promised word
[1:18:32] that he'd do in the last days
[1:18:35] he's visit the camp again
[1:18:37] he's visited the camp to manifest
[1:18:40] this word today just like he visited
[1:18:43] back in that day
[1:18:45] and he did in moses dave that was not
[1:18:47] moses doing that
[1:18:49] moses was a man it was christ
[1:18:53] look at joseph the life
[1:18:55] love of the father hated of his brothers
[1:18:58] well because he was a seer
[1:19:00] and they hated him without a cause
[1:19:02] that's only cause they could hate him
[1:19:03] for perfect time for today exactly the
[1:19:06] church again they hate the spiritual
[1:19:08] things and we find out that he was sold
[1:19:10] for 130 pieces of silver supposed to be
[1:19:13] dead tucked up and put in a prison house
[1:19:16] like jesus was on the cross one man lost
[1:19:18] and one man saved and was taken from
[1:19:20] there to the right hand to pharaoh
[1:19:22] it's exactly the way jesus was down it
[1:19:24] was david
[1:19:26] went up through the streets of crying
[1:19:28] rejected king and set up on the mountain
[1:19:31] weeping over jerusalem that wasn't david
[1:19:34] the son of david a few hundred years
[1:19:36] after that set on the same hill and wept
[1:19:38] because he was rejected king among his
[1:19:40] own people
[1:19:42] it's christ always and today when it's
[1:19:45] prophesied that christ must come into
[1:19:47] the camp you know what happened it'll be
[1:19:49] just exactly like it was then
[1:19:52] it's got to be that way to fulfill what
[1:19:54] the word here promises he'll do now
[1:19:57] remember christ was in the age of noah
[1:19:59] that was christ jesus christ the same
[1:20:01] yesterday today and forever they
[1:20:03] rejected word of the hour
[1:20:05] notice
[1:20:07] and his prophecy of revelation 3 found
[1:20:10] when he come in this last day as he
[1:20:12] prophesied he had come in this slight
[1:20:14] state and how did he find the church at
[1:20:16] ladies
[1:20:17] rich
[1:20:19] have needed nothing
[1:20:22] and said as a queen
[1:20:24] and casino sorrow
[1:20:26] and putting outside the church
[1:20:29] had no use for him he went without the
[1:20:32] camp again
[1:20:33] but then she didn't know that she was
[1:20:36] naked
[1:20:37] blind and miserable
[1:20:40] and knew it not
[1:20:42] again
[1:20:44] if he come again in the same way as he
[1:20:47] was in
[1:20:48] he would rebuke every woman that wore
[1:20:50] sharks
[1:20:51] he rebuked every bob-haired woman ever
[1:20:54] painted face every man that would be
[1:20:56] little enough to let his wife do that he
[1:20:59] is still standing tear down every
[1:21:00] denomination it was and break up every
[1:21:02] creep we had
[1:21:03] you believe they did it
[1:21:05] you sure would that's right
[1:21:07] what would they do with him put him out
[1:21:09] the camp
[1:21:10] they sure wouldn't cooperate with him no
[1:21:12] sir
[1:21:13] now we find him again and this day as
[1:21:15] the bible said he would
[1:21:17] put out the camp
[1:21:19] for
[1:21:20] he never remains the same the word same
[1:21:24] yesterday and forever
[1:21:26] they
[1:21:28] they don't want him
[1:21:30] they rejected him
[1:21:32] again with their counsel
[1:21:34] they would prefer
[1:21:37] today like they did then when he was on
[1:21:39] trial
[1:21:41] and today when the word is on trial
[1:21:44] what's happened they have rejected again
[1:21:47] like they did then and accepted a bravas
[1:21:51] a murder
[1:21:53] instead of christ
[1:21:54] the council would do the same thing and
[1:21:57] today because they have rejected the
[1:22:00] word and the perfect vindication of the
[1:22:02] hour they have sold out and preferred a
[1:22:06] barabbas the world council of churches
[1:22:08] are murderer of the word
[1:22:11] he denies word denies baptism denies
[1:22:15] power denies signs
[1:22:17] and with the creed our tradition
[1:22:20] again of wearing turnaround collars and
[1:22:22] everything
[1:22:24] making themselves creeds and so forth
[1:22:26] they're trying to upon good works
[1:22:30] they wasn't ordained to life to begin
[1:22:32] with
[1:22:34] they had nothing to believe with
[1:22:37] he that knows me knows my father and as
[1:22:40] the father has sent me so send i you
[1:22:43] the god that sent jesus went in jesus
[1:22:46] and the jesus that sends you goes in you
[1:22:48] he that believeth in me the works and i
[1:22:50] do shall he do also go ye into all the
[1:22:54] world
[1:22:56] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:22:59] black yellow white brown whatever he
[1:23:01] might be
[1:23:02] these signs shall follow and believe
[1:23:05] while for all the world and every
[1:23:07] creature
[1:23:09] a little baptist minister not long ago
[1:23:11] in tucson came to me said brother
[1:23:13] branham here's your trouble you're
[1:23:14] trying to make this an apostolic age he
[1:23:17] said there is no such a thing as
[1:23:18] apostolic age today apostolic age is
[1:23:20] over i said it is i didn't know it
[1:23:23] and he said well it is i said sure he
[1:23:26] said sure i'm sure
[1:23:27] he said all right i said how do you
[1:23:29] think it's over so that was for the
[1:23:30] apostles i said peter said on the day of
[1:23:33] pentecost
[1:23:34] do you believe his word yes sir
[1:23:36] he said repent every one of you
[1:23:39] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:23:41] christ
[1:23:42] for this promise
[1:23:45] isn't to you
[1:23:46] and to your children and to your
[1:23:49] children's children and to them it's for
[1:23:51] all even as many as the lord our god
[1:23:54] shall call this same promise
[1:23:58] we've got to come back to it
[1:24:02] dr simon peter wrote a prescription
[1:24:06] the bible said is there no bomb in
[1:24:09] gilead is there no physician there
[1:24:12] well you know if you take a doctor's
[1:24:14] prescription when he finds the disease
[1:24:16] that's in your body
[1:24:18] and he writes that prescription you
[1:24:20] better fill it get some real drug
[1:24:22] instead of fill it just the way it's
[1:24:24] wrote
[1:24:25] because he has to put in so much poison
[1:24:28] and so much antidote so much that your
[1:24:30] system will take you see
[1:24:32] each it's already been tried and proven
[1:24:35] and you must take that prescription if
[1:24:37] you don't you get some quack doctor to
[1:24:40] go to fooling with that that don't know
[1:24:42] how to measure out that medicine right
[1:24:45] he'll kill you
[1:24:47] and if he puts too much weakness then it
[1:24:48] won't do you no good
[1:24:50] and that's what's the matter a lot of
[1:24:51] you doctors
[1:24:53] you're full with that prescription peter
[1:24:56] said i'll give you everlasting
[1:24:57] prescription
[1:24:58] for you and your children name is for
[1:25:00] all even as many as the lord our god
[1:25:02] shall call not come and join
[1:25:04] but repent every one of you and be
[1:25:07] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:25:09] the remission of sin and you shall
[1:25:11] receive the results
[1:25:14] the holy ghost father promises
[1:25:17] prescriptions for you and to your
[1:25:18] children
[1:25:19] uh some of you quack doctors quit
[1:25:21] writing those fake
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:24] prescriptions you're killing your people
[1:25:28] that's the reason the real thing isn't
[1:25:29] getting to them
[1:25:31] yes
[1:25:32] you know on this same prescription how
[1:25:34] the doctor finds his medicine they
[1:25:36] always taken the scientists trying to
[1:25:38] figure up something then they give it to
[1:25:40] a guinea pig and see if it kills him or
[1:25:42] not
[1:25:43] and then you know medicine's got a
[1:25:45] chance to take you you might get well it
[1:25:47] might kill you
[1:25:48] see because all people are not like
[1:25:50] guinea pigs maybe so but there's one
[1:25:52] thing about this prescription
[1:25:54] it's for all
[1:25:56] and then any real good doctor that got a
[1:25:59] lot of faith in his own medicine he
[1:26:01] won't ask somebody else some of them is
[1:26:03] tired enough to get a prisoner with life
[1:26:05] tournament and set him free if he lives
[1:26:07] over let's take this christian but in
[1:26:08] this place we had a real doctor he come
[1:26:10] took the prescription himself
[1:26:14] i am but i will be i am the resurrection
[1:26:18] and the likes of god
[1:26:20] he didn't believe it to me though he
[1:26:22] were dead yet shall he live and who
[1:26:24] shall ever live and leave it to me shall
[1:26:26] never die hallelujah
[1:26:29] he said leaders out of this she said
[1:26:30] yeah lord i believe that's right the
[1:26:33] christ that was coming to the world no
[1:26:35] matter how much the rest of them call
[1:26:37] you i don't seen it
[1:26:40] the calvary he took the injection
[1:26:42] himself
[1:26:43] and on easter morning that couldn't hold
[1:26:46] him
[1:26:47] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:26:50] they injected death into him but he rose
[1:26:52] up victorious over the death hell in the
[1:26:54] grave amen he took the injection himself
[1:26:58] and he sent out some doctors to write a
[1:27:00] prescription who had the revelation of
[1:27:02] who he was
[1:27:03] who does man say i the son of man am
[1:27:05] peter said the heart of christ the son
[1:27:07] of the living god he said blessed art
[1:27:08] thou simon you've got it now i give you
[1:27:11] the keys of the kingdom whatever you
[1:27:12] abide on earth i'll abide in heaven if
[1:27:14] you loose on earth i loose in heaven and
[1:27:16] on the day of pentecost when they seen
[1:27:18] all this going on he said they said what
[1:27:20] can we do to get this inoculation
[1:27:24] here you read the prescription he said
[1:27:26] now i'm going to write a prescription is
[1:27:28] for you and to your children and to them
[1:27:30] as far off even as many as the lord our
[1:27:31] god shall ever call
[1:27:33] don't fool with the prescription you'll
[1:27:35] die
[1:27:36] they make it so weak today so it's
[1:27:37] nothing but denominational water
[1:27:40] drawings some embalming food
[1:27:43] they checked into a dead man to make him
[1:27:46] deader
[1:27:47] oh but rather there is a genuine one
[1:27:51] anointing there is a thanksgiving
[1:27:56] just for the healing of the
[1:27:58] soul just don't fool with the
[1:28:00] prescription
[1:28:02] take the prescription just the way it's
[1:28:03] written
[1:28:04] and god's obligated to his word
[1:28:07] not obligated to the creed of the dogma
[1:28:09] or the domination he's obligated to his
[1:28:11] word follow the prescription that's the
[1:28:13] first basis
[1:28:14] start off then you're signed up and
[1:28:16] ready go to work
[1:28:17] notice
[1:28:19] out the camp
[1:28:21] they have chosen a barabbas today
[1:28:24] when the gospel has passed back and
[1:28:26] forth around the world
[1:28:28] great signs and wonders as follow the
[1:28:30] revival but instead of coming in and
[1:28:32] trying to do it they're adjoining right
[1:28:34] up with barabbas before we'll have this
[1:28:36] nonsense and so forth in our church
[1:28:38] we'll be classic like the rest of them
[1:28:40] now they've got rome and all of them
[1:28:42] together a barabbas
[1:28:44] notice
[1:28:46] we are then in that great camp we are
[1:28:48] invited to go beyond that kingdom
[1:28:52] jesus also that he might sanctify the
[1:28:54] people with his own blood suffered
[1:28:56] without the gate
[1:28:57] let us go to him beyond the gate
[1:29:00] watch bearing his reproach
[1:29:05] what was he reapproached for
[1:29:08] not because he's methodist or baptist
[1:29:10] i'll assure you that not because his
[1:29:12] pharisee a sadducee because he was the
[1:29:15] vindicated word
[1:29:16] bearing his reproach
[1:29:18] for what the vindicated word
[1:29:21] that's right that's what he did he said
[1:29:23] if i do not the worst of my father don't
[1:29:25] believe me if i'm not to answer all the
[1:29:27] scriptures questions
[1:29:28] jesus of the new testament was jehovah
[1:29:30] of the old
[1:29:32] exactly right
[1:29:33] i believe his eyes tell you you're not
[1:29:35] some time ago or somewhere in a meeting
[1:29:36] it might not have been here
[1:29:38] jehovah of the old testament is jesus of
[1:29:40] the new you remember the re the
[1:29:43] when it's going squirrel hunting that
[1:29:44] morning there it was then three big
[1:29:46] stems running into one out there around
[1:29:47] the mountain me standing there looking
[1:29:48] at it now i drew up close and took off
[1:29:50] my hat laid down my rifle got up there
[1:29:52] and a voice shook the woods
[1:29:55] said jesus of the new testament is
[1:29:56] jehovah of the old remain faithful so
[1:30:00] right below there's where the squirrels
[1:30:01] appeared
[1:30:02] come into existence when there was none
[1:30:04] there
[1:30:06] that's truth
[1:30:08] it's true so god knows before who i
[1:30:11] stand it's a true heart
[1:30:13] it's a tree
[1:30:15] right down in kentucky and there's
[1:30:16] people sitting right here tonight was
[1:30:17] present what happened again the same
[1:30:19] thing
[1:30:20] yes
[1:30:21] we know that it's the truth jesus of the
[1:30:23] old testament like when the chinese
[1:30:26] people first come over here they
[1:30:27] couldn't read or write our language but
[1:30:30] they were great laundry men
[1:30:32] and so they would you go down to the
[1:30:34] chinese laundry he's got him some clear
[1:30:36] little white tags he couldn't read one
[1:30:38] thing
[1:30:39] and he knows you couldn't read it if he
[1:30:41] wrote it so when you come he just took
[1:30:44] this little white piece of paper
[1:30:45] something on this order say right here
[1:30:47] and he tore it a certain way like that
[1:30:50] now he give you one piece of paper
[1:30:52] and he kept the other piece of paper
[1:30:54] and then when you come back for your
[1:30:55] laundry he said let me see your piece of
[1:30:57] paper and he got him if it matched that
[1:31:00] was it
[1:31:01] you got your dirty clothes back clean
[1:31:04] and jesus next every prophecy
[1:31:07] every design of jehovah of the old
[1:31:10] testament
[1:31:11] is jesus of the new
[1:31:14] he matched everything let me say this
[1:31:16] with godly fear and respect but love but
[1:31:19] sincerity and knowing where i'm standing
[1:31:21] the message of this hour has matched
[1:31:23] everything the bible spoken about
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:28] now if you got some dirty clothes turn
[1:31:29] them in
[1:31:33] are you washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:31:36] notice bearing his reproach because he
[1:31:38] was the vindicated word as then so is it
[1:31:42] now he's the same yesterday for every
[1:31:44] hebrew 13
[1:31:45] uh 12 and 13. we find three booze 8 13 8
[1:31:49] also
[1:31:50] bearing his shame
[1:31:51] of the gospel
[1:31:53] bearing his name
[1:31:55] he said i came in my father's name
[1:31:58] what is the name of the father
[1:32:00] it came in his father's name that i came
[1:32:02] in my father's name and you receive me
[1:32:04] not
[1:32:07] well what is the father's name
[1:32:10] i guess you already know
[1:32:14] bearing the reproach of the word
[1:32:17] it was always carried
[1:32:20] out of their camps they turned it out
[1:32:24] you'll be laughed at made fun of
[1:32:26] and today
[1:32:28] or i won't start across the nation not
[1:32:30] speaking about myself
[1:32:32] please don't think this is a personal
[1:32:34] well my time is gone i got about 10
[1:32:36] pages sure you can see what's left
[1:32:39] all right of notes
[1:32:41] but listen
[1:32:44] first started out did you notice jesus
[1:32:46] when he first started oh the young rabbi
[1:32:48] oh he was a wonderful man come over to
[1:32:50] our way come preach to us but one day he
[1:32:53] sat down to them and he said
[1:32:56] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:32:58] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:33:01] in you what do you think the doctors and
[1:33:03] intellectuals of the crowd thought this
[1:33:05] man's a vampire
[1:33:07] he wants you to drink human blood that's
[1:33:09] too much for us get away from this the
[1:33:10] priesthood is crazy i believe it and the
[1:33:13] bible said they walked away then he had
[1:33:15] 70 ordained preachers he said i can't
[1:33:17] have them
[1:33:18] so he looked around at them he said what
[1:33:21] will you say when you see the son of man
[1:33:23] ascending up into heaven from whence he
[1:33:24] come now he never explained these things
[1:33:28] he just let him alone
[1:33:30] and they said son of man what
[1:33:33] we eat with the man we fish with him
[1:33:36] we lay on the banks with him we've seen
[1:33:38] the cradle he was rocked in we know his
[1:33:41] mother we know his brother who can
[1:33:43] receive a thing like this and the bible
[1:33:44] said they walked with him no more
[1:33:47] then he turned around to peter and the
[1:33:49] rest of them said
[1:33:50] a chore was twelve you twelve now from
[1:33:52] the thousands he's down to twelve
[1:33:55] he said i chose twelve of anyone if he's
[1:33:56] the devil
[1:33:57] i knowed it from the beginning
[1:33:59] he said now you wanna go with him
[1:34:03] you didn't have to baby and pet not make
[1:34:05] you deacon if you join the church
[1:34:11] neither could the disciples explain it
[1:34:13] but you remember you just told them i
[1:34:15] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:34:17] world
[1:34:18] i ordained you to receive joy with me
[1:34:22] there it was before the foundation were
[1:34:24] predestinated
[1:34:25] those apostles stood there just
[1:34:27] disturbed they couldn't explain how they
[1:34:29] would eat his flesh and drink his blood
[1:34:30] they couldn't understand how he ever
[1:34:32] come down before he's been right there
[1:34:33] with him all the time he couldn't
[1:34:34] explain it the people couldn't explain
[1:34:36] it nobody could explain it but peter
[1:34:39] made those notable words no wonder he
[1:34:40] gave him the key
[1:34:42] he said lord
[1:34:44] who would we go to
[1:34:46] we are persuaded
[1:34:48] we know that you and your own are the
[1:34:51] vindication of the promised word today
[1:34:53] we know that thou alone has a word of
[1:34:55] life we can't explain those things but
[1:34:57] we believe it anyhow

[1:35:25] she said yeah lord
[1:35:27] i can't explain it but i believe it i
[1:35:30] believe that you're the christ that was
[1:35:31] to come into the world i believe by the
[1:35:33] noted scripture that you beat the
[1:35:35] qualification of that
[1:35:37] so where have you buried him
[1:35:41] something has to happen every wheel's
[1:35:42] coming right together to right time see
[1:35:45] walk down to grade the bible said no
[1:35:46] beauty should which is sorry probably a
[1:35:48] little stupid shoulder fella stood there
[1:35:50] little shoulders down tired and weary
[1:35:52] from walking
[1:35:53] he said lazarus come forward
[1:35:57] and a man had been dead four days stood
[1:35:59] on his feet
[1:36:01] a christian science woman excuse me if i
[1:36:03] hurt your feelings i don't mean to a
[1:36:04] christian science woman right from this
[1:36:06] church met me out there one day and she
[1:36:08] said mr branham she said i like your
[1:36:09] preaching but there's one thing you do
[1:36:11] too much of on it so watch that said you
[1:36:13] bragged too much on jesus i said i hope
[1:36:15] that's all he's got to get asleep
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:20] she said you make him divine see they
[1:36:22] don't believe he was divine they believe
[1:36:23] he was just an ordinary man good teacher
[1:36:25] philosopher said you make him divine and
[1:36:27] he wasn't divine i said oh yes he was
[1:36:30] she said if i prove to you by your own
[1:36:32] bible he's not divine but you believe it
[1:36:33] i said my bible said so i believe the
[1:36:35] word that's who he is
[1:36:36] and she said in saint john the 11th
[1:36:38] chapter when jesus went down to the
[1:36:40] grave of lazarus the bible said he wept
[1:36:43] i said well that's got to do with it
[1:36:45] she said well that showed he wasn't
[1:36:46] divine i said you just fail to see who
[1:36:48] the man was he was both god and man
[1:36:51] is the man weeping when he's weeping for
[1:36:53] their sorrow but when he stood and said
[1:36:55] lazarus come forth and a man had been
[1:36:58] dead four days stood on his feet again
[1:36:59] that was more than a man
[1:37:01] yes sir
[1:37:03] yes indeed never made the expression
[1:37:05] when he come down off the mountain that
[1:37:07] night hungry he was a man he was hungry
[1:37:09] the next morning he was a man but when
[1:37:10] he took two biscuits and five fish and
[1:37:13] fed five thousand thickened up seven
[1:37:14] baskets that was more than a man
[1:37:18] he was a man on the cross when he cried
[1:37:20] my god has not forsaken me when he cried
[1:37:23] give me a drink and he gave him vinegar
[1:37:25] and gall he was a man crying but on
[1:37:27] easter morning when he broke every seal
[1:37:29] of death hell in the grave
[1:37:32] he was more than a man he was a man that
[1:37:35] night laying on the back of that little
[1:37:36] boat where he's out there with the
[1:37:38] disciples and ten thousand devils of the
[1:37:40] sea swore they drowned him
[1:37:42] out there in a little ship like a bottle
[1:37:44] stopper out there like that he was so
[1:37:45] tired didn't wake him up he was a man
[1:37:47] when he was asleep but when he put his
[1:37:49] foot on the braille the boat looked up
[1:37:50] at peace be still and the winds and the
[1:37:52] waves go baby that was more than a man
[1:37:58] oh one of the poets said
[1:37:59] he loved me dying he saved me very he
[1:38:03] carried my sins far away rising he
[1:38:06] justified freely forever someday he's
[1:38:08] coming on glorious days
[1:38:10] yes sir
[1:38:11] go beyond the camp i don't care what it
[1:38:14] costs this consecrated cross i'll bear
[1:38:17] until death shall set me free
[1:38:19] then go home a crown to where for
[1:38:22] there's a crown for me
[1:38:24] posing i'll say this
[1:38:26] i was reading a story some time ago on a
[1:38:28] judge
[1:38:29] he's a just man a good man
[1:38:31] love
[1:38:32] and there's a bunch of people in the
[1:38:34] city that thought they could get by with
[1:38:35] anything so he had plenty so they opened
[1:38:38] up a house of hill fame run a liquor
[1:38:39] store liquor everything like that it was
[1:38:42] illegal and it was caught by the law of
[1:38:44] the federal man and was brought to court
[1:38:47] and when all the people of city the
[1:38:48] little city gathered in they know this
[1:38:50] man had done a lot of things around
[1:38:52] there the man that had run the ill-famed
[1:38:54] place
[1:38:55] and they they the jury found the man
[1:38:57] guilty because he's called open-handed
[1:39:00] and so then
[1:39:02] the judge
[1:39:03] found him guilty and sentenced them
[1:39:07] for so many years without bomb without
[1:39:10] appeal or anything he sent him because
[1:39:12] that's what the law read
[1:39:13] the people outside the court raised him
[1:39:15] and said you know what
[1:39:17] every person in this town hates you
[1:39:20] said they hate you by making that
[1:39:22] decision on that man there was all
[1:39:24] gamblers themselves and said we we'll
[1:39:27] all hate you we'll never elect you again
[1:39:30] we'll never be on one of his football
[1:39:32] you boo and him as he went down the
[1:39:33] street he stood just a minute and said
[1:39:35] let me have a word
[1:39:37] he said i've done exactly what was my
[1:39:39] duty
[1:39:40] the man was guilty no matter who he was
[1:39:43] and i had to sentence him according to
[1:39:45] the law that i swore i'd uphold
[1:39:50] he said you're hated in this town
[1:39:52] he said but i'm loved greatly at home
[1:39:55] by my people
[1:39:58] we might think the same thing if your
[1:39:59] pardon expression
[1:40:01] i stood for what i have been saved to do
[1:40:04] uphold this word of god
[1:40:06] i know the denominations hate me for the
[1:40:08] things that i say but i'm greatly loved
[1:40:10] in his house
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:14] [Applause]
[1:40:23] hey ma'am
[1:40:26] you know i
[1:40:27] i
[1:40:29] felt moved to play this and
[1:40:32] of course then you know the
[1:40:34] devil's always there
[1:40:37] and
[1:40:38] so i went to my books and
[1:40:41] i have my books there and
[1:40:43] they're not in order
[1:40:45] and i just reached there and i grabbed
[1:40:47] the book and pulled it out
[1:40:50] and i thought i know this is the right
[1:40:52] thing
[1:40:53] for those of you that are going to camp
[1:40:56] i played this because
[1:40:59] i want you to go beyond the camp
[1:41:04] there's going to be meeting and
[1:41:06] there's going to be fellowship and
[1:41:09] there's going to be
[1:41:11] personalities and
[1:41:13] social events and
[1:41:15] but i want you to go beyond this
[1:41:18] social activity
[1:41:21] i want you to go beyond
[1:41:23] the programs and the plays
[1:41:27] i want you to go beyond the music and
[1:41:29] the
[1:41:30] specials
[1:41:32] and i want you to go beyond the camp
[1:41:37] so there's a camp going on
[1:41:40] but you've got to go beyond that camp
[1:41:44] and meet god personally
[1:41:48] and what happens in camps is trends are
[1:41:51] set
[1:41:52] trends in music and trends in worship
[1:41:56] and
[1:41:56] trends and
[1:41:58] preaching style and and
[1:42:01] trends in this and trends and that
[1:42:04] and and there's tastes
[1:42:06] that are formed we like it preach this
[1:42:09] way we like it
[1:42:11] i like to hear it this way i like this
[1:42:14] and i like that
[1:42:16] and you got to go beyond all that
[1:42:18] you've got to go beyond that camp
[1:42:21] and you you felt the spirit of unity
[1:42:24] tonight you felt the word of god being
[1:42:27] broke by the voice that god chose to
[1:42:31] break it
[1:42:34] he talked in this message
[1:42:36] about
[1:42:37] the prophet and what was said and that's
[1:42:40] where the spirit of god was
[1:42:43] and i say you've got to go beyond the
[1:42:45] camp this weekend
[1:42:47] beyond the music beyond the
[1:42:50] the the trend
[1:42:52] and and don't settle for anything less
[1:42:57] until
[1:42:59] you and god and his spoken word
[1:43:04] and his written word
[1:43:08] do you have a relationship with it
[1:43:11] not the worship not the church not the
[1:43:14] personalities not the pastor
[1:43:17] but you have
[1:43:19] gone beyond the camp
[1:43:21] and
[1:43:22] and we heard tonight as a congregation
[1:43:25] we'll never go any farther with god till
[1:43:28] we can go beyond all
[1:43:30] our camp
[1:43:31] and i want to go farther with god don't
[1:43:34] you i want to go beyond the camp so lord
[1:43:36] richly bless you tonight we won't keep
[1:43:39] you long i know you have to get up early
[1:43:42] and be back here for camp i know some of
[1:43:44] you want to practice
[1:43:46] your songs so this is
[1:43:50] as
[1:43:51] our flock runs
[1:43:53] over
[1:43:55] the word of the lord in my heart to you
[1:43:57] is go beyond the camp
[1:44:00] go beyond the camp
[1:44:01] amen go to that place you have to go
[1:44:04] alone too
[1:44:06] where you have to get out of yourself
[1:44:09] and your own ideas
[1:44:10] and settle it once and for all
[1:44:14] it doesn't have to be a shout it doesn't
[1:44:16] the people will worship and you'll be
[1:44:19] praising god and that's all wonderful
[1:44:22] i'm not against those things some people
[1:44:24] think i am but i'm i'm against it when
[1:44:27] it becomes a camp
[1:44:29] and you don't go any farther
[1:44:32] so let's go beyond the camp this coming
[1:44:34] week
[1:44:35] easter week
[1:44:37] and that's what he said
[1:44:39] he was man
[1:44:41] but when he rose on that morning
[1:44:44] he was god
[1:44:45] and that's what we serve so let's stand
[1:44:47] together
[1:44:52] and
[1:44:53] let's just power ahead and give us all
[1:44:55] an opportunity
[1:44:57] this evening in your heart
[1:45:00] tonight i know you rejoiced in god's
[1:45:02] word
[1:45:04] but if you would look in your heart
[1:45:06] tonight and you would like to go farther
[1:45:09] and maybe you've set up a little camp in
[1:45:11] your life a comfort zone
[1:45:14] something that you're comfort with just
[1:45:18] just a style of life everyday living
[1:45:21] that
[1:45:22] it just seems to be in the routine
[1:45:26] and you if god would speak to you you'd
[1:45:28] want to lift your hand and say lord i
[1:45:29] want to be able to go beyond the camp
[1:45:32] when you call i want to be able to
[1:45:35] leave
[1:45:38] i want to do what you
[1:45:40] would have me to do no matter what it is
[1:45:44] lord i i desire in my heart not to be
[1:45:47] stuck in a rut
[1:45:50] our prophet said they went back and got
[1:45:52] into the same old rut
[1:45:55] lord i don't want this message to get
[1:45:57] into the same old rut
[1:45:59] i want us to go on in the power and the
[1:46:02] resurrection of easter morning
[1:46:05] in that personal relationship
[1:46:08] father because there was a voice in this
[1:46:10] day that pointed us to christ
[1:46:13] and we've got to go beyond that father
[1:46:16] to that
[1:46:17] place of
[1:46:19] personal
[1:46:22] lord it's not a group experience
[1:46:26] it's an individual revelation
[1:46:30] and i ask each young person
[1:46:34] father our own adults that are going and
[1:46:37] listening to the preaching
[1:46:40] may they know there's a camp
[1:46:44] and there's a shout in the camp
[1:46:47] but may they know deep in their heart
[1:46:49] they have to go beyond that
[1:46:52] they have to go into the holy of holies
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] and eat that manna
[1:47:00] and be persuaded where else can we go
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] this message and this word
[1:47:07] is the words of eternal life
[1:47:11] until it's so anchored in their soul
[1:47:15] that my sheep hear my voice
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:19] and another
[1:47:21] they will not follow
[1:47:23] father i ask you to keep our
[1:47:26] church safe in their travel and
[1:47:29] the other churches that are
[1:47:31] fellowshipping with us here this evening
[1:47:34] on their way to the same camp
[1:47:37] may they too go beyond the camp
[1:47:41] father because that's words to every
[1:47:43] camp goer
[1:47:47] to go beyond the camp
[1:47:51] and lord i just ask that you keep them
[1:47:53] safe
[1:47:57] that you speak to them
[1:47:58] [Music]
[1:47:59] father that they feel your forgiveness
[1:48:04] they feel your love and they feel your
[1:48:06] care
[1:48:08] they hear your instructions father
[1:48:11] as you deal with them
[1:48:13] and may they slip away father to that
[1:48:15] quiet place
[1:48:18] and go beyond all the noise and all the
[1:48:20] shouting
[1:48:22] and come to that place where they meet
[1:48:24] you face to face
[1:48:25] and they meet christ
[1:48:27] we ask it father that you would grant
[1:48:30] that
[1:48:31] in jesus precious and
[1:48:34] wonderful name
[1:48:36] we pray
[1:48:40] oh
