you in the power of your Resurrection not a god of 2,000 years ago but a god of the present right now here with us in our midst Lord and we know right now we are standing in a place where all things are possible to them that believe and because we've received a perfect word Lord we can believe all things because faith comes by the hearing of that word Lord may we climb up into higher Heights this evening may you just move amongst us Lord you know the questions in our heart you know the needs in our body amongst our family Lord you know the trials that are up ahead Lord we don't know them but you do if we're walking with you Lord then what does it matter because you hold it all in your hands so we love you Lord I pray you just come take the little notes and scriptures and quotes that we might have pulled together Lord just trusting in your leadership we need you to come though Lord and to take them and to rightly divide them and to minister to your bride Lord and to just with whisper those love secrets to her may we all move past the Realms of the flesh Lord and enter into that spiritual realm Lord where we can just look past the veil tonight and see you standing amongst your people again the same yesterday today and forever we love you Lord we pray that you just come and break the bread of life as only you can we pray this now in your name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's just turn in uh The Book of John chapter 20 sure enjoyed the word uh this morning uh we we certainly have something uh to be excited about something to Rejoice about something that stabilized us uh something that has anchored us we don't have to be tossed to and fro into uh run after some new movement or some flash in the pan but when you know what you got you're not looking for something something else I mean when you when you found it if you've ever been well I'm just going to start preaching before we ever get to our text well when when when you've been looking for something and you find it you know if you're going to buy a car if you're going to buy a house and you finally find the one you know if if any of you have ever fallen in love and got married I found the one I'm not looking for another it it it case closed it it's all over with well when you when you come in contact with the message of the hour no more looking no more running I ain't got eyes for nothing else out there it's him and him alone and this revealed word of the hour that's all I need hey he's my hope he's my stay it's my all and all all my eggs are in one basket wherever this message takes me I'm going praise the Lord just reading out of John chapter 20 and we're going to read uh verse 21 uh through 23 says then Jesus said unto them now and maybe we just back a little bit just to give a little um uh show where this is taking place uh it says then the in verse 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you so look at the condition that they were in they were fearful they were afraid they were the the doors were shut and he says peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto him them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained we just ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated also if you'll just turn in your Bible with me uh over into Revelations uh chapter 22 we'll read a familiar uh scripture there as well everybody comfortable you enjoying the the extra space and the air condition and the nice clean pews I pray we can keep them that way amen just reading out of uh Revelation uh chapter 22 now and verse uh 17-9 it reads and the spirit and the bride say come let him that of thirst and let let him that heareth say come and let him that a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen so uh just in in reading that uh scripture it says the spirit and the bride say come there's an invitation that is going out and the spirit and the bride they are saying the same thing they're saying come what is the invitation what are we inviting people to and it's by the revelation of the hour that we start to understand the hour that we're living in and what the invitation is and what we're being called out of we're being called out of the denominational all all the the shuck has pulled away the the hour of the restoration of the gifts and the Revival that broke out through the country from 1906 and and was moving down in those early age and and I believe William Seymour and and all of those wonderful things there was a great Revival and a great move that was going on and and it had to be that way because there was going to come the spoken word The Original Seed was going to come uh and manifest itself in the middle of That Shook and as that word would be become manifested that Shu would start to pull away and he would start to identify look that the Revival is over uh uh everything that was catching their attention the restoration of the gifts and and the speaking in tongues and all of those things that was taking place the prophet of God comes along and he says look uh uh those things that caught your attention and and everything that you you you know uh that you're you're looking for that that's dead we're now entering into another age so there was a lot of people a as the years went on they were they were trying to get back to that same Revival kind of to see see the restoration of the gifts and that fire just burning up again but here stands a prophet telling them look that Revival's over it's gone you you're you're fasting and praying for something to come upon the church but the spirit of God is moving on we're moving into a different age I just draw your attention as we're just uh trusting that God would just take us and and and lead us according to his leadership of the Holy Spirit but if you just jump into uh uh the scriptures and you start to look what uh uh the prophet of God would say in the third seal he would say the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now now I think that's a profound thing right there to look and see here's the prophet of God standing in 1963 and he's telling the church he's stand there say look there's been no manifestation to stir the bride yet there's been no Revival for the bride I sit back there and I look at that and I start to wonder what do you mean brother brandom the blind eyes were open the dead had been raised uh the first pull was in manifestation by there you were you the spirit of God was taking people by the hand and and telling them of their problems and then the second pull came in the Discerning of the thoughts and intents of the heart you you would think my what what a stirring what a Revival that would have been what of an attraction that would have been but now he's standing there and he's preaching the third seal and he's saying the bride hasn't had a Revival yet okay so what he's doing the prophet of God is now showing you that I'm I'm going to show you where we're at in time as our as our pastor was talking about this morning I want to show you where we're at in time what what are we looking for what is it going to take what what what is what are you what are you hungering for what are you thirsting for are you fasting and you're praying and you're longing for some great Revival and you want to see the manifestation of the gifts and all of those things sure they have been re stored to the church they are present amongst us we have to have those things because it was part of the restoration right he was Resto he didn't restore it back to take it out but you see there was an age when the restoration came into the church but now once that's been satisfied now I I I just have to say it like it is is now think if you're restoring a car right if if if you got a hunk of metal there and it's it's been all Tor down and and chopped off down to the ground and now you're going to start restoring it back what are you going to do you're going to start banging out the metal you're going to straighten it out you're going to start getting the frame right you're going to start getting back in the the the seats and getting it all set up and and you're going to rewire and get it all all the electricity put back in it just right you're going to get the wheels on it and I imagine when it finally takes shape and you look at him like my goodness does that look like a 1967 chevel doesn't it look good well yeah but let's take a look at it like oh you know no I I the outside looks good but I haven't gotten the battery in and I haven't got the alternator in yet oh okay oh oh what are you doing I'm restoring it see right now it's starting to take form it's starting to take shape of what it once was but see I'm in the process of restoring it back to what it once was so now when you start to put in the battery and you start to put in the radio and you start to get everything and you get in there you're like H H Ho Ho Hey W the horn works all right now why don't you try the radio this is krld D all right we got the radio you work in my and you'll start to Rejoice you'll start to be thankful because where you're at in the process of restoration now you're thankful because in the season in the Revival if that's what the Sheep music's calling for oh here we're in the process of restoration and this is when the battery goes in this is when the alternator goes in this is when the radio starts to work then you're in tune to look for these things to go into action so now the radio's working the batter's charged the alternators in but now when it comes time to start that thing I understand the radio works when we get in to start the vehicle don't say well brother Matthew look the radio works we can honk our horn I know I can honk my horn I'll honk my horn every single day I'mma turn on the music and I'm going to Rejoice it's already there it's good to be reminded turn it on honk the horn but that ain't gonna take you anywhere it's we need it it got to be there it's part of the restoration but now when it comes time that you got to turn that key how many have ever worked on a car and you you replace this and you replace that and it comes down the Moment of Truth well yeah you're not having a Revival because the horn Works you're not having a Revival because the alternator and the battery works hey we got fire in this thing now why why are you getting excited because it's come time it's come the hour that the Dynamics got to come into the mechanics because I want to tell you you can toot your horn you can turn on the radio but that ain't going to take you nowhere there got to come a time when the Dynamics comes upon the mechanic and it gets time ready to go you can sit in the garage and you can listen to the radio you can toot your hor but when it comes time to go to the grocery store do you got gas in the tank do you got spark to make that thing run so now what are we looking for but brother brother random is pointed out and recognizing your day in his message he says but they hardly will print anything unless it's about fast prey fast prey sound the trumpet how many reads it you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray it's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day they're looking for something because they've also experienc something and because what they experience they're looking for some similar thing right they're saying fast prayer we we've seen the revivals we've seen the healing campaigns we've seen the move we've seen the Great of God that people are waning they're getting worse and worse they're waxing cold we got to pray for a Revival now the prophet is starting to identify a Revival to the age he's not trying to take the individual Revival from the church we got to live in Revival we got to constantly live in Revival we got to never let the spirit of Revival die oh you got to walk in Revival and what is the brid's Revival Hallelujah well let's just hear it from a prophet fast pray all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great break in of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're we're not too late yet why do they do that now don't dismiss this to an age gone by why do we do that let's let it hit home why are we needing to fast and pray why are we looking for something to come we're looking for some uh uh manifestations or some quotes uh and placing them out there in the future and we're saying oh when this happens then I will when this happens then we we should when there comes a squeeze well how much do you want to be squeezed I don't know about you I'm kind of feeling squeezed I don't fit in out there I go to the grocery store I don't fit in at the grocery store everywhere I go it just seems like there's a great press there's a great squ does anybody like it out there you fit in really well it's a pressure I don't know about you but I I feel like there's man let me dig a ditch for 10 hours but go to the mall for one hour I'm whooped he Christmas time and stuff you're going through the mall you come out you're like what what's the ma what's the matter with me well you've been fighting 200,000 th demons walking through the mall you didn't know that but your angels and the spirit of God is like I got your back I got your back turn your head look here go here stop that watch this hey if we were sensitive to what's going on in the Supernatural realm around us as our pastor was saying we need a shaking we we see what's going on in Israel we see what's going in all around us why do they do that why do we do that they want a Great Awakening if I may may just say maybe they're they're wanting a great Revival they're crying believing that there will be an Awakening they good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognize the Awakening of the Bride so so he says by being a Christian they feel the pul of the hour and they have not a recognizing what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they it something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happening right by you if you're not careful that same Spirit gets on us we start looking for some manifestation down the road to come and we're failing to realize the Revival we're failing to realize the Awakening that this bride is now living in there ain't no no greater Revival there ain't no greater Awakening that's ever going to strike the face of this Earth but the bride's Revival that is taking right place by the word it's not a Revival or some TR attraction from an age gone by but it is a word Revival and what is this word Revival well let's get it from the mouth of a prophet he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet we're back into the third seal there's been no Revival there no manifestation uh to stir the bride yet I tell you tell you what that makes me happy cuz sometimes I feel like I missed it sometimes I wanted to be back there in the healing campaigns and I wanted to see the spirit of God and the prophet say there goes the L Goos right there there goes the pillar of fire back there oh I would have Lov I would love to see all those things but then now what he's he's doing he's taking the church further he's taking us into what another age we're now moving out of the man age an intellectual Revival an intellectual revival can only take you so far but now we're moving into the bride age we're moving into the bride's Revival he says there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride so that means there's something coming to stir you Hallelujah that means there's something coming to stir you well what is I want to be stirred anybody want to be stirred I want my heart to be stirred what's this Great Awakening what is he talking about are they still in my thunder up there they sure are it's all right it's good it's good to it's good to have an open book test Hallelujah we got an open book test what is it going to take got an open book a ain't no secrets around here I'm not the eighth Messenger right you got thus sayith the Lord I was fellowship with a brother not too long ago we were talking about speaking in tongues and and all these things sure uh speaking in tongues is a gift that God has restored back to the church and there's people with with the gift and it's in operation well why don't we see it so often why don't we see so many of these things well I can't speak for the church I can't speak for the age I can only speak for myself and I know I already got thus sayith the Lord that's right there ain't no Mysteries there ain't no secrets I got thus sayth the Lord I got Malachi 4:5 the Lord himself is here amen but God by his grace with those gifts in the church if if there's something going to happen and and sometimes you might hear it as a pronouncing of of blessings and those things are wonderful that can encourage somebody and uplift them and I say praise God that is wonderful we we we've had uh Christ himself come down and say you are The Virtuous bride without spot or wrinkle you never did it it's encouraging Hallelujah and if he wants to uh as he if if I could say as the prophet would have said it in order and there would be that maturity in the church and Gifts would be in operation and done according to the order that God called it he might say uh brother Matthew in two days you'll be going down this way there's going to be a tree that's going to fall out and you're going you you're going to want to look for this and that and this is going to take place okay I can't find that in black and white print I can pour through the message like where does that say surely Way Bedford Texas tree in the middle of the road right if God wants to operate in that capacity praise God we believe in those things and certainly when those things were being restored to the church we were tooting our horns we were blaring the radio it was a wonderful thing and we need all those things God placed them in the car so the car could operate and go down the road and I rejoice in those things but I want this thing to be able to run when it comes time to leave I want to go in a Rapture I'm to be caught up in the brid's Revival and what is the brides Revival we'll finish this eventually he said there's been no Revival there so you you ain't Miss nothing you ain't missed nothing Brother Gary oh he said there's been no Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again see yeah he'll send it he promised now watch so you move on up that 63 March as he's breaking the seals and and that quote we read was a recognizing his day in 64 and he's saying look everybody is looking for something that's already here look no further church it's here what did the scripture say it said the Lord himself shall descend if the Lord himself is going to descend we have a promise in the scripture that says God will do nothing but what he Reveals His Secrets unto His prophets his servants so then if the Lord himself is going to descend that means there's going to be a Prophet come on the seat and say hey the Lord himself is going to descend look at that scripture the Lord himself the Lord himself not a prophet not something other than the Lord himself shall descend so what is the prophet standing there preaching the Rapture preaching the unveiling of God preaching the seals he's showing us that the Lord himself is descending to you now so much so that he would take the picture and say what was that turn it to your right that's our Lord up there showing us what was the Rapture the Lord shall descend with a shout he does all three while he is descending what is he declaring to you he's declaring to you the thing that's going to wake this bride up what is it going to shake you what is it that's going to get you in line what is it that's going to get you in a rapturing condition it's going to be the revealed word of the hour there's no other way there's no other method I don't care how many camps and and how many churches run around the whole world go to this conviction the convention go to the 12 steps of alcohol do whatever all these things they're going to be wonderful helps they might be a place where you meet God it might start Revival in your life there's only one thing and if they're preaching the unadulterated word of the hour then it's going to be a word Revival I'm glad we got some men in this message that aren't afraid to declare unto you that God has sent a prophet according to Malachi 4:5 and his name is William Mariam brandom and God used that vessel as he descended down and used them like a microphone and spoke through his mouth to the bride to awaken her and to shake her into a Revival Ral the greatest Revival the world that has ever seen and one of these days it's going to change your body Hallelujah you're going to be changed you're going to be walking along I'm going to look over on my days David it's on H it's on what it's the change why because I've been gathered under the shout oh Hallelujah I like my horn working I like to play my radio but when them bombs get ready to drop out y I need something more than to be able to toot my horn I need something more than a radio I need some 1,000 octane power to be able to turn that key and say let's go home Hallelujah I don't know about you that makes me excited people get excited about race cars you ever been in one of them M it's fast it'll cause an ad drillin rush like Whoa man this thing got got that much power he got that much power what about this message you want to talk about something that has power this message got power I don't know where we're at and where we're going but I tell you what this message gots power this message is full of power and that's what we're inviting you to we're inviting you to the Dynamics that have come to the mechanics that that is going to make this car go down the road I need something that can change my life I need something that can bring this flesh into subjection I hate this bag of bones I need deliverance from this bag of bones I don't like it I don't like how it defies the word I don't like it how it's attracted to the things of the world I need a message that works I need a God that is real oh God come and change me I need the Dynamics to come upon the mechanic of this word which I believe with all of my heart and make it live push me down the road lord it's going on time I want to see this word living and in action it's wapt your time it's going home time what are you living for what is it going to take to shake some of us God forbid what is it going to take for you to get in rapturing condition you're going to have to lose your health you're going to have to lose a loved one God forbid God going to have to take your life cuz you won't get into condition I don't know one thing I know is We Got Tonight I hear the combine call coming it's harvest time do you hear it do you see it it's it's already coming it's already thres in the weak it's Gathering up there's a missiles are being shot over in Israel what is it going to take no it's not going to take some outside force prophet of God said National Force isn't going to put you there National Force did put Israel in his homeland but it's going to be what it's going to be the power of God that put you in the bride I'm trying to find something what are what are we inviting people to what are if the spirit and the bride is saying come what are you inviting them to we we were just reev inviting him to another denomination are we just inviting him to another uh uh Revival with the same likeness of an old Revival no no why why that's why our pastor and the Propet takes the time to say look that Revival's gone it's over sure we might see some of the manifestations sure uh we might have a church Revival and a setting to where the power of God moves in a tremendous way and we need those things it's part of the restoration it's part of a church up a local church uh having a Revival those things are wonderful the prophet of God said the local church isn't dependent on local Reign you got to have your own Revival you got to have something that's sustaining you the Lord himself shall descend we have heard the message of the hour God declaring that he is here well I don't know where we're at so we'll just try to keep preaching but we read the scripture out of John now we're just going to start preaching for a little bit in John chapter 20 he says then peace be unto you as the father sent me even so I send you and when he said this he breathed on them and said to them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained look it's going to take the bride of Christ to say come we have to give people an opportunity that which has been freely given give it the the the the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing come out from amongst Tre might people are you still preaching that that's your message to tell your co-workers to tell your friend to tell your mother your father your brother your sister your teammates right that's your message is to go out there and tell them to come out of them my people and be separated from all the nonsense out there what did the prophet of God said he said it's too much nonsense too much Hollywood too much TV I think that's all crept in to the church that we' become complacent that we think we're going to go in a Rapture because we go to a message Church sorry about it the fruits of the spirit better be on display in your life how do you know them by their fruits just look at how they dress and how they carry themselves if they're aspiring to be like the the world and and they're trying all these little uh uh gimmicks and tricks to to make them look like the world so they look better on Instagram and and can pucker their lips and look all Rosy and everything something wrong wake up children of God something wrong you're being influenced by something something's put a hook in you and it's pulling you the wrong way I say if there be any any anything in you that wants to be like God say God forgive me I hear the man of God and I say forgive me I've messed up time and time again and here I am I'm walking down the same trail and I didn't think I would back be back here and here you are again you're walking right into the same trapped thinking everything's Rosy and peachy just because you got some stamp of approval on it you better watch out you'll get hooked you better get the Holy Ghost well it's it's it Grieves my soul to see so many young people getting married in our churches without the Holy Ghost many many of them and they go through trials and heartache and they bring things into their marriage that they never should have because they never died to the old nature and now their their marriage has been scarred and they're coming for counseling and they're bringing things into their marriage to try to make it work because they were trying to satisfy a fleshly hunger with with some virtuous Act of marriage and it'll never suffice you'll have to get the victory over that thing of eventually so why not get it now that you can come into a union with your husband or your wife in total Victory not five or eight years down the road saying honey I didn't have what I thought I did oh he have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the church it's Rapture time it's going home time it's time to get in order it's time to get our our life right has the father sent me so I send you well what does that look like it looks like the ability to take the word take the message of the hour things that are to be flashing red light so the sign of his coming the unveiling of God there's a man here that can turn on the light it is the rising of The Sun It's the Easter seal the Mighty God unveiled before us this day this scripture is fulfilled why can you say it for the spirit of the Lord is upon me he has anointed me to take the book he has anointed me to take the message of the hour and make it live I was predestinated I wasn't born back in the 40s and 50s and 60s because God had a purpose for me I'm in a place you right at the very end and just as the father sent me I'm going to send you I'm going to anoint you to take the book and eat it up thou must prophesy again you got to be anointed Church you got to have the fruits of the spirit you got to be walking in Victory we got to shake ourselves is that where you're living you see the life of the Prophet you see his ability in that prophetic minute to take the book to to reveal are we in a place where we know according to our position what hour as our Pro Pastor would say what hour are we living in where are we at what should we be manifesting in this hour prophet of God said his bride is the anointed one for this day I've been laboring out of the church age book how he said he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time that's what I'm wanting just to minister on to you is that part of that bride's Ministry and and my subject is the spirit and the bride say come he said in John 1:12 he says but as many received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name power to become all of the potential is there God put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be now we want to encourage you here a little bit see Satan hates that Satan hates the law of the seed he hates the spoken word is the Original Seed I imagine as he was sitting there and watching Adam and Eve go he's like I got in and all of a sudden he said wait I'll put enmity between thy seed between the serpent seed in the seat of the woman he knew oh no he spoke it he's been looking for that thing he thought he had it in Abel he he thought he had it in the prophets he thought he had him on Calvary he thought he finally got him when he stuck that Stinger into him said I finally got that one that was prophesied to bring the victory over my kingdom but what on the third day he rose again the mighty conqueror I want to ask you where is the mighty conqueror now where is he where is he it's Qui as Revival I've ever seen in my life it's okay you ain't got to be allowed to have a Revival I'm I'm thankful to that this ain't no public show that's why I can act crazy and I don't I can just do it by myself it don't matter I know where I came from and where I'm going I'm happy about you want to join in with me join in with me if you don't oh hey I mean it's okay it's all right I'll just look like a fool for my Jesus but you're going to look like a fool for somebody right you're going to dance out in the world and dress out in the world and do all these things out in the world and you're going to holler at the ball games and do all these things but when you're when you're a p of the greatest thing that ever happens you know we we seem to hold our peace but that's okay some of us just need to shake off them uh uh heavy bands and lift up those holy hands start living in Revival start recognizing the hour that we're now living in because all the potential is there and I want to say if Satan was trying to stop him but he couldn't and if he couldn't stop him can he stop you because you are that Original Seed and if he couldn't stop that Original Seed then where did you come from where do you came from the Original Seed the spoken word and nothing can defeat that word therefore he can't stop you Jesus would say say blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake but rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you look the devil can try to ruin your testimony and some of you feel like he has you feel like he got me he hit me and I can't recover this this blow is too much for me I'm going to bear this Mark the rest of my life he he got me I've fallen down I've been hurt I've been wounded I don't know how to bear this reproach before the church before my parents I don't know how I can live with this I've been wounded yes the Devil he's a good adversary he's there to take shots at you he's there to try to ruin your testimony but I got good news for you the only thing the devil can do I repeat the only thing the devil can do can you hear me out there the only thing the devil can do is give you more to testify about hallelujah what the only thing the devil can do is to give you more to tell well then come on somebody maybe you've been praying for a prodal maybe you've been praying for healing maybe you've been wondering how long you're going to fight this battle I just want to tell you that battle's there for only one reason that you're going to be able to testify the H devil you tried to take me out you tried to take my daughter you tried to take my son but you can't have them God give them to me and I'm taking them back you might as well start testifying now God give me my son God give me my daughter he gave me my wife he give me my family well why can you say that brother Matthew well we'll get to this eventually oh we got some good stuff in here well we're just going to have to hit this now we'll see what happens notes are only good for some things so the prophet of God says this he says in the uh this is a lengthy reading but we're going to move towards something this is the last warning there will not be another that's right what's your message Church the spirit of the Bride say come hey this is a warning there's not going to be another one this is the last warning there will not be another oh I like this just think about this now go ahead and turn that off I I want to dramatize this people get ahead of me go ahead and shut that off if you can do it up here forgive me interpretate it I I'll go slow so you'll like that miracles do happen this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells the story of Amazing Grace and Jesus loved she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy well that does something to me are you hearing them are you hearing what God's telling telling you there's a city prepared for you it's you hear in the description it's there and soon very soon I know you're going through some trials I know you're going through some heartaches I know you're going through them to difficulties but look you realize what's about to happen and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but thank God at this moment this age is not over he is yet crying and his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by his Spirit but once again a prophet is in the Land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul in the days of the seventh messenger and the days of the lady of and age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry we'll get back to that and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day who are mentioned in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come how are we going to get out of here what is it going to take those who receive the prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of the Bride of the last day and those that hear him will be blessed and become part of the Bride in the last days who are mentioned in Revelations 2217 the spirit and the brides say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at niasa has come back to original word grain again praise God forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing there's your witness Hallelujah don't add anything to this message and don't take anything away from it don't take my Revival don't take the restoration but please don't add anything I don't need anything added and I don't need anything taken away it is [Applause] perfect it's perfect and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be you separated the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know oh I love what I love what our Pastor said this morning he made he showed how that the emphasis was not so much on when but on your condition to be ready oh I love that if you're ready what does it matter when right the problem is is we're so slothful you know what all of us would do oh well the coming of the Lord is in 2026 I got plenty of time I'll just live on that no we don't know when we don't know what hour but are you ready you're not guaranteed 2026 you're not guaranteed tomorrow the question is is are you ready are you ready are are are you ready some of us think we're ready why don't you do inventory in your life what you're giving your time and your attention to come on think about it now think about the things you've been talking about the entertainment the picture you've been looking at things you've been watching let's take a little inventory real quick and how many of them just you're you're ready to go I wonder how many of us if you ever if something some Calamity was about to strike you say Lord forgive me I just want to make sure everything's right don't let the sun go down upon your wrath let's make everything right right now Church let's get in a Rapture condition right now let's say what the prophet said let's say what the spirit says and what they're saying has already been said in the word that we should be out there saying come out of her my people we should be inviting them to an Fe Feast we should be inviting them into the Rapture you know that's what this message is it's the Rapture there ain't no other Rapture this is it there's only one place you're going to be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye and that's in this message that's in this word he says and what they will say will have already been said in the word and they're saying it now come out from among her now and be ye separated the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age now I just want to focus on this before we close he says he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of the prophet Ministry now the prophet would pick that up in questions and answers when somebody's asking them to explain the prophet's reward he says well now Jesus whosoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet receives a prophet's reward he goes on to say and if they want to know what a prophet's reward is is to be a friend to the prophet now I can't help but every time I read that I hear good evening friends and just as our Lord did in scripture he said I no longer call you servant I call you friend because the servant doesn't know what the master is doing but he Reveals His secret he reveals what he's doing to his friend oh let this mind be in you which was was also in Christ Jesus good evening friends I'm here to tell you the hour in which you are living I'm here to tell you what I'm doing I'm here to say the Lord himself has descended with a shout it is the message of the hour it is the bread of life Gathering Together the bride is to be a friend of the prophecy that's a reward he's your friend like that SHO it woman it might come in handy sometime it did for her see watch go it might come in handy sometime it did for I don't know what you have need of tonight but I want to ask are you a friend of this message come on are you a friend have you received this message in the name of the prophet in which it has come are or are you ashamed oh now here's the rub ah here's the rub it's easy to be friends with all of our Christian buddies and fellowship with them and oh Jesus saves in Jesus heals where's the reproach start talking about a prophet and put a name on it yeah because now the source is is identified and Satan hates that all hell fights against this Revelation because if somebody can come in contact with the source Hallelujah I don't know why it strikes me you know they they say uh uh G give a man a fish and and feed him for a day but teach him how to fish feed them for a lifetime look that that's that's fine you you can encourage somebody in the Lord you can you can maybe give them a quote but why don't you sit down and say I want to tell you something according to divine revelation the spirit and the bride say come I want to share with you according to Malachi 4:5 God I sent a Prophet by the name of William bradam and as the scripture says at the sounding of the seventh angel messenger when he begins to sound all the mystery of God shall be finished I not good news it's finished it's revealed the message has sounded good way to lose some friends but if you love them if you really love them H how how could you keep the greatest thing the world Christ the unveiling of God how could you not not give him the source that's right you know you know what does that a nielan spirit that wants to conquer the leoty that wants to keep it all for themselves I'll tell you what the prophet said I I'll no well what he meant I know but that was that was pre 63 see that was that was that was pre 63 but if you come over here and questions and answers and why don't you just give them the message here you know what here's here's a here's a good book why don't you there's a man here that can turn on the light why don't you go listen to this and pray God reveal himself to you give them the source let them hear my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow look you're predestin look if they're if they bride there's a special tuner in there you know they they got these you know they when you put in irrigation and things like that and electricians do the same thing but you have wires going everywhere but you can put a little honer thing on the end of that wire and that wire is going under the buildings and it's going under the parking lot and everything but then you get a little tuner and you start trying to find where that source is and some people have been walking their old lives I wonder I wonder where it is and there got to be something more than this I've gone to this church I've gone to that church and then you come around and you say they see the way they you live and everything like beep beep beep beep like God that sounds familiar maybe you share you share with them water baptism and you beep beep beep beep that sounds pretty good but why don't you just set put it in their hand beep this is what I've been looking for all my life this is my Revival I had a good time in that church I had a good time of there but when I come into the light if you walk in the light as he is in the light we shall have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Christ shall cleanse you from all your sins might as well read it while I'm holding it then if we are walking in the god-given light I love it when he does stuff like that then if we are walking in the god-given light of the hour then God takes that word that's given for the hour and vindicates it just like he did in Genesis 1:3 let there be light and light came forth his word went forth and the light followed it and cleared away the midst and the Darkness went to one corner and the light shined on the other side if you want Darkness to be chased out of your life I got the answer come let him that's a thirst come you want a prophet's reward it might come in handy sometime let the musicians come I think some people want to just go to Brams come come drink of these Waters come out from amongst from my people be what are you looking for don't look for some Revival from another a we're living in the greatest Revival this is the brid's Revival this is not an intellectual Revival you can talk me in one day and out the other I can be on the highest Mountaintop I'm in Revival I can be in the lowest lowest valy of my life and feel beat down but I got news for that devil I'm in Revival you my family might be going through a hard time I might got cancer in my body but oh devil I'm in Revival you can't take this revival from me because I am the Revival I am the message of the hour am you can no longer you can no more stop me than you can stop God because greater is he amen that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah oh praise His wonderful name that's the way God does today he sends his word for this hour and the Holy Spirit comes and makes the word live and the Darkness goes on to their Creeds and denomination but light shines because it's the word of God being Vindicated that his word is true oh hallelujah what do you have need of I want to tell you there's a fountain open in the House of David we got needs represented amongst us oh my well I tell you what this message comes in handy it did for the shemite woman God had given her something so she went back to the source if you ain't living in Victory go back to the source if you ain't living overcoming life go back to the source if you're not living in Revival go back to the source come back to the word come are you thirsty come and drink prophet of God said it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual Revival it gots to come out of the Bible word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in Acts two exactly it always has and always will because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere oh people get so confused how the prophet is trying to lead the church out of the Revival that was ushered in by the restoration of the gifts and when he stands there says look the Revival's over it's dead that won't happen no more he's not doing away with your Revival he's getting your eyes off an age Revival that's gone by look every age had a Revival every generation has a chance at the word but he's standing there telling the people stop looking for something in an age that has gone by everybody's crying fast pray fast pray for Revival and the very thing you're praying for the very thing you're looking for is right here in the building Christ is here the Mighty God unveiled before you what do you have need of this message is here there's a man here that could turn on the light the Lord himself shall descend he is here with an open book what do you have need of come to the Fountain the spirit of the Bride say come am amen you need healing there's healing here oh it takes the spirit of God play something sister it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just an intellectual Revival it got to come out of the Bible word Revival and the word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results as did in Acts two exactly it always has it always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere it takes atmosphere to do things that's the reason you men are always taught bring your children here well certainly that's right I'm glad to see my daughter Rebecca come in and sit down just a few minutes ago some of you you seen me wink at a woman it was my daughter so she come in and sat down I want her to receive the baptism of the spirit and that's why she is here in the meeting you mean we go to meetings to get the Holy Ghost did you see that what are we here for church we create an atmosphere we preach the unadulterated word it takes atmosphere to do things but the atmosphere is not your absolute the atmosphere is not your attra action it's the revealed word of the hour that we must be anchored in because our feelings and our emotions and the atmospheres will change but one thing that will never change is that thus saith the Lord hallelujah let's all [Music] stand what are you looking for maybe I can say it this what effect what result are you looking for what fruit are you looking for we must be in rapturing condition I say Lord I want to be [Music] ready Lord I believe your word you're

this old stagnated church Creeds and things we're fooling around with he wants genuine faith in his word who will believe every word of it let's go to the well and bring back a drink a refreshment a worship that's built upon not Creeds and denominations but a genuine Spirit Worship with Christ among us living his life the way he wants to Among Us that's not with Creeds and different things oh

mess it up that's why I'm living in Revival that's why I'm worshiping him with a real genuine worship and praise is because of what he's done for me and now I want to do something for him I want to minister to him with every head bowed Lord Jesus we thank you for your word we thank you for this great message the revealing of those unknown [Music] Thunders that John was forbidden to write you said seal it up and I'll reveal it in the end time when the seventh angel messenger begins to sound and it's those unknown Thunders that literally wakes this bride up and stirs her heart into a Revival for a Rapture Lord I'm so thankful it's not depending on how I feel I'm so thankful it's not depending on what I've done and how I've messed up Lord but it's depending on what you said you said you would have a bride here and here she is you said that we never did it in the first place we believe it you said we'll go in a rapture we believe it Lord oh because of what you have done Lord

didn't answer prayer Lord Faith rest in your promise you work all things out for good then we have a Divine promise that good is coming and we can rejoice in that knowing that everything is working out for good Lord while every head's bowed if there's just somebody here you realize you're not in Rapture condition and you just want to lift your hand up to God and say God I need help to get in rapturing condition God bless you hands everywhere God bless you let this be a sober moment where God can just deal with your heart and begin to go into your life and maybe you would just start an inviting them into every area of your life and start to open up your heart and say Lord you you know what I've been struggling with and I've I haven't talked to you about it in a while but I've been a little embarrassed I've been a little ashamed but I realize Lord that you're the only one that can help me Lord I can't do it on my own I want the victory Lord I feel like I go through Cycles I feel
