[3:54] Junior, if you could just come and open
[3:56] our service in
[3:57] [Music]
[4:01] prayer.
[4:06] Let's truly welcome him. This morning I
[4:09] on the way to church, Julie was running
[4:11] around picking up the house and it was
[4:13] like, you know, what are you doing? She
[4:14] said, well, someone may come over, you
[4:17] know, see the house, but we want to open
[4:18] every door, whether it's clean, whether
[4:20] it's unclean, let's just truly let the
[4:23] Lord have the preeminence. And I' I'd
[4:25] ask that, you know, if are there
[4:27] soldiers here? Are we ready to do the
[4:29] battle? Amen. And and uh join with me uh
[4:33] all your mind, all your heart, all your
[4:35] spirit. Uh bring every imagination in in
[4:38] in captive. And let's watch God move in
[4:41] a mighty way for us this morning. Let's
[4:42] go before him. Gracious heavenly father,
[4:45] we're giving this service to you this
[4:46] morning. Father, we're giving you all of
[4:48] ourselves, all of our hearts, all of our
[4:50] minds, all that we are. Father, we're
[4:52] all in, Lord. And Lord, we're asking
[4:54] that you would just come in your special
[4:56] way. Father, we have not received
[4:58] another Christ, but we've received Jesus
[5:00] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[5:02] forever. Father, we know you in your
[5:05] power, Father, but we know you in your g
[5:07] gentleness and your meekness. Lord, we
[5:10] know you're one that is nigh them who
[5:11] are of a broken heart. And Father, I
[5:13] believe there's needs that have gathered
[5:15] here this morning, Lord. And Father, we
[5:17] want to do our part, Lord, to set an
[5:19] atmosphere where Jehovah Gyra, Lord.
[5:22] Lord, the provider of all that we have
[5:23] need of could come and have your way,
[5:25] Lord. We're not too proud, Lord, to wash
[5:27] your feet with our tears. Lord, we're
[5:30] not, Lord, ones that can't cry hosana to
[5:32] your name and praise you for the things
[5:34] you've done, oh God. May you just have
[5:37] your will and way in this service, we're
[5:38] committing it to you from the front to
[5:40] the back, Lord. From the sound booth,
[5:42] Lord, every part, Lord, it's all about
[5:45] you, Father. And from the Sunday school,
[5:47] Lord, Lord, without you, we're nothing,
[5:50] Lord. and we're giving to give you the
[5:51] praise and the honor and Lord, most of
[5:53] all our hearts, Lord. We want it to be a
[5:56] heart that's acceptable before you,
[5:59] Lord. One that you can brood over,
[6:02] Father. We believe you're we're your
[6:03] anointed in this day. And we're
[6:06] Messiah, the very bride of Christ. And
[6:09] Lord, we want to carry that, Father, in
[6:11] a way that pleases you. So we commit
[6:14] this service to you asking you Lord to
[6:16] be pleased and be glorified in the
[6:18] mighty name of Jesus Christ. We pray and
[6:20] ask these things. Amen.
[6:25] Amen. We want to welcome everyone in the
[6:27] house of God. Amen. All our visitors. I
[6:29] heard we had some visitors from Denver.
[6:31] We welcome you this morning. Why don't
[6:33] you turn around and just welcome someone
[6:35] this morning and in the house of God.
[6:37] And Amen.
[6:55] And let's turn our Bibles to our psalm
[6:57] reading this morning. Psalm 148.
[7:11] And I'll start with the first, you'll
[7:13] read the second, and we'll join
[7:14] together. And the last, it says, "Praise
[7:17] ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the
[7:21] heavens. Praise him in the heights.
[7:25] Praise him.
[7:31] Praise him, son and moon. Praise him all
[7:35] ye stars of light.
[7:43] Let them praise the name of the Lord.
[7:45] For he commanded and they were created.
[7:56] Praise the Lord from the earth, ye
[7:59] dragons and all deeps.
[8:07] mountains and all hills and fruitful
[8:10] trees and all cedars,
[8:17] kings of the earth and all people,
[8:20] princes and all judges of the earth.
[8:27] Let them praise the name of the Lord.
[8:30] For his name alone is excellent and his
[8:33] glory is above the earth and the
[8:35] heavens. He also exalted the arms of his
[8:39] people. The praise of those saints, even
[8:42] the children of Israel, a people near
[8:45] unto him. Praise ye the Lord. Amen.
[8:48] There's nothing that escapes his praise.
[8:51] We have to praise him from all. Amen.
[8:53] God bless you. You may have your seats.
[8:55] Amen. Keep very flat.

[20:23] greater than them. But the reality is
[20:26] there is a fountain filled with blood.
[20:30] It don't matter what kind of sinner you
[20:31] are. If you're the worst of them all,
[20:33] that blood works.

[26:44] [Music]
[26:46] flowing

[27:10] snow. Hallelujah.
[27:13] Aren't you glad there's a fountain
[27:14] available this morning? Amen. That
[27:18] regardless of how we came in, we could
[27:20] be dipped in and be changed this
[27:22] morning. Amen. We have uh some requests
[27:25] we want to bring before the church. Um
[27:28] this is a testimony from brother John.
[27:30] He writes, "Thank you saints for your
[27:32] prayers. Um it says for my mother uh
[27:35] she's now fully recovered from
[27:37] pneumonia. Please continue to pray for
[27:39] her to regain her strength." Amen.
[27:43] Blessed be the name of the
[27:45] Lord. Amen. He's our healer. Amen.
[27:50] Brother Honor King Conqueror writes um
[27:53] is asking prayer for my daughter Naomi
[27:55] uh Chihuahua. Uh she'll be having
[27:58] surgery tomorrow morning. They said uh
[28:01] God give the doctors all that they need
[28:03] to perform the surgery. Right. We
[28:05] certainly remember her this morning and
[28:07] pray that the Lord will guide this
[28:08] surgeon's hand. Brother Tommy writes,
[28:11] "Uh, please pray for my mom. Uh, she's
[28:13] in the hospital, uh, believing, uh, for
[28:16] a good MRI report." Amen. He's the God
[28:19] that changes things. It doesn't matter
[28:22] what the circumstance is. And if he's on
[28:24] our side, we have nothing to fear. Amen.
[28:27] Brother Emanuel writes, "Please pray for
[28:28] my family members." It said, "Who are
[28:31] traveling, may God provide a traveling
[28:33] mercy." Certainly want to remember them
[28:35] this morning. Amen. If you're having it
[28:38] upon your heart this morning, amen. One
[28:41] thing I love is everything not there's
[28:43] nothing impossible in his presence. If
[28:46] we can only come believing that we are
[28:48] standing in his presence, we know that
[28:50] whatever circumstance we're going
[28:51] through, he will be able to change it
[28:53] this morning. Amen. The brothers that
[28:56] are taking the offerings. Amen. Uh
[28:58] brother Mie has a testimony. What we'll
[29:01] do is we'll have him come give his
[29:03] testimony and then pray for the request.
[29:05] Amen.
[29:14] Amen. If you could turn my mic on.
[29:17] Sister Rebecca wanted prayer for his son
[29:19] Samuel. We certainly want to remember
[29:21] him also. But I'm angry as you pray.
[29:23] Just remember Samuel. God bless you.
[29:30] God bless you. Bright.
[29:36] It's beautiful and how simple it is. You
[29:39] ask God, God does it for
[29:42] you. You come back in the church, you
[29:46] write a little note, give it to brother
[29:48] Darien, and he will make sure that
[29:50] you're here doing the testimony. How
[29:52] simple it is. Glory to God. And uh we
[29:54] love brother Darians and all the other
[29:56] brothers, right? uh who are serving as a
[29:59] deacons. Uh we love you all brothers. Uh
[30:03] we appreciate your time. You're you're
[30:04] all the love for God that you serve God
[30:08] and all of us. So God bless you all. Um
[30:12] want to share this uh testimony with
[30:15] you. Uh going under the anesthesia is
[30:19] becoming a thing for me. I go to a
[30:22] doctor. doctor have a little pain and
[30:24] doctor says um well you have to go to
[30:26] surgery you know no fun but uh if I were
[30:29] to say it would be fairly accurate uh if
[30:33] I were to recall between 10 and 15 time
[30:36] I have been gone under anesthesia so far
[30:40] but God is good you know if you if I'm
[30:43] still up there is still air in my lungs
[30:46] there's still chance for me to do it
[30:48] right glory to God so I want to tell you
[30:50] this little quick testimony What
[30:52] happened to me was I went to the doctor
[30:55] and um it was it was um abdominal pain I
[30:58] was going through and I severely doubted
[31:02] my my doctor that he says it's it's your
[31:04] kidneys. I said no it's my it's my belly
[31:07] it's my abdomen and um he says okay if
[31:10] it if it's true that's fine but what I
[31:12] want you to do is just go and have this
[31:14] test done and uh if it is your abdomen
[31:17] we will make sure we'll do that and fair
[31:19] enough. So I went to the doctor and uh
[31:22] there was a big stone that has deported
[31:24] my kidney and never reached the bladder
[31:26] and it's stuck and now what happened is
[31:29] all the back flow and it was um uh
[31:31] really um my left kidney was was getting
[31:35] swelled and it's no fun and fairly
[31:38] enough um I had to go through the
[31:41] procedure and um so many brothers so
[31:44] many sisters have prayed for me um and
[31:48] the reason I'm here it's it's Not um um
[31:51] big thing right things happens there are
[31:54] doctors um um who got uses but when we
[31:58] me and my wife we went to a doctor and
[32:00] doctor says there is uh absolutely no
[32:02] spot available for 21 to 24 days 3 to
[32:06] four weeks there was nothing available
[32:08] so what we going to do we're going to
[32:09] give you some medicine so at least we
[32:12] can dilate um
[32:14] um the the organs so at least there is a
[32:18] little space for um until we go to the
[32:21] surgery. I said, "Okay, that's fine." Um
[32:23] we were praying, me and uh Nidhi were
[32:26] praying and uh we came back and that was
[32:28] like around uh 300 p.m.
[32:32] Um doctor made the phone calls. This
[32:35] this doctor that I go to, Dr. Emanuel
[32:37] Desai, he's a very good doctor in
[32:38] Louisville. Um god-fearing doctor. I've
[32:42] never seen the doctor like that. He puts
[32:44] a Bible in his uh in his pocket and he
[32:46] preaches um um to you know like what's
[32:50] the plan if where are you going to do
[32:53] where are you going after you die you
[32:54] know we need more people like like him
[32:57] so what happens uh is me and Nidhi we
[33:00] came back home and um uh there was a
[33:06] phone call going on you know like how we
[33:08] are not to answer the phone call because
[33:10] we know it's not a legit call and it
[33:12] says state of Texas. I said okay you
[33:14] know certainly I'm not going to answer
[33:17] that. Um the doctor uh then calls um
[33:22] Nidhi and she says why Mr. Singh is not
[33:24] answering call and says Nidi come to me
[33:26] why you're not answering I says okay uh
[33:29] who is that that's your doctor I said
[33:31] okay
[33:32] u u Mr. Mr. saying um uh we told you
[33:37] that there is nothing available but
[33:39] someone has just uh cancelled the
[33:41] appointment can you come first thing in
[33:43] the morning we have availability for you
[33:45] I was like my goodness now tell me if
[33:47] it's not God 21 days or 24 days and less
[33:53] than 24 hours um the procedure was done
[33:57] and uh um the same time uh it was like
[34:01] around 6 or 7 Um next day I was at home,
[34:06] procedure was done and uh we were
[34:09] thanking God um for his his faithfulness
[34:16] and I texted brothers and uh brothers
[34:20] uplifted me for and wishes me for the
[34:22] speedy recovery. So so this is uh this
[34:25] is my sweet testimony. Um and and I I do
[34:29] not know if you know this about me. I
[34:31] love testimonies. It encourages me. It
[34:34] encourages so many of you. Just have a
[34:36] quick uh verse that I would like to read
[34:38] is uh Luke chapter um 11 and it's uh
[34:44] verse 9. And it says, I say unto you,
[34:47] ask and it shall be given to you. Seek
[34:49] and uh ye shall find. Knock and it shall
[34:52] be open unto you. The key is staying
[34:55] persistent. Um do not give up. God is a

[56:30] children.
[56:33] [Music]
[56:36] that you would look kindly on us,
[56:39] Father, and forgive us for our many
[56:42] shortcomings. Father, may we leave here
[56:45] to this morning more dedicated and with
[56:49] a greater realization of the hour that
[56:52] we're in, we ask you to bless us this
[56:55] morning. In your precious and holy name
[56:58] we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You may
[57:02] be seated for a moment this morning.
[57:12] Uh we uh we want to just make a little
[57:16] announcement. Uh
[57:18] uh April 11th is our
[57:23] uh young couples uh dinner. So, if
[57:28] you're a married couple and one of you
[57:31] is 39 and under,
[57:35] uh, you can go. Okay? Or if you're
[57:40] engaged to be
[57:42] married, you can go. So, brothers, if
[57:46] you want to go to the dinner, you know,
[57:49] pop the question, right? Uh but anyway,
[57:53] so uh we're certainly looking forward to
[57:57] uh uh that uh coming up. And then April
[58:01] 13th is our pavilion dedication. So
[58:05] we'll have service in the morning.
[58:07] Afterwards, we'll cook hot dogs and
[58:10] hamburgers and put out sides and we'll
[58:14] have a lunch out there. And then after
[58:17] lunch, we'll come in here and have a
[58:19] singing. So, we're certainly looking
[58:22] forward to that. Uh, you know,
[58:26] uh, reverence is a is a quality that God
[58:33] appreciates. And, you know, when you
[58:35] reverence something, then you give it
[58:37] your full attention and you give it um,
[58:41] everything you have and you put
[58:43] something into it. And uh you know when
[58:46] you sing, if you just put a little
[58:48] something into it, if you uh worship,
[58:51] you just put something into it, reach
[58:53] down and grab something that's deep on
[58:55] the inside and resurrect it in you. And
[58:59] it begins to create an atmosphere and
[59:02] and then the Lord can come in, move in
[59:05] that atmosphere and and and that's
[59:08] important to me. But this morning we
[59:11] have
[59:12] uh brother Bill Ivy's going to minister
[59:16] for us. And Bill Ivy's a longtime friend
[59:20] of mine.
[59:22] And you know there's certain
[59:25] uh characteristics and certain images
[59:29] you have in your mind. And many times
[59:32] when I think about brother Bill, I think
[59:35] about the story that the prophet of God
[59:38] told about the great general who wanted
[59:41] a soldier to ride in his his chariot
[59:45] with him. And uh I believe it was
[59:49] Napoleon. And so as he rode down, he
[59:53] wanted to pick someone to ride with him.
[59:55] and he found a
[59:57] soldier and somebody that's been had a
[1:00:01] few battle scars on him and knew what it
[1:00:04] was like to fight the fight of faith and
[1:00:07] to go through adversity and knew the
[1:00:10] hand of God not only in good times but
[1:00:14] in hard times. And I always have this
[1:00:17] little vision of brother Bill with his
[1:00:22] gun over his shoulder and a big bayonet
[1:00:24] up and his backpack and it dressed in
[1:00:27] that French uniform, you know, walking
[1:00:30] down the road, you know, just a seasoned
[1:00:33] soldier and and you know, that's the
[1:00:37] kind of people I appreciate.
[1:00:39] You know, I don't like fair weather
[1:00:41] Christians.
[1:00:43] I like I like those that have are tough.
[1:00:46] And I've watched Bill's life for many
[1:00:49] years from a far off. And I can tell you
[1:00:52] one thing I always learned about Brother
[1:00:54] Bill. He'll put a s smile on
[1:00:57] discouragement. He'll put a smile on
[1:01:00] disappointment. He'll put a smile on
[1:01:03] trials. And by being around him, you
[1:01:07] might not know that on the inside the
[1:01:10] world's raging.
[1:01:12] But that's just the kind of the nature
[1:01:15] that he's had. And and part
[1:01:19] of him ministering this morning is not
[1:01:22] only the words of life that he knows,
[1:01:26] but the nature in which he brings them.
[1:01:31] And I just think it's so important that
[1:01:34] we're so aware of our nature and and the
[1:01:39] atmosphere that we create and the love
[1:01:42] that we have. So I believe you you'll
[1:01:45] enjoy Brother Bill this morning. And uh
[1:01:50] I I I won't tell you all the things that
[1:01:55] I could say about him, but there's one
[1:01:57] thing I can say. He's real.
[1:02:00] And that's, you know, he's not here to
[1:02:05] impress, he's here to minister. And and
[1:02:07] I I love that realness about him this
[1:02:10] morning. So, uh, I appreciate what God's
[1:02:15] done for him and and what he's done for
[1:02:18] me over the years. He's been a friend
[1:02:20] and he's been true to this word. And so,
[1:02:23] I want you to know you're blessed this
[1:02:25] morning to have Brother Bill here. I
[1:02:27] don't know what he's going to preach or
[1:02:30] how long he's going to preach. It don't
[1:02:31] matter to me. I just believe that you'll
[1:02:33] be blessed. So, I'd like to stand this
[1:02:36] morning and maybe Brother Billy can help
[1:02:39] me. And
[1:02:42] uh there's a I remember when I first
[1:02:46] heard this song, Sister Julia sung it.
[1:02:49] There is a
[1:02:50] blood.
[1:02:52] And and that's what we're built on this
[1:02:55] morning.
[1:02:58] Each one of us are here this morning
[1:03:00] because somebody loved us enough. Yes.
[1:03:04] To look on all our
[1:03:06] evil and everything that we had done and
[1:03:11] cover it. Yes. With a blood,
[1:03:15] not hold one thing against
[1:03:17] us. No revenge,
[1:03:22] just purchased.
[1:03:25] So may your heart go up and make contact
[1:03:27] with his spirit this morning. Would you
[1:03:30] invite his Holy Spirit to come around
[1:03:32] you this morning and let the spirit of
[1:03:35] God start to move? Let him start to
[1:03:39] anoint you and anoint the speaker that
[1:03:42] we could become one this morning,
[1:03:45] Father, that they may be one as we are
[1:03:48] one. The prophet of God said that prayer
[1:03:51] has to be answered. That's right.
[1:03:54] So, we're here this morning to worship.
[1:03:57] Would you worship with them as we
[1:03:59] prepare to have our brother
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:03] come? Here is the
[1:04:07] one thous.

[1:07:36] seated for just a moment as I just try
[1:07:40] to get to to know you. I'm looking
[1:07:44] around to try to see somebody I know
[1:07:47] David.
[1:07:49] Let me see who else do I know. Uh well,
[1:07:52] there's my wife over there. I know her,
[1:07:56] Sister
[1:07:57] Lesie. Anyway, I guess it's been a long
[1:08:00] time since I've been here.
[1:08:03] things
[1:08:04] change um over the years, but um you
[1:08:09] know, there's one thing that I know is a
[1:08:10] constant and never changes, and that's
[1:08:12] the Lord Jesus.
[1:08:15] If he's in your heart, in your life, and
[1:08:17] I know you, you know, somehow we were
[1:08:20] together way back there before we even
[1:08:22] knew anything about it.
[1:08:25] I probably won't get to meet every one
[1:08:28] of you, but um over
[1:08:31] there over there we'll have an
[1:08:33] opportunity to get together with whoever
[1:08:36] we want to ever how long it we want to
[1:08:39] spend with one another. There won't be
[1:08:41] no boundaries to that. So, we're all
[1:08:44] aiming for a great time. Uh then u
[1:08:50] appreciate those things brother David
[1:08:52] said. I we've all through been through
[1:08:55] battles through the years, but that's
[1:08:56] part of what being a Christian is all
[1:08:58] about. And it's wonderful to have good
[1:09:00] friends that you can go through things
[1:09:02] together with. Brother David has
[1:09:03] certainly been a a great friend of ours.
[1:09:07] He's preached for us many times. People
[1:09:09] in our church, they all wanted to tell
[1:09:11] you hello and your wife, Sister Lesie.
[1:09:14] And so we appreciate very much uh being
[1:09:18] here. I look around and am I in Togo or
[1:09:24] Benin or
[1:09:26] um Ghana? I I you know I've been able to
[1:09:30] go into West Africa quite a bit and I
[1:09:34] had have some wonderful wonderful
[1:09:36] friends, precious friends. I've
[1:09:40] um and but as I got older it's got more
[1:09:43] difficult for me to go. I went one time
[1:09:46] uh this past year uh just for a weekend
[1:09:50] in in Benin and uh I don't know if I get
[1:09:53] to go back again but uh we started
[1:09:56] having a missionary conference or our
[1:09:58] annual meeting every May. Some of you
[1:10:01] have been there, I think. And brother
[1:10:03] David has preached that for us. And it's
[1:10:06] the Memorial Weekend in May, the last
[1:10:08] weekend or the weekend of the 23rd, I
[1:10:11] think. And we translate the services
[1:10:13] into French while they're being
[1:10:14] preached. And we uh uh there there are
[1:10:17] brothers that come over from West Africa
[1:10:20] and generally are with us. And so I just
[1:10:22] wanted to make you uh welcome to come
[1:10:25] and be a part of that if you don't have
[1:10:28] any other anything else to do. But if we
[1:10:31] could stand
[1:10:32] together bringing greetings of course
[1:10:35] from our church in Gibson
[1:10:37] uh or Campbell,
[1:10:39] Missouri. Uh could you turn in your
[1:10:42] Bibles to First John the 1 chapter and
[1:10:45] the fifth verse? I hope everybody can
[1:10:46] hear me clearly. My voice is not as loud
[1:10:48] as it used to be. I don't preach as fast
[1:10:52] or as loud as I did at one time. As you
[1:10:55] get older, those things kind of
[1:10:56] dissipate. I don't have to prove
[1:10:58] anything anymore. And I just preach the
[1:11:01] word.
[1:11:02] [Music]
[1:11:04] It was um Martin Luther, he said, you
[1:11:08] know, all I did was just go out there
[1:11:11] and nail something on the church door,
[1:11:14] write things about the word, preach
[1:11:15] about the word, then I'd go home and
[1:11:17] rest and enjoy myself with my friends.
[1:11:20] He said the word done the rest of it.
[1:11:22] And I believe the word will still do the
[1:11:24] rest of it if we let the word do that.
[1:11:26] First John the 1 chapter and the fifth
[1:11:29] verse.
[1:11:31] This then is the message which we have
[1:11:34] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:11:37] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:11:41] at all. I'm going to draw my text from
[1:11:43] that scripture, but I want to read on
[1:11:44] down to the seventh verse. If we say
[1:11:47] that we have fellowship with him and
[1:11:49] walk in darkness, we lie and do not the
[1:11:52] truth. But if we walk in the light as he
[1:11:55] is in the
[1:11:56] light, we have fellowship one with
[1:11:59] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:12:02] his son cleanses us from all sins. I
[1:12:07] want to title my sermon this morning
[1:12:11] simply is a question. What is the
[1:12:15] message? Now that may seem very simple
[1:12:18] and very
[1:12:19] basic, but I think it's something that
[1:12:21] needs to be preached about.
[1:12:23] Could we bow our heads together?
[1:12:26] Heavenly Father, thank you for the
[1:12:27] privilege that I have to be able to
[1:12:29] stand in behind the sacred desk. I just
[1:12:33] pray that the things that'll be said
[1:12:34] will be completely in continuity with
[1:12:38] the pastor here and with the ministers
[1:12:41] that uh labor here behind this place.
[1:12:45] bless your people. Open their hearts to
[1:12:46] receive the word. And we thank you for
[1:12:49] each one of them in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:12:51] Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:12:55] seated. As preachers, sometimes we think
[1:12:59] that everybody hears what we have to say
[1:13:02] and but everybody does not. It doesn't
[1:13:05] matter how many people are in a
[1:13:06] congregation.
[1:13:08] as a rule, even if it was Brother
[1:13:10] Brandham himself standing behind the
[1:13:12] pull pit, there would be just a few that
[1:13:15] would grasp what was really being said.
[1:13:17] It's just that way. That's not to put
[1:13:19] down on anybody or anything. And we like
[1:13:23] to think though everybody will leave
[1:13:24] here and they'll say, "Oh, that was a a
[1:13:26] great sermon and and they remember
[1:13:29] everything you said." But it doesn't
[1:13:30] work that way at all.
[1:13:33] Um, and I I found through the years that
[1:13:38] when a person says they heard a good
[1:13:40] sermon, maybe it was just a a very
[1:13:44] little part of that sermon, maybe a
[1:13:46] sentence or something that that spoke
[1:13:49] specifically to them and their heart and
[1:13:52] their need, and they left with that with
[1:13:55] that. And uh so I pray that uh today and
[1:13:58] this morning that I can say something
[1:14:00] that will mean something to someone.
[1:14:03] Okay, we're as Gentiles
[1:14:06] um God deals with us as
[1:14:10] individuals. Let's face it, there's
[1:14:12] always a mixed multitude and a church is
[1:14:15] not going in the rapture. No church is
[1:14:18] going I like to thank everybody in my
[1:14:21] church is but it's individuals okay that
[1:14:24] God will uh that will take place that's
[1:14:28] the day that we're living in and we want
[1:14:30] to be ready for that so I want to talk
[1:14:32] to you this morning uh about that
[1:14:36] subject of what is the message in the
[1:14:38] text that I read to you we see John the
[1:14:42] great uh elderly John he he makes
[1:14:47] mention of that very thing. He said,
[1:14:49] "This then is the
[1:14:51] message which we talking about himself
[1:14:55] and those that were with him had heard
[1:14:58] of him heard of Christ." They heard
[1:15:00] Christ himself speak of what the message
[1:15:04] was. And John goes on to say, "I declare
[1:15:08] unto you what the message what the
[1:15:10] message is." And then he says what it
[1:15:14] is. uh not to get ahead of myself or to
[1:15:17] end my sermon before I ever get started,
[1:15:19] but he he said the message was that God
[1:15:23] is
[1:15:26] light. And uh and because he's light,
[1:15:31] then by that we can have fellowship with
[1:15:34] him. And not just with him, but with one
[1:15:37] another because his blood cleanses us
[1:15:40] from all sins.
[1:15:43] Now what is the
[1:15:46] message? Whatever it
[1:15:48] is, it has never changed
[1:15:54] because Hebrews 13 and8 is Jesus Christ
[1:15:57] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:15:58] And every one of us
[1:16:01] uh realize that that is the really the
[1:16:03] theme of what we believe that there is a
[1:16:06] constant that remains the same and we
[1:16:09] believe that that the message is such it
[1:16:12] never changes but now there is something
[1:16:14] that does
[1:16:15] change and I want you to hear me out and
[1:16:18] don't draw a conclusion uh just
[1:16:21] immediately uh we change
[1:16:26] all of us as preachers just change. I
[1:16:29] change. We change. And but we have to
[1:16:32] change in the right way.
[1:16:35] Change is going to come. If you didn't
[1:16:36] change, then you would be have a mental
[1:16:39] condition perhaps that would keep you
[1:16:41] from being able to change. You'd remain
[1:16:43] a child or something all your life. So
[1:16:45] we do change. We the the the message
[1:16:47] hasn't changed, but we change by growing
[1:16:50] in knowledge of
[1:16:52] God, which again is Hebrews 13:8. And
[1:16:56] so, especially in the day that we live
[1:16:58] in, because we're living in a different
[1:17:00] time. We're not even living in the day
[1:17:04] in which the Apostle Paul and the early
[1:17:06] church was they there was yet 2,000
[1:17:10] years of church ages to come. And many
[1:17:13] of them were not even aware of that.
[1:17:15] They looked for the coming of the Lord
[1:17:17] then. Paul looked for the coming of the
[1:17:19] Lord then. And yet there was many years
[1:17:23] to come because we you had to come on
[1:17:26] the scene to be a part of your message.
[1:17:30] And certainly we want to go back and
[1:17:32] understand and believe what Paul
[1:17:34] preached because that's what we're
[1:17:36] resting our faith and our hope in. But
[1:17:38] we change by growing in knowledge.
[1:17:43] uh because in today is different than
[1:17:47] yesterday in that or or any previous
[1:17:50] church age as we've been taught because
[1:17:55] this is the harvest time. Now I where we
[1:17:59] live our church is in the middle of a
[1:18:01] cotton field. Sometimes it's a
[1:18:03] watermelon patch, sometimes it's corn.
[1:18:05] Whatever the farmers plan at that time,
[1:18:08] it's farming country where we live and
[1:18:11] uh so we understand it very very
[1:18:13] clearly. When harvest time comes, we
[1:18:16] know we know what it's all about. It's
[1:18:19] seed time. The seed that was planted in
[1:18:22] the ground is done come to maturity
[1:18:24] again, come to life again. the same seed
[1:18:27] has come up by that seed dying and then
[1:18:30] and much more has been produced and has
[1:18:34] come. So, harvest time we're that that's
[1:18:36] where we're at. That wasn't in Paul's
[1:18:38] day, but that's our day,
[1:18:40] you see. So, that that's where a change
[1:18:43] took place. We could say we could call
[1:18:45] this a rapture time,
[1:18:49] couldn't we? Now they look for the
[1:18:51] coming of the Lord all the way back to
[1:18:53] Paul. But this is the rapture time.
[1:18:57] Amen. Uh and uh our our prophet coined
[1:19:02] this phrase about the time that we're
[1:19:05] living in that I don't think could have
[1:19:07] been used in any brother Jerome. God
[1:19:10] bless you.
[1:19:12] I I saw that smile and that's how I
[1:19:15] recognize you. So, um, but anyway, uh,
[1:19:18] he coined the phrase the bride
[1:19:21] age and I I know that you've been well
[1:19:24] trained and so I don't want to get into
[1:19:26] that, but we understand that there's
[1:19:28] only seven ages of the church. There's
[1:19:31] not eight and and and a bride age was a
[1:19:34] phrase that he coined to uh help us to
[1:19:38] understand that at the end of the
[1:19:40] leodysian church age we are still in
[1:19:42] Leodysa by the way that final age until
[1:19:45] we leave here and but there is an age of
[1:19:48] the bride or a time in which uh Luke 17
[1:19:52] and30 has been fulfilled the revealing
[1:19:55] of the son of man you see not just the
[1:19:58] son of god through the church ages above
[1:20:00] us but the son of man. And what is the
[1:20:03] son of man? It is the word. Not just the
[1:20:06] word itself. Okay. Yeah. The word. Yeah.
[1:20:09] It's absolutely the word. But it's the
[1:20:11] word living among us in human flesh.
[1:20:16] Praise the Lord. And so that's what we
[1:20:18] have seen that that that little space of
[1:20:20] time before we leave here. And so uh we
[1:20:24] we can say that.
[1:20:27] Now what is the message? And I'm going
[1:20:30] to repeat myself as we as I go through
[1:20:32] these this thing to the this morning on
[1:20:36] that just to remind you where I'm
[1:20:40] going. What is the message?
[1:20:44] Not you, you know, to not believe the
[1:20:47] message. And today we're living in a in
[1:20:49] a time I'll just be just as frank as I
[1:20:53] can be. And and y'all aren't children.
[1:20:56] You know what's going on in the world
[1:20:57] today, especially with social media and
[1:21:01] there there are people that uh have
[1:21:05] stood in a pull pit just like this and
[1:21:08] could preach could outreach all every
[1:21:10] preacher in here probably and yet today
[1:21:13] they say they do not believe the message
[1:21:17] after preaching it um after being a part
[1:21:21] of it. And so we all know that we all
[1:21:24] understand that that there are people
[1:21:27] that and there are more to come that do
[1:21:30] not believe the message anymore. They
[1:21:33] say whatever the message is, whatever
[1:21:35] they perceive the message to
[1:21:39] be, they say they don't believe
[1:21:42] it. To not believe the message then
[1:21:45] would be to not believe the Bible.
[1:21:49] And I'm trying to go somewhere. Okay.
[1:21:52] It
[1:21:56] it's like this. Let let me just explain
[1:21:58] it in this way. When Martin Luther stood
[1:22:02] before the diet and they were bringing
[1:22:04] charges against him for heresy because
[1:22:08] of the things that he wrote and he
[1:22:10] taught and he preached and they wouldn't
[1:22:12] did not want to give him an opportunity
[1:22:14] to defend himself. They wanted him to
[1:22:16] recant for his writings. And they had
[1:22:19] him laying out there and uh he said,
[1:22:23] "How can I?"
[1:22:25] He said, "To recant of my writings would
[1:22:28] be to recant of the Bible because much
[1:22:30] of it is scripture." Amen. Amen. He said
[1:22:34] to recant of my writings would be to
[1:22:36] recant of even teachings of the Roman
[1:22:39] Catholic Church that is in there and of
[1:22:43] some of the great men that have pinned
[1:22:45] certain things is all in there would be
[1:22:47] to recant of all of those things. That's
[1:22:51] right. And so to disallow the message
[1:22:55] then would be the same. Huh? Whatever
[1:22:58] the message is, okay, would be to
[1:23:01] disallow scripture
[1:23:07] because in every tape you listen to,
[1:23:10] every book you read,
[1:23:12] what do you find?
[1:23:15] Scripture. Amen. But not only that, you
[1:23:18] see,
[1:23:20] uh to to to say you do not believe the
[1:23:25] message would be to say you do not even
[1:23:27] believe in men that God used to bring a
[1:23:31] furtherance of truth of which many
[1:23:35] denominations over the years have have
[1:23:38] built upon yet they stopped building but
[1:23:41] they built upon truth. So to say that I
[1:23:45] do not believe the message, whatever I
[1:23:47] would perceive the message would be
[1:23:50] would be to say that I do not believe in
[1:23:55] the restoration of the gifts that took
[1:23:57] place in the Pentecostal
[1:23:59] age would be to say that I do not
[1:24:03] believe in
[1:24:06] sanctification that came to the church
[1:24:10] um through
[1:24:11] Wesley. would be to say that I do not
[1:24:16] uh believe in justification that Luther
[1:24:18] preached. You understand? Would be to to
[1:24:21] to disallow all of those things. Why?
[1:24:25] Because our messenger said that the
[1:24:28] seventh
[1:24:29] [Music]
[1:24:30] angel would come and would not have a
[1:24:34] mystery of his own,
[1:24:37] but he would go back and take the loose
[1:24:39] ends that Pentecost had, that Wesley
[1:24:43] had, that Luther had, the great men of
[1:24:46] days gone by, and he'd put it together.
[1:24:50] So to say you don't believe whatever a
[1:24:52] person would perceive would be to say
[1:24:55] eventually
[1:24:57] they'd have to throw this book away
[1:24:59] completely and not believe. You
[1:25:01] understand?
[1:25:08] So there's been a Luther, there's been
[1:25:10] men like Calvin that God used to further
[1:25:14] certain thoughts of scripture. Wesley
[1:25:17] with
[1:25:19] sanctification,
[1:25:20] Spurgeon,
[1:25:22] he great preacher that brother Brandon
[1:25:24] called a
[1:25:25] reformer. And so we know God used men
[1:25:29] throughout the ages to bring the word
[1:25:31] out, but God had a prophet in the end to
[1:25:33] put it all together.
[1:25:34] Now I want to emphasize something.
[1:25:38] about our
[1:25:41] day. Jesus
[1:25:44] Christ alone,
[1:25:48] Jesus Christ has alone
[1:25:52] declared in our day, the fullness of the
[1:25:56] truth,
[1:26:00] but not to everyone. I mean it's there
[1:26:02] for everyone but it's for those that
[1:26:05] will believe on him believe on that and
[1:26:09] then that can receive it because not
[1:26:12] everybody can receive the fullness of
[1:26:15] the truth.
[1:26:16] It's um like brother Brennham
[1:26:22] said, somebody asked him the question on
[1:26:24] question and answers. Will a person be
[1:26:27] in the rapture that don't hear you
[1:26:30] preach it or or the way you preach
[1:26:32] it? And his answer was
[1:26:36] this. He said, "Well, yes, they don't
[1:26:38] have to hear me preach it. You go back
[1:26:40] and question and answers and read it.
[1:26:43] But if they believe the fullness of the
[1:26:47] word, they'll be there. They'll be a
[1:26:49] part of the bride. Okay? So, there's the
[1:26:52] key, the fullness of the word. But it
[1:26:54] all ties together anyway.
[1:26:58] We know that. But now, where did the
[1:27:00] fullness of the word come from? Come
[1:27:03] from Christ.
[1:27:05] And um it was Christ. It was the lamb
[1:27:09] that took the book, right?
[1:27:12] and opened the book, wasn't it?
[1:27:15] And declared it to one that was in a
[1:27:17] position to receive it that could give
[1:27:19] it out to us.
[1:27:23] Now, that's important. Now, John in my
[1:27:28] text, he speaks
[1:27:31] um he speaks here
[1:27:34] uh as light being the message. We know a
[1:27:38] little bit about light. We our our
[1:27:40] prophet dealt with that the uh pillar of
[1:27:44] fire. He explained how God began to
[1:27:47] manifest himself in a light and John in
[1:27:50] in St. John in the beginning was the
[1:27:53] word and the word was with God and the
[1:27:56] word was God and he went on to describe
[1:27:58] him as being light.
[1:28:02] So
[1:28:03] um so here John in my text he he says
[1:28:08] that the message this then is the
[1:28:12] message and he begins to describe it as
[1:28:15] light because God
[1:28:17] is is light. That's exactly what he is.
[1:28:23] And so when light comes there's a
[1:28:26] furtherance of light. There's always
[1:28:28] been a furtherance of light. We see it
[1:28:30] in the church ages that brother Brandham
[1:28:32] drew out and light comes to us. I might
[1:28:36] might say it like this. Light does
[1:28:39] something that nothing else can do. I
[1:28:42] remember reading about Ruth Graham,
[1:28:45] Billy Graham's wife, and a television
[1:28:50] station had called and was coming out
[1:28:52] there to interview Billy Graham in her
[1:28:55] home in the home there. And so she went
[1:28:58] to work cleaning the house, dusting and
[1:29:00] and did everything she could to get the
[1:29:03] house just
[1:29:05] spotless. And uh then the television
[1:29:07] cameras came in and they put up these
[1:29:09] huge lights and they turned them on. And
[1:29:12] to her surprise, all she could see is
[1:29:15] dust. No matter how hard you clean, when
[1:29:18] the light shines on you, it'll show that
[1:29:20] if there's anything that's wrong. Amen.
[1:29:24] So the message is light. Yes, sir.
[1:29:28] Because God is light. Amen.
[1:29:32] And so if he's light, now this is what
[1:29:35] John said in my text. Then in him is no
[1:29:39] darkness at all. If we can find where he
[1:29:42] is and what he is, what the message is
[1:29:44] that we there there won't be no
[1:29:46] darkness. I I grew up in Pentecost and
[1:29:49] I'm not ashamed of that. It was a good
[1:29:50] shock, you see. But when light came
[1:29:56] It wasn't enough for me to come out of
[1:29:58] the Pentecostal systems. It had to come
[1:30:01] out of me cuz I saw how filthy I was
[1:30:06] and and I never had a desire to go back
[1:30:08] to that. Okay? Don't fool me with that.
[1:30:15] Okay? So if if God is light in him is no
[1:30:19] darkness, no darkness at all.
[1:30:23] This is
[1:30:25] strong. There's not even one
[1:30:28] speck of darkness. I'm getting to what
[1:30:31] the message is. Oh,
[1:30:33] church. Not one speck of
[1:30:38] darkness. And so I if there's no
[1:30:42] darkness, then there is no ignorance.
[1:30:45] There is no error. There is no
[1:30:47] untruthfulness. There is no sin. There's
[1:30:50] no death. Amen. Yes. This is what John
[1:30:54] heard from Jesus Christ himself.
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:58] I think we still hear from Jesus Christ,
[1:31:00] don't we?
[1:31:03] So John heard this from Christ, his
[1:31:06] whole manifestation in the flesh as the
[1:31:10] brightness and in the text as the
[1:31:12] brightness of the father's glory.
[1:31:16] Christ
[1:31:17] himself was was the embodiment of the
[1:31:24] message
[1:31:26] representing fully in all his sayings,
[1:31:29] doings,
[1:31:31] sufferings
[1:31:32] him who is like brother Jerome. Huh?
[1:31:37] See, in other words, his whole his whole
[1:31:44] manifestation was the embodiment of the
[1:31:47] message. What I'm
[1:31:48] meaning was the
[1:31:51] whole in him was the
[1:31:54] whole of the message.
[1:32:00] Now in Jesus Christ, if we were alive
[1:32:04] back then, we can read it in the
[1:32:07] Bible. There were great
[1:32:10] signs, healings,
[1:32:13] miracles that were manifested
[1:32:16] in Jesus Christ's ministry upon the
[1:32:19] earth and were a wonderful
[1:32:23] vindication that he had come from God.
[1:32:28] That wasn't the message.
[1:32:32] You know that, huh?
[1:32:37] It wasn't the message.
[1:32:42] They were to attract the attention of
[1:32:44] the people.
[1:32:47] The discernment, the supernatural
[1:32:49] discernment
[1:32:51] that that knew the very hearts of the
[1:32:54] people. And of course, we have that
[1:32:56] today.
[1:32:57] Amen. Right now, while I stand here,
[1:33:00] because it's still here in this form,
[1:33:03] see, the word of God is sharp and
[1:33:06] powerful and quicker and a discerner of
[1:33:08] the thought and the intent of the heart.
[1:33:09] That's why I can say something. Maybe
[1:33:11] it's just a sentence, a paragraph or
[1:33:14] something. And you hold on to that and
[1:33:16] the rest of the message that I preach,
[1:33:18] you don't hear. But that speaks to you
[1:33:20] why it discerned. That's right. It read
[1:33:23] your mail.
[1:33:25] It knew what you were doing last night
[1:33:27] in the dark when nobody was watching.
[1:33:33] So the supernatural discernment that
[1:33:36] knew the hearts that those things were
[1:33:38] great great things. Uh John St. In John
[1:33:44] 4:29, the woman at the
[1:33:46] well when he uh looked upon her and told
[1:33:51] her her sin, told her her life, told her
[1:33:55] things that maybe nobody knew but her.
[1:33:59] And she knew enough about God, even in
[1:34:03] her condition, to recognize that this
[1:34:05] had to be the Messiah that could know
[1:34:07] this. Only the word can know that. Only
[1:34:10] the message can know that.
[1:34:12] The message knows you.
[1:34:17] And so what did she do? She see it
[1:34:20] changed her.
[1:34:23] What he saw her as now she was not.
[1:34:27] The message will change you. Not just
[1:34:30] here. Huh? That happens to too many
[1:34:33] people. But it changed her hair till she
[1:34:35] could go back to those that she had been
[1:34:37] with and say, "Come see a man." Which
[1:34:40] told me all things that I ever did is
[1:34:42] not this, the Christ, the Messiah. It
[1:34:45] identified See, it identified something.
[1:34:48] Now, that wasn't the message, but I it
[1:34:50] identified what the message
[1:34:53] was. We see in John St. John 1
[1:34:56] and48 Nathaniel a very spiritual man
[1:35:00] godly man
[1:35:02] uh comes to Jesus after Philillip goes
[1:35:04] and tells him we found the Messiah and
[1:35:06] so forth and he was skeptical of that
[1:35:09] and Nathaniel saith unto him to the Lord
[1:35:13] when Jesus seen him walking up and said
[1:35:15] behold an Israelite in whom is no guile
[1:35:18] as if Jesus knew who he was and he did
[1:35:22] the message knows who you are or you
[1:35:24] wouldn't be here this morning.
[1:35:28] And so Nathaniel said unto him, "Whence
[1:35:31] knowest thou me?" Jesus answered and
[1:35:34] said unto him, Oh, I love this because
[1:35:36] it speaks to me. He knew me when I was
[1:35:39] under the fig
[1:35:41] tree. Before that Philip called thee,
[1:35:44] when thou was under the fig tree, I saw
[1:35:47] thee. Nathaniel took it. It took all the
[1:35:52] wind out of his sail.
[1:35:54] Nathaniel answered and saith unto him,
[1:35:57] "Rabbi, thou art the son of God,
[1:36:01] thou art the king of Israel." And if I
[1:36:05] could add something to that, not to add
[1:36:07] to the word, okay, but thou art the
[1:36:10] message that I've looked for.
[1:36:13] Amen.
[1:36:15] But now, as I said, these great
[1:36:18] supernatural acts of discernment, of
[1:36:21] healings, raising the
[1:36:23] dead, I mean, it it drew the
[1:36:26] crowds and the people loved it and they
[1:36:29] wanted to make him king and and
[1:36:31] everything,
[1:36:33] but they walked away
[1:36:36] eventually because that wasn't the
[1:36:40] message. This has been repeated in our
[1:36:43] day according to Bible
[1:36:46] prophecy in this end time, this rapture
[1:36:50] time. And so the same is true. There are
[1:36:54] many that have seen the
[1:36:58] supernatural
[1:37:00] healings, great
[1:37:02] things. They they saw the supernatural.
[1:37:07] But I will say
[1:37:08] this as an old
[1:37:13] man that failed to see the
[1:37:16] message and many want to go back to
[1:37:18] that. Don't take me back to where I was.
[1:37:25] You said, "Well, we don't believe in
[1:37:26] that no more." We're not Church of
[1:37:28] Christ denomination. Yes, sir. But we
[1:37:30] also also believe in something greater
[1:37:34] that's
[1:37:34] supernatural.
[1:37:36] It's the birth of something that was
[1:37:38] supernatural.
[1:37:42] So many saw the supernatural but failed
[1:37:44] to see what they didn't understand what
[1:37:47] the message was. That's why they failed
[1:37:49] to see it. That's why today they failed
[1:37:50] to see it and want to go back to another
[1:37:53] age.
[1:37:56] Don't take me back to another age. Amen.
[1:38:00] This is the last stage and in this age
[1:38:03] is everything that them other ages was.
[1:38:10] I go
[1:38:11] back to something
[1:38:15] less. I've been there. Okay. I don't
[1:38:17] want to go back to where I've been.
[1:38:20] But I want to go back to where I've been
[1:38:21] up there. Amen.
[1:38:24] There's something calling me back.
[1:38:25] There's something calling me up. Not
[1:38:28] back there. Up there. Amen. Where I come
[1:38:31] from.
[1:38:35] It's the message.
[1:38:41] So, we've seen these things repeated
[1:38:43] just as they were when Jesus's ministry.
[1:38:45] They saw the the supernatural but failed
[1:38:48] to see the message.
[1:38:50] It it showed us
[1:38:53] the message. What whatever the message
[1:38:55] is. Okay.
[1:38:58] these s the great signs and wonders, the
[1:39:02] discernment that that was so accurate,
[1:39:05] minute details. I listened to a tape
[1:39:08] here a while one person there was about
[1:39:11] 10 different things brother Brandon
[1:39:13] would say about that one person little
[1:39:14] things that so
[1:39:20] perfect. What what was that for? Okay.
[1:39:23] And you know, and I'm not feel like I
[1:39:26] I'm preaching to the choir. You know,
[1:39:27] you know these things, but it showed us
[1:39:29] the the Messiah. Now, we know Brother
[1:39:32] Brandon wasn't the Messiah, but it was
[1:39:34] the revealing of that. It showed us the
[1:39:37] Messiah was here again, manifesting
[1:39:40] himself by light, the word light that'll
[1:39:44] show every speck of dust.
[1:39:49] He knows it when light comes. Amen. The
[1:39:54] fullness of that light has come. Who can
[1:39:56] hide from it? You can't hide from it.
[1:40:00] Sometimes people come to a church where
[1:40:02] there's a lot of people and they think
[1:40:03] they can hide from the light and still
[1:40:05] be a part of the message. You can't hide
[1:40:07] from it.
[1:40:15] Just bear with
[1:40:16] me, brother Jo. I've had to slow down a
[1:40:19] little bit.
[1:40:21] Maybe it's
[1:40:27] better. I think you can preach so fast
[1:40:29] and so hard that nobody knows what
[1:40:31] you're saying, but they're on their feet
[1:40:32] saying amen like they know.
[1:40:42] Time to sit down and listen. Amen.
[1:40:46] Brother Brandham said the problem is
[1:40:48] people don't stand still long enough to
[1:40:50] hear the message.
[1:40:55] But you know, we like it better when
[1:40:56] it's the other way. As preacher, yeah,
[1:40:58] come on. Let me see if I work up
[1:41:01] something. I learned to do that in the
[1:41:03] Pentecostal church.
[1:41:12] Is that what I want to do? want to work
[1:41:14] y'all up. Come on, let's let's get this
[1:41:16] thing going.
[1:41:23] If the word don't work you up, then I
[1:41:25] don't want nothing else to work me up.
[1:41:28] Amen.
[1:41:30] When a light shines on me,
[1:41:34] it does something to me.
[1:41:39] You don't have to work that up.
[1:41:42] Yeah.
[1:41:47] Thus we have the fulfilling of Luke 17
[1:41:49] and30. Even thus shall it be in the day
[1:41:51] when the son of man is revealed. It's
[1:41:54] revealing.
[1:41:56] So when Christ when Jesus Christ came to
[1:41:59] the third pull of his
[1:42:03] ministry and let me just stop there
[1:42:05] before I go any further with my note
[1:42:07] that I was looking at.
[1:42:09] Remember in our day our prophet used the
[1:42:13] phrase the first second third pull of
[1:42:16] and he referred back to Jesus to Paul
[1:42:18] the different ones in their ministry but
[1:42:20] let's just look at brother Bram's
[1:42:22] ministry what what it was the first
[1:42:24] pull I've talked to people that were
[1:42:27] there and a part of that
[1:42:29] and the crowds were just the biggest the
[1:42:33] miracles were more the supernatural in
[1:42:36] that way it was just beyond anybody's
[1:42:41] thinking. The second pool came and it
[1:42:46] began to discern the thoughts and the
[1:42:47] hearts of the people and there was many
[1:42:50] that did not want that because they knew
[1:42:53] things was wrong in their life and
[1:42:54] they'd get up and walk out and and the
[1:42:56] crowds got smaller
[1:42:59] and the miracles were less
[1:43:02] and yet it was greater.
[1:43:06] Huh.
[1:43:08] And then he came to the third pull
[1:43:11] and as Paul said, "All men have forsaken
[1:43:14] me." Huh? And he had
[1:43:17] preached choosing a bride and people
[1:43:20] that were there said that people just
[1:43:22] getting up and walking out, walking out.
[1:43:26] Huh? The crowds really got
[1:43:29] smaller. He begin to be rejected to
[1:43:32] where even prophecies was going forth
[1:43:34] against him by the some of the great men
[1:43:36] and all.
[1:43:38] and he's washed up. He's lost his
[1:43:41] ministry. He doesn't have the miracles
[1:43:43] he used to have in the supernatural.
[1:43:47] And yet, according to God, it was
[1:43:50] greater. It was greater than the second.
[1:43:53] It was greater than the third. Why? It
[1:43:56] was a light that was shining on those
[1:43:58] that could receive it.
[1:44:01] I grew up near Shripport and Brother
[1:44:04] Brandon preached. It was a second home
[1:44:07] to
[1:44:08] him. Oh, they had some marvelous
[1:44:10] meetings, some great
[1:44:12] supernatural. But you know, the majority
[1:44:15] of the people never saw a message. And
[1:44:18] you'll meet a person here and you'll
[1:44:20] meet one over here and maybe one over
[1:44:23] there that sat in some of those meetings
[1:44:25] that grabbed a hold of the light. The
[1:44:27] light shined upon them and the rest went
[1:44:30] away.
[1:44:36] It's that in in any gathering. Okay. You
[1:44:39] be that one that receives something.
[1:44:43] Somebody will.
[1:44:49] And so Christ came to the third pole of
[1:44:51] his ministry
[1:44:52] and he even challenged them to leave.
[1:44:56] But what was it? They wanted the other
[1:44:58] again. They wanted to go back to the
[1:45:00] fish and the loaves, the healings and
[1:45:02] the supernatural. And they wanted to go
[1:45:04] back to all of those
[1:45:06] things. They said, "We want the
[1:45:08] supernatural in our
[1:45:12] midst." And they turned down the
[1:45:15] supernatural birth of the word. That's
[1:45:17] what happened to Pentecost
[1:45:21] that people want to go back to.
[1:45:30] So there's a
[1:45:35] supernatural. They wanted to go back to
[1:45:37] something
[1:45:38] else. The word was supernatural that the
[1:45:44] message we saw in in this
[1:45:48] ministry Malachi 4 that's come in our
[1:45:52] day. the ministry of the seventh angel
[1:45:54] of revelations
[1:45:56] 10:7 and what we call the message or the
[1:45:59] restoring back of the original word as
[1:46:03] was spoke of by Malachi 4 and5 behold I
[1:46:06] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:46:08] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:46:10] the Lord so if the
[1:46:12] word or we could say the light
[1:46:18] amen
[1:46:22] once again
[1:46:24] has come to restore us people that can
[1:46:29] receive it
[1:46:30] back
[1:46:32] for a rapture.
[1:46:36] No other age this age you see this is
[1:46:39] something different even than
[1:46:42] uh the days of Paul. Okay, you
[1:46:44] understand our prophet said
[1:46:47] that because this is a rapture. They
[1:46:50] didn't rapture back there. We're going
[1:46:52] to rapture.
[1:46:54] And so it it is it is restoring back for
[1:46:58] the rapture and the resurrection of
[1:47:01] those saints that have went by the way
[1:47:03] of the
[1:47:04] grave. We have a politician that
[1:47:08] is telling us that America is going to
[1:47:10] have a golden age. Of course, you know
[1:47:14] that we are having a golden age. We're
[1:47:18] in a golden age.
[1:47:22] They've missed that a long way, haven't
[1:47:24] they? See, we're we're in that. That's
[1:47:27] what it's all about now.
[1:47:31] Yes. I want to be clear. Signs
[1:47:35] and
[1:47:37] healings, supernatural gifts of the
[1:47:39] spirit will still be manifested through
[1:47:42] the word bride. Has to be as with the
[1:47:47] word prophet, but not in the same
[1:47:50] measure. In other
[1:47:52] words, God had one of
[1:47:55] those. And let me say this, and I hope
[1:47:58] nobody misunderstands me. It was a
[1:48:00] one-man ministry.
[1:48:03] Yes, sir.
[1:48:05] That's not me. That's not some pastor,
[1:48:07] some great evangelist, or some great
[1:48:09] great man everybody would flock to. No.
[1:48:12] See, it was a one-man ministry in this
[1:48:15] respect that he had a message to the age
[1:48:19] in that final age. There's not another
[1:48:20] age or another messenger to come or a
[1:48:23] group of men. No, sir. There was a
[1:48:25] one-man ministry and that's what I'm
[1:48:27] preaching to you about. Amen. under the
[1:48:30] umbrella of that, right? Not another
[1:48:33] message. We don't have to reinvent
[1:48:37] Brother Brandham.
[1:48:39] Huh? No, I don't have to reinvent him.
[1:48:44] God already invented him.
[1:48:51] So, we saw those things and in the day
[1:48:56] that we're living
[1:48:57] in. So if the word the light is is re is
[1:49:03] producing that golden age, we're seeing
[1:49:05] the he we yes we have signs, wonders,
[1:49:08] supernatural manifestations of of of
[1:49:12] gifts. They'll always be in the church.
[1:49:14] But maybe, you know, in in Paul's
[1:49:16] ministry in the book of Acts is you see
[1:49:20] the first, second, and third pool. You
[1:49:21] see the great signs, wonders, miracles
[1:49:23] at the beginning toward the end. He was
[1:49:25] almost, you know, it wasn't the same.
[1:49:28] Yes, he had them, but it it was again,
[1:49:31] not Church of Christ, church doctrine.
[1:49:33] No, no, it's not that. But the emphasis
[1:49:36] was placed somewhere else.
[1:49:39] What greater supernatural act could
[1:49:41] there be than to get a change of the
[1:49:43] body and get out of here? The message
[1:49:45] come to produce that you are that.
[1:49:49] Yes, sir.
[1:49:51] now we're not looking for something
[1:49:54] else. So because for us that are here
[1:50:01] uh those signs and healings and super we
[1:50:04] love them. I mean I wish every there's
[1:50:07] sick people here. There has to be the
[1:50:08] people with dire needs and we'll pray
[1:50:11] for you but that's all we can do is pray
[1:50:14] apply the word do what the word says do
[1:50:16] and then leave it to the word to do it.
[1:50:18] We we can't work that up as Pentecost
[1:50:21] did. Work up a feeling
[1:50:26] that leave it to God. God's a healer. We
[1:50:30] believe in it.
[1:50:34] But to
[1:50:35] us, that's not the main thing.
[1:50:40] Because probably every person that the
[1:50:42] brother Brandham prayed for and was
[1:50:45] supernaturally healed is dead today.
[1:50:51] But there is going to be a people that
[1:50:53] won't die.
[1:50:55] Well, glory.
[1:50:58] Why? Because there was a message.
[1:51:04] I have to be still. I usually at home
[1:51:07] preach in tennis shoes and I got my
[1:51:09] dress shoes on. I didn't want I I have
[1:51:13] to do that cuz my feet are numb. But
[1:51:18] anyway, but I'll have new feet over
[1:51:20] there. Maybe I can dance a jig like some
[1:51:23] of these guys do in the pull pit.
[1:51:28] I'll fall flat on my
[1:51:34] face. But I'm glad that's not the main
[1:51:38] thing. So it's not the main thing. It it
[1:51:41] it is what follows the supernatural
[1:51:44] birth of the word. the the earnest our
[1:51:46] down
[1:51:47] payment, but it's our down but but if we
[1:51:51] if I and I've seen the
[1:51:54] supernatural I have coming up through
[1:51:57] Pentecost and the gifts returning to the
[1:51:59] church and those things. I've saw some
[1:52:02] great supernatural things take
[1:52:05] place. But I'll say if I never see
[1:52:07] another miracle,
[1:52:10] I'll still believe in it.
[1:52:16] It's the fact. And you believe in it,
[1:52:19] don't you? Why? If you never see another
[1:52:22] miracle,
[1:52:24] huh? But why? Because you believe.
[1:52:29] You believe the opening of this was
[1:52:31] supernatural.
[1:52:39] Anything else is just a cheap imitation.
[1:52:42] And it's not the message. Carnal
[1:52:44] impersonations.
[1:52:46] Said, "Brother Ivy, why don't you teach
[1:52:47] us to have spiritual gifts?" Brother
[1:52:49] Brandham said, "You can't do that." He
[1:52:51] said, "All you'll do is produce carnal
[1:52:53] impersonations."
[1:52:57] He had it in his day. Do we want to
[1:53:00] produce more of that?
[1:53:08] So uh so um we want to be aware there
[1:53:12] will be
[1:53:14] supernatural that will follow in our day
[1:53:18] especially many false ones that lead
[1:53:22] people away from
[1:53:25] something away from the
[1:53:27] message while in the message because the
[1:53:30] message isn't in
[1:53:31] them lead people away from Christ the
[1:53:35] word, the revealed word. They will try
[1:53:37] to make the people believe the
[1:53:39] supernatural gifts are the main
[1:53:42] thing. But the Lord will say to them,
[1:53:44] "One day, I never knew you. Depart from
[1:53:46] me, ye that work iniquity."
[1:53:50] Iniquity is
[1:53:51] sin. So what is the
[1:53:54] message? It can mean different things
[1:53:57] even to those among us.
[1:53:59] It can mean to some people a partic
[1:54:01] particular doctrine that they hold to
[1:54:04] that's different from the other
[1:54:05] people's. Uh the message can be a
[1:54:08] certain
[1:54:09] man. Uh it could be a school of thought
[1:54:12] or a certain way that you uh live,
[1:54:17] certain way you talk, certain way that
[1:54:19] you dress. And to them that's the
[1:54:22] message. It can also be just the name
[1:54:25] that identifies our church, our belief.
[1:54:30] I go
[1:54:31] to what do you go to? Yes, such and such
[1:54:35] church.
[1:54:38] And now those things are good, but th
[1:54:41] that is not the
[1:54:42] message. And some leave that saying they
[1:54:46] do not believe the
[1:54:48] message. They didn't leave the message.
[1:54:51] uh they never had the message. They left
[1:54:53] something they thought was the message.
[1:54:55] You understand? You see,
[1:54:58] because many times because they just
[1:55:01] simply been taught wrong.
[1:55:04] That's a dangerous thing.
[1:55:11] When I first come to this message out of
[1:55:13] Pentecost, I scared to death to
[1:55:16] preach just from reading a book or two.
[1:55:20] because they realized how wrong I was
[1:55:24] and how right these things were
[1:55:27] and how serious it was. You see, because
[1:55:30] in Galatians
[1:55:31] 1:8,
[1:55:33] Paul, but though we included him or an
[1:55:37] angel from heaven preach any other
[1:55:39] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:55:41] preached unto you, let him be accursed.
[1:55:44] a curse. That's the Greek word is atheia
[1:55:48] which means to be devoted to destruction
[1:55:51] doomed to eternal punishment. And he
[1:55:54] repeats it again as we said before. So
[1:55:58] say I now again if any man preach any
[1:56:00] other gospel unto you than that ye have
[1:56:03] received let him be
[1:56:06] anthemia doomed to eternal punishment.
[1:56:10] The 10th verse we usually leave off for
[1:56:13] some
[1:56:14] reason, but Paul says,"For do I now
[1:56:17] persuade
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:19] men?" Um, "Do I try to find favor with
[1:56:23] men?" You know, I was a young preacher
[1:56:25] one
[1:56:26] time. I'd have been better off just
[1:56:29] getting me a job and sitting listening
[1:56:31] to somebody else, you know, because I
[1:56:33] thought I knew more than I really
[1:56:36] knew. Why? Because many times you're
[1:56:39] looking for favor of men. You want to
[1:56:41] show them
[1:56:42] that you're a preacher
[1:56:48] and you just need to grow up.
[1:56:51] Oh, you might can preach
[1:56:53] a everybody on their feet.
[1:57:00] But is it to find favor to win favor
[1:57:03] with men? See, Paul said he didn't do
[1:57:06] that. I do I now find favor with men or
[1:57:09] God in what I preach? Because you got to
[1:57:13] preach the truth. Okay. Or you're under
[1:57:15] an athemia. If you got to preach it to
[1:57:18] three people, preach it.
[1:57:22] That's right. Or do I seek to please men
[1:57:24] or yet?
[1:57:26] If I yet please men, that is if I seek
[1:57:30] the popularity
[1:57:33] of men. Amen.
[1:57:39] You know, I thank you for your
[1:57:41] compliments, Brother David. You know,
[1:57:44] but you know, it takes a
[1:57:48] lifetime. I'm an old man. You're an old
[1:57:50] man.
[1:57:52] I mean, you're you don't look a day
[1:57:55] younger than the last time I saw you.
[1:58:09] It takes a lifetime
[1:58:11] not to build a ministry because if
[1:58:13] somebody's trying to build a ministry,
[1:58:15] kick them out.
[1:58:26] But to let Christ be able to work
[1:58:28] through you,
[1:58:30] You understand that?
[1:58:33] You learn how dumb and stupid you are,
[1:58:37] how weak and feeble and helpless you
[1:58:39] are, but he's everything. Amen. If I can
[1:58:44] please him,
[1:58:46] I I don't have to please man if I can
[1:58:50] just please him.
[1:58:54] But you know
[1:58:55] it when I was young, you know, you
[1:58:58] wanted to you wanted people to
[1:59:02] know take the devil by the tail on a
[1:59:06] downhill drag and you just showing
[1:59:14] every
[1:59:16] So Paul said, "For do I now persuade men
[1:59:19] or God or do I seek to please a man? For
[1:59:22] if I yet please a man, I should not be a
[1:59:24] servant of Christ.
[1:59:31] So the message the word message is a
[1:59:35] noun. Uh it the central theme of it
[1:59:40] means the central theme of of
[1:59:43] importance. Martin Luther at the
[1:59:45] reformation carried a message that took
[1:59:48] on his name.
[1:59:50] That's when they made a denomination out
[1:59:53] of it. That wasn't the message that the
[1:59:56] uh that we
[1:59:57] have. Uh the Wesley and church came
[2:00:00] along. The Methodists carrying the name
[2:00:02] of John Wesley, great man of
[2:00:05] God.
[2:00:06] Um Calvin came along with even some some
[2:00:10] great truths. And people were identified
[2:00:13] by their names. They were identified by
[2:00:16] John Wesley,
[2:00:17] John
[2:00:19] Calvin. Does that make anyone a
[2:00:22] Christian? I was in a Methodist church
[2:00:25] here a few years ago doing a wedding for
[2:00:27] someone in the fellowship hall. They
[2:00:30] knew their messenger because they had a
[2:00:31] big picture of of Wesley in there. They
[2:00:34] knew their messenger, but they sure
[2:00:36] didn't follow his message. Huh.
[2:00:44] They carried his
[2:00:47] name. Our children have grown up
[2:00:50] associated with what we believe many
[2:00:52] times from a misconception of what we
[2:00:56] call the message to them. And you young
[2:00:59] people listen to brother Ivy. You look
[2:01:01] up here at me because unless you're
[2:01:03] looking at somebody, you're not
[2:01:04] listening to them.
[2:01:09] children, they they they grow up and
[2:01:12] they get a
[2:01:14] misconception. To them, it's a set of
[2:01:16] rules that they don't want to abide by.
[2:01:18] How how we
[2:01:20] dress or or who we quote and the things
[2:01:25] they can't do that they really want to
[2:01:27] do becomes what the message is to them.
[2:01:31] Therefore, many of our children will
[2:01:33] come to the place they question what we
[2:01:35] call the message. Say, "Well, I don't
[2:01:38] believe
[2:01:40] that." Then they
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:43] blame what they think is wrong on how
[2:01:47] they were raised, their parents, and
[2:01:49] even on brother
[2:01:51] Brandham. And what they're really
[2:01:54] questioning is not the message,
[2:01:58] but certain rules, certain ways that we
[2:02:01] live, certain things that we live
[2:02:04] by. What they say we why can't I do like
[2:02:09] others that dress and live
[2:02:12] differently. That is when they say, "I
[2:02:15] don't believe the message which has
[2:02:17] nothing to do with what we believe.
[2:02:22] The truth is that they have never
[2:02:24] believed Christ the word in their heart
[2:02:26] in their life.
[2:02:28] Yeah. My grandma was born in 19 n
[2:02:34] uh 18 18 not 19
[2:02:39] 1898 I
[2:02:41] think. Never cut her hair. Always wore
[2:02:44] dress. She's a Baptist. Always lived a
[2:02:46] holy and godly life. She's born before a
[2:02:49] prophet ever come on the scene was ever
[2:02:53] alive. Those things he didn't invent.
[2:03:00] The things that we believe he didn't
[2:03:01] invent,
[2:03:03] they were always here.
[2:03:08] He just made us aware of it. Amen.
[2:03:12] Amen.
[2:03:17] So the truth is that they never believe
[2:03:19] Christ the word. Say the
[2:03:22] message can mean the same as saying I'm
[2:03:25] a Methodist. I'm following John Wesley,
[2:03:29] a Baptist. I'm a Pentecostal. I believe
[2:03:32] in the gifts back in the church. Let me
[2:03:35] quote brother Brandham from Easter Seal.
[2:03:37] I'm wondering today it's what's
[2:03:40] happening. Are we really getting the
[2:03:41] people to God? Are we getting them to
[2:03:44] church? We must get them to Christ where
[2:03:48] this quickening power. It's good to go
[2:03:50] to church. Sure. If that's as far as we
[2:03:53] go, it's not far enough. When you come
[2:03:56] to church, that's good. But go on to
[2:03:58] Christ
[2:04:00] from the church because we must receive
[2:04:03] the quickening power. That's the power
[2:04:05] to get us out of here. Do we ever expect
[2:04:08] to be in the general resurrection?
[2:04:10] Because it's the only thing that will
[2:04:12] ever bring us from the dead.
[2:04:15] For if this spirit that raised up Jesus
[2:04:17] from the dead dwell in you, it'll
[2:04:19] quicken and make bring to life your
[2:04:22] mortal bodies. What a promise to
[2:04:25] us. Going to try to bring this down real
[2:04:28] quick. So hang with me. So how do we get
[2:04:30] in
[2:04:31] Christ? Get into the word.
[2:04:37] You know, I hope this will be okay what
[2:04:40] I'm going to say, Brother David. But,
[2:04:42] and I'm sure it is because I know you. I
[2:04:44] know you very
[2:04:46] well. There's one message.
[2:04:53] There's one Lord.
[2:04:55] Huh?
[2:04:57] One word.
[2:04:59] The same word that will save an old man
[2:05:04] will save a teenager
[2:05:06] or a young child. It doesn't take a
[2:05:08] different message. Huh? A different
[2:05:12] gathering. No, it doesn't. Our prophet
[2:05:16] never did emphasize Sunday school. We
[2:05:17] have Sunday school at our church. Okay.
[2:05:20] And our kids love it and I'm glad we do.
[2:05:22] But but what I'm saying, he never
[2:05:23] emphasized that
[2:05:26] and these other things. Why? He
[2:05:28] emphasized one thing, the word. Yes.
[2:05:32] When I was a 16-year-old boy in the
[2:05:34] Assembly of God church, I remember
[2:05:36] brother Kennedy, my pastor, and I
[2:05:39] remember him clearly because he had butt
[2:05:40] teeth and he wore glasses, but he'd get
[2:05:42] up there and preach and conviction would
[2:05:44] grip my heart while he was preaching as
[2:05:47] a six-year-old boy. And I'd come down to
[2:05:50] the altar at the end of the service.
[2:05:52] Now, I can remember I'd be the LA first
[2:05:54] one down, the last one up. My daddy
[2:05:56] would come and he'd shake me to see if I
[2:05:58] was asleep. I wasn't asleep. I wanted
[2:06:01] God. Amen. Why? It didn't take a a
[2:06:04] special youth meeting to do it.
[2:06:08] It took the word preached.
[2:06:14] I'm not against those things. I'm just
[2:06:16] telling you what it takes.
[2:06:20] If it's going to take a youth camp to
[2:06:21] get you saved, it'll take a youth camp
[2:06:23] to keep you saved.
[2:06:27] Come on now.
[2:06:29] Get them to the word.
[2:06:31] Not the letter of the word or set of
[2:06:33] rules, but to the life of the word. 1
[2:06:35] Corinthians 12:13. For by one spirit
[2:06:38] we're all baptized in one body, whether
[2:06:40] we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
[2:06:42] bond or free, have been made to drink of
[2:06:45] the spirit.
[2:06:56] Oh, I was praying about this message
[2:06:59] here a few weeks ago at our home church
[2:07:02] and I was going to it was on a Tuesday
[2:07:04] night. I praying about this very
[2:07:07] subject. What is the message? And I
[2:07:10] thought, you know, I I I just wish I had
[2:07:13] something that Brother Brandham said in
[2:07:16] regards to that, though he said many
[2:07:18] things, but something that would really
[2:07:19] strike home. And I went to bed and I was
[2:07:22] tired and trying to sleep and I and I
[2:07:24] took my cell phone. I put a started
[2:07:27] listening to the sermon, the rapture.
[2:07:29] Heard it many times. And and I started
[2:07:32] listening to it and I heard brother
[2:07:34] Brandham say this. It was at the
[2:07:36] beginning of the service and it was an
[2:07:38] and when he preached the rapture, it was
[2:07:40] denominational people there, great men.
[2:07:43] And before he preached, there was
[2:07:45] several men that got up that believed in
[2:07:47] brother Brandham and believed in what we
[2:07:48] call the message. And they they
[2:07:50] commented about the message, the message
[2:07:52] of the hour, the message, which was kind
[2:07:54] of a strange term to them people. And
[2:07:56] brother Brandham goes up behind them.
[2:07:58] And he says, "Many of you strangers
[2:07:59] perhaps hear these men get up and make
[2:08:02] these remarks about a message of this
[2:08:05] hour." And so forth. What they're
[2:08:07] getting at is God's promise of this hour
[2:08:12] that he promised what he would do. And
[2:08:15] we see him scripturally vindicating just
[2:08:18] exactly what he said he would do in the
[2:08:21] same manner. Amen. Now look, telling you
[2:08:25] what the message is in the sermon,
[2:08:27] spiritual food, brother Brandham said
[2:08:32] Jesus was the word that was prophesied
[2:08:38] of.
[2:08:40] You get this? I'm closing on this. Get
[2:08:42] it? He was the word. He was the message
[2:08:46] for that day. You know, he said the
[2:08:49] message and the messenger are one.
[2:08:51] Didn't he say that? Thus sayith the
[2:08:54] Lord.
[2:08:55] Huh?
[2:09:00] So Jesus was the word that was
[2:09:03] prophesied. He was what the prophet said
[2:09:05] would happen. Now listen, don't miss
[2:09:09] it. The prophet said, "A virgin shall
[2:09:13] conceive." All those prophecies had been
[2:09:16] given. David crying and the rest of the
[2:09:19] prophets down through the ages speaking
[2:09:21] of him. What am I saying? The message
[2:09:26] is don't you know that
[2:09:30] we're the fulfillment of the promises.
[2:09:34] Amen.
[2:09:36] Just as Jesus was a fulfillment of the
[2:09:38] promises, just like God sent Elijah as a
[2:09:42] fulfillment of the promises, you're here
[2:09:45] as a fulfillment of the promises.
[2:09:47] There's the message.
[2:09:51] The message is standing here in front of
[2:09:52] you. The message is sitting over there.
[2:09:57] Look over at the person next to you and
[2:09:59] say, "You're the message, my dear
[2:10:01] brother, my dear sister." Amen. either
[2:10:04] play the instruments
[2:10:06] come. It's what the Holy Spirit does in
[2:10:09] us. Not a church system or doctrine of
[2:10:12] man. And whoever plays the instruments,
[2:10:14] maybe KFC, you could play that song. It
[2:10:17] is no secret what God can do. He's
[2:10:20] revealed
[2:10:21] himself. And
[2:10:23] u we sing that. Maybe if there's a
[2:10:25] special need or something, we'll be glad
[2:10:29] to pray for you. Let's bow our heads
[2:10:31] together.
[2:10:33] Heavenly Father, we come to the
[2:10:35] conclusion of this sermon and pray Lord
[2:10:38] that there was something said that'll
[2:10:42] make a difference in somebody's life
[2:10:44] here. Lord, maybe just a sentence, just
[2:10:47] a few words that they took out of this
[2:10:50] sermon. May they take it
[2:10:51] home. May they place it in their heart.
[2:10:55] May it be real to them. Jesus Christ's
[2:10:58] name we pray. Amen.
[2:11:05] Arms wide
[2:11:10] open.
[2:11:18] Hon it is.
[2:11:23] Let's stand. Let's all stand and sing
[2:11:26] it. what
[2:11:27] God can
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:32] do. It
[2:11:35] is been revealed in our days. may
[2:11:39] know why
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:49] God
[2:11:57] for
[2:12:01] you with
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:12] The Lord is dealing with hearts right
[2:12:14] now. Just yield to him.
[2:12:17] Maybe you've been a Christian a long
[2:12:19] time. Just yield to him. Yield to his
[2:12:23] word. What
[2:12:25] God can
[2:12:27] do. Sing it again to him.
[2:12:31] It is no
[2:12:37] secret what
[2:12:40] God can do.
[2:12:46] I stand
[2:12:52] for
[2:12:54] healing for
[2:12:59] you. With
[2:13:01] arms wide
[2:13:06] open, he'll part in you.
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:15] in the
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:21] sea. But
[2:13:26] God, you know,
[2:13:29] I made a note on a comment that
[2:13:34] brother Bill made. He said, "Brother
[2:13:37] Brennan didn't invent those things.
[2:13:41] They were always true.
[2:13:44] Holiness was always true.
[2:13:47] Paul preached a woman shouldn't cut her
[2:13:50] hair.
[2:13:52] Paul preached that they should be modest
[2:13:55] in apparel,
[2:13:56] [Music]
[2:13:58] not wearing braided and jewelry and
[2:14:02] lipstick and all those things that that
[2:14:05] that those were that was the word of
[2:14:08] God. Amen.
[2:14:10] And I just thought as I he was talking,
[2:14:13] you know, the message was him. Yes.
[2:14:17] Without
[2:14:19] man's, you know, like these
[2:14:22] sticky papers, you know what I mean? I
[2:14:25] get so many of them in my Bible. I got
[2:14:27] it. But here was the word of God and man
[2:14:30] just kept coming putting stuff on it,
[2:14:33] adding to it, adding to it, taking away
[2:14:36] from it. And so where it wasn't him
[2:14:38] anymore,
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:40] it just wasn't what he was. It wasn't
[2:14:44] what he did. It wasn't how he saved. It
[2:14:47] wasn't how he moved. There was there was
[2:14:51] no
[2:14:52] voice that spoke for what that the word
[2:14:57] truly was. And then there came one to
[2:15:00] restore back the word of God. To peel
[2:15:04] all man's thinking off, to peel all
[2:15:07] man's interpretation off, all man's
[2:15:10] evidence of what the spirit was, how the
[2:15:12] spirit
[2:15:14] moved. He come back. He says God works
[2:15:17] from the
[2:15:18] inside. And he just he just took
[2:15:21] everything off of it and let it sit
[2:15:24] there in its purity.
[2:15:28] the word of
[2:15:30] God that Jesus Christ is a person.
[2:15:34] He's a living being.
[2:15:37] You know, how do you think the first
[2:15:39] church, how do you think they spread the
[2:15:42] gospel? How do you think they'd walk
[2:15:45] into a place where nobody ever heard
[2:15:48] about them and they started talking
[2:15:51] about one that came and they started
[2:15:53] talking about a sacrifice being made?
[2:15:57] You know, how could they do that?
[2:15:59] Because that living presence of that
[2:16:03] being was there with them.
[2:16:09] There was a
[2:16:10] presence. It wasn't intellectual.
[2:16:15] It wasn't intellectual, right? They had
[2:16:18] a life in them. And and they believe
[2:16:22] when they prayed for
[2:16:25] somebody that the life that they were
[2:16:27] experiencing,
[2:16:29] the life that was in them would transfer
[2:16:34] to the person that they were praying
[2:16:36] for.
[2:16:38] The words that they spoke, there was a
[2:16:41] life that stood behind those words as
[2:16:45] our brother said and it convicted the
[2:16:48] heart and it pricricked the heart. How
[2:16:50] was Pentecost started?
[2:16:53] When they heard these words, their
[2:16:56] hearts were pricricked
[2:17:01] and they said, "Men, what must we do?"
[2:17:04] He said, "Repent
[2:17:07] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:17:09] Jesus Christ, and you shall receive the
[2:17:12] same spirit.
[2:17:14] This same anointing will transfer from
[2:17:18] us to you." And that's the question that
[2:17:23] I believe that our brother is posing.
[2:17:26] Has we got away? The message isn't
[2:17:29] Malachi 4:5. It was the fulfillment of
[2:17:32] Malachi 4:5 by the presence of the Lord
[2:17:36] Jesus Christ keeping the promises that
[2:17:40] he promised to do.
[2:17:45] That's still the message. Jesus keeps
[2:17:48] his word. Yes.
[2:17:52] If you can this morning, if you could
[2:17:54] take any promise in this
[2:17:57] book and you can reach up and grab the
[2:18:00] hem of the garment of that promise
[2:18:04] and you can say, "I believe this word,
[2:18:08] there is a life and a person,
[2:18:12] a real being that'll come by and make
[2:18:16] that promise real in your life." Amen.
[2:18:20] Amen. That's the message that our
[2:18:23] brother was preaching.
[2:18:26] That he's here
[2:18:29] and he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:18:31] forever.
[2:18:33] And he'll do for you exceedingly
[2:18:37] and abundantly above what you could ask
[2:18:40] or think. You have a loved one on your
[2:18:43] heart this morning. He promised you your
[2:18:46] loved ones.
[2:18:50] You have a need this morning.
[2:18:53] He promised that he'd meet that need.
[2:18:57] He didn't say you had to meet it. He
[2:19:00] didn't say you had to do anything but
[2:19:02] believe.
[2:19:04] Only believe.
[2:19:06] All things are possible. Because the
[2:19:09] same Jesus that went to Calvary is the
[2:19:13] same Jesus that's here this morning.
[2:19:16] And he can make himself known to
[2:19:19] you if you will invite him in your
[2:19:22] heart.
[2:19:26] Doesn't matter how old you are.
[2:19:30] I kn my office a year or so ago with a
[2:19:34] man. I would say he's in his
[2:19:38] late 40s and 50s. He knelt in my office
[2:19:42] and gave his heart to the Lord.
[2:19:47] And he got up and I made him come walk.
[2:19:52] And he wrapped his arms around me and I
[2:19:56] said, "How are you, brother?" He says,
[2:19:58] "I'm I'm I'm a new man."
[2:20:01] I'm a new man.
[2:20:04] Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] You know why? Cuz he got the message.
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:11] He received the message. Amen. The
[2:20:14] message is Jesus Christ the same
[2:20:17] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:20:24] Have you let the
[2:20:29] message that Malachi 4:5 preached come
[2:20:33] into your heart this
[2:20:36] morning? I think I have room in my heart
[2:20:40] for him this morning.
[2:20:43] Lord, I just want to get back
[2:20:46] to where it's you. I'm not judging. I
[2:20:49] don't care what road the person goes
[2:20:52] down, what they believe, what their
[2:20:54] doctrine
[2:20:56] is. But like the prophet of God said in
[2:20:59] harvest time, he said, Jesus prayed,
[2:21:01] "Father, that they may be one.
[2:21:06] Father, that you and they may be one as
[2:21:09] I am one with you. Yes. that they would
[2:21:12] be one with you also. One with you and
[2:21:15] one with me. And that we could be one
[2:21:19] together.
[2:21:21] Are you one with him this morning? Ask
[2:21:23] yourself,
[2:21:25] he wants to be one with you.
[2:21:30] He wants to be one with you this
[2:21:33] morning. Well, let's just pray. man. If
[2:21:36] you'd like to invite him back into your
[2:21:39] life this
[2:21:40] morning, maybe you've got away from him
[2:21:43] a little
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:46] bit. Maybe you've
[2:21:48] pursued careers above him.
[2:21:53] And maybe habits and pleasures have got
[2:21:57] into your life. Maybe your life's being
[2:22:01] invaded by video games
[2:22:03] and by social
[2:22:06] media, by sports or by music
[2:22:10] or or by so many things that the enemy
[2:22:14] offers
[2:22:17] today to take your time to take your
[2:22:21] focus.
[2:22:23] And this morning you'd like to say,
[2:22:24] "Father, I want to get
[2:22:27] back to the true message,
[2:22:30] which is Christ in me, the hope of
[2:22:34] glory. For if that same spirit that was
[2:22:37] in Christ Jesus dwell in
[2:22:40] me, it'll
[2:22:42] quicken our mortal body."
[2:22:50] And you just ask in your spirit this
[2:22:52] morning. Just be honest with
[2:22:56] yourself. All our heads are bowed. My
[2:22:59] head's
[2:23:00] bowed. And you just like to lift your
[2:23:03] hand this morning to him and say, "Lord,
[2:23:05] I I need a revival in my
[2:23:09] heart. I need to have your presence in
[2:23:12] my life. I
[2:23:15] believe the things that brother Random
[2:23:18] taught. I believe that who he was and
[2:23:23] the scriptures that he
[2:23:26] fulfilled. And I believe that the rules
[2:23:30] and the the standards that are
[2:23:35] set, but I've never had the God of
[2:23:39] that
[2:23:40] word it taking residence in my heart.
[2:23:46] And I want to
[2:23:47] experience the inddwelling presence of
[2:23:51] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:23:54] Some call it the baptism of the Holy
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:59] Spirit. That's the same thing. The
[2:24:01] inddwelling presence of Almighty God
[2:24:06] coming into my
[2:24:08] [Music]
[2:24:09] heart. And you might say he was there,
[2:24:14] but I strayed
[2:24:17] away. I went places that he couldn't go.
[2:24:23] and my life has grown cold and
[2:24:27] indifferent. And this morning, I'd like
[2:24:29] to go back to that place,
[2:24:31] Lord. I'd like to stand before you and
[2:24:34] invite you back into my
[2:24:38] life. Lord, come back to me this
[2:24:41] morning.
[2:24:43] rededicate my heart this morning,
[2:24:46] Father, to
[2:24:47] you that the words of
[2:24:51] life might be present in me, beyond my
[2:24:55] mind, Father, that I might absolutely
[2:24:57] feel your inddwelling spirit in my heart
[2:25:01] and my life that the love of God may be
[2:25:04] shed
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:09] abroad by the Holy Spirit.
[2:25:13] Father, I ask that every hand that was
[2:25:15] raised, every heart that turned to you,
[2:25:18] Father, may they know that there is a
[2:25:20] true
[2:25:22] experience that the
[2:25:25] believer comes in contact
[2:25:29] with that they know it's real and they
[2:25:32] can say, "I meant him. He meant me that
[2:25:37] day. He meant me in that hour. He meant
[2:25:40] me in that place. I knew he was
[2:25:44] there and I felt him take me in his
[2:25:47] arms and change
[2:25:51] me. Once again, if that's your heart's
[2:25:54] desire, just let him
[2:25:58] know cuz he wants to
[2:26:00] be with you and in
[2:26:04] you cuz that's his promise. I will not
[2:26:08] leave you comfortless, but I'll come
[2:26:11] again and I'll be with you
[2:26:15] even in you. Father, many of us have you
[2:26:19] with us, but Lord, our desire is to have
[2:26:22] you in us. Grant it, Lord. We pray this
[2:26:26] morning in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[2:26:32] Amen. Don't you love him? Isn't he Isn't
[2:26:35] he wonderful? Amen. Amen. I I like what
[2:26:39] what brother Bess say he says he coined
[2:26:42] the word the bride age.
[2:26:44] Amen. And what's the bride getting ready
[2:26:47] for a rapture? Amen. Do you think about
[2:26:51] the rapture? We sing that song, don't
[2:26:54] we? I'm thinking about a rapture.
[2:26:58] Amen. Just think about it. Oh my Bill.
[2:27:02] One day we're going to fly away. We'll
[2:27:05] be changed in the twinkling in the eye.
[2:27:08] Amen. We're we're we we'll go up to back
[2:27:12] to Eden to where we always been. That's
[2:27:16] what we live
[2:27:17] for. And how are we going to get there?
[2:27:20] Because that spirit dwells in
[2:27:24] us. And and it and we don't have to have
[2:27:27] religion.
[2:27:29] We don't have to have organization. We
[2:27:32] don't have to have doctrine. We have to
[2:27:33] have him.
[2:27:35] And I'm thinking about that. Amen. Oh,
[2:27:39] I'm thinking of the rapture
[2:27:51] in the heavenly.
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:04] Oh are gathering

[2:28:46] Heat. Heat.

[2:30:06] Hey,
[2:30:27] [Music]
[2:30:36] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:48] Amen. Remember church, this is a leaving
[2:30:51] message. It's not a staying message.
[2:30:54] We're not learning how to live here.
[2:30:56] We're learning how to leave here. Amen.
[2:30:59] God bless you. If you can tonight, the
[2:31:04] secret of the rapture is going to be
[2:31:08] revealed. And only those that are here
[2:31:10] tonight will get the secret to go to in
[2:31:13] the rapture.
[2:31:14] So if you have something that's more
[2:31:17] important than that, then do what you're
[2:31:20] going to do.
[2:31:21] But if you can sacrifice
[2:31:23] [Music]
[2:31:26] to be translated from this life to the
[2:31:28] other life, then I welcome you to come
[2:31:32] back
[2:31:35] because I don't know how much longer I I
[2:31:38] have here because God gives you so many
[2:31:40] years.
[2:31:41] Bill, I think I'm a little older than
[2:31:43] you, aren't I? Little bit. Little bit.
[2:31:46] Uhhuh. So, he's not as old man as he
[2:31:49] thinks he is, cuz I'm just getting
[2:31:51] started.
[2:31:53] Hallelujah. God's good, isn't he? All
[2:31:56] the time. God bless you. You are
[2:31:58] dismissed. Come back tonight at
[2:32:01] 5:00. Everybody come back. And remember,
[2:32:04] God is good. He's good all the time. So,
[2:32:08] if you're walking, don't worry. He's got
[2:32:10] your back. Oh, if you're
[2:32:14] walking through the
[2:32:17] valley and the
[2:32:19] shadows all
[2:32:22] [Music]
[2:32:23] around. Oh, do not
[2:32:26] fear. He will guide
[2:32:29] you. He will keep you safe and
[2:32:36] sound.
[2:32:44] Heat. Heat.

[2:33:20] were sinners.
[2:33:23] Oh, I'm
[2:33:35] worthy.
