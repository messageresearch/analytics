[36:18] we ask you to bless us in jesus name we
[36:20] pray
[36:21] amen amen god bless you
[36:24] let's uh open our bibles and
[36:29] to
[36:33] the gospel of the acts the book of acts
[36:38] the fourth uh chapter
[36:42] of the book of acts and uh we'll read
[36:45] this and i'll read the question that
[36:48] we're gonna answer and uh it's a good
[36:51] question
[36:52] uh and uh uh
[36:56] so just listen to the question don't
[36:58] read anything into it just
[36:59] listen to it it's a good question if
[37:03] if malakai is so great
[37:06] and holy why don't we baptize
[37:10] in his name amen father we ask you to
[37:14] bless this question to us
[37:16] as we answer it now in in
[37:20] jesus name we pray so let's go to
[37:23] uh this scripture in acts that we're
[37:26] going to read
[37:27] in in acts 12. now
[37:31] why was uh you know malachi is so great
[37:35] and holy well first of all you've got to
[37:37] understand who malachi was
[37:40] the whole message is malachi is
[37:43] god he's emorphy
[37:47] he just changed from an invisible
[37:51] to something visible so he could have
[37:54] fellowship
[37:55] it's that simple it's the same
[37:58] person it's not a different person god
[38:01] became a person
[38:03] melchio melchizedek and it says
[38:06] in this message it's in that form
[38:09] that he dwelt so he stayed in the form
[38:12] of malchezadat
[38:14] he meant abraham and then and we'll
[38:17] we'll preach that after we
[38:19] answer this question but why don't we
[38:22] baptize
[38:24] in the name of melchizedek
[38:27] well melchizedek turned into jesus
[38:31] okay but here's why we don't
[38:34] if the word told us to baptize in the
[38:37] name of melchizedek
[38:39] everybody in that water i'd baptize them
[38:42] in the name of melchizedek
[38:45] you you know what i'm saying but here's
[38:48] why we baptize
[38:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[38:53] so in the in uh
[38:57] uh so it's it's a great uh
[39:00] story here in the scriptures
[39:04] and uh uh
[39:08] we're we know that the disciples and
[39:10] everything were preaching the gospel and
[39:12] they've been put in jail
[39:14] they've went all these things and now
[39:16] we'll start
[39:17] in the in the fifth verse and it says
[39:22] and it came to pass on the morrow that
[39:24] their rulers and
[39:26] elders and scribes and i anonymized the
[39:29] high priest and
[39:32] caput and and john and
[39:35] alexander and as many as were
[39:38] of the kindred of the high priest were
[39:41] gathered together
[39:43] at jerusalem and when they had
[39:46] set them in the midst they
[39:50] asked by what power
[39:53] or by what name have
[39:56] you done this well they just
[39:59] made the poor man walk you know
[40:01] and a few little terrible things like
[40:03] that
[40:05] you know what i mean he needed a blind
[40:07] eye and
[40:08] people were put out in their shadows and
[40:10] gets well isn't it amazing that
[40:13] that if people don't believe or like
[40:16] what you do they don't even want to see
[40:18] any blessings
[40:19] go off on anybody else you know
[40:23] uh but anyway so he's saying by what
[40:26] name by what authority or what power
[40:30] name have you done this and peter lifted
[40:33] filled with the holy ghost said unto
[40:36] them
[40:38] ye rulers of the people and elders of
[40:40] israel
[40:42] so he's not angry at him for asking the
[40:45] question
[40:46] you know what i mean it's a great
[40:48] opportunity
[40:49] and so he says yeah he says in elijah
[40:54] if we this day be examined
[40:57] of the good deed done to this impotent
[41:01] man
[41:02] by what means he is made whole
[41:07] but it be it
[41:10] known unto you all and to
[41:13] all the people of israel that
[41:17] by the name of jesus christ
[41:20] of nazareth whom ye crucified
[41:23] whom god raised from the dead
[41:26] even by him that this man stand
[41:30] here before you whole it is
[41:34] the stone which was set at not
[41:37] of you builders which has become
[41:41] the head of the corner for neither
[41:45] there is salvation in any other
[41:48] and there is none other name under
[41:51] heaven given
[41:53] among men whereby we
[41:56] must be saved god bless you you may be
[42:00] seated
[42:01] and and yeah if i would have
[42:04] had the opportunity to have this
[42:05] question earlier i would have looked up
[42:08] more scriptures but also he says all
[42:10] things that you do
[42:11] do in the name of the lord and
[42:15] so it it's it's beautiful in in the
[42:19] in in the context that that
[42:25] melchizedek's not a separate person from
[42:27] god
[42:28] melchizedek is god amorphy
[42:32] or god changing in to a person
[42:36] and a form so he can be brought out
[42:40] contact and fellowship okay
[42:43] but so that that is who
[42:47] that he is so if
[42:50] it's not the question that if
[42:54] if malak the mel keys deck
[42:57] is so great and holy well
[43:01] he was only great and holy because he
[43:03] was god
[43:05] now however great and holy you want to
[43:08] make god that's up to you
[43:11] but that's what he was
[43:14] and and i didn't say that
[43:17] the prophet of god simply said
[43:20] malachi is god he's gaudy more faith
[43:25] he changed his state and
[43:28] uh so uh if it in that
[43:31] it's it's about that simple
[43:34] uh uh uh is a few other places that
[43:39] he makes this statement so
[43:43] let me just read a couple of those
[43:46] statements again
[43:47] to so we can understand this
[43:51] it okay says and this is
[43:54] uh from who is this mal kisada
[44:01] and he says now the difference between
[44:04] him
[44:05] and you as a son he was at
[44:08] the beginning so he's talking what's the
[44:12] difference between
[44:14] malach malki's attack in you
[44:18] right so he says he was at the beginning
[44:22] and another statement
[44:26] he says is why that jesus knew all
[44:29] things
[44:30] is because he was at the beginning
[44:35] and so he says now that's a difference
[44:39] between him and you as a son he and that
[44:43] also means daughters
[44:45] he he was at the beginning
[44:48] the word amorphy body
[44:51] he came and and lived
[44:55] in that in the person of malchezadec
[45:00] then later we never heard no more
[45:04] of maltese adapt because he became
[45:08] jesus christ okay
[45:12] so that's that's what
[45:15] uh he is so it's
[45:19] it's not there wasn't a difference
[45:22] between
[45:23] malchezadec and jesus except
[45:26] for the body the life
[45:29] was the same life but they had different
[45:33] purposes
[45:34] and different manifestation
[45:37] and so and then he says uh
[45:41] and he then another place we could read
[45:45] just to kind of say the same thing
[45:48] he says now the true revelation of
[45:51] malchezadec comes into view what he
[45:55] was god
[45:58] the word so if we just broke the
[46:01] thing it says if matt if melchizedek
[46:04] is so great and holy so what
[46:08] makes him so great and holy is simply
[46:11] the fact that he's god
[46:14] now other people might refer to him
[46:18] as other things but all it was was the
[46:21] transformation
[46:23] of god becoming a
[46:27] person and when he showed up till now
[46:31] to visit abraham abraham
[46:34] recognized him as like a high priest
[46:38] well there wasn't even the high priest
[46:40] yet
[46:42] i mean levi hadn't even been born
[46:45] and that's a whole nother bible
[46:48] as a study in itself but yet
[46:51] uh so that that's what he was so
[46:56] the reason that god is categorizing
[47:00] these and
[47:00] i'm trying to find a segue into what i
[47:03] want to say
[47:04] in identifying all these different
[47:07] offices
[47:08] so we can see the condensing of god
[47:13] god changing his veil
[47:17] but he talks in this message changing
[47:20] his
[47:20] tent so first of all he
[47:23] comes and he's a person and then he
[47:26] creates adam and we know
[47:28] the fall so we can have his attributes
[47:30] then
[47:31] he comes to abraham and gives abraham
[47:34] the promise of redemption
[47:38] and and and we are children of abraham
[47:42] because we're the children of
[47:45] faith in revelation and so paul
[47:49] taught that it wasn't the natural seed
[47:52] of abraham what made what
[47:56] made abraham uh have favor
[47:59] with god and be a friend of god was he
[48:03] believed
[48:04] that god was able to perform that which
[48:07] he promised
[48:08] so it wasn't the natural seed
[48:12] of abraham that brought salvation it was
[48:15] the faith seed of abraham
[48:18] so if abraham would have rejected it
[48:22] which i don't believe he could have but
[48:24] if we can
[48:25] talk about uh i forget what they
[48:29] they call those hypotheticals right
[48:32] which don't really amount to nothing i i
[48:35] just believe we'd have a different name
[48:37] than abraham because god was going to
[48:40] carry forth his plan
[48:42] but he knew abraham he knew what he was
[48:44] he knew what was in him
[48:45] and so he he brought that to uh
[48:49] to pass and so we don't baptize
[48:52] in we don't baptize in the name of
[48:55] melchizedek
[48:57] we don't baptize in in the name of
[49:00] brother branham because
[49:02] the lord put salvation in the name of
[49:06] jesus
[49:07] so it it was the name of something
[49:11] also in com encompasses all the
[49:14] attributes and all
[49:16] uh the nature of something
[49:19] it it's in his name you come in
[49:22] somebody's name
[49:24] you're coming with his authority so when
[49:27] if i if billy came in my name and he
[49:29] said
[49:30] brother david is asking you to do such
[49:33] and such or
[49:35] maybe one of the deacons would go out
[49:37] there and say brother david
[49:38] asked me to have you move your car
[49:42] or or something like that well if they
[49:44] come in my name
[49:45] what they're coming is it is in my
[49:48] office as a pastor
[49:50] in in the authority that's been given
[49:53] and so when you come in somebody's name
[49:56] you if you come in
[49:57] in with the power and authority that is
[50:01] delegated and with the power that he has
[50:04] we talk about the policeman right he
[50:07] throws up
[50:07] his hand to say stop and and a a car
[50:12] well 500 horsepower comes screeching to
[50:15] a halt
[50:16] well don't think that he did that by the
[50:19] power
[50:20] of raising his hand he did it because he
[50:23] came
[50:24] in the name of the city in the authority
[50:28] of the city
[50:29] to arrest you and and impound your car
[50:33] and to make you pay
[50:36] for an unwise act and so
[50:40] that's where his power and authority
[50:43] well jesus said all power and authority
[50:47] has been given to me
[50:50] i have the power to take my life
[50:53] to lay down my life and take it up again
[50:58] so we see that
[51:01] that that's the reason that name
[51:04] is that there's no other name under
[51:07] heaven
[51:08] where by a man could be saved outside
[51:11] the name
[51:12] of the lord jesus christ well that means
[51:15] outside the name and be of power
[51:18] and his authority nobody else can grant
[51:22] eternal life but him now remember
[51:25] jesus just isn't the man though he was
[51:29] that man
[51:30] that was born in nazareth but what the
[51:33] life that was in him was
[51:35] the word so he was the word
[51:39] remember so before he was jesus
[51:43] he was the word and when he appeared
[51:47] to abraham he had
[51:50] a a body but it wasn't a body
[51:54] that came by sin
[51:58] okay like our bodies did so he didn't
[52:01] appear to
[52:03] abraham and if i use this terminology
[52:06] and
[52:06] i don't like to use it but he didn't he
[52:09] didn't come by a
[52:10] sexual body by the in in embedding
[52:13] through marriage
[52:14] that produces this body
[52:18] that that that whole act was a result
[52:21] of unbelief it's and that's where it is
[52:24] and god
[52:25] made it a holy act by placing
[52:29] the uh matrimony and and the coming
[52:33] together
[52:33] and being married and therefore it's
[52:36] just not a wild
[52:37] act that goes on between anybody who
[52:40] wants to but it becomes a sacred thing
[52:42] by which god has them multiply and
[52:45] replenish
[52:46] the earth and so when we see
[52:50] that he showed up in that
[52:54] great uh body that he was
[52:59] in in abraham then
[53:02] then uh we get the uh a beautiful
[53:06] picture
[53:07] and so if we would go over to paragraph
[53:11] uh 111
[53:14] and it says who is this melchizedek
[53:18] but god so if
[53:21] if you look at melchizedek as anything
[53:24] other than god
[53:25] and then you look at jesus just as the
[53:28] flesh
[53:29] man it wasn't just think of what god
[53:32] did jesus was the lamb of god
[53:39] he actually created a body
[53:44] he did in the womb of mary
[53:48] so that life would take the same journey
[53:52] that every one of us took the molecules
[53:55] the cells
[53:56] the the miracle of life
[53:59] he was born the same way we were born he
[54:02] was born in a major through birth pains
[54:05] through
[54:06] everything else he came in the world
[54:08] world he was
[54:09] wrapped in swaddling clothes nobody knew
[54:12] who he was
[54:13] nobody would believe at all that this
[54:15] was the son of god that this was a
[54:17] virgin
[54:18] that conceived but who was it
[54:23] it was melchizedek god
[54:27] the word becoming flesh
[54:34] and then he said oh lord if it's
[54:37] possible
[54:38] let this cup go from me
[54:41] and then he says but it's for this cause
[54:44] that i have come into the world
[54:47] he sent his son
[54:50] to pay the price for
[54:54] our sins and our unbelief
[54:58] that all the chastisement of
[55:01] our sins was upon him all the correction
[55:04] all the punishment that should be due us
[55:07] and everything
[55:08] he took it all and paid it all
[55:12] can there's no other sacrifice for sin
[55:15] you can go out here and kill bunnies
[55:18] and burn whatever you want to burn
[55:20] there's only one place
[55:22] that god meets the believer that's under
[55:24] the shed blood of the lord jesus christ
[55:27] there's only one thing that cleanses you
[55:29] from unrighteousness
[55:30] it's the blood of the lord jesus christ
[55:35] that's what does it that's what made the
[55:37] atonement
[55:38] and made and brought us to peace
[55:42] with god don't try to ever go before the
[55:44] throne of god
[55:45] amen with your own merits
[55:49] you know we don't bring anything but to
[55:53] the throne but
[55:54] jesus said his blood
[55:58] has given me the
[56:01] path to come before your throne
[56:05] and make my request known
[56:09] and how many types is there
[56:12] the type of esther and and how it was
[56:15] death to go
[56:16] before the king and but
[56:19] he went there and made great
[56:21] intercession
[56:22] and and so many things that we'd be
[56:25] daresome to uh even try to go before
[56:30] the lord on our with our own
[56:32] righteousness
[56:33] i think the story of daniel curry i
[56:36] believe it is who had the dream and
[56:38] and he can he got closer and closer
[56:43] to the light and he said the closer he
[56:45] got he said
[56:46] every little sin he did got bigger and
[56:49] bigger
[56:50] and bigger and pretty soon he was
[56:54] he was sitting there and he said all of
[56:55] a sudden every little lie he told
[56:58] every little scheme and deal he made
[57:01] everything that
[57:02] he he withheld you know every place he
[57:05] didn't have full disclosure
[57:07] you know every little thing like that
[57:10] just got brighter and bigger
[57:12] and bigger and when he finally stepped
[57:14] into that presence he said i'm lost
[57:17] he said i was only waiting for one thing
[57:20] you know but he started up there
[57:25] i'm daniel curry i've done this
[57:28] and i've done that and i've preached
[57:30] here and
[57:31] and boy he said he said every step he
[57:35] took the light got brighter
[57:38] and then he realized he was in trouble
[57:41] and he got there and there he was he was
[57:43] in trouble
[57:44] and all the gracious things he done he
[57:46] said the only thing
[57:48] that was on his heart and his mind was
[57:50] everything that he never done right
[57:52] and he was just waiting for the voice to
[57:55] say condemned
[57:57] you know in the chute to be pulled out
[58:00] from under his feet and
[58:01] him here screaming and says yeah and
[58:04] here's everybody the way
[58:06] he and he said all of a sudden he heard
[58:08] the sweetest
[58:09] voice he ever heard father he stood for
[58:13] me i'm here to stand for him
[58:15] i i paid the price for him
[58:18] enter into my rest and and so
[58:21] those were the the great things so
[58:25] so who is this melchizedek but god
[58:28] now we see here plainly
[58:32] the complete secret of our lives
[58:36] in journey so why are we seeing the
[58:40] secrets of our life in
[58:42] journey in this revelation
[58:45] of melchizedek because
[58:49] it it is god
[58:53] in stages
[58:56] can we read that statement earlier god
[58:59] in this
[59:00] stage in this
[59:03] form so he was when he came to
[59:06] uh abraham that was god
[59:09] in a stage of his plan
[59:13] okay he had a plan he had everything was
[59:16] gonna bomb everything was pre-planned
[59:18] we'll read that and so he he's in that
[59:20] stage
[59:21] and then from that stage he came to the
[59:24] stage
[59:25] of the lord jesus
[59:29] in that stage and so let's just
[59:32] do you have that yes this paragraph uh
[59:35] 112. he says now we see here plainly the
[59:39] complete secret of lies and journey
[59:42] and death and where we go
[59:45] after we die also
[59:48] predestination is in plain view here
[59:51] now listen as we teach this closely
[59:55] the stages of the eternal purpose
[1:00:01] the stages of his eternal purpose
[1:00:06] he had in his secret has
[1:00:10] now been revealed the stages of his
[1:00:14] eternal purpose has now been revealed
[1:00:17] notice there is three stages
[1:00:21] to perfection
[1:00:25] just like he redeems the world
[1:00:30] same way he redeems his church
[1:00:33] he redeems the people in three stages
[1:00:37] now look first is justification like
[1:00:40] luther
[1:00:40] preached second sanctification like
[1:00:42] wesley beast third baptism of the holy
[1:00:44] ghost that's right
[1:00:45] it comes then comes the rapture but now
[1:00:49] he's going to go on and i'm not going to
[1:00:50] go into all the reading of this
[1:00:53] but there was three stages
[1:00:57] to god's perfection and three
[1:01:00] stages of his eternal purpose
[1:01:05] and the first one was to abraham
[1:01:10] the purpose of redemption
[1:01:14] so he gave abraham the promise
[1:01:17] of the son so he appeared to abraham
[1:01:22] he took on a form so cable
[1:01:25] kim could look at that form look at that
[1:01:28] person
[1:01:29] and that's why we talked answered the
[1:01:32] question about the census
[1:01:33] so they looked at that and abraham saw a
[1:01:36] man there that knew all things
[1:01:39] knew why sarah laughed in the tent knew
[1:01:42] all this thing gave him a promise
[1:01:44] and all the hopes and he was in a form
[1:01:48] not a form like we come not a body that
[1:01:51] got old got sick died got wrinkled
[1:01:54] lost his hair can't eat steak anymore
[1:01:58] he's not he's not paying that he's not
[1:02:00] in that
[1:02:02] uh that's not the form he's in
[1:02:05] because why would abraham have to look
[1:02:07] forward to that abraham
[1:02:09] already couldn't have children
[1:02:12] he was already a hundred years old or 80
[1:02:15] and sarah
[1:02:16] and he gets a promise of a son now
[1:02:19] abraham by seeing that man
[1:02:21] and seeing that work and that sign
[1:02:25] believe that what that man promised
[1:02:28] was going to come to pass
[1:02:32] that this guy is able to perform that
[1:02:35] who he promised
[1:02:36] he recognized him by divine revelation
[1:02:40] that that was lord
[1:02:45] my lord that's what he saw
[1:02:48] and he received the word and
[1:02:51] he believed it that was god
[1:02:54] in the form of melchizedek we don't see
[1:02:58] god in that body form
[1:03:03] okay that first stage was
[1:03:06] the great eternal one okay the second
[1:03:10] stage
[1:03:11] was he became flesh
[1:03:14] so there was malchezadec again
[1:03:17] another word for melchizedek is the word
[1:03:22] in the beginning melchizedek it's just
[1:03:25] that the reason the question was there
[1:03:29] is because paul spoke of melchizedek and
[1:03:32] people wondered who was this melchizedek
[1:03:35] and they said oh it's the order of the
[1:03:37] ministry
[1:03:39] it's the order the order of melchizedek
[1:03:42] means
[1:03:42] the order of the priests before was they
[1:03:45] had to be born of a levite
[1:03:49] that was the order you didn't become a
[1:03:52] high priest
[1:03:53] unless you were born in the order or the
[1:03:56] fashion
[1:03:58] of the priesthood but this priesthood
[1:04:00] was born
[1:04:01] of the word of god he was the high
[1:04:04] priest he was the king
[1:04:06] of peace the king of salem the king of
[1:04:09] righteousness
[1:04:10] he was a high priest after the order of
[1:04:14] melchizedek and what order was
[1:04:17] melchizedek
[1:04:18] melchizedek came from the thoughts of
[1:04:20] god from the word of god
[1:04:22] from the mind of god he was the word of
[1:04:25] god
[1:04:26] he was god so what made melchizedek what
[1:04:30] he was
[1:04:31] was god expressing himself so our order
[1:04:34] of priesthood
[1:04:36] that's what we are we are priests sons
[1:04:38] and daughters and priests
[1:04:40] after the order of melchizedek because
[1:04:43] we came from the mind of god
[1:04:48] that's the order of melchizedek
[1:04:52] melchizedek wasn't made from anything
[1:04:56] he was god imorphy
[1:04:59] he was god changing forms
[1:05:02] god becoming a person
[1:05:06] now we know he took that form because
[1:05:10] when a
[1:05:11] when moses wanted to see him he passed
[1:05:14] by
[1:05:14] and he saw the back of a what a man
[1:05:19] that was god formed into a person
[1:05:22] when the prophet of god saw him he saw
[1:05:25] him he walked by he saw the back of
[1:05:27] a man and so
[1:05:30] queen know that it was god but it was
[1:05:34] god's
[1:05:34] stage you understand the stage
[1:05:38] the and not like a not like a platform
[1:05:43] stage
[1:05:44] but the the three manifestations
[1:05:47] the three processes the the three
[1:05:50] great uh you know what we call a staging
[1:05:54] area
[1:05:54] is you stop here and then you do that
[1:05:57] and then you move to the next thing
[1:05:59] so it was the first manifestation
[1:06:03] of the eternal purpose the first
[1:06:07] manifestation of the eternal purpose
[1:06:10] was god taking on form
[1:06:13] and talking to abraham
[1:06:18] because he had to start the plan of
[1:06:19] redemption
[1:06:21] the second stage of the eternal
[1:06:25] purpose so in melchizedek he gave the
[1:06:29] promise
[1:06:31] and anything that god speaks has to come
[1:06:34] to pass
[1:06:35] so the minute he spoke it to abraham it
[1:06:38] was on his way
[1:06:39] coming to pass first stage
[1:06:45] you know it's like in a trial the first
[1:06:47] stage is you've got to make a plea
[1:06:52] you know you say they can't try you
[1:06:55] until you admit whether you're guilty or
[1:06:57] not
[1:06:58] if you say you're guilty then that's
[1:06:59] obviously you're not going to be able to
[1:07:02] to prove that you're not guilty if you
[1:07:04] confess that you're guilty
[1:07:07] you know so i can't tell you all the
[1:07:10] stuff that goes behind the scenes you
[1:07:12] know a good attorney says it's gonna
[1:07:13] cost
[1:07:14] the county 150 thousand dollars to try
[1:07:17] this guy
[1:07:18] well will he accept five years instead
[1:07:21] of
[1:07:22] 20 you know save us some money and we
[1:07:24] get a conviction
[1:07:26] you know so the justice the cis system
[1:07:28] isn't as just as you think it is
[1:07:32] you know it's so corrupt
[1:07:36] that people that could prove their
[1:07:39] innocence
[1:07:41] would rather take a lesser consequences
[1:07:44] than take the chance
[1:07:46] and it's maybe sometimes it's the better
[1:07:49] valor
[1:07:50] and the wisdom of that
[1:07:53] now you've got this second stage
[1:07:57] because he left melchizedek
[1:08:00] and now he became jesus
[1:08:03] so he left a spiritual body
[1:08:08] and worked him way to flesh now he's in
[1:08:11] the form
[1:08:12] of flesh but not sinful flesh
[1:08:16] not flesh that was born
[1:08:19] by the act between a man and a woman
[1:08:24] so therefore there was still no sin
[1:08:27] in him right
[1:08:30] so now that's the second step and what's
[1:08:33] he do
[1:08:34] he pays the redemption price
[1:08:38] he wipes our slate clean and now he says
[1:08:41] if you believe in me the works that i do
[1:08:45] shall you do also
[1:08:49] so can now and he's saying if you go
[1:08:51] wait in
[1:08:52] and and carry i will fill you i will
[1:08:56] come again
[1:08:57] and i'll be with you even in you so that
[1:09:00] was the second
[1:09:01] stage the third stage
[1:09:05] was him appearing in the ministry of
[1:09:08] malachi 4
[1:09:10] 5 luke 17 30 and revelations 10
[1:09:14] 7. that was the last stage
[1:09:18] of his eternal purpose
[1:09:24] was to manifest right there he says
[1:09:27] notice there's still three stages of
[1:09:29] perfection
[1:09:31] so that was that was the three
[1:09:35] stages of perfection
[1:09:38] now and we're gonna jump ahead i don't
[1:09:42] know if you've got this but go to
[1:09:43] paragraph 142.
[1:09:45] so now he he he we're talking about this
[1:09:49] third stage
[1:09:50] of perfection you are you all with me
[1:09:55] okay i got a little nervous this morning
[1:09:57] because it was father's day and
[1:09:59] you know the deeper it got the more
[1:10:01] people are falling asleep and
[1:10:03] and you know and i get such a uh
[1:10:06] insecurity complex anyway
[1:10:09] you know what i mean but it ca
[1:10:12] anyway so you you
[1:10:16] you see what he promised the works that
[1:10:19] i shall
[1:10:20] you shall do also ask anything in my
[1:10:23] father's name
[1:10:24] now watch this statement here
[1:10:27] okay now the bible said that
[1:10:30] jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:10:34] and forever right
[1:10:37] jesus said the works that i do
[1:10:42] shall he that believeth on me
[1:10:45] do also that's right notice
[1:10:49] that was the real melchizedek
[1:10:56] now
[1:11:01] how beautiful is that
[1:11:05] okay i mean it can it get any more
[1:11:08] uh beautiful and that that's the real
[1:11:11] malkiesa deck now this is the final
[1:11:14] stage
[1:11:15] of my perfection this is the final stage
[1:11:19] of my purpose
[1:11:20] god above us giving the promise god with
[1:11:24] us
[1:11:24] fulfilling the promise god putting him
[1:11:28] that fulfilled promise in his
[1:11:31] predestinated election
[1:11:35] now don't ever let satan beat you down
[1:11:38] if
[1:11:39] if you've been battling something and
[1:11:40] trying to overcome i don't care if it's
[1:11:42] years
[1:11:43] it he showed in abraham that it took
[1:11:46] years and years for that promise to be
[1:11:48] fulfilled
[1:11:49] but he still built cribs he still can
[1:11:53] added on a nursery at his house they
[1:11:56] thought that man was a loon
[1:12:01] i've been up on the lakes of canada and
[1:12:03] you hear the looney birds
[1:12:05] you know squawking all night long you
[1:12:07] wonder what's wrong with those crazy
[1:12:09] birds
[1:12:11] call them loons looney birds
[1:12:14] what do you think they thought of
[1:12:15] abraham i'm gonna have a son
[1:12:18] why by promise
[1:12:22] you know what we what we should be
[1:12:25] saying
[1:12:26] i'm going in a rapture why
[1:12:29] by promise the same one that told
[1:12:33] abraham that he was going to have a son
[1:12:36] and that son
[1:12:37] showed up the same one that said i'm
[1:12:39] coming again that you may be where i am
[1:12:41] also
[1:12:42] that's the same one and that's here's
[1:12:44] peter
[1:12:45] the same one you guys crucified
[1:12:51] the cornerstone that you rejected
[1:12:54] is the one that did this work it's by
[1:12:58] his name
[1:12:59] that this has happened it's the one that
[1:13:01] was there
[1:13:02] that you saw preaching and going around
[1:13:05] and doing good works
[1:13:06] and telling them about a kingdom that
[1:13:08] was to come
[1:13:09] you rejected that but that is now the
[1:13:13] cornerstone
[1:13:14] of what the church is built on gets the
[1:13:18] church restored back
[1:13:20] because it went into the ground right he

[1:14:41] moments here um
[1:14:44] to the message things that
[1:14:49] are to be and
[1:14:52] brother branham reads this text out of
[1:14:54] john 1 and 4
[1:14:56] we we read some of that text so let's
[1:14:59] just turn in our bibles
[1:15:01] real quick over to john
[1:15:22] hmm

[1:15:32] now i read i believe from the seventh
[1:15:35] first down
[1:15:36] brother bram is here is reading through
[1:15:38] the seventh verse
[1:15:40] let not your hearts be troubled
[1:15:43] ye believe in god believe
[1:15:46] also in me in my father's house
[1:15:51] are many mansions if it
[1:15:54] were not so i would have
[1:15:57] told you i go to prepare
[1:16:00] a place for you and if i go
[1:16:03] to prepare a place for you i will come
[1:16:07] again
[1:16:08] and receive you unto myself
[1:16:11] that where i am there ye may be
[1:16:15] also whither i go ye know
[1:16:19] and the way you know thomas said unto
[1:16:22] him lord
[1:16:24] know not whether thou goest and how can
[1:16:28] we know the way jesus said unto him
[1:16:31] i am the way the truth
[1:16:35] and the life no man cometh unto the
[1:16:38] father
[1:16:39] but by me
[1:16:44] if ye had known me ye would have known
[1:16:48] my father also and from
[1:16:51] henceforth you know him and
[1:16:55] have seen him oh my
[1:17:00] what an explanation
[1:17:06] so melchizedek brother branham
[1:17:10] just took the time to explain
[1:17:13] that malkizadak was the form that god
[1:17:16] took
[1:17:17] to deliver to abraham his
[1:17:20] redemptive eternal purpose jesus came
[1:17:24] to fill that purpose and the malachi
[1:17:27] came in this age to restore back that
[1:17:30] purpose
[1:17:32] to us now
[1:17:36] he said
[1:17:41] okay and so brother brown makes the
[1:17:44] statement here we are tonight
[1:17:45] trying to put forth our effort to try to
[1:17:48] cause men to see
[1:17:50] the great things that god has done
[1:17:53] and you know there's something greater
[1:17:56] just beyond
[1:17:57] many would look tonight
[1:18:01] and look tonight father as we turn
[1:18:05] in your word and read we can read it
[1:18:08] father but let the holy spirit reveal to
[1:18:11] us
[1:18:11] through the revelation we ask it in
[1:18:14] jesus name
[1:18:15] so he he reads this text and he goes
[1:18:19] over here and he says
[1:18:21] now saying this was a funeral text
[1:18:25] you see you know many people said he
[1:18:26] said when you see my life
[1:18:28] ending now jesus speaking
[1:18:31] when you see my life ending it's
[1:18:34] ending for a purpose
[1:18:38] i'm going away to prepare
[1:18:42] a place for you that where i
[1:18:46] am there you may be also
[1:18:49] jesus therefore is telling his disciples
[1:18:53] that this life is not
[1:18:57] ended in death
[1:19:01] okay so a lot of people would think it's
[1:19:04] a funeral text but now
[1:19:06] he is telling them that after death
[1:19:09] there is life
[1:19:10] because i go to prepare a place for you
[1:19:13] that is to receive them shows
[1:19:17] that there that he was speaking to them
[1:19:22] that there was a life
[1:19:25] after this life has ended now what a
[1:19:28] consolation that ought to give
[1:19:30] to all of us to know that after this
[1:19:34] life is over
[1:19:35] there is a life we go into
[1:19:39] and as you get older and become
[1:19:42] more of a reality to you as you begin to
[1:19:46] see the days of your life drawing
[1:19:48] close then it begins to to you to be
[1:19:51] to to pack up closer and get ready for
[1:19:55] that a great event
[1:19:56] it's now it's a continuation of the same
[1:20:00] life in another world place
[1:20:05] a change so
[1:20:08] what why did he come back
[1:20:12] in his eternal purpose was to make
[1:20:16] real to us the reality of the change
[1:20:20] and what we needed to do to get ready
[1:20:23] for it
[1:20:25] it's a beautiful thing if we know the
[1:20:28] word of god
[1:20:30] we know where we're living we know the
[1:20:32] hour
[1:20:33] that we're living in and we know what
[1:20:36] lays ahead
[1:20:37] we see what we've passed and the book of
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:41] is the revelation of jesus christ his
[1:20:45] works through the ages that was
[1:20:48] up to the book of revelation and then he
[1:20:52] promised that it is to come
[1:20:55] so all of his promises are true
[1:20:59] god cannot speak any word without it
[1:21:02] being confirmed
[1:21:03] every word that he says has to come to
[1:21:07] pass
[1:21:07] before the foundation of
[1:21:11] the world oh my goodness
[1:21:14] when i begin to think of it so how did
[1:21:16] god
[1:21:17] always deliver his word
[1:21:20] his word came through a what through a
[1:21:23] prophet
[1:21:24] he say well what about jesus jesus was
[1:21:27] on this earth in the ministry of a
[1:21:30] prophet
[1:21:31] i will raise up a prophet unto you liken
[1:21:34] unto moses
[1:21:36] that's what he was he was called rabbi
[1:21:39] young
[1:21:39] prophet came in he ministered oh
[1:21:42] son of man that meant profit so jesus
[1:21:45] didn't come down
[1:21:47] and and manifest himself as the son of
[1:21:50] god
[1:21:51] he did tell one lady though which
[1:21:54] represented a redeemed bride
[1:21:57] you're speaking to him you know
[1:22:00] thou art the son of god she said
[1:22:03] philip thou art the son of god when he
[1:22:06] was revealed
[1:22:07] in that form they recognized that that
[1:22:11] was
[1:22:11] god he says now
[1:22:15] so we we understand now so now here's
[1:22:18] the messenger telling us
[1:22:21] of the things that are to be
[1:22:24] so the messenger shows up the eternal
[1:22:27] purpose
[1:22:28] and he calls out the bride that's
[1:22:31] supposed to go into the rapture
[1:22:34] now he's telling her things that are to
[1:22:37] be
[1:22:38] what's transpo transpiring
[1:22:41] what god's doing how the first stage has
[1:22:43] come
[1:22:44] how the second stage come and is telling
[1:22:46] them you're in the third stage
[1:22:49] in other words you're close it's launch
[1:22:52] time
[1:22:53] ten nine you know they roll that big
[1:22:56] missile out
[1:22:57] and they get there and and it's all
[1:23:00] ready to go and
[1:23:02] and now comes the countdown did he tell
[1:23:06] us we're at the countdown
[1:23:08] it's harvest time you know it's the
[1:23:11] third
[1:23:11] exodus so what is this great ministry
[1:23:14] uh telling us he's here doing the same
[1:23:17] signs and wonders
[1:23:18] but he's also telling us things that are
[1:23:21] to be
[1:23:22] because he told abraham things that are
[1:23:25] to be
[1:23:25] that he was going to have a son and
[1:23:27] abraham believed him
[1:23:30] and it was counted to him for
[1:23:31] righteousness that what god promised is
[1:23:34] going to come to pass
[1:23:35] let me ask you do you believe there's a
[1:23:38] rapture do you believe what god says
[1:23:39] coming to pass
[1:23:40] that's what's counted to you for your
[1:23:42] righteousness
[1:23:44] because you believe what god spoke
[1:23:47] through his prophets
[1:23:48] is going to come to pass
[1:23:53] hallelujah we get hung up on our own
[1:23:57] righteousness
[1:24:01] as long as you've got this flash you're
[1:24:02] going to war against the spirit
[1:24:04] they're contrary to the one that's that
[1:24:06] first husband that's that
[1:24:08] that thing that's got to die is all the
[1:24:11] nagging
[1:24:14] torture that comes from a fleshly body
[1:24:18] borne in sin
[1:24:20] sorry about that person
[1:24:24] but anyway it's just it's a tough thing
[1:24:26] so now god
[1:24:27] everything god promises god to come to
[1:24:29] pass
[1:24:30] so now here's melchizedek back again
[1:24:35] the word coming to the prophet doing the
[1:24:38] signs that identified him
[1:24:40] first sign that identified and what he
[1:24:44] called sarah out behind the back
[1:24:48] right the second sign that identified
[1:24:51] him
[1:24:51] the dead were raised the blind
[1:24:55] received their sight the death heard
[1:25:00] and now he comes back and identifies
[1:25:03] himself again
[1:25:06] every time he gave a promise
[1:25:09] first exodus second exodus
[1:25:13] third exodus three stages
[1:25:16] three stages of mel piece of that
[1:25:20] i will come again and receive you
[1:25:23] that where i am you may also be and
[1:25:27] then he says this is melchizedek the
[1:25:30] works that i do
[1:25:31] you shall do also okay i wonder when our
[1:25:35] faith
[1:25:36] is going to come to the place that we
[1:25:38] believe the promises
[1:25:40] of god we believe that there's no
[1:25:42] nothing in this life that we have to
[1:25:44] preserve
[1:25:45] that the life that is there waiting for
[1:25:48] us
[1:25:49] is just a continuation of this
[1:25:52] life but corruption
[1:25:55] won't inherit the kingdom of god only
[1:25:58] in corruption that's why he's telling
[1:26:01] you you've got a body that'll carry
[1:26:04] you over into the other life
[1:26:09] don't worry about this body because he's
[1:26:11] going to give you one that's been
[1:26:13] prepared
[1:26:14] for you
[1:26:17] to carry you over oh
[1:26:22] it gets me feeling better
[1:26:26] i don't care i might come up here if a
[1:26:28] crane on a cane if you let me
[1:26:30] but when i start preaching like this i'm
[1:26:32] going to click my heel
[1:26:36] he says he said
[1:26:40] now over in the book of hebrews i
[1:26:42] believe about the seventh chapter
[1:26:44] paul here is writing i believe it was
[1:26:47] and was speaking on the great events
[1:26:49] that taken place with abraham
[1:26:51] and he paid tithes to melchizedek
[1:26:54] when he was returning from the slaughter
[1:26:57] of the kings
[1:26:58] that's things that are to be paragraph
[1:27:00] 30.
[1:27:02] when he was returning from the slaughter
[1:27:04] of the kings now he said that levi was
[1:27:07] in the loins of abraham
[1:27:09] when he meant melchizedek coming from
[1:27:11] the slaughter of the kings
[1:27:13] and then he reckoned to it
[1:27:16] levi paid tithes also when he was in the
[1:27:20] loins of abraham
[1:27:21] in his great great grandfather and he
[1:27:24] visits the sins of the people upon their
[1:27:28] children from generation to generation
[1:27:31] that won't keep his word you were
[1:27:34] all pre-planned by god nothing
[1:27:38] happens by chance with god he knows all
[1:27:41] about it
[1:27:42] it's all pre-planned for
[1:27:45] many generations back so that you could
[1:27:48] be here tonight
[1:27:50] did you know that
[1:27:53] my he said
[1:27:58] over here in paragraph
[1:28:01] 36 it says you see the whole
[1:28:04] program the whole church is built upon
[1:28:08] divine revelation
[1:28:10] jesus said in saint matthew the 16th
[1:28:12] chapter
[1:28:13] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[1:28:15] to you but my father which is in heaven
[1:28:17] has revealed to you
[1:28:19] what was it a revelation of
[1:28:22] who he was upon this rock i'll build my
[1:28:26] church
[1:28:27] and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:28:30] against it
[1:28:31] the revelation of jesus christ in this
[1:28:34] hour
[1:28:35] not what he was in another hour
[1:28:38] what he was now the bible
[1:28:42] expresses it's growing into
[1:28:46] the bride to a full statue
[1:28:50] therefore if the corn of wheat christ
[1:28:52] had not fallen in the ground
[1:28:55] so did the bride have to fall in the
[1:28:57] ground
[1:28:58] through the dark ages any grain that
[1:29:01] goes into the ground must die
[1:29:03] or it can't produce itself reproduce
[1:29:07] itself
[1:29:07] and the great church that was
[1:29:11] established on the day of pentecost
[1:29:13] by the sending of the holy ghost had to
[1:29:16] suffer mortardom
[1:29:19] and go into the dirt unto the earth
[1:29:22] in the dark ages to bring forth the age
[1:29:25] of luther
[1:29:26] and coming on out to the full stature
[1:29:29] of the bride of jesus christ in this
[1:29:32] last day
[1:29:34] there's no way there's no other way
[1:29:38] so we
[1:29:41] see it why do you think you're here
[1:29:45] why did you respond to the eagle cry
[1:29:50] what was it that let all of us from
[1:29:52] different walks of life
[1:29:54] different cultures different economic
[1:29:56] and educational backgrounds
[1:29:58] can everything come together as a people
[1:30:02] with no big eyes no little use
[1:30:05] nobody ragging on one another or talking
[1:30:08] about one another
[1:30:09] realizing we all have equal chance
[1:30:13] there's no disparity in christ
[1:30:18] because i believe where there's any
[1:30:20] there's plenty
[1:30:24] i'm not going to let any of you if i
[1:30:27] have the ability to go hungry if i know
[1:30:29] it
[1:30:33] i just won't do it i'll respond if i
[1:30:37] know
[1:30:38] i don't know all things but if the lord
[1:30:41] put it on my heart or something
[1:30:44] but if someone come and told me brother
[1:30:46] says sister
[1:30:47] and such don't have groceries well i'm
[1:30:50] not gonna let that happen
[1:30:53] now if i got ten dollars i'll buy ten
[1:30:55] dollars worth of groceries
[1:30:58] because we're family
[1:31:03] we're the children birthed by the word
[1:31:06] of god
[1:31:08] that's why we pray and we pray one for
[1:31:11] another
[1:31:11] that's why if one of us suffers we all
[1:31:14] suffer together
[1:31:16] it's it's the great thing in into the
[1:31:19] full statute
[1:31:20] so the corner wheat goes ground he sends
[1:31:24] the holy ghost
[1:31:25] had to suffer and go through the dirt of
[1:31:28] the earth in the dark ages
[1:31:29] to bring forth again luther and out into
[1:31:32] the full statue of the bride
[1:31:34] of christ for the last day there's no
[1:31:37] way
[1:31:37] therefore the bride in the rapture will
[1:31:40] come forth
[1:31:42] and it is all pre-planned by god
[1:31:45] all backed up from the beginning he
[1:31:48] knowed every man
[1:31:49] every place who would set all about it
[1:31:53] it's all pre-planned god knew
[1:31:56] it would be here and he
[1:32:00] and he and he
[1:32:03] made it that way so that when we get
[1:32:07] there
[1:32:07] he's going to prepare a place for us and
[1:32:10] when we get there
[1:32:12] it's all prepared just like even this
[1:32:15] night is prepared
[1:32:16] this hour's prepared his great
[1:32:20] foreknowledge
[1:32:21] tells him all those things by
[1:32:23] foreknowledge
[1:32:24] he's omnipresent because he's omnipotent
[1:32:28] omnipotent because he's omnipresent
[1:32:31] therefore
[1:32:32] by his foreign knowledge now he can't be
[1:32:35] just like the wind over the earth
[1:32:37] because he's a being
[1:32:40] right he's just isn't a myth
[1:32:43] he's a being he dwells he even dwells in
[1:32:45] a house
[1:32:46] he dwells in a place called heaven and
[1:32:48] therefore he's omnipotent all present
[1:32:52] omnipotent knowing all things then he's
[1:32:55] omnipresent because he knows all things
[1:32:58] you now grew from your birth
[1:33:02] when you were born present
[1:33:05] into this world god knew that you were
[1:33:08] going to be here
[1:33:09] on this earth and you'd grow from birth
[1:33:12] to maturity
[1:33:14] things that seemed to too strange to you
[1:33:19] in your youth womanhood young boys as
[1:33:22] children now seem very real
[1:33:25] you couldn't understand it when you was
[1:33:28] a child
[1:33:29] but now you become an adult
[1:33:32] you begin to understand and find
[1:33:36] out that everything is just
[1:33:39] set just right and
[1:33:42] you it really means something to you now
[1:33:46] so it is in your spiritual birth
[1:33:50] you do things that you don't understand
[1:33:53] when you're a little babe come to the
[1:33:57] altar
[1:33:58] you give your life to christ you do such
[1:34:01] strange things you wonder why
[1:34:04] you why you did it but after a while
[1:34:08] when you mature as a mature christian
[1:34:11] then you understand it see there's
[1:34:14] something
[1:34:14] picking up you see why you had to do it
[1:34:18] your spiritual birth your natural birth
[1:34:21] types your spiritual birth
[1:34:23] how it fitted you
[1:34:27] in this life as you grew everything
[1:34:30] fitted right in because you were made
[1:34:33] for that wasn't it strange thing
[1:34:36] the night that you staggered into the
[1:34:38] mission the tent
[1:34:40] or the little church somewhere on the
[1:34:42] corner
[1:34:43] and some preacher preached on a certain
[1:34:46] subject
[1:34:47] and you just fell right at the altar
[1:34:52] isn't that strange see god knew that
[1:34:56] before the foundation of the world it
[1:34:59] seems strange to you
[1:35:01] why you did it then but now you
[1:35:04] understand
[1:35:05] you know what happened so
[1:35:08] you didn't understand it when you were
[1:35:10] brought under conviction
[1:35:12] but now you've grown up you mature
[1:35:14] you're not talking about
[1:35:16] going from sin to from drinking to not
[1:35:19] drinking
[1:35:21] now you're talking about going to being
[1:35:23] a real true son of
[1:35:25] god you're talking about not
[1:35:28] not just living a right life but a
[1:35:31] transformation of your body
[1:35:33] into another kingdom because we see the
[1:35:36] fulfillment of the word
[1:35:38] and we realize the hours at hand look at
[1:35:40] what your conversation
[1:35:42] is look at what you matured when as a
[1:35:44] child i did childless things i spoke of
[1:35:46] a child
[1:35:47] but now that i'm strong and i'm adult i
[1:35:50] speak of adult
[1:35:51] spiritual things so it's time
[1:35:55] that the church starts talking speaking
[1:35:58] and thinking
[1:36:00] in the supernatural because the greatest
[1:36:02] supernatural event
[1:36:04] that's ever going to happen is right at
[1:36:07] our doorstep
[1:36:08] the transformation of your body into
[1:36:11] your theophany body
[1:36:12] to go meet him in the air
[1:36:26] you didn't understand you knew what
[1:36:28] happened
[1:36:29] it's so fitting this life
[1:36:32] and we'll also in the life that that is
[1:36:35] to come
[1:36:36] this world and its life seems
[1:36:39] too advanced as you mature
[1:36:43] everything seems to go right with you
[1:36:46] so as you grow everything grows
[1:36:50] i see my grandson running around with
[1:36:55] his mommy's cell phone well i don't know
[1:36:57] if he knows how to use it
[1:37:00] but my granddaughters do
[1:37:05] because they've got as they grew things
[1:37:08] went along with them
[1:37:09] you didn't know how to drive as you grew
[1:37:11] you started driving everything came with
[1:37:13] you
[1:37:14] as you matured up everything's been
[1:37:17] coming with you all the time
[1:37:22] all these promises have been coming with
[1:37:24] you
[1:37:26] i don't believe that a person just
[1:37:29] happened
[1:37:30] to be here by chance now just think
[1:37:35] when you come to the world
[1:37:38] everything had to be for
[1:37:42] for prepared for you or prepared
[1:37:46] for you rather for you i don't
[1:37:49] hardly understand how that we could
[1:37:52] think
[1:37:53] that a god could prepare all those good
[1:37:56] things for us
[1:37:58] would not and we could not put trust in
[1:38:02] him
[1:38:03] that if he brought us in this chaos
[1:38:06] that we're in now and prepared the good
[1:38:09] things
[1:38:10] of life for us here how much more
[1:38:13] we trust him to prepare the things that
[1:38:16] is to come
[1:38:18] see the eternal things it seems very
[1:38:21] strange to me
[1:38:22] and and i'm just going to
[1:38:27] if i could say just
[1:38:30] stop there because
[1:38:36] this message isn't just about
[1:38:40] looking back on the ministry of brother
[1:38:43] branham
[1:38:44] and seeing what it was
[1:38:48] okay it's seeing what
[1:38:52] he was doing he was preparing
[1:38:55] a people for a rapture
[1:39:00] and he was telling them the timetable of
[1:39:04] it
[1:39:05] what you needed to get
[1:39:08] to what level of faith you would have to
[1:39:11] have
[1:39:12] because the rapturing with faith was
[1:39:14] revealed
[1:39:15] in the opening of the seals
[1:39:18] we talk a lot about taking our position
[1:39:21] in christ and and coming to the things
[1:39:25] so many times we always relate that to
[1:39:28] works
[1:39:30] but accepting your position is accepting
[1:39:33] the promise
[1:39:35] that he gave to you i will come again
[1:39:40] i'll be with you i will not leave you
[1:39:44] i prepared everything the footsteps of
[1:39:47] the righteous
[1:39:48] are ordered by the lord the time of your
[1:39:50] conversions
[1:39:51] ordered by the lord
[1:39:56] i mean i mean
[1:39:59] my kids got saved now that's a big
[1:40:03] miracle
[1:40:07] you know a lot of people come to me and
[1:40:11] said you need to quit preaching
[1:40:14] your kids are not doing this and not
[1:40:16] doing that though wait a minute that's
[1:40:17] not the promise i got
[1:40:22] he said to me if i preach the gospel
[1:40:24] that my house would be saved
[1:40:26] if i applied the token my
[1:40:29] house would be saved i i didn't hear
[1:40:33] that thing i heard the promise
[1:40:36] and if you hear the promise and you
[1:40:38] believe the promise you look for it
[1:40:40] and the last things john says it says
[1:40:43] even so come quickly lord jesus
[1:40:45] he says look up your redemption draws
[1:40:48] nigh
[1:40:50] so there is such a transformation
[1:40:55] that is now taking place in the church
[1:41:00] and we're driven there you understand by
[1:41:04] the shock pulling away
[1:41:06] and rejecting you and this rejection is
[1:41:10] going to get worse
[1:41:11] they're going to reject your stand on
[1:41:13] morality they're going to reject your
[1:41:15] stand on education
[1:41:17] they're they're going to make that their
[1:41:19] teaching should smile
[1:41:21] things in school that you can hardly
[1:41:24] uh uh feel like you can send your
[1:41:27] children there
[1:41:30] it's going to get ugly because they
[1:41:33] rejected
[1:41:34] anything that has to do with god they're
[1:41:37] trying to create
[1:41:39] a godless world and the prophet of god
[1:41:42] promised us that in the last day this
[1:41:45] world would go
[1:41:46] into total apostasy
[1:41:51] that means you're going to try to live
[1:41:53] life outside
[1:41:55] the laws of god
[1:42:00] i mean it's not even logical
[1:42:05] defund the police okay
[1:42:08] i'm a criminal that's like the
[1:42:11] millennium for me
[1:42:18] they don't let you they don't let you
[1:42:21] they don't arrest you they don't put you
[1:42:22] in jail
[1:42:24] no bail well i'm a liar
[1:42:28] i'm a thief i'm having the time my life
[1:42:31] i just go tell the judge
[1:42:33] promise him oh i'll come
[1:42:36] okay i trust you
[1:42:39] the judge is up there where's my wallet
[1:42:45] i didn't even see that pickpocket well
[1:42:48] don't arrest them why do you think
[1:42:51] crime's so crazy
[1:42:54] why do you think the murder rate's just
[1:42:56] gone up
[1:42:58] all of a sudden
[1:43:05] it becomes completely
[1:43:08] uh worthless
[1:43:12] but remember there is a consequence
[1:43:16] for not accepting the gospel
[1:43:20] there is a consequence even if you're a
[1:43:23] teenager
[1:43:24] and all you view this thing here is
[1:43:26] mommy and daddy's religion and this is
[1:43:28] where we go to church
[1:43:30] and we're just like any other teenager
[1:43:32] that's in any other
[1:43:34] church you still know right and wrong
[1:43:40] and and if you make the wrong decisions
[1:43:43] you will reap what you sow
[1:43:47] i'm not talking about salvation and all
[1:43:50] that
[1:43:51] i mean i'd hate to have to be run over
[1:43:53] by five
[1:43:54] trucks to get across the street
[1:43:58] and crawl up on the other side all
[1:44:00] wounded and run over tire tracks all
[1:44:02] over me
[1:44:03] said i made it and then i started
[1:44:06] singing the song made it
[1:44:08] you know just two buses and three semis
[1:44:12] later
[1:44:14] when god provided a crosswalk
[1:44:18] he provided a spirit to lead you across
[1:44:21] to the other side
[1:44:22] oh you will get there
[1:44:25] you know but he told paul it's hard to
[1:44:28] kick against the prick ball
[1:44:30] you've taken a tough way to try to
[1:44:32] eliminate my
[1:44:33] influence on this earth
[1:44:38] in fact basically you think who you are
[1:44:41] okay i'll smite you blind
[1:44:44] i'll send a prophet to pray for you i'll
[1:44:47] put you on the desert
[1:44:48] for 12 years or so until you really
[1:44:51] figure out
[1:44:52] what's going on here then paul comes
[1:44:55] back i'm the chiefest of all sinners
[1:44:58] but let me tell you he's real
[1:45:02] and not only that i'm going to go to the
[1:45:03] gentiles
[1:45:05] and i'm going to tell him the deep
[1:45:06] riches of christ shows up on mars hill
[1:45:09] he says oh i see you've got an altar to
[1:45:11] the unknown god
[1:45:12] he didn't walk up there you bunch of
[1:45:13] pagans he said oh
[1:45:16] you men you know you're very curious you
[1:45:20] greek seek after
[1:45:21] wisdom he says i noticed you great smart
[1:45:24] men you've got an altar over here to the
[1:45:26] unknown god
[1:45:28] i want to talk talk to you about this
[1:45:29] unknown god
[1:45:31] i want to reveal to you who he is and
[1:45:33] what he does and what kind of power he
[1:45:35] has
[1:45:37] what are we what are we showing to the
[1:45:39] world
[1:45:42] the light that we have
[1:45:45] what that he's what that he's placed us
[1:45:48] to be
[1:45:49] and and and and what is it that
[1:45:52] that were that were showing forth
[1:45:55] if we know the word we know where we're
[1:45:57] at we know the life that we're living
[1:46:00] so what that word testifying to
[1:46:04] is that the things that have been
[1:46:06] prophesied
[1:46:07] are actually coming to pass
[1:46:12] that's what we'd be uh able to should
[1:46:14] have eyes at
[1:46:16] for the things that are to be the things
[1:46:20] that our messenger spoke
[1:46:21] are now happening so
[1:46:26] he told us we're at the end time we're
[1:46:29] at the end time
[1:46:31] well that's just the voice
[1:46:34] you know and at the end time's coming
[1:46:38] in fact we already say that
[1:46:41] from even this virus life has changed as
[1:46:45] we've
[1:46:46] as we know it
[1:46:50] it's just changed things that we never
[1:46:53] thought
[1:46:54] were happening limit limits on
[1:46:57] activities
[1:46:59] people have changed businesses has
[1:47:02] closed down
[1:47:02] people are ordering things online people
[1:47:05] are
[1:47:06] going with houses they they say that
[1:47:10] it's going to take years for things to
[1:47:13] return back
[1:47:14] to normal i don't want normal
[1:47:19] i want to leave i want to go home
[1:47:25] okay and he's here trying to put in us
[1:47:29] the faith
[1:47:33] so we start looking for it
[1:47:37] we start believing it that this is our
[1:47:41] promise
[1:47:42] and this is what we live by we make our
[1:47:45] choices
[1:47:46] and our decisions in our life based on
[1:47:49] what
[1:47:50] is absolutely the best
[1:47:53] for me to make the resurrection
[1:47:59] i don't want i don't want well if i'm
[1:48:01] going
[1:48:02] then i can be anywhere
[1:48:06] no i think if my life's planned
[1:48:10] i want to get in that plan and if you
[1:48:13] get out of that plan
[1:48:14] what does he do he takes your life
[1:48:18] and he works it around to get you back
[1:48:21] where he wants you
[1:48:23] he takes the permissive will of god and
[1:48:26] works it back
[1:48:27] to the perfect will of god but let me
[1:48:30] tell you what he added to that
[1:48:32] you'll save yourself and god
[1:48:36] a lot of trouble and believe me
[1:48:40] your troubles greater than god's trouble
[1:48:49] so you know i i i'm just saying
[1:48:53] it's marvelous but just back to our
[1:48:56] little question good question
[1:48:59] why because god chose that name
[1:49:04] he chose that place to put his name
[1:49:07] ken brother brown preaches that and
[1:49:09] god's provided place of worship
[1:49:11] and there's several other places that
[1:49:14] he teaches us and i hope that you caught
[1:49:17] this this morning when we read out of
[1:49:19] corinthians those people have the same
[1:49:22] questions
[1:49:23] back then that we have now what kind of
[1:49:26] body
[1:49:26] how's he gonna come how's he gonna
[1:49:28] appear aren't you glad the seals are
[1:49:31] open
[1:49:32] aren't you glad that we had somebody
[1:49:35] that was
[1:49:36] a prepared created vessel did you know
[1:49:39] that the
[1:49:41] billy graham said that that messenger
[1:49:43] that he's created with just the
[1:49:45] personality just the way he speaks his
[1:49:49] words
[1:49:50] just his nature the way he brings things
[1:49:53] out
[1:49:54] the way he says it is all designed
[1:49:57] for the sheep that will hear them
[1:50:01] it's wonderful so i want to encourage
[1:50:04] you to
[1:50:05] think supernaturally don't let the devil
[1:50:08] beat you down
[1:50:09] with a body you're not going to have
[1:50:11] anyway
[1:50:14] you know if he wants the thing he can
[1:50:16] have it
[1:50:18] it's just going to turn into dust
[1:50:23] you say how come jesus didn't see
[1:50:25] corruption because he was the word
[1:50:27] before he was flesh
[1:50:31] why does your body see corruption
[1:50:33] because you were flesh
[1:50:35] before you're the word and paul
[1:50:37] addressed that
[1:50:38] why didn't the natural spiritual come
[1:50:41] first
[1:50:42] but we understand all that now don't we
[1:50:45] because of the attributes but anyway
[1:50:46] i hope you enjoy the word of god
[1:50:49] i don't know where we're going to go
[1:50:52] this
[1:50:52] message things that are beat to be is
[1:50:55] wonderful
[1:50:56] but i think the next message in our
[1:50:59] series
[1:51:00] from where we picked up i think is
[1:51:02] easter seal isn't that correct
[1:51:04] so yeah and that's a
[1:51:08] longer study than who is this
[1:51:09] melchizedek
[1:51:11] the seal of the resurrection
[1:51:14] in us oh my mom
[1:51:20] wouldn't you love to have the absolute
[1:51:22] absolute confidence
[1:51:24] that nothing can pluck you out of the
[1:51:26] palm of his hand
[1:51:29] that your name's written on the land
[1:51:30] book of life before the foundation war
[1:51:32] and nothing can take it off
[1:51:35] if there's not a place i would have told
[1:51:37] you i go to prepare a place
[1:51:40] you know how you have that confidence
[1:51:42] believe his word
[1:51:44] believe his word if you lack faith ask
[1:51:47] him for faith
[1:51:49] lord help my unbelief make it real to me
[1:51:53] make me understand it make me grow in
[1:51:56] you
[1:51:57] father i want it to be real i want you
[1:51:59] to be real in my life
[1:52:01] i want to have a personal relationship i
[1:52:03] want to
[1:52:04] feel that presence i want to feel you
[1:52:07] close
[1:52:07] i want to sense your holy spirit when
[1:52:10] it's leading me i want to get into
[1:52:12] relationship with you
[1:52:13] i'm tired of always fighting the flesh i
[1:52:16] want to step up a little higher
[1:52:18] i want to mature a little more and i
[1:52:20] want to start
[1:52:21] thinking supernaturally
[1:52:24] and i want to start displaying
[1:52:27] and showing the life i i had a wonderful
[1:52:30] quote about that
[1:52:31] in things that are to be but for some
[1:52:34] reason
[1:52:35] my ability to mark things has really
[1:52:39] left me but it's just such a wonderful
[1:52:41] thing about
[1:52:42] our life and the light that we're
[1:52:44] showing
[1:52:45] and what we're shining forth to this
[1:52:48] world
[1:52:49] our life is shining forth this world
[1:52:53] the soon resurrection
[1:52:57] of the church you are very very very
[1:53:00] very very
[1:53:01] very important you may be the difference
[1:53:05] in somebody's life you may be the one
[1:53:09] that finds the last
[1:53:10] seed i think i was telling the church in
[1:53:15] missouri
[1:53:16] it's like the person that they're
[1:53:18] building a puzzle
[1:53:20] you know this happens happened a lot in
[1:53:22] my family
[1:53:23] well one of them would take the puzzle
[1:53:25] piece
[1:53:27] and put it in their pocket so they could
[1:53:30] be the last one to finish the puzzle
[1:53:33] the only trouble was is we had five
[1:53:35] siblings
[1:53:36] so the puzzle would get all done and
[1:53:38] there'd be five pieces missing
[1:53:43] and everybody would get up and walk away
[1:53:45] trying to wait out
[1:53:47] who's gonna put the puzzle in
[1:53:50] first you know and you know
[1:53:53] so anyway all the pieces are coming
[1:53:57] together
[1:53:58] so you might be the piece of the puzzle
[1:54:01] in somebody's else life so let's not be
[1:54:03] ashamed of this gospel
[1:54:06] and and this was
[1:54:09] this coming of melchizedek
[1:54:13] in our day was the third stage
[1:54:17] of the eternal purpose
[1:54:20] of god so if we've got anything tonight
[1:54:23] i
[1:54:23] hope that's there so god bless you pray
[1:54:26] for us this week
[1:54:27] pray that god will do exceedingly and
[1:54:29] abundantly above what we can ask
[1:54:31] or think pray for our plan if it's
[1:54:35] possible
[1:54:36] that the lord would make a way for us in
[1:54:39] this
[1:54:40] hour that the city of bedford can build
[1:54:43] three liquor stores but it takes them
[1:54:45] two years to approve
[1:54:46] our church i guess we don't give them
[1:54:48] enough money
[1:54:50] but i think we can try to explain to
[1:54:52] them that we eat at their restaurants we
[1:54:55] buy their gas
[1:54:56] you know what i mean we bring a lot of
[1:54:58] economy
[1:54:59] to the bedford so pray for them over
[1:55:01] there that uh the lord will light a
[1:55:05] fire on them i i was to the point where
[1:55:08] i was going to pray that god struck him
[1:55:10] with lightning but
[1:55:12] i'm trying i'm trying to soften my
[1:55:15] spirit
[1:55:16] and you know agree with my adversaries
[1:55:19] quickly but uh i i i i am closing but i
[1:55:24] will testify
[1:55:26] we we had we had trouble
[1:55:29] with somebody tim i told our
[1:55:32] the civil engineer i said that guy's
[1:55:34] gone
[1:55:36] and he said what do you mean i go and
[1:55:37] say he's not going to be there next
[1:55:39] night
[1:55:39] right he's gone sure enough next month
[1:55:42] he was gone
[1:55:44] and then we had this other guy and i
[1:55:46] don't know the situation around that guy
[1:55:48] but i'd turn in an application and he'd
[1:55:51] write me a letter
[1:55:52] we don't receive this application i said
[1:55:55] what do you mean you don't receive the
[1:55:56] application
[1:55:57] we we count it as not being filed i said
[1:56:00] you can't do that
[1:56:03] i filed it i paid the money you took the
[1:56:05] money
[1:56:09] you know and
[1:56:12] and so i i wrote a letter
[1:56:16] and you know we put all the trustees and
[1:56:18] deacons names on it we sent it to the
[1:56:20] city manager and we said it to the city
[1:56:22] attorney you know what i mean and we
[1:56:25] sent it to the guy that
[1:56:27] approved our our letter and next week he
[1:56:30] was gone
[1:56:32] you know i don't know whether to go over
[1:56:34] there and tell them if you guys want to
[1:56:35] keep their job
[1:56:36] you better help get to get this
[1:56:41] church bill you know what i mean or what
[1:56:44] we'll do is we'll have
[1:56:45] our members run for city council and
[1:56:48] we'll just put people from our church on
[1:56:49] the city council
[1:56:52] you know but anyway we're praying we've
[1:56:55] done
[1:56:56] everything they've asked us to do so
[1:56:58] we're right at the very last
[1:57:00] stages as you notice we have raised
[1:57:04] 470 000 dollars
[1:57:07] in our building fund we're getting close
[1:57:09] to
[1:57:10] our goal to where how much money we had
[1:57:14] to have
[1:57:15] if we were able to make the payments
[1:57:20] at the same offering level
[1:57:23] that we are now so
[1:57:26] i i don't know we have somewhere to be
[1:57:29] between uh 280 and
[1:57:33] 340 members covets kept some of them out
[1:57:37] we haven't seen for
[1:57:38] a long time and if you notice some of
[1:57:40] those people call them
[1:57:41] let them know you're praying for them
[1:57:43] they're faithful they're still
[1:57:45] giving but there's been a lot that have
[1:57:47] been out
[1:57:48] because of it but and out of those
[1:57:52] all those people we have probably about
[1:57:55] 120
[1:57:57] givers which you know is
[1:58:00] adults we don't expect our young
[1:58:02] children to give
[1:58:05] we can tell when a child gives because
[1:58:08] uh
[1:58:09] the dollar bills come in looking like
[1:58:11] this
[1:58:12] you know what i mean and we don't
[1:58:14] believe any adult
[1:58:17] if in his right mind would
[1:58:20] take a dollar bill look at you might be
[1:58:23] embarrassed it's a dollar bill
[1:58:25] but we're glad to have it but it cost us
[1:58:28] five dollars to unfill
[1:58:33] you know and then we gotta iron it and
[1:58:36] start shed
[1:58:38] so it looks like it's not fake currency
[1:58:42] so i'm gonna maybe get boxes instead of
[1:58:45] bags
[1:58:46] and you can just take it out and lay it
[1:58:49] in there flat
[1:58:53] or if you're embarrassed how much it is
[1:58:55] just put it in the envelope
[1:58:59] but if you don't write your name on it
[1:59:01] we have no way of giving you
[1:59:02] record for it record it for
[1:59:06] your uh your tech statement which we do
[1:59:09] supply if you need one but anyway we're
[1:59:12] getting close
[1:59:13] and it's a good thing if we can
[1:59:17] raise money praise the lord for the
[1:59:20] first time lumber
[1:59:22] has come down it dropped a thousand
[1:59:25] dollars
[1:59:26] which is huge so if we can just
[1:59:30] uh get lumber cheaper that's going to
[1:59:33] help us and if supplies start coming off
[1:59:35] so i believe everything's pre-planned
[1:59:39] you know what i mean and so i i just
[1:59:42] think we're right
[1:59:44] on the edge of doing it and it would be
[1:59:46] nice for us to have room and be able to
[1:59:48] do a few things and
[1:59:50] and i presume that in the future
[1:59:53] there'll be more weddings and we can
[1:59:55] have a nice church to have weddings in
[1:59:58] and have a nice place for afterwards for
[2:00:00] those that want it so
[2:00:02] let's pray and have nice nurseries two
[2:00:06] nurseries one for nursing mothers
[2:00:08] one for the dads that are going to look
[2:00:11] after the kids
[2:00:12] well the mothers look after the babies
[2:00:14] so
[2:00:15] we're trying to do something that's nice
[2:00:17] for us so we keep us in prayer which
[2:00:20] we're right we're right at the verge of
[2:00:23] crossing over and being able to do
[2:00:26] something
[2:00:26] and and uh we're praying for those that
[2:00:29] some people have have on their heart
[2:00:31] to come and join our fellowship
[2:00:35] and put their shoulder to the wheel and
[2:00:37] so we want to pray that god
[2:00:39] offers them but most of all
[2:00:43] i'd like to see converts
[2:00:46] amen and we had some visitors today i
[2:00:49] believe brother john or brother craig
[2:00:52] brought him from granberry to me that's
[2:00:54] marvelous
[2:00:56] and of course i know i didn't preach a
[2:00:58] message that seemed like
[2:01:00] it was for somebody that's new but you
[2:01:03] never know what
[2:01:04] word will strike that seed you know and
[2:01:08] i've
[2:01:08] i've met many a believer who came to
[2:01:11] this message by listening to serpency
[2:01:15] amen you know what i mean so i'm not
[2:01:17] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[2:01:20] it doesn't have to be modified it don't
[2:01:22] have to be sugar coated
[2:01:24] if there's a deep in there and that deep
[2:01:26] calls to that deep
[2:01:28] that deep will respond so just have
[2:01:30] faith let's pray that
[2:01:32] uh our wednesday nights have been
[2:01:34] growing
[2:01:35] in attendance i think that's wonderful i
[2:01:38] trust our
[2:01:38] today's father's day i understand but i
[2:01:41] trust that our
[2:01:42] our sunday evenings will get stronger
[2:01:45] and
[2:01:45] don't forget prayer service the first
[2:01:48] tuesday of every month
[2:01:49] they're really growing in strength and
[2:01:52] the presence of god
[2:01:53] is there and you give that hour of
[2:01:55] prayer you'll see the
[2:01:57] change and the power of god in your life
[2:01:59] you believe he's the same
[2:02:01] yesterday today wherever you believe he
[2:02:03] loves you

[2:02:06] place for you then let your deep start
