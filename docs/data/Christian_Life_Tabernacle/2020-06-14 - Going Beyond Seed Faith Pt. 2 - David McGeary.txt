Description:
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: June 14,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Joseph Knapp who was an accomplished musician the florists but she was also the wife of the president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and mrs. Knapp had composed a tune and asked Fanny aunt Fanny as she was known to everyone back then what is this - and say to you Fanny said I'm just gonna give me a minute and she knelt and prayed and she got up and she said that tune says blessed assurance Jesus is mine and as she proceeded to dictate those words mrs. Knapp wrote them down to the music just the way we know it today blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine air of salvation I'm born of his spirit washed in his blood Arab salvation purchase of God born of his spirit washed in his blood this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long my precious now departed dear mother-in-law used to call Ellen almost every day and she always asked her what is your song today because her mother always had a song my wife inherited the gene and she wakes up with a song every day as well and she told me this morning she said well sometimes I wake up with a song it's not a good song she woke up the other day to the song America the Beautiful she said I had to get rid of that one and find a new song you know Fanny Crosby she wrote it seemed intended by the Blessed Providence of God that I should be blind all my life and I thank him for that dispensation if perfect earthly sight were offered to me tomorrow I would not accept it I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things around me so it begs the question what is our song are we distracted by the beautiful and interesting things around us are we distracted by the news and the pandemic and the rioting or whatever else is going on if it's not one thing it's another are we too busy listening to the ticker of the stock tape and the Wall Street Journal that we're missing the song of our life and we don't have to sing many of us can't but in our heart we should always have a song because all down through the Old Testament songs were used by the people of God to worship and praise Him they crossed the Red Sea had a song they arrived in the promised land it said Moses taught them a new song David has a whole book of Psalms we're gonna read one this morning Song of Solomon Isaiah Isaiah wrote great um that's a here sorry David's life was full of acid the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song in the book of Revelation we know that they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous either are they works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints so as I stumble through this this morning the point is what are what is the song that we're singing every day do we get up with thanks and praise rejoicing and what God has done for us we allow ourselves to get distracted by the things that tie our shoelaces together and get us off track how important is it that we give voice to the praise of the Lord that our lives sing honor and praise and glory and victory and Thanksgiving to the king of our salvation to the Lord of lords and we just we just want to remember this this morning that God loves to hear us sing let's turn to Psalms 47 this morning as we read it together songs 47 o clap your hands all ye people shout on to God with the voice of triumph for the Lord Most High is terrible he is a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of Jacob whom he loved Salah God has gone up with a shout the Lord with a sound of a trumpet sing praises to God sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises for God is the king of all the earth singing praises with

Lord we committed into your hands the ones that's the author and finisher of our faith that knows the beginning from the end we just certainly Lord commit our hearts in our lives to you this morning once again we thank you for all that you've done for us in the precious name of your son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn in our Bibles this morning over to Ephesians and read a couple of very familiar scriptures and we on a just fellowship this morning kind of just to go through some things and just have a good time in the Lord so let's read in Ephesians chapter 1 and we'll read the first few verses of that of Ephesians chapter 1 it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus so we see that this epistle is written to the believer to those that are faithful in Christ Jesus because those who aren't faithful aren't going to get it okay so he says grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace were and he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath proposed in him self amen and then let's just read over in Ephesians 2 in 10 it says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them father bless your word to us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning we're going to if I could sake continue on from where we were last week and just keep building and you know last Wednesday I don't know if any of you had an opportunity to hear brother Randy's sermon but I certainly would recommend that if you didn't that you go back and listen to it and and you know as he was preaching he he you know was I had written notes as I was going down this road and he was just going on all those notes and not you know and and then I can't went to the men's breakfast yesterday morning and the brothers started talking about all the things that I had planned to minister on and I thought you know I thought well boy did they take the wind out of your sails and I thought no they put wind in my sails amen and someone said oh boy they they used to say if the preacher said something you were going to say they would say oh he stole my thunder no he gave me more thunder and I'll tell you out Lucinda Balaam's donkey if I can hear the word of God you know what I mean that's what I want to hear I want to hear the word of God so we're just going to continue on a lot of the things the brother said and we're talking about we'll talk about but they're worth talking about amen how many times you've heard a Bible story you can sit down right now and tell me the story of David and Goliath and I'll like it I've never got tired of hearing that story I never will get tired of hearing that story and it doesn't have nothing to do with my name being David I would like that story if my parents had named me Goliath but anyway because it's the truth it's the Bible and that's what we love and so what we we we want to just kind of approach this morning I told Billy I'm just going to try to teach a little bit this morning and not get excited of course he just grand and you know like okay whatever I'm going to do my best but anyway it's just that this web program says he says now preaching usually catches the sinner and brings him under condemnation by the word so there's a part of the word of God that brings us under condemnation or the word is not to mean it condemns you but it convicts you or it enlightens you that you're on a path of destruction and therefore the idea of convicting you is to change your ways to correct doesn't mean to punish it means to change your course for your betterment and God does that by grace and we know that grace is God intervening in your life from the throne of God making intervention in your life to change the inevitable outcome of your works and your decisions and the path you're on so if you're on a path going down the road a hundred miles an hour and there's a there's the bridges out and you're headed right over a cliff and and you there's no way you know that Cliff's there grace comes down and God decides I'm not going to let that man go over the cliff I'm going to intervene in his life I'm going to say to him you're going too fast you better slow down you better change directions you better and he convicts him and he brings it to his attention and he makes a change in his life so he doesn't end up with the result of his life and so that's what preaching of the gospel does to catch the sinner and to catch us when that our lives are not on the right path but we are talking this morning about teaching but teaching places a man positionally what he is now remember we begin to talk a while back about not who we are but what we are and so he says that's what teaching does teaching positionings a man what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are amen so that is that's what we're that's what we're working towards that's what we're talking about what that we are and so we we know that we have an inheritance and I certainly liked that song this morning because in that song he said he shall choose our inheritance for us so God has chosen our inheritance and we that's the kind of what direction that we would like to move in now when we talk about a believer and so we want to look at ourselves this morning and just so we're we're not preaching kind of a general gospel but we're giving a teaching this morning so that each of us can reflect upon ourselves because we're members in particular we're fitted enjoying together but each one of us is a part each one of us has a part we're a body and we've been given different places in that body so we talked about last week about our subject was going beyond a seed faith so that that's what was put on our heart going beyond seed faith and so we looked at Moses and we saw that Moses was a believer right he had faith he was born with a a tremendous faith and we'll reach some statements concerning that that Moses had a tremendous faith in his life but that faith came from the fact that he was chosen and he also believed God because his mother taught him he believed and that he was separated from his mother's womb by God so had seed faith and and that seed faith responded to the Word of God so he heard the Word of God and just look at us this morning you heard the Word of God you believed it someone else heard the Word of God and it went over their head it just didn't catch their attention you know but there was something in you like antenna or a receiver that you felt the pull of it and so that was there that that seed was in there and that seed responds and just like our prophet talked about botany life he said that seed responds to the Sun and that Sun pulls out of that seed and causes that seed to grow and so it is with us we have a seed and the S o n we hear that light that sunlight falls on us and we respond to that sunlight we respond to that word we respond to that conviction we respond to the instruction we respond to the the learning of the as we're taught the Godhead as we're taught grace as we were taught the Scriptures just like you go to school and they want to teach you of course I don't know what they teach anymore do they still teach kerfs at all is that even a subject I guess not it really I'm getting up there someone wrote me a letter saying brother McGarry you're getting old and you're not going to be with us very long can you please write down your wisdom and I thought I got that person fooled but you know you are wisdoms the Bible a man that's where the fear of God's the beginning of wisdom anyway you should every decision you make you should take back to the scriptures but we go to school and we learn and and and we're learning and we realized that in order to have productive citizens to have people that can take care of themselves and provide and be part of society that we would have to teach them and we used to teach manners manners was a way that you would conduct yourselves and everybody would conduct themselves according to these manners and we would get along with one another it would provide for us social order it would provide for us a common sense of decency you would give a lady a seat you would open the door for somebody you would help somebody with groceries you wouldn't interrupt in the middle of somebody's conversation you will hear parents tell their children now a susie a daddy's talking now you just know nowadays it's yes Suzy what do you want you know that's prophecy that the children shall rule but you used to teach manners so things life could go on and so that's what the Word of God does it it it teaches us it were growing were we're learning and the seed in us is responding to that what we hear that that seed faith and Moses had that seed faith in fact he had it not intellectually and in in in his heart and therefore he went and he tried to perform it by intellect but we found out that there was something beyond seed faith and and sowed after what we were we're going down that Road so that we can we can grow and and mature if and isn't that what we want to do we really want to grow and mature so let me say this here is I'm reading he says that's where the believer comes he first comes to the recognition that he's a sinner okay so that is what we call being called right so we have stages in our life and the first part of our stage was the call and what usually we refer to that as the germination of the seed by the word so God allows your life to get to a place because a seed has to be in a certain temperature in a certain condition in a certain place in order for it to germinate so in your life each of your lives that sitting here your you you be there you're either here being prepared to be called you're here having been called you you understand but it all starts with a calling and you didn't choose him he chose you so that's where it starts you didn't one day brightly decide that serving God was the right thing to do no yeah that's what Jesus looked at me said you didn't choose me I chose you okay so and we also placed that calling we placed the same word with that as election that he elected us so all that he foreknew he called he chose he knew who would have salvation so he made a provision for them through his blood and by calling them so we are all called he says so we're believer comes in he first comes to the recognition he's a sinner he's called then he is separated by the waters the washing of the waters of the word by the blood or the washing of the water by the word rather believing on the Lord Jesus Christ so we he's called and then he's washed or we would call that he's being justified okay and that's what's beautiful about justification in other words everything that's laid to your charge all the debt you owe for your sin the rightful of the rightful punishment the rightful reaping all those things he he justifies you he takes it from your charge and makes you as if you never done it in the first place now if you have a record like mine you really love justification in fact he goes so far in teaching of marriage and divorce that you're justified because it was caused by the previous husband or previous nature that you got from Eve out of the garden oh you never did it in the first fall thank you Lord and not only that I paid for any debt that you would have oh thank you lord hallelujah I'm not fighting that battle no more you understand we got it we're moving past that battle we're going beyond see faith so so we're just a and then we're washed by the walk by the water of the word then being justified be faith he becomes partakers at the peace with God through Christ Jesus baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so then we are invited and listen to this now we are through the blood of Jesus Christ we're at peace with God through Christ baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to omit him into the journey you get it into the journey then he becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim he's on his journey to what a promise that God made Oh amen so now we've been called we been justified we've been sanctified we've entered into the journey right we've been baptized with the Holy Spirit so this is who we're talking to this morning we're not preaching the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're not preaching against sin so to speak in other words we're not preaching against the attribute of sin that identifies that you are a unbeliever so if you're doing this if you're doing that if you're doing this you are this so we're not even going there we're moving on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance of sin of laying on of hands and those things which we will do if God so permits but we're moving on to a perfection hey man that's what I want to do so this is what we're talking about so this is who that who that we are this morning now he's talking and then we're talking this morning Duke spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel who has possessed the land Oh aren't you glad you've come out of Egypt garlic and I thought this morning I am so glad I am not relying on this world or this government I mean we got anarchy in the land we've got a bunch of people who went down inside the city set up barricades have got guns and said we are in an autonomous zone we rule this 12 blocks of downtown Seattle good for you I'm going to pick the better city where it's not so dismal and rainy all the time and all that stuff but nobody against Seattle if you're listening from Seattle my advice is move but anyway so thank God I mean I think we would all be better off if we I think they call it going off the grid if we just turn off our radios quit listen to all those Talking Heads quit listening to all those politicians because they don't rule your life anyway Amen God rules your life he is the provider I have not seen the righteous beg bread saved the Lord I'm Jehovah Jireh I will provide I will take care of you Amen nobody is going to take you home until I decide I want you home you've lived out your purpose take me home this is not our home okay so we're talking so this is to us listen to the description of who that you are this morning and where that you're setting and understand that what we're talking about is moving forward from this position here it says that who has possessed land aren't you glad you come out of the out of Egypt garlic aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness and remember they had to eat manna angels food out of heaven until they crossed over into the land and when they crossed over into the land the manna cease to fall they were fully matured then all right how long have we been in this message 50 some years we've listened we're talking about fully matured so this is this where we want to go forward from the position of maturity okay so we're not been a labor trying to mature you you know what I mean I mean there comes a time when you know you got to open the door and say there's the world I've done everything with you that I can do you've got to choose the way that you're going to go you've grown up now so it says and now the roasts and remember they had eaten a manna food from heaven they crossed over now then they were fully matured then eat the old corn out of the land now that you're you're not babes anymore now that you're not desiring the sincere milk of the gospel that you don't have to be babes padded and persuaded to come to church now that you're really fully matured Christians you're ready to eat strong meat now okay we're done old please come to church we're done come take communion come take communion because if you don't know by now that if you don't take communion you will not be there and the story that's what he taught I can't change that I would love to change that I may be there pleading for you Lord they don't come back to church on communion they got other things to do they forgive them Lord they they got to work and they got to do this and they got to do that and the Lord said I only gave them three Commandments I only told them there's three things they must do they must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus right that automatically leaves you to the promise you do that he gives you the Holy Ghost okay take communion and foot washing because he said do this in remembrance of me so if you refuse to do it then your feet refusing to keeping him your memory so it that is the evidential proof that he's not on your mind and that's between you and him okay and then it's foot-washing I have given you an example do as I have done to you direct specific commandments of the Lord which most of you that are under my voice do not do so you are headed to divine judgment because he said I will not judge you but my word will judge you so I'm not preaching to you this morning that don't take communion and foot washing you're not in this conversation you're already out of the program you do all you want to try to get in you want back in repent be baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ and they that love me keep my Commandments so you can wrap yourself in phony man-made religion you can put the title on it the message of the hour you can say that you believe God sent a prophet Satan believes the same thing okay now if you said well I couldn't come to communion because of culvert bye I'm talking about your heart you knows a lot of difference in wanting to be there and not being able to be there or having something better to do I'd rather stand on the unemployment line and take communion and go to heaven but anyway we're not preaching to you so why stay there let's move on I just want to make that clear I wanted to make it clear who were preaching to because we're preaching to the minority now right and he says he said he says that desire that's a serious thought you're ready for strong meat now you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep and rich Oh we'll get into that directly it's the hidden since the foundations of the world so this elect group of people this mature group of people is now going to partake in something that's been hid from the foundation of the world he said now that you've come into this I am addressing this to you not to those who've just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that has received the promise so now work we're moving to a gospel let's do a specific elected class of people from the foundation of the world so it doesn't mean that that you can't come to that but in order to come to what we're talking about you've got to come out of Egypt you've got to mature you've got to keep his Commandments and then you're ready see her mom always told us that we make God a big dodi grandpa and he's not a big Dodie grandpa and so he really wants something for us he says how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost oh are you glad that you're not in the land over here now aren't you glad you're in the land over here now aren't you glad you're in this Holy Spirit land aren't you glad you're in Christ Jesus aren't you glad well I'd hate to be here and not be happy then you're like Lot's wife he said and you're that you're eating the early corn eating the strong things of God and got a clear understanding your spiritual mind is unmodeled up you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you know and whom you have believed and are persuaded he's able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day oh that's the ones that Paul's talking to now Oh maaan praise God that's the ones because he said I'm teaching the same message that Paul taught remember what is Lady osya luke warm and the call the lady osya is I would that you wouldn't be lukewarm I would that you'd either be hot or cold because if you're lukewarm I'm going to spill the out of my mouth you say well why would he rather have you cold because you're cold he can correct you it could be good he can convict you he can deal with you and talk to you but when you're lukewarm you're in the bondage reasoning how many just reasoned away everything I said about communion can't help you I'm sorry you've doomed yourself carry the picture of the pillar of fire around all you want claim Malachi 4:5 all you want claim revelations 10 7 all you want I'll tell you somebody else who believes it and knows it's true he's a fallen angel his name's Lucifer this is about Jesus Christ who is the word it is about the person of Jesus Christ and you and what he is to you and what you are to him this is about a supernatural relationship it's about a human being being in a supernatural relationship with a supernatural God living in a carnal state being in a supernatural relationship and talking to a supernatural being sokka Moses with the faith that he had couldn't accomplish anything till he came into the presence of that burning bush and he meant a God that could talk back to him now if you haven't got there you're on the journey there okay and the Holy Spirit is going to continue to lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again and I will guide you and teach you and reveal to you and bring to your remembrance at all the things that I have taught you so I will continue to work with you and teach you and grow you into maturity but somewhere now in the time that we're living there must be seeds that are coming to maturity so we're in the harvest time we're in the sunlight so we need to let the shade clouds of the world blow over and come back into that sunlight and begin to mature alright so we see that so so what we're talking right now is we're talking to you to the people now if there's things that are wrong with your life well well we understand that but so now this is what we're talking about we're just laying some foundations this morning and teaching and just laying it out there so that our understanding will be enlightened because I believe there's higher ground but the week that we just don't want to keep sitting around going higher ground higher ground higher ground I want higher ground Lord lift me up to higher ground well he's the kind of God that says this is higher ground bring them back to this mountain so he said he says now he has predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according as his for his own good pleasure of his will according to the good pleasure of his will so if he has predestinated us to adoption of his will for his good pleasure now I'm moving toward something this is class this morning I'm doing pretty good staying calm but if I get going going good I hope I'm reading slow enough for the interpreters you can just paraphrase the best to get the idea Oh much pleasure whose pleasure was it whose goodness his own his own good pleasure his own will now what is adoption now let me get this now I don't know whether I have time to get through this but I'll hit it then if there's a question you can ask me a little later on something a message so this is where we're picking up now listen your adoption is not your birth okay being filled with the Holy Ghost is not your adoption could that's the tutor that leads you to your adoption this message was the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes and do these thing and any man to say it's Bailes about it will not be forgiven in this life or the life to come there's some very bold voices out there today that are going to come to the realization of that scripture and but on their defense you say you defense a critic yeah I'll defend the critic because they've got a point and their point is that we don't know our Bible now my point is is they know their Bible but they don't have a revelation of it if I want to lay this down pretty strong this morning in the teaching but you can't rely on brother Branham to get you there okay you don't even want to start the question how much I believe this message it was the tutor it was teaching us it wasn't the new birth it wasn't the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's many many good Christian people who have the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that he will be there because they have walked in all the light that they were given and they are my brothers you're not going to create some elitist message club and present some sort of membership card to st. Peter at the gate I hope that analogy doesn't offend you like Daniel Henry you know he thought he had it pretty sewed up till he got into the presence of the Lord so we we've started this great journey and so now we we understand that we understand that we've been adopted or predestinated so let's go he says he says your adoption your adoption is not your birth it is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit your adoption is your placing right when you were born again John 1:7 I believe when you were born of the Spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for the the sons of the last day and that always means daughters use you see to see what I'm trying to get to you to see to see we are predestinated unto adoption so we are predestinated unto placing token back quote so we've been tutored in the message by the messenger right which is the former rain he said what people thought was the latter rain just became an unrighteous partaking of the gifts of the Holy Spirit right so what everybody did everybody saw in the Bible and I'm going to I'm going to move to this and this morning I hope I just say it in a good spirit but everybody started doing their own thing so they were doing good works but he said I never knew you that's like going on the job and and you go on the job and you have somebody working and you get there and and you said wait a minute I thought I I told you to move these bricks from here to there and they said oh but I look at this I built this fence and I dug a swimming pool you know and they've got a whole litany of works works works works works like a mule doesn't know his daddy doesn't know his mama it just works works works works has no idea that they've been predestinated to a place okay predestinate it to a place we're predestinated to placing that's what this ages in elected chosen people that were going to be placed according to his good pleasure and his good will wasn't a bunch of preachers preaching a clone model that everybody should conform to I think I'm just gonna get to my point in and I have a lot of such other wonderful quotes to read but this took - to show you how important this placing is and and the the if I could say this the the the the must of it okay see we've got everything now gays two options I like Aaron one time to preach a message about choices and one of the points he brought out there's like a hundred and fifty five choices of water water is h2o you understand it's packaged a hundred and fifty five different ways so that you have to have a choice therefore man becomes occupied with choice choice is a form of reasoning choice creates reasoning we don't have a choice we're trying to do away with choice this Bible study this morning are we ready we ready for strong meat right we want to go on so this is what I'm saying is we've got to the place where everything's an option I will if I can I don't have to I'm okay my name's written in the Lamb's Book of Life okay nothing can put it in nothing can take it out but there's another part of that you know and that is you won't lose it but your works will be tried by fire and it might you eat I just don't want to even go into that subject but let's let's just listen and I want to read this because I want you to understand that what we're talking about is not an option unless you make this pursuit you will not obtain the maturity and the perfection that we need for the rapture we're trying to take off the false covering of religion and realize that God's Word is an absolute truth is not a process of human reasoning truth is not a forum of thinking we don't decide truth truth is eternal truth was there before we were there we want to come in to the truth because the truth is what sets is free it sets us free from hell death and the grave without truth you are going to have hell death and the grave that means you're going to be punished you're going to die and you're going to be eternally separated from God so listen to this statement because I want to lay this deep in our hearts that where we're going is not an option it's something that we must take heed of so we've asked the questions what are we building we need to get back to work brother Randy put it we need to walk in the vision he says now there's where the church is failing today is on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed your misbehavior of unconfessed sins of you believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the Day of Judgment you will be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother branham well that's the truth think of it all right so we're talking about going beyond seed faith we've all rested on seed faith seed think we got the seed we got the seed we got the seed we got the seed oK you've got the seed now that seed is predestinated for a placing and if you don't make that placing you're out of place and in order therefore to be a rapture I should have found the quote every believer must be in their place so this is what we're moving to I'm going to read just a few more statements and then draw my closing argument I always wanted to say that because somebody the other day asked me if I was had my bar license if I was a lawyer really ripped me up and down over the coals but anyway I won't go into that but it's quite the story he said go we talking about art our conduct he says now he says now we find out now this is worth we're talking to now listen because Moses is a type right he was a type of Christ and then the believers come down and him in the Exodus that Moses was in so we're in an exodus so we understand he says now this is the kind of faith that we're talking about mature faith now we find out that Moses had faith Moses his faith led him to watch what would be not what was there's two faiths in this message those that keep looking back at what the messenger was what he did what indicated what he taught okay and they keep pointing back to it as being the source of salvation there's only one place that God meets the believer that's under the shed blood of Jesus Christ it's the word he is the word the word is a thought expressed God only meets the believer in his thoughts not our collective thought not our collective reasoning not our collective doctrine not our patting one another on the back god only meets us in him so not what was looking at tomorrow instead of today looking at the promise instead of the glamour looking at the people instead of the organization see God did that so he's talking about this believer this mature believer that's living in the promise under the presence of the Holy Spirit is looking to tomorrow it's looking to what's ahead it's looking remember this message was prophecy it was preaching what was it was pointing out the conditions surrounding the prophecy but the message in the prophecy was a prophecy about an elect lady and what she would be again bye-bye and what she would be and that there would be a people that would hear that message and be drawn by predestination to the adoption or placing so don't get caught up just living this life thinking that there's not a participation of prophecy in your life see God did that so he talks about lot lots can see the glamour and prosperity down in Sodom lot can see the possibilities of money lot to see the possibilities when he looked over Sodom so he saw those possibilities and he was drawn to Sodom he knew Lee was a nephew of Abraham he knew he knew business he knew he was intelligent he watched Abraham prosper he knew the secrets of success so he was drawn to the Sodom so he went down he said he said Lots intellect led him to see the blessings of glamour but his faith was so paralyzed he didn't see the fire that was going to destroy that sort of life and that's the way that people are today they see the possibilities of providing to a great organization they see the possibility to have this social standing with the people of the city but they don't see the possible as they don't see their faith is paralyzed praise God I want to unparallel and that's what happens the world paralyzes your faith if you love the world and the things of the world you understand John says the love of God is not in you it's not that you don't believe in God it's not that you don't love God but you don't love the purpose of the good pleasure of his will that's what you're not in love with that I'm predestinated to adoption for the good pleasure of his will you're not in love with placing you're not in love with adoption because that's individual and everybody wants to do be everybody else you know I want to be this I want to be that you only know half the story you see me here preaching but you might think I'm okay but you just don't see this big black bean I have to deal with oh yeah the flesh Ward's against the spirit and the spirit against God the carnal mind is enmity with God life is a constant warfare but we will he said the faith it is paralyzed he says now honest yet honest been like lot settle down and Sodom knowing that it's wrong see what do you do when they do that Oh Lord you know it's wrong to stay out of church you know it's wrong to work on Sunday you know it's wrong not to take communion you know it's wrong to listen you know it's wrong you know it's wrong you know what's wrong you see so you're not going to come in to adoption and placing until you come into obedience all them that are in Christ Jesus live godly and I'm not talking about a legal standpoint I'm talking about maturity I'm talking about love I'm talking about Union I'm talking about fellowship I'm so glad that I have a place I didn't lay my hat in an hour like this I love those words I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end I love that if I started to work than you I'll finish until the end hallelujah but what I want to know what is that work let me say this you couldn't be placed you couldn't be positioned until the seals were opened he said knowing is wrong seat what do they do when they do that they paralyze the little faith that they did have it can't work you understand the faith that God wanted Moses to have the faith he wanted to have when he went to that burning bush but they spoke back to him and told him all the power that he had didn't we just ask that question how many have the Holy Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit you've been in dude with power from on high in other words you have been provided with the power to bring every promise in the Bible to pass but Moses got in a situation and it paralyzed his faith so God wanted to tell them Moses you're called you're elected to do this I want to take it for me doing it to you doing it what I am I want you to be the works that I do shall you do also no don't go beatin yourselves down this morning it's a promise I loved the way Randy thought I thought that was so inspired he said if Satan condemns you you shout the victory praise God one more thing I'm going to overcome Thank You Satan for revealing that to me now Moses give way to that and it's set his faith paralyzed now listen to this now Moses gave way to that another word he didn't let the glamour of the world paralyze his faith he counted the reproach of Christ greater than the wealth of Egypt so as Moses gave away to that and he said his faith and he said his faith paralyzed the world either your faith will paralyze glamour or either glamour will paralyze your faith now you have to take on you've got to take it on something's paralyzing our faith so that's the first thing we got to do take on the world what do we call that applying the token once the token was applied and the death angel of sin had no more effect on them they could start the journey they can start to being tutored they can start to be taught but if you come to church and every summon condemns you the Lord Jesus Christ could appear in in an abolition some part of spiritual form and tell you you're going to heaven and that thing would still bother you does the Holy Spirit convict you of sin that's why it's given to the overcomer so let's move beyond condemning purpose in your heart I'm gonna work on this I'm gonna overcome this but as I am overcoming this I'm going to walk on in Christ I'm going to follow the Holy Spirit because if I don't follow the spirit it's going to go on and leave me behind and move on to somebody else that's the say of the Lord it'll be taken from one and given to another so we don't go by our senses you like to say it's because it's a denomination something big well we've got more members nearly than any Church in the world but there's only one real Church and you don't join it you're born into it you understand so I'm talking about a church that's not this church we're talking about a mystical body of Christ that is made up of members and ticular Paul said summon I summon ear some more cumberly than others everybody's got their part and they've got to be placed and positioned in that part and there's only one place you get that Commission and have the faith your see faith anointed in that in the presence of the pillar of fire in the presence of Almighty God in the Shekinah glory behind the veil I don't know how many other biblical descriptions to it but it's where God speaks back and you quit doing the talking and you hear him and what is he gonna say I've already told you I've already collected you please go do this let me place you in other words your per your predestinated to a spot he says you're born into it and you're born in it the living God works himself through you and makes himself known there's where God dwells in his church wait a minute you mean God is resident somewhere he's not just at heaven he's actually resident now if if you knew your Bibles automatically that's Scripture in a phone in your mind you are the temples of the Living God now I don't want to sound like I don't believe this message but it would be nice if we spent as much time reading our Bible as we did listening to tapes and you say why because the guy on the tape said pray and read your Bible and obedience is better than sacrifice and then what would happen is you would become knowledgeable in the common ground of the Bible then you could meet somebody on the common ground of the Bible and I'll meet any man on the common ground of the Bible and show the infallible truth of this message in the scriptures because it was a predestinated word of god and god interpreted his word by bringing it the past just like every prophecy in the Old Testament was manifested in Jesus Christ and He fulfilled every one in the flash but only those that were predestinated to adoption saw it do you think maybe we ought to shake ourselves and let's get back with the program a church that does not have the supernatural will bitterly fail I'm still being nice right that's where God dwells in his church God goes to church every day just lives in church he lives in you you're his church you are his church you're the tabernacle about God dwells in you are the Church of the Living God yourself and if the Living God lives in his living being then your actions is of God if you it isn't then God isn't there he wouldn't make you act like that he says in the word here his blueprint don't do it and you go do it see that's wrong when you deny it it shows the life isn't even in you see that's right so we're talking about a life so we're talking about that we have there's good work right so you are his workmanship is that right created in Christ Jesus which was you were created in the word right in the beginning was the word the Word was made flesh that was Christ Jesus Christ Jesus was the thoughts of God expressed all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ is he poured in the church so when you were created in Christ he was the word nothing that is that is everything that is was created by him so you were created in there in the beginning is that right you were his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God before ordained that you should walk in them so clearly you've got to come into the contact with the works which you were four ordained to walk in now I'm getting to what we're teaching okay you individually and personally we're giving a work list that you were predestinated to be placed to do nothing to do with your religion nothing to do with your faith nothing to do with the seed nothing to do with your name being written on the Lamb's Book of Life moving beyond seed faith to where he was and he said I do nothing unless the father reveals it to me so we know that we're for Dane so we've got to come in contact with that burning bush we've tried to come in contact with the works now not works and I'm going to explain the difference here in a moment and I'll probably fit some critics on this but I finally decided if you don't go through the hall of critics you're not going to go to the Hall of Fame so you've got to come in contact with the works that you're foreordained to okay of fire in your heart for that deeper relationship now here's where I think in my heart where we begin to miss it it's that oneness that comes a unity that he's walking with you okay that what God got upset with Moses about because Moses doubted the unity he had with God that what Satan wants to abolish but here's what's happened so as Christians it began to be taught to us that Jesus was the second person of the Trinity so that he was a pre-existing deity being okay that's not true Jesus was a man now don't go jumping in the lake and don't say that I don't believe in the deity of Jesus Christ I believe in the deity of Jesus Christ because the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him and that's what he prayed father may they be one as we are one so they taught that Jesus was the second person of the Trinity so he had a supernatural pre-existing power and he just came down out of heaven with the power but the Bible said he learned obedience by the things he suffered so we've learned obedience by the themes that we've suffered but this is what's happened they placed Jesus in some sort of on an unattainable place and what we've fallen into if we fallen in to try to reproduce or copy the Lord Jesus so we were copying him he we just we look we see what he did and we tried to copy it we try to we try to look and see that God gave the Lord Jesus a work to do and now we try to follow after that work I know this is going to be kind of just down a tight line but I hope that you couldn't see it so what we do is we sit there and we look back and we say he did this he did that he did this we wear little bracelets and says what would Jesus do so now we continue to look back and we're trying to copy copy copy and we think that we'll be judged by how good we copy and how good we follow and now that becomes the measure of Christianity but he said I'm going to talk to you about the mystery if we go back and read that in Ephesians and he says according to have the foundation in himself the pleasure and then that we might know the mystery of his will now this is what I hope that we can grow to this maturity we were in his mind in the beginning how many I believe that he knew you in the beginning you were predestinated - you were predestinated - good works that you should walk in them so he had in himself you so you yourself are a creation created in Christ Jesus you are a creation with a predestinated place for you to be so it's not that you're copying somebody else it's not that you're following the works that he performed but you've come into the Union and the relationship to manifest what he predestinated you to manifest it won't be a different manifestation than the word because all of that Christ was he poured into the body okay like the great conductor in his mind in the beginning he had a place for you he had an instrument that he wanted you to play he had a sheet music that he wanted you to read and all he wanted you to do is not copy the bass player not copy the drummer not one to play the clarinet instead of the trombone which some people believes the greatest instrument in the orchestra but if he wanted us to understand were predestinated to a place and he doesn't want us trying to copy and make a clone Christianity he wants us to find and take on the responsibility of the predestinated mystery that we are in other words you are thus saith the Lord [Music] you're the sayeth the Lord if he thought it and he spoke it it cannot fail to come to pass he has this place now the mature believer realizes his relationship is not looking back and copying or trying to reproduce or try to do the same thing his relationship is is that he had his place in Christ Jesus that it's personal and he's not ashamed to take it no matter what it is but his maturity brings him on the personal pursuit of what the predestinated will of God was for his life in the beginning it isn't this copycat lack of revelation lack of what you are religion and then you're going to be judged by your works you're going to be judged by your position you're going to be judged by whether it meant so much to you to be where he wanted you so nobody wanted that responsibility so they let nipple lady anism come in and provide a list of qualifications for heaven a list of actions a list of good works and many will come in that day and say Lord Lord we did all these things and he's going to look at the spot that you were supposed to be occupying and he said I never knew you in other words I knew what I predestinated I knew what I fore ordained because I predestinated them unto adoption I predestinated him unto placing and you never consider that I had a personal place for you you just listened to all the voices you just conformed to the world you just listened to everybody saying be like Jesus be like Jesus be like Jesus Jesus was the word Jesus was a man that kept every word of God and every place in position that God chose him to be until he actually became one with God because he was one with the thought of God he was no 2nd person he was all deity without sin yet all obedient man and that's what we're maturing into but we can't reach that place of maturity until we come in contact with the predestinated work that we were four ordained to do and there's only one place you can find that that's in a personal conference with him and if you don't believe you have that if you don't believe you have that place then you're not believing your foreordained and your names written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's what brother Brin said how long will we slack when are we going to get to work not works when are we going to get to our assigned job that's what I want to do that's what you wanted it that's what we want to do in him we want to come to the realization that the seals have been opened we couldn't come to this place until they were because we couldn't know who we were we could knew what we were called to we couldn't understand the oneness we had with him we couldn't understand that we are predestinated and foreordained to placing I would love to place you but I could only place you carnally you'd be my chauffeur you'd be my gardener you'd be my bodyguard you'd be my musician I can only do carnal placing because I'm a carnal being but the only one that can do supernatural placing is him and anything that does it other than him is religion it allows you to put a covering and hide your personal adoption but I feel we're headed every believer in here is headed to that predestinated placing by the Spirit of God because the sun is shining the shuck is pulling away the world's pulling away and we're sitting in the presence of his glorious revealed word and I I just am so thrilled and I can hope that your Christianity can move into the present tense of His divine will for your life not a historical to-do list but a present tense commission to your life from the throne of God your part in the Great Commission go into all the world and preach the gospel to who all the world laying hands on the sick they shall recover taking up deadly things it shouldn't harm you each one of you has a place in that commission that we need to mature to that we can be about the Father's business and it's not an option it's not an option I would say it's a command but I want to say it more in general it's an invite to be partakers of divine nature and that was the spirit that was in Jesus Christ that he did the will the predestinated will of the Father for this cause I have come into the world you have a predestinated will for your life predestinated to an adoption and Anna placing in Christ Jesus you have works that have been for ordained that you should walk in we've got to make contact with that part of our election in order to meet the perfection of the rapture god bless you this morning Billy would you come

wonderful doesn't your faith want to look to the future Lord I believe that you can make of me all everything that you desire me to be let's bow our heads this morning answer these questions let us
