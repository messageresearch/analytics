[34:22] evening i just have a short thought
[34:24] you never know where the lord's going to
[34:25] go but it seems like a short thought at
[34:27] least on the surface but we're
[34:29] just really inspired by everything
[34:31] that's been ministered lately and we're
[34:34] going to turn to psalm
[34:35] 77
[34:38] just grateful for all those that have
[34:40] pressed their way out to the house of
[34:41] the lord in the middle of the week

[34:49] the lord jesus is a shelter in the storm
[34:51] amen
[34:53] our refuge and
[34:56] he's our strong rock and the place where
[34:59] we have our foundation and that
[35:00] revelation that he's given unto us
[35:02] in this hour and we're gonna
[35:06] just do a little bit of reading we're
[35:07] gonna read this whole chapter
[35:09] and then we're gonna turn to second
[35:10] peter chapter one
[35:13] it says i cried unto god with my voice
[35:17] even unto god with my voice and he gave
[35:19] ear unto me
[35:21] in the day of my trouble i sought the
[35:22] lord my sore ran in the night and ceased
[35:25] not
[35:26] my soul refused to be comforted i
[35:29] remembered god and was troubled
[35:31] i complained and my spirit was
[35:33] overwhelmed salah
[35:35] thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so
[35:37] troubled that i cannot speak
[35:40] i have considered the days of old the
[35:42] years of ancient times
[35:44] i called to remembrance my song in the
[35:46] night i commune with my own
[35:48] my own heart and my spirit made diligent
[35:50] search
[35:51] will the lord cast off forever and will
[35:54] he be favorable no more
[35:56] is his mercy clean gone forever doth his
[35:59] promise fail forevermore
[36:01] hath god forgotten to be gracious hath
[36:04] he and anger shut up his tender mercies
[36:06] salah and i said this isn't my infirmity
[36:10] but i will remember the years of the
[36:12] right hand of the most high
[36:14] i remem remember the works of the lord
[36:16] surely i will remember thy wonders of
[36:18] old
[36:19] i will meditate also of all thy work and
[36:21] talk of thy doings
[36:23] thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is
[36:26] so great
[36:27] a god is our god thou art the god that
[36:30] doest wonders thou hast declared thy
[36:32] strength among the people
[36:33] thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy
[36:35] people the sons of jacob and joseph
[36:37] salah
[36:38] the water saw thee oh god the waters saw
[36:41] thee they were afraid the depths also
[36:43] were troubled
[36:44] the clouds poured out water the skies
[36:46] sent out a sound
[36:48] then arrows also went abroad the voice
[36:50] of thy thunder
[36:51] was in the heaven the lightnings
[36:54] lightened the world the earth trembled
[36:56] and shook
[36:57] thy way is in the sea and thy path in
[36:59] the great waters
[37:00] and thy footsteps are not known thou let
[37:03] us thy people like a flock by the hand
[37:05] of moses and aaron
[37:07] and let's just turn to second peter
[37:11] chapter 1 and we're just going to read
[37:13] verses 8 through 15.
[37:28] wait for the pages to stop turning
[37:33] verse 8 says for if these things be in
[37:36] you and abound they make you that you
[37:37] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[37:39] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[37:41] christ
[37:42] but he that lacketh these things is
[37:43] blind and cannot see afar off
[37:45] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[37:47] from his old sins
[37:49] wherefore the rather brethren give
[37:50] diligence to make your calling and
[37:51] election sure for if you do these things
[37:53] you shall never fall
[37:55] for so in entrance shall be ministered
[37:56] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[37:58] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[38:00] christ
[38:01] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[38:03] you always in remembrance of these
[38:04] things
[38:05] though ye know them and be established
[38:07] in the present truth
[38:08] yea i think it meet as long as i am in
[38:10] this tabernacle to stir you up by
[38:12] putting you in remembrance
[38:14] knowing that shortly i must put off this
[38:15] my tabernacle even as our lord jesus
[38:17] christ hath showed me
[38:19] moreover i will endeavor that you may be
[38:21] able after my deceased to have these
[38:23] things always
[38:25] in remembrance amen let's just bow our
[38:27] heads in the word of prayer heavenly
[38:28] father we just ask right now oh god that
[38:29] you would
[38:30] just get me out of the way lord let your
[38:32] perfect will be done this evening lord
[38:34] jesus
[38:35] we just come here to worship you and to
[38:37] hear from your word oh god i just pray
[38:38] that
[38:39] lord you would have preeminence in the
[38:40] service lord have preeminence
[38:42] in in the speaker lord pyramids and the
[38:45] the ones that would hear o god and we
[38:47] just ask that you're
[38:48] perfect we'll be done now we just love
[38:49] you lord and ask you bless the reading
[38:51] of your word in the name of the lord
[38:52] jesus christ we pray
[38:54] amen amen you may be seated
[38:59] so my my thought for this evening i
[39:01] guess just really simply would be i will
[39:03] remember
[39:06] and i guess just being inspired of
[39:09] hearing the sermons this last weekend
[39:11] and kind of going on
[39:13] what we maybe spoke on last time about
[39:15] the different channels that we're trying
[39:16] to
[39:17] to open up unto the lord jesus
[39:20] it seems like in this day one of the
[39:22] biggest things
[39:24] that we deal with is memories
[39:27] you know it as technology has gotten
[39:30] greater and greater it's amazing how
[39:32] the world is so quick to bring up the
[39:34] past about every little thing you know i
[39:36] we're in that political season now and
[39:38] have been for a while and
[39:40] it's amazing how the you know one both
[39:42] you know one side or the other they
[39:44] always do it they
[39:44] someone says something and then what
[39:46] they'll dig back in their twitter
[39:47] history or
[39:48] their facebook posts or what it is and
[39:50] try to find
[39:51] what did you do in the past and now that
[39:53] it's all catalog they can go back and
[39:55] find all these different things and
[39:57] always try to throw it in the face of an
[39:58] individual and say oh you said this or
[40:00] oh i gotcha you know there's always that
[40:02] they call it the gotcha moment that
[40:03] they're trying to get on each other
[40:06] and i feel like that's that's just
[40:08] really just a natural example of what
[40:11] we're really seeing in our lives in this
[40:12] day of
[40:13] what the devil tries to do to the
[40:15] children of god you see the devil
[40:18] we know he's the accuser of the brethren
[40:20] his
[40:21] job as it were was to present himself
[40:23] before the lord
[40:24] and to accuse you and i the the
[40:27] the children of god of unbelief of sin
[40:32] of of these
[40:32] problems that we find in our lives i i
[40:35] so thank the lord we have a real
[40:37] revelation
[40:38] that it was never us in the first place
[40:40] that did it
[40:41] but nevertheless we find that it's the
[40:43] struggle that we all face every single
[40:45] day
[40:46] that we have to wake up every single day
[40:48] with a reminder
[40:50] of the life of sin that has followed us
[40:53] from the time we were born
[40:54] this flesh that we're attached to in
[40:56] this natural body
[40:58] is a daily reminder of the life that we
[41:02] once lived
[41:03] of the the lusts that we once had
[41:06] because
[41:06] sin was condemned in the flesh and as
[41:09] we've been talking about so many times
[41:11] and how
[41:11] that that sin nature trying to express
[41:14] itself
[41:15] and god's nature through the holy ghost
[41:16] trying to express itself through you
[41:19] so we find that one of the greatest
[41:21] things as we heard our pastor minister
[41:23] on
[41:24] this this weekend in the services was on
[41:26] that amnesia that strikes the people
[41:29] and amnesia we understand it's a
[41:33] forgetting of who you are
[41:34] it's it's it's a lack of understanding
[41:36] of who you are
[41:38] what your identification is and and even
[41:40] though
[41:41] we've come to a place even here now this
[41:43] evening on a wednesday night
[41:45] to see the people of god gathering to
[41:47] hear the word of god
[41:49] there's there's a measure of grace that
[41:52] god has given us
[41:53] to overcome that amnesia to recognize
[41:55] i'm a child of god
[41:57] i'm a member of the bride of jesus
[41:58] christ my desire is to the word of god
[42:02] i desire the things of god so i'm going
[42:04] to go to where the things of god are
[42:06] being ministered
[42:08] by the grace of the lord and here we are
[42:10] but every day
[42:11] we struggle with those the the
[42:14] memories in the in the past things that
[42:17] try to creep up and the devil always
[42:18] trying to remind us
[42:20] of those things in our past our our our
[42:23] shortcomings and our failures and so
[42:25] many times
[42:27] even though we don't even know it we
[42:28] fall victim to
[42:30] to succumbing to those ideas because we
[42:33] don't live
[42:34] freely in jesus christ the way we ought
[42:36] to
[42:37] there's so many times such a a measure
[42:40] of guilt
[42:41] that the devil tries to put on the
[42:43] people because
[42:44] we understand the the brother branham
[42:46] told us that
[42:47] if the people of god could get a true
[42:49] revelation
[42:50] of the true church and who she is and
[42:53] the spirits working in the framework of
[42:54] the church should be an invincible army
[42:57] and we have the word of god for the hour
[42:59] that would bring that revelation
[43:02] and i believe even now that revelation
[43:04] is inside each and every one of the
[43:06] children of god
[43:07] the bride of jesus christ and yet it
[43:10] seems such that there's like maybe just
[43:11] a little hindrance there
[43:13] remember we talked the devil can't stop
[43:15] the work of god
[43:16] but his desire is to hinder it as much
[43:18] as he can and just
[43:20] and just to buffet you and to try to
[43:22] hold you back from becoming what the
[43:25] lord
[43:25] has desired for you and one of the
[43:28] greatest ways he does that is with your
[43:30] memories
[43:31] see he loves the devil loves to take
[43:34] away
[43:35] the knowledge of who you are in jesus
[43:37] christ
[43:38] and replace it with a a remembrance of
[43:42] things
[43:43] of god days gone by
[43:46] every day you wake up like i said
[43:48] there's a there's a
[43:50] there's a reminder a flesh that you
[43:52] dwell in
[43:53] that is a reminder to yourself that that
[43:55] you're dying
[43:57] that that if the lord tarries we're
[44:00] we're not long for this world
[44:02] right if the lord were to tarry you get
[44:05] older
[44:05] and the body the physical nature breaks
[44:08] down
[44:10] you know you live by dead substance now
[44:12] but as we've heard the prophet explain
[44:14] it
[44:14] how was it that when i was younger i
[44:16] would eat the same foods drink the same
[44:18] water
[44:19] and i would get stronger and stronger
[44:21] and then i find them now i'm getting
[44:22] weaker and weaker
[44:23] and we understand it this day it's even
[44:25] worse because now we got the hybrid food
[44:26] and we got the
[44:27] all the the atmosphere around us that's
[44:29] just killing the flesh even more
[44:32] just uh just a natural typing the
[44:34] spiritual of the atmosphere that the the
[44:37] devil and the food that satan has fed
[44:39] the people
[44:40] the perversion hybrid word
[44:43] and yet there's something in the
[44:46] believer
[44:47] that knows that there's more
[44:50] beyond what we're seeing right now that
[44:53] there that there is an
[44:54] overcoming power within you that is
[44:58] destined and designed and in fact
[45:01] placed in you by god to overcome this
[45:04] world
[45:06] greater is he that is in you than he
[45:08] that is in the world
[45:10] placed in you designed specifically for
[45:13] overcoming power
[45:18] but what is it we're people we're
[45:20] children we're people of flesh
[45:22] i was born in sin i was shaped in
[45:24] iniquity came into the world speaking
[45:26] lies
[45:27] and so many times that amnesia that we
[45:30] heard about this last weekend
[45:32] strikes us when we least expect it
[45:36] and it may not be in the big waves that
[45:37] you can see right away
[45:40] but over time it's it's like it's an
[45:42] overcoming force
[45:44] just trying to chip away and chip away
[45:46] and chip away
[45:47] and many times it's only because we fail
[45:50] to remember
[45:51] and keep before our eyes always the
[45:54] works of the lord
[45:56] it's very easy to become short-sighted
[45:58] in this hour
[46:01] and only look at the present
[46:02] circumstances
[46:04] everything before you is is in the
[46:06] natural is just
[46:08] crying out that of death and destruction
[46:10] and
[46:11] and chaos and tumult and yet there's
[46:14] something in you
[46:16] that knows that that there's peace and
[46:19] safety
[46:19] in the word of god
[46:24] we read in psalm 77 just
[46:28] the the you can almost feel i feel like
[46:31] you can really
[46:32] feel the the anguish that
[46:35] the man of god is going through writing
[46:37] this says in the day of my trouble i
[46:39] sought the lord my soul ran in the night
[46:41] and cease not
[46:42] my soul refused to be comforted how many
[46:44] of you ever felt like that
[46:45] how many of you ever felt just such a
[46:48] grieve
[46:49] a grieving in your in your spirit in
[46:51] your soul and it's just
[46:52] it's like a pressing you know it's gross
[46:55] darkness in the world
[46:56] in this hour there's a pressing darkness
[46:59] that is that is trying to overcome the
[47:01] believer
[47:03] thank the lord that when the enemy comes
[47:05] in like a flood the spirit of god raises
[47:07] up a standard
[47:09] but many times what what is it it's that
[47:12] that amnesia
[47:13] sensation of you you don't even know
[47:16] because the man with amnesia doesn't
[47:18] even know that they have amnesia
[47:19] they've forgotten who they were they
[47:21] forgotten where they came from
[47:23] they've forgotten the the authority if i
[47:26] could say like that that they have
[47:29] and that's what the devil now see we've
[47:31] come to a place we've come too far
[47:33] for the devil to get us on on so many
[47:37] things
[47:37] that would seem obvious to us now all
[47:40] the you know these
[47:41] the adulteries and and the living in
[47:43] what we call obvious sin and all these
[47:45] things
[47:46] it it's it's those are just scarecrows
[47:48] to us now we see
[47:49] we see those things are far off but it's
[47:51] the little fox is spoiling the vine
[47:54] it's the little things that are creeping
[47:55] in that just even though you don't know
[47:58] it steal away your enemy
[47:59] steal away the memories of what the lord
[48:02] has been showing you what he's been
[48:05] restoring
[48:06] into your life and revealing to you
[48:09] and the only way that you can get it
[48:11] back is by the word of god
[48:13] the only way that you can be restored in
[48:16] this place
[48:17] is by a remembrance of the things of the
[48:20] word of god
[48:21] like peter said he's talking how many
[48:24] times in those scriptures he says
[48:25] i'm gonna stir i'm gonna bring you back
[48:27] by way of remembrance
[48:29] he said though you know these things i'm
[48:31] gonna bring you back by way of
[48:32] remembrance
[48:33] i'm gonna i'm gonna keep you always in
[48:35] remembrance of these things so that even
[48:37] after i leave
[48:38] you'll have these things always in your
[48:39] remembrance
[48:41] we've even had a prophet in this day who
[48:43] stored up food
[48:45] why so that we could have these things
[48:47] always in our remembrance
[48:49] so we've got these storehouses we've got
[48:51] the word of god
[48:52] we've got we've got the the word of a
[48:55] prophet that has
[48:56] revealed the word of god in this hour
[49:00] and what is it to do it's to stir us up
[49:02] in remembrance
[49:04] you know somebody i think we we ought to
[49:06] i think we really one of our things is
[49:08] we ought to be testifying more
[49:10] and i don't even just mean testifying to
[49:12] the to the world and
[49:13] although we should be doing that but we
[49:16] ought to be testifying one to another
[49:18] we are we ought to be remembering the
[49:20] things of god in our life
[49:22] we ought to be restoring these memories
[49:25] of the things
[49:26] even like david said restore unto me the
[49:29] joy of thy salvation
[49:32] i want to i want to bring into
[49:34] remembrance
[49:35] the things that god has done for me you
[49:38] see it's not
[49:38] it's not that we live by that painted
[49:40] fire it's not that we live
[49:42] in a time gone by but so many times when
[49:45] the devil tries to get us down
[49:47] when he tries to bury you under all the
[49:50] things and all the iniquities that no
[49:51] doubt we struggle with sometimes
[49:53] and it seems so great and the things
[49:55] that we know because we know better we
[49:58] know better
[49:59] we've got we've got the word in our
[50:00] hearts we've got the holy ghost there to
[50:02] prick your heart
[50:03] and then the devil well you know the
[50:06] devil said oh you can't pray for that
[50:07] person because of this and this this
[50:09] this
[50:10] what is he doing he's trying to put
[50:11] amnesia upon you
[50:13] trying to make you forget as peter told
[50:16] us that you were purged from these sins
[50:19] trying to make you forget the power of
[50:21] the atonement
[50:23] and that's what really it comes down to
[50:25] is he tries to make us forget the power
[50:28] of the blood of jesus christ because the
[50:31] blood of jesus christ
[50:32] will cleanse you from all of that and it
[50:35] it'll it'll wash your mind with pure
[50:38] water of the word
[50:40] it'll bring you to a place where there's
[50:42] now no condemnation
[50:45] to them who are in christ jesus who
[50:47] don't live according to the flesh
[50:48] anymore
[50:52] but the devil is always there to accuse
[50:55] and it's around every corner he's there
[50:57] to bring up things in your past
[50:59] he's there to bring up things that other
[51:01] people have done he's there to bring up
[51:02] things that you had done
[51:04] he's there to remind you oh you had this
[51:05] trouble and you had that trouble and you
[51:07] did this and you did that
[51:08] and all the while trying to replace you
[51:11] know there's a reason if you go back
[51:13] into the old testament
[51:14] how after they even crossed the river
[51:16] jordan
[51:17] he said erect i want you to erect these
[51:19] stones why it's a memorial
[51:22] of the things that god has done in this
[51:24] place
[51:25] how they would build an altar and
[51:27] sacrifice and they were called upon the
[51:29] name of the lord why
[51:30] it was a memorial to the people
[51:33] of what god had done and each one of us
[51:37] is a memorial unto god of what he's done
[51:40] how many of you can testify god took me
[51:42] out
[51:44] of the mary clay i was maybe you weren't
[51:46] even searching for god
[51:48] but yet he took you out
[51:50] [Applause]
[51:52] and how many times does the devil try to
[51:54] make us forget
[51:56] and give us amnesia about that oh you
[51:58] can't make a rapture
[51:59] like devil you tell me i can't make a
[52:01] rapture i never even thought about a
[52:03] rapture
[52:04] until god called me and gave me a
[52:06] promise
[52:07] that i would make a rapture
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:11] so how can the devil take away a promise
[52:14] that he didn't even give me
[52:16] he can't do it but what if the devil
[52:18] tree tries to twist
[52:19] he tries to turn it he tries to flip the
[52:22] script
[52:23] and put the onus on you to make it as
[52:26] though
[52:26] you're going to accomplish something in
[52:28] yourself
[52:30] no it's going to be to the glory of the
[52:33] lord jesus christ
[52:34] and him alone there's no man going to
[52:37] get glory out of this thing
[52:38] when you when you say farewell to this
[52:40] world and that body change happens in
[52:43] the moment in the twinkling of an
[52:44] eye there ain't nobody going to be
[52:45] around saying well praise
[52:47] god praise the lord i did it no sir
[52:51] it's going to be thank you lord jesus
[52:54] your promises are yeah and amen
[52:56] [Applause]
[52:58] hallelujah
[53:01] every one of us is struggling with
[53:03] different things
[53:04] why because this christian life is a
[53:06] battle
[53:07] and it doesn't stop it's a day you
[53:10] weren't even fighting till you came to
[53:11] the knowledge of this message
[53:13] you weren't even fighting till the holy
[53:15] ghost came into your life
[53:16] and that's when you became an enemy to
[53:18] the devil
[53:20] because at that moment when the holy
[53:21] ghost sealed you in that's when you
[53:23] chose signs
[53:25] actually it showed what side you chose
[53:27] before the foundation of the where
[53:29] it just you finally started to take your
[53:30] position and now the devil knows oh
[53:33] that's one of them i'm so glad that i
[53:35] can say
[53:36] i'm one of them
[53:40] but he tries to make you forget
[53:43] he tries to make you forget see there's
[53:46] nothing wrong
[53:48] necessarily with remembering where you
[53:50] came from
[53:51] why because that that can be a driving
[53:54] force to the believer
[53:56] i remember the time when i was in such
[53:58] depression i just wanted to
[53:59] i didn't want to talk to nobody i just
[54:01] if i had the courage i would have killed
[54:03] myself
[54:04] but i had too much knowledge of the
[54:06] truth to kill myself
[54:07] i was too scared to do that so i just
[54:10] shut myself
[54:10] up and just didn't want to talk to
[54:11] anybody for like three and a half four
[54:13] years
[54:13] just depressed just didn't care about
[54:15] nothing and then god came along my path
[54:18] and just like a like a father spanking a
[54:20] child
[54:21] said wake up it wasn't anything i did
[54:25] because i didn't even care about god
[54:27] anymore at that point
[54:29] there was something in me that still did
[54:31] don't get me wrong there was a seed
[54:32] still there
[54:33] but in my mind i had already written
[54:35] myself off
[54:36] but thank the lord jesus he didn't write
[54:38] me off
[54:40] and i'm here to tell you that you're
[54:42] part of this pride of jesus christ
[54:44] don't write yourself off because in this
[54:47] hour
[54:47] you're standing for the truth right now
[54:51] i just want to encourage you tonight
[54:53] because this is such an
[54:54] hour look at the look at the world
[54:56] around you everybody accusing everybody
[54:59] else of something
[55:01] everybody but why because iniquity shall
[55:03] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[55:07] and if we're not careful that starts to
[55:09] creep into the body
[55:11] of christ why could you rub his
[55:13] shoulders with the world a little too
[55:14] much
[55:14] we we see why because we have knowledge
[55:17] of this word
[55:18] we see when things aren't necessarily
[55:20] right
[55:22] and if we're not careful if the charity
[55:24] is not there
[55:26] charity covereth the sins charity will
[55:29] pray for the brother or sister
[55:31] but if we're not careful because
[55:32] iniquity is shallow bound the love of
[55:34] many shall acts cold
[55:36] and what happens the devil starts to
[55:38] make us forget
[55:39] that you were once in that situation
[55:41] that's you or what's purged from your
[55:42] old sins
[55:46] but thank to the lord jesus his blood
[55:48] covers it all
[55:50] his blood was enough
[55:53] the blood of jesus christ was enough and
[55:55] that's what i'm resting in
[55:57] is i'm resting in the blood of the lord
[55:59] jesus christ
[56:00] i'm resting in the atonement of calvary
[56:10] it's so easy to get caught up in our own
[56:13] shortcomings
[56:15] with much knowledge comes a lot of much
[56:17] sorrow
[56:18] and we got to know we have so much
[56:20] knowledge
[56:22] spirit good knowledge spiritual
[56:24] knowledge worldly knowledge
[56:26] but when we're not careful what does it
[56:28] do he starts to turn it into a law
[56:31] and as soon as that happens you start
[56:33] condemning yourself
[56:34] and as soon as that happens you've lost
[56:36] what the blood
[56:37] came here to do which was to free you
[56:40] from the law of sin and death
[56:42] and make you alive unto the unto god by
[56:44] the blood of jesus christ
[56:48] but the devil is out there throwing
[56:49] guilt around like candy
[56:52] make you feel guilty for this and feel
[56:54] guilty for that if you'll get you know
[56:55] what
[56:56] that there's nothing wrong with with uh
[56:57] with a conviction
[57:00] but it but the devil will steal away
[57:03] faith in that blood to cover that sin
[57:06] that's why you see people that just
[57:08] can't get over something in their past
[57:11] they just they're stuck on it because
[57:13] there's something there's somewhere the
[57:15] devil has lied to them
[57:17] that the blood will work for everything
[57:19] except that
[57:22] that they just we use the term forgive
[57:24] ourselves well we didn't forgive
[57:25] ourselves to begin with
[57:27] but we have to have enough faith to
[57:28] allow god to forgive us
[57:33] we've heard the story a pardon is not a
[57:35] pardon except that we received as a
[57:36] pardon
[57:38] if that be the case then lord just let
[57:41] me let me rest
[57:42] in your grace let me rest in his mercy
[57:48] you can look all through the scriptures
[57:49] and see there are so many people in the
[57:51] scriptures that had reason
[57:53] to count themselves out that could have
[57:56] just sat there
[57:57] and dwelt on all the failures we're not
[58:00] going to be long but
[58:01] i'm just going to go through a few of
[58:02] these think about think about this adam
[58:04] and eve think about the guilt
[58:06] that the devil could have held over
[58:07] their heads
[58:09] eve knowing that what she did caused the
[58:12] entire fall of humanity
[58:15] adam knowing willingly now he did it
[58:18] willingly
[58:20] but knowing that he caused it for
[58:22] himself
[58:23] could you imagine the conversations the
[58:25] great-great-grandchildren had with adam
[58:26] and eve
[58:28] oh it was like this before in the garden
[58:30] yeah but grandma eve what happened
[58:33] and then she'd have to tell them what
[58:35] happened
[58:36] what how we fell how we disobeyed the
[58:39] word of god
[58:40] how i allowed how i allowed the serpent
[58:42] to beguile me and tricked me into
[58:44] something
[58:47] think about that think about moses
[58:51] all the memories of his own mistakes
[58:53] that he had to have
[58:54] he grew up with the knowledge being a
[58:56] proper child a deliverer
[58:58] raised with that knowledge in the house
[59:00] of pharaoh
[59:02] and yet all he had to show for it was a
[59:03] dead egyptian and running away from his
[59:05] commission out in the wilderness for 40
[59:06] years
[59:08] from from a man who who would wage war
[59:12] for pharaoh and consider one of the
[59:14] greatest of the kingdom if not the
[59:15] greatest next to pharaoh
[59:17] to a man just hurting some sheep on the
[59:19] back side of the desert with a with a
[59:20] bounty on his head
[59:24] one one day he had thought i'm gonna be
[59:26] the deliverer
[59:28] sure of his calling but he didn't wait
[59:30] upon his ministry
[59:32] he didn't do it the way god had called
[59:34] him to do it and he fell flat on his
[59:36] face
[59:36] could you imagine the guilt
[59:40] and the shame knowing that i thought i
[59:44] thought i was going to be this great one
[59:46] i thought i was called to this purpose i
[59:48] was raised to know
[59:50] he could look back and hear the
[59:51] testimonies of his mother about the
[59:53] the in the in the reed bushes and how he
[59:56] was found as a babe and
[59:57] and raised up in the house of pharaoh
[59:59] even though he was
[1:00:00] even though he was a hebrew the miracles
[1:00:02] that happened around his life and yet
[1:00:04] he'd look and say but where am i
[1:00:06] how many of you ever felt like that
[1:00:09] think about joseph and all the trials he
[1:00:11] had to go through
[1:00:14] a prophet he knows his dreams are
[1:00:18] are true he sees these things favored
[1:00:21] living a good life and yet now he's sold
[1:00:22] into slavery
[1:00:26] oh it seems like things are on the
[1:00:27] upswing we're going good we're raised up
[1:00:29] into potiphar's house now
[1:00:30] and then chop down again
[1:00:33] what you and you know how the devil does
[1:00:36] even though he didn't do anything wrong
[1:00:38] you know the devil's right there and
[1:00:39] accuse him oh they were you did
[1:00:40] something you're a pride he
[1:00:42] you know he probably heard is the words
[1:00:43] of his his brothers you're just a
[1:00:45] prideful
[1:00:46] lifted up with all your dreams and stuff
[1:00:50] those are the kind of complexes the
[1:00:51] devil tries to put on us oh you're just
[1:00:53] you're just prideful you think you're
[1:00:55] something special because god called you
[1:00:57] his bride
[1:01:00] i can't i could imagine you know the
[1:01:02] roller coaster of emotions
[1:01:04] he would have had to have felt favored
[1:01:07] of his father coat of many colors down
[1:01:10] into a pit
[1:01:10] into it into a prison then raged up into
[1:01:14] potiphar's house
[1:01:15] and then cast back into prison and then
[1:01:18] rage back come up to the right hand of
[1:01:19] pharaoh
[1:01:21] think about david and his transgressions
[1:01:23] and his problems that he had
[1:01:26] called of god had the miracles that
[1:01:29] followed him with
[1:01:30] the slaying of goliath the slang of the
[1:01:32] lion the slaying of the bear
[1:01:33] these different things that happened the
[1:01:34] mighty works that he did
[1:01:36] and then he falls with bathsheba killed
[1:01:39] uriah
[1:01:41] and now he now he's being called out by
[1:01:42] his own prophet
[1:01:44] nathan he says you're the man the guilt
[1:01:47] that he had
[1:01:48] psalm 51 he talks about he says my sin
[1:01:51] was ever before my
[1:01:52] my face no doubt after
[1:01:55] god had called him he said i called you
[1:01:56] from the sheepfold
[1:01:58] i let i raised you up and you did this
[1:02:00] thing
[1:02:04] isn't that the devil what he does to us
[1:02:05] when we make our mistakes
[1:02:07] we've been called to this great calling
[1:02:09] and then we make a mistake and the
[1:02:10] devil's right there
[1:02:11] see one thing the devil's faithful at is
[1:02:14] to be of the accuser
[1:02:18] he'll he'll he'll let i remember i
[1:02:20] remember talking to brother david one
[1:02:21] time brother david junior and we were
[1:02:23] talking about how the lord will do
[1:02:24] things for you
[1:02:25] and it and you've been praying for
[1:02:26] something and the lord will even do a
[1:02:28] miracle
[1:02:29] yeah and as soon as the miracle's done
[1:02:31] the devil fought you the whole time
[1:02:32] there's no way god can do it there's no
[1:02:34] way god could do it and god does it
[1:02:36] and then as soon as it happens he flips
[1:02:38] right around and god didn't actually do
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:40] you didn't even see that that wasn't
[1:02:41] even real
[1:02:43] he's faithful as an accuser and he's
[1:02:46] faithful as a liar
[1:02:48] because he's the father of it you can
[1:02:50] trust that he's lying
[1:02:54] think about peter's failures
[1:02:58] i mean zealous for the lord no doubt but
[1:03:00] how many mistakes did he make
[1:03:03] it's cutting ears off lord lord jesus
[1:03:06] has to put it back on
[1:03:08] how many how many of us could have stood
[1:03:10] up to the lord jesus to our faith saying
[1:03:13] get thee behind me satan thou savor it's
[1:03:16] not the things that be of god
[1:03:20] i mean i know i know i'm a child of god
[1:03:22] so i would have gotten through it but
[1:03:23] that would have been rough
[1:03:25] and and i don't say that as a joke but
[1:03:26] if could you really put yourself in
[1:03:28] those shoes
[1:03:30] how he said lord you know i love you
[1:03:33] i'll i'll go wherever you go i'll die
[1:03:36] where you die
[1:03:37] says you'll betray me three times and
[1:03:39] then he does it and he knows he did it
[1:03:41] the shame that he had to feel do you you
[1:03:44] how much did he have to press
[1:03:46] to go to pentecost knowing
[1:03:49] that not only now i'm gonna you i mean
[1:03:52] i'm just
[1:03:52] tell i'm just being honest look at the
[1:03:55] way things are
[1:03:57] you don't think there are whispers going
[1:03:58] around amongst different disciples
[1:04:00] you know peter betrayed peter betrayed
[1:04:03] jesus
[1:04:04] ran away you know i heard him like i
[1:04:06] heard right before that
[1:04:08] jesus called him satan no revelation of
[1:04:11] what was really happening
[1:04:13] but that's how that's how the devil does
[1:04:14] it you could all testify that that's the
[1:04:17] truth
[1:04:18] but imagine the pressing that he had to
[1:04:20] do to go to just to go to pentecost
[1:04:23] oh my goodness think about paul and his
[1:04:26] persecution of the church
[1:04:28] raised up knew where he stood according
[1:04:30] to what he knew at the time
[1:04:32] according to the law dragging those in
[1:04:35] to be persecuted and then standing there
[1:04:37] at the stoning of stephen
[1:04:39] just yeah that's exactly what we need to
[1:04:40] do is stone that man
[1:04:43] imagine the guilt imagine and how many
[1:04:46] of us have been in those situations
[1:04:49] struggling with problems struggling with
[1:04:53] issues in your life it they may even be
[1:04:55] minor
[1:04:55] but see that that's that's what i love
[1:04:57] about the people of god is even the
[1:04:59] minor things to the people of god are
[1:05:00] important
[1:05:02] because when when a person's really been
[1:05:04] filled with the holy ghost
[1:05:05] every word of god matters every
[1:05:08] desire of jesus christ matters to the
[1:05:10] believer
[1:05:12] every jot and tittle means something to
[1:05:14] the believer
[1:05:16] not just like the denominational world
[1:05:17] that'll go out there and say well i'll
[1:05:19] accept this half of the word but i can
[1:05:21] get away with
[1:05:22] all the rest of it it doesn't matter
[1:05:23] about holiness that doesn't mean god
[1:05:24] doesn't care
[1:05:25] when the word says he does see but the
[1:05:28] people of god
[1:05:29] and the devil uses that against the
[1:05:31] people of god because we
[1:05:33] care and we desire perfection
[1:05:37] brother branham said it he said he said
[1:05:39] there's something in a believer that
[1:05:40] always
[1:05:41] desired perfection you can go look up
[1:05:43] that quote
[1:05:44] there's something in you that when you
[1:05:46] came to a knowledge of god
[1:05:49] of jesus christ and what he did for you
[1:05:51] and who you were
[1:05:52] that your desire in your heart is lord i
[1:05:55] want to live i want to live
[1:05:56] what you told abraham walk before me and
[1:05:58] be thou perfect
[1:06:00] that's the desire of the believer and
[1:06:02] the devil that
[1:06:04] trickster slicker that he is is right
[1:06:06] there
[1:06:07] to turn it around against you because we
[1:06:10] make mistakes
[1:06:11] because we fail abraham
[1:06:15] no doubt he had to look at it he even
[1:06:16] asked the lord he said lord
[1:06:18] you made me this promise but what about
[1:06:20] my child
[1:06:21] i still haven't had a child and one
[1:06:23] board of my house is eliezers gonna
[1:06:24] take it all he looked at ishmael said i
[1:06:28] tried that's what i got was a wild man
[1:06:32] how the devil would would attack
[1:06:35] the people of god yes sir
[1:06:40] that's the life that we're living that's
[1:06:43] the life
[1:06:44] that's the amnesia that the devil is
[1:06:46] trying to pull over your eyes the wool
[1:06:47] he's trying to put over your eyes
[1:06:49] is to make you forget
[1:06:52] but i could go through all these ones
[1:06:54] and i could just
[1:06:56] i can just imagine adam and eve telling
[1:06:59] that story to
[1:07:00] their great great grandchildren yeah
[1:07:03] grandma eve she messed it up but you
[1:07:06] know what god
[1:07:07] i will remember that god made a promise
[1:07:10] to us in that garden
[1:07:12] that my seed would step on the head of
[1:07:15] that serpent
[1:07:16] and then you know what he did he made us
[1:07:18] coats of skins
[1:07:19] and no doubt that revelation stirred up
[1:07:22] in him and said that there is coming a
[1:07:23] deliverer
[1:07:24] there's coming a savior that's going to
[1:07:27] bring us
[1:07:28] back to what we lost
[1:07:31] yes this is my infirmity but i will
[1:07:34] remember
[1:07:36] the days of the right arm of the most
[1:07:38] high
[1:07:39] what about moses walking back
[1:07:43] with that stick in his hand after the
[1:07:44] burning bush and the devil's right that
[1:07:46] you you know that dead egyptians here
[1:07:48] you know that bounty's still on your
[1:07:49] head
[1:07:49] they ain't forgot about it you know you
[1:07:52] failed
[1:07:52] it's 40 years too late moses he says
[1:07:56] yeah you know what i did mess up but i
[1:07:58] will remember
[1:08:00] i will remember what my mom taught me
[1:08:02] when i was younger
[1:08:03] yeah i may have messed it up i tried to
[1:08:05] fulfill it by my own desires
[1:08:07] but my own thoughts i tried to make it
[1:08:09] happen but there's a burning bush
[1:08:12] experience
[1:08:12] that i've had i will remember the voice
[1:08:16] that spoke to me out of the bush
[1:08:18] and said i am that i am i have heard the
[1:08:21] cries of my people
[1:08:22] and i have come down and i sent you
[1:08:30] joseph when no doubt he's in those
[1:08:32] trials
[1:08:33] thinking about what have i done to
[1:08:34] deserve this
[1:08:36] what have i done what did i do i
[1:08:39] i i just tried you know but there's
[1:08:41] something in him that said
[1:08:42] i will remember i will remember the
[1:08:46] dream
[1:08:46] that i was given that i was raised up
[1:08:49] for a purpose
[1:08:50] that might that my parents and my my
[1:08:53] brothers will come down and bow down to
[1:08:54] me one day
[1:08:56] and he had a revelation of it at the end
[1:08:58] god did this to preserve life
[1:09:00] god did this for a purpose the devil
[1:09:03] can't get anything over
[1:09:04] on a true believer because they can go
[1:09:07] back
[1:09:08] and say yes this is my infirmity these
[1:09:10] are my problems
[1:09:11] you could be honest with yourself but we
[1:09:13] got to get back
[1:09:15] to the word and say you know what devil
[1:09:17] that's right i got this problem i got
[1:09:19] financial
[1:09:20] issues i got health issues i got family
[1:09:22] issues
[1:09:23] i got all these problems the rapture
[1:09:25] looks a million miles off
[1:09:26] but i will remember the promise
[1:09:30] that god gave me when he sealed me with
[1:09:33] the holy ghost
[1:09:34] and he gave me a revelation of who he
[1:09:36] was
[1:09:40] that's the memorial that god has raised
[1:09:43] in your heart
[1:09:44] when he put that seal there and he put
[1:09:46] that memorial in your heart
[1:09:50] don't let the devil make you forget it
[1:09:53] don't let the devil draw you away from
[1:09:54] it
[1:09:58] what about david he says nathan says
[1:10:01] you're the man.
[1:10:03] psalm 51.
[1:10:08] i'll just read it real quick it's not a
[1:10:11] long one
[1:10:26] says have mercy upon me oh god according
[1:10:28] to that loving kindness
[1:10:29] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:10:31] tender mercies blot out my
[1:10:32] transgressions
[1:10:33] wash me thoroughly for mine iniquities
[1:10:35] and cleanse me from my sin
[1:10:37] for i acknowledge my transgressions and
[1:10:39] my sin is ever before me
[1:10:41] against thee the only have i sinned and
[1:10:43] done this evil in thy sight
[1:10:45] that thou mayest be justified when thou
[1:10:47] speakest and be clear without judges
[1:10:48] behold i was shaping in iniquity
[1:10:50] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:10:52] behold thou desirous truth in the inward
[1:10:54] parts and in the hidden part
[1:10:56] thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge
[1:10:58] me with hyssop and i shall be clean
[1:11:00] wash me and i shall be whiter than snow
[1:11:03] make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:11:05] that the bones which thou has broken may
[1:11:07] rejoice
[1:11:08] hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[1:11:10] all mine iniquities created me a clean
[1:11:12] heart oh god and renew a right spirit in
[1:11:14] me how many of you felt like that
[1:11:16] say lord sometimes i just need i need i
[1:11:18] need to renewal of that spirit in me
[1:11:22] amen i know that i'm in need of that all
[1:11:24] the time
[1:11:25] lord renew a right spirit of me bring me
[1:11:28] closer into your presence
[1:11:29] bring me more in love with you
[1:11:32] renew a right spirit in me cast me not
[1:11:35] away from thy presence and take not thy
[1:11:37] holy spirit from me
[1:11:38] he said he'd never leave you nor forsake
[1:11:40] you restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:11:43] salvation
[1:11:44] and uphold me with thy free spirit
[1:11:47] amen no doubt david going through all
[1:11:50] these trials
[1:11:51] he had been cast out even by his son
[1:11:53] absalom had to had to reap what he sowed
[1:11:55] had to go through some struggles and
[1:11:57] some trials but no doubt
[1:11:58] he could come back and say this is these
[1:12:00] are my problems this is my infirmity is
[1:12:03] psalm 77 says
[1:12:04] it says verse 10 and psalm 77 and i said
[1:12:08] this is my infirmity
[1:12:09] but i will remember the years of the
[1:12:12] right hand
[1:12:13] of the most high you know who the right
[1:12:15] hand is right that's jesus christ
[1:12:17] that's gene i will remember the years of
[1:12:20] jesus christ
[1:12:21] i will remember what jesus christ has
[1:12:23] done for me
[1:12:27] no doubt david could go back into maybe
[1:12:29] some of the psalms he had written and
[1:12:30] said
[1:12:31] i will remember that thy mercy endureth
[1:12:34] forever
[1:12:35] i will remember that though i walk
[1:12:37] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:12:39] death
[1:12:39] i won't fear any evil i will remember
[1:12:42] how you delivered me out of the hand of
[1:12:44] the lion how you delivered me out of the
[1:12:46] hand of the bear
[1:12:47] and out of the hand of goliath and out
[1:12:49] of the hand of saul
[1:12:50] and all of these things and he could go
[1:12:53] forth
[1:12:54] with confidence what about peter
[1:12:59] peter could go out and say yeah these
[1:13:03] this is what i done i did all these
[1:13:06] things it's true i denied him
[1:13:08] he rebuked me to my face all these
[1:13:10] things happened no doubt
[1:13:12] but i could remember when he told me
[1:13:14] that day
[1:13:15] you're simon son of jonas i can remember
[1:13:19] when he said flesh and blood has not
[1:13:20] revealed this to you
[1:13:21] but my father which is in heaven and
[1:13:23] upon this rock i shall build my church
[1:13:25] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:13:27] against it
[1:13:29] i could remember when he said when thou
[1:13:32] art converted
[1:13:33] strengthen your brethren and he could
[1:13:36] press
[1:13:37] to the day of pentecost and then he
[1:13:39] could come back
[1:13:40] and second peter and tell you even
[1:13:42] though you know these things
[1:13:43] i'm gonna keep you always in remembrance
[1:13:45] of them
[1:13:47] i'm going to renew your minds i'm going
[1:13:49] to stir up your minds my way of
[1:13:51] remembrance
[1:13:52] i'm not going to let the devil put that
[1:13:54] veil over your eyes to make you forget
[1:13:56] what he's done for you
[1:14:00] and then paul paul could just
[1:14:04] even you could even read in the
[1:14:05] scriptures how he never quite forgot
[1:14:08] he didn't let it stop him but he didn't
[1:14:10] forget
[1:14:12] he said i'm the least of the apostles
[1:14:14] that persecuted the church
[1:14:17] he let it drive him he let it be
[1:14:19] something behind him that said lord
[1:14:21] i know what i was and i know what you
[1:14:23] made me amen
[1:14:24] and i thank you lord jesus because you
[1:14:26] took me from that
[1:14:27] i'm never stopping i press towards the
[1:14:29] mark of the high colony
[1:14:31] i'm going to keep going no doubt he can
[1:14:33] say yeah i persecuted the church
[1:14:35] i was there at the stoning of stephen
[1:14:37] but i was also there on the road to
[1:14:38] damascus
[1:14:40] when he cried out from the light and say
[1:14:42] paul paul
[1:14:44] so so why persecute us thou me
[1:14:48] i was there when i was prayed over and
[1:14:52] the scales fell from my eyes
[1:14:54] and i received the holy ghost that
[1:14:56] you've also received
[1:14:59] and the blood of jesus christ was so
[1:15:01] powerful that the brethren in jerusalem
[1:15:03] just reached out their hands and gave
[1:15:05] him and barnabas the right hands of
[1:15:06] fellowship
[1:15:07] and say you're just one of us too that's
[1:15:09] what the blood of jesus christ will do
[1:15:14] think it just says well we'll just close
[1:15:18] here in a minute
[1:15:19] and then i think about samson i'll just
[1:15:21] go back to that because he's such a
[1:15:24] powerful character think about
[1:15:28] grinding in the mill thinking about the
[1:15:31] failures that he done i delivered
[1:15:33] i delivered israel i put the gates of
[1:15:36] the gates of the enemy on my back and
[1:15:38] carried them up the mountain
[1:15:40] i i with the jawbone of a
[1:15:44] a mew-i'd slain a thousand philistines
[1:15:47] and now here i'm grinding in the middle
[1:15:48] and the devil's right there yeah you're
[1:15:50] a complete failure
[1:15:52] you're just going around in circles now
[1:15:54] we've all been there at some points no
[1:15:56] doubt
[1:15:57] just like israel around that mountain
[1:15:59] around that mountain around that
[1:16:01] mountain
[1:16:02] but there's a time that came for samson
[1:16:07] brother braham said he could feel those
[1:16:09] locks growing back
[1:16:11] there was a reminder of the covenant
[1:16:14] that he had
[1:16:16] we've had a reminder in this day we've
[1:16:19] had a reminder in this day of the
[1:16:20] covenant that we have
[1:16:22] amen from the foundation of the world a
[1:16:24] covenant that an unbreakable covenant
[1:16:26] that was given unto
[1:16:27] the bride of jesus christ he knows them
[1:16:30] that are his
[1:16:32] and samson can say yes this is my
[1:16:34] infirmity i can't see
[1:16:36] i i don't i don't have maybe the
[1:16:38] abilities that i thought i had before
[1:16:41] but i'll remember the covenant that god
[1:16:43] gave to me
[1:16:44] i can remember my mom my mother and
[1:16:46] father telling me of the covenant that
[1:16:48] was made
[1:16:49] i can remember the the victories that
[1:16:52] were won
[1:16:54] and just like we all need to do we need
[1:16:56] to be like samson and say hey if i have
[1:16:58] to die with my enemies
[1:17:00] we got to die if you want to get that
[1:17:02] victory you got to die
[1:17:04] your desires have to die your will has
[1:17:06] to die
[1:17:07] and sampson said you know what let me
[1:17:09] die with my enemy
[1:17:11] and he slew more in his death than he
[1:17:14] did in his life
[1:17:15] and so is it with the children of god
[1:17:17] you'll slay more
[1:17:19] once you're dead to yourself you will do
[1:17:21] more for god
[1:17:23] when you're finally dead to yourself
[1:17:26] than you ever could have done on your
[1:17:27] own strength
[1:17:30] just in an instant too it just took an
[1:17:33] instant just one
[1:17:34] push now i want you to think
[1:17:37] brother branham tells the story just as
[1:17:40] we close here
[1:17:42] of the the one with amnesia and how he
[1:17:45] got off
[1:17:47] got off the the train and just started
[1:17:50] walking around
[1:17:54] and what does he see he sees just this
[1:17:56] path
[1:17:57] that just seems kind of familiar can't
[1:18:00] put your finger on it
[1:18:02] but there's something that i know this
[1:18:06] that's what the believer is if you found
[1:18:09] yourself
[1:18:10] in a place where you just don't seem
[1:18:14] to know that you know
[1:18:17] or maybe the devil's tried to put a
[1:18:18] little blackness on there to try to
[1:18:20] give you some amnesia you know what you
[1:18:22] got to do because where was the
[1:18:24] where was that boy coming off the train
[1:18:26] where he was going he was home
[1:18:28] we got to go home we got to go back to
[1:18:30] the word
[1:18:32] when you find yourself in that amnesia
[1:18:34] just go back to the word
[1:18:38] go back into prayer go back into the
[1:18:39] word go back to your home
[1:18:42] and you'll find that all of a sudden
[1:18:44] it'll start to feel real familiar to you
[1:18:47] he said wow that was that's me
[1:18:50] i i i've had those struggles and god
[1:18:52] delivered me just like you delivered
[1:18:53] them
[1:18:55] and pretty soon you're going to find
[1:18:56] yourself walking
[1:18:58] see that water tower oh i remember that
[1:19:00] and you just keep going and going and
[1:19:01] before you know it
[1:19:02] there's your heavenly father right at
[1:19:04] the end of the line saying i knew you
[1:19:05] were coming back
[1:19:07] i knew you were there i saw that's why
[1:19:09] we just sang that song at the beginning
[1:19:11] it said around that next turn in the
[1:19:12] road i see king jesus and
[1:19:14] that's just what that boy did he walked
[1:19:16] around that next turn he saw that house
[1:19:18] and saw his father on the stoop and his
[1:19:21] father was just waiting for him
[1:19:23] he said around that next turn of the
[1:19:25] road i see king jesus coming for me
[1:19:28] i know i knew you were coming back
[1:19:32] and that's what the lord that's all the
[1:19:34] lord's doing right now he just
[1:19:36] come back to the word just come back and
[1:19:38] keep pressing into it
[1:19:40] and the scales will fall off see there's
[1:19:43] no problem with admitting the infirmity
[1:19:46] but go to the end of it say i will
[1:19:48] remember as we'd all stand
[1:19:53] i will remember my lord jesus christ and
[1:19:56] what he did for me
[1:19:58] you know the devil
[1:20:02] he's got us so
[1:20:06] he's got a so he's so good at preaching
[1:20:09] to us
[1:20:10] about our past i think it's time that
[1:20:13] the children of god started preaching to
[1:20:14] him about his future
[1:20:17] about where he is right now even he's
[1:20:19] under your feet
[1:20:22] you got to preach to that devil preach
[1:20:24] them the word
[1:20:26] say i will remember thus saith the lord
[1:20:31] i will never leave you nor forsake you i
[1:20:34] am the god that healeth all thy diseases
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:41] let's just power hands in the word of
[1:20:44] prayer
[1:20:46] lord jesus we just love you so much oh

[1:20:49] love and your mercy lord your lord your
[1:20:52] mercies and earth forever oh god

[1:20:57] and just lord if we would confess our
[1:20:59] sins you're faithful and just to forgive
[1:21:00] us of our sins and to cleanse us of all
[1:21:01] unrighteousness lord
[1:21:04] lord in so many times the devil is just
[1:21:06] right there to try to show us
[1:21:08] all of our mistakes and our shortcomings
[1:21:10] lord but your word said though a
[1:21:11] righteous man falls
[1:21:13] seven times he gets up lord and we're
[1:21:16] just gonna press forward lord in your
[1:21:18] promises
[1:21:19] lord we're not gonna look at ourselves
[1:21:21] lord but we're gonna look
[1:21:22] towards the promise oh god just as our
[1:21:25] our father abraham did lord just as
[1:21:27] the different ones that we even spoke
[1:21:29] about this evening oh god that that
[1:21:32] surely they could see their own faults
[1:21:33] and failures but lord they were looking
[1:21:35] to a promise
[1:21:37] lord we're looking to your promises
[1:21:38] right now god may you just draw us
[1:21:41] closer into your presence oh lord may
[1:21:42] you just
[1:21:43] if they're lord i believe that lord even
[1:21:45] now we've come here lord you've already
[1:21:47] lifted the amnesia off of us oh god
[1:21:49] but if there be any fog left over if
[1:21:51] there be any any missed lord that would
[1:21:54] try to come and try to try to block out
[1:21:57] the light of this gospel to us oh god
[1:21:58] may you just
[1:22:00] lord by your power just lift it lord
[1:22:02] maybe just take away all the blinders
[1:22:05] all the doubts and frustrations that the
[1:22:07] world tries to keep on us lord and may
[1:22:10] we just rest in your promises right now
[1:22:11] oh god
[1:22:13] we thank you lord for your love and your
[1:22:15] mercy we thank you for the promises lord
[1:22:17] because they're
[1:22:18] yea and amen lord and we accept them

[1:22:24] blood lord we're trusting in that lord
[1:22:27] we thank you for the word that you've

[1:22:32] just pressing forward in it we thank you
[1:22:34] lord now

[1:23:17] that's only for that's only for for you
