rod and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand

the youth that are not married do not fail to come I'd like you to come and we have a meeting that is on Wednesday during service time at 5 p.m is that understood because if I push it to the other week and after th Wednesday it will be the convention amen amen so this morning I'm speaking to you on that which we read let us just rehear it a bit to remind ourselves and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hecken unto my voice for they will say the Lord has not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in th hand so many of you who know the story uh this is when uh God had come down to call Moses Moses had spent 40 years under the training in of um the Palace of pharaoh and he was being trained to become or the next fellow we and for 40 years he had tried his best to learn his best to be his best to fulfill his life's Ambitions his mother raised him up telling him that you are born for a purpose you are going to serve our people and so Moses grew up knowing very well that he was going to his people but time came when Moses became of age and then he went back to the Palace of pharaoh but the Bible then would also say he esteemed um uh the reproach he decided to leave all the goodness and everything that was in the palace and he decided to identify himself with his people his people the uh the the Israelites course they were living in Gan and U and they were like slaves and he was up here in a good life but he decided instead of identifying himself with pharaoh and the Egyptians he decided to identify himself with the outcast thees because he realized he was one of them are you following me so now Moses reached a time and um he you know went away from the palace and one day he's out there in the in in the in the field and um you know one of the Egyptians was um beating the the israelit and trying to make him work and when Moses saw that he felt so bad he felt so bad he said this is one of my own how come that this man you know beat him up so he took matters in his own hands and he went and squeezed this man squeezed him because of love for for his people and the calling upon his life do you know you can actually be called by God and you have responded to that call but mentally you have answered the call in your mind but not in your heart you cannot respond to that call in your heart before you meet God each of us has to meet God are you hearing me Church each of us has to have a personal experience with God there's one thing that you hear the preacher tell and you you know you read and you know and you know someone you know people would come and tell me I know everything listen Church it is not about knowing everything did you know the devil knows more than you tell your neighbor the devil knows more than you can you imagine that the Bible says we believe in one God the devil also believes and he doesn't even only believe but he also trembles after so he believes the devil believes everything you believe the devil knows everything you know more he was in the presence of God in heaven more than any of us none of us has been so much in his presence more than the think about that the devil is more experienced in the presence of God more than any professing believer but even with that he was not changed he knows so much but he was not Chang if the devil had a heart his heart was far from God but one thing about demons and devil they don't they can't repent and they can't be forgiven even even if they did that the Bible says when they fell from their first estate fail once forever they cannot be redeemed but human being we are not meant to fall and remain Fallen human beings have souls and there are human beings who were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world those even when they fall they cannot remain Fallen because within them is a seed which can never die this the people that I'm talking about you know even God himself cannot leave them to perish those are the ones he died for because he knew there was no other way for them to be saved without his action if you think about yourself and you think about your life you can sincerely say without his death on the cross I would be lost I would be gone and I'm so glad that he died on the cross he made a way where there was no way he has given an entrance where there was a blocked entrance because after man had seen in the then he says put two Cher to watch The Way of the tree of life the way was blocked the way was blocked but there come a man and his name is Jesus he said I am the way amen anybody who comes to me amen can go to the father so in other words the way is Jesus the way is the word the more of the word you get in the more of the word is revealed to you in your heart amen an entrance is being ministered to you and the day you have an encounter with the Holy Spirit and you are filled with the power of the Holy Spirit you have permanent access are you following me now okay I have a lot to speak so I and I don't want to be long because I'm tired and you some of you are tired so you pray for me that we will just share something small but something edified how many are praying for me all right by the way let me let me teach this because sometimes you hear preachers talking about that he's preaching and he's saying are you praying so why is does he want me to pray right now yes let me teach you Dev whenever the word is going listen to it prayerfully don't that's why some of you does because your spirit is sleeping you should not sleep when you are hearing the word so when you're hearing the word don't just hear and in your spirit you're thinking about other open all channels open all all all you know preach the inside of the inside you know the doors in a door open all the doors of your so when a preacher is preaching in prayer oh God speak to me God him God Inspire him and and then your prayer will begin to change as God is begin to minister and then you begin to communicate with him directly say Lord I receive that Lord I receive that Lord may you put it upon my life may you practice that and you will watch what will happen in your life amen I believe in people praying while they're hear okay so we see here that Moses um um you know he had left his people the is the he had left the Egyptians brother and gone to his people and um and so they he tried to take matters in his own hand but he had never had an encounter with the Holy Spirit we have so many believers who have never had an encounter with the Holy Spirit and these have been the greatest hindrance to the gospel he's a Believer but he has never met the Holy Spirit he has never been baptized into the Holy Spirit he has never had an experience he doesn't know what it is he has even never cried in the spirit he has even never you know um prayed in the spirit he doesn't know spiritual things he's a spiritual baby may God not allow it for you to remain consistently a spiritual baby may you grow in the things of God may you grow deeper into the things of amen and so was a good man but Moses did not know what it is to be in the presence of God he had never had one encounter so he knew the word but he was exercising the word can and that's why he killed that man he killed him and buried him in and when one time one man told him don't you think I know what you did I will tell Pharaoh praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the lord it's a very good sign of someone who does not have the Holy Spirit you do things mechanically you do things manually and then you bu stuff why no Holy Spirit not converted not chained but a Believer that's Howes was in that state how many are like that I don't know how many like that like Moses a brother a Believer but Bing a lot of and is when no one realizes he's very okay but when they find out he's fearing for his and when he found out find someone knows the only thing he could think about was to run away and he R but the problem why many Believers are still running is because they don't have an encounter with they are not yet filled with the Holy Spirit you can't serve God anywhere there's nothing you are doing for the Lord you are running you are running why you are not even attending Services why because you are not filled with the holy spirit let me tell you when you receive the Holy Spirit you receive a thirst for the things of God you receive a hunger whereby you always want more always you want more of when others are saying the service was too long and so you are saying why did the pastor for a few minutes why because you want more is not your flesh pulling for it it is your soul pulling for it amen because a soul that is filled with the spirit of God desires for more of God amen you know that's how Moses was Moses was dry he did not have that encounter and so he ran and went away into the land of Midian and when he reached there he found a priest there and he married a woman of this priest of this priest and uh then you know I don't know how they discuss but eventually he also becomes a worker of his father-in-law and he was hiding his ship and so I don't know how he was being paid but that was the arrangement and he did it for a long time 40 good years 40 years had in the ship of his and one time Moses is working with his Ro in his hand and you know it's just just like any day it could be today like you are you've come to church like any day like any Sunday but may something happen to you today that like that what happened to Moses Moses was just walking just normally and with his sheep and the Bible says he saw a bush which was having some fire in burning so Moses was attracted so he walked towards that burning Moses a man who has hid his sins for more than 40 years Moses a man who has thought is a failure for more than 40 years Moses a man who thought he had run away from the purpose of his life he knew it very well he knew what God had called him to do but he was he knew he was running away because listen listen because he did not have know that God wants me to do this but I don't have the ability I don't have the anointing to fulfill that how many of you are like that tonight let me remove my court and I preach to you very well amen the who went to don't don't almost slept for one hour but I see others are very I don't want anybody to be feel sleep it means somebody near you is soon sleeping praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah that's 10% hallelujah hallelujah all right that's good now so now Moses came to this place and um when he s he saw this Burning Bush he realized that he he is a sinful man he had run away from the purpose of God for his he knew no way he could be able to accomplish it when he was young and stronger he thought himself powerful and he tried to do it with his own strength and then when he failed he decided to give up pefully and he ran away and he went and retired himself in a far land and he he even married a woman according to the word at that time he was not even supposed to marry so Moses was now weak Moses was old Moses was tired Moses had covered a lot of things he fear to go back in his past because there were many things in his past which were disorganized but you see as he approach this uh uh burning bush a voice came out of it and he said Moses approach no father remove your shoes for the ground you're standing on is Holy Ground you know that place where you meet God Amen that time when you meet God is a Holy Ground Hallelujah and when you meet God unveils everything about life he shows you all your weakness way did you know when you come before the presence of God he reveals everything about you what you thought no one knows God uncovers it that's why during the preaching many many times you know I've seen it many times there was one time we were in a convention you know and the word was preached and the the presence of God came down and you know someone ran ran like a Bo and came on the Altar and said pastor pray for me I am a Sina I am a back slider they began confessing things that I never knew I didn't know that person we had almost 1,200 people at the convention that person never met me but maybe saw me for the first time but what made them talk those things because of the presence of God and that person began vomiting a lot of stuff and I tell you he left that that that actually she was a lady she left that place when she was renewed amen and when when the presence of God comes down don't always hold your secrets God always hold your life amen accept to be naked in his presence so that he can take you and make something out of you I remember there was a time in the service here several time things have happened like and people begin to confess things well of course we meet them after the service be able to give them counseling and all that what I'm saying friends knowing god is one thing meeting God is another the problem we have in the message we have a lot of people who know God they know about him because they know baptis him in Jesus name they know a woman should dress this way they know a man should dress that way they know they make kindness of the message but they have never met God friends I want you to be like Moses I want you to have a hunger I want you to have a thirst if you have never met God to make it a point say I want to meet God I don't want to remain like this I want to meet God because if you meet God brother something will happen you will be changed amen if you ever had an addiction that was very dark and difficult the only solution is to meet God when you meet God one time sister you cannot be the same anymore we have had so many people who make resolutions many times at the end of the year and the beginning of another or maybe after H someone someone begin saying I'm making my from today but you see they go back again into the same thing why because you're doing it the wrong way the wrong way is to think that you are the one with a solution you have no solution God is the solution what you need brother what you need sister is to meet God when that moment comes upon you when that presence comes upon you instead of making resolutions instead of doing that what you should do you should yield yourself and say God I'm here you have arrested Me Now work on me now F me now change me now do something that my pastor cannot do do something my mother my father my sister my brother cannot do if the things I was telling you have not happened before then I don't need to tell it to you but if it has happened before and God literally changed people then I I have a right to tell them to you let me tell you an Open Secret I'm one of the people that God [Applause] changed if you go back in my life 25 years ago you realize this is another person God did something in my life I met God I met God how many have ever met God if you have ever met God lift up your hand these are other testimonies you've met God and something happened and you know from that moment now I'm a changed man now I'm a changed woman does God still do those things does God still forgive sins does God still filled with the Holy Spirit you know you have many people who decide to to fix salvation you know is because they're trying it on their own but when Moses he was trying to fake it the whole time but in the presence of God in this Pillar of Fire in the burning bush he God told him I'm going to send you he said I will not go because how will these people believe me imagine if God called you and he says he's going to send you and you know what you have been doing and you know your life are God how would this people believe did you know brother martin preached on the power of a call you know that each of you has a call and when that when you hear that call from the Holy Spirit you have to respond if you don't respond to that call you can never have peace in your life because we are born the purpose God made us for I have a purpose in my life my purpose is to preach the goel I found it out I could do business and become a great business I could become a teacher I could become an actor I I could become an IT specialist all these things I'm telling you I thought at one time to do because I heard and I have the ability to do them are you hearing me church but one day I had the call of God upon my life and when I had that call I responded with everything in me there is a power in the call when you respond to that call there is something that God does in realigning and rearranging your life to fit his call upon your life but you see many people like Moses run away from their and here when he met God he told God people will not believe me they will not even hear my voice they would say when they would say uh when the Lord to the Lord has not appeared to you but the Lord answered him what is that in thine hand ask your neighbor what is that in th hand hallelujah sister Monica what is that in don't tell me a book there is something in your hand there is something in your hand I I hope someone is receiving Revelation now each of you is born with something in your hand and that thing which you have in your hand is what will be a conduit for God to help you in answering your call it is the thing that God will use toonize against your enemy this thing you have it before you even realize it and you God has given it to you before you were even born in other words we have all the weapons we need overcome all our enemies the only thing is we don't know but God asked Moses what is that in th hand let us go back a little bit before Moses came to the to the Burning Bush experence Moses as I told you had some deals with his father-in-law and his deal was to be a shepherd and as a shepherd He thought as a shepherd He needed this road so he went in the this desert and acquired a road is there any here I I I had my good old I don't know who took it you know you know those kind of I wish I had one and I came with it here I like demonstrating things physically and so Moses had his own con and this road he had you know made it properly for the purpose of Harding ship and so he had it the whole time and he had had it maybe for 40 years these roads can really last long because they dry up and you can have it for a long long time so Moses had his and when he came before God and you know he was blabbering words I don't know how they will believe me how would they know that I've met you the only thing said he said what is that in I believe the holy spirit is asking us the same what is that in th hand Moses had been a total failure and I'm reading a quote here in a message what is that in your hand Moses had been a total failure may be men here this morning this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total failures okay I'm not going to ask you to raise up your hand but I'm going to ask you this how many here this morning can say I am a total failure Pastor as you're preaching you're talking about I am fail all right this is yours listen to maybe there have been they're here and they have been total failures when it comes to school fees you are a failure when it comes to knowledge in class you are a failure totally you're saying I'm a failure when it comes to living the life of of God you are a total failure even when you try you fail before you decide to try say you I'm a total failure even when I try to pray maybe I have some people here this morning that are total failures in prayer total failures don't worry mes like that and I'm here to preach to you this morning when it comes to moral life moral life total failure when it comes to you know having something in your pocket total failure and he says maybe you have been as a housewi ailure someone feels me I'm a housewife but I am a total failure maybe you been as a student at school but you feel like I'm a total failure maybe you've been as a child to your parents but you are here while I'm talking you are saying I am a failure to my parents are you hearing me this morning you are saying I am a whatever you have been let that be has been let whatever you have been a failure Let It Be has been let it become right now has been and I want to say start from today amen when Moses came in that presence whatever he thought he was it became has been put these things correctly uh rather properly in some words here that I I thought I should read for you it says the serpent in biblical symbolism often represents evil Temptation and sin I seen in the story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis however in this context are you following me brother Wang yes sir just follow me closely here the serpent is transformed you need to understand what I'm saying before you interpret it for the people if you don't understand it you ask me again and then you interpret it all right says however in this context the serpent is transformed from a symbol of danger and treachery into a sign of God's power and authority so now we all know that when even some when I dream sin when I dream a snake oh it means sin yes we know that we associate serpent with sin but in this case of Moses god transformed the whole thing and he was Now using this serpent as a symbol of God's power and authority it says this transformation serves as a powerful image of God's ability to turn evil into good and he and to use the seemingly Mund and ordinary for his Divine purposes [Music] did you hear that God has the ability of turning evil into good God has the ability of turning evil into good that is why the Bible tells us all things work together for good to those that are called of God those that are called according to his purpose he said all things work together for good he didn't say some things he said all things he he didn't say the good things he said all things that includes the bad the good the evil the ugly whatever it is that has happened in your life he said all things happen together for good to those that love God and Accord according to his power God has a way of turning an ability of turning evil into good you just simply need to have a re to understand how God works God works in his own ways God works in ways we can never imag he can turn the things that have happened to you in your life amen from Evil and he can turn it into good are you following me now I want to show you here some examples here was Jonah and God told Jonah go to n and want these people of my of the incoming danger I'm going to destroy all of them and what did Jonah do Jonah decided to go to T reason God Is So merciful he he he he he said ah God I know you I know you very well I've served you for a long time you want me to go to n and tell these people th say the Lord is going to burn you with fire and then you forgive them these people will call me a false Propet they may even end up killing me so dear God I am not going he decided to go to do you know what happened on his way you know you know the storm comes who brought the storm God brought the stor or do you think it was the devil all things work together where was God when Jonah was deciding to go the opposite why didn't God turn all things work together for good and then at that moment God leaves Jonah because God is longsuffering you know technology sence wants to mimic God I've realized many times if you're using Google Maps and you tell the Google Maps that you going to a certain direction it will show you that this is the best roof until you begin driving if you miss the turn it do not tell you go back it will tell you okay now okay now let let me show you another and then he will show finally you end up on that Destin the problem is with that is if you missed the turn it was telling you at first you may reach a ditch and it is telling you there is a way there and because according to the way it has counted everything it is impossible to and you reach the destination and then you be like no Google Map doesn't work because it takes you into ditches God bless you brother Peter I heard you complaining that Google Maps take takes you to ditches if Google Map takes you into ditches it simply means you don't know how to use it because you have pass the turn tell you in 70 M turn left and then when you reach there you pass is the road and then you reach somewhere it will relocate you and then it will tell you okay in one kilom turn left so in one kilm you will Begin Again turning left okay this is the and then you will continue you somewhere and Google Map will tell you turn right and right there are people's homes there is no Road and then you begin wondering what is wrong with Google Map Google Map has no problem gole the problem is with you you keep missing the turn and that's why we suffer things we suffer God has set a path for us but we we turn it down and then he leaves us but because he loves us because he has Grace upon us he will never lose us and because he never loses us somehow we end up in the right [Music] destination but I can tell you this brother there is a difference between someone who arrives with with no bruise and someone who arrives with a lot of bruises over I want to arrive without any wound on my body I want to arrive amen as perfect as he saw me you see Jonah when he left that path God was quiet and then he reached on on this bo b and everybody began casting lots Mr Man what have you done I'm running away from I'm the problem okay now cast me down into the now he suffered now being thrown into the SE then he fell in there and the fish was ready open his mouth and swallowed him and Jonah was in the B of the man prayed there are some prayers you pray because you made yourself pres you left the perfect will of brother if you stay in the path that God has laid for you there are some prayers you will never pray but when you dodge the path of God you will pray prayers you will you will never meant to pray I've often seen people who are walking in the perfect will of God for their life they tell things happen in my life I never force it it just happens and they think God loves them so much loves everybody it happens for you that way because you are walking in the path he has laid for you and then Jonah reached there he began pray praying all the prayers in you he prayed in all the tongues in you God remember me oh God served you oh God turn this thing that I in turn it around and let Miracle happen he prayed and swe and prayed and he prayed and I wonder in the bellies in the belly of the fish I don't know how he was even breathing it was God who preserved him sometimes you've been in some Tom and you wonder someone when they hear where you were they wonder how did you even survive it was the grace of God that preserved the long suffering of God and he preserved you there because you were SE and then came out Jonah you know God began to hear the prayers of Jonah you know that's why I love Mah Mah you know said Rejoice not against me or my when I when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me when I fall down I shall arise when a righteous falls down he rises up when a writer sins he repents are you hearing me church and that's what Mah said because he had a revelation even of what happened to Jonah and Jonah in that in the belly of the fish was praying and praying and praying until God commanded the fish fish is time for you to move did you know the fish was down in the depth of the sea for three days in the same place it was waiting for the order brother before we continue don't fall into the fish you are not supposed to fall into just go in the sheep and go where Hallelujah but if you Happ to fall into the fish you have to be sincere before God you have to be prayerful you have to yield yourself you have to give yourself don't don't say I think God is just forgiven me don't presume be sincere be a sincere believer come before God heartedly and this man as he was there God now said okay the fish it's time for you to wake up begin going to n and the fish began moving and it moved anded in N in N God told it all right fish now vomit the you know the people of n believed in a fish God called so when they saw a big fish sent us a every one of them started repenting and crying and coming back to God and the whole city of n was forgiven what Jonah feared still happen because it was the will of God and then the scriptures fulfill to those who love God and are the Cod according to his purpose so God has a way of turning evil to good that was evil that was Disobedience but it turned it to good and this stuff okay iue here he says and um the act of reaching out and seizing the Serpent's tail also symbolizes faith and obedience and Trust in God's plan tell your neighbor trust in God's plan for your life the fact that Moses follows God's instructions without hesitation this demonstrates his willingness to submit to God's Authority and Trust in his power father more this verse also highlights the concept of transformation and renewal he can reap your life amen you might have been born a certain way that's why I don't believe those people who say well I was born this way I'm remaining that I believe the first part I Was Born This Way But whichever way you were born God can reshape your he can re the natural order of things you were born a liar a good liar but if you're born again God will reshape your natural order hallelujah amen you were born Immortal you were born a dece you know like like Jacob Jacob was a man he was a supp he was a bad man you understand what I'm talking about but Jacob after all his past experience he had also stolen something from his father from his brother and he even feared to go back again to his brother because he feared his brother would kill him Brother Joseph do you know what happened one time the Bible tells us that when he he had decided to go back to his father's house he began sending people and things to go and bribe his brother still a bad man Believers don't pay bribe he was going to bribe his brother so he can feel better than forgiv again he sent another group he was sending them in phases so that by the time he arrives his brother will be appeased as he was going on up he met somebody he was looking like a man he was not a man he was looking like an angel but he was not an angel but Jacob had a revelation of it was whoever this was he was more than a man and when Jacob met him at first he was so much in fear thinking I think it is my brother he has come to kill me he has come so he was in so much fear but the moment he was just going around come here brother Brian brother Bri the moment he was going around and he realized someone was following him someone was following him and then come on come on follow me and then as he just did like this his heart was pouncing and as he turned he realized it is not his brother but it is someone who had ability to bless he realized it was someone more than a man and he was in the in the presence of this creature creator not creature Creator amen and he held they held each other and they began brother is and Jacob said no I'm not going to leave you I'm going I'm not going to leave you until you bless me until you bless me and the Bible says they F the whole night they F the whole and Jacob got a hold of the knee he said okay if and the angel said leave me the day is coming leave my knee saiding you and his knee too was being squeezed and F night and finally he said okay before he let go before he let go he began speaking all right from today you are no longer ja said okay continue I'm not leaving you okay okay from today I'm calling you Israel I'm changing your name he said continue said okay you going to be a peace with God he said okay that sound that sound nice God bless you what happened there brother it was the encounter I was talking about when God comes in your Plain View he changes and reorders events in your life he reshapes the natural and Jacob from that day his name was no longer Jacob his name became Israel wo amen do you know our God is the god of Israel the god of the message is the god of Israel is the god of Isaac is the god of Israel the god of Abraham same God is our God do you know God can naturally rather literally reorder the natural Order of Things so much the extent that people won't recognize you say you used to have a lot of for alol what happened to you you God you become so stupid come on one for I'm sorry I'm not there I don't have the appetite do you believe that is possible do we have anyone here that God has ever delivered from alcohol do we have anyone here don't feel ashamed I need a testimony yes see people here sister brother anybody else it's not a shame raise up your hand see listen listen friends brother Peter brother Peter this is a powerful testimony powerful testimony brother Rand this a powerful I wish I was drinking alcohol so I can give the testimony but God has delivered me from other things God is able to deliver someone from someone who has been so tossed and driven into that life when you meet the angel is able to deliver you and set you free from immorality we've seen people that will literally tell you they could not be satisfied they just so immoral could be women or could be men doesn't matter we see some in the Bible like The Prostitute that came to wash Jesus's feet you remember that how many up your yes that woman she was The Prostitute to the extent that even people were telling Jesus in their heart we wish he knew the kind of that was touching him this woman is so un filthy Jesus knew it Jesus wants such people to touch him those are the ones is siek and when this woman came she was so committed she was so yielded she didn't care what anybody else and when she came and touched his feet began washing now what was she doing today you can do the same by washing Jesus's feet with your tears if you can go in a private prayer you're not going to go squeeze your tears [Music] out Godly sorrow will bring it that is true repentance Godly sorrow automatically naturally brings the tears You Feel So Unworthy do you feel so bad that you have been able to ashame thew that Christ could die for you it brings God and then you begin to think about your life like that woman why do you think she was thinking the whole time she was thinking about how many men she has gone with and then she went with them and left this one Jesus Jesus is the only man that can satisfy your and this man you know when he meets you rearranges your appetites this woman had been with many men but among all of them she had never been satisfied but when she met this one she was just so touched in a very special way that she failed I am satisfied she cried like she has never cried before she saw like she had never saw before she began powering her tears she picked up a very expensive oil of perfum what prostitutes use she powered it down you know what do you have in your hand Moses had a road he thre say throw it down he threw it down whatever you have the only thing you have to do is to throw it down in his presence she took what was was happening God was transforming her God was realigning every Mo God was changing every part of God was satisfying every thirst she had you can debate it all you want but this is something that happened and if it happened it can still happen today and this woman being a prostitute you know her appetites began dying because she had found [Applause] theallu amen she didn't even care how she was being judged look at she look at this the muc something was happening in her thir was being qued I'm I'm showing you what happens in his pres sometimes these things happen and we don't know what is going on you need to know what happens that when that presence come there is something happening super all of the sudden you begin to realize your appetites have changed your desires have changed why because you have found youren and this woman right there she left that place pure holy sinless cleaned up perfect ready for the coming of the Lord hallelujah hallu that was not the only one there was another one you know they had even C handed in adultery this was perhaps a married woman and and and she had gone out with another another man and they called her and according to the laws of the Jews they had to turn her to death so they began running after her and they C her but something happened some of them remembered there is Jesus let us go and see what does he say about this so they took the woman right to where Jes the woman was ashamed the woman was embarrassed that is what sin does sin embarrasses you sin asham you sin strips you of all the glory and that's how the woman was she was living in the life of sin everybody would be like they were spitting on her throwing stones at her beating her slapping her and then they came to Jesus It Was Written such people we kill them what do we do to this woman he looked at them looked at the woman and wrot on the ground what do you think he WR on the ground forgiven but inside the forgiven everybody could see the sins they had done before everybody many times we as human beings when we we when we when we catch somebody everybody will bring their anger you a snake a serpent they don't look ATS but what if you were to change the screen and make it look at you would you stand there would you speak those words you couldn't and Jesus used the same scenario he showed everybody what they had done and he told them now the one that has never done this cast the first stone the high priest and the others and Jesus was woman is there anyone who condemns you no and then Jesus said neither do I neither do I go your sins are forgiven tell me any person that came before the presence of God in this Bible that remain us zakas is another zakas had blood on his hands he had stolen A lot of people he was a thief he was how does the bible call it an extortioner you know you know those kind of people you know borrow me 5,000 I'm giving it to you tomorrow tomorrow and it never comes again okay just borrow me this time 100,000 I promise you in the next one hour I'm paying it and if you here you are like Zak you are an extortioner yes you are taking money and you cheating it you're not paying it back I believe is not supposed to do that a man is as good as his what we should be Honorable Men Women your amen were smaller if you are a culprit repent also come in that presence one time then you don't know what will happen something will happen zakas was like that he was always even taking he was a tax collector and so he had taken a lot of money that did not belong to him and this man had become rich because of this kind of things and we have so many today even in the Mage churches that are extortioners you know the Bible says we should not accompany ourselves with extortioners and for we should even excommunicate them and chest them from the church why because they are bringing in that spirit the church Spirits are contagious but let me bring the other side if that person was to come before the presence of God he cannot remain the same and zakus heard that Jesus was coming his way and what did he do he was a short man you know those people who have if you have ever been conned I remember there's a day I was traveling to I was in the Zambia Tanzania border and it was my first time I don't remember the name of the Border many years ago 201 and so I I met you know I think the Zambian man is calleda is I don't remember and then the tanzan called but tanzan Zambian money is much lesser in value the Zambian money is lesser in value so tanzan money is higher value exactly exactly and so then I had dollars and I also had some um uh you know tan money and so now I needed to change this money into Zambian money so I can be able to have a bus fair and so I met this man and you ask me that question whether ever been this is when it happened actually so and so I meet this man and he tells me how much do you want I tell him this much and then he tells me okay how much so what's the rate I told him he told me the rate he said I can't you seen it I said yes he was so fast like lightening I don't remember how it happened is it correct see quickly I said yes okay but I didn't I was like what what exactly did he do is it good I counted I realized he had Sten for me like $100 half of what I had more than half what I had I almost freezed I felt so I felt so foolish and stupid so effect and so oh my God you even oh God may you r c but because you're a Believer God forgive you he didn't know what he did I never C people never C anybody because you're a child of God even when they do something about let them take it someone one time sto motorcycle from me my first motorcycle but God gave me a car instead if I had C them I would get a car don't cuss anybody no matter what they do to you bless cast not and so I bless that man but it was so painful and so you know these people and I remember one time I was in kaj some years ago I was still student at inba University and so I was going to see over at my mother's place and um you know there's a place where there's a market around there and so I meet someone selling very good clothing very good trousers and oh my God I said this is so nice how much they told me so little I was excited I paid it immediately he showed me the TR I was saw and when I reached home I realized it was only one leg I couldn't even tell my mother it so embarrassed me I just threw it away but in my heart I felt I said oh God forgive that man he did what he was doing I was already believe of the message but I was so fed I was so deceived I felt so little I was I felt so used one one side of the trouser same color how he did it I don't know but I remember seeing the trouser and I remember him giving it to me after putting it in the Cava so but later on I leared these people are very intelligent by the way the the children of the children of of Kan are very SL he has another person there and another one here so as you pulling out money he hands over the other to the other one and then he brings it says give me then he gives this one so the other has the other one one leg and and the one of two legs another and him so you see the same when he gives you just do like this and you know it is okay when you reach home I don't know whether has ever happened to somebody else is there anybody like that I'm the only fool here and so friends I felt so bad but same thing zakas was doing cheating people stealing them of their hard and resources and he was becoming rich on that and he didn't even have a heart of feeling for these people but one time when he had that Jesus was com he climbed a tree just to see him just to see him that's why I always tell people don't worry how bad you are come in the church sit down under the word let the word work on you the word always corrects the eror so zakus when he saw Jesus he shouted he was on top of the tree Jesus was down and so he was on a s tree and he said Jesus please I invite you to my house come and visit me I want you to come Jesus actually I'm sure he was doing that in his heart but Jesus knowing this man as much as I said sons of Cain but this was not a son of Cain you know child of God could be entr trumped into a behavior of Sons of K but God can deliver you too like you delivered zakas and zakas took you know Jesus told him looked up said zakus in other words I've heard your prayer I've heard your cry today I will be with you in your house I believe Jesus can tell you the the same thing right here right now how do you know you hear it you hear him calling out your name where the preacher is preaching you can hear your name and say that's me Zak said he came out of the up from the tree quickly he took Jesus in his house he was so excited when you meet Jesus you cannot be the same you will be excited it excites your body it excites your spirit it excites your heart why because there's a transformation taking place and this man took Jesus in his house and do you know what Jesus never preached he was he just went there and then zakas began what about the money after what about Jesus said just pay back pay back you can start over on a new page he said I'm going to pay them I'm going to pay them more than I took from them it was a revelation he wasn't C it was a revelation a conviction coming from a revelation brother sister when you are convicted by the Holy Spirit it comes as a revelation to you how you must come out of a situation from that day zakas was a say hallelujah and then came the soldiers then came the soldiers when they met him in his presence what did they have all they had was they were soldiers and they told him what about us what should we do he told them just do your job properly don't steal what doesn't belong to you don't take what is not yours do your job properly in other words whatever you need is actually already with you and when you are in his presence and you cast it down in his presence listen friends he takes you and begins to rearrange and M another character praise the name of the Lord um give me a few more minutes um maybe like 20 I I just summarize I'll not summarize I'll just try to see where to stop from here so he says this act serves as a reminder that God has the ability to transform and renew not only objects but also the lives of individuals and the destiny of Nations God can renew transform the lives of individuals and the destiny even of [Music] Nations many came to him and they were transformed there is no way you can sit in the church if you are hearing what is being preached and you don't get transformed some of you men you will throw away those St pants that look like you've been thrown inside it's a transformation that will take place in your life all these fashions that is happening today the Bible says that we should not be you know conformed to the world and you find those boys Bo and to dress like them you put those PS up here it tightens you so and then your your whole body begins to and then down there it is too short it looks like you are a and then you begin walking and you a man shame on you and if in this church and you do that sh we ought not to have any young man dressed like that in this church pastor they will live let them live we stand for Holiness we stand for the truth we must be an example to our generation let them see us let them see Christ if they can't see Christ in us then we we are no longer the salt of the earth we should be the salt of the earth we should be the Sal that transformation must happen because God Jesus Christ transforms he transforms are you hearing me church he transforms he you don't have to struggle on your own he can take you and mold in you a character that is like his the problem many people suffer on their own and then it doesn't work and then they say it doesn't work they don't wait longer his presence they're no longer patient someone comes in the presence of God and he not patient he doesn't want to stay how even in the hospital you can ask Dr when you go in the hospital you have to stay if you're going for an operation and it also depends on how bad you are how bad your situation is you may stay a day two or even a month or even more than a month or even more than a month depending on how bad you are you need to stay in the presence of until God does something that's why I've Tau it here and I am not ashamed of to teach it that I don't believe the solution to overcoming sin is ashaming the Sinners I don't believe it that way oh brother done so has done then pull them and bring them here confess everything you've done it's never been done that way never been done that way the it's not necessary as far as I'm concerned but what changes a sinner is finding that presence of the Holy Spirit once when you come in his presence you don't need a preacher to tell you you will actually be above the law you can be caught by the law anymore you have to be transformed just as the staff is transformed from a symbol of guidance and Authority [Music] into a serpent and Back Again God can bring about a similar transformation in the lives of those who trust in him God knows you but he also knows your enemy and this is the place where I want to to now climax on I want you to see in Exodus 7 ver9 turn there with me when Pharaoh shall speak to you saying show a miracle for you then Thou shalt say unto Aaron take thy Road and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded and Aaron cast down his road before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt and they also did in in like manner with their enchantments for they cast down every man is Road and they be became serpents but aon's Road swallowed up their roads [Music] okay now friends I I want you to so up here and um we conclude on this whatever I need to overcome my enemy is already in me I just need to have a revelation you know what God gives you what God placed in you he also knew the enemy you will meet a he asked Moses what do you have Moses said a ro said cast it down it became a it wasn't for nothing because God knew that the enemies of Moses in egpt Sorcerers amen they would come with their enchantment all these magicians they will come with their enchantment and then they will form snakes God knew are you not so glad God goes right into the head of your enemy and he knows how the enemy is going to attack you and God has already put the resistance in you how you will resist him because he says resist the devil and he will flee from you but the resistance is already in you you just don't know it yet Moses had it the whole time the only thing he needed to do is to cast it down in the presence of God cast it down in the presence of God and when he went there he told him now let me tell you how your enemies were when you go before them they will ask for a sign throw the stick down again it will become a and then God kept quiet God won't tell you what your enemy will do but God knows it and he has given you every equipment you need to overcome your enemy your enemy could be lost your enemy could be the desire you have for filthy movies worldly music I hope there is no believer here who enjoys worldly music you find a Believer listen to and you listen to that you're feeding on that no wonder marage is not easy for you've been you've been listening to that F what are you listening to pastor this is not so bad but it is not bad it is singing about normal life I don't want to be told about no more I want to be told about life about Hallelujah the music I'm going to listen to should be telling me about my heavenly home Hallelujah that's why you come in the church you can't pray because those songs squeeze life out of you and you begin listening to that music you know I can't imagine list and list God delivered me from that you know just s that because I used to listen it just came back to me now I used to listen to them oh I used to love West life and he would put it you don't even know who they are it's all right and I would listen to that music oh you also know so you see and it used to be so good when I listen to him I feel my heart being M but my heart was so full of sin those songs were massaging the but brother when I receive the Holy Ghost the desire for those Souls just die just die when I listen to it now I feel like vomiting because because my soul have the spirit of God it can only be massage with the word and the songs of Z so imagine what kind of songs are you listening to it shows what is in you you need that presence when you come in that presence your appetite will be changed the things I'm preaching to you this morning is the word of God I know it may hurt some of you but when we go over there you will love me you will love me for shouting on top of my voice for preaching like a dying man because you are also died and then you will be happy over there because were saved because you were Sav you say thank you what you say that day it helped me sometimes you don't like preaching things which make people feel bad but it's a duty of every preacher to do that it's like going to a hospital you tell the doctor don't use that injection on me there are some people who are very good way you go to the hospital before even they give you medicine make sure you don't give me tablets and make sure injection but you can find something else now you have already limited the doctor he can't treat you well when he gives you the medication you go you Doctor your medication is not working it's your problem the doctor to do his job allow the preachers to preach and don't say I'm preaching about you of course I'm preaching about you because I'm here to preach about you so you can be changed how can he how can he make the whole suon me I don't even feel like going back again to chur so you wanted me to preach about I have to rest you properly so you can be changed it is the word to change me praise the name of the Lord and so these Sorcerers they all cast down their spells their roads and they became serpents God never spoke that part he left it for Aaron and Moses to find out on their own God has left you to find out your enem tricks on their own but don't worry he has given you the resistance I have no fear for Jesus walks beside me and I'm shed the arms of God the storms the dark clouds rise The Temptations rise they won't worry me I am sh within the arms of God he walks with me and nothing of this shall me I am sh The Arms Of God that should be a song that should be your desire saying he works beside me he's living in me he's living with me is the overcoming power in me I am not worried about my enemy because the the solution for my enemy is already with me he's already in me because he said I will be with you I will be in you the RO that was changing let me tell you what it is it is the name of Jesus that is our Ro it's a ro of power The Magicians had them the S had them when they came phara told them come do your enchantments let us see what will happen and show this people they have one road but we have more of course the gods of the world are more but they're less powerful you find someone with all the collection of people may have a legion in you I don't care my God is more powerful than any that of and and you see this you know they began en chanting I don't even know how do they you know how they do it you know like those people you know just [Music] come another one and they begin to call their gods whatever words they were speaking speaking their false tongues do you know these people were speaking in the for T and then they would throw and every they throw down became a serpent was what's happening here but what Moses did not know what he was not told what he heard swallow that was has not told there are things that God has not told you Hallelujah but in the moment it works the name of Jesus works the word Works in every situation I don't care your situation apply that situation if you a sinner repent and there are sins you can't repent yourself and there are sins you can't even repent to your friend you have to come to the Elders of the church and confess your faults so they can pray a prayer of faith for you some of you can even become ill sick you can even get a mental issue because you're dealing with sin and you don't want to it can take you to your early grave we've seen people that it has possible someone lose their mind in the message there was a woman she was with brother Bram and she had she had a mental case she was losing her mind and came to brother bam for prayer and brother bam cast out the demon the demon refused to so there are spirits that can refuse to because of unconfessed sin in the name of Jesus said no not yet I have a claim on this one and this woman brother bam told her I need to sit down with you so we can have a private interview brother bam sat together with his wife and sister and they began talking to her and as he began talking to her God began to reveal to her to him things about this woman so that this woman her husband is a soldier and her husband had gone to War and the woman went out with another man and so as brother B began to speak the woman started please never talk about please said why I confessed that to the Holy Spirit God forgave me years ago about it will kill me he said no you already D you already I have talk about it heisted have talk about it this is where your man and the woman said no you K me my husband doesn't know said that's where the problem your husband has to know you have to confess you have to confess what exactly happened and to help her reveal to her also the husband had done the same so said so then this will help you you have to confess it to your said but you have to help me but you have to talk to him yourself and so he she did later on and they forgave each other and their marriage which was having problems was healed the sickness the woman was having left and they became so lovely what am I saying they are sudden sins you can't confess to God In Prayer alone you already confessed to God now you're very quiet there are certain things you need to come to the Elders of the church to be helped to be guided to be instructed that's the job of of the pastor praise the name of the Lord and there are certain things you need even to speak and confess in the church in some scenarios so friends the the prophet says here and notice God told Moses what is in your hand he said it's a stick a rod just an old dry stick of the desert where he would have been walking along along like this with it in his hand that may be all that he had was a stick maybe you haven't even got that much but whatever you got give it to God look what he did with a stick so what do you have in your hand give it to God we might not even have a stick maybe you only sing a song maybe you can testify whatever you got to do do it use it for the glory of God no matter what it is if you can't sing then whistle if you can't whistle testify if you can't pass out tracks do something else let's get going ever what's in your hand use it for the glory of God God always had men who had stick who would stick by him rather and if I had time time only constrains me I'll talk to you about something and how Samson simply had a job and how his enemies were on him but you see he just picked a job and killed thousands you know I talk about David how David only you know had a stone he used one stone in his hand and he killed Goliath so whatever you have you can use it to defeat your enemy there is a a lot of potential in you maybe you have a little desire for God that is in your hands you can use that let us stand on our feet brother would say I was preaching one day in an arena of a football stadium and as I went in I seen a little sign always encouraged me had a big sign there said it's not the size of the dog in the fight is the size of the fight in the it ain't how timid you are oh what you are brother rise up tell your neighbor rise up tell your sister rise up my S it ain't what you are it's what Christ is that is in you whatever the power of the Holy Ghost you say well my neighbors will laugh at me when I got saved go get Christ in in there and see how you can talk to your neighbor see how life will change now sometimes we preach and think that things will happen right away this is the kind of sermon that you've heard today that you are going to have to think about you really have to do it on your own time and contemplate and say Lord how is my standing how is my life no I want to see you I want to meet you I want to know you in the power of your Resurrection this is your personal relationship with Jesus Christ does it happen it still does happen I'd like us to sing a song that says How Great Is Our God if you
