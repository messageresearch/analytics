[39:50] Wednesday evening service here
[39:59] this will be a blessing to everyone
[40:04] so if you can check your Bible we are
[40:06] opening in second Corinthians
[40:14] and we are reading from verses 3 to
[40:17] verses 6.
[40:25] for for though we walk in the flesh we
[40:28] do not war after the flesh
[40:30] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[40:32] Kano But Mighty through God to putting
[40:35] down of strongholds casting down
[40:38] imaginations and every High thing that
[40:40] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[40:43] God and bringing into captivity every
[40:45] thought to The Obedience of Christ
[40:48] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[40:53] Disobedience when your obedience is
[40:55] fulfilled
[40:58] is
[41:42] Father Lord we ask your blessing Lord
[41:45] tonight upon your word that we have read
[41:49] and The Souls of people that you have
[41:52] predestinated to be able to hear the
[41:54] sound of our voice this evening
[41:59] pray Lord it used to be a blessing to
[42:01] every one of us
[42:03] foreign
[42:34] so I'm speaking to you this evening on
[42:37] bringing every thought to captivity
[42:44] bringing every thought to captivity
[42:49] now in the message influence influence
[42:59] in 1963
[43:02] God is Prophet says God is so many
[43:04] presence knows what you are doing
[43:11] and every soul and every and even your
[43:15] thoughts
[43:17] one time while I was in a vision I was
[43:19] speaking to a big being standing by him
[43:27] back he said your thoughts are louder in
[43:30] the heavens than your voice on the earth
[43:35] [Music]
[43:37] this is now an angel of the Lord
[43:40] speaking to uh brother I'm telling him
[43:42] that your thoughts in heaven are louder
[43:45] than your voice on Earth
[43:52] foreign
[43:57] you might say you you do this and you do
[44:00] that and it but you see down in your
[44:02] heart if you think different you are
[44:05] doing something wrong
[44:14] you should be just what you are
[44:17] the heart the mouth should speak what is
[44:21] in the house
[44:22] and so we find that the people doesn't
[44:25] realize the presence of God
[44:29] you know they ought to be like David the
[44:31] man was the man was after God his own
[44:34] heart
[44:34] [Music]
[44:37] he said the Lord is always before me
[44:41] wherever he goes he remembers God is
[44:43] always before him
[44:47] he's on my right hand and I will not be
[44:49] moved
[44:52] now David always knew the Omni presence
[44:55] of God
[44:58] like you that he was always there
[45:01] God is Not only there when you're in
[45:03] church
[45:05] God is Not only there when you are
[45:07] hearing the word
[45:09] God is always there
[45:12] God is there in your dark moment
[45:15] God is there in your bright time
[45:19] God is there in your Corners deep
[45:21] Corners there
[45:24] God is there at night and is there
[45:26] during that time
[45:29] and now I want to bring to your
[45:31] attention this evening
[45:34] a spirit or a demon that has captivated
[45:37] many people
[45:38] [Music]
[45:41] in our generation to the extent that
[45:45] many of them have come to a point of
[45:47] losing their minds
[45:51] and they've had to go and begin you know
[45:55] they have had to go to the uh to to
[45:58] their hospitals
[46:00] and get medications
[46:04] others have gone to the psychiatrists
[46:08] and this is reality
[46:11] it is happening to people maybe it is
[46:15] happening to some of you that are
[46:16] listening to me
[46:33] they can call it
[46:38] you know oppression or whatever it is
[46:42] but we know what our Prophet says
[46:46] these are demons
[46:59] it's a spirit which has been sent from
[47:02] the kingdom of darkness to come and
[47:03] oppress you
[47:07] come and take you out of your god-given
[47:09] place
[47:12] and bring you to a place of captivity
[47:15] and so now there is something else
[47:20] that is binding the people that is
[47:23] captivating them
[47:24] that is uh the devil is coming in their
[47:28] thoughts
[47:30] the devil is coming in their souls
[47:33] and really has always come in thoughts
[47:37] this is as we shall see this is the
[47:39] place where he usually fights
[47:43] but you see uh we've had people people
[47:46] hear voices
[47:51] you know voices speaking to them
[47:54] and they think things
[47:57] sometimes things that are very nasty
[48:01] sometimes things that are very filthy
[48:05] and they want to overcome this kind of
[48:07] thoughts
[48:09] but sometimes it feels as if that
[48:11] thought unto you is the same person
[48:16] and it might be you know a thought that
[48:20] is filthy in a way of sin
[48:22] [Music]
[48:25] it might be a soul that is not actually
[48:27] about Sin
[48:29] but it might be speaking to you in your
[48:32] mind telling you how bad you are
[48:34] whatever
[48:37] you are good for nothing you cannot
[48:40] accomplish anything you are a failure
[48:43] that you know things are not going to
[48:45] work out for you
[49:17] I am just depressed I am under the
[49:20] control the Captivity of these things
[49:24] I don't know what to do now you may not
[49:27] be safe you may not go to jail but you
[49:31] may be in another situation
[49:33] which is almost similar to that you hear
[49:37] voices whereby you think you know
[49:40] something convinces
[49:42] to go a certain direction of life
[49:45] to do certain actions
[50:01] this is almost like impossible for you
[50:05] to break away from those songs
[50:14] I want to announce to you tonight
[50:18] and let me tell you he's coming in our
[50:21] generation
[50:22] to put all of us under captivity
[50:26] to whereby we cannot attain the
[50:28] god-given promises
[50:32] you know God has already arranged for
[50:35] each of us
[50:41] already arranged for us
[50:48] he knows where you are going what you
[50:50] are going to attain
[50:52] but here is the bad news the devil knows
[50:55] that too and when he comes and don't
[50:59] forget the devil cannot come to anyone
[51:02] that is useless
[51:05] are you hearing me
[51:08] if you you have been fighting these
[51:10] thoughts foreign
[51:28] [Music]
[51:52] [Music]
[52:08] the thought of God about us we know the
[52:11] promises of God for us but you see when
[52:14] the devil brings our other thoughts
[52:19] that that is the difference and let me
[52:22] tell you the one way that the enemy will
[52:24] try to fight
[52:27] that he knows it is almost a sure win
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] is when he comes to fight you by you
[52:36] know
[52:41] see when if the devil uses somebody else
[52:44] you can write big customers
[52:48] but when the devil uses you now
[52:51] yesterday
[52:53] many times this is difficult
[52:56] so many people
[52:59] that this is the devil and this is me
[53:03] until many times many people have come
[53:05] to a place of acceptance
[53:09] and they say I think this is
[53:17] that is not of God is not you thinking
[53:21] it is
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] you know and he began to to talk to him
[53:45] many times we think it was the devil
[53:48] leading Jesus and the devil was another
[53:50] person
[53:53] [Music]
[53:54] but it might encourage you to know
[53:57] it might actually comfort you to know
[54:01] that Jesus was actually fighting the
[54:03] devil in his thoughts
[54:07] and this battle Jesus
[54:11] and this battle you will win it
[54:14] because remember we are we are not
[54:16] supposed to fight
[54:18] we are trophies of his grace
[54:22] we are supposed to attain in every
[54:24] victory that he attained for us
[54:27] by faith and so Jesus found the devil in
[54:31] his thoughts yes
[54:34] and we in the same way
[54:37] amen I want to tell you there is a power
[54:40] man there is a power that comes by the
[54:43] word of God
[54:45] that gives us amen the grace to bring
[54:49] down everything
[54:57] to bring it down to captivity
[55:00] amen that's how we are able to stand
[55:03] and we remain standing as children of
[55:06] God
[55:07] otherwise we would have been on
[55:09] medication
[55:11] some of you don't even sleep maybe
[55:14] oh you don't have good sleep
[55:17] because of souls but the Bible says God
[55:20] gives his beloved sleep
[55:40] [Music]
[56:22] foreign foreign
[56:39] we are human beings like anybody else
[56:42] we are not carrying on we are not we are
[56:45] not carrying on our spiritual warfare
[56:47] according to the flesh
[56:53] using the weapons of man
[56:57] we are not going to fight our battle
[56:59] together according to the flesh
[57:04] using guns
[57:08] using words
[57:11] no because we are not fighting a
[57:14] physical battle
[57:17] and I would recommend each of you read
[57:20] the message the greatest battle ever
[57:21] fought
[57:25] alternative
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] 1962 he says
[57:30] the greatest spot to ever fall
[57:33] she is going on right now in here
[57:37] even now as I'm speaking to you
[57:40] even know
[57:48] the day of your life
[57:51] you've gone through this battle
[57:53] it is going on right even here now so
[57:59] you are thinking this battle is going on
[58:03] she's raging in your in your mind
[58:07] many times we think that people are in
[58:09] church
[58:10] but someone can stand up and walk away
[58:14] not because they have been offended by
[58:17] the preacher
[58:18] but because the devil has overcome them
[58:22] even when the word is going on
[59:10] by those evil imaginations
[59:15] God
[59:18] you will differentiate your voice and
[59:21] the voice of Saturn
[59:22] [Music]
[59:23] those thoughts are not your thoughts
[59:26] those are certainly thoughts
[59:28] is the devil speaking to your mind
[59:31] telling you the negative things
[59:34] because when you speak
[59:36] you will only speak according to his
[59:39] word
[59:41] because you are his sister
[59:43] your son can only speak according to his
[59:46] son can only speak according to his
[59:47] father are you
[59:51] and even Jesus said that without him I
[59:53] can do nothing
[59:54] [Music]
[59:55] as far as I am concerned
[59:58] without him we
[1:00:01] can do nothing you can do nothing but
[1:00:05] you see everything else
[1:00:07] comes in from the wrong one
[1:00:10] he says the greatest spot to ever fought
[1:00:13] she's going listen listen she's going on
[1:00:16] right now in here now
[1:00:36] you see sometimes the spirit of God will
[1:00:39] come
[1:00:39] and speak against what you know you are
[1:00:42] doing
[1:00:43] oh what you're going through at that
[1:00:47] moment the battle is ready
[1:00:50] God is telling you drop it leave it work
[1:00:54] away from that life but another voice is
[1:00:57] telling you no you cannot there is a
[1:01:00] battle going on
[1:01:03] and he says Shine Your spear soldiers
[1:01:06] foreign
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:02:06] foreign
[1:02:26] Hallelujah
[1:02:28] what are preachers to do oh
[1:02:31] what is the work of the preachers
[1:02:38] to stand there and motivate you foreign
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:03:31] foreign
[1:03:39] when this great battle started on Earth
[1:03:42] there had to be a mutual meeting place
[1:03:47] there had to be a place selected for the
[1:03:50] battle to begin
[1:03:52] and for the butter to rage and that
[1:03:56] Battlegrounds begin in the human mind
[1:04:01] there is where the battle starts
[1:04:04] the human mind was chosen for the place
[1:04:07] of the battle
[1:04:11] where it was begin or began and that is
[1:04:15] because that decisions are made from the
[1:04:18] mind
[1:04:22] and that listen listen and now they
[1:04:25] never started it from some organization
[1:04:29] they never studied it from some
[1:04:31] mechanical Affairs
[1:04:33] the grounds of God
[1:04:37] it says the grounds never started there
[1:04:40] all territory
[1:04:43] Jennifer that organization can never do
[1:04:46] the work of God
[1:04:49] because the Battlegrounds
[1:04:52] where you have got to meet your enemies
[1:04:57] you've got to take to make your choice
[1:05:00] foreign
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:43] that's where it starts and when you hear
[1:05:47] the word
[1:05:48] where does it come fast
[1:05:51] where does it come fast to the mind
[1:05:56] if your man clears it it goes down to
[1:05:58] the heart
[1:06:01] but many times
[1:06:03] people's minds reject the words
[1:06:07] and the moment you reject the world
[1:06:10] it is as if you are a duck
[1:06:13] the world has been powered out
[1:06:17] just shake it off and you are still as
[1:06:20] dry as you were in the beginning
[1:06:22] and you remain with that Stony heart
[1:06:25] Nursery because you gathered the word
[1:06:28] away from your mind
[1:06:33] the devil will try to bring you this is
[1:06:42] study and the devil is always trying to
[1:06:45] point you to someone's failure yes
[1:06:49] but he tries to keep you away from the
[1:06:51] real testimony that is genuine
[1:06:55] when I tell you it is possible for you
[1:06:58] to marry what government
[1:07:00] a good wife who is a Believer the enemy
[1:07:05] will tell you how about the other one
[1:07:07] and the other one failed and the
[1:07:11] island failed the devil will never show
[1:07:14] you one good testimony
[1:07:17] he will never show you genuine testimony
[1:07:19] testimony
[1:07:39] Hallelujah there came ten of them they
[1:07:43] all had negative testimony the devil
[1:07:47] showed them negative
[1:07:48] but there were two
[1:07:51] amen these are positive testimony they
[1:07:54] may not have had enough proof
[1:07:57] to prove all these people
[1:08:00] why only a few we are the right ones out
[1:08:03] of the men
[1:08:06] but what they had was a thus saith the
[1:08:10] Lord
[1:08:11] because God said it but his servant is
[1:08:15] amen Moses it is going to come to pass
[1:08:18] and they implore the people please
[1:08:22] believe it
[1:08:24] God has proved it over and over we have
[1:08:28] even gone to the land we have even seen
[1:08:31] the fruits
[1:08:33] and we can Testify the land is
[1:08:39] foreign
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:44] you are gone
[1:09:47] praise the name of the lord the devil
[1:09:50] will take you
[1:09:52] and bless you in accordance
[1:09:54] in a very silent place
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:59] there's no picture to encourage you
[1:10:01] anymore there is
[1:10:03] nothing you are the Lord
[1:10:07] and you will be there he'll begin coming
[1:10:10] you know when the devil wants to
[1:10:12] overcome here he will isolate you first
[1:10:20] animals like lions can be able to eat
[1:10:22] this kind of animals
[1:10:26] isolate them from the cross
[1:10:29] that's why you have to stay in
[1:10:31] Fellowship
[1:10:33] be in charge as much as you can
[1:10:36] listen to The World God is omnipresent
[1:10:41] everywhere you are you naturally leave
[1:10:43] us though God is singing
[1:10:46] your thoughts in heaven are louder than
[1:10:48] your wife
[1:10:51] I'm showing you a way to overcome
[1:10:54] you can bring those thoughts into
[1:10:56] captivity
[1:10:59] I'm not saying you won't have them I'm
[1:11:02] saying that you can't bring them to
[1:11:04] captivity
[1:11:07] you are living above them
[1:11:10] but he tries to keep you away from the
[1:11:12] Real Testament that's what the devil
[1:11:13] does
[1:11:16] he will point you out to a hypocrite
[1:11:21] sometime who went out impersonating
[1:11:23] something
[1:11:25] he didn't do it because he was
[1:11:27] impersonating that person
[1:11:29] because that person failed because he
[1:11:31] was impersonating
[1:11:34] but the devil will point you to that
[1:11:36] person
[1:12:32] if you have not changed
[1:12:37] is because you have not opened your mind
[1:12:41] the devil still captivating your
[1:12:43] thoughts
[1:12:44] but I tell you try my God
[1:12:48] open up your mind and you ought to be
[1:12:52] able to tell somebody
[1:12:54] if it never works for you
[1:12:56] try my God
[1:12:59] if you can't have a baby someone
[1:13:04] ought to give a positive testimony
[1:13:08] if you can't get married
[1:13:15] if you can't live a holy life young
[1:13:19] person try my God
[1:13:21] these are things that God has made
[1:13:24] others to overcome
[1:13:27] if you can't overcome them it cannot
[1:13:30] remove the fact that God is able
[1:13:35] God is able to heal
[1:13:37] foreign
[1:14:31] but if it comes from the true source of
[1:14:33] the word of God
[1:14:38] heavens and us shall pass away
[1:14:44] stay there
[1:14:47] yeah and I tell you usually I always see
[1:14:49] those people speaking negative
[1:15:09] that's a bad example foreign
[1:15:27] um it must be accepted in the mind
[1:15:30] meaning the word of God
[1:15:33] it must be accepted in the mind
[1:15:36] then just believed
[1:15:40] then the word of God becomes a reality
[1:15:45] if you you guard your mind and you don't
[1:15:48] accept it
[1:15:50] the word cannot become a reality
[1:15:54] then every senses of soul and body is
[1:15:57] just scored out with the Holy Spirit
[1:16:04] when you accept the word of God
[1:16:10] in your thinking when you cast down all
[1:16:13] those evil imaginations
[1:16:23] then he says the word of God is a
[1:16:25] reality
[1:16:26] foreign
[1:16:39] amen you're feeding you're testing
[1:16:42] you're hearing you're smelly every part
[1:16:46] of your will become flattered in
[1:16:50] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:51] will be under the subjection
[1:16:54] of the word of God
[1:16:57] then your sense of God
[1:17:00] you're conscious of God
[1:17:03] everything that is
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:13] so you're breaking out of Cycles
[1:17:17] you're breaking out of addiction you're
[1:17:20] breaking out of evil Souls you're
[1:17:23] breaking out of all these sorts of
[1:17:24] things
[1:17:28] in the world when it lands in your soul
[1:17:33] it is too late
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] he can't stop it
[1:18:02] and it becomes as if it is
[1:18:08] God help us
[1:18:10] everything that is
[1:18:15] not a doubt anyway
[1:18:17] there is nothing can rise
[1:18:20] nothing can rise up
[1:18:22] there is nothing can come up in the
[1:18:25] memory
[1:18:26] and say well I remember Miss Jones
[1:18:34] try to trust God for healing
[1:18:37] one time
[1:18:40] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:18:44] and being purged has been filled on the
[1:18:48] inside with the holy spirit
[1:18:50] that doesn't even come in memories
[1:18:58] it is
[1:19:03] and nobody else but you too
[1:19:08] there
[1:19:10] is your battle will kill him at the
[1:19:14] beginning
[1:19:16] foreign get a hold of your demons
[1:19:20] kill them at the beginning
[1:19:22] right in your mind
[1:19:29] stop him stop him dead in his truck
[1:19:34] it ain't how long you can make the world
[1:19:37] linger see
[1:19:40] it is stop it right now
[1:19:45] the problem is many of us try to linger
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:20:39] foreign we've opened that gate
[1:20:44] and she doubted
[1:20:47] right in her mind when she had it and
[1:20:51] reasoning began
[1:20:55] but it's began in our region
[1:21:04] I know who you are God said this I won't
[1:21:09] listen to you
[1:21:29] tell me more
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:33] okay I don't believe that
[1:21:39] don't entertain evil thoughts
[1:21:42] when evil thoughts come to you you will
[1:21:46] Notice
[1:21:48] cast them down that very moment
[1:21:52] how do we do
[1:22:39] for the destruction of fortresses
[1:22:45] what is a fortress
[1:22:48] a fortress is a middle stronghold
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:23:02] [Music]
[1:23:03] you know and this is what cappuccino the
[1:23:07] enemy builds up in Our Minds
[1:23:11] The World Keeps coming and there is a
[1:23:15] fortress
[1:23:16] but the Bible says God has weapons
[1:23:23] that he has given to his children and
[1:23:26] these weapons are not physical
[1:23:28] they are not but he said they are Mighty
[1:23:32] they are divinely powerful
[1:23:37] meaning with these weapons
[1:23:41] because there is a part of divine in it
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:43] guiding that story foreign
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:45] hello
[1:25:45] Goliath was a representation
[1:25:48] of the evil thoughts of Saturn everyone
[1:25:52] thought to destroy Israel
[1:25:55] to Hashem but the Bible tells me the day
[1:25:59] that trust in the Lord they shall never
[1:26:02] be ashamed he will never be ashamed
[1:26:05] brother you have a Divine weapon
[1:26:08] and when David sent it
[1:26:11] the power of God came down
[1:26:21] and down he was down what was that that
[1:26:26] was a divine power
[1:26:28] but it was the choice
[1:26:31] of David all his brothers were just
[1:26:34] standing there
[1:26:35] not deciding to cast down this
[1:26:38] imagination
[1:26:40] you have to decide to cast down your
[1:26:43] imagination
[1:26:53] he says Paul uses military terminology
[1:26:57] foreign
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:28:00] eternal room Spirit empowered believers
[1:28:10] to Christo
[1:28:23] [Music]

[1:28:34] oh no you cannot live like that as a
[1:28:36] young man
[1:28:38] you know be a little happier
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:46] before you eat don't let it go through
[1:28:48] here
[1:28:51] does it mean you have fear children
[1:28:58] when exposed to ideas or opportunities
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:13] he says here we have a choice
[1:29:19] we can recognize the danger and turn
[1:29:21] away
[1:29:25] someone tells you I'm gonna talk Gamba
[1:29:27] let's go to the club just for one night
[1:29:30] no issue no so I'm a believer I'm a
[1:29:34] Christian but I'm also a Christian let's
[1:29:36] go that moment you have a choice
[1:29:41] so well no I'm sorry I'm done
[1:29:45] I'm talking to young people
[1:29:49] ought to say it's all right
[1:29:54] when exposed to ideas or opportunities
[1:29:58] that might lead to wrong desires
[1:30:05] we have a choice we can recognize the
[1:30:09] danger and turn away
[1:30:12] or we can allow unhealthy thoughts to
[1:30:14] take us captive
[1:30:28] you have a choice
[1:30:30] you can turn away that very moment
[1:30:33] but what do many of you do
[1:30:36] you write back
[1:30:38] go away I don't want to talk to you
[1:30:42] you've simply declared that you want to
[1:30:44] talk to them

[1:30:54] again
[1:30:56] but you keep waiting for the rest
[1:31:01] so you see
[1:31:03] it away
[1:31:09] why is the gospel of Christ
[1:31:12] when Jesus Christ came he said it used
[1:31:16] to be you got my child but when you lay
[1:31:18] with a woman
[1:31:19] when you lay with a woman that is not
[1:31:21] your wife
[1:31:24] but here he says
[1:31:29] the moment you think it in your mind
[1:31:59] until some of us who have daughters we
[1:32:01] don't know how we can oh we shall raise
[1:32:03] them
[1:32:08] foreign
[1:32:29] and you know
[1:32:32] these female creatures
[1:32:34] are made in a way
[1:32:37] to respond
[1:32:39] to that kind of thing
[1:32:41] is
[1:32:47] praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:48] you just stress look she just looks at
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:53] and knows what you're trying to say
[1:32:57] if you're filled with the Holy Ghost the
[1:33:01] moment you see that you won't smile
[1:33:08] rebuke that kind of spirit
[1:33:11] someone said oh they said nothing um
