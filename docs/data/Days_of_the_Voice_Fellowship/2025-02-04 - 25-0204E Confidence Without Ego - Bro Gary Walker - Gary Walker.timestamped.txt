[43:33] ago and then a few things
[43:35] happened in the middle there also his
[43:38] wife sister Deborah went to be with the
[43:41] Lord and so it was not possible for him
[43:43] to
[43:44] come but God designed and
[43:48] desired this season he would be able to
[43:51] come I want to say Pastor Gary your
[43:53] ministry has been a blessing to
[43:57] UGA uh we were in
[43:59] carja where he ministered to at least uh
[44:03] three 3,500 4,000
[44:07] people in two different
[44:10] places and uh the his ministry is that I
[44:14] was telling by the Robert is that of
[44:15] teaching and
[44:19] grounding and I believe needs
[44:23] that just like we need it
[44:26] here have been blessed here on
[44:29] Sunday how many really were really
[44:31] really really
[44:33] blessed I personally was really really
[44:36] bled and so we appreciate you and we
[44:39] invite you
[44:40] again how many invite him
[44:45] again
[44:47] amen amen we invite you
[44:50] again should the Lord give the
[44:52] opportunity we will be happy to have you
[44:56] and the next time I was thinking that I
[44:59] will work with these
[45:01] pastors so that we can have you see
[45:04] Pastor Robert now that you are here you
[45:06] representing other pastors
[45:09] in you hear him
[45:11] preach and you will agree with me his
[45:15] ministry needs to be
[45:17] H and uh next time if he comes I would
[45:21] really be happy if we in here can
[45:25] arrange have some min
[45:27] something like
[45:28] that where he can be a blessing to the
[45:31] to the to the whole body
[45:35] in but we also thank God for the
[45:40] technology that we can be able to stream
[45:43] this and it can get to as far as whoever
[45:45] that desires to
[45:49] hear as well as those who can see it
[45:52] later
[45:53] on so God bless you
[45:57] I appreciate
[45:58] you you have been a
[46:01] blessing brother te has not preached a
[46:03] sermon in in
[46:06] Uganda has preached to me
[46:10] many by his life I don't say this to be
[46:14] good I mean it and I appreciate you by
[46:18] the te would you please come and greet
[46:20] the
[46:21] people and then afterward invite the
[46:29] God bless you brothers and
[46:32] sisters it is a a really special thing
[46:35] to be
[46:39] here I consider it a highlight of my
[46:46] life we go through many things in our
[46:54] lives but I think the long longer we are
[46:58] here as
[47:02] Christians the more we put weight on top
[47:05] of the things that God puts in our
[47:12] path that we believe are more attributed
[47:15] to the Eternal things than the temporal
[47:23] things and I have a my my mom
[47:27] is from South
[47:30] Africa so I've mentioned to Pastor Gary
[47:34] and Pastor buz if there is one place on
[47:36] Earth that I had a a deep love
[47:43] for it is
[47:47] Africa and so I consider it a tremendous
[47:53] blessing to be amongst
[47:57] you wonderful people
[48:00] know knowing that we believe that maybe
[48:03] our skin color is
[48:09] different maybe our culture is
[48:13] different but we can have a Oneness in
[48:16] our
[48:19] spirit because we believe that we have
[48:22] the same father
[48:26] amen
[48:28] amen what a
[48:31] privilege to believe that we came from
[48:33] the same
[48:36] place and that
[48:38] we as we
[48:41] are I mean as we are you know God has a
[48:45] a bouquet of
[48:50] flowers God wanted me like
[48:55] this God want God wanted you like
[49:00] that but that's only what we can
[49:05] see we are actually logos
[49:12] Sons because that's what our father
[49:16] is
[49:18] amen what a privilege to have faith in
[49:22] our souls to believe that
[49:30] amen this message is not skin
[49:33] [Music]
[49:37] milk this message
[49:46] is in other words this word has not
[49:50] being watered down by denomination
[49:58] but we believe that this message is the
[50:02] mystery of God that he has in his mind
[50:04] before the foundation of the
[50:14] world and I think we should never get
[50:16] used to the
[50:22] truth that in this hour we can put our
[50:25] arms around around the mystery of
[50:32] God and I can shake hands with the
[50:35] mystery of
[50:38] God
[50:40] Amen knowing that this flesh will
[50:46] perish but there's something in there
[50:48] that is eternal as God
[50:53] is amen
[50:56] because in the beginning he called their
[50:59] name
[51:04] Adam so in this end time he calls their
[51:08] name
[51:13] Jesus he is the further expression of
[51:17] the Almighty I am
[51:24] God and when we
[51:28] really catch what's between the
[51:33] lines it makes it so
[51:41] personal not what we can
[51:46] achieve but what God already has
[51:52] achieved but is just now being revealed
[51:56] to him
[52:00] bride so we can know the
[52:04] truth and believe the
[52:08] truth and it will just bring us to a
[52:11] deeper love for
[52:17] Jesus and a deeper love for my
[52:23] brother amen
[52:26] so I'm so happy to be here with you
[52:28] precious
[52:31] people it has been an honor to to assist
[52:35] Pastor
[52:39] Gary and to see the purchas of the blood
[52:44] of Jesus in

[56:08] confidence let's bow our heads in

[56:33] God bless you you may be
[56:36] seated
[56:38] confidence we need to be confident in
[56:40] who we
[56:44] are you hear sometimes a Pentecostal
[56:49] preacher he will scream out the battle
[56:51] is the
[56:54] Lords and the untrained Church will say
[56:59] amen and the preacher will scream out
[57:01] the battle is the
[57:04] Lord and the untrained church will
[57:07] scream out
[57:10] amen God is sitting in his high
[57:14] heaven and he looks over to
[57:18] Gabriel says haven't they read Ephesians
[57:23] 6 the battle is not the Lord's
[57:27] the battle is
[57:28] yours that's why you must be born
[57:32] again in the
[57:34] Psalms Psalms
[57:36] 352 says arise oh
[57:38] Lord put on belt and Buckler and
[57:43] shield destroy our enemies oh
[57:47] Lord and Theus took great
[57:50] joy knowing that the battle was the
[57:54] Lord but in heaven
[57:57] sent us a perfect
[58:00] sacrifice so that the blood cell could
[58:02] be
[58:04] split and when the blood cell was
[58:07] split God released himself into his
[58:12] hous and now God says put on the helmet
[58:15] of
[58:17] salvation take a hold of the sword of
[58:19] the
[58:19] Lord put on the breastplate of
[58:22] Faith see that your feet are shod with
[58:25] the preparation of the
[58:28] because we fight against principalities
[58:32] of the battle is not the
[58:35] Lords the battle is
[58:37] yours God doesn't want to change your
[58:41] situation God wants to change your
[58:45] perspective God can change your
[58:48] perspective you can change the
[58:51] situation the battle is yours you have a
[58:54] responsibility
[58:56] you've been called here for a
[58:58] purpose and we need to be
[59:01] confident without
[59:03] ego need to believe in
[59:11] yourself being confident of this one
[59:14] thing that he which started the good
[59:18] work will finish it till the day of
[59:21] Jesus Christ and this is the day of
[59:24] Jesus Christ
[59:27] brother Bram said this is the age
[59:30] of this is the age of the personal life
[59:33] of
[59:35] Christ this is what God has been waiting
[59:38] for this is your time this is your
[59:41] purpose is your calling battle is not
[59:45] the
[59:46] Lord hear ye
[59:53] him brother Bram took a lot of
[59:55] confidence in in the
[59:58] Visions he said I just love the
[1:00:01] Visions because I know what's going to
[1:00:03] happen in the
[1:00:05] vision and he's crying out oh Lord what
[1:00:08] must I
[1:00:09] do give me a
[1:00:11] vision and God said must I give you a
[1:00:15] vision isn't it written in the
[1:00:18] word there's a whole crop
[1:00:22] coming that don't have visions
[1:00:26] the bride in the last
[1:00:28] day is going to base her faith in the
[1:00:33] word I'm not waiting for a
[1:00:36] vision it's already been told
[1:00:38] me all things are possible to them that
[1:00:42] believe and if God is for us who can be
[1:00:46] against so the battle is yours God's
[1:00:50] relying on you to change the situation
[1:00:54] that's why you must be born again
[1:00:58] amen from the
[1:01:00] beginning God had counseled his own
[1:01:03] purpose he had a Plan of
[1:01:06] Salvation and that was towards his
[1:01:10] elect for God so loved the
[1:01:12] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:01:16] and when his only begotten son got
[1:01:18] here his only begotten son
[1:01:22] said father I do not pray for the world
[1:01:26] I pray for them that you sent
[1:01:28] me who he was sent
[1:01:31] to that's the world that God
[1:01:34] loves God so love the world that's the
[1:01:38] El that's the household of
[1:01:41] God Jesus was
[1:01:45] sent so the blood cell could be
[1:01:49] split and when the blood cell was
[1:01:51] broken God released
[1:01:54] himself back into
[1:01:57] so there's no need to
[1:01:59] scream the battle is the
[1:02:02] Lord God will
[1:02:04] say haven't you read
[1:02:07] Ephesians

[1:10:14] attitude to remove the entitlement
[1:10:20] spirits and to be the Masterpiece that

[1:11:22] completion after this there's nothing
[1:11:27] this is the conclusion of the
[1:11:30] drama God hiding himself in
[1:11:34] Simplicity but he which began a good
[1:11:36] work in
[1:11:38] you who perfect
[1:11:40] it will perfect it and the reason he's
[1:11:43] perfecting it because he changed his
[1:11:48] mask he's imori

[1:12:39] you and when it's
[1:12:41] revealed you don't need Hebrews 11
[1:12:44] fath when it's revealed it's a perfect
[1:12:48] Faith you're going to know that you know
[1:12:51] that you
[1:12:51] know it's going home time
[1:12:56] remember perfect faith is a faith that
[1:13:00] needs no
[1:13:04] faith amen can you say Amen so is is he
[1:13:09] still working on us of course he's still
[1:13:13] working amen but remember Jeremiah
[1:13:17] 1 God said before I
[1:13:19] formed before I formed you I knew
[1:13:23] you got I said to Job where were
[1:13:26] you when the sons of God presented
[1:13:30] themselves job should have said I was
[1:13:36] there when job was
[1:13:38] suffering when job was feeling sorry for
[1:13:41] himself God said J where were you when
[1:13:45] the sons of God
[1:13:47] presented before the
[1:13:49] before right at the beginning when you
[1:13:52] were chosen in me when there was nothing
[1:13:54] else
[1:13:57] me job should have said I was there and
[1:14:01] I knew this was coming but because it's
[1:14:05] locked in my
[1:14:06] subconscious I'm I'm feeling sorry for
[1:14:09] myself but when you hear Jesus
[1:14:13] say bring him here throw away your
[1:14:17] biggest
[1:14:18] gar throw away your begg's
[1:14:21] attitude throw away that entitlement
[1:14:24] spirit
[1:14:25] say he from now on if I get in the
[1:14:28] presence of Jesus I get my eyesight back
[1:14:33] I can finish the
[1:14:35] job the battle's not the L the battle
[1:14:39] mine God wants to change me that I can
[1:14:43] change the
[1:14:46] situation
[1:14:49] amen God
[1:14:51] said
[1:14:53] Jeremiah before
[1:14:55] I formed
[1:14:57] Thee I knew
[1:15:00] you amen before God formed you before
[1:15:04] God put you in this
[1:15:06] body you were
[1:15:08] somewhere
[1:15:10] hallelujah amen he said
[1:15:13] Jeremiah before I formed you I knew you
[1:15:17] and God said that because he knew
[1:15:20] Jeremiah chapter 20 was coming
[1:15:25] when Jeremiah was later on in his
[1:15:28] ministry he started feeling sorry for
[1:15:31] him he started noticing that the
[1:15:33] unbelievers had better
[1:15:37] houses and he started knowing the
[1:15:39] denominations had better
[1:15:41] cars and he started feeling sorry for
[1:15:44] himself and he said I'm no longer going
[1:15:46] to speak in the name of the
[1:15:49] Lord I'm no longer going to speak in the
[1:15:51] name of the Lord because I'm feeling
[1:15:53] sorry for myself
[1:15:56] he said but it didn't last long he said
[1:15:59] because there's a fire locked up in my
[1:16:04] bones the Fire won't go
[1:16:08] out there's a fire in my
[1:16:11] Bon and the Fire won't go
[1:16:14] out I have times I have
[1:16:18] times and you have times when you're
[1:16:21] feeling sorry for
[1:16:23] yourself and God says hey before I
[1:16:26] formed you knew you and the fire the
[1:16:31] fire starts to burn you say oh that was
[1:16:34] just I was just having a bad
[1:16:36] moment but I'm not going to be a
[1:16:39] beggar I'm going to be son so when you
[1:16:42] hit Jeremiah chapter
[1:16:46] 20 don't forget Jeremiah chapter
[1:16:49] 1 before I found
[1:16:52] you I knew you
[1:16:57] that's why I died for
[1:16:59] you the blood shell was
[1:17:03] broken for you so that I could release
[1:17:09] myself back into my
[1:17:11] house don't weep
[1:17:13] John don't weep John the lion of the
[1:17:17] tribe of Judah
[1:17:19] has amen and if Jesus Christ is the
[1:17:24] author in the fin of your

[1:18:06] restoration in this age this is the age
[1:18:10] of the finished
[1:18:13] cycle with this it's all
[1:18:17] over again the prophet said when it
[1:18:20] looks like everything has gone
[1:18:23] wrong God is giving you a
[1:18:26] tri but he's got confidence in
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:32] you and if God's got confidence in
[1:18:35] you then you need to have confidence in
[1:18:40] you confidence without
[1:18:44] ego so when it looks like everything has
[1:18:46] gone
[1:18:48] wrong God's giving you a
[1:18:50] trial God loves to test his people
[1:18:56] amen remember when you were at
[1:18:59] school all year you can interact with
[1:19:03] the
[1:19:05] teacher say to the teacher what does

[1:19:12] mathematics and you can interact with
[1:19:14] the teacher all year you can
[1:19:17] interact but at the end of the year you
[1:19:21] have to take a
[1:19:22] test and when you're taking your test
[1:19:26] you can't talk to the
[1:19:31] teacher the teacher has to remain
[1:19:35] silent silence is not
[1:19:39] absence silence is
[1:19:43] testing amen so just throw away the

[1:20:40] wrong it's a
[1:20:44] test don't walk
[1:20:46] away don't cry don't feel sorry for
[1:20:49] yourself it's a test be confident be

[1:55:53] me no no your emotions allowed
[1:55:56] it your pride allowed
[1:55:59] it ego allowed
[1:56:03] it the
[1:56:05] enemy cannot make you feel
[1:56:09] inferior unless you consent to
[1:56:13] it so be confident fear not the Lord
[1:56:19] himself has descended in the bride
[1:56:24] form Adam's wife
[1:56:27] fell Jesus wife fell and God said that
[1:56:32] will not happen
[1:56:34] again I will
[1:56:37] become I will become I'm going to change
[1:56:40] my
[1:56:41] MTH and God says before I formed
[1:56:46] you cuz you were in
[1:56:50] me watch your you're looking
[1:56:53] for might be what you're looking
[1:56:58] at
[1:57:00] confidence without
[1:57:03] ego you're going to have to stand
[1:57:06] confidence in what Calvary achieved for
[1:57:09] you Jesus Christ Heaven's perfect
[1:57:14] sacrifice when the blood cell was
[1:57:17] brok all my
[1:57:20] sins all my
[1:57:24] you see God needed to deal with the
[1:57:28] devil God
[1:57:29] needed to go to
[1:57:31] hell God cannot go to
[1:57:34] hell brother said just the smallest
[1:57:38] amount he said angels are filthy in his
[1:57:43] eyes God Is So holy that righteous
[1:57:48] angels are filthy in his eyes but God
[1:57:51] said I got to deal
[1:57:55] with he said I'm I'm going to I'm going
[1:57:57] to make up a
[1:57:58] plan and of course we say that to paint
[1:58:01] a picture in our
[1:58:03] mind because he knew all things right at
[1:58:06] the
[1:58:07] beginning God has never had another
[1:58:11] thought too great to have more
[1:58:16] thoughts so God said in the drama I'm
[1:58:20] going to get to hell and I'm going to
[1:58:22] sort this thing out once and for
[1:58:26] all but I can't go it's me so God became
[1:58:31] a
[1:58:35] man and Jesus Christ could not go to
[1:58:40] hell because he come he was
[1:58:44] sinless but God could put my
[1:58:52] he could
[1:58:57] go so that at
[1:59:00] Calvary the father said to the
[1:59:02] son and brother brandham said he had to
[1:59:05] wait till he was niled to the
[1:59:09] Cross he said son I am too holy to be
[1:59:14] with you for what is about to
[1:59:17] heaven I'm turning my back on you CU I
[1:59:21] am too righteous
[1:59:23] to be around you for what is about to
[1:59:27] happen and God turned us
[1:59:29] back and all your sin all your sin all
[1:59:34] my sin was poured upon
[1:59:39] heaven and he died of a broken
[1:59:43] heart but he descended and he took all
[1:59:47] my
[1:59:48] sin took all your sin
[1:59:52] to hell and when he
[1:59:55] rose I rose with him but I Rose
[2:00:00] he for
[2:00:03] my I I
[2:00:07] without so when he appears the second
[2:00:10] time he appears without
[2:00:15] s you are here brother Bram said he has
[2:00:19] appeared he's appeared in his
[2:00:23] and if he has appeared the second time
[2:00:26] he has appeared without
[2:00:30] sin I don't
[2:00:33] care what you
[2:00:35] did Brother Bram said I don't care what
[2:00:40] you did it's
[2:00:43] impossible for you to be a
[2:00:45] sinner that's the power of the
[2:00:49] blood and God did that
[2:00:53] so that he could release
[2:00:56] himself back into a sinless
[2:01:02] bride
[2:01:04] amen amen can you say Amen the prophet
[2:01:09] said the only real
[2:01:11] Sin is to doubt
[2:01:17] it shut up
[2:01:23] just accept what God has done for
[2:01:30] you so the
[2:01:32] enemy cannot make you feel
[2:01:37] inferior without your
[2:01:39] consent because God has not given us the
[2:01:42] spirit of
[2:01:44] fear but of
[2:01:46] power and of
[2:01:49] love and a sound of mind
[2:01:53] and a sound
[2:01:55] mind you can only
[2:01:58] feel
[2:02:00] offended if you have a weak
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:06] mind you can only
[2:02:09] feel
[2:02:12] inferior if you have a weak
[2:02:15] mind God did not give us the spirit of
[2:02:19] fear but of power
[2:02:22] and of love and of a sound
[2:02:26] mind who do you say you
[2:02:32] are brother BR said how can he
[2:02:37] sin when a perfect sacrifice is lying in
[2:02:41] his place I didn't get it
[2:02:54] and the prophet said God never looks at
[2:02:59] me he looks at
[2:03:01] Christ Hallelujah again
[2:03:04] prop how can he
[2:03:08] sin when the sinless God is in
[2:03:15] him the prophet said no matter what he's
[2:03:20] done the blood covers
[2:03:26] him amen am the Overcomer of
[2:03:31] L God said you'll St with
[2:03:35] me and I'll with you brother Bram said
[2:03:39] that means for the Overcomer God will
[2:03:42] tell you who he
[2:03:44] is and he wants you to tell him who you
[2:03:50] are and the prophet said what a
[2:03:53] wonderful day when I saw I was not the
[2:03:56] child of Charles and El
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:01] Branham but I was a child of
[2:04:04] God and if you're a child of God you
[2:04:08] have the DNA of
[2:04:09] God you the deity of
[2:04:13] God and God says there going to come a
[2:04:16] time you stop talking
[2:04:20] nonsense and just tell me who you
[2:04:25] are he says yes I know there is a time
[2:04:28] of
[2:04:30] contending but there's got to come a
[2:04:32] time when you can see it and how you
[2:04:35] going to see it when Angels minister to
[2:04:42] you amen can you say
[2:04:45] Amen
[2:04:47] Naomi she said to

[2:09:17] God the promise of this hour
[2:09:23] manifest made
[2:09:25] manifest and the prophet said when God
[2:09:28] thought of you in the beginning when God
[2:09:32] thought of you he thought of himself
[2:09:35] being
[2:09:38] tangible so now the full word has
[2:09:41] returned in its full
[2:09:43] power because it's loosed in the even
[2:09:46] time and now it's in full
[2:09:50] manifestation called The Bride of Jesus

[2:18:54] sin God produced a
[2:18:58] bleach God
[2:19:01] knows that you hate the thing you

[2:20:16] pretending that nothing is wrong
[2:20:20] in
[2:20:24] condemnation but there should
[2:20:27] be no
[2:20:29] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[2:20:32] so God knows you hate the things that
[2:20:36] you
[2:20:37] love yeah you love it bad loves
[2:20:41] it good has a
[2:20:45] responsibility become bad but bad is not
[2:20:48] the
[2:20:49] enemy bad is is the
[2:20:58] teacher you're not becoming a
[2:21:00] masterpiece you're not becoming
[2:21:04] a you always were a
[2:21:08] masterpiece this is the unveiling of
[2:21:12] God Amen made no sense made no sense to
[2:21:18] sin if you didn't enjoy it
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:27] so now we have an obstacle to
[2:21:31] overcome brother Brown said what
[2:21:34] happens immediately the black stain is
[2:21:39] gone you take the back
[2:21:42] stain and you put it into
[2:21:45] bleach the black
[2:21:48] ink is turned into to
[2:21:55] bleach the sin was turned
[2:21:59] into
[2:22:04] Grace amen amen just have a think of it
[2:22:08] just go with the quotes just go with the
[2:22:10] quotes brother B said if you put the ink
[2:22:12] into the
[2:22:19] bleach said the ink turns into
[2:22:24] bleach he said the power of the
[2:22:28] bleach reass reassembles the molecules
[2:22:31] of the
[2:22:36] ink it makes it a bleach
[2:22:41] molecule right so the more ink you put
[2:22:43] into the
[2:22:45] bleach the more bleach you get
[2:22:51] [Applause]
[2:22:55] God rich in

[2:23:57] only is to doubt
[2:23:59] it the only sin is to doubt
[2:24:07] yourself have
[2:24:08] confidence in who and what you
