their homes amen the other time i was sharing with some brethren that jesus is going to come and pick the same church that he left on earth in the same condition that he left it in amen the bible talks about the church in the book of acts the brethren used to gather in their homes amen so brother my sister my brother wherever you're gathered he is there with you for it's not the son of man to life there are some blessings for the word of prayer as we go before the throne of grace and precious loving father you are such a wonderful father you are such a wonderful god you are the creator of

you are knowing this immortalist king of glory that he may be lord just a speaker just a vessel that you're going to use to speak unto the hearts of your children lord father repent the word we are going to reload oh the prophet of the age said every man anybody can turn the pages of this spiritual law but it takes the function lord and the leading of the holy spirit oh hallelujah i've remembered one man who said that the whole bible is god is one but he is always having a portion that is god his will for that moment yes father when you bring out that portion of your will to your children in the mighty name of our lord jesus christ we are praying hallelujah you may be saved a little while i want to thank god for for the grace that he has given us together wherever you are my brother my sister unfortunately me i cannot see you but i have some brethren here uh pastor we want to appreciate you thank you very much brethren i do believe that you are blessed by the series which we were having uh really our pastor may the lord bless you actually those are things that i never had about in my life i would read and and you know there were mysteries but we really thank god for for those studies and we believe by the grace of god our precious pastor we are going to continue with with those series but i know that tonight god has something for you amen amen i'm going to ask each one of you those who are here to have your bible and even those that are watching by zoom to have your bibles because we're going to do more of reading the word of god the bible says the heaven and earth shall pass away but his word shall never pass out amen the bible also says that man shall not live by bread but by every one amen so let's stand on our feet as we're going to read two verses and then we shall sit down as we read the rest of the verses as the holy spirit will lead us a last read from the book of genesis from the book of genesis the first chapter amen amen yes one man said that if you're lost yes you want to go back to the beginning amen right where you are where we are now the world is so lost so disturbed superplexed so the answers are to the beginning amen amen so let us go to the beginning and see what god said in this world we are reading from the book of genesis the first chapter and then the 11th verse then after that we shall go to the book of first john then we shall get some simple reading there then we shall take her 6. i believe a sound is good and it is loud and clear i'm going to try to project myself very well so that you can hear me well amen the bible says and god said let the earth bring forth grass they have yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth if the bible is yours you can we're going to look at these two words after it's kind and then they see it amen and then let us run very quickly to the book of first john chapter 3 and we shall pick from we shall be from verses two we shall read verse two and nine but for your person already you can you can you can you can read further in your free time uh the letter of john 1st john chapter 3 i'm going to read verses 2 and verses 9. the bible says beloved now i love this last now are we the sons of god amen now away the sons of god my sister liz is asking but me and my sister yes you're also among this the man we are the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know we know what we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen for we shall see him as he whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god god amen may the lord bless the reading of this world you may be silent amen we have read the first verse in the bible when god first created the bible says that when he created everything he commanded it to produce its kind amen and in everything that god created he put a seed and it was that seed oh it is that seed which has the power and the capacity to produce its own yes and even as we are tonight a jackfruit tree is still producing jackfruits a pineapple is still producing pineapple it would be a mystery if you were working in your garden one morning and you find a banana plant bringing casaba my brother you will make the longest love amen it will be so bad so weird you don't even fear it when you meet a banana plant producing cassava why it would have gone against the original command it was given amen how many believe you are the seed of god oh hallelujah you believe it my sister you believe it my brother if you are the seed of god then it means even you you must produce what you must produce of your kind what is your kind if you see you are a seed of god it means they're all so good all right it means you should produce things which pertain to god amen amen we are just getting started we shall get it there now when we went to the first book of john brother john here said that a beloved and the today brother held me by the help of the holy spirit is saying that beloved now we are the sons of god not tomorrow not yesterday not in the future now amen why are we sons of god because in the verse we have read the bible has confirmed that every plant will produce of its kind god produces god a cow produces amen now he says now we are the sons of god and then he saying and it does not yet appear a little bit confused a liar sometimes you do this sometimes you do the other sometimes but he says here it does not yet appear when you look at yourself and you read this verse it does not yet appear isn't it brothership when you look at yourself and the bible says now you're the son of god it does not yet happen but let me tell you what the bible says we but we know when he shall appear yes we shall be like i am just trying we're just going to remind ourselves something very small you know the world right now is shouting too much things are shouting too much politics poverty coronavirus education very many things are shouting that it is very possible to forget the instance the reason the meaning as to why we are living in this place that's right the bible says where he shall appear we shall be like him that is solely solely the reason as to why we're here when adam and eve sinned in the garden of eden and the god chest them out now this is what god did when he had started the garden of eden he had created a home for him and his children that's right but then when it was disturbed and it is not that it came to him by my question no but when things happen what he did the prophet of the state says that he created a loop of time and then this garden of eden he removed it here and then he shifted somewhere where we called the millennium are we together so in the middle here we are just people who are just actually i love these words i'm a pilgrim and that stranger my brother my sister wherever you are whatever you're doing whatsoever is making you cry whatsoever is discouraging you whatsoever is really strangling your life you are a pilgrim and a stranger but in this journey our goal is to be like him in him amen amen why because if we are the seed of god we must produce of our that's true okay amen yes that is why the bible says that even nature now grows why does it groan it was created to bring forth a life it was created to do this it was great to do that but when it looks around oh i am a geographer to challenge me to some geography when the mangoes when the jackfruit when the banana when they look around at what they are supposed to produce it is distorted it is not good man talking it is not good jack food it is not good pineapple why because the world has been polluted that's right there has been a soil election there has been so long exhaustion so bringing forth of the kind it's as if it is becoming a night man you knew down and said lord i shall be like you bad i am still so weak i can't even pray i carry am i speaking to somebody amen that is not my sermon we were just introducing men it is going to be very brief when it shall appear nature is groaning what is making nature groaning it is also making children grow that's right and because of this groaning right now in the world oh nature some nature is forgetting the inspiration the reality the reason as to why you see it when you look here you're groaning when you look here you're groaning when you looking southwest i remember the scripture where the man of the prophet of god went to the valley and it was all full of dry bones oh if this is not a time where life itself has become god amen but we have come to remind ourselves yes sir as things are making us grown in the spirit in the physical as the world is quitting us we should not forget that's right amen hallelujah i'm going to talk about a man called job for if you want to write my heading the expression of god is confidence in the seed amen the expression of god's confidence in the sea when god created these seeds and he told them to produce of their kind he meant it and he finished it amen and god trusts every plant god trusts every seed that it must amen god has confidence in his seed that they will produce that life yes yes when he shall appear we shall be like him but when we look at us when we look at the world when we look at what is making growing we fall down paul said i'm we are beaten down and actually i don't know how he said beaten but not destroyed struck down god has confidence in his sin am i talking to the seed of god in this world if you are a seed of god god has confidence in you amen hallelujah don't be like these people who say if god is god why did he kill satan so that we live on this earth just he did not kill him because he knew that nothing you will bear just fruit yes amen john chapter 1 we're going to talk to look briefly at this man the way god was so confident the way god was so confident in him that's true job chapter one we're going to read some few verses very very quickly tell your neighbor god has confidence in the sea that it will bring forth of its kind that you bring forth sisters god has confidence in you amen that you will produce god that you will walk and people are seeing god working my sister amen amen god has confidence in what in his who is there in the book of job this is one of the actually i heard that job is it is the oldest book in the bible zumba is it true okay brother and i said yes it's okay we shall go let us read together bravely please let us read together there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect when i was writing my notes there are words which i was underlining that the bible is your bible right the words which i was what i'm arriving and i want you to follow closely as we look at these words job was perfect who was giving this testimony we're going to find our show job was perfect and accurate and the one that feared god number one job was perfect upright and he feared god amen this word excuse i was looking for another translation but in uganda it says which one can i use excuse he let me give an example yes which one let me give an example like you are a student polycarp at school and there is a dance at school to turn aside or to depart oh thank you god bless you my pastor job he was perfect he was upright he feared god now there is something here they are saying that he turned aside so it means he was at the level that he could be sound and say playing football for a believer football is good but we've been playing something might happen going at the bottom when you look at it but the things there [Music] amen the matter says i put him together he turned away it means you can turn away you can turn away from evil leave along this gospel which is going in the dominion denomination one no one is perfect who told you who told me i translated a message which was called try brother branham was giving man in the bag amen he turned away now we're going to skip that part and and and we go to buses 6 verse 6 says now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and the satan came also among them yes oh my god have mercy on amen how many sons of god do not go before the lord the bible is saying that satan went let us believe that and the lord is saying i'm too certain winds cometh down then suddenly i said the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth let me tell you brethren i'm not going to read everything here when i was writing here i said you are being watched that's right the bible says that the devil gave input i said you know when i woke up this morning i went to africa [Music] the story you know it's down there that's true i went here i went there in there okay he was giving a report but let me tell you the report he was giving it was a report a spy network report that's right somebody is watching you my sister [Music] you are being watched there is a verse here we are okay let us read it so that we can make it clear 2 chronicles 69 2 chronicles 16 9 2 chronicles 69 it says for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth amen the devil is giving a report of moving from where to and from god here is giving a report that he moves to and fro amen the bible says in the book of mercy that lord i am with you amen until the end of the days hallelujah what is god which is making you feel as if you're left alone let me tell you some many years ago a preacher preached a message and he called it that god hides himself by being very near i was reading a book one day and they say the best way of parenting make your children think you are very far yet you are very nervous make them think that is going to oh the eyes of the lord my brother my sister they are moving to and fro he is watching you brother you are not alone i love this song why he is with us amen hallelujah the son of god the sunshine of god which must help the plant to bring forth of its kind it is here amen [Music] that is why he has confidence in you yes sir the bible talks about the scripture somewhere in corinthians it says that there is no temptation which comes to mind and it is not for men it is some it comes like that but then he said that in every temptation he will create for you an escape why is red adverse that's right in every situation because he is there he will create for you and escape my brother my sister hallelujah who told you that it is only the white man who made the planes and put an escape pod god has confidence in his sin the bible says when you read down here the bible says that god gave that therefore authority to go and touch him he gave them what the authority why because he has confidence in his seed am i preaching jesus amen you will bring forth of your kind hallelujah the bride is going to manifest god in this age amen amen i love this verse which says not by power yes son not by night amen amen god has confidence in you my brother yes you will not die yes young you will not backslide amen oh my brother my sister amen it is not colonel which has your plan that's right right now hallelujah amen people are soon actually brother branham preached a message why are people so toast about why are you just my sister is there no bomb in garriad is there no physician in their hand i love the messenger pastor preached some time back about esther and he was talking about the uniques and the place where they were amen we are in the unix chambers sometimes they come with a knife to cut off the nails which are being asked but if god is in control it was the king who had ordered them to clean the bride hallelujah the bible says when he shall appear amen we shall be like him amen amen why are you fearing my brother why are you fearing my sister who told me that dedication is the meaning of life when education is here or it is not there we shall not come amen why are you crying with unbelievers can you imagine if you find it a purple tree crying together with a banana with the jackfruit even the devil himself he cannot do anything to the seed of god yes that's right amen i feel like preaching prejudice amen amen i was a little bit down the other day and i was you know let me tell you as god has breaches and as god as the spirit the devil is a very good deed we call this word the devil is very good at the copy and the best complicated summon and the man said dear god my sister don't give up amen some of you are playing very bad prayer let me die let me go out of the marriage let me do this let me do that let me do this don't listen to that amen the bible says who's the report yes shall we be that's right the greatest ever let me tell you one day the devil came and preached to our lord jesus christ very powerful someone that anointed very anointed someone in matthew chapter four is it chapter four look for he preached to him as someone prosperity what are they talking about he preached the prosperity of someone today the devil is preaching to christians the prosperity how god has failed you how god is disappointed you oh my brother my sister the bible says somewhere down here we have not read that in that job they did not sin before god that's right it is just down the way with me why somewhere there he says i know married to you how you are going to fail how you're going to die young how you will not marry or get married oh my brother preach to him amen another coach you can give him let me tell you the bible says resist the devil and he will free from you you people i love brother branham very much because it was a missing message that i realized that the depot is just a blast yes amen

made a mistake god never made a mistake to make the jack fruit the way jesus he was very sure that it has within its potential to bring forth its kind there is a song i love so much there is a word which which says that we shall sing a song and the angels will breathe give me a seat they will be asking for cheers god never did put you in this edge my brother yes let me tell you something what is happening now in the world it is not a coincidence don't think that god is god [Laughter] what is happening in sister jerusalem what is happening in brother baloney no he's not watching music to see amen amen he is the alpha amen he is the beginning the bible says that he knows the end from the beginning my brother joseph my sister joseph there i know you are in potiphar's house and things are not good i know you are in that prison and things are really so basic so bad but let me tell you a secret the bible says that when the fish swallowed who this man was called jonah we amen hallelujah [Applause] amen but let me tell you a secret that knows your condition came to the fish and then the angel directed the fish and all they have the best way to go and do your work vomiting checking that man where you're supposed to go you did not get it that fish took this man to where he was supposed to be amen [Applause] [Music] the prison doors the prison it was just on the same road to the promised land yes jesus amen amen amen the prison was just a train let me tell you do you know how it would have been so hard for david to get connected to anybody from the state house do you know how it is hard to even know the cook in the president's state house that's right so god planned his thing and he said the only way that my son can get connection to the state house is through the prison amen amen the bible says that the end of job was more bigger was more blessed than the beginning the situation which the devil brought to him it only brought a higher dimension the house guard job to this joseph who was only a trail away to his so what fish what fish my brother what what are you seeing around you let me tell you there are days you wake up and when you look around you're only seeing fish swallow the days you sit down and when you look around you're only seeing prison pass the bible says bitter he was praising but he was praising within a prison oh praising god is very good but i don't know how it sounds when you are in prison when you don't know the next meal when you don't know the next destination from where you are when you don't know what the future holds one man said i don't know what the future holds but thank god i know who holds the future amen amen god has confidence god can never forsake his people in america the children of israel misinterpreted god israel god wants to prove to the devil that even if he does what and what and what and what and what he will bring forth junk fruit amen no matter what he does he does not have power to change the

color of your father and you told me that we came to build the parishes if you have them hallelujah i love a verse in the book of hebrews that is one of my favorite verses that these people walked on this earth but it did not deserve them who has read that verse there is so many bruises you are talking about these giants that they walked on this earth and they did not deserve they looked at the naked women they just preached to them they looked at the negative and i did what preached to them this is what we are doing yesterday at the swimming pool we looked at the negative guns we didn't ask for the hours of number no yes who asked for example no but we preached today amen amen hallelujah hebrews 11 38 oh thank you very much please let us read that verse because it is talking about you my sister and me i love this verse this is my biggest prayer verse i want to live on this earth that i that i reach a moment the bible says that enough moved with god in sin and we are ghana he moved the forces of gravity said that we don't understand this man amen we must live on this earth until when the forces of gravity will fail and then we shall release hallelujah amen we are just going home amen we should live yes the world was not worthy they wondered in difference some of us were anyway that it is the time we cried the loudest the bible says there was a woman called because she was innocent when she was just in the desert what did the god do he brought forth a spring of wood there was a verse in isaiah he said that i'll make a highway in the desert that's right why do you cry my sister my brother when you're in the desert do you want that where in shelton do you see they wandered in deserts all mighty men of god in the bible and even here they wonder the death man amen my brother my sister probably right now i'm talking about you if you're wondering in the desert let me tell you the bible says that he will make a heart within the wilderness underneath mountains the god of the mountain is the god of the valley when things go wrong he will make them [Music] this is where the seed was moving in the mountains in the dams brotherhood i don't like the elsewhere don't like

bringing totally nothing let me give you something news the bible says every tree that bear is not fruit oh my god you must be of your kind the world is sustaining unfortunately the fasting world is fasting with you oh god my brother my sister god was not confused no i think he made a mistake to create in this evil age now the problem is this some of you people when you got saved when you received this message you thought you're going to to sleep for the bed of roses you're going to eat from silver crackers oh yes you will sleep on bed you will eat on the silver platters but sometimes the devil tells me when jesus was nailed on the cross this man came say is this man dead is he really dead is he dead so they came with a spear javelin let me tell you one of these days my sister not a prophet one of these days my brother their pharisees they services yes the roman officials will come and see whether jesus is dead they will come and pierce you to see are you dead oh is the jesus in you alive you know this man who played that movie played it well the water and blood came out that's true when the devil pierces you to see are you dead oh you are living again the bible said that when the devil gets out of his person it goes and it wanders and then it comes back to church [Laughter] he gave us a testimony but you know my brother brother praying so much in the spirit all the time in the market he's asking for [Laughter] [Laughter] the bible says when lazarus died when another stood what died their these diseases they wanted to kill jesus why in order to to to kill the testimony i need to read that part you know some of you read qurans if you're a bible reader the bible says that when letters was dead they wanted to kill jesus they wanted to kill the testimony and read it they wanted to kill the testimony when jesus was on hanged up the devil came and checked so sometimes these things which come and choke and choke and choke and joke and choke and choke you dance for us you think the brother is in the spirit we think you're in the spirit you're in the spirit my brother my sister let the devil drop you i love the message there is a quote i read which says that we are victorious even in the grave a believer is victorious yes even in the grave do you know why the devil sees a grave for me i see a door that's true me i see what no god has confidence in his children amen go amen told the saturn go touch everything there is a path i didn't read there's a part i didn't read he told me touch everything tell your neighbor the devil will come and detach everything we'll touch everything but i told you i read for you two scriptures when scripture the devil was moving to and through another scripture the eyes of god were moving to um the message

very quickly so it is very good for 8 178 okay it says now remember god has counted you worthy when you have a test nobody thank you for saving me i thought nobody will save me the prophet over there was saying when you have a test god has counted you one amen my brother my sister you have a test here the test brother maggie brother kevin bear the test that's right my brother you don't know what to hold on the prophet joseph by the time god brings the test he has already counted you earth i am a teacher by profession not my bystander you cannot give students a test unless you know you have talked to them amen amen you don't give senior false candidates an exam until when you are very sure that they are ready to sit for the exam yes so when the test comes my brother dance that is why they say offer a sacrifice of place you know it is a sacrifice you don't have food in there things are so bad and then that is when you shout the loudest amen it is because he has counted you no no no [Music] so it means what did job say the bible says that he worshipped we didn't read that part you really he worship when everything the children the houses the land everything he worshipped and i now in heaven god was saying god called that saturday called him calling him karim this part is going his practice the man was down he was dying worshipping the devil came on the screen he's not the man with the cast he's not the man we will denounce he told the man who leaves the home he's not the man who is glory to god [Music] how many of you have been in a windy situation when this when the wind is too much what do you do you look for the nearest finger hold it so tight that's right so when the wind was so much for job what did he do he held the entire test and said i know amen amen when you have a tribe oh a test it shows the grace of god has followed didn't have a child there you go eat even he only comes because god only allows him because he found me wealth that is why brethren you should not speak very many words when brethren are going through tough things yes please hold your peace hold your peace somebody is an examination room that's right audio god brings this because he has found you was he he's he has confidence shame that he will go through that path amen he has what confidence it is the only word which can give you chloroquine you know color paint roller queen

ladies and gentlemen i want to announce to you the verse we started with saving when he shall appear we shall be like now when god looked on us this man was outstanding hey romans chapter 12 verses 2 do not be confirmed he did not look like anybody around amen he was different and god knew it and he knew it and he knew it amen he said no one is like him this is the testimony at this time that is where the gravitational force will no longer hold us here yes this is the testimony there is nobody like henry amen amen he is a perfect man he is my pride oh god when god looks at you is he looking at his bride is he looking at his joy my sister at the windows where is there at your workplace my brother when god looks at you is he looking at his bride or is he looking at his joy oh somebody can
