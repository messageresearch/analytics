[1:47:57] can and if musicians can always take the
[1:48:00] front seats I would appreciate I have
[1:48:02] three there and one
[1:48:06] there that's
[1:48:08] good wonderful praise the Lord amen oh
[1:48:13] these ones want to remain
[1:48:17] here shall We
[1:48:20] Stand we would like to just right away
[1:48:22] go to the
[1:48:25] I have a meeting with the musicians
[1:48:27] right after the
[1:48:33] service
[1:48:36] amen
[1:48:38] um I have an announcement which is not
[1:48:41] yet
[1:48:44] ready um we we we received communication
[1:48:47] from Bethany High School that they are
[1:48:50] going to be marking
[1:48:52] is going to be marking at their
[1:48:58] Center Unfortunately they received
[1:49:00] communication from a bit
[1:49:08] late and so they will not be able to uh
[1:49:12] host
[1:49:15] us for this year for this coming
[1:49:18] year but also the good news
[1:49:21] is and for those of you who have not
[1:49:23] been attending services or even
[1:49:24] streaming you're hearing this for the
[1:49:26] first time but I announced this on
[1:49:32] Friday yes I thought you didn't
[1:49:36] hear interpret everything you hear not
[1:49:39] what you understand but what I say thank
[1:49:41] you so um on um on on Friday I talked
[1:49:45] about
[1:49:47] it and um uh the good news is we have a
[1:49:51] new place
[1:49:55] and a better
[1:49:57] place that night I I I was just in
[1:50:02] prayer and praying for uh the the Youth
[1:50:06] Camp youth
[1:50:08] meetings and then I received those news
[1:50:11] in the
[1:50:12] morning I said Lord it can't be I was
[1:50:16] praying God provide
[1:50:18] provide for the Youth
[1:50:20] meetings and communicate in the morning
[1:50:23] oh we no long have the
[1:50:26] place God is this the way you
[1:50:29] provide and you know we were having a
[1:50:31] deficit of 13
[1:50:34] million apart from what you have
[1:50:37] pledged and what we expect the young
[1:50:39] people to bring when they
[1:50:41] come so we having a deficit of about 13
[1:50:46] million but um so when we go to the new
[1:50:50] place that God provided
[1:50:53] it is just right here on
[1:50:56] road not far from
[1:50:59] UNS uh you know the they we we are still
[1:51:04] in these
[1:51:06] discussions but it is likely that they
[1:51:08] are going to charge us an overall of 4
[1:51:11] Millions for the three
[1:51:16] days and this place which we we had was
[1:51:20] requesting for 9 million
[1:51:24] so it means if we have this
[1:51:26] place mil God would have given us 5
[1:51:33] million so that
[1:51:35] means it was the hand of provision of
[1:51:37] the
[1:51:39] Lord so sometimes you pray a prayer and
[1:51:41] God answers in a way you never
[1:51:46] expected but always trust
[1:51:48] God trust God so let's keep trusting God
[1:51:53] behind this vision of these youth
[1:51:56] meetings and we believe that it will be
[1:51:58] a
[1:51:59] success the devil is not happy and so
[1:52:02] he's fighting it but let us also keep
[1:52:06] fighting the
[1:52:07] devil and believe in
[1:52:10] God amen amen let us go to the Book of
[1:52:13] Romans chapter
[1:52:16] 11 I I want all the musicians here
[1:52:19] because I'm having even a meeting with
[1:52:20] them afterwards and I see one of them
[1:52:22] there and I have some free
[1:52:26] chairs right
[1:52:28] here come and sit with your
[1:52:33] daughter God bless you brother
[1:52:37] Peter you know musicians sometimes they
[1:52:40] play very well and then they go behind
[1:52:41] there and they begin dozing
[1:52:45] throughout and
[1:52:47] afterwards they want to come back and
[1:52:51] play we want to be sober
[1:52:56] throughout I'm not saying you do I'm
[1:52:58] saying
[1:53:00] sometimes let us go to the Book of
[1:53:02] Romans chapter
[1:53:04] 11 ver
[1:53:11] 29 for the gifts and calling of God are
[1:53:15] without repentance
[1:53:30] amen let us
[1:53:32] pray Lord we have just read one
[1:53:34] verse out of the book of Romans but
[1:53:37] there are many things in our heart that
[1:53:39] we want to
[1:53:40] today may you inspire us Lord and help
[1:53:44] us today that whatever will be say will
[1:53:48] edify your
[1:53:49] children but we ask this blessing in
[1:53:52] Jesus
[1:53:55] you may have your seats
[1:53:57] please so to you who are coming to dvf
[1:54:00] the first
[1:54:03] time I'm
[1:54:04] saying um feel
[1:54:09] relaxed here we just love the message we
[1:54:11] are
[1:54:13] free and uh just feel at
[1:54:17] home I spoke on this um the last time I
[1:54:21] spoke the last time I preached
[1:54:24] I believe it was on
[1:54:26] Wednesday but there is a lot on this
[1:54:29] subject but I feel that we all need to
[1:54:32] to
[1:54:34] learn the pattern for every true
[1:54:38] Ministry I know I preached on this
[1:54:40] sometime um sometime maybe a year
[1:54:44] ago so maybe this will be a part
[1:54:48] three the pattern for every true
[1:54:50] Ministry
[1:54:54] so here the scripture tells us and we're
[1:54:55] just going to get right in I'll not be
[1:54:57] long this morning I don't plan on being
[1:55:00] long but how many have a hunger for the
[1:55:04] word amen we have come that we may be
[1:55:09] filled so I'm requesting that your heart
[1:55:11] will be
[1:55:13] here your mind will be
[1:55:15] here your spirit will be
[1:55:18] here like your body is
[1:55:21] here so avoid moving out
[1:55:26] unnecessarily um I believe every adult
[1:55:29] can really sit for the one hour or one
[1:55:31] hour and a half
[1:55:34] that without going
[1:55:37] out I have understood from the Deacon
[1:55:40] some people just go out to pick phone
[1:55:45] calls I think that is
[1:55:47] Unbecoming for a
[1:55:50] Believer it's a shame actually
[1:55:53] you know for you to come into the church
[1:55:56] and then you keep your phone on
[1:55:59] vibration so that when they call you you
[1:56:01] go
[1:56:04] out it's not
[1:56:06] right it doesn't it means if you do that
[1:56:09] you are not here
[1:56:12] 100% but I believe we should be here
[1:56:16] 100% mind soul
[1:56:19] Spirit or I should say Body Soul spirit
[1:56:24] yeah and we should
[1:56:27] focus on what God is speaking to
[1:56:31] us and even even now as I
[1:56:35] speak check your
[1:56:37] phone if it's not in
[1:56:41] silence or airplane
[1:56:44] mode please do put it in Airplane
[1:56:48] modee uh so that you can focus
[1:56:53] how many are going to
[1:56:56] focus ask your neighbor you going to
[1:57:00] focus are you going to focus okay what
[1:57:03] did your neighbor
[1:57:05] say amen I love preaching to a focus
[1:57:10] congregation because then God does many
[1:57:13] wonderful
[1:57:14] things forg and and calling of God are
[1:57:19] without repentance
[1:57:28] now I
[1:57:37] think amen you know God just gives you
[1:57:41] the
[1:57:42] gifts and he calls
[1:57:45] you and you don't need to
[1:57:47] repent repentance is not a necessity
[1:57:53] for you to have
[1:57:55] gifts or to be called by
[1:57:58] God and because you know this is a very
[1:58:01] uh important
[1:58:04] subject many people think because
[1:58:07] someone has a
[1:58:09] gift automatically this person is filled
[1:58:12] with the Holy
[1:58:13] Spirit someone can actually have a
[1:58:16] gift and may even not be a
[1:58:20] believer some someone may speak
[1:58:24] tongues when he an
[1:58:27] adter someone may interpret
[1:58:30] tongues someone may
[1:58:32] preach when they have never met
[1:58:35] God and this has been a stumbling block
[1:58:38] to many
[1:58:41] Christians because we thought that when
[1:58:44] someone if someone can serve
[1:58:47] God it is
[1:58:50] automatic that they are man or a woman
[1:58:53] of
[1:58:55] God but that is not
[1:58:57] true and that is why today I wanted us
[1:59:01] to look at the
[1:59:03] pattern for every true
[1:59:07] Ministry so that means not all that have
[1:59:11] a
[1:59:12] Ministry is a true
[1:59:17] Ministry there is a true
[1:59:19] Ministry and a false Ministry
[1:59:23] but how can we know the true
[1:59:25] Ministry there is a
[1:59:27] pattern that we can find in the
[1:59:30] scripture that if that kind of
[1:59:34] ministry has that pattern within
[1:59:37] it then that is a true
[1:59:39] Ministry and when I talk about a
[1:59:43] Ministry I mean a
[1:59:46] minister okay now Ministry is different
[1:59:51] Ministries you may be a minister but not
[1:59:53] a
[1:59:54] preacher but I'm also speaking about
[1:59:58] preachers I'm speaking about
[2:00:00] churches I'm speaking about um you know
[2:00:03] other kind of Ministries as
[2:00:06] well I'm talking about you know a father
[2:00:11] it's a Ministry mother it's a Ministry
[2:00:15] wife is a Ministry husband is a
[2:00:18] Ministry you know we have other you know
[2:00:23] Ministries singing
[2:00:25] Min you know and all these other gifts
[2:00:28] that we have in our Min they're all
[2:00:33] ministering musical
[2:00:35] instruments uh players they all
[2:00:38] ministers deons and
[2:00:40] ministers and you know older mothers
[2:00:43] older men
[2:00:45] mothers you know Minister supposed to be
[2:00:48] ministering to the younger women
[2:00:52] and I spoke about that on on
[2:00:54] Wednesday um we have Sunday school
[2:00:57] teachers those are ministers as well
[2:01:00] some of them are sisters others are
[2:01:04] brothers and other you know media
[2:01:07] department and all these
[2:01:10] departments brother here works on the
[2:01:13] projector so that you can be able to see
[2:01:15] the songs so that you can sing where is
[2:01:19] ministering someone comes to s sweep and
[2:01:22] clean
[2:01:23] and he is a minister you're minister so
[2:01:27] there are many ways to
[2:01:29] minister so when I am talking about
[2:01:31] Ministry don't only think about the
[2:01:33] preaching
[2:01:35] ministry as much as that is the
[2:01:39] main so now we will get into the
[2:01:43] details so now I want us to First deal
[2:01:46] with Matthew
[2:01:48] 7 if you can turn with me to your Bibles
[2:01:52] in the Book of Matthew
[2:01:55] 7 uh vers
[2:02:00] 18 amen amen and I know there are some
[2:02:04] uh brothers from the north of Ethiopia
[2:02:06] that usually follow our services I send
[2:02:08] my greetings our greetings to
[2:02:14] them we are looking at Matthew 7:
[2:02:19] 18 and I want you to listen
[2:02:22] a okay can you read with with me brother
[2:02:25] a good tree
[2:02:28] bringeth not forth good fruit okay let
[2:02:31] me read again I was reading verses 19
[2:02:33] I'm reading vers 18 a good tree cannot
[2:02:36] bring forth evil fruit neither can a
[2:02:39] corrupt tree bring forth good
[2:02:48] fruit um every tree that bringeth not
[2:02:51] forth good fruit is H down and cast Into
[2:02:54] the
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:03:00] Fire and you know on verses 15 he had
[2:03:02] told us to be aware of false
[2:03:07] prophets they come in ship's
[2:03:10] clothing but
[2:03:12] inwardly they are ring
[2:03:15] walls so and he said we shall know them
[2:03:17] by their
[2:03:19] fruits and then he begins to explain the
[2:03:23] tree and he says every tree that brings
[2:03:25] not good fruit that one is corrup every
[2:03:28] tree sorry every every so every good
[2:03:31] tree bringeth forth good
[2:03:34] fruit but a corrupt one brings evil
[2:03:38] fruit and he said that good tree cannot
[2:03:41] bring forth evil
[2:03:44] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[2:03:47] forth good
[2:03:49] fruit every tree that bringeth not this
[2:03:52] is verse 19 not fourth good fruit is H
[2:03:55] down and cast Into the
[2:03:59] Fire wherefor by their fuits you shall
[2:04:02] know
[2:04:04] them not everyone that saith unto me now
[2:04:09] he progresses from speaking about a
[2:04:14] tree and he begins to talk about
[2:04:18] people
[2:04:20] ministers
[2:04:22] Believers so he's saying they are like a
[2:04:26] tree and by the way the word tree in the
[2:04:28] Bible language means person or
[2:04:35] people that is why in The Book of Psalms
[2:04:37] chapter 1 verse
[2:04:39] one it speaks about a man that walks not
[2:04:43] in the councel of the
[2:04:48] unod and then he says it shall be like a
[2:04:51] tree
[2:04:53] planted by the rivers of
[2:04:55] water so you remember the Genesis was
[2:04:58] also speaking about a
[2:05:01] tree the Tree of
[2:05:04] Life the tree of life is not a physical
[2:05:09] tree
[2:05:11] person a man the person of
[2:05:15] Life the man of
[2:05:18] life and he came on Earth and he said
[2:05:23] I am the
[2:05:26] life that was Jesus he came and
[2:05:30] declared that he is the
[2:05:33] life so we know the tree of life is a
[2:05:36] man then also in the Book of
[2:05:39] Revelation he says to him that shall
[2:05:42] overcome I will give him to eat of the
[2:05:46] tree of
[2:05:47] life so the Tree of Life can be eaten
[2:05:52] and Jesus when he was on
[2:05:54] Earth he said this
[2:05:57] words he said he that cannot eat my
[2:06:01] flesh or drink my
[2:06:04] blood is not worthy of me so you mean
[2:06:07] you can eat
[2:06:09] Jesus and drink Jesus they were
[2:06:13] offended and they moved away but they
[2:06:16] did
[2:06:17] understand that he was not meaning
[2:06:19] physical eating
[2:06:22] how do you eat from a
[2:06:25] tree you eat by
[2:06:29] hearing Jesus said my flesh is meat
[2:06:35] indeed my blood is drink
[2:06:39] indeed so he meant we should eat his
[2:06:43] flesh but his
[2:06:46] flesh is the
[2:06:48] word and his his blood
[2:06:52] is the
[2:06:53] spirit so you see when you eat the
[2:06:56] word right now all of us we are eating
[2:06:59] the word now so pull out your FKS
[2:07:02] brother pull out your spiritual
[2:07:05] knife pull out the
[2:07:07] spoons let us begin eating the
[2:07:11] word amen amen so you should be on your
[2:07:15] nerves
[2:07:18] ready there are those who fight for food
[2:07:20] outside
[2:07:22] they want
[2:07:24] big they want to be in front but when we
[2:07:28] come to church they don't want to be in
[2:07:31] front you have to be in front you to be
[2:07:34] on deep to to eat big big pieces
[2:07:37] Hallelujah I want a big
[2:07:40] pce hallelujah amen his flesh is meat
[2:07:44] indeed so as you are hearing you are
[2:07:48] eating the
[2:07:49] word and then he fills you with the
[2:07:52] spirit you
[2:07:55] drinking hallelujah amen so we realize
[2:08:00] here that's why also the tree of
[2:08:03] knowledge of Good and Evil was also a
[2:08:08] person and we realize who it
[2:08:11] was it was
[2:08:13] Satan and eve took took a piece out of
[2:08:18] it the Bible says she ate the fruit out
[2:08:20] of it
[2:08:23] and until
[2:08:25] today until today we are
[2:08:28] suffering because of
[2:08:30] that now the devil is so
[2:08:33] cunning that even
[2:08:36] today he is having
[2:08:39] pictures that he has made the angels of
[2:08:44] light this is one of the most important
[2:08:48] summons and I want you to be attentive
[2:08:52] the devil knows if he comes to you as
[2:08:56] Satan and he says I am Satan believe
[2:09:00] me all of you will run
[2:09:02] away so he can't come to you as
[2:09:06] SAT but the Bible says and give us the
[2:09:10] scripture brother that he has made
[2:09:13] himself the angel of
[2:09:18] Light Amen in second Corinth
[2:09:23] 11
[2:09:28] 14 for Satan
[2:09:32] himself is
[2:09:36] transformed into an angel of
[2:09:41] Light tell your neighbor Satan has
[2:09:46] transformed an Ang of
[2:09:49] light therefore
[2:09:51] it is no great
[2:09:54] thing if his
[2:10:00] ministers
[2:10:02] transformed as the Ministers of
[2:10:07] righteousness whose end shall be
[2:10:10] according to their
[2:10:15] works and give us verse 13 it says for
[2:10:19] such a false apostles
[2:10:24] deceitful
[2:10:26] workers transforming
[2:10:29] themselves into the Apostles of
[2:10:33] Christ so we realize
[2:10:36] here child of God
[2:10:38] listen Satan is not coming as
[2:10:43] Satan Satan is coming to you as a
[2:10:46] preacher of the Bible
[2:10:51] we should fear more than
[2:10:54] anything is the preachers of the
[2:10:58] Bible because if you don't have the
[2:11:00] right
[2:11:03] discernment you can go to Hell by
[2:11:05] sitting under a wrong
[2:11:10] Ministry but the Bible say we shall know
[2:11:14] them by their
[2:11:17] works and Jesus in The Book of Matthew
[2:11:21] he talked about a
[2:11:23] tree first of all he says be aware of
[2:11:26] false
[2:11:28] Propet they come in ship's
[2:11:31] clothing but
[2:11:34] inwardly they are ravening
[2:11:39] wolves and then he begins talking about
[2:11:41] a
[2:11:43] tree you know I love
[2:11:45] Jesus the way Jesus
[2:11:48] Tau was so simple
[2:11:51] but so
[2:11:53] powerful but it takes Revelation for you
[2:11:55] to
[2:11:57] understand one day he looks at his
[2:12:00] disciples and he asked them a question
[2:12:03] who do you say I
[2:12:05] am I the son of
[2:12:07] man and they began
[2:12:10] fting they said people
[2:12:13] say where the first question was what
[2:12:15] people say that I
[2:12:17] am and then said people
[2:12:19] say you
[2:12:21] you Isaiah you are
[2:12:24] Jeremiah oh you are one of the prophets
[2:12:28] you are just a
[2:12:29] prophet so people understood that Jesus
[2:12:32] is just a
[2:12:35] prophet until today the Muslims think
[2:12:38] Jesus is just a
[2:12:40] prophet he's just a prophet he's more
[2:12:44] than a
[2:12:46] prophet he is the god of the
[2:12:49] prophets Hallelujah amen and then he
[2:12:52] said what do you say that I the son
[2:12:55] of and he answered Peter answered to
[2:12:59] him he said
[2:13:02] you Jesus Christ the son of the Living
[2:13:07] God that meant if he a Son of God it
[2:13:12] means he is
[2:13:14] God a son of a God is
[2:13:18] God a child of a bir is a
[2:13:23] a child of a snake is a
[2:13:25] snake what about a Son of
[2:13:28] God is
[2:13:30] God are you getting the point amen
[2:13:33] that's why the Bible says you also are
[2:13:36] Gods we are Gods tell your neighbor I am
[2:13:39] a
[2:13:41] God why because the Bible says
[2:13:45] beloved
[2:13:47] now are we the sons of God
[2:13:51] it does not yet
[2:13:53] appear how we shall be but when he
[2:13:57] comes we shall be
[2:14:01] like we are sons of God and our
[2:14:06] works our life should show who we
[2:14:11] are and so we notice he
[2:14:14] Jesus is a simple
[2:14:18] teacher and when he spoke those words
[2:14:21] Jesus told
[2:14:23] Peter flesh and blood has not revealed
[2:14:25] this to you but my Father in Heaven has
[2:14:29] revealed
[2:14:31] this and even
[2:14:33] today understand who Jesus
[2:14:37] is understand the
[2:14:40] word flesh and blood cannot reveal it to
[2:14:44] you you have to enter the
[2:14:47] spirit in the realm of the spirit
[2:14:51] you understand the
[2:14:54] supernatural in the real of the
[2:14:57] spirit you understand the spiritual
[2:15:01] things when you enter into that real
[2:15:04] brother you begin
[2:15:07] Flying high in
[2:15:11] Revelation in
[2:15:14] understanding that is why we see
[2:15:16] sometimes when we are in the
[2:15:18] church some people get crazy
[2:15:21] they begin
[2:15:23] shouting they begin you come
[2:15:26] on they
[2:15:28] cannot something is burning
[2:15:31] up why because they have entered into
[2:15:34] the real of the
[2:15:37] spirit brother when we are hearing the
[2:15:40] word come out of the flesh enter into
[2:15:44] the realm of
[2:15:45] the when you enter the spirit then you
[2:15:49] can see what others are not seeing
[2:15:52] then you can hear more than what is
[2:15:56] saying then the word will be open to
[2:16:00] you and you will begin
[2:16:02] shouting and you'll begin receiving
[2:16:05] it amen you will stand up and say that
[2:16:08] is
[2:16:10] mine but when you begin
[2:16:13] dozing I can tell you are in the
[2:16:16] flesh praise the name of the Lord am I
[2:16:19] want to be in the SP
[2:16:23] slap your neighbor and tell them I want
[2:16:24] to the
[2:16:26] spirit Oh Glory to
[2:16:29] God and so
[2:16:31] Jesus says be aware of false
[2:16:36] prophets and then he goes to the
[2:16:38] teaching of the tree
[2:16:40] again and he
[2:16:42] says a good
[2:16:45] tree cannot bear bad
[2:16:49] fruit but corrupt
[2:16:52] tree bringeth forth evil
[2:16:57] fruit every
[2:16:59] tree that brings not forth good
[2:17:04] fruit is H
[2:17:08] down and cast into the
[2:17:11] fire but I want you to
[2:17:13] remember he said you will know them by
[2:17:16] their
[2:17:19] fruits and Jesus said
[2:17:21] Apostle Paul told
[2:17:23] us from the scripture we read in
[2:17:26] Corinthians that these are transform
[2:17:31] themselves into
[2:17:34] Ministers of
[2:17:36] righteous so let me announce to you this
[2:17:39] morning today as I speak to
[2:17:43] you sat
[2:17:45] also has preachers standing on the
[2:17:49] pulit there is a Pulpit this Sunday
[2:17:54] morning where Satan himself is
[2:17:58] preaching he's using his
[2:18:02] ministers sat has
[2:18:05] ambassadors just like God has
[2:18:09] ambassadors now we are we are getting
[2:18:11] confused Pastor you are confusing us
[2:18:15] Pastor what are you trying to say so
[2:18:18] should we not come to church
[2:18:21] no keep
[2:18:23] coming but mind the church you go
[2:18:27] to amen and it does not matter what they
[2:18:30] say they
[2:18:33] believe because Satan has his ministers
[2:18:39] everywhere hallelujah amen but how shall
[2:18:43] we know
[2:18:44] them oh we are so
[2:18:47] happy we have Jesus
[2:18:51] and his
[2:18:52] word and he has warned us
[2:18:55] before and he has said to us you shall
[2:18:59] know them by
[2:19:03] their amen and now let us now go into
[2:19:06] the explanation of the
[2:19:11] fruit not everyone that saith unto me
[2:19:14] Lord
[2:19:17] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[2:19:19] heaven
[2:19:22] but he oh my God but he that doeth the
[2:19:26] will of the
[2:19:28] Father which is in heaven how many
[2:19:32] remember the service on
[2:19:33] Friday what was the
[2:19:37] title the will of
[2:19:44] God you keep coming to
[2:19:47] services and when you miss a service
[2:19:51] go and listen to
[2:19:52] it because you're missing a
[2:19:55] lot you can't be the same with someone
[2:19:57] who is charging every
[2:20:00] time a preacher came from
[2:20:02] Zambia and he preached to us on the
[2:20:05] subject of the will of
[2:20:09] God the will of God I can't repeat what
[2:20:13] he
[2:20:13] preached listen to it but we find out
[2:20:17] here he says not everyone that says Lord
[2:20:20] Lord Lord
[2:20:24] Lord shall enter into the
[2:20:26] kingdom but only he that do do the will
[2:20:30] of my
[2:20:31] father so how can you do the will of the
[2:20:35] father go and listen to Friday service
[2:20:39] but I will tell you this the will of the
[2:20:42] father is believing the
[2:20:45] truth and receiving the Holy
[2:20:48] Ghost not every preacher has the Holy
[2:20:52] Ghost not every T speaker has the Holy
[2:20:56] Ghost not every pianist has the Holy
[2:21:00] Ghost not every Minister has the Holy
[2:21:05] Ghost there are many who will
[2:21:08] Minister who will
[2:21:10] serve but when they have never been
[2:21:13] filled with the Holy
[2:21:15] Ghost they may even believe the
[2:21:18] message but believing the message does
[2:21:20] not give you the Holy
[2:21:23] Ghost it is only the
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:26] beginning having the right mental
[2:21:30] attitude to the
[2:21:32] word will give you the Holy
[2:21:35] Ghost buing
[2:21:37] yourself will give you the Holy Ghost
[2:21:40] confessing and repenting your
[2:21:43] sins will give you the Holy
[2:21:46] Ghost as long as you still desire your s
[2:21:52] you want to protect your
[2:21:56] lifestyle you have hidden
[2:21:59] secrets your heart is not open to
[2:22:03] God you have not reached to that place
[2:22:06] God
[2:22:08] surrender there are some demons you are
[2:22:11] keeping and other demons you are
[2:22:14] leaving you can never receive the Holy
[2:22:17] Ghost you have to accept
[2:22:21] to expose
[2:22:22] yourself before
[2:22:24] God and then God will fill you with the
[2:22:27] Holy
[2:22:28] Ghost you have to confess your
[2:22:31] sins don't hide your
[2:22:34] sins the Bible says that he that conce
[2:22:39] his
[2:22:40] sin cannot
[2:22:43] Prosper even in this
[2:22:45] life you will make money and money will
[2:22:49] disappear
[2:22:51] even in the spiritual real it will be as
[2:22:53] if you're
[2:22:55] tied and then you'll begin saying I'm
[2:22:57] Bewitched you are bewitching
[2:23:00] yourself by not confessing your
[2:23:04] sins by living a the
[2:23:07] life you are going to
[2:23:10] bars you are still amen addicted to
[2:23:14] alcohol listen you can't receive the
[2:23:16] Holy
[2:23:18] Ghost you are still flatting with
[2:23:21] girls you flatting with
[2:23:24] boys and you are calling yourself a
[2:23:27] Believer you cannot receive the Holy
[2:23:29] Ghost you need to
[2:23:32] decide I am tired of this life I am
[2:23:36] tired of
[2:23:37] sin I am tired of straying
[2:23:40] Lord now I'm coming
[2:23:44] home when you come home
[2:23:46] brother when you come home sister
[2:23:50] God fills you with the Holy
[2:23:53] Ghost but you have to first make a
[2:23:57] decision don't deceive yourself you
[2:24:00] cannot be
[2:24:01] filled if you've not surrendered
[2:24:05] everything and if you are not
[2:24:08] sealed you are not going in the
[2:24:11] Rapture even if you in a message
[2:24:14] church if you are not
[2:24:16] sealed you are being prepared for the
[2:24:19] tribulation
[2:24:22] and the tribulation is
[2:24:25] real and it will be much Fierce to those
[2:24:28] of you I Brother Martin sent me a
[2:24:31] clip of a
[2:24:34] preacher and and he was speaking in a
[2:24:37] very cunning
[2:24:40] way and he was telling the
[2:24:42] people listen to me
[2:24:46] church if you you miss the rapture
[2:24:51] if you miss the
[2:24:53] Rapture now don't
[2:24:57] panic don't
[2:25:00] panic but I'll tell you what you should
[2:25:04] do pack up as much supplies as you
[2:25:08] can find as much food and as much
[2:25:13] water because you will need
[2:25:15] it and find a rock if you have to find a
[2:25:18] rock find a rock
[2:25:21] hide
[2:25:23] there because it's going to be
[2:25:25] terrible but do everything you have to
[2:25:28] do don't receive that Mark of the
[2:25:31] Beast and I was like man is preparing
[2:25:34] the people for the
[2:25:37] tribulation but it was a good advice
[2:25:41] H it was a good advice because the
[2:25:45] Believers who will miss the
[2:25:47] Rapture it will be terrible for them
[2:25:50] that's what they will have to
[2:25:52] do you can't go receiving the mark of
[2:25:54] the

[2:26:10] coming you can't Fellowship
[2:26:12] normally there will be
[2:26:15] churches but it will be the ones that
[2:26:17] are Distributing the mark of the beast
[2:26:21] the message churches will not be in
[2:26:24] existence the message believers who were
[2:26:27] there
[2:26:30] medoc and they do not receive the
[2:26:34] seal they will be hiding and running for
[2:26:36] their

[2:31:17] relationship amen you had a Rel ship
[2:31:20] with my
[2:31:23] gift but you never had a relationship
[2:31:25] with me I never knew you get out before
[2:31:30] me go away and another one will come and
[2:31:35] he will tell him oh in your
[2:31:39] name I went to the people and I cast out
[2:31:43] a bunch of
[2:31:45] demons me I was a very powerful preach
[2:32:07] I kicked all these
[2:32:09] demons I I was a I was having a
[2:32:12] Deliverance
[2:32:15] Ministry Jesus said let me see you did
[2:32:20] in my
[2:32:21] name yes
[2:32:23] Hallelujah it was in your name I
[2:32:27] remember this girl she came demon
[2:32:30] possessed and I simply looked at
[2:32:33] her and I said in the name of Jesus get
[2:32:37] out and this demon began sing
[2:32:41] screaming and went out Jesus I can tell
[2:32:45] you many
[2:32:46] testimonies I have a lot of them
[2:32:50] we even have proof on
[2:32:52] Earth we are recording our
[2:32:56] ministry it was called fire Ministry
[2:32:59] Deliverance
[2:33:01] Min we delivered many
[2:33:04] people the blind
[2:33:07] saw the dead were
[2:33:09] raised I was a Deliverance
[2:33:14] preacher Jesus will say it is
[2:33:17] true that is that is true
[2:33:21] but you and me we never knew each
[2:33:26] other I never knew
[2:33:29] you get out from
[2:33:31] from I want you to to I want you to
[2:33:34] First think about
[2:33:36] that think about that brother
[2:33:40] sister what is heaven going to be
[2:33:44] like is heaven going to be filled with
[2:33:47] miracle workers and signs and
[2:33:52] is that the
[2:33:54] basis upon which you see a true
[2:34:00] Ministry and would say I had many people
[2:34:03] following
[2:34:06] me many Souls
[2:34:10] believe I prophesied in your
[2:34:13] name I did many wonderful
[2:34:16] Works Jesus not one time did he those
[2:34:22] works because listen church as we shall
[2:34:27] see
[2:34:28] later where the name of Jesus is
[2:34:32] called it is
[2:34:35] powerful his word shall
[2:34:38] accomplish the Bible says his word
[2:34:41] cannot return unto him
[2:34:44] voice it shall
[2:34:47] accomplish that which it has been sent
[2:34:49] to
[2:34:51] whether it is a woman
[2:34:53] preacher she can cast that
[2:34:56] demon in the name of Jesus and the
[2:34:59] demons will
[2:35:02] obey do you know that the Bible did not
[2:35:06] say only the men will cast
[2:35:08] Dem the Bible says all those who
[2:35:13] believe they can cast out
[2:35:16] demons so she may be a woman preacher
[2:35:18] even he may be a man he may be a little
[2:35:22] boy and they will indeed cast that
[2:35:25] demon they will have powerful anointed
[2:35:30] Ministries but that is not the basis for
[2:35:34] the
[2:35:36] Rapture they may have been great
[2:35:39] singers they may have been great
[2:35:42] people to be anointed women anointed
[2:35:46] men but listen Church
[2:35:50] that is not the only
[2:35:53] basis anyone let me tell you this the
[2:35:56] word of
[2:35:57] God has
[2:36:00] rules if you apply the
[2:36:04] rule the rule will
[2:36:09] work amen praise the name of the Lord
[2:36:12] you see Nature has
[2:36:16] rules and the rule is
[2:36:21] what is
[2:36:23] up comes
[2:36:25] down it's called a law of
[2:36:33] gravity why it is
[2:36:37] up and it's coming down what is
[2:36:41] happening it's a
[2:36:43] law which one physician
[2:36:47] discovered what was his name
[2:36:52] H Ian Newton Isaac Newton
[2:36:56] Newton thew
[2:36:59] gravity we have many University students
[2:37:02] looking at come on tell me is it Isaac
[2:37:06] newon I was thought it was Isaac Newton
[2:37:10] me I was very poor in my in
[2:37:13] physics Isaac Newton discovered
[2:37:17] it but it was already there
[2:37:21] by
[2:37:22] God he created
[2:37:26] it the law of
[2:37:29] gravity now in the Bible there are other
[2:37:34] laws if you
[2:37:37] give you
[2:37:39] receive if you want to be
[2:37:42] rich you don't become rich by working
[2:37:47] hard according to the Bible
[2:37:50] working is
[2:37:52] right the Bible says You must work if
[2:37:55] you are L he says you will be poor so
[2:37:59] you have to work but getting
[2:38:03] blessed and becoming rich and
[2:38:07] richer actually does not come by
[2:38:11] prayer God make me
[2:38:14] Rich oh God I see myself I'm a milli
[2:38:20] I attract money by
[2:38:24] prayer come to me in the name of Jesus
[2:38:28] and you are praying every
[2:38:30] day you remain
[2:38:33] poor we have some of those
[2:38:37] Brothers I saw one in Ethiopia
[2:38:39] somewhere always on The Prayer
[2:38:42] Mountain he does not want to work you
[2:38:45] give him something to do he
[2:38:47] refuses I feel I should be in
[2:38:50] prayer God is going to give me this God
[2:38:53] is going to do great things money is
[2:38:56] coming and this brother was a very poor
[2:38:59] brother money does not come by
[2:39:03] prayer you see the law is if you plant a
[2:39:08] seed you will the seed will
[2:39:11] grow and it will have many other seeds
[2:39:17] like so what you saw
[2:39:20] that shall ye also
[2:39:23] re that is the law of sewing and
[2:39:27] harvest is that correct Farmers know it
[2:39:31] very
[2:39:31] well but Believers don't know
[2:39:34] it that's why they don't
[2:39:37] give but if you give the Bible says give
[2:39:42] and he shall receive
[2:39:50] overflowing it is the word of
[2:39:53] God but if you give
[2:39:57] sparing you will receive
[2:40:01] sping give
[2:40:03] bountifully give
[2:40:05] generously and he shall receive the
[2:40:09] same that's the right thing we
[2:40:11] believe we believe in sowing that those
[2:40:14] kind of
[2:40:15] seeds if you s kindness you shall reap
[2:40:18] kindness
[2:40:21] if you saw you shall
[2:40:24] receive brother saw the right
[2:40:26] SE if you s hon you shall reap
[2:40:33] access praise the name of the Lord amen
[2:40:36] that is the law of the
[2:40:38] word but we have another
[2:40:41] law that at the name of
[2:40:44] Jesus every knee shall
[2:40:46] bow every tongue shall conf
[2:40:50] that Jesus is
[2:40:51] Lord the name of Jesus is the powerful
[2:40:56] name which is given to us for
[2:40:59] deliverance of out of demons for
[2:41:02] salvation of the sick for healing of the
[2:41:06] sick the name of Jesus is
[2:41:10] above every
[2:41:12] name do you believe that a name above
[2:41:16] every
[2:41:17] name the Bible did not
[2:41:20] say if the Believers
[2:41:23] only they mention the
[2:41:26] name it is for every
[2:41:30] man when they use that
[2:41:32] name it will bring the
[2:41:37] results so you will find a false
[2:41:40] prophet using the name of Jesus and it
[2:41:43] will work I say it will
[2:41:47] work amen why is he
[2:41:50] FSE because he's preaching a wrong
[2:41:54] Doctrine the name of
[2:41:56] Jesus works but Believers don't even
[2:42:00] know how to use
[2:42:03] the And when they see others using it
[2:42:05] and it is
[2:42:07] working then they say those ones went
[2:42:09] under the
[2:42:14] water no we don't need to go under the
[2:42:17] water to get
[2:42:20] power power is in the name of
[2:42:23] Jesus there is
[2:42:26] power in the name of
[2:42:29] Jesus sing with me now there is
[2:42:32] power in the name of
[2:42:35] Jesus what does it do Break Every Chain
[2:42:39] Break Every Chain it breaks Every
[2:42:43] Chain Break Every Chain Break Every it
[2:42:48] breaks
[2:42:50] so you see it's the name how is in the
[2:42:54] name so they receive the
[2:42:57] name in casting out demons they receive
[2:43:00] the name in Deliverance they receive the
[2:43:04] names in prophesying but when it came to
[2:43:08] Salvation of their
[2:43:11] soul they rejected
[2:43:15] the amen the Bible says in book of Acts
[2:43:21] there is no other
[2:43:22] name whereby we can be
[2:43:26] saved by the name of
[2:43:30] Jesus and that name is what we should be
[2:43:34] baptized
[2:43:36] into in The Book of
[2:43:38] Mark 16 ver1 15 he says
[2:43:42] going preach the gospel to every he that
[2:43:46] believes and is baptized
[2:43:49] shall be saved in the book of
[2:43:52] Acts
[2:43:54] 2:38 it says
[2:43:56] repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:44:01] in the
[2:44:02] name of the Lord
[2:44:05] Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ what
[2:44:09] for the remission of your
[2:44:11] sins and he shall
[2:44:14] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:44:19] is the
[2:44:20] promise if you are
[2:44:22] planted in in the likeness of his
[2:44:26] death Romans chapter 6 if you
[2:44:30] planted in the likeness of his death you
[2:44:34] shall be in the
[2:44:37] likeness of his
[2:44:41] resurrection amen hallelujah amen now
[2:44:45] that's where the power of the name is
[2:44:49] that's the power of the
[2:44:51] name and we Believers of this
[2:44:54] message we
[2:44:57] believe in signs and wonders and
[2:44:59] miracles and all those
[2:45:01] things plus water
[2:45:04] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:45:08] Christ what they
[2:45:11] rejected is what will make them not
[2:45:14] enter there
[2:45:19] someone may be a bishop I don't
[2:45:23] care if they were not baptized in the
[2:45:25] name of the Lord Jesus
[2:45:28] Christ they have to Humble
[2:45:31] themselves and go back again in the
[2:45:34] water and be baptized
[2:45:37] again praise the name of the Lord amen
[2:45:39] and then he says your sin shall be
[2:45:43] forgiven and he shall
[2:45:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:45:50] so if you have been baptized in that
[2:45:52] way having repented
[2:45:56] correctly let me say this also I've seen
[2:45:59] many people that I have
[2:46:02] baptized and have received the Holy
[2:46:04] Spirit
[2:46:06] immediately and I've also seen many that
[2:46:09] are baptized and never
[2:46:13] did so why the answer can only be
[2:46:17] one repentance
[2:46:20] is an act done by the
[2:46:24] individual
[2:46:26] baptism is an act done by the
[2:46:30] preacher filling with the Holy Ghost is
[2:46:34] an act done by
[2:46:36] God are you following me now if I do my
[2:46:41] job as a preacher
[2:46:44] correctly and I bapti you in the name of
[2:46:46] the Lord Jesus CHR
[2:46:49] having be repented
[2:46:52] correctly you you have repented
[2:46:57] correctly God has to fill you with
[2:47:01] the but the issue is many people don't
[2:47:06] repent
[2:47:08] correctly repentance is not
[2:47:12] confession repentance is living sin
[2:47:19] if you have been having a
[2:47:21] boyfriend you tell from
[2:47:25] today no
[2:47:28] more before you are
[2:47:31] baptized you have to confess that to him
[2:47:34] tell him I've changed my
[2:47:36] ways I have decided no
[2:47:40] more if I've been drinking
[2:47:43] alcohol you throw it away you from today
[2:47:47] no
[2:47:47] more remember you should have the desire
[2:47:50] for those
[2:47:51] things but you have made it up your
[2:47:55] mind and you want God to fill
[2:47:59] you so the desire can
[2:48:02] die so you have to
[2:48:05] repent repentance is turning
[2:48:09] around if you're going a certain
[2:48:12] direction you decide to turn around and
[2:48:16] go another
[2:48:17] direction that is true
[2:48:20] repentance amen amen now if you have
[2:48:24] truly
[2:48:26] repented you will even be in bitter
[2:48:29] tears before we even go to the
[2:48:32] water and those kind of
[2:48:35] people when I baptize
[2:48:38] them God comes right
[2:48:43] away and he baptizes
[2:48:46] them into the Holy Ghost
[2:48:50] and many of them speak
[2:48:54] tongues others don't but they will have
[2:48:57] a certain
[2:48:58] gift that will manifest in their life
[2:49:01] what I'm saying God must fill you with
[2:49:04] the Holy
[2:49:06] Ghost if you been baptized
[2:49:10] correctly having repented correctly
[2:49:19] are you following me church but many
[2:49:23] they can repent
[2:49:25] correctly they can repent
[2:49:27] correctly and they baptized
[2:49:32] wrongly so God can feel
[2:49:35] them others can may not repent
[2:49:39] correctly and bapti
[2:49:43] correctly and they will never receive
[2:49:44] the
[2:49:45] holy so you see you have a part to
[2:49:50] play what is your
[2:49:54] part if you're still living in sin you
[2:49:57] have not
[2:49:59] repented you are still a
[2:50:01] sinner because you have not
[2:50:03] repented but you have to repent of your
[2:50:06] sin change your
[2:50:08] ways make up your
[2:50:10] mind I will follow
[2:50:14] Jesus when you make up your mind like
[2:50:17] that and I baptized in the name of our
[2:50:19] Lord Jesus Christ you must receive the
[2:50:22] Holy
[2:50:25] Ghost but these preachers and
[2:50:29] ministers they were not working in that
[2:50:33] pattern they rejected the correct
[2:50:36] baptism in the name of Jesus
[2:50:41] Christ Grace will make you to repent of
[2:50:45] your
[2:50:47] sins he will call you bring it to
[2:50:51] fear fear
[2:50:54] and and you make you love
[2:50:58] God and then when you you've been
[2:51:01] baptized in
[2:51:03] water God will come right
[2:51:05] quick and he will seal
[2:51:08] you and some of you believers who are
[2:51:10] who who are baptized
[2:51:13] already but you have not received the
[2:51:16] Holy Ghost
[2:51:18] the area of
[2:51:22] repentance there is the
[2:51:24] problem clean up everything in your
[2:51:27] life and let me tell you God will fill
[2:51:31] you with the baptism of the Holy
[2:51:34] Ghost he is Duty bound to do
[2:51:37] it he promised
[2:51:40] it amen hallelujah amen now the false
[2:51:46] Ministry
[2:51:49] may have the manifestation of the
[2:51:53] gifts but the wrong
[2:51:57] Doctrine I want to read for you this
[2:51:59] quote out of the anointed ones at the
[2:52:01] end
[2:52:03] time the same holy spirit that anoints
[2:52:06] the
[2:52:08] church that gives them the desire to
[2:52:10] save
[2:52:12] Souls that gives them the power to
[2:52:15] perform
[2:52:16] Miracles it listen listen it is the same
[2:52:21] spirit that falls on the Sinners and the
[2:52:24] righteous the unjust and the
[2:52:27] just did you hear that ask your neighbor
[2:52:30] did you hear that
[2:52:32] correctly the very same
[2:52:35] Spirit now you can't make it another way
[2:52:38] and understand Matthew
[2:52:42] 244 he said there shall arise false
[2:52:47] Christ
[2:52:51] not false
[2:52:53] Jesus but false
[2:52:56] Christ a Christ is UN anointed
[2:53:01] one so he's anointed all
[2:53:05] right by the right
[2:53:08] anointing but he is
[2:53:11] false because there has a false
[2:53:14] teaching a false
[2:53:16] Doctrine a false Church system
[2:53:19] a pattern of the
[2:53:23] ministry and he says um Anointed with a
[2:53:27] genuine
[2:53:31] thing but be false prophets of
[2:53:35] it FAL teachers of
[2:53:41] it
[2:53:43] de when someone is performing
[2:53:47] miracle just believe in him
[2:53:52] anyhow that area of teaching what is
[2:53:55] teaching
[2:53:57] is if he believes in women
[2:54:01] preachers you better run for your
[2:54:04] life say Amen if you believe
[2:54:09] in he believes in women putting on
[2:54:12] throws a
[2:54:14] tight don't waste your time
[2:54:19] is Among Us the false
[2:54:25] prophet because the Bible forbid women
[2:54:28] to put on
[2:54:30] TR he believes in children INF
[2:54:34] baptism run for your
[2:54:38] life bapti Father Son and the Holy
[2:54:42] Ghost and they refused Jesus
[2:54:45] Christ and refuse that name in bapm
[2:54:49] run take off sister take
[2:54:54] off those are the false prophets the one
[2:54:58] prom the
[2:55:01] prophet will tell you what the Bible
[2:55:04] says true
[2:55:09] Minister the of the
[2:55:12] word he will not compromise
[2:55:15] anywhere he will not compromise
[2:55:18] but when he begins to
[2:55:20] compromise let us twist that a
[2:55:23] little that Wasing the time of
[2:55:27] the the
[2:55:30] world also make some Amendment and
[2:55:32] correction here and there this

[2:56:26] it the word of God is not up for
[2:56:32] debate we cannot debate the
[2:56:35] word that's why God sent us a
[2:56:39] prophet brother

[2:56:45] prophets Bram listen listen listen he
[2:56:50] was a word

[2:58:38] up with a
[2:58:41] serpent it was the
[2:58:43] Bible the apostles Tau it
[2:58:48] it's not William Bram that refused women
[2:58:50] to
[2:58:51] preach Apostle Paul as a matter of fact
[2:58:55] is the one who T
[2:58:56] it and hey did you know he wasn't the
[2:58:59] first old
[2:59:01] soul he wasn't the first old
[2:59:04] soul you know
[2:59:06] that God was the
[2:59:09] first where in the Book of
[2:59:14] Genesis we don't know who even wrote
[2:59:16] that book
[2:59:18] we believe it was
[2:59:20] Moses but whoever God revealed it
[2:59:23] to he said your husband shall rule over
[2:59:28] you and from that
[2:59:31] day two things were
[2:59:34] added a woman will give birth in
[2:59:39] pain and a man a husband will rule over
[2:59:44] her therefore she will no longer teach
[2:59:49] from that day that was
[2:59:53] instituted even when God was sending
[2:59:57] prophets he never sent teaching
[3:00:05] prophetesses the brother was a
[3:00:08] prophet she was sitting at her
[3:00:11] house under a
[3:00:14] tree people would come and she would
[3:00:16] tell them the word of God
[3:00:20] she never started a
[3:00:22] church when she went
[3:00:25] out what did she
[3:00:27] do Gideon was you know speaking to the
[3:00:31] people and leading people to
[3:00:34] war but
[3:00:36] de what did she do she L them in a
[3:00:41] song
[3:00:43] mam a
[3:00:45] prophet what did she do she L people in
[3:00:49] her
[3:00:51] song praise
[3:00:54] God when Jesus
[3:00:56] came he never had a
[3:01:02] woman among the
[3:01:05] 12 and when Judas became the devil and
[3:01:07] he had
[3:01:09] 11 none of them was a
[3:01:13] sister oh are you saying God doesn't use
[3:01:15] women
[3:01:18] ah I'm not saying that I am saying God
[3:01:21] uses
[3:01:23] women but not in a capacity as a Bible
[3:01:26] teacher to
[3:01:34] men Bible says a woman is should not
[3:01:37] accept authority over the man or teach a
[3:01:43] man but to be in
[3:01:45] silence first of the two
[3:01:48] the reason he gives
[3:01:50] it Genesis
[3:01:53] issue not the law those people who tell
[3:01:56] you women are not allowed to preach
[3:01:57] because of the law no they're
[3:02:01] wrong no the law found
[3:02:04] it and the left
[3:02:07] it so you understand we are Bible
[3:02:11] Believers we don't we just believe what
[3:02:14] is given to
[3:02:16] us we don't
[3:02:19] we are not
[3:02:22] theologians we are just
[3:02:26] Believers amen oh our sisters can serve
[3:02:29] in many
[3:02:31] capacities our sisters can sing can they
[3:02:34] can play the musical instruments they
[3:02:36] can sing special songs they can
[3:02:39] prophesy they can give tongues they can
[3:02:43] interpret
[3:02:44] times the sisters they can um teach
[3:02:47] Sunday school
[3:02:49] we have several here who do those things
[3:02:51] already you know the sisters have a lot
[3:02:54] of
[3:02:55] work the older sisters they teachers
[3:02:59] also to younger
[3:03:01] sisters to teach them how to love their
[3:03:03] husbands how to be keepers at
[3:03:06] home how to love their
[3:03:08] children and all those
[3:03:11] things it's in the book of Titus Chapter
[3:03:14] one so you see all these
[3:03:15] things the Bible has clear stated
[3:03:19] it brother Bram only came to restore
[3:03:24] these
[3:03:27] teachings because the denominations had
[3:03:30] robbed it
[3:03:32] away with a false
[3:03:35] Ministry so brother
[3:03:37] Bram came with one
[3:03:40] job to
[3:03:42] restore the teachings of the
[3:03:45] Bible Hallelujah amen
[3:03:49] woo my God I wish you people can become
[3:03:53] crazy like me and Sh like I'm
[3:03:56] sh let me tell you
[3:03:58] Church any preacher that rejects the
[3:04:01] teachings of William
[3:04:05] Bram he is not a full gospel
[3:04:08] [Applause]
[3:04:10] preacher I dare you show me one
[3:04:13] preacher who rejects William bram's
[3:04:16] teaching
[3:04:18] and I will show you a
[3:04:20] preacher who rejects the
[3:04:24] Bible they claim they believe William
[3:04:27] Bram as a prophet the word of God comes
[3:04:31] to a
[3:04:34] prophet for them they think they want to
[3:04:37] accept him only in the prophetic the the
[3:04:42] manifestations but listen that is where
[3:04:45] they go wrong
[3:04:48] the manifestations can even be
[3:04:52] fed the ultimate
[3:04:56] sign that someone is a true
[3:04:59] Prophet that will teach the Bible in its
[3:05:06] entirety praise the name of the
[3:05:08] Lord now
[3:05:11] Saints I want to try and um I'm I'm just
[3:05:14] getting started really
[3:05:18] because I was going to show you the
[3:05:20] threefold quality I just
[3:05:22] maybe the threefold quality of a true
[3:05:28] Ministry what is the three quality of a
[3:05:31] true
[3:05:33] Ministry number
[3:05:36] one Paul was absolutely true to the
[3:05:41] world he never deviated from
[3:05:46] it no matter
[3:05:49] what no matter what the
[3:05:53] cost Paul was willing to pay the
[3:05:57] cost to stay with the
[3:06:00] word and that's what I've been
[3:06:02] emphasizing since I
[3:06:05] started notice that Paul was
[3:06:10] unorganized notice Paul was unorganized
[3:06:18] Paul was unorganized was not
[3:06:26] organized but Spirit
[3:06:29] Led as when God moved upon Moses to lead
[3:06:33] Israel out
[3:06:33] [Applause]
[3:06:35] of now you have to understand the power
[3:06:38] of these
[3:06:39] words now I'm quoting the church age
[3:06:42] book and I want you to follow me closely
[3:06:45] now Paul was an
[3:06:51] organized he was Spirit
[3:06:54] L every man of
[3:06:57] God every
[3:07:00] Minister every
[3:07:04] ministry will be Spirit
[3:07:10] L even our Sunday school
[3:07:15] teachers we have sisters here
[3:07:18] who have been ministering to Sunday
[3:07:20] school we don't give them a
[3:07:24] curriculum sister go and preach
[3:07:27] this no they are Spirit
[3:07:32] Le God speaks to
[3:07:35] them and they go into the
[3:07:37] scripture they take the word and they
[3:07:40] bring it to the children and they preach
[3:07:43] it to
[3:07:43] them why they are Spirit Le
[3:07:49] every Minister every
[3:07:52] Pastor must be Spirit
[3:07:56] Le the musicians must
[3:08:03] be the
[3:08:05] deacons the
[3:08:07] mothers when was the last time you knel
[3:08:12] down and prayed for your
[3:08:15] children and prayed for Lord to give you
[3:08:17] INSP
[3:08:19] and
[3:08:20] guidance how to make your
[3:08:23] home you must be Spirit
[3:08:26] Le We Are Holy Ghost Le
[3:08:31] people you as a woman you go cook food
[3:08:34] for your
[3:08:36] husband you pray over
[3:08:39] it you pray for
[3:08:42] him you as a
[3:08:44] man you pray for your home you lead your
[3:08:49] children by
[3:08:53] example praise God Amen but if you you
[3:08:58] have a lot of
[3:08:59] problems and that's when you remember to
[3:09:01] kneel down and
[3:09:03] pray your child will come and Daddy are
[3:09:07] you
[3:09:08] okay are you fine because he doesn't
[3:09:12] know that you
[3:09:15] pray but when you pray every day
[3:09:18] your
[3:09:19] child will just come and join
[3:09:22] you because he knows it's time to
[3:09:26] pray now listen Jerusalem's Council
[3:09:29] never sent Paul
[3:09:33] out nor did it have any power or
[3:09:37] jurisdiction over
[3:09:45] him Hallelujah
[3:09:48] amen Paul was led by the Holy
[3:09:53] Spirit the C of Jerusalem was not the
[3:09:55] one that sent him
[3:10:00] out God and God
[3:10:04] Alone he did the
[3:10:07] sending and the
[3:10:11] leading Paul was not of men but of
[3:10:15] God he was not of men but of
[3:10:20] God you see
[3:10:24] denominations they send a man
[3:10:28] somewhere you see when you are somewhere
[3:10:32] in a place where there is no
[3:10:36] Fellowship where there is no
[3:10:41] Fellowship you know God can speak to
[3:10:43] you start
[3:10:46] evangelizing you don't need to wait for
[3:10:48] a letter from the
[3:10:52] church the church does not send a
[3:10:58] preacher we always see people coming up
[3:11:01] to
[3:11:02] minister let me tell you a little bit of
[3:11:06] how we make preachers or we encourage
[3:11:12] preachers are you hearing me amen there
[3:11:15] is no man who can make another one a
[3:11:20] preacher no it doesn't
[3:11:23] happen number one number
[3:11:27] two a preacher is called by
[3:11:31] God and
[3:11:34] gifted now a
[3:11:38] gift will open way for
[3:11:42] him the scripture says
[3:11:45] here a man's gift maketh room for
[3:11:49] him Proverbs
[3:11:52] 18:16 a man's gift maketh room for
[3:11:55] him and bringeth him before
[3:12:00] great you remember how David started
[3:12:03] singing and playing
[3:12:05] for how many remember that he was A
[3:12:08] Gifted
[3:12:09] Man so whenever he would
[3:12:13] play s would enter the spirit
[3:12:17] would leave
[3:12:18] him
[3:12:20] so he hired
[3:12:22] him you'll be here to play for me all
[3:12:24] the
[3:12:27] time it wasn't a councel that sanctioned
[3:12:30] David it was a
[3:12:35] gift you find people
[3:12:38] fighting and
[3:12:41] fasting they want to be the ones to
[3:12:43] minister they want to
[3:12:47] God never allow that in
[3:12:49] Dev it's a wrong
[3:12:53] Spirit a gift should make room for
[3:12:57] you who gives you the
[3:12:59] gift God
[3:13:03] Almighty and then when you stand up to
[3:13:06] minister people will oh I'm
[3:13:08] blessed oh I'm blessed I was going
[3:13:11] through this situation but
[3:13:14] something you will see that brother
[3:13:16] coming back again to me
[3:13:21] maybe in the cell group
[3:13:23] somewhere but where someone stands up
[3:13:25] and
[3:13:27] ministers and people begin
[3:13:31] crying that brother he really hurt
[3:13:36] me there's a
[3:13:38] problem there's no gift in
[3:13:41] there there's no Ministry in there
[3:13:47] and on one is I'm continuing with
[3:13:50] this but you will see the three uh uh um
[3:13:55] you know
[3:13:56] patterns three
[3:14:00] qualities and and in a nutshell I'll
[3:14:02] tell
[3:14:03] you this man must be true to the
[3:14:08] word this ministry must be true to the
[3:14:12] word
[3:14:14] secondly that Ministry
[3:14:17] will be in the power of the
[3:14:20] spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken
[3:14:24] word of God and the written word of
[3:14:28] God it will be
[3:14:32] demonstrating not just talking
[3:14:36] about but
[3:14:40] demonstrating praise the name of the
[3:14:42] Lord amen and and
[3:14:45] lastly that Ministry
[3:14:48] will bear
[3:14:51] FR will bear
[3:14:54] fruit there has to be fruit otherwise if
[3:14:56] you have no
[3:14:57] fruit someone saying God sent me to
[3:15:01] preach
[3:15:04] in when you
[3:15:07] go he
[3:15:09] has immorality with the people he came
[3:15:15] to there is one person there two people
[3:15:19] here and they also living in
[3:15:22] [Music]
[3:15:23] sin and this person has been there for 5
[3:15:27] years saying God sent me there did God
[3:15:30] send
[3:15:31] them no there is no
[3:15:35] fruit there must be fruit you must bear
[3:15:39] fruit in your
[3:15:42] ministry I see your concentration has
[3:15:44] come down
[3:15:54] so I I wouldn't want to continue after
[3:15:56] here because this is a teaching that I
[3:15:59] must teach you when you're very
[3:16:03] sober and I'm one person who doesn't
[3:16:05] believe in I have to preach everything I
[3:16:07] wanted to preach
[3:16:15] no to preach you
[3:16:18] whatever but I want to preach you what
[3:16:20] God has
[3:16:22] inspired and then for today's done shall
[3:16:24] We rise on our
[3:16:25] feet amen I want to continue with this
[3:16:32] teaching on um perhaps um
[3:16:37] Wednesday and if you can come on

[3:46:27] University so always remember me in
[3:46:31] prayers I'm taking a few students there
[3:46:35] can say about 10 of
[3:46:39] them coming
[3:46:43] consistently so I want you to remember
[3:46:45] that in

[3:46:53] message and also you pray for sister
[3:46:57] PE uh who is really doing good
[3:47:01] mobilization
[3:47:03] there a student
[3:47:07] there so pray for her that God will also
[3:47:12] continue to establish her
[3:47:15] because if he does then she becomes a
[3:47:16] good Ambassador
[3:47:19] there also pray for brother
[3:47:22] nille he's also at the same
[3:47:25] school I think sister you're doing is it
[3:47:27] a business
[3:47:28] course and he's doing a law
[3:47:33] course so but they're both
[3:47:36] there I think about two other students
[3:47:39] from

[3:47:44] of that Fellowship

[3:48:11] sale then last this this week
[3:48:15] it was like a
[3:48:17] crusade so someone came up with an idea

[3:48:21] came why do we hide ourselves here we
[3:48:23] could even
[3:48:27] go that's a good
[3:48:29] idea and uh so this week speakers
