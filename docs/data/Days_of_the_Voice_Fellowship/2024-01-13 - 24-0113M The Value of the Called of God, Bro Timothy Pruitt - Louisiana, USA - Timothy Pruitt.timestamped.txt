[52:14] PR preached
[52:16] before just raise up your
[52:19] hand okay so the majority have not yet
[52:23] had you
[52:24] pre and uh and uh so I think the
[52:28] expectations then are
[52:31] higher praise the name of the Lord amen
[52:34] it is not easy it was not
[52:37] easy to get brother Timothy PR to come
[52:40] down
[52:43] here I tried it at first with
[52:48] team and I almost almost and then it did
[52:52] not work
[52:54] out and and uh this time when I met
[52:57] brother Tim Timothy PR in
[53:01] Germany I told him brother Timothy that
[53:03] now that we have
[53:05] met you must come
[53:08] down to
[53:10] Uganda and I don't know whether this was
[53:12] a
[53:14] bait I told him this I said we don't
[53:17] want anything from
[53:20] you all we want is your
[53:24] ministry and and uh and so I told him
[53:28] just come pack your backs and and come
[53:31] and minister to us and and brother
[53:35] Timothy you know he's very
[53:38] gracious uh he um when he arrived before
[53:43] he arrived we wanted to book him a
[53:47] place and uh he he was very I don't know
[53:51] whether to say gracious or
[53:54] wise he went behind my
[53:57] back and he booked for himself another
[54:00] place uh but uh uh we are glad that
[54:04] they're
[54:05] comfortable we wanted to take care of
[54:07] everything
[54:09] everything Saint
[54:12] why this man has a
[54:15] Ministry that all of us need to

[54:34] world and I tell you many people would
[54:36] love to have
[54:39] them and they go to very few
[54:43] places and brother Timothy has chosen to
[54:45] come to this
[54:47] place and so we want to say it's because
[54:51] God must have laid something on his
[54:54] hand
[54:56] for us
[54:57] here and uh I want you to be expectant
[54:59] in your heart believing that God is

[1:11:55] I tried to go
[1:12:01] some I tried to go a different direction
[1:12:04] many times over the past few
[1:12:08] days but the Lord kept bringing me back
[1:12:11] to this
[1:12:13] place just to ask the question what is
[1:12:16] truly
[1:12:19] valuable many times we put too much
[1:12:22] value on things that are
[1:12:25] temporary you know this world that we
[1:12:28] live in is a temporary
[1:12:30] World our cars our houses whatever we
[1:12:33] have is All
[1:12:36] Temporary some place value on themselves
[1:12:39] too much
[1:12:42] value some value themselves too
[1:12:46] little but all the things in this earth
[1:12:49] and the things that we're going through
[1:12:51] have no value at all
[1:12:55] what truly gives you
[1:12:57] value is not if you're an
[1:13:00] American or Uganda or from Europe
[1:13:04] somewhere what gives us True
[1:13:07] Value is a God plac the seed in us
[1:13:10] before the foundation of the
[1:13:12] world Amen what is truly value is not
[1:13:15] what is
[1:13:18] temporary but what is that is
[1:13:21] eternal Amen brother speaks about an old
[1:13:24] bum
[1:13:26] that was he was run over by an
[1:13:29] [Music]

[1:13:34] his arms was
[1:13:37] broken and blood was running
[1:13:40] everywhere they took him to the
[1:13:43] hospital and the doctor looked at him
[1:13:46] and says there's really nothing we can
[1:13:48] do here he's all broke
[1:13:51] up besides that he's he's not really
[1:13:54] worth
[1:13:55] anything just wrap him up and let him
[1:13:58] die and this old fell turned over and
[1:14:01] said I'm worth
[1:14:03] something God loved me so
[1:14:06] much that he gave his only begotten son
[1:14:09] to
[1:14:10] me surely if I'm worth something to
[1:14:14] God I'm worth a few minutes of your
[1:14:18] time God loves me and he gave his son
[1:14:22] for me
[1:14:24] I am worth
[1:14:27] something amen sure you got a soul that
[1:14:30] is worth 10,000
[1:14:34] words amen you may you may not have many
[1:14:38] houses or many
[1:14:40] lands or many cars none of that has of
[1:14:44] any value
[1:14:45] whatsoever but you have inside of you a
[1:14:49] soul amen it's worth 10,000 worlds
[1:14:55] hallelujah amen Jesus said this in
[1:14:58] Matthew
[1:14:59] 10 in verse
[1:15:01] 29 he said are not Two Sparrows sold for
[1:15:05] a
[1:15:10] fary and not one of them shall fall on
[1:15:13] the ground without your father knowing
[1:15:16] about
[1:15:18] it but the very hairs of your head are
[1:15:22] numbered
[1:15:25] fear you not
[1:15:27] therefore ye are of more value than many
[1:15:33] sparrows you know out of the tens of
[1:15:35] thousands of species of
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] birds Jesus spoke of a
[1:15:43] sparrow they don't fly the
[1:15:46] highest they're not the most popular
[1:15:49] they're not the most
[1:15:51] beautiful they don't sing the pretty
[1:15:54] s just a common
[1:15:57] bird seemingly worth
[1:15:59] nothing but not one can fall to the
[1:16:04] ground without the father knowing
[1:16:06] about God is concerned with the smallest
[1:16:10] of
[1:16:11] things and he said you or have more
[1:16:14] value than they
[1:16:17] have you are more valuable to him you
[1:16:21] are not one little bird
[1:16:23] can fall to the ground without him
[1:16:26] knowing about it don't you know if the
[1:16:30] heavenly father knows about every bird
[1:16:34] he knows about your need he knows about
[1:16:36] your struggle he knows about your
[1:16:39] problem he knows about your issue he
[1:16:41] knows about what you're going through
[1:16:44] and you have
[1:16:49] value
[1:16:50] Hallelujah you may not be the richest
[1:16:53] you may not be the prettiest you may not
[1:16:56] be the most popular but in God's eyes
[1:16:59] you are
[1:17:01] valuable in God's eyes he cares for
[1:17:08] you hallelujah hallelujah so what what
[1:17:12] what determines
[1:17:15] value the price that one is willing to
[1:17:22] pay they could ask uh you know $5
[1:17:25] million for this building right
[1:17:29] here and say that's what it's
[1:17:31] worth but but if no one's willing to pay
[1:17:35] that
[1:17:36] price then it that's not a true
[1:17:39] value amen what determines a
[1:17:43] value is the price that one is willing
[1:17:46] to
[1:17:47] pay you know some have spent money on
[1:17:50] something to me that has no value
[1:17:55] I wouldn't have paid what they paid I
[1:17:58] wouldn't have gave what they
[1:17:59] gave some have bought paintings that wor
[1:18:03] they think are worth millions of
[1:18:07] dollars I've looked at
[1:18:09] them and I look at this painting
[1:18:12] that's supposedly worth millions of
[1:18:16] dollars I wouldn't give you $10 for
[1:18:19] it it wasn't a value to me but somebody
[1:18:23] saw value
[1:18:25] inside so what we're saying is that what
[1:18:28] you're
[1:18:30] getting is worth more than what you're
[1:18:35] giving amen you know I was just in
[1:18:38] Belgium and they have a church a
[1:18:40] Catholic Church
[1:18:42] there who claims to have a little vial a
[1:18:45] little
[1:18:47] bottle of the of the literal blood of
[1:18:50] Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ and they walk down the streets
[1:18:54] with this
[1:18:56] vow and people bow to it and they lift
[1:18:59] their hands and they say their
[1:19:03] words but I I'm sorry I don't believe
[1:19:05] that's the literal
[1:19:07] blood but I do know that there's
[1:19:10] something more
[1:19:11] valuable sitting here this
[1:19:15] morning if I did have the literal blood
[1:19:18] of Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ and I had it in a little bottle
[1:19:23] there's something here that's more
[1:19:24] valuable than
[1:19:26] that hallelujah amen it's what he gave
[1:19:30] his life
[1:19:32] for in other words he thought you was
[1:19:35] more valuable than his own
[1:19:40] life you're not the blood you're the
[1:19:43] purchase of the
[1:19:45] blood and God thought enough about you
[1:19:49] that he would come down from
[1:19:51] heaven
[1:19:57] and he would come
[1:19:58] down and he would become
[1:20:01] me and he would give his life that I
[1:20:05] might become
[1:20:06] him amen he thought I was more
[1:20:10] valuable than all of
[1:20:16] Heaven hallelujah hallelujah brother
[1:20:18] brandham says this he says I've often
[1:20:21] wondered
[1:20:23] what I would do if I had two drops of
[1:20:26] the literal blood of Jesus
[1:20:29] Christ how I would embrace
[1:20:32] it and walk with it and I wouldn't want
[1:20:35] to drop
[1:20:37] it but do you know in the sight of
[1:20:41] God I've got something greater than that
[1:20:44] before me
[1:20:47] today I've got the
[1:20:50] purchase I've got the purchase of
[1:20:54] he loved you
[1:20:56] more than he loved his own
[1:20:59] life and he gave his life for
[1:21:03] you hallelujah hallelujah he gave
[1:21:07] himself he took your shame he took your
[1:21:11] iniquities he took your sin and he said
[1:21:15] I found something worth

[1:30:12] talking about being in a like a
[1:30:16] museum there were two two men looking at
[1:30:19] this
[1:30:20] paper
[1:30:22] and on this paper they were it was the
[1:30:24] analysis of a
[1:30:29] man and he said you know they were
[1:30:32] telling you how much you were worth in
[1:30:34] your body the potash and the
[1:30:40] different he said maybe a man weighing
[1:30:42] about 150
[1:30:45] pounds was worth about 84
[1:30:50] cents
[1:30:53] less than a
[1:30:55] dollar he said but we'll dress that 84
[1:30:59] cents
[1:31:02] up we'll put a $500 suit on
[1:31:06] it and we'll put a $50 hat on
[1:31:10] it and still down
[1:31:13] inside it's only worth
[1:31:19] 84 he said I I was looking at
[1:31:23] this and and he said I tap them two boys
[1:31:26] on the
[1:31:27] shoulder he said there's one thing I
[1:31:29] want to tell
[1:31:30] you he said you may be worth only 84
[1:31:33] cents of the chemicals of your
[1:31:37] body it might only be worth 84
[1:31:42] cents but you got a soul that's worth
[1:31:44] 10,000
[1:31:50] world

[1:31:54] or
[1:31:55] somewhere going to get us a nice

[1:33:07] valuable we really
[1:33:10] are if we did we wouldn't carry

[1:51:17] Soul one soul is worth 10,000 words
[1:51:23] people fail to catch the value of a
[1:51:27] soul therefore they won't support a
[1:51:29] church with their
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:34] attendance to help create an
[1:51:38] atmosphere where other Souls can be
[1:51:43] saved but their
[1:51:45] bitterness has become more valuable to
[1:51:48] them their
[1:51:50] Pride it means
[1:51:52] more God help us to realize the value we
[1:51:56] [Music]
[1:51:59] have amen but that's the way it is lot a
[1:52:03] lot of
[1:52:04] times people don't see the real value of
[1:52:06] someone until they don't have them
[1:52:12] anymore they don't realize the true
[1:52:14] value of of true
[1:52:18] friendships until they've done something
[1:52:20] to ruin
[1:52:23] it but God sees your
[1:52:26] value he sees there's something in
[1:52:31] there that's
[1:52:34] valuable
[1:52:36] amen we talked about the little
[1:52:39] bird God also showed
[1:52:42] value in a little
[1:52:46] fish there was a little fish they had
[1:52:48] caught
[1:52:51] and the brother had ripped his his guts
[1:52:55] out because he had used too big of a
[1:52:59] hook and he said well little fishy I
[1:53:02] just throw him over on the
[1:53:05] water and that fish laid there for about
[1:53:07] an
[1:53:10] hour but out it was a certain certain
[1:53:14] moment that the wind of God moved
[1:53:18] down
[1:53:20] they were actually discussing some
[1:53:22] things that had
[1:53:24] happened and how God had moved in many
[1:53:29] situations and he said a wind come
[1:53:31] pouring down through that
[1:53:36] Valley and he said I heard these words
[1:53:38] speak and give back the life to that
[1:53:44] fish I said little fishy in the name of
[1:53:47] the Lord Jesus Christ I give you back
[1:53:49] your
[1:53:54] life and the men watching watch that
[1:53:57] little fish flop back
[1:54:03] over make a few more movements and go
[1:54:06] into the
[1:54:08] water and right at that
[1:54:11] time I had 30 or 40 sick children on a
[1:54:15] prayer
[1:54:18] list
[1:54:20] and God would go around all of those
[1:54:22] sick
[1:54:24] children to bring that little fish
[1:54:28] up it said he show it goes to show he's
[1:54:31] interested in
[1:54:38] everything he not just a god somewhere

[1:55:44] interested in every
[1:55:47] detail of Our Lives

[1:55:55] curse a fig
[1:56:00] tree when there were thousands of
[1:56:02] leopards in the
[1:56:05] land but he bypassed all of those
[1:56:09] lepers and cursed the tree and said no

[2:00:56] and laid at his
[2:01:01] porch she was all scarred and broken
[2:01:06] up had flies all over

[2:01:15] rake and he kind of nudged it to see if
[2:01:18] it was still alive
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:21] see the prophet didn't he want to touch

[2:01:32] oh it's still
[2:01:34] alive you know it had said he said I
[2:01:36] looked and I opened up her
[2:01:38] pocket little pocket
[2:01:42] there she had nine little babies laying
[2:01:44] in
[2:01:46] there and he said I thought wow what a
[2:01:50] mother that would that would just try to
[2:01:53] do everything she can for her babies to
[2:01:57] live and he said my neighbor Mr
[2:02:01] wood and his wife you know was kind of a
[2:02:04] vet
[2:02:06] veterinarian she said brother brandom
[2:02:08] just kill that pum and put it out of its
[2:02:13] misery said the little babies are too
[2:02:15] small they can't take a
[2:02:17] bottle
[2:02:20] he said I I I just can't do that I I
[2:02:23] well brother brandom you're not going to
[2:02:24] let that poor thing lay there like that

[2:47:32] there if only they can
[2:47:35] realize that they are the
[2:47:38] purches of the
[2:47:40] blood it's not the blood that is more
[2:47:43] important the blood was
[2:47:46] given it was the price that was
[2:47:50] paid but we are the
[2:47:52] ones that we are
[2:47:55] paid we are the
[2:47:58] value of the blood oh

[2:48:06] to shout
[2:48:07] Lord makes me excited in my soul
[2:48:11] father Lord let this service father
[2:48:17] something to someone
[2:48:19] Lord and that these words will continue
[2:48:21] echoing back and back and
[2:48:25] [Music]
[2:48:26] forth and even when the devil thinks it
[2:48:29] might be just a
[2:48:33] feeling Let It Be More Than A
[2:48:36] Feeling let it be like an
[2:48:38] anchor for when someone receives an
[2:48:42] experience it's a permanent one
[2:48:46] because when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:48:48] down he comes to
[2:48:51] dwell Grant it
