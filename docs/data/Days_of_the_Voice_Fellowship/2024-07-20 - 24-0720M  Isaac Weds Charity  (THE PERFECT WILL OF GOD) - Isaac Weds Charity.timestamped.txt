[28:52] join together
[28:58] and
[29:00] is ofmy according to thein
[29:05] of custom of the Christian
[29:11] Church tol on their behalf the blessings
[29:14] of
[29:17] God Psalms 1271 says except the Lord
[29:20] build the
[29:23] house in
[29:28] marriage is Honorable and a holy estate
[29:30] instituted by God In The Garden of
[29:36] Aiden it was there that the Lord God
[29:38] said it is not good that the man should
[29:41] be
[29:44] alone Eve was then fashioned from a reib
[29:47] of Adam given um to him for a wife and
[29:52] it was th recorded
[30:00] shall a man leave his father and his
[30:06] motherto his
[30:09] wife and they shall be
[30:13] one it is sanctioned and honed by the
[30:16] presence of Jesus Christ at the marriage
[30:18] in of
[30:23] gilee between Christ and his church
[30:29] God ordained ordains it at the
[30:33] foundation ra rather as a foundation and
[30:36] bond of family
[30:40] life for the
[30:43] mut and comfort of husband and
[30:48] wife and for the welfare of the
[30:51] state so there marriage is not to be
[30:54] entered into by any unadvisable
[30:58] [Music]

[40:25] undivided attention this morning
[40:30] because God laid this burden on my heart
[40:33] as I was at the introduction
[40:37] ceremony what I will be able to share on
[40:41] today before I even start because what
[40:45] I'm going to preach on today is unlike
[40:47] what I usually
[40:50] do had many Weddings But I'm taking a
[40:52] different direction today
[40:57] charity and
[40:59] Isaac not only for
[41:01] you because we've had sessions with
[41:05] them told them a
[41:07] lot today it's not usually only for
[41:12] them are
[41:14] here are
[41:16] onl
[41:18] mostly the thought God laid on my heart
[41:20] is for the young
[41:23] people so just pray for
[41:25] me I'm going to speak to you this
[41:27] morning on the perfect will of
[41:33] God and we going to read Romans
[41:36] 12 says iech you
[41:39] there by thees of
[41:42] God present your bodies a Living
[41:47] Sacrifice acceptable unto
[41:50] God which is your reasonable
[41:54] service and be not conformed to this
[41:56] world
[41:59] ye
[42:00] transformed by the renewing of your
[42:04] mind may
[42:06] prove what is that
[42:10] good and
[42:12] acceptable and
[42:15] perfect will of
[42:17] God speaking on that perfect will of
[42:22] God we have two Wills of God
[42:30] we have the perfect will of
[42:33] God and the permissive will of
[42:36] God you know we've seen many examples
[42:39] from the
[42:40] scripture but the typical one that we
[42:42] all
[42:43] know is that of a man called
[42:47] um the uh the
[42:51] prophet uh I'm just trying to recall his
[42:54] name
[42:57] prophet
[42:59] balam and so Prophet balam was a man
[43:03] that was so intoxicated in his
[43:07] heart
[43:11] Wasing
[43:14] something he wanted to accomplish it
[43:16] regardless of
[43:19] what when that was cing
[43:23] Israel because he was
[43:25] promised by the king Bal that if you go
[43:29] and cast for me these
[43:32] people I'm going to make you great I'm
[43:35] going to give you I'm going to make
[43:38] youe go
[43:40] and so the man prophet
[43:42] balam he he said I'll go
[43:45] C but before I do I'll inquire from
[43:49] God he went before God God told him you
[43:54] cannot do it these people are blessed
[43:59] they cannot
[44:00] be I want to tell you whoever God has
[44:05] blessed cannot be
[44:07] C and and so we are the people of
[44:11] God the C of the world can
[44:15] come but the man said I will go back
[44:18] again to
[44:20] God was promised more
[44:23] wealth more power
[44:25] and so then when he went back
[44:30] okay you can go does God change his
[44:35] mind conning his
[44:37] word God is God God is not a man his
[44:42] first thought is
[44:45] perfect idea is as perfect as his
[44:50] idea never change his
[44:53] mind concerning anything he said in his
[44:56] word
[44:58] and
[44:59] so because of the desire of his
[45:03] heart he
[45:04] insisted and
[45:07] persisted going to
[45:09] C told him you can go and so he went now
[45:15] many of you know the
[45:17] story even when he arrived
[45:20] there you know he could not cast them as
[45:23] he was going on a
[45:24] donkey you know the donkey saw Angel of
[45:27] the Lord before
[45:29] him and and the donkey
[45:32] stopped but the man would not
[45:36] stop he instead struck the and he said
[45:40] what's
[45:41] wrong come on let's go and the donkey
[45:46] spoke and say
[45:48] to have I ever disobeyed you my
[45:52] man and said anyway let's go
[45:57] can you imagine he was so
[46:00] blind that you could not see that
[46:02] donkeys are not supposed to
[46:05] speak because he had his own
[46:09] will was helping to accomplishing his
[46:14] will
[46:18] will him
[46:20] go it was not God's way
[46:27] it was God's
[46:29] permissive because the perfect will of
[46:32] God is what he said the first
[46:35] time and what he says the first
[46:38] time what we have in the
[46:41] Bible word
[46:44] godf the will of
[46:46] God but because he wasant
[46:51] on he still had to you know pass go
[46:55] through everything
[46:59] himself before the
[47:01] children open his mou
[47:04] to instead
[47:08] blessed hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[47:11] name
[47:12] of my
[47:14] God you cannot be cast
[47:16] Isaac canot be C
[47:20] charity to bless you
[47:23] today blessing
[47:28] amen and if you were here
[47:30] also you were a part of the
[47:34] blessing now this man
[47:36] Bal still went by force but he couldn't
[47:42] C but what he went with was the
[47:45] permissive will of
[47:51] God and God let him
[47:55] go so I'm going to speak to you on this
[47:57] thought and I'll divide it into two
[48:02] points what is the perfect will of God
[48:04] concerning a woman and a man rather a
[48:07] woman and man
[48:13] relationship how are we supposed to
[48:15] relate with with women if you are man if
[48:18] you're a man and how are we supposed to
[48:19] relate with men if you were a woman
[48:29] what is the perfect will of
[48:32] God in that issue the second question I
[48:38] will talk
[48:39] about is what is the
[48:43] outcome of
[48:49] godive after that we will go to the V
[48:54] and I'm going to stick with my usually
[48:56] to avoid preaching for
[48:58] long I usually have
[49:01] notes charity I give you this booklet
[49:06] afterwards because thoughts that I
[49:08] studed and waited upon the Lord
[49:12] over and I believe it's the word of God
[49:15] concerning this
[49:18] ceremony so for the most part I'll be
[49:22] reading and speaking by inspiration
[49:24] where necessary
[49:27] so we'll go with the first question what
[49:29] is the perfect will of God concerning a
[49:30] woman and a woman and man
[49:38] relationship now theil in the world
[49:42] today has turned a
[49:45] woman and these words are really coming
[49:48] from my
[49:50] heart and from the inspiration of the
[49:52] spirit every young man that is here
[49:54] today
[49:56] is not married please pay
[50:01] attention and also the married
[50:04] on theil in the world has turned a woman
[50:07] into a sex
[50:09] [Music]
[50:12] object that is why they dress to be
[50:19] sexy Believers should never dress to be
[50:23] sex and I'm so happy all the maidens
[50:26] look at how they
[50:32] come yes show how they
[50:37] address what
[50:43] we I want you to show the
[50:46] bride God bless you you can be
[50:50] seated Brides this in this generation
[50:53] dressed to be sexy
[50:57] you imagine someone saying that it is
[50:59] their wedding
[51:02] day and they dress with all the boobs
[51:08] out and the bo like going to run
[51:12] away don't believe that that is a
[51:15] perverted
[51:17] generation we don't dress to be
[51:19] sex we dress to be
[51:25] virtu so that is why they dress to be
[51:29] sexy because the woman is turned into a
[51:32] sex
[51:34] object attract men to follow
[51:38] them you want they want to dress in such
[51:41] a way that when they go on the
[51:44] streets that every man will turn their
[51:47] head a spirit of the
[51:50] generation Spirit of perversion it's a
[51:53] wrong spirit and all the Believers young
[51:57] people must turn away their heads from
[52:00] such
[52:02] Spirit the movie
[52:05] industry has turned
[52:10] into
[52:13] woman they have turned a woman into
[52:17] anything you find you know what
[52:20] Hollywood has done to a
[52:22] woman you know they've turned her into a
[52:25] lasting object
[52:29] and even it has come down into our
[52:32] society because of
[52:34] Television because of the
[52:37] op because of the
[52:41] movies you know whatever you want to
[52:43] call
[52:46] it and young
[52:48] ladies watch this things young men watch
[52:53] things and it has come down into our
[52:55] society
[52:58] where she the woman has been reduced to
[53:01] an object of L and
[53:09] desire
[53:11] this from the intention of
[53:15] God when he created the
[53:18] woman Satan the per of all good
[53:23] things is the one who has done
[53:26] but God by his grace still has his
[53:32] daughter who will escape the
[53:35] TR I hear the daughters of God
[53:40] shouting in First Corinthians 7
[53:44] ver now concerning things whereof you
[53:47] wrote unto
[53:49] me it is good for a man not to touch a
[53:54] woman nevertheless to avoid
[53:58] fornication let every
[54:01] man have his own
[54:05] wife is this the will of
[54:08] God is this the word of
[54:10] God this is why we are
[54:15] here and let every
[54:18] woman have her own
[54:22] husb it is the will of God
[54:26] let the husband Render unto the wife du
[54:32] benevolence likewise also the
[54:38] wife the wife has no power over her own
[54:43] body from today you don't have power
[54:48] over but your husband
[54:52] does and likewise
[54:55] also has no power over his
[54:58] own but the
[55:00] wife this is the will of God concerning
[55:02] man and woman
[55:06] relation woman is created with
[55:12] virtues
[55:14] God she should never
[55:17] def Society has forgotten about
[55:21] it church has
[55:24] forgotten Christians have forgotten
[55:28] still
[55:30] those not
[55:34] forgotten
[55:36] virtue for a girl to be a
[55:40] virgin
[55:47] woman some comes
[55:52] and and maybe some of you are here
[55:56] and they slap
[56:00] you that is your sacred virtue of
[56:05] Womanhood you should never let any
[56:08] man do
[56:10] that you
[56:12] sister why because you
[56:17] are that body is supposed to be a
[56:21] virtuous why because it is the Temple of
[56:24] the Holy Ghost
[56:28] this is what separates us from all the
[56:32] denominations because we are
[56:38] Holiness
[56:41] motherhood another
[56:45] virtue for her to be able to be a
[56:49] wife to a
[56:51] husband to be a
[56:53] homekeeper to take care of our children
[56:57] children not just be one who is
[57:02] hoping that's why girls in our
[57:05] generation no longer want

[57:11] and they think you you are a
[57:15] loser they think that you're no longer
[57:17] going to have

[57:27] what is in it about being
[57:29] single to be single is to be
[57:33] lonely to be single is to fight and
[57:36] struggle with
[57:39] desire but yet God has a
[57:43] perfect has a
[57:46] perfect a relationship between a man and
[57:49] a woman say is
[57:52] better for a man not even to touch a

[1:00:17] that that is not
[1:00:23] thef Paul gave this instruction
[1:00:27] because he
[1:00:28] understood that the perfect will of
[1:00:31] God concerning this
[1:00:35] relationship of a man and a
[1:00:37] woman in the beginning God created a
[1:00:40] man and a woman for him for
[1:00:48] mut
[1:00:51] andow created charity
[1:00:58] mfort and
[1:01:01] fellow she's from today she's your
[1:01:05] comfort how can you begin talking about
[1:01:07] the problems and the struggles with
[1:01:09] another girl another
[1:01:14] woman let
[1:01:17] me
[1:01:19] me you don't know what I'm going through
[1:01:22] even my wife I don't share with her
[1:01:24] there is a problem with
[1:01:28] you are not supposed to find
[1:01:31] Comfort woman is not your
[1:01:35] wife you are not supposed to find
[1:01:40] comfort that is not your
[1:01:44] hus God has created a
[1:01:47] man and a
[1:01:49] woman for mutual
[1:01:53] comfort number two for
[1:01:59] procreation if you don't want to have
[1:02:01] children don't get
[1:02:03] married
[1:02:06] simp that we are still getting to know
[1:02:08] each
[1:02:09] other that is supposed to be
[1:02:14] C you can know each other for however
[1:02:16] long
[1:02:18] you without
[1:02:20] meeting as husband and wife but the
[1:02:23] moment you get married
[1:02:26] the one of the purposes of
[1:02:28] marriage for
[1:02:32] procreation to have
[1:02:34] children the B says the fruit of the
[1:02:42] womb Mak has been rewarded
[1:02:46] by by giving him a beautiful
[1:02:51] daughter has rewarded you
[1:03:01] and
[1:03:03] also I will also say this I know we
[1:03:05] mixed
[1:03:09] congregation purp of
[1:03:11] marriage sexual
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:17] graic and I said that because it rhymes
[1:03:20] with what I'm talking about
[1:03:23] today we usually speak this in private
[1:03:28] these
[1:03:30] things
[1:03:32] things
[1:03:35] attained
[1:03:37] which Mt
[1:03:40] andow
[1:03:43] procreation sexual
[1:03:47] gratification find a word and throw it
[1:03:49] there
[1:03:51] already
[1:03:53] things attained other
[1:04:04] word it be outside of
[1:04:10] his it will have
[1:04:14] consequen we will
[1:04:17] later Exodus
[1:04:20] 2014 Thou shalt not commit
[1:04:23] aulter now that's the Old Testament
[1:04:26] but in Matthew 5 27 he says you have
[1:04:31] heard that it was said by them of all
[1:04:34] time that thou
[1:04:36] sh but this is Jesus
[1:04:40] now whoever look on a
[1:04:45] woman to
[1:04:47] last after
[1:04:51] her has committed a
[1:04:54] doubt with
[1:04:57] already in his
[1:05:00] heart so now you can now see the law of
[1:05:05] Christ is even magnified greater than
[1:05:07] the law of
[1:05:10] Moses even need to do
[1:05:13] the
[1:05:22] simp then no you start can I have your
[1:05:24] contact
[1:05:26] but in your head in your mind you don't
[1:05:29] have any intentional
[1:05:31] marriage that is the permissive
[1:05:36] will world people do
[1:05:40] that hallelujah hallelujah all you young
[1:05:43] people hearing me today this is the way
[1:05:47] of
[1:05:48] God what you seeing
[1:05:51] here it is the way of
[1:05:54] God and you people in the
[1:05:56] message told you many times if a young
[1:05:59] man comes to
[1:06:01] you and seeks for
[1:06:03] friendship not
[1:06:05] willing to come to your father to come
[1:06:09] to your mother come to your
[1:06:11] pastor that one
[1:06:16] is yes the
[1:06:22] wol they will break your heart into
[1:06:24] pieces
[1:06:29] and then you will begin crying and
[1:06:32] bleeding and blaming everybody you want
[1:06:34] to
[1:06:35] blame but the one to
[1:06:38] blame is
[1:06:40] yourself following due
[1:06:45] process when this young man wanted to
[1:06:49] marry he came to me and told me
[1:06:53] Pastor I said what makes you think
[1:06:57] finally I made up my
[1:06:59] mind the woman I want to
[1:07:01] marry said are you sure he said yes I
[1:07:05] said who is it he said charity I said
[1:07:11] charity I already knew her her sister
[1:07:14] comes to our church here I said are you
[1:07:17] sure said I'm sure I said okay if you
[1:07:20] are serious come to me I want you to
[1:07:23] tell those words to her father
[1:07:27] he said said are you
[1:07:29] ready I'm
[1:07:31] ready that is the serious
[1:07:34] man who wants to be in the
[1:07:39] perfect hallelujah
[1:07:43] hallelujah
[1:07:46] now but you find this young
[1:07:49] mening
[1:07:53] around breaking girl hearts
[1:07:56] and the girls are willing and ready
[1:07:59] to and they begin beding
[1:08:02] they don't need to go
[1:08:05] there perfect will of God is already
[1:08:07] here in his
[1:08:11] word as a pastor I don't say these
[1:08:14] things
[1:08:16] lightly some of my people some of our
[1:08:18] young people have been affected by
[1:08:22] this and so when we get an opportunity
[1:08:25] like this
[1:08:26] we want to say it and say it loud
[1:08:33] and whoever looks on a
[1:08:37] woman to
[1:08:39] after has already
[1:08:43] Comm but how can he look at a
[1:08:48] woman if she's dressed
[1:08:50] mod if she has Spirit of
[1:08:53] Christ it is how they present
[1:09:03] themselves s you are dressing
[1:09:07] a on the
[1:09:09] knee when you sit all your virtues are
[1:09:14] out the ofel
[1:09:18] is we need to break those demons and
[1:09:23] spirits out of our young people
[1:09:28] and by teaching them the
[1:09:30] word and then a man looks at that and
[1:09:34] his heart begins to
[1:09:38] breath I want to talk to both of you
[1:09:42] have
[1:09:44] already now the scure
[1:09:48] says in Galatians
[1:09:52] 519 now the works of the flesh are
[1:09:54] manifest
[1:09:56] which are these
[1:09:59] adultery
[1:10:01] fornication
[1:10:06] unlean and he
[1:10:10] says um and such
[1:10:13] like of the which I tell you
[1:10:16] before as I have also told you in the
[1:10:18] time
[1:10:20] P now listen to this and why is
[1:10:23] important for me to talk about this
[1:10:27] they that which do such
[1:10:31] things shall not
[1:10:35] inherit the kingdom of
[1:10:39] God now the scripture
[1:10:41] says that for that for what if some did
[1:10:45] not
[1:10:47] believe what if some did not
[1:10:50] believe yes shall their unbelief make
[1:10:53] the faith of God without effect
[1:11:02] true every man
[1:11:05] alive tell your neighbor let God be
[1:11:08] true amen so the things of God the words
[1:11:11] of God is
[1:11:14] true God says the adter and the
[1:11:16] fornicators the UN the the murderers the
[1:11:18] EnV the drunk the drunk those shall not
[1:11:21] inher
[1:11:28] it I
[1:11:33] believe this is the
[1:11:35] way that God has placed for a man and a
[1:11:39] woman to live the perfect will of
[1:11:43] God any other way when God makes his
[1:11:47] will unnown through his
[1:11:51] word that is forever settled in heaven
[1:11:55] can never be
[1:11:57] changed un belief cannot hinder
[1:12:00] God others who will not
[1:12:03] believe
[1:12:06] don't they have
[1:12:08] words that people have
[1:12:12] them one night
[1:12:17] stand they
[1:12:19] have one night stand
[1:12:25] uh they have other words I
[1:12:29] don't all those
[1:12:31] things said that do
[1:12:34] such not
[1:12:37] in so if others don't believe
[1:12:40] it we believe
[1:12:42] it we believe it we believe
[1:12:46] it hallelujah hallelujah and we are here
[1:12:49] to prove to the
[1:12:51] devil that there is a
[1:12:53] generation that is going to stand for
[1:12:56] others want they will not hinder
[1:13:00] God unbelief will
[1:13:03] never if 100 do not
[1:13:06] believe the one will
[1:13:08] believe will Rapture the
[1:13:12] one
[1:13:14] 100 are you one of
[1:13:17] them when God makes his will
[1:13:21] known word forever
[1:13:25] belief
[1:13:26] cannot will always be those like
[1:13:31] charity those
[1:13:33] like that will
[1:13:35] decide to follow
[1:13:38] through and do God's perfect
[1:13:42] way in their
[1:13:45] relationship for God say marriage
[1:13:53] is and
[1:13:56] bed you
[1:13:58] sleep someone you never
[1:14:00] Mar it is
[1:14:05] Def God looks at it as an
[1:14:09] Abomination and you need to
[1:14:11] repent because if you don't you will not
[1:14:14] inherit the
[1:14:16] Kingdom you may even be
[1:14:19] married you are here you sleep on
[1:14:22] undefiled bed
[1:14:25] you need to repent while you still have
[1:14:31] the
[1:14:33] but
[1:14:35] and will
[1:14:38] Jud now in God words
[1:14:44] himself this
[1:14:47] Mar we
[1:14:55] amen everybody tell them it
[1:14:59] is this is the most important
[1:15:03] relationship you will ever be a part

[1:15:12] relations like
[1:15:14] parents you have friends siblings

[1:15:34] failed
[1:15:36] this marriage Mar

[1:15:43] one a man a woman will
[1:15:47] be always hold it as such
[1:15:55] always hold it as
[1:15:57] such are you listening to
[1:16:00] me always hold this
[1:16:04] relationship everybody
[1:16:07] else is
[1:16:09] less when it comes to
[1:16:15] this

[1:16:44] else
[1:16:46] second to this
[1:16:48] relationship this is the only
[1:16:51] way you can sustain a marriage
[1:16:55] but when you bring in
[1:16:58] relativ you find women
[1:17:01] today when they see uh uh
[1:17:08] pastors and then their
[1:17:11] husbands can I
[1:17:14] have
[1:17:19] know if she brings
[1:17:21] it all right
[1:17:33] your
[1:17:35] pastor is not more
[1:17:37] important than your
[1:17:40] husband that is what we
[1:17:43] believe we believe in honoring men of
[1:17:47] God honing
[1:17:50] parents we also believe according to
[1:17:53] what our Prophet told us
[1:17:56] the second
[1:17:58] relationship is
[1:18:00] marriage the first being you
[1:18:10] your even when you have your
[1:18:13] children oh you're going to have
[1:18:14] children I see sisters have
[1:18:19] children so your family is
[1:18:22] fruitful I don't doubt
[1:18:25] that you'll be
[1:18:26] fruitful in Isaac's life even when you
[1:18:30] have
[1:18:31] children they are not more
[1:18:34] important than your
[1:18:36] husband even you some men they take
[1:18:41] children even bu secret
[1:18:46] properties even their don't know because
[1:18:49] this is my
[1:18:50] blood oh your wife is your yourself
[1:18:56] not even your BL but
[1:19:02] your praise the name of the Lord I am
[1:19:06] sorry I hope I'm not offending
[1:19:09] some coming
[1:19:13] down can we say
[1:19:16] Amen we believe that to be
[1:19:19] true so many people have had many vows
[1:19:24] made
[1:19:25] vows while
[1:19:27] these you will
[1:19:31] make it is just an
[1:19:35] obligation those vows are just an
[1:19:41] obligation yes have to
[1:19:43] fulf the Real
[1:19:45] Marriage goes beyond those
[1:19:48] vow it
[1:19:50] reflects God perfect
[1:19:55] and your submission to that
[1:19:58] will and I'll just briefly go to the
[1:20:00] last question and then
[1:20:03] we what is the outcome of God's
[1:20:05] permissive
[1:20:10] will now Prophet let me try to stick
[1:20:12] with the not Prophet bam is one example
[1:20:14] of those that have walked in God's
[1:20:16] permissive
[1:20:20] way the permissive will of God is
[1:20:23] exciting
[1:20:26] it is it promises great
[1:20:29] things and appeals to the
[1:20:34] flesh but
[1:20:36] painful
[1:20:37] sorrowful
[1:20:41] and many
[1:20:43] Christians have walked in
[1:20:45] fornication in
[1:20:48] in un
[1:20:50] cleaniness but this is not God's perfect
[1:20:54] will
[1:20:57] Bel a child of God waiting for the
[1:21:00] coming
[1:21:01] of will work in the
[1:21:04] perfect for the scripture says in Romans
[1:21:08] 61 what shall we
[1:21:10] say shall we continue in
[1:21:13] sin May
[1:21:15] abound God
[1:21:17] forbid how shall
[1:21:19] we de to sin live any longer there

[1:22:27] wait I'm sure those animals were very
[1:22:31] F but the man of God in the real of the

[1:24:16] leave and actually not take your
[1:24:22] life he shares his with no
[1:24:26] man and he would actually let
[1:24:29] consequences follow a man or a woman
[1:24:31] that would
[1:24:40] take sometimes listen listen sometimes
[1:24:45] long lifelong
[1:24:51] consequences you have seen things that
