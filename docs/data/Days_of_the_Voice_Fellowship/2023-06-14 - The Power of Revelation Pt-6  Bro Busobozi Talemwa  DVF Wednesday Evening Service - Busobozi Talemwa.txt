would be streaming it's always good to be in the house of the Lord I'm happy to be in the house amen God bless you come here God bless you let us read uh I promise you that today I will take it on from Luke 7 36. [Music] so that's where we are beginning from I've I've been asked by Brother Jason Molina to speak to evening light bright Tabernacle as well Oregon Jason evening be listening to this [Music] and we trust that this will be a blessing to all of us tonight amen I'm reading out of the Book of Luke chapter 7 verse 36. look guys and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment foreign and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment videos he spoke within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner is [Music] and Jesus answering say that to him Simon I have someone to say unto thee and he saith Master say on yes there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one old 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me thereof which of them will love him most of [Music] um [Music] Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgive most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged [Music] and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon see as thou this woman I entered into thy house thou gaveth me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no keys but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oiled out it is not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment whatever I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but whom little is given the same loveth leader [Music] [Music] and this is what Jesus Christ spoke and he spoke first Simon and told Simon the woman's sins are forgiven yes yes and he said unto her let us read the last two verses themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith has saved thee Go In Peace [Music] [Music] So this evening by the grace of God I'm dealing with the power of Revelation one more time the local church here will be part six and I know I've shared this already on the zoom with the Saints at evening light so this might be I think part two or three of that is on this subject and so um I promise that I would now deal with this subject of this woman with the alabaster box but without faitha this is impossible to praise him but without faith one more time but without faith it is impossible to please himself for he that comes to God must believe that he is if you come to God it is a must it's not an option it is a must for you to have faitha or else you're coming to God it will be in vain cartoon and if you come to God believing then he is a rewarder yeah to you that diligently seeks so we know this and we've noticed over the time now that faith and we don't need the 12 years and I will keep saying this until the Holy Spirit takes it off of my heart and he kept on talking about job on the on the hip of us and one person one day asked when are you going to take job out of the earth and he said but he told the congregation but you remember when time was right on [Music] so because God brings spiritual food in this season [Applause] sometimes if it is not supposed to come from this mouth I can even prepare myself and God bring somebody else so he knows when to bring what to bring to you this evening this is what he has brought to you and I wanted to open your eyes it is impossible to please you can never please God no matter what you do this you can live right you can never please you can come to church every service foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] off the good works [Applause] [Applause] look at a man and a woman to offer walks of faith has been moved by something that is beyond what is that called that is called Revelations she said faith is the revelation of the will of God is Faith is the revelation of the will of God [Applause] if you do well will you not be accepted don't see me but Cain was not accepted because he did not do the will of God what was the will of God the will of God foreign foreign [Music] foreign that doesn't please go ahead that is a bad offering it is as good as when you have not given at all over dinner you what does god require of us God requires us to have Revelation what is something that happened something that told him how to give lamb not fruits what was that that did not come from the environment around here they had came from God himself hallelujah amen the Bible says by hearing the world I'm speaking to you thank you I'm not giving you face but I'm speaking to you what I'm saying God himself no man talked to you no man talked you into doing it because it was revealed of the abundance of Revelations hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah I'm preaching to you by revelation hallelujah amen divine revelation [Music] foreign I'm trying to you know be a human according to what God Said I believe the words that's good children that's what most of the time we do divine revelation is something else then I pray with you next seven hours maybe by by Revelation go and start a company I didn't feel things but by revelations them that come to him amen believing God is a rewarded but then there's another one thus say the Lord when you see a vision can never fail absolutely but today I'm speaking to you on Divine Revelations this is what we need to overcome many things and demons we are fighting with him friends I may preach to you because if you don't receive Revelations it is faith has muscles Revelations foreign she was without a child for a long time and God gave him a sign and the same God who gave him aside he told him are you look at me he said give me your son um age [Music] what did Abraham do Ibrahimovic he took the boy yeah here start with the donkeys us amen when God let me tell you that moment when God gives you that relationship Hallelujah man you need to tell some people to stay with the donkeys stay with the donkeys as for me I have the Revelation like this I'm going to do a question I cannot take you with me because you don't have the Revelation that I have I'm going to go up there because I have Revelation when you receive Revelations and takes you higher higher ground of faith and then when you reach there the man reached there with his little boy and the boys asked him as well foreign foreign amen the mind of Jesus Christ while he was there the boy asked him where's the sacrifice don't worry I gotta fire you in other words I know this is revealed to me God must provide us he didn't know that he had evidence it wasn't something he saw okay it was something he believed that faith is something you possess even when you can't oh God says I believe it the Bible says that they are going to be Overcomers that is going to overcome this generation and right there and then in that situation in that condition as bye there was a lamb that God had provided faith never fails many things will failure people will failure systems but Revelations there's a song We Sing only matter to him I believe God this is a cartoon I believe God it shall be done even as he says I believe I believe do you think it was easy for Abraham to believe God the hardest thing for him because he was going to lose his own only child but he did it and it was not without emotions it was not without emotion faith has emotions there was a motion throughout so you can't be a man of faith I have faith foreign [Music] imagine when he was taking the knife an emotion no time can never be put apart of each other that's why I was waiting for you this quote foreign foreign revelation foreign [Music] so Katie when you are stimulated [Music] cancer no one is and he won't mind he will still make his life people will look at him brother Dixon some will power water on him but he won't care because he's drunk joyful say the joy of the Lord is my strength stimulation of satisfactions the accumulation that is Vindicated but it has been proved praise the name of the Lord he says heart not the oil and the wine again what does the oil and the wine means the oil as we took it in Simba means the Holy Spirit [Music] Wine and the oil is connected together in the Bible in worship and the wine as we put that's where I got the idea the stimulation wine stimulates and type of it's natural from stimulation is revelation is revelation so why in the new wine would now the oil and the wine went together in sacrifice what is the oil the Holy Spirit what's the wine um the Holy Spirit and Revelations you can't do worship you can't do worship a God or you can't worship god without emotions have you seen have you ever seen the local worshipers that's worship their local goddesses and gods do they worship that God emotionless if you know what I'm talking about do they worship that God emotionless as a matter of fact they said the truth is they say that a demon has come on you find them pumping [Music] I think foreign foreign we are here there was a girl who had come to church the world was being passed I believe the Church of Christ Alone to be like the Church of Jesus Christ ought to be like that is whereby if they are sinners in the church Hallelujah man who are the Sinners are those that continue in sins contagious I want to be the first one hallelujah amen to catch the fire okay I don't know about you serious one person who has faith in the church May stand up and shout and from there another one let me tell you that's the kind of church that is the Church of the book of Acts the stimulation of Revelation now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit then we find out that oil and wine is connected in worship always connected and the wine I said which come to me but the wine symbolizes power the power of stimulation by revelations and that's when something has been revealed Hallelujah man it gives stimulation because it has present it has been presented by revelations it is something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand remember if the truth is revealed the truth is also Vindicated God constantly no matter how smart the person might be how brilliant it might be if God don't back up what he says there is something wrong foreign one day I watched a little video and this brother came from the mountain and spoke to a little young lady come from the mountains I thank God foreign it was a presumption we should never presume it's between activities that Revelation comes from the world be something different from what the Bible says the word of God is not for private interpretations then when it comes foreign is invite Jesus into their life away take him as a personal savior did you know there is more in him there is more joy there is more promises there is more blessings there is no you accept Jesus as your savior you are baptized but you never receive the Holy Ghost you are still taken by the things of the world the desires of the world are still in you see because you've not gone farther but because you've not gone fast he wants you to go further can we have that hunger you you may be in charge for 10 years they don't move an inch and come dictionary in just three months he completely goes deeper Brothers how he came in the church what is what does things like that church when God reveals to you something you catch it quickly Hallelujah I mean he is a woman and Simon invited Jesus but when Jesus came now whenever you invite Jesus he will always come yeah but here Jesus came and he was given a corner and they sat in a corner and the whole time Simon was entertaining his other videos giving them good seats anointing their head with us oh taking good care of them oh you are my business associate um where is Jesus yes why is Jesus in your life foreign Hallelujah here come Jesus yes sat in the corner right there in the corner but when this woman rushed she didn't look at others she just went straight yeah look at the rich guys what was that she was revealed to her Jesus she didn't stand on him Matula you know you're sitting there now that's it like a rocky worship Him the king of kings of Him in all situations because of our sins because of her life she brought the alabaster and broke it open very expensive on his feet and the woman is very busy on your feet and now it is very awkward right she didn't only do this she brought his feet yesterday she bought his feet I don't know whether Jesus had shoes so no there was no problems and this man doesn't know if he says he is who he is enjoying it he's also a human no name Glory [Music] she was able to wash his feet foreign there is something that happens when we worship by Revelation when you give up your Ambitions no why you know that's a worship when you give down your glory on the floor when you cry in his presence when you break down in his presence okay that is something that happens during that kind of worship she was a sinner she didn't even talk about her sins she was a bad woman she didn't even talk about her condition the only thing she did I said she was sins she worshiped with everything in here with everything in her mind hallelujah amen [Music] foreign [Music] and then Jesus turned to the woman because this is my most favorite moment he looked at the woman he said the woman your sins [Music] I'm that woman this evening your sins I reveal that you have many arranged are forgiven because hallelujah amen what did that the woman who worshiped god um foreign thank you sins that have many are forgiven close your eyes at this moment this is think about the goodness of the Lord think about his grace don't care about anybody else think about yourself at this time please bear me give it a moment think about yourself why do you close your eyes as being that woman you are that woman now can you worship him can you
