[1:10:32] together and were come to him out of
[1:10:34] every city, he spake he spake by a
[1:10:38] parable. A ser went out to sow his seed.
[1:10:41] And as he sowed, some fell by the
[1:10:44] wayside, and it was trodden down, and
[1:10:46] the folds of the air devoured it. And
[1:10:49] some fell upon a rock. And as soon as it
[1:10:51] was sprung up, it withered away because
[1:10:53] it lacked moisture. And some fell among
[1:10:57] thorns. and the thorn sprung up with it
[1:10:59] and choked it. And others fell on good
[1:11:03] ground and sprung up and bear fruit
[1:11:06] 100fold. And when he had these things,
[1:11:09] he cried. And when he said, sorry, these
[1:11:12] things he cried, he that has ears to
[1:11:16] hear to hear, let him hear. And his
[1:11:19] disciples asked him, saying, What might
[1:11:21] this parable be? And he said, "Unto you
[1:11:25] it is given to know the mysteries of the
[1:11:27] kingdom of God, but unto others in
[1:11:30] parables, that seeing they might not
[1:11:32] see, and hearing they might not
[1:11:34] understand." Now the parable is this,
[1:11:37] the seed is the word of God. Those by
[1:11:40] the wayside are they that hear. Then
[1:11:43] cometh the devil, and taketh away the
[1:11:46] word out of their hearts, lest they
[1:11:48] should believe and be saved. They on the
[1:11:52] rock are they which when they hear
[1:11:55] receive the word with joy, and these
[1:11:58] have no root, which for a while believe,
[1:12:02] and in time of temptation fall away. And
[1:12:06] that which fell among thorns, are they
[1:12:10] which when they have heard go forth and
[1:12:14] are choked with the cares and riches and
[1:12:17] pleasures of this life, and bring forth
[1:12:20] no fruit to perfection. But that on the
[1:12:24] good ground are they which in unhornness
[1:12:28] and good heart, having heard the word,
[1:12:31] keep it, and bring forth fruit with
[1:12:34] patience.
[1:12:37] Amen. Brother, maybe you want to read um
[1:12:39] we are in the book of Luke chapter 8
[1:12:42] begin from vers 4 and read all the way
[1:13:03] forchech.
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:33] forget
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:14:02] forchech.
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:15:00] Amen. Amen. Amen. May God bless your
[1:15:02] church. You may be seated.
[1:15:06] Thank you musicians. God bless you.
[1:15:10] Brother Peter, nice to see you.
[1:15:13] Pray for brother Langa's voice.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't work, I'll call brother
[1:15:16] Peter to come and interpret today.
[1:15:20] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:15:23] Well, I just wanted to say that I have
[1:15:25] an announcement, a major announcement
[1:15:27] today.
[1:15:31] regarding um our land um uh fund and all
[1:15:35] that
[1:15:39] and uh so you don't want to miss it.
[1:15:42] But usually um when there's an a good
[1:15:45] atmosphere like this,
[1:15:48] you just want to straight away go to the
[1:15:50] word
[1:15:52] any other business can come come out
[1:15:55] because there are some people maybe even
[1:15:56] I had some people visiting with us for
[1:15:58] the maybe their first time.
[1:16:02] They have not come to hear our business.
[1:16:05] They have come to hear the word. So I
[1:16:08] think we should give the word priority.
[1:16:11] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; So um and then after the um right after
[1:16:15] the word
[1:16:17] we will get into those things
[1:16:20] and uh I'm sure that it's going to
[1:16:22] excite your heart.
[1:16:25] Um so this morning I'm speaking on um
[1:16:28] we're still on our series of our true
[1:16:30] origin.
[1:16:34] I'm happy to see you brother Joshua.
[1:16:37] It's
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; been a while. Oh brother Neville.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Wow. God bless you brother.
[1:16:42] You know, it's it's always good to see
[1:16:44] you in church.
[1:16:47] Amen. Whenever you you don't come to
[1:16:49] church, your pastor feels bad.
[1:16:52] And if your pastor feels bad,
[1:16:55] it means your God feels bad.
[1:16:58] So your pastor is not your God,
[1:17:01] but is your shepherd. He represents
[1:17:03] Christ.
[1:17:06] And so we are going to um speak on
[1:17:09] today. Brother Isaac, I don't know
[1:17:11] whether you'll call it overcoming power
[1:17:12] in the seed part three or you'll call it
[1:17:14] the right atmosphere.
[1:17:23] The right atmosphere,
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:27] but really today I'm speaking on the
[1:17:29] right atmosphere
[1:17:32] for the seed.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:38] And I'm going to begin with a few things
[1:17:40] maybe that I've uh talked about here.
[1:17:42] And if you missed the if you miss any
[1:17:44] part of this series and maybe you are
[1:17:46] not able to come to church, please I
[1:17:48] encourage you to always go back and
[1:17:49] listen.
[1:17:55] So this morning I'm I'm speaking on we
[1:17:58] have been talking much about the seed
[1:18:01] and maybe today we can also first of all
[1:18:04] read John chapter 17. on
[1:18:08] on verses 10 it says, "And all mine are
[1:18:11] thine, and thine are mine, and I am
[1:18:12] glorified in them.
[1:18:26] And I am now and I am I'm now and now I
[1:18:29] am no more in the world,
[1:18:33] but these are in the world.
[1:18:36] And I come to thee, holy father,
[1:18:40] keep through thine own name those whom
[1:18:43] thou hast given me,
[1:18:48] that they may be one even as we are.
[1:18:52] While I was with them in the world,
[1:18:55] I kept them in thy name.
[1:18:59] Those that thou gavest me,
[1:19:02] I have kept
[1:19:07] and none of them is lost,
[1:19:14] but the son of pedition
[1:19:18] that the scripture might be fulfilled.
[1:19:21] I spoke on that extensively on
[1:19:23] Wednesday.
[1:19:26] Um, excuse me, brother Julius. I know
[1:19:28] you came with your blood brother. Is he
[1:19:30] here? Where is he? Is he the one next to
[1:19:32] you? God bless you, sir. You're welcome.
[1:19:35] God bless you, sir. Amen. feel feel at
[1:19:38] church
[1:19:40] and uh just open your heart and
[1:19:44] now you see in this scripture
[1:19:48] Jesus is speaking of his disciples
[1:19:53] his 12 disciples
[1:19:57] are you following me this series are
[1:19:59] really much of study
[1:20:03] and so it is good you be alert
[1:20:07] Even if you go out for a minute, you
[1:20:09] come back, you may miss the whole thing.
[1:20:13] So stay
[1:20:15] in one place and in your mind.
[1:20:18] So here we notice that um Jesus is
[1:20:22] speaking about his 12 disciples
[1:20:26] and this is what he was he was speaking
[1:20:28] of them as he was praying.
[1:20:33] He says, "All mine are thine,
[1:20:36] and thine are mine,
[1:20:38] and I am glorified in them.
[1:20:42] And now I am no more in the world,
[1:20:47] but these are in the world. I come to
[1:20:50] thee, holy father,
[1:20:52] keep through thy own name
[1:20:55] those whom you have given me
[1:20:58] that they may be one."
[1:21:01] Christ loves his to be united.
[1:21:06] Amen. Is it's very important for the
[1:21:09] church to be united.
[1:21:12] The church of Jesus Christ to be united.
[1:21:17] It's just like your body. If your body
[1:21:19] is disintegrated,
[1:21:23] you imagine if you are coming here on
[1:21:24] Sunday morning
[1:21:27] and you look for your legs and you can't
[1:21:29] find them
[1:21:31] or you look for your hands and you can't
[1:21:32] find them and you're like legs, where
[1:21:35] are you? Hands, where are you?
[1:21:38] Eyes, where are you? You understand? You
[1:21:40] would be a disintegrated body.
[1:21:44] But we notice Jesus also has a body.
[1:21:48] God has a body on earth.
[1:21:51] He's no longer here on earth, but he has
[1:21:54] a body on earth.
[1:21:57] And and this body is the body of
[1:21:58] believers.
[1:22:01] And he wants that body to be united.
[1:22:06] If we are united,
[1:22:09] there is no force can defeat us.
[1:22:12] If the body is united,
[1:22:15] there is no power can destroy us.
[1:22:18] Because God said through Jesus Christ
[1:22:22] that even all the gates of hell shall
[1:22:25] not prevail
[1:22:28] against that body of Christ
[1:22:31] against the church. But remember, we've
[1:22:33] been talking about the true church and
[1:22:35] the false church.
[1:22:38] We've been talking about the true vine
[1:22:39] and the false vine.
[1:22:42] You know, the the true vine and the the
[1:22:45] false vine are both in the same
[1:22:51] But but you see he said at the time of
[1:22:54] the harvest
[1:22:56] we are going to be able to separate the
[1:22:57] false from the from the truth.
[1:23:01] And it is so close
[1:23:04] that if it were possible
[1:23:06] it will receive the elect.
[1:23:09] But in that scripture
[1:23:12] when he says if it were possible
[1:23:15] it means it is impossible
[1:23:19] to deceive the hect.
[1:23:21] So I am sure that the elect cannot be
[1:23:25] deceived.
[1:23:27] And that's why even Jesus while he was
[1:23:29] praying
[1:23:31] he said I have I have kept them in thy
[1:23:34] name
[1:23:36] those that are in Christ
[1:23:39] are kept in the name of Christ.
[1:23:42] The name of God is Jesus Christ.
[1:23:47] And the Bible says those that have been
[1:23:49] baptized into Christ
[1:23:52] I have put on Christ.
[1:23:55] I have kept them in thy name.
[1:23:58] That those that thou gave me
[1:24:02] I have kept
[1:24:04] and none of them is lost.
[1:24:08] But you remember he called 12
[1:24:12] but he says none of them is lost. So
[1:24:15] does he mean even Judas was not lost?
[1:24:19] No. is not talking about Judas here
[1:24:24] because Judas was not among those
[1:24:30] that cannot be deceived.
[1:24:33] Judas did not have the seed of God in
[1:24:36] him.
[1:24:39] Judas had a serpent seed in him.
[1:24:44] There are people on the world today
[1:24:48] who have a seed of the sermon.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Let me put it this way. Who are the seed
[1:24:54] of the ser?
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; They can never be saved.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's one of the teachings that we
[1:25:06] differentiate with all the other
[1:25:07] denominations.
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] Some denominations teach
[1:25:14] all will be saved.
[1:25:18] And some one denomination that I know
[1:25:20] of.
[1:25:22] Even if you have an uncle and he died,
[1:25:27] he was never baptized.
[1:25:29] They will tell you to baptize on his
[1:25:30] behalf
[1:25:33] because they believe everyone is to be
[1:25:34] saved.
[1:25:38] But that's not true.
[1:25:40] The Bible in the book of first John
[1:25:43] says there are children of God
[1:25:47] and there are children of the devil
[1:25:51] is in the Bible.
[1:25:54] So we have two different vines,
[1:25:59] two different seeds
[1:26:02] in the same church
[1:26:05] but they only manifest properly in the
[1:26:07] end time.
[1:26:12] All right. What makes them who they are?
[1:26:17] It is not what they do
[1:26:20] or what they don't do.
[1:26:23] Are you hearing me now? Be very alert
[1:26:25] this morning.
[1:26:28] If you are not careful,
[1:26:31] you can dismiss a child of God and call
[1:26:33] them serpentes
[1:26:38] because they have done something wrong.
[1:26:42] And if you're not careful,
[1:26:44] you're going to summarize everything and
[1:26:47] put it under legalism.
[1:26:51] And you will say the seed of God cannot
[1:26:55] do this, cannot do this, cannot do that.
[1:26:58] So it means if someone does something
[1:27:01] wrong
[1:27:03] one or two or three times
[1:27:06] it means there are
[1:27:09] but who among you here
[1:27:12] can stand and say
[1:27:15] since they believed the message
[1:27:18] since they came to Christ
[1:27:20] has never done anything wrong.
[1:27:25] All of you are guilty.
[1:27:28] You have done things wrong.
[1:27:31] But I'm here to tell you whether you
[1:27:34] what you have done that is wrong
[1:27:38] does not testify to who you are.
[1:27:45] What you have done that is right
[1:27:48] does not make you who you are not.
[1:27:54] You cannot say because I dress well,
[1:27:58] I don't drink, I've never lied, I've
[1:28:02] never done any moral thing.
[1:28:05] Therefore, I'm a seed of God.
[1:28:08] No,
[1:28:11] what you do that is good
[1:28:14] in your own self
[1:28:17] is not necessarily recognized by God.
[1:28:24] because he even says the works of your
[1:28:27] own righteousness
[1:28:30] are as filthy rags before God.
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:35] So when God looks at the good things
[1:28:37] that you do,
[1:28:39] he sees you as a mad person
[1:28:42] because it is only a mad person that
[1:28:44] wears filthy rugs.
[1:28:48] So does it mean you should not do good
[1:28:51] things? You should not live the right
[1:28:53] kind of life. No, that's not what is
[1:28:56] meaning. He's saying I am not looking at
[1:29:00] what you are doing.
[1:29:03] I am not looking at what you have not
[1:29:04] done
[1:29:06] right or wrong.
[1:29:08] But I am looking at the seed
[1:29:12] that is within you.
[1:29:15] That is what separates you
[1:29:18] from everything else.
[1:29:21] And they that have the seed
[1:29:24] of God in their life, there are they
[1:29:27] that will overcome the world.
[1:29:31] This is the victory
[1:29:34] that overcomes the world. We can preach
[1:29:36] the word. We can shout the word. We can
[1:29:40] talk the word. It cannot make you a
[1:29:43] seed.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; The word will only bring out who you
[1:29:51] are.
[1:29:56] So both will do wrong.
[1:30:00] But there's something
[1:30:04] that differentiates them
[1:30:06] is the nature
[1:30:09] of the seed.
[1:30:12] in them.
[1:30:16] Now,
[1:30:18] those that have the nature of the seed
[1:30:20] of God,
[1:30:23] they don't just become,
[1:30:26] they were
[1:30:28] in the mind of God
[1:30:31] before they were born.
[1:30:34] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:30:37] That's why it's not even water baptism
[1:30:40] that saves you.
[1:30:45] If it was the thief on the cross would
[1:30:48] never get it.
[1:30:51] How many are following me? You really
[1:30:54] need to follow me closely.
[1:30:58] It's not water baptism
[1:31:00] that makes you the elect.
[1:31:02] Because if it was,
[1:31:05] some who were never baptized
[1:31:08] in water like the thief on the cross
[1:31:11] would never get it,
[1:31:14] but he got it. Why? Because he had a
[1:31:17] seed of God in him.
[1:31:20] So how do you know
[1:31:23] he that has the seed? The one that has
[1:31:26] the seed, will always believe the word,
[1:31:31] will always receive the word,
[1:31:35] he will be a good ground.
[1:31:39] He will have a good atmosphere,
[1:31:42] the right atmosphere for the word to
[1:31:46] flourish out of their life.
[1:31:52] and he will be like a river of water
[1:31:55] that is gushing out of him.
[1:31:59] So we see
[1:32:01] that Jesus here is praying and he says
[1:32:05] none of them
[1:32:09] none of them is lost. Meaning the ones
[1:32:11] you have given me none of them is lost.
[1:32:15] But then he says, "But
[1:32:18] the son of pedition
[1:32:20] was he one of the 12 years."
[1:32:23] Who? Judas. And I got on Wednesday I
[1:32:26] gave you an example. And I said Judas
[1:32:28] did wrong,
[1:32:30] but also Peter did wrong.
[1:32:32] Which was a better sin?
[1:32:36] Which was the worst?
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:40] Both of them were sinners
[1:32:43] as far as what they did was concerned.
[1:32:46] But that did not define who they were.
[1:32:52] Are you following me?
[1:32:55] But here when Judah sinned,
[1:32:58] he did not have a heart
[1:33:03] that convicted him
[1:33:07] to walk away
[1:33:09] from his sin.
[1:33:13] He did not have the mind
[1:33:17] to believe
[1:33:18] in the saving blood of Jesus.
[1:33:23] He did not understand the power of
[1:33:26] grace.
[1:33:29] He could not listen follow me here. He
[1:33:32] could not forgive himself.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; He condemned himself.
[1:33:42] more than God.
[1:33:44] And he hanged himself
[1:33:47] and went to hell.
[1:33:52] But Peter, he did the same thing. But
[1:33:57] what happened? He was convicted.
[1:34:01] He felt so sorry
[1:34:04] that he had done what he had done.
[1:34:07] He was not proud of it.
[1:34:10] He was not happy about it. His heart
[1:34:14] condemned him. Yes.
[1:34:16] And condemnation translated into
[1:34:19] conviction.
[1:34:23] Amen. And then he realized there is
[1:34:27] nothing good
[1:34:30] himself
[1:34:31] that can save him that can redeem him.
[1:34:35] So he turned to the wall.
[1:34:38] He cried to the glory of God because he
[1:34:41] knew his help cometh from the Lord.
[1:34:45] Creator of heaven and earth,
[1:34:48] the seed of God will always will always
[1:34:51] will always will always turn to God
[1:34:58] because we know we know that we know we
[1:35:02] cannot redeem ourselves. We cannot save
[1:35:05] ourselves. We cannot help ourselves, we
[1:35:08] are helpless without God.
[1:35:13] And when we come and turn to him and cry
[1:35:16] out to him,
[1:35:19] then he says, "Oh my son, what is it?
[1:35:24] What have done? What did you do? I don't
[1:35:27] see it."
[1:35:29] Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You remember the bleach of the blood?
[1:35:33] I don't see it. Cuz the moment you
[1:35:35] confess your sin,
[1:35:37] the Bible says if we say we have no sin,
[1:35:42] we make God a liar because we have all
[1:35:45] sinned. If we are we confess our sin, he
[1:35:49] is righteous. He is just to forgive us
[1:35:55] of all our sins.
[1:35:58] He there's a bleach of the blood
[1:36:01] will wash it away. But even the best of
[1:36:04] the demons
[1:36:06] cannot be able to find it again.
[1:36:10] When a child of God has sinned
[1:36:13] and has confessed his sin.
[1:36:15] That sin goes under the blood
[1:36:21] and is divorced from him.
[1:36:25] God never sees it again.
[1:36:30] And when he comes to accuse you before
[1:36:33] God,
[1:36:36] God says, "I can't see anything they
[1:36:37] have done. I can't see anything they
[1:36:40] have done. They are perfect. They are
[1:36:43] right. They are holy. They have no
[1:36:46] blemish. Why? Because they that are in
[1:36:49] Christ
[1:36:51] are a new creation.
[1:36:53] Old things have passed away.
[1:36:57] All things behind
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:08] of them is lost.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; If you are a seed of God,
[1:37:14] you can never be lost.
[1:37:17] Tell your neighbor,
[1:37:19] it doesn't matter who they are, if they
[1:37:21] are the seed of God,
[1:37:24] they'll never be lost. But if they are
[1:37:27] not, even if you tell them, it doesn't
[1:37:30] change anything. So tell them you will
[1:37:34] never be lost.
[1:37:36] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; When if the seed of God
[1:37:40] when they hear that
[1:37:42] the seed in them
[1:37:45] is somehow quickened.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah.
[1:37:52] Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; But the son of petition
[1:37:56] H let me record something that I I read
[1:37:58] already. We further learned this is from
[1:38:01] the Ladian church
[1:38:04] that these two vines
[1:38:07] would grow side by side
[1:38:10] until the end of the age.
[1:38:13] When both would come to maturity
[1:38:17] and both would be havevested,
[1:38:21] the first vine would not overcome and
[1:38:24] destroy the true vine.
[1:38:29] The first vine has a mission. Follow me
[1:38:32] here now.
[1:38:35] The mission of the first vine
[1:38:38] is to destroy the true vine.
[1:38:41] But here he says the false vine can
[1:38:45] never overcome and can never destroy the
[1:38:48] true vine.
[1:38:53] But then neither would the true vine
[1:38:58] be able to bring the first vine
[1:39:04] into a saving relationship with Christ.
[1:39:12] Revelation is progressive.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I'll confess.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I used to think
[1:39:24] that as long as you preach the word to
[1:39:26] somebody,
[1:39:30] they will change.
[1:39:34] I used to think that
[1:39:36] but I was wrong.
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:39] You can preach the word
[1:39:42] to the false vine.
[1:39:45] It can never change them.
[1:39:49] Matter of fact, it will make them worse.
[1:39:56] The more they hear the word, the more
[1:39:59] they realize who they are.
[1:40:03] Let me tell you church, the word
[1:40:07] shows
[1:40:08] or let me call it put it this way
[1:40:10] manifest
[1:40:12] your true origin.
[1:40:17] It doesn't matter who you are. The word
[1:40:21] removes the mystery,
[1:40:25] reveals the hidden things.
[1:40:28] Because the Bible say the word of God is
[1:40:32] powerful. Is powerful. It's powerful.
[1:40:36] He's like a two-edged sword.
[1:40:42] Soul and SP
[1:40:45] will design you.
[1:40:47] That's how powerful the word is.
[1:40:50] The word will show your joy.
[1:40:53] The word will reveal who you are.
[1:40:56] The word will show your true colors.
[1:40:59] The word will expose you.
[1:41:02] The word will manifest you.
[1:41:04] So if you are a false vine,
[1:41:07] you will become worse.
[1:41:10] If you're a true vine, you will become
[1:41:13] better and better, better,
[1:41:15] better and better.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; The more of the word you enjoy,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; the more you will improve.
[1:41:25] Who are you?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I am a true vine.
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:31] But then here he says, "Neither a true
[1:41:34] vine
[1:41:36] cannot be able to bring the first vine
[1:41:39] into a saving relationship with Jesus
[1:41:40] Christ.
[1:41:50] So listen, bring your friends to church.
[1:41:55] You don't know who they are.
[1:41:58] Some of them may be true vine,
[1:42:01] but they hidden in those things.
[1:42:04] Are you following me? Bring them to
[1:42:07] church.
[1:42:10] We don't know who they are.
[1:42:12] That's why even on the pullpit,
[1:42:15] you preachers,
[1:42:17] quit quit telling people what to do.
[1:42:21] Quit being legalistic.
[1:42:25] Just give them the word.
[1:42:30] Whenever you give somebody the word,
[1:42:33] it doesn't matter how they are. It
[1:42:36] doesn't matter who they are. The word
[1:42:39] will reveal who they are.
[1:42:42] Amen. Bring them here wearing trousers.
[1:42:47] Bring them wearing trousers.
[1:42:50] We know women are not supposed to wear
[1:42:52] trousers according to the Bible.
[1:42:59] But they don't know.
[1:43:01] So bring them. Let them hear the word.
[1:43:05] Amen. I will never talk about it when
[1:43:06] they come.
[1:43:11] I will not. So don't fear to bring your
[1:43:14] friend
[1:43:16] because she's wearing a trouser. Some of
[1:43:18] you, you killed a seed before they even
[1:43:20] realize who they are.
[1:43:25] You can come, but don't wear a trouser.
[1:43:28] But I don't have anything else. I'm
[1:43:31] sorry. First to get money and buy a
[1:43:33] skirt.
[1:43:36] What?
[1:43:38] God forgive you.
[1:43:41] God forgive you for thinking laws can
[1:43:44] save everybody.
[1:43:48] Bring them the way they are.
[1:43:50] I can assure you in not so long a time
[1:43:54] when they hear the word you are hearing.
[1:43:57] They will realize who they are. Many of
[1:44:00] them will say, "Oh, I I don't need to
[1:44:03] wear them.
[1:44:06] There is a precious brother in Ethiopia
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; called
[1:44:11] professor professor
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; in the university.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; You know what happened? He came to a
[1:44:17] church and he loved this message.
[1:44:20] Another sister y brought him.
[1:44:22] So so he loved the word and he told me
[1:44:25] pastor I love this message so much
[1:44:29] and I showed who I am. I need to be
[1:44:32] baptized. So I baptized him in the name
[1:44:35] of our Lord Jesus Christ. And then he
[1:44:37] told me, "Pastor, but I don't want to
[1:44:39] tell my wife about it now
[1:44:43] because I fear for my marriage.
[1:44:47] We may divorce
[1:44:49] because I know she can't receive this.
[1:44:53] It is very difficult." But I told him,
[1:44:56] "Brother, why do you say so?" And he
[1:44:59] said, "Oh, she loves makeup.
[1:45:02] Oh, she loves hearing. Oh, she loves
[1:45:04] wearing trousers. I said, don't you
[1:45:07] worry about it, brother.
[1:45:09] Bring her to church. Don't talk about
[1:45:11] it. And I said, brother, I promise you,
[1:45:16] I will not talk about it. Just bring her
[1:45:18] to church and see what God is going to
[1:45:21] do. We cannot know who she is.
[1:45:25] until she hears the word. But I tell you
[1:45:27] church, when she came to church, 1 2 3 4
[1:45:32] 5 6 months,
[1:45:36] within the first 3 months,
[1:45:40] she reduced her makeup.
[1:45:43] She started wearing trousers and
[1:45:45] sometimes she was not wearing.
[1:45:50] The next three months, trousers was
[1:45:53] completely gone.
[1:45:56] No one told her to stop.
[1:46:00] Makeup was completely gone.
[1:46:04] No one told her to stop.
[1:46:07] Within the end of the sixth month,
[1:46:11] she told me, "I want to be baptized."
[1:46:14] No one told her to do it.
[1:46:17] We just kept on preaching the word.
[1:46:22] Brother, I tell you this word has no
[1:46:25] power.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; But the power it has only will manifest
[1:46:30] who you truly are.
[1:46:35] It will show your true origin.
[1:46:38] If you came from God,
[1:46:41] the word will remind you you are not of
[1:46:43] this world. You came from above. You
[1:46:46] came from God. You don't need to live in
[1:46:49] sin. You don't need to live like that.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You don't need to live like that. I
[1:46:55] won't tell you. I won't tell you. But
[1:46:58] the seed of God in you
[1:47:01] will be quickened.
[1:47:03] Oh, help me preach this church. The seed
[1:47:06] will be quickened.
[1:47:08] And you will be energized.
[1:47:10] And all of a sudden, you will say, "I
[1:47:14] don't need this anymore. I don't need
[1:47:16] this anymore. I don't need
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe this?"
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; So, we cannot bring the false vine into
[1:47:35] a relationship.
[1:47:40] But we don't know who they are. So bring
[1:47:43] them
[1:47:44] unless give them the water
[1:47:49] and we'll find out.
[1:47:55] He continues to say,
[1:47:57] "We learned the most amazing truth
[1:48:02] that the Holy Spirit could
[1:48:06] and would would fall upon the
[1:48:08] unregenerated
[1:48:12] vine Christians
[1:48:20] and he will manifest powerfully
[1:48:24] in various signs and wonders.
[1:48:29] Even as Judas had a definite ministry
[1:48:35] in the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:38] he himself was pronounced to be a devil.
[1:48:45] Is that Sister Mary?
[1:48:48] Your chair is right here. There's a
[1:48:51] Please come over here.
[1:48:54] I love my amen corner to be on this
[1:48:55] side.
[1:48:58] Praise the name of the Lord. So follow
[1:49:00] me closely now. What does he say? He
[1:49:04] says that the Holy Spirit,
[1:49:07] not an evil spirit.
[1:49:10] The Holy
[1:49:14] Church, are you here today? The Holy
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; will do what will fall upon the false
[1:49:21] vine.
[1:49:25] and manifest powerfully
[1:49:29] in various signs and wonders.
[1:49:34] Pastor, how come?
[1:49:37] Because it is possible
[1:49:39] for the false vine to be religious
[1:49:47] but not a Christian.
[1:49:53] Even Judas had a definite ministry.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Judas cast out demons.
[1:50:01] Judas drove away powers of darkness.
[1:50:05] Yet he himself
[1:50:08] Jesus said, "I call 12 of you and one of
[1:50:10] you is a devil."
[1:50:15] Yet he did miracles, signs, and wonders.
[1:50:19] So the way we are able to know who is
[1:50:23] who
[1:50:25] is not by signs, miracles and wonders.
[1:50:31] If you are looking at that, you are
[1:50:33] looking in the wrong place,
[1:50:38] signs, miracles or wonders or nothing
[1:50:43] doesn't define who the person is.
[1:50:47] It is possible for someone to have a
[1:50:49] ministry of miracles, signs and wonders
[1:50:55] and preach a false doctrine.
[1:51:00] Balam was one of them.
[1:51:03] He had a powerful min prophetic
[1:51:05] ministry.
[1:51:08] He How many agree with me that he was
[1:51:10] hearing from God?
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; He was the man was anointed truly.
[1:51:17] genuinely and his prophecies were
[1:51:20] accurate.
[1:51:23] But his teaching ministry
[1:51:27] was false.
[1:51:30] He led the people away from God.
[1:51:36] He told them to go in the parties of
[1:51:37] non-believers.
[1:51:40] He told them it was okay to dress the
[1:51:42] way they wanted.
[1:51:45] He told them it was okay to go to the
[1:51:46] unbeliever's parties.
[1:51:50] He told them it was not a big deal if
[1:51:52] they fornicated.
[1:51:55] He told them it was not really really
[1:51:57] bothering God.
[1:52:00] Grace covered for that.
[1:52:03] And these people
[1:52:05] ended up in those kind of patterns.
[1:52:09] And when God saw it, he destroyed them
[1:52:13] all.
[1:52:15] But they were misled by an anointed man
[1:52:18] with a false ministry.
[1:52:25] Never be destroyed or deceived by the
[1:52:28] anointing.
[1:52:31] Do not look at the anointing, brother.
[1:52:34] Look at the word.
[1:52:36] Test every ministry
[1:52:39] by the word.
[1:52:41] What are they teaching?
[1:52:43] Do they believe in one God? Do they
[1:52:46] believe in water baptism in the name of
[1:52:48] our Lord Jesus Christ. What do they
[1:52:50] believe about the ministry?
[1:52:52] What is the position of women and men in
[1:52:54] the ministry?
[1:52:57] This is how you test every ministry.
[1:53:00] They have to be true to the word.
[1:53:04] If they are not, walk away even from the
[1:53:07] anointing
[1:53:10] because it will mislead you.
[1:53:14] So you see church. Now harvest time.
[1:53:18] Yes, harvest time. The two vines that
[1:53:22] grew together
[1:53:24] and intertwined their branches are now
[1:53:26] being separated at harvest time.
[1:53:33] The fruits of those vines which were at
[1:53:35] such variance will be gathered into
[1:53:38] separate Ghanas.
[1:53:44] The two spirits will go to their
[1:53:46] separate destinations.
[1:53:50] Now, now in the end time, now it is time
[1:53:54] to heed the final call.
[1:53:58] that comes only to the witch bride.
[1:54:03] Am I having a witch bride here?
[1:54:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Come out of
[1:54:11] our
[1:54:13] my people. Amen. That ye be not
[1:54:15] partakers of our sins.
[1:54:18] But ye the wheat receive not her tears
[1:54:22] plagues
[1:54:26] plagues are coming.
[1:54:28] Plagues are coming. Tell your neighbor
[1:54:30] plagues are coming. Plagues are coming.
[1:54:35] The Bible says come out of that's why we
[1:54:38] don't have fellowship with them.
[1:54:41] Come out of that's why we don't even go
[1:54:43] to their churches.
[1:54:45] come out of our so we can join in the
[1:54:47] cast of churches with them.
[1:54:51] The voice of the end time message
[1:54:55] the end time messenger
[1:54:58] is crying out to the wy bride.
[1:55:02] Come out of her my people.
[1:55:05] Come out of her.
[1:55:08] Do not receive of her plagues.
[1:55:12] What is it? The great tribulation
[1:55:16] which is the sixth seal.
[1:55:19] It is coming
[1:55:22] is not my portion.
[1:55:25] The tribulation is not my portion
[1:55:28] but it is coming and some are preparing
[1:55:32] and waiting for it.
[1:55:35] It's not my portion.
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:39] All elect of God
[1:55:42] be aware.
[1:55:43] Study closely. Be careful. Work out your
[1:55:48] salvation
[1:55:50] with fear and trembling.
[1:55:53] Rely upon God
[1:55:56] and be strong in his might.
[1:55:59] Your adversary. The devil is even now
[1:56:04] going about like a rolling lion
[1:56:08] seeking whom he will devour.
[1:56:11] Wash unto prayer.
[1:56:13] and be steady fast. This is the end
[1:56:16] time.
[1:56:18] Both the true and the false vine are
[1:56:20] coming into maturity.
[1:56:25] But before the wheat matures,
[1:56:28] those ripened tears must be bound for
[1:56:32] burning.
[1:56:38] How are they being bound?
[1:56:40] They are being bound in the an
[1:56:42] organization called World Council of
[1:56:45] Churches
[1:56:51] is a bundling
[1:56:56] for burning.
[1:56:58] If they are a member or a part of it,
[1:57:02] they will not receive they will they
[1:57:04] will not be persecuted.
[1:57:07] They receive the mark of the beast
[1:57:11] to mark that they abandoned
[1:57:16] together for burning.
[1:57:19] But what about the bride? She will not
[1:57:22] join them.
[1:57:24] Hallelujah.
[1:57:26] She will be prepared
[1:57:29] for the ch for the translation,
[1:57:32] for the change of our body,
[1:57:34] for the rapture.
[1:57:36] But right now the two spirits are at
[1:57:38] work in two vines.
[1:57:43] Come out from among the
[1:57:46] start to overcome.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Start to overcome.
[1:57:50] Start to overcome
[1:57:54] and you may be considered praiseworthy
[1:58:00] for your Lord and you'll be fit
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; to reign and rule with him.
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:11] Amen.
[1:58:12] Amen.
[1:58:14] Hallelujah.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:17] Now let me go into the learning the
[1:58:19] teaching for today
[1:58:22] for maybe 25 minutes or so.
[1:58:25] Listen,
[1:58:26] the the right atmosphere
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; is what the seed needs
[1:58:33] to be able to mature.
[1:58:38] If you a seed of God,
[1:58:41] the last thing you should worry about
[1:58:45] is whether you will make it in the
[1:58:46] rapture or not.
[1:58:50] Are you following?
[1:58:52] The last thing you should be concerned
[1:58:54] about
[1:58:57] is whether sin will defeat you or not.
[1:59:02] You can't be defeated by sin.
[1:59:05] Hallelujah. You cannot.
[1:59:09] You cannot
[1:59:12] now. It doesn't matter what you think
[1:59:14] about it.
[1:59:16] Hear what I'm telling you. You may be
[1:59:19] saying, "Pastor, you're speaking like
[1:59:20] that because you do not know my life."
[1:59:24] You know what I go through
[1:59:27] in my mind, in my life, in my actions,
[1:59:30] in my in my this and that.
[1:59:33] Do you think God doesn't know it?
[1:59:36] Oh, you think it took him by surprise?
[1:59:40] Oh, pastor, what about my past?
[1:59:44] Well, none of us has a good past.
[1:59:48] If it was on the basis of the past,
[1:59:52] none of us would be saved.
[1:59:56] So friends, you have to look beyond
[2:00:01] all that.
[2:00:05] Do not put your mind
[2:00:09] always to your weakness
[2:00:14] to the extent that you will even fail to
[2:00:16] come to church.
[2:00:23] You let your problems and your
[2:00:26] weaknesses define you
[2:00:31] to an extent.
[2:00:33] You cannot do anything for the Lord.
[2:00:39] It's like the devil has put you in cups
[2:00:43] and you are a slave
[2:00:46] of the devil.
[2:00:49] But I want to tell you this morning,
[2:00:53] here is what you should do.
[2:00:57] Your problems,
[2:00:59] I call them insufficiencies.
[2:01:04] in encumbrances.
[2:01:08] Are you following
[2:01:10] those encumbrances,
[2:01:13] trouble,
[2:01:15] things that are heavy, you know, he
[2:01:17] heavy loading,
[2:01:19] your weaknesses,
[2:01:22] your fears,
[2:01:24] that is not even in the picture here.
[2:01:30] We are not even talking about it.
[2:01:33] It is so insignificant,
[2:01:36] so insignificant
[2:01:39] that if you are a sin,
[2:01:41] God doesn't even address you about it.
[2:01:46] No, no, no. He doesn't address you about
[2:01:48] it.
[2:01:53] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:01:56] He doesn't address you about it.
[2:01:59] Why? He only speaks
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; and he says,
[2:02:04] "I'm I'm coming back to take a church, a
[2:02:08] church without spot." Without wrinkle,
[2:02:12] without spot. How many here have no
[2:02:15] spot?
[2:02:17] Without wrinkle.
[2:02:19] What?
[2:02:20] Washing the blood of the lamb
[2:02:23] that is holy,
[2:02:25] sinless, justified.
[2:02:28] That's what God says.
[2:02:30] So do you mean God is blind?
[2:02:34] Can't you see
[2:02:36] that you brother someone is a
[2:02:42] so insignificant
[2:02:45] that he doesn't waste your time and his
[2:02:48] time talking about it
[2:02:52] because he knows this one thing.
[2:02:55] Whatever he has said
[2:02:57] will be whatever he has seen must happen
[2:03:02] because he is God.
[2:03:06] And that's why he said in every
[2:03:08] generation
[2:03:10] they are overcomer
[2:03:14] over.
[2:03:17] That's what he said. He took all your
[2:03:20] sins.
[2:03:21] He took all your problems.
[2:03:24] He took all your weaknesses
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; and he put it under one word
[2:03:30] over.
[2:03:33] Hallelujah. What are you overcoming?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; You're overcoming your weakness, your
[2:03:38] problem, your trouble, your weakness,
[2:03:39] everything.
[2:03:43] I must overcome. Tell yourself, I must
[2:03:45] overcome.
[2:03:47] I am an overcomer.
[2:03:50] That's what God sees and that's what the
[2:03:52] devil hates
[2:03:55] for you to know.
[2:03:58] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:04:00] But only the elect
[2:04:03] will not be deceived.
[2:04:08] The shark and the tears, the shark of
[2:04:11] the tears cannot be hair with a seat.
[2:04:15] Overcoming
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:18] power is not in the word itself.
[2:04:23] But it is in the seed.
[2:04:27] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:30] Where is it?
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Where is it?
[2:04:36] Overcoming power is in the sea.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Overcoming power is in the sea.
[2:04:47] Hallelujah.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Look around if your neighbors doors and
[2:04:51] tell them wake up.
[2:04:58] The devil doesn't want you to hear this.
[2:05:01] Overcoming power
[2:05:04] is where
[2:05:07] is in the seed.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I feel like saying that a million times.
[2:05:15] overcoming power.
[2:05:18] Now, did you realize the word also is a
[2:05:20] seed?
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; So, what seed am I talking about?
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the seed which is
[2:05:29] already in you.
[2:05:32] Why?
[2:05:37] that those whom he forneew
[2:05:42] he predestined men.
[2:05:46] Listen to be conformed
[2:05:51] to the image
[2:05:53] of who? Of God. Now, now listen to this.
[2:05:58] He chose you when and where
[2:06:03] he chose you in him
[2:06:08] when
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:06:14] There was nothing to choose from
[2:06:18] because remember there was no
[2:06:20] pre-existence.
[2:06:24] So there was only God.
[2:06:27] And he says he chose you in him. So who
[2:06:30] are you? You are God.
[2:06:35] Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] What is the word? The word of God is
[2:06:40] God.
[2:06:42] In the beginning was the word and the
[2:06:44] word was God.
[2:06:46] The word was with God. The word was God.
[2:06:51] So now the word is a seed and you are a
[2:06:55] seed.
[2:06:57] How many now get it?
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:01] Hallelujah.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; So when I say overcoming power
[2:07:06] is not in the word.
[2:07:09] I mean is not in the preaching of the
[2:07:12] word
[2:07:15] but truly overcoming power
[2:07:18] is in the word because the word is a
[2:07:21] seed and you are a seed. So when you
[2:07:25] hear the preaching of the word because
[2:07:27] you are a seed the seed in you is by the
[2:07:31] preaching of the word.
[2:07:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that's why what the bride
[2:07:40] rejoices over
[2:07:43] the bride amen is stimulated
[2:07:46] when they hear the preaching of the
[2:07:48] word.
[2:07:50] Why? Because it is showing who they are.
[2:07:53] It is reminding them where they come
[2:07:55] from.
[2:07:57] [Music]
[2:07:59] Amen. Only the seed can be quickened.
[2:08:03] The seed needs a certain atmosphere.
[2:08:10] to be quickened
[2:08:13] and to be able to come to maturity.
[2:08:18] You may be now I'm talking to seed. I
[2:08:21] don't have time for ser.
[2:08:24] If you are the seed of God,
[2:08:27] you may still be confused
[2:08:31] in this world
[2:08:34] and lose what you need to get
[2:08:39] and lose totally completely your
[2:08:42] identity
[2:08:46] because the atmosphere is wrong.
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:52] But before I continue,
[2:08:54] I will say this,
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; it is impossible for you to be lost.
[2:09:00] The reason is the reason is
[2:09:03] you were in him. And he says none of
[2:09:06] them is
[2:09:09] lost. So the devil can delay you,
[2:09:15] but he can't stop you.
[2:09:21] Oh mama. Hallelujah.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching about
[2:09:25] the devil can delay you
[2:09:29] but he cannot stop you.
[2:09:33] The Bible say you were predestinated.
[2:09:39] That means God saw your end at the
[2:09:42] beginning.
[2:09:46] So your destiny is not lost.
[2:09:50] God knows your destiny.
[2:09:53] God knows how this will end.
[2:09:56] God knows how you will end up.
[2:09:59] Someone may say you will end up bad.
[2:10:02] No, no, no. If you are a seed of God,
[2:10:06] you can never end up back.
[2:10:09] Because God has predestinated.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; He knows where you will end up.
[2:10:17] Hallelujah. The devil can delay
[2:10:20] your
[2:10:22] he may stop you with discoveries.
[2:10:25] He will deny you with this. He may push
[2:10:27] you with that. But the devil has to
[2:10:30] understand you are a seed to begin.
[2:10:33] He cannot stop your destiny.
[2:10:37] My destiny is not lost.
[2:10:39] I know where I am going. like Jesus. I
[2:10:43] know where I came from and I know where
[2:10:45] you are going because I am in the image
[2:10:48] of God.
[2:10:50] Hallelujah.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:54] You know the devil can bring some little
[2:10:55] demons
[2:10:57] and make you think you you are an
[2:10:59] immoral person. No, you are not an
[2:11:02] immoral person. He's delaying you with
[2:11:05] that.
[2:11:06] But he has to understand soon and very
[2:11:09] soon you shall see the king soon and
[2:11:13] very soon you will go where you are
[2:11:15] supposed to go.
[2:11:17] The devil can delay you with poverty
[2:11:21] because he knows when you're poor you
[2:11:24] can't study the word and you will be
[2:11:26] disturbed in your mind. But you know
[2:11:28] what? You know what? Even poverty cannot
[2:11:32] stop you.
[2:11:34] poverty is only a delaying tactic.
[2:11:38] So the devil might as well know
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; in everything that comes to me to you.
[2:11:46] He better gives up
[2:11:51] is fighting a losing battle.
[2:11:56] Hallelujah.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may be your family
[2:12:00] the devil is using to delay.
[2:12:05] Yes.
[2:12:07] But let me tell you, my the devil used
[2:12:10] my mother for some time
[2:12:13] and I spent about a few several months
[2:12:17] feared, bleeding
[2:12:20] because she said, "I've disowned you."
[2:12:23] If you're going to believe that happens
[2:12:24] to this. So the devil thought the way I
[2:12:28] love my mother, he will make me stop.
[2:12:33] He will cut me off from the message.
[2:12:36] He delayed me for a few months, but he
[2:12:39] could not stop me.
[2:12:42] Tell your neighbor, the devil may delay
[2:12:44] you for a while.
[2:12:47] He cannot stop you.
[2:12:51] Hallelujah.
[2:12:54] Oh, we need to shout about this church.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; We need to rejoice about it. Glory.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; So the seed cannot be stored.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; But you see, for the seed to mature,
[2:13:14] the seed needs a certain atmosphere
[2:13:19] to be able to mature.
[2:13:24] Amen. And there are three
[2:13:26] specific things
[2:13:29] that any seed
[2:13:31] need to be able to come to maturity.
[2:13:35] Number one,
[2:13:37] the seed needs good ground
[2:13:44] soil, fertile soil.
[2:13:46] Are you following me?
[2:13:49] The seed needs
[2:13:53] water,
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Without water, it cannot grow.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Even if it is seed,
[2:14:02] right? The seed needs sunlight.
[2:14:08] Without a sunlight, even if you make all
[2:14:11] the electricity light,
[2:14:13] it will not help the seed.
[2:14:16] It needs natural sunlight
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:22] and we will talk about each of these.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Not today. But for tonight, today I just
[2:14:28] want to you know just wrap up a little
[2:14:30] bit about ground
[2:14:33] and then I'll try to find a place where
[2:14:35] I can finish.
[2:14:37] Now in the um in the in the seal,
[2:14:42] brother Bham says something here.
[2:14:47] We have uh someone may say well we are
[2:14:50] having our youth for Christ
[2:14:55] we are making youth meetings
[2:14:58] every young person in a message
[2:15:02] must believe and go to the
[2:15:06] right
[2:15:07] you may say our church is having a
[2:15:10] meeting
[2:15:12] oh we are going to make Crusade.
[2:15:16] We want so many members.
[2:15:19] Nothing against that. That's all right.
[2:15:23] But that is only atmosphere.
[2:15:28] You are only creating the atmosphere.
[2:15:33] You don't know who for sure. You don't
[2:15:35] know how many for sure. But you are only
[2:15:38] creating
[2:15:40] atmosphere.
[2:15:41] That might be an old hen's feathers
[2:15:48] what you're doing.
[2:15:50] It may be an old hands feather.
[2:15:55] But if you will get the right atmosphere
[2:16:03] that's it. Oh my.
[2:16:05] [Applause]
[2:16:07] Yes sir. If you will get the right
[2:16:09] atmosphere there,
[2:16:12] it will hatch ego. If you are an eagle,
[2:16:17] [Music]
[2:16:19] if there is ego eggs there
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:26] and if you were for ordained of God to
[2:16:29] see it,
[2:16:32] you can't help from seeing
[2:16:36] you are coming forth for a resurrection.
[2:16:41] Oh my. That's why we have church
[2:16:44] services
[2:16:46] to create the right atmosphere for the
[2:16:49] sick.
[2:16:53] Hallelujah. This place is not for the
[2:16:56] saved. It's not for the perfect is not
[2:16:59] for the best in Uganda.
[2:17:02] But it is a place where it combines the
[2:17:05] good, the bad, the ugly.
[2:17:11] We there are many eggs here.
[2:17:13] But what are we trying to do at
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; with all the music? Why do we buy
[2:17:19] musical instruments?
[2:17:22] Someone may say, "Pastor, you're wasting
[2:17:23] money. You're wasting church money
[2:17:27] this money. We could have done this."
[2:17:30] Oh my friend, you know nothing about how
[2:17:33] God works.
[2:17:36] Having good music is not wasting money.
[2:17:44] Singing good songs is not a waste of
[2:17:46] time.
[2:17:48] Why don't we just come to church and
[2:17:50] just hear the someone we go? You just
[2:17:53] don't understand how it works.
[2:17:56] Why do we sing? Why why do we why why
[2:18:00] why do they tell you, "Oh, please bring
[2:18:03] your song and practice it before you
[2:18:04] sing.
[2:18:08] Because we are trying to create an
[2:18:10] atmosphere,
[2:18:14] the right atmosphere
[2:18:17] because there are many eggs going to
[2:18:18] come.
[2:18:21] Hallelujah.
[2:18:23] Some are eggs of bats.
[2:18:27] Some are eggs of hens.
[2:18:30] Are you following me, church?
[2:18:32] Some are eggs of pigeons.
[2:18:36] But I will tell you something.
[2:18:38] Some are eagle eggs.
[2:18:43] Hallelujah.
[2:18:44] Yes sir. Some eagle.
[2:18:48] Amen. And when eagle eggs come here
[2:18:52] and the atmosphere is right before even
[2:18:55] the word comes,
[2:18:57] you have already been stimulated
[2:19:00] by the revelation of the atmosphere.
[2:19:03] You already feel something good coming.
[2:19:06] You already feel something on the inside
[2:19:09] which comes out on the outside. And many
[2:19:12] times people begin shouting. People
[2:19:14] begin rejoicing. People begin falling
[2:19:17] what is happening. It is the atmosphere
[2:19:19] that causes it.
[2:19:22] And I will tell you something and many
[2:19:25] times in church services
[2:19:27] eggs hatch
[2:19:30] you don't know what eggs.
[2:19:33] Sometimes they are old eggs.
[2:19:36] Sometimes they are eggs of hens.
[2:19:40] You know they cry differently.
[2:19:43] When a is
[2:19:47] it will cry like that. Am I speaking
[2:19:50] mysteries?
[2:19:53] This is nature. It is reality.
[2:19:57] Amen. Have you ever seen this kind of
[2:20:00] old? How does how does all
[2:20:04] tell us
[2:20:12] and say on a good day she has fallen
[2:20:21] don't waste your time thinking
[2:20:25] leave that alone
[2:20:28] because even me I don't
[2:20:31] Some of you will keep opening your eyes.
[2:20:43] She's the one
[2:20:47] demons come out of the other one and
[2:20:48] enters you.
[2:20:52] Things are happening.
[2:20:54] When we are in the spirit, everybody be
[2:20:56] in the spirit. Close your eyes. Be in
[2:21:01] prayer because things are touching.
[2:21:05] That's why. Hallelujah. Women when
[2:21:07] things are happening, we always I take
[2:21:09] the microphone. I tell you things are
[2:21:12] happening
[2:21:13] happening. We don't know what exactly is
[2:21:16] happening.
[2:21:17] Sometimes sometimes there is things we
[2:21:20] don't understand.
[2:21:23] But I will tell you something. There
[2:21:26] must be eagles when the word is
[2:21:27] preached.
[2:21:30] And many times it is the word bride
[2:21:35] hatching coming into view.
[2:21:43] Hallelujah.
[2:21:44] [Applause]
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; So when you come, you are coming into a
[2:21:51] right atmosphere.
[2:21:53] The song leader sing the right kind of
[2:21:55] song.
[2:21:56] The musicians play. Don't just come here
[2:21:59] without praying.
[2:22:03] You are coming out of your whatever and
[2:22:05] you you come and touch away instrument
[2:22:09] team leader. You have to be very
[2:22:10] careful.
[2:22:13] You are the pastor of the music
[2:22:14] department.
[2:22:16] You are helping the pastor of the
[2:22:17] church.
[2:22:19] Ensure that people are in the right
[2:22:20] atmosphere.
[2:22:23] So they can bring people in right at
[2:22:24] home.
[2:22:26] Sometimes someone comes with all his
[2:22:29] data hands
[2:22:32] and then he touches the instrument. The
[2:22:34] whole service is real
[2:22:38] friends. Atmosphere is very important.
[2:22:43] If you were wondering
[2:22:45] why we don't do those kind of dances,
[2:22:50] you know, we can't even do them with
[2:22:51] this kind of large pullpit.
[2:22:56] Maybe if you had a small place
[2:22:59] and then we put it aside and then we
[2:23:02] call the brothers and sisters
[2:23:04] in their tight clothing, they begin
[2:23:07] throwing their legs up, turning here,
[2:23:09] turning there, turning here, turning
[2:23:10] there. What kind of dances are those?
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; They are worldly dances.
[2:23:17] The atmosphere they are creating
[2:23:21] is not the right atmosphere that would
[2:23:22] hatch eos.
[2:23:27] But it's the right atmosphere to hatch
[2:23:29] worldly people.
[2:23:34] That's right. It will hatch wrong
[2:23:37] things.
[2:23:39] That's why you see the way they dress,
[2:23:40] the way they behave, the way they think,
[2:23:43] the way they do things, the way they
[2:23:44] teach
[2:23:46] is all for entertainment.
[2:23:49] And we're not really really it's the
[2:23:51] systems. The people are good.
[2:23:55] But those systems are bound
[2:23:57] and they can't understand how this
[2:23:59] works. So we do this because we are
[2:24:01] creating the atmosphere.
[2:24:06] That is why we organize youth camps.
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; You know, you might you might wonder
[2:24:15] this these meetings take a lot of money
[2:24:20] in millions.
[2:24:22] Millions
[2:24:25] millions.
[2:24:28] What was collected last year?
[2:24:31] I already told some of you know it
[2:24:32] already. We had to spend 30 more million
[2:24:38] from what was collected by you and the
[2:24:40] people. 30 more million because no one
[2:24:44] brought it. We had to spend it. So what
[2:24:47] am I talking about? Is it for what?
[2:24:50] For a show. Matter of fact, I have never
[2:24:54] preached in any of the
[2:24:57] brings people all over the world.
[2:25:00] Not me.
[2:25:04] sometimes I think it's been about nine
[2:25:05] countries.
[2:25:07] Many young people.
[2:25:09] This is not to put our church on the
[2:25:11] map.
[2:25:13] [Music]
[2:25:15] This is not to to to give me a name.
[2:25:20] If I wanted a name, I'd have been
[2:25:22] calling them and then I preach to them
[2:25:25] so they can also know I'm a good
[2:25:27] preacher.
[2:25:30] This is not about that.
[2:25:33] It's not about my family.
[2:25:36] When God calls a man,
[2:25:39] he gives him every ministry
[2:25:42] that God has called, he gives them an
[2:25:45] assignment.
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:49] And that's the assignment God gave me.
[2:25:54] And trust me, every year I've wanted to
[2:25:57] say every after meeting I say I'm not
[2:25:59] going to do another one
[2:26:03] because there's no money for it
[2:26:06] right from the first one.
[2:26:09] People are rejoicing
[2:26:11] and me I'm in my room in my office there
[2:26:14] completely confused.
[2:26:16] Oh God this money. What are we going to
[2:26:18] do? And while you are there testimonies
[2:26:20] are coming. Test testimonies are coming.
[2:26:21] Testimonies are coming.
[2:26:23] So God we are coming next year again
[2:26:26] coming next year again. Why it is for
[2:26:29] the purpose
[2:26:31] of arching the eos.
[2:26:36] Hallelujah.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends. If we spend 100
[2:26:40] million
[2:26:42] on one youth meeting
[2:26:44] and the the right atmosphere is created
[2:26:50] then
[2:26:52] The seed of God is bath.
[2:26:56] Even if he's one,
[2:26:59] that's worth it.
[2:27:01] That is worth it.
[2:27:05] Friends, you need to understand that we
[2:27:08] do these things to create an atmosphere.
[2:27:12] Amen. And if you've noticed,
[2:27:15] I don't we don't hold these meetings
[2:27:17] anywhere
[2:27:20] anywhere.
[2:27:26] We don't do them anywhere.
[2:27:28] You go in a place where it looks like as
[2:27:31] if they put west on the walls
[2:27:37] and then you come and pray for the Holy
[2:27:40] Ghost to come in that atmosphere.
[2:27:45] I believe I'm a stronger believer
[2:27:49] in if I can't do something and I do it
[2:27:52] the best
[2:27:56] I should not even do it at all.
[2:28:00] And if you DVF church
[2:28:03] can get that spirit.
[2:28:06] Oh, we can do a lot together.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; We can do a lot.
[2:28:12] Where are we collecting money to go buy
[2:28:14] a church?
[2:28:17] Are we planning to enrich the pastor?
[2:28:20] For your information, if I wasn't in
[2:28:22] ministry, I would have done it better in
[2:28:24] my life
[2:28:27] financially. I'm talking financially.
[2:28:31] But I went ministry
[2:28:33] and I'm not doing and I'm not doing this
[2:28:36] for money
[2:28:38] or for selfish gain.
[2:28:42] or for something or the other.
[2:28:44] Why are we looking money for church
[2:28:46] land?
[2:28:48] And then you say I will not give. I
[2:28:50] think these people they are trying to
[2:28:51] play tricks on us.
[2:28:54] You can't understand what we are doing.
[2:28:58] We are get wanting to get a place
[2:29:01] where an atmosphere can be created
[2:29:06] where we can have our own building
[2:29:10] where mothers can have a place
[2:29:13] where they can go breastfeed.
[2:29:16] They come here they're breastfeeding and
[2:29:23] they should have a nursery.
[2:29:27] where you should have a cry room where
[2:29:29] mothers go with children
[2:29:32] where you can have Sunday school places.
[2:29:36] This is what we have in our mind.
[2:29:39] We want a better atmosphere.
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:44] Who told you only white people should
[2:29:45] have this?
[2:29:52] Africans are weakest.
[2:29:58] and your church member.
[2:30:01] I said,
[2:30:04] "Let them do it." And your church
[2:30:07] member,
[2:30:10] you need a revival.
[2:30:13] I'm I'm telling you, you need a revival.
[2:30:17] If I pray that they may be one
[2:30:21] even as we are. God wants unity in the
[2:30:24] body
[2:30:28] that your pastor came up. He said God
[2:30:31] has led me to do that. We should help
[2:30:34] brother Peter and we give him 10
[2:30:36] millions.
[2:30:41] Our sister here we helped some time
[2:30:42] back.
[2:30:44] Oh, we we help and we give brother Peter
[2:30:46] 10 million.
[2:30:48] Sorry, today I'm picking up on you
[2:30:50] because you're
[2:30:52] and then you say huh brother is even
[2:30:56] better off
[2:30:59] that should be me.
[2:31:02] So I will not even give
[2:31:07] where is the unity.
[2:31:10] Do you have confidence
[2:31:13] in the man of God that he has sent you?
[2:31:16] Do you believe God can speak to him for
[2:31:19] the body?
[2:31:22] If you believe that, then you would
[2:31:23] support everything that we have as a
[2:31:27] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[2:31:33] I know that is surely God.
[2:31:37] It's not having anything to do with a
[2:31:38] man.
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:42] That's why we organize the youth camp
[2:31:44] right atmosphere.
[2:31:47] That's why we listen to the message at
[2:31:48] home.
[2:31:50] That's why we pray. Praying God can't
[2:31:53] save you.
[2:31:56] Let me tell you it can't.
[2:31:59] But it helps you to create atmosphere
[2:32:01] around.
[2:32:04] That's why we sing.
[2:32:07] All these things cannot and will not
[2:32:09] change us
[2:32:13] if we are none sick.
[2:32:16] But it can only make you realize who you
[2:32:18] are.
[2:32:23] That's what happens. The right
[2:32:25] atmosphere has to be created.
[2:32:29] I would stay at home and I would stream.
[2:32:35] You cannot receive what you would have
[2:32:37] received if you come here.
[2:32:41] The atmosphere at home is different.
[2:32:44] But the atmosphere in the church is also
[2:32:47] different. You understand what I'm
[2:32:49] talking about? So atmosphere is very
[2:32:52] important.
[2:32:54] And part of it is the good ground,
[2:32:59] the soil that the seed is planted in.
[2:33:04] some people are bad ground.
[2:33:08] I want to find a place to stop now.
[2:33:11] See the the ground is a problem.
[2:33:16] You find that someone is a rock. Oh my
[2:33:18] god, I'm just going to keep myself now.
[2:33:21] You see, they receive the word with joy
[2:33:25] cuz there is no root. When temptation
[2:33:28] comes, you walk away from the word.
[2:33:32] You know some people are on the
[2:33:33] roadside.
[2:33:36] The devil comes and steals what you have
[2:33:38] heard immediately.
[2:33:41] Some people are funny.
[2:33:44] You know you are shocked.
[2:33:47] You receive the word. You hear the word
[2:33:48] you receive.
[2:33:50] You are a seed. But you know you you the
[2:33:54] the things come and choke that word.
[2:33:58] the cares of life,
[2:34:01] desire for riches,
[2:34:03] pleasures of life, then you end up with
[2:34:06] no fruit.
[2:34:11] But God is looking for good ground,
[2:34:15] a place that I can say you are honest.
[2:34:20] Hest means when you are wrong, accept
[2:34:22] you are wrong.
[2:34:26] Stop pretending.
[2:34:29] Accept you are wrong. Accept you need
[2:34:32] help. Accept you need prayer.
[2:34:36] Accept you need to to to be taught.
[2:34:41] If you're wrong, you're wrong.
[2:34:44] Then you see, be honest,
[2:34:46] you know, have a good heart,
[2:34:50] not a bad one, not a hard one like a
[2:34:53] rock,
[2:34:54] not a sty one.
[2:34:57] have a good heart,
[2:34:59] a teachable heart
[2:35:02] that can keep the word.
[2:35:05] And then that kind of heart
[2:35:10] when the seed of the word comes,
[2:35:13] it takes some time,
[2:35:16] friends. It doesn't happen immediately.
[2:35:19] But but the Bible says it will bring
[2:35:22] fruit
[2:35:26] with patience.
[2:35:29] Hallelujah.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; You keep coming.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; If you are the good ground
[2:35:36] where then the word comes.
[2:35:41] Oh God, I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I
[2:35:45] didn't need that. Change me. Oh God,
[2:35:50] but when you go back it doesn't appear
[2:35:51] you are changed.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, keep coming. You receive
[2:35:55] the word again
[2:35:58] until people will say
[2:36:04] you don't know something is happening.
[2:36:09] It is a good ground for the world.
[2:36:14] Amen. because they must bring fruit
[2:36:17] with patience.
[2:36:19] Patience means there is waiting to do.
[2:36:25] Some people they want to use the word as
[2:36:26] witchcraft.
[2:36:29] They want to come here. Get changed.
[2:36:34] That's the problem.
[2:36:38] Even the church is you are not patient.
[2:36:43] Keep coming.
[2:36:45] Every promise of God is true.
[2:36:49] Every word is true.
[2:36:51] Amen. Keep coming.
[2:36:55] Keep giving.
[2:36:56] Keep praying.
[2:36:58] Keep waiting.
[2:37:00] I believe for something bigger to come.
[2:37:06] [Applause]
[2:37:09] Amen. Amen. The seed can only grow in
[2:37:13] fatted ground.
[2:37:17] I have not preached about this thing of
[2:37:19] good ground very well.
[2:37:23] We will start on it on Wednesday.
[2:37:26] Amen.
[2:37:28] Let us stand on our feet.
[2:37:30] God bless you.
[2:37:32] May God help us
[2:37:34] to always create the right atmosphere
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:39] for the word.
[2:37:41] to perform
[2:37:43] every promise of God
[2:37:46] in our life.
[2:37:49] Amen.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Danius, where are you? Could you
[2:38:02] come and sing that song again? Lead me,
[2:38:04] Lord, and I'll follow.
[2:38:08] I just appreciate the song leaders. Many
[2:38:10] times they sing songs that are really in
[2:38:11] the line of what I'm talking about
[2:38:16] without even me telling them.
[2:38:19] It just shows that we are walk also
[2:38:21] waiting upon the voice.
[2:38:25] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; Could you please help me? Let us sing
[2:38:27] it. Some sisters with some microphones
[2:38:30] help us sing it.
[2:38:32] Hallelujah.
[2:38:35] Sing it with all your heart, brother. If
[2:38:36] you can give us words,
[2:38:39] [Music]
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; I
[2:38:47] will go.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:38:57] and I will
[2:39:02] lead me
[2:39:04] [Music]

[2:39:10] Lead me
[2:39:14] Lord.
[2:39:17] I
[2:39:19] will follow you.

[2:40:35] great is thy faithfulness,
[2:40:42] oh God, my father.
[2:40:49] There is no shadow
[2:40:54] of turning
[2:40:56] within.

[2:41:57] not
[2:41:59] thy compassion

[2:45:26] for it to be able to come to maturity,
[2:45:30] it's not in a date.
[2:45:32] Every promise of God
[2:45:35] needs patience.
[2:45:40] You wait on him.
[2:45:42] You keep working. You keep believing.

[3:07:40] I find that
[3:07:42] there is honey in the ro
[3:07:47] in the
[3:07:50] song.
[3:07:52] Oh, there's honey in the row.
[3:07:55] How many I ever sang that song? We used
[3:07:58] to sing it many years ago.
[3:08:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is honey in the rock, my
[3:08:05] brother.
[3:08:06] Well, there is. Tell your neighbor now.

[3:08:45] for you. Okay. Then we used to sing,
[3:08:48] have you tested that the Lord is
[3:08:52] gracious?
[3:08:54] Do you walk in the way that is new? I
[3:08:59] tell you, have you drunk from the living
[3:09:03] fountain? Oh, there is a ro for you.

[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:40] &gt;&gt; There is something about those old time.
[3:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we should sing them more
[3:09:46] often.
[3:09:48] Hallelujah.
[3:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I have news for the church.
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; The good
[3:09:56] and the bad,
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; but the bad
[3:10:02] depends on how you look at it.
[3:10:06] The good is going to be good for
[3:10:08] everybody.
[3:10:10] But the one
[3:10:13] like I have the bad is not non-existent.
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; So which ones do you want to to hear
[3:10:26] first?
[3:10:30] The bad,
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; the good.
[3:10:33] Everybody says, "I want good news,
[3:10:37] no bad news."
[3:10:39] Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:10:42] The good news is
[3:10:48] Oh yeah, you can stream this portion
[3:10:53] and there's a portion which we will not
[3:10:54] stream but
[3:10:57] I was being asked whether they should
[3:10:58] stream them.
[3:11:02] I know there are those on the internet
[3:11:05] that are members of the church
[3:11:07] that I know of. were not able to come.
[3:11:11] And there are also those that I know
[3:11:14] like sister Dina
[3:11:17] all the way in Boston.
[3:11:19] &gt;&gt; She used to attend a local church there.
[3:11:23] But the last I heard that she was not
[3:11:25] able to go to church.
[3:11:29] She streams every service
[3:11:32] and she's a very active giver.
[3:11:37] Uh um I think she gives uh where is the
[3:11:40] Martin Luther
[3:11:44] is that is that correct?
[3:11:47] So she's she's an active giver towards
[3:11:49] this project
[3:11:51] and others as well
[3:11:54] giving so they should hear.
[3:11:57] Amen. It's like a major update.
[3:12:05] I'm doing it intentionally to try and
[3:12:06] raise your expectation.
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tell your neighbor.
[3:12:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I have in my hand?
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; It is copies
[3:12:25] of two land titles
[3:12:30] where we are going to build our church.
[3:12:34] [Applause]
[3:12:43] Amen. Amen.
[3:12:45] &gt;&gt; So in summary,
[3:12:48] by faith,
[3:12:50] we already have our children.
[3:12:55] Amen. Amen.
[3:12:57] Amen. Amen. So if the devil thought it
[3:13:00] is not possible, He's too late.
[3:13:06] I don't know whether you can see him,
[3:13:07] but if you can see him, tell him,
[3:13:08] "Devil, you're too late."
[3:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:15] &gt;&gt; In my hand,
[3:13:17] I have um um an agreement here.
[3:13:22] on Tuesday. H on a Tuesday last week,
[3:13:28] I went with brother Martin
[3:13:33] to meet the owners of these two plots.
[3:13:40] Um you remember the there's a meeting we
[3:13:42] had the first meeting we had
[3:13:46] um and uh everybody was pushing for no
[3:13:49] let's have our land, let's have our
[3:13:53] even if it's in the village.
[3:13:56] Let's have our land. But there are some
[3:13:58] standards I cannot agree with.
[3:14:02] But uh we agreed that uh we should all
[3:14:05] have our land.
[3:14:08] We were looking for land in this area.
[3:14:13] By the time we started
[3:14:16] um uh two plots
[3:14:19] were 150 million. You remember
[3:14:23] those of you who were with us the other
[3:14:25] side,
[3:14:27] three years ago,
[3:14:29] two plots were 150.
[3:14:33] But now
[3:14:35] one plot in this area is 150 million
[3:14:40] or more depending on the location.
[3:14:44] So it it appear that it is not going to
[3:14:47] be possible.
[3:14:51] for us to be able to attain that goal
[3:14:57] if we just keep collecting funds
[3:15:01] when we have not booked a plot.
[3:15:06] But it is impossible to book a plot
[3:15:10] without a big the biggest chunk.
[3:15:16] If land is 200 million
[3:15:19] usually they want 170%.
[3:15:22] that would be more than 150
[3:15:25] or around 140 then
[3:15:28] so and we had not raised that much
[3:15:31] and that's why we were not able to book
[3:15:33] any plot
[3:15:37] but when we had that meeting here
[3:15:41] we expanded the uh we realized we cannot
[3:15:45] now buy around
[3:15:55] by the time we get
[3:15:58] so we decided
[3:16:00] that we we now expand
[3:16:03] [Music]
[3:16:04] our perimeters.
[3:16:07] So we informed you
[3:16:10] to go out and look
[3:16:14] and see if you find a good piece of
[3:16:16] land.
[3:16:18] You come back and let us
[3:16:20] where is sister Susan.
[3:16:23] Could you please stand up?
[3:16:26] Where's brother? Uh yeah, brother Brian.
[3:16:32] So brother Brian calls me
[3:16:35] shortly. I think following day after the
[3:16:37] meeting
[3:16:39] and he told me pastor there is a land in
[3:16:45] it is 200 he told me 250 60 million
[3:16:52] that's what they told him
[3:16:54] so um I say
[3:16:59] no that's too much that's what I told
[3:17:01] you because all the lands I've seen I
[3:17:04] mean I know the areas.
[3:17:08] I have a lot of experience
[3:17:10] with land in this area for four years.
[3:17:13] I've been driving everywhere
[3:17:17] with brokers. So, so he took me to that
[3:17:20] land
[3:17:22] and we found sister Susan there. So
[3:17:25] apparently sister Susan
[3:17:28] around there
[3:17:30] crossed that line
[3:17:32] and she knew that they are set in that
[3:17:34] line.
[3:17:37] So she told brother Brian Brian and
[3:17:39] brother Brian informed me for those of
[3:17:42] you who don't know
[3:17:44] sister Susan came to this message
[3:17:46] through brother Brian
[3:17:50] Brian uh and also her husband.
[3:17:54] So we baptized both of them. I think
[3:17:55] have we baptized his husband as well?
[3:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:18:00] So they are both believers. I think they
[3:18:02] are they believed in this church
[3:18:06] and uh so you can be seated. So so we
[3:18:09] went there
[3:18:11] saw the land as soon as I reached there.
[3:18:16] I was so excited
[3:18:20] because the land was good from
[3:18:25] just a stone throw away from the road.
[3:18:33] Um those of you who know uh Shell
[3:18:37] matter of fact after this I want those
[3:18:39] who can
[3:18:43] if possible everybody
[3:18:45] I want us to go there.
[3:18:48] We claim that land.
[3:18:51] We see it. We pray.
[3:18:55] So I I don't need to direct you because
[3:18:57] I will take you there.
[3:19:00] So I said, "Okay, the money is a lot,
[3:19:02] but we found a money." He gave us a
[3:19:03] contact.
[3:19:05] We met the owner.
[3:19:07] The first time he told me ah pastor that
[3:19:10] land it is 260 million
[3:19:14] as you can see is on the road
[3:19:17] you can put anything there. I told him
[3:19:20] but for us we don't want to put business
[3:19:23] we want to put a worship center
[3:19:26] we are Christian
[3:19:28] &gt;&gt; and also we don't have much
[3:19:31] so we are requesting
[3:19:33] you allow us to pay what we have
[3:19:37] he said how much do you have I said we
[3:19:39] want to pay we we have a budget I told
[3:19:41] him we have a budget of 180 million
[3:19:46] for all that land
[3:19:48] he laughed
[3:19:49] And he said, "Do you know L?"
[3:19:53] I said, "Yes, sure, I do. I'm not saying
[3:19:55] it's that's what it is worth,
[3:19:58] but I'm I'm saying that we want you to
[3:20:01] help us
[3:20:03] and reduce the amount for us."
[3:20:06] Well, he said, "No, I cannot give it to
[3:20:08] you at that much.
[3:20:11] The best I can do is 240."
[3:20:15] I said, "No, we don't have 240.
[3:20:19] Uh I I said he said you have how much? I
[3:20:24] said we have 180.
[3:20:26] And um um I I spoke by faith. I told him
[3:20:30] if you take 180,
[3:20:35] we will give you 150
[3:20:37] up front.
[3:20:41] And so he got excited.
[3:20:44] So I told him and then he said no. Since
[3:20:48] I can see you a buyer,
[3:20:51] let's um let me give you this land. He
[3:20:53] kept quiet for a while. He said, "Okay,
[3:20:56] you are a church. I'm also a Christian.
[3:20:58] This is what we are going to do. I'm
[3:21:01] going to give you that land at 225
[3:21:03] million."
[3:21:09] And uh you you pay you you told me your
[3:21:14] payment plan.
[3:21:16] I came back here and I told you about
[3:21:18] that. Many of you already know.
[3:21:21] So now the information you don't know is
[3:21:23] when we went back with brother Martin
[3:21:27] on on I think was it brother Martin
[3:21:29] Monday or Tuesday? I now forget.
[3:21:33] Uhhuh. We went back there.
[3:21:35] &gt;&gt; I think on Monday.
[3:21:37] So I told him
[3:21:39] um sir we we want to give you a small
[3:21:43] down payment on the loan
[3:21:48] and then we pay the rest
[3:21:51] in one year.
[3:21:53] He loved he said you can't buy land like
[3:21:55] you're buying tomatoes
[3:21:59] but he said pastor not to waste your
[3:22:00] time.
[3:22:02] Uh have you first of all agreed with the
[3:22:04] total sum
[3:22:07] I I told him no we have not
[3:22:11] we would like to pay at least 220.
[3:22:14] [Music]
[3:22:15] He said no the 5 million is for the
[3:22:17] brokers.
[3:22:18] I told him no we don't have brokers.
[3:22:22] So then I said our sister in the church
[3:22:25] the brother are the ones who directed us
[3:22:27] to this land.
[3:22:29] He said no but there's someone who gave
[3:22:32] you my contract.
[3:22:34] I said, "Well, you can call him." So, he
[3:22:37] called him. He said, "Yes, I'm the one
[3:22:39] who gets the contact. I'm a neighbor
[3:22:41] here. I need to be paid." And also,
[3:22:45] there is another woman who brought them.
[3:22:49] So, uh the man then says um well um
[3:22:53] these ones are saying they had no
[3:22:54] broker. It is a a member of their church
[3:22:57] who brought them.
[3:23:00] Long story short, the sister, they call
[3:23:04] her and she says, "I know me. I don't
[3:23:05] want money.
[3:23:08] It's our church. We are buying
[3:23:11] for me. I'm sorted. Let them sort."
[3:23:16] So he said, "Okay, fine. What whatever
[3:23:20] they want to give me." So I told I told
[3:23:22] the man, "You see, so this 5 million you
[3:23:25] are putting
[3:23:27] it." He told me how much are you willing
[3:23:30] to give him?
[3:23:32] I told him tell him 500
[3:23:35] instead of 5 million
[3:23:39] you know certain things you speak by
[3:23:41] faith. The man was they told him the
[3:23:44] pastor is saying 500,000.
[3:23:48] He said no at least 1 million or at
[3:23:52] least 700.
[3:23:55] and finally says, "Okay,
[3:23:58] it's all right." If the other lady is
[3:24:01] saying she doesn't want anything
[3:24:04] 500, okay, fine, no problem.
[3:24:08] And so the 225
[3:24:12] becomes 220 500,000.
[3:24:15] [Music]
[3:24:18] Um and um so
[3:24:23] um he says okay so how are you going to
[3:24:25] pay?
[3:24:27] I told him I told you already how you're
[3:24:29] going to pay.
[3:24:31] He said okay pastor do this.
[3:24:34] Give me 100 millions
[3:24:37] cash
[3:24:39] within one month from now
[3:24:43] and the rest.
[3:24:45] He said something which brother Martin
[3:24:47] and I were shocked.
[3:24:51] He said the rest you can pay in eight
[3:24:52] months.
[3:24:56] And um and uh he said but for me to wait
[3:25:00] for you
[3:25:03] to raise the 100 million
[3:25:06] within 30 days I need to remove this
[3:25:08] land from the market.
[3:25:13] You need to commit to me
[3:25:17] that you are going to buy this.
[3:25:20] And if you give me your commitment fee
[3:25:25] and you don't raise that money,
[3:25:29] you will forget your commitment
[3:25:36] and that commit payment fee is 10
[3:25:38] million.
[3:25:42] Then in the 8 months uh in the in the in
[3:25:45] the in one month
[3:25:49] you bring um uh 90 million
[3:25:56] to make a 100.
[3:25:58] I looked at brother Martin.
[3:26:00] He looked at me. We looked at him
[3:26:04] and we told him give us the payment
[3:26:06] details
[3:26:09] and we paid the 10 million share.
[3:26:14] Now those who don't have faith
[3:26:18] are already saying this is the bad news.
[3:26:23] We are going to lose 10 million.
[3:26:27] Can I have a report on how much we have
[3:26:30] brother? Can you can you bring me the
[3:26:31] report for
[3:26:36] Praise the Lord.
[3:26:39] Praise the Lord.
[3:26:42] Amen.
[3:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:48] &gt;&gt; I don't need the whole file. I need only
[3:26:50] the report for this.
[3:26:52] &gt;&gt; I know you have a lot of records, but I
[3:26:54] only want the record for today.
[3:26:58] &gt;&gt; Okay. M
[3:26:59] &gt;&gt; um
[3:27:02] so
[3:27:03] [Music]
[3:27:06] uh to as of today
[3:27:10] we have this money I'm going to read
[3:27:14] includes the 30 million shillings which
[3:27:16] we used on the youth meeting
[3:27:20] which we need to which I said I'm going
[3:27:22] to find
[3:27:25] which I do not which we don't have.
[3:27:29] But I believe by the end of the month
[3:27:33] myself and those of you who have who are
[3:27:35] going to receive the faith for this
[3:27:39] will raise that much
[3:27:42] and the remainder of it as well. So as
[3:27:44] of today we have 93 million
[3:27:49] 779,000
[3:27:51] [Music]
[3:27:53] which means we need to find how much
[3:27:58] 6,400,000
[3:28:03] 6,300,000.
[3:28:06] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. Yeah.
[3:28:10] &gt;&gt; We need to find 6.3
[3:28:14] between now and 7th August.
[3:28:20] If we don't,
[3:28:22] we are going to lose 10 million.
[3:28:29] Are you hearing me church?
[3:28:32] So you need to look for 6.3 million
[3:28:37] and then we take the 90 million
[3:28:40] and pay it on that land
[3:28:43] and then the rest we can now talk how we
[3:28:44] going to raise
[3:28:47] the rest will be 120 million 500,000
[3:28:52] which I'll need to look for 15 million
[3:28:55] per month.
[3:29:01] If you go to the bank, they can give you
[3:29:03] this money,
[3:29:05] but then you will pay it in five years
[3:29:09] and you will end up paying double.
[3:29:14] We can look for this money.
[3:29:17] We can work as a team.
[3:29:20] Those of you who have not been giving,
[3:29:23] this is your church.
[3:29:26] It's our church. You start giving
[3:29:30] even if it is small.
[3:29:32] Just be giving
[3:29:34] and we will raise this money.
[3:29:37] So I want to speak like Joshua and
[3:29:38] Khaled.
[3:29:40] We are more than able
[3:29:44] to take this land.
[3:29:47] Now if you are among the 10
[3:29:52] because I know these amounts are given
[3:29:55] by the minority
[3:29:58] in this church. Not the majority, the
[3:30:01] minority. So if you're among the 10
[3:30:05] who are saying it is impossible,
[3:30:08] my brother, my sister,
[3:30:11] me, I'm among the few, the Joshua and
[3:30:14] the who are saying even if the land has
[3:30:17] giants,
[3:30:19] we are more than able
[3:30:22] to take it.
[3:30:26] And I'm going to keep raising money. I'm
[3:30:29] going to ask my friends. I'm going to
[3:30:31] ask my brothers. I'm going to ask my
[3:30:33] sisters. And we're going to raise this
[3:30:34] money. How many are going to do that
[3:30:38] in your group where you are and we raise
[3:30:41] this money? So this is what we need to
[3:30:44] do.
[3:30:46] But I tell you friends,
[3:30:48] going forward,
[3:30:51] we are now looking for money.
[3:30:57] We are going to look for money and we
[3:30:59] know where we're going to invest it. But
[3:31:01] if you don't have faith,
[3:31:03] I'm asking you to do one thing.
[3:31:06] Make sure when we are going to the land
[3:31:09] now,
[3:31:11] you come with us. Because when you see
[3:31:15] faith will come.
[3:31:18] Have you had church?
[3:31:20] All right. So, how many are planning to
[3:31:22] go to the
[3:31:26] raise up your hand eyes?
[3:31:31] Okay. How many are not going going to
[3:31:33] go?
[3:31:36] Raise up your hand. Okay.
[3:31:40] Okay. I see the majority are going.
[3:31:43] for directions.
[3:31:45] Um uh if when you reach after the
[3:31:48] Protestant shrine
[3:31:53] and uh I I think I'd like you to uh put
[3:31:57] off the uh the streaming for now. My

[3:32:01] you. Pray for us. Join us.
