[22:26] [Music]
[22:34] um
[22:36] let us read matthew chapter nine
[22:38] matteo
[22:41] and we read verse 27 to verses
[22:45] um
[22:50] 29
[22:52] mata is
[22:58] i read in the name of the lord
[23:01] and when jesus departed dance two blind
[23:03] men followed him crying and saying thou
[23:05] son of david have mercy on us
[23:08] and when he was come into the house the
[23:11] blind man came to him and jesus said
[23:14] unto them believe ye that i am able to
[23:16] do this
[23:18] they said unto him yeah lord
[23:21] then touched
[23:22] he their eyes saying according to your
[23:24] faith be it unto you
[23:28] yes
[23:31] sir
[24:02] amen
[24:04] hallelujah
[24:06] hallelujah uh hebrews chapter 11
[24:14] verse 5 to 6. we read it also but we can
[24:17] go through the two verses again
[24:20] by faith enough was translated that he
[24:22] should not see death and was not found
[24:25] because god had translated him for
[24:27] before his translation he had this
[24:29] testimony that he pleased god
[24:31] but without faith it is impossible to
[24:33] please him for he that cometh to god
[24:35] must believe that he is and that he is a
[24:38] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[24:40] him
[24:44] in
[25:25] lord jesus we ask that you come and take
[25:26] over
[25:54] amen
[25:56] so as usual on wednesday i speak for one
[25:59] hour in gabriel
[26:03] and i intend to do that tonight
[26:07] hallelujah i mean how many we are
[26:09] blessed on sunday
[26:11] sunday amen i believe that every service
[26:13] is a blessing to us
[26:19] something is happening on the inside
[26:22] you always
[26:36] was encouraging me and i appreciate that
[26:40] he ran himself
[26:41] he said
[26:42] uh
[26:43] uh speak as many parts on this subject
[26:46] as the lord will lead you to see again
[26:49] [Music]
[27:04] so
[27:39] and all and i i i hope that somebody
[27:42] here is catching that vision
[27:47] there is actually a brother a fellow
[27:49] minister who was streaming the service
[27:51] from new zealand
[27:56] uh
[27:57] he was streaming us here yeah
[28:00] and so he sent me a testimony afterwards
[28:05] and he said that he was blessed by those
[28:07] comments
[28:11] he was inspired
[28:14] they themselves in their church they
[28:15] don't have a place yet
[28:19] i said he was inspired
[28:23] doesn't that encourage you
[28:26] you know sometimes we stream these
[28:27] services they go you do not know who
[28:29] will listen
[28:30] services
[28:34] has to be a word or two change that much
[28:37] more but you can impact someone
[28:39] competing on another continent
[28:57] uh
[28:58] uh we have already improved from last
[29:01] sunday we're twirling sunday he's sick
[29:03] at the sewage little ginseng commercial
[29:05] i've been looking for the latest one
[29:07] brother joel but i think i can't find
[29:09] him but then
[29:37] [Music]
[29:38] we can do this just trouble
[29:40] let you know and we will do it enough to
[29:42] get you cola and uh i believe before the
[29:45] end of this month
[29:48] we should have passed the 10
[29:49] our target is to hit and pass the 10
[29:52] million mark
[30:20] we are pressing on to gain the mass we
[30:23] believe our lord is coming
[30:25] for and we do we are doing all that we
[30:27] can to prepare ourselves to correct your
[30:29] nature to attack yourself together i
[30:32] believe he's calling many more in this
[30:33] area
[30:34] is
[31:05] then the same day at the evening being
[31:07] the first day of the week when the doors
[31:08] were shut where the disciples where the
[31:11] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[31:12] jews came jesus and stood in the midst
[31:15] and said unto them peace be unto you and
[31:17] when he had so said he showed unto them
[31:19] his hands and his side then where the
[31:21] disciples glad when they saw the lord
[31:24] then said jesus to them again peace be
[31:26] unto you as my father has sent me even
[31:29] so said are you and when he also said
[31:31] this he breathed on them and he said
[31:33] unto them receive you the holy ghost and
[31:35] whosoever since you remedy they are
[31:37] remitted unto them and whose so ever
[31:41] since ye retained they are retained
[31:44] our
[32:24] um
[32:40] the scriptures which we have read
[32:41] tonight if you want the question
[32:44] and then read a few quotes
[32:48] i believe that would be enough for
[32:49] tonight
[32:50] yet tomorrow so in matthew 9
[32:53] when jesus came and find um
[32:57] two blind men
[32:59] yes
[33:02] these men were blind
[33:05] maybe they were blind from the time they
[33:06] were children
[33:10] they were blind because of sickness
[33:13] we do not know but these men were blind
[33:17] as jesus departed yes
[33:19] they followed jesus
[33:21] and they were crying unto him nobody
[33:23] cannot son of david have mercy on us
[33:27] today and when he came to stood to them
[33:32] the bible says he
[33:33] when he was coming to the house
[33:48] [Music]
[33:51] there is a little effort
[33:55] that you have to put now according to
[33:57] him some people think it's all about god
[34:03] you see the prophet says he's more
[34:04] willing to give you the holocaust than
[34:06] you are willing
[34:12] but the question is why don't you have
[34:13] it naturally
[34:15] because there is a little effort on your
[34:17] pathway
[34:33] and then jesus said unto them yes
[34:36] believe ye
[34:38] that i am able to do this
[34:42] hallelujah all right i wanted us to
[34:45] realize tonight
[35:14] we have to
[35:15] [Music]
[35:18] there was a time when the children of
[35:20] israel were going to take the promised
[35:21] land while walker said that whenever i
[35:23] sharing go back into trouble
[35:24] and they had to believe
[35:29] they were able foreign march forward to
[35:30] the promised land
[35:35] because they believed for it
[35:37] is a difference so that we are going to
[35:38] attain it
[35:39] against the gift
[35:40] and they cross jordan
[35:56] have to believe for it
[36:00] believing does not end with confessing
[36:02] jesus as your personal savior
[36:07] believing only begins by hearing
[36:16] [Music]
[36:25] they crossed across jordan abandoned
[36:28] and when they they reached the other
[36:30] side
[36:31] the first city they were to take was
[36:33] called jericho
[36:37] how many remember the jericho story
[36:53] jericho must fall yet you know what but
[36:56] i'm going to tell you what you're going
[36:57] to do
[37:00] and you must do it i'm going to take a
[37:02] good chance
[37:04] he said you are going to go around
[37:06] jericho
[37:09] seven times
[37:10] sam
[37:11] there were specific instructions from
[37:14] the lord
[37:19] on how jericho was going to fall
[37:22] hallelujah i mean
[37:24] praise the name of the lord
[37:28] let you know
[37:30] again
[37:33] hallelujah
[37:40] are you following me so far
[37:47] amen
[38:31] now
[38:33] let's get back to jericho
[38:36] and so when the saints reached in
[38:37] jericho
[38:38] about to come here god told them never
[38:41] give up to go around
[38:43] now i wanted to imagine that in warfare
[38:47] like right now russia is attacking
[38:50] ukraine
[38:52] ukraine imagine if the president of
[38:55] russia put in stabilization
[39:02] the only thing you are going to do to
[39:03] take ukraine
[39:06] you have to go around it
[39:08] all day
[39:09] and then the last time you shout
[39:11] out
[39:19] but the way god fights his battles and
[39:21] the way men fight their battles
[39:23] [Music]
[39:54] so the people who went around jericho
[39:57] and
[39:59] they went around jericho
[40:01] and i believe when those people in
[40:03] jericho were seeing them
[40:07] started to laugh at them
[40:20] how strong this city is
[40:27] [Music]
[40:31] amen who are stronger than all those
[40:33] armies and the words of jericho you are
[40:35] your singer
[40:46] [Music]
[41:02] amen can you imagine coming from if the
[41:04] believers
[41:19] all the angels we are there
[41:21] will never yeah they are blessed before
[41:23] we are because none of the jews command
[41:26] already at the normal crisis actually
[41:28] went and literally
[41:30] pulled down the words of jesus
[41:48] in order for you to get the wisdom of
[41:50] god
[41:52] they become fools
[41:54] around jericho
[41:56] they went around jericho
[41:58] they went around
[42:00] it was
[42:14] but they believed it never had to kill
[42:16] them don't think they were going around
[42:17] the building
[42:20] now we are going to imagine going around
[42:21] for example a place like the whole of
[42:23] kampala there is no way
[42:27] going around it
[42:36] they must have spent days and days and
[42:38] days
[42:40] that's why no one touched them
[42:56] as
[43:22] why because something is suddenly
[43:24] happening amazing
[43:26] whatever chicken the man so and these
[43:28] people
[43:29] know as they moved the last round
[43:33] they did what god's word said back
[43:37] to god
[43:48] did you see the quote i sent you on the
[43:49] group today
[43:54] you know but the banham says
[43:58] right with what is in your hands
[44:03] if it is singing sing the gospel
[44:07] if you can't do nothing but we so we
[44:09] suggest as loud as you can for the glory
[44:11] of god
[44:17] hallelujah if you can't do no more than
[44:20] put your hands part them
[44:25] conquer with whatever you got in your
[44:27] hand
[44:30] collapse them in such a way that all the
[44:33] neighbors will love you
[45:12] [Applause]
[45:30] and maybe
[46:52] i want you to understand this evening
[47:19] but when as jesus was departing
[47:22] again
[48:07] [Applause]
[48:18] i don't know
[48:23] [Applause]
[48:26] and these people came to jesus
[48:29] christ
[48:47] side secular not by what they saw
[48:50] but they came to him by faith
[48:53] they believed they were where he was but
[48:56] kids are worried they believed they were
[48:58] aware he was antibiotic
[49:02] and then jesus said unto them yes
[49:05] look at look at this question
[49:08] believe me that i am able to do this
[49:27] and jesus knew that yes situation
[49:29] but these blind men never said that i
[49:31] was very much they had shouted because
[49:33] look it was jesus who went after the
[49:35] disciples and called them yes we are
[49:37] again a night but you get israel and
[49:39] they accept it never kills them but is
[49:42] the blind man never
[49:53] and then jesus came yesterday and when
[49:55] jesus arrived in the house
[49:56] they
[50:10] do
[50:27] so i want to ask you a question
[50:29] did this man believe i was saying
[50:33] did i believe
[50:35] that
[50:35] they believe money that kid is there but
[50:38] god jesus
[50:40] yes she wanted an assurance from me
[50:46] believe me that i am able to do this
[50:50] hallelujah that's why i told you
[51:02] [Music]
[51:07] okay i'm not only abiding in your heart
[51:11] some of us need to learn how to praise
[51:14] how to worship the lord
[51:19] our praise has to come on our lips
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:33] and that kind
[51:48] satisfied with their crying and shouting
[51:54] that is good
[51:56] they are crying and shouting brought to
[51:57] him
[52:00] that has its place
[52:16] you believe
[52:27] you expect to receive the holy ghost
[52:29] when you have never even asked the lord

[1:07:38] he must believe that he is and that he
[1:07:40] is he will reward the diligent seeker
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:47] and i'm still reading this text he says
[1:07:49] you cannot receive anything from god
[1:07:54] except by
[1:08:09] this is maybe what i see that many
[1:08:11] of some have not seen yet
[1:08:16] i believe this
[1:08:18] is available to us
[1:08:22] give me a reason even if it is one why
[1:08:24] god should that give it to us
[1:08:30] but i have many reasons in the word of
[1:08:32] god
[1:08:35] and which shows us it is
[1:08:48] you cannot receive anything from god
[1:08:50] except by
[1:08:57] and it is for god and it is for god is
[1:09:00] calling you and it is for god is calling
[1:09:03] you
[1:09:04] that way
[1:09:26] it says god wants you to receive but it
[1:09:28] is something you must ask for
[1:09:53] that's why many people don't do believe
[1:09:56] but they don't have the holy spirit
[1:10:07] luke 11 13 says if you then
[1:10:10] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:10:12] to your children how much more will your
[1:10:15] heavenly father give the holy spirit to
[1:10:17] those who ask
[1:10:18] him
[1:10:28] what
[1:11:10] nobody
[1:11:26] oh lord fill me with your spirit
[1:11:30] you know my knee what kind of atmosphere
[1:11:32] is that me that you can't see you
[1:11:35] but you see these men disciplined men

[1:12:20] ask what you want
[1:12:23] to see if i will not give it to you
[1:12:25] my way hallelujah amen
[1:12:27] and then hallelujah amen they say that
[1:12:31] we believe the lord
[1:12:47] is
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:15] of course the signs and everything
[1:13:30] these
[1:14:13] yes amen came to them
[1:14:15] and he blessed his hand nothing can
[1:14:17] recover again how long he took it
[1:14:20] what i know
[1:14:22] and then i when you thought his eyes
[1:14:24] open
[1:14:26] and while
[1:14:53] hallelujah
[1:15:02] and if you then
[1:15:04] say so it begins with a sincere prayer
[1:15:07] category
[1:15:20] god cannot feel
[1:15:23] god cannot
[1:15:25] nor will he feel a vessel still filled
[1:15:28] with sin katrina
