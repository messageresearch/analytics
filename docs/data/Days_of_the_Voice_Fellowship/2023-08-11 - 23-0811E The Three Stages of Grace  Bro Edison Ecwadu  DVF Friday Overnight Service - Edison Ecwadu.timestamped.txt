[37:49] chapter 2.
[37:51] verses 1 following
[37:57] I'm going to speak for just
[38:00] a few minutes and we see what the Lord
[38:01] has for us tonight
[38:04] Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1
[38:06] reads
[38:09] and he I knew has he quickened
[38:12] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[38:14] wearing in times past you walked
[38:17] according to the course of this world
[38:20] according to the prince of the power of
[38:22] the air the spirit that now walketh in
[38:25] the children of Disobedience among whom
[38:27] also we all had our conversations in
[38:30] time past in the last of our flesh
[38:32] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[38:35] of the mind and where by Nature the
[38:38] children of Wrath even us others
[38:40] but God who is rich in Mercy for his
[38:43] great love wherewith he loved us even
[38:46] when we're dead in sin hath quickened us
[38:48] together with Christ Jesus by Grace you
[38:53] are saved
[38:55] father we thank you we have radio wide
[38:57] and your art says that the letter kills
[38:59] but your spirit gives life father we
[39:02] pray come and interpret these scriptures
[39:03] we do not know we don't have
[39:05] understanding of the word but father you
[39:08] are your own interpreter we do not want
[39:11] to put our mind in your word but father
[39:12] you come down and interpret your word
[39:15] unto us that father we shall be edified
[39:18] we bless on him we thank you
[39:19] granted father in Jesus name we pray and
[39:22] believe
[39:24] amen you may be seated in the presence
[39:25] of the Lord
[39:27] I thank God for these uh
[39:30] wonderful a privilege that uh
[39:33] God has given me to stand before you
[39:35] tonight
[39:36] just to speak
[39:38] a few words that will
[39:40] a few words of encouragement
[39:42] I have not come with something new
[39:45] tonight praise the Lord
[39:47] I have come with that which you already
[39:49] know and just to add on a letter as the
[39:52] spirit of the Lord leads us blessed be
[39:55] the name of the Lord I want to begin
[39:57] with a testimony uh concerning my life
[40:02] uh the uh
[40:03] the biggest miracle
[40:05] that God can do to a man is the
[40:09] Salvation of his soul
[40:11] praise the Lord
[40:13] if not because of Christ
[40:16] I don't know how and where I would be
[40:18] tonight
[40:19] praise the Lord
[40:21] I believe each one of us
[40:23] has got that kind of testimony
[40:26] of how the Lord
[40:28] abandoned the 99
[40:31] and came looking for you one ship
[40:36] it is because of the grace of God
[40:39] and I thank God that tonight I can stand
[40:41] boldly in his presence
[40:44] not because I am a strong man but
[40:47] because Christ in me is strong
[40:51] Hallelujah
[40:52] I thank God that we are all standing and
[40:55] I'm also standing because Christ stood
[40:58] at Calvary and that's why I am standing
[41:00] the Bible says he became us that we may
[41:04] become him he took up the nature of sin
[41:06] that you may take up his righteousness
[41:09] Hallelujah Christ went to Calvary on
[41:12] your behalf and that is why there is now
[41:15] no more condemnation to those who are in
[41:18] Christ Jesus those who walk not after
[41:21] the will of the flesh Hallelujah I
[41:24] believe we are the children of the
[41:25] spirit led by the Spirit by the grace of
[41:28] God tonight I'm going to talk about
[41:29] Grace
[41:31] the three stages of Grace
[41:34] praise the Lord
[41:35] I'm going to talk about the three stages
[41:37] of Grace now Grace didn't just begin
[41:39] today
[41:41] Grace never begun when you got saved
[41:43] Hallelujah Grace did not start when you
[41:46] heard the word
[41:48] grace started way back even before the
[41:51] world was formed Hallelujah there are
[41:54] three things that God did one God had
[41:58] his four knowledge
[42:01] now sometimes I ask a question have you
[42:04] ever asked yourself that what was there
[42:06] before Genesis 1. have you ever thought
[42:09] that what has been there what was there
[42:13] before Genesis 1 before God said let
[42:16] there be light Let There Be have you
[42:19] ever bothered to think that what was
[42:22] there before
[42:23] God spoke Hallelujah
[42:26] now God had his thoughts easy for our
[42:30] knowledge and in the forward knowledge
[42:32] of God God saw everything all throughout
[42:37] the seven Church ages
[42:39] blessed be the name of the Lord and I
[42:41] want to tell you
[42:42] according to God's foreign knowledge he
[42:44] saw you
[42:46] and that is why you're here
[42:48] because God had seen you back there
[42:52] you never knew you were going to be here
[42:54] tonight but you are here because God had
[42:56] seen you back there in his foreign
[42:59] knowledge and therefore after God had
[43:01] his foreign knowledge he started
[43:03] ordaining things in accordance to his
[43:05] for our knowledge and that's why God
[43:07] ordained everything there is
[43:10] Hallelujah
[43:13] and according to God's poor knowledge
[43:16] your ordained Grace to be in the place
[43:19] blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:21] because God was not ignorant that there
[43:25] was going to be the fall of Man
[43:28] God in his foreign knowledge so time all
[43:31] throughout the ages until where we are
[43:34] now
[43:35] and everything has to work according to
[43:38] God's for our knowledge and God's
[43:39] ordination
[43:41] whatever you see taking place now
[43:43] wherever it takes place God saw it
[43:46] before
[43:47] and therefore God had a preparation God
[43:51] had prepared a plan for whatever we see
[43:54] going on now and therefore that's why
[43:57] God cannot fail
[44:00] because God has already prepared away
[44:03] before there was even one single problem
[44:07] God prepared a way of Escape God
[44:10] prepared healing before there was one
[44:12] disease on Earth
[44:14] God prepared Victory before there was
[44:17] one demon
[44:20] to try you
[44:22] Hallelujah
[44:23] in Gods for our knowledge God knew that
[44:27] you would not thrive in the law
[44:30] and that's why he brought Grace
[44:32] blessed be the name of the Lord you
[44:35] could not attain righteousness
[44:37] through the law
[44:39] so according to God's for our knowledge
[44:40] he had ordained Grace to be
[44:44] and at God's appointed time
[44:46] Grace came at our time Hallelujah
[44:49] because we could only overcome through
[44:52] Grace
[44:54] now I'm going to talk about the three
[44:56] stages of Grace one
[44:59] is justification
[45:01] blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:03] you love the Lord
[45:06] now justification
[45:08] is when God
[45:11] called you
[45:13] let's talk a little about
[45:15] the three things
[45:17] now
[45:19] God
[45:21] the Bible says somewhere that he
[45:24] ordained he chose us in him before the
[45:27] foundation of the world was laid
[45:29] God ordained you a son or daughter
[45:33] before anything was created
[45:37] that means god knew you before anything
[45:40] God had known you and therefore he had
[45:43] ordained you to be a son and the good
[45:46] news is
[45:47] there is nothing the devil can do about
[45:49] it
[45:50] blessed be the name of the Lord if God
[45:53] has ordained you if God ordained you a
[45:56] son or daughter then the devil has been
[45:58] shut out
[46:00] I'll tell you it doesn't matter what the
[46:04] Devil Makes You Do Hallelujah iricate
[46:07] change God's program God's plan about
[46:10] your life why because you are a son and
[46:13] a daughter of God
[46:16] I want to just bring a simple example
[46:18] if I am a father and I have a child at
[46:21] home
[46:22] another child is very rebellious
[46:24] that's the one to do what I tell him
[46:26] when I try to rebuke him too many does
[46:28] the same thing
[46:29] does that mean that that child is not my
[46:32] child
[46:36] Hallelujah
[46:38] now
[46:39] because the tempter is still here with
[46:41] us
[46:42] because we are still in flesh
[46:44] brother sister
[46:46] the devil is going to try to make you do
[46:48] things that are contrary to the word of
[46:49] God
[46:50] but God has had a way of Grace to bring
[46:53] you back
[46:55] to his what
[46:57] and therefore the devil is defeated why
[47:00] because Grace has prevailed
[47:03] blessed be the name of the Lord
[47:05] now
[47:07] the three stages of Grace not everyone
[47:10] can be able to go through them
[47:13] Hallelujah
[47:15] there are a special category of people
[47:17] who are ordained to complete the race
[47:21] there is a special category of people
[47:23] who are going to go through all the
[47:26] three stages but some will not go
[47:29] through all
[47:30] now remember uh
[47:33] uh in the book of Exodus when the
[47:36] children of Israel
[47:37] left Egypt
[47:43] that was their justification
[47:47] God was calling them out of the world of
[47:50] Egypt
[47:54] Hallelujah and it was a very big
[47:56] congregation
[47:58] very many people moved out of Egypt
[48:02] and they walked there when they saw the
[48:04] goodness of the Lord never again the
[48:07] pillar of fire leading them at night
[48:13] people saw the goodness of God and they
[48:15] moved all things
[48:21] and that's how the church is tonight
[48:25] many are called but few are chosen
[48:29] many people today come to Salvation
[48:32] so many come as a group by
[48:35] [Music]
[48:36] as well
[48:38] you seek Miracles the word of God being
[48:41] Vindicated
[48:45] and everyone is a Christian
[48:48] Hallelujah
[48:50] wait to the time of sanctification
[48:54] when they get to the Wilderness
[48:58] Hallelujah that is where the true seed
[49:01] of God is sin
[49:04] the Bible tells us not all of them cross
[49:07] the Wilderness
[49:09] because of their unbelief
[49:13] God made them to move
[49:16] rotate in the wilderness
[49:23] praise the Lord
[49:26] God had to sieve his own cartoon
[49:30] and I want to tell you out of the
[49:33] multitude of people who left Egypt
[49:37] [Music]
[49:40] is that amen
[49:43] that does not mean that it is not
[49:45] possible
[49:48] it means that there are people whoever
[49:51] who are going to make it I mean it's
[49:54] trials
[49:57] difficult times
[50:00] that the devil presents to you but I
[50:03] want to tell you tonight there is a
[50:06] people who are going to overcome Amina

[50:17] that means there is a special category
[50:19] of people who are going to inherit it is
[50:31] [Music]
[51:28] hallelujah amen there is nothing
[51:30] everybody can do about it there is

[59:17] then Christ came Christianity also a
[59:20] special thing
[59:22] that has been ignored Hallelujah
[59:39] that was your justification
[59:45] the Bible says God did not look at the
[59:48] Times
[59:49] that you were still living in sins
[59:55] every city
[59:59] not as close to that chapter
[1:00:02] blessed be the name of the Lord do not

[1:02:38] but remember I can give some guidance
[1:02:47] if you have the seed of God in you
[1:02:50] then you are receptive
[1:02:54] when the one of God is being spoken
[1:02:57] why because it is part of you
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:03] foreign
[1:03:18] uh that's why I had to burn out the old

[1:03:33] trespassing sins
[1:03:34] [Music]

[1:04:24] do you love the Lord
[1:04:26] [Music]
[1:04:28] now he says and you has he quickens
[1:04:32] that means there was a seed of God
[1:04:37] inside of you
[1:04:40] there was something Desiring
[1:04:44] there was a thirst
[1:04:46] that you didn't know how to fulfillment
[1:04:52] that first has been there all the way
[1:04:56] and you see people are trying to fulfill
[1:04:58] that fast
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:00] as a child of God you try to fulfill it
[1:05:04] when you are still in the world you are
[1:05:07] trying to quench The Thirst
[1:05:09] of God you are trying to quench it by

[1:05:23] you tried women it could not work you
[1:05:27] tried drinking it could not foreign

[1:05:45] and I want to tell you when you had the
[1:05:49] word
[1:05:50] you didn't ask questions
[1:06:08] why right part of the word
[1:06:11] the word of God
[1:06:14] part of the world
[1:06:18] which God had put inside of you
[1:06:21] made part of it
[1:06:25] and when the word spoke
[1:06:28] part of the word
[1:06:31] that word
[1:06:38] Hallelujah
[1:06:40] and therefore he didn't struggle to
[1:06:43] believe
[1:06:47] when you met the real world
[1:06:51] of God
[1:06:54] part of that city which was in here
[1:06:57] when you met it I want to tell you there
[1:07:01] was no compromise
[1:07:03] It just fits together
[1:07:06] why because it is something that God had
[1:07:09] in the beginning

[1:09:41] bread to be eaten they were following up
[1:09:44] to the deserts

[1:09:50] if you don't eat my flesh and drink my

[1:14:33] when you believed you believed with a
[1:14:37] carnal mind
