just going to uh be brief this morning and so please concentrate and don't lose anything god bless you brother peter i can see you over there and i hope your wife is near there you should always tell her to be ready for the service in time [Music] praise the lord amen amen now can we now go back to the scripture if any man love the world and the thing if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world your name every muncie did you hear that for all that is in the world command of your navy muncie what are these things that are in the world being no evidence remember we are not of the world you cannot have to live and see but if the world if somebody if you as a child of god are the son of god love the world for all that is in the world the love for all that is in the for all that is in the world it says the lust of the flesh is in the world every month begins to speak them the last of the flesh i would like to read this verse together with all of you verse 16 one two three go all of you for all that is in the world the last of the flesh and the last of their eyes and the oh my people are confused even those who are here can we read it again because i want i wanted to get to you two three go for all that is in the world the last of the flesh and the last of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world did you hear that for all that is in the world he has mentioned them one by one [Music] the last of the flesh and the last of the eyes and the pride of life he has said these three things is not of the father these three things is of the world these three things perish these three things are not permanent [Applause] these three things i've killed and he has spoken about them and he has said one of them is the last of the flesh of the eyes and the pride of life praise the name of the lord amen god is good now as we approach these three things i would like you to know that jesus overcame them all right everyone i would like you to know that there is nothing you fight in your life that jesus has not fought i would like you to know there is nothing that amen that you fight that that that jesus has not followed [Music] whatever it is that you are battling with your children whatever temptation [Applause] jesus has battled with it yes he was here on earth and he fought every bit of temptation that we go through hallelujah amen there is no temptation that you suffer that jesus has not suffered whatever temptation that you suffer jesus has suffered amen amen amen you mean to tell me that jesus even had all the temptation that we had oh yeah yes yes yes all these temptations that are in the world are summarized in first john chapter 2 verse 15 to 17. give it to us again praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah i mean he has said verse 16. now that are in the world and these are all the things that are in the world and i want to say that all the temptations you are going to get in life all of them are going to be summarized under these three things these three things are in the world naming them interviews and we are not of the world that's why in verse 15 it says do not love the world yes [Applause] [Applause] [Music] which are in the world [Applause] [Applause] the world and [Applause] have you loved these three things have you overcome them or not well obi-wan would you rather be one with anger and i'll read the quotes from the message jesus is tempted of the devil yeshua we hallelujah amen where jesus was tempted of the devil our yes we came about satan in in matthew 4. he overcame yahuwah the personal temptations of saturn god bless you brother and your and your friend there i don't know the the word is telling us a very very straight thing that jesus yeshua was tempted of the devil you came about satan and he overcame angular that's why we sing that song yes jesus overcame your word yes i'm [Applause] today [Applause] if you do not want to overcome you can never be a christian when we say a believer it means you believe also overcame somehow but she did not yield it now but she was a believer anyhow so we find every man and every woman that is born in this world [Applause] and when you face those personal temptations you must overcome them if you cannot overcome them then you are failed and to fight and overcome jesus was god in flesh [Applause] if god in flesh if god manifested in flesh could not overcome by his uh by his own strength strength you have to overcome by the word jesus overcame by the word [Applause] and by the are you following me in each of the three major trials that correspondent [Applause] exactly to the temptations of the garden of eden it says okay he says in each of these of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of heaven [Music] the last of the flesh the last of the eye and the pride of life jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of saturn [Applause] hallelujah praise the name of the lord he says eve fell to the personal temptation of saturn [Applause] by failing to use the word failing to use the word disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this this is the only way to be an overcomer [Applause] [Music] so so if eva failed to use the word she had the word but she tried to use the word [Applause] that very [Applause] of this generation told us to do scripture three to never misplace scripture come on now so when you when you dislocate the word when you misapply it how you misplace it so when you do those three things you have already failed before you start scripture but when jesus came yes they did not apply the scripture in the right way he must build up [Applause] [Applause] [Music] many denominations which have the same right that we have to you know read the same scriptures but they cannot apply those scriptures in the right occasions praise the name of the lord as much as i might be preaching but i'm really teaching something here by [Applause] is in evolution between a group winner and that group is like adam for them but they they refuse to obey never gone oh yeah i know that's what it is hallelujah amen did adam die adam here yes yes and what is this oppressive death means a total separation from god now we can sing jesus jesus overcame yeshua jesus overcame satan's power jesus overcame yes jesus you can overcome amen amen you too can overcome by the word [Applause] god has given us the word in this last days and we too can overcome hallelujah i want you to see this temptation of jesus then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward unhanged [Music] and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread but he answered written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god [Music] amen praise the name of the lord now i want us to examine the temptations of jesus in matthew chapter four but the bible says to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted [Music] he and the prophet said that we as believers when you fast you must be led into a fast [Music] you are in your heart you are yielding yourself on youtube you don't even become hungry because you are fasting after the burden has been lifted many times even believers when they get problems they don't fast when was the last time that you fasted was somebody else but you you may tell me one year within that one year you've never had a problem fasting and prayer when certain situations come to our life many times when the lord puts the fast on you just blush it off because you're so busy and you're so caught up with your day-to-day lives always yield when he puts a fast on us we must always yield to it to hear from him you must be willing to yield to him [Music] before [Applause] we don't usually mean the uh last sexual kind of immorality you know the last of the flesh is not merely the last of after the last of the flesh the last after the flesh like the flesh lasting for suck for for for you know for fornication for this and that but you know it it entails all the lust that has its seat me james chapter 1 james chapter 1 verse 13. we can begin from verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to them that love him come on now let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man now here on verse 12 he says blessed is the man that endures temptation if temptation comes to you and you endure it in other words you overcome it for when you are tried you will receive after you have tried and you overcome you've overcome the temptation then you will receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to them that love him and then verse 13 he says let no man say if you can't find the brother just continue let's just continue he says let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god. i am tempted of god [Applause] you see so now regardless of what temptation you are tempted with it's the source of it is the last that is within your flesh yes so example for instance someone may be it may be tempted to steal because he's hungry someone may be tempted to tell a lie oh [Music] [Applause] you know it brings forth it makes you to be enticed hallelujah let no man say the community okay so i don't know why the brother put it off i was just continuing with it now he says let no man say when it's time that i'm tempted of god for god to heal no we no man with evil neither attempted to hear any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own last and entice now verse 15 then when last has conceived [Music] [Applause] [Music] it no government is super awkward to yourself but i want it to happen oh i want that dress i'm going to go about that thing then you begin to last after it because of your name [Music] [Music] amen praise the name of the lord but and when the tempter came to him he said yeah if thou be the son of god this song's being made why did the devil come to jesus at that same time with the temptation of bread because at this time [Music] is uh [Music] to him with the pride of life at this time this time it was now the last of the flames i want you to see in the book of galatians [Applause] galatians chapter 5 [Music] verse 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the father paint yourself up where is it do this do that dress mini skirts don't you see you look better with them no my brother my sister [Applause] against the spirit [Music] so that you cannot do the things you wish that you would call it but if you be laid of the spirit you are not under the law now now the works of the flesh are manifest which are theirs you're not married to that girl look at that boy you told him all right then it continues on and cleanliness bubble cover that's for the occasion lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft oklahoma hatred or whatever variance in the time past that they wish do such things shall not inheritance [Applause] hallelujah amen now i have this uh in my in another version of the bible and i want to try and project it for you projecting so that you can be able to see to understand it better all right amen okay there we are he says welcome but i say now interpret this directly this is amplified version version it will amplified again okay he says uh but i say walk he walk habitually in the holy spirit again seek him and be responsive to his guidance and then you will certainly not carry out the desire of the sinful nature of it in [Applause] the desire will be there but you will not carry out him the sinful nature will be there but you will not carry out the desire of that sinfulness whatever you are the amplified version says here you will not be able to carry out that sinful nature the desire of sinfulness which responds impulsively without regard for god and his precepts immediate sinful desire it usually responds to you and it does not regard what god says and what the word says you may have the holy spirit you may be a [Music] [Applause] for the sinful nature has its desire which is opposed to the spirit and the desire of the spirit opposes the sinful nature these two desires within us [Applause] you live [Applause] it will both not leave you [Applause] which means the sinful nature and the spirit are in direct opposition to each other they are continually listen it says now the practices of the sinful nature what it is oh it could be anything like chewing you know this kind of stuff [Music] this is total responsibility lack of self-control you know you you are a holy ghost fueled child of god you think oh those are sorry sorry you know you might think you're a holy ghost out of god and something small like this takes you off anyway [Applause] makes almost naked on the road you are like oh

flesh hallelujah [Music] hallelujah it is written i will not give it to you now listen when the devil gives them fornication he is giving them the same the solution which almost is like the same solution that jesus would give them [Applause] why is it wrong now because it is the devil who has given it [Music] [Applause] because the devil has given it god will not give you a boyfriend or girlfriend that is from the devil god will give you a wife god will give you a husband not a girlfriend not a boyfriend [Applause] your best friend for life your best friend for life apart from jesus
