[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] far away a million miles or more it
[0:06] feels dirty
[0:07] [Music]
[0:15] and though I haven't lost my faith I
[0:20] must confess right now
[0:24] for me to pray
[0:31] but I don't know what to say
[0:35] and I don't know where to start
[0:39] but I still keep the grace
[0:44] with all that's in my heart I will see
[0:51] I will pray
[0:55] even in my darkest town
[1:05] [Music]
[1:14] when are you because your word is true
[1:19] I will see
[1:32] all the thoughts and plans
[1:36] [Music]
[1:51] me free
[1:54] foreign
[1:59] [Music]
[2:33] praise
[2:36] [Music]
[3:19] I will see
[3:22] [Music]
