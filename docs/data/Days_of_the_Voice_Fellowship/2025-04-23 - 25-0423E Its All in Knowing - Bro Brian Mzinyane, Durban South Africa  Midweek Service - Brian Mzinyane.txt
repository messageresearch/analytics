Uh first of all I want to appreciate those who prayed for us. We had a good uh trip to uh western Kenya Kenya and we had good meetings there with brother Keith and uh we appreciate you for your prayers and also those who have been praying uh for brother Amram. Um I have a testimony here from his dad. He says um God bless you pastor's left eye has successfully undergone cross-linking surgery and he came out well after 2 hours and 15 minutes. We give thanks to God for his mercies and thank you all for your sincere prayers. Amen. So he says they have not been admitted but they will go back for review on 6th May. He says God bless you for standing there. Amen. So today we have a it's a special service. because we have special people in our midst. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. Amen. Uh we have Pastor Charles and it's his first time to come and be with us here today. Amen. Pastor Charles, we really really appreciate you and you know for making the time to come and and be with us today. You know, I'll tell you um Pastor Charles is hosting Pastor Brian from South Africa. Pastor Brian and I are friends. uh going back to counting about 13 14 years ago when we first got in contact and among many of my friends uh he he really you know took the time to come to my wedding I don't know if dear do you remember him so he came to my wedding uh 13 12 years ago 2013. Um so because of that I want to invite my wife to come with my children. Let Pastor Brian see you before he preaches because he took time. He came all the way from South Africa to the wedding and then he returned. So it's a honor to have you. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Are they all? There must be more. Ah, okay. Others are sleeping. Okay. Amen. So you remember her, I'm sure. And I think you can say I've taken good care of her, right? Thank you. Thank you. So this is my first and then she comes comes next. Ah, okay. Okay. I'm introducing you to pastor. Unfortunately, the other one is sleeping. So Elizabeth, Elizabeth, then Sharon, Sharon, and Elhoo. And uh we have Timoththeus who is so these are the fruits of your coming to us. Amen. Time runs so fast. Time runs so fast. But we are so grateful can give us good friends. Amen. So when I saw that Pastor Charles is hosting uh Pastor Brian you know, we got in touch actually with brother Brian and I was like, why don't you also pass us by and I'm so grateful to pastor Charles who made that arrangement and make it happen and I'd like him to maybe come and uh just greet us before we go into the other session. Amen. Please join me to welcome us. The Lord bless you. I'm Charles the pastor of the little flock. [Applause] Charles Amen. Uh I came with a team in Mica. Those who came on their own, they will introduce them. But I see others who came on their own from the little flock church. But the the team that came with me in my car was incidentally I'm also here with my wife. She's here. And then my daughter Mary daughter there plus pastor Brian Brian. So little flock church just your hand. Thank you so much. What I want I can always say like this pastor is my bosom friend and I know him because he has a heart for missionary work. evangelism. That's the area really God united me and I appreciated the way the Lord's used him mighty work in Ethiopia. I've just passed Ethiopia as I was going to West Africa by plane. I didn't I don't know much Ethopia. I know but from the reports he gives and so forth the Lord has used him as a special to spread the message of the hour in Ethiopia. And uh just now he was telling me the Lord led him now to come back here establish because that's what Jesus said in Acts chapter one verse 8. Jesus said that you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you be my witnesses. Most people they don't read that scripture very well. They say he didn't say like that. He said boss in Jerusalem Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the uttermost part meaning that charity begins at home as they are preaching taking the gospel of Samaria [Music] wherever they must also be preaching it in Jerusalem. She must strengthen the foundation at home. You not able to reach other places. I appreciate that leadership the Lord you lay a foundation here at home that can enable you to reach out and uh I'm happy to be with you here and uh may the Lord bless you Jesus mighty name bless you thank you so much I've seen the blessings of the Lord through your family, but much more we want continue to collaborate because God has a missionary program. Amen. Uh these are men that uh have known me much earlier before I even got married. I remember the first time I met Pastor Charles was when with pastor the late we had some good fellowship. So I I we we thank God for the men that have stood for this message. Continue to spread it. You appreciate the message of the hour. Amen. God has many. He has planted them many blessings and um you know um there's something that pastor Charles said that we should continue to work together because you see one thing that I believe the brother and the sound really I want good sound so that the preacher will find it really good. Um so one thing that I believe that um when it comes to ministry there is no competition. Why? Because whoever God calls there is something special in him for someone special. And so we I can never be you, you can never be me. But each of us are a vessel in God's eyes. [Music] So we appreciate little flock church and pastor Charles for standing with this message. Amen. I want to invite my daughters to come and sing a song and and then as we invite the ministry. Amen. And there's a song they sung on Sunday and I was listening to it and uh it really blessed me. Yeah. God bless you all. We're going to sing the song that says, "Your grace and mercy." The chorus, your grace and [Music] mercy brought me through. I live in this small man because of you. [Music] I want to say you and praise you too. Your grace and mercy. [Music] and [Music] see me [Music] through this world. [Music] be close to [Applause] you. I want to [Music] thank you. Praise you. [Music] [Music] Can we sing it all together? Your [Music] bra Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Oh, thank you. Praise you. [Music] [Music] Praise. Oh, as we all stand at our feet, let us sing it together. [Music] Hallelujah. Your grace and mercy. Oh, how many believe that? Hallelujah. [Applause] Oh, all glory to praise. Your [Applause] grace, your [Music] Let us pray. A loving Jesus. Oh God, we think about your grace. Oh, that has brought us through. taken us out of the world, taken us out of the mar of the rock of the revealed word of the hour. Thankful Lord Jesus love where you have loved. We give you glory and holy father. the same grace wrote us a man from afar to come and share the good news to come and tell us what you have done for us. Come and announce to us the word of God for our Lord I know whoever that you be a part of this service physically and those online I know your word will will accomplish the purpose. May you grant it Lord. May you accomplish the purpose for which the word will be saved. We give you praise Lord in Jesus mighty name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let us sing that again as the minister comes. Grace and mercy run me through. [Music] [Music] for [Music] you. I [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Dear loving savior, we humbly come before your presence, Lord God Almighty. Your presence it means bring brings new hope. David says your loving kindness is better than life. Oh God, uh this tonight I [Music] pray you open your deep things into your word. Oh God, so we can be well equipped as your children, Lord. We are living in an hour of great deception, Lord. But our hope and rest is upon the scripture. The elect will never be deceived. Father, bring us to your word. We didn't even know how to pray. Before the message came, didn't know what a minister was. I didn't know what to be a father. Lord, we thought any woman who can able to give children is a mother. But we realize, oh God, that motherhood is a character. Father, you taught us so much. And we are still teaching us by the day. Lord, we are humbling ourselves tonight. We say let him go and let God have his own way mystery. Oh God, Lord Jesus Christ, bless him richly. Lord, bless his family and children, Lord. Special honor and privilege to see how you've blessed them, Lord. Ethopia my father pastor Charles here my lord believers who are gathered here that's the great work these soldiers are doing [Music] this if we are to spend our lives we desire to spend it in the house of doing the will of God no stone will be left upon another stone heaven and earth will pass way but your words will never bless us tonight those visible and invisible. We know your word knows no distance can reach out to anyone. I pray tonight that his courage must be encouraged. I pray that may be restored tonight. I pray the loss be found. I pray the sick may be healed tonight. I pray believer be anchored in the way tonight. Those who don't have the Holy Ghost, there's more than enough Holy Ghost. Father, whichever need there is, you supply according to the interpreter. Oh God, he does not know what to be said. Lord, it depends upon you, Lord. Not knowing the language, Lord, but it takes your grace. May I move one side, Lord. May the composer be the one going to speak to you. May the vessel of clay move once divine order. The one who knows every thought, every heart, the one who knows every life and of you take the subject tonight Lord and burn it upon our hearts to the tables. Holy Ghost break this word in Jesus Christ. We thank you. Amen and amen and amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Much has been said. Amen. I don't have uh soldiers and army like brother TMA has. I only got two warriors, Joshua and Caleb. They 11 months apart. They made it to the promised land. One is about 10 254. So they are just like that. They are 11 months apart. Very very wonderful children. God has blessed me with they are serving with me in the ministry. One is a prolific music player. Then he's on the guitar, then he's on the piano, then is this. He's very, very wonderful. The other one I think is a better preacher than me, which we thank the Lord for that. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, uh, may God bless you richly, one wife. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I thought you going to say, "Amen." It's important to say this is identify yourself. Not two, not three, not okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Bless your hearts. Let's pick up a scripture here by the grace of God. I'll come here in the book of James later. Let's go to uh Genesis 3. Usually we just follow the spirit of the leading of the spirit under pressure with time. We respect that. Pastor notified me of a bit of a time. All right. God bless your heart. Praise the Lord. All right. That's better. Genesis 3. [Music] My my my pick up Genesis 3 here. [Music] Perhaps uh yeah, let's pick up one. This says um um the verse 8. And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. [Music] And the Lord God called to Adam and said unto him, "Where are thou?" And he said, "I heard thy voice in the garden, and was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself." And said, he, "Who told thee that thou art naked? Has thou eaten from the tree whom I have commanded thee that thou shalt not eat? Verse 12. And the man said, the woman which thou gave me did with me and gave to me, and they did eat. And the Lord said unto a woman, what does thou has done? And the woman said, the serpent beguiled me and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou has done this thing, thou art care above all cattle, above every beast of the field, on thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat and the days of thy life. And I will put enemity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and the seed. He shall bruise thy head, and shall bruise his head. in India. India Right. Let's go back to earlier verse, verse four. Let's go to the earlier verse, verse four. And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die. And God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil. God bless those of us who may take the comfort. God help us. May God grant us grace. And then um this subject by the grace of God us take some more more time on it we will try and by the grace of God and go how far as the Lord leads something here is happening but as believers as Christians we must understand the battle is raging it has been raging before Jesus That battle is between right and wrong, between God and Satan, righteousness and evil. You cannot have, you know, when you look at both of the sides. And then adultery is right is is a right act perverted. Are we together? So we're realizing that the enemy all the time is fighting against the principles of God. He's fighting against the the plan of God. But the enemy is not fighting out there too far away. He always want to be near and near for something to deceive. He must have part of the truth. To deceive as a part of the light. If it's too bright, light only can't deceive. to die only can't deceive. There must be a certain quality of both in order to deceive. Blessed be the name of God. So brother, sister, we are going to read a very uh amazing scripture in the book of James chapter 2. Let's go there and then we'll come back here. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And then let's start there on James chapter 2. Yeah. Yes. Just pick up 17. Even so faith it is that not works is dead be being alone. Yeah. A man may say, "Thou has faith, and I have works." Show me thy faith without works, and I will show you faith by my works. Now listen very well. Verse 19. Thou believest that there is one God. Thou doeth well. But the devils also believe and tremble. So it's not only you know enough to say I believe. Here's a scripture here. It says even demons they believe. They don't only believe they tremble because in the revelation they have knowing the oneness of God makes them tremble. Please brother and sister when he spoke about faith he took faith to another level by saying this everyone on earth has faith atheist who doesn't believe God is there is faith believers got faith believers got faith believers got faith you someone who doesn't go to church someone who doesn't read the Bible doesn't pray. He tells his girlfriend in the morning 5:00 you cook porridge I'll come with Kentucky and then he goes that guy doesn't read the Bible that guy doesn't pray doesn't go to church many people along the day they die they believe it's not going to be one of the is going to be the He's saying with what by faith losing faith you 5:00 yesterday we prayed so and so yesterday so and so believe himself I believe I have enough money we're going to enjoy tonight I get He's declaring the results. Many accidents along the road many through the day speaking. So you can't be an end time believer and just have faith. How many people climb a bike here in one biker takes you here, another one, another takes you there. People don't stop and say I want to go to Kambala and say let me see your license stand on feet let me see there are two things they got faithfully they believe he's got lesson knows where he's going by faith So are you seeing I'm trying to show you that for it will be an end time believers have faith believer in the word the prophet even take the faith Faith is a revelation comes to the church ages. He says revelation is more than is more important than the food you eat. Gives you prevailing power. When you got revelation, something opens, you act better. You start knowing better. You stand better because now revelations open up. We stand our Bible for many years. Many of the baptizing fathers and holy ghost when the message came open up the revelation. Many people said I'm born again. I'm born again. I'm born again. When the message came with a revelation we can distinguish who's born again, who's not. We thought someone going to church for us speaking word to the neighbor to the messenger was open when the word was open the whole new book opening up things we never saw before knowing things we never knew before realiz what we must become Come on, somebody say praise the Lord. I want to introduce the subject. It's all in knowing. Somebody say praise the Lord. All in knowing. You start writing in Genesis when God says don't eat of the fruit of the spirit on the garden because the day you eat you shall surely die. I want to show you something both sides. It takes a knowing and the word knowing is a very deep word. I'm going to come to that for a while. Somebody say praise the Lord. Oh, may God help us to break these things down. We really need grace in this hour. What? We need grace in this hour. Not everyone says I'm a message believer as a message. Imagine we must even design at that level. We must design at that level. It's all in knowing. It's all in knowing. Let's define it according to the Bible the dictionary. Awareness. Awareness through thorough observation. I'm defining the word brother knowing is is thoroughly what you call this is awareness through observation. inquiry of information. Develop a relationship with someone through meeting or spending some time with them. I'm saying this word as we unfold is taking different level. You can know something by just observing. know by inquiry, by information. There's another knowing by relation. Just go on meeting spending some time with someone. Be familiar and acquainted with a friend, recognizing someone or something. It's part of knowing something or someone It's part of knowing recognizing it's part of knowing serving is part of knowing relationship building part of you seeing this word taking deeper and deeper level depending on the context you're using it. Okay. You haven't caught it yet. Let's go. Genesis 41. Let's go. Let's go. things of God are spiritually designed. I tell you, there's no greater wisdom than the wisdom of God. Let's read Genesis 4:1. Adam knew his wife. She conceived every day, ever since the day Adam was operated. He knew this is my wife. Are we together? You knew this is my wife. She come from me. She even named her. She says that you are born of my bones. I shall call you woman because you came out of a man out of a man. He knew. But Genesis 4 there's a deeper knowing. Someone say praise the Lord. What type of a knowing is this? After there is a conception. Are you see what is happening here? There's a deep knowing. There comes a time where to Isaac died. And then the Bible says this when introduced now they break out to Isaac and when you put the veil was no more. Then they got inside the tent and Isaac was comforted of the breath of the month. Now right there is no more public affair. beg you through preaching now personally. In other words, there's no more crowds. We sing, we sing a song with God in a secret place in the spirit. Beholding his face power in this race to be shut. In a holy place, in the holies of a holy place because of a man was light in the candles in the second field. No man's light was operating. A man [Music] outside the same manner take it. Cross the first veil in the holy place. Cross the second veil. Cross the second veil in the hol of holies in the port of gold. Paul speaks of dead. When you take the mana inside the pot, put it in dirt in the shana glory. 5 years later, it's still fresh. 10 years later, it's still fresh. No matter how long the prince of Blessed be the name of the Lord. Listen brother, sister, a certain revelation that Rebecca never had. The second revelation he never caught from many years is waiting for the tie when is with Isaac that revelation [Applause] started the message I can take you so far there must come a time when you have a personal relationship with your husband you must meet your God bless the God bless the message. God bless the people in the message ministry. But you must stop there. You must come to a place. You must know your husband deeper. It's all in knowing. It's all in knowing. Let's follow for a while. When the tent was shut, Then he knew Isaac. If Isaac had a certain spot on the right hand side, Rebecca started noticing on the right hand side. There's a market. Okay. Okay. Okay. There's a mark. All right. All right. Oh, there's a market. Okay. Is known because they shut in a secret place. He knows her. She knows him. They know each other from relation to revelation. Natural things always touch the [Music] spiritual might not have known that this Isaac is a sport know. And later on there comes a repair. She's expecting a pain and there's trouble right here. There's no alza to us inquiring of the Lord. The Lord gave a revelation. There's two nations. I want you to notice if you can only stop at the messenger. You are in for it. Because the another unfolding happening another unfolding. Listen very carefully. Let me show you scripture. When they asked John, who are you? Never said a son of Zachariah. Mother Elizabeth, the cousin to Mary. Who are you? I'm the voice of the one who appointed a scripture that speaks about him preparing the way for the Messiah. When John came, he did exactly that. Behold the lamb of God of the world. After that, the Bible says the following day, the disciples of John followed Jesus. John never had a problem. He knew that was his ministry. went to the presence of God. After that, put in jail. After that, when he was sold, ask, "Go and ask Jesus, is he the Messiah, or must you wait for another?" Jesus never said, "Let's go and visit Johnan there. John, you're not really John." She's never even there. Scripture says he went to Jesus knew he must be about his father's business. John is finished with his business. He appointed the Messiah. Now the Messiah the must walk the dead must rise. All he said go and tell Jonah the dead are raised. The eyes are open. That's the only testimony to know right away. He killed Jonah. John his ministry was over. Where am I going with this? Malachi 4. He came and restored the order. The order was lost at the ages. He restored. Righteous minister restored. Put back the altar. He put back home to where it's supposed to be. Put church support mothers and father support to our senses the way I took amnia reminded us where we were introduced the capstone to us when he left the scene when he left the sin it's not over the beginning of the Hallelujah. When John was gone, who was there? The Messiah. When Malachi is gone, who's with us? The mighty one came. The mighty one came. He is the one who's here. Let's not lose our focus. We have to know. That's why you're not prenites. We're not worship of a man. Thank God for the man. We've got a knowing. We've got a knowing we know who we are and we know whom we have believed. Second Timothy chapter 1. Let's go. Second chapter 1. Let's go 12. Oh my Lord. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I keep on saying time is my enemy. The devil don't even regard him as as an enemy. That guy is finished. You can't worry about someone who's in ICU is unconscious. Don't resurrect him in your life. Don't resurrect the devil. Is well dealt with. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. I was telling the Christians a few days ago when he says, "How do you feel? You're feeling dizzy, stomach, you got a lot of problems. How do you feel, brother? Hold the mic this side. Hold the mic. Hold the mic. Brother, I'm blessed. I'm blessed and anointed, brother. How are you?" Amen. You don't call the business. You don't call other things. The enemy's eyes must close like this. The devil's eyes must close like this. I thought I finished him. I thought I dealt with him. But he says anointed. He says what is this revelation? It's revelation. You are not this flesh. You are not this flesh. You are what you are in the soul. in knowing somebody say blessed be the name of you love the Lord Jesus Paul says I know whom I've believed I know who I You have to know. It must come to a place. You know who you are. Not what the prophet believe, not what the pastors believe. What you believe, you must come to your place. When you go to university, you go with the pastor, you go with the deacon, you go with your soul. That's why you must know. That's why you must know. When you go your job, you don't care the pastor. You don't go with the deacon. That's why you must know. When you're doing business, you don't care the church. You go with your soul. That's why you must know whom you have believed. When you are criticized, when you are criticized in that hour, you must know who you believe. On certain arguments, is not meant to argue with. The codes are not there to argue. The codes are there to be lived. Somebody say present. Let's go to brother Job. Brother Job says this. Even though the skin worms may eat of my body in my own flesh, I shall see him. Listen what brother Job says. I know my redeemer. What made Job overcome? What made Job overcome is knowing? Hallelujah. Children are no more and then the field is [Music] bad. And then the boil all around. His breath is straight against his wife. His friends turn against him. They say you're a secret sinner. Everything around you was discouraging. You know where the strength was. It was in revelation of knowing who he is. He saw the resurrection. He saw the coming out of the dead. He saw King coming down. He shouted, "I know my redeemer lives. I know." He was saying, "I've got a revelation. All the boys may eat of me, but the boy can't touch my soul. The boys can't touch the seed. The boy can touch the feet of God. I am eternal. The word is eternal. I know. It's all in knowing. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." It's all in knowing. Imagine if 2025 was alive. If brother Brennham 2025 he was alive his email [Music] inbox clogged people around the world skeleton faith any condition. God gave me a choice. Leave until you see the coming of the Lord or you go. He says, "I'm choosing to go. I'm afraid." Am I the only one to rapture so that we can grow in our faith? But we can know except personally. This is the paradox. When passed on, I came I became born. Hallelujah. So physically I don't know him. I heard the tapes. I read spoken words testimonies. But one day I had a privilege one time in a in so another place there and I found another grandmother. We went to testify in that home. And then we led that grandmother to Christ. And then she started saying wait a minute. We said William Brennham God sends a message. This is when I was young. I came here in close to I went to the meetings. I got healed. She got healed physically. Later on the seed son came and lead her to the Lord. The paradoxes that God a healing in the flesh. We thank God for it. But the best healing is the healing of the soul. [Music] Let me ask you a question. Did Lazarus die first? He died. Did he die again? As we speak now, he's waiting with Abraham. So any miracle in the flesh, there's no guarantee the condition cannot come again. Amen. But once saved, you are saved for time and pain. That is a quality you must never miss. That is a healing. You must never miss. You may miss the natural one, the spiritual one. Never miss that. Come to a place of say, I know I'm born again. I know I've got the Holy Ghost. I know I've got a theophony. I know I'm rapture bound. I know I'm dead in flesh. I know I'm the bride of Christ. The final voice is in me. It's all in knowing sons of some in 19.

In coming to demons they must know the real you. into demons. He must know the seed in you. He must know your position. He must know your revelation. He must know your anointing.

Love first. Before prophecy, love first. Before preaching, love first before anything manifestation first and our churches will progress faster. That's the formula from Malachi 4. That's the formula from the tapes. Stay with the tapes. Say what the tape says. Don't stop there. Do what the tape says. [Applause] It's all in knowing. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." I know. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Samuel chapter 3. I read the Bible says this. Samuel was in the temple sleeping. He's got his priest early.

Then Ellie realized oh God is calling the boy. Next time the voice comes to say speak my lord. The servant is listening. Then the third time where he says he's no more going to end a instruction from me. He says speak my lord. Then he started giving me the revelation. I like the next verse.

You come in the New Testament, blessed be the name of the Lord. Jesus. He knew who he was. No wonder they call him poop. He was not moved. They call him a Samaritan. You were a devil. We know your brothers and I come from a capital family. He says, "I I work as far as this. I do my father's work. I do nothing except my father's se. What I see is what I do. Are we together believers? There must come a time when the God you worship must be in you. [Music] Going to read the message. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord. There was a time the mercy seat was in the first tabernacle beyond the second veil. The priest must bring a bullock [Music] for his sins. Sins of Israel. There was a time a sinner must bring a lamb. The priest must inspect the lamb. He's not inspecting the worshipper. He's inspecting the lamb. The lamb must not have one eye. The lamb must not be crippled. The lamb must have no deformity. Why was this important? Even if the worshipper is limping, the priest is not looking at the limping. He's looking at the lamb. What must be blameless is the lamb. When he sprays the lamb, he washes the lamb. He cares the lamb. He offers the lamb. The worshipper must know the life that is living this. It was supposed to be my life. Is standing on my behalf. So the worshiper goes away not condemned because that animal died in somebody say praise the Lord. When and Herodot and Herod were confronted with the Lord Jesus Christ. What are you going to do with this Jesus called Christ? They had to decide individually. They want popularity. They want the people to to say they are wonderful or they stayed with the word before them. They chose to stay with the crowd. That's one. Secondly, and then there it is. Are you the Messiah? Are you the king of the Jews? Hey, this man is quite say anything. Christ was thinking about scripture as a lamb sent to a slaughter head. All he was concerned about is fulfill the word. He knew who he was. He did not need a Herod or he knows who he is. A dream came have nothing to do with that man of God. The law the wife. The wife. Yeah. And then the law according to the law blameless three perfection. The witnesses that he brought they were found to be false. So he warned against witnesses the law and blameless. There's another testimony of a dream from a woman supernatural. His own wife his own wife. God rich in mercy. He'll bring the truth to your doorstep. They had to decide before he can say situate yourself. He had to decide. Here are three avenues. They are all proving the lamb is guiltless. What must I do with this Jesus Christ? Must I give you the thief or give you Jesus? They say away with this man. give us the modern thinking today of Tik Tok likes jokes more than the things of tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock when are you going to know what you're supposed to know because what you're supposed to know is not in Tik Tok what you're supposed to know is in the tapes what you're supposed to know must be in the hearts Don't be derailed by these things.

Then he cried, I first thought. You know the things of God, the way they so deep and spiritual. Why? Why there was a sour vinegar? Why was sour vinegar? close. Why? Because the scripture says they gave him sour feeling. It was supposed to fulfill the word. Even unbelievers, they anointed in fulfilling the word.
