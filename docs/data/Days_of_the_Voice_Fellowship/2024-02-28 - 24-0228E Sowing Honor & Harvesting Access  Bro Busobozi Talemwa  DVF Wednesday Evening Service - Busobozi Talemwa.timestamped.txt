[48:54] on Sunday
[48:57] now I realized that um I thought I had
[49:00] spoken for 1 hour and a
[49:04] half but I noticed when I checked today
[49:07] that I had spoken for two hours and a
[49:12] half but I fig I figed nobody recognized
[49:15] actually realized that we went for that
[49:20] long enjoyed the
[49:24] service
[49:26] and uh speaking on the principles or the
[49:28] on the principle of
[49:33] so I I realize that uh there are many
[49:37] brothers I spoke to a friend a few
[49:39] friends of mine and about three or four
[49:42] in the past have spoken on the
[49:43] principles of
[49:48] [Music]
[49:50] success
[49:51] yes but I believe that the principle yes
[49:56] there are many principles but the
[49:57] principle is only one and that is
[50:04] so and uh I told you Yer on Sunday when
[50:07] I was speaking that we could actually
[50:09] take each of these things that you
[50:16] so and we take a service about
[50:20] them and I said if you pray God will
[50:22] move on my heart and I will speak little
[50:24] more details
[50:30] and so today I'm speaking on sewing hor
[50:33] and
[50:39] harvesting
[50:41] am access
[50:46] ACC yeah all right so we will now go to
[50:50] the
[50:51] word I see there are two new faces that
[50:55] I do not know very
[50:58] well you're
[51:00] welcome feel feel comfortable in the
[51:03] house of

[52:07] all just today to come and visit you and
[52:10] fellowship
[52:13] together
[52:18] amen you amen praise the
[52:22] Lord uh yeah I I remember when I was at
[52:25] the church
[52:28] inis no wonder he was remembering
[52:32] the yeah so the brother fellowships in
[52:34] our church in
[52:37] Ethiopia this is a a younger Church of
[52:41] the other
[52:44] one I was a pastor there
[52:46] for almost
[52:49] uh six six seven
[52:53] years includes before the church
[52:59] started because we were really there
[53:01] when the church had started for about 3
[53:03] or four years with my
[53:07] family and so this is just the second
[53:10] church and
[53:13] pastoring and so that's why I said this
[53:15] one is the one of the other
[53:19] one so in that way I might say that you
[53:22] at our
[53:24] headquarters
[53:28] anyways we know our headquarter is in
[53:31] heaven amen shall we just go to the word
[53:34] right
[53:36] away uh we are going
[53:38] to okay there is a lot I don't even know
[53:41] which scripture to read I don't have an
[53:42] opening
[53:45] scripture since we are standing let us
[53:47] just read John
[53:52] 3:16 and then we can get seated
[53:56] for God so loved the world that he gave
[53:58] his only begotten son that whosoever
[54:01] believeth in him should not perish but
[54:03] have everlasting
[54:19] life amen you may be
[54:22] seated so this evening by God his grace
[54:25] I would like you once again to give me
[54:27] your undivided
[54:32] attention uh our awareness day is not
[54:34] always very
[54:37] long uh so we hope we'll go through this
[54:43] quickly nonetheless I would like us to
[54:45] be
[54:47] relaxed just ask the Holy Spirit to
[54:50] speak to
[54:51] you so I'm speaking on sewing honor and
[54:54] harvesting axes
[55:02] now how many here have ever wanted to
[55:03] meet someone great or someone very
[55:09] successful and maybe you never got to
[55:11] meet them because maybe after they left
[55:14] the stage you did not have access to
[55:20] them or maybe you wanted to speak to
[55:22] someone who is
[55:24] famous
[55:26] people that we call Role Models because
[55:28] they are very
[55:30] famous but you have no immediate
[55:34] access so you may not have access to
[55:38] such a
[55:40] person you may not have access to
[55:43] political or business or sports
[55:49] stars but i' would like you to know that
[55:51] you have access to the the the the most
[55:54] successful F thing that there
[56:01] is access to the greatest that there
[56:05] is and that is God
[56:08] himself is the greatest that there
[56:11] is and you have
[56:14] access and the scripture we read in John
[56:16] 3:16 gives us that
[56:20] access the moment someone believes in
[56:23] him the moment you believe listen the
[56:26] moment you believe in
[56:28] Jesus you have
[56:33] access you have access to the
[56:37] blood Jesus said when he said it is
[56:41] finished it means immedi immediate
[56:44] access was
[56:48] granted because you see when man
[56:51] sinned in the Book of
[56:53] Genesis the Bible says that man would
[56:57] die the soul that sinth that Soul shall
[57:01] die but we find that you know when when
[57:05] Jesus brother bam says that
[57:08] death means total separation from
[57:13] God Access F
[57:16] deny even he put
[57:20] angels to keep the the
[57:23] way to keep the
[57:25] access to the tree of
[57:28] life and so we find that when Jesus died
[57:31] on the
[57:32] cross he said it is
[57:35] finished meaning the access immediate
[57:38] access has been
[57:42] granted the moment Jesus died whoever
[57:46] now believes in
[57:48] him he should not
[57:51] perish so now believing in him gives you
[57:55] full
[57:56] access direct access to the blood direct
[58:02] access everything that Adam
[58:05] lost whoever honors his
[58:09] word he or harvests immediate access to
[58:16] God because he said you know who is the
[58:19] word in the in in the Book of John
[58:22] chapter
[58:23] one says in the beginning was the
[58:26] word and the Word was with God and the
[58:30] Word was God and in verse
[58:33] 14 it says that the word put on
[58:36] flesh meaning God put on
[58:39] flesh Jesus was God Jesus was the word
[58:44] of
[58:45] God but he was
[58:47] God he was God in his
[58:51] fullness praise the name of the Lord and
[58:54] so we notice
[58:55] here that when he says I am the way the
[58:59] truth and the
[59:02] life there is no other
[59:06] access to the to the to the Tree of
[59:10] Life there is no other access to
[59:13] God there is no other door to
[59:16] the there is no other
[59:19] gate Jesus is the gate Jesus is the door
[59:23] Jesus is the
[59:25] Jesus is the
[59:27] access Jesus is the word of
[59:31] God when you believe the
[59:33] word you have immediate access to
[59:37] God we now no longer have to pray
[59:40] through
[59:41] someone the Roman Catholics tell you you
[59:44] have to pray through
[59:46] someone because God is Holy and you
[59:50] cannot access God
[59:52] directly and so that's why they have
[59:54] many SA
[59:56] those that are
[59:58] holy and can access
[1:00:01] God on their behalf you have people like
[1:00:04] Mary she's holy because she's a saint
[1:00:08] you have people like you know other
[1:00:10] people who
[1:00:11] died and maybe the popes and
[1:00:14] others and so for them they have no
[1:00:18] access but for you you have access you
[1:00:21] can go to God
[1:00:23] directly you don't need any
[1:00:27] intercessor the Bible says there is one
[1:00:29] God and one mediator between man and
[1:00:33] God man Christ
[1:00:35] Jesus is our
[1:00:38] access to
[1:00:40] God and so but uh starting that way
[1:00:44] today I want to speak on sowing
[1:00:49] H and
[1:00:53] harvesting you see if if you really want
[1:00:56] God if you want go to access
[1:00:59] God you have to reverence his
[1:01:02] word you have to believe his
[1:01:05] word you
[1:01:09] know you accept Jesus as your
[1:01:13] savior to draw close to draw him closer
[1:01:16] to you you know to to um how what's the
[1:01:21] right word in English to accept him yeah
[1:01:23] they said to accept him as your
[1:01:26] savior to come to him as your savior to
[1:01:30] believe him as your
[1:01:32] savior to receive him as your sa now
[1:01:35] when you do that you have access and
[1:01:39] Jesus is no longer a person physically
[1:01:43] here the blood is not in a bottle
[1:01:48] somewhere the blood is right here in the
[1:01:51] form of the
[1:01:53] word when you believe the word you have
[1:01:56] received the blood when you deny the
[1:01:59] word you have denied the blood and
[1:02:02] therefore you have no access to
[1:02:04] God but whoever believes the word of of
[1:02:07] the
[1:02:08] hour he has accepted amen the
[1:02:11] blood I want you to realize this
[1:02:14] church that God has been revealing
[1:02:18] himself Amen in in
[1:02:21] portions from the very beginning of the
[1:02:23] church ages
[1:02:26] are you listening from the beginning of
[1:02:28] the of the Ephesian Church
[1:02:31] age up to the last Church
[1:02:33] age God has been you know revealing a
[1:02:36] little bit of
[1:02:39] himself in the in the first church
[1:02:42] age where was God the only way to access
[1:02:48] God in the first church
[1:02:51] age was through the blood of course we
[1:02:54] see the blood the blood is
[1:02:56] enough blood cannot be shed
[1:02:58] again blood was shed once and for all
[1:03:03] are you following me so now the the
[1:03:05] blood where was the blood in the first
[1:03:07] church
[1:03:08] age it was the
[1:03:11] word the word that Paul
[1:03:13] preached what was it it was the bleeding
[1:03:18] word you know in the second Church H
[1:03:21] third fourth and now we in the last
[1:03:25] Church where is the
[1:03:27] word amen Christ is in the word
[1:03:30] again the bleeding word what we call the
[1:03:34] message of the
[1:03:36] hour in every day Christ reveals himself
[1:03:41] through the
[1:03:42] blood amen and the blood is in the
[1:03:45] word when you receive the reveal of your
[1:03:50] day you have accepted the blood of Jesus
[1:03:54] and you have received direct
[1:03:58] access so now when you saw
[1:04:01] H you have V
[1:04:05] access and that's the reason we are
[1:04:07] going to go in the
[1:04:09] Rapture but let me ask you a question do
[1:04:12] you know the perfect uh Vindication that
[1:04:15] someone has received the Holy
[1:04:21] Spirit anybody knows it
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:27] no one no believer knows
[1:04:30] it how do we know that you have the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost come on brother say
[1:04:37] it all that is okay
[1:04:44] but you see all the other things are all
[1:04:48] right you know the signs the Wonders you
[1:04:51] know the life and everything but our
[1:04:53] prophet told
[1:04:55] us that if you claim that you have the
[1:04:59] Holy
[1:05:00] Spirit and you reject the word of
[1:05:04] your it shows you don't even have the
[1:05:07] Holy
[1:05:09] GH Believers of Every
[1:05:12] Generation the Perfect
[1:05:15] Vindication that they had the Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost they received the word of
[1:05:23] their I'm not saying mentally
[1:05:26] receiving if you have received the word
[1:05:28] of your day if you have accepted the
[1:05:31] word of your you must live the life of
[1:05:35] it that's the proof that you have
[1:05:38] accepted the word of
[1:05:40] your in the days of Noah the proof that
[1:05:42] they received the word of their
[1:05:45] day they enter the ark so you see we we
[1:05:49] have received the word of our
[1:05:51] day and we are honoring the word and
[1:05:54] that's why Believers of this
[1:05:56] message amen we are
[1:05:59] assured that God is going to rupture out
[1:06:01] of the Believers of this
[1:06:03] message because we have received the
[1:06:05] word of
[1:06:07] our I am assured that I am saved because
[1:06:11] I've accepted the word of my I am
[1:06:14] assured that I'm going in Rapture
[1:06:17] because I'm a
[1:06:20] Believer now I want to go through a few
[1:06:23] things
[1:06:25] about
[1:06:26] honor and I want you to listen to me
[1:06:28] carefully
[1:06:30] tonight
[1:06:32] um first I want us to look at you know
[1:06:34] serving someone
[1:06:39] else when it's not
[1:06:42] required or
[1:06:44] convenient you know that serving
[1:06:48] someone when it is not required or
[1:06:50] convenient for
[1:06:51] [Music]

[1:06:55] it actually brings access to
[1:07:01] you it brings access to
[1:07:05] you are you following
[1:07:09] me I pray that the holy spirit will help
[1:07:12] us to be able to get
[1:07:15] into uh the things that he revealed to
[1:07:17] me for
[1:07:20] you let us first look at Genesis 24:14
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:29] quickly now because we have a lot to to
[1:07:31] cover and I don't want to
[1:07:35] belong and let it come to and let it
[1:07:38] come to pass that the dam to whom I
[1:07:40] shall say let down thy picture I pray
[1:07:43] thee that I may drink and she shall say
[1:07:46] drink and I will give thy Dam thy car
[1:07:48] was drink also let the same be she that
[1:07:52] thou Hast appointed for thy servant
[1:07:54] Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou
[1:07:56] Hast showed kindness unto my
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:20] master okay now listen listen now is
[1:08:24] honor honor is high
[1:08:28] respect great
[1:08:32] esteem you know showing credit to
[1:08:36] somebody and you know I've noticed that
[1:08:39] if there is something that is lacking
[1:08:41] among the younger generation in the
[1:08:42] message of the
[1:08:47] hour it is showing
[1:08:50] honor we do not know how to S not show
[1:08:54] but to S
[1:08:57] honor we do not s hon we don't even
[1:09:00] honor one
[1:09:02] another we don't honor the Servants of
[1:09:05] God we don't honor the men of God that
[1:09:07] God is using in a
[1:09:09] minut we don't our
[1:09:12] parents you know we disrespect and look
[1:09:14] down on one
[1:09:16] another everybody think that you know
[1:09:18] I'm higher than another
[1:09:21] one and that has actually made us not to
[1:09:24] be
[1:09:26] prosperous that has closed many doors on
[1:09:29] many of
[1:09:31] you many doors which were actually
[1:09:34] supposed to open in your life have been
[1:09:35] closed for so long because of inability
[1:09:39] to
[1:09:45] so and so today I want to teach you
[1:09:47] about sewing
[1:09:50] hor and then you will see how you can
[1:09:52] Harvest or reip
[1:09:56] access I I give you I will give you a
[1:09:58] few examples from the word and then
[1:10:01] we'll call it an
[1:10:04] evening and so we see first of all here
[1:10:08] when when um when when Abraham
[1:10:14] sends he tells swe says come touch my
[1:10:18] thigh he touches his
[1:10:21] thigh and so he says swear
[1:10:24] that you you will you will not take a
[1:10:26] son you will not take a wife for my
[1:10:29] son from among these
[1:10:32] canites swear that you will go in the
[1:10:35] land of my
[1:10:36] people among my own people and get a son
[1:10:40] for my and get a wife for my
[1:10:43] son and
[1:10:46] so you know did not know how to go about
[1:10:50] it but if there is one thing that
[1:10:56] had
[1:10:57] H for for Abraham and so he honed
[1:11:01] Abraham and he said I will do it as God
[1:11:06] leaveth and so when Ela left and and he
[1:11:09] went to where Abraham came
[1:11:13] from by the by the by the by the
[1:11:17] well he begins to pray a
[1:11:19] prayer you know why did God even answer
[1:11:22] that prayer
[1:11:24] because this man had honored his
[1:11:28] master when you honor people other
[1:11:31] people God will respect and honor your
[1:11:37] prayers there are even certain prayers
[1:11:39] God may never answer because you do not
[1:11:41] honor
[1:11:45] others and and so now he he prays a
[1:11:48] prayer and he says let it come to
[1:11:52] pass of whom I shall say let down thy
[1:11:55] picture I
[1:11:58] pray that I may
[1:12:00] drink and she shall
[1:12:02] say drink and I'll give th I will give
[1:12:06] thy camels drink
[1:12:10] also let the same be she that thou Hast
[1:12:13] appointed for thy servant
[1:12:19] Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou
[1:12:22] has showed kindness unto my
[1:12:26] now this was it looked like an
[1:12:28] impossible
[1:12:29] prayer but I want it to look at it two
[1:12:33] ways first you look at it on on the
[1:12:35] direction of uh of this
[1:12:41] man and then I also wanted to look at it
[1:12:43] from the direction of the
[1:12:45] woman here is a woman from a family and
[1:12:50] of course she was not
[1:12:51] married I do not know whether her
[1:12:53] parents were wealthy or
[1:12:55] not but you know she desired to be
[1:12:59] married and this may be good for you
[1:13:01] sisters who are not yet
[1:13:04] married you see she she was not
[1:13:07] married but you see someone was praying
[1:13:11] a
[1:13:12] prayer that was just for her but she did
[1:13:16] not know I I want to show you something
[1:13:19] there are things that God has prepared
[1:13:21] for
[1:13:22] you you don't know yet but the power to
[1:13:26] receive them is Right within
[1:13:29] you in just one
[1:13:34] word amen first of all says in the
[1:13:37] message
[1:13:39] influences be conscious of how little
[1:13:42] you
[1:13:44] are the Way Up Is
[1:13:48] Down he that humbles
[1:13:50] himself shall be exalted
[1:13:54] but he that exalts
[1:13:55] himself shall be a
[1:13:58] best so you don't see yourself how big
[1:14:01] you
[1:14:02] are but you know you should be conscious
[1:14:05] each time and every time of how little
[1:14:06] you
[1:14:09] are oh my follow me Clos you're going to
[1:14:11] learn something that will help you in
[1:14:14] your
[1:14:15] life last Sunday and today I'm preaching
[1:14:17] practical
[1:14:20] things so in Philippians 2
[1:14:24] three the scripture says let nothing be
[1:14:27] done through Strife of vain
[1:14:33] Glory but in liness of
[1:14:37] Mind Let
[1:14:40] each esteem other better
[1:14:46] thans praise the name of the Lord but do
[1:14:49] we really believe
[1:14:51] that many times everybody thinks that
[1:14:54] they better than the
[1:14:56] other we do not esteem each
[1:14:59] other as if the other is better than
[1:15:04] me what we have is
[1:15:06] competition you know pastors are
[1:15:09] competing the lady is
[1:15:11] competing musicians are
[1:15:14] competing you know you know mothers are
[1:15:16] competing husbands are competing wives
[1:15:19] are competing children are competing let
[1:15:22] me tell you we are not on a
[1:15:25] competition amen the place Christianity
[1:15:28] is not a
[1:15:29] competition Christianity is a place that
[1:15:32] you can find and be conscious of how
[1:15:34] little you
[1:15:38] are because the man we are
[1:15:41] following he was the god of Heaven he
[1:15:44] created heaven and Earth but he came
[1:15:47] down in Philippians chapter 2 he says he
[1:15:51] humed
[1:15:52] himself in a form of as a
[1:15:55] servant and because he was found in a
[1:15:58] fashion as a
[1:15:59] man heed
[1:16:01] himself amen even to the death of the
[1:16:04] Cross you know he he was God he HED
[1:16:09] himself he would have just said one word
[1:16:12] and everybody would be
[1:16:14] destroyed he kept himself together he
[1:16:18] said I will not do this I will not show
[1:16:20] my power I will not demonstrate my
[1:16:23] Authority because I want to Avest
[1:16:26] something I want to Avest access into
[1:16:30] the human rest I must humble myself I
[1:16:34] must be so
[1:16:35] small that I will confuse the
[1:16:38] devil if you humble yourself you confuse
[1:16:42] the
[1:16:44] devil that's why the devil came to Jesus
[1:16:47] and he said but tell me if you be the
[1:16:49] Son of God he was not sure he he looked
[1:16:54] as if he was but he was too humble so he
[1:16:58] was confused God cannot be too
[1:17:02] humble let me tell you if you're a great
[1:17:04] man you will be
[1:17:06] humble I can now predict your
[1:17:10] future if you are going to be
[1:17:12] great you are humble
[1:17:15] now or you will humble
[1:17:17] yourself people who are proud they never
[1:17:21] go so far
[1:17:23] Pride will never take you so
[1:17:25] far Pride will bring you
[1:17:28] down you have to come to a place where
[1:17:31] you realize I am
[1:17:33] nothing I am completely
[1:17:36] nothing Jesus himself said without him I
[1:17:39] can do
[1:17:40] nothing even me I am nothing without
[1:17:43] Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ all my plans my ambitions my
[1:17:47] thoughts it is
[1:17:52] nothing
[1:17:54] and that's why we have to esteem other
[1:17:57] each other better than
[1:18:01] ourselves this is a
[1:18:03] principle of reaping and harvesting
[1:18:09] access the seed of
[1:18:12] honor it opens immediate
[1:18:17] access to
[1:18:20] Greatness now let me tell you just so
[1:18:23] you be
[1:18:25] alert when you see the pastor preaching
[1:18:27] about trials and
[1:18:30] suffering you know God is preparing you
[1:18:32] to go through
[1:18:36] them but if you see God preaching to us
[1:18:39] about greatness and success
[1:18:43] and God is preparing you for
[1:18:46] it so I want it to be
[1:18:49] aler some will catch it others will miss
[1:18:51] it
[1:18:53] and I'm speaking to you in the name of
[1:18:55] Jesus Christ whoever will catch it will
[1:18:59] possess the things we're talking about
[1:19:01] here so the seed of
[1:19:03] Honor opens immediate access to
[1:19:10] Greatness
[1:19:11] immediately imagine what Rebecca had to
[1:19:15] do I was I was studying
[1:19:18] today and I took time to
[1:19:21] examine that was before
[1:19:25] Rebecca and we have a Rebecca today in
[1:19:28] in the
[1:19:30] church my wife is
[1:19:32] Rebecca and see
[1:19:34] Rea had to feed 10
[1:19:40] camels that was the task ahead of
[1:19:44] her she had to decide to do it you
[1:19:47] cannot honor
[1:19:49] anybody because they demanded for it
[1:19:53] it has to be your personal decision to
[1:19:55] give somebody
[1:19:58] honor the man only asked for
[1:20:01] water he said I'm going to ask for only
[1:20:04] water to
[1:20:05] drink but the woman that will honor
[1:20:09] me the woman that will just
[1:20:12] offer to feed my camels
[1:20:15] also without me
[1:20:18] asking she will be the woman she will be
[1:20:21] the woman be
[1:20:23] wife to Isaac and so I I was studying
[1:20:28] and kind of looked at the 10
[1:20:32] camels do you know how much a cam
[1:20:36] drinks I looked at it I was
[1:20:40] amazed
[1:20:48] 7 75 L of
[1:20:51] water now that means
[1:20:53] she had to fetch
[1:20:55] 750 L of
[1:21:00] water
[1:21:02] 750
[1:21:05] L that is the
[1:21:08] minimum because the Bible says that she
[1:21:10] she fed the camels until they were
[1:21:14] satisfied let's say that she fed she fed
[1:21:18] each 75
[1:21:21] L that is 7 50
[1:21:24] L and that means because you see at that
[1:21:27] time they had um they had Jans of about
[1:21:31] I don't know if they were Jans of about
[1:21:32] 18 16
[1:21:38] l so we are talking about 40 to 50
[1:21:43] times the woman going
[1:21:46] down to the well and coming back again
[1:21:50] going down and coming back again but I
[1:21:53] want you to see
[1:21:55] something every footstep she took to the
[1:21:58] well and back to the back it was
[1:22:03] humility it was humility it was honor
[1:22:07] she was honoring this man that she
[1:22:09] didn't even know she was humbling
[1:22:11] herself she was bothering herself she
[1:22:15] did not have to do this it was a b to
[1:22:19] her come it was inconvenience
[1:22:23] it was inconveniencing her she did it by
[1:22:27] Fai because she was moved in had to do
[1:22:31] it going and coming but let me announce
[1:22:34] this to you every Journey she
[1:22:38] took was a closer walk to her direct
[1:22:44] access it was a Clos walk to
[1:22:50] Greatness every water she fed
[1:22:53] she came closer to her
[1:22:56] greatness she had no
[1:22:58] idea that everything was cooking
[1:23:01] itself the more you humble yourself and
[1:23:05] the more you H
[1:23:06] others you are coming me closer to your
[1:23:11] greatness you are coming closer to for
[1:23:13] God to lift you and put you in your
[1:23:17] place praise the name of the Lord 50
[1:23:21] times going down the street down and up
[1:23:27] sweating this was not required
[1:23:31] of this was not convenient for
[1:23:34] her she did it out of
[1:23:38] horor and the Harvest was
[1:23:43] plent we do you know how long it
[1:23:50] took for her to enter into to her
[1:23:56] great God doesn't reveal
[1:23:59] everything imagine if she had seen a
[1:24:02] dream she would have done it with all
[1:24:04] strength seen a
[1:24:06] dream but God was
[1:24:09] quiet he just waited for her
[1:24:12] character to make a way for her her
[1:24:16] character to bring her
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:19] access amen and she honored this man
[1:24:23] and F this water and swe and got tired
[1:24:27] but while she was doing that even she
[1:24:30] was opening her own ACC to
[1:24:34] Greatness did she know that soon will be
[1:24:38] a wife of the greatest man in the
[1:24:42] land she would be a wife of a man who
[1:24:45] has a
[1:24:47] promise God
[1:24:49] himself Isaac a man who didn't
[1:24:53] all the promises of
[1:24:55] Abraham she would be a wife to a man
[1:24:59] whose
[1:25:00] lineage would bring forth Christ
[1:25:02] himself she did not know she was going
[1:25:05] to be a
[1:25:09] matri but what gave that
[1:25:15] access we must learn
[1:25:18] honor within
[1:25:21] ours all gifts that this man
[1:25:24] had became her and
[1:25:28] Father's everything he
[1:25:30] had became
[1:25:32] their in hours she was taken
[1:25:36] away to Isaac in
[1:25:40] hours but first she had to s a
[1:25:44] seed of
[1:25:47] H there are things you can look for in
[1:25:50] your
[1:25:51] life
[1:25:53] pray for them fast for them believe for
[1:25:57] them and they will never
[1:26:00] come until you saw the seed
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:07] of from
[1:26:09] around 2011
[1:26:15] 2012 I just decided to give this
[1:26:18] testimony because as I was studying it
[1:26:20] became real to me
[1:26:23] open
[1:26:25] up you know I got in touch with brother
[1:26:27] Eddie
[1:26:29] bis brother Edie bisc mentored
[1:26:33] me in in the
[1:26:36] ministry most of the things that I know
[1:26:38] in how to go about with Ministries
[1:26:40] because of
[1:26:42] him I listen to a lot of his
[1:26:46] sermons I texted with him a lot I talked
[1:26:49] with him a
[1:26:50] lot and so one day he writes me and he
[1:26:53] surprised
[1:26:55] me he said me two things told me two
[1:26:58] things he said I
[1:27:00] believe you will come and speak to our
[1:27:03] young people
[1:27:06] here and and and they have usually
[1:27:11] camps and so and then he said I'm
[1:27:14] sending you an invitation
[1:27:16] letter to come and visit us here in
[1:27:20] Canada now I was excited
[1:27:23] I was very young I think I don't
[1:27:24] remember how old I
[1:27:26] was I took that letter and the other
[1:27:30] documents and applied for a
[1:27:33] Visa I was denied a
[1:27:37] Visa now that's
[1:27:40] 2012 almost every one or two
[1:27:44] years I was given another letter for
[1:27:47] application of another
[1:27:51] VIs
[1:27:53] because he told me he
[1:27:55] believed that I would go and visit
[1:27:58] them and so I even gave up I kind of
[1:28:01] felt no I'm not going to keep applying
[1:28:03] for visas and I I have an expectation
[1:28:06] it's going to be given to me and it is
[1:28:08] rejected each
[1:28:10] time I said no I'm not going to do this
[1:28:12] again even when I was in Ethiopia in
[1:28:15] 2015 I applied again for a Visa it was
[1:28:19] rejected I'm tired of it I said I'm
[1:28:22] tired of
[1:28:24] you about 2 years

[1:33:21] of this because of that but all I
[1:33:25] know one thing did
[1:33:30] it I sold hor in a man of God
[1:33:36] life and God granted me
[1:33:39] access when you see doors close on
[1:33:42] you it is because you need to H
[1:33:48] somebody humble yourself don't lift
[1:33:51] yourself
[1:33:52] now I know that was a personal thing but
[1:33:55] I said it because I know it would help
[1:33:57] many of
[1:33:59] you many doors which are closed in your
[1:34:03] life some of you you don't even have
[1:34:10] jobs you even know someone else who
[1:34:12] wants a
[1:34:13] job you found a job but you can't even
[1:34:17] tell them about
[1:34:18] it because you feel like it is you who
[1:34:23] and you don't get it and you don't tell
[1:34:25] them about it and so both of you remain
[1:34:28] jobless God is waiting for you to honor
[1:34:31] someone
[1:34:32] else and then he will grant you
[1:34:36] access we must respect one
[1:34:39] another look at someone as if someone is
[1:34:42] greater than
[1:34:44] you some of you will take so long to get
[1:34:49] married because you think you looking
[1:34:51] for money
[1:34:52] because you think you you looking for
[1:34:54] this and
[1:34:54] that but you will not even get those
[1:34:57] things because you are not sewing the
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] seats God is waiting on you to S the
[1:35:04] right seats to Grant you the necessary
[1:35:08] access what you're looking for what
[1:35:11] you're praying for so you can continue
[1:35:14] praying do this for me God do this for
[1:35:17] me but he said there is a principle to
[1:35:20] it if you do not do the
[1:35:23] principle you will not get the
[1:35:29] Harvest I told one I told someone the
[1:35:31] other day if you want to eat me what do
[1:35:34] you
[1:35:35] do he said you buy it I told him that's
[1:35:38] a poor man's
[1:35:41] mentality if you want maze you s it and
[1:35:46] then you reap a great har and you will
[1:35:48] eat for many
[1:35:49] days a rich man
[1:35:52] will think that way think about having
[1:35:54] plenty not just buying for one time and
[1:35:58] then you have to go sweat get more money
[1:35:59] buy
[1:36:01] again let us s the right
[1:36:04] seeds and reap the right
[1:36:07] Harvest praise the name of the Lord I
[1:36:10] would like us to look at another
[1:36:13] aspect of sewing
[1:36:17] honor that is by presenting a
[1:36:19] significant gift
[1:36:24] of hor did you know that it gives you
[1:36:27] immediate
[1:36:32] access immediate
[1:36:36] access 10
[1:36:38] ver1 and when the queen of shba heard of
[1:36:41] the fame of
[1:36:43] Solomon concerning the name of the Lord
[1:36:47] she came to prove him with hard
[1:36:50] questions and she came to Jerusalem with
[1:36:52] a very great with a very great
[1:36:57] train with camels that bear spices and
[1:37:01] very much gold and spices and precious
[1:37:06] stones and when she was come to Solomon
[1:37:09] she communed with him of all that was in
[1:37:11] her
[1:37:12] [Music]
[1:37:14] heart we understand that Solomon was the
[1:37:16] wisest and the richest king on Earth at
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:20] time
[1:37:22] everyone would have desired to meet
[1:37:25] Solomon everyone would have desired to
[1:37:27] shake his
[1:37:29] hand be associated with him it was not
[1:37:33] easy for anyone including even if you a
[1:37:35] king or queen to meet and spend time
[1:37:38] with
[1:37:41] Solomon the man was not only
[1:37:43] rich but he was the wisest of all Kings
[1:37:48] and Men
[1:37:50] world
[1:37:52] L but one thing gave access to Queen of

[1:38:03] Gifts of
[1:38:07] honor to this
[1:38:10] King let us read verse 10 follow with me
[1:38:13] to verse

[1:38:20] gold and of spices very great
[1:38:24] store and precious
[1:38:26] stones there came no more such abundance
[1:38:29] of spices as these which the Queen of
[1:38:31] Sheba gave to the
[1:38:38] king the the Bible says 100 talents of
[1:38:43] gold now we're talking about substance

[1:38:50] us in the message we
[1:38:52] know that the woman went to King
[1:38:55] Solomon you think it is
[1:38:57] easy is it easy for you to go to the
[1:38:59] president of the
[1:39:01] country but yet someone can come from
[1:39:04] Kenya Orica and just go and walk to
[1:39:08] him there are things that give
[1:39:12] access you need to understand the
[1:39:15] princip it was the woman didn't just
[1:39:18] walk

[1:42:39] introduction and the parents were
[1:42:43] imp and the brother was welcomed like a
[1:42:46] king and he got 100% access
[1:42:52] in the same same way this woman was

[1:43:44] gifts so she also went away with bags
[1:43:47] and bags of
[1:43:49] gifts from King
[1:43:52] Solomon the Bible does not lie when it
[1:43:56] says give and he shall
[1:43:58] receive it is true and to say Amen
[1:44:03] to if you want to gain
[1:44:06] access sometimes to some
[1:44:09] people sometimes in in some
[1:44:11] situations you don't need to go
[1:44:15] empty-handed even when you come to God
[1:44:18] do you know that you should never come
[1:44:23] empty never because you want to get
[1:44:26] access to
[1:44:28] God someone said does it mean we are
[1:44:30] going to Bri
[1:44:32] god well if it is
[1:44:34] bribing everyone that has ever worshiped
[1:44:37] God hased
[1:44:40] him you come to God to worship Him you
[1:44:44] come with a sacrifice right from
[1:44:47] Genesis AB came with a sacrifice
[1:44:51] came with a sacrifice AB came with a
[1:44:54] sacrifice everybody came with a
[1:44:56] sacrifice when you come to a great man
[1:45:00] you have Amen to show him
[1:45:03] honor with your
[1:45:07] substance praise God first Kings
[1:45:13] 10:13 and King Solomon gave unto the
[1:45:15] Queen of Sheba all her
[1:45:19] desire
[1:45:23] whatsoever she
[1:45:24] asked beside that which Solomon gave her
[1:45:27] of his Royal
[1:45:32] Bounty she returned and went to her own
[1:45:34] country she and her
[1:45:39] servants praise the name of the Lord and
[1:45:43] was on Solomon and the queen of remember
[1:45:45] the wise
[1:45:49] men 210 it says when they when they saw
[1:45:53] the star they rejoiced with exceeding
[1:45:55] great
[1:45:57] joy and when they were coming to the
[1:46:00] house they saw the young child with Mary
[1:46:02] his mother and fell
[1:46:07] down and worshiped
[1:46:09] him meaning they honored
[1:46:12] him and when they had opened their
[1:46:16] Treasures when the first thing they the
[1:46:18] first thing they did
[1:46:21] is to honor
[1:46:24] him they worshiped him they didn't begin
[1:46:27] talking
[1:46:30] touching open their
[1:46:34] Treasures are you following me are you
[1:46:36] following me
[1:46:37] church that is why when we as a
[1:46:42] tradition in many
[1:46:44] Traditions when we first see a
[1:46:47] baby we give them money or something
[1:46:51] as a
[1:46:52] owner what I believe it it comes from
[1:46:54] the Bible the wise men were wise they
[1:46:58] honored him with a lot of
[1:47:02] treasures they came with expensive
[1:47:04] Treasures they began opening it
[1:47:08] spreading
[1:47:09] it gold
[1:47:13] frankincense praise the name of the Lord
[1:47:17] priests Kings Great Men
[1:47:21] all these they wanted to see the
[1:47:26] Messiah they were not granted
[1:47:29] access the King was not granted ACC the
[1:47:33] high priest was not granted
[1:47:34] ACC no one in the in the church was
[1:47:37] going
[1:47:38] to when the wise men went to the to the
[1:47:42] Palace the king said do you know where
[1:47:45] he is tell us where he is when you find
[1:47:49] him so that we to May worship him but
[1:47:53] you see the angel guided
[1:47:55] this because these ones hored amen Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ but the other the king wanted to
[1:48:03] kill
[1:48:04] him so other words if you want if you
[1:48:07] don't want to honor him you want to kill
[1:48:10] him but as far as I'm concerned I want
[1:48:12] to honor
[1:48:13] him I don't want to honor him with my
[1:48:16] mouth
[1:48:17] only I want to honor him with all my
[1:48:22] because I want to get great
[1:48:24] access when you hon him with all your
[1:48:27] substance you get great
[1:48:30] access amen into all these
[1:48:35] Treasures they were not granted
[1:48:38] access these wise
[1:48:41] men oh my tell me one
[1:48:43] reason why they were granted
[1:48:46] access they honored him we
[1:48:51] their are
[1:48:53] Treasures they honored
[1:48:56] Jesus with you know and they have
[1:49:00] vested immediate
[1:49:04] access no
[1:49:07] wonder Jesus talked to this
[1:49:09] man and he
[1:49:12] said he said how what can I do to get
[1:49:14] eternal
[1:49:16] life and Jesus
[1:49:19] answered go and do the
[1:49:21] Commandments he said I've done them
[1:49:23] since I
[1:49:24] was he says well then there's one more
[1:49:27] thing you
[1:49:28] need one more
[1:49:30] thing go to your
[1:49:34] Treasures that's the one more
[1:49:37] thing got your
[1:49:39] Treasures take them sell all of
[1:49:45] them and come follow me now I want you
[1:49:48] to follow me on this one
[1:49:51] closely so wise men when they
[1:49:54] came they the Bible says they gave all
[1:49:59] their they remained with nothing they
[1:50:02] gave all their
[1:50:04] treas Jesus told the Rich Young
[1:50:09] Ruler give all your
[1:50:12] Treasures to the poor come
[1:50:16] follow when you come to Jesus and you
[1:50:19] want great access
[1:50:21] to you need to sell all your
[1:50:26] treas whatever you feel is of
[1:50:29] value whatever you are holding on to you
[1:50:32] need to let it go and let him be the
[1:50:35] preeminent
[1:50:36] one in your life you know what that will
[1:50:39] do for you it will gain you great
[1:50:43] access to many
[1:50:46] riches that come from the word you know
[1:50:49] there are many riches that come from the
[1:50:52] world he wants us to
[1:50:54] prosper and not with the prosperity of
[1:50:57] the world but with the prosperity that
[1:51:00] he
[1:51:01] gives but many of us become so
[1:51:05] impoverished because we are holding on
[1:51:07] to the the prosperity of the
[1:51:09] world we are chasing after money we are
[1:51:13] chasing after knowledge we are testing
[1:51:15] after wisdom we are testing after women
[1:51:18] let me tell you that the word God say
[1:51:21] give it all up give it all up when you
[1:51:25] give it all up he's going to give you
[1:51:27] the true
[1:51:28] Treasures he's going to give you a true
[1:51:31] woman he's going to give you two Money
[1:51:34] Two The Blessing he gives he has no
[1:51:38] sorrow upon
[1:51:40] it let me tell you when God makes you
[1:51:43] rich in the are three things you are not
[1:51:47] sorrowful you are not running up and
[1:51:49] down
[1:51:50] you are not running away you are not
[1:51:53] Sleepless you are peaceful because your
[1:51:59] riches let me tell you that's what I
[1:52:01] want to
[1:52:03] have but the riches the world
[1:52:05] gives oh you will never lack you will
[1:52:09] never you know have
[1:52:10] peace because the devil gives with one
[1:52:14] hand and takes with
[1:52:17] another but when God gives you he gives

[1:52:53] 16 Ruth said entreat me not not to leave
[1:52:56] thee or return from following after

[1:53:22] death put part thee and
[1:53:27] me you know Ruth honed Naomi by her
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:34] submissive submission is not
[1:53:37] easy in the message cruelity of
[1:53:41] sin prophet of God says now if we are
[1:53:46] perfect in submission to the Holy Spirit
[1:53:55] if we were perfect in submission to the
[1:54:02] holy God would lead
[1:54:05] us by the Holy
[1:54:08] Spirit just like Adam LED animals of
[1:54:13] that and the messenger testimony says
[1:54:16] the acts of the holy spirit in the
[1:54:18] apostles
[1:54:22] for it was the Holy Spirit in the
[1:54:25] Apostle setting forth an example through
[1:54:28] all the
[1:54:31] ages what the Holy Spirit was
[1:54:34] then it is now and what the Holy Spirit
[1:54:38] did to that
[1:54:39] church it does to this church this
[1:54:43] church will be just as submissive to it
[1:54:45] as that church
[1:54:48] was
[1:54:50] it will bring it just the same
[1:54:53] results do you believe that it will just
[1:54:57] submit to
[1:55:00] Christ you must submit to Christ when
[1:55:03] you submit to him whatever the Holy
[1:55:06] Ghost did then he will do today not
[1:55:10] different now I want to show you here
[1:55:12] little did Ruth know that there was
[1:55:14] riches
[1:55:17] coming submission will make you a
[1:55:21] reputation with the powers that you have
[1:55:23] submitted
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] under your
[1:55:32] reputation or your character will always
[1:55:35] bring you
[1:55:38] recognition are you following me if you
[1:55:41] have that character of submitting
[1:55:44] yourself amen you will become
[1:55:48] reputable and you will be
[1:55:51] recog let me tell
[1:55:54] you this what I'm think I'm talking
[1:55:56] about today it does not apply in the
[1:55:59] church world
[1:56:01] only some of you have
[1:56:03] jobs it applies there as well it applies
[1:56:07] in the world it applies everywhere these
[1:56:09] are principles of the word of
[1:56:11] God and see people who are
[1:56:15] promoted you can see someone be in in at
[1:56:18] a place of work for 10
[1:56:22] and in the same
[1:56:24] position and another one joined two
[1:56:28] years
[1:56:30] promoted and then you begin they
[1:56:33] theying wa it's not always
[1:56:37] bribing you don't have to rely on that
[1:56:41] submission is
[1:56:43] key it brings
[1:56:46] promotion it will also draw Financial
[1:56:48] anointing upon your
[1:56:53] because of the hor you
[1:56:55] show and submit to
[1:56:57] them if I look at the life of
[1:57:00] Ruth I want to look at verse verse 11 of
[1:57:03] chapter 2
[1:57:05] Ruth all right answered and said unto
[1:57:09] her listen to these words it has fully
[1:57:14] been showed
[1:57:17] me all that thou Hast done unto thy
[1:57:23] mother-in-law since the death of of
[1:57:25] thine
[1:57:27] husband and how thou has left thy father
[1:57:30] and thy
[1:57:33] mother and the land of thy
[1:57:37] Nativity and come into a people which
[1:57:40] thou knowest not
[1:57:43] there the Lord recompense th
[1:57:47] work what recp
[1:57:56] is recompense is to make amends or to
[1:57:59] for loss or harmful
[1:58:03] comp yes to
[1:58:06] compet you know let me tell you when you
[1:58:09] submit yourself to Jesus Christ whatever
[1:58:13] you
[1:58:15] lost
[1:58:17] compens you cannot say I lost this I
[1:58:19] lost I lost this if you lost friends he
[1:58:23] recompenses if you lost money he
[1:58:26] recompenses if he lost you know position
[1:58:28] he compens promotion
[1:58:32] compens The Other Woman
[1:58:34] went and and and she thought that she
[1:58:36] would gain
[1:58:38] everything but we don't even ever hear
[1:58:40] of her but we see Ruth when Ruth lost
[1:58:46] everything amen Bo was not listen
[1:58:49] understand understand what I'm
[1:58:50] saying was not just
[1:58:54] anyone you know when let me tell you
[1:58:56] when when anyone speaks it's all
[1:58:59] right but when a great man
[1:59:02] speaks it means something
[1:59:05] big this was a rich man to begin
[1:59:09] with all right number one number two
[1:59:12] this was a man that was in the Lage
[1:59:17] of so he had the authority
[1:59:20] and the power to redeem
[1:59:23] everything and when he comes to this
[1:59:26] woman he says I've heard of your
[1:59:29] testimony I've heard how your husband
[1:59:31] died I've heard how you forsook your
[1:59:34] people how you've been kind and
[1:59:38] submitted to Naomi I have heard
[1:59:40] everything that you have
[1:59:43] done after he said that he said that now
[1:59:47] the Lord recompense thy Work
[1:59:50] that was not Idol
[1:59:52] talk that was
[1:59:55] prophetic because the man that was
[1:59:57] saying it he had the power to redeem her
[2:00:02] and everything she had lost he even had
[2:00:05] the money to recompense her for
[2:00:09] everything she had lost so he said the
[2:00:11] Lord recompensed
[2:00:14] her and a full
[2:00:16] reward be given thee
[2:00:19] of the Lord God of
[2:00:21] Israel under whose wings Thou come to

[2:00:44] lost may he give you a full reward for
[2:00:48] your work
[2:00:49] may you
[2:00:51] prosper his wings oh
[2:00:54] Hallelujah do we believe
[2:00:56] that now someone might have told
[2:01:00] Ruth those are just words but amen Ruth
[2:01:04] by Revelation she would tell them wait
[2:01:07] and
[2:01:08] see so tell somebody wait and
[2:01:11] see wait and see
[2:01:15] shortly shortly shortly the people
[2:01:19] thought were bigger than Ruth they were
[2:01:23] now Servants of
[2:01:25] Ruth the people that thought were living
[2:01:28] something little for
[2:01:30] rul they realized they are now serving
