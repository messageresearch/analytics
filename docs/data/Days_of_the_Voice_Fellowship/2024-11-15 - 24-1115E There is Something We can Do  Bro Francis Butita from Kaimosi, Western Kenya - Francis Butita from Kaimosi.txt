thank you Lord for the grace that you have given to us and an opportunity to once again be in your presence we appreciate you Lord for the man of God that you have brought from AAR just to come and be with us this uh this evening Lord uh those who have made it here here and those who are uh following this service online I pray that each one will uh will will receive a blessing from Heaven that it will be a special service it will be a spe a special moment in your presence father bless everyone who has come for it's a sacrifice to come but Lord we know it's a blessing to be in your presence Lord may you strengthen the man of God and use him Lord to power out whatever it is that you have designed before the foundation of the world that he would be able to say to us for we are here we are hungering and thirsting we are expectant and we know for sure you will come and speak to us father we commit all things into you we surrender all to you in Jesus mighty name amen amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated for just a moment we I would like to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ I wonder brother Samuel and this brother sister if you could come R this side amen how many are happy for the Vista that God has given to [Applause] us amen and uh yesterday yesterday we were in ginger for the graduation of brother Dixon and it was a wonderful moment amen and uh after that we went to which is one of the main reasons why I actually went is because I wanted to be uh to be able to speak to the family uh the father mother's house so there were aunties grandparents and many other family members we had 20 to 30 people there and I preached to them the word and uh it was a great opportunity some of them actually live here in Cala so uh we are trying to engage with them I'm sure they will start coming to our service so it was a wonderful opportunity Dixon desired that he asked me he said that I want to graduate but I see it as an opportunity for my people to hear the message uh so I just honored that because it was a good a good desire and I think if you also do the same if you have a wedding or a party graduation even if it's a birthday party if you decied to make one invite us to preach the message yes it's a good opportunity to preach the word those friends of yours who have never heard what you believe but the problem we shy away from those kind of things we should not shy away from it an opportunity amen so this this weekend we are blessed with Pastor Francis BTA an elder in the message from kosi Kenya amen um tomorrow we shall be doing an interview which is one of the main reasons really why I failed to invite him um but I was just asking him how old he is he's um on the seventh floor already he's headed to the eighth one so he's I don't know whether he would feel okay if I said he's an old [Music] man and so he and I are very great friends but we are Generations apart if you've noticed most of my close friends are old people and that's why many people think when I tell them my age they say no you're joking because I behave like an old man you know when you stay around wisdom you also get that wisdom amen and so uh Pastor batita is one of the very first generation here in East Africa that received this enti message and did not only receive it and believe it but they also uh went out to preach it and evangelized it um and as you will hear on the interview also in Uganda he came in those early years Western Kenya and the rest of the part of and uh there's many other things we can say so I've been blessed to be a part of the meetings he has been making there in Kenya ever since I was actually in Ethiopia uh one of ours there a deacon in Ethiopia brother Timothy he's from the church of Pastor Francis and so he is the one who connected us and I came to love Pastor V what he stands for the way he believes this message testimony in the past and in the present and um so I feel that his ministry this weekend is going to impact Our Generation uh Pastor I think about 90% of the members of this church both here and elsewhere wherever they're following are younger people so we believe that your ministry this weekend is going to impact the Young Generation and so it's U recently uh I think around April March he had um a huge Health Challenge he actually told me that he thought he had gone twice uh but certainly God has added him more time I believe for such a time as this and um for him to travel all the way from Western Kenya come and be with us here it's a great honor and not that he's coming to speak to thousands of people but even if it is for one soul I believe the purpose of God shall be accomplished and I want to sincerely appreciate you Pastor for and accepting our invitation you know in your um at your age your business schedule both at work and also in the ministry you've come I would like to say thank you so much thank you so much so this evening we are just going to have uh him preach to us and then on Satur day that is tomorrow at 300 p.m. we we we shall host the interview on the bench as usual here and um so if you can come and be a part of it that's okay and even those following online if you a young minister I'm sure that that session will be a blessing so please come and be a part of it and then on Sunday we shall have the last service with him so it's a a powerp weekend amen uh he was uh coming by car he was having a driver driving him down and when they reached the Border uh they noticed that the car they forgot to clear it through customs through immigration last time bringing it back again I was thinking to myself if it was me at his age even at my age I feel it's difficult to go to travel by bus I was thinking if it was me at his age I just called and said I'm sorry I cannot come but he decided to come by bus from the border want to say we appreciate that sacrifice and so uh be ATT attentive just listen to what God will have to speak to you tonight amen let us stand and we sing A Chorus Amazing Grace uh Pastor BTA comes amazing gra how sweet that sound that save AR like me I once was lost by now I'm oh World [Music] blind was gra [Music] the I are to I my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] PR I [Music] amen be seated I [Music] me uh I'm not a very good speaker and I don't have a voice of a Preacher uh so I request you to listen carefully sometimes I swallow my I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus as you have heard Francis Franc come from the western part of we have a church have

have wanted to hear him all the time you wonderful Pastor not many young people who get the message get the the light bearing of the message there's one thing to be a preacher but it's another thing to get the right you can be a preacher you can be a preacher say you have a good should thank God and for him what we are ling in this message not preachers but are very you know p is likeor by the way brother says the Good Samaritan they found this man was of the he carried him you [Music] the pastor is the inable when you are wounded is the one who look at your wounds when you are one who know the pain you are going through sometimes and I believe there are people that should there people people you should up you your church to blessed hold up the hands of your pastor like they the hands of Moses and I want to tell you you have a good pastor I have him I have Ted him know praise the name of the Lord I want to say I'm very very happy to be on this I've seen this puet many times sometimes I'm in this service so this place I'm acquainted preachers also need to them and you know the pastor is the only person who doesn't have a so we find other P who [Music] can so when my heart needs a I go around looking sometimes I he so I'm very grateful very thankful do you love the Lord praise the Lord I have not brought anything by the way I'm not a preach of because I know the Mysteries were finished but I preach the Revelation praise Lord know the re is very simple you don't have toch your when is and that's what I speak to our a way the Lord bless us this evening as you heard we left home very in the morning I I was thinking to be here by midday so I left my few I was theorder before I thought just go through quickly but unfortunately we were I was was around in April when we went back the personing the clearing for us he didn't do it we come the car stayed here since April now more so I what we do the bus was there so I told the brother and so I'm happy I was in the bus wondering God what do you have I don't know what you want I know we as Christians we don't control there is one who control the situations he says go right so I have beening the vehle you have Reas why you have done this and I know your will are praise the name of the Lord amen midweek services are just like this we are toow is where two or are praise the Lord now let's stand up and turn to the book of second Samuel 23 and I want to read a few verses there be the names of the Mighty Man whom David had they touched no night they sat in the seat Chief among the captains the same was adino the eonite he LIF up his spear against 800 who slew at one time and after him was elazar the son of Doo the a aite one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of isra Israel were gone away he rose and smot the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave Under The Sword and the Lord wrought great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spot and after him was the son of AGI the har harite and the Philistine were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew to the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory for for [Music] [Music] pray dear heavenly father we very grateful to stand in your presence this evening Lord we surrender ourselves to you you knew this day before the foundation of the world you saw it just as it is [Music] father may you come down and glorify your name bless Every Soul the holy GH over surely Lord with our choices maybe not be here but we know you have made it we know this is your plan know that is your will oh God come down and bless your word you speak to every and Lord Jesus Christ end ofice Inus name amen seated I've been thinking what to call what I'm going to pre this evening but I want to give this thought we can do something there is something we can do um thinking about this great man of David David when when he was uh in his battles he had about7 who decided we stand and they were not rich men of them were some of them were poor some of them were unable to pay Lo that's what the Bible says some of them were not pay their [Music] loans and they said what shall we do and they joined the B of David and when they join the of I want you to see the type of men thatav these are men who their lives and I believe the Bible says in the book of Acts God separate me men who have taken their lives and they have not saved it they have took taken their life and put in danger for the sake of the gospel and this men of David there are men who took their lives their homes aband their Farms maybe their buses and said we are going to stand praise the name of the Lord and they went to stand with where they would get the [Music] next Now look for they going to and when they know there's nothing toefit ra keep away but can you imagine this made know there nothing we they going to standav for the principle that this is becom a king they know he coming to be a king ask why you foll because he the king God they know the king you may say but the soul is there is there but this men have a re they know where the anointing is they know where the spirit of God is leading and they decided we follow him and we see the Bible gives us three of them it gives us one amen amen this man oh verse says he lifted up his spear against 800 [Music] when they came threatening he didn't give up when they came armed to attack because of David Because of Who David is to them he could not see the ground he could not be moved when Christian are threatened and they move when they are threatened and they they see ground Satan does not come you know in Beats [Music] IM and he was a real Soldier he could not give up sometime the Devil comes he comes with this temptation when you are not through comes and the spirit of the true man of [Music] God they don't surrender never give up praise the name of the Lord the second one he was called now when the Philistines came you know the Philistines represents of the devil in the physical it was the phes but you are not fighting Flesh and Blood you are fighting Spirits you are fighting demon right your Philistines are the demons the phes are the demons you see today and when they come they don't come single praise the name of the Lord so when they came and Israel was scared and away this man he said I'll do something I can't give up and took his sword in his hand and he fought left and right left and right until his hand stuck to the sword need men and women who can get out of the sword and never give up from morning to evening night time when it is raining when it is sh they can fight glory to God he y The Sword and I want to tell you you have the sword word and in this age we are given the SW listen when brother was given the sword he didn't go with the sword the sword remain sword is with us and we can get all of it it can give us the victory Hallelujah he fought left and right I believe he said everybody else has run away but I can't I have to do something I can't follow them if they are scared I'm going to stand if they scared of sickness I going to stand and fight for my glory to God they scared because the devil is so much and fight you know when he comes you hear the word you hear the word he's coming to test you on that word want to see what you do that this message must be practical this message must rise from the books into action and what the devil wants to see he can see people can whip him people can fight then you know the Christians praise the of the Lord and right until his hand stuck on and the last one there was a field a field of LS and this field belong to Israel and when they isra saw the the philes coming are you with me do we have believers who run away and ab what what is there did you know you have a lot of position in the Bible [Music] today do you know you are the most privileged people in this earth that God has given you so much God has given you a
