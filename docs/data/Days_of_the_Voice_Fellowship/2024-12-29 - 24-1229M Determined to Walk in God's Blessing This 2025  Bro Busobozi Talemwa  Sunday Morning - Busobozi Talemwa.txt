continue to fight all these battles they wanted to throw shadra into the fire but even the fire could not upon him I pray Lord that you'll keep this child from all sorts of things all sorts of fiery DTS of the enemy Lord the blood of Jesus will be round about him father you protect him all the days of his life and even as you have given him as a gift to his parents oh Lord I pray that he will

22 I'm reading in the name of the Lord the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and he adth no sorrow with it is it amen amen you may be seated thank you musicians that's all the singing for now I just want would like to appreciate you the Saints for for the continued um uh contributions toward our land fund I I missed out the total brother Jo as you were reading how much total we have no total total total total overall total 7 8 million how many how much have we given this year only this year 52 millions and that's not 12 months that's not 12 months uh it's just a few weeks how many weeks okay if you can bring over the file here so I can read the accurate numbers for the people thank you yes this year uh it's been 47 weeks how many months are those do we have anyone with a ccor there divide by 12 H is it 12 divide by or divide by 4 divide by 4 47 divide by 4 that's 11.7 we almost 12 so for this past year for this year 24 we have given 5,400,000 amen and um uh the overall we have 78 million Shillings if you can double our efforts we will go a long way and I would like to appreciate uh the all those who have given this year uh may God bless you very much and you are going to see the fruits of it don't be so fast to see the fruits because when you plant a seed you wait for the Harvest I will tell you one thing the Harvest will surely come always the Harvest comes and um uh I would like to give special thanks to those that are are giving or have been giving um to support us that are not part of the fellowship here I we really really uh appreciate you very much and uh to the team leaders if you want you can cut that portion and send it to them especially to those who are not streaming I know uh my daughter here contacted I I heard I heard that she contacted in in their group uh Pastor Gideon and asked him to join their group and he joined their group and and he has been giving consistently every week for some time when I was told I was amazed and I think that's a good thing thank you for your boldness so it's just to uh you know come to you to tell you that you have to be bold to contact people you think every person is a potential Giver don't say this don't discriminate let every want be a partaker of these blessing we can do this but we can't do this alone we need everyone to stand with us so tell you tell your fathers tell your mother some of them don't come to this Fellowship tell them the vision that we have here and I'm sure they will stand with you amen and uh there's a this person that uh I was informed about from the group of um I think John Wiley uh she's a sister she's not um here but she usually streams our services she is uh from uh um uh I was going to say West n but Middle East yes she's in the Middle East and she's been consistently giving in that group I'm reliably informed that this week she gave um 300,000 something like that and um what's her name is this sister Juliet brother Dan is she sister Juliet yes Grace Oh Sister Grace sister Grace So sister Grace if you get to hear this we appreciate your giving the church appreciates your giving God bless you very much do you remember the group of some sisters I think they were we thought they are from Congo they came here some time back how many remember them they were a group of them and fellowshipped with us for a few weeks and um so after a while I began to see money coming online and I did not know the name of the person and so for a while now uh the first I think she gave 3 million the second time about I don't remember maybe about $100 I don't remember and this time they gave $850,000 so when she gave the I think second or third time I took it upon myself to contact her find out who who is this person and uh then I found that uh is one she's a daughter of one of those older sisters that came and her name is Sister Christina and um she said she was blessed when she was here the church and she failed to be a part of the of the Vision support the purchase of our land and so Sister Christina may God bless you you really appreciate amen well I believe that the Lord will accomplish it when God gives a vision he somehow provides so um I just gave those testimonies to show especially those of you who attend church here if you don't catch the vision the blessing will go to someone else catch the vision tell your neighbor catch the vision Catch The Vision by giving this is going to be your church your land and you must you must catch the vision in order to be a partaker of that place one thing we've not done here we don't pull for money we just to speak the need and everyone gives as God has blessed them and I believe giving must be by revelation we appreciate all the givers amen so this service today is our last service in this year um is our last Sunday this year our last service will be on 31st and before I get into the preaching I just wanted to let you know uh this 31st we we are planning to have a good time here um I was thinking we come at 7 5 but I've been told since we are not going to have a meal people should at least be allowed time to come a bit after their supper yes so we are going to be arriving here by 700 p.m. the songer will be starting I felt led to have our Lord supper during that that time so we are going to replace what we've been doing every year with the Lord um so we shall begin the Lord's supper and so prepare for that I announced it earlier um and that's one of the services some people like running away from don't run away from it Jesus said if you don't partake of it you are not a part of it I believe we all are part of him and we should come and be there prepare your special songs those who want to sing testimonies what God has done for you this year and send it over to uh brother IRAs songer over here amen and um we are going to have different Brothers speak to us all our preachers here I um going to prepare to speak to us so I'm not even singled them out individually they know themselves so prepare to speak to us at least 30 minutes and we are going to have the whole night of singing of of testimonies of preon and rejoicing and then we begin the year in strength how many are expectant so please don't miss bring your friend and let's be a part of that together so this being this being the last service the last Sunday of the year I want to speak on determined to walk in God's blessing this 2025 determined how many are determined I am determined to walk in God's blessing this2 amen some of you have been walking in his Cur but you must be determined Amen to walk in his Blessing coming the says the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and he adth no sorrow with it and in Deuteronomy 11 uh if we can turn there you remember last year when the year was beginning when this year was beginning many of you will remember I read a scripture out of theonomy and read about the blessings and the curses and here in vers 26 1126 he says behold I said before you this day a blessing and a curse a blessing if they if ye obey the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day a if you will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but you turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which you have not known I don't know about you but as far as I'm concerned I want to walk in the blessing of God because the curse of God is not desirous and you know if you under a curse no one else can lift that Cur and you know the song leader sang this song The Cur of sin there is only one who can break a cur do you know in our generation this time we have many churches which are called Deliverance churches and there are men of God who are called powerful men of God and these men are the ones who can break cures so you go in this church and then they will tell you you have this so many Cur and this man will break them but when you go to another church they will also tell you you have more CES so they will try to break it after a while you go to another C another church in another C because they will tell you you also have Cur so you imagine I mean since you gave your life to Jesus you you have been under cures Cur after Cur what kind of cures are these that never go because you are going to the wrong person to break the Cur there is no man who can break a cur and there is no man who can cast who is blessed only God who blesses it is only God who cures blesses you no man can Cur you that is why as a Believer you must never fear witchcraft you must never fear bad Omen you know there are people in this world who speak words and those words follow how many know that yeah there are people in this world who do that their words can follow you and you see people are always living in fear that someone has cast oh maybe so so C so today I want to show you what can break any Cur but I tell you if you under the blessing of God there is no words of a man can follow you there is no enchantment can follow you there is no witchcraft can catch there is no power of Satan can follow you yes Satan has power yes cures exist yes those words can follow but not following me or anyone who is in Christ as I will show you when I'm finishing it says that they that are in Christ are a new creation so we see that you see God is the one who can declare a c or a blessing and as we are beginning this new year I am here today as a preacher to declare a blessing I am not doing it on my own I am declaring a blessing God has already declared in his and I I I will try to demonstrate for you you how you can get a cur how you can be under a cur and how you can break free from it and how you can get into a blessing praise the name of the Lord okay now let us go to the Book of Exodus chapter 20 we are going to do some reading today so I I want to save as much time as I can so you don't get tired now and God spake all this words saying now we are reading Exodus 20:1 I am the Lord th God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven IM or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above all that is in the earth beneath all that is in the water under the Earth Thou shalt not bow down thyselves to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God I am jealous I'm a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me I want you to understand I've preached on this many times and um I've titled it mainly the power of the Next Generation I want you to understand a principle here that there is something that happens when you live under a cur now you may say well I don't live under Cur but any man who is not in Christ is under a cur anyone because because the Bible says we are born in sin we are shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies there is no better man or better woman without Christ and you see I've told you many times that anything that defeated your parents you will soon realize it is is defeating you and even many times until you yourself make up your mind to say I am now making a new generation I am starting a new generation things follow you know because your parents were disobedient to God they do something you realize you do the same thing and you see if they were under that cast the same thing follows him and you see he says H he says I will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children not be look he does not judge you for the actions of your fathers you would be unfair to do that but you see it is upon the basis of your own actions that he judges you you see but you see if like I say that things follow at certain lineage and until you yourself make up your mind and say but I'm tired of this kind of condition it's like poverty for example do you know that you cannot listen some of you Ying stop Ying listen carefully because I'm speaking very important things this morning praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen did you realize that poverty is a spirit or you did not know some of you who think it is spiritual to be poor that's why it is impossible for you to break through what I'm I'm bring bringing poverty because it is a common denominator in many many T but there many other things I could use and until someone is saying I'm tired of they will be as poor as their grandfather their great grandfather their whatever but you see what happens someone just accepts says my my grandfather was poor they never drove a car my father never drove a and his father never drove a so who am I do I think I am better than them no it is all right it just runs through our family am I preaching to someone here this morning and now you have accepted you have agreed and that Spirit of poverty you will worship it forever and you know poverty goes with begging if someone is a begger it means they have accepted they [Music] poor if I begin begging you it means I believe I am poor and you are rich that's why a beggar has no choice a beggar takes everything that is given because he accepts he is poor he's sorry for his Str and he needs someone else who is Rich to help him a beggar has accepted the situ the situation he has worshiped poverty and he has agreed I am good for nothing you find them sometimes on the streets you know he's begging a man a man with all limbs working no not not even a problem on his and his begging it's a spirit which has convinced this man that a poor man and no one can help you to be like others therefore you have to beg those who have to give to you and he has accepted now you may say you are not like the beggar on the street but if you refuse to go apply for a job if you refuse to go find a job and all jobs you think you cannot do any job because you think you are not educated enough let me tell you when God is getting ready to bless you he does not base on your qualification the blessing of God in it makes you rich it's not the job that makes you rich it is the blessing that comes from it takes away all the poverty now of course this riches is a big word here is not only talking about Riches of money the blessing of God makes you rich you see because you believe you are not poor you can say enough is enough I have been without employment for six years for 5 years for three four but this time around as I am beginning this year I'm going to speak my job into existence you can even talk the money you want to ear I'm I'm trying to show you things from a spiritual perspective I'm not I'm not speaking in a kind of perspective because God is not a kind of God God is a spiritual God Amen and you must see things spiritually to understand what I am saying amen go God I've seen it before God can leave all those who have the qualification and it takes you who doesn't have one qualification so in other words what does it take it takes you as a man as a woman to change your mindset to say I am not poor enough is enough I'm not going to be this way anymore I must find a job God must provide for me I must buy a car you know sometimes you must feel sorry for your and you refuse the situation how many to refuse the situation whatever situation you have been in this year you have to come to a place where you refuse it you may be in a situation that is a cycle that you know something defeated your parents and your parents parents to you it may not even be poverty to you it may be last for alcohol to you it might be last for women and you said me I have this weakness some of you have even called it my weakness which means you have agreed to the failures of your p the failures of the generations before you I am looking for a generation which will not agree failures whatsoever we are coming to a time we must be determined to walk in Another Blessing not under C but the blessing of God hallelujah hallelujah there are certain things I know defeated my father I refuse to accept them and I've told you the testimony here some of many times I refused I see this one defeated my father this father me I will not I will not accept for that one to defeat it is a personal choice it's not that D is going to come and then fly on you you make up your mind and say enough is enough I'm going to start a new chapter so now we see here he says um I am the Lord God I brought you out of Egypt out of the house of bondage you should have no other gods before you now a god is an object of worship something you worship something you submit to something you reng something you fear that is a God and now God here is saying do not replace me for any other God do you know what we have done we have replaced God the word with many other things we your fear something you respect more than the word something you rever more than the word something you give your time more than the word you are worshiping that thing something you submit to more than the word you are worshiping that thing but you see God told the Israelites you should not worship other God you should not make any graving image or any likeness of anything that is under the under the Earth or beneath the Earth you will not bow yourself you will not serve them how many gods are you serving are you serving the god of the Bible or are you serving the God of this evil age do you know we have the god of evil do you know he speaks just like this God [Music] speaks the battle is in the mind we fight we fight and battle every day he speaks and God speaks and and the God of this evil age speaks he tells you God do this oh he's commanding many people to go and do things and everyone is just running without go and drink okay you know children when they reach the age of uh usually two there about I noticed a TR that they usually like saying okay everything you say they say okay go bring me that okay D go go go tell Mommy even if he can't talk properly okay D and then he will get there and he and then he comes back say okay go and tell him again okay just agrees and you know people have come to that place where they agreeing with whatever the devil tells them they Servants of the whatever it drink okay go and last after the [Music] other am I preaching to people you're very quiet this morning are you hearing me this morning you you are just serving that Spirit you hate that person okay and you you they develop hatred Envy jealous have you seen jealous jealous can murder someone maybe some of you have been working in it but that has been a cur decide and be determined today to begin walking in the blessing and then you begin having jealous you know jealous can bring heartache did you know that jealous can make you feel that you are sincerely sick because you feel someone is actually having something you should be the one having it is jealous it is a it is a curse praise the name of the Lord and you have agreed to everything you serving that Spirit you are serving that demon but he says Ser do not serve them for I the Lord You Are God I am a jealous God and I visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of those that H me you know it doesn't matter who you know is your father what is your decision what is your choice ah you know it's not upon just the the fourth Generations it says the fourth Generations the third the second of those who H me how many love God if you love God you will ha sin but if you don't ha you don't love God as simple as that you cannot love God and love sin at the same time let 2025 be the year of those who will H those who will love God those who will serve God with all their heart oh can we begin to have Christians who have a heartfelt religion who love God with all their heart listen are you not so tired over put on oh are you not so tired of Faking things you are tired of entering you fake entering the spirit you fake crying fing it's not from the earth I tell you there was a time you know you know I I felt I whenever I would sing the songs I don't feel it from the heart that time I realized there was a problem I went into fasting and praying brother sister let me tell you the moment you begin to feel when you sing it's not from the heart there is danger there is danger praise the Lord I'm trying to stick with my notes because I wanted to go through all these things let's see how the Lord will lead us okay now we look at the children of Israel this is what God told them but he also told them and he said I God I show Mercy thousand them that love me and keep my Commandments God will show Mercy to those that love him to those that keep his word I want to be among those coming amen but you see what did Israel do this is what they did in Exodus 32 vers from verses one and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together and unto Aaron and said unto him up make us Gods which shall go before us for as for this Moses this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what is become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me that's why believers don't wear earrings because earrings has always been a sign of rebellion Rebellion to God you notice that this is one one place where they speak about earrings and then another another place is where you know those who who who after hearing the trumpet [Music] sound and they refuse to go out so they would put earrings in their ears as a sign they will be a slave forever so Believers sisters do not CET the earrings and all the people break off the Golden Earrings which were in the ears and brought them unto Aon and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a m c and they said these be thy Gods o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of of Egypt is that true do are you following the preaching is that true and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast to the Lord imagine they saying a fe to the Lord when they already having their God and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burn offerings and brought peace offerings and the people was sat down to eat and to drink and they rose up to play praise the Lord so now the Jews sinned before God the Jews these people they missed the mark and there they missed the mark they did not a they missed and there were on the side of the cast you know the God had brought them out of Egypt brought them to this place and he was taking them to the promised land but before they reached the promised land they became wary they were so used to you know coming out of Egypt and going somewhere they wanted to worship man is created to worship you are created to worship and if you are not worshiping God you are worshiping Satan you cannot be without worship let me tell you a human being cannot live without worshiping God created us with a thing in us to to worship and if he wanted us to worship him but if we don't worship him there is an option that the devil always present that's why when you go to Every indigenous culture there is worship all over the world here in Africa Afric we have been having trees Big Trees even here and people just go I had their God now broke a piece and killed some people their God became so old until a branch broke but their God was that tree they believe that tree can bless that tree can lift up people it can make millionaires people literally were going under that tree because it had these big Bess roots and people were going in you find them having you know that that back cloth and and you know they they have how do they call that kind of thing is you know they're shaking it those shers and and you know they are worshiping they they come in with money people drive their cars there and they come in money and you know they are smoking pipe what are they doing they are worship something in them tells you must worship but you see the Devil is perverting toship a tree in India they worship idols I remember there is a time I went with my daughter Elizabeth I was going to meet one of the Indians who was going to sell us some computers for a certain project and so he told me it was um I think it was um one of the either Christmas or something so the shop was closed so he told us to go at his home so we went home and uh you know I was still in the in the par in the sitting room talking and my daughter is one who likes all is very curious from the time she was a baby wanting to find out so in a moment I did not realize she had already gone to to some place some other room ah when when I I I came to myself I ran after her and I found her there she was disting these people's gods you know there was a an old woman who came with a white and she was m at she was taking these Idols thinking they toys to play with them did she know these are gods for these people what she did was a very bad thing so I had to apologize I told this man I'm sorry so and then she asked me why why are they mad at me I said because those are their God she was shocked those are God a piece of wood so they worship idols and you find others I was in shashani Ethiopia this is the headquarter of the the Rastafari mov you know they have a sets of things they believe they believe that I don't even want to waste time on what they believe but you see they are so dedicated into eat and one of the things they believe they should eat um how do they call it um that leaf how do they call ited weed yes you see they say they they say as they eat it for them they don't dedicate their lives not weed real weed to them it is not they don't they said I don't know how you interpret it but they said we don't they were teaching me what they believe they said we don't dedicate ourselves we levitate I don't know whether that's the right but you see so as they they were eating it they told me they would get into the spirit of their God is a natural it is natural H it does not have any any problem it's not mixed with anything it just helps us to connect with our God so for them to get into the spirit they have to Che it and then they begin ascending so as they told him can we give you some I told him I'm sorry I'm already high I cannot take this to be high no but you are not I said no I'm already high I'm in Heavenly places Hallelujah am the Bride of Jesus Christ is also in Heavenly blessing we don't need to take weed to go high we are already higher amen and this man told me you know you can take some you know when you take it you to see visions and you know I told him I said sir so when you see Visions how do you feel you feel calm and you feel you love everyone really on the Outlook they look to be so L and and indeed you know that kind of thing makes them to feel like they love every they kind and but one thing I'll tell you but I had a very good brand new camera which I had bought in Nairobi by the time I left I checked I didn't have by their fruits you shall know them Hallelujah false humility false High false high places because they are worshiping a wrong God but we have a right God the god of the Bible his name is Jesus and when we get into the spirit we go high and we receive the true love Hallelujah am and this religion makes us love everybody praise the name of the Lord and there are many gos that people bow to but also you know we have a god of money people in our generation are worshiping the god of money you find that they will do anything and everything to get money for money is their God they worship it if you fail to come to church because of money you have missed the Mark you are worshiping it and I say that without fear of it is the truth if you fail to serve God because of money you worshiping you see we don't live by money we live by God if God wants to give you money he will provide if a Muslim can close his shop for the for the entire time of his worship some some of them don't even close they will remain there but they will be like dummies because they are worshiping and then you will knock and Shout until until people now are used to them if they they know it's time for prayer ah they just walk away and no one will even touch their business because they know they praying and yet they are God it's not the god of the Bible but we Christians who claim to have the god of the Bible we are worshiping money more than our God you find someone failing to come to church because they they can't close their business you can't close your business for two hours you worshiping the god of money it is by the way it's a very sad thing I've seen you know most of the rich rich rich people you look around all the rich people in Christ they don't worship money you had one of our millionaires here what he was telling us you see even if the president asks to see him how many of you have ever met lc3 we are talking about the president of the country this is a billionaire but a beli of this message and he said even if the president to meet him on service time he will tell them I'm sorry I have another appointment I'll see you after or tomorrow and that principle he had it even before and he has it when the riches are here I'm giving you principles to walk in the blessing of God those are the principles you will not become rich by missing Services let God pull you into your riches not your hard work not your hard work but your surrender to God will pull you into the blessing of God amen it's not working hard it is the blessing of God the blessing of God will make you rich and it will add no sorrow upon it don't be driven by money be driven by the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah others worship pleasures as long as something is going to give them pleasure imagine missing a service because you're going to aw imagine youing that thing imagine missing a service because they've called you to a party somewhere I hope we don't have believers who still do that if you here I'm sorry but shame on you you are going to a party instead of going to church on a service day and you're going to a party are we all guilty there's a lot of Silence the God of Pleasure the Bible says in the end time there will be lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God lovers of Pleasures more than you see others will be worship the god of immortal living and they feel me I cannot live without you know living immoral it is almost hard now our time not in the world but in the message churches to find sisters who are virtuous how how come how possible you in in Christ but you are not virtuous what happened what went wrong you worshiping the wrong Gods you are submitting yourself to the wrong Gods missing the mark now listen in the message the search of a perfect man what is it God condescending to his creation God wants to be worshiped the word god means object of worship and it's God trying to to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for he never made you to be something else besides a son and a daughter of God if you have missed that of being a son and daughter of God you have Miss the mar and remember you are not a son or daughter until you filled with the Holy Spirit and if you don't have the Holy Ghost you have missed the M you must be so hungry so hungry for it so hungry for experience so angry to know God in the power of his resurrection you see they have missed the word sin means to miss the mark to miss the mark then if I'm shooting at a Target at 50 yard and I shoot and I take my gun down and shoot and I miss it four or five in what what has happened my gun needs tuning up there is something wrong and if I miss faith in God if I miss to one side come back and get tuned up and there's only one thing that can tune you up that's the scripture the holy spirit in the Scripture it will tune you it will bring you directly into the target again hallelujah amen I say as we close this year our guns need tuning up we need to walk in God is blessing not in the cast and if we are missing the mark let us tune our guns so we can shoot direct praise the name of the Lord what will tune us up the children of Israel had to repent whenever they went wrong they had to repent for God to bring them back again Into The Blessing by the way if you want to know how God deals with you you should see how he deals with Israel whenever Israel sin God gave them into the hands of their [Music] enemies so I'll give you one example there are many but I'll give you one turn with me to the Book of Judges 3:7 and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and forgot the Lord their God and served balim and the Groves therefore the anger of the Lord was hot hot against Israel and he sold them into the hand of the uh this name is quite hard but I'll try he sold them into the hand of chushan rath king of Mesopotamia and the children of Israel served Chan ratham um 8 years and when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them even oel the son of kenas CB's Young Brother [Music] [Music] whenever Israel repented God His blessings followed them whenever they sin they did what God told them not to do he committed them into the hands of their enemies there are many of you who are displaced from your Homeland because of not working right you need to tune your guns and maybe we'll take this um right from Genesis to see and study properly the blessing of God Genesis 121 it says now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy country and from thy Father's House unto the land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou sht be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and Cur them that cast thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed Hallelujah I want you to see Abraham here um Abraham had his father but God brought his word amen listen very care whenever God brings his word his word is a separator you cannot Remain the way you are you cannot remain with your friends things cannot continue normally are you hearing what I'm saying you have to accept the word of God to separate from the world when God separates you it is because he wants to begin a new generation that will walk in the blessing of God I remember from the time I was in school I was always different because I accepted the word of God to separate I was young but I accepted the word of God to separation and you know my friends they would all see me and call me all sorts of names one of them I remember it vividly they called me yes imagine time has pass they used to call me do you know why because I used to talk against what they were doing everyone at school this might appeal to some of your students everyone at school brother everyone was coupling and they would know that one is for the other one but when I believe this message I realized that is not my life and you know one thing you do if you want to overcome you must always talk about who you are but if you find a brother a Believer who is in any community and they don't know what to stand for you are a compromiser you doing what they doing that's why sometimes we tell you call us we preach for your friends and you fear because your friends will tell you you mean you believe those things why didn't you tell you are hiding you are not a genuine believer but a true genuine Bel wherever you are that is a Pulpit where God has blessed you it could be your neighborhood it could be a place of work it could be a school it could be your home that is a [Music] pit you must stand for God tell your brothers about what you believe tell your coworkers about what you believe tell your friends about what you believe tell them about the Judgment of God coming to the world tell them about the rapture tell them about the name of Jesus and bapti him in the name of Jesus are you hearing me church but if you are shying away it means you are not walking in the blessing it means you are not separated but a True Believer lives a separate life separated for the cause of the gospel God said Abraham go away from your country go away from your country and from your father's house oh hallelujah hallelujah God separated him from everything everything he knew everything he saw everything he grew up with God separated him we must live as Believers separated life in 2025 and then how many want to live separated Liv amen I'm one of them then he says I will make you a great nation did you know a nation is going to come out of me a nation is going to come out of you if you are separated that's why God doesn't want Believers to Mar unbelievers because it will interrupt the bloodline are you hearing me he wants a Believer to be married to a Believer both of them are a nation God doesn't want you to be like uh like this um you know Esa and Jacob they were both in one womb and he told the woman two nations are in the womb you know since that time since the flood anyone can give birth to serp but my wife prayed a prayer and I and I I think it's a very good prayer she asked God she said God I'm praying this give me only your seat did the Bible say God can give the desires of our heart so I agreed with we agreed she testified to me and I agreed all the children God will give to us they will be your seed and we believe it so I'm not one of those who believe we give bir the flesh we are not flesh to begin with we are Spirit beings and God must give us his children I'm I'm declaring to you what I believe this is my personal belief so we are ready to stand for that we are ready to F the devil whenever he comes even when he came you know remember my younger child one of my boys was being attacked but I'm sure those demons must have you remember that testimony I gave it to you here they came yes I'm talking spiritual things but they happen physically and they came to take the life out of this child and we kicked them out they left there is something I want you to there's something about birth because you see the devil wants to own soul he wants to claim let me that's the right word you remember Sister Ruth when you had your boy what same thing sister Anita let me tell you there is always something happening during that moment the devil wants to possess his and many of the people in this world are possessed I hope I don't have many here you know until you want to break out of something but there is something holding you it looks like something is pulling why because you are possessed you can't break out of such I'm showing you today how to break out of such a thing and after you broken out of it you believe for your next generation they to will walk in the same blessing you working Hallelujah and God told Abraham after you have separated yourself I will make you great I you amen out of you will be a great nation I will bless you where did The Riches of Abraham come from it came from God my riches are going to come from God my riches are going to come from God Abraham was one of the richest men in his time sister go to school get a job but I want to encourage you all that won't make you rich and I'm encouraging you because God will bless you and you will excel better than all the others and many times people think it is their hard work there are some people who come and we pray for them said pastor pray for me I need a breakthrough on this and you pray for the person and after one year God does it and then you see someone who is very proud and look at the issue is you are forgetting that it is not your hard it is the blessing of and when God gives you his Blessing be humble the more humble you will become the more God will lift you the more proud you become the more God will bring you down am I preaching to someone today you remember when they looked down on Joseph poor little brother but you see God lifted him tell me which school did Joseph go to tell me what qualification did he have by the way did he even go to any school Joseph poor little young [Music] but you see Joseph had the blessing and when he even went among strangers he received favor when God is about to bless you he equips you with certain abilities to get you into certain position it is not your strength or wisdom it is the grace of God when God lifted Joseph how did he lift him tell me how it was by the grace

not a person who gives BL it is God who gives the blessing amen hallelujah praise God and then came to Jacob and Jacob wanted that blessing Jacob came into the same Lage some of you are saying is of believers I was born in the message I am already in the blessing Jacob was born by a Believer but Jacob had to rest for his Blessing Jacob had to have his own experience Jacob had to meet something I'm showing you brother you have to be determined do we believe God gives the Holy Spirit yes we believe it but you have to be determined you have to leave everything behind you have to repent of everything you have to be determined I get it or I die and Jacob was left alone and they Wrestled a man with him still the breaking of the and when he saw that he prevailed not against he touched the of his and the of Jacob's was out of Jo pray until something happens this man prayed until his went out of joints what happened the angel touched him and squeezed his thigh why because Jacob was also squeezing the angel Hallelujah squeeze God until he has no option but to bless you this Hallelujah and he said let me go for the day break and he said I will not let the go except thou bless me so if you want blessing I can't give it God can give it what is this blessing I will tell you what it is it is the holy spirit God gives the Holy Spirit to all those who desire but you can't say I desire you have to be detered say I must have him I must be filled I must overcome the world I must overcome the f I must overcome sin I must break through and this man said I will not let this go except you bless me he squeezed the angel he says I have you here I can't let you go said let me go no I will not let you go and he said unto him what is your name and he said jaob amen and he said your name shall be called No More ja is you see now how he makes your name great he shall make your name great from Jacob to Israel until today no one doesn't know Israel is is making Gaza sh is making Yen sh he making everywhere sh he making Iran sh he making the whole world shame Israel why because he a prince with God not the old name don't worry about your old self don't worry about what you were known with you were known as a very last but listen the moment you meet this Angel and you wrestle and He blesses you then your name which was old will never be remembered again they knew you as a poor man but they can't remember you are like that anymore they knew you are someone who is weak sluggish La let me tell you brother when you meet the angel and you Fe the ghost did you know everything changes you can't even remain poor you can't even remain jobless you can't remain lukewarm you start being on fire your singing will change your amen will change Everything Will Change why because your name name is character for as a prince you have power with God and with men and you have prevailed give it to me Lord power with men power with men you have won take the Holy Spirit how do you overcome the heart I want give up I need it I need it give it to me I need it I said okay you have overcome you have won you don't receive the Holy Ghost by saying give me Lord if you want you promised give it with me and then nothing happens it doesn't happen God doesn't fulfill his word even God was getting ready to hear you and you left be desperate refuse food for a while go in desperation and when you feel you have reached the and nothing is happening continue pushing until something happens God is faithful God has never been a liar if he says he will do it many people give up too soon Jacob rest the whole night he said until you give said the day is breaking I don't care all I care about I need my blessing I need my blessing and Jacob said him he said tell me I pray your name he said where is it that you you ask after my name and he blessed him there but thank God we know his name today hallah if Jacob received it without even knowing his name what about who even know his name do someone here want to know his name Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit the hope of your glory and jaob called the name of the place P for I have seen God first to First and my life is preserved hallelujah amen when you receive the Holy Ghost you will know when you will know where you won't be pretending you won't be presuming you tell the people that is the place where I receive the holy ghost that is the place where I received my blessing I was kneeling there I was standing there and I was like this and then he came Jacob called a place p and he said I have seen God first to face the holy spirit is not received by [Music] presuming you receive him by knowledge and he said my life is preserved you know that this man knew his life had changed he now knew he cannot die he now knew he was a super human instead of being in your comfort zone comforting yourself all the time but yet you know you need a change be determined 2025 to walk in God's Place Hallelujah I don't know about you but I am determined to walk in God's bless only him who can give us the blessing and without that blessing the only option is a cast you can't go to the Rapture if you are not filled in your soul with the Holy Spirit you cannot you're wasting your time if you either go to the world go back to the world oh receive the Holy Ghost because if you don't go back to the world and you don't receive the ho ghost you are only a shark es cting the seed Pastor those are hard words that's the truth the shark shall not be with the these two boys if you will notice their nature one of them was a spiritual man that was Jacob and and and and the kind of man was es but they were both religious and that same thing has taken place all down through the age and spiritual es represented the man of the earth natural religious but never able you know you always cannot overcome it wasn't in him he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb aast the things of the world for is after movies and I don't know what they watch these days those are the names of movies in my time why do they watch these days oh our people don't watch movies here God bless you but if you are there God is seeing you and your appetite is only after those things only you glue on your screen or TV whatever you are seeing those things filthy images of men and women slopping and kissing evil spirits enter you you can't overcome but you see that's scality yes Pastor you mean we shouldn't watch movies a true genuine Holy Ghost Field Believer cannot feed on those things you cannot imagine Jesus sitting watching you know immorality watching Men curing imagine Brother s there and saying Oh Brother po increase the volume say what did he say you see Hollywood came right from the pits of H and it is f in the whole world and you find these days Believers have those things in their home 2025 clean up your house throw those stuff out it doesn't belong in a believer's home can I have a resounding Amen on but Jacob it was just so easy for him to do it jaob one purpose jaob had and that was the he longed for the birth no matter how he got it just so he got it and that Spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today it is coming to our head now the spiritual believer and the man and the believer no one could say they wasn't both religious both of them were they didn't say that one served an idol and the other one God they were both Servants of God now pay close attention to the scriptures now on this subject I'm sure it will help you not everyone that sayth Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doth the will of My Father which is in heaven now if you notice Jacob had one thing that he wanted because according to the word the blessings of the good thing laid in that birth and Jacob that was his only objective the only thing he had in mind was get that birth and Es despised it the one that actually had it despised it he was ashamed of it but Jacob wanted it of how got you see he didn't despise it there are some people who despise it you know when people Fe the ho all sorts of things happen crying mu coming tears coming cry like so people will despise that but let me tell you that's the thing that Jacob wanted Jacob means supplanter deceiver but after finding and coming into possession of that Beth he was changed that's the kind change he was then called Israel a prince with the Lord who had wrestled with him they canot believe today oh as long as I go to church and do a right what difference does it make that is Esau's group he still makes fun and despises the birth he makes fun of it and despises did you see the other brother crying imagine's group did not come today's group he still makes fun and despises the B right he doesn't care for it but Jacob loved it and the spiritual man today and spiritual woman that selected predestinated of God to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they if they have to take their name off of every Church they still want that b right it's the only thing that matters to them just get that b right that's all no matter how what level they have to come on if they have to get down to the Altar and they cry and they boohoo if they have to run through the places and go back and make things right if they have to go and repent this one Whatever it they'll be crazy will sell what they got they'll give away everything you you cannot receive the Holy Spirit if you are not ready to lose your digity everything they have and become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter to them they want the bir that's all they interested in the bir now don't blame them people they can't help it they were predestinated to that I am one of them they are elected to eat and then we see that these two can and spiritual people that's the way it's always happened that's the way it is today it always has been that way hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's the way Brethren that's the way it is today you have to be ready to do everything you can to receive that birth right and I believe that the coming of the Lord is near don't presume that you are filled with the Holy Spirit if you're struggling you know you are struggling find him [Music] if you do not know how come come meet us we will help you therefore If any man be in Christ who is in Christ he that is filled with the Hool so whenever we read that scripture if you don't have the Hool you are not included therefore if being Christ he is a new creature old things that passed away All Things become there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the SP no condemnation that means no cast that means they in the blessing why because they in Christ when a man is in Christ he is well beyond the cast of Sin God has given him the viory and he's working in God hallelujah hallelujah I'm done with my sermon but I want to read you one quote out how many want to hear it praise God brother bam was asked a question question number 12 brother bam I want to know the place where I can tie down and say this man has the Holy Ghost because he did this all this woman has because she did how many would love to hear that and he says there's not a way in the world for you to know it that's right there's not a way in the world for you to know it God is the judge we are not the church just preach the gospel leave a fellow come to me here some time ago I was preaching about what I said the other night he come up to my house and he said brother Bram I wanted I want to be to get rid of my sins I want to be a Christian he sat on my porch he said I heard about a great man an internationally known Man by the name Billy Graham he said I went to his meetings and all that wants to become a Christian he said hold up your hand and Christ as your so I raised my hand he said now all stand we will have a prayer so I stayed and I prayed just as sincere as I could be he said but it did not do me any so he said then I went down to or Robert's meeting he said I had of him and I had they they had all such Joy said I went down to or Roberts and I asked him what must I do to become a Christian he said you get back there I told him I had held up my hand at Billy GRS he said you stay in that inquiry room in there until you are so happy you speak with times he said I went in there and I prayed till I spoke with Tong he said I it come out but it didn't do me no good he said and then I went to another meeting and he told me I hadn't been Sanctified yet said I have to get Sanctified and get happy and shout and get enough job so I prayed and prayed till I shouted but yet still I said brother every one of those things are correct every one of those things them things are good holding up your hand speaking with Tong shouting I believe in every bit of but yet that is not the thing it is accepting the person Christ Jesus these things are attributes shouting speaking in t running shouting crying praying shattering that is just attributes that follow that follow they will always follow okay the first thing is to accept the person Christ Jes there is no evidence that we would say say because a man cries I've seen man cry and cry and cry [Music] tears and cry crocodile tears and he's still just as big as a sinner as he could [Music] be listen Jesus has nothing but sheep Jesus has nothing but sheep is that right the shepherd knows his sheep anybody in here ever hear a God cry well brother you better be a Shepherd if you want to know the difference a goat will cry just exactly like a sheep let a little old Billy Goat get hung up out there somewhere and a little ship on the one side and then the same just the same so when we talk about crying the holy spirit is not crying someone can cry and remain the same old old sinner so if it's crying is not the thing that we can point to although that follows it right sheep can cry and God can cry are you with me so far and had them down at the altar just crying crying out to God oh God just so being away like that God and a got all the time that's right shouting well my have seen them shout and they ran across the floor and jump up and down now you say brother Bram you don't believe in cry don't take me wrong sure I Believe In Christ but I'm saying that is no evidence because they both cry I've seen them shout just as hard as they could sh yes sir and just carrying on like that and there's a lot of them amongst you what I'm talking about I've heard them speak with tongues go out and live any kind of a life just do anything that was no sign but you say you against it oh no I believe in speaking in t it is God's gift in the church if I would take it out I have if I take it out I would have to take a part of God out take my tongue out of my body here I wouldn't have to be a complete body the body of Jesus has tongues in it the body of Jesus Christ has tongues and you take it out you take a part of Christ so many people when they hear Brother bam talk about these things they begin hitting on speaking in Tong and many many many message preachers when they preach about T they're negative but they F to be balanced clears it he says no if you take out Tong it's not a full body the body must have Tong it's a part of it but he saying it is simply not the evidence that you can zero on to say so and so f but it is accepting the person Christ Jesus and these other things they come right on in and they fit together let every member in this body this morning let this little group of people if you could pull the curtains down along on each side where the church had and every person in here receive the Christ Jesus if it did if it did it happened there would never be a fast no argument there would just be perfect love yet you would still believe this and believe that but it would just be so full of love that's it how you know that's one of the ways you know is when someone is so full of perfect now Jesus said by their fruits you shall know that and the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentl I'll give give you my estimation now I love this part listen to very I'll give you now the prophet is giving us his estimation of what he thinks that the closest thing to ear evidence that a man is a Christian than anything I know of you know what it is is a question you know what it is it says it is travail [Music] of [Music] of a person that's always hungry fting they just simply day and night they just can't stand it they've got to do something for God they are full of love they just so travailing all the time the Bible said he that go for sowing in tears will doubtless return again rejoicing singing with him precious Chief if this church I would say this morning this group of people and God say now look William Bram I'm going to make you answer for that group of people what you tell them now do you want them all to shout do you want the people all to sh he sure I want them to shout do you want them to speak with Tong all I want them every one of them do you want them to all dance the spirit I want every one of them all right well that's very good but what would you rather have them to [Music] do I would say I would rather have a church that had such a burden on their heart for prayer that they stayed at this Altar and would be here day and night and everything else and in their house they would be in constantly in prayer and humble and trying to get people to come to God and making calls at the hospital visiting the sick trying to get people to come to church and to do right rather have them that than all the other put together although the other is right she belongs in church but I if I had to have it I would put that first because you've got that you if you've got that the other will take place if you have a people who have a hunger for God thir people who are given to prayer people who have AB burden for the L Soul people who are trying to get people to come to church and to get to go to repent of their sin then you will have the shouting the dancing the tong and everything else if you've got that if you if you'll just get so hungry for God shouting will take place if you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take if you got so hungry for God you just keep on H keep yourself now you got to seeing yourself getting IND different just remember look out there is another Spirit trying to work in there stay right before God humble with trail of just be all your good old fashion I can prove by the Bible that the first time the angel of God went over the lands to seal the hly to seal with the Holy Ghost he only sealed those who cried and sighed for the Abominations done you see the sin that is taking place you see the way people are living their Liv you see things overtaking your agement you see what the world is doing the immorality the dressing how the morals have degenerated you see everything around you and it will take you to prayer so God forgive my country forgive my friends forgive my people for and you'll be so veiling Soul whereby you will just want to bring them to church introduce them to Christ give them the message you have a burden for the world for the souls that are lost brother bam say this is the closest evidence he can give for someone who is filled with the Holy Ghost and you can go and read more there but I said friends this is what we are lacking in our generation whereby we don't even sing anymore we don't sing anymore that Joy is lost theil is L sing one two three four song your eyes are dry possible and you have the Holy Ghost it's not true if you are filled in your heart with the spirit of you will have travail you go to prayer and it's endless you go to worship and you're doing it from your heart you see the sin around you you cry you son oh God forgive these people save them to the point whereby you will see a brother sister joking around and you get a burden for them you take it before God In Prayer oh God save that brother deliver that sister them out of their SE give them a conviction let them come at and seek after your spirit that's a a very close evidence that a man has received the bless God bless you you may stand on your feet and I pray as we are beginning this year we should be determined friends to walk in God's blessing in this coming year 2025 I don't know whether you are determined to do that or whether you are determined to live in sin may God help us hallelujah brother brother ranas if you could come and
