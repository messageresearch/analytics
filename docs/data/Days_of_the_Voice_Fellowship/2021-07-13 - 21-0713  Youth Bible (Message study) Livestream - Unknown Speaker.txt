========================================

[Music] [Music] my [Music] [Music] you [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] so [Music] you [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] my [Music] [Music] so [Music] praise his name he has reset from the data [Music] every time oh [Music] is [Music] from the dead [Music] now [Music] he is [Music] he has a reason for the days [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] okay greetings for everyone god bless you this is all okay so i just want to welcome you to our program tonight loving jesus [Music] um now uh i would like to now i'm gonna okay okay is is yes okay so gloria can you hear me okay i think i'm going to have to change and use this other microphone i hope there i'm fine and everybody can hear you know it is raining and it kind of stabilizes the audio i hope that now you can hear and that you can hear well okay so i need this closed up all right so the reason why uh the reason why everybody's not like by the ocalo for this evening is because uh brother o'kello these people were very busy enjoying the god and they forgot about continuing to read again you know the other friday we were supposed to be sharing on the path most vision the last bit of which and so the people were very busy enjoying their goat and they forgot about you know that but anyways we also had another wonderful time we went into other discussions and testimonies really how many enjoyed that yeah that was wonderful praise the lord because it was a wonderful time nonetheless and so we do not think it was a loss it was a good time you know some brother banham speaks about people who replace the leadership of the holy spirit with the program so i wouldn't want us to replace the leadership of the holy spirit with programs it's good for us to have programs it's good for us to be organized but also above all it is better for us always to really follow the leadership of the holy spirit so when he leads us into certain things that we have not planned we again go in as he has led us praise the lord so this evening i think i'm going to do much of the talking because yeah thank you for sister arcelo for telling me it's not better now uh i'm going to do much of the talking this evening i know that there could be some who have wanted to talk or you oh what a question that they have not sent in but really questions should always be sent in because even if i don't deal with them i have them here you know those that i've not dealt with we shall have to deal with them uh but the reason why i'm going to do much of the talking is i'm going to to do like a recap on the patmos vision amen who is here that did not talk the other time who is that brother brother did you give us your revolution last time everybody did you you were not there okay brother shame we need the we need the camera please yes so uh sister ah okay i was going to call you the other name but i think i should stick with the one we know sister lucas i know that uh you did not give us your submission last time for the uh for the patmos vision and i think he will say something then from you will directly directly take it back and and give a few comments okay just a moment let me put the other can you also work on this so that you can be able to go a little far for people to hear the sister you you cannot put that audio i'm going to use this so just [Music] so sister can we [Music] it was it was where they put that seat [Music] help them see it this is vision okay can you read the portion let me just use another electric illustration suppose you need what does the word what does that word say well we have to read it complex countless things but but they look good in the spirit when reading means did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we will call the elders confess our sins be anointed be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in in but in this spirit but it's in his spirit it is all over there is no other thought over pain what will fulfill his word for we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what will happen and what what would you do that don't go through the arts i don't know if i i've understood it wrongly but what i've understood from this paragraph is because in acts many people were placed in the name of all of jesus christ understood this one he was saying we should not be we should not first be baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ before receiving the holy ghost because as we say everyone who is baptized in the everyone will understand that jesus christ our lord of the holy ghosts so the way i understood this like we we should first receive the holy spirit that we first know who jesus christ is like people in the they first knew who jesus christ was after the place in the name of our yes i know i kept it short last time so um which means how [Music] yes doesn't matter all of those can come before like that's two thirty points and then you wash the water wash away wash you as a vessel then you present yourself with this water only to this have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spiritual things that are in the world they go to their board games their sporting events and their dancing they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers old dried up sticks they enter right into the field of things and become a part of things but oh how they hate the christians for getting the spirit of god's one they call us and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where that is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship no so i don't know if you understood the point because you know i think we also did talk about last time and i was saying that uh you know before you do anything you have to first enter into the spirit of that thing you know when you see people uh drinking alcohol and dancing and they have to first get into the spirit of doing that before they begin doing it or else they will not want they will not do it you know so we notice that there are many people uh that go to play football not only football but also other games before they do those things they have to get into the spirit of doing it you know even they got themselves the way they paid themselves you know if you go for example to watch football and to support it you do not go as someone that is going in a nightclub and someone who is going in the nightcraft does not go next time who is going in uh you know that's what i'm saying so ever again you go to there is a spirit around me actually one day i was watching uh there is this man what was his name this black man who had made himself like a white man what is his name michael jackson yes i i did watch someone you know you showed me you told me about that so i didn't watch the youtube and i was shocked you can check it and find out don't watch watch much of that stuff it will just put you into another kind of speed but you see what i want to highlight for you was as the people came around a you know of course the stage was already prepared for him putting the people into the speed of michael jackson and everything and then eventually he came now when he was entering into the beauty the people started throwing up others jumping jumping jumping jumping falling down and losing their mind and then others were you know they would bring the stress another stretcher yeah they would really put them on and start you know you would think that this is a church you think the holy ghost has fallen upon them it was in the holy ghost it was the spirit of michael jackson it was a spirit of air the people love me so much but they feel like they cry they shout they they have a lot of emotion around what they are doing in the same way actually these are some of the things i thank you for bringing this because it's one of the things i wanted to first begin with here in my highlights for the patmos vision some of the things that i wanted to re-emphasize on before you serve god you must also get into the spirit all these people that you see then you know they don't just jump down because they are more normal because they are how do they call it disco they have to get into the spirit of those things so you don't think that you're going to come that's why by either way do you know why we say how many no are we singing before we pray to get in the spirit do you remember that man uh what was his name um soul king soul king's soul was a man that would get uh of course initially he had a spirit of crisis on him so he was anointed but time came when the spirit of god left him of course when god removed the kingdom from him because of disobedience also the holy spirit left him so from that time this man did not have the spirit of god and demons would come when the spirit of god left him demons would now come to meet you how many remember what happened to you come on now when a bible study i will not was he was depressed and then he sent for a musician to come and give me music and personally what was david so they wish they would perform into something that if and uh what happened why is it that when david played the music by that was he just singing oh he was he playing something and without a boy is uh yes the spirit of uh of the devil would come on him david would be called actually of course they say send for a man that is anointed send for someone from the kingdom who is anointed yes anointed to be able to chase out these demons out of the king but that person one had to be anointed do you have to be a skillful player or musician that's why when we were doing something when someone does is better than you leave them to do it if you're playing the table and you see someone knows it better than you need them to play if you are doing this thing and someone is better than you whatever you're doing for the world someone is better than you let them do it it's not in a bad spirit you know it's because you want it to be done perfect you want it to be where you want it to be that way for what for the kingdom of god we do not do what we do in order to make a name for ourselves you never serve god in order to make a name you serve god because you are you are doing it many of us and each of us actually have a skill you know you have a skill each of you have a skill that god has given to you you've been going with it so when you come into the when you're in the world the devil the world takes not even it doesn't always doesn't even have to be the devil when you are in the world the devil takes those skills and he kind of uses them to further his kingdom can you imagine so when you come to the lord many people they withhold those [Music] this time it skills me sorry so when they disrespect the world they come to the lord they fail to yield their skills to the lord and they want the devil to continue using their skills why they bring their their body their flesh to you thank you to the lord well the doctor is not interested in your body actually he's not even interested in your body at all so ask yourself what have you bringing to the lord when you come to him are you just bringing him a pound of flesh and let me just sit there after all they saw that i was there even if i don't do anything do something find something to do actually when you receive the holy ghost you cannot be seated there you will have to do something the holy spirit will put you into action actually the one of the world is still in the church who knows it come on come on speak up someone who is ready to contribute you want to contribute yes come on explain your points when the holy spirit comes in you what is his work because you are the body of christ so when the holy spirit comes in you what does he do that's my question all right that's the fine the whole spirit suddenly leads us and guides us but what does he do there is something i'm trying to find out yes yes by the margin you want to contribute towards that um we are like the arms of the holy spirit we are like his arms we are like his hands and uh but there is something yeah that is true also but there's something i'm trying to find yes yes yes we change [Music] to make a life yes to make a life that's what i was looking for if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead you can sit with me now dwell in you where is [Music] he shall quickly [Music] now [Music] when the spirit of jesus christ dwell in you he does what one thing he quickens your body look at it this way if you have eyes and the eyes cannot see did they call you a person they call you one blind you're not really a person you are a blind person if if you can't hear they'll not call you a person they will call you a deaf person you cease to be a full person you you become a person plus something or personal minor something so in the same way if you are a christian without the holy spirit you are not a full christian okay you are a deaf christian a blind christian he was telling them the reality of their situation if you don't have the holy spirit to discern your body is losing something so here's what the holy spirit does if if you are like this and the holy spirit comes in you your heart will become active if you if you are like this the whole spirit comes and you your head will become active your body will become active hallelujah now we are we have different parts of the body and we are actually different parts of the globe of christ the other west is all over the world yes now but you do not know which part you are until you receive the holy spirit when you receive the holy spirit then you can be able to identify what part of the body of christ that you are now if you realize you are ready what are you going to do you need to work thank you brother you are even taking it deeper if you realize you are aware you are going to go out and preach because you are realized you are called to be a minister you know what else is blessed are the feet of those that take the gospel of peace hallelujah so if you realize your hand what are you going to give to do give to others right if you realize singing preaching justifying you know if you realize you are what else come on some of you are gifted with sin that's right you know these gifts are born with you naturally but you don't know you don't realize it until you are quickened by the holy spirit when you are created by the holy spirit it kind of uh reminds you who you are and brings you into perspective the right perspective for you to be able to be useful to the kingdom of god but if you do not know what type of the type what part of the body that you are you're going to be useless so we have you in your body but you are actually negative you're making the body lying you're breaking the body blind or death or even actually in the body of christ is not the way they're supposed to be and it is supposed to be because the parts of that body are blind one okay we have another calculator now all right so it says what regulation yes you even know what does it say they are they are blind [Music] god bless you because you don't have the holy ghost if you have the holy ghost of the holy spirit someone who was saying that the holy ghost and the holy spirit are different you know that that's because that person never went to school okay but like yeah you know i i did english in my school and then i also studied a little bit about elizabethan english and you understand that language evolves and language changes it's not it's not static language changes even in uganda languages they are words that you no longer use other words you use that your mother or father or grandmother grandfather may not understand but it is actually the same one so we know that holy ghost then we used to mean spirit you know when he said ghost then used to mean spirit and spirit then used to mean like some evil spirit or something yeah you know and it is now the vice versa today so but we know we understand it's the same thing right spirit and ghost actually that was a ghost because i saw a ghost but then it used to be i saw a spirit i swear you understand but it is all the same spirit and ghost means spirit means spirit and when you put it on it then it becomes our holy spirit so if one goes through one species the same thing so when you receive the holy spirit when you receive the holy ghost you know your life changes you know you realize who you actually what part of the body that you are you become a life you're hey i'm a lady you know the child you know you need to watch when the children realize that they can go like what was happening all these times that's when you when you receive the holy spirit you realize that you used to do i mean you can do things you never thought that you can do so you will you always want to do it many times you know when i see people filled with the holy spirit they speak and they can when they realize they can speak in tongues my my mind almost every service they want to speak in tongues if you have never spoken times you won't even understand it until one day they realize oh well i now know who i am and you know they will speak tongues once in a while maybe if there's a special message the spirit is trying to pass you know and then and you know that when they see the whole speech one bit they'll always shout you know you know because something has happened in their life you know and it will be all the time almost every moment something's voiced but you know as they grow in christ not that the holy spirit will leave them but you see they begin you know now you don't run all the time do you why even when someone says you run you're like ah come on let me walk huh he's like i said but when you are young when you bring elephants or whatever this place he won't walk because he's just realizing i can walk but actually even now you can run closer and there are certain circumstances where you need to run there are certain circumstances where you need to shout where you need to speak in tongues where you need to prophesy where you need to get into that spirit of something that you are supposed the hospital is trying to do in your life okay i must be talking about the word speaking mainly but what i'm talking about right now is that when you receive the holy spirit here's the main thing that you become uh-huh the ones are just coming up you become an activated member of the body you become an activity part of the body before you receive it you are you know you are inactive you are dead you are almost dead you are inactive okay you can't dream a dream you can't sing a song you when they bring it let us sing a song which one is it he brought me on you know so it's like as if you are not in for it you think it is another song you know i'm not telling you people who are not in the spirit how do i behave they will always try to say it's as if it is the song that was the problem they were trying to say it is their their voice their vocal cords they were trying to say that they were not gifted to see they were trying to say the kid is very poor their kid is different their kick is high it is why because they are not even in the spirit so when you get into the spirit of any sin you will do oneness even a preacher if he just preaches love getting into the spirit of preaching that's why you go wait up on the road but abandon christians also waiting waiting on your ministry or waiting on your ministering you go somewhere and wait if your preacher you go somewhere and wait if you are a singer you go somewhere you don't just say oh by the way where i want to speak yourself just quickly no that's not right you know if you really want to minister a song did you hear that the language i used to do so you're not going to sing so that they can see you you are going to minister what is ministering someone help me is not necessary to preach my brother now are you saying i cannot minister so do you know to bless somebody to lift up somebody to you know impact someone to raise somebody you understand you can give him all those vocabularies to uplift a soul or a spirit to to view yes to bless too 85 too come on now during college yes my grandson is right now when you are talking about the spirit ministry ministering is necessary to preach even a preacher is also a minister because ministering okay it's blessing uplifting and also you can do those things in other ways not only preaching your teaching so when you receive this spirit when you are ministering but the bible says everybody should wait on their military so if you're ministering a song don't just come to see her let me go and show them that i have a very good voice then you come and then evenly sometimes it doesn't work out well you know say you you know whenever you want to lift up to show yourself it never works you see you will come sing and then the vocal cords will tell please give me a break you're like what happened to me you know so but if you are you want to minister if your desire is to minister you wait for god because you realize within you you have no power to touch people's souls attack people's hearts so you wait on the world and ask him say lord please empower me you put yourself in that in that atmosphere where the worst people come and congeal your soul and the spirit and the activate now you come up in power to minister to bless to lift to uplift you understand to encourage so we if you want to do anything for the lord you can never do successfully without getting into the spirit and getting into the spirit does not necessarily mean come on i want to hear your opinions each of us here has their own how can i call it uh can i call the temperament each of us is built in a certain way okay they are acquired people among us like who like monkey all right you also hear your friend okay somebody's saying now let anna speak for you [Music] all right also sometimes you have people when they get excited they do several different things sometimes you someone gets excited they cry they just cry [Music] you brother it just becomes more obvious so you wonder what is happening when they get into the spirit they shout i don't know what all right i'm talking about the spirit when they are happy some of them they just shout [Applause] [Music] all right when people are happy they do different things depending on their natural mecca so what am i trying to say you are not going to come to a brother who is touched by the right by the holy spirit who is just by what and the tears are running down their cheeks but they are not falling down and talking in terms and let me tell them brother get in the spirit in the spirit but someone you know when we get into the spirit depending on our makeup and depending on the gifts the natural gifts that we have within different things others speak in times others like for me when i get into the spirit many times i feel like uh saving and when i sing and i get into the spirit i feel like prophesying or or you know you know you know giving a word of the of the of the spirit you understand but not everyone will prophesy not everyone will sing not everyone will shout and others if they don't shout out in the spirit you know they have shot and others have to roll on the floor actually i don't know how to fall down so you're not going to begin saying no i'm not falling down i'm not going to speak yeah but i have people speaking those words you know they're making it up so even you are also making eater others when they get into the spirit they feel like preaching their preachers for that matter if it is another preacher sister and you get into the spirit and you feel like oh i want to speak the word i use another chair here that if you want just use this okay extend extend this side all right okay so i'm also acting like a now okay now what is my point here i'm trying to emphasize the point here when john was in the spirit what did he do when john was in the spirit saints what did and then he wrote can you imagine writing down actually many times when i'm in the spirit and there is not no one to prophesy to you know you know it's like right now brother solomon i see you of course and i know you and i if i'm not in the spirit you know i may not tell you anything about your life but if i do get into the spirit then i'll be able almost to know you very well then the hospital reviewed me things that even i not know and i can begin today and if i'm around and i don't have anyone to you know speak to those words of inspiration what i will do i will quickly pick up a pen and paper and begin writing as the word speak is revealing to me and sometimes when i read it through maybe it is about me or someone else then if it's about someone else i would send it to them in another country the other day remember i was here in the church and we were preparing ourselves to go i was preparing myself to go to preach on the food and then brother was some reading so i was standing and then there is an advice i read oh it took me to the anointing and i i want to give the spirit when i went into the spirit i felt like prophesying but i was a lot of god in the room i could not uh to i could not go to the bottom of the public immediately i want to prophesy and what i did because the spirit of course is a is order yes i picked up a pen and i was gonna pick up a pen and paper but then i think like you know when you are in the spirit you are late to do the right things i felt like to pick up my phone and when i picked up my phone you know i didn't even know who i was going to write but i just started like talking to someone in that instance so when i picked up my phone just like i'm doing now just like i'm doing now but i just went and i realized uh the hospital was leading me to write to a brother brother brother kennedy when i went with the other time and i started writing once so the other time he was telling me what exactly was happening at that same time when that message came to him and when he read it he was asking god to speak to him about some things just he was in prayer asking god speaking about some things and that message was exactly answering those things which wanted god to speak about and here i was over 1000 kilometers away from where he is the holy spirit inspiring me so now here that's where we shall also get a point of what we talk about people hesitating when you are in the spirit of the holy spirit leaves you some people when they speak they are letting pray you know you know a spirit lady prayer is not like a prayer that you pray because you have to i speak like the play how many know what a spiritual prayer is yes someone wants to talk about it who are sorry about it now all of you are your hands up so you don't know it really okay can you can you highlight sister come on brother i want you to talk to tell us about experience and i'm happy with your sister who is going to talk about that because it's a very very important subject you know a prayer is a very important subject especially sisters that's your area really where not only sisters also brothers but really sisters one can use you so well on that on that area so uh can we can we have right on that on the subject so that this is like share with us that you are thinking about or sometimes you're there you bring your own things and you start singing singing and you the singing reaches your heart you sing from your heart you cry and pray and pray and pray how many have ever gone into that kind of scenario whereby the holy spirit comes upon them and they feel like you told the hospital amen all right now if you have never switched that moment if you have never reached that moment then i'm telling you you have missed out a lot you have missed out quiet a lot that's a spiritual prayer is the best thing that you will ever find yourself because when you want to have something all right if you're not baptized can the spirit come to you and start okay i've gone okay that's good okay you is i was singing when i sang a song i felt like praying i started crying i just went inside and closed the door and i started praying seriously like for 30 minutes then after i felt better i think all still can lead you even if you're not baptized okay how many have something to say about that you have a comment can i spill read you into prayer even for your baptized yes [Music] yes why do you believe it support your answer because uh to receive something from world seriously you need to be in the spirit and even which i wanted remember you're not a baptist yes you are not yet filled with the holy ghost but you need to be in four foreign not necessarily the holy spirit but the spirit of that field which is going to be great i and this is what the prophet tries to do to say here so you need to be in the spirit of anything before you receive reward from that thing or before you engage into that thing even before you receive the holy ghost now as baptism of the holy spirit you need to be in the spirit to be able to receive a full benefit of the things of god right yes for you to know the word you need to be in the spirit of the world even now we are doing a bible study maybe here there are some people who are the holy spirit and there are some people who do not have the holy spirit but you need to be in the spirit of bible study you know if you're here and losing it is a very clear sign you are not in the spirit of that that thing so you cannot be blessed at all even when they ask you what did you learn nothing why not because you attempted because so you even need to be in the spirit of receiving the holy ghost for you receive the holy ghost why do people receive one of us when they have our place that others don't receive the holy ghost and two years later in the spirit sometimes you take people for baptism and then you wanna do they really see the importance and the strength of this thing you know and that's why for me to take now i know there are about five people here to be baptized but i will not force you i'm not even demanding i'm going to wait for them to come pastor where are we going you know that shows they are in the spirit of going to be baptized so whenever they will receive the full benefit of it you know everything that the god promised they will also receive it connect was received the holy spirit sister unfortunate was he baptized yet so we found out and i think it's a clear sign he's not listening to that sharing that someone can receive the word of god before water it is very very much possible someone can receive the one of us before some of you are doubting me and i don't believe that there is a family of canadians that man received the holy ghost and remember he was running as people giving he was already the spirit of therapy he was in the spirit of prayer he was he was doing all these things even before he had peter preaching so because he was in the spirit when peter came down the man was already in the spirit of the one even when he began preaching the word the man was in the spirit he received the holy ghost the man started talking dance peter was shocked what what just happened with the brothers used to be people who don't even dress right yes but now you are born in karamoja and you are preached to hiddens and these people don't even rest these people don't even know the name of jesus and while you are preaching he suffered this is the first place in the bible where i see a pastor stopping people when they speak he was like wait just a moment brother sister stop stop the moment come here i really doubt that kind of speed which even breaks chairs you know and yes i might be in the spirit but in the spirit of dancing right i will be the spirit of dancing that does not mean i am filled with the holy ghost i might be anointed and i'm there for me in the spirit of dancing and then i can dance and dance and last and then and then as i'm dancing i come across a chair you know i'm not going to break it because i am in the spirit of one see i will leave the chair even if i'm closing my eyes when i feel i'm touching something i just opened my eyes you know and oh then continue i still do it with understanding that the apostles said what everything we do should do it in the spirit and also understand you understand so when we are praying we pray with the spirit but also we understand therefore when we are going forward that's all we need to understand what it is all about and when you are working there is nothing by the way there's nothing that can hinder you to receive your holy spirit as long as you believe what a baptism is a must for anyone who believes someone says so if you receive the holy spirit before baptism what why do you need to be baptized after all now it is finished i said oh wait a moment if what you received was the holy spirit the holy spirit is in agreement with his wife therefore you must go and be what are baptized yes exactly assigned what he received was not the holy spirit it was just a spirit but not the holy spirit maybe you were excited maybe you know but the balaam said all those things are impersonated but there is one thing that they will come up you know what it is you know what it is someone said the why actually the devil also knows the word and he even trembles because if you know that god is one of the tremble so you think you're not a person of the world he has made himself the angel of light and his ministers the ministers of the ministers of darkness brothers righteousness hallelujah but but you know how about you'll be putting those words for us here when you speak a quarter you just get it he put it here you know so he has he is the angel maybe you also don't know the scriptures we're talking about he's the angel of darkness but he has made himself the angel of life and therefore has made his ministers the ministers of righteousness you know so he doesn't know what so what can water does not change your stage when even the rain of the yeah the bible talks about two different rains the lottery and and the former range can you explain the truth brother all right can you highlight this i want someone who can explain what the focus it ray is and what the latter rain is you can who can who can rather you can i am not you can you can oh no one here can oh that's the best you see why we should read the message yes yes even if you see the other ministers who put you very well you must read the message by yourself you must go and say to the angel give me the word give me that you must go to the engine and tell him give me the boo give me the right that's what job in revelation it shows us that we still need to know more and more and more and more and i think i thought we were going to spend only two months or one month on this chat book but i think we will finish one year can you get informative chapter 10 quickly now we go back to this and then we'll go back to the latter room okay somebody someone read for me revelation chapter 10 you have your bibles right sister is your bible can oh no this is so bad okay verse one read revelation chapter three first one are you highlighted and i saw another [Music] prayed seven thunders entered their voices and when the seven canadas had uttered their voices i was about to write and i had a voice from heaven saying that we still have those things which they say that has attacked and write them notes and the angel which i saw stand up on the sea and upon the uplifted up his heart to heaven and sway by him that even forever and ever who went in heaven and the things that they are in uh and the earth and the things that they are in uh and they see and the things which are there in that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished that's what's what season okay go ahead brother [Music] and the voice which i heard from him and speak unto me again and say go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing upon the sea and upon the earth and i went and took the angel and said hand and editor and it was in my mouth it has honey and as soon as i had beaten it my page was bitter and he said unto me now must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and things okay you see sir chapter 18 yes which standing upon the sea and upon the earth that's my state [Music] now i wanted to show you this park here that uh when the seven thunders out of their voices and john was about to write what did the voice say seal them up and write them now but when it comes to verse seven what happens in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins that's why this ministry is called date of the voice in the days of the voice of the seventh age when he begins to sound what will be finished so the mystery of god is being finished in the days of the voice not in the days of the man but in the days of god who is the seventh angel yes is the last death prophet is the seventh messenger because there are seven ages seven eight messengers so the seventh messenger is the prophet of our generation all right yes and therefore his his message is the one that is going on now on tapes it is recorded on tips as our voice as ah and the bible says the mystery is going to be finished in that day can we now agree we are in the days of that voice we are in the days of the fulfilling of the finishing of the mystery of god now all that mystery of god is here in the form of the message but what did he say he said verse 8 now and the waste which i had from his respect and to me again i'd say go and take the little book which is which is open in the hand of the region which standing upon this yeah [Music] is taking the bride who right the bride so john was a brother right yes in tribulation right so john is typing that right so he said john take that [Applause] [Music] and that's why we are preaching this message into all our hearts why we are taking the book hallelujah so can i be right now i said john take the book john take the rule don't take the book but the same as god bless you what is eating spittle speaking sister fortunate leave these ones alone what is taking the book spiritually speaking eating usually is hearing and believing you can be reading and hearing and believing right so when you believe something it means you have eaten it you understand yes praise the name of the lord so john has taken naboo and john now today we are taking that book and i was going back i wanted to remind you of the lottery and the former range the former rain is the one that comes fast and but the banham says that former rain i'll ask you the former rain is that teaching rain is that time when the world is being taught is that frustrating to come you know like those of you have ever done some farming in the village when uh when uh when you're going to do funding with your blood mage what comes first reign that first way is to help you to do what to prepare the ground and then to sow the seed huh yes but there is another rain which comes when so in the same hospital speaking the former rain is the uh sowing rain and there rather rain is the stream so now when you arrange spiritually speaking it means that spirit you know we're talking about the spirit huh so it means that spirit or the anointing right so that is that spirit that god sends in or sends out the spirit of teaching the spirit of teaching and it has come through this message of the hour you must receive the teaching of the word you must be told you must understand the mysteries you understand yes that's to do with your understanding your spirit but apart from that there is also the latter rain that is the outpowering oil the holy spirit now the life of that white when you receive the former rain you are receiving the outpouring of that of the old street now in the end they say there shall be both in the every time there is a promise that there shall be both the former reign and the gallery together the child has been told for through this message of the year we received the vote we received we should talk about that in details but for now what were we proceeding being in being in the spirit so i believe that it is a must for all children of god to be in the spirit reasonable amen which part were we are that was the choice that we were talking about oh yes a question okay proceed let me see what question you have and then if it's something that you can deal with now deal with it if not we can talk [Music] can you speak up your voice [Music] [Music] was this one who made an idea and he told the world that we don't watch that but at first yeah he had seen the vision between evening the um [Music] [Music] in a dream where i told him about the view let him take recently so i'm wondering when you are saying that when you get into the spirit it means you become active yes so i have that question how come the other people [Music] they brought those dreams in okay that's uh that's a good question now it might appear and just remain there for a moment that it might appear that when you if i understand your question right you are saying that i've said that when you use when you when you get into the spirit actually not getting in the spirit when you receive the holy ghost that's what i say when you receive the holy ghost you become an active member of the body of jesus christ and now your question is that does it mean that when you become an active member of the body of jesus christ what about the others who are not members of the body of jesus christ is that profession what about the others who are not active members of the body of jesus christ yet they dream they speak in tongues they that's what i told you that all those things that the body of christ will do the devil can impersonate whatever it is that the body of christ will do the body can impersonate but i was coming to our i was saying that it's one thing they never cannot impersonate what is that and actually that one brought us all down to the ring and the four marines and everything that's what we were trying to track thing the devil cannot impersonate no one knows what it is that's exciting yes jesus sorry brother the sixth sense faith faith is the sixth sense so you are telling me that the devil cannot explain faith he surely can yes you can can you personally that's what it means if they if they can behave as if they have even more faith than us you know so impossible doesn't mean they have impersonation does not mean they have it only means they again they behave as if they have that yet they don't i do not say that all these things that the body of us does they can do but i said they can impersonate they will not have the real it's just like someone having a fake effect or not when you have the original one so those two different bills or dollar bills are different completely but the other one looks like as if it's the original but it is an impersonation of the origin yes exactly so the question is what is it that the democratic person is love sorry oh sister agnes wants to say something mr aguiles do you want to say something [Music] yes you cannot impersonate the life of christ amen [Laughter] [Music] if there's one amen that the devil cannot impersonate is the life hallelujah he can never impersonate their lives you will tell someone you love them on their mouths but you cannot really truly love them by your actions and you are impersonating right yes they won't even say he said he loves me but the way he looks the life you can't impersonate the life the words of the flesh are manifest and these are one two three four and the words of the spirit hallelujah the words yes quickly now hallelujah this is a wonderful wonderful look at it now yes now the rest of the flesh we we talked about this on sunday uh the ones of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication and goodness lasciviousness excuse me at our tree idolatry witchcraft hatred barriers emulations wrath strife seditions heresies endings murders drunkenness revealings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have told you in the time past that they which do such things by the shape the day which do such things um all of us now okay let me ask you a question is it possible for a manga tree to look like uh when it is growing to look like some other kind of tree you are not good farmers let me ask the new farmer when you go in the garden and the mango tree is planted before it bears fruit is that not possible for you to mistake it for another tree where do you see it from the answer is this person [Music] but is it possible for a person even if he's not a good farmer to mistake apple and uh and what yeah i'm talking about apple tree is it possible to mistake the fruit of the mango tree and the fruit of the apartment why is it not possible because a fruit precisely tells what the tree has been or what drink and bear and therefore that tree or that few will tear what the tree has inside of it the field will only bring out the life of us there come on now and that's what jesus was saying you shall know them by their word so you can warn everything and that's all good and we also have to do it we don't have to say that because who told you it is for us simply because the predictions are impersonating it does not mean that we should not have it among us can you read it for me give me mark 16. oh man we are even veering away from the batman's vision all right mark 16. mark 16 mark 16 verse 15 but what is your life you have your own bibles because you are going to annoy your bible sister can you find your bible it's just disappeared like that oh my jesus christ this is dangerous how can you go to a guy without a host all right someone read for me all of us [Music] together is you say amen and this shall further amen in my name they shall cast off their voice they shall speak with the new terms amen so how many of you have spoken with mutants of you have spoken in a amen time yes i understand that all of us may not speak in times but how come that group of 20 40 no one speaks has spoken ever in times why the bible says church he's afraid but also do not say that don't talk in tongues alone when you are alone so say that when it is in church tell them otherwise tell them to others and do not speak things at all right yes hey you people hey if it is in the church tell them to interpret otherwise tell them to shut up and never speak tongues again if they can't interpret amen oh lord amen is this what we have preached to you god had mercy this is not this is never what we preach to you he's not even what the table says you must know what the bible says or else you will take a first look to you that's why the bible studies like this are very important can someone help us right now what does oh my goodness this is very important i cannot believe it like that [Music] 14. okay begin from 19. first corinthians chapter 14 bus says begin with the verses this verse you say that the holy spirit well the holy spirit the devil can impersonate that they are they have the spirit but really we know that they can never receive the true genuine holy spirit and uh we also know as we found out that but the devil cannot impersonate the life of the child of god the son of god filled with the holy spirit that the life the devils are not impersonated okay brother martin you might just be having network problems i think because the the signal is pretty good here all right we're taking so long yeah just like that okay all right right there okay now i wanted to begin is wrong with you i told you that's 19. yes yeah okay can we begin from go a little bit up okay let us begin from verses [Music] six verses four okay i'm going to have people reading one by one first brother can you read from there all right read from verse four when you're tired someone else you take it from me okay if you can't really find it just say it fights all right do you understand that first verse yes he that speaks the unknown term that's what what does edifying mean [Music] but rather that he prophesied for greater is he that prophesied than he that speaks with dance except he interprets that the church may receive a defile no no what does that mean i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation of my knowledge or my prophesy or my doctrine continue i didn't think you don't like giving sound whether by or have except they give a distinction in their sounds how shall it be know what is piped or how if the trumpet given uncertain sounds who shall compare himself to them meaning sounds have a meaning sounds like what when a sound is spoken every sound on earth by the way has a meaning that's right did you know that [Music] [Applause] yes all right continue so likewise what's easy to be understood how shall it be know what is spoken split into the air there are it may be so many kinds of ways in the world one of them is without signification have you heard yes the voices are so many i shall be and to him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me even for as much as he uh zealous of spiritual gifts seek that in other words if i just speak things that you don't know it is like as if i'm a chicken or something you know something that is weird to you you know what [Music] [Music] okay my spirit prayed but my understanding is unfortunate what when i pray listen now church we are believers in the message the bible says if we if i pray in unknown tongue it is useless please please what is it if i pray in an unknown tongue it is useless my if i pray in unknown time it is useless amen how dare you say amen to such a statement it's not what the bible says please already see what the bible says if i break in i'm not in an unknown tongue my spirit prays so in other words you're praying you're in the spirit actually when you're praying in terms you are in the spirit the first time i spoke and prayed in tongues i felt like i've never felt before your spirit right but your understanding is you can't understand a bit of what you are speaking even yourself with speaking it unless you know that language or that time for that matter amen please let us continue on all right yes verse 15 what is it today i will pray with the spirit and i will pray i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also yes i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will speak with the spirit and i will speak with the understanding also hallelujah so in other words when you pray and you don't understand what you are praying that's right when you pray and you know understanding what you're praying it is not helping there others he's not helping the others there's a reason why he's speaking this about support there's a reason why he's teaching this he's not teaching it as in the context of a person he's teaching it as in the context of a church coming together all right so let's let's continue on uh-huh else when thou shalt mess with the spirit how shall he that occupied the room of the unland say amen so if you walk in the who are in the room and they have not understanding of what you are speaking there and around meaning they have no understanding of what you are talking about how shall they say amen are they giving your friends saying that he understands not what that was saying [Applause] all right read honda [Music] thanks well yeah but the other is what they defined okay i thank my god i thank my god i speak with dance more than not yet wait a moment they knew how to speak in terms and by the way as we are reading this you must know that there are tons of men and kinds of angels tongues of men is that which is known by people already times of angels is that which is not even known by people whereby it's a combination of words every sound has a meaning right but there is a combination of sounds that is not known by any human being on earth so when the spirit of what comes on you you can either speak a language a time that is known you for example speaking chinese it can be me speaking ethiopian language how perfect sometimes when we are preaching in ethiopia and the holy spirit comes with me and we are preaching someone and i feel the other person is not bringing the point sometimes it strikes me so hard that i can take a minute or two explaining to someone in america and i'm not good in america at all so that i called it i was speaking intense to me because i didn't understand but to them they understood that's how it was on the earth pentecost they spoke the tongues of the people so that they can preach them baptism in jesus name and those people did not understand the language of these people and these ones didn't understand the language of those people that's how it was those were kinds of men and when when paul says i speak in times with more than you all maybe he means their own times all the times of men because paul was a very well-traveled man he had traveled many places and he knew many languages all over the world right it was among the romans it was among the the jews you understand yes but also you could have received some words of the spirit whereby you could speak languages or tongues that are tongues of the spirit are you following me yes okay so when we talk about times how about your money tango the spirit and times are rather tongues of men and tons of angels there's another verse that speaks of that okay read verse 19 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown term hallelujah he says yet when i am in the church i would rather speak fine words with my understanding i rather speak foreign i can understand which means in here it is also possible who was knowing many times god was speaking times more than everybody else tons of ages perhaps times which he never knew all right he was speaking times amen that he himself would not work could not even understand but he's saying here yet in the chat i would rather speak five words with understanding than speak ten thousand in an unknown term come and breathe whether it be no children in an in understanding how be it in my children but in understanding demand but in understanding be men continue brother in their law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips where i speak to these people and yet for all that will they not hear me say the lord hallelujah who is going to speak in other times come on answer me now what's with the two everyone now one two three four [Music] in other words and i speak your tongue your language you will say hey this must be good you you even speaking my language like it was on a new pentagon but if you don't you do believe all i need to do is to prophesy you know like the nature of the gift which sometimes all the times but sometimes once in a long way that operates through me i notice it is only for believers even if the world just came upon me and they prophesied someone who is working on the regulars look at this one maybe someone told him about my life or something they will not work discernment prophecy and all that kind of thing what's only for believers verse number three if they are if therefore the whole church we come together into one place and all speak with turns and there comes those that are unlearned oh and believers will they don't say that they are smart they are mad but if all prophecy and they are come in one that and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so say falling down on his face he will worship good and report that god is in you of the truth okay now i will take it out from there now praise the lord amen thank you brother thank you okay now that's what you finished verse 26 how is it there brethren please don't sleep on me now how is it brethren when you come together every one of you has assam has a doctrine [Music] teaching a teaching like our teaching on one god are teaching what a baptism are teaching on you know but there are teachings that the apostles that is the true doctrine the teachings that they work the nation's ring that is not in the one those are doctrines of men wrong doctrines okay okay when we say attack so do you see that also a tongue should also be accepted in the church please don't take it out yes don't try to stop realizing the message many people think time is demonic please is part of the move of the holy spirit [Music] has so revelation is not necessarily a teaching or or you're not going to stand on the proof to give your teachings but you are going to give your revelation so how are you going to give your revelation do you understand that relationship can also come to a sister so how will she give psalm is a song all right but a revelation is not a song and revelation is our is our come on now a revelation is a prophetic insight something prophetic are you following me yes brother are you i understand what i'm saying a revolution there is uh some time we were praying here i don't know if you were part of that meeting but some people are part of that meeting where god gave several revelations to people how many were there that service raise up your mind okay one two three four five okay a few do you who who received that i mentioned about their life that day you okay you you are one of them was it true now a revolution sometimes it's about something what someone has done or is thinking or is about to happen to them it might be something that they know or something that they do not know if it's something they do not know the lord is telling them what is going to happen we understand but if it's about something that you know it's about something that's already going on in their life and maybe if it comes to others it may mean nothing but to them it may mean something that no one knows but they no it might be something about your thoughts and the lord gives you a revolution maybe what you're thinking about blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you understand yes so that day you see the revelation you said it was true someone else you did was it what was it did it make sense to you i don't know what revelation that you received was it true who else you did who else now that yeah someone else here is actually my wife too you remember that i i had to move my wife away from here because the holy spirit was giving me revelation about her life and i did not know what it was going to be what kind of nature it was going to get anywhere in a mixed mixed congregation here so we have to take because my heart was pounding with the revelation that god had revealed to me about her right and so when i took her there i you know started giving her everything and and she raised up my hand which means it was also true now all these revelations about their life but i never knew anything about what they were thinking okay i might not dispute but i know i cannot know what they were thinking just like in other places sometimes actually there was even a time brother uh you know you know god gave me a revolution as i was one day i bought a minister in the u.s america is ways away another in kenya you understand this is i'm going to give you my testimony but i'm sure if you two have a gift you can give this one about that what god has done through that gift now remember a relationship is prophetic okay let us continue with that scripture by the shame so our revelation is prophetic and when it comes it is not a song when it comes it's not about tree okay it's not going to say now in the book of psalms it says if it's a process it should be direct what's your name blah blah blah blah blah blah everything right right like that not you know saying you know you know in the name of jesus according to the book of psalms you know it says repent only people someone sent me to repent no it comes as an inspiration directly to you it's not adultery you understand okay all right i think uh we're not learning gifts generally so i just wanted to bring in that okay has an interpretation now interpretation is suddenly coming to help out on the tangent issue wait don't highlight anything that i've not reached okay but he says let all things be done recently okay let all things be done now since here is the moment that i wanted now we have seen can you question that change we have seen that this gift of times should be accepted in the church but this gift of times should be meant to edify the church but remember the interpret the interpreting part wherein he talked about he's talking about it when we are in a place like this when we are all together okay but when someone prays in tongues his spirit also prayed he defies his spirit but he doesn't understand anything but he defies these spirits of someone might as well pray times are on but when it comes to the church there must be there must be interpretation for the finding of the church okay that's what the seven i'm going to ask you questions after i'm done with this teaching okay verse 27 all of us together now if every man speak in an unknown time let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course let one in that print so we are in a church sister franklin raises up speaks in terms she either interprets or someone else interprets if someone else also sees a revelation and speaks someone essential priest maximum one mom another in the prince that's done that's in the church now and that usually that's what we preach and we stop there [Music] that means that if someone else speaks they're out of order it doesn't mean it's not god's message but they are out of order why they are not able to be ordinary not the gift but the people gifts of the prophets are subject to the prophets okay verse number seven oh vasquez amen all right hey you people don't i need nothing to speak maybe i'll just apply the physical sticks but if they have been you know in that preacher this person is speaking in times and he's later created let him never speak turns again so if there is no interpreter and the person is speaking in the church and he cannot interpret and there is no interpreter he should be told not to speak in the church again [Music] the bible says to pray where's that verse can we get that verse where he says that he should be taught to pray before we shall come back to this one but i want the other one fast where is he let him pray that he may either preach come on now it's right there brother just go back up i want to finish up this issue of the times because i realized that many of you didn't have proper understanding of it okay verse 30 that is what that what happened okay god bless you for joining in uh all right verse 13 he says wherefore let him speak it in an unknown tongue pray [Music] so now remember this one is in the context of the white of the church are you following me yes so in the church and there is no interpreter then let that butter do what let that bother you please read what the bible says let that brother keep silent in the church don't be fast let that brother be silent in the church because there is no reason why you are talking times when those times cannot be interpreted you should speak terms which are going to be interpreted and it should fight the church you understand yes but now i've spoken today and that was in the prayer tomorrow then there's going to be what should i be advised to do why should i be advised to do saints to pray that i may have [Music] forever have no meaning if they're spoken in the church it's just like you're giving a testimony in english when no one is understanding english in the church it should be interpreted your testimony is good right but no one's understanding it's not making sense all right now and then you should be told you should be part in the church and even when you go at home you must never pray with thanks anymore amen amen amen hey brother buddy is that me you should be trying that you should not speak in times in the church and also when you go at home and anywhere you are you must always hold your face because you are not in that really ghost time so brother sister keep science don't drop hands amen [Music] speak to himself which means you are not there you don't have interpretation right so how many are spoken to themselves and people when they're in their prayer services oh when your prayer closes ah i mean you've spoken thanks all right to yourself unto god wow wonderful praise the lord we have one here where's how another one we here we're almost twenty and only one person president are we spiritual yeah look allow to give the brother all these gifts they don't belong to the devil they belong to the children of god that's why they are in the bible therefore you pass arrest them because the devil fascinated the the the money does not mean that we should allow him to take all the money [Laughter] simply because money is misused out there does it mean i should be humble i should get children i should use the trade only because money is evil money is not evil very good very good one if you have not seen it find it if you want it you can ask i will give it to you only that you may not understand his english very well but he talked about three users of man he said okay the summer title is the use of money and he was saying that he read the scripture right about oh i'm not going to go now into the desert i will grant you to that but my point was that we sometimes demonize the things from god simply because they are misused outside you do not demonize money because you misuse the outside god can use money bless your life and for you to place many other people's minds and for you to start game right and also the devil will give it to his children to misuse it and they will use it to do other bad things so the devil has made these people misuse that actually some of them even train samples how to speak times they train huh can we have children please can you be quiet if you can't be quiet you with another one so excuse me so we find out that even times can be used not only to edify the church but to bless us if don't worry about fear of strict terms because you can't interpret when you are wrong and you feel the anointing you know sometimes you know when i would preach you'd say oh i feel like speaking in tongues and he wouldn't speak it because maybe he's not giving he knows he doesn't give you that prayer but are you there when he's in his prayer closet maybe when you go there you call him a pentecostal so friend don't think don't give it to peter questions believers speak times and repeat with me believers speak times don't begin saying this is a believer's thing hallelujah to an extended unbelievers when they hear that this after the question who told you that believes that for better prospects he said that we speak with neutrons and here you say he said your son shall follow there that happened let me read in my name with the new times not random english they shall speak in new times and if they drink they live in the child they shall take up suffers and they do not hurt them hallelujah so friends from today i want you to be open-minded whatever the holy spirit will let you do maybe you've got to be praying alone and you feel like something is coming and you don't understand it let it out and see what will happen the day speaking times will come and give me a decimal and say you know what i felt like i've never felt before and who knows the lord the lord will train you that word that you will be able to speak those things in the church and give the interpretation of someone else give the interpretation and those times will be a blessing to us hallelujah there is a brother and he attends service with us here on zoom i don't think he's here now uh you've heard me talk about him many times his name is charon this brother believed in one of our meetings at brother peter's church in kenya and uh in one of those meetings there uh i i i wasn't actually in knowing that he was it was him but i came because he was also preaching and then this brother came up and he was so much and waited and he started to speak in tongues and as he spoke in times you know uh the holy spirit came on me so heavily there was an immense move of the word speaking that church at that time everybody was quiet and groaning in the spirit of running you know but but the bible says that sometimes their spirit comes to us that you can't even you know what is that those are even times you know i don't know if that's ever come to you [Music] yes so that's how the chat was that kind of breeze of the holy spirit and then it was today and nobody was so heavy and then he had finished preaching and he was talking about the seven seals and then this brother was there at the outer praying and praying and he was just bowing down there and then the body was fell on him and he stood down and speak me in times he spoke for like one minute and then in a moment you know as he was finishing like this i i just failed to move forward and give the interpretation i was about to pass force with the interpretation i can even at that moment still remember the three or two words i was going to speak out first and before i added those words out then there's another brother you know who was playing with the kid the guitar he was hiding in the playing slowly and then he stood up before i did and then he took up his rocket guitar in the sky or whatever and he started yelling crying oh my tell me you talk about the anointing of the holy ghost talk about the anointing of the holy ghost was a meeting and you know what i should fall and i gave the test that the testimony i told them brethren this is gone i told the church i was just about to give the interpretation and this brother gave the exactly that person i was going to give and i told the people that i am now another witness and the bible says by the word of two or three witnesses i watched the best of this do you remember that moment he was there he was there so friends you also despise the gifts of god each of you must know what part of that body you are praise the lord okay we went so far we went so far i don't know whether we shall be able to go back where we stopped or maybe we just closed where have we been we have we only have about a few minutes where have we been where are we going to get here can someone help me find me god bless you we were right there we're talking about getting into getting into that spirit so friends maybe the holy spirit wanted us to get to well as far as this because you have to get into the spirit even short times you have to get into the spirit of talking times even to say the obligation to the spirit of i'm saying when we get into the spirit of singing you will notice that people who sing as if they are all the people they will no longer sing like that in you they will now sing with video strength and you understand ah once we are done with ourselves i'll put for you some services of some other believers and you'll see how they worship the world and you feel like oh god i just want to watch it like the others because if we are going in the same heaven i wonder if others should act another way and we also should act another way you know unless we act the same way then we can now celebrate the same heaven yes you have a question because if you never can personally yes i it's possible that never can impersonate the one but and impersonate the life of christ what's the difference between the life of christ and the one okay when we said a word we made a written word we made a written word and jesus when he was here on earth that here is how i can be able to explain for you the difference between the life of jesus christ and the one when jesus was on earth here is what he said he said that if you don't believe that i am he you will die come on help me now if you don't believe that i'm here you will die in your sins what was it trying to say he was trying to show them that he was the word but now made manifest because remember we have the word that is not yet manifested and a word that is manifest now we have the written word and we have the written letter of the spoken word and the manifested word now jesus christ he was already in the written word the books the scrolls which they had and to ask a son is given a child is given a government shall be upon his shot as isaiah 96 right that was the word also but that work was not yet manifest and that one was speaking up of jesus the same jesus who was now before them they believed the written one but they never believed they manifested anyone and refusing to believe the manifested word is automatically disqualifies you as a believer that's why jesus has told them search the scriptures so in them you think you would have been like meaning you cannot receive eternal life from those scriptures if you reject me the manifested one in this hour that's why when we talk about the blood of jesus and by the bananas use these phrases maybe you will now understand them when he say the bleeding one have you read that before yes you see what does this mean can we now say that the the word is bleeding is you're carrying all of each of your bibles please are they bleeding so what does it mean by the believing one huh listen to this in the invisible union of the body of christ what is sin sin is unbelief amen standing ready think your gum is washed by the water of the bleeding one the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word believing the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be watched from the future of god's prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water by the way that makes your mind and the heart stay on god and on his wow now what's the bleeding one jesus christ was here and he bleeded of course on the cross that was the word bleeding right yes but that word has been bleeding since that time until today how meaning that one is fresh in every generation so what is the breeding word in every generation what's the breeding word of this day it's the word of the hour the french word the french revelation of god that is sent by the messenger of that generation because there were seven stars in the hands of jesus by the messenger of that generation that word it makes that word to bleed again in that generation for our salvation if we reject that word of the hour it we are as good as dead you remember he said that if you stay under that word if you stay under the arata revelation striking after revelation you must receive the holy ghost why because that word is no longer just the one it's just it's the bleeding one it's not like the pentecostals are preaching it's the bleeding one that we are receiving in this generation which is the revelation of the word of god in this hour of believing like the power of noah that one was the believing one of that time never received what laura said had received the bleeding one at that time paul eating one he's what he's messing with the bleeding one all down all through the edges there was the breeding wonderful generations now today we have the bleeding one others can receive it but they are only receiving the bible they do give it to me they are receiving a book but it is not greedy but for us we have received not only the word but the believing what because it has life in it if there is no blood upon that word it has no life to save the only power that can say is that black upon that word which has been powered out in our generation so every nation will have that word so rather in conclusion to your question that is going to be written there is written word and spoken word or rather a written word and a manifested one the one which is in the book and the one which is made manifest so you can you can believe that you can have you can believe everything you you want to you cannot recover from from there from the genesis revelation you can know everything from episode but that doesn't give you the holiness that doesn't give you eternal life so in other words you must have the life of the giver the life is the holy ghost not just the knowledge of it but the life of it because there are some people who even preach you know when you receive the message you have received when it goes no when you he said when you receive the word you are entitled to receive it it doesn't mean you have automatically received it when when paul came to them he said that in revelation chapter 19 what did he tell them yes [Music] since my brother says you believe what does it mean that when you believe that you receive the holocaust when you really believe that you are believers huh do you have a belief so in other words you can receive the word but not received the one that goes is the life of the world there is a there is a uh there is a the dynamics and the mechanics the mechanics is what the understanding of the scriptures what we are doing now this one agrees with this one and this one and even here you understand yes we are studying but that is only mechanics it doesn't give you life until you have mechanics you get into the spirit of the mechanics because the spirit with which the mechanics for the teaching or the understanding of the one that comes is also the holy spirit and that word will then bring and make you as soon as you enter into the spirit of it you will receive the life of it now the life is the holy spirit which the bible says you are whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption and there are many believers who are not going to receive the holy ghost and they will remain going in what in the tribulation why did why did the fridge is going in in heaven it's not only about many good people even if you're a good person and you believe the message it's not enough you must receive that life you must receive the holy spirit it's a must if you don't receive that holy spirit you will not know when the rapture when the rapture trumpet that's why you need to receive also the life of your wife i think that's very clear yes in the name of saying that okay but that was you remember the word you receive it by right here because how can you have faith without the holy spirit convicting you it is the same holy spirit which was which was their justification which was their sanctification which will be there at maximum of the holy spirit baptism is exceeding god is accomplished with you you are now a full package now he's packaging packages ready for the rapture this one is ready you understand but there are many others still working on in the other procedures in their processes if others are slow and they are not working with them properly and they are still on the line of the holy ghost but they are not in the package therefore they don't go only because they're not ready but not because they were not good mate so you can get good material you can have the horribles not as in when we said that they had oil and they all listened to this ran out the revelation they had of the one was not enough the the life that they had within them was uh was that it was not the life of christ but somehow somewhere they never because they remember these people they had to go out and do what by what the oil how do you receive the oil today and that's the question now that it will come to can you receive the oil today without buying it every generation has sellers who are given the right by the right government to sell you shame you can get a uh order and begin saying here petrol it will imprison you immediately because you don't have the license so there are people giving renaissance to buy and sell that way they are bought from god and with the only one we know in every generation is that messenger in the hand of god jesus christ he sends him and john runs to this angel and he picks the book that book i can also say it's the same holy spirit it's this old time holy spirit and the devil what god near it that's the reason people fear me but it's good enough for me give me that give me that wait is that all time give me that and all of those who were in the generations before us they must update their faith like those of of after 19. when they receive that message how can you tell me that you have received the word i mean you have received the holy ghost when you reject the word if it is not possible right you have to receive the work for you to say you have the holocaust and also you have to receive what it was for you to say you you have the word otherwise what you have is just so important but not the word because the word must be the light so it is all in that range so i think i've answered your question brother i've enough for them their spirit was quenched and the bible says question of the holy spirit how do you question we keep on receiving when you are saved you are still forever you are similar to the day of your redemption but yes you keep on getting refilled every time but you are saved until the day of your redemption king's soul king saul at that time we are talking about the old testament before even the blood of jesus christ was shed but he was unearthed and king's soul never went to hell yes he went to hell to remember when psalm came prophet samuel what did he tell you what did he tell him you will be with me today so they were in the same place and that place was called was called raise up your his brother paradise that place was called paradise so they were in paradise together even saul went to paradise so we went to paradise he was with the prophet samuel so when jesus christ went you also picked him so i'm sure i would sit by the soul when i get up here hallelujah so because remember that was before the bleeding blood of christ was shed on the cross so i'm sure he was part of the receive all right another thing is hard for you to understand hallelujah came running to david with a with a crown claiming that saul was dead why did david did he killed him why did he kill him because he loved him really because of the love what lovely do you have for him i think it was because that soul was god's anointing what are you talking about so it was awaited by god today's anointing is the holy spirit he was seeing it so he can ask how dare you rejoice on the death of godzilla why he killed this boy he killed you so so so yes i know whenever we preach about you we preach to him or the negative but that does not mean that god is pattern can be broken if the man was sealed and anointed you will see i am still safe i am sealed by the spirit divine oh glory to god hallelujah amen i am jesus and i know he's mine where are they they are underneath the blood on the cross of calvary as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of god's forgetfulness it's good enough for me praise god my sins are good praise god praise god the devil comes and tells you that you are a sinner blah blah blah but what happened with him he said well i don't know i don't even know where your sins are i've never seen them i'm not saying you're a sinner so don't tell me that there is not a type of astronomy i mean soul if you did those things that is how you are today many times you you know god does not know the sins of his loved ones because they don't see a child of god cannot see so what do mistakes do and i'm not telling you please you have our license to go and busy the bible says it is impossible for some for those who were once enlightened have been run from the you know the sims of the world and the things i've been seeing the light of christ to fall away from it it is impossible to renew them back again so don't go and say ah let me go like soul i will also be our pleas you must know who you are and you must reflect the life of who you are praise the lord allow me to conclude because if i don't conclude your questions are endless so uh we are going to finish patmos vision today whether we like it or not and i'm not continuing to discuss the details because we have already and i'm sure that whatever you have not understood you have given me the questions and most of it i've answered here others are answer it when you bring it but i think we have had a good discussion on this spirit yes and that has been a good highlight for the apartment's vision now in the fashion special many by the panama clicks on john being on the isle of patmos he also speaks on the lord he said because this is a very important part also it brings in a doctrine of the sabbath we didn't deal with with this about last time so we realized that what is our sabbath uh means rest so what is our rest somebody's rest so you must receive the holy ghost in order for you to go to the rapture if you don't receive the holy ghost you will not go to the rapture i'm sorry if it's bad news but you have to if you have not received the holy spirit you just go get closer with god and ask him to feed you the holy ghost read the word read the bible and love jesus he will give you the holiness there is no reason why he shouldn't give you the holy ghost and also be baptized in the name of jesus christ whatever you feel that is a hindering view to receiving the one good do it and take it out of the way because the prophet advises us not to let anything be in the way between us and him and the lord so whatever it is that is getting in the way of you receive the out of the way and allow him to feel you praise the lord all right so we know that our son at rest is is there is the holy spirit okay so i think that is just about it for the atmosphere of course he explains verse by verse from verse 1 verse 10 and that part i think you have read it by yourselves uh we also talked about the golden lamb stance i think there's a sister who talked about it and she enabled us to discuss little bit i think it was on wednesday yeah so we did talk about that as well i want to go in it i i started reading that was it you was it you that was researching about it the golden lampstand was it you reading something on the computer in your office you're trying to extract the first number oh that was good but run it with me before you post it yeah that was but i saw the information it was nice but you can still run it with me i can just approach through okay uh that was nice um uh and by the way whenever the brother occurred across something how many or how many have their what's up acting right up here is active please we have about 10 people there whatsapp is active when the brother process on whatsapp um sends information about the meetings and about this uh you know now is even you see is it it's not sleeping it's trying to find something for you you know you post you just keep quiet as a as if you have not we should not be like pigs friends people just listen for [Music] they meet when they are there they cannot talk even so when you receive it sure that you have to see it put it up if you don't have nothing to post which means you are sharing it on other only platforms you should make a use of this i'm still waiting to see those people who are going to be the leader when i say very active there is getting delivered though this is getting because whatever you are trying to hear you are sharing with others but if you are out there very quietly okay we talked about the seven-fold glory of this person did anyone understand that part the seventh is the glory the second the second fourth glory of the person the seventh glory for the glory of jesus christ how how he's manifested as uh from his ear whereas everything had a meaning at a a place you know and uh his eyes as fire his feet as brass his uh is the right hand uh where seven uh he had seven stars in his right hand and the two edited sword you know everything had a meaning and you you were able to go through that while you were reading his face like the sun so i think we have concluded uh the patmos vision is there anything that we have not talked about and that you have not asked here that you thought should be dealt with anyone before we bring this to across since the agnes if you do not have the church edge book people here are very busy reading the church edit book and they have finished now the practice video which is the second chapter yes brother charlo i can see you are late i have just given you testimony a few minutes ago and i think you'll go back and see it i don't know if i i would like the details very well but uh i think you'll be blessed by that now i think [Music] all is covered you there's something which was not covered in the revelation of jesus christ for you but was that question asked here in the questions that i have and rather pray uh pray for pastor from dublin in ireland i've already told him that we are having these meetings and i've asked him to prepare to be with us in one of the meetings we've not yet agreed on which date but i believe if not this week probably next week we shall have him either on a tuesday on a friday so we shall have him and uh i'll let you know by by wednesday i think tomorrow i'll let you know i think i shall i should have already found out where you can have you so just pray over it and uh send me the questions you really would like him to deal with i have some here and if you have more that you'd like him to deal with but you make sure your question is detailed sister personally i love the way you ask your questions make sure your question is detailed not only one line make it detailed so that it can make sense to the person with answers okay so uh what's your question here is saying that absolutely okay wait 40 okay what does it say the last two lines okay you can read it but also speaker then we need to return leaving his bride in his father's house while he makes himself known to his brothers at this very very time the ant christ that the jews have led with trump but may wanted this first day this last day tonight but he will leave his bride in the father's house does it mean that jesus christ will come by himself i thought at first i thought maybe he would send that prophet like and as we live the type of joseph there is one more thing i want to bring to your attention about this end time you record as joseph stood there before his breath and when benjamin was not with them he spoke to one in that return is that the part oh i'm sorry i'm reading 41. for three and one half years while the retributive wrath of god is powered out she will be in the great marriage supper of the lamb then will he return leaving his bride in his father's house where he makes himself known to his brethren and when i really try to show you that jesus will come by himself yes but i thought he will is going to make himself known to his brethren how through the ministry of moses and elijah because right now he is making himself known to us but is he a physical he is not here physically he is with us through this world of the hour and so uh but also at the end of the three years and the heart because remember when jesus christ leaves and calms down on this earth he is going to take this world into a whole new time and this is going to be the millennium uh can you go to one two three now these 144 000 are not in the bright in revelation 14 4 they are called vaginas and they follow the lamb woods wherever he goes the fact that they have not defiled themselves with women show that they are units of matthew 19 22 the 12th the eunuchs were the keepers of the bridal chambers they were attendants notice that they do not sit in the throne but are before the throne and these are the ones by the way he is coming for okay now no they are not in the bride but will be in the glorious millennial ring now what i'm talking about because your question that you are you've just asked is in connection to the 144 thousand views right there are many things that are not answered to us about the 144 percent jews and you'll find every preacher trying to preach it the way it is revealed to them because that is the jews but everything that we as genders need to know from how we live here to where we go in the in the in the marriage to when we come back we know okay yes but we need to come to this one another reporting somehow some questions are unanswered why because he deals with the jews as a nation and that does not have anything to do with us nonetheless because we will talk about a question for example like a the 144 thousand where exactly do they live to go into the millennium because remember while the bride is in the millennium where are they they're here on earth receiving oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i shouldn't have said why the bride is in the name but while the bride is in the modern supper of the lamb because the millennium is the space of a thousand years on the earth what are the secrets of events because some of you are looking at me as if you are confused right now we are at the ending of the gentile dispensation i've recorded videos on the gender dispensation and i'm going to play the first one tomorrow until you enter on wednesday in our service so please don't miss it okay now my my my issue is that right now we are at the ending of the gentile dispensation and this will once it ends and how does it end it ends when the millennium oh i love the millennium that's what i'm talking about all the time it ends when the marriage suffer of the lamb or when the rapture then the general dispensation ends so we are at the time sister fortunate when the gentile dispensation is about to end are you following me yes when it ends it ashes in the rapture the rapture suddenly will actually the tribulation the contribution of this act first of three years and a half remember the three years and a half is the time which was which was previously remaining on the 70 weeks of daniel because there was one week which was remaining but this one week when by the time jesus was cut off he had already ministered three years and a half on half so the ministry of jesus on earth for three years especially three years and a half was a period of what we call the three years and a half was the half of the last week of the seventh weeks of daniel are you following me are you understanding what i'm saying when we say 70 weeks of daniel we made 70 weeks of years and uh when he was preaching on this i told people to say one week is equal to seven years so can you all say it one way is equal to so now when you say 70 weeks it means seven weeks old yeah multiply that by seven then you get the total number of years these were supposed to be how did he get it you can read daniel chapter nine danielle got this in a vision as he was praying and crying and praying for the people of jerusalem see that that is remaining the time that is remaining for the with the people of israel until the millennium and from the rebuilding of the 10th of jerusalem up to the millennium and that time started when the temple of solomon was debuted from the going forth of the beauty of that temple you remember the river was the one italian during the other king and they reviewed that temple and from that time the years started counting counting counting by the time jesus christ came they had remained seven years i know there are people who say no no no the last week is supposed to start after the rapture no the last week already started when jesus first came on earth and that last week remember is how long seven years and when jesus started his ministry that last week also started and when he did when the messiah was according to daniel says cut off where the messiah was cut off and when was he cut off after how long his ministry three years and a half now that period of three years and a half took the last half i mean the first half of the last seven years of god dealing with the jews and the gentiles we are now brought in from nowhere and we are put inside here between the space of the first half and the last half so for us we are placed in between here by grace we don't deserve it but by race we don't even know how many are going to be saved among us but they just know our men we don't even know how long we have but the jews know how long they are the only thing is that that time now is paused but soon it will be replayed when after the rapture then their time will be resumed and it will continue to count and it will be remaining three years and a half and that's three years and a half that this space will be when god calls the bride she goes in the rapture then this this uh after the rapture the three other allah starts to play that one will be when now the messiah will go back to the jews and he will make himself known to the jews through the two witnesses now the bible says he also comes down and he meets them he meets them remember the bible he says when he was coming down he came with tens of thousands of these saiyans but they were behind him as he rolled ahead of them those ones who were behind him are his bride we were coming with him but actually he came before us so it could be that he introduced himself to them that during that time of his coming but that was at the end of the three year and a half which also is the is the time of the end or the the end of the war of armageddon which is the third world war after that special time when he comes down he is because when he comes down they will want to kill him you imagine these people the powers that will be at the at that time they will think they can destroy the messiah they will see they can destroy christ the king of kings that's when they will realize that they cannot kill the god of the jews because that will be the god of the jews he will be defending the jews fighting for the jews and by the time that he has they can't kill he will consume all of them and this this world as we know it this earth as we know it will all be different this act as we know it we know it the civilization of that world will all be different because everything will be will come to an end people will die and they will remain dead until the end of the millennium one person asked me a question so if these people will die and they will remain lead until the end of the millennium what are we going to rule over because the bible says we are going to rule over did you know that we haven't ruled over people in the millennium you did not know you thought you were going to be in a lonely planet how can he accept us to be in our own planet where the devil's children are ruling over us in a plan where we have very many of us it must be a repeat of events that will be the king these are the kingdoms of them of man yeah but that will be the kingdom of our god remember that would be the stone which came and hit the other image and the image went into pieces it will be the kingdom of our god the bible says the kingdoms of the world have become the kingdom of our god of jesus christ hallelujah so now that would be the millennium there will be people on this earth of course there will be a few remnants who will escape the judgments of god during that time and they will report of course the people here who are very intelligent they even build bankers where you cannot cannot kill them they will come out and they realize that well they even have active movies out of it the world is different everything is new that will be the time when they realize now there is another kingdom on earth and they will realize that karemwa don't don't miss the millennia because if you miss the millennium will you remain in the grave and trust you shall enjoy here anyhow hallelujah and another time when we come out and we start ruling over them and i'm telling you i can continue on and on but what i can say is that will be a momentous marvelous time and at that time then the bible says then that of course there will be the war of of uh gold and marble broken mother would be the nation that will will be the superpowers on at that time that they will be uh they will be deceived by the devil because remember for a space of a half for the space of a thousand years that where was the devil bound where in the potential speech for espresso a thousand years a millennium bite you know what let us go and consume this city we shall have a city on this earth a real city it will meet the eternal city of god which job of europe to fall did to attack this city the devil will deceive them because he will not know that this is an eternal city fire will come from heaven if you consume all these people and then the bible says tables will change then there will be a terrible set there will be him the king of kings the lord of lords together with us to judge the living and the dead which means the dead shall rise there will be now the mass resurrection which i've called the third resurrection the masses that everyone that has ever lived will resurrect even those who die in the previous condition they resurrect they will all stand before the the the jab their bride is not going to be in this judgement their bride will not be joined this is the word from judgments you have people say every one of us will say we stand before you no the brain will not stand before him the brain will be with him because our judgment is here today today here today so at that time we shall be the one judging together with christ and then these people while they are there trying to to to you know to come and talk about themselves you know the fruits virginia will also come the other jews who are not a part of the 14400 will come and the other you know all the other groups of the world will come they will be judged how be completely upon christ and his bride and then after the one thing you know of course before their judgment they they all said that this happened the first prophet and they therefore were cast in the lake of fire and all these people who will be judged to be condemned will be also cast in the same place and after that you know balabanon says this hell is not a tunnel god will do away with it maybe it will burn for a billion of years but then it will do i mean i will then be all we have a new heaven and a new ah things will start again from genesis from genesis 1 1. that's where we are headed that's why everybody dies everybody's born dance and we are only waiting for that time we open up that don't think that this is how things are going to continue things will not continue as youtube so no wonder you people who are deciding to sound christ serve him with all your heart because we only have one chance on life to make things right this is the only time we have others have died and have left this one they can't correct anything but you you have time to correct whatever you have made wrong this is the only challenge you have yes correct it once you die it is finished done we sing for your last song you go to your place and you wait for that wait from the end but if you know you are died you are dead in christ don't wait for the wife from then wait for the rapture hallelujah because you will surely
