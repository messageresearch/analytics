[4:10] men who wanted the angels for
[4:12] lasciviousness
[4:17] the only thing that held the fire of God
[4:27] of course we know that Lord
[4:33] really God is friendship
[4:37] with the Lord because as the result of

[6:45] Jesus is still the same yes
[6:57] the Lord is not slack concerning his
[7:00] promise
[7:02] as some men count blackness but as long
[7:05] suffering to us were not willing that
[7:08] any should perish but that all should
[7:11] come to repentance
[7:29] God is
[7:33] concerning his promise
[7:36] hallelujah amen Heaven
[7:39] is going to fulfill it again

[9:52] you can live a life worthy of the Gospel
[9:58] you say that oh these days there are no
[10:01] more virgins
[10:08] sit down there are many young ladies
[10:11] that will not defy themselves
[10:23] because I was one of them
[10:26] and there are many more you two can do
[10:29] it why do you say I've lost it oh he's
[10:32] okay
[10:33] I was already in the world don't you
[10:36] worry brother
[10:40] because you lost it because
[10:46] you never did it in the first place
[10:50] now stand your ground as a Believer
[10:53] and prove to the devil you can live a
[10:57] life
[11:01] the devil will tell you no I made you do
[11:04] it last time
[11:06] I'll make you do it again you will look
[11:09] at him too much
[11:11] time last time I didn't know who I am
[11:14] but now I know I am a son of God
[11:22] [Applause]
[11:24] hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of
[11:27] the Lord
[11:30] let me give you a few samples here and
[11:32] then I'll I'll quit now I want I want us
[11:34] to look we looked at this briefly on on
[11:37] Sunday but I want us to go through it
[11:38] for just a moment Luke 7 3 6.
[11:44] and let's try to be a bit fast
[11:48] I'll be able to complete this now and
[11:51] then one of the Pharisees
[11:53] desired that he would eat with him and
[11:56] he went into the Pharisees house and sat
[11:59] down to meet
[12:00] and behold a woman in the city which was
[12:02] a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at
[12:04] meat in the for his house brought an
[12:07] alabaster box of ointment and stood At
[12:10] His Feet behind his weeping um
[12:13] At His Feet behind him weeping and began
[12:16] to wash his feet with tears and did wipe
[12:19] them with the hairs of her head and
[12:21] kissed his feet and anointed them with
[12:23] the ointment
[12:25] foreign
[12:38] [Music]
[13:25] and so he invites Jesus he didn't wash
[13:29] his feet
[13:37] then he comes a woman
[13:44] with an alabaster box
[13:47] of ointment I mean
[13:52] foreign
[14:13] she was a prostitute Himalaya
[14:17] and she's coming close to the master yes
[14:21] Jesus yes the Holy One
[14:25] with her prostitution
[14:28] you might say with hospitals
[14:33] and she begins to touch his feet
[14:35] and closing her eyes
[14:39] don't think that she would have got
[14:40] tears out of her eyes without closing
[14:42] them
[14:45] I wanted to imagine that scene
[14:48] a prostitute
[14:51] no doubt she was dressed like one
[14:53] another crazy
[14:56] and she came with this perfume
[15:00] was so you know luxurious
[15:05] and it comes on the feet of Jesus
[15:09] and begins to close
[15:13] foreign
[15:17] [Music]
[15:19] and began to caress Jesus
[15:24] as sacral's eyes produced here
[15:30] this was not a spiritual sight
[15:43] what is Jesus Christ
[15:48] if it was like in our generation
[15:54] the news at 10 or massage
[15:58] A Man Called Jesus
[16:24] and you wouldn't doubt those news
[16:28] foreign
[16:57] foreign
[17:14] and the tears and wiped them with a hair
[17:17] overhead and kissed his feet um
[17:26] it was only the tears and the hair
[17:29] cutting cutting again
[17:32] but even without feet full of makeup
[17:36] [Music]
[17:48] we also understand
[18:07] oh my God
[18:11] foreign
[18:29] would have known that which kind of
[18:31] woman what man of woman this is the
[18:33] touch is
[18:44] Jesus knew yes when Jesus told you he
[18:49] knew you yes
[18:50] don't worry about the opinion of anybody
[18:54] he will serve you regardless of what
[18:58] anybody
[19:00] amen
[19:02] he will serve me
[19:04] of anybody's thoughts I am on my way to
[19:08] heaven because he served me
[19:13] amen
[19:15] praise the name of the Lord
[19:17] Jesus answering say down to him yes
[19:34] the one old 500 Pence and the other 50
[19:37] and when they had nothing to pay he
[19:39] frankly gave them both forgive them both
[19:42] tell me that for which of them will love
[19:44] him most
[19:46] and Simon answered and said I suppose
[19:48] that he to whom it was he forgave most
[19:51] and he said unto him thou has rightly
[19:53] charged and they and he turned to the
[19:54] woman and said unto Simon Says doubt
[19:57] this woman I entered into thine house
[19:59] thou gavest me no water for my feet but
[20:02] she has washed my feet with tears and
[20:04] wiped them with hairs of her head thou
[20:06] gave us me no kiss but this woman since
[20:09] the time I came in has not ceased to
[20:12] kiss my feet my head with oil that is
[20:14] not annoying but this woman has anointed
[20:16] my feet with ointment wherever I say
[20:19] unto thee her sins which are many are
[20:22] forgiven
[20:24] for she loved much but to whom little is
[20:26] given the same life as little and he
[20:28] said unto her thy sins are forgiven and
[20:30] they started meet with him and they got
[20:32] to say with him thereof themselves who
[20:35] is he this that forgiveth sins also and
[20:38] he said to the woman by sins as thy
[20:40] faith has saved thee go in peace
[20:43] and Jesus was trying to show yesterday
[20:46] that this woman is sins we are too much
[20:50] and she appreciated Christ more
[20:55] let me tell you Church
[20:58] if we have a church
[21:00] people that have truly met God
[21:05] be having been Sinners
[21:08] during worship you will not find a
[21:12] statement you will not find people just
[21:14] there
[21:16] singing for singing
[21:19] you will find people worshiping
[21:25] Jesus
[21:29] you'll find people lifting up their
[21:32] house without
[21:50] his interest is with the sinners
[21:55] do we have some Pharisees here one of
[21:57] America
[22:02] do we have some Sinners here
[22:10] she wasn't caring what them Pharisees
[22:12] was saying
[22:16] I entered the spirit and I began dancing
[22:21] the sister will see me
[22:32] look at me having a full of myself
[22:39] let me tell you we're not a former
[22:41] church

[22:45] praising Hallelujah
[22:49] because we don't care what the Pharisees
[22:52] are saying foreign

[23:32] feet and say

[30:16] unto him and he sat down and told them
[30:18] and the scribes and the Pharisees
[30:20] brought unto him a woman taken in
[30:22] adultery and when they have said to her
[30:24] in the Middle East they say unto him
[30:26] Master this woman was taken in adultery
[30:28] in the very act now Moses in the law
[30:31] commanded us that such should be stoned
[30:33] but what says Thou this they say
[30:36] tempting him that they might have to
[30:37] accuse him but Jesus scooped down and
[30:42] with his finger wrote on the ground and
[30:43] as though he had them not so when they
[30:46] continued asking him he lifted up
[30:48] himself and said unto them he that is
[30:51] without sin among you led him first cast
[30:54] a stone at her
[30:58] Pastor you're defending a sinner
[31:04] [Music]

[31:20] it being convicted by their own
[31:22] conscience

[38:12] are you God or something
[38:14] I said no I'm not I'm not a city but I
[38:17] am his servant
[38:18] and if God reveals to me things about
[38:21] your life
[38:26] are you willing to accept it
[38:28] he said if it is the truth Allah
[38:32] are you willing to accept Christ as
[38:34] yourself
[38:40] telling him the story of his life
[38:43] and it was very difficult
[38:46] you know especially when you you deserve
[38:49] something and then somebody can say no
[38:51] and then they make an issue out of it
[38:56] God gave me Grace
[38:59] but then as I as I spoke to him and I
[39:04] began to show him how he was a perfect
[39:07] and how he doesn't want it
[39:12] that he has people that are pushing him
[39:15] into this kind of life
[39:18] and at that moment he broke down I'm in
[39:22] your car and tear started coming out of
[39:24] his eyes Okay and the more details that
[39:27] I had given him
[39:28] the Holy Spirit
