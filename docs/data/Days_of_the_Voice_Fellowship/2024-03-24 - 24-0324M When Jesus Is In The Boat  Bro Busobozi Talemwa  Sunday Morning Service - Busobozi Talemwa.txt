========================================

not in you know dogmas and I'm telling you that you know he has been before us and many times we worry about our life and right now I know many of you are worrying about your different aspects of your life can I make this personal can I bring you down to your level responding to me you're very quiet brother brother Sam can I bring you down to your level don't you I will not mention name amen right now in your life you wondering how am I going to navigate that area many times the past 11 years of our life marage rather I was looking back several times when my wife told me we do not have food in the house it's not a new thing for tell me that and I looked in my pocket I had no money I looked in another pocket I had no money and quite frankly there is none of you have ever borrowed from I don't believe in borrowing I am I because because borrowing takes away your blessings and I also don't believe in burdening [Music] Believers and so I don't usually do that I'm not saying I've never done it but I'm saying I don't usually do it if I the last time I did it I don't remember but what I have always answered is that God is in control I learn to say that maybe I said it to a few of you who were in trouble because I believe it God is always in control because he on the driver's seat I am not happening by mistake I was not born by mistake even the way I was born I was a winner do you know that that that there are many who wanted to be born at that moment egg of your mother was ready but as as seed came to that egg the many of your brothers and sisters who wanted to be born and they wanted to be born so bad that they R so fast oh praise God but let me tell you you were the only one you are the only one that turned out to be born so you are not here by mistake oh my God we are not here by mistake we are here by design it is not man and woman that determines a child God who determines a child even in all these science what they do it is God who deter it is God who determines a life to be born because he knows all those who are his yes there is serent seed and there is God seed on but I will tell you this the seed of God had to be manifested no matter what nothing could stop the seed of God from being manifested we have even seen children who have been thrown on dust and they almost died but God said no they will not die and he BR them out and and and you know they they rais they were they live and they were raised and they turned out to be great weapons in the hands of and those who just die at four years five years there's something I'm bringing to your understanding life is in the hands of God and it is God who determines life and there is no life that is a mistake and Jesus told the disciples follow me and they followed him and went into this boat and he and and and and and um you know he was in the boat with them he came in here before you where are you in poty he came in there before you where are you in need he came in there before you where are you in worry he came in before you where are you in lack of tution he lacked to he came in there before you I want you to I want you to come to a place of realiz there is no situation you will ever be in that you can say I'm number one to be like actually the Bible even says even Temptations He says he was even tempted with all man of Temptation take First Corinthians with me if you can vers 10 vers 10 verse3 he says there has not temptation taken you but such as is common to man [Music] but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to Bear it I say a faithful God Amen that he has been taken he says there's no temptation that is taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but he says but with the Temptation also make a way of to escape that ye may be able to be it and down here in the Dy of Jesus Christ butam says these these words which are not read very often he says how was it God's blood God has blood how could it be because it was God's creative blood that he created in order to redeem us and he came and lived in the same body that he created therefore he could not God God had to suffer Temptation he had to suffer sexual Temptation he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches and Powers he had to be tempted in reach you had to be temped in Powers don't think you are the first one to desire to have power to desire to be rich to desire you know to have dominions he had to suffer all of that in order to do it he couldn't be as God in spirit he had to be God In the Flesh praise God God couldn't be God in the spirit if he couldn't be God In the Flesh that's why you also are in the flesh so you can go through the fear fness of Trials and temptations so that you can be a time tested tried son and daughter of God the Bible says that they that overcome will sit with him only the Overcomers will sit with him how can you overcome if you didn't fight Hallelujah are you hearing me am I preaching to someone this morning oh praise God there is no way you can sit with him in the seat of the Overcomers if you did not fight and many of us fight but we fight different battles there is a song which says some through the waters some through the fire some through the flood but all through the blood so we go through different Temptations we go through different Trials of these are to purify us but now when you are into that temptation say oh yeah this is mine I am I am in it done I will be like that until I go to the Rapture if you are like that until the Rapture you will not go to the rapture we are in a battle friends we we are in a battle against right and wrong amen we are between right and wrong brother we are fighting wrong and we are seeing right from the word of God maybe to some of you you have sexual battles maybe others you have battles with money when you see money saliva comes down and you know that is your Temptation then you will know that that is what you have to fight and until you overcome it do know you cannot go to the Raptor maybe some of you you being at broken and you're fighting the B of heartbreak until some of you are are saying I will never forgive that person I will never forgive that as long as you are like that forget the Rapture that is your cross to carry the Bible says carry your cross and follow Jesus if yours is unforgiveness you have to come to a place where amen you have to learn to forgive you pray until God brings forgiveness Brother Martin preached a masterpiece on Friday and he titled it whatt it the travail of the Soul until you come to that place where you travail like a mother who wants to give back you cannot say you won't say I have birth pains they will they will they will operate me as long as you are going to become prant you will have Trav you will have birth pains and so the Pains come when you about to bring forth life every one of us must have those B amen we are fighting the Battle of sin amen we are not rested every day we are fighting what are you fighting brother what are you fighting sister maybe you have hatred in your heart and you you just have it some of you have Envy others have jealousy just having jealousy you know jealousy when you feel bad for somebody who has prospered when you feel that someone has got something you feel that it should be yours not theirs that young man to buy such a suit it is not worth it would have been mine you don't speak them open but God sees them no wonder I've spoken them like this if you have ever spoken it was the Holy Spirit has spoken through my mouth don't say that I'm thinking I'm speaking my thoughts the word the word discerns it discerns your heart and it opens it before the Lord but the problem with this many people they don't repent they don't break they have hard heart you with the word hit with the word the more you heit it's as if you're hitting a St no wonder people don't change people have a b people don't people don't have the Holy Spirit people don't change yet preachers preach the what is going on in the church are so hard what brings that because they don't open up their heart but brother every time you open your heart when the word is preached and you welcome it you get pain and sorrow you get sorrow when a child brings you s pain when the time for giving birth is no matter what you do you have to give birth if you will not give birth you will give birth even if say you will not go to the nebor you at home you will give birth even if you're on the road you will give bir when you get that pain you get that pain child must be given most Christians they don't have that birth pain because they don't believe the word presid that pain is bad and it is also it is bad because it is painful but it is good because if you don't get it you can't give birth so when we feel the preacher is hammering us with a word don't walk out out don't feel bad don't close your ears just say Amen you are saying amen but you're like amen amen if it's a jealousy and you know you are jealous and forgiveness and you know you you have you have not forgiven some people in your heart for don't don't just that's not mine when you hear it say Amen Lord help me to forgive help me to to forgive you know this is what happens we all have our own battles we all fight things we all fight situations we are all fighting that's why the Bible calls us Christian Soldiers We Are Soldiers but our our enemy is sin and we are fighting against sin that is why we should love one another come here brother Joseph come here brother all right come come on come up three brothers all right so this brother is fighting I don't know what you are fighting you want to confess on the microphone come here brother come here hold your hands hold your hands you see you see we are right here all of us are fighting we can tell you brother what are you fighting no one is willing to tell us their battle you f whatty your Temptation now we are fighting whatever you fighting brother brother are you sure you don't fight Temptations last time I checked your okay we will not go there so you see fighting now when you begin boxing one another you know you begin now looking at other spoiling this one spoiling and then fighting against you will not overcome the devil has already trapped you but because we are all fighting we should love one another we should come together in prayer don't run don't run down somebody don't speak about them somewhere don't do that because when you do that you you you you are on the side of Satan you are now supporting sat and his agenda but when you hear something bad about a brother come to him tell brother I've had your fighting I've had you st brother is it true say yes brother I sto it was 50,000 me the other time I stole again even the other time brother I need prayer said brother come let us we are going to fast until you overcome but you who is speaking you are also fighting something so you are not better you are only better in the sense that the other one has been discovered the Bible says I didn't find that verse I didn't read it but it says in all points even as we are he went through what you were going through he first it and he overcame it so when you fight it you have to make a decision to overcome it how do you overcome it not once and forever you overcome it daily daily daily and how do you overcome it by Prayer by the word and by your testimony by your life every day is a fight every day is a fight if you want to know that someone is defeated by their temptation those people never pray I'm telling you if someone is living a defeated life they cannot pray they cannot I remember we used to have a family altar every day in my father's house but when my father my father was a priest and when he was defeated by Temptation one day he came back and you know he just went in the bedroom we came for time for prayer the man was not coming my mother had to go thank God for Godly mothers and women my mother went anded him from the and then father we going to pray and he sat in the chair and when he sat there the moment there do what you were doing there you started doing so is that a doing immedi so and first were children who could not wake him [Music] up so my mother was the one you know of course we were but and and my father oh yeah Hallelujah then then let us sing a song my father raised me he was one of the powerful preachers I've ever seen the Temptation got a hold of that's that's the situation he came in [Music] say and that situation continued for some time until much later we discovered what the problem was friends if you don't pray in your home we not talking about pray at church because here you can deceive us some of you are very good no we not talking about that I don't mean the general prayers everybody anointed hallu and then you watch this person at [Music] home doesn't have family alar doesn't read the word at home doesn't have private prayers with God you you are defeated you you you are saying your problem is marriage your problem is not marriage and let me tell you last if you young men and ladies if you're fighting with last you cannot overcome lust with marriage you cannot overcome lust with marriage before you get married overcome the spirit of L because if you don't overcome it with prayer even after marriage it will knock you down so you have to come to a place where you are living Victoria in Christ and then whatever you do will prosper so when we talk about Temptation Jesus suffered all of them but how did he overcome them he was a man of prayer this is the man who would go pray for hours and hours and hours but for us his followers we don't like prayer the devil that's why the devil fight to weaken our prayer life friends I want you to see something that we can't overcome our Temptation if we don't overcome if you don't pray and I trust that you don't leave this here let us go we you know every one of us has a a place you see the pastor you know has a vision for the church he gives brings studies and brings the word of God goes out preaches the evangelist go on the streets where's brother Marin he did a good job with brother the other day God bless you and you know brings the souls and then you know the the uh you know the singers sing musicians and they sing and play everybody but you see there is also for those who have or should have the the calling and the gift of intercession whereby they pray and without that all other departments in the body can we have to have intercessors people who intercede and there are some people who feel that because they interceding for others they are the best and and um so we have even and others who think they have gifts oh they want to begin ruling everybody with their gifts I've seen I've seen people with gifts come up and say well God showed me this you must do it and if you don't do it you Backle there's a woman who came up here one day and that's why we have to have the spirit of discernment and I had too much Liberty I don't know whether we are now streaming because some some things I don't see when we so so um now I will reduce what I wanted to tell you so this woman came up and then she told me you know what Pastor God has revealed to me that I should go deeper and deeper deeper and deeper but I want God has told me that you have to lead me go to that depth of Prayer lead me deeper in pray I said sister I don't I'm not the Holy Spirit to lead you deeper in prayer God has been telling me I should even leave work I should just maybe maybe stay at church or where do you live I don't know I think she had had an idea that I live near the church so she thought Oh Sister you are you are now an intercessor you should I will support you come I told sister I'm sorry the Bible doesn't tell us to do that even if you an intercessor you have to work and sustain yourself and support the work of God and then she left then came back again Pastor after that someone you preached I I need to go deeper in prayer oh Pastor just lead me you know God the holy spirit is telling me you have to pray with me it has to be you pray with me for some I said I I God the Holy Spirit spoke to you but he didn't speak to me because I already design the wrong Spirit there that's why you Believers have to have designment and then when she realized had when the wrong speed realized I had designed then you know one day she came up said pastor God has spoken to me that now you should um every service every Sunday service you should tell all the people at church they should come at your home and your wife should cook for them something and also they they eat something and this dog of yours lock it up somewhere this is what God is telling you I said well God does not tell you what to do in my home I told her sister that is not God I was very bold with that I had to rebuke her and the moment I did that said sir the next time she wrote sir she didn't even call me Pastor sir God has showed me you have a very wrong Spirit you need deliverance and the last I heard of her she she went to the Adventist I pray God deliv her but these are familiar spirits we to have designment we need gifts Among Us that's why those gifts should be tested you know when you have a gift and and see something about somebody don't walk right to them and tell no you are not their Pastor you're not their Shepherd follow the right Channel maybe I've been praying with this person and as as they pastor and I know they're going through some situation and then God shows you and then you go to them you you you've I told somebody where was the where was it on the breastplate of the priest what was the it was the only way of determining whether a message was from God or from the devil now when you who prophesy oh you who saw a vision and you speaking in the name of the Lord you don't just come to the people and then they say Amen that gift is carried before anybody says amen and they bring it to the high priest who was standing there with those stones and then they would tell him okay now you speak before the and after you speak you know I sawah to repent of this and then if the stones were Qui nobody would ask they would bring ston and kill you a natural death because wrong demon wrong Spirits used you but if it was the spirit of God those stores will begin to sh begin to shine every is gone and then they say amen God has spoken to and today where is the word of God the Old and New Testament and how do we test it the Bible says test every spirit and that's why if you have a gift or a message for to somebody you have to bring it to the pastor's office but don't just spread let it be tested with the word let it be tested fast lest you spread a wrong spirit in the congregation and you cause yourself to be damed praise the name of the Lord and that's why we have to have designment is very important and we see that the gift of of intercession tongu prophecies it is all necessary we need it in the church I said we need it in the church Tong and interpretation of T we need it in the church each of them have their place in the body to for the body to function we need it in the church but how can it come if we don't spend time in the presence and I look like I veed off a little bit know the Holy Spirit never makes mistakes praise the name of the Lord and so I was speaking of Jesus Christ with all that we have gone through and that's why when we go through things he comes to us and he says I know what you're going through I know what you're going Revelation 29 says I Know Thy works I know th tribulation I know your poverty one of you said you are you are poor I know your and he said but you are rich I know but you are rich but you are rich praise the name of the Lord so in other words it's just a state you are in now but as long as Jesus is in the Bo he says I know I know your tribulation I know your poverty I know your sickness I know your trials I know your Temptations I know your weaknesses I know your difficulties what is your problem what is your difficulties and it makes you not serve God in other words he says I know because I can I have been here before I know what you are going through remember I stepped into this boat before you Hallelujah I have been in this boat before you trust me God is telling you to trust me he has been in that situation before whatever situation you think you have been in he has been in it before if you think you poor Jesus was also poor at one time he told the man foxes have where they lay their heads and you know birs have where they they have their the son of man myself I don't even have a bed I don't even have a house so if you're poor Jesus has been there before and he can relate God there was a time when Jesus didn't even have a coin one coin like this I meant to say sister Grace Grace not one coin and then they came they want tax money for tax I don't have looked at Peter now he was not speaking this as Jesus the man he was speaking this as situations bring us to a place whereby we have to recognize the God in us Sometimes some of us have to come to place where you say enough is enough I am no longer going to agree with my situation I don't agree with my situation enough is enough and you begin to prophesy I don't know how many of you ever come to that place let me tell you when you come to that place not mechanically by faith and by the anointing of God upon your life when you come to that place whatever you prophesy over your life will always come to pass and Jesus turned to Peter and he said go and fish the very first fish open his mouth take out the money out that was not a man speaking that was God who knew all things The God Who created the fish The God Who made the fish The God Who made the sea the God who put that money there is The God Who told him go and do that now that same God is in us that same God is in the hallelujah amen he says your life is in my hands just follow me into this Bo I got this follow me and vers 24 he say there arose a violent storm on the sea so that the boat was being covered up by the waves but he was sleeping he was sleeping but there came a violent storm on the sea what happens in your life when there are violent things in your life and you do not know how to sail through I don't know if I'm preaching to someone you don't you don't know how to sail through it you go to your friend will you go to your brother will you go to your mother you know what here's what David said is he that has the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God which made Heaven and Earth and the Sea so he says there was a tempest there was a violent storm but you see he says happy is the man whose help is the god of Ja I don't know about you but my help is the god of Ja my hope is in the Lord my hope is not in money is not in my mother my hope is not in my father amen my hope is in the Lord my hope is not in anybody are you hoping in put our hope in people and when they don't help us we begin to bad mouth them but let me tell you we have to learn to put our hope in go God can never disappoint us when there is a violent storm coming your way you don't know how to make ends me put your hope in God hallelujah amen maybe there is a violent storm of joblessness and you have no job amen put your hope in God I'm telling you by the time I finish in the next few minutes someone here will get a job yes someone here amen will go from one level another because these are not just sayings of the Holy Ghost when there's a violent storm our help is in the Lord which made Heaven and Earth which made the sea and everything there hallelujah hallelujah and he keep his truth forever so everything that was in God he powered in Christ and Jesus while he was in that Bo amen it was [Music] literally my God was 100% man but also 100% God when he walked in that Bo the moment he stepped into that he wasn't alone he was man but it was God also the moment I stepped into this world I wasn't alone I was human being yes but there is something in me hallelujah amen the moment you receive the Holy Ghost and you step you step out into the world the world needs to know oh that's a new man coming you can open doors and you can close doors Hallelujah you have Power Authority because that in you ISAC in man you understand that in you but you see for you to be able to use it you have to come to a place of submission that place of humility Jus without him I can do nothing he put all his hope in God and then that moment he knew he can use all that Au you can speak to your joess you are trouble and you tell it you know what by the end of this month I'm going to have a joke and it can happen it will happen some people the problem that we have they don't know what they want I'm telling we preach it here but they don't practice you you are educated you you've not searched for a job you've not started a company you've not done anything but you're praying now I'm preaching to you you need to exercise your Authority you need to come to a place whereby you speak by that Authority let me preach let me preach to you for a few more moments I come to a close the Bible says all things were made by him without him was not anything that was in him was life and the life was the light of men that is the Christ that walked down here on the streets of Jerusalem this Earth the Bible says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not if the disciples only understood who was sleeping in that Jehovah the creator of the universe he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him why do you think they cried when the violent storm came they did not know who was in the boat with them if you know who is in the boat with you you will not cry when the stor come because you know who is in the B the one who made the se he the one who made the things that are in the se he made the Heaven and the Earth the Bible says all things were made by him oh praise God in him was life in him was life so you can't even fear death because you know life is here he was in the world and the Word was made by him and he came down he condescended down into a level of a human being and he came and slept in the Jehovah sleeping would you believe it if I told you that that Jehovah you wouldn't because you're also not believing this one that you are seeing because you're not believeing the one you're seeing now don't look at me look at yourself that's the one I'm talking about what do you think the Bible says he that is in US is greater than he that is who is that one God who is heh God can I tell you this friend Jesus that Jehovah is in the bo Hallelujah and if we can realize it nothing is impossible if we can realize it nothing is impossible amen is the creator of Heaven and Earth he's the creator of all the riches of the world all the gold and all the silver and the Sea the sea become violent but just laugh when the SE becomes violent just laugh why because the creator of the sea is Right In You Hallelujah but they did not know that's why they cry for you and me when you have problems brother to laugh and pray laugh and pray GL to God laugh and pray tell your neighbor laugh anday because those problems don't know who they dealing with they're not dealing with you they're dealing with jeh God hallelujah amen he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not but I said today we have known him we have known him in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah hallu Jehovah God himself my God praise God he never cease to be God when your problems come he does not cease to be God some people feel like I don't feel like a Believer now how can I be a beli and be this sick because he slept he did not become less of God by the way let me ask was he sleeping or he was faking it let's think about it let's think about it let's be hon was he sleeping or he was faking [Laughter] now this is the Paradox for him to be truly human he was truly sleeping but God the tells me he never [Music] sleeps so God was wide awake while was sleeping God was awake the same God who was in here he was looking at the storm and laughing but Jesus was sleeping so the disciples did not seek The God Who was looking at them that's the same same God that was with them right back in the days of the Red Sea the same God who went behind them and the Bible says through the pillar of fire he looked at the Egyptians and he opened his eyes and he looked at them and by just looking at them their Childs began to Break by looking at them you know the sea dealt so bad with them by looking at them oh praise God that is the same same God the same Jehovah God the Old Testament who was right there in the boat sleeping but he was not sleeping he was right there looking at them looking at the storm looking at them and he saw that they did not have faith he didn't see that I didn't have faith after he woke up he was [Music] sleeping what's happening what is happening the storm so what have you done we don't know we crying hey you don't have faith it wasn't like that it wasn't like that when he was sleeping that was a human being but the the time when he was sleeping God was awake Our God does not sleep your God does not sleep when you are in your trouble he does not sleep when you are sick he doesn't sleep when you in trouble he doesn't when you poor he doesn't sleep when you have no rent he doesn't sleep when you are filled with problem he doesn't sleep he's awake all the time when you being tempted he does not sleep he does not Slumber that God was right there at that moment oh when you have no job and you want a job he doesn't sleep when when you have no tution he doesn't sleep sister phbe don't you think he was right there when you were defending your your paper and you thought you were the one Defending Your no he was right there looking when bad happens and when good happens he does not sleep why God is God and he looked at them while sleeping but also awake and he saw these people why do you think he said they had little fa because they did not believe who was in Hallelujah in other words if they had re what is faith brother what is faith God bless you God bless you faith is a revelation so it was not revealed to them who was actually there and that's why Jesus said you over of little ration why little because they had that little Revelation was their Lord but their Revelation did not pass they thought he was just a good Prophet but they did not recognize he was Jehovah and they said you have little faith and way all that happened the storm came up and everything took place the Bible says and they went and awakened him saying Lord rescue and preserve us we are perishing and you know that I I love I love some scriptures here this is the faith they didn't have and let me give it to you psalms 27 some trust in chariots some in horses but we remember the name of the Lord in Colossians colians 3:17 says whatever you do in word or deed All In the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to the father by him whatever you do in what all in what in the name Philippians 210 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth things the and that every time confess that Jesus Christ is Lord praise the name of the Lord oh that's what they should have received we should use that name also the little Revelation they had because they knew the name that's all they knew but they did not know who was the the name oh listen to me today we have received the full revelation of who Jesus is those people knew Jesus but they did not know he was the lord of the Old Testament they did not know he was the Jehovah of the they did not know that but we today know that Jesus is Lord but the little Revelation they had they called on him they trusted him they called on him but the Christians of today we do not call on Jesus when we have problems the moment you have problems you sit there go on your phone who can I [Music] call can I call for sure yeah oh I know these people have some money I even saw what they gave in the group know brother the situation is very bad I'm speaking to you now I'm finished please send me 50,000 you would have just saved the whole that my only hope the moment you do that God says oh God is somehow jealous he say all right let let him help you the violent storm came and they were they tried their best until they remembered Jesus but where is he he sleeping Lord Jesus we are finished that's when he woke up but he was always seeing them he had been looking at them using other divine amen D eyes the flesh was sleeping and when he woke up he said you I've been watching you the way you were suffering you didn't even call me and I've been here the whole time the Bible says when you are sick what should you do or when you Afflicted what should you do I want to see a very good Bible reader when good B readers sorry no Bible readers yes my brother the scripture for us which scripture are you reading let us go to the Bible praise the name of the Lord the holy spirit is leading me to speak these things to you [Music] today can you can someone read is is any what let him do what is there any let him now but what do we do may not be Believers but Christians of these days is any Afflicted call your friends and tell them you don't know what I'm going and that one will tell a whole lot of people and then you receive heart breaks out of when you are afflicted pray prayer is very important when you feel you are pray go in prayer don't call people them they don't have your Solutions pray have a night of prayer f and prayer until you feel your heart is now happy and the says now when you are happy don't go and buy when you are now happy sing songs hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and what about when you are sick rush to the hospital is that amen all right continue to verse 14 is any sick among you what should he do let him rush the hospital is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord why don't we get healed we don't believe the Bible that we claim to believe you are sick and you are calling me when you're already in the hospital that's why I will also take very long to come because after all why are you calling me now but if you are sick the first person you should call maybe we go to the hospital I say yeah yeah sure go but other days when she's in the spirit and children get sick she doesn't even talk about hospital she says Dear please lay your hand on my children as man of God I don't go as her husband or as the father of the children she has fulfilled the scripture I will go and lay my hand on the children or sometimes even on her when she's sick let me tell you that prayer always works always works the Bible did not say Pastor have you seen anyone in the church them and even if I find you sick and you don't ask for pray I will never we have to do what the Bible says that's the order of the word you are rushing to the hospital before you even called God has his Representatives on Earth and those are the ministers and that's why Jesus slept and he remained sleeping until the disciples remember [Music] him by the way Jesus is in Theus is in the he said yes let's be in your situation you need to remember Jesus is in the Jesus is in the wake him up and see the miraculous happening in your life that trouble of yours with that storm of your life in the name of Jesus it will calm down it will calm down it will calm down if you need money call on Jesus amen he will give you the money oh God if you are sick call on Jesus amen come down he will heal you praise God Jesus is in the bo I can on this one for months tell is I believe in the of my life Hallelujah the prophet says here sets a lady with a red was on now this is during a prayer meeting and I love it when people believe the angel of the Lord would begin to move in the form of pill of Fire would go and rest on something and then the prophet would begin to see that and then you would see everything about that but it began by the person faith and then here one of them is speaking to this a lady sitting here with a red w look this way sister seem like you are in trouble your husband is sitting there holding you your loved one look here you are suffering you've had some trouble recently Haven you you've been to a clinic Hospital yes you've had an operation listen to detail deta this cannot be a man this was God speaking through the Mind haven't you it was May Brothers May CL is that that right I can see the institution it's happening between you and die it's a GBL operation God went through because that it took the prophet who was on the pulpit and took him to an operation he showed him it is May and then he went down to the operation and then he took him to the operation table and inside the body and he said yes it's a operation is is that right and he said if I am not mistaken because he was just seeing and saying what he's seeing this is a man who went to education up to7 so some of these things he learned while he was at how did he even know so you are seeing a vision but is telling the exact part which they operating and he saying it is and he says you are worrying about it the Holy Spirit takes him from there and he brings him back to the and he tells him about the woman about what is happening now in her spirit you are worried because he even tell him the reason why you see this is not a man I can look at you brother and if I talk to you for a minute I can discern whether you are worried or not but I may not know why okay so this is beyond what this is beyond the designment of spirit this is designment of the heart it has happened three times only in the days of s Abraham in the days of Jesus and then in the days of William designment of the heart that is M sign it declares that the Messiah is here it declares that Jesus is in the and he says you are worried about it about the operation because you are weak and now he says he gives a prophetic declaration rather that's why don't always despise the Bible says despise not proph and he says to her stand on your feet and the woman stands and he says Jesus Christ makes you now and he says to her you are healed don't have no fear and then he turns to the people and he says everybody believe have faith in God believe with all your heart be sure he knows all things do you believe it he knows all things Jesus is in the boat that same thing can happen right here right now and that's what happens every service God designs your life every service tell is happening in your life every
