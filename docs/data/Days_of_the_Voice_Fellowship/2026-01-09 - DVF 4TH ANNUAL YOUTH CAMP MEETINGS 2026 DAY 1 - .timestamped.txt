[0:04] With your power
[0:09] of miracles,
[0:13] there is nothing
[0:18] a simple
[0:23] and we standing
[0:25] here
[0:27] only because
[0:29] You made
[0:32] a way. You made a way.
[0:42] You made a way.
[0:51] Oh,
[0:55] pass.
[0:59] I looked as if it was over.
[1:04] You
[1:06] made our way.
[1:13] Now we're standing
[1:15] here
[1:17] only because
[1:19] you may
[1:23] for a moment just speak to the Lord
[1:24] tonight. Worship his wonderful.
[1:30] Hallelujah.
[1:33] Speak to him your own way in your own
[1:35] words.
[1:39] Hallelujah.
[1:42] He made a way
[1:48] when passing
[1:54] him in the wind.
[1:58] Oh.
[2:24] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:53] That's where
[3:06] You
[3:08] made our way.
[3:15] You
[3:17] made our way.
[3:24] When I bounce against the wall,
[3:29] no
[3:31] words,
[3:34] you
[3:36] make my way.
[3:42] And we're standing
[3:44] here
[3:46] only because
[3:49] you made
[3:52] a way.
[3:53] Just one more time.
[3:56] Oh, you
[3:59] made a way.
[4:06] Yes, you
[4:09] made our way.
[4:16] When I b against the wall
[4:20] and it looked as if it was over,
[4:26] you
[4:29] made our way
[4:35] and we're standing
[4:39] only
[4:42] You made
[4:45] our way
[4:49] and we standing
[4:51] here
[4:53] only because
[4:56] you made
[5:00] our way.
[5:05] Amen.
[5:07] Amen. Praise God.
[5:11] Wow.
[5:12] We are only here because the Lord has
[5:14] made a way for us to be here.
[5:19] I know these preachers you see here have
[5:21] sacrificed a lot to be here.
[5:26] Each one of them
[5:28] and I mean we can speak about each of
[5:31] them what they have sacrificed how they
[5:33] came to be here today.
[5:38] And pastor Michael
[5:41] &gt;&gt; is not a man that uh has been doing a
[5:44] lot of trouble in the recent past.
[5:49] Uh he's a man I got to know when I
[5:51] visited with them in in Path in the city
[5:53] of Path, Western Australia.
[6:00] Australia.
[6:02] He told me he doesn't travel much
[6:06] because of course he's been
[6:07] concentrating on the church there, the
[6:09] work.
[6:12] I can tell you he's doing quite a lot of
[6:14] work there.
[6:17] Currently, they're trying to, you know,
[6:19] get a building of their own.
[6:22] It's not been easy for him to travel,
[6:24] especially during this season.
[6:28] God has made a way for him to be here.
[6:32] We we appreciate it pastor Michael
[6:35] and I know many of you have sacrificed
[6:37] to be here.
[6:40] Let me let me just see if you can be
[6:42] seated. Let the Kenyans remain standing.
[6:45] Those who came from Nairobi.
[6:49] I want you to look at the team
[6:52] that came from Nairobi.
[7:00] Let's really give them a mighty hand.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; Look at look at another Kenyan.
[7:09] I want to say while you are still
[7:10] standing, brethren from Nairobi,
[7:13] we really appreciate your sacrifice.
[7:16] You have been a part of our story from
[7:18] the very beginning.
[7:22] I remember the very first come,
[7:25] brother Isaac who is eventually seated
[7:30] uh was uh one of our camp speakers
[7:35] and I remember also brother Ken.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Do you appreciate these two brothers?
[7:42] Amen. and and so uh and when they came
[7:45] they to the land they said the land is
[7:46] good
[7:50] ever since that first come
[7:54] every year we've had a group from their
[7:56] church
[7:58] and I know I know it comes with a lot of
[8:01] cost
[8:02] a lot of sacrifice
[8:05] and I want to assure you it cannot be
[8:08] for nothing
[8:10] for nothing when you come, you are an
[8:13] encouragement to us
[8:15] and we hope that we are an encouragement
[8:17] to you
[8:21] and I understand there was a few hiccups
[8:23] today
[8:26] on arrival and we regret that we
[8:29] personally I did not know I was just
[8:30] made know made to know that
[8:34] but I can assure you next time we'll do
[8:36] better
[8:38] next time we'll do better thank you for
[8:40] coming let us give them a Amen.
[8:44] Amen. Amen. So we are now going to
[8:46] receive the word.
[8:48] I remember there was a time I was
[8:50] driving from uh some place about 7 hours
[8:54] away from Kala
[8:58] and uh I saw this sermon title that
[9:00] pastor Michael preached
[9:04] and it was something that I was talking
[9:06] about also at church. I said okay let me
[9:09] see how he approached it.
[9:13] And I put put it on. I I was not meaning
[9:16] to listen to the whole sermon. I can
[9:17] tell you that for sure to be sincere.
[9:21] But I listened to all of it. I put on
[9:23] another one for about three sermons.
[9:27] And with all the young people that were
[9:28] in the car, we enjoyed it thoroughly.
[9:32] Every word that was coming out of his
[9:34] mouth
[9:36] was the word. And he wanted to write
[9:39] down. And I was driving. I could not
[9:40] write down,
[9:44] &gt;&gt; you know. So, I I believe we are going
[9:46] to receive a gastronomical jubilee.
[9:52] So, uh so let's let's have this before
[9:54] we go to rest.
[9:57] How many are still under expectation?
[10:00] Amen. And so, let's just open our
[10:03] hearts.
[10:04] Don't close up. Don't don't listen to
[10:06] your mind. You might be tired, but don't
[10:08] listen to your body.
[10:11] Just give it um some time and let the
[10:13] Lord speak to you one more time
[10:17] and then after that we shall go uh to
[10:18] have some rest and then be here
[10:22] uh 6 I think 6 something we'll see the
[10:24] time later 6 something in the morning
[10:27] for the morning devotion brother Ken
[10:28] will be speaking to us.
[10:32] Amen. Amen.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Let us stand as we welcome the world.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Let us sing that one more time. You made
[10:38] a way. body.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You
[10:44] made our way.
[10:51] You
[10:54] made our way.
[10:59] the Lord when our backs were against the
[11:03] wall
[11:05] and it looked as if it was over
[11:10] you
[11:13] made our way
[11:26] Cuz
[11:33] you move mountains,
[11:38] you cause
[11:40] to fall
[11:42] with your power.
[11:51] Heat. Heat.
[12:13] Oh, hallelujah.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:18] Amen. Amen.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; I would like to greet you all in the
[12:22] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[12:23] Christ.
[12:26] I think I have to say that again.
[12:30] I would like to greet you all in the
[12:31] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus.
[12:36] Praise the Lord.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Now that's something now.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want you to know that I'm
[12:45] quite conscious
[12:48] of your tired, weary bodies,
[12:53] your tired minds.
[12:56] And you have every reason to shut out of
[12:58] this service
[13:03] if we are looking in the natural.
[13:07] But because we are not gathered here for
[13:09] natural reasons,
[13:13] Praise the Lord. We have no reason to
[13:16] shut out.
[13:18] How many How many agree with me?
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we are still under
[13:24] expectation.
[13:27] I will not take too much time into uh
[13:30] introductions
[13:34] but I just want to salute the host
[13:39] uh brother
[13:45] want to appreciate him extending the
[13:46] invitation to come.
[13:51] I would want to also take this
[13:53] opportunity to appreciate his wife
[13:55] sister
[13:58] because they say behind every great man
[14:00] is a great woman.
[14:05] Amen. But it's been a blessing to meet
[14:08] with my brother
[14:12] to get to know him
[14:14] and obviously share uh on what the Lord
[14:17] is doing with us
[14:20] in this region and internationally.
[14:24] And so you you you you you share with
[14:26] the brother, you see the vision,
[14:28] &gt;&gt; and it's something that you would like
[14:30] to at least put your shoulder to the
[14:33] wheel, so to speak.
[14:39] And so I count it certainly a privilege
[14:41] to be here.
[14:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. I would like to
[14:47] salute all the men of God that are
[14:49] there.
[14:52] Praise the Lord.
[14:54] And I want to also acknowledge the
[14:55] pastors of the various people that came.
[14:58] Maybe the pastors are not here, but at
[15:00] least members of their churches are
[15:01] here. Want to salute them and
[15:03] acknowledge them.
[15:08] Any one of these men could preach
[15:10] tonight
[15:13] and they could do a better job at it.
[15:18] But it's just fallen my Lord tonight
[15:21] that I say something.
[15:24] And this is that moment when sometimes
[15:27] the leader has to be led. When you
[15:29] attend a convention, you are under the
[15:31] host pastor.
[15:40] When I look at the clock at the time
[15:44] and I understand the circumstances,
[15:48] The Australian training in me is really
[15:50] groaning.
[15:57] Amen.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; But I've had to put all that aside
[16:01] and say we would do what is done here.
[16:07] Amen.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; The book of Luke chapter 15, we start
[16:09] from verse 11.
[16:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. How many
[16:15] are still under expectation tonight?
[16:19] I'm not a long and winding preacher.
[16:28] I usually preach short.
[16:32] And tonight I'm going to preach shorter.
[16:36] But my prayer is that the Lord gives us
[16:39] something tonight.
[16:42] It is good to gather, but it is good
[16:45] when he comes on the scene. Amen.
[16:51] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; If we could just bow our heads for a
[16:54] word of prayer,
[16:57] Lord Jesus,
[16:59] Father, we come tonight
[17:02] and I come the way I am.
[17:06] But Lord, with you all things are
[17:08] possible.
[17:11] I invite you, Father.
[17:13] Anoint thy gift
[17:16] and speak to thy people.
[17:18] Let nothing stand in between.
[17:22] May you break the bread of life
[17:25] in only a way that you can break it.
[17:30] So that as you break it to each
[17:32] individual,
[17:34] may each one of us,
[17:37] have our eyes opened
[17:40] that we may know you in the power of
[17:43] your resurrection.
[17:44] Be thou with us tonight. Give us
[17:47] strength, revelation.
[17:50] May your presence be here.
[17:53] Let everything be done for your glory
[17:56] and your honor. In the name of the Lord
[17:58] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[18:01] Amen. Amen.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; And I want to obviously bring greetings
[18:06] from the church in Perth.
[18:12] The church is called Spoken Word
[18:13] Fellowship.
[18:17] It is a multinational church.
[18:23] I think the last time we counted the
[18:25] nationalities in terms of origin
[18:27] represented in the church
[18:34] I think we stopped at 14.
[18:39] Amen. So, it's a United Nations.
[18:44] We've got believers from the
[18:45] Philippines.
[18:48] We've got obviously being in Australia,
[18:50] Australians,
[18:53] New Zealand is just across the short
[18:55] sea.
[18:57] So we have New Zealanders as well
[19:00] &gt;&gt; and then we have a lot of believers from
[19:02] Africa,
[19:05] South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe,
[19:08] &gt;&gt; DRC,
[19:10] uh
[19:12] I believe there's quite many African
[19:16] people of African origin,
[19:19] but there's one language you speak
[19:22] is the message of the hour.
[19:25] Praise the Lord. Amen. So we approach
[19:27] the word all our flags and everything
[19:31] and places of origin, cultures and
[19:33] traditions go out the window.
[19:42] Praise the Lord. And so I bring
[19:44] greetings from them.
[19:47] Amen. So the book of Luke chapter 15
[19:52] brings a parable.
[19:57] starting from verse 11
[20:00] that can only be found in the book of
[20:03] Luke
[20:05] which is the parable of the prodigal son
[20:11] and I think many of you are well
[20:14] acquainted with it
[20:18] and so you are very familiar with the
[20:21] story
[20:24] and I bring I don't attempt to try and
[20:27] bring anything new.
[20:30] You are a well taught people
[20:34] but we will just remind each other
[20:38] of things that are commonly believed
[20:39] amongst us.
[20:43] Praise the Lord. So Luke 15:1 reads,
[20:50] "A certain man had two sons,
[20:53] and the younger of them said to his
[20:55] father, Father, give me the portion of
[20:58] goods that fleth to me." And he divided
[21:02] unto them his living.
[21:17] And not many days after the younger son
[21:19] gathered all together and took his
[21:22] journey into a far country and there
[21:25] wasted his substance with riotous
[21:28] living.
[21:44] And when he had spent all, there arose a
[21:48] mighty famine in that land. And he began
[21:51] to be in want.
[22:01] And he went and joined himself to a
[22:04] citizen of that country. And he sent him
[22:07] into his fields to feed swine.
[22:19] And he would have fain have filled his
[22:21] belly with the husks that the swine did
[22:23] eat. And no man gave unto him.
[22:34] And when he came to himself, he said,
[22:37] "How many hired servants of my fathers
[22:40] have bread enough and to spare, and I
[22:44] perish with hunger?
[22:56] I will arise and go to my father and
[22:59] will say unto him, Father, I have sinned
[23:02] against heaven and before thee,
[23:13] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[23:16] son, make me as one of thy hired
[23:20] servants.
[23:27] And he arose and came to his father. But
[23:29] when he was yet great yet a great way
[23:33] off, his father saw him and had
[23:36] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[23:40] and kissed him.
[23:55] And the son said unto him, "Father, I
[23:57] have sinned against heaven and in thy
[24:00] sight, and am no more worthy to be
[24:03] called thy son."
[24:12] But the father said to his servants,
[24:15] "Bring forth the best robe and put it on
[24:17] him, and put a ring on his hand and
[24:20] shoes on his feet.
[24:35] and bring heather the feted calf and
[24:38] kill it and let us eat and be merry. For
[24:42] this my son was dead and is alive again.
[24:46] He was lost and is found and they began
[24:50] to be merry.
[25:06] May the Lord add blessing to the reading
[25:08] of his word.
[25:10] You may be seated.
[25:13] Praise the Lord.
[25:15] And so I look at the theme of this youth
[25:19] convention
[25:23] and it says there the generation of the
[25:26] righteous
[25:30] and obviously it takes inspiration from
[25:33] Psalm chapter 14 verse five.
[25:41] But if you read Psalm chapter 14
[25:46] to put verse five in context
[25:52] so that you can grasp the full meaning
[25:54] and significance of the portion from
[25:57] which we have taken inspiration.
[26:05] The Bible reads, "The fool had said in
[26:08] his heart, there is no God.
[26:18] They are corrupt. They have done
[26:21] abominable works. There is none that
[26:24] doeth good.
[26:35] How can they be righteous?
[26:39] When they don't know their God,
[26:42] how can they be righteous
[26:45] when they don't have the faith that
[26:48] there is a God?
[26:52] Therefore, they are fools
[26:55] and act like fools
[26:59] because they lack revelation
[27:03] that there is a God.
[27:06] Are we together? So the action of the
[27:09] individual
[27:11] is connected to their revelation
[27:16] of the presence of God.
[27:20] Are we together? And verse two says,
[27:22] "The Lord looked down from heaven upon
[27:24] the children of men."
[27:30] Notice the Bible says, "God looked down
[27:33] from heaven upon the children of men
[27:42] to see if there were any that did
[27:45] understand and seek God.
[27:52] Because when you understand
[27:56] who you are,
[27:58] you understand who made this world.
[28:02] You understand your purpose on this
[28:04] earth.
[28:06] You cannot but look for the one who
[28:09] placed you here.
[28:13] Praise the Lord. So the Lord was looking
[28:15] from heaven
[28:17] at the children of men
[28:20] to see if there's any that has
[28:22] understanding
[28:25] and we will seek God.
[28:28] So understanding
[28:31] which is revelation
[28:33] is connected
[28:36] to you seeking the Lord.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And the psalm
[28:43] continues,
[28:44] "They are all gone aside,
[28:48] they are all together become filthy.
[28:53] There is none
[28:56] that doeth good. No, not one.
[29:02] Have all the workers of iniquity no
[29:05] knowledge? Who eat up my people as they
[29:08] eat bread? and call not upon the Lord.
[29:20] They were they
[29:22] in great fear,
[29:27] for God is in the generation of the
[29:31] righteous.
[29:35] And then I did a quick Bible search.
[29:40] because I wanted to understand my mind
[29:42] is just quite inquisitive sometimes.
[29:48] So I wanted to understand that word
[29:50] generation.
[29:54] So I searched my Bible to say who are
[29:57] the generation of the righteous?
[30:04] I looked at the word generation
[30:08] in its context,
[30:12] how it is used.
[30:15] And I looked at other Bible verses.
[30:19] Now, I'm not going to go into the Greek
[30:22] and all the other languages, Aramaic and
[30:26] and debate
[30:30] and and and so I'm giving a disclaimer
[30:32] right there.
[30:35] I ain't no Bible proof,
[30:38] but I'm a Bible preacher,
[30:42] but I'm a Bible preacher.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; But I can find good ground to stand on.
[30:50] And that ground is
[30:53] and I think anyone will probably agree
[30:56] with me
[31:01] that the word generation
[31:04] refers to your birth.
[31:09] Are we together? It refers to your birth
[31:15] and it can refer to your birth in two
[31:17] ways.
[31:21] One is the season in which you are born
[31:29] and two is the family or the lineage in
[31:33] which you are born.
[31:37] So you find that the Bible says these
[31:39] are the generations of Abraham.
[31:44] It's not speaking of the time.
[31:48] It's speaking of the lineage
[31:52] from Abraham
[31:54] and his son
[31:56] and his son son
[31:59] AND HIS SON SON.
[32:03] Are we together? So generation in that
[32:06] sense
[32:08] IS REFERRING TO YOUR origin
[32:14] and to your lineage.
[32:17] Are we together? Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; And then it also refers to the season in
[32:22] which you are born.
[32:26] And the scripture says
[32:29] GOD
[32:30] IS IN the generation
[32:34] of the righteous.
[32:37] Are we together? And we read there in
[32:41] verse two
[32:43] that God looked from heaven
[32:47] upon the children of men
[32:50] to see if there was any
[32:54] that did understand
[32:56] and seek God.
[32:59] And the Bible says
[33:01] they are all gone aside.
[33:05] They have allto together become filthy.
[33:10] There is NONE THAT DOETH GOOD.
[33:15] NO, not one.
[33:17] So there's two CLASSES OF PEOPLE.
[33:20] GOD looks
[33:23] at the children of men
[33:25] and they don't have understanding
[33:29] and they don't seek him
[33:31] and they live filthy
[33:34] and they are separated from him.
[33:38] AT VERSE FIVE
[33:40] INTRODUCES
[33:42] ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE.
[33:46] AND THE BIBLE SAYS
[33:48] GOD
[33:50] IS IN
[33:52] THE GENERATION.
[33:54] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. OF THE
[33:56] RIGHTEOUS.
[33:58] HALLELUJAH. SO THERE IS A PEOPLE
[34:02] SEPARATED FROM GOD.
[34:05] THEY LIVE ACCORDING to the darkness.
[34:10] BUT THERE IS A PEOPLE
[34:13] CONNECTED TO GOD
[34:16] THAT THE BIBLE REFERS to
[34:20] as THE RIGHTEOUS.
[34:23] SO RIGHTEOUSNESS
[34:26] COMES
[34:27] AS A RESULT
[34:29] OF YOUR CONNECTION TO GOD.
[34:33] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[34:35] WITHOUT A CONNECTION TO GOD,
[34:38] THERE IS NO RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[34:42] AMEN.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; And we read now
[34:48] in Luke chapter 15,
[34:52] the parable of the prodigal son.
[34:57] He was born a son.
[35:00] Amen. AMEN. HE WAS BORN IN THE HOUSE OF
[35:03] THE FATHER.
[35:07] He had a genetic connection to the
[35:09] father.
[35:13] But at a certain point,
[35:17] he decided TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE
[35:19] FATHER
[35:23] and he asked for WEALTH
[35:26] AND WEALTH
[35:28] DID NOT BRING HIM TO A REALIZATION.
[35:33] THAT HE WAS A SON,
[35:35] HE WAS CONNECTED TO THE FATHER.
[35:38] SO THE PROSPERITY GOSPEL
[35:42] &gt;&gt; CANNOT BRING YOU TO THAT PLACE,
[35:46] NO MATTER WHAT HOUSE YOU LIVE IN,
[35:49] NO MATTER WHAT CAR YOU DRIVE,
[35:52] NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY
[35:55] YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT,
[35:58] you can have A LOT OF IT.
[36:02] BUT IT CANNOT BRING YOU TO THE PLACE
[36:06] WHERE YOU REALIZE
[36:09] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE A SON OF THE FATHER
[36:12] THAT YOUR PROSPERITY
[36:15] IS CONNECTED TO YOUR CONNECTION TO THE
[36:18] FATHER.
[36:22] LET ME ALSO CLARIFY IT RIGHT there
[36:26] that THE BIBLE SAYS
[36:29] THAT HE LOST
[36:32] ALL THAT THE FATHER HAD GIVEN HIM
[36:36] AND THE BIBLE MAKES IT PLAIN
[36:40] THAT he beca he came in want.
[36:45] IN OTHER WORDS, HE LOST EVERYTHING
[36:49] AND HE BECAME POOR.
[36:53] HE WAS SO POOR
[36:55] THAT HE had nothing to feed himself
[36:58] with.
[37:00] HE LACKED.
[37:02] ALL the friends left him.
[37:06] THE INFLUENCE JUST GOT DESTROYED
[37:11] AND HE WAS THE POOREST OF THE POOR.
[37:16] AND THE BIBLE IN THIS PARABLE
[37:20] SAYS
[37:21] HE HAD GONE TO A FAR COUNTRY.
[37:27] HE WAS SO SEPARATED FROM THE FATHER
[37:32] THAT THE BIBLE SAYS HE HAD GONE TO A FAR
[37:34] COUNTRY
[37:37] AND HE HAD ASSOCIATED HIMSELF
[37:41] WITH A CITIZEN
[37:43] OF THAT FAR COUNTRY.
[37:46] HE HAD LEFT HIS CONNECTION TO THE FATHER
[37:50] AND WENT FAR
[37:53] AND CONNECTED HIMSELF
[37:56] TO A TO A CITIZEN
[37:59] OF ANOTHER KINGDOM,
[38:02] another civilization,
[38:05] another culture.
[38:08] And you know WHEN YOU DO THAT,
[38:11] THE BIBLE SAYS HE SENT HIM to go and
[38:14] feed this wife.
[38:20] HALLELUJAH.
[38:22] And for a Jew
[38:24] TO GET A JOB
[38:26] TO FEED,
[38:29] YOU CANNOT GET ANY LOWER THAN THAT
[38:34] against any of your convictions.
[38:40] Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S WHERE THE LACK OF REALIZATION
[38:47] CAN TAKE YOU TO.
[38:50] PRAISE THE LORD. SO EXTREME POVERTY
[38:55] still
[38:56] did not bring him to a realization.
[39:01] SO YOU MAY NOT HAVE SHOES.
[39:04] YOU MAY LACK MONEY.
[39:06] YOU MAY NOT HAVE A CAR. YOU MAY NOT HAVE
[39:09] A HOUSE.
[39:11] YOU CAN BE SO POOR.
[39:14] BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU MORE SPIRITUAL.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN
[39:26] PEOPLE FAIL TO MAKE IT IN LIFE,
[39:30] then they become super SPIRITUAL
[39:34] AND they don't care about the things OF
[39:35] THE WORLD,
[39:37] THEY ARE NOT connected to the world.
[39:41] AND ALL THE BROTHERS THAT ARE BEING
[39:42] SUCCESSFUL,
[39:44] THEY are all in the flesh.
[39:54] Praise the Lord.
[39:55] BUT AS THE prophet
[39:59] re revisits this story
[40:02] in the message a prodigal,
[40:06] he brings emphasis
[40:10] and he says, "THE ANGEL OF the Lord
[40:15] MUST HAVE GONE TO THIS YOUNG man
[40:21] together." IN OTHER WORDS,
[40:25] NATURAL CIRCUMSTANCES
[40:29] COULD NOT BRING HIM
[40:32] TO THE POINT OF REALIZATION.
[40:36] THERE HAD TO BE A SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT.
[40:43] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[40:45] TO BRING HIM TO THE PLACE
[40:48] WHERE HE COULD REALIZE
[40:51] THAT I DO NOT BELONG HERE.
[40:54] I HAVE A FATHER
[40:57] AND IF I GO BACK TO HIM,
[41:00] I KNOW THE NATURE OF MY FATHER.
[41:04] I KNOW WHO HE IS.
[41:06] I KNOW HIS NATURE.
[41:10] He will ACCEPT ME BACK.
[41:14] OH HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER
[41:18] FROM THAT SUPERNATURAL TOUCH
[41:22] THE BIBLE SAYS HE CAME TO his mind.
[41:28] He was awakened.
[41:30] HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
[41:33] RECEIVED A QUICKENING
[41:35] THAT HE WAS A SON.
[41:38] HE HAD A FATHER
[41:40] AND HE CAME FROM SOMEWHERE
[41:43] AND HE COULD GO BACK
[41:45] WHERE HE CAME FROM.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[41:52] A SUPERNATURAL TOUCH
[41:56] QUICKENED HIM TO AN AWARENESS
[42:00] THAT it was a partial realization.
[42:06] WHY DO I SAY SO?
[42:09] BECAUSE HE SAYS IT HIMSELF
[42:12] THAT with all the WRONG
[42:16] that I've DONE
[42:20] with all the CIGARETTES
[42:23] THAT I HAVE SMOKED
[42:25] WITH ALL THE NIGHTCLUBS
[42:29] THAT I HAVE VISITED
[42:31] WITH ALL THE FORNICATION
[42:34] THAT I HAVE DONE
[42:37] WITH ALL THE LIES
[42:40] WITH ALL THE CHEATING
[42:42] WITH ALL THE STEALING
[42:45] THAT I HAVE DONE.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; MY FATHER SHOULD NOT
[42:51] &gt;&gt; ACCEPT ME BACK AS A SON.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT THE FATHER SAYING IT.
[43:01] HALLELUJAH.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT THE FATHER SAYING IT.
[43:07] IT WAS THE SON
[43:09] AND CONDEMNATION
[43:12] compromising his position.
[43:17] HALLELUJAH.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HE AT LEAST THERE WAS A
[43:21] QUICKENING.
[43:25] EVERY STEP
[43:27] THAT HE WAS MAKING
[43:30] GOING TOWARDS THE FATHER,
[43:32] HE WAS GETTING CLOSER
[43:35] AND CLOSER
[43:37] TO THE PERFECT REALIZATION.
[43:41] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS,
[43:47] "AND WHEN HE CAME CLOSE,
[43:50] THE FATHER
[43:52] WAS WAITING FOR HIM."
[43:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; THE FATHER WAS UNDER EXPECTATION.
[44:01] WHY?
[44:03] BECAUSE THERE WAS A GENETIC
[44:07] CONNECTION.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:10] AND THE FATHER
[44:12] KNEW THAT THE GENES
[44:16] IN MY SON
[44:18] CANNOT LET HIM
[44:21] STAY IN DARKNESS
[44:23] ALL HIS LIFE.
[44:26] THE GENES IN HIM WILL CAUSE HIM ONE DAY
[44:32] TO COME TO AN AWAKENING
[44:34] &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL MAKE HIS WAY BACK.
[44:40] AMEN.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And allow me to say
[44:50] &gt;&gt; the Bible speaks
[44:53] &gt;&gt; of the feted calf.
[44:58] It was not fattened on that day.
[45:06] IT WAS NOT FATTENED ON THAT DAY.
[45:09] IT had been fattened,
[45:13] WAITING
[45:14] FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.
[45:20] AMEN.
[45:25] HALLELUJAH.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THE
[45:31] FATHER
[45:33] RAN TO MEET HIM
[45:36] AND HE DID NOT GREET HIM
[45:39] AS A STRANGER.
[45:42] HE DID NOT GREET HIM AS A SERVANT.
[45:48] AMEN. YOU DON'T GREET YOUR SERVANT
[45:51] BY KISSING YOUR SERVANT ON THE NECK.
[45:56] HALLELUJAH. THAT'S A PLACE FOR A SON.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; THE SON
[46:03] COULD HAVE BEEN STILL SMELLING PIGS.
[46:08] HE COULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT TIME
[46:12] WEARING TATTERED CLOTHES.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE COULD HAVE BEEN WALKING
[46:20] IN THE STEP THAT HE LAINED IN A STRANGE
[46:23] COUNTRY.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS
[46:29] WITH HIS PANTS RIGHT HERE.
[46:33] HALLELUJAH.
[46:34] BECAUSE HE HAD ACQUIRED
[46:37] TASTES AND FLAVORS
[46:40] FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY.
[46:43] AND THE FATHER,
[46:45] SO BEYOND.
[46:50] AMEN.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; SO BEYOND
[46:55] THE VISIBLE
[46:58] AND SO THE INVISIBLE,
[47:01] WHAT WAS THE INVISIBLE?
[47:04] THE GENETICS.
[47:08] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[47:10] SO HE NEVER LOST
[47:13] HIS SUNSHIP.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; HE LOST HE LOST HIS RELATIONSHIP
[47:21] TO HIS FATHER. You may sit a bit.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; The prophet in the message, what is the
[47:37] Holy Ghost?
[47:40] I see the brothers are showing each
[47:42] other
[47:43] that I'm just stealing from their notes.
[47:47] At least now THEY ARE FEELING
[47:50] HOW I was feeling when they were
[47:52] preaching.
[48:00] I saw my sermons finished.
[48:04] So it's it's payback time.
[48:11] Amen. Amen.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message, what is
[48:19] the Holy Ghost?
[48:22] He says upon this place we wish to
[48:25] approach the subject
[48:30] which I think is the outstanding subject
[48:32] of today.
[48:38] What is the Holy Spirit?
[48:41] What is it? And now the reason I have
[48:44] taken this subject in this line like
[48:46] this,
[48:50] the prophet says you cannot come
[48:54] and receive the Holy Spirit
[48:57] unless you know what it is.
[49:02] Amen.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[49:04] YOU CANNOT TALK and receive
[49:06] righteousness
[49:10] when you don't know what righteousness
[49:12] is.
[49:14] You cannot receive the Holy Ghost
[49:18] when you do not know what the Holy Ghost
[49:20] is.
[49:23] Are we together? Amen. You cannot
[49:26] receive it
[49:28] if you know what it is
[49:32] unless you believe
[49:34] it's given to you.
[49:38] And if it's for you,
[49:41] YOU CANNOT KNOW WHETHER YOU'VE GOT it
[49:46] or not
[49:48] unless you know the results
[49:52] which it brings.
[49:56] SO IF YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS,
[49:59] WHO it is TO
[50:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT ACTION it brings when it comes,
[50:08] then you know
[50:11] what you've got when you get it.
[50:15] See, that just would settle it.
[50:20] If you DON'T KNOW WHAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS,
[50:25] IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS FOR
[50:28] AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES WHEN
[50:30] IT IS UPON YOU,
[50:33] THEN HOW CAN YOU ENJOY THE FULFILLMENT
[50:35] OF IT?
[50:38] SO WE HAVE TO TEACH
[50:41] WHAT RIGHTEOUSNESS IS.
[50:44] WE HAVE TO TEACH WHAT THE GENERATION
[50:49] OF THE RIGHTEOUS
[50:51] IS. AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, YOU NEED
[50:56] ALSO TO KNOW
[50:58] WHO THIS is for.
[51:02] AND THEN YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT WHEN WHEN
[51:07] THIS IS UPON YOU
[51:09] AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT REVELATION OF IT,
[51:13] THEN WHAT ACTIONS DOES IT BRING?
[51:17] THEN YOU ARE COMPLETE.
[51:20] THEN THE convention is finished.
[51:24] Amen.
[51:27] Amen.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:29] So we said in the parable of the
[51:32] prodigal son,
[51:36] the son was connected to the blessings
[51:40] as he was as long as he was connected to
[51:43] the father.
[51:46] As long as he had a relationship with
[51:48] the father,
[51:52] he was connected to prosperity,
[51:57] connected to the blessings,
[52:00] connected to the protection,
[52:03] connected to everything that is negative
[52:08] because he was connected to the father.
[52:12] But the day he moved away FROM THE
[52:14] FATHER,
[52:16] then he got disconnected
[52:19] from all this.
[52:22] But it did not remove
[52:25] his position
[52:27] AS A SON. SO WE CAN SAFELY SAY
[52:32] THAT THE ONE thing that he LOST
[52:36] was not HIS SUNSHIP,
[52:39] IT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP.
[52:42] TO HIS FATHER.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; And if you are to give a title to this
[52:48] subject that I'm about to close now,
[52:55] you say it is called realization of the
[52:58] relationship.
[53:03] Everything is about relationship.
[53:07] A home is ABOUT RELATIONSHIP.
[53:11] You can have a house
[53:14] but not a home.
[53:16] But a home is relationships
[53:20] within a house.
[53:25] Amen.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know if that comes out well in
[53:27] your language. Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together? It is the relationship
[53:31] between the mother and the father
[53:35] and between the parents and the
[53:37] children.
[53:40] And that makes a home.
[53:43] SO A HOME
[53:46] is an interweaving of relationships.
[53:52] Are we together? And a village
[53:56] is also an interweaving of
[53:59] relationships.
[54:02] the village head,
[54:05] his family,
[54:07] the dignitaries in the village,
[54:11] and then ordinary villages.
[54:14] And within that village,
[54:16] there's families that are good at
[54:18] rearing goats.
[54:22] There's villages. There's people who are
[54:24] good at farming.
[54:27] There's people who are GOOD AT GROWING
[54:29] VEGETABLES.
[54:33] THERE'S PEOPLE WHO are good at digging
[54:35] wells.
[54:38] There's big STRONG MEN
[54:41] THAT CAN LIFT heavy things
[54:44] that if people want TO BUILD A HEART
[54:47] AND IT'S NOW TIME TO LIFT THE CENTRAL
[54:49] BEAM,
[54:52] THEY KNOW THE FAMILY
[54:54] THAT has big strong hands.
[54:59] They call FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
[55:01] TO COME AND LIFT THE house or the roof.
[55:07] SO A VILLAGE
[55:09] is interwoven relationships.
[55:14] So is A NATION ALSO.
[55:17] A NATION IS NOT A NATION
[55:20] without relationships.
[55:23] And the nature OF A NATION
[55:26] IS DEFINED BY THE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN
[55:29] THE NATION.
[55:33] AND YOU CAN GIVE A NATION TITLES
[55:37] and call it this THAT OR THE OTHER.
[55:41] I HAVE TO tread carefully because it's
[55:42] election time.
[55:46] So I will leave that part.
[55:50] We've been told to apply wisdom.
[55:55] Are we together?
[55:57] &gt;&gt; BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE NATION
[56:00] GIVES CHARACTER TO THE NATION.
[56:04] THAT'S WHY UGANDA IS NOT LIKE RWANDA.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE TANZANIA.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE KENYA.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE ZIMBABWE. IT'S NOT LIKE
[56:15] SOUTH AFRICA. IT'S NOT LIKE AUSTRALIA
[56:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT institutions
[56:22] the different institutions have
[56:24] different RELATIONSHIPS
[56:28] AND IT IS THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEN
[56:31] MOLD the character and characteristics
[56:33] of the NATION
[56:39] AND THE BIBLE ITSELF
[56:41] IS A book of relationship.
[56:44] You talk about the story of Ruth and Bo.
[56:48] Hallelujah. You talk about the story OF
[56:51] ESTHER.
[56:53] HALLELUJAH. AND THE KING.
[56:56] YOU TALK ABOUT THE STORIES OF JACOB
[56:59] GOING AFTER HIS WIFE
[57:02] GETTING cheated and getting an older
[57:04] one.
[57:06] But his RELATIONSHIP
[57:09] ALL TO THE YOUNGER ONE WAS STRONG ENOUGH
[57:14] TO MAKE HIM WORK AN EXTRA SEVEN YEARS
[57:18] SO that he could still have HER AS A
[57:19] WIFE.
[57:21] ARE WE TOGETHER? It's a book of
[57:23] RELATIONSHIPS
[57:26] AND THE STORY OF REDEMPTION
[57:29] IS THE STORY OF GOD'S RELATIONSHIP
[57:34] WITH HIS PEOPLE. IN THE MESSAGE, CHRIST
[57:37] IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED.
[57:40] THE PROPHET MAKES IT PLAIN THAT GOD HAD
[57:43] A THREE-FOLD PURPOSE
[57:46] IN HIS WHOLE PLAN OF REDEMPTION
[57:49] TO REVEAL HIMSELF
[57:52] to his people
[57:54] in CHRIST
[57:56] AND TO HAVE PREEMINENCE
[57:59] IN THE BODY OF BELIEVERS,
[58:02] THE BRIDE THAT HE MAY LIVE IN THEM.
[58:07] AND THIRDLY,
[58:09] TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM
[58:11] TO ITS RIGHTLY POSITION
[58:14] THAT FELL
[58:17] BY SIN.
[58:19] They had a relationship before.
[58:23] BUT SIN CAME IN AND SIN CAUSED A
[58:26] SEPARATION.
[58:28] SIN AFFECTED THE RELATIONSHIP.
[58:32] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[58:34] BUT THE RELATIONSHIP
[58:36] COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY LOST
[58:39] BECAUSE GOD THE FATHER
[58:42] WAS CONNECTED
[58:44] TO HIS CHILDREN BY GENETICS.
[58:50] AMEN.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. SO HE HAD TO MAKE A
[58:54] WAY
[58:56] OF COMING BACK
[58:58] FOR HIS OWN CHILDREN
[59:00] BECAUSE A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD
[59:04] CANNOT BE completely lost.
[59:11] And where was he restoring them to?
[59:15] To a place
[59:18] &gt;&gt; where he walked in the cool of the
[59:20] evening.
[59:24] with his people,
[59:26] talked with them,
[59:29] fellowshipped with them.
[59:32] And the prophet says, "What is
[59:34] fellowship?"
[59:37] And the prophet says, "It is two fellows
[59:40] IN ONE SHIP.
[59:42] GOD
[59:44] ALONE
[59:46] WITH HIS CHILDREN."
[59:49] THAT'S THE PLACE THAT GOD WANTS TO TAKE
[59:52] YOU TO TAKE ME TO TAKE THE WHOLE BRIDE
[59:58] BACK TO WHERE GOD CAN TALK TO US AS
[1:00:02] FRIEND TO FRIEND
[1:00:05] WITH perfect trust
[1:00:08] PERFECT REVELATION
[1:00:10] THAT THIS IS MY FATHER,
[1:00:13] THIS IS MY SON.
[1:00:15] WE LOVE EACH OTHER. WE TRUST EACH OTHER.
[1:00:19] I WILL GIVE MY SON
[1:00:22] THE AUTHORITY
[1:00:24] TO SPEAK
[1:00:26] AND TO NAME
[1:00:28] AND TO DEFINE
[1:00:31] BECAUSE HE IS MY SON.
[1:00:34] AND GOD
[1:00:36] ALL THROUGHOUT HISTORY
[1:00:39] HAS BEEN WORKING
[1:00:41] HIS PLAN
[1:00:43] TO BRING THE BRIDE BACK TO THAT PLACE.
[1:00:49] AMEN.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; IN THE MESSAGE, THE deity of Jesus
[1:00:52] Christ,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; the prophet says,
[1:00:58] "Men lost the origin
[1:01:01] in the garden of Eden,
[1:01:04] his relationship,
[1:01:07] COMMUNION WITH GOD
[1:01:10] WAS CUT OFF THERE
[1:01:12] BECAUSE of sin
[1:01:14] AND UNBELIEF.
[1:01:17] UNBELIEF IN WHAT?
[1:01:19] The word OF GOD.
[1:01:22] IN A MESSAGE, a testimony,
[1:01:25] THE PROPHET SAYS, "THERE'S ONE MEDIATOR
[1:01:29] BETWEEN God and man,
[1:01:32] AND THAT'S THE MAN, JESUS CHRIST."
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE ONE
[1:01:39] WHO DIED
[1:01:41] TO BRING THE RELATIONSHIP.
[1:01:45] that was ONCE LOST
[1:01:48] BETWEEN GOD AND MAN
[1:01:51] BACK AGAIN.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; HE IS OUR PROVIDED SACRIFICE
[1:01:58] FOR OUR SICKNESS
[1:02:01] FOR OUR SALVATION.
[1:02:03] HE WAS WOUNDED for our TRANSGRESSIONS
[1:02:07] AND WITH HIS STRIPES
[1:02:10] WE ARE HEALED.
[1:02:14] AMEN. SO WHAT DID WE LOSE?
[1:02:17] IT WAS NEVER our sunship.
[1:02:21] It was never our spiritual DNA.
[1:02:26] WE CAME FROM GOD.
[1:02:29] WE HAVE THE GENES OF GOD.
[1:02:32] WE ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:02:36] BUT WHAT DID WE LOSE?
[1:02:39] WE LOST OUR RELATIONSHIP
[1:02:43] BECAUSE YOUR BLESSINGS.
[1:02:45] YOUR PROSPERITY,
[1:02:48] YOUR VICTORY
[1:02:50] IS CONNECTED TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
[1:02:53] When you lose YOUR RELATIONSHIP,
[1:02:56] YOU ARE DISCONNECTED
[1:02:59] FROM YOUR BLESSINGS.
[1:03:01] YOU ARE DISCONNECTED
[1:03:04] FROM YOUR AUTHORITY
[1:03:06] BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO POWER OF YOUR OWN.
[1:03:10] BUT WHAT YOU HAVE
[1:03:13] IS AUTHORITY.
[1:03:15] AND HOW DO YOU HAVE AUTHORITY?
[1:03:18] BECAUSE YOU ARE A SON OF THE FATHER.
[1:03:21] AND ALL THAT THE FATHER HAS
[1:03:25] HE HAS GIVEN TO THE SON.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND ALL THAT THE
[1:03:30] SON HAD
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; HE HAS POURED INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:03:37] AMEN.
[1:03:39] AMEN.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE?
[1:03:45] Matthew chapter 17
[1:03:47] verse 10. The disciples asked him,
[1:03:52] SAYING,
[1:03:54] "WHY THEN SAY THE scribes
[1:03:58] that Elias must first come?
[1:04:03] All these things
[1:04:05] that you have said, it's clear.
[1:04:10] We see this BUT WE EXPECTED
[1:04:14] BEFORE YOUR COMING
[1:04:16] THAT ELIAS SHOULD FIRST COME.
[1:04:20] WHY DID THE SCRIBES
[1:04:23] TELL US THAT ELIAS
[1:04:26] MUST FIRST COME? VERSE 11. And Jesus
[1:04:30] answered
[1:04:32] and said unto them,
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; ELIAS
[1:04:36] TRULY
[1:04:39] SHALL
[1:04:41] FIRST COME. NOW LET ME ASK YOU BROTHER,
[1:04:44] SISTER,
[1:04:46] THE WORD IS CLEAR. JESUS CHRIST THE WORD
[1:04:50] MADE FLESH
[1:04:52] IS GIVING AN ANSWER
[1:04:55] THAT ELIAS
[1:04:57] MUST SHALL
[1:05:00] FIRST COME
[1:05:02] TO DO WHAT?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; TO DO WHAT?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:05:07] IT
[1:05:09] IS COMING TO RESTORE
[1:05:13] ALL THINGS.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR?
[1:05:18] IT IS THE RESTORATION
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; OF ALL THINGS.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU RESTORE
[1:05:28] ALL THINGS?
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; YOU RESTORE ALL THINGS
[1:05:32] BY BRINGING BACK THE REVELATION
[1:05:36] OF SUNSHIP.
[1:05:38] MAY THE LORD RICHLY BLESS YOU.
[1:05:47] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; GLORY.

[1:06:01] OUR AUTHORITY IS RESTORED.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; POWER IS RESTORED.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; JOY IS RESTORED.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; OUR GLORY, HALLELUJAH, IS RESTORED.
[1:06:12] HALLELUJAH. OUR FREEDOM IS RESTORED
[1:06:15] NOW. WE KNOW WHO WE ARE.
[1:06:18] WE KNOW WHAT WE STAND FOR.
[1:06:21] WE ARE DEVIL SLAYERS.
[1:06:25] WE ARE NOT HERE TO live a defeated life.
[1:06:30] I SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; LISTEN. The pastor SAID
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; THE CALF WAS NOT FATTENED ON THAT DAY.
[1:06:46] OH, IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY, I AM HAPPY.
[1:06:50] THE CALF WAS NOT FATTENED ON THAT DAY.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT HAD ALL IT HAD
[1:07:00] BEEN FATTENED
[1:07:02] BEFORE THE BOY EVEN CAME BACK.
[1:07:07] WHICH MEANS
[1:07:09] THE BOY
[1:07:11] NEVER LOST HIS GENETICS
[1:07:17] but he had lost the RELATIONSHIP
[1:07:22] but now the relationship had to be
[1:07:25] restored.
[1:07:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[1:08:07] sermon

[1:08:18] NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DO I BRING A MESSAGE
[1:08:22] TO THE PEOPLE
[1:08:24] THAT THEY MAY FOLLOW ME

[1:08:35] AMEN. IT'S NOT JUST TO MAKE FOLLOWERS
[1:08:39] OR TO START SOME FELLOWSHIP
[1:08:42] AN ORGANIZATION. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT
[1:08:45] AND I WILL NOT DO THAT NOW. I HAVE NO
[1:08:48] INTEREST IN THOSE things
[1:08:51] and EVERY GOD CALLED MAN HAS NO INTEREST
[1:08:53] IN those things.

[1:10:36] Come and close it. Just come and close
[1:10:38] it, brother Isaac.
[1:10:40] Because if I sing, we will not get out
[1:10:43] of here. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:10:47] Isn't Lord wonderful saints?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; We have been restored.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; We have been restored. Tell your
[1:10:57] neighbor, we have been restored.
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray together?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Our most gracious heavenly father,
[1:11:18] our hearts are charged.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; After being in this hall from afternoon,
[1:11:29] you have used your servants Lord to
[1:11:31] energize our faiths
[1:11:37] as we retire for the day. Father, we
[1:11:39] have heard from you.
[1:11:42] We are under great expectations in
[1:11:45] tomorrow's meetings
[1:11:48] that the God of this Friday shall be God
[1:11:51] on Saturday.
[1:11:55] We can't wait for tomorrow to be lifted
[1:11:57] up from morning till evening.
[1:12:01] We pray that Lord you may strengthen
[1:12:04] your servants
[1:12:08] and Lord Jesus inspiring them for the
[1:12:10] day of tomorrow.
[1:12:13] Thank you for all that we have heard.
[1:12:17] One desire we have dear father
[1:12:21] is is that these words that we are
[1:12:22] hearing hearing father they may become
[1:12:24] live
[1:12:27] because we have to become the message.
[1:12:31] This word must be must move from the
[1:12:34] papers of the bible
[1:12:38] and take the format of flesh.
[1:12:42] that the world can see Jesus walking
[1:12:44] again.
[1:12:47] That is the main uh main objective of
[1:12:50] holding such conventions
[1:12:55] that what we have heard tonight
[1:12:58] that there can be an established
[1:13:00] relationship,
[1:13:02] a spiritual relationship
[1:13:05] between God and his children.
[1:13:08] If that is accomplished in our lives as
[1:13:11] young people, Father,
[1:13:13] we will glorify your name as we go to
[1:13:17] sleep. Dear father, may those words
[1:13:20] remain alive in our hearts that when we
[1:13:23] assemble to tomorrow morning, we shall
[1:13:26] continue from where we have left.
[1:13:30] Bless your servants. Bless us all
[1:13:33] together as we go to rest heavenly
[1:13:36] father. We can't wait for tomorrow. May
[1:13:39] all glory and honor return unto you.
[1:13:43] For these blessings we ask in Jesus
[1:13:45] name.
[1:13:49] Brother Isaac is a man with a great
[1:13:51] burden
[1:13:53] for the youth. And I'm so honored,
[1:13:56] brother Isaac, to have you here. I know
[1:13:58] it is a great sacrifice. He's a busy man
[1:14:01] to get him here. I've tried to get him
[1:14:03] to my church to come, but it's been
[1:14:05] difficult.
[1:14:07] But I'm happy that he's here.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; It's because of the young people. God
[1:14:10] bless you, brother Isaac.
