[1:00:45] and we concentrate on you this morning,
[1:00:50] knowing, Lord, that you are able.
[1:00:54] to just come and refresh us.
[1:00:57] Give us a refreshing this morning.
[1:01:01] Let the spirit of God
[1:01:03] just give us a refreshing
[1:01:05] ask him to give you a refreshing.
[1:01:10] We're just here to worship him.
[1:01:14] I wonder how many can forget about
[1:01:16] themselves
[1:01:20] and concentrate on him.
[1:01:23] for just a moment before we go to the
[1:01:25] preaching of the word.
[1:01:28] This is always a very [music] crucial
[1:01:29] time.
[1:01:31] Time of worship
[1:01:33] because that's when you concentrate on
[1:01:35] him.
[1:01:37] That's when you forget about yourself.
[1:01:40] When you begin to sing and to worship,
[1:01:44] then his spirit begin to come down in
[1:01:46] your heart
[1:01:48] and then you begin to think about him.
[1:01:51] And then you begin to worship him.
[1:01:55] When you begin to worship him, then his
[1:01:56] presence comes.
[1:02:00] Listen friends, we are not just singing,
[1:02:04] we worshiping him.
[1:02:06] And would you just connect to that this
[1:02:08] morning?
[1:02:10] If you don't feel his presence,
[1:02:13] then you can't hear from him.
[1:02:16] But if you're connected to his presence,
[1:02:19] then you can hear from him.
[1:02:22] Some of us, you know, coming from all
[1:02:23] these ceremonies and music and this all
[1:02:26] these things,
[1:02:27] you know, but when you come in his
[1:02:30] presence,
[1:02:32] you just want to forget about everything
[1:02:35] and let his presence come.
[1:02:38] So here I am to
[1:02:45] bow down. Forget about everything else
[1:02:50] together. Let us worship you saints
[1:02:52] together. Everybody [music and singing]
[1:02:54] mighty God.

[1:27:04] Thank you musician.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; We are reading Psalms uh Proverbs rather
[1:27:14] 29. We read this on Sunday. We just read
[1:27:16] just rehears it.
[1:27:23] Where [clears throat] there is no
[1:27:23] vision, the people perish. But he that
[1:27:25] keepeth the law, happy is he.
[1:27:40] be seated please.
[1:27:50] I just want to greet each and every one
[1:27:51] of you in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:27:53] Christ.
[1:27:56] We have very many who are not here
[1:28:01] that I know of. Maybe over 15
[1:28:05] that have we left in Toruro
[1:28:09] and uh I'm seeing a few have made it.
[1:28:13] Wow. Sister Groot.
[1:28:16] Where is
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; she here this morning? Didn't make it.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. Sister G. That's quite an effort.
[1:28:23] God bless you. And sister Monica.
[1:28:25] I expected these ones to be in Toro or
[1:28:27] somewhere
[1:28:31] and I expected them to be there.
[1:28:34] We left them back.
[1:28:36] But I know there are others who have not
[1:28:37] made it.
[1:28:40] The appeal guards are they here?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Well, they couldn't make make it I think
[1:28:45] there
[1:28:46] only one is here. And um so the others
[1:28:50] um the sister Mary and others
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; the
[1:28:56] you know um brother Emma the net and
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; um they were not able to travel but we
[1:29:04] had a good time with them in Tora
[1:29:06] yesterday
[1:29:09] and uh you know the function started a
[1:29:10] bit late so we could not wait it out to
[1:29:13] finish.
[1:29:16] So, but we are glad that we finally made
[1:29:19] it personally and the team I traveled
[1:29:21] with of about 8, we arrived past 300
[1:29:26] a.m.
[1:29:31] But we thank God for the trip that he
[1:29:33] gave us.
[1:29:36] Thank you for those who have been
[1:29:37] praying for us.
[1:29:40] And also um I know that those I've not
[1:29:44] had a report yet, but I hope and pray
[1:29:46] that sister Martha it went very well
[1:29:51] and but I'm yet to hear from the
[1:29:52] brothers. [snorts]
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So God, you know, it started a bit
[1:29:57] late there and you know we I was
[1:29:59] supposed to speak for for an hour but
[1:30:00] then they gave me only well I also
[1:30:03] wanted to just take 30 minutes because
[1:30:04] it was already late.
[1:30:10] Uh, I just say what I'm saying because
[1:30:13] they didn't really give me a a short
[1:30:15] time. I I'm sure even sister wanted me
[1:30:17] to still do an hour even when it was
[1:30:18] late.
[1:30:23] But we just did 30 minutes
[1:30:26] with an interpreter. That's about 15
[1:30:28] minutes.
[1:30:30] And I can tell you, we packed as much as
[1:30:32] we could pack in 15 minutes.
[1:30:36] The Lord really gave us grace
[1:30:39] and so um we had many saying well thank
[1:30:42] you we
[1:30:46] a brother one of ours brother Edson
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; minister from the tesso brethren
[1:30:55] traveled uh drove with his family all
[1:30:57] the way from you know I don't remember
[1:30:59] the place but I don't know remember the
[1:31:01] name of the place but deep in tesso
[1:31:04] about 5
[1:31:07] just to come and interpret for me on
[1:31:09] that function.
[1:31:11] So a lot of resources were spent
[1:31:16] on both our side him and us. But we
[1:31:18] always say if it is only for one soul
[1:31:22] then it is worth it
[1:31:25] then it is worth it. And so um thank you
[1:31:30] for praying for us sister the family.
[1:31:33] They're not here with us as well.
[1:31:36] You know, quite a lot of people
[1:31:37] traveling during this season.
[1:31:40] They are in
[1:31:43] just to be with the church there and the
[1:31:44] family.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And also sister Sarah, we've had
[1:31:50] she's also not here.
[1:31:53] She's going to be with the family. I
[1:31:55] think is it her brother that is getting
[1:31:57] married?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And then for sister um
[1:32:03] uh sister Mary is her also her brother.
[1:32:09] So quite a lot is going on.
[1:32:12] And I just also wanted to let you know
[1:32:16] that we are going to have a visiting
[1:32:17] minister
[1:32:20] from New York
[1:32:24] um this coming week. The Lord willing.
[1:32:28] Um we'll receive him on Wednesday.
[1:32:34] and the plan is to take him to Kamoja.
[1:32:40] We're going to have a very big
[1:32:41] convention.
[1:32:44] Uh so they had asked me to come and and
[1:32:46] take the some meetings.
[1:32:49] But whenever I'm going up there, I
[1:32:51] always desire to take, you know, some
[1:32:54] more ministry with me.
[1:32:59] So, Pastor Simon Peter Cece
[1:33:03] is a pastor from New York and York. He's
[1:33:06] a very wonderful brother, very uh with a
[1:33:10] very extraordinary ministry.
[1:33:14] I tell you what, um I'm trying to see if
[1:33:17] it would be possible to squeeze in a
[1:33:20] Wednesday evening before he flies out.
[1:33:27] If that is going to happen, we will
[1:33:29] announce it. But tentatively, we expect
[1:33:33] he will speak for us on a Wednesday
[1:33:35] after Karamoja.
[1:33:40] But you don't want to miss that news.
[1:33:44] You will please try your best to be
[1:33:45] here.
[1:33:47] So uh if that works out we'll be in
[1:33:49] Karamoja
[1:33:52] on on the Friday Thursday Friday
[1:33:56] the whole day we are traveling
[1:33:59] and Friday we have meetings
[1:34:03] then Saturday Sunday
[1:34:05] about okay I was told about 9,000 people
[1:34:08] I expected
[1:34:12] uh but um you know sometimes people
[1:34:15] someone throws out a number out there.
[1:34:16] You don't know. Last time I was told
[1:34:18] about
[1:34:20] 3,000, but it looked like 4,000.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; So, we don't know maybe you can say
[1:34:30] between 7 to 9,000 people.
[1:34:35] This is an entire regional convention.
[1:34:40] All the believers in Kamoja
[1:34:44] are coordinated and corporated
[1:34:48] organized that convention.
[1:34:50] One thing I love about Kamoja,
[1:34:53] I always say that is the poorest region
[1:34:55] in Uganda
[1:34:58] and the remotest.
[1:35:01] But in my opinion,
[1:35:03] I think they are not the poorest.
[1:35:06] uh because if you notice if you see the
[1:35:08] things they are able to do
[1:35:12] one thing that I've seen in Kamoja over
[1:35:14] the years I've been working with those
[1:35:15] brothers there
[1:35:19] is they are not beggars
[1:35:21] they may not live in a very good you
[1:35:24] know situation
[1:35:27] but they're content and they also always
[1:35:31] support their own meetings
[1:35:36] Now I was I received brother Guma
[1:35:39] the brother used to you know to
[1:35:40] coordinate there
[1:35:44] he came here this last Wednesday
[1:35:48] she was helping him to buy some sound
[1:35:50] equipment
[1:35:54] [clears throat] and uh you know he was
[1:35:55] giving me a report
[1:35:58] they collected more than you can say 45
[1:36:00] millions
[1:36:04] all of them together,
[1:36:06] the churches
[1:36:08] to be able to uh you know buy the
[1:36:12] necessary bulls and goss and buy sound
[1:36:16] equipment and do whatever it is. So we
[1:36:19] are not going to give them any money or
[1:36:21] any support.
[1:36:24] We're just going to go and you know
[1:36:25] minister to them.
[1:36:27] Maybe our part will also be you know the
[1:36:30] fuel and
[1:36:36] which is also not small
[1:36:38] but when I see the sacrifice they have
[1:36:40] made
[1:36:42] we really want to also do as much as we
[1:36:44] can
[1:36:47] whenever I go to kamoja
[1:36:49] I don't spend less than 5 million
[1:36:54] spreading the gospel is not
[1:36:58] And so I'm requesting that whenever you
[1:37:00] hear us, you know, going out or doing
[1:37:02] something, do what you can also on your
[1:37:04] part.
[1:37:08] And that's really why we we as
[1:37:10] Christians pay tithe,
[1:37:14] those resources go to things like that,
[1:37:17] just support the word.
[1:37:20] And so just pray remember to pray for
[1:37:22] Karamoja missionary convention
[1:37:26] that the Lord will will just accomplish
[1:37:29] it. I know there are many other
[1:37:30] ministers from uh from within also the
[1:37:32] country will go
[1:37:35] also myself and pastor Simon will just
[1:37:37] take a few meetings
[1:37:41] and the others also will be taking other
[1:37:43] meetings.
[1:37:45] So would you remember that in prayer?
[1:37:49] Amen. And uh also
[1:37:52] um you know it's the end of the year
[1:37:55] there's a lot of things
[1:37:58] as you know meetings happening around
[1:38:00] this time.
[1:38:02] So we're going to be having brother
[1:38:03] Michael coming up.
[1:38:06] Uh
[1:38:08] I think some of you have seen him
[1:38:10] already advertised for the
[1:38:12] youth convention in of lifeboat.
[1:38:18] So, you know, I had invited brother
[1:38:20] Michael uh before he was invited there.
[1:38:26] And so then now he he he told me, "Well,
[1:38:29] I'm already coming to Uganda.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; So, I don't think I can make it again in
[1:38:34] January
[1:38:37] and then, you know, things happened. You
[1:38:38] know, we're trying to work on audio
[1:38:40] translation and other things
[1:38:44] or the translating the audio, brother
[1:38:46] Bham.
[1:38:48] in several languages. So we are working
[1:38:51] with him on that project
[1:38:53] and so now it's necessary that he comes
[1:38:55] back.
[1:38:57] So then at the same time he got this
[1:39:00] invitation to come and take that
[1:39:01] meeting.
[1:39:04] So I told him well since I had already
[1:39:05] invited you
[1:39:08] I can only support your coming so soon.
[1:39:14] I can only be behind it as long as you
[1:39:16] take a meeting for us as well.
[1:39:22] Well, you know, he's I call him a buddy
[1:39:24] of mine. So,
[1:39:26] so he he agreed. He said, "Okay, so
[1:39:29] we'll take a meeting at DVF."
[1:39:33] So after the the I hope that many of you
[1:39:36] have already registered and planning to
[1:39:37] be
[1:39:39] with the convention at lifeboat.
[1:39:42] Where do they arrange it at?
[1:39:46] How many are going?
[1:39:49] God bless you. God bless you.
[1:39:54] Those are three people. It cannot be
[1:39:56] only three. And yet you expect them to
[1:40:00] also come to ours. younger
[1:40:03] people
[1:40:06] put money in these things and we go try
[1:40:08] you have known these conventions
[1:40:12] and uh you know you know I'm sure that
[1:40:14] you'll be blessed if you can
[1:40:17] so [snorts]
[1:40:18] um
[1:40:20] he that weekend of the meeting
[1:40:24] after it
[1:40:26] actually maybe I should just say the
[1:40:28] first Sunday in the year
[1:40:34] We shall be with brother Michael here.
[1:40:36] So you don't want to miss that. Just
[1:40:41] praise God.
[1:40:43] So can we now go in the word?
[1:40:47] Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell Ask
[1:40:49] them, "Are you ready for the word?"
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; What did they say?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Okay. I'm happy to see Sister
[1:41:00] Rachel.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; That's good. You know, when you see a
[1:41:05] believer struggling, you know, you know
[1:41:07] they're busy, but they struggle to come
[1:41:08] and be in church,
[1:41:12] it is encouraging. I did not expect this
[1:41:14] young lady here today.
[1:41:17] Amen. I'm dealing with I've been dealing
[1:41:20] with this subject that I'm going to talk
[1:41:21] about today for maybe the next one hour
[1:41:23] or so.
[1:41:28] Uh sometimes you you want to finish a
[1:41:32] thought one goal but other times you
[1:41:35] feel that you want to give little by
[1:41:37] little so that people can be able to um
[1:41:41] um maybe internalize it very well.
[1:41:52] How many are enjoying this this series?
[1:41:56] It was not meant to be serious really
[1:41:58] but u
[1:42:00] but it has just happened that way and
[1:42:03] uh so um political maneuvers that
[1:42:06] obscure the vision
[1:42:12] and so we've been speaking on the vision
[1:42:16] and by the way some of you I understand
[1:42:19] did not understand the announcement on
[1:42:22] Sunday
[1:42:27] The announcement on Sunday,
[1:42:30] the summary of it
[1:42:33] was saying now we have full ownership
[1:42:39] of part of the land.
[1:42:45] Some of you who don't know, not
[1:42:46] everyone, the majority know, but those
[1:42:48] few, the young ones who don't know what
[1:42:50] a title means.
[1:42:53] If you have a title,
[1:42:56] it means you have full ownership.
[1:43:02] You can build if you want.
[1:43:05] So which means part of the land is
[1:43:07] already ours.
[1:43:12] Don't look at me like that.
[1:43:15] You need to clap for that.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So we are and the other piece
[1:43:21] we are remaining with 95 million
[1:43:23] shillings.
[1:43:25] It's been a long journey
[1:43:28] but I can say in four years
[1:43:30] it's been God's grace.
[1:43:33] So um the Lord gave us the vision he
[1:43:35] will accomplish it.
[1:43:38] You know God gives you according to your
[1:43:39] faith.
[1:43:42] If your faith is small
[1:43:44] you get small things. faith is big, you
[1:43:48] get big. Amen. Amen. But our faith is
[1:43:51] really big.
[1:43:54] And we are believing that our God is
[1:43:56] also not small. He's a big God.
[1:44:00] And so those of you who have not yet
[1:44:01] come on board,
[1:44:03] please join a group.
[1:44:06] Give your little nickels whatever it
[1:44:13] shall get.
[1:44:15] When little by little you reach far.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; We have a visttor here. Brother promise.
[1:44:20] He's been with us the whole of the week
[1:44:23] to pastor Michael Wing.
[1:44:26] Stand up and wave to the people. Let
[1:44:27] them see.
[1:44:30] God bless you.
[1:44:32] Amen. So political maneuvers that
[1:44:34] obscure the vision.
[1:44:38] And um speaking of the vision, on Sunday
[1:44:41] we were dealing with uh with the
[1:44:46] the vision of this age.
[1:44:52] And we talked about God choosing a
[1:44:54] season
[1:44:56] and choosing a person to minister in
[1:44:58] that season.
[1:45:01] And he does not choose when God in a
[1:45:04] season
[1:45:06] when God wants to speak to the people of
[1:45:08] that time,
[1:45:11] he does not choose a party or a sect or
[1:45:13] a group or an organization.
[1:45:17] But he chooses one person
[1:45:20] and people have always been offended by
[1:45:22] that.
[1:45:23] SO HOW CAN GOD use one man in the in the
[1:45:25] entire world
[1:45:28] and they will ask you IS IT REALISTIC?
[1:45:31] I ASK you also is it realistic?
[1:45:34] No, it is NOT REALISTIC. BUT GOD
[1:45:36] specializes
[1:45:38] in things thought impossible.
[1:45:41] And he, you know, the wisdom of men
[1:45:45] is the foolishness of God.
[1:45:47] And so when they think that they know
[1:45:49] too much,
[1:45:51] that's when where God God's foolishness
[1:45:53] begin.
[1:45:55] They they know nothing.
[1:45:57] They know nothing. And so we see that
[1:46:00] God always uses one man
[1:46:04] and he sends him to an entire
[1:46:06] generation.
[1:46:09] So when we say generation,
[1:46:11] we mean world over.
[1:46:15] He has done it before in the Bible. He
[1:46:17] used a man called Noah.
[1:46:20] Do you realize that the world in the
[1:46:22] days of Noah
[1:46:24] was probably more populated than our
[1:46:27] world today?
[1:46:31] Have you thought about it before that
[1:46:34] the days of Noah actually had
[1:46:36] civilization?
[1:46:41] Do you realize that? The days of Noah
[1:46:44] had civilization
[1:46:47] just like our days. maybe even better
[1:46:50] than our days
[1:46:53] because they did things that until today
[1:46:56] we are not able to do to replicate.
[1:47:01] The great pyramid of Giza and all this.
[1:47:04] No, no man has been able to replicate
[1:47:06] that.
[1:47:09] Brother
[1:47:11] uh I was fine and then you you made you
[1:47:13] just made it bad. So try to make it fine
[1:47:15] again my monitor. So then you see that
[1:47:20] uh it means that they had a technology
[1:47:23] and in their civilization
[1:47:29] which we are yet to arrive at
[1:47:33] even their population
[1:47:37] must have been so large.
[1:47:40] Now God sends one man
[1:47:44] not to one city,
[1:47:46] not to one country but to the entire
[1:47:50] world.
[1:47:52] He sends him tells him you know Noah I'm
[1:47:56] giving you a message to the whole world
[1:48:01] go and tell them to enter the boat. If
[1:48:04] you want reason,
[1:48:07] your first QUESTION WOULD BE IF the
[1:48:09] message of Noah is FOR AN ENTIRE WORLD,
[1:48:13] THE ENTIRE WORLD, if if they all
[1:48:16] believe,
[1:48:18] can they fit into the ark?
[1:48:24] The answer is no.
[1:48:27] They all cannot fit.
[1:48:29] So then the person WHO IS REASONING
[1:48:33] WILL tell you. So it means it is not
[1:48:36] true
[1:48:37] that it is only one man Noah
[1:48:41] with the answer for our generation.
[1:48:44] THERE MUST BE OTHERS. YES, THERE WERE
[1:48:47] OTHERS.
[1:48:48] BUT NOAH'S ANSWER
[1:48:51] WAS FROM the mind of God.
[1:48:55] And regardless of what the OTHER ANSWERS
[1:48:57] WERE,
[1:49:00] NOAH WAS THE VISION BEARER
[1:49:04] for his season.
[1:49:06] PEOPLE HAD TO BELIEVE HIM TO ESCAPE
[1:49:08] JUDGMENT.
[1:49:10] BUT ALSO IT SHOWS YOU GOD NEVER INTENDED
[1:49:15] TO SAVE everyone in that generation.
[1:49:18] EVEN IN OUR [screaming] GENERATION, GOD
[1:49:20] HAS NOT INTENDED
[1:49:22] TO SAVE EVERYONE.
[1:49:25] THIS MESSAGE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.
[1:49:28] SO IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, WALK AWAY
[1:49:31] SMARTLY.
[1:49:34] BUT I CAN TELL YOU, EVEN IF I CHASE YOU,
[1:49:38] IF YOU ARE MEANT TO BELIEVE IT, YOU
[1:49:40] CANNOT WALK AWAY.
[1:49:43] WHY? BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU HAVE ALWAYS
[1:49:45] BEEN A PART OF THAT.
[1:49:48] THE WORD DOES NOT COME TO SAVE PEOPLE.
[1:49:53] Let me SAY THAT AGAIN. THE WORD DOES NOT
[1:49:57] COME TO SAVE PEOPLE.
[1:50:00] THE WORD COMES FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO
[1:50:04] REDEEM THE LOST. HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:09] AMEN. [laughter]
[1:50:10] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO REDEEM THE LOST.
[1:50:14] SO we were lost.
[1:50:17] WHICH MEANS THERE IS A CERTAIN PLACE
[1:50:21] WE WERE IN BEFORE.
[1:50:24] BUT AFTER THE FALL,
[1:50:26] WE FELL FROM THAT GLORY.
[1:50:30] SO THE WORD HAS BEEN SENT TO REDEEM US
[1:50:37] BACK AGAIN TO OUR ORIGINAL PLACE.
[1:50:42] SO IN EVERY SEASON,
[1:50:45] GOD NOW SENDS ONE MAN
[1:50:48] WITH A MESSAGE. AMEN. THAT WILL BE USED
[1:50:52] TO REMIND THE PEOPLE
[1:50:55] WHO THEY WERE BEFORE THE FALL.
[1:50:59] And that message is not for everyone.
[1:51:03] It is for THE HEALING.
[1:51:06] IT is for those WHO ARE CHOSEN.
[1:51:09] ARE YOU THE CHOSEN OF THE LORD?
[1:51:12] WHEN WERE WE CHOSEN?
[1:51:14] THE BIBLE SAYS WE WERE CHOSEN
[1:51:16] [screaming]
[1:51:17] IN HIM. IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:51:22] THE WORLD.
[1:51:24] BECAUSE IF YOU SAY YOU WERE CHOSEN
[1:51:25] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[1:51:28] WHAT WAS there to choose from?
[1:51:32] Before the FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, WHAT
[1:51:34] WAS THERE TO CHOOSE FROM?
[1:51:37] IT'S NOT LIKE GOD saw many people
[1:51:40] and then he said,
[1:51:43] "Oh, no. No, IT WASN'T THAT WAY. THERE
[1:51:47] WAS NOTHING TO CHOOSE FROM.
[1:51:49] AT A TIME OR A SEASON, THERE WAS ONLY
[1:51:53] GOD.
[1:51:55] SO THERE WAS ONLY GOD TO CHOOSE FROM.
[1:51:58] SO WHEN HE CHOSE YOU, HE CHOSE HIMSELF.
[1:52:03] That is why we cannot be lost.
[1:52:07] [screaming]
[1:52:09] The elect cannot be lost.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY YOUR [screaming] WORKS.
[1:52:17] Now I'm going to say something very
[1:52:18] strong here.
[1:52:20] YOUR WORKS CANNOT SAVE YOU.
[1:52:24] BUT ALSO YOUR WORKS CANNOT DAMN YOU.
[1:52:30] That is strong. I told you.
[1:52:33] But that's not for everyone.
[1:52:36] THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH
[1:52:39] THAT ARE GOING TO BE ONLY SAVED BY THEIR
[1:52:42] WORKS.
[1:52:46] H the BIBLE SAYS BOOKS WERE OPEN AND
[1:52:50] ANOTHER BOOK WAS OPEN WHICH IS THE BOOK
[1:52:52] OF LIFE AND YOU KNOW THERE WERE MANY
[1:52:55] YOUNG AND OLD, POOR AND RICH
[1:52:58] AND THEY ALL STOOD BEFORE THE THRONE.
[1:53:02] AND THEN THE BOOKS WERE OPEN AND THEN
[1:53:04] THEY WERE JUDGED [screaming]
[1:53:07] ACCORDING TO WHAT is written in THE
[1:53:09] BOOKS
[1:53:11] according to their works.
[1:53:14] BUT THOSE PEOPLE IS SPEAKING ABOUT THERE
[1:53:18] ARE AND NOT THE BRIDE
[1:53:20] IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE OTHERS
[1:53:23] WHO WERE WHO WILL BE SAVED
[1:53:26] ACCORDING [screaming]
[1:53:27] to their works.
[1:53:30] BUT THE BRIDE IS NOT SAVED AT THAT TIME.
[1:53:35] THE BRIDE WAS ALREADY [screaming] SAVED
[1:53:39] WAY BEFORE THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT.
[1:53:45] THE BRIDE DOES NOT ACTUALLY COME BEFORE
[1:53:48] THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT.
[1:53:51] BY THAT TIME, THE BRIDE [screaming] IS
[1:53:54] ALREADY WITH THE BRIDEGROOM
[1:53:58] AND THEY ARE THE ONES ON THE OTHER SIDE
[1:54:01] TO JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD.
[1:54:04] SO WE WILL JUDGE THE [screaming] WORLD.
[1:54:08] PRAISE GOD. SO WHY? BECAUSE FOR
[1:54:11] [screaming] US OUR CASE IS DIFFERENT.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; WHY IS OUR CASE DIFFERENT?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS WE ARE A ROYAL
[1:54:22] PRIESTHOOD.
[1:54:25] WE ARE HOLY [screaming] NATION.
[1:54:28] WE ARE A PECULIAR PEOPLE.
[1:54:30] DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD [screaming]
[1:54:31] PECULIAR MEANS?
[1:54:34] IT MEANS SPECIAL.
[1:54:36] IT MEANS DIFFERENT. IT MEANS NOT LIKE
[1:54:39] EVERYTHING ELSE.
[1:54:42] HE MEANS THE CHOSEN.
[1:54:44] SO WE'RE PECULIAR.
[1:54:46] OURS OUR JUDGMENT.
[1:54:50] YOU KNOW WHERE IT HAPPENED, BROTHER?
[1:54:52] OUR JUDGMENT
[1:54:54] HAPPENED ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:59] AMEN. AMEN. BECAUSE JESUS [screaming]
[1:55:02] WAS OUR KINSMAN,
[1:55:07] REDEEMER.
[1:55:09] AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN A BROTHER FELL,
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; the law was the law of redemption WAS
[1:55:17] AMEN. HIS BROTHER
[1:55:19] WHO IS WORTHY
[1:55:21] TO REDEEM
[1:55:23] SHOULD REDEEM.
[1:55:27] AMEN. [laughter]
[1:55:28] AMEN. AND WHEN ADAM FELL, SATAN THOUGHT
[1:55:33] HE HAD FINISHED. HE HAD FINISHED IT. BUT
[1:55:36] YOU SEE, SATAN IS DUMB.
[1:55:40] AMEN. SATAN IS A FOOL.
[1:55:46] YEAH. The Bible says the fool has said
[1:55:47] in his heart there is no God.
[1:55:51] SO SATAN IS A FOOL. HE ALWAYS DOUBTED
[1:55:54] THE POSSIBILITIES AND ABILITIES OF OUR
[1:55:56] GOD. [screaming]
[1:56:00] WHEN ADAM FELL, SILENT THOUGHTS, "IT IS
[1:56:04] FINISHED." BUT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY KNOW
[1:56:07] THAT GOD HIMSELF
[1:56:10] CAN ACTUALLY [screaming] BECOME THE
[1:56:12] BROTHER OF ADAM. HALLELUJAH.
[1:56:17] SUDDENLY COULD NOT THINK ABOUT IT THAT
[1:56:19] WAY.
[1:56:21] THAT'S WHY WHEN JESUS CAME
[1:56:25] ASKING
[1:56:26] IF [screaming] YOU BE THE SON OF GOD, IF
[1:56:29] YOU BE THE SON OF GOD. HE SUSPECTED IT
[1:56:33] BUT HE DOUBTED IT. HE COULDN'T PUT IT IN
[1:56:37] HIS HEAD THAT [screaming] GOD THE
[1:56:40] CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH CAN ACTUALLY
[1:56:42] BECOME HUMAN
[1:56:44] CAN PUT ON FLESH AND COME TO DO THE WORK
[1:56:47] OF REDEMPTION.
[1:56:49] THERE WAS NO ONE WHO CAN REDEEM
[1:56:52] THERE IS NO ANGEL WHO CAN REDEEM IT.
[1:56:55] THERE IS NO MAN WHO CAN REDEEM IT. ONLY
[1:56:58] HE WAS WORTHY.
[1:57:00] WHO? GOD HIMSELF.
[1:57:02] HE PUT ON A BODY OF FLESH.
[1:57:06] AMEN. AND HE CAME AS A MAN.
[1:57:10] THAT'S WHY IN PHILIPPIANS 2, THE BIBLE
[1:57:12] SAYS, "LET THIS MIND BE IN YOU AS ALSO
[1:57:17] [screaming] IT WAS IN CHRIST.
[1:57:20] WHO BEING IN THE FORM OF GOD
[1:57:24] did not rob to be equal with God.
[1:57:28] You know what HE PUT? HE FOUND HIMSELF
[1:57:29] IN A FASHION AS A MAN,
[1:57:32] A FORM OF A SERVANT.
[1:57:35] HE HUMBLED HIMSELF.
[1:57:38] GOD IN SIMPLICITY.
[1:57:41] GOD IN SIMPLICITY.
[1:57:43] WHAT WAS HE COMING TO DO? HE WAS COMING
[1:57:46] TO BE A BROTHER.
[1:57:50] THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM,
[1:57:53] WE ALL DIE.
[1:57:55] THROUGH THE SECOND ADAM, we all live.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JESUS IS THE SECOND ADAM.
[1:58:04] YET DEAR JESUS IS GOD.
[1:58:08] SO HE WAS A GOOD MAN WHO HAD COME TO
[1:58:11] FINISH THE WORK OF REDEMPTION.
[1:58:14] SO HE HAS REDEEMED
[1:58:16] THE BIBLE SAYS BACK TO HIMSELF.
[1:58:19] SO WE ARE HIS PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHY THE
[1:58:22] BIBLE SAYS THERE IS THERE FOR NOW
[1:58:26] THIS ONE IS FINISHED IS A FINISHED WORK
[1:58:30] IT'S NOT ABOUT TO [screaming] HAPPEN
[1:58:33] THERE IS THERE ARE FOR NOW NOW
[1:58:36] CONDEMNATION
[1:58:38] TO THEM THAT ARE IN [screaming] CHRIST.
[1:58:42] WHO ARE THEY? THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE
[1:58:44] CALLED BY HIS NAME. [screaming]
[1:58:48] THE ONES WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE NAME OF
[1:58:49] JESUS
[1:58:51] IN WATER BAPTISM.
[1:58:54] AMEN. AMEN. THE ONES WHO HAVE ACCEPTED
[1:58:56] HIM AS THEIR SAVIOR. THE ONES WHO HAVE
[1:59:00] RECEIVED THE WORD
[1:59:02] OF THEIR DAY.
[1:59:06] There is there for now no condemnation.
[1:59:11] They have already passed from death to
[1:59:12] life.
[1:59:15] Which means listen, these ones are not
[1:59:20] judged like the others.
[1:59:23] These ones
[1:59:27] are judged on the cross
[1:59:30] because the redeemer.
[1:59:32] [laughter]
[1:59:35] ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? THE
[1:59:38] REDEEMER took their place.
[1:59:44] HE TOOK THEIR PLACE.
[1:59:46] SO THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE KILLED.
[1:59:48] HE DIED. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
[1:59:50] BEATEN.
[1:59:53] He was beaten.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God. BECAUSE IF WE HAD DIED,
[1:59:59] WE WOULD NOT rise again.
[2:00:02] BUT BECAUSE HE DIED AND ROSE AGAIN, IT
[2:00:05] IS AS IF WE ARE ALSO DEAD AND RISEN
[2:00:10] AGAIN.
[2:00:11] ROMANS CHAPTER 6. YOU SEE THE BIBLE SAYS
[2:00:14] WE ARE BURIED
[2:00:16] IN THE LIKENESS OF HIS DEATH.
[2:00:20] THEREFORE, WE SHALL ALSO BE IN THE
[2:00:22] LIKENESS OF HIS RESURRECTION.
[2:00:26] SO HE BECAME ME THAT I MIGHT BECOME HIM.
[2:00:30] HE BECAME SIN THAT I MIGHT BECOME THE
[2:00:33] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD.
[2:00:36] NOT HAVE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD BUT
[2:00:39] BECOME THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD.
[2:00:43] Are you HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? SO WHAT
[2:00:45] I'M SAYING IS THE BRIDE IS NOT JUDGED
[2:00:49] BY WHAT SHE HAS DONE OR BY WHAT
[2:00:52] [screaming] SHE HAS NOT DONE.
[2:00:58] MEANING YOUR WORKS,
[2:01:01] YOUR GOOD [screaming] WORKS CANNOT SAVE
[2:01:03] YOU AND YOUR BAD WORKS CANNOT DAMN YOU.
[2:01:07] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:10] But what do YOU NEED TO DO? YOU JUST
[2:01:13] NEED TO REALIZE WHO YOU ARE.
[2:01:15] WHEN YOU REALIZE WHO YOU ARE,
[2:01:17] [screaming]
[2:01:17] THEN YOU CANNOT BE BOUND ANYMORE.
[2:01:22] HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Then you be YOU YOU THE VISION IS CLEAR
[2:01:26] IN YOUR SOUL.
[2:01:29] YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING? DO YOU
[2:01:32] KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING, SAINTS?
[2:01:36] SO I'M NOT HERE STRUGGLING SO HARD
[2:01:39] TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:01:42] THE RAPTURE QUESTION IS SETTLED.
[2:01:47] I wish everyone would understand. I feel
[2:01:49] even language is lacking.
[2:01:54] I I feel like if you can if you can
[2:01:57] receive it the way I HAVE
[2:02:01] something to
[2:02:04] what WE ARE DOING NOW WE ARE NOT
[2:02:07] STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:02:09] NO NO NO NO NO NO. WE ARE NOT STRUGGLING
[2:02:12] TO MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:02:14] THAT ONE IS A FINISHED QUESTION.
[2:02:16] HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:18] BUT YOU SEE PASTOR DOES THE THING I DO
[2:02:20] IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[2:02:23] NO, THE THINGS YOU DO MATTERS.
[2:02:24] [screaming]
[2:02:26] HOW? YOU MEAN I'LL BE JUDGED BY THEM?
[2:02:29] OH, [screaming] YES, YOU WILL BE JUDGED
[2:02:31] BY THEM. EVERYTHING YOU DO, YOU'LL BE
[2:02:33] JUDGED BY IT.
[2:02:36] BUT REMEMBER, NOT JUDGMENT [screaming]
[2:02:39] UNTO CONDEMNATION.
[2:02:42] THE BRIDE WILL BE JUDGED.
[2:02:45] APOSTLE PAUL SAID, AND HE'S ONE OF THE
[2:02:47] BRIDE MEMBERS. HE SAID, "WE WILL ALL
[2:02:51] COME [screaming] INTO THE JUDGMENT SEAT
[2:02:53] OF CHRIST.
[2:02:55] BUT THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST IS NOT A
[2:02:59] WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT.
[2:03:01] DON'T CONFUSE THE TWO.
[2:03:04] THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT IS A JUDGMENT
[2:03:07] UNTO CONDEMNATION.
[2:03:10] They [screaming] will be thrown into
[2:03:11] hellfire.
[2:03:13] AND A FEW WILL BE GIVEN LIFE BECAUSE OF
[2:03:17] THEIR GOOD WORKS.
[2:03:19] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT SAINTS, WE ARE NOT
[2:03:22] GOING TO COME TO THAT WHITE THRONE
[2:03:24] JUDGMENT.
[2:03:27] OUR JUDGMENT
[2:03:29] IS GOING TO BE ON THE ON THE JUDGMENT
[2:03:30] SEAT OF CHRIST.
[2:03:33] AND WHEN IS THAT HAPPENING IS HAPPENING
[2:03:36] IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:03:38] IT'S HAPPENING IN THE RAPTURE.
[2:03:40] IT'S THE VERY FIRST THING TO HAPPEN.
[2:03:44] CALL IT LIKE A REAL WORLD CEREMONY.
[2:03:50] AMEN. AMEN. WHERE YOU WILL BE REWARDED.
[2:03:54] YOU KNOW THE MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT IDEA.
[2:03:57] BUT YOU SEE they don't THEY HAVE
[2:03:58] EVERYTHING MIXED UP.
[2:04:00] WE ALSO BELIEVE EVERY GOOD THING YOU DO
[2:04:04] YOU WILL BE REWARDED AND EVERY BAD THING
[2:04:07] YOU DO YOU WILL BE DEMOTED.
[2:04:10] BUT THE QUESTION OF ETERNAL LIFE
[2:04:13] IS NOT A GIVEN THERE.
[2:04:16] THAT ONE IS A MUST TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE
[2:04:20] IN CHRIST.
[2:04:21] SO WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE
[2:04:22] RAPTURE,
[2:04:24] YOU ARE GOING IN RAPTURE
[2:04:27] BECAUSE OF [screaming] WHO YOU ARE.
[2:04:30] THAT IS NOT A QUESTION.
[2:04:32] SO SHOULD I MIND ABOUT THE THINGS I DO?
[2:04:36] OH YES, I SHOULD BECAUSE IF I DON'T DO
[2:04:39] THE RIGHT THINGS,
[2:04:41] I MAY BE FOUND UP THERE
[2:04:44] AND THEN INSTEAD OF BECOMING A GENERAL,
[2:04:47] I MAY BECOME A CORPORAL.
[2:04:51] SOME OF YOU HAVE DONE A LOT FOR THE
[2:04:52] LORD.
[2:04:54] BUT IF YOU DID MANY MANY MANY MORE BAD
[2:04:56] THINGS,
[2:04:58] he realize YOU CAN BECOME A PRIVATE.
[2:05:05] no rank.
[2:05:08] Yet he did so much FOR THE LORD. SO WE
[2:05:11] SHOULD WALK IN FEAR.
[2:05:13] WE SHOULD WALK RIGHT. We should live
[2:05:16] PEACEABLE WITH ALL MEN.
[2:05:18] WE SHOULD DO GOOD THINGS, GOOD WORKS.
[2:05:21] BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WILL COUNT
[2:05:23] IN HEAVEN.
[2:05:27] SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IN HEAVEN ALL OF
[2:05:29] US ARE GOING TO BE EQUAL.
[2:05:32] NO. SORRY. NO, WE ARE NOT EVEN EQUAL
[2:05:35] HERE.
[2:05:37] WHAT IS HERE REFLECTS WHAT IS THERE?
[2:05:40] THE NATURAL TYPE THE SPIRITUAL.
[2:05:44] PRAISE GOD. YES SIR. SO EVEN IN HEAVEN
[2:05:48] WHAT WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE IS GOING TO
[2:05:51] BE DETERMINED BY HOW WE LIVED HERE.
[2:05:57] But the QUESTION OF ETERNAL LIFE,
[2:06:00] THE QUESTION OF THE RAPTURE,
[2:06:02] DON'T [screaming] EVER WORRY ABOUT IT.
[2:06:06] IF YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, I AM
[2:06:09] PRONOUNCING TO YOU, YOU ARE GOING
[2:06:11] [screaming] TO THE RAPTURE.
[2:06:15] CAN YOU SHOUT AMEN?
[2:06:18] [screaming] THAT IS NOT A QUESTION.
[2:06:21] SO NEVER LET THE DEVIL EVEN MAKE YOU
[2:06:24] DOWN.
[2:06:27] IF YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, you know where
[2:06:29] you're going. Amen. It's like if you're
[2:06:33] a wife of somebody
[2:06:35] but you behave bad, you don't make him
[2:06:38] happy. You always make his children sad.
[2:06:41] Everything is not good in the home. YOU
[2:06:44] YOU STILL REMAIN A WIFE. A GOOD
[2:06:47] CHRISTIAN will not divorce you.
[2:06:50] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:06:52] HE WILL NOT BUY YOU AS MUCH GIFTS.
[2:06:55] He will not reward you with as much
[2:06:57] love,
[2:06:59] but you ARE STILL HIS WIFE.
[2:07:01] AND WE HAVE MANY homes and FAMILIES LIKE
[2:07:03] THAT
[2:07:05] WHERE PEOPLE are married, but their
[2:07:06] marriage is dull.
[2:07:11] There's no joy BECAUSE THE WIFE IS NOT
[2:07:14] BEING A GOOD WIFE.
[2:07:16] THE HUSBAND IS NOT BEING A GOOD HUSBAND.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME CHURCH. WE AS
[2:07:22] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, HE CANNOT DIVORCE
[2:07:24] US. BUT YOU KNOW [screaming] WHAT? HE
[2:07:27] HAD ONE WOMAN WHO he divorced first.
[2:07:31] HE CAN ONLY DIVORCE YOU [screaming] ON
[2:07:33] ONE BASIS.
[2:07:36] IF YOU REJECT HIS WIFE,
[2:07:39] IF YOU REJECT HIS SEED,
[2:07:41] THEN HE WILL DIVORCE YOU. WHY? HE WANTS
[2:07:45] A WIFE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE HIS
[2:07:49] SEED, TO TAKE HIS WORD AND BRING FORTH
[2:07:53] FRUITS.
[2:07:55] [screaming] AMEN. BUT HE THAT REJECTS
[2:07:57] HIS WORD, THAT HE WILL KICK HER OUT. HE
[2:08:01] WILL TELL HER, [screaming] "I'M SORRY,
[2:08:03] YOU ARE NOT A PART OF ME."
[2:08:05] AND THEN HE WILL TELL THOSE, "COME OUT
[2:08:08] OF HER, MY PEOPLE. COME AND BE A PART OF
[2:08:11] ME.
[2:08:12] LET US S TOGETHER. HE [screaming] WANTS
[2:08:15] A WIFE THAT WILL HEAR THE WORD AND
[2:08:18] RECEIVE THE WORD AND BELIEVE THE WORD.
[2:08:21] SO IF YOU'RE THE KIND THAT LOVES THE
[2:08:24] WORD, BELIEVES THE WORD, THEN YOU WILL
[2:08:27] NEVER BE DIVORCED.
[2:08:31] HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; You can't be DIVORCED because you're the
[2:08:36] bride. YOU ARE HIS WIFE. BUT YOU SEE THE
[2:08:39] WAY YOU BEHAVE
[2:08:41] will matter how you will live with him.
[2:08:47] Amen.
[2:08:48] Oh my.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? May God help us
[2:08:54] we may live worthy of our calling.
[2:09:01] So see the vision is
[2:09:04] to go back with him.
[2:09:07] The vision is to be restored back. And
[2:09:12] on Sunday we talked about the
[2:09:13] restoration part.
[2:09:16] And told you the purpose of this message
[2:09:18] we are preaching
[2:09:21] is to be restored back again
[2:09:24] to the foundation of our fathers.
[2:09:27] And we talked about how we are going to
[2:09:29] be restored.
[2:09:32] And I showed you that God WOULD ALSO
[2:09:34] SEND ONE MAN
[2:09:36] LIKE HE DID IN THE DAYS OF NOAH. HE WILL
[2:09:39] ALSO DO IN OUR DAY
[2:09:41] AND HE WILL SEND ONE MAN. EVERYBODY SAY
[2:09:44] ONE MAN, ONE MAN IN OUR GENERATION
[2:09:48] WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION.
[2:09:52] HE WOULD HAVE THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH.
[2:09:56] HIS MINISTRY WOULD BE IN THE POWER AND
[2:09:58] IN THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH.
[2:10:02] AND THIS ONE MAN WILL BRING THE SEED
[2:10:05] WORD
[2:10:08] and you know IT WILL BE RECORDED ON
[2:10:09] TAPES AND BOOKS
[2:10:12] AND DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE [screaming]
[2:10:14] WORLD.
[2:10:16] AND I TELL YOU WHAT, THERE ARE PEOPLE
[2:10:18] ALMOST EVERYWHERE
[2:10:20] WHO HAVE RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE.
[2:10:23] SOMETIMES YOU GO [screaming] IN PLACES
[2:10:25] WHERE YOU THINK THEY ARE NOT BELIEVERS
[2:10:27] OF THIS MESSAGE. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT,
[2:10:29] THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.
[2:10:32] ON EVERY CONTINENT
[2:10:34] ON IN EVERY CITY.
[2:10:38] GOD HAS HIS EAR
[2:10:40] EVERYWHERE. [screaming]
[2:10:42] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE HAVE MANY THINGS
[2:10:44] IN COMMON
[2:10:45] BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME
[2:10:47] MESSAGE.
[2:10:49] WHETHER THEY ARE WHITE, WHERE THEY BLACK
[2:10:52] OR THEY ARE YELLOW, YOU WILL FIND THERE
[2:10:54] ARE WOMEN NOT WEARING PANTS OR TROUSERS.
[2:11:01] ALL THE WOMEN DON'T DO MAKEUP,
[2:11:06] white or black.
[2:11:09] THEY DON'T WEAR EARRINGS
[2:11:11] BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A SIGN OF
[2:11:14] SLAVERY.
[2:11:17] SLAVE FOREVER.
[2:11:19] IT'S IN THE BIBLE. WE KNOW THAT. SO YOU
[2:11:23] FIND THEIR THEIR HUSBANDS,
[2:11:26] YOU KNOW, ARE MARRIED TO ONE WIFE.
[2:11:30] RIGHT? YOU FIND THAT DEACONS ARE NOT
[2:11:33] MURDERED TWICE OR THRICE,
[2:11:37] MARRIED ONCE WITH ONE WIFE.
[2:11:41] THEY ARE WOMEN KNOW THEIR POSITION IN
[2:11:43] THE FAMILY.
[2:11:45] THEIR SISTERS, THE WOMEN, THEY DON'T CUT
[2:11:47] OFF THEIR HAIR. WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE
[2:11:50] BEEN RESTORED BACK [screaming] TO THE
[2:11:51] BIBLE. PIGEONS, THEY KNOW THAT HAIR IS A
[2:11:56] WOMAN'S GLORY.
[2:11:58] SO THEY KEEP THEIR HAIR LONG
[2:12:01] AND SO THEY ALL KNOW THEY ARE THE BRIDE
[2:12:05] AND THEY LOVE THE WORD AND THEY ALL
[2:12:08] BELIEVE IN THE HOLY GHOST AND I RECEIVE
[2:12:10] THE HOLY GHOST AND THE FRUITS OF JESUS
[2:12:14] is manifesting through them. It doesn't
[2:12:17] matter where you go, you will find that.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. YOU WILL NOT FIND THEIR
[2:12:26] WOMEN WEARING IN SKIMPY CLOTHES,
[2:12:31] MINI SKIRTS.
[2:12:33] IT DOESN'T MATTER. GO TO INDIA. GO TO
[2:12:36] AMERICA. YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT TO CHINA
[2:12:38] ONE TIME, I ARRIVED IN THIS CITY CALLED
[2:12:42] SHENZEN.
[2:12:44] And as soon AS I CAME OUT of the train,
[2:12:49] I SAW COVERING MY EYES.
[2:12:52] I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH FOR A while
[2:12:57] you know China is one of those cities
[2:12:59] with a lot of people
[2:13:01] countries rather
[2:13:03] so when I reach there unlike many of the
[2:13:06] western countries where you even have to
[2:13:07] ask where are the people
[2:13:12] [laughter] you know we're used to many
[2:13:13] people here in Uganda so when you travel
[2:13:16] TO THE WEST YOU REALIZE WHERE WHERE ARE
[2:13:18] ALL THE
[2:13:23] THE PEOPLE ARE SO FEW. BUT IN CHINA,
[2:13:26] THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. SO YOU
[2:13:28] WALK INTO THE STREET, YOU HAVE TO I
[2:13:30] COVERED my eyes
[2:13:32] until my brother asked me, "Are you
[2:13:35] having headache?
[2:13:37] What's wrong with you?" BECAUSE I WAS
[2:13:39] WALKING LIKE THIS.
[2:13:42] WHY? BECAUSE EVERYWHERE YOU YOU look
[2:13:46] bikini bikini bikini bikini BIKINI
[2:13:48] BIKINI BIKINI, PEOPLE ARE NAKED ON THE
[2:13:50] STREETS
[2:13:52] because it is hot.
[2:13:55] NAKED.
[2:13:57] OH MY GOD. SAID I'M COMING FROM AFRICA.
[2:14:00] WE ARE MORE distant than this. EVEN IN
[2:14:03] THE WORLD THEY DON'T DRESS LIKE THAT.
[2:14:07] But you see what?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; WHILE I WAS THERE WAITING
[2:14:12] THEN THIS SISTER CAME FOR ME.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; You know she was riding a bike.
[2:14:18] Very nice sister.
[2:14:20] I DID NOT NEED TO ASK ARE YOU A
[2:14:22] BELIEVER?
[2:14:25] She couldn't even speak English.
[2:14:29] But you know she came for me at THE
[2:14:31] TRAIN STATION. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I SAW
[2:14:34] HER AND I KNEW SHE'S A BELIEVER BECAUSE
[2:14:37] OF THE WAY SHE WAS DRESSED.
[2:14:39] I JUST [screaming] SAW AND I SAID AH GOD
[2:14:42] BLESS YOU.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; SHE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY KNEW WHY BECAUSE
[2:14:45] WE HAVE THE SAME SPARE. [screaming]
[2:14:50] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN WE GO TO THE
[2:14:52] OTHER LAND,
[2:14:54] WE WILL be the same as we have the same
[2:14:56] year.
[2:14:58] SO THAT'S why you SHOULD ALWAYS LEAVE
[2:15:00] YOUR SINS FOR THE BLOOD TO COME.
[2:15:04] And always LOOK AT THE VISION WHERE
[2:15:06] YOU'RE GOING.
[2:15:09] AMEN. AMEN. SO NOW WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A
[2:15:11] MESSAGE AND THIS MESSAGE IS THE SAME
[2:15:14] MESSAGE
[2:15:16] BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE not converted.
[2:15:19] THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY TO PERVERT THE
[2:15:21] MESSAGE
[2:15:23] you know to try and bring in a doctrine
[2:15:25] here doctrine there.
[2:15:27] But I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR DOCTRINE. I
[2:15:30] AM ONE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN PREACHING THE
[2:15:33] FULL COUNEL OF THE MESSAGE.
[2:15:38] THE MESSAGE IS NOT A DOCTRINE.
[2:15:42] THE MESSAGE IS A LIFE.
[2:15:46] YOU KNOW THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST.
[2:15:49] AMEN. Are you getting a point? SO WHEN
[2:15:52] YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE, YOU REALIZE
[2:15:54] YOUR POSITION.
[2:15:59] Praise God.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; So a man called William Brham
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; happens TO BE THAT PROPHET THAT GOD SAID
[2:16:07] IN OUR GENERATION. YOU KNOW LIKE JOHN
[2:16:11] [screaming] HE WAS NOT THAT LIGHT
[2:16:13] BUT HE WAS SENT TO BEAR WITNESS OF THAT
[2:16:18] LIGHT.
[2:16:21] WHAT IS THE LIGHT? JESUS IS THE LIGHT.
[2:16:25] HE'S THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. HE HAS
[2:16:28] SHINE IN THE DARKNESS. BUT THE PEOPLE
[2:16:31] HAVE LOVED THE DARKNESS MORE THAN THE
[2:16:32] LIGHT.
[2:16:35] BUT UNTO YOU [screaming]
[2:16:37] THAT HAVE RECEIVED HIM, WHO JESUS CHRIST
[2:16:40] I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE'S THE
[2:16:42] LIGHT. UNTO YOU THAT HAVE RECEIVED HIM.
[2:16:45] TO YOU, HE HAS GIVEN YOU POWER TO BECOME
[2:16:50] SONS OF GOD.
[2:16:53] AMEN.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; I AM A SON OF GOD. YOU ARE A SON OF GOD.
[2:16:58] WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE REALIZED YOUR
[2:17:00] [screaming] IDENTITY.
[2:17:04] SOME OF YOU
[2:17:06] EVEN HAVE HABITS.
[2:17:08] MAYBE
[2:17:11] WHATEVER. LET ME TELL YOU,
[2:17:14] if this message is revealed to you, you
[2:17:17] don't mind,
[2:17:19] don't even put your thoughts on it. LOOK
[2:17:22] THE VISION.
[2:17:26] BECAUSE HE HAS REDEEMED you
[2:17:28] because he's taking you somewhere.
[2:17:31] That's why I don't believe in taking
[2:17:34] time
[2:17:36] of the people reminding them of how bad
[2:17:38] they are.
[2:17:42] You know you are fornicators.
[2:17:46] Stop it. You are drunkard. Stop it.
[2:17:49] You you you you are what is it? What
[2:17:52] else?
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THIEF STORY
[2:17:56] YOU ARE. LOOK, I've come because I know
[2:18:00] you know I I believe all of you know
[2:18:04] your darker spot.
[2:18:07] I don't need TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE
[2:18:09] YOU YOURSELF you know even the devil
[2:18:11] knows. Even God knows. So why do you
[2:18:15] come TO CHURCH? YOU COME TO CHURCH SO
[2:18:18] YOU CAN really truly be reminded of your
[2:18:21] true identity.
[2:18:26] So you can focus on THE VISION
[2:18:29] BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. YOU WILL REALIZE
[2:18:32] THESE LITTLE THINGS cannot matter
[2:18:34] anymore.
[2:18:38] Why? Because you would have overcome
[2:18:39] them.
[2:18:42] Tell your neighbor we are overcoming.
[2:18:44] We are overcoming.
[2:18:46] Come on, turn to your neighbor and show
[2:18:47] THEM WE ARE OVERCOMING. SOME BELIEVERS I
[2:18:50] DON'T KNOW SAY NO ME I'VE COME TO CHURCH
[2:18:53] ALONE.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be distracted. My
[2:18:57] neighbor maybe my neighbor is a sister.
[2:19:00] What is WRONG WITH YOU? TELL A SISTER
[2:19:03] I'M OVERCOMING.
[2:19:08] AMEN. I will SEND YOU ELIJAH THE
[2:19:11] PROPHET.
[2:19:12] YOU KNOW, some believers don't even
[2:19:13] believe that sisters and brothers should
[2:19:15] mix in.
[2:19:20] We are not Muslims.
[2:19:29] Hallelujah.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not stepping on anyone's
[2:19:32] tonight.
[2:19:35] When you come to church, sit where you
[2:19:38] feel comfortable.
[2:19:40] Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Don't allow the deacon to force you
[2:19:44] where you don't want.
[2:19:48] Sit where you feel comfortable. Surely
[2:19:50] if you are a sincere brother,
[2:19:52] you cannot sit near a breastfeeding
[2:19:54] mother.
[2:19:57] It means you have something wrong with
[2:19:59] you.
[2:20:04] Find a place where you are comfortable
[2:20:06] to hear the word very well. Why would
[2:20:09] you want to be exactly exactly near
[2:20:11] brother Mary's WIFE
[2:20:15] EVERY TIME?
[2:20:17] SURELY surely there should be a problem.
[2:20:21] Sit in a place where you're comfortable
[2:20:23] enough to focus on the word
[2:20:28] not comfortable enough to mind other
[2:20:29] things.
[2:20:34] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A BONUS.
[2:20:38] So Elijah the prophet we talked about
[2:20:40] him and how God promised HIM BUT YOU
[2:20:44] KNOW remember we were talking about a
[2:20:46] vision and we were trying to talk about
[2:20:49] Israel
[2:20:51] how God was dealing with them as a type
[2:20:54] on how he's dealing with the gentile
[2:20:55] church.
[2:20:58] So God sent Moses
[2:21:01] with with a message that would
[2:21:02] accomplish what God had envisioned for
[2:21:04] his people Israel. ALWAYS
[2:21:10] REMEMBER GOD DEALS WITH ISRAEL AS A
[2:21:12] NATION
[2:21:15] while he deals WITH US THE GENTILES AS
[2:21:17] individuals
[2:21:21] in the in faith cometh by hearing. HE
[2:21:22] SAYS, "IF THERE BE ONE WHO IS SPIRITUAL
[2:21:25] OR A PROPHET AMONG YOU,
[2:21:29] I the Lord WILL MAKE MYSELF KNOWN UNTO
[2:21:30] HIM IN visions
[2:21:33] and so forth. BUT FOR MY SERVANT MOSES,
[2:21:36] NOT. SO HE SAID, "I SPEAK lip to ear
[2:21:40] with him."
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "DON'T YOU FEAR GOD, SEEING
[2:21:45] WHAT I'VE CHOSEN THIS MAN?"
[2:21:49] And Mariam, MIRIAM RATHER, WAS BROKEN
[2:21:52] OUT WITH LIPOS
[2:21:55] BECAUSE THESE ONES WERE TRYING TO MOVE
[2:21:57] POLITICALLY TO MANEUVER
[2:22:02] AGAINST THE PROPHET OF GOD.
[2:22:06] AND GOD STRUCK MIRIAM WITH LEPROSY.
[2:22:09] HE SAID TO EVERYBODY ELSE, I SPEAK.
[2:22:13] Listen church. When we say GOD USES ONE
[2:22:16] MAN IN a generation,
[2:22:19] it does not mean there are not others
[2:22:21] he's using.
[2:22:23] That's why we have a you know that kind
[2:22:26] of spirit
[2:22:28] THAT HAS CREPT IN
[2:22:30] SAYING THAT ONLY BROTHER BHAM CAN PREACH
[2:22:35] and so we play only tapes
[2:22:37] because brother Bham died more than 50
[2:22:39] YEARS AGO.
[2:22:41] SO WHAT I DECIDE TO DO THEY PLAY TAPES
[2:22:45] THE SONG LEADER WILL COME AND SONG LEAD
[2:22:49] brother shalom shalom and then he says
[2:22:51] let's now welcome our pastor
[2:22:53] and then they put the table brother
[2:22:56] but that's not APOSTOLIC
[2:23:00] THAT'S NOT RIGHT
[2:23:02] GOD STILL [screaming] USES OTHER MEN
[2:23:05] ARE YOU hearing me
[2:23:07] EVEN IN THE DAYS OF BROTHER
[2:23:10] HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE PREACHING IN THE
[2:23:12] TABERNACLE.
[2:23:14] YOU WILL SAY, WELL, [screaming] OTHERS
[2:23:16] WERE PREACHING IN HIS ABSENCE.
[2:23:19] NO, EVEN IN HIS PRESENCE, HE WOULD SIT
[2:23:23] DOWN. AND OTHER PEOPLE LIKE BROTHER
[2:23:25] NEVILLE, THE pastor
[2:23:28] would preach and THEN HE WOULD COME IN
[2:23:30] THE AFTERNOON AND SAY, "OH MY, I SO
[2:23:33] ENJOY THAT MESSAGE, BROTHER NEVILLE."
[2:23:37] AND OUT OF IT
[2:23:39] I PICKED THIS INSPIRATION.
[2:23:42] ARE YOU HEARING ME? THAT'S HOW GOD
[2:23:44] WORKS. THERE ARE MANY OTHER PREACHERS
[2:23:47] WHO ARE PREACHING. BROTHER ORDAINED MANY
[2:23:49] PASTORS AND PREACHERS RIGHT NOW
[2:23:52] TO DO WHAT? TO SERVE TES
[2:23:57] TO SERVE TES
[2:23:59] BUT ALSO TO PREACH WHAT IS ON THE TEXT.
[2:24:02] [screaming]
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Your amens ARE VERY LAZY.
[2:24:07] YOU BETTER HAVE A VERY GOOD HEALTHY
[2:24:09] AMEN.
[2:24:13] You see, I speak lip TO NOW WHEN GOD
[2:24:16] SENDS OTHERS.
[2:24:19] He uses them with little gifts here and
[2:24:22] there
[2:24:23] like maybe the little I have one of
[2:24:25] those little gifts.
[2:24:27] Another preacher somewhere has another
[2:24:29] little gift. Another pastor has a little
[2:24:31] gift. Someone else has a vision. Someone
[2:24:33] has it.
[2:24:34] BUT YOU SEE, WHEN IT COMES TO A MAJOR
[2:24:37] PROPHET OF THE AGE,
[2:24:40] GOD SPEAKS DIRECTLY WITH HIM,
[2:24:45] sleep [screaming] to ear.
[2:24:48] NO MAN CAN REPLACE THAT MAN.
[2:24:52] AND WHEN THE MAN GOES, HIS MESSAGE STILL
[2:24:56] STANDS
[2:24:58] because this MAN IS THE VISION BEARER.
[2:25:03] PRAISE GOD. Now you know why we say
[2:25:06] brother Bham says and we quote
[2:25:12] because you need to hear it yourself.
[2:25:14] Matter of fact, you need to go and read
[2:25:15] it yourself.
[2:25:19] Go and read it. Go and listen to it
[2:25:22] yourself.
[2:25:23] You cannot be a believer without
[2:25:24] listening or hearing or reading.
[2:25:28] You will you you will not grow.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; You need to read and listen and for
[2:25:35] yourself
[2:25:37] look at the journey of Israel. You know
[2:25:40] they depart from Egypt the plagues and
[2:25:43] you know there were plagues and then God
[2:25:46] uses their man
[2:25:49] you see to apply the blood.
[2:25:53] Only Moses KNEW THIS SECRET.
[2:25:56] YOU ALWAYS remember everyone had lambs
[2:25:58] and hs
[2:26:01] but they couldn't apply it correctly
[2:26:05] to survive the death in the camp.
[2:26:09] So because they DIDN'T HAVE WHAT
[2:26:12] A prophet
[2:26:14] someone missed it
[2:26:16] in Egypt.
[2:26:19] God told Moses, "Tell them to eat bitter
[2:26:22] habs.
[2:26:24] Tell them to also You know, kill the
[2:26:26] lambs,
[2:26:28] a family a lamb and let them eat it
[2:26:32] together with bitter habs.
[2:26:35] Let them finish it. The blood applied
[2:26:39] the door.
[2:26:43] I want to ask you a question. The Jews,
[2:26:45] the Israelites were living in Gan.
[2:26:50] Were they the only ones with lambs?
[2:26:56] Were they the only ones with bitter
[2:26:58] habs?
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Why is it then
[2:27:04] that all the house of the Egyptians
[2:27:07] when the age of death came
[2:27:10] there was death in the camp of the
[2:27:12] Egyptians.
[2:27:14] But in the house of the Jews,
[2:27:17] Israelites,
[2:27:19] there was no death. Why?
[2:27:23] Can someone tell me
[2:27:29] thank you?
[2:27:30] God bless you
[2:27:33] because they had a problem
[2:27:36] in the camp.
[2:27:39] Amen. So what's the difference?
[2:27:42] God had whispered to him
[2:27:46] to [laughter]
[2:27:48] the lambs.
[2:27:52] the lambs
[2:27:54] and the bitter herbs which they had
[2:28:00] for years.
[2:28:02] They did not know how to apply
[2:28:07] these lamps.
[2:28:09] In it
[2:28:10] was blood,
[2:28:12] but they did not know what to do with
[2:28:14] the blood.
[2:28:17] For them, they would eat it.
[2:28:20] Sometimes they would, you know, throw it
[2:28:22] away
[2:28:24] because they did not know how to apply.
[2:28:27] Listen, the denominations
[2:28:29] have had this Bible
[2:28:32] for years
[2:28:35] even before the prophet of this
[2:28:36] generation came.
[2:28:39] But they read it. But do you know what?
[2:28:43] They still baptize babies
[2:28:45] reading this Bible.
[2:28:50] They the women are pastors.
[2:28:54] If we were one of those, I would imagine
[2:28:57] my wife here
[2:28:59] in a skimpy, you know, something
[2:29:04] with longer nails.
[2:29:06] Believers these days also want their to
[2:29:08] be long.
[2:29:10] Let me tell you that this year is coming
[2:29:12] on you.
[2:29:14] RUN FOR YOUR [screaming] LIFE.
[2:29:18] SEE WITH LONGER NAILS,
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; painted face,
[2:29:23] painted lips
[2:29:26] looks so red.
[2:29:30] [snorts]
[2:29:32] Imagine yourself like that.
[2:29:34] Then you come, praise God.
[2:29:39] Today,
[2:29:41] God is going to do something for you.
[2:29:46] GOD SPOKE to me sister where did he find
[2:29:49] you
[2:29:51] and he sent me to you was that God
[2:29:56] but that's what is happening in
[2:29:57] Australia
[2:29:58] why
[2:30:00] they don't know how to apply the Bible
[2:30:04] when they read the Bible they cannot see
[2:30:08] that that's not the place of our sisters
[2:30:12] you find deacons who are married more
[2:30:14] than once or twice.
[2:30:17] Married, divorce, married, divorce and
[2:30:19] this brother is a deacon
[2:30:23] because he has money.
[2:30:27] Why they they they their eyes are blind.
[2:30:31] But here brothers and sisters like in
[2:30:34] many places all over the world.
[2:30:38] You know I always want to add that if
[2:30:41] you have a visa they may say oh they
[2:30:43] think they they are the ark of Noah. No
[2:30:45] we are not.
[2:30:48] This is just one little place. There are
[2:30:51] many other big little places and other
[2:30:53] bigger ones all over the world
[2:30:56] that preach this message.
[2:30:59] But you know what? We have a prophet.
[2:31:02] Turn to your neighbor. Tell them we have
[2:31:03] a prophet.
[2:31:05] Tell them we HAVE A PROPHET. WE HAVE A
[2:31:07] [screaming] PROPHET.
[2:31:10] HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; AND THIS PROPHET HAS HELPED US
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; TO KNOW HOW TO [screaming] APPLY THE
[2:31:17] BLOOD IN THE WORLD.
[2:31:22] THEY ARE [screaming] READING FROM A
[2:31:24] CLOSED BOOK.
[2:31:27] WE ARE READING FROM AN OPEN BOOK.
[2:31:32] I SAID THE BOOK IS OPEN.
[2:31:35] THE BOOK IS OPEN.
[2:31:37] I AM EXCITED ABOUT IT. NOW WE
[2:31:40] [screaming] KNOW THERE IS NOT TWO OR
[2:31:42] THREE GODS.
[2:31:44] THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD
[2:31:47] AND HIS NAME IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[2:31:51] NOW WE KNOW, [screaming]
[2:31:52] AMEN, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BAPTIZED IN
[2:31:55] MUCH WATER IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS
[2:31:57] CHRIST.
[2:31:59] AMEN. [screaming] NOW WE KNOW WE ARE
[2:32:00] GOING IN THE RAPTURE. NOW WE KNOW WE ARE
[2:32:03] NOT JUST THE CHURCH.
[2:32:05] WE ARE THE BRIDE. [screaming]
[2:32:07] WE ARE THE WIFE OF THE LAMB.
[2:32:10] REVELATION 19:7.
[2:32:12] AMEN. THE [screaming] MARRIAGE OF THE
[2:32:14] LAMB IS COME
[2:32:16] AND HIS WIFE
[2:32:18] has made herself ready.
[2:32:21] I SAY HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE READ THE BIBLE
[2:32:26] TO US IT IS [screaming] NOT CLOSED
[2:32:30] to us. It is unopened.
[2:32:34] Why? Because we HAVE A PROPHET. YOU see
[2:32:39] that's how we depart from Egypt.
[2:32:41] They had a prophet. That's the journey.
[2:32:45] Then they had to cross the Red Sea. The
[2:32:47] pill of fire positioned itself be beside
[2:32:49] them
[2:32:51] to keep the Egyptians away
[2:32:54] while the Israelites crossed over.
[2:32:57] ALSO SEE HOW GOD FOUGHT FOR THEM THROUGH
[2:32:59] THE THEIR VISION.
[2:33:03] God always vindicates his prophets.
[2:33:06] Amen. AND PHARAOH CHANGED HIS MIND AND
[2:33:09] HE CAME HE HAD LET THEM GO BUT NOW HE
[2:33:12] CAME AT THEM HE PURSUED THEM YOU KNOW
[2:33:16] BUT MOSES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND I
[2:33:20] WANT TO show you SOMETHING CHURCH
[2:33:22] THE PIT OF fire
[2:33:26] hallelujah this is the part that is MY
[2:33:28] FAVORITE
[2:33:30] AT FIRST THE pit of fire was going you
[2:33:33] know in AHEAD OF
[2:33:37] BUT WHEN PHARAOH DECIDED TO COME AND
[2:33:38] PURSUE THEM,
[2:33:41] you know, don't worry about that spirit
[2:33:43] or that devil that is pursuing
[2:33:47] because we have the pit of fire.
[2:33:50] Hallelujah.
[2:33:52] Do you have that picture of the pill of
[2:33:53] fire, brother?
[2:33:55] We have the pit of fire WITH US.
[2:33:58] THE PILL of fire IS STILL IN THE CAMP
[2:34:00] TODAY.
[2:34:03] AMEN.
[2:34:04] AND YOU OF FIRE WENT RIGHT BEHIND THEM.
[2:34:09] THEY [screaming] COULD NOT SEE IT
[2:34:11] ANYMORE.
[2:34:13] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IN THE PIT OF FIRE,
[2:34:17] GOD LOOKED AT them like THIS
[2:34:21] AND HE DESTROYED THEM ONE BY ONE.
[2:34:25] WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE THE PILL OF FIRE
[2:34:27] WITH OUR NAKED EYES.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; IS BEHIND US DESTROYING OUR ENEMIES ON
[2:34:33] OUR BEHALF.
[2:34:35] GOD IS WITH US. GOD IS IN THE CAMP. THIS
[2:34:39] WORD IS ANOINTED
[2:34:41] TO DESTROY OUR ENEMIES.
[2:34:45] AMEN. And then they reached the
[2:34:46] wilderness of Shu.
[2:34:49] It was quite A JOURNEY. THREE DAYS
[2:34:52] WITHOUT WATER.
[2:34:54] GOD THROUGH THE MESSENGER.
[2:34:57] THE WATER WAS BITTER.
[2:34:59] SO THEY COULDN'T DRINK FOR THREE DAYS.
[2:35:03] BUT THAT'S WHY GOD SENT A PROPHET
[2:35:06] BECAUSE PROPHET MOSES CAME OUT AND HE
[2:35:09] [screaming] TOUCHED THE WATER AND THE
[2:35:12] WATERS BECAME SWEET.
[2:35:16] SO I CAN SAY GOD [screaming]
[2:35:19] THROUGH THEIR PROPHET MESSENGER
[2:35:22] SWEETENED THE BITTER WATERS OF MARA.
[2:35:25] [screaming]
[2:35:28] DO YOU HAVE SOME BITTER WATERS TODAY?
[2:35:32] AMEN. THE BITTER WATERS IN MY LIFE.
[2:35:36] HE HAS SUITED FOR ME
[2:35:38] BY THIS MESSAGE OF YOUR
[2:35:41] GIVE SOMEONE A HIGH FIVE. SAY AMEN.
[2:35:45] GLORY. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN.
[2:35:47] GIVE US MY BITTER WATERS OF MOUTH.
[2:35:51] AND THEN THEY CAME TO THE place called
[2:35:55] the wilderness of sin.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; THEY LACKED FOOD
[2:36:00] DESPITE THEIR COMPLAINTS.
[2:36:03] GOD THROUGH THEIR MESSENGER.
[2:36:06] MOSES, YOU KNOW, HE SUPPLIED MANA
[2:36:10] AND [screaming] LATER ON HE SUPPLIED
[2:36:11] QUILLS.
[2:36:15] OH, are you not surprised that even in
[2:36:18] our days
[2:36:20] brother
[2:36:23] in our day we have had spiritual food
[2:36:28] IN THIS SEASON.
[2:36:31] LET THEM STARVE
[2:36:33] BUT WE CANNOT STARVE
[2:36:35] BECAUSE WE HAVE SPIRITUAL FOOD IN DUE
[2:36:38] SEASON. IF YOU CAN'T REJOICE BECAUSE OF
[2:36:41] THIS
[2:36:42] I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN MOVE [screaming]
[2:36:44] YOUR HEART.
[2:36:45] BUT FOR ME, I AM MOVED BY THIS MESSAGE
[2:36:47] OF THE HOUR.
[2:36:50] And then they CAME TO MOUNT SI.
[2:36:52] GOD THROUGH MOSES CONFIRMS AND
[2:36:55] ESTABLISHES HIS COVENANT with Israel.
[2:36:59] He gives them the law, THE WORD TO
[2:37:02] REFLECT GOD'S WILL ON HOW HE WANTED THEM
[2:37:04] TO LIVE.
[2:37:07] THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT LAWS.
[2:37:11] THAT'S GOD'S WILL ON HOW HE WANTS US TO
[2:37:15] LIVE.
[2:37:21] That's the word. That's why the Bible
[2:37:23] says when he came Christ, we are no
[2:37:26] longer under the school master.
[2:37:29] For the law was our school master to
[2:37:33] bring us to Christ.
[2:37:35] But now that Christ has come, we are no
[2:37:37] longer under the law.
[2:37:39] So you see why? Because we have received
[2:37:42] ANOTHER LAW,
[2:37:44] the law of faith. When you receive the
[2:37:47] word, you don't need another law
[2:37:50] because then he as the Holy Spirit in
[2:37:52] you reminds you of all things.
[2:37:58] You know, they made a golden calf
[2:38:02] and this is one of the occurrence, the
[2:38:03] first occurrences
[2:38:06] of their these political maneuvers.
[2:38:12] You know when God calls a people,
[2:38:15] if you want to understand the church,
[2:38:18] see how God really what he has done for
[2:38:20] them,
[2:38:22] see where they are going, see where they
[2:38:24] came from. how they overcame every inch
[2:38:28] of ground
[2:38:30] under the leadership of their messenger
[2:38:34] who apparently is not a perfect one
[2:38:39] for some reason.
[2:38:42] Whoever God calls,
[2:38:44] he makes sure they have some
[2:38:45] imperfection.
[2:38:49] Why? It humbles them.
[2:38:52] Now, let me tell you something, church.
[2:38:55] If God was to use a man so much
[2:39:00] without any imperfection,
[2:39:05] that man can take the glory of God.
[2:39:10] And God does not share his glory with no
[2:39:12] man.
[2:39:14] I was reading the other day of one of
[2:39:16] the greatest evangelists of the 19th
[2:39:19] century,
[2:39:21] faith healer.
[2:39:23] I don't remember his name. maybe a I
[2:39:24] don't remember Jako or something like
[2:39:27] that. I don't remember the name so I'm
[2:39:29] not sure whether he's one of those but
[2:39:31] the man healed so many people
[2:39:35] like held revival meeting
[2:39:39] but he died from alcohol
[2:39:43] drunker
[2:39:45] and you list one by one
[2:39:49] talk about Moses I'm speaking of here
[2:39:53] this man was so anointed
[2:39:55] that he could just touch the water it it
[2:39:58] becomes sweet. He just rais stick a rock
[2:40:03] and the water's part and he separates
[2:40:06] the sea a sea
[2:40:09] and you know not only that but also
[2:40:11] formed a road there.
[2:40:16] Talk about that kind of man.
[2:40:19] But this is a man who went and did
[2:40:21] something against the world.
[2:40:26] He married an unbeliever.
[2:40:29] He married an unbeliever.
[2:40:33] Not only that, he had murdered someone.
[2:40:36] So he's a murderer and he married wrong.
[2:40:40] But yet is the man THAT GOD HAD CHOSEN
[2:40:44] TO USE FOR that sin.
[2:40:46] GOD did not need their OPINION
[2:40:50] for him to USE IT. WHEN GOD IS raising a
[2:40:54] man to use for your life,
[2:40:57] he is not seeking for your opinion.
[2:41:01] SHOULD I USE JULIUS?
[2:41:03] SHOULD I USE NOBLE? SHOULD I USE PETER?
[2:41:06] Or should I USE SOMEBODY? HE WILL NOT
[2:41:09] ASK YOU, BUT HE WILL TELL YOU HERE IS
[2:41:12] THE MAN I'VE SENT FOR YOUR LIFE.
[2:41:15] RECEIVE HIM, LIVE, RECEIVE, REFUSE HIM,
[2:41:17] DIE.
[2:41:20] WHY? WHY? BECAUSE GOD ALLOWS THAT TO BE
[2:41:22] THERE IN THIS MAN'S LIFE
[2:41:26] to keep them humble. [screaming]
[2:41:30] YOU KNOW, EVEN PAUL HIMSELF. HE HAD THIS
[2:41:34] WHICH HE SAID UH YOU KNOW IT TROUBLED
[2:41:36] HIM
[2:41:38] AND HE ALWAYS CAME TO GOD ABOUT IT. THIS
[2:41:41] IS A MAN. THEY'LL JUST BRING PEOPLE IN
[2:41:44] HIS PRESENCE
[2:41:46] AND HIS SHADOW WILL HEAL THEM.
[2:41:49] ONE TIME HE WAS PREACHING AND A MAN DIED
[2:41:51] [screaming]
[2:41:53] BECAUSE HE WAS DOZING
[2:41:56] sitting on a ON A WINDOW
[2:41:59] AND THEN HE FELL DOWN AND DIED. I THINK
[2:42:01] HIS NAME IS UTICUS, RIGHT? BUT YOU KNOW
[2:42:04] THIS BROTHER WENT TO HIM,
[2:42:07] YOU KNOW, AND HE JUST RAISED HIM AS IF
[2:42:08] THE MAN WAS SLEEPING.
[2:42:11] THAT'S THE KIND OF ANOINTING THIS MAN.
[2:42:14] BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HIS TROUBLE,
[2:42:17] HIS PROBLEM,
[2:42:19] YOU KNOW, WHENEVER HE COMES TO GOD, OH
[2:42:21] GOD, [screaming]
[2:42:23] TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME. GOD SIMPLY
[2:42:25] ANSWERED AND HE SAID, "MY GRACE IS
[2:42:28] SUFFICIENT FOR YOU."
[2:42:30] SO GOD GIVES HIS MEN, HIS SERVANTS, A
[2:42:35] CERTAIN GRACE,
[2:42:38] A CERTAIN PORTION OF GRACE. [screaming]
[2:42:41] THAT NOT ANYBODY HAS.
[2:42:45] THAT IS WHY WHEN GOD HAS ANOINTED A MAN
[2:42:48] AND CALLED HIM,
[2:42:51] DON'T ALWAYS TOUCH THEM. HE SAYS, "TOUCH
[2:42:54] NOT [screaming] MY ANOINTED
[2:42:57] WHOM MY PROPHETS KNOW HOW
[2:43:00] BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO BE UH HE WANTS THEM
[2:43:03] TO BE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO HIM."
[2:43:09] AMEN. BROTHER BRHAM, HE HAD SO MANY
[2:43:12] ISSUES IN HIS LIFE.
[2:43:15] Do you know some of you?
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Do you know brother Bham had false
[2:43:22] teeth?
[2:43:22] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:43:24] his teeth got issues and so he had to
[2:43:26] get false one.
[2:43:31] Not all of them but some
[2:43:35] a PROPHET WHO RAISED FIVE DEAD FROM to
[2:43:37] life
[2:43:40] who when a person a child was lame you
[2:43:43] know a leg like this prayed FOR IT AND
[2:43:45] GOT MANY longer
[2:43:50] this what I'm talking about the kind of
[2:43:52] anointing he had
[2:43:54] prayed for the dead they came back
[2:43:57] he prayed for the fish which was
[2:43:58] dedicated
[2:44:01] and I made many more supernatural
[2:44:02] miracles.
[2:44:04] Are you hearing me? But this is the kind
[2:44:06] of a man that could not pray for teeth
[2:44:09] to be created.
[2:44:12] So which means he went to the dentist.
[2:44:17] [groaning] Brother Bam, pray for
[2:44:19] yourself. My growth is sufficient
[2:44:23] hair.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; He had a bald head.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he stop the head from
[2:44:31] And you know what he did, brother Min?
[2:44:34] He got himself a wig.
[2:44:38] [snorts]
[2:44:38] Pastor Tom, you get I don't speak those
[2:44:41] things.
[2:44:44] And the believers of today are more holy
[2:44:46] than the
[2:44:48] even the sisters. Sister, YOU'RE WEARING
[2:44:50] A WIG. YOU'RE GOING TO HELL.
[2:44:54] Brother had a wig.
[2:45:01] when he WOULD GO IN SOME PLACES BECAUSE
[2:45:03] HIS VOICE WOULD BECOME HORSE AND SO HE
[2:45:06] NEEDED A WIG
[2:45:09] TO help him
[2:45:11] protect his head from the sun.
[2:45:15] So you see it's the motive why you do
[2:45:17] what you do
[2:45:22] BUT IT IS SOME WEAK SPOT HE HAD
[2:45:26] and I can GO ON AND ON
[2:45:28] TALK ABOUT MANY THINGS some of which I
[2:45:31] may not even want to talk on the pulpit
[2:45:35] THE CRITICS WILL TALK ABOUT IT
[2:45:38] AND THEY SAY YOU SEE WAS NOT A PROPHET
[2:45:39] NO DOESN'T NEED YOUR APPROVAL FOR HIM TO
[2:45:42] BE A PROPHET
[2:45:45] IF HE HAS SENT HE'S MY PROPHET THEN HE'S
[2:45:48] A PROPHET.
[2:45:50] You see
[2:45:53] when Israel they you know when Moses
[2:45:56] went off and they began to move
[2:45:58] politically.
[2:46:02] They came to Aaron. They said Aaron you
[2:46:05] see our pastor's gone for so long.
[2:46:11] They came to our don't never be an Aaron
[2:46:13] like that
[2:46:16] to give the people what they want
[2:46:19] to keep the move to keep the church
[2:46:20] together.
[2:46:22] Let let me tell you
[2:46:25] let me say this in
[2:46:32] there should be no human being who can
[2:46:35] do anything in their own to keep the
[2:46:38] church moving. No man can do that. No
[2:46:41] man should do that. Because if the
[2:46:44] church is started by God,
[2:46:46] EVEN IF THE fellowship is started by
[2:46:48] God,
[2:46:51] it cannot be kept by political
[2:46:53] maneuvers.
[2:46:58] God himself will keep it.
[2:47:01] I remember this man called um you know
[2:47:05] he Saul, King Saul
[2:47:09] The prophet was supposed to come and
[2:47:10] sacrifice offer the sacrifice
[2:47:13] but you know prophet Saul
[2:47:15] rather king Saul waited for the prophet
[2:47:18] and the prophet never showed up now we
[2:47:21] saw the people started to go
[2:47:25] the people are going
[2:47:27] I'm the king
[2:47:29] my kingdom is
[2:47:32] said I'm the I'm the I'm the king I must
[2:47:36] keep my people together
[2:47:38] said, "It's all right.
[2:47:40] I'm going to make the sacrifice."
[2:47:43] And as soon as he gave the sacrifice,
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; the prophet arrived.
[2:47:48] The prophet was late.
[2:47:52] Let me tell you, brother,
[2:47:55] God can allow
[2:47:59] for you to feel that your pastor doesn't
[2:48:00] even mind about you.
[2:48:06] is to test your faith.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I was sick.
[2:48:12] Not even a call. They didn't even visit
[2:48:14] me.
[2:48:18] You see, it's your faith being tested.
[2:48:22] And and this man, you know, decided to
[2:48:25] do the sacrifice. And when the prophet
[2:48:27] arrived, he didn't even say, "I'm sorry,
[2:48:29] I'm late.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Do you know what he did? He started by
[2:48:39] prophesying.
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
[2:48:46] YOU know the people THE PEOPLE.
[2:48:48] [screaming]
[2:48:49] LET ME TELL YOU, GOD CALLED MAN
[2:48:53] DOES NOT MOVE BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE.
[2:48:56] DOES NOT PREACH BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE.
[2:48:59] HE PREACHES BECAUSE OF THE VISION
[2:49:00] [screaming] GOD HAS GIVEN HIM.
[2:49:04] THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE KEEPS HIGH HIS
[2:49:06] EYES [screaming] ON
[2:49:09] AND THE PEOPLE MUST ALIGN themselves
[2:49:14] to that vision.
[2:49:17] Amen. If the GOD SPEAKS TO THE PASTOR,
[2:49:21] WE ARE GOING TO GET LAND OF 500 MILLION.
[2:49:25] WELL, IF YOU BELIEVE IS YOUR PASTOR,
[2:49:29] STAND BEHIND THAT. SUPPORT IT. DO ALL
[2:49:33] YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU SEE GOD NEVER SPOKE
[2:49:35] TO YOU, SPOKE TO HIM.
[2:49:38] THERE'S ONLY ONE VISION BEAR AT A TIME.
[2:49:43] We've even had people who say, "WELL,
[2:49:44] PASTOR,
[2:49:46] FOR US, WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT
[2:49:49] THEY WE GIVE OUR MONEY AND THEY READ
[2:49:50] IT."
[2:49:55] THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN WE GIVE WITH OUR
[2:49:57] RIGHT HAND OUR LEFT SHOULD
[2:50:00] we don't want anybody TO KNOW.
[2:50:03] SO WHY DO you stand in the church and
[2:50:05] pray?
[2:50:07] Yet doesn't the Bible say when you pray
[2:50:08] don't pray like the Pharisees
[2:50:12] who lift up their hands in the church.
[2:50:15] Go in private and pray.
[2:50:19] Don't misinterpret scripture.
[2:50:23] Focus on the vision.
[2:50:26] Focus on the vision.
[2:50:29] I said focus ON THE VISION. AND THE
[2:50:31] PROPHET SAID SACRI LIKE LIKE I SAID
[2:50:35] SACRIFICE
[2:50:37] UH OBEDIENCE IS BETTER THAN SACRIFICE.
[2:50:41] And it was good. The kingdom was going
[2:50:43] to be with you forever.
[2:50:46] BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, IT HAS
[2:50:48] BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU. GOD HELP US
[2:50:52] THAT THE kingdom will not be taken away
[2:50:53] from us.
[2:50:55] Let us not step
[2:50:58] into positions
[2:51:00] into roles
[2:51:02] into responsibilities
[2:51:04] the Holy Spirit has not asked us to step
[2:51:11] it will obscure the vision.
[2:51:17] So they now they they you know these
[2:51:19] people made a couch.
[2:51:22] They started drifting off the vision.
[2:51:25] They wanted to have a visible God
[2:51:28] that they can worship. But Moses helped
[2:51:31] to bring them back again to sanity.
[2:51:35] He brought them back again. And that's
[2:51:37] the anointing that is always on a man
[2:51:39] that God has chosen in that time.
[2:51:42] And I tell you, God has sent us a
[2:51:44] prophet in this generation.
[2:51:47] And he has brought the people back again
[2:51:49] to sanity.
[2:51:51] He has brought the church back again to
[2:51:53] sanity.
[2:51:56] And as I'm preaching to finish now
[2:51:59] this, you know, then we come to Kadesh
[2:52:01] Badesh.
[2:52:03] Probably on Wednesday I'm going to deal
[2:52:06] with Kadesh Banesh
[2:52:08] in detail. But you see this was the
[2:52:11] border of the promised land.
[2:52:15] Moses now sends out spies
[2:52:19] to the land. 10 spies to come, you know,
[2:52:23] and see how the land is. So they went
[2:52:26] with mixed and conflicting testimonies.
[2:52:32] BUT YOU SEE THE TWO,
[2:52:35] they were the only one
[2:52:38] that caught the vision.
[2:52:43] They caught the vision. Did you know
[2:52:47] that unbelief cannot hinder God?
[2:52:52] So it's better you catch the vision
[2:52:53] quickly.
[2:52:56] You be a part of the one in a million.
[2:53:02] There were over two million people
[2:53:04] that left Egypt but only two made.
[2:53:08] One in a million
[2:53:10] be one in a million.
[2:53:13] And what happened at Kadesh Beradesh
[2:53:16] will show you how people can move
[2:53:18] politically,
[2:53:19] maneuver, try to DO
[2:53:25] try to obscure or to hinder the vision.
[2:53:30] God told them, YOU WILL GO TO THE
[2:53:31] PROMISED LAND.
[2:53:33] THE LAND IS YOURS. IT IS FLOWING WITH
[2:53:35] MILK AND HONEY. YOU WILL TAKE IT. BUT
[2:53:39] WHEN THESE PEOPLE CAME BACK, THE 10
[2:53:41] SPIES, THEY SAID, "NO, [screaming]
[2:53:45] THE LAND IS GOOD." YEAH,
[2:53:48] FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. YEAH. WE
[2:53:50] EVEN HAVE THE FRUITS.
[2:53:52] BUT THIS IS A LAND THAT EATS THE
[2:53:55] INHABITANTS THERE.
[2:53:58] THE LAND HAS GIANTS.
[2:54:01] IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TAKE IT. BUT YOU
[2:54:04] SEE TWO WITNESSES THEY HAD CAUGHT THE
[2:54:07] VISION. THEY SAID IT DOESN'T MATTER
[2:54:11] WHAT IS THERE. WE WILL NOT TALK ABOUT
[2:54:14] WHAT IS THERE. WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT
[2:54:17] GOD HAS SAID.
[2:54:19] GOD HAS SAID ONE THING THAT THE LAND IS
[2:54:22] GOOD
[2:54:26] AND THE LAND IS YOURS. [screaming]
[2:54:28] FOR ALL WE KNOW, WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE
[2:54:32] TO TAKE THE LAND. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[2:54:35] [screaming]
[2:54:36] THERE ARE GIANTS THERE. IT DOESN'T
[2:54:38] MATTER HOW HARD IT LOOKS.
[2:54:42] GOD PROMISED [screaming] IT.
[2:54:44] THAT SETTLES IN IT SHALL HAPPEN.
[2:54:48] [screaming] EVEN AS HE SAID, THE LAND IS
[2:54:51] OURS. WE WILL TAKE IT. WE WILL POSSESS
[2:54:55] [screaming] IT. AND THESE MEN WERE BORN.
[2:55:00] H THEY HAD CAUGHT THE VISION.
[2:55:03] THEY HAD CAUGHT THE vision and many
[2:55:06] times they even started quoting Moses
[2:55:08] later on
[2:55:10] after Moses died. Many times they will
[2:55:13] quote him.
[2:55:14] Talk about WHAT MOSES HAD SAID, what God
[2:55:18] had told Moses and what they also
[2:55:20] believed. WE'RE GOING TO GO AND WE'RE
[2:55:22] GOING TO TAKE THE LAND. YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:55:25] THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE
[2:55:28] TO THEM THEIR VISION WAS OBSCURED.
[2:55:34] They were blinded TO THE VISION
[2:55:37] [screaming]
[2:55:38] AND GOD NEVER ALLOWED THEM TO GO AND
[2:55:44] you see saints.
[2:55:46] Always know
[2:55:48] the the the the the vessel.
[2:55:52] There are three things you should know.
[2:55:54] The season you are in
[2:55:57] as a person, the vessel God has chosen
[2:56:01] to use
[2:56:05] and the vision.
[2:56:08] Because you see this vision, this this
[2:56:09] vessel is the vision bearer.
[2:56:14] And if you can receive the vessel,
[2:56:18] you will know the season
[2:56:21] and you will know the vision.
[2:56:24] And there is no way you can be lost.
[2:56:28] Then you can attain
[2:56:30] every godgiven promise in your life.
[2:56:37] Did you know that even if you're BARREN
[2:56:44] and you go to the person that YOU KNOW
[2:56:45] THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED IN THAT specific
[2:56:49] I'm IN A BAD TIME I AM
[2:56:53] but I'm not going to go TO THE MOSQUE
[2:56:57] I'M not going to GO TO MY AUNTIE
[2:56:58] [screaming]
[2:56:59] I'M GOING TO GO TO THE AUNTIE
[2:57:02] LET ME GO TO THE PLACE
[2:57:04] WHICH GOD HAS PUT FOR
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:57:08] &gt;&gt; MY PASTOR TELL him
[2:57:11] did it.
[2:57:16] God works in certain ways. Brother says
[2:57:19] if you can't respect the office and the
[2:57:21] man
[2:57:25] respect the office you hold.
[2:57:29] You know what?
[2:57:31] When Hannah came, she was here at the
[2:57:33] altar. [laughter]
[2:57:35] Oh god.
[2:57:40] The prophet came.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; What was his name again?
[2:57:45] Ellie or whatever. So he comes woman.
[2:57:51] [laughter]
[2:57:52] He's a prophet. It's the pastor.
[2:57:57] Look at her. Why are you DRUNK AT THIS
[2:57:59] MORNING?
[2:58:03] FATHER, YOU GO
[2:58:05] a man of God. I am not drunk. I am
[2:58:09] crying. YOU WANT A BABY?
[2:58:13] You want a baby?
[2:58:16] Hey, [snorts] that's when the man of God
[2:58:18] remembers the man of God
[2:58:20] say, "Okay, you go." It seemed that you
[2:58:23] really wanted her to go.
[2:58:26] You go.
[2:58:28] God will provide.
[2:58:32] That was enough.
[2:58:36] What your man of God says
[2:58:39] is enough. If you can't respect it,
[2:58:43] respect it because of his office.
[2:58:47] God will honor your faith.
[2:58:50] And that means your prophet in the
[2:58:52] generation your pastor, your father,
[2:58:56] your husband.
[2:59:02] Respect those offices.
[2:59:05] God always respects that.
[2:59:08] God has the order
[2:59:11] and he watches that.
[2:59:13] I want for pastor to pray for me.
[2:59:16] But he simply laid his hand on me and he
[2:59:18] said he's finished.
[2:59:20] believe
[2:59:22] because you see God will honor the word
[2:59:26] of his son because it is God God's
[2:59:30] reputation at RISK
[2:59:37] FRIENDS. There's a lot we can talk
[2:59:38] about. I want to talk about Kadesh B on
