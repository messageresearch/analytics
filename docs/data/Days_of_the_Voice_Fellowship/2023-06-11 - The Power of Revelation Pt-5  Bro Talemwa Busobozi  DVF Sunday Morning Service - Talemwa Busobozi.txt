which Jesus Christ and we have come this morning in your presence to have a conference with you may you come and minister to us for you know the needs of each individual here you were able to take me out of the way father and Lord all my failures father Lord take me out of the way oh thank you Jesus if there is one thing I can't get tired of brother I want you to show about it is worship we are only limited in these services that we cannot you know exceed a certain time limit but friends let me tell you true worshiper must see worships in spirit you can even worship for hours and hours you should never limit yourself don't just say well I won't do it because I'm I'm here I will do it another place because of the way I'm feeling whenever the moment arrives oh thank you Jesus Lord mukama we worship you oh thank you Jesus foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] we gave you Glory [Music] oh Jesus oh Jesus to be free [Music] well our God he's an awesome God erase is [Music] thank you from heaven above with we wisdom too power foreign [Music] [Music] name when you reach there just say Amen [Music] Hebrews Hebrews 11 chapter 11 verses 1 to 4. now Faith is the substance of things opt for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen we are not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which you obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaking is [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign God bless you we've been praying for you amen and also our sister Martha and the little one as well I'm happy to see that you made it to church I was blessed by the songs that were sung this morning I say God bless you where is yeah oh right here I don't never know that was the best that you have ever done and the little ones also sang a very good amen I mean Hallelujah Hallelujah the Lord is good the Lord is good amen Amina please somebody the deacons remind me if I forget I just want few to go straight into the word but after the word I would like to update you regarding our land funds so if I forget the deacons are the problems this series this is the fifth time we're speaking on this and how men are being really being blessed how men are not being blessed [Music] okay so uh really when sometimes we ask I seems to be your brother when I'm I'm out there I sense to be a brother when I'm out there when I come up here speaking on behalf of the Lord everybody is coming to speak to you in the name of the Lord sometimes and tell you do [Music] and the Bible says you see it is more blessed to well it says that obedience is better than sacrifice so let us be obedient be the presence Hallelujah I mean as a matter of fact I love some I love the way people in Zimbabwe are so obedient to the spirit you see sometimes even when the preacher is preaching [Music] this morning I'm going to continue on this subject maybe I'll finish them maybe I'm not too sure let's see so the power of Revelation today I am dealing with a few more things and really this is a kind of a teaching but because I don't know whether I'm a teacher or not I just preach it so let us see I've spoken in some places and some people say that I'm a teacher but I don't believe I'm a teacher I believe I'm just a preacher you know a preacher just can take one person and and you know get into things [Music] sometimes we get into quotes into scriptures into verses into now I guess I'm just being a pastor to you [Music] now Faith is a substance of things hoped foreign do you understand what I'm saying it is the evidence of the things you have not yet seen [Music] and the Bible now clearly says here actually in Hebrews 11 the whole chapter he was giving many examples of people that had faith and here in this verse 4 he says by faith he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] he can never change them a bit foreign [Music] that is why they are preached for two thousand years somehow they will always be living on them because foreign foreign [Music] foreign and so the Bible now clearly says here by faith you offered unto God more excellent sacrifice let me ask you a question why did God not accept Cain's sacrifice the reason is simple because he did not give it by faitha [Music] that was good sacrifice it was the best of the best please follow me don't miss this and so Cain was a farmer who made it [Music] will you not be accepted [Applause] so this is why I'm preaching on this it is because there is power in Revelation some of you may be wondering why are you saying faith and again Revelations God has sent to us that what is faith faith is the revelation of the will of God hallelujah did not know what God required in the sacrifice Cain gave apples peers and everything else and when it went as a battle foreign foreign adultery or Wednesday even this happened the Bible says requires blood today foreign they ate up us by Faith by the eyes of foreign [Music] oh he said thank God let me just speak one of myself that's the advantage I believe of us that's the advantage that's the advantage a seed of God has boots exactly what he puts you in exactly where you are supposed to be to attain what you need to attained but the other seats it is very hard for them but if they also did exactly what you did and they humbled themselves but oftentimes they can't because they can see it they don't see it but thank God we are blessing in his kingdom hallelujah amen today we are right here we are right here sacrifice has already been given yeah foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] friends we need Revelation the Bible says without Revelations it is expected to have a disconnection yes all right we are still in the world foreign [Applause] foreign let us be connected so that someone feel that in their heart if you feel it should listen to those who feel it gotta be connected Hallelujah be connected to the world Amen cut yourself from the world come cut yourself ugly movies you can never be changed was not disconnected from his ideas why can't God accept me God doesn't accept you on your time you have to drop your ideas let him lead them and then watch the light begin to work oh my God hallelujah changing every place every place in your life when I say every place and everything I mean it makes you happy when you are down cast when you don't have friends when you don't have good Associates if you don't have foreign disappointed that is the power of Revelations righteousness is not the works you did works of righteousness you know the righteousness and Holiness is faith if you have faith in God you see what others they will call you a fool for a season because you haven't attended yet because faith is believing and holding on to God believing that by faith you have to do this and then God will do the rest recorded shall we go to the Book of Luke we will take this today as our as our case study Luke 7 36 um praise the Lord my intention is always to speak to you for an hour because I believe within an hour you've already got enough foreign house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box for intimate and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet and with the tears and did wipe them with the hairs of of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now whenever Pharisee which had been in him saw it he spoke within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known Who had who and what manner of woman this is that touches him for she is a sinner and Jesus answered him say that to him Simon I have somewhere to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debt us the one owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me the wrong for Simon which of them will heal love most or which one which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that that he to whom he forgive most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon says Thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gaveth me no water for for my feet but she gave she has washed my my feet with with the tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil without it is not anoint but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment whatever I say unto thee has sins which are many oh my God are forgiven for she loved much but whom little is given the same love with little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth or sins also and he said unto the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace oh my God I have a lot on my heart in this about the scripture [Music] I'm trying to wonder whether I'm going to even go a little halfway because each of us can be a summary so let me try to just bring it as the spirit will give utterance so here is a woman and maybe what I'm going to do I'm going to pause a little bit and then I come to that a little later amen now I will first read this quote have that scripture in your mind says now there is three elements listen to me please there are three elements that people live in three elements that people live in there is that is ten percent of you if you're hearing me say Amen first I don't want to just pound this on you I wanted to receive is the humanistic what is it humanistic number two divine revelation one brother is making a copy there on the on the on the screen all right humanistic Divine Revelations now he says now this like in prayer when you pray for anyone in humanistic [Music] um we say well I hope you will get away that is a human and it's all right when you pray with somebody don't speak presumptuously with what Authority did you say that you have to have you know many times I realized I work in one of these three rooms you know you just pray for somebody and you feel nothing you see nothing and you know you just tell them well believe in God but sometimes while I'm praying for something you know Revelation just comes down amen you know maybe for what to say and then I begin to tell them in the name of Jesus Christ always listen to such a thing when you are prayed for by a picture usually big attentive many times when divine revelation comes you need to tap into that again and also you need to believe well it is revealed to him and it is not revealed to you it's very difficult for you to manifest in your life foreign [Music] one time remove many I was praying in the church and and you know I would while I'm praying with the brothers we're all praying and the spirit of Revelation to come upon me and then I come to this problem happened like three or four times let me pray with you it is the Revelation that I should pray with him when God reveals to you things like that don't do it we should be spiritual people you're laid by the spirit of God am I preaching to someone here today you shout amen it will not hurt me I can promise I'll tell you I'll tell him I want to pray foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] because that is one time I think it has happened to me and she was saying of South Dakota is in the god of the message alive I'm tired I'm tired because you see this woman you cannot hug her and comfortable sister those pastors it's okay sisters [Music] here is our what our Prophet says that's why we don't believe in men hugging women unless she's your mother or your sister or your wife [Music] are you hearing that so younger men don't even attempt together the younger men don't like that I have had very many young men come to me after falling into Temptations rather after falling into foreign [Music] don't look at me as if you're very holiday so that's why we don't hug sisters brothers sisters are you hearing me I'm seeing Brother Martin his daughter right there I'm not saying any of my daughters the front seats see you little girls you middle-aged girls I know many hear this also out there don't be ashamed talk what you want when someone comes to give you a heart attack you just put your hands don't be ashamed to do that don't swallow you know any man who wants to argue when they are not your husband wife or brother he has a wrong spirit and that Spirit wants to take you to Hell put your hand or go to hell I'm on a holy Place praise the name of the Lord and so this sister she was crying so I felt so bad and attention and you know we serve a living God [Music] that second element comes by a future says you are going to get a job two weeks weeks she had a job and that job that job they paid her what she asked foreign and she had it for very many years our God is a living our God is a God who drops down and speaks Hallelujah yeah even if it is not yet revealed believe it in the humanistic realm today what the Lord will do Revelation has power that changes situations hallelujah amen http the power of reference says in the message the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the building foreign do I have Believers here no are they a Believers here the power of Revelation bring simulation for the power of wine natural wine um foreign [Music] hahaha [Music] don't make a mistake but having a drunkard is happy I asked brother timbreut team fruit you drink wine he said oh yeah we do I said which type exactly some of you have never taken that way [Music] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord yes you cannot feel what I feel together Oh Glory guys and here is brings a person that's also have done to a stimulation well then now there is power of the revelation of the world it gives accumulation of Joy to the believer stimulation the stimulation that it is Vindicated are you drunk brother yes sir the stimulation that it is that it is approved praise the name of Allah is I the word it gives the Joy to the believer you should be joyful right now brother Joseph say a man is the sad person he is never happy that way give him wine and then you will see one of the most happy places because these people have taken wine and they are happy people I'm gonna send you food but the happiness that wine gives natural wine um not the natural wine see when I Journal new way to the belief oh my let me tell you from today begin to tell everybody all over the world is it all right and it is all right but there is only one type of wine if you drink another eat brother just come on tonight aha [Music] the problem foreign get intoxicated I enjoy your child that is intoxicated amenities because it is the wine spirit [Music] is [Applause] the drunkardness of the Holy Spirit foreign foreign everyone [Applause] foreign musu amen that's the power of Revelation so when I'm preaching the Revelation I'm preaching the Holy Ghost and I have two minutes so I'm not going to go deeper now but let me talk a little bit about this woman say this woman comes with oil and I think I'll go in the details of this woman on Wednesdays and so everybody looks at this this Pharisee invites Jesus and Jesus comes when you invite Jesus he will always come are you hearing me through the day but when it comes how are you going to entertain him I hope by the time I'm done with this series they give him attitude never take away you see when Jesus comes what does he want to find he wants to find people entertainingly how do you entertain Jesus yes by worshiping him foreign and you'll get another one our religion must not be dead telling a powerful our worship must be shocked tears of praise it it should be with the stimulation should be life you see this in this woman is worship there was excitement there was two years there was wine again foreign we see it in the Revelation which Jesus Christ actually confirmed later I will expand that on Wednesday because Jesus confirmed that she had the wine but she came with the oil the oil is the holy ghost spirits you have you must have both the wine and the Holy Ghost Revelation and the Holy Ghost and this woman doesn't Came To Worship sins and she worshiped with Allah how can you worship open the what is going on you just seated down sincerely should never relax in the child this is not your home gonna see my cargo go and relax at your home but when you're in charge sit on the edge of yourself Amen to uh to to soak into his voice hold on to every word let it inspire you into a revolution if there is any purpose for any teaching that we have whether I win strong it is to get us into the true wine and the true oil without the true wife [Music] and in that presence foreign [Music] thank you oh Hallelujah she was not repenting yeah friends we must learn to worship we must go deeper in worship together yes it's not about the music of humor the music helps us to get into industry and then you flow in the anointing Brothers [Music] you are the one who sees the one who is yawning brother you have a problem [Music] your work is to watch so brother sister don't worry about your bag we have deacons because some people are not in spiritual get in there is nothing impossible I feel like preaching moment idiom [Applause] oh oh praise the name of the Lord his power and Revelation power and Revelation all things are possible I'm getting back to this on Wednesday and I will go a little bit deeper God wants to take us somewhere in a place where we can be able to receive much do you love Jesus hallelujah hallelujah we have a song We'll begin with that my sins are gone if you believe your sins are gone like that woman Jesus told her your sins are forgiveness for their money foreign [Music] each of us as individuals [Music]

give more and also sustain your needs Solomon and that brings us to a total of 23 million nine hundred thousand nine hundred thirty three thousands um [Applause] bless those who have given that this number looks too big after we have removed all the money we have been removed so it was telling me that maybe the treasurer has made a mistake yeah so I also thought maybe they made a mistake I went back and they confirmed it and they did make a mistake so we so I've not counted it brother do you have a total figure if if these amounts are not are not removed you have a total figure a turtle figure is okay that means he has not added it up next time I'll add it up for you guys again yeah I mean so I will add it up for you so you can see how much we are losing towards the rent Jessica have
