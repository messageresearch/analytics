[35:44] Ephesians chapter
[35:51] 4 Ephesians chapter
[35:56] 4
[35:59] and uh we will be reading from vers
[36:16] 21 amen we had a lot of testimonies for
[36:19] Sunday last
[36:24] week how many were blessed on Sunday
[36:28] such moments are usually
[36:31] rare and when the Holy Spirit comes down
[36:34] like that you want to be sure that you
[36:35] get your blessing before you leave the
[36:40] service trusted this
[36:44] evening give us a little more of
[36:49] him
[36:51] amen we are reading verses
[36:55] 21 brother Prince was
[36:58] restored faith on Tabernacle on
[37:03] Sunday and I heard from him he said it
[37:06] was wonderful
[37:08] there Benjamin you were there is that
[37:12] true that we are blessed
[37:16] too amen so we are reading verses 21
[37:20] vers
[37:24] 24 if so be that ye have heard him and
[37:28] have been taught by him as the truth is
[37:31] in Jesus that he put off concerning the
[37:34] former conversation the old man which is
[37:38] corrupt according to the deceitful
[37:41] lusts and be renewed in the spirit of
[37:44] your
[37:46] mind and that ye put on the new man
[37:49] which after God is created in
[37:52] righteousness and true
[37:56] holiness
[38:26] for
[38:35] amen amen you may be
[38:39] seated I do have a lot to talk about
[38:42] this
[38:44] evening so I'm trusting that you kindly
[38:48] give me your undivided
[38:52] attention that we you don't do a lot of
[38:56] movements that we may be able to in the
[38:59] end to learn
[39:03] something so sometimes forget our live
[39:07] uh congregation so we send you our
[39:13] greetings we ask that the Lord will
[39:15] bless you this
[39:18] evening and when people here say Amen
[39:21] you also say
[39:24] Amen how many are prepared their Amen in
[39:27] the
[39:30] praise God so I'm going to speak on a
[39:33] subject which I believe will help a lot
[39:34] of young
[39:38] people so if it blesses
[39:40] you as usual you kindly share the
[39:43] service service with other young
[39:47] people I do have not prepared to preach
[39:50] that much just a few thoughts I need to
[39:51] share
[39:55] about the right mental
[40:04] attitude okay isn't that what you
[40:08] interpreted isn't that the right
[40:10] attitude or the right mind
[40:22] and I don't know I don't know you will
[40:24] find the right right mental attitude
[40:27] what is mental in
[40:30] Uganda obongo no that's brains that's
[40:38] brains that is
[40:40] head so so you have to find the right
[40:43] word mental what is mental somebody help
[40:47] us
[40:48] ah that is
[40:54] close yes yes I always thought you were
[40:57] the best interpreter now what is
[40:58] happening
[41:03] today the right mental
[41:11] attitude I think that is
[41:15] perfect that is good that's a good one
[41:18] now that's really what I want the
[41:20] subject I'm going to talk about but I'll
[41:21] be talking about different
[41:25] things I've been waiting on you are you
[41:28] ready okay if you're ready can you put
[41:31] that picture for us and brother Isaac
[41:33] you you I sent you something with that
[41:35] picture as well if you can be able to
[41:36] get it and put it up for the people
[41:38] online there's something I want to
[41:39] illustrate for
[41:42] them before we continue because if I get
[41:44] started I may not be able to get into
[41:47] that and I hope you don't disappoint me
[41:49] because you told me it's going to
[41:56] work
[41:59] okay I
[42:01] mean brother Isaac you have it already
[42:04] Okay so I'll just continue um there are
[42:08] three Realms of
[42:13] man you are a Tran
[42:18] being you are really three in
[42:23] one brother Marvin whatever I'm saying I
[42:26] want people to see it to make sure that
[42:27] happens shortly if you can so uh usually
[42:33] what we call
[42:36] man is what we
[42:38] see but that is the outer
[42:41] man that's the
[42:44] body and each of each each part of
[42:49] man has uh different
[42:54] gats so the outside part of man the
[43:01] body has five gats which we call five
[43:07] senses and that is SE the sense
[43:11] of the sense of
[43:15] feel
[43:16] smell hear and
[43:20] taste now all these are five GS or five
[43:23] senses that uh bring things into that
[43:26] man
[43:31] and now that all happens actually on the
[43:34] outside body on the outside
[43:38] man but you see there is another man who
[43:42] is the innermost
[43:46] being who is the real
[43:49] you and now that is the
[43:53] soul I know brother B in the beginning
[43:55] he said it's a spirit
[43:59] but later on as he progressed in
[44:01] Revelation he said no it is the
[44:05] soul and many Pentecostal still teach
[44:08] that you know the inner man is the
[44:14] spirit but the inner man is not a
[44:18] spirit the inner man is the
[44:22] soul and now in the
[44:26] soul is only one
[44:28] gate and that gate is either Faith or
[44:34] doubt and now when you believe you have
[44:37] faith in the word of
[44:40] God that gate will open all the
[44:43] blessings of the word every promise of
[44:45] of God in your
[44:49] life but if you doubt the word of
[44:52] God then that gate will open in a lot of
[44:55] things that are for the doubter
[45:00] so I believer should have the Gate of
[45:03] faith in
[45:06] their but you see there is the inner man
[45:08] that's the innermost
[45:11] man the soul and then the outer man is
[45:14] the spirit the body but then we have the
[45:18] inner
[45:20] man that is the spirit and that's the
[45:23] one I want us to dwell on the one I want
[45:26] us to dwell on today
[45:29] the Inner
[45:30] Man the spirit also has five gates just
[45:33] like the outside man the
[45:37] body now the first gate is called
[45:42] memory the other is called
[45:46] reasoning the other is called
[45:50] affection and then
[45:53] imagination un
[45:55] conscious
[45:57] and we will get into those things in
[45:59] details later on
[46:01] shortly so we see that all these five
[46:06] gats in your inner
[46:09] man are in your
[46:11] spirit now I have another word for
[46:15] Spirit we may want to call it
[46:19] intelligence we may want to call it
[46:22] mind or brain if you will but really we
[46:26] find that you see the man's
[46:29] mind is the man's
[46:32] Spirit you see are you following me now
[46:36] praise the praise the Lord do you
[46:38] understand what I'm talking about we all
[46:41] have those
[46:42] things I'm not talking about things from
[46:44] the
[46:45] Moon I'm not talking about
[46:49] zombies I'm not even talking about
[46:52] aliens I'm talking about human
[46:55] beings that's how our
[46:58] makeup whether we know it or we do not
[47:01] know praise the name of the Lord and now
[47:05] when man is
[47:07] born man is born with all the
[47:10] three Body Soul
[47:13] Spirit and the moment you come into the
[47:16] world you know you realize that you
[47:19] already uh have in your spirit memory
[47:23] affection imagination conscious and
[47:25] reasoning five
[47:31] G okay finally you you you overcame
[47:34] brother God
[47:35] bless so right over there point on the
[47:39] Spirit Room
[47:40] brother right there the
[47:43] yellow that's memory affection
[47:46] imagination conscious and
[47:52] reasoning but you see out of
[47:55] man there are many things that come at
[47:58] him that come to attack
[48:01] him pull him down to defeat
[48:04] him but you see those things cannot come
[48:07] into the man without using the
[48:12] gats they will use the
[48:16] gats for example last will come
[48:19] in and when last
[48:22] comes it will first come and attack the
[48:25] body and when it attacks the body it
[48:29] will have to have a gate it has
[48:34] used maybe the the Gate of
[48:38] taste maybe the Gate of
[48:40] feeling maybe the Gate of
[48:42] smell maybe the Gate of sin you know you
[48:46] see something and you become so
[48:49] lustful you know you you hear something
[48:52] and you know like that's why it is wrong
[48:54] to hear the wrong kind of music
[48:58] that's why it matters what we hear what
[48:59] we see what we smell what we you know we
[49:03] taste it is very
[49:07] important you know because those are
[49:10] gates to your soul you know if you close
[49:13] those Gates then your soul will be
[49:18] protected but you see before you reach
[49:20] you arrive at your
[49:23] soul the if those Gates on the body have
[49:26] opened
[49:28] up then you will find that the GS on the
[49:31] spirit
[49:33] also you know will open up because you
[49:37] smelled something or tested
[49:40] something or saw
[49:42] something then you begin to imagine
[49:46] it you see a right a wrong kind of
[49:49] video and then even if you are no longer
[49:52] seeing
[49:53] it the moment you open the gate of your
[49:56] eyes
[50:00] then now even if you close that
[50:03] gate and you see now I don't want to
[50:05] see you cannot un see because it has
[50:08] already
[50:10] entered now it goes into another another
[50:14] another Realm Of
[50:17] You the real of your
[50:19] spirit and now it will go in your
[50:24] imagination and then you begin to
[50:26] imagine the things you have
[50:28] seen you begin to see pictures the same
[50:31] same things you saw with your eyes you
[50:33] begin to see it in your
[50:35] [Applause]
[50:37] spirit you begin to imagine it and you
[50:41] can even remember it can go and be
[50:43] deposited in your memory even for
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:49] years and you remember what you saw many
[50:52] years
[50:54] ago and the moment you remember it it
[50:56] takes you back again in the feeling you
[51:01] have all these are
[51:04] interconnected and now you know when now
[51:07] you open the the gates of your
[51:11] spirit it comes straight at your
[51:14] soul and it begins to bring you
[51:17] doubt you begin to doubt the word of God
[51:19] instead of
[51:21] believing and then that's why you find
[51:23] many people
[51:25] backsliding someone who was in the
[51:27] church but then they they reach a moment
[51:30] they feel they are no longer
[51:33] Believers but you find that they had
[51:35] opened all these
[51:37] Gates when you open your Gates it opens
[51:40] you open it to a lot of
[51:44] spirits and when all those demons and
[51:46] spirits come in
[51:48] you they begin to eat up on
[51:51] you like cancer they eat you up they eat
[51:56] you up slowly but slow by slowly and
[51:59] before you know it you know you no
[52:02] longer
[52:03] believe you now have doubt on the
[52:06] word when someone reads you the word
[52:09] you're like I don't really see it that
[52:12] way I don't agree I don't accept because
[52:17] you have
[52:18] doubt and what brings doubt is because
[52:20] you open these other gates in your
[52:25] spirit
[52:28] but but but you see there is
[52:31] something very special about a be a
[52:35] child of God not a Believer but a child
[52:37] of
[52:40] God are you hearing me when do you
[52:43] believe praise the name of the Lord when
[52:46] do you believe do you believe before you
[52:49] are
[52:51] born answer me when do you believe you
[52:55] believe long before you were
[53:00] born when did you
[53:03] believe answer me
[53:07] Church you believe
[53:15] before when do you
[53:20] believe when he became of age how how
[53:24] did you
[53:25] believe
[53:28] after hearing H now we are coming after
[53:31] you hear the word then you you agree
[53:34] with
[53:36] it when you heard it you believe it you
[53:40] know the Bible says thatth we believe we
[53:42] hear with our
[53:44] ears that's now the Gate of
[53:47] hearing and we believe with our
[53:50] hearts right because when you open those
[53:53] Gates it goes straight on your heart
[53:58] and then you believe it and then you
[54:00] confess with your mouth so it it comes
[54:03] in your ears all the way to your heart
[54:06] and it comes back again on your
[54:08] mouth so you believe after hearing but
[54:12] when did you become a child of
[54:16] God yes my
[54:19] brother you be oh praise the name of the
[54:21] Lord you didn't even become a child of
[54:25] God you always a child of God before you
[54:29] were even born you were in the mind of
[54:32] God before the foundation
[54:34] of you are only come here in a space of
[54:38] time to be
[54:41] manifested to prove to the
[54:43] devil that you were always a child of
[54:47] God and that's why you see some people
[54:50] they come in the church and
[54:52] backslide and they never come back again
[54:55] but there are those who come and
[54:57] backslide and they will think that I
[54:59] never come back again but somehow they
[55:02] will always come back
[55:04] again why because there is something
[55:06] pulling on
[55:07] you in your heart amen among all
[55:12] children of
[55:13] God there is something we call a seed
[55:18] gen you know the the predestinated seed
[55:24] Gene as long as that Gene is in your
[55:29] heart you can never fall away from
[55:34] grace are you understand what I'm
[55:35] preaching you can never fall Away From
[55:39] Grace a mango cannot fall so far from
[55:42] the
[55:45] tree even when you fell away by the
[55:48] natural birth you were born
[55:53] in because now you need to put on your
[55:55] spiritual thinking capes
[55:59] today so you can understand what we're
[56:01] talking about because the way the nature
[56:03] we were
[56:05] born we were born in a nature that is
[56:10] sinful we were born you know with all
[56:13] our gates open to a lot of
[56:18] things our spirit was a wrong kind of
[56:21] spirit our our body was a wrong kind of
[56:24] course it's a wrong kind of body
[56:28] and in our hearts we had
[56:31] unbelief just like everybody else
[56:34] everyone is born like that but there is
[56:37] something special about you and
[56:40] me that we had a seed
[56:45] gen you cannot kill that seed
[56:48] Gene the devil cannot remove
[56:52] that he may take you in the world you
[56:55] can do a lot of things the world you can
[56:57] regret about what you did but one thing
[57:01] you will never fall Away From
[57:04] [Music]
[57:05] Grace because
[57:07] somehow when you hear the word the word
[57:11] will pull you back
[57:13] again to come where you
[57:16] belong a seat of God belongs in the
[57:18] house of
[57:20] God the seed of God must believe the
[57:22] word of
[57:24] God the seed of God can Never Fall
[57:28] Away a child of God can never go to
[57:33] hell this is truth this the truth I'm
[57:36] speaking this
[57:37] evening not very many people know
[57:40] it not very many people know it and even
[57:44] those who know it they know it
[57:47] unconsciously but we know it because of
[57:49] this precious
[57:52] message and that's why we ought to shout
[57:54] amen when it is being spoken
[57:58] I want you to
[57:59] imagine and think about it
[58:02] critically that you can never go to
[58:06] hell think about it that you can never
[58:09] go to
[58:10] hell you come to church because you're
[58:12] fearing to go to
[58:15] hell you are coming to church because
[58:17] the seed gen is drawing you
[58:21] here amen even when you do the wrong
[58:24] things the seed G
[58:27] when it hears the word it be pulled back
[58:30] again to the
[58:31] word let me tell you many of us even if
[58:35] he wanted to do the wrong
[58:37] things God will not allow us to do
[58:41] them not because we don't have the
[58:44] ability but because we have a SE in
[58:47] us that keeps pulling on us you know In
[58:51] the Flesh this flesh is sinful the Bible
[58:55] actually say there is there is another
[58:58] law working in this
[59:00] flesh amen there is another law
[59:02] completely different from the law of the
[59:05] word it's different from the law of the
[59:08] spirit and when you receive the Holy
[59:11] Ghost there is another law working in
[59:15] your soul and the moment that law is in
[59:18] there it will colonize and overcome the
[59:21] law in your
[59:24] flesh in that the flesh will have all
[59:26] the
[59:27] desires but there is something that
[59:30] happens that the law of the spirit in
[59:32] your
[59:33] soul will close all the
[59:37] gates Hallelujah it will be amen it will
[59:41] be a
[59:42] protector he'll be your God Amen to
[59:45] protect all the
[59:47] gates and not allow you to open any
[59:51] gate amen when you try to open the gate
[59:54] of seeing wrong things
[59:57] that law will tell you come on close
[59:58] that
[1:00:00] g Hallelujah and you find yourself
[1:00:03] closing
[1:00:04] the where if you want you know to hear
[1:00:06] the wrong kind of
[1:00:08] things you know that love the spirit
[1:00:10] will tell you come and close that
[1:00:12] gate and you I can't hear
[1:00:15] that do you know a
[1:00:19] Believer when even if you sat in even if
[1:00:23] you are renting around a
[1:00:24] place
[1:00:26] where they play wrong kind of
[1:00:28] music and you they make you hear it by
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:32] force do you know you can't find
[1:00:36] peace until you actually go away from
[1:00:39] there and find another
[1:00:41] house you can't find
[1:00:44] peace because the law of God in you will
[1:00:47] keep telling you close that gate close
[1:00:49] that gate until I can't stay
[1:00:54] here if you if you that's what happens
[1:00:59] for us not to fulfill the law of the
[1:01:01] flesh
[1:01:04] the the desires of the
[1:01:06] flesh otherwise if our gates were
[1:01:09] open then we like others would fulfill
[1:01:12] the desires of the
[1:01:15] flesh praise the name of the Lord so
[1:01:18] when I talk about the right mental
[1:01:21] attitude I'm really referring to the
[1:01:24] spirit now the spirit man
[1:01:27] and I want us today to talk about the
[1:01:29] spirit
[1:01:31] man when we come into to
[1:01:35] Christ we come with a wrong kind of
[1:01:39] mind our spirit is not
[1:01:42] good our spirit is
[1:01:45] confused our spirit is
[1:01:48] sinful our spirit has bad bad
[1:01:52] conscience you know wrong
[1:01:54] imagination wrong
[1:01:57] affections bad
[1:01:59] memory and when we come to the Lord the
[1:02:03] Bible says and be not conformed to the
[1:02:06] world but be ye
[1:02:09] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:02:14] mind that he may prove what is that
[1:02:17] good and
[1:02:19] acceptable and
[1:02:21] perfect and with the will of
[1:02:24] God how can you prove what is the will
[1:02:27] of
[1:02:29] God what is acceptable to God what is
[1:02:32] perfect to God what is good to God how
[1:02:36] can you prove it by
[1:02:40] transformation each of us has to go
[1:02:42] through a
[1:02:45] transformation amen our mind has to be
[1:02:50] renewed in Ezekiel
[1:02:53] 11:9 he says and I'll give them one
[1:02:57] heart and I will put a new spirit within
[1:03:01] you and I will make I will take the
[1:03:04] Stony heart out of their
[1:03:08] flesh and I will give them an heart of
[1:03:11] Flesh that they may walk in my
[1:03:14] statutes and keep my
[1:03:17] ordinances and do them that they shall
[1:03:20] be my
[1:03:21] people and I will be their
[1:03:23] God now did you hear that
[1:03:26] if you don't have a new heart a new mind
[1:03:28] a new
[1:03:31] spirit you cannot keep the statutes and
[1:03:35] the ordinances of
[1:03:39] God there is something I want us to
[1:03:40] learn
[1:03:42] today you see the problem that we have
[1:03:46] we have many uh people who are intending
[1:03:49] to be
[1:03:52] Believers but they cannot be able to
[1:03:54] keep up with the life
[1:03:58] because they do not have the
[1:04:02] ability if you understand say
[1:04:05] Amen to live a Christian
[1:04:08] life to live a life that is pleasing to
[1:04:11] God you must attain the
[1:04:16] ability look at a look at for instance
[1:04:19] um a
[1:04:22] pig the pig does not have the ability to
[1:04:25] live like
[1:04:28] sheep if you clean it up you wash it
[1:04:32] properly and you perfume
[1:04:35] it and you tell now little
[1:04:38] piggy I've built for you a beautiful
[1:04:42] house I want you to stay in
[1:04:44] here it's a nice glass
[1:04:48] house don't you ever go back into that
[1:04:51] M do you hear me little piggy will say
[1:04:56] yes I
[1:04:58] agree it's a LW to the little
[1:05:02] piggy and the pig will keep that
[1:05:07] law for as long as you have locked the
[1:05:10] door are you
[1:05:12] hearing but make when it
[1:05:15] rains and all mud is out
[1:05:19] there little piggy will be
[1:05:21] inside but dying to go out there
[1:05:26] I
[1:05:27] wish I wish I can get an
[1:05:31] opportunity to go and do those
[1:05:34] things look at other people the they
[1:05:38] mingling with the and
[1:05:40] the I'm missing out I'm missing out the
[1:05:45] the Sheep will tell the other the
[1:05:47] pig can't you see where where we it is
[1:05:50] clean and we enjoying
[1:05:53] ourselves put a song
[1:05:56] and the Sheep will begin
[1:05:58] singing I'm no longer a slave
[1:06:03] to I am a child God and the pig will be
[1:06:08] like I don't enjoy this
[1:06:11] music my heart and my makeup and my
[1:06:14] nature is out
[1:06:16] there please let me go he will try even
[1:06:20] to break the
[1:06:22] glass and the moment the door is open
[1:06:27] the at the earliest
[1:06:30] opportunity this little pig will
[1:06:33] rush and go into the
[1:06:36] slope and
[1:06:38] enjoy because that's his
[1:06:42] nature are you hearing me a True
[1:06:46] Believer can never be that
[1:06:49] one if you are like that it simply means
[1:06:54] the nature in you is not yet
[1:06:58] changed you need a change of
[1:07:02] Nature and a change the Bible says here
[1:07:04] you cannot fulfill the law of
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] Christ you cannot keep his
[1:07:11] ordinances if he has not put a new heart
[1:07:14] in
[1:07:14] you and then he puts a new spirit in
[1:07:18] you and then he puts he sping you are
[1:07:22] you hearing me otherwise you are just
[1:07:25] aie obeying the
[1:07:29] laws but you don't have the ability to
[1:07:32] live a Christian
[1:07:34] Life and if you're doing the works of
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:38] law you can never please
[1:07:42] God because those are your own works of
[1:07:46] right you know you dress well you don't
[1:07:50] dress miniskirts sisters you don't dress
[1:07:53] trousers you don't use makeup
[1:07:56] you know Brothers you don't do
[1:07:59] those and you wear as if they powered
[1:08:04] you and you begin walking like a
[1:08:07] girl because your nature is not yet
[1:08:11] changed but you see why you desire those
[1:08:15] things it's because your nature is not
[1:08:17] yet
[1:08:18] changed but if your nature is
[1:08:21] changed you cannot desire in your heart
[1:08:24] those things
[1:08:27] but now listen on the other side are you
[1:08:30] hearing me if you do these
[1:08:33] things in obedience to God's
[1:08:38] laws still it does not please
[1:08:47] God and there are many believers who are
[1:08:49] like
[1:08:51] that they are believers because they
[1:08:54] dress well
[1:08:57] they don't drink they don't smoke they
[1:09:00] come to church every
[1:09:01] service and because of that they
[1:09:04] Believers and they have never had an
[1:09:07] experience and they have never changed
[1:09:11] but they Believers by
[1:09:13] name but these kind of Believers at the
[1:09:17] earliest
[1:09:19] opportunity you will find them behaving
[1:09:22] like the other people in the world
[1:09:27] and many of us we are
[1:09:30] surprised I thought the brother was a
[1:09:33] Believer don't don't even say you
[1:09:36] thought he was never a Believer to
[1:09:40] begin he was simply following laws and
[1:09:43] rules and when you ever feel that this
[1:09:46] message this word of God is rules and
[1:09:51] laws because you have never had an
[1:09:54] experience
[1:09:57] but the moment you have an
[1:09:59] experience your right your mental
[1:10:02] attitude about the word will
[1:10:08] change to fulfill the word will be so
[1:10:12] easy because it is not you do fulfill
[1:10:14] the word it is Christ in
[1:10:19] you fulfilling his own
[1:10:22] way it's a new nature a new life in you
[1:10:27] oh may God give us a new
[1:10:29] mind we are all born with a perverted
[1:10:33] mind we were all born in
[1:10:36] sin we were all born lasting after the
[1:10:40] things of the world everybody lasted
[1:10:45] after the only thing that keeps many
[1:10:50] Believers and I said Believers in
[1:10:53] qutes the only things that keeps many
[1:10:58] Believers soal
[1:11:00] Believers from doing the things that
[1:11:02] they used to
[1:11:04] do is good
[1:11:07] parents solid Society
[1:11:15] cultures in our culture we don't behave
[1:11:17] like
[1:11:18] that you don't do that and then you
[1:11:21] don't do those
[1:11:23] things if you're born in a good family
[1:11:27] or maybe your church is very strict and
[1:11:28] the
[1:11:29] teach or maybe even
[1:11:33] religion
[1:11:34] religion for example Muslims dress dress
[1:11:38] they cover their body because of their
[1:11:42] religion but the Bible tells us women
[1:11:44] should dress
[1:11:47] modestly but there are many even
[1:11:49] believers who are not dressing good yet
[1:11:52] Muslims are covering their whole
[1:11:54] body
[1:11:57] so I'm showing you that it is possible
[1:11:59] to to to do the laws of the
[1:12:04] word because you doing it
[1:12:09] religiously or you fulfilling your
[1:12:11] cultural
[1:12:15] norms that does not please
[1:12:17] God that does not prove that you have a
[1:12:20] renewed
[1:12:22] mind to try and acquire the promises of
[1:12:25] of the
[1:12:27] word you would need to fulfill the law
[1:12:29] of
[1:12:31] God which is the word of God no no man
[1:12:34] in their natural mind can fulfill the
[1:12:36] law of
[1:12:42] Christ you didn't get it let me man in
[1:12:45] his
[1:12:46] natural
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:52] mind the law of Christ no man no
[1:12:57] man in his natural
[1:13:01] mind so you have to lose your
[1:13:04] mind to fulfill the law of
[1:13:08] Christ the mind you were born
[1:13:11] with is not the right
[1:13:14] mind you have to renew your
[1:13:17] mind all right I know you are listening
[1:13:20] in and that is good but I want I want
[1:13:22] this to stay with
[1:13:24] you we would need to have a new
[1:13:28] mind we would need to be you know how
[1:13:31] can a man who already born have a new
[1:13:34] mind when he's alive
[1:13:39] already that man would need to die
[1:13:44] first and then be born
[1:13:48] again that's why the Bible says in the
[1:13:50] book of you know
[1:13:53] John that he must be born
[1:13:56] again he must be born
[1:13:59] again it is not may be born
[1:14:02] again can be born
[1:14:06] again he says must be born
[1:14:09] again are you hearing what I'm preaching
[1:14:12] brother you must be born
[1:14:15] again if you remain the way the
[1:14:20] are you can never please
[1:14:23] God the
[1:14:28] me
[1:14:29] I'm you will never see
[1:14:31] God you have to be born
[1:14:35] again but to be born again you need to
[1:14:39] die
[1:14:40] first and what can you do to be to to to
[1:14:43] be to
[1:14:45] die that's the problem many Believers
[1:14:49] don't want to
[1:14:51] die they don't want to die to their
[1:14:55] to their original Natural
[1:14:59] Life they want to remain the way they
[1:15:02] were
[1:15:03] are that is why I
[1:15:05] believe that when you become a
[1:15:08] Believer even some cultural Traditions
[1:15:11] have to
[1:15:14] die as long as your tradition is against
[1:15:17] or contrary to the
[1:15:20] world then it must
[1:15:23] die or you can never born
[1:15:26] again you find someone keeping a
[1:15:30] shrine someone keeping a
[1:15:32] shrine behind the
[1:15:35] house but they are saying they
[1:15:37] Christians they reading the
[1:15:40] Bible some of them are even
[1:15:42] preaching how can you prove to
[1:15:45] us that you can amen keep your culture
[1:15:49] of having a
[1:15:51] shrine and worshiping the small God and
[1:15:55] worshiping your
[1:15:56] idol and you are born again you have not
[1:16:00] died to begin with you have to die to
[1:16:03] those
[1:16:04] things you have to die to your mind you
[1:16:07] have to die to your thoughts you have to
[1:16:10] die to your way you have to die to
[1:16:14] everything when a man dies he does not
[1:16:18] die
[1:16:20] halfway you die
[1:16:22] fully and you are buried
[1:16:25] but this case the Bible says when we are
[1:16:28] bued in
[1:16:30] Christen We rise up again amen the Bible
[1:16:34] says all things have passed
[1:16:37] away behold all things are new we dead
[1:16:41] to the old man we born again to the new
[1:16:45] man our mind has been
[1:16:49] renewed but the problem with the younger
[1:16:52] generation they don't want to renew
[1:16:54] their
[1:16:57] that's why you preach the word and they
[1:16:59] will never do those things they will
[1:17:02] remain at saying
[1:17:03] amen but they don't have the power to do
[1:17:06] that when they hear them they say from
[1:17:10] today I'm going to do this but when they
[1:17:13] go from the
[1:17:15] church from that day they will do the
[1:17:18] way they were doing
[1:17:20] it what is the problem they want to do
[1:17:24] it but they don't have the power they
[1:17:27] don't have the ability the ability of
[1:17:30] fulfilling the ways of
[1:17:32] God is only in
[1:17:36] dying is in being
[1:17:38] renewed The Nature has to be
[1:17:42] change Take This Heart of the
[1:17:45] pig Hallelujah and give it a new
[1:17:49] heart take the spirit of a pig and give
[1:17:53] it a new spirit and then put in a
[1:17:57] spirit Hallelujah of God in there and
[1:18:01] then
[1:18:01] notice it will live a different
[1:18:05] life the desires will change
[1:18:10] permanently Brethren it is not difficult
[1:18:15] to live a Christian
[1:18:18] life but the trouble of it is many try
[1:18:22] to live a Christian
[1:18:23] Life
[1:18:25] with their old
[1:18:28] nature that's the
[1:18:30] problem your Nature has to
[1:18:33] die tell your neighbor your Nature has
[1:18:35] to
[1:18:37] die your Nature has to
[1:18:40] die how does it die you submit
[1:18:44] yourself before God say Here I Am Lord I
[1:18:50] I I
[1:18:51] admit I am born in sin my nature is
[1:18:55] right Lord kill me where do you die you
[1:19:00] die at the
[1:19:02] altar that's where death
[1:19:05] happens and whenever we come in the
[1:19:07] house of God we are coming to
[1:19:10] die Paul said I Die
[1:19:13] daily you have to die every
[1:19:16] day that's why you have to read the word
[1:19:18] of God every day that's why you have to
[1:19:20] pray every day because we die daily
[1:19:26] if you try to be a believer with your
[1:19:28] original
[1:19:31] nature that will show
[1:19:33] fail it will
[1:19:35] fail you cannot do it because that
[1:19:40] nature was
[1:19:42] created rather was born in a fallen
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:47] State because of sin we were we were
[1:19:52] born by last
[1:19:57] of the
[1:19:58] flesh all of
[1:20:00] us all of you we born that
[1:20:04] way and that is why sin RS in our
[1:20:12] body that is the reason
[1:20:14] why you want to do
[1:20:16] good but evil is
[1:20:20] PR so how can you overcome
[1:20:23] that the have to be
[1:20:26] closed but the gates for them to be
[1:20:30] closed you will need something powerful
[1:20:33] on the control
[1:20:38] center you need a
[1:20:41] controller on the control
[1:20:44] center where is the control center of
[1:20:46] your
[1:20:47] kingdom right there on your
[1:20:50] soul amen if Jesus is Seated on your
[1:20:54] soul
[1:20:56] then he's controlling you then he's
[1:20:58] leading you and how can Jesus sit
[1:21:03] there by filling you with the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost how do you receive the Holy
[1:21:10] Spirit you receive the Holy Spirit by
[1:21:12] Believing by
[1:21:15] faith but he first he said I'm going to
[1:21:18] put a new
[1:21:20] heart what will the new heart
[1:21:23] do heart will accept the
[1:21:27] word it is a good
[1:21:31] atmosphere and then he will put a new
[1:21:34] spirit and today we are speaking about
[1:21:36] the
[1:21:38] spirit when he puts a new spirit in
[1:21:43] you all the
[1:21:45] doors cannot open the doors of your
[1:21:48] spirit cannot open to the wrong
[1:21:53] side and once he has protected
[1:21:56] you then now he himself will
[1:21:59] come and take the seat on the throne of
[1:22:04] your
[1:22:04] heart now people ask me
[1:22:07] questions does it does it mean the
[1:22:09] desire on my flesh the desires of the
[1:22:12] world go
[1:22:16] away does it mean last is no longer in
[1:22:19] my
[1:22:20] body does it mean that I I don't have
[1:22:23] any even a piece of
[1:22:26] hatred do mean all these things are
[1:22:31] gone
[1:22:33] no but they are on the outside of
[1:22:38] you but the
[1:22:41] gates if they were
[1:22:43] open those things will come right back
[1:22:46] to
[1:22:48] you and when you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:22:51] he keeps all the gates
[1:22:53] closed
[1:22:55] he gives you what we call selfcontrol
[1:22:59] you are he's controlling from the Tower
[1:23:02] of your
[1:23:04] heart well if you listen to wrong
[1:23:08] music the holy spirit will tell you shut
[1:23:10] shut that door shut that door shut that
[1:23:13] door and he walk away from that kind
[1:23:16] of and when you walk away you protected
[1:23:20] yourself from many many things but was
[1:23:24] it your action it was a work of the Holy
[1:23:31] Spirit you you you will not you will go
[1:23:33] to your page to your computer to your
[1:23:35] iPad to your
[1:23:38] phone to go and watch wrong
[1:23:41] things and the Holy Spirit will tell you
[1:23:44] close that g close that G but now a
[1:23:48] Christian who does not have the Holy
[1:23:50] Spirit doesn't have that
[1:23:53] power
[1:23:55] are you following me you know I'm
[1:23:57] preaching this because I want you to see
[1:23:58] the need to have the Holy
[1:24:03] Spirit you will be a Christian you
[1:24:06] believe everything every Everybody
[1:24:09] believes you agree with the word of God
[1:24:13] but within you you do not have Christ on
[1:24:17] the control center of your
[1:24:21] heart so you will do wrong things
[1:24:25] at the earliest
[1:24:29] opportunity he will have mercy on those
[1:24:31] have mercy
[1:24:33] on let me do it and I will
[1:24:38] repent you have never been
[1:24:40] changed you've never been
[1:24:45] reborn there's a song that talks about
[1:24:48] Grace says God's grace
[1:24:51] taught to
[1:24:53] fear you know when you come to him even
[1:24:57] when you come next to
[1:24:59] sin you it brings a lot of fear on
[1:25:03] your you will feel
[1:25:06] uncomfortable how many have ever felt
[1:25:10] that right there that is the holy
[1:25:14] spirit he he creat that fear in
[1:25:18] you you can't do that you can't do that
[1:25:22] and let me do it
[1:25:25] you
[1:25:27] cannot and then you will walk away I
[1:25:30] can't do it what
[1:25:33] happened he's on the control
[1:25:36] tower the man on the control
[1:25:39] tower he's controlling you it's not that
[1:25:43] he's controlling us we also have our
[1:25:45] will to
[1:25:47] make but now that's what I'm talking
[1:25:49] about
[1:25:50] today our will our mind
[1:25:55] so enclosed in with
[1:25:59] his we agree with
[1:26:05] him in Genesis before sin came
[1:26:09] in would say that God left
[1:26:14] Adam to name all the
[1:26:17] animals Adam would say it's a
[1:26:20] lion God would say amen that's right
[1:26:24] because that's the mind of
[1:26:26] God Adam did not create
[1:26:30] it it was the mind of
[1:26:32] God but Adam agreed with
[1:26:35] God because his mind was one with
[1:26:39] God the things you do all the things you
[1:26:43] do you have already done them in your
[1:26:47] mind before you do them in
[1:26:50] the and that's why the law we have
[1:26:53] received
[1:26:56] oh my may you receive this today the law
[1:26:59] we have
[1:27:00] received is not the law of sin and
[1:27:03] death it's not the law like that of the
[1:27:06] Old
[1:27:07] Testament the law of Works rules of do
[1:27:12] and
[1:27:12] don'ts the message is not that way the
[1:27:16] law we have now is the law of spirit of
[1:27:21] life when that amen Jesus Christ the
[1:27:25] spirit of him when he he dwells in
[1:27:27] you he quickens your mot
[1:27:32] body and he brings your B unto
[1:27:37] subjection whereby in the Old
[1:27:40] Testament they were supposed to do an
[1:27:43] act and then they are sinners but here
[1:27:47] today before even the ACT has been done
[1:27:51] we already
[1:27:52] arrested already arrested
[1:27:55] spiritual
[1:27:56] law it works within our members it works
[1:28:00] within our souls that's why I said
[1:28:02] before you do anything you have already
[1:28:04] done
[1:28:06] it and the Bible says when a man looks
[1:28:08] at a
[1:28:10] woman to last
[1:28:13] after he has already
[1:28:16] committed in his heart with
[1:28:20] her how come yet in the Old Testament it
[1:28:24] was not that way it was until he has
[1:28:27] done the
[1:28:28] act so the difference here is the one
[1:28:32] today is more
[1:28:34] powerful amen it arrests us before we
[1:28:38] actually
[1:28:41] sin it brings
[1:28:45] righteousness that's why he said
[1:28:48] here let me read this portion again for
[1:28:51] you and he put on the new man
[1:28:56] which after God is created in
[1:29:01] righteousness and true
[1:29:05] Holiness true Holiness is not our
[1:29:08] works but true Holiness is his Works in
[1:29:13] us when a man has no Holy
[1:29:17] Spirit he has no power to do the works
[1:29:19] of the Holy
[1:29:21] Ghost that is doing his own works
[1:29:25] wish to go a filthy
[1:29:29] rugs so you have many
[1:29:31] believers who are actually before God
[1:29:34] not
[1:29:35] holy through Holiness and through
[1:29:39] righteousness is from the working of the
[1:29:41] holy spirit in
[1:29:45] you so now the question is what can I
[1:29:49] do if I don't have the power to live
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] seek the Holy
[1:29:56] Spirit come before God
[1:29:59] reverently go in a personal altar
[1:30:02] somewhere go somewhere and
[1:30:05] pray because you each of us know each
[1:30:09] other we know ourselves you know whether
[1:30:12] you are born again or
[1:30:14] not you know whether you filled the holy
[1:30:16] ghost or
[1:30:18] not you cannot be born and you don't
[1:30:21] know I am born and and you are born and
[1:30:24] you all of
[1:30:25] us so if you born
[1:30:27] again by the spirit of God you
[1:30:31] know praise God and so if you need to
[1:30:35] amen live that kind of
[1:30:39] life and you realize you're living a
[1:30:41] defeated Christian
[1:30:43] life you don't have to struggle about
[1:30:48] anything you don't even have to come and
[1:30:50] do this halfhazard
[1:30:52] prayers
[1:30:55] when the pastor preaches and the word
[1:30:58] touches you because you have a seed gen
[1:31:01] of of God in
[1:31:02] you
[1:31:04] like I believe it Lord from today I'm
[1:31:08] not going to do that
[1:31:10] anym you are a liar you know you will do
[1:31:13] it
[1:31:14] again stop promising
[1:31:17] God that you will not do
[1:31:20] anything the more you do that the more
[1:31:24] God looks on and laughs at
[1:31:26] you because God knows within you you
[1:31:31] have no power to do
[1:31:33] that if you did why did he die he died
[1:31:38] in order
[1:31:40] Hallelujah he died in order to give us
[1:31:43] the
[1:31:45] power he died Amen to give us the
[1:31:49] ability oh come on listen to me amen he
[1:31:52] died to give us the ability
[1:31:55] to live a Christian Life he died to give
[1:31:57] us the ability to do the things we could
[1:32:00] not do
[1:32:01] before he died to make us more than
[1:32:05] conquerors and his death has done that
[1:32:08] for
[1:32:09] us because when he died he rose again
[1:32:13] and when he rose again he went up to
[1:32:16] heaven and then he came back again in
[1:32:19] the form of the Holy
[1:32:21] Ghost so what is the Holy Spirit
[1:32:24] the holy spirit is the mighty
[1:32:27] conqueror living in the heart of a
[1:32:31] Believer and if you do not have the Holy
[1:32:34] Spirit you have no power to
[1:32:37] overcome you will always live at
[1:32:39] defeated Life as
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:43] a and what you can
[1:32:45] promise God from
[1:32:47] today I'm no longer doing
[1:32:50] this and as a human being according to
[1:32:54] your resilience and
[1:32:56] strength you will try you will do it
[1:33:01] step for a
[1:33:03] while and then you
[1:33:06] say this is too much for me and some
[1:33:09] even leave
[1:33:11] church they said these things are
[1:33:15] difficult your standard is too
[1:33:18] high that's why when you bring new
[1:33:20] people in the
[1:33:22] church pointing them to the rules of dos
[1:33:25] and
[1:33:28] don'ts they have the power within them
[1:33:30] to do
[1:33:32] it they don't so what do they need they
[1:33:36] need to be pointed to
[1:33:38] Christ Christ is the
[1:33:41] word Christ is the Holy
[1:33:43] Ghost if if new people can come
[1:33:46] in then you know come at the
[1:33:48] alter of the word the outter prayer you
[1:33:53] know what do what happen is God will
[1:33:55] fill them with the Holy Spirit change
[1:33:57] them
[1:33:58] permanently and they will
[1:34:01] change their
[1:34:02] appetites they will change their friends
[1:34:06] they will change their circles they
[1:34:08] change their mind their
[1:34:10] thought why it is not you doing it it's
[1:34:13] not a pastor doing it it is Jesus
[1:34:17] Christ on the throne of their
[1:34:20] heart and that's why when a church when
[1:34:23] you're preaching to to people who don't
[1:34:24] have the Holy
[1:34:26] Spirit that church is very
[1:34:30] difficult even to Pastor a church of
[1:34:32] people who the majority when they don't
[1:34:34] have the Holy
[1:34:37] Spirit it is a very difficult Church to
[1:34:42] Pastor I'm telling you because everybody
[1:34:47] are pushing
[1:34:48] them pulling them you're forcing them
[1:34:52] even to come to church
[1:34:54] you're forcing them you're pushing them
[1:34:57] even on the small small
[1:34:58] things praying they can't even have
[1:35:04] family let me tell you if you have the
[1:35:07] Holy
[1:35:08] Spirit you can't sleep without
[1:35:11] praying so some of you who are asking do
[1:35:13] I have or do I not let me tell you if
[1:35:16] you are sleeping without praying you
[1:35:17] don't have the Holy
[1:35:22] Spirit
[1:35:24] and you you are in a
[1:35:26] family and you don't have family
[1:35:29] alar you don't pray you don't read the
[1:35:33] word you don't have an in your
[1:35:37] home which means you don't have the Hool
[1:35:40] spirit so what then do you need to do
[1:35:44] come and ask God to fill you with the
[1:35:46] Holy
[1:35:49] Spirit he fills the holy spirit with
[1:35:51] those who desire it I'm
[1:35:54] imagining is in
[1:35:57] somebody and somebody comes to
[1:36:00] church and the word is going
[1:36:02] on and they
[1:36:06] sleeping think about it that may be
[1:36:09] difficult for you let me give you
[1:36:11] another example think about this someone
[1:36:16] has a
[1:36:16] spirit football in
[1:36:19] him and he goes to a
[1:36:22] football
[1:36:24] and
[1:36:26] begins have you ever seen anyone do
[1:36:30] that I've never seen
[1:36:33] anyone they all on
[1:36:37] fire removing
[1:36:40] their it's a spirit of
[1:36:43] football in the same way if you have the
[1:36:46] spirit of Christ
[1:36:47] in you will your
[1:36:52] team if have the Holy Spirit when you
[1:36:55] come to church you will not be
[1:36:58] cold you will not be
[1:37:00] lukewarm you will not be
[1:37:04] indifferent I'm sorry I'm making very
[1:37:06] hard
[1:37:07] statement when you come to church and
[1:37:11] the only thing you do is just to be
[1:37:14] there even saying amen is very
[1:37:17] heavy your is coming from very
[1:37:20] far it means your mind is not r
[1:37:26] it means you are still heavy you need to
[1:37:29] be filled in your
[1:37:31] house let me tell you have the
[1:37:34] desire if you know you are not filled in
[1:37:36] your
[1:37:38] heart come out of your comfort
[1:37:40] zone go somewhere and
[1:37:43] pray it's not just to come and preach to
[1:37:46] you and then you receive
[1:37:48] no go go and seek
[1:37:52] him like
[1:37:55] like this man Jacob he wrestled all
[1:37:59] night said leave me he said I'll not
[1:38:02] leave you until you fill me and change
[1:38:06] my name change my name that's when I
[1:38:09] will leave you bless me that's when I
[1:38:12] will leave you let me tell you you have
[1:38:13] to go
[1:38:15] somewhere and
[1:38:22] pray
[1:38:24] me I
[1:38:25] mean you know just believe the
[1:38:29] word then don't worry you have the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit it is beyond that the devil also
[1:38:36] believes the
[1:38:38] word you know that the Bible says you
[1:38:41] believe in one
[1:38:43] God and it says even the devil believes
[1:38:45] it and even
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:48] trembles now you believe but you don't
[1:38:52] even
[1:38:55] some believer don't even
[1:38:58] tremble but the devil
[1:39:00] believes and it
[1:39:03] begins because of the word so believing
[1:39:06] is not
[1:39:08] enough after
[1:39:10] believing then you need to take another
[1:39:13] step amen of asking God to come in your
[1:39:17] life and fill you with his
[1:39:20] life you have to have an experience
[1:39:24] you have to know for sure that I have
[1:39:26] received the Holy Ghost in my
[1:39:28] soul and the Holy Ghost is not
[1:39:32] emotional because you were
[1:39:34] emotional and then you was
[1:39:36] fill no the Holy Ghost is not
[1:39:40] emotional it's not even speaking
[1:39:43] Tong it's not even
[1:39:45] prophesying it's not falling down the
[1:39:48] Holy Ghost is not those things although
[1:39:51] when he comes those things can
[1:39:55] happen and always those things
[1:39:58] happen but the holy spirit is a
[1:40:03] life when it comes in your life your
[1:40:07] life will
[1:40:08] change your mind shall be
[1:40:11] renewed you receive a new mental
[1:40:16] attitude and told us here that when you
[1:40:20] have a right mental
[1:40:22] attitud
[1:40:24] the word of
[1:40:32] God praise the name of the
[1:40:35] Lord there are many things talk about on
[1:40:38] this
[1:40:40] subject but let us see how the holy
[1:40:42] spirit will lead us in the next few
[1:40:44] moments I'll close in the next few
[1:40:47] moments now let us go through these
[1:40:50] things a little
[1:40:57] uh what is a new
[1:41:02] spirit um first of all we have seen the
[1:41:04] five
[1:41:08] gats which one of them is your
[1:41:13] memory now when you get a new
[1:41:17] memory you will you will only remember
[1:41:20] what God speaks of
[1:41:22] you
[1:41:26] are you hearing me all things have
[1:41:28] passed away to
[1:41:30] you all things are
[1:41:32] new praise God your
[1:41:36] mistakes your sins and the past are
[1:41:39] behind
[1:41:40] you like God you forgot
[1:41:46] all I'm not hearing any
[1:41:49] amen like God you forgot all of your
[1:41:52] past
[1:41:55] you know when you come and repent your
[1:41:57] sins before
[1:41:59] God God forgets it how many knew that
[1:42:02] say
[1:42:04] amen God forgets
[1:42:06] it now when the devil the says the devil
[1:42:09] is the accus of the
[1:42:11] Brethren so when the Devil comes to
[1:42:13] accuse you before
[1:42:14] God God will say I don't
[1:42:17] remember what did he do he did this and
[1:42:20] this I don't remember but now when you
[1:42:24] receive a new mind your memory will also
[1:42:29] change it will be how many know the
[1:42:32] memories in in a laptop or
[1:42:35] computer we even know memory card in our
[1:42:39] phones you know you can change that
[1:42:42] memory you can remove that memory and
[1:42:45] you put a new memory now when God gives
[1:42:48] you a new
[1:42:49] spirit he changes your memory
[1:42:53] he removes your old memory and puts a
[1:42:56] new memory whereby you don't remember
[1:42:59] the things you
[1:43:02] did in your natural memory you
[1:43:05] remember but in your new
[1:43:07] memory someone will tell you come on we
[1:43:09] used to do this I'm sorry I am a new man
[1:43:14] I don't even know how to do that thing
[1:43:16] anymore because I I am
[1:43:18] changed praise the name of the
[1:43:21] Lord number two you are
[1:43:25] affections affection is a feeling of
[1:43:31] liking care or fness for someone or
[1:43:37] something you know
[1:43:40] affection some you know the things you
[1:43:42] care
[1:43:43] about you know when you he oh so and so
[1:43:46] will know that I've done this and you'll
[1:43:47] feel
[1:43:50] bad you know I like so so much this
[1:43:53] thing I
[1:43:54] like you know I like something or
[1:43:56] someone so
[1:43:57] much you know I'm so fond of this so F
[1:44:00] of
[1:44:01] that some people are so fond of
[1:44:05] alcohol other are so fond of you know
[1:44:10] immorality
[1:44:14] affection other people are so fond of
[1:44:19] movies you know you find that so and so
[1:44:23] Loves movies so
[1:44:27] much they will watch until past midnight
[1:44:32] until and especially Our Generation you
[1:44:35] find younger people they don't sleep at
[1:44:36] night because they are watching films or
[1:44:38] they doing those kind of
[1:44:42] things and that's why they become so
[1:44:44] lazy during day
[1:44:46] time they can't do anything
[1:44:49] sensible because that that Spirit has
[1:44:52] already taken all the strength out of
[1:44:55] them he created night for
[1:44:59] sleep and for work but they so fond of
[1:45:03] things they're doing at night and they
[1:45:04] can't sleep and then during day they
[1:45:06] can't
[1:45:09] work they can't even think of ideas to
[1:45:13] to generate
[1:45:14] income you know others they so F of
[1:45:18] games even when he's in church his hands
[1:45:21] are
[1:45:21] moving
[1:45:23] the pastor is preaching but
[1:45:26] really his hands is already doing the
[1:45:30] games the pastor saying
[1:45:36] hallelujah his hands already doing the I
[1:45:40] hope I don't have anyone like that here
[1:45:42] today they so fond of that your
[1:45:46] affection is towards those
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:50] things that is a clear sign
[1:45:54] you you don't have even a new
[1:45:57] spirit because when it gives you a new
[1:46:00] spirit your affection
[1:46:08] changes Colossians 3:22 says set your
[1:46:11] affection on things
[1:46:17] above not on things on the
[1:46:20] earth for you are dead tell your
[1:46:23] neighbor you are
[1:46:25] dead and your life is hid with Christ in
[1:46:31] God praise the name of the Lord you are
[1:46:34] dead and your life is hid in Christ with
[1:46:36] Christ in
[1:46:38] God set your things set your affection
[1:46:41] on things
[1:46:43] about what what do you
[1:46:49] cherish let me take a moment I know
[1:46:51] today I know I was going to talk things
[1:46:53] that like are really Discerning your
[1:46:59] lives I wanted to take it
[1:47:02] slowly I wanted to think about
[1:47:05] this where is your
[1:47:10] affection where is your
[1:47:13] affection what is it that you put your
[1:47:15] heart
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] to they have put their affection on
[1:47:21] money
[1:47:23] others and
[1:47:26] family things that are not
[1:47:29] seen not
[1:47:32] seen but they have put their affection
[1:47:34] on
[1:47:38] those you can't even put your affection
[1:47:40] on things
[1:47:42] above you can't even think about the
[1:47:44] supernatural
[1:47:46] things you can't think about the things
[1:47:49] of
[1:47:50] God that's why they never pray
[1:47:53] never find for God never read the
[1:47:56] Bible if I ask here how many have
[1:47:59] finished this
[1:48:01] Bible how many will raise up their
[1:48:05] hands and one Muslim
[1:48:08] said Christians are people who never
[1:48:10] read
[1:48:13] the it's what we
[1:48:16] believe it's what makes us who we
[1:48:18] are but very few
[1:48:21] Christians take the
[1:48:23] time to sit down and take the Bible and
[1:48:28] read
[1:48:29] it where is our
[1:48:34] affection when he gives you a new
[1:48:37] spirit he changes your
[1:48:40] affection he changes also your
[1:48:46] imagination The Faculty imagination is a
[1:48:49] faculty or action of forming new
[1:48:51] ideas
[1:48:56] or images or concepts of external
[1:48:59] objects not present to the
[1:49:05] senses so your thinking
[1:49:09] capability for new to form new
[1:49:13] ideas you imagine
[1:49:17] things you know uh there are many
[1:49:19] scriptures I would have read about
[1:49:21] imagination
[1:49:23] but in Proverbs 12 it says 20 deceit is
[1:49:25] in the heart of them that imagine
[1:49:30] evil and so and and God in Genesis 65 he
[1:49:34] says and God saw that the wickedness of
[1:49:36] a man was great in the
[1:49:42] earth and that every imagination of the
[1:49:45] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:49:50] continually so you see this is after
[1:49:53] after the sin came into the
[1:49:56] world so man continue to imagine
[1:50:02] evil let me ask you a question today
[1:50:06] when you sit there what do you always
[1:50:11] imagine I even know of people who you
[1:50:14] know they repeatedly become
[1:50:18] sad you know some people have that kind
[1:50:21] of spirit
[1:50:23] they're happy happy happy and
[1:50:26] then you find them like
[1:50:28] that you one time I asked one young lady
[1:50:33] I said tell me what goes on in your
[1:50:36] mind said nothing said tell me and then
[1:50:41] after she said I be imagining bad
[1:50:45] things what if this happens what that
[1:50:48] happens I will do this
[1:50:50] I it's a wrong spirit
[1:50:53] because they don't have a new
[1:50:55] spirit your old nature of your old
[1:51:00] spirit gives you wrong
[1:51:04] imaginations you begin imagining wrong
[1:51:07] things bad things you never imagine
[1:51:11] good after sin came into the world the
[1:51:15] Bible says the hearts of
[1:51:17] people
[1:51:19] continually imagined evil
[1:51:24] their
[1:51:25] imagination the thoughts of their heart
[1:51:28] was evil
[1:51:30] continuous and God wanted to destroy all
[1:51:32] of them do you know that your bad your
[1:51:35] evil imagination can actually make God
[1:51:37] destroy
[1:51:40] you but you have no
[1:51:43] power until God gives you a new
[1:51:46] spirit when he gives you a new spirit
[1:51:49] you begin imagining new
[1:51:51] things
[1:51:53] is completely
[1:51:55] different you are no longer imagining
[1:51:58] evil but you are imagining right
[1:52:01] things what you will open your gate the
[1:52:06] Gate of imagination
[1:52:11] too if I I put it to
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:17] myself can I reach out to 10 Souls
[1:52:25] every
[1:52:27] month I
[1:52:29] can 10 Souls every
[1:52:32] month and then you'll pick up a book I'm
[1:52:35] going to begin writing them I reach out
[1:52:37] to somebody give them a tra invite them
[1:52:40] to church teach them tell them about the
[1:52:43] message what I know and then I invite
[1:52:46] them to church and I write their name
[1:52:48] and
[1:52:49] contact and I'll keep contacting them
[1:52:52] it's an
[1:52:55] imagination you tell me to prove
[1:52:58] it I just imagined it right
[1:53:01] now you to can imagine things like
[1:53:05] that what can you do for the if your
[1:53:09] affection is set things
[1:53:12] above then your
[1:53:14] imagination is going to be a good
[1:53:18] imagination but you find younger men
[1:53:21] women
[1:53:23] if you were to oh God have
[1:53:25] mercy if you were to just brother let me
[1:53:28] see through the door of your
[1:53:39] imag that silence means it
[1:53:43] all your
[1:53:45] imagination what are you
[1:53:48] imagining God sees
[1:53:51] everything God knows everything and
[1:53:54] doesn't want you to be
[1:53:55] that he wants you to have a new
[1:53:59] imagination and when it gives you a new
[1:54:02] spirit you have a new
[1:54:06] imagination I'll take two more and then
[1:54:08] I'll
[1:54:08] close
[1:54:10] conscience if he gives you a new
[1:54:13] spirit he gives you a new
[1:54:17] conscience conscious is a passionate
[1:54:19] moral sense of right and wrong
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:28] viewed as acting as a guide to one's
[1:54:36] Behavior the Bible speaks about people
[1:54:38] having their conscience seared with a
[1:54:40] hot
[1:54:46] iron but to the pure he said all things
[1:54:49] are
[1:54:50] pure to the def and and believing is
[1:54:53] nothing
[1:54:56] pure and even their mind and conscious
[1:54:58] is
[1:55:01] defiled the speaks the spirit speaketh
[1:55:05] expressly that in the latter times shall
[1:55:08] depart from the
[1:55:10] faith giving he to seducing
[1:55:13] spirits and of devils speaking Li in
[1:55:19] hypocrisy having their conscience
[1:55:25] seed with a h
[1:55:27] iron do you know that when human being
[1:55:30] can give himself to seducing
[1:55:34] spirits to wrong
[1:55:37] doctrines after he has departed from the
[1:55:40] faith and he listen listen don't miss
[1:55:42] this and his
[1:55:46] conscience will actually be
[1:55:50] seed with a hot iron
[1:55:55] whereby he does not have a sense of
[1:55:58] right and
[1:56:02] wrong have you ever seen people who
[1:56:04] murder
[1:56:06] others recently actually sister Esther
[1:56:09] you know called in and told
[1:56:11] me someone came into her
[1:56:14] house with a panga broke into the house
[1:56:18] she was outside and when when she
[1:56:21] entered in the person tried to pull her
[1:56:23] in so that he can cut
[1:56:25] her so that he can cut her but somehow
[1:56:30] you know God helped her and she pulled
[1:56:32] herself
[1:56:33] out and then she shouted and people came
[1:56:36] to
[1:56:37] help and the man ran away and threw the
[1:56:40] panga
[1:56:42] down what do you think that kind of man
[1:56:44] is
[1:56:46] conscious does he have a conscious
[1:56:51] any his cons his conscious is
[1:56:58] seed you can cut your
[1:57:00] neck and not feel a
[1:57:04] thing may God help
[1:57:06] us that we will have a sense of right
[1:57:08] and
[1:57:11] wrong that our conscious will always
[1:57:13] lead and guide
[1:57:17] us to actually make the right
[1:57:21] decision
[1:57:26] and in in the the the in mark
[1:57:31] 2:6 it says but there were certain of
[1:57:34] the scribes sitting there and reasoning
[1:57:36] in their
[1:57:41] hearts and this is I wanted to show you
[1:57:43] the last one here about
[1:57:47] reasoning logical thinking about
[1:57:49] something in a logical or a sensible way
[1:57:55] many times we take reasoning instead of
[1:57:59] Faith do you know that we are born man
[1:58:02] is born in such a
[1:58:05] way that he wants to reason
[1:58:11] everything you find the scribes what
[1:58:13] kill the scribes and the
[1:58:17] Pharisees and made them not see
[1:58:20] Christ was their reasoning
[1:58:23] every time Christ came to
[1:58:25] them they started
[1:58:29] reasoning
[1:58:31] reasoning but when we receive the Holy
[1:58:34] Spirit he you know God loves wants us to
[1:58:37] be
[1:58:40] foolish you are quiet because you don't
[1:58:42] believe
[1:58:44] that let me read that for you in first
[1:58:46] Corinthians
[1:58:48] 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish
[1:58:50] things of the world
[1:58:54] to confound the
[1:58:57] wise and God has chosen the weak things
[1:58:59] of the
[1:59:01] world confound the things which are
[1:59:03] might the Way Up Is
[1:59:06] Down you know your reasoning will not
[1:59:09] get you
[1:59:12] anywhere does it mean that we should
[1:59:13] never use our
[1:59:15] reasoning we should reason through the
[1:59:18] filter of the
[1:59:21] word
[1:59:23] but where you begin to reason and out
[1:59:24] reason
[1:59:27] God thinking you are
[1:59:31] sensible that's where reasoning
[1:59:35] fails when a man receives a new
[1:59:39] spirit they receive new
[1:59:44] reasoning now these are things that we
[1:59:46] can each of us relate in our personal
[1:59:51] lives and I pray that after we we have
