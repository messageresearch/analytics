of our lord jesus christ christian i see quite many are not either yet here or they are not here this morning but i only know of sister rose who told me that she lost a grand grandmother and she went for barrio against them praise the lord come here we should remember her in prayers also i'm happy to see this young man i brother fred yes are you happy to see him coming he told me that he has a desire of coming to fellowship with us [Music] so this morning as you can see we have been disturbed by power government and we have not been able to run a hundred percent uh being trivial number two you know because the second because this uh can the projector work no okay i i had uh slides today that i wanted to show you already and then this is the day the devil decides to uh take the power and i never use slides when i'm preaching most of the time because i'm usually a preacher today i wanted to teach i wanted to teach on a subject which i've promised you many of you have asked me to deal with it it's a subject that many preachers especially in the message we do not want always to preach about it or to talk about it and uh it's been about a year and a half since this fellowship started and those are truly more congratulations we were still in the house fellowship between the catholics and a brother whom many of you know he came here also being part of the fellowship engaged in a woman of faith so how many uh how how many people were where were suffering in their financial lives [Music] and you see this brother came to me and told me he said you see you've been running this fellowship for about two years now you know so he told me i think you are robbing them of their blessings we need to teach them where to go because if people are well taught on the subject nate satan say i prepared myself then go nintendo and i spoke to the people on tithies and offerings 24 slides and have not never thought about it again but they sit down i'm good to me today is going to be the second time i'm going to do that in my entire life and career as a minister and actually most of you are almost many of you here will tell iran that i'm a giver since uh my life has been a giver from the very beginning not only giving money but giving time second gather centers of canada a good day but even with money he needs him i think most of you here have been beneficiaries banjo-kufai can you do it of money from me consumed many of you would know that whatever you give actually you received it back is that true those of you that attend this fellowship not a hundred percent that i'm not preaching this because i want to now begin collecting money from you but really it is uh my duty as a pastor to teach you women to go ahead and fulfill scripture i want to ask you to bear with us and i believe also this will be a blessing to you brother fred afraid you have attended the fellowship here many times you know i've not talked even about you can be able to if you want the notes and the scriptures again you can be able to okay so all right so uh let us stand on our feet and we are reading checking our bibles genesis chapter 14 genesis is 14 is and we are reading from verse 18. he says and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth and blessed be the most high god which has delivered thine enemies into the in hand and he gave him taithers of all alvarez so praise the name of the lord come and give us the way amen let us pray preachers loving jesus we ask that you bless us and hear us today yes praise the lord now here we see of course we know who melchizedek is too many medicine and melchizedek he calls him a priest of the most high one abraham he was one of the three angels that came in and he was the one that remained with abraham while the two went to sodom and gomorrah so the bible also says on verse 20 and blessed and blessed be the most high god which has delivered thine enemies into the in hand into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all origin today as i just told you that we are really into a teaching already and uh for i i always cannot control myself because i'm a preacher that's my gift to enable myself to control myself so that i can be able to bring all the points that i need you to understand i have notes here on the slideshow to see what is saying and i will try and an offering it comes from a hebrew word called mention [Applause] that is offering h are you following me and that strike that is god has already determined and he has said it is a tenth part of all your possessions that is the type and then offering is a free will oh why am i saying it's a present you don't need to decide for me what to give if i want to gift you something so it's really your prerogative on what to give get it go away as an offering to god and get you everywhere erica praise the name of the lord amen so we see that abraham gave a tenth of allah is really the law of mothers they do not know their bibles that's why you know the bible says that the law which came many many years after it cannot remove that which was before praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah amen so the law was added because of transgression [Music] [Music] we might not necessarily need to follow now but after faith has been restored to us whatever was introduced by faith and because of faith and under faith we actually should still follow you now amen all right so now noticed that the titles were really given before the law everywhere all right so let us first get this out of the way genesis chapter four verse four today is of his flock and of the fact there wrote and the lord had respect unto abel unto his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wrong and his countenance fell or whatever [Music] you know explanations on how the first feud should be given and how this but here we notice that our bell gives he brought off the fostering the first fruits of his flock why do you know why god was happy because of abel's sacrifice over his offerings because it was by revelation you see he had a revelation of giving the arena i've had some people who come to me and say well pastor i have got my first salary and i i pledge to the lord at my first salary i'll give it to the lord oh my god but i'm not going to stand here and tell you people you must bring all your salary to the lord first salary now yeah [Applause] how good you that you could be foolish you are doing it by faith without faith it is impossible to please god so the lord gives us a wonderful example in the lives of cain and abel uh in the area of bringing their offerings unto the lord everywhere even if both of them brought offerings unto the lord [Music] it's not the law it's the faith do you understand what i'm talking about hallelujah amen so notice that jesus well i'm talking about revelation here jesus talks about the giver who brought a a little dime yes center captivity and also there are other rich people who came back and then many church people have taken that exam and said oh yeah we should take coins to the lord into the lord god is able to bless you [Music] who uh you know the man of god elijah meth and you know she you will not also bring some food later i couldn't marry what are you talking about this is the only thing i'm remaining with for me and my son to to eat and die i'm gonna name anyone hallelujah amen but what changed your heart what what came to her teaching check the judge he made her give everything to the world it was a revelation it was the without even knowing that she will ever because you have plenty how are you going to be in chicago flowing already you you give because it is revealed to you you must kill oh wow and watch the blessing that follows what is pleasing to our lord gg the bible tells us to prove what is acceptable unto the lord i want to ask you what is that that is acceptable praise the name of the lord come here romans 12 1 to 2. i'll just go a bit fast but i hope you're following we are called and please those who have not missed i see their uh mother and even those who are here make sure that you send them this link and let them also watch this for them that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that he may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god foreign send you someone you will praise the name of the lord in the same way our number one priority is indicate single questions should be to desire to make god happy [Applause] what is you want to do it oh yeah sent someone to do something good not because the man of god has praised himself some people have the wrong conception of of giving and surviving but together with you cry you know think oh when you keep something big and the man of god pronounces a blessing over you all then you're going to get a beginner in your name man appreciating blessings this year from jesus god your husband that don't never know who has given the promise he has presented when you fulfill his will and never to kill the child do that which is perfect no courage to kill you that which is acceptable to him then he's going to bless our again praise the name of the lord come here what is the promise of god excuse me first second corinthians chapter 1 verse 20. for all the promises of god in him i yeah and in him amen unto the glory of god by us can we say amen to that mean whatever god has promised tonight on the chairs yeah i mean can you shout yeah wow no you didn't shout it just say yeah they kinda went wow amen now whatever his promise is that he should not ensue not a giveaway it doesn't matter what someone else says whatever he promised tonight [Music] [Applause] there is no other word in the bible bible where he says do this and prove me and speak what i if i won't be able to keep my word he says respect your mothers and fathers and he gives a promise for them but he didn't say provence that you live wrong there are many who respect their mothers and fathers and don't live long will you bring your best sister to anger but when it comes to this hey here is my word bring all your [Applause] god is putting with this and i'm so fed up on your improvement and allow me to deal with it especially the believers of the mercenary they are so unfaithful [Music] and if you are not working the bible says you are working and you're not blessed here is your problem of all that come our way now all that come our way from your salary if you have inherited something from [Music] your tithe and then you don't give an offering it is a shame for a believer to go to church without an offering at all no one has ever gone to god without offering anybody again even those who got witchcraft now again don't go they go with an offering to a while they go with the only thing i promised myself i won't preach but you know the word of god is suffering the only thing a change that god has not and i have never demanded as a sacrifice sacrifice and giving has been a part of worship that the prophet said if a service has no offering collected it has not been full oh only natural to be your worship is not complete or causing the consequence so now that the offering is above the twice hey why are you cheating what guru is this is not there is no exception to this creature or no preacher you must keep tight and offended i have practice practiced this since i was 15 years old and in any accommodation of that given my death as an officer everybody are coming everywhere oh that i received an interview you see after the particular need all needs that are pressed presented to you through the your congregation a church or fellowship category the offering you give it to according to the need also sometimes that is presented to you through your church of fellowships just like here we are collecting funds for buying land for the church [Music] foreign praise the name of the lord come ahead now where do you pay your tithe as an offering if you're coming everywhere you give it to even a street preacher organizer you can fellowship and attend everywhere you feel like you have a duty and not do this to your home be meat in the house hallelujah right meat in the house what is the meat and medicine is the food admitted you made it they stored out food in that storehouse you know it needs to be there but it needs to be purchased things don't just happen everything [Applause] [Applause] for my flesh is made indeed and my blood is drinking deed he that eateth my flesh and bringeth my blood what it's in me and i in him so now you can see that the the flesh that the meat really is talking about here is the word so it says bring your diet [Music] hallelujah amen now preachers live of the the scripture says do you not know that they which minister about holy things believe of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar i'll protect us a it is a shame for a minister here to come to you and tell your brother and i say to myself if i'm going to be serving god but abandoning the word is a catholic my wife and i were just so young and we were in ethiopia he's looking at the names we couldn't make ends meet and then god brought uh somebody that told me young number you see pastor come zumba i want to make this my home church and i want to be paying my tithes he didn't even know a few days earlier my wife and i had sat in our bedrooms and looked at our expenses we can't make it following man and what was our question should we ask for more from people hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord come here brother himself in the ministry organic where is the place you know we are talking where he didn't have money but he didn't want to take money then i didn't get a 12 cent he was so poor yeah he removed his heart i went around the church and told them church today i want to take an offering this little [Music] actually many people benefited out of his ministry more than he adapted financially they would make meetings for him [Applause] you know they made enough money to buy a house and they were happy in it and god spoke to brother john you got a new organization this house is not yours and a new mercedes you are moving away from here and i want you to give it to that preacher and john charlie told his wife in [Music] and they gave away all the heart you're not about anybody why they gave away all their health they gave away all their health why for the work of god and they went back to the road and later on this woman comes by nobody else driving an expensive car okay and then she looks at john not about john what do you do you know take care of the flowers pick a pen and paper what a penny not popular and write a cheque of five thousand dollars i want you to give it to john charity alone johnny charity you are taking away the opportunity for them to be blessed of the lord and i thought he knows that i should teach this today 18 21 says and behold i have given the children of life all the time in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation [Music] [Music] [Music] amen nina praise the name of the lord come here look at this in in in corinthians we go back he says even so has the lord ordained that they which preach of the gospel should leave of the gospel what do you want to assume but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so and done unto me if it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glory void but he says for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory oh for necessities laid upon me yeah why is unto me if i preach not the gospel [Music] because we have a personal financial responsibility to our children [Music] area we have a pastor who is there for our spiritual needs food management of our church and he needs to live too much why unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that he uses his neighbor's service without wages and giveth him not for his wife again what do [Music] [Music] so if a preacher comes and preaches for us and that's the reason [Applause] there are several of us here who have different uh professional um you know work that they do can you oh of fact i must say man you should even pay him more than you better egyptians why do i love employing believers because i want to bless them that should be the attitude of every believer never let any brother serve you and you don't pay him the bible says [Music] actually my laptop got an issue laptop younger phone obviously so i sent it over to nairobi to brother isaac ninja reason i wrote the organizer brother isaac is an apple group under eyes and he's worked for apple for more than 15 years kenya community and so the no one in uganda was able to repair uganda so i asked him i said brother what is my bill he said he mentioned the manner without even shame on him yeah you'll get a sentence and i also told him brother can you reduce that because the bill [Music] or not you are not practicing christianity you have a home level at your house and you are not paying i told you this is the one all right uh we lost power here all right now says bring you all the titles into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now here would save a lot of us if i will not open you the windows of heaven and power you are a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it in this is a powerful problem [Music] put it inside let me take it shake it even make it you know press it down pack more no and then turn this over [Music] [Music] together to you again is hallelujah it's not some man it's god second corinthians 9 7. all right you have to bear with my scriptures today because i'm preaching this once maybe forever okay oh [Music] [Music] and the bible says if you can't take care of your family you are even worse than an infinite so you see how important this is [Music] and who are you it is god not man and when you give cheerfully god loves that that's why we sing a song sowing in the morning [Music] we are bringing in [Music] if you ever give something to someone and you are gloomy brother you have wasted your time let me tell you whenever i give the remember and i'm not busting here let's see when you meet is that but i have built homes for several people i was happy i was [Music] and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may have bound to every good work that is [Music] says will a man rob god yet you have robbed me but you say where are you know we robbed the entity on offerings he says [Music] [Music] did you know that if you don't give offerings and you don't pay your titles you are wrong you are a robber someone asked if i don't give my title to the rapture why because you have robbed me and even the whole nation [Music] hallelujah and the rest we read then he says hagai chapter one verse six and actually before we go to our guy there is this portion which i had skipped but very very important verse 10 bring you all the time into the storehouse that they may be meeting my house and prove me now here we'd say the lord of hosts and if i'm not opening you the windows of heaven and power you out of blessing and there shall not be room enough to receive it now we have already read that but i wanted to interpret this now verse 11 and i will rebuke the devourer for your sex and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast half food before the time in the field saith the lord of god [Music] um [Music] and all nations shall call you blessed for you shall be at the light some land say the lord of god he says you have so much and bringing litter your soul [Music] but there is none wrong and he that earneth wages wages to put it in a bag with holes [Music] as [Music] you i would be the most the goodest hypocrite of a pastor in the world so that's your decision i don't know about you but i want to be blessed of god um something the four one says after the lord and the fullness they're wrong the world and the day that dwelleth a guide to eight days they're still there make a lot of peace and use it for the kingdom of god so that when you die your watch will follow you hallelujah when we die our without even enough [Music] did you know that this blessing follows even those who are believers believe us and the bible and you fed me i was naked for as matters you did it for the little one you did it and to me the earth and sin is their first templary possession second corinthians says in whom the god of this world has blighted the minds of them which believe not only [Music] that bless the light of this glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine on them there are some people who love eating that you would always love to go with them on buttons because you will not waste food he has yes he shall not by the way i have a story of that but because of the time i'm not giving it and it shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your hallelujah praise the name of the lord but christians misunderstand time [Music] [Music] when they are budgeting they budget for the 10 percent should i even give like take this man okay let me give god ten percent of my money wrong wrong wrong okay and you're giving ten percent of his money back [Music] and wait you give me yours and then she gives you casino and you give no more and they look at the man now is different from the one they had and they began to cry might be your i'm about to to bring it across but i only am on on slide 15 out of 24 but let's see how i'll cross and i know i understand i've kept you longer than usual but it was necessary listen both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto allah [Music] [Music] and praise thy glorious name [Music] you join me to tell him that we thank you lord and we pray thy glorious name [Music] after this shot [Music] it is an opportunity that we have we're putting up we offer back to god [Music] give me and i bless you it is a big blessing to doing [Music] use your money to serve god use your wisdom to serve god to serve god it is all his name and of his we have given him hyping our honesty to return to god what is rightfully peace it is a test of our obedience to do what he wants to do [Music] is a demonstration that we acknowledge that he is the provider of all material things they [Applause] [Music] believe that he is and he's a rewarder of all that security is [Music] is a test of spirit spiritual maturity that god honors and as a result he blesses us [Music] though titles upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by evening store as god has prospered him that there have been no gatherings when i come in [Music] there let everybody bring what god has blessed him with on sunday that's what he says just directly translate brother let's move on let everybody bring him on sunday period now let me just quote a few things from the prophet and then i will close it is that okay from the message god being misunderstood [Music] does a christian not go to heaven because they did not pray and the prophet answers i would not say yes or no to that but yeah but i do believe that every christian because it is a commandment of the lord [Music] [Music] like some of you maybe from other churches you support your church that's your first duty to god bring your titles and offerings into the storehouse and the storehouse so that's where you get your spiritual food our generation and your obligation is through your church and not to an evangelist like foreign amen so they used to bring mature care or purpose and then they bring it up how much do you give me are you guys [Music] salt and you take a pop of 2 minutes and the church has raised the money those kind of programs he says hallelujah would it be wrong to use titans on church building funds [Music] pastor we are collecting funds and we pay time autistics they kept up their buildings and things like that all the repairs and the buildings was taken care of of that fact that title and give them to a widowed woman that's wrong if you've got anything to give that to with a woman give her a name away but don't give her god his money that's not yours you're in the first place amen and that's what we are told and when i heard that for my first time god has kept all these promises you want to be blessed go for anointing oil somewhere don't go for a witch practice don't think you are cast in the solution [Music] god bless you come along god bless hallelujah let us stand on our feet and uh we shall we shall watch a little bit you're not seeing that and then close the service yes [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] is [Applause] [Music] m [Music] wow [Music] [Applause] [Music]
