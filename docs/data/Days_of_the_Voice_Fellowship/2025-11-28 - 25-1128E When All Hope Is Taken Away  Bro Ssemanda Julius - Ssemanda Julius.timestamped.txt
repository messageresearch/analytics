[44:09] Father, we have not come here for a show
[44:11] or to show ourselves and to present

[44:17] present ourselves before you Lord God
[44:20] Almighty having needs that are
[44:22] different. But we know that there is
[44:24] only one that can help us that's not too
[44:27] busy and that's you, oh God almighty

[44:50] each one of us, oh Lord, forgiving our
[44:52] sins and iniquities, taking all
[44:55] condemnation out of our hearts by the
[44:57] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father,
[44:59] I pray that may you consecrate us for to
[45:02] this hour, Lord. Open my lips in wisdom
[45:05] Lord that I may be able to edify your
[45:07] people by the preaching of the word by
[45:09] the gift and by your holy spirit.
[45:11] Heavenly gracious father I pray that may

[45:42] of him father and that everything goes
[45:44] on well to the praise of the name of the
[45:46] Lord Jesus Christ. Father we commit him
[45:49] into your hands. Heavenly gracious
[45:51] father we pray that tonight may you come
[45:53] and anoint each one of us to break every
[45:56] yoke. Father we pray that let this be a
[45:58] night of a difference. a night, Father,
[46:00] where the power of God falls upon each
[46:03] and every person, Lord, that we may go a
[46:05] step higher and and and closer to the
[46:08] Lord Jesus Christ. Heavenly gracious
[46:11] Father, I'm completely insufficient,
[46:13] Lord. And I I I just feel, Lord, I'm not
[46:16] ready, Lord Jesus, for this hour. But I
[46:19] know that that that God, you are ever
[46:21] ready and ready to to to serve your
[46:24] people and and to do us according to
[46:27] their needs in the mighty name of the
[46:29] Lord Jesus Christ. Father, may you come
[46:31] and break this bread of life that it may
[46:33] bless your people in the name of the
[46:35] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[46:39] Amen.
[46:42] Amen.
[46:44] Let let us first read the scripture then
[46:46] you take your seats and uh we we we we
[46:50] share some few comments.
[46:54] Amen. God richly bless you.
[46:57] Amen. Let us read from the book of Acts
[47:01] chapter
[47:02] 27
[47:04] 13-2.
[47:07] Acts chapter 27 verse 13-2.
[47:15] The Bible says,
[47:17] "And when the south wind blew blew blew
[47:21] softly, supposing that they had obtained
[47:24] their purpose,
[47:26] losing this, they sailed close by.
[47:32] But not long after there arose against
[47:34] it a tempestious wind called Eurocitton.
[47:39] And when the ship was caught and could
[47:42] not bear up into the wind, we let her
[47:46] drive. And running under a certain
[47:49] island, which is called Cloud, we had
[47:52] much work to come by the boat, which
[47:55] when they had taken
[47:58] up, they used hopes and guarding the
[48:01] ship, and fearing lest they should fall
[48:04] into the quick sands, citric sail, and
[48:07] so were driven. And we being exceedingly
[48:10] tossed with our tempest, the next day
[48:13] they lightened the ship. And the third
[48:17] day we cast out with our own hands the
[48:20] tackling of the ship. And when neither
[48:23] sun nor stars in many days appeared, and
[48:26] no small tempest lay on us, all hope
[48:30] that we should be saved was then taken
[48:32] away. But after long abstaininess, Paul
[48:36] stood forth in the midst of them and
[48:38] said, "Sir, ye should have unto me, and
[48:42] not have losed from greet, and to have
[48:44] gained this harm and loss."
[48:48] And now I exalt you to be of good cheer,
[48:51] for there shall be no loss of any man's
[48:53] life among you, but of the sheep. For
[48:55] there stood by me this night the angel
[48:58] of God whose I am and whom I serve,
[49:01] saying, Fear not Paul, thou must be
[49:04] brought before Caesar. And lo, God has
[49:07] given thee all them that s with thee.
[49:11] Wherefore, s be of good cheer, for I
[49:14] believe God that it shall be even as it
[49:18] was told me. Amen. You may take your
[49:22] seats.
[49:24] Amina,
[49:28] we are not going to have a long night.
[49:30] We are going to have a short night after
[49:34] around midnight.
[49:36] So the preaching will not be also long
[49:40] and we shall leave a portion for the uh
[49:44] for some praying session and uh
[49:49] by midnight we shall be done. The reason
[49:52] most of the people here are going for
[49:53] the introduction tomorrow.
[49:56] So we had to make this night shorter
[50:00] short. And that's very fine.
[50:04] That's very fine. And uh
[50:07] this time this moment that we're going
[50:09] to have is uh is good enough to to to do
[50:13] something uh to do something to us
[50:18] tonight. uh because if if the rapture is
[50:22] going to take place in a moment in a
[50:25] twinkling of an eye that is the the
[50:28] translation the the change of these
[50:30] motor bodies taking on immortality if it
[50:34] is going to take place in a moment in a
[50:37] twinkling of an eye and it is that's I
[50:41] think the the greatest miracle so all of
[50:45] these other things we can do in just a
[50:47] few times and they can be accomplished.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; So God can do anything any time. No
[50:52] matter how the time
[50:55] uh no matter how it does not take it is
[50:58] not about how long how short God can do
[51:00] anything any time.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; It's not about how long we pray it's
[51:04] about how deep is our faith. It's not
[51:07] about how long we preach. It's about who
[51:09] is behind us when we are preaching.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; So it's the power that is driving the
[51:14] message. That's what makes the
[51:17] difference.
[51:18] That's what brings the manifestation
[51:21] and the life of the message into the
[51:26] people.
[51:27] Uh yes.
[51:32] Amen.
[51:34] Our subject today is uh when all hope to
[51:40] is taken away. when all hope is taken
[51:44] away.
[51:47] It's it's kind of different when you are
[51:49] preaching without an interpreter,
[51:52] but it is fine. It is very fine. So when
[51:56] all hope is taken away from where we
[51:58] have read here in this scripture just uh
[52:01] for I I like to encourage the believer.
[52:05] I like to encourage the believer because
[52:07] the believer can be encouraged.
[52:11] There is something in him that just gets
[52:14] cast casted down a little bit. But the
[52:17] Bible says where there is a casting down
[52:18] there is a lifting up.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; A believer can be encouraged
[52:24] &gt;&gt; and that encouragement can stand
[52:26] steadfast because he is a believer. He
[52:29] just needs you know
[52:32] when before we came here the prophet
[52:35] taught us that we we bypassed our
[52:37] theophony.
[52:38] So for God to take us back there, he
[52:41] just quickens us. So for me to get you
[52:44] encouraged again, I just quicken you by
[52:46] the word. So but an unbeliever, that one
[52:49] can't be encouraged. He will float about
[52:52] today. He says, "Yes, yes, yes." The
[52:54] next day he floats about he's just
[52:56] unstable.
[52:58] He's just unstable. He's just like
[53:00] tossed about like the wind upon the sea.
[53:03] He has no direction. He has no guide.
[53:06] But what a believer has is the guide.
[53:10] The guide of our lives. That's what
[53:12] keeps us steady fast. That's what keeps
[53:15] us steady. That's what brings us back
[53:18] when we are going off the lane. It's
[53:21] it's the guide that we have because the
[53:24] guide is the one that he knows the
[53:25] track. He knows the the way how we which
[53:28] we which we ought to go which we ought
[53:31] to go. So that's that's what keeps the
[53:33] believer walking in that lane. So in
[53:37] this scripture in the book of acts where
[53:39] we have read 27 it's it's it's uh
[53:44] let's take it like this.
[53:47] This was the time that uh when you go
[53:50] back to verses one it was determined
[53:52] that we should sail into Italy. They
[53:54] delivered Paul and certain other
[53:57] prisoners and to one named Julius. Now
[54:00] there's my name there
[54:03] but I didn't intend but there's my name
[54:05] there. So uh Paul was was to be taken to
[54:10] Italy. They had to he had to to appear
[54:13] before Caesar. Uh uh he had to appear
[54:16] before Caesar. But and when they set off
[54:18] for for this journey the the Bible gives
[54:22] this entire story when they they started
[54:25] to go off Paul told them uh the when
[54:29] they reached a certain island that was a
[54:30] crit Paul told them but I I don't think
[54:33] we should set off because I'm seeing
[54:36] that this journey is not going to be
[54:38] safe for us. The Bible says that when
[54:41] much time was spent and when sailing was
[54:43] now dangerous, it was dangerous for
[54:46] sailing because the fast was now already
[54:48] passed. Paul admonished them and said
[54:51] unto them, s I perceive that this voyage
[54:54] will be with heart and much damage.
[54:58] Not not only of the ladding and ship,
[55:01] but also of our lives. So the man of God
[55:04] warned them and he said that the voyage
[55:08] that we are taking is going to be
[55:10] dangerous. It is going to bring damage
[55:12] to the ship, damage to our cargo and to
[55:15] our lives also. But but the Bible says
[55:18] that the centurion believed the master
[55:21] and the owner of the ship more than
[55:24] those things which were spoken by Paul.
[55:27] So they believed more the controller of
[55:30] the ship, the captain than the man of
[55:32] God.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And and this happens to the people that
[55:36] they tend to believe more what the
[55:37] doctor says than what the man of God has
[55:40] said. I believe the man of God than what
[55:43] your condition says. Believe the man of
[55:46] God than what your situation says. So
[55:49] &gt;&gt; because the man of God is is is God is
[55:52] mouthpiece but the doctor is using his
[55:56] is a knowledge of science. The the the
[55:59] the
[56:01] statics the statistics are showing the
[56:05] because of the conditions in the country
[56:07] the the the statist statistics will show
[56:10] that but the man of God is speaking from
[56:14] what God is seeing. So, but they could
[56:17] not believe what the man of God is
[56:19] saying, but they believed more the
[56:21] captain.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge we get when you you
[56:25] believe more of what the the other
[56:27] people are saying than what the man of
[56:30] God is saying.
[56:32] You know, if you can get someone to
[56:34] believe, God wants a believer, God
[56:36] wants, I mean, someone that can believe
[56:38] someone that he has sent. Babam taught
[56:41] us and he said that
[56:43] God
[56:45] molds the man of the age in such a way
[56:48] that he can attract the people of the
[56:50] age. We know when God molds the man of
[56:54] the area to attract the people of that
[56:56] area.
[56:58] There is a not everywhere you go that
[57:01] you will prosper in everything. There is
[57:03] where God has ordained you.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; You know there's where God has ordained
[57:08] you. And and if you go somewhere and you
[57:10] happen to prosper, it it was an easy
[57:12] plan also. But if you ever go out of
[57:15] that divine program, then you cannot
[57:18] prosper. You you cannot see the
[57:20] prosperity. So it says that Paul
[57:23] admonished them but they could not
[57:25] listen. And what does it say? It says
[57:27] that when the south wind blew softly
[57:30] supposing that they had obtained their
[57:32] purpose.
[57:34] So they saw that ah no we are just
[57:36] sailing on everything is going on right
[57:39] on where we are just going on. He says
[57:42] that everything was going on softly and
[57:45] the brother says that in the man running
[57:47] from the presence of God. He says that
[57:49] when you see that you are just floating
[57:51] down with the tide just going down
[57:54] floating or he says be careful you are
[57:56] just about to fall down the cataract you
[57:59] are about to get into danger when you
[58:02] are seeing that you are floating just
[58:03] about things are easy. So he says that
[58:07] they thought that they had obtained
[58:09] their purpose. So you reach a time that
[58:11] you think you have obtained a purpose
[58:14] but when it's out of the will of God you
[58:17] are not going to get there.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; So sometimes
[58:22] it will it will look like it will it it
[58:25] will be easy. It will be all right.
[58:28] Everything will be going on just well.
[58:32] But he says losing this they said cross
[58:34] by creed. But not long after there was
[58:37] it a tempestious wind called Euroon that
[58:41] what? So that that victory could not go
[58:45] on for too long. So why some people
[58:49] can't contain their victory. You see
[58:52] it's it's a it's not a true victory.
[58:55] It's not a true victory. So when the
[58:57] ship was caught and could not bear up in
[59:00] the wind, we let her drive running on a
[59:03] certain island and all these things.
[59:05] What happened is that they started to
[59:08] offload the ship. Offload the ship.
[59:10] Remove this, remove that. They removed
[59:12] threw away the cargo. They threw away
[59:14] the ropes that are carrying the cargo
[59:16] and and everything. And the Bible says
[59:19] that and being exceedingly tossed with a
[59:22] tempest. They they were just tossed
[59:25] about. So where and everything was
[59:28] happening and where every little hope
[59:32] that they had was being taken away from
[59:35] them was being wiped away. The Bible
[59:38] says when neither sun nor stars in many
[59:41] days appeared no smaller tempest on us
[59:44] all hope that we should be saved was
[59:47] then taken away.
[59:49] They could not see the sun at all. They
[59:52] could not see the stars at all. the it
[59:55] was all dark around them. It was night
[59:58] at that time. They didn't know that they
[1:00:00] could not see what what what time is it?
[1:00:02] You know, it was they say says all of
[1:00:05] hope the little hope that had remained
[1:00:07] in them was taken away. So it was a
[1:00:12] something that happened that took away
[1:00:14] the hope. It says all hope that we
[1:00:17] should be saved was taken away. It was
[1:00:20] something that happened. It was a
[1:00:23] situation that took away the hope.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Now the one writing is Luke. Luke Luke
[1:00:30] is the one writing this book.
[1:00:33] He was there. He says all hope we should
[1:00:35] be saved was taken away.
[1:00:38] You you get to a point where even you
[1:00:41] know but
[1:00:43] there's nothing can take away Christ the
[1:00:45] hope of glory. There's nothing that can
[1:00:47] take away that hope out of you.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It cannot be there. So it says that they
[1:00:53] lost all that hope and what happened is
[1:00:56] that uh Paul said I warned you of this
[1:01:00] had I known always comes last I warned
[1:01:03] you I told you about this but because of
[1:01:07] God's grace and kindness he says that
[1:01:11] don't be worried be of good cheer I
[1:01:14] believe God
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; and I'm a servant of God and God did
[1:01:20] this because of Paul
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; because Paul was in that ship. So it
[1:01:25] says the the the night the angel of God
[1:01:28] whose I am and whom I serve he sent his
[1:01:32] angel to strengthen his servant that was
[1:01:36] with the unbelievers in the boat that he
[1:01:40] may deliver him from that that which was
[1:01:42] happening. So,
[1:01:45] so it says that
[1:01:49] uh it says that uh fear not thou must be
[1:01:53] brought before Caesar and law God has
[1:01:55] given all of them that sell with thee.
[1:01:58] So no matter what happens, no matter
[1:02:00] what comes our way, it all turns out it
[1:02:03] works for our own good that they lost
[1:02:07] their ship but he he won the souls that
[1:02:10] were in the boat. So it it doesn't
[1:02:13] matter what the devil brings upon you,
[1:02:15] but God turns it around for our own
[1:02:17] good. Because Paul is commission was to
[1:02:20] to preach the gospel to the Gentiles,
[1:02:23] get them from darkness and to light. His
[1:02:26] purpose was to deliver souls. So all
[1:02:30] this what happened to the sheep, what
[1:02:32] happens to whatever whatever it doesn't
[1:02:34] matter as long as we get that soul.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; So when he got the souls, that was good
[1:02:40] enough for me. Now when God gets a man,
[1:02:43] a God called man that God has given a
[1:02:47] vision, God will always drive you
[1:02:50] sometimes contrary to what you are
[1:02:52] thinking.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; It will drive you to what you thought.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; It will take you the way that you you
[1:02:59] even don't understand because God wants
[1:03:02] that a vision that he has given you
[1:03:04] depend upon him.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; He says that God wants man to fully
[1:03:09] depend upon him.
[1:03:11] Sometimes we think that I can handle
[1:03:13] this. It's it's not a it's not huge.
[1:03:18] But God doesn't want that. God wants man
[1:03:21] to completely depend upon him.
[1:03:24] Bab says that when Adam sinned against
[1:03:28] God,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; he he tried to when he tried to put
[1:03:33] around those leaves around him and his
[1:03:36] wife Eve. He says that what he that's
[1:03:40] not what he was supposed to do. He was
[1:03:42] supposed to go back to God and ask him,
[1:03:45] "Father,
[1:03:47] I I've done what you told me not to do,
[1:03:50] and now I'm here lost.
[1:03:53] Show me the way back.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; As simple as that.
[1:03:58] God is a God of simplicity. But you
[1:04:01] complicate yourself.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; It's you that complicates yourself. You
[1:04:06] make it too hard when it is not too hard
[1:04:09] for God. You make it too complicated and
[1:04:12] hard to understand and hard to go
[1:04:15] through. But when it is not hard and not
[1:04:18] complicated, it is easy when it is in
[1:04:21] God's hand.
[1:04:23] There's nothing can take away that hope
[1:04:26] when it is anchored in Christ
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; because that's the hope of glory and it
[1:04:31] goes from glory to glory from faith to
[1:04:33] faith. It just keeps on growing and
[1:04:35] growing. So sometimes God takes you
[1:04:39] through that the floods and and sorrows
[1:04:41] and the fires. But God is still leading.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; God is still leading.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; He has not lost control. He has not lost
[1:04:51] leadership. He has not given you up.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; So when all hope is taken away
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; and you say I just have no more hope. We
[1:05:00] just just let's let's just leave this
[1:05:03] thing. Let's just leave this thing.
[1:05:06] Just remember as long as you can still
[1:05:09] help yourself, you don't need God's
[1:05:11] help. But God helps the helpless. You
[1:05:14] know the people tend to say that
[1:05:22] God helps the helpless and God helps you
[1:05:26] without your help. God doesn't need your
[1:05:30] help to help you.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Let me give you an example.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Look a little caterpillar.
[1:05:38] If if it is over right here and it is
[1:05:41] surrounded by fire all around.
[1:05:45] Now you tell me how is that? How should
[1:05:48] that caterpillar help itself to get out
[1:05:51] of that s of fire? It doesn't have
[1:05:54] wings.
[1:05:58] The heat is getting too much.
[1:06:01] Tell me, how can it help itself to get
[1:06:03] out of that circle?
[1:06:06] So God doesn't need any man's help to
[1:06:09] help a man. All that God wants is a man
[1:06:13] that can surrender to him
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; and believe him and just put all their
[1:06:19] trust in God. Just all their trust in
[1:06:22] God. So it there there are those moments
[1:06:26] in life where your confession is
[1:06:29] completely changed.
[1:06:34] You start by saying you know God is
[1:06:36] going to do it. You know God is my God
[1:06:38] is a mighty God. My God is a living God.
[1:06:41] I believe God. But then something
[1:06:44] happens.
[1:06:46] It really strikes you and until all hope
[1:06:51] is taken away and you're like, I think
[1:06:54] this thing is not meant for me. I think
[1:06:55] I was doing a mistake. I am not certain
[1:06:58] even whether it's God's will. Let me
[1:07:01] just leave this thing. Ah God, I'm
[1:07:03] sorry. Maybe I was venturing without
[1:07:06] authority. No, you are just at the point
[1:07:10] of giving up. But when you are almost
[1:07:12] giving up,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I always want you to remember our God
[1:07:17] won't give up on your case.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; God never gives up. You know, there's
[1:07:24] you can't bring a case and God says,
[1:07:26] "I've tried to handle Julia's things,
[1:07:28] but I've given up on this case. I've
[1:07:32] given up." But says that when
[1:07:37] the the it says that when when when when
[1:07:40] when the blood is applied, he says that
[1:07:44] you know let me give you something the
[1:07:46] accuser of the brethren is the devil. So
[1:07:49] when the devil brings the accusation and
[1:07:53] that accusation is and it is true you
[1:07:56] know you you did it why why God calls it
[1:07:59] an accusation because God is not seeing
[1:08:02] it. It because of the blood he says the
[1:08:06] case is closed the blood is a bumper
[1:08:09] then the sin goes back to its owner.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You know God turns
[1:08:14] Satan cannot be sent to hell if he's not
[1:08:16] a sinner. So God he says brother says
[1:08:20] the blood is a bumper. So the sin goes
[1:08:23] back to its original owner that's the
[1:08:25] devil. So he bears every sin upon
[1:08:29] himself. Then he has got to go to hell.
[1:08:32] God is a righteous judge.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; So look brother he cannot say that this
[1:08:38] case this one have given up.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; God can't give up on your case until it
[1:08:42] is done
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; until it is sorted. No matter how long
[1:08:46] it takes, God is working on your case.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Our God does not surrender. Our God does
[1:08:55] not retreat.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Our God doesn't give up.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; If God determines to do something,
[1:09:03] Paul says,
[1:09:05] "He that started a good work in you will
[1:09:09] accomplish it till the door of Christ."
[1:09:12] God has to finish what he has started.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; God has to finish what he has started.
[1:09:18] You go Moses says, Moses says
[1:09:21] if the Egyptians shall hear that their
[1:09:25] God brought them out of Egypt and he was
[1:09:29] not able to take them into the promised
[1:09:31] land that he says if you destroy these
[1:09:33] people because they have sinned, you
[1:09:36] know you are just God. But if you
[1:09:40] destroy these people because they have
[1:09:42] sinned, let me tell you, your sins,
[1:09:46] your sins cannot even separate you from
[1:09:49] God if you are a son of God.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to bring you close that to
[1:09:55] understand the power of the blood
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and that you may be able to extend grace
[1:10:02] to others.
[1:10:04] If you had no mistake, my brother, you
[1:10:07] would be uh a radical believer.
[1:10:13] But those things happen that you may
[1:10:16] have grace to others
[1:10:18] because grace and truth came through
[1:10:21] Christ Jesus. But Christ is now in you
[1:10:23] that you may extend the same grace.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Look brother, sister, he says, then
[1:10:29] Moses says, you know, they have sinned.
[1:10:31] Yes. But if you destroy them just right
[1:10:34] now, what is going to happen is that the
[1:10:37] Egyptians will say they are God because
[1:10:41] he was not able to take them into the
[1:10:43] land he promised them. He destroyed them
[1:10:46] in the wilderness. And that will be a
[1:10:48] bad report about you. God doesn't want a
[1:10:52] bad report about him.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And God doesn't want to be ashamed.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want to be ashamed. You know
[1:11:01] if you are certain of God, you just say
[1:11:04] God. Let me tell you, if you are certain
[1:11:06] of God,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; you know it's not you who's going to be
[1:11:10] ashamed.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; If I make my confession and I make my
[1:11:14] stand for Christ, if he doesn't stand
[1:11:17] for me, it's not me who's going to be
[1:11:19] ashamed.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; I just tell him, Lord, if you let me
[1:11:22] just sleep off, you are going to be
[1:11:24] ashamed because I have stood and confess
[1:11:26] that I'm a Christian. Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; It is a God who is ashamed
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; if your confession does not come into
[1:11:34] manifestation because you have trusted
[1:11:37] in him. Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; He says the Egyptians are going to mock
[1:11:43] on you and you know
[1:11:48] and God says ah you Moses you are right
[1:11:51] that that one you are right these people
[1:11:54] but okay he forgive them because of the
[1:11:58] testimony of his name he had to let it
[1:12:02] had to stand on and on through the ages.
[1:12:06] Yes, he destroyed them. By the time he
[1:12:07] destroyed them, he already had those
[1:12:09] that will enter. So those who had they
[1:12:12] say Israel conquered all their enemies
[1:12:15] and they entered into that the land and
[1:12:17] they took over. Brother, sister, God
[1:12:21] cannot start it and just just leave it
[1:12:24] around there in the middle. When he
[1:12:26] starts it, he gets it to the end. So
[1:12:28] when all your hope is taken away,
[1:12:32] there's something within you that can't
[1:12:35] be taken away.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; There's something within you that can't
[1:12:38] be taken away.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother. God, he loves it so
[1:12:44] much
[1:12:45] when you are brought against the wall.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; When your back is against the wall,
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; it works for God.
[1:12:56] It it works for him
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; because he works in mysterious ways is
[1:13:01] wonders to perform. If if if you if
[1:13:05] you're back
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; the children of Israel
[1:13:13] when they reached the Red Sea,
[1:13:18] there was the Red Sea standing in the
[1:13:20] way.
[1:13:22] That Red Sea was not going to be taken
[1:13:24] away. It was right in the way. But there
[1:13:28] was another way. The prophet says God
[1:13:31] brought them into I'm forgetting the
[1:13:34] word but you know God bringing you into
[1:13:37] a trap.
[1:13:41] He says you are passing here but there
[1:13:43] is already sea. There is already sea and
[1:13:46] behind them pharaoh is coming with the
[1:13:49] chariots. Then all hope was taken away.
[1:13:53] He said Moses you brought us to destroy
[1:13:55] us in the wilderness.
[1:14:02] between a rock and a hard place. In
[1:14:05] other words, you can't go back, you
[1:14:07] can't go forward, you can't retreat and
[1:14:10] you can't move forward. There's
[1:14:12] something in the way and behind you.
[1:14:18] You can't return back to that job, but
[1:14:21] there's no other one. You can't return
[1:14:23] back home. you but there's a lot of
[1:14:26] things happen you know
[1:14:30] but God says ah be still and see the
[1:14:33] salvation of the Lord
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; he brought them right in that trap
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; where they could all of their hope was
[1:14:40] taken away
[1:14:42] but God just wanted to show his power
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; God just wanted to show his power
[1:14:48] remember brother sister any time that
[1:14:50] you ask God for a miracle
[1:14:53] when You ask to see God's power,
[1:14:57] you are asking for a certain problem
[1:15:01] because God is power cannot be made
[1:15:05] manifest without a challenge. There has
[1:15:08] got to be a challenge then there is a
[1:15:10] showdown.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; So when you say God I want to see your
[1:15:13] miracles. I want to see your power. You
[1:15:15] are asking for a challenge. Then when
[1:15:18] the challenge comes
[1:15:20] God wants to show his power.
[1:15:23] When you ask God for brotherly love,
[1:15:26] brother, he brings brothers that
[1:15:30] they are not lovely at all.
[1:15:34] They will mock you, they will step on
[1:15:36] your feet. They will I
[1:15:40] because brotherly love it comes with a
[1:15:42] challenge. it. You have to fight it.
[1:15:47] It's within you. But for it to come out,
[1:15:51] there has got to be a squeeze.
[1:15:54] If you want to get juices, squeeze that
[1:15:56] grip. So there's got to be a squeeze for
[1:16:00] that one to be manifested.
[1:16:03] It says the squeeze brings the power of
[1:16:06] God.
[1:16:10] When all hope is taken away,
[1:16:14] When all hope is taken away,
[1:16:16] you are when you are pressed between a
[1:16:19] rock and a hard place, you are you are
[1:16:22] just put within challenge upon
[1:16:25] challenge, trouble upon trouble, try
[1:16:28] upon trial, test upon test, failure upon
[1:16:31] failure, mistake upon mistake, and you
[1:16:34] feel like I cannot be a Christian.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; You are a genuine Christian. Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; When you come to a point where I feel
[1:16:43] like I I think this is this one I think
[1:16:47] God have ashamed you too much. I think I
[1:16:50] really cannot
[1:16:52] live for Christ. You are the right
[1:16:55] person.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Because now
[1:17:00] hallelujah.
[1:17:01] My grace
[1:17:04] is sufficient. And then say is power is
[1:17:08] great in weakness.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; When you are weak then you are strong.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's where strength is in weakness in
[1:17:17] brokenness. That's where a masterpiece
[1:17:20] is molded.
[1:17:22] Because God cannot take a vessel to use
[1:17:25] it unless he breaks it and molds it
[1:17:27] again after his own will. You come to
[1:17:31] Christ when you are molded in your own
[1:17:33] understanding, molded in your own
[1:17:35] desires,
[1:17:37] molded with your own visions.
[1:17:41] I had my own visions a lot. A lot. Far
[1:17:44] from this. None of these things I had. I
[1:17:46] didn't have any of these things.
[1:17:49] I was really had my own visions, man.
[1:17:54] But God had to break all those things
[1:17:57] until I all hope was taken away. I
[1:18:00] couldn't achieve any of them. I lost all
[1:18:03] the hope and it was taken out
[1:18:05] completely. Why? Because God wanted to
[1:18:08] bless me in that reality.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; In the truth of the matter of life, the
[1:18:13] reason as to why I'm here
[1:18:17] when you can't get under it.
[1:18:20] There's no way to get under it. There's
[1:18:23] no way to get over it. You You don't see
[1:18:26] any way to get over it. When you don't
[1:18:29] see any way to get around it,
[1:18:34] you can't jump this. You can't dodge it.
[1:18:37] It is your responsibility. It's you.
[1:18:40] It's just around you. You can't get
[1:18:42] under it. You can't get over it. You
[1:18:45] can't get around it.
[1:18:50] The only way is you either go through it
[1:18:54] or you let God take it out of the way.
[1:18:58] But trust me brother, sister, you are
[1:19:01] going to go through it.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; You are going to go through it and you
[1:19:05] are going to come out with the victory.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; God loves it when he brings you to a
[1:19:10] point where all your hopes is taken
[1:19:12] away. Where all your confidence in man
[1:19:15] is taken away because God wants a full
[1:19:18] trust in him. The prophet says in the
[1:19:21] message the mighty conqueror trusting in
[1:19:23] his word. God wants someone who can
[1:19:27] completely trust in his word. Your
[1:19:30] father can give you a word. You know
[1:19:32] your parents give you a word and say I
[1:19:34] am sorted.
[1:19:36] Now that's your parents's word.
[1:19:39] God doesn't want that. He will bring you
[1:19:42] where the the hope in that word is taken
[1:19:45] away.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Where I give you my word and say these
[1:19:49] brethren are going to make it for me.
[1:19:51] God doesn't want that.
[1:19:55] God doesn't want what that he says
[1:19:57] trusting in his word.
[1:20:00] Believing everything he says, trusting
[1:20:04] him as my all,
[1:20:07] as my breath, as my life, as all that I
[1:20:13] have.
[1:20:17] You know, it's not that God wants you to
[1:20:20] be poor. It's not that God doesn't want
[1:20:22] you to possess things. It's not that God
[1:20:24] wants you to have nothing. But God wants
[1:20:27] you to have him first.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Some people cannot think about getting
[1:20:35] God until they are emptied. But how can
[1:20:38] you you you have to be emptied then
[1:20:40] filled. So some people God God not but
[1:20:45] all but all. God empt.
[1:20:50] You can't come to a point where you say
[1:20:52] God is my all that I have
[1:20:56] where God says but I am your portion
[1:21:02] say but God can't you trust me with some
[1:21:04] riches or Roberts and all these others
[1:21:07] have got riches and God says but I am
[1:21:11] your portion and brother that satisfied
[1:21:15] him but but some people that doesn't
[1:21:18] satisfy
[1:21:20] because of the ignorancy that if I have
[1:21:23] God, then I have everything.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Seek you first the kingdom of God and
[1:21:29] his righteousness.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Then these are things shall be added
[1:21:34] unto you.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; It says, trusting him as my all, as my
[1:21:40] breath, as my life, as all that I have.
[1:21:44] All I have is Jesus. I don't have any
[1:21:47] other. He says, "Tonight
[1:21:50] I fully surrender myself to him. Both
[1:21:53] soul, body, and spirit.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Tonight I fully surrender myself to him.
[1:22:00] Both soul, body, and spirit. Looking for
[1:22:04] his second coming in glory.
[1:22:08] When I am sad, I trust him."
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Christ is my joy. When I am glad, I
[1:22:17] trust him. He is my gladness. When I am
[1:22:21] sick, I trust him. He is my healer. When
[1:22:24] I am lost, I trust him. He is my savior.
[1:22:28] Whatever befalls me, I trust him.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Come what may, that the east winds blow.
[1:22:37] Come, whatever befalls me, I trust him.
[1:22:43] Job says that he says he says he says he
[1:22:46] says I though he slays me
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; yet will I trust him.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; My mom says that even if he sends me I
[1:22:58] know that he's going to send me to hell
[1:22:59] let me tell you even if I know that
[1:23:01] Christ is going to send me to hell at
[1:23:03] the end of the road it is still good to
[1:23:07] talk about Jesus. I still feel good to
[1:23:10] serve him. I still feel good to praise.
[1:23:13] I feel good when I'm a Christian.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Even if I know I still wouldn't go for
[1:23:19] the things of the world.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; I would still live for Christ. I would
[1:23:25] still talk about him as a savior.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; At least let someone else go there. If I
[1:23:30] know that I want to go there, let
[1:23:32] someone else go there because I believe
[1:23:35] that his word is true.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. When all hope is taken away, I
[1:23:41] have a certain hope that can't be taken
[1:23:43] away from me. Whatever befalls me, I
[1:23:47] trust him.
[1:23:49] I trust him. Whatever befalls me
[1:23:52] because he says there's nothing that can
[1:23:55] happen to a believer unless it has been
[1:23:57] ordained of God. Because a believer's
[1:24:00] life, whatever befalls him is ordained
[1:24:03] of God. And God never puts a trial
[1:24:06] or a test on you. Unless he has a
[1:24:10] confidence in you.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; You know babies in Christ have little
[1:24:16] trials.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; He first gets you out of Egypt then he
[1:24:23] bring you in the wilderness a place of
[1:24:25] trial.
[1:24:27] If you overcome that then you're a son
[1:24:29] indeed. Now when God brings a test a
[1:24:32] trial you know he has confidence in you.
[1:24:37] I have confidence. This one, this one,
[1:24:39] this job, that one. Job. Ah, there's no
[1:24:43] man like him.
[1:24:46] It It looked like as if Job was
[1:24:48] finished. It looked like all hopes was
[1:24:51] taken away because this one brings an
[1:24:54] evil report. Another one brings another
[1:24:56] evil report. Another one brings your
[1:24:58] sons are dead. The cles is stolen. Fires
[1:25:02] burnt the house. Then he boils strike
[1:25:06] job. All hope was taken away. Everything
[1:25:09] Job possess was taken away. But there's
[1:25:12] something the devil would not take out
[1:25:14] from Job. That is the faith job had in
[1:25:18] God. And the trust that Job had in God.
[1:25:22] He says though he me will I trust him.
[1:25:30] What kind of trust is that?
[1:25:33] Because Job had known the secret.
[1:25:36] Whatever befalls me, I trust him.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; When he says, I know my redeemer liveth,
[1:25:42] it means that the God I serve is not a
[1:25:46] dead God.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; He is a living God.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; God wants to reveal himself as the only
[1:25:54] true living God.
[1:25:57] God loves to reveal that. He wants to
[1:26:00] prove that he is the only true living
[1:26:03] God. That one he he loves to do it. The
[1:26:07] you know the three Hebrew children were
[1:26:10] brought
[1:26:12] God didn't did not move.
[1:26:15] You know he's not in a
[1:26:19] he's just
[1:26:21] he's not moved by circumstancy.
[1:26:24] God is not moved by circumstancy.
[1:26:27] He he just stood there watching looking
[1:26:30] at them and then
[1:26:34] they make their confession. Have you
[1:26:37] prayed? They say we prayed. Then they
[1:26:40] come and uh they reach the mouth the
[1:26:44] mouth of the of the furnace.
[1:26:47] Still God is not moving
[1:26:51] but is watching his eyes on the sparrow.
[1:26:56] They move another step into the fire.
[1:26:59] God is not moving.
[1:27:04] You know,
[1:27:06] God did not come and stand on the door
[1:27:08] of the furnace that they may not enter,
[1:27:11] but God went into the furnace
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; and they found him there.
[1:27:19] You know God goes into your problem
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; and he waits you to come into that
[1:27:25] problem.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; You enter said the waters are swallowing
[1:27:29] me. He says ah just come out of the
[1:27:31] waters.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He just entered the problem and he was
[1:27:36] there in the trouble.
[1:27:39] He says through the waters I'll be with
[1:27:41] you. You know God but why do you let me
[1:27:43] go into the waters? He says, "I just
[1:27:46] enter the waters, I'll be with you."
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; As long as I'm with Jesus,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; no matter what I'm going I'm going
[1:27:54] through.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever comes upon me and I feel so
[1:27:58] squeezed, I always say, "God, are you
[1:28:00] with me?" That's all I want to know.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Because I want to know,
[1:28:08] is it me? I brought this upon myself.
[1:28:11] Oh, you are with me.
[1:28:14] Now
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; touching Jesus is all that matters.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; I just feel it's now sorted.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; As long as says we are together in this
[1:28:25] jurious I say that's good enough for me.
[1:28:29] He entered into the fire when their hope
[1:28:32] was taken away. They said that
[1:28:36] our God will deliver us but they had a
[1:28:39] 50/50.
[1:28:41] But even if if now that was a point of
[1:28:45] doubt even if he doesn't deliver us
[1:28:49] there was a possibility
[1:28:51] it means they didn't have complete faith
[1:28:55] that they are going to be delivered from
[1:28:57] the furnace
[1:28:59] but they said God can deliver us but
[1:29:02] even if in other words we know he can
[1:29:04] deliver but we know he can still leave
[1:29:06] us in the furnace.
[1:29:12] There was a 50/50
[1:29:18] when all hope was taken away.
[1:29:22] God was in the fire.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; I say the fire could not burn them. The
[1:29:29] troubles cannot consume you if you are
[1:29:32] with Jesus. Is it you are bound to go
[1:29:36] through it but it's not going to consume
[1:29:38] you. It's not going to consume you. He's
[1:29:41] just right there with you. The prodigal
[1:29:44] son as when he came back to his father
[1:29:49] just look into yourself. He said
[1:29:53] I'm not worthy to be one of your sons.
[1:29:56] Make me one of your servants, the hired
[1:29:58] servants,
[1:30:00] because I just want to eat food.
[1:30:04] He as long as I can get a job that can
[1:30:06] give me food. Uh-uh.
[1:30:08] Not that.
[1:30:10] He says just if I can get food just make
[1:30:13] one of your hard servants. All hope that
[1:30:16] he can be a son was taken away because
[1:30:18] of his own sins.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Your sins drag you of the faith. All the
[1:30:24] faith they take it away. So he says,
[1:30:26] "I'm no longer fit to be your son. I'm
[1:30:28] just make me a hardy servant.
[1:30:32] Have no hope to be a son anymore."
[1:30:34] But the father says ah just bring the
[1:30:38] nice robe put around him bring the ring
[1:30:40] put around him because this one has
[1:30:41] always been a son.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; So it's God does not change his mind on
[1:30:47] the believer.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; A believer is not a believer because he
[1:30:50] wants to be a believer but he's a
[1:30:51] believer because God ordained him to be
[1:30:53] a believer.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That one is just good enough. I'm not a
[1:31:00] Christian because I want to be a
[1:31:01] Christian. Uh-uh. I'm a Christian
[1:31:04] because God wants me to be a Christian.
[1:31:09] It's what God wants, not what I want. It
[1:31:12] was against my will.
[1:31:17] Amen.
[1:31:21] Lazarus, your friend is sick.
[1:31:27] Lord, come and heal him.
[1:31:31] But Jesus did not go.
[1:31:37] Jesus did not move. He just continue
[1:31:40] with his own things.
[1:31:58] Your testimony, our testimonies don't
[1:32:01] have to come the same. God is a God of
[1:32:04] miracles. But you read the Bible, each
[1:32:06] miracle had a different formula.
[1:32:10] Hallelujah.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So don't look and say as it was with
[1:32:14] Julia, so shall it be with me. You will
[1:32:17] get but not the same procedure.
[1:32:21] He is a god of different is a god of
[1:32:25] variety.
[1:32:26] It cannot become say ah you know God
[1:32:29] wants to make your testimony special
[1:32:33] say which color of eyes do you want blue
[1:32:36] eyes but others but m got eyes also
[1:32:40] others were born blind but he does not
[1:32:42] say you want which color of eyes he
[1:32:44] wants to specialize your testimony
[1:32:47] your testimony has to be special
[1:32:51] packed
[1:32:52] when you are giving gifts you you packed
[1:32:54] a
[1:32:56] You say
[1:33:05] this this one does you you cannot make
[1:33:07] for me. He said oh my good husband the
[1:33:10] the cake was blue for the graduation
[1:33:12] again you bring the cake for my birthday
[1:33:14] another birthday blue cake. is sister.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; It cannot be he has the way he makes the
[1:33:23] testimony look beautiful.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; He beautifies the testimony. So the the
[1:33:30] the miracles that God does for us come
[1:33:33] in different ways. All you have to do is
[1:33:36] to believe for a miracle
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; but don't figure out how the miracle is
[1:33:40] going to happen. That's right.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know God can do anything for you
[1:33:50] as long as you need it?
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; My bike. My bike. The front tire.
[1:34:00] I I I could pump in the pressure. The
[1:34:02] next day it goes out. I said, "God, I
[1:34:04] don't have money to fix this now in my
[1:34:07] heart,
[1:34:09] but fix it for me in my heart." Next
[1:34:13] time I bumped in, it was fixed. I didn't
[1:34:15] fix any. What am I saying? I needed the
[1:34:18] bike.
[1:34:20] Says, this sister says, "This this
[1:34:23] garment is too short. It doesn't fit.
[1:34:27] God increased it." What am I saying? If
[1:34:31] if if you need it, it supplies all your
[1:34:35] needs,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; not your wants.
[1:34:40] The problem you concentrate on your
[1:34:42] wants, not the needs.
[1:34:45] And God concentrates on the needs.
[1:34:47] That's why your mind is different from
[1:34:49] what he is minding about you. But if you
[1:34:52] look at the need, you will be
[1:34:54] testifying.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; You would be testifying. But you ask a
[1:34:58] miss to spend it upon your lust. Then he
[1:35:02] says that's why you don't receive. It
[1:35:04] means you are asking your wants.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Ask your needs.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Look brother, he didn't go there.
[1:35:14] Lazarus
[1:35:18] died.
[1:35:20] Now I can go there.
[1:35:25] brother,
[1:35:32] he can just leave anything happen. One
[1:35:36] thing I learned about God, he does to me
[1:35:38] whatever he wants to do.
[1:35:51] How do they call it?
[1:35:53] What they make out of clay?
[1:35:58] The vessel cannot say to the potter, why
[1:36:00] why do you make me like this? Why do you
[1:36:02] make me like this? Ah, come on. Come on.
[1:36:04] You are a vessel. God does with you
[1:36:07] whatever he wants to do.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; And it is not questionable.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I show mercy to whom I will show mercy.
[1:36:19] Why? Come on, God.
[1:36:21] These people all need mercy. He says I I
[1:36:25] show mercy to whom I will show mercy.
[1:36:29] Period. No question. But all need mercy.
[1:36:33] All need mercy. All have a need. But he
[1:36:36] says I give to whom I want to give.
[1:36:41] God is God
[1:36:43] and he remains a God.
[1:36:47] When he makes a decision
[1:36:51] He doesn't question.
[1:36:54] He doesn't ask what should I do with
[1:36:56] this. He is a sovereign decision maker.
[1:37:06] Four days Lazarus has died. Then Jesus
[1:37:10] comes.
[1:37:12] Why?
[1:37:14] Why did Jesus just speak the word? say,
[1:37:17] "Oh, Lazalas is sick. Lazarus be
[1:37:20] healed." He was going to be healed.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Why did he let him die?
[1:37:28] Then he comes after 4 days when all hope
[1:37:31] is taken away.
[1:37:34] Lord, he stinkketh. He can let your
[1:37:37] condition to stink.
[1:37:44] It becomes worse from bad to worse, from
[1:37:47] worse to worse.
[1:37:50] And God is watching,
[1:37:52] watching.
[1:37:54] And people are crying and people are
[1:37:57] mourning, lamenting,
[1:38:00] and God is watching.
[1:38:03] Do you know why? God knows what he's
[1:38:04] going to do, but the people don't know.
[1:38:10] That is cry.
[1:38:17] But when he came for days, he said,
[1:38:19] "Lord, he's thinking." There's no more
[1:38:22] testimony can come out of this. We can't
[1:38:26] no more testify because we were going to
[1:38:28] testify he was healed. But God was
[1:38:31] magnifying that testimony.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; That's why he says, Yet not
[1:38:43] yes David said I saw the wicked prosper
[1:38:46] and it grieved me
[1:38:49] but God showed him the end of the wicked
[1:38:51] and said I didn't know this is the end
[1:38:53] of the wicked
[1:38:55] coet not
[1:38:57] your yours is coming in a different way
[1:39:02] others he was healing but Lazarus he
[1:39:05] wanted to raise
[1:39:08] What difference does it make?
[1:39:11] It is all healing. But this one I want
[1:39:14] to raise him from the dead.
[1:39:19] When all hope is taken away, it is his
[1:39:22] time to show his wonders, his marvelous
[1:39:26] works. Remember, he does as he pleases.
[1:39:31] Abraham against hope. He believed on
[1:39:34] hope. God let him have no child over and
[1:39:38] over until all hope was taken away.
[1:39:40] Dead.
[1:39:41] The womb of Sarah is dead. Abraham is
[1:39:45] all gone. And now God says that now it's
[1:39:48] time to have this child.
[1:39:51] It's time to have the child. What was
[1:39:53] God doing all through
[1:39:57] his wonders to perform?
[1:40:01] his wonders to perform.
[1:40:05] So when it is as I'm getting finished
[1:40:09] here, when it is you can't get under it,
[1:40:11] over it, whatever it might be, you are
[1:40:13] going to go through it and come out with
[1:40:16] victory.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; When there is no hope for anything, when
[1:40:20] there is it seems like it can't come
[1:40:22] back to life, when it looks like nothing
[1:40:25] can be done anymore, something can be
[1:40:29] done. And God can do something.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; God can bring life to a dead thing. God
[1:40:35] can build a testimony from zero.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Because by his word, things that are
[1:40:42] were made from things that do not
[1:40:44] appear,
[1:40:46] from things that are not.
[1:40:52] It's not about what you can do. It's
[1:40:55] about what he can do.
[1:41:00] If you can't do it, you a good candidate
[1:41:03] for a miracle.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you quit trying. Let God take
[1:41:10] over. Let go and let God.
[1:41:14] It's not about whether you are still
[1:41:16] holding. It's about him holding you.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Remember, all things will fail, but his
[1:41:25] word will never fail. Our
[1:41:29] God knows not defeat.
[1:41:34] When all hope is taken away and you
[1:41:37] reach a point whereby you say, "Brother,
[1:41:40] that thing will change it. I think we
[1:41:42] can't go any further with this. I think
[1:41:45] we can't do this anymore. I think this
[1:41:48] one we didn't think well. I think this
[1:41:51] one when all hope is taken away,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; just remember, just remember God knows
[1:42:00] no defeat
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; and God does not literate.
[1:42:11] Shall we stand on our feet?
[1:42:15] Be of good courage. God spake unto
[1:42:20] Joshua
[1:42:22] when all the river God pointed the way.
[1:42:30] Jordan and cross both things seemed
[1:42:34] impossible.
[1:42:37] W as divide as they march and oy
[1:42:46] rivers
[1:42:48] you think are uncrossable.
[1:42:53] Not any mountains
[1:42:56] you can't
[1:42:59] through.
[1:43:01] God special lies
[1:43:04] in things thought impossible
[1:43:10] and he will do what no other can do.
[1:43:18] Battles to win. They would meet with
[1:43:23] their obstacles.
[1:43:27] Jericho was who must fall to the ground.
[1:43:35] God never fed his stood back
[1:43:41] his promises
[1:43:47] as they mar.
[1:43:52] Oh God
[1:43:54] rivers
[1:43:56] you think are uncrossable.
[1:44:02] But any mountains you come.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God special lies
[1:44:13] in things
[1:44:15] impossible
[1:44:18] and he will do what other
[1:44:24] can do.
[1:44:27] God is the same and is why is
[1:44:32] dependable.
[1:44:35] He make a way through the world just for
[1:44:41] you.
[1:44:44] Life situations
[1:44:47] by him are menable.
[1:44:52] Mountains and hills they will part
[1:44:57] forth.
[1:44:59] My brother, sister,
[1:45:02] rivers
[1:45:04] you make are unosable
[1:45:09] mountain
[1:45:12] to God.
[1:45:17] God's special lives is
[1:45:21] all impossible
[1:45:25] and he will do what I can do.
[1:45:33] Golden River
[1:45:50] special.
[1:45:58] I wonder why
[1:46:02] I've been
[1:46:38] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Let's give
[1:46:41] the Lord and clap for praise tonight.
[1:46:45] Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:46:50] Oh, he
[1:46:52] made a way.
[1:47:00] You
[1:47:02] made a way.
[1:47:09] When a bow against the wall
[1:47:14] and it closes.
[1:47:18] over
[1:47:20] you
[1:47:23] made
[1:47:25] a way
[1:47:28] and we're standing here
[1:47:31] and we're standing
[1:47:33] here
[1:47:36] only because
[1:47:38] you
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you made a Will
[1:47:48] you
[1:47:50] make our way?
[1:47:58] You
[1:48:01] made our way.
[1:48:08] When I bounce against the wall
[1:48:14] and it looked as if it was over
[1:48:20] you
[1:48:23] made our way.
[1:48:27] We are standing here
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; only because
[1:48:37] you
[1:48:41] Oh, you better
[1:48:46] you
[1:48:53] made a way.
[1:49:01] I wait
[1:49:07] when I bounce against the wall
[1:49:12] and it looked as if it was over.
[1:49:18] You
[1:49:21] made my way.
[1:49:33] only because
[1:49:35] you made
[1:49:38] our way mountain
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; with your power with
[1:49:57] Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; You are for me.
[1:50:04] There is nothing.
[1:50:09] I see
[1:50:15] every standing
[1:50:18] here.
[1:50:20] Only because
[1:50:23] you made
[1:50:25] you move mountain. One more time.
[1:50:30] You move mountain.
[1:50:35] You cause walls to fall.
[1:50:41] With your power
[1:50:46] upon me,
[1:50:51] there is nothing
[1:50:59] more
[1:51:02] and there is
[1:51:06] only because
[1:51:09] you made
[1:51:12] our way. You made a way to do.
[1:51:17] Oh, you
[1:51:20] made our way.
[1:51:24] You better way.
[1:51:58] And I stand
[1:52:01] here
[1:52:03] only because
[1:52:06] you may
[1:52:12] just speak to the Lord tonight. Lift up
[1:52:15] your hand, your voice,
[1:52:18] and speak to him. Hallelujah.
[1:52:22] Oh, you made a way.
[1:52:26] He makes a way when there's no way.
[1:52:28] Hallelujah.
[1:52:39] Heat. Heat.
[1:52:57] I'm sorry.
[1:53:17] Heat. Heat. N.
