[41:05] praise the name of the Lord
[41:07] while you are still standing we shall
[41:09] take a scripture in the book of
[41:10] Ephesians chapter 2.
[41:17] I'd like to while you're opening your
[41:20] Bibles to thank the Lord for the grace
[41:22] he has given us to be able to speak to
[41:25] you in this conventions
[41:31] we want to thank God for Pastor Joseph
[41:34] and Tai for the invitation message
[41:39] and also for the confidence
[41:43] and you know invite us to come and speak
[41:46] to you
[41:47] it's very humbling especially when you
[41:50] have generous
[41:55] and there are others have had to say
[41:57] that these are generous
[42:00] but when they themselves are generous
[42:04] but to me when I said generals I really
[42:06] mean it
[42:09] because I'm a junior
[42:11] but we want to thank God for the
[42:13] generals
[42:15] let us thank God for the generation
[42:20] without them
[42:22] we all would not have been here today
[42:26] I mean whenever I look I see men of God
[42:30] I want to really respect you and say God
[42:33] bless you
[42:36] for allowing us to speak to you and your
[42:38] people
[42:41] amen I mean I was speaking to one of the
[42:45] brothers on the organizing committee
[42:49] DC and I think the assistant pastor
[42:54] Joseph and he asked me a question
[42:57] now he is the organizing committee
[43:00] [Music]
[43:02] how come that you're speaking the last
[43:04] service
[43:05] [Music]
[43:10] how did that happen
[43:13] how did you take that honor to do this
[43:16] I told him I do not know
[43:19] how come I even get to speak
[43:23] so he doesn't know so Pastor Leo said
[43:27] something he said it it's it's God who
[43:30] led past untai to ask whoever was to
[43:34] stand here in this convention
[43:38] oh
[43:40] so I believe that God knew our needs is
[43:44] indeed our needs are made
[43:49] I've been moved in this last service
[43:53] I want to say God bless you brothers
[44:01] and the other ministers
[44:07] I was I was charges participated in
[44:10] these meetings
[44:12] we closed our service on Sunday
[44:16] so we've been here
[44:19] amen I mean let us go to the scripture
[44:24] and then we shall read and see it
[44:30] um let us begin instead of verse 2.
[44:35] let us begin from verse one is
[44:52] [Music]
[45:01] [Music]
[45:07] foreign
[45:12] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[45:16] were in in time past you walked
[45:19] according to the course of this world
[45:21] according to the prince of the power of
[45:22] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[45:26] the children of Disobedience among whom
[45:29] also we all hear in this confession had
[45:33] our conversation in time past in the
[45:35] last of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[45:37] of the Flesh and of the mind and we are
[45:40] by Nature
[45:42] the children of Wrath even as others
[45:46] but I wanted to hear verse 4.
[45:49] it says
[45:53] and then there is a comma there
[45:56] so we should read this and pause a
[45:58] moment
[46:01] I wonder you each of us could say those
[46:04] two words
[46:11] who is rich in Mercy
[46:13] for his great love we are with he loved
[46:16] us
[46:17] even when we were dead
[47:14] [Music]
[47:23] and we know that one of these days
[47:26] we will no longer be here because we
[47:30] will be gone
[47:31] it's a privilege
[47:33] and I want to thank you for your grace
[47:38] now to you
[47:40] in Jesus name amenities
[47:56] but God
[47:58] that's the subject I have in my mind
[48:03] thank you brother for singing that song
[48:05] for us massage
[48:10] you know we've been in this convention
[48:13] and we have had a lot of teachings
[48:17] a lot of exhortations
[48:20] a lot of preachings and I believe we are
[48:23] full
[48:24] I don't think that we need more
[48:27] but I think what we need we need tonight
[48:30] is to think about what God has done
[48:34] for us in this house
[48:37] and so there are many uh preachers that
[48:40] have preached wonderful summons
[48:45] and you know last night there was a
[48:48] healing service
[48:55] and you see I had something uh in my my
[49:00] heart and
[49:03] what I wanted to see what I was laboring
[49:07] in my heart to see
[49:08] but I want to say in this in the past
[49:11] Services
[49:27] we didn't come just to talk about the
[49:30] message
[49:33] to be in us
[49:36] and for us to be in nothing in Christ
[49:41] so the service
[49:43] I don't think I'll be wrong I do not
[49:46] know I was money but this is the last
[49:49] service
[49:50] after now you are going home but if I
[49:52] were not to dakas I want you to you know
[49:55] uh pay attention now for a few moments
[49:58] [Music]
[50:00] and see the Bible says and you
[50:03] has it quickened him
[50:06] who are dead interest
[50:12] is not somebody who is a murderer
[50:17] somebody who is a thief or somebody who
[50:21] is an adulterer
[50:22] I realize that all of us were upon Cena
[50:27] the Bible says we all have sinned
[50:30] and all have come short of the glory of
[50:33] God
[50:35] like I said in the other service we have
[50:37] seen as because we were born
[50:41] you were seen us because we were born of
[50:44] a woman
[50:45] the Bible says
[51:28] [Music]
[51:47] [Music]
[52:01] the Bible says he is the savior
[52:05] he is the Redeemer you remember the
[52:08] three the three uh Hebrews children
[52:12] you know the prophet says as they walked
[52:15] into the fiery furnace
[52:20] you know all the Angels they wanted to
[52:23] go down
[52:27] they had waited upon the Lord they asked
[52:31] one another message
[52:38] and
[52:41] they say to themselves and to others
[52:44] we know that our God is able to save us
[52:49] but even if he does not serve us
[52:52] he will walk through the fire
[52:55] I want to tell you here today
[52:58] is able to take us out of it every
[53:01] situation
[53:03] but even if he did not do it
[53:06] Hallelujah we know he's more than able
[53:09] to do it
[53:11] we know that we will go through the fire
[53:13] anyhow
[53:17] praise the name of the Lord
[53:20] Hallelujah
[53:40] praise the name of the Lord
[53:43] as they walked through the fire
[53:46] I'm sure all the Angels were on there on
[53:49] their toys
[53:53] [Music]
[53:55] let me go and cause
[54:00] you know I can do it you created me to
[54:03] do that let me go and save your son
[54:10] cartoon
[55:04] [Music]
[55:10] I want you to see something here
[55:13] you are dead
[55:15] as long as you are not yet believe the
[55:17] message
[55:19] you were just dead you did not know it
[55:23] but you were dead
[55:26] until you know what Christ has done for
[55:30] you on the cross you were a day
[55:34] but there are many groups and many
[55:36] denominations
[55:37] that talk about the cross but I'm
[55:41] convinced they do not know what the
[55:42] cross is
[55:44] because the cross
[55:51] it is the blood that has reconciled us
[55:54] back to God besides
[55:56] and our ministry is the ministry of
[55:59] reconciliation
[56:02] reconciling human beings
[56:08] the Bible now continues to say is the
[56:11] word of reconciliation
[56:14] we don't have the blood of Jesus today
[56:23] the blood of Jesus sacris in every
[56:26] generation is embedded in the word of
[56:30] that power
[56:33] was the blood of that Tower
[56:37] the message of wisely was the blood of
[56:39] the tower
[56:42] was the blood of that Tower
[56:44] the message of William Branham is the
[56:47] blood of this hour
[56:50] because the message is not an idea of a
[56:54] man
[56:55] the message is the mind of Jesus Christ
[57:04] and the Bible says we were dead in our
[57:08] unbelief so now sin is unbelief we are
[57:13] in the message
[57:17] on the message of the hour
[57:21] when you refuse to be foreign
[57:30] how many believers do I have here
[57:36] now we all have believed
[57:40] now we can read the scripture
[57:42] and say the Bible says and you as he
[57:47] quickened
[57:48] Musa who were dead

[58:06] to the course of this world

[58:17] here
[58:19] lift up your hands
[58:23] how many Catholics
[58:27] you are dead in that moment
[58:31] how many Adventures
[58:36] those how many Muslims we're Muslims
[58:41] how many Jehovah Witnesses
[58:46] yes right there um
[58:50] there are many lodges that we were in
[58:53] warri
[58:57] [Music]
[58:59] hallelujah amen
[59:02] who is Rich
[59:05] he loved us yes
[59:12] [Music]
[59:29] all the other purpose for his brothers
[59:33] and the purpose of God is
[59:37] never can stop it no amount of demons
[59:41] because the purpose of God cannot be
[59:44] defeated
[59:47] in the church
[1:00:01] when you come
[1:00:04] and another person says
[1:00:07] that if you really yield yourself to God
[1:00:11] I will say so much that refused you with
[1:00:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:00:14] you will be a thunder to the devil
[1:00:19] that the devil will not know what to do
[1:00:23] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:00:25] the end time messages
[1:01:01] and now you will sing Against the things
[1:01:04] I used to do I do them no more
[1:01:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:12] and he continues on to say we're in in
[1:01:15] time past you walked according to the
[1:01:17] course of this world
[1:01:23] and he says according to the priests of
[1:01:26] the power of the Earth
[1:01:28] the spirit that now works in the
[1:01:30] children of the Disobedience
[1:01:34] God never takes anyone to Hell
[1:01:38] actually the purpose of God is not to
[1:01:40] take any human being to him
[1:01:43] again hell was created for
[1:01:46] foreign
[1:02:13] foreign
[1:02:20] foreign
[1:02:52] foreign
[1:03:33] so we all had our conversations in time
[1:03:35] passing the lusts of our flesh
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:41] in the lusts of our flesh
[1:03:45] fulfilling the desires of the flesh

[1:03:51] those desires
[1:03:57] did you know you don't have to overdose
[1:04:02] but if the devil gets to convinced you
[1:04:04] you cut you cannot do otherwise then you
[1:04:06] always fulfill them

[1:05:16] when my father is angered he can even
[1:05:20] remove your eyes
[1:05:27] but this is
[1:05:36] the Bible actually agrees with you
[1:05:39] he says
[1:05:47] by Nature now the thing is in You by a
[1:05:51] nature
[1:05:53] your Fallen nature
[1:05:56] you have another nature
[1:05:59] another nature which is not from there
[1:06:03] another nature which is from the heavens
[1:06:06] the nature of Jesus Christ
[1:06:32] communication goes away

[1:08:21] foreign
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:20] that made the change right there
[1:09:22] God who is Rich

[1:09:30] to stop your desires
[1:09:32] you don't have to do it by yourself my
[1:09:35] sister
[1:09:37] don't try to be a hypocrite
[1:09:40] we have many hypocrises
[1:09:45] foreign
[1:10:12] I have nothing against them sit in a
[1:10:15] chamber what can I have good news for
[1:10:16] you
[1:10:17] Hallelujah I mean you don't have to
[1:10:19] remain a scene
[1:10:21] because you are trying to manufacture
[1:10:23] right yes

[1:10:29] who is richer
[1:10:50] foreign if he was rich in money
[1:10:55] if he was just rich in materials
[1:10:59] which he is
[1:11:06] God is rich
[1:11:09] [Music]
[1:11:12] no believers
[1:11:16] God is rich in money

[1:11:49] you will not drive this thing
[1:11:54] because you would be termed as proud and
[1:11:57] a sinner
[1:11:59] so it comes to a point even when a
[1:12:02] brother has the money
[1:12:12] because you want to be humble
[1:12:15] but that's all right
[1:12:20] but even the one who was them and uses

[1:14:19] but we are in the world now
[1:14:25] if you don't hear it from the pulpits of

[1:15:20] I talked to you of assistance
[1:15:23] you know who used to come to church in
[1:15:25] trousers

[1:27:33] foreign
[1:28:20] why didn't he
[1:28:24] not let that happen

[1:28:38] and only he can save her yeah
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:52] Christ who is the husband Oman is the

[1:30:42] we must not settle for less
[1:30:45] you know many people said only for the
[1:30:48] understanding of the world

[1:31:12] to die
