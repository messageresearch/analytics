Bibles and uh you read with me the book of uh uh Revelation Chapter 2 we are reading from verses 1 to 6 we are reading in the name of the Lord andto the angel of the Church of ephesius write this thing says he that holded the seven uh the Seven Stars in his right hand who WTH in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can thou can not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and and not and has found them liars and has born and has born and Hast patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember that from whence thou H thou Fallen repent and do the first works or else I'll come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of Ni lons which I also hatte amen then shall we read Matthew chapter 24 vers 12 Matthew 24:12 Matthew 242 I will begin from 11 says and many uh many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall Works cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come Lord Jesus we thank you for the reading of the word word I just pray that in the these few minutes we going to spend here that Lord you'll come and speak to us Lord father we thank you circumcise our ears circumcise my lips and our hearts that Lord we shall receive this word with gladness in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen praise be to God hallelujah I want you may have your seats uh tonight I'm going to I want us to talk about uh return to your first love praise be to God Amen and uh I'll have [Music] some I have several numbers of quote on that and uh I'm trusting God that I will lean on those quotes blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah yeah maybe before before I start preaching I just want to update you about brother Brian uh I was with them this evening I had some busy day I was caught up somewhere some Breen have also visited uh we able to visit him at the hospital and also thank you for those who have been praying yeah I don't have a lot to say uh about it uh but what what I can tell you this evening uh they've left for the north theyve gone to BU the baby amen so remember them in prayer you know driving at night is also takes the grace of God because it is a very long distance and uh they started their Journey this evening at around I think around 6 it was approaching seven so kindly remember them brother Ivan escorted them uh just remember them in your prayers and also for all those who are in our church Forum uh we posted there's a post which uh we posted there kindly respond because they need our physical or our prayer have been praying for them but still they need our financial support as well so kindly if you have something that you'd want to do you can uh you can see me amen so tonight we are sharing again on return to your first love blessed be the name of the Lord and uh I believe we living that time uh these are the thing this is the prophecy which was proph propes side and remember when Jesus after here Jesus was talking to the disciple and still it was telling us about this day that we are living in amen we are living in the time where things are moving it's like the world is upside down praise be to God we are living the Harvest Time on the other other side it's a good time time for the bride but it's also a dark time to the world and also we living in the time where there are a lot of things happening but unless we keep ourself with the word we may end up missing the mark blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read here in Revelation uh we are seeing when God was speaking the Church of Ephesus and was telling them reminding them uh to return to their first love blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know the first love brother bam refers it uh he say something about the first love in this message let me start with that quote [Music] looking for that quote praise the Lord he says in the message uh in the resume of the ages that is in church ede book uh I think that's chapter 10 it says that uh the the true church had lost it his first love that love was typ filed as the love of bride and groom at their marriage and ear years of wedding life blessed be the name of the Lord the love we are reading here in Revelation the prophet says uh that that love he says that under the angel of the churches of Ephesians write this things says the he that hold the Seven Stars in his right hand who walth in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them H which say they are Apostles and are not and has form them liar and thou has born and H has patience for my name's sake hast thou labored and hast thou not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast lost thy left thy first love amen they had left their first love blessed be the name of the Lord in the prophet here says that the church had lost its first love that love was typified as the love of the bride and the groom at their marriage and their early years of wedding life there was a c knowing of that complete love and the abandonment to God blessed be the name of the Lord and as we are checking ourself tonight I don't know how it is with you the love you used to have for the word the love you used to have for Fellowship the love you used to have amen that love which used to make you go pray and fast go in the bush amen seeking for the presence of God is that love love still there because here where we read in Matthew he told us that because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall Works cold here Jesus was addressing Believers blessed be the name of the Lord and where we read in Revelation it says repent and go back to the first love praise be to God the only way we can get out of that condition is through repentance we repent and we start arresh praise the Lord repentance bring the healing of the body and even the healing of the Soul when Christian repent when Believers repent that brings Revival amen the only thing that can bring Revival in our midst in our lives in our homes in our families it is repentance blessed be the name of the Lord we repent and we go back to the first love amen return you must Return To Your First Love First Love Has a lot praise be to God in 1 Thessalonians 5: 21 1 to 22 it says 21 say that prove all things hold fast that which is good prove all things and hold fast that which is good blessed be the name of the Lord you see the first love has something to do with a Zeal Talk of the hunger for the word talk of The Thirst blessed be the name of the Lord the moment The Thirst is not there the moment that hunger for the word for righteousness is not there my brother my sister we are getting nowhere but here he says remember you know each in Christian walk we know it's a journey we came from Egypt we are going through the Wilderness and we are moving to the promised land amen and alongside this journey there are many challenges along the way because when Jesus called us he never told us even when he called the Israelites he only told them about the promised land he never mentioned about the FR tribes in the wilderness he never told them about the Red Sea praise be to God so they were supposed to look at the promised land because that that is what God was showing them God knew that this other thing is just a minor thing he would fight their battles he would help them in delivery he would set them free he would give them Victory he would give them light by night and by day blessed be the name of the Lord so their main theme was to focus on the journey and as long as that first love is there serving God becomes so sweet that's when you sing and you say the more you serve him the sweeter he becomes so he grows amen but when we reach a point when coming to church is a burden there is something wrong somewhere praise be to God that is a that is a sign of danger when you reach a time when church is boring you brother sister you are dying you are in a dying state when worship become a problem you just know that you are dying praise be to God but God warned us about this generation we are living in and Jesus told them because iniquity shall abound [Applause] praise be to God we are living in the time where the wrong is the right and the right is the wrong brother samel says that the things which used to be done in dungeons they are now in open place amen we are living in the time where you find prostitutes on the streets during in fact in broad daylight where you find young people drinking in Broad day light this is the day we are living in we are living in the time where Satan has trips women naked their stpes naked until nakedness has become a fashion why because iniquity shall abound and the Same Same Spirit has even crept into the church praise be to God people are no longer mining about serving God it's like nobody's concern at all it's like some we just come maybe to please others or paying a visits to others where is the problem we have lost the first love praise be to God where is that Zeal you used to have when you used to be here 2 hours before the service starts where are the men and women who used to pray amen spend the whole night on their knees where are those young men and women praise be to God who used to worship God even when they are walking they are singing worship to God what happened if you check if you look at yourself how are you standing blessed be the name of the Lord Philippians 4:8 says that finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things praise be to God think oh on those things praise be to God repent and go back to your first love the only way back is repentance it's later than we think according to scriptures and what we sing the time is at hand and this comes to an individual it is individual Affair praise be to God the determination begins with you no one is going to force you the ministers will Minister preachers will preach the word but brother it's up to you to work up because if Jesus said that because iniquity shall aband the love of many shall Works cold Check Your Love Is Your Love growing or is working cold or it's getting cold every single day and how do I know look at the love you have for the word for Fellowship for Brethren amen that seal to ser God that still to seek for his presence for the Bible says that I love those who love me and those who seek me early they shall find me in samel Jesus said that because I called you and you will not answer you will call me and I will not answer you in that time is coming amen so we better seek God now because the time is coming when the church WIll weep when the church will pray when the church WIll fast when preachers will preach and God will not answer praise be to God when the Rapture will take place banam tells us foolish virgin will keep [Music] on they will not even know that Rapture has occurred how will you know praise be to God Daniel was connected are you connected [Music] tonight he was reading the message of his day are you reading the message of your day do you you know the promises of your day are you seeking for the Holy Ghost remember the foolish virgin the the prophet tells us all of them were a virgin they were not defiled but what made what made the difference was one the foolish virgin they were virgin they also had oil in their lamps but they had extra oil praise be to God because when they tmed their lamp praise be to God that's why we should not we should never lose that first love but in the message in Lan Church AG say that the city was rich Endor by wealth it was full of CES science abounded how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but C and dead and this is what we are seeing today churches have good music they sing like Angels but dry like Stone they are formal but cold and dead culture and education have taken the place of the spirit given word and faith has been s has been surpassed by science so that man is a victim of materialism blessed be the name of the Lord men they have become the victim of materialism we are living in a time where everybody is busy families are busy fathers are busy mothers are busy children are busy praise be to God you go to a home parents are busy mother are busy in their office fathers are busy children are busy either with the tablets or other things uncles are busy grandfathers are busy grandmothers are busy bses are busy some sometimes even when you're walking the evening through the jam you will find out of 100 cars 95% they are busy they are driving while busy on their smartphones and their tablets praise be to God busy for [Music] what some minority are busy for the right cause majority are busy for the Devil he's driving watching pornography he driving suring this and this this one is driving doing this and this the other one is walking by the time he realize already in the trench down praise be to God and you find even Believers by the wayima one full month you've never even read one page of the Bible you've never even read leave alone the page of the Bible the introduction of the message book God is chosen place of worship when you look at a message say God is and you put it down you were busy and you spend a lot of time on social media praise the Lord because iniquity shall abound the love of many that love is not to eat rice and por and chicken that love is fervent desire to serve God fervent desire to get deep in God F desire to get somewhere in the Holy Ghost amen that is the love God is talking about here and because they have drifted from that he reminded them I know your patience I know your works praise be to God repent and go back to thy First Love blessed be the name of the Lord I don't say that having those things they B to be on your smartphones and or on social media that's not what I'm trying to say but should not take the place of God it should not take the place of Prayer in your life even in our homes it's good to go on the YouTube and stream the sermons but that should never take the place of God it should never replace prayer [Applause] amen but when I'm saying the strongest weapon which God has put in the hand of man is prayer and we cannot exchange that or substitute with something else Prayer Will Remain prayer Daniel conquered through prayer amen Apostle Paul stood in in front of death through prayer it was through prayer that Peter was released in prison there were some people who knew where the sacred was blessed be the name of the Lord that's why in the life of Christianity in the life of Christian prayer has to be number MO blessed be the name of the Lord amen but what I'm saying that from out of this chaos of this modern science Eden that we are living in of the culture and Science and education all this modern stuff will rise men are looking for material things until the devil has made people even think that is doing something wrong but he convincing the people that even God knows even God Al is saying this they are justifying themsel in doing wrong things and because iniquity shall abound butam says in the message turn on the light that the grain should mure with the light because the thing is today the church grain don't want to mure it won to stay like it was back we cannot be matured by reading newspapers amen by coming to church on on Sunday by reading the Bible when the preacher is reading on the pulpit praise the Lord you see the church grain don't want to mature says the prophet it won't say like it was back but this is another hour brother tell your brother this is another hour tell that sister this is another hour amen we are living in the time when the life has moved from the the roots and now it's in the seed so this is the hour of maturity this is the Harvest Time amen it is gleaning time the Holy Ghost is going on blessed be the name of the Lord we should not Remain the Pentecostal era the bride has moved and it's now the life is in the seed and remember the prophet says the shark will not inherit with the seed don't remain in the shark you are the seed amen it won't stay like it was back but this is another hour this is another day brother Andrew this is another day this is the advancment of the Gospel it is the is coming to it is mature day amen we must come to maturity and the church is getting mature by the word prayer amen let us get drunk of the Holy Ghost may God give us that first love where people will hardly leave their homes without prayer when they're going for work why we not have that business of praying when you are driving oh Father I thank you I forgot to pray but Lord I Thank you as I'm going you also see you know the business whereby Believers eat and they remember say God I pray for the food that you've already eaten but when that first love is there prayers come first before any decision is made prayer comes [Music] first amen before we go for any battle before any engagement is made prayers will come first what is God saying about this we are D bound when we see things are moving in the opposite direction to go before God and ask God things are moving this is not our promise praise be to God we must know our promises how can you be in church for one year 6 month one year two years 3 years 10 years no Holy Ghost where are you going it is impossible we are human beings we are children of God Amen you know the way sin infiltrate into public the devil has a way of doing doing it our pastor tell us the Devil comes and show it once and everybody then t thce five times and now become it becomes now normal that is the same thing when the Holy Ghost is preaching in the church sometime the devil make people think that is normal they they mention they talk about it and you just leave it there brother this is between life and death amen you must apply the token on your door post it was a must not a may not sir it was a commandment from God it was a command if you are to be spared by Death Angel the blood was supposed to be on your door poost praise be to God the death angel will pass one of these days amen one of these days one

but we shall understand it better by and by amen God want us to return to that first love love for God having that fervent desire we used to go to the bushes and Forest you go to abandon structures to

tith time for God do you know fresh Let Us return to that first love blessed be the name of the Lord don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers excuse me if you don't feel that way then I tell you it is time you go to praying you see you must feel that way when is the church Opening Service we must be in fact we must feel that way I can't wait to go and meet my brothers these are your brothers you are going to spend eternity with you are not going to spend eternity with your workmates if they're not Believers you will [Music] not if you want to chill chill with your brothers in Christ don't shill with nonbelievers they will drag you to hell if you want to have some good time some grand time have it with Believers you know Believers are boring let me tell you Believers are boring they are boring with their long dresses they're boring Brothers Believers are so boring they are primitive he the purches of God are primitive and they boring so you go shield with this one walking on boxers and you feel someone is putting on underneath a man with a tiny leg you're even holding hand and you are taking self is shame on you church will never bore you but abam says the closest place to Heaven is the pulpit so when you're in church you are close to Heaven you are in heaven blesses in Christ Jesus amen so we cannot get bored when we in the church that cannot happen because when we are here angels are here this is where men Feast with angels when that first love is there you will pray you will pray for your brother you will not condemn him when you not seeing him you will come to the altar say God I pray for brother so and so when you hear something something say God I pray for this brother I pray for that sister you will not condemn blessed be the name of the Lord Sunday you will be here very early in the morning when you rest you'll have nice dreams you see Angels descending and ascending and descending and ascending and you will rush you very fast that oh God I can't wait seeing Angels there but because sometime we are not most time some people are not connected because of the things you are watching because of the things you are hearing amen demons will strangle the whole night and when you wake up in the morning the first thing you have no appetite for church because the door to the S is our eyes what we hear and what we see you can see naked women and think you come and meditate in the spirit you come with Sparks from hell on you fumes from hell will be on you blessed be the name of the Lord but God want us when we are connected and that's why he says that's why he rebuked this church age he told them return to your first love because God knows without that first love brother you will never serve god without that first love without the first love you service will be Li service but Jesus said now the time has come when the true worshipers will worship God in spirit and in truth when that first love is there you will worship God In Truth when lift up your hands you will be meaning it when you say hosana hallelujah even God will stamp on that because he knows that the service the sacrifice the worship comes from the heart amen and remember the prophet tells us that the first church the the the Ephesians church the church of the book of the acts is the pattern so in whatever we are doing whichever things we are going whatever thing whichever things we going through the life you're experiencing we have spiritually you know first when I marry because their sister will prepare Jews you are deceived go God will not yeah sometime they conso themselves yeah you know when you come out of f when they have prepared their orange Jews Apple Jews shame on you and from the days of John the Baptist until today the kingdom of God suffer the violence and the violent they take it by force repent and go back to your first love that's why God want dvf let's go back to our first love let ministers go back to their first love let deons go back their first love interpreters and song leaders amen and musician let us go back to our first love let us rebent and go back every believer young or old repent and go back Sunday schools my sisters let us repent and go back to our first love where we used to come so early and the teacher find us when we already there blessed be the name of the Lord when momy is still busy with you say mommy for us we have gone we shall have breakfast after oh you will come with our breakfast let us go because Sunday school is there waiting for us blessed be the name of the Lord and even at Sunday school when you come don't just come and sit and start gazing around you see that thing there you see that no when you come start singing let your teachers find when you are singing blessed be the name of the Lord sometime Believers come and they reach Church compound and then now we go back to our phones you busy making call with your grandfather with your grandmother with your uncle with your cousins brother make your calls at home when we come to church let Church be Church praise be to God let us make our bosses know that our church is church have you ever gone to Muslim shop during the time of they call it Juma Juma and he keeps giving 5 kg of sugar telling my friend and you find a brother waiting for the Muslim and the GU is doing is kneels them and then after but when it comes to Believers coming to church God has no grandchildren Pentecostal we used to think that Pentecostal they think they the but it is now becoming terrible message Believers think that God's grandchildren because we have the message because we read the seals because we read the church ages we know the book of Exodus we know this and think now so Brethren let a Kill blessed be the name of the Lord but Jesus said when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwelleth in us he will Quicken our moral bodies we need the quickening power the quickening power will restore us it will bring us back to the love of God it restore the love of God in us blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'm a about to finish just in I'm finishing but mam says in this message if you don't have a church you must see you will die spiritually you will just drle away you need church we must be in church even when you at school s God bless you you struggle say at least I must be there she stays in muko but she struggles she fight to see that she comes around to be an ego of God you have got to follow the word day by day you have got to continue feed upon the word not only following [Music] it we must feed day by day the Lord is my shepherd it is because we don't read the word we used to be in church even up to date when the pastor is preaching all the word is going on you some sometimes you get nuggets and but because when you look at future you look at yourself that's why you sit you cross your leg and even Slumber stay connected let us be tuned and when it comes to Young the good thing our church is for young people I'm also young to go AI will not take you to heaven it is the holy ghost that will take you to heaven Jesus said that when the Holy Ghost is come he will bring this thing into our remember he will teach us not a brother sister let us eat the word day by day and yet we are told here every day someone in the like they are flooded over the YouTube we are listening to teaching and preaching here and from other Fellowship as this still that's why in the church that's why in the churches is getting cold and cooling of it is because we have been indifferent toward God we have been this is true the church has been indifferent toward God we take things for granted worship we just give like half bed worship but not until we know that we are serving God blessed be the name of the Lord but bam tells us in this same message Lan Church age that he want you ready h of Reason beginning from tonight are you going to be ready hot or you're going to be freezing brother but when it comes to God's courtroom it is the opposite he want you ready hot or freezing one one or other don't be look warm just don't pretend something that you haven't got amen if you know you have not gotten any experience brother be that cry to God to give you an experience and that is true I've seen people falling someone Falls and tell you you feel like the person has the prophet is warning is telling us be yourself just don't pretend something that you have not got either be on fire for God or go on back but don't be then as I'm finishing with this quote he says why he says would you stand to your feet Brethren would we stand to our feet to would you stand to your feet just a minute oh God be merciful run people hurry hurry hurry get to Christ as quick as you can get away from the modern walls of formalism get into the middle of God's grace quickly let us get into the middle of God's grace blessed be the name of the Lord yeah I still have a lot but I will stop there may the Lord bless you amen Lord Jesus we thank you for this evening we thank you for the preaching of the word I believe what you put in my heart I have spoken it out to your children and I ask you Lord Jesus you help me as well run this race May you restore that love in our heart Lord it is the Cry of our heart as you say that come unto me all those say with the heavy L and will give us rest indeed Lord we need that rest in our soul we need it to give us the direction to give us that Zeal that yearning that craving for Holiness in our heart give us the heart that will hurt sin give us determination Lord open our understanding Lord Jesus indeed we need that love remember in the Acts of the Apostles when those Fells were being persecuted Lord they gathered in one of the brothers and they prayed and the Bible says they were refilled again Lord we need refilling in this journey we need your grace to help us go precious Lord Jesus it's our desire it's our prayer is our cry that you will redeem our soul fight our battles because you say the battles belongs to you father give us that willingness in our heart because you said that nobody can come unless Lord you trust him we believe that Lord you've called us Lord and Lord you've called us not just for the sake but you've called us into per affection is our desire tonight that you lead us in this way of Holiness precious father stare that love in our heart never leave us to rest like Ruth until Lord we have conquered all our promises bless our pastor and the church Lord if there be somebody whose feeling has been hurt it's not intentional but Lord I pray that may the Holy Ghost minister to that Throne Lord Jesus may you bless even those have been streaming Heavenly Father help us to be better Christian to repent and go back that first love in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray [Music] amen As we sing that chorus as comeing our pastor let us sing Love Lifted Me Love Lifted Me [Music] Lord Le de [Music] Me Love [Music] loveed Me Love Lifted Me loveed me when nothing is [Music] gooded me amen just for before we go to prayer I just wanted to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ you know the holy spirit is a a very is a a is a god of order he's a god of order I was a uh for the past maybe 1 hour or two with a certain young man you know sharing the word and uh the things that I was sharing we came here for the last 20 minutes we've been listening he can tell it is exactly what we were talking you know even the subject going back to the first return to the first love and you know most of the things that have been said I believe God will speaking to him and reconfirming that but I believe God has been speaking to all of us and so thank you for coming to church God bless each of you uh uh may God bless each of you and give us a wonderful time in his presence for the time we are going to be in prayer now before we go to prayer I just wanted to I don't know whether Brother Martin I was not here when the service was beginning whether he has uh uh announced it he did yeah maybe I just wanted to give you a little backround being that I will not be here on Sunday when the Believers will be uh informed the details as well brother Brian is one of those brothers that uh you know joined our church not long ago maybe about a year now but he's been very consistent consistently coming to the fellowship uh he was a Believer when he came you know from his home but uh I think along the way he spent a long time around here without fellowship and he he back sleep and uh that's when I think he got this sister also at that time she was not a Believer so she believed actually from this church and uh so he came back with her and then she believed here and she was baptized here and well he told me we have been living together for a while we even expecting a child I said well you do not have to separate from her do people know that you have her she he said yes her people know that I have her but they demanded that I I fulfill ABC D then we can get married so I told him well before God you already husband and wife and I don't think it is necessary for you to separate from her butth we can arrange after you have fulfilled your requirements then we can arrange for you to uh to be married off officially so um they were expecting this child and they were very happy you know to have the child but unfortunately as you old I I think I don't know whether this detail was given but uh they went to the first hospital you know the the child was um they was telling saying that they going to operate the sister but uh it looked like it it would not work out they would need to operate her but by God's grace when they went to another hospital of course with your prayers uh she was able to give birth normally and everybody was happy now I do not know maybe that Dr M has more details on that on why but uh I was told that it appears the child had complications during the time of birth and U swallowed some you know water whatever and and so I do not know whether the hospital there it's a government hospital I don't know whether they did not understand what had happened so they were putting the child on on oxygen but when the child was taken to another hospital which is now a bigger hospital that's where they were able to discover because the child had not actually breast fed since she was born that's where they were able to discover that actually it has not been just a breathing problem it was what was swallowed so that's when they when they cleaned out the child and everything became normal actually Brother Martin spoke to the brother was it yesterday is Brother Martin there yesterday yeah and the brother was very happy brother was there at the hospital the brother was very happy oh now the baby's feeding for the first time and the mother is Happy the father is happy so it seemed everything had normalized now and I think a few hours then later you know the the the Lord accepted that the child would be taken away from them so certain things we understand certain things we don't but we know that it's God the oth of life and it's God who takes it so at this time we need to stand with this young uh young people and young couple and you know support them it could be you it could be your brother is our brother here she's our sister here so we need to stand with them with the best we can do uh they are going very far away um I think the name was given on the group uh the name where they're going to do the barrial from it's um in Northern Uganda uh I see it's called a Leong that is after leader actually you know it's quite far so they need a a lot of money I was told over 500,000 so we need to give if possible to give all of it you know just support them and show them solidarity and love so I don't know how but I think this can be told again on Sunday myself brother Isaac and maybe a few of my family members we shall be away to Miana but on Sunday it will be told again and those of us who are here we shall have a bag when we are exiting so that you just give whatever you can give if you don't don't have money physically you can send on the number Brother Martin posted it on the uh on the on the on the group or you can just send it so that we can give as much as we can give to support them Amen brother Ivan sorry I did not hear that yes he decided to travel finally yeah initially we had planned that brother Ivan travels with him and as a church would sponsor brother Ivan to at least go on our behalf and you know Comfort the brother brother martin has ever gone through this kind of saga lost a child so he understands what it means uh so again we had canceled because of the of the finances that means it will even be now more expensive the money I mentioned is actually lesser so that means we really have to if brother Ivan is deciding finally to uh escort the brother up to Alon we need to really uh support him also uh on our behalf because he's representing us there so while we go to prayer we also remember that couple praise God praise the Lord yes it is a sad thing but uh we just remember them and pray that God sustains them and while they go through the trial that God will strengthen there
