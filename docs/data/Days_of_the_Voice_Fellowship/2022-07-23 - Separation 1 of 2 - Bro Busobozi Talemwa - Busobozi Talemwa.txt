TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign we are reading from verse one and the lord spoke unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when adam and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of another right to separate themselves unto the lord he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of vine tree from the colors even to the past all the days of the vow of his separation shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separated himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow all the days that he separated himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body he that shall make he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his god is upon his head that's up to verse 7 israel amen mena loving jesus yes we have ourselves to you tonight don't become us we are not as holy as your word is the truth and that's why we have come here so that we might be made holy fully according to your wife we desire that as we hear your word tonight we will be taken out of the way that you will speak to us why are you getting our faith and that we shall open our spiritual ears together but i pray that you refresh us every judge we hear your ask the lord to speak to you what's happening you'll get a journey the bible says ask and you shall receive i believe now can be open foreign i 18 september 2013. only one and so i thought i should i just suffered inspired to speak on this subject again and uh i trust it will be a blessing to us amen god bless you my name is aggression come on come on i appreciate it that you don't miss any service [Music] i was working with one brother the other day chris has never missed any you know mind we all understand what separation is separation is something very very interesting uh separation is a a must take in life but today i want us to look at it in a spiritual perspective [Music] here in the book of numbers moses gives the laws concerning separation i should say that the lord spoke to moses and he gave him laws concerning separation and this was also connected to a vow of another right way and more awakening if a woman or a man wanted to be to vow a vow of being another right they had to separate themselves now we are no longer under the law of moses which are the ones who are taking a muslim but we are still under the law of god wobble up to the ones who are taken yeah and the law of god is the word of god and if god required then for people to separate themselves i believe he still requires people now to separate themselves if god wanted then for people to be nazarites i believe even today he does that was a man or a woman that was living a consecrated life in service to god [Music] and they did not do everything that everybody else did from the time he was in his mother's womb but he had but you see it has its blessings that follow it another rape is always a little uh favored from the lord or by the lord he goes ahead to describe how he will separate himself and from what he says he will not drink wine he will not drink any strong drinks i will not drink vinegar vinegar he will not [Music] both physically and also spiritual that's why we keep our hair a certain was not supposed to touch the head of another one and now today we notice in the new testament it should not touch your sister's head you should not look like a woman told enough to look like the rest of the world because you are another right unto the lord am i preaching to someone tonight and he says that all the days of that he separated himself unto the lord shall not come to any dead body and he shall not take make himself any clean for his father or for his mother or for his brother when they die obama it doesn't matter whether it is your mother or your father if anybody loves their mother or their father or their sister or their brother more than christ must not love your family members more than you love christ then even if everyone else is not happy as long as you have made your priorities right are you following me so those were the rules the laws uh concerning separation concerning uh being in nazareth now in the message it shall be even as it was told me is elijah sleep separation in his death god wasn't with him in the death of christ god was not he died alone he had to suffer the absence of god in his death that we could have the presence of god in our deaths oh so many sins go before them and some follow abby every single year so many sins they go before them but some other many sins follow them which one do you want to go very do you want your sins to go before you or you want your sins to follow you oh yes follow me if you do not know then follow me let's bro if we confess them now we're to be had to reckon it goes before us so but if you don't live this life your sins they follow you and christ made our judgment christian and god in the garden of eden when he pronounced strength upon the human race [Music] from one another prayer will occur now means separation doesn't mean to you know die is that death is not the end of something it means that someday you will be separated from me because of jesus christ's death on the cross christopher he was the bridge between them and light hallelujah amen he was dying on the cross what did he do here [Music] because jesus died our death yes we are from which he fought your faith so that we could live his life i want no faith to turn body damage away can you tell that to somebody back of god jesus died our death yes we have how much fortune feels that we could leave his life faithful he died my death he had so much fortune so that i can live his life when i'm awake we die to the world to fight aliens so he could live his life says god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin leave any longer they reign christians must be dead christians must be separated jesus christ we are baptized into his death therefore we are part of him by baptism into death as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life christopher zucchinis were churched our way now we knowing that christ being raised from the dead dies no more into christ unto god he died until once unto sin and sin is unbelievable have you read the scripture what do you have to know and keep it let me take it slow a bit here because i want you to see something praise the name of the lord sin is unbelief all right let us read it first john chapter 3 verse 8. and then you read also verse seminar wrong and he that committed sin is of the devil according to your satani for the devil sinneth from the beginning did you hear that he that commits sin is of the devil i call it what's the term for the devil's sins from the beginning for this purpose in which purpose the song for this purpose of sin is for this purpose you know can you say for this purpose no the son of god was manifested are you hearing me that he might destroy the works of the devil if you could now i know it might look like preaching but i'm actually teaching you here me [Music] is a substance if you are in christ i'm a christian you must have faith the opposite of faith without faith you can't have the holy you need something whoever is born of god can not commit suicide amina let me read it this way can't show me when i cannot sing see someone do i have my brother or my sister here you know no no no no if i had them is separated b because of that amen did someone get it one word jesus yes die your father and to sin area because of that he don't want you i should recall myself also through jesus christ our lord oh i love jesus yes do you love jesus christ it is through him we hear that we have life we're throwing over them take out jesus from the bible yes and you have lives jesus christ yes christian the very hope of our salvation amen because of him because of him overcoming death yet as if we are dead oh you know you're not just saying i'm dead indeed hallelujah but because i am dead [Music] if someone knocks on your door what do you do you can let them in [Music] it's up to you already go and answer the the bear or not if you go again and find out oh it is you see hey but i told you you are not welcome no not gamble under that one it is out no no you know you know i have pleasure the scene will go i was sad one day brother [Music] sin or in our mind it should be because jesus separated the earth from sin yet which shall be seen has no power over us it should be that you could enough not the meaning of and we are indeed dead unto sin era truly full area as as instruments of unrighteousness unto saints [Music] [Music] bigger than your flesh you see he says neither do not yield it it's up to you to yield or not your quest do not heal your members as instruments of unrighteousness so you can decide to use your eyes your your nose your your your hands i'm also going in your corners you may decide to use it through instruments as instruments of unrighteousness you can decide to yield your eyes to watching the other things of the world last four things if you're going to decide to yield yourself to those no so you decide to yield your eyes to that amazing what they have you just watching the hollywood stuff things that are rotten again foreign do you really think the devil was more powerful than eve debate within yourself for a moment do you really think that the devil was more powerful really think about it you know if the devil was more powerful than he satan he was single he was more powerful than adam is an adam singer and if he was more powerful than adam singer it means he was more powerful than godzilla the devil could not have been more powerful than eve saturn [Music] [Music] you are listening to west life oh what it is people listening to all those things are listening oh what is that those songs really touch my heart is the new embassy [Music] yo and what does the bible say i believe neither you'll hear your members say why you'll be turned to be amazing instruments yes but the problem we have oh is it worthly now not very many people want to yield themselves unto god they're born again believers but they don't want to heal themselves why don't we have more and more gifts manifesting in the church [Music] why don't we have the book of acts the charge of the book of acts again in its power rajiv yielding their members unto god you already said come on what are you doing with your members because you don't spend time for my life yielding yourself unto god and you spend time healing yourself and to being righteous you see that's why even when you come to church it is very difficult sometimes even for the songwriter to start the service to allah atmosphere someone will stand up here sometimes you even someone runs after the preaching of the word i have a testimony of judaism and when you give them a microphone they want to preach they don't even attend fellowship on wednesday night september and what are they doing teach about their would happen one day of those things what they're hearing what you you do in your free time the moves i think some of us some of you need to do some cleaning cleansing on things that you have been yielding is more acceptable with comedy montreal young women excellent even in the church the name of canister they have wanted it to be commended for people have you ever been there you meet somebody whatever they count to them [Music] you know yielding his members to instruments there's a problem themselves will have no the minion over here why because we have a person who actually know we have a man who kept down on afghan [Music] that rules in death if you have a husband or a wife both of you are alive your husband rules over you bow revelation of jesus christ [Applause] we must sin has not died but we are the ones who are dead father amen say hallelujah he is alive but we are dead and when we die we're too far sin stopped ruling over there and now when we rose again and we have acquired another heart [Music] it has been raining on me the whole night [Music] my daughter is okay i am married to my husband listen again go away before my husband wakes up [Music] because [Applause] oh is and then afterwards you give a testimony [Applause] is our god gave a promise certainly he will serve you in childbirth hallelujah do not fear the mutual do not have anxiety the way that it is [Music] amen what do you want to see teacher have faith in god what do you want to do for you stop doubting separate yourself from unbelief you see and and god wants you to have a total separation away i would eat it actually he has already done it it's just called that but he wants you to walk into it it's all right now listen in the message israel and the church now this may be very strong and i wanted to notice immediately after choice now it's separation from everything else as soon as he called he elects yeah he calls night then when he calls that's why he separates you from everything that hangs on to you but then he could be bigger how many can you say that he's still separating something that proves that it isn't a denomination it isn't two or three people together please pray for them and allow god to do that in their life okay it isn't because my mother there is saved [Music] how much you prayed for what's happening no no no no it's not how much you pray it's not then that when you try the new page you had nothing to do with it oh my man when you get to see what is truth you say you mean that i didn't turn to the lord oh [Music] so it's not really you cut a sick way it's not what you did see what you had nowhere at all of turning to the roof listen to this your whole nature your homemaker in colorado my own nature was against god and there is no [Music] because if jesus would die yes you were a faction would be the only one the separate scene from human race and now all those in the human race amen hallelujah the song that is coming to me now what are you doing i don't remember the words but it's just kind of you could have your garmin errors [Music] [Music] praise god praise god i'm a child of the king you know i wasn't him before the foundation of the world young and inciting someone told me about jesus amen i have been living a life that is very different [Music] i've tried to leave it but i can't leave it why because there is something in me we may not feel it don't that you will not smell it the stream that you would need we have faith that is happening and faith that is there will please god put your son in sacramento and have faith who can stop it you you think you can bro go and ask for the soul of trust go and ask for the soul of god he came in contact with that
