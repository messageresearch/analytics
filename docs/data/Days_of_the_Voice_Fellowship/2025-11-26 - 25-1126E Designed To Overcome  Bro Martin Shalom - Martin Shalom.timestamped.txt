[34:19] to Moses and you told him to gather the
[34:22] people and speak to the rock though the

[34:31] Jesus and anoint me Lord. Take me out of
[34:34] the way and speak to your children.
[34:36] Father, you know the desires of our

[35:50] it is the right time. Praise be to God.
[35:54] Amen. Yeah. Shall we turn to our Bible?
[35:58] I just have some I just have a thought
[36:00] that I want us to share tonight.
[36:03] And you go with me to the book of
[36:05] Jeremiah.
[36:11] Jeremiah chapter
[36:19] five.
[36:46] Okay, let's uh you turn with me to
[36:49] Romans. We shall come back to Jeremiah.
[36:52] Romans chapter 8 vers 12.
[37:02] Romans chapter 8,
[37:05] if you're there,
[37:07] you say amen.
[37:12] Uh
[37:13] it says that therefore,
[37:16] brethren, we are debtors not to the
[37:20] flesh to live after the flesh. For if
[37:24] you live after the flesh, you shall you
[37:27] shall die. But if you if ye through the
[37:31] spirit do modify the deeds of the body,
[37:35] you shall live. For as many as are led
[37:38] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[37:41] of God. For you have not received the
[37:44] spirit of bondage again to fear, but you
[37:48] have received the spirit of adoption
[37:52] whereby we cry aba father.
[37:58] Lord Jesus, we thank you for the portion
[38:00] of the scripture we have read this
[38:02] evening
[38:04] and also for other scripture we read.
[38:07] Lord, I just pray that you come this
[38:09] evening and speak to our hearts. Father,
[38:12] in this time that you're going to spend
[38:14] here, come and encourage us. Come and
[38:16] revive us, Lord Jesus. Come and renew
[38:19] us, Lord God. That is the cry of my
[38:22] heart. That will be only you speaking to
[38:25] our hearts, Lord. Receive the glory,
[38:28] Lord, in Christ Jesus we pray. Amen. You
[38:32] will may have your seats.
[38:36] Uh I have something that I want us to
[38:38] share tonight. And uh I'm going to talk
[38:41] about
[38:43] uh design to overcome.
[38:48] Praise be to God.
[38:51] Hallelujah.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just pray for me uh that the Holy
[38:56] Spirit will speak to you.
[39:00] I want to talk about that design to
[39:02] overcome. Blessed be the name of the
[39:05] Lord. You see, there is a scripture in
[39:07] Jeremiah as Marvin is getting into us
[39:11] where he says that before we were formed
[39:14] in our mother's womb, he knew us. Amen.
[39:18] The Lord spoke to Jeremiah
[39:20] when he was sending Jeremiah
[39:23] and told him, "I've called you to be a
[39:26] prophet
[39:27] to the nation." Amen.
[39:30] Praise be to God.
[39:32] And uh if you read that scripture, you
[39:35] find Jeremiah giving excuses. You say,
[39:38] "But God, I am still young." And the
[39:42] Bible says the Lord told him, "Do not
[39:44] say that." Praise be to God.
[39:47] Before I formed thee in the belly, I
[39:51] knew thee.
[39:53] And before thou comest forth out of the
[39:56] womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained
[40:00] thee a prophet unto nations. Blessed be
[40:03] the name of the Lord. So I will flow uh
[40:07] alongside that thought where he say that
[40:10] before I formed thee in the belly, I
[40:13] knew thee and I will call my text
[40:17] designed to overcome. Blessed be the
[40:21] name of the Lord. You see, whatever
[40:23] happens around us or whichever
[40:26] challenges we meet in this life, praise
[40:29] be to God, God knew it before the
[40:32] foundation of the world. And God knows
[40:36] it very well that you have that
[40:39] potential. You have that ability to go
[40:42] through whatever comes your way. Amen.
[40:45] Because it's God leading us in this
[40:48] journey. Praise be to God. He called us.
[40:52] We did not call him. And the Bible tells
[40:55] us he loved us. He first loved us before
[40:59] we loved him. Praise be to God. Our love
[41:03] to God is just a response toward his
[41:07] love for us. Praise be to God. Amen. And
[41:12] I just want us to encourage ourself this
[41:14] evening. I want you and me to know that
[41:18] uh that what you are today that is how
[41:22] God has designed you and where you are
[41:25] he has designed you to be in this very
[41:28] place.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; You are not here by coincidence. You are
[41:32] not here as an accident. Amen. But you
[41:36] are in the right place where God saw you
[41:39] were way back before even you were born.
[41:42] Amen. And I'm here to tell you that what
[41:45] you are today, that's what God has made
[41:47] you to be.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; And God knows that no matter what you
[41:53] are going through, no matter the
[41:55] challenges you are facing, he is going
[41:58] to see you through because he designed
[42:00] you. Amen. With all the ability and the
[42:04] quality to overcome. Praise be to God.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were in God's mind. We have
[42:11] heard that over and over. We have read
[42:13] it in the scripture. We have heard it in
[42:15] the message that before the foundation
[42:17] of the world, we were in the mind of
[42:20] God. And today we are the children of
[42:23] God, the sons of God manifested. Praise
[42:27] be to God.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:30] is just like a
[42:32] a a builder
[42:35] or a carpenter, someone who came out
[42:38] with
[42:39] this pullpit here. When you find him
[42:42] there battling with uh timbers, you may
[42:46] not know what he's going to make. Praise
[42:49] be to God. These are two different
[42:51] design that we have here.
[42:54] But inside the carpenter's mind, he
[42:57] already has a picture.
[43:00] God designed him in the way that inside
[43:02] him is going to come out with a right
[43:06] picture of what is in his mind. And when
[43:08] you see him busy working, cutting this
[43:12] point
[43:13] is
[43:15] hammering this side, you may not know.
[43:18] Praise be to God. It's just like taking
[43:20] your clothes to a tailor. He will cut it
[43:23] until if you are if your heart is weak,
[43:27] you will complain because you will cut
[43:30] this part and throw the other side and
[43:31] you are seeing a a big portion of your
[43:34] clothes. You bought it expensively.
[43:37] Praise be to God. But because you are
[43:39] not a tailor, you will not know what he
[43:42] is doing. But inside his mind, he knows
[43:46] that you want a suit maybe a fitting.
[43:49] Amen. AND IS THROUGH ALL THOSE STAGES
[43:52] and process is going to come out with
[43:55] the right attire for you. Blessed be the
[43:58] name of the lord.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's how God also design us.
[44:04] We want there are things many time we
[44:06] are faced with a lot of THINGS BUT
[44:08] AMIDST ALL those things. Amen. We are
[44:13] designed we are the perfect design of
[44:16] God. Amen. And we are unchallengeable.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Whichever thing that comes OUR WAY, GOD
[44:24] DESIGNED us in a way that is not even
[44:27] shaken when we are going through this
[44:29] thing. Because he know that what he has
[44:32] put in us is more than able, more than
[44:36] enough. Amen. For us to go through what
[44:39] we are going through.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. When
[44:42] God called us, he called us to the
[44:44] battle. Amen. And we know that we are in
[44:48] the battle.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; We are undergoing training. Praise be to
[44:52] God. EVERY TIME WE COME HERE, we are
[44:55] working on uh we are in fact we are
[44:58] getting more training every day. Praise
[45:00] be to God. Ever since we believed, the
[45:03] day you believed is the day we join this
[45:06] battle. Is the day we join the army of
[45:09] the Lord. Praise be to God. AND FOR ALL
[45:13] THIS TIME WE ARE UNDERGOING TRAINING.
[45:15] Praise the Lord. And we have reached the
[45:17] point of the final battle.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. AND GOD KNOWS THAT WE
[45:22] ARE MORE THAN ABLE. Praise the Lord.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; He has GIVEN US EVERYTHING THAT WE need
[45:29] &gt;&gt; to overcome this time to overcome THIS
[45:32] GENERATION TO OVERCOME OUR PROBLEM.
[45:34] Praise be to God. He has given us his
[45:37] word. Amen. AND THE ONLY THING WE NEED,
[45:40] WE NEED THE QUICKENING POWER. Praise be
[45:42] to God. THAT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COMES
[45:44] IN OUR LIVES AND QUICKEN that seed.
[45:48] Praise be to God.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need.
[45:53] Praise the Lord. The Bible say that when
[45:56] the spirit that raised Christ from the
[45:59] dead, when he dwelleth in us, he will
[46:03] quicken
[46:05] our mortal body.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Inside us, there is something that need
[46:11] to be quickened.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And when God comes, he comes to activate
[46:19] that
[46:21] he put in us.
[46:25] That's what he activates.
[46:28] Praise be to God. I remember one time
[46:30] recent when uh our pastor told us that
[46:33] the word of God will only quicken the
[46:37] seed of God in you. The word will not
[46:40] change you but it will quicken that part
[46:43] that is in you. Praise be to God. THAT
[46:46] THE WORD DOES NOT CHANGE THE SEED in us
[46:49] but it quicken it. If it is a good seed,
[46:52] it will manifest. If it is a wrong seed,
[46:55] still it will manifest. Praise be to
[46:58] God. But I trust that all of us we are
[47:00] good seeds.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And that's why we are
[47:04] here tonight.
[47:06] Praise the Lord.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; God designed us to overcome.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Each time God looks at us is seeing
[47:16] overcomers.
[47:19] You know many time when we are
[47:21] challenged we think that now we have
[47:23] lost our salvation.
[47:25] Brother, sister
[47:27] tell me one man whom God has ever called
[47:31] who never had a wickedness.
[47:33] Praise be to God.
[47:36] All of them they had their weaknesses.
[47:41] But regardless of their weaknesses,
[47:44] God knew that they were the right
[47:46] candidate,
[47:47] the right warriors for that battle, for
[47:50] that specific time. Praise be to God.
[47:53] And that's how he designed them. Even as
[47:57] in this generation, in your weakness,
[48:01] that point where you think you are
[48:03] defeated, brother, you are not defeated.
[48:06] Amen.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. In your design there is no defeat
[48:13] &gt;&gt; because this is the working of God. God
[48:16] is the master engineer. He engineered
[48:19] you in the way that INSIDE YOU THERE IS
[48:22] SOMETHING that even the devil cannot
[48:25] mess with.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; The only thing the devil CAN DO IS
[48:30] TRYING to discourage you.
[48:35] And when we are discouraged, we are dis
[48:38] we are disconnected to that. Praise be
[48:40] to God. BUT WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH,
[48:43] HALLELUJAH,
[48:44] &gt;&gt; we are coming for innovation.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; ALL THOSE CHANNELS TO BE UNCLOGGED,
[48:53] ALL those wires, PRAISE BE TO GOD, WHERE
[48:56] THEY LOSE CONTACT WHEN THE WORD COMES.
[48:59] AMEN. THE WORD WORKS ON THAT AREA.
[49:02] Praise be to God.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; And by THE TIME WE LEAVE, WE GO WHEN WE
[49:07] ARE charged
[49:08] &gt;&gt; because inside us already, we have that
[49:12] flow.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; The flow OF THE HOLY GHOST FLOWS IN OUR
[49:18] LIVES.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL FIGHTS SO HARD to make us
[49:22] go astray
[49:24] because he knows that's the only way he
[49:26] can disconnect us from that. Praise be
[49:29] to God.
[49:32] Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us
[49:37] that which man is that when he's going
[49:40] to build a house,
[49:43] he not first sit and count the cost
[49:46] less you build and you stop on the way.
[49:50] Praise be to God. And then people will
[49:53] laugh at you because you never
[49:56] calculated before you started your
[49:58] building. But God is not that kind of
[50:01] builder. And that's why when Moses
[50:03] realized that in the wilderness when God
[50:06] wanted to destroy Israelites, praise be
[50:08] TO GOD, THE BIBLE TELLS US MOSES, GOD
[50:12] TOLD MOSES, "STEP ASIDE AND I SHOW
[50:15] THEM." AMEN.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; But Moses stood in the gap. Hallelujah.
[50:22] and say that God what WILL THE HEATHEN
[50:25] NATION SAY THAT THEIR GOD WAS NOT EVEN
[50:28] ABLE TO TAKE THEM TO THE PROMISED LAND.
[50:31] Praise be to God.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; But God already he had already
[50:38] calculated the cost.
[50:41] That challenge was not only to the
[50:42] people of Israel but also to Moses. I
[50:46] believe that God wanted to see what will
[50:48] Moses do.
[50:50] Will Moses step aside and destroy them?
[50:53] Praise be to God. Amen. But still God
[50:57] knew that the way HE DESIGNED MOSES,
[51:00] MOSES would stood in the gap because HE
[51:03] WAS REPRESENTING CHRIST as well. AMEN.
[51:06] THAT FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE
[51:08] GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; When God wanted to destroy the world, he
[51:14] sent his son BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH LOVE.
[51:16] THOEVER BELIEVES in him. Amen.
[51:21] should not be perished. Blessed be the
[51:24] name of the Lord.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; So that SAME GOD WHO CALLED us in this
[51:29] generation,
[51:31] the message is not easy, brethren.
[51:34] The message is so hard. Praise be to
[51:37] God.
[51:39] But God knows that we are going to make
[51:41] it
[51:43] &gt;&gt; because the message does not give you
[51:45] even
[51:50] It will all tell you look unto Christ.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus. Amen. When trouble
[51:57] come, look away to Jesus. When you are
[52:00] going through tough time, look away to
[52:02] Jesus. When you are sick, look away to
[52:04] Jesus. Amen. When someone lives here,
[52:09] maybe uh it's money and you are broke.
[52:12] Look away to Jesus.
[52:14] Praise be to God. Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I remember a few just a few days ago
[52:21] I went to the shop
[52:24] in the morning.
[52:26] It was uh it was uh I think few weeks
[52:29] ago
[52:30] uh my wife had just given birth. We had
[52:34] spent everything that we had. So that
[52:37] morning uh I think I had I had something
[52:40] like 10,000. says I was going to shop
[52:44] then I found 70,000.
[52:47] Praise be to God.
[52:50] Ah and I was like just in front of the
[52:53] the shop. The shop attendant was inside
[52:58] and guess what would you do?
[53:02] Praise be to God. Ah that was the only
[53:06] thing I heard.
[53:08] So the devil started to preach to me.
[53:11] God has provided. And I was like, wait a
[53:14] minute.
[53:17] Yeah, God has provided. By the way, God
[53:20] answers prayer. Indeed, I prayed, but
[53:23] that was not the answer.
[53:25] Praise be to God. So I I picked the
[53:28] money and I told the the lady there that
[53:31] by the you have dropped here your money.
[53:33] Say no but it's not my money.
[53:37] said but it's okay. So she uh there was
[53:41] a yogurt guy he had come to supply her.
[53:45] So I think in the process of uh maybe
[53:47] putting the money or moving the change
[53:50] it was the money for the guy and the guy
[53:52] also did not know that dropped the
[53:54] money.
[53:56] So he said she said okay then he called
[54:00] the guy by the way have you okay I'm not
[54:02] sure whether it was the guy's money
[54:05] because you see when I have a note even
[54:07] if it is 1 million or 500,000 I know all
[54:09] the denomination of my money but
[54:14] uh somehow maybe it was for that
[54:15] gentleman
[54:19] but you know at first when I saw it
[54:24] honestly I'm not one person who steps on
[54:26] the money. Let me give you this
[54:28] testimony. One time I was very sick and
[54:30] I was from a site and I did not have
[54:32] money. I said God it was my I think I
[54:35] was suffering from malaria alongside
[54:38] when I was walking after believing God.
[54:41] I saw some notes flying in the wind
[54:45] because
[54:48] see God has provided for sure that one I
[54:51] believe it was God.
[54:54] Ask me why people were up moving border
[54:56] borders and they are not seeing the
[54:58] money. So I picked it gently like my
[55:01] money
[55:03] and guess what it was exact
[55:07] because I went to the immediate I went
[55:09] to the pharmacy bought the drug side
[55:12] with I think I'm not for buying milk.
[55:15] So that one I believed it was God
[55:18] because nobody was concerned. I think
[55:19] they also thought that maybe I had
[55:21] dropped my money. I was picking my
[55:23] money. It was just on the road. But this
[55:25] time around, the devil knew that if I
[55:28] trick this gentleman, he's not going to
[55:31] overcome that. But I thank God. Praise
[55:34] be to God.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. First of all,
[55:40] but the prophet SAY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE
[55:42] SECOND THOUGHT, do not do it.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And that's how I overcame that snare.
[55:50] And just a few days I think like
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; So we are designed the way God designed
[56:00] us. He knows very well brethren that we
[56:03] are more than able to overcome. Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that WE ARE DESIGNED
[56:10] THAT IS NOT THE END OF YOU BECAUSE EVEN
[56:13] WHEN WE ARE IN SCHOOL WHEN WE ARE BEATEN
[56:16] WHEN THE PAPER DEFEATS YOU YOU DO
[56:18] CORRECTION YOU TRY AGAIN AGAIN until you
[56:21] overcome that. Praise be to God. And let
[56:24] US USE THE SAME SAME TACTICS. PRAISE the
[56:27] Lord. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE DEVIL
[56:29] WANT.
[56:32] HE USES the condition around us to
[56:35] DETERMINE WHO WE ARE. PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE LEARNED, AMEN. TO LIFT UP MY
[56:42] EYES AND LOOK AT GOD.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF MY
[56:49] GOD.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Sometime the devil shows us how small we
[56:57] are.
[57:01] But when I START SINGING BIGGER THAN all
[57:03] my problem is bigger than anything.
[57:06] PRAISE BE TO GOD. SOMETIME WHEN I'M
[57:09] WALKING AND I'M OVERWHELMED BY THOUGHT
[57:11] THAT IS THE SONG THAT I SING IS BIGGER
[57:14] THAN ALL MY QUESTIONS.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; AND MANY TIME YOU HAVE A LOT OF
[57:22] QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS. Praise the
[57:25] Lord.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:28] But God
[57:31] is the only one who is responsible.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us.
[57:39] Brother, sometime
[57:41] many time you you find you are somewhere
[57:46] where you can you you will even hardly
[57:49] utter the name of Jesus. But even in
[57:52] that situation, something inside your
[57:55] HEART TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE MORE than
[57:58] overcomer.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what has kept us going.
[58:03] Praise be to God.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; When things are not moving, brother says
[58:08] THAT WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
[58:10] AND YOU FIND IS HARD, THAT IS THE RIGHT
[58:13] TIME OF DOING IT.
[58:15] WHEN YOU TRY TO PRAY AND EVEN WORDS ARE
[58:18] NOT COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, BROTHER,
[58:20] THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME to pray.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So he told Jeremiah before
[58:30] even you were formed in your mother's
[58:32] womb, I knew you.
[58:36] I called you. I ordained you.
[58:42] BEFORE THE MINISTERS LAY THEIR HANDS ON
[58:44] YOU FOR ORDINATION, GOD ALREADY
[58:46] SANCTIONED IT. Praise be to God. Before
[58:49] David became the king, GOD ALREADY HAD
[58:52] sanctioned it. AMEN. SAMUEL WAS JUST
[58:55] FULFILLING THAT.
[58:58] Praise the Lord.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; That's why when David saw Goliath,
[59:04] Goliath never knew the secret in David.
[59:07] Amen. David was designed THAT WAY THAT
[59:10] ONE DAY, PRAISE the Lord, I believe
[59:13] before DAVID WAS BORN, THE LORD DECLARED
[59:16] IT UPON DAVID AND SAY THAT ONE DAY YOU
[59:19] ARE GOING TO SLAY A GIANT.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:33] And maybe even David never knew that.
[59:36] But something was in him. THERE WAS
[59:38] SOMETHING DRIVING HIM IN. AMEN.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; You remember Hebrew mothers when they
[59:46] were giving birth, the Bible tells us
[59:49] they speak
[59:52] Hallelujah.
[59:58] phobia.
[1:00:02] Hallelujah. So, brethren, I'm here to
[1:00:05] tell you
[1:00:08] that
[1:00:10] we are built upon the rock.
[1:00:15] Amen.
[1:00:17] And we cannot be moved.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; And that rock is called Jesus Christ.
[1:00:27] Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; The word which was tested. Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] The word which cannot be defeated.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in Matthew 7:24.
[1:00:41] Whosoever hears this word.
[1:00:44] Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] AND DOETH IT IS AS a man
[1:00:52] who build his house upon the rock.
[1:00:56] Hallelujah. And that rock is Christ.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; When we hear this word and do it,
[1:01:04] we are building our house upon the rock.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; And there's no way we can be overcome.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] Nothing can shake US BECAUSE OUR
[1:01:19] BUILDING is built on the word.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Many time we are not victorious.
[1:01:27] IT'S BECAUSE AS WE ARE move
[1:01:35] but God want us to keep walking. Amen.
[1:01:39] Keep moving on to keep pressing on.
[1:01:42] Praise be TO GOD. ONE TIME I PREACH a
[1:01:45] sermon here uh which I call it that we
[1:01:48] are pressurized to STAND NO MATTER WHAT
[1:01:52] comes our way. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE
[1:01:55] PRESSURIZED TO STAND. There's nothing
[1:01:58] that can PUT US DOWN. THERE'S NOTHING
[1:02:00] THAT CAN CHALLENGE US BECAUSE THE ONE
[1:02:03] WHO WENT AHEAD OF US, THE ONE WHO WENT
[1:02:06] BEFORE US, HALLELUJAH, IT TOOK BITTER
[1:02:10] CUP. HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:12] AMEN.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; JESUS CARRIED THE BIGGER part of IT
[1:02:17] UNTIL TIME CAME AND HE THOUGHT if it was
[1:02:20] possible to dodge it. Hallelujah. BUT
[1:02:23] WHEN HE LOOKED AT US,
[1:02:27] he say, "Let me face the cross."
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:49] Brother Bonam in this message uh message
[1:02:52] of show the father and safias he says
[1:02:56] that that is how you see that god that's
[1:02:59] how you see god is when you get inside
[1:03:03] when you get inside of you let him look
[1:03:07] through your eyes and that is how you
[1:03:10] will work for God when God can use your
[1:03:14] hands amen your feet
[1:03:18] your lips
[1:03:20] Use your tongue,
[1:03:22] use your ears, and use your eyes. God is
[1:03:28] in you. See God on the outside.
[1:03:35] So uh in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 26 it
[1:03:39] say that for you see you are calling
[1:03:41] brethren HOW THAT NOT MANY WISE men
[1:03:46] after the after the flesh not many
[1:03:49] mighty not many noble are called. BUT
[1:03:53] GOD HAS CHOSEN THE foolish things of the
[1:03:57] world to confound the wise. AND GOD HAS
[1:04:01] CHOSEN the weak things of the world to
[1:04:04] confound the things that are mighty.
[1:04:09] Praise be to God.
[1:04:12] God has chos.
[1:04:19] Amen. Are you seeing how we are designed
[1:04:22] by the world? We look like we look like
[1:04:24] foolish
[1:04:26] and very weak.
[1:04:30] The character of the weak person is he
[1:04:33] can't even fight back.
[1:04:35] Someone comes and slaps and say God
[1:04:37] bless you. Why? Because you are weak.
[1:04:41] Hallelujah.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; SOMETIME WE ARE HARASSED
[1:04:49] even by our neighbors. But you don't
[1:04:52] fight back because brother you are weak
[1:04:54] things of the world.
[1:04:57] Praise be to God.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; But it's because the battle is not ours.
[1:05:02] You see, God has chosen the weak things
[1:05:04] of the world to confound the things that
[1:05:06] are mighty and best things of the world
[1:05:09] and the things which are despised. Hath
[1:05:12] God chosen? Yeah. And things which are
[1:05:15] not to bring to not things THAT ARE THAT
[1:05:20] NO flesh should glory in his presence.
[1:05:26] Praise be to God.
[1:05:29] Everything is about God doing it.
[1:05:35] The way we are, that's how he made us.
[1:05:38] We are different from ONE ANOTHER. BUT
[1:05:41] EACH one of us, we are designed to
[1:05:44] overcome.
[1:05:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, each one of us
[1:05:54] will overcome.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We already overcoming. PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:05:59] EVERY DAY WE ARE overcoming something.
[1:06:02] AND WE ARE moving unto perfection.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; You are not what you used to be or WHAT
[1:06:08] YOU WERE YESTERDAY,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; BUT every single day we are moving
[1:06:13] toward perfection.
[1:06:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; So we should always tell the devil, make
[1:06:23] the devil know that we are overcomers.
[1:06:27] We are designed to overcome.
[1:06:31] Praise be to God. He said, "I NOTICED
[1:06:33] THAT IT TAKES THE WEAKEST and the
[1:06:36] rejected AND PRACTICALLY EVERY HERO GOD
[1:06:40] EVER HAD ON THE FRONT line was the type
[1:06:43] of that person, the type of a person.
[1:06:47] Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] No matter
[1:06:58] what we are facing,
[1:07:01] I am designed to overcome.
[1:07:06] Sometime the mountain seems to be
[1:07:08] bigger. Praise be to God. But we are
[1:07:11] bigger than it.
[1:07:13] Right now we have a lot before us. Amen.
[1:07:16] But I'm here to tell you if you press
[1:07:19] on, IF YOU MOVE ON believing God, AMEN.
[1:07:24] AND WAITING ON GOD IS PROMISES.
[1:07:26] HALLELUJAH. WE ARE GOING TO OVERCOME
[1:07:30] BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; THE COUNTRY WHERE WE CAME FROM IS OF
[1:07:36] OVERCOMERS
[1:07:38] IS THE COUNTRY OF POSSIBILITY.
[1:07:42] IT IS POSSIBLE. I WILL MAKE IT. I'M
[1:07:45] GOING THROUGH. I'M MANEUVERING THROUGH.
[1:07:48] PRAISE BE TO GOD. THERE IS NO
[1:07:50] NEGATIVITY. THERE IS NO DEFEAT THE OTHER
[1:07:53] SIDE. AMEN.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; And those are the principles that is
[1:07:59] keeping us going.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Because the Lord proclaimed it. HE
[1:08:05] DECLARED IT BEFORE EVEN WE ARE BORN THAT
[1:08:08] WE are going to make it.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That we are going
[1:08:12] through. Hallelujah.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's why you have
[1:08:20] bared.
[1:08:23] You've been under several sermons
[1:08:26] sometime
[1:08:31] but you have not given up because you
[1:08:34] are designed that way.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. EVERY SERMON FITS
[1:08:39] SOMETHING IN US.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS BUILDING a building.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Every minister COMES WITH A STONE. THE
[1:08:49] OTHER ONE COMES with motor. This one
[1:08:52] comes with this. Praise be TO GOD.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS WORKING ON THAT BUILDING.
[1:09:00] He's fitting us in our right places.
[1:09:06] Just allow the Holy Ghost to work in
[1:09:09] you. Let the Holy Spirit work in us. LET
[1:09:13] HIM TIGHTEN those loose ends.
[1:09:18] SOMETIME PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEY ARE
[1:09:19] CHRISTIANS.
[1:09:21] THEN THEY BECOME SO LOOSE AND TOO LOW.
[1:09:25] PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, THAT IS not what you are.
[1:09:30] GOD CALLED US TO BE BETTER than that.
[1:09:36] We are the masterpiece of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:09:54] I'll make thee a new sharp threshing
[1:09:58] instrument having teeth and thou shalt

[1:10:11] want a scripture in Judges can we go
[1:10:13] there.
[1:10:16] Judges chapter 6.
[1:10:18] I want to see something here.
[1:10:22] Judges chapter 6 11.
[1:10:30] And there came an angel of the Lord and
[1:10:34] sat under an oak
[1:10:38] and an oak which was in
[1:10:42] opera
[1:10:44] that pertain unto Josh and Abisite. And
[1:10:50] his son Gideon
[1:10:52] threshed uh threshed wheat by the wine
[1:10:56] press to hide it from the Midionite. And
[1:11:00] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him,
[1:11:03] and said unto him, The Lord is with
[1:11:06] thee, thou mighty man of valor. And Gon
[1:11:10] said unto HIM, "OH MY GOD, IF THE LORD
[1:11:12] IS WITH US,
[1:11:15] why then is all this befallen us?
[1:11:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord." This a
[1:11:21] mighty man. But he had forgotten who he
[1:11:25] was. AND HERE COMES the angel to remind
[1:11:29] him of who he was.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:11:36] HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE WHAT HE HAD.
[1:11:38] PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN HE HAD the
[1:11:40] Midionite had come, praise the Lord. He
[1:11:44] started to hide.
[1:11:47] But the angel reminded him that man, you
[1:11:49] are mighty man of valor.
[1:11:53] You are designed to overcome these guys.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; HE WAS PRAISE BE TO GOD. GOD HAD TO SEND
[1:12:01] AN ANGEL TO REMIND HIM OF WHO he was.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS GOD WILL SEND AN ANGEL. PRAISE
[1:12:11] THE LORD. TO REMIND THE CHURCH OF WHO
[1:12:15] THEY ARE.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In this generation we
[1:12:20] are living in, WE THOUGHT WE WERE LIKE
[1:12:23] OTHER DENOMINATION,
[1:12:25] OTHER ORGANIZATION. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT
[1:12:28] GOD SENT AN ANGEL IN THIS GENERATION TO
[1:12:32] REMIND US OF WHO WE ARE.
[1:12:37] Blessed be the NAME OF THE LORD. WHEN we
[1:12:39] denomination,
[1:12:41] we even we used to be challenged and you
[1:12:43] hide. You don't even want to see that
[1:12:46] you are Christian.
[1:12:48] We thought it was a shame to be a
[1:12:50] Christian. AMEN. WE THOUGHT WE ARE LIKE
[1:12:54] OTHERS, BRETHREN.
[1:12:56] AMEN. BUT IN THIS GENERATION, PRAISE THE
[1:13:00] LORD, WHEN GOD SAW THAT THAT WE WERE
[1:13:04] DESIGNED TO OVERCOME THIS GENERATION, HE
[1:13:07] HAD TO SEND AN ANGEL TO REMIND US OF who
[1:13:09] we are.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; We are just like Gideon. We are just
[1:13:14] like him. When the enemy comes, we hide.
[1:13:17] Praise the Lord. The same thing happened
[1:13:20] when the Israel in the BATTLE AND WHEN
[1:13:22] DAVID WENT THERE. AMEN. AND GOLIATH ROSE
[1:13:27] AND THESE guys
[1:13:29] hid themselves.
[1:13:31] Praise be to God. And the young man
[1:13:36] who had meet an ANGEL
[1:13:39] WHO HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. HE HAD
[1:13:42] THE BEAR EXPERIENCE AND THE LION
[1:13:44] EXPERIENCE. PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN HE HAD
[1:13:47] SOME WEIRD WEIRD SOUND,
[1:13:50] SAY, "What is that thing nagging me?"
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:14:13] Praise be to God. But this man knew what
[1:14:16] the young man knew what he was talking
[1:14:17] about. HE HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS
[1:14:21] UNDISPUTED.
[1:14:23] IT WAS UNCHALLENGEABLE. PRAISE BE TO
[1:14:25] GOD. AND DAVID KNEW FROM THE FIRST
[1:14:28] EXPERIENCE THAT I AM DESIGNED TO
[1:14:31] OVERCOME.
[1:14:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; THE SECOND EXPERIENCE, IT WAS THE
[1:14:38] CONFIRMATION OF THE FIRST ONE. PRAISE BE
[1:14:40] TO GOD. GOD WAS NOT PREPARING DAVID TO
[1:14:44] SLAY THE BEAR AND THE LION, BUT GOD WAS
[1:14:48] PREPARING HIM TO SLAY GOLIATH.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. THE BEAR WAS NOT THE
[1:14:55] PROBLEM OF ISRAELITE. THE LION WAS NOT
[1:14:58] THE PROBLEM OF THE ISRAELITE. BUT
[1:15:00] GOLIATH WAS THE PROBLEM.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; And what was the problem OF THE CHURCH?
[1:15:06] IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; PRAISE be to God.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] BUT GOD HAD PREPARED somebody
[1:15:19] and David WAS COMING TO FACE THE
[1:15:21] CHALLENGE BECAUSE DAVID HAD AN
[1:15:24] EXPERIENCE with God. HE KNEW WHERE HE
[1:15:26] WAS STANDING. HE KNEW THE GOD OF ISRAEL.
[1:15:30] HE KNEW THAT UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE
[1:15:33] COULD NOT CHALLENGE, COULD NOT DEFY THE
[1:15:36] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AND OUR
[1:15:38] PROPHET TELLS US, AMEN.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE CHURCH WILL PUT OUT THE FEAR.
[1:15:44] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT SCARE WILL GET OUT OF
[1:15:49] THE CHURCH.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WAS AFFECTING the church
[1:15:55] of Israelites.
[1:15:57] They forgot that God was their king,
[1:16:01] that God was their fighter. God gave
[1:16:04] THEM A PROMISE AND HE TOLD THAT ONE OF
[1:16:06] YOU, ONE MAN WILL CHASE A THOUSAND.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; One man chasing a thousand people.
[1:16:18] ONE SAMSON. AMEN. AMEN.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; BUT HERE
[1:16:24] THOUSAND men hiding.
[1:16:27] Why? It was because of the unbelief.
[1:16:32] And said that your unbelief will not
[1:16:35] hinder God.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; AND LET US NOT STAND ON SOMEBODY'S WAY.
[1:16:44] If you CAN'T BELIEVE FOR YOUR HEALING,
[1:16:46] THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN BELIEVE FOR HIS
[1:16:48] HEALING.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; DO NOT STAND ON HIS WAY. AMEN.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE FOR YOUR VICTORY
[1:16:55] THAT YOU CAN OVERCOME FORNICATION, YOU
[1:16:57] CAN OVERCOME ADULTERY, YOU CAN OVERCOME
[1:16:59] THIS AND THAT, THERE IS SOMEBODY
[1:17:01] BELIEVING BROTHER, SISTER, THERE ARE MEN
[1:17:04] WHO ARE DESIGNED BY GOD. THERE ARE MEN
[1:17:06] WHO ARE ENGINEERED BY GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:09] THERE ARE MEN HAVE MET GOD. PRAISE BE TO
[1:17:12] GOD. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING
[1:17:15] ABOUT. THEY KNOW THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAD
[1:17:17] WITH GOD. THEY KNOW THAT WITH GOD ALL
[1:17:21] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. NOT JUST SOME
[1:17:24] THINGS BUT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[1:17:26] BECAUSE THEY TESTED AND I SEE HOW THAT
[1:17:29] GOD IS GRACIOUS.
[1:17:32] Blessed be the name of the Lord. AND GOD
[1:17:36] TODAY IS BUILDING THE SAME SAME TEMPLE.
[1:17:40] HALLELUJAH. Is working through it.
[1:17:44] IS TYING THE loose connections.
[1:17:47] PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT IS THE GOD WE ARE
[1:17:50] SERVING. EVEN WHEN YOU ARE BEATEN DOWN,
[1:17:52] BROTHER, THERE ARE JUST SOME loopholes
[1:17:55] somewhere. There are SOME LOOSE
[1:17:57] CONNECTION SOMEWHERE. COME TO THE ALTAR.
[1:18:01] COME TO THE ALTAR. LET THE HOLY GHOST
[1:18:05] WORK ON THOSE LOOSE ENDS. LET THE HOLY
[1:18:07] GHOST TIGHTEN THOSE LOOSE ENDS. PRAISE
[1:18:11] BE TO GOD. AND YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR LIKE
[1:18:13] A FIRE WITH A DEVIL.
[1:18:16] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; SO THAT GOD was still with them.
[1:18:28] But God was not where they baptizing
[1:18:30] kids.
[1:18:32] He was a backsliden preacher. We can say
[1:18:34] that. Praise be to God. And that's why
[1:18:37] when David was going when he was ready
[1:18:39] to face Goliath, he told him, "Son, you
[1:18:42] cannot manage that guy. You go with
[1:18:45] this. Go with this bachelor in theology.
[1:18:51] Go with this catechasm
[1:18:53] baptism of babies.
[1:18:57] Go with this holy water.
[1:19:00] At least you sprink it around and first
[1:19:01] jump jump there before you go.
[1:19:04] Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; David tried it, brother. When he tried
[1:19:09] to lift his the man's spear alone was
[1:19:12] ALSO HEAVY. THE ELEMENT. Praise be to
[1:19:15] God.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; THINGS WERE HEAVY FOR DAVID. PRAISE BE
[1:19:21] TO GOD. I BELIEVE THIS GUY REMEMBERED.
[1:19:25] THE YOUNG ONE REMEMBERED, "LAY ASIDE
[1:19:27] EVERY WEIGHT AND EVERY SIN THAT IS BESET
[1:19:30] YOU AND RUN WITH PATIENCE." PRAISE BE TO
[1:19:34] GOD. HE REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE WAS LAYING
[1:19:36] THE LION, he never used even a sword.
[1:19:42] And in that conversation, maybe the king
[1:19:45] asked him, "How are you going to do it?"
[1:19:47] Then he asked the the king, "Have you
[1:19:50] ever slayed a lion?" Say, "There's no
[1:19:53] one who can slay a lion."
[1:19:56] Okay. How about a bear?
[1:20:00] When a bear stands with, "Do you know
[1:20:02] what you're talking about?"
[1:20:05] Maybe he had never even seen it. Praise
[1:20:08] be to God.
[1:20:12] David knew that oh this where the
[1:20:15] problem is
[1:20:17] that you can't cast Satan in father son
[1:20:21] and the holy ghost
[1:20:23] said okay king just watch and see what
[1:20:27] is the price you are giving
[1:20:30] praise be to god
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PRICE YOU ARE GIVING brother
[1:20:36] you only leave
[1:20:41] and the king said maybe let's try and
[1:20:42] see.
[1:20:48] I believe inside the king's heart in
[1:20:51] that yeah there is something unique
[1:20:52] about this person.
[1:20:55] That's why we need that experience
[1:20:59] to have that time alone with God.
[1:21:02] Praise be to God. WHEN WE COME OUT
[1:21:06] EVERYBODY WILL SAY indeed there is
[1:21:08] something unique about that brother
[1:21:10] about that sister because we are
[1:21:12] designed that way brethren that's what
[1:21:15] we are
[1:21:18] the devil makes us to believe of what we
[1:21:21] are not
[1:21:23] we looked at ourself as miners
[1:21:26] brother that's not what we are praise be
[1:21:29] to god
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; before we were BORN GOD PROPHESIED SIDE
[1:21:34] OVER OUR LIVES.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Before we came in THIS WORLD, GOD SAID
[1:21:40] SOMETHING.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; SEE THAT ONE IS OVERCOMER. THAT ONE IS A
[1:21:48] PREACHER. THIS ONE IS A SONG LEADER.
[1:21:51] THIS ONE IS A PIANIST. PRAISE BE TO GOD.
[1:21:55] IT WAS PROCLAIMED OVER YOU BEFORE EVEN
[1:21:58] YOU WERE BORN, BROTHER, SISTER.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:04] So let us not allow the enemy to play
[1:22:08] with our mind. Blessed be the name of
[1:22:10] the Lord. Gideon, he never even knew
[1:22:13] that he was an overcomer. He was a
[1:22:16] mighty man of valor.
[1:22:19] But God sent an angel. And in the days
[1:22:23] of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; God sent us an angel in this generation.
[1:22:29] Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; And he has helped us to know
[1:22:36] who we ARE
[1:22:39] THAT WE are even GREATER THAN ANGELS
[1:22:42] BECAUSE HE TELLS US THAT ANGELS ARE
[1:22:44] SERVANT BUT WE ARE SONS OF GOD.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE BRIDE AND HE SAID I NO LONGER
[1:22:50] CALL YOU MY FRIEND.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; HE HAS REVEALED US THAT WE ARE MISS
[1:22:56] JESUS.
[1:22:59] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST,
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; WE CAME OUT OF HIS RIB.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THAT ANGEL, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[1:23:10] KNOW WHEN JESUS WAS HANGED ON THE CROSS,
[1:23:14] we were with him.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; When he went TO THE GRAVE, BROTHER,
[1:23:19] SISTER, WE WENT WITH HIM.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE ARE
[1:23:25] DESIGNED.
[1:23:26] WHEN HE WENT TO HELL, WE WENT WITH HIM.
[1:23:29] WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HELL, WE CAME
[1:23:32] OUT WITH HIM.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; That is our blueprint. That is our
[1:23:38] design.
[1:23:40] Praise be to God. And that's why we are
[1:23:43] going to reign with him.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; How do we know about those things? Bible
[1:23:54] time. That's what God has always been
[1:23:56] doing.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; When they encourage, send somebody to in
[1:24:01] when they're discouraged to encourage
[1:24:03] them. Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:24:06] Jesus Christ.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; You know, a soldier who has never been
[1:24:11] in a battle
[1:24:13] doesn't know what
[1:24:15] overcoming means.
[1:24:18] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:24:21] Do you know that when soldiers are going
[1:24:23] to war, they pack with them everything
[1:24:27] they're going to need in the battle?
[1:24:30] Huge backpack with a mattress with a
[1:24:33] water on the side, grenade, food,
[1:24:36] energetically modified food
[1:24:40] capsules.
[1:24:42] The devil copy from God.
[1:24:45] Do you know that some of those soldiers
[1:24:46] they don't have time to cook
[1:24:50] but they use science
[1:24:53] and they get those nutrients in the food
[1:24:57] and put it maybe in a capsule form. You
[1:25:01] just eat maybe you swallow a capsule
[1:25:03] like two and it is equivalent to a kg of
[1:25:07] kawonga and beanies
[1:25:11] because where you going there will be no
[1:25:12] time brother.
[1:25:20] I am that trouble
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; because that's what we are. If you
[1:25:26] thunder to the devil, we are trouble to
[1:25:27] the devil.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS DOING USING THE SAME mechanism
[1:25:33] to prepare his church.
[1:25:37] Every time you come, you are working on
[1:25:39] your military attire
[1:25:42] and the midter is the word OF GOD. WE
[1:25:45] ARE PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; ELEMENT OF SALVATION, THE SWORD OF THE
[1:25:53] SPIRIT. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND AMONG
[1:25:56] OTHERS.
[1:26:01] And the Bible tells us to be aware of
[1:26:03] his devices.
[1:26:06] Amen. Many time we forget
[1:26:10] who of us standing
[1:26:16] many time does not even use that because
[1:26:19] when the devil comes spiritually he's
[1:26:21] weak
[1:26:23] blessed be the name of the lord but when
[1:26:25] he get a vessel to work in that's where
[1:26:28] he can also display his power
[1:26:32] so when he had golth that was a good a
[1:26:35] good vessel
[1:26:36] In fact that was unique vessel prepared
[1:26:39] six I think he had six six fingers
[1:26:44] praise be to God
[1:26:46] was very tall
[1:26:50] his spear alone carried by men's
[1:26:53] not one not two
[1:27:03] he has to scare you by the time You
[1:27:05] fight already. There is even no life out
[1:27:08] of you, inside you. Praise be to God.
[1:27:14] But thanks God that he has given us the
[1:27:16] word.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; When the devil attacked Jesus said, "It
[1:27:19] is written." Amen.
[1:27:24] You see the world, they are not ashamed
[1:27:26] of who they are. Do you know that?
[1:27:30] You believe that? They're not ashamed.
[1:27:35] Someone wakes up and tells you this is
[1:27:37] who I am.
[1:27:44] This illame women they don't fear to say
[1:27:48] who they are.
[1:27:51] BUT SOMETIME MANY TIME CHRISTIAN THEY
[1:27:53] ARE scared
[1:27:56] even to tell the world of who they are.
[1:27:59] Praise be to God. That's why
[1:28:03] we need to get that experience with God.
[1:28:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:28:11] because the king couldn't hardly
[1:28:14] convince
[1:28:15] David that something happened in the
[1:28:18] wilderness. He was alone when he was
[1:28:20] slaying the bear. He was alone with God.
[1:28:25] He was not there with his brothers, with
[1:28:26] his father, with the king. He was there
[1:28:30] alone. You are going to meet God alone.
[1:28:33] No.
[1:28:38] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:28:41] And that's what each one of us need.
[1:28:44] If we don't meet God,
[1:28:49] we're not going to make it.
[1:28:52] Every single day, the way is getting
[1:28:54] narrow and narrow.
[1:28:58] Life is getting hard and hard
[1:29:01] outside Christ.
[1:29:05] So meaning as far as life is getting
[1:29:08] hard outside
[1:29:10] believer,
[1:29:12] we also ought to be fighting to enter in
[1:29:17] because that's the only refuge.
[1:29:20] The present hope in time of trouble.
[1:29:25] The earth is already experiencing
[1:29:27] undergoing another birth pain and we are
[1:29:30] in the time we are nearing the time of
[1:29:32] delivery.
[1:29:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we
[1:29:36] ought to run to Christ because that's
[1:29:38] the only place of safety.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm just here to REMIND YOU THAT WE
[1:29:42] ARE DESIGNED TO OVERCOME. WE ARE
[1:29:44] DESIGNED TO be there.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It is very very possible.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And that's where God want us TO BE. HE
[1:29:52] WANT US TO BE ON THE WINNING SIDE.
[1:29:56] THAT'S WHY I WANT THE CHURCH TO BE ON
[1:29:58] THE FIERY side
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; where men and WOMEN ARE SEEKING GOD
[1:30:04] NIGHT AND DAY.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; WHERE WE ARE NOT settling for less.
[1:30:11] Praise the Lord. WHERE WE SAY ALL THINGS
[1:30:15] ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; If I TRY AND I DON'T GET TOMORROW, I
[1:30:20] will come back.
[1:30:24] EVEN IF I DIE, WHEN I'VE NOT GOT IT,
[1:30:27] EVEN WHERE I'M GOING, AS LONG AS THERE
[1:30:29] is life there, I will still keep trying.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. BECAUSE WHEN GOD gives
[1:30:36] his word, his word will never fail.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; IT MAY TAKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS, but it
[1:30:44] will come to pass.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; As long as has come out OF HIS MOUTH,
[1:30:49] GOD TRIED THIS WORD BEFORE even he gave
[1:30:51] it to man.
[1:30:54] Praise be to God. And he TRUST THAT THIS
[1:30:56] THE ONLY thing that can work for us.
[1:31:01] And we are here today. It's up to us to
[1:31:03] believe or to leave it there. Blessed be
[1:31:08] the name of the Lord.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; But God, he has done his part.
[1:31:14] And the prophet say that if
[1:31:19] you can get that scare out of the church
[1:31:23] out of a believer
[1:31:26] there is that portion of
[1:31:30] it doesn't work.
[1:31:33] Will we make it to our land?
[1:31:39] The three months have elapsed.
[1:31:45] Praise be to God.
[1:31:55] The speed which God gave to to
[1:31:58] that is the maximum speed for it.
[1:32:02] But who tells that a tortoise that does
[1:32:05] not reach its destination?
[1:32:08] Praise be to God.
[1:32:11] Even in our nature, some of us we are
[1:32:13] taller than others.
[1:32:16] But when you're going to Charala,
[1:32:18] the difference is just in the steps we
[1:32:21] are taking. But each of each one of us
[1:32:25] will reach the destination.
[1:32:27] Praise be to God. So brethren,
[1:32:31] we are not too late.
[1:32:34] But according the way God designed us,
[1:32:37] we are on the right track and we are
[1:32:44] is
[1:32:47] that nothing can stop us.
[1:32:52] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:56] Amen.
[1:32:59] Shall we stand on our feet tonight?
[1:33:09] Precious Lord Jesus,
[1:33:12] Father, we want to thank
[1:33:17] you given us to hear from your throne.
[1:33:23] You told us in your holy word that we
[1:33:26] conffort one another with these words.
[1:33:31] Lord Jesus,
[1:33:36] your word has been preached
[1:33:39] and you're reminding us
[1:33:42] of who we are.
[1:33:45] I just want to thank you for this
[1:33:46] moment.
[1:33:48] I pray that may the Holy Spirit
[1:33:51] visit each one of us. Lord,
[1:33:55] as you say, the sacred things belongs to
[1:33:58] you. But those which are revealed, they
[1:34:01] are ours and for our children.
[1:34:05] When it was revealed to Gideon,
[1:34:09] you had to make sure that
[1:34:13] he went and listened to the conversation
[1:34:15] between the million.
[1:34:18] one giving the dream and the other one
[1:34:21] interpreting.
[1:34:23] The enemy is dreaming and interpreting
[1:34:26] when your servant was listening.
[1:34:30] Precious Lord,
[1:34:33] we know that we're living the time.
[1:34:37] Remember Apostle Paul writing Timothy
[1:34:40] and told him that Timothy
[1:34:43] in last days or later days preious time
[1:34:47] will come.
[1:34:50] And that's the time we are living in
[1:34:51] Lord Jesus. We are seeing a lot of
[1:34:54] things happening Lord. But he told us
[1:34:57] that when we see this, we ought to look
[1:35:00] up for our redemption draws nearer.
[1:35:03] And we know that our salvation
[1:35:06] is closer than when we had just
[1:35:08] believed.
[1:35:10] Precious Lord,
[1:35:12] and you clear the way for us, Lord
[1:35:14] Jesus. We just pray that we release your
[1:35:17] anointing this evening and break every
[1:35:20] yoke.
[1:35:22] Speak to those
[1:35:25] who are streaming this service.
[1:35:50] As we pray for the offerings, we'll also
[1:35:53] remember to pray for sister Patricia.
[1:35:56] Uh she's in the hospital
[1:35:59] attending to her brother who has cancer.
[1:36:03] So we remember her in prayer. We praise
[1:36:06] the Lord. Oh dear gracious heavenly
[1:36:08] father, pray for the tithan offerings.
[1:36:11] Father, Lord, I pray Lord Jesus. So my
[1:36:14] God that tonight you'll bless every
[1:36:17] giver Lord the Father has given in thine
[1:36:19] house. Lord, I pray, Father, that you
[1:36:22] bless bless the labor of their hands,
[1:36:26] Father. Lord Jesus, bless all that they
[1:36:28] have. And Lord Jesus, fulfill the
[1:36:31] desires of their hearts, Father, Lord,
[1:36:34] in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, and
[1:36:36] this evening, Father, we remember Sister
[1:36:39] Patricia, Lord, Father, who is not with
[1:36:41] us here today. Remember her in prayers,
[1:36:43] Father, Lord Jesus, as she is at the
[1:36:46] hospital, Lord. We pray, Father, that
[1:36:48] you remember her, Lord. Reach down your
[1:36:51] mighty hand, your healing hand, Father,
[1:36:53] and touch the sick, Lord, and heal him.
[1:36:55] Oh, Father, you're the healer, Lord
[1:36:57] Jesus, of every disease, Father. Even
[1:37:00] heal cancer, Lord. Cancer can stand in
[1:37:03] your presence, can stand before you,
[1:37:04] Father. And now we speak thy word, Lord
[1:37:08] Jesus, that thy word will heal him, oh,
[1:37:10] Father, and Lord Jesus will comfort our
[1:37:13] sister, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ, we pray and believe.
[1:37:17] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. So,
[1:37:21] uh, give the Lord a hand clap of praise
[1:37:23] this evening.
[1:37:26] Amen. Have we been blessed this evening?
[1:37:30] Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] So, we thank God for brother Martin.
[1:37:35] Amen. Before we go, I just wanted to

[1:37:52] word of God. Amen.
[1:37:55] Is that amen?
[1:37:57] Hallelujah.
