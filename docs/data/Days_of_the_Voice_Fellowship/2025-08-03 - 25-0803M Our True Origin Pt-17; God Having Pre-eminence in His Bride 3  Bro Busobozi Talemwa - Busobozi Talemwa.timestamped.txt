[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to greet each and
[1:11:00] every one of you in the name of our Lord
[1:11:01] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:04] Come to your neighbor, tell them welcome
[1:11:05] to the house.
[1:11:09] I see many are not here this morning
[1:11:13] but we are happy that he has given us
[1:11:15] life
[1:11:18] us to be in the house of God
[1:11:21] and among those who are not here.
[1:11:24] I just have a testimony
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; for one of the families.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; You know this morning somehow I just
[1:11:34] called uh brother Peter
[1:11:38] and he didn't pick up.
[1:11:40] Let let me tell you friend
[1:11:43] whenever your pastor called to pick up
[1:11:46] you do not know why he's calling.
[1:11:49] I also do not know why I was calling
[1:11:52] but I just called.
[1:11:55] and um he didn't pick up but then after
[1:11:58] about 30 minutes
[1:12:01] he called me back
[1:12:04] and um
[1:12:06] I was actually with brother when he
[1:12:08] called me
[1:12:11] and you know they they were packed up
[1:12:12] and ready to come to church
[1:12:16] and and um they they all was like going
[1:12:21] into the car. They put the children in
[1:12:26] you know, so he he he wanted to I think
[1:12:29] do something
[1:12:32] decided to step out
[1:12:35] and then um you know he also the sister
[1:12:38] you know sisters usually forget things.
[1:12:43] So she went to pick what she wanted
[1:12:48] leaving the children in.
[1:12:51] So one of the child disengaged the
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; disengaged the uh underbreak
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; and you know this is a huge gun
[1:13:02] and this I think is a slope
[1:13:06] I presume so because I'm I'm hearing
[1:13:08] where they live
[1:13:12] and so then off the car went
[1:13:17] with the children
[1:13:20] all the children inside
[1:13:22] and so you can imagine what can come out
[1:13:24] of such
[1:13:27] a huge catastrophe.
[1:13:30] So you couldn't talk. I called him. He
[1:13:31] couldn't talk.
[1:13:34] So the first thing I thought the
[1:13:35] children are gone.
[1:13:38] So I called him again. He couldn't talk.
[1:13:41] I was nervous. I called again.
[1:13:45] So the sister picked up the phone and um
[1:13:48] they told me, "Well, um the children all
[1:13:52] survived."
[1:13:55] And I think to me that's a huge
[1:13:57] testimony,
[1:14:00] before we talk about um
[1:14:03] before we begin passing judgments,
[1:14:08] let us thank God
[1:14:10] for what he has done.
[1:14:13] And uh I understand the car I mean like
[1:14:16] you know the car it's um almost the
[1:14:19] whole front is gone
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:23] but the children the door was open
[1:14:27] survived with only a few scratches on
[1:14:32] all glasses shattering
[1:14:35] that can only be God.
[1:14:39] And so when you do not see somebody in
[1:14:42] church, don't judge. Pray.
[1:14:47] Amen. We I'm so happy with that
[1:14:49] testimony.
[1:14:52] Amen. We have brother Simon from Chhati
[1:14:57] who's also visiting with us this
[1:14:58] morning.
[1:15:00] I have you by the show of heart
[1:15:03] right over here. God bless you.
[1:15:06] Also yesterday we were in Mitana.
[1:15:10] And um we were at a wedding,
[1:15:13] a brother called Eager.
[1:15:16] I had to go. I those of you who know me,
[1:15:19] I rarely go to weddings
[1:15:22] and and so but this one I had to go. I
[1:15:25] just
[1:15:27] I remember there was a time when myself,
[1:15:30] brother Martin
[1:15:33] and brother
[1:15:35] we are all sharing one bed.
[1:15:39] Not because we wanted because we didn't
[1:15:40] have.
[1:15:42] And here is the part the bed was not
[1:15:44] ours.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It was of a brother who was a teacher
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; who was a teacher in a secondary school.
[1:15:54] A very nice brother called Grace
[1:15:57] and and so we were he was hosting us in
[1:16:00] his house
[1:16:02] so that we can be able to attend church.
[1:16:05] I mean like talk about talking about the
[1:16:06] love of the brethren.
[1:16:10] And so I mean I I remember those old
[1:16:12] memories. I was like no I have to go to
[1:16:14] this wedding.
[1:16:17] I was the youngest at the time.
[1:16:20] This I think brother was our senior
[1:16:22] right.
[1:16:24] So but it's not that he's the last two
[1:16:26] marries. I was like no.
[1:16:29] So sister ma I'm so sorry. I I I forgot
[1:16:32] about the appointment you know.
[1:16:35] We had an appointment to minister to his
[1:16:37] to her family.
[1:16:40] This wedding put everything out of my
[1:16:41] hand.
[1:16:43] So I'm really so sorry, sister.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this morning we have a very
[1:16:51] very special people in our midst.
[1:16:55] Very special to me and my wife.
[1:16:58] And uh I hope they will be special to
[1:16:59] you as well.
[1:17:02] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Um and I'd like to uh welcome them.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; One of them is not new to us.
[1:17:12] Sister um Emma Ephraim
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; from Awasa.
[1:17:19] Some people don't know you. If you don't
[1:17:21] mind to start
[1:17:24] God bless you. God bless you so much. We
[1:17:27] are happy to be with you and the little
[1:17:29] one with you as well.
[1:17:33] but within Uganda. Uganda,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; we're just so happy to have you this
[1:17:36] morning.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I heard from our husband
[1:17:43] told me that the family will be in
[1:17:44] Uganda.
[1:17:47] We are always happy to be with you.
[1:17:50] Amen.
[1:17:52] Um also this is the first time
[1:17:58] this sister comes here in the church.
[1:18:02] And uh we are going to have you speak. I
[1:18:04] hope you don't mind.
[1:18:08] Is that okay? Yeah. Yeah. It's okay.
[1:18:10] Should be okay.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; So her name is Sister Bethlehem.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Sister Bethlehem.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:18:17] would you mind coming?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's her first time in Uganda,
[1:18:24] her first time in the church here.
[1:18:28] And I'd like her to greet us.
[1:18:32] Can you get me get a another microphone?
[1:18:36] Any microphone.
[1:18:43] All right. Just greet us and tell us
[1:18:45] whatever you want to say.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; My name is Betty. I come from Ethiopia.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And this is my daughter husband.
[1:18:58] It's my first time in this church.
[1:19:02] I'm happy to see you.
[1:19:06] Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Now, one thing before she goes back,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; you've heard me tell this the testimony
[1:19:14] over and over and over.
[1:19:18] This these people are sincere believers
[1:19:21] of the messenger.
[1:19:25] How many know brother Ephraim?
[1:19:28] Oh, how many don't know brother Ira?
[1:19:32] Okay, so there are some people don't
[1:19:33] know brother. Brother Ephra is is is the
[1:19:37] husband of sister Emma
[1:19:40] and he has preached for us here before
[1:19:43] and brother Ephraim is uh one of really
[1:19:46] I should say my lovely son
[1:19:51] and um he's the one that I said when I
[1:19:54] when I we saw him first with my wife
[1:20:00] he will believe the message
[1:20:03] and he will be a preacher of it.
[1:20:05] And it turned out to be true after a few
[1:20:07] years.
[1:20:08] She's now a pastor of the message.
[1:20:11] And um so this sister
[1:20:14] Betty did not immediately believe the
[1:20:18] message
[1:20:20] despite the fact that the brother had
[1:20:21] believed.
[1:20:23] He just didn't want to follow anybody.
[1:20:26] He wanted to know and be sure it is the
[1:20:29] one.
[1:20:31] And this is typical of many Ethiopian
[1:20:33] brethren.
[1:20:35] And I think this is wonderful
[1:20:38] where you don't just follow blindly
[1:20:41] where you just believe after seeing that
[1:20:44] it is the word of God
[1:20:48] and you know she she finally received
[1:20:50] the message
[1:20:52] gave up many things and
[1:20:55] sacrificed many things.
[1:20:58] Sister Betty.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Sister Betty.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Of course, at the time when you gave up
[1:21:02] things, you did not know what God will
[1:21:05] give you in life.
[1:21:07] But later on, of course, he gave you a
[1:21:08] wonderful husband.
[1:21:11] Uh, so she's married. Please, please.
[1:21:15] So God later on gave you a wonderful
[1:21:17] husband, brother.
[1:21:20] And you know who later on also believed
[1:21:22] and finally they got married,
[1:21:25] wonderful children.
[1:21:28] Tell us.
[1:21:29] We always talk about you.
[1:21:32] Some people here already know about your
[1:21:34] name and know your testimony.
[1:21:37] What moved you to believe the message?
[1:21:41] And I'm sorry I never told you I will
[1:21:42] ask you this question.
[1:21:45] It's a wonderful testimony for
[1:21:50] Okay, it's a sudden question. hadn't
[1:21:52] prepared
[1:21:55] but I used to know the message when my
[1:21:57] father was alive. I I have seen the
[1:22:00] picture of Branam on some books.
[1:22:08] Yes. And uh another brother from another
[1:22:11] country used to even preach in the house
[1:22:13] but we were not as big.
[1:22:23] So after a long period of time,
[1:22:27] my brother meet with the pastor tal.
[1:22:32] So he believed the message.
[1:22:35] He usually tell us to go to the church
[1:22:39] to read.
[1:22:41] So I I started coming on and off because
[1:22:45] I thought at first it was too serious.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; So I I go sometimes I get offended and I
[1:22:56] stay
[1:23:00] but deep down I know that's true.
[1:23:05] So even when I go to the other church I
[1:23:08] I try to dress modestly because
[1:23:14] because something tells me it's not my
[1:23:17] place. I have been a lot of many church
[1:23:19] but
[1:23:25] I know something is wrong with me.
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; So when I come to this place
[1:23:35] I didn't like lift all my things like I
[1:23:38] didn't lift them suddenly but day by day
[1:23:42] just God took away some some things that
[1:23:44] I don't want in my life.
[1:23:52] May maybe some things I I was holding
[1:23:55] them like
[1:24:01] and God has put me in some like we call
[1:24:04] it desert
[1:24:09] and he has take taken all part of the
[1:24:12] things that he doesn't want from
[1:24:18] I'm still trying but he Yes. Now he has
[1:24:22] trained me through a lot. So I
[1:24:24] personally know him.
[1:24:30] So whatever is passing through your
[1:24:32] life,
[1:24:35] God is not letting you down. He's not
[1:24:40] He's not against you.
[1:24:43] But he puts you through some some life
[1:24:46] situation
[1:24:49] to get the best out of you.
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:55] Now I'm happy with my life.
[1:24:59] I am happy through whatever I went for
[1:25:03] for
[1:25:05] I know for sure God is like with me.
[1:25:11] Thank you Lord.
[1:25:18] [Music]
[1:25:22] The sister, sister Betty
[1:25:26] is one of the very first that believe
[1:25:28] the message in the country.
[1:25:32] My wife and I were there
[1:25:35] and uh I can say there's something about
[1:25:39] um about her family
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:45] that uh their homes was one of the very
[1:25:48] first in the entire country of Ethiopia
[1:25:50] to hear of this message of God
[1:25:58] that before I my wife and I even
[1:26:00] traveled
[1:26:03] uh there's a brother who had already
[1:26:04] traveled there
[1:26:07] was working with the father of sister uh
[1:26:10] of sister Betty
[1:26:14] and you know after he died,
[1:26:17] you know, somehow the message had not
[1:26:19] yet become personally known to them as a
[1:26:21] family.
[1:26:25] But God is God.
[1:26:28] God is God.
[1:26:31] There is no seed of God can be lost.
[1:26:35] No seed of God can. It was proved to me.
[1:26:39] I knew of your father, sister Betty.
[1:26:42] I had tried to get to approach to get to
[1:26:44] see him because she was in translating
[1:26:46] the message,
[1:26:49] but somehow we were not allowed to meet
[1:26:51] him.
[1:26:53] And then after his passing, I did not
[1:26:56] know of any possible way of reaching
[1:26:58] out.
[1:27:00] But then God sent someone all the way
[1:27:02] from South Africa,
[1:27:06] a brother, pastor, preach of this
[1:27:08] message.
[1:27:10] contacts me and says there is a family
[1:27:14] that I have on my heart.
[1:27:17] I would like to come and look for them.
[1:27:20] When he mentioned the name of the man I
[1:27:22] knew,
[1:27:23] I said, "But there is no way I can
[1:27:25] possibly find them.
[1:27:28] Do you know of any way?"
[1:27:31] So I said, "Anyway, come we'll see what
[1:27:34] and talk about the leadership of the
[1:27:36] Holy Spirit.
[1:27:38] God led us from road to road, from block
[1:27:41] to block until we got to their house
[1:27:47] and the rest is history.
[1:27:50] This is not lifting any man,
[1:27:52] it is lifting God.
[1:27:56] So if God is not done with you,
[1:28:00] you cannot be destroyed.
[1:28:03] You cannot be lost.
[1:28:06] We appreciate God for this message.
[1:28:09] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:07] Lord, I sincerely pray that you'll come
[1:32:08] and have the preeminence.
[1:32:13] May you be seen, Lord.
[1:32:17] Lord, we are just your unworthy servant.
[1:32:22] Lord, there's nothing in us
[1:32:25] that can satisfy your people, Lord.
[1:32:29] Lord, if you could come down
[1:32:33] and bring your word, Lord Jesus,
[1:32:36] in such a way that our hearts will be
[1:32:38] moved.
[1:32:41] The Lord, those that are sick will be
[1:32:43] healed.
[1:32:44] Those who are wounded, Lord,
[1:32:48] they will be healed, Lord Jesus.
[1:32:51] And Father, I pray
[1:32:53] that you might be seen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We give the service to you, Lord.
[1:32:59] the reading of the word, the preaching
[1:33:00] of the word.
[1:33:02] It's all about you Jesus.
[1:33:05] It's all about you Jesus.
[1:33:08] Have your way this morning
[1:33:11] in Jesus mighty name.
[1:33:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:17] Amen. Shall we please turn to our Bibles
[1:33:22] in the book of Colossians chapter 2?
[1:33:28] We're going to read from verses 8.
[1:33:35] We'll read up to verses
[1:33:37] um
[1:33:41] vers 15.
[1:33:45] Um what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[1:33:48] I normally don't do this.
[1:33:52] I'm going to preach what I preach on
[1:33:53] Wednesday.
[1:33:56] And if you open your heart,
[1:34:00] the Holy Spirit will will help me to
[1:34:02] continue and add on something.
[1:34:07] If you notice how much I preach
[1:34:11] determines depends on you
[1:34:16] and maybe my interpreter.
[1:34:18] So you pray for him that God will help
[1:34:21] him and also that pray for yourself that
[1:34:24] God will help all of us
[1:34:27] that we will be able to see what the
[1:34:28] Holy Spirit wants to see.
[1:34:32] Amen. Maybe brother Isaac you can call
[1:34:34] this part part three we're dealing on
[1:34:37] God having preeminence in his bride.
[1:34:42] Beware lest any man spool you through
[1:34:44] philosophy and vain deceit after the
[1:34:46] tradition of men, after the rudiments of
[1:34:49] the world, and not after Christ. And I
[1:34:52] think I'm going to read the rest alone,
[1:34:53] but you read that first part as well.
[1:35:12] All right. Now, I'll read up to verses
[1:35:14] 15. Just follow me. For in him dwelleth
[1:35:16] in dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:35:18] godhead bodily, and ye are complete in
[1:35:20] him, which is the head of all
[1:35:22] principality and power, in whom also ye
[1:35:25] are circumcised with the circumcision,
[1:35:27] made without hands, in putting off the
[1:35:29] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:35:31] circumcision of Christ, buried with him
[1:35:33] in baptism, wherein also ye arisen with
[1:35:36] him through the faith of the operation
[1:35:38] of God, who has raised him from the
[1:35:41] dead.
[1:35:44] And you being dead in your trust sins
[1:35:46] and and um and the and and the
[1:35:50] uncircumcision of your flesh, has he
[1:35:52] quickened together with him, having
[1:35:54] forgiven all you uh forgiven you all
[1:35:57] your trespasses, blotting out the
[1:36:00] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:36:02] against us, which was contrary to us,
[1:36:05] and took it out of the way, nailing it
[1:36:07] to the to his cross. And having spilled
[1:36:10] principalities and powers, he made a
[1:36:13] show of them openly, triumphing over
[1:36:16] them in it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated, please.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I think S you sang a very appropriate
[1:36:24] song and about him bridging the
[1:36:33] want to thank God for that.
[1:36:36] So, are you ready for the word this
[1:36:38] morning?
[1:36:40] That's 10% of you.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for the word this morning?
[1:36:45] Amen. And before I I we go into the word
[1:36:48] this morning, I wanted to remind you
[1:36:49] that I'll be away on Friday to see the
[1:36:51] Bible
[1:36:54] and I'll be away for um I had originally
[1:36:57] planned to be away for one weekend,
[1:37:02] but
[1:37:04] uh one of our friends there, pastor that
[1:37:07] I'm going to be around
[1:37:13] specifically requested that if I could
[1:37:14] be able to extend
[1:37:18] for another Sunday. So the Lord willing,
[1:37:21] we'll let you know. The Lord willing
[1:37:24] might be there for two Sundays and then
[1:37:25] we
[1:37:28] all right. So now we're speaking on very
[1:37:30] very important uh things on this subject
[1:37:35] and I'm really uh and sincerely asking
[1:37:38] for your undivided attention.
[1:37:44] Um, please let us try to avoid movements
[1:37:47] as much as we can.
[1:37:51] Let's get into this, shall we? This
[1:37:52] morning.
[1:37:55] Amen. God having preeminence in his
[1:37:58] bride.
[1:38:01] He wants to be seen.
[1:38:03] He wants to be worshiped.
[1:38:06] He wants to be known.
[1:38:08] This is not about a religion.
[1:38:11] This is not about a church. This is not
[1:38:13] about a preacher. This is not about a
[1:38:16] system. It's not about anybody.
[1:38:19] It's all about Christ. And that's why he
[1:38:22] said, "Beware lest any man spoil you,
[1:38:28] through philosophy,
[1:38:30] through vain deceit,
[1:38:32] through tradition of men and rudiments
[1:38:35] of the world,
[1:38:37] but not after Christ.
[1:38:41] And so we talked about philosophy,
[1:38:44] philosophy and we found out philosophy
[1:38:46] philosophy is a a set of beliefs
[1:38:54] or a certain thinking
[1:38:58] or ideas
[1:39:01] in in Latin it's called
[1:39:06] set of ideas.
[1:39:09] a set of beliefs.
[1:39:12] If you have ever heard of anything
[1:39:13] called a church manual,
[1:39:17] that is a set of beliefs
[1:39:20] and every denomination has a church
[1:39:23] manual.
[1:39:27] Of course, you know, we do not.
[1:39:29] And that's why we are not a
[1:39:31] denomination.
[1:39:33] Listen, we when I say we, I am not
[1:39:36] meaning this fellowship.
[1:39:38] Days of the voice fellowship days of the
[1:39:40] voice.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; We are only representative of the church
[1:39:43] of Christ.
[1:39:46] Christ has a church.
[1:39:49] It is one church. It is not divided and
[1:39:53] that church is all over the world.
[1:39:56] That's why it is actually supposed to be
[1:39:58] the Catholic church.
[1:40:02] The word Catholic means worldwide.
[1:40:07] The Roman Catholic Church
[1:40:10] claims to be the one world church of
[1:40:12] Christ
[1:40:15] but they are wrong. The bride of Christ
[1:40:19] all through the ages
[1:40:22] two Catholic church
[1:40:25] because it is worldwide.
[1:40:29] People almost everywhere
[1:40:32] whose hearts are all on fire.
[1:40:35] They are baptized in Jesus name.
[1:40:38] They are all believers of in
[1:40:42] other words is the church of Christ.
[1:40:45] But philosophy
[1:40:48] draw you away from the belief system of
[1:40:50] the world
[1:40:54] and it it will it will uh tie you to a
[1:40:58] belief system of a denominational
[1:41:00] church.
[1:41:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:07] Move my because I'm determined to pound
[1:41:08] this this morning.
[1:41:12] So they will tie you to a system.
[1:41:16] They will tie you to their denomination
[1:41:19] and when you leave it they will tell you
[1:41:22] you are lost.
[1:41:24] You see I and I pray that we as message
[1:41:26] believers never come to that place.
[1:41:30] Amen. Amen. Our churches are not
[1:41:33] churches
[1:41:35] are fellowships
[1:41:38] of one church
[1:41:41] and that church is all over the world.
[1:41:45] No one knows how many members are in it.
[1:41:49] So we don't know our membership
[1:41:52] but I can tell you they are all over the
[1:41:54] world
[1:41:56] but philosophy
[1:41:58] will simply take you to a set of
[1:42:01] doctrines
[1:42:05] and the bottom says well they say we
[1:42:07] believe A B C D F G Z full stop
[1:42:13] but he said that's a denomination
[1:42:16] but we are not a denomination.
[1:42:20] A B C D E F G and as much as God shall
[1:42:23] reveal.
[1:42:28] So we have no end
[1:42:30] to what our belief system is.
[1:42:34] As long as God has no end to him,
[1:42:38] we believe everything that he has
[1:42:40] revealed and everything he will reveal.
[1:42:45] Our revelation is not closed.
[1:42:48] Tell your neighbor our revelation is
[1:42:49] coming.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:54] Praise the name of the Lord. And then he
[1:42:56] said be aware of philosophy.
[1:42:59] Be aware of vain deceit.
[1:43:03] You know tradition of men
[1:43:06] and we talked so much about tradition
[1:43:10] so I may not dwell on it so much this
[1:43:12] morning. many many traditions
[1:43:15] and you know it takes people away from
[1:43:18] the word
[1:43:20] we have even heard of many things.
[1:43:22] Oh, if so and if if a couple does this
[1:43:25] and this,
[1:43:27] they can't wear a gown.
[1:43:30] If they wear a gown on their wedding
[1:43:32] day, they can't cover their face,
[1:43:37] you know. I mean, these are just
[1:43:39] tradition.
[1:43:41] It's nowhere in the Bible.
[1:43:45] You can get married with or without a
[1:43:47] gown.
[1:43:49] Am
[1:43:51] I preaching to believers?
[1:43:54] You understand? But if you want to go,
[1:43:56] it's a honorable thing.
[1:43:59] It's a honorable thing. It's a tradition
[1:44:02] of the church.
[1:44:04] We are not bound to that or any other
[1:44:07] tradition.
[1:44:11] Pride is bound to the word.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And you know, you have you have things I
[1:44:17] I've gave you a few a few examples.
[1:44:20] or someone immediately they they found
[1:44:22] they have done something wrong
[1:44:24] they have to come and confess before
[1:44:25] they come
[1:44:29] and everybody will ask him as if we are
[1:44:32] confessors
[1:44:35] we are not Catholic priests
[1:44:38] are you understand what I'm saying you
[1:44:41] know that's not how holiness or
[1:44:42] righteousness comes
[1:44:45] you know the holiness that Christ that
[1:44:47] is in Christ
[1:44:50] does not come by the works of the flesh.
[1:44:54] Let me put it this way does not come by
[1:44:56] your own human ability.
[1:45:01] And and so the that that kind of system
[1:45:03] those kind of tradition
[1:45:06] will not help but they will destroy
[1:45:10] and you have many traditions. Oh, if you
[1:45:12] leave this church I was in Nairobi and
[1:45:15] you know this was a message church.
[1:45:18] and we were having communion.
[1:45:20] And then this sister comes up. She can't
[1:45:23] have communion with us.
[1:45:25] And I asked her, "Sister, what's wrong?"
[1:45:28] She said, "Well, I'm from another
[1:45:29] church."
[1:45:31] I said, "Is it not a message?"
[1:45:34] She said, "Oh, yes it is, but it's not
[1:45:36] my local church. I cannot have I cannot
[1:45:40] have the Lord's supper in another home."
[1:45:45] That's a simple tradition.
[1:45:47] You don't find that in the world.
[1:45:51] And I'm afraid
[1:45:53] many believers
[1:45:55] who have subscribed to traditions
[1:45:59] instead of Christ.
[1:46:02] Let me say something this morning. The
[1:46:05] message actually came to set us free
[1:46:08] from traditions of men.
[1:46:13] The message came
[1:46:16] through. So this morning I can say I am
[1:46:19] liberator.
[1:46:23] This message come to cut our connection
[1:46:26] with men
[1:46:31] and us with Christ.
[1:46:34] We are in a uniting time.
[1:46:38] Is being united to the groom.
[1:46:43] all about you and Christ
[1:46:47] redemptive promise
[1:46:50] is your right
[1:46:52] is your right no man can take it no
[1:46:56] system
[1:46:59] how can they say when you leave our
[1:47:01] fellowship you are lost until they even
[1:47:05] say you can't marry from this church
[1:47:07] from the other church if you're not a
[1:47:08] member of this
[1:47:14] It's a tradition.
[1:47:16] If you want to marry in our church, come
[1:47:18] join our church.
[1:47:22] Sometimes even younger ladies get
[1:47:24] married.
[1:47:26] And they refuse to leave their churches
[1:47:29] simply because they feel heaven is here.
[1:47:32] I join the other church, I will go to
[1:47:35] hell. Why you get then marrying a
[1:47:37] brother from another church?
[1:47:40] God bless you.
[1:47:43] But I tell you, brother,
[1:47:47] you are free to marry anywhere as long
[1:47:49] as they are believers of the message of
[1:47:51] the hour.
[1:47:55] And if you love DVF so much
[1:47:58] and you don't want to leave, men don't
[1:48:09] and you you you you get married with
[1:48:11] from a a brother who lives in Ethiopia.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I will tell you you are going to
[1:48:15] Ethiopia.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; By the way, we have a I'm sorry. I
[1:48:20] didn't even think about you when I said
[1:48:21] that.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a sister here, my daughter
[1:48:24] who went to
[1:48:28] That's the That's the way of God.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you get a sister, if you get a
[1:48:34] brother from another church,
[1:48:37] follow the brother. Unless of course you
[1:48:40] have a mutual agreement.
[1:48:42] We have we had one of my best singers
[1:48:44] here. She got married.
[1:48:48] And she left. I still feel bad.
[1:48:52] [Applause]
[1:48:54] But I blessed her. I said, "Go upon her
[1:48:57] husband.
[1:48:59] Praise the name of the Lord. That's the
[1:49:01] way of God. The way of the world
[1:49:06] this message,
[1:49:11] the reason why we have come
[1:49:15] men are not preaching Christ.
[1:49:18] They are preaching themselves.
[1:49:21] They are preaching their philosophy
[1:49:24] their own tradition.
[1:49:26] If you're preaching Christ, it doesn't
[1:49:29] matter where your people will go.
[1:49:33] We don't have a camp.
[1:49:36] We have no heaven to take it to
[1:49:39] you to be united with Christ.
[1:49:45] He wants to have the preeminence
[1:49:50] in his own body.
[1:49:52] He wants to have the control
[1:49:55] over his own people.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:00] For Christ to have preeminence in his
[1:50:02] church
[1:50:04] is by the word.
[1:50:07] Two things by the word and the Holy
[1:50:11] Spirit.
[1:50:14] Amen. The word and the spirit are one.
[1:50:20] Amen. If someone claim to believe a word
[1:50:24] and then they reject the Holy Spirit,
[1:50:26] he sure they did not believe to begin
[1:50:28] with.
[1:50:30] But if someone claims to have the
[1:50:32] spirit,
[1:50:34] I will tell you what, they will always
[1:50:36] receive the word.
[1:50:40] So anything short of that
[1:50:44] it only creates philosophy
[1:50:49] traditions
[1:50:51] and these things
[1:50:53] listen are the breeding grounds to cults
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:03] tradition of man
[1:51:07] philosophy
[1:51:09] rudments of the world,
[1:51:13] the things that bring about cult.
[1:51:18] What is a cult?
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; And I and I had a definition here that I
[1:51:22] got from, you know, uh from the
[1:51:24] dictionary.
[1:51:26] I'll read it to you again. Cult
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; can refer to a group
[1:51:32] with an unusual
[1:51:35] often extreme religious, spiritual or
[1:51:37] philosophical belief system.
[1:51:43] often
[1:51:48] with a charismatic leader
[1:51:53] who exerts a certain significant control
[1:51:57] over the members.
[1:52:02] Alternatively,
[1:52:04] a cult can also
[1:52:06] it can also signify intense devotion to
[1:52:10] a person.
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:19] all your devotion
[1:52:23] to that man
[1:52:26] to an idea
[1:52:28] or to a lifestyle.
[1:52:31] You see now
[1:52:34] you know these are the people who will
[1:52:35] be our man has spoken
[1:52:39] whe
[1:52:41] it is not true I don't care you accept
[1:52:45] it
[1:52:48] there is a problem
[1:52:50] their alleiance
[1:52:52] is with a man or a system
[1:52:59] and not the Of
[1:53:03] course, as I'm preaching, you are now
[1:53:05] wondering, am I in account? Of course,
[1:53:06] you have to check yourself.
[1:53:13] It doesn't matter what
[1:53:16] as long as they are gluing all their
[1:53:19] legions and you know to a man
[1:53:27] be aware.
[1:53:29] a man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:53:31] deceit tradition of men and rudess of
[1:53:34] the world
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:40] after Christ.
[1:53:42] When you talk about their man,
[1:53:45] they can almost maybe kill you if they
[1:53:47] have
[1:53:50] diabist
[1:53:57] movement.
[1:53:59] They will follow the man as long as he
[1:54:02] has spoken, they will follow him.
[1:54:06] Where they speak lies, they will follow
[1:54:08] him.
[1:54:09] Whe they speak the truth, they will
[1:54:11] follow.
[1:54:16] I don't want to hear anything.
[1:54:19] But let me tell you, the message of
[1:54:21] Yahweh came to cut that nonsense.
[1:54:27] He came to cut that.
[1:54:30] Amen. He came to bring us to Christ.
[1:54:37] even say if it's not the word
[1:54:40] leave it alone
[1:54:43] if I say anything
[1:54:47] leave it alone
[1:54:50] that's what our prophet say
[1:54:57] is my
[1:55:03] and then you have people saying
[1:55:06] what brother said is my
[1:55:12] don't understand the message
[1:55:17] was a human being
[1:55:19] he was a man of God he was a prophet of
[1:55:22] God but even me as your
[1:55:26] not everything I say is the absolute
[1:55:30] I say you check it with a word
[1:55:36] Now our prophet told us whatever he says
[1:55:41] we check it with the world
[1:55:44] it
[1:55:46] believed this message
[1:55:48] for 19 years.
[1:55:52] I have some news for you churching
[1:55:56] the things
[1:56:00] with the Bible. I have always seen it is
[1:56:03] straight with the word straight with the
[1:56:05] word straight with the word
[1:56:10] and that's why I'm following brother
[1:56:14] I'm not following brother
[1:56:17] I'm following him because he's following
[1:56:20] Christ
[1:56:23] and when I say him I'm not meaning a man
[1:56:27] the man died more than 50 years ago
[1:56:30] I am his message,
[1:56:33] his
[1:56:35] teaching
[1:56:38] teaching.
[1:56:40] [Applause]
[1:56:42] So where is my allegiance?
[1:56:46] I pledge alce
[1:56:50] to the lamb.
[1:56:52] He alone was worthy
[1:56:55] to take the book
[1:56:59] and reveal the mystery to us.
[1:57:04] Amen. Apostle Paul said follow me as I
[1:57:09] follow Christ.
[1:57:12] Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the name of the
[1:57:14] Lord. Brother, come up here. This is the
[1:57:17] problem we have in our generation.
[1:57:20] Come up here. And so when your leader
[1:57:24] is following Christ, follow him. But the
[1:57:28] problem, even when he veers off, we veer
[1:57:32] off.
[1:57:35] That's the problem.
[1:57:38] We should never leave the word.
[1:57:41] God is not a respector of God.
[1:57:46] God respects one thing
[1:57:49] that is his word.
[1:57:51] And as long as a man is respecting the
[1:57:53] word,
[1:57:56] follow the man.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; It's all about Christ.
[1:58:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:06] Friends,
[1:58:09] it's only in the message church we can
[1:58:10] preach this.
[1:58:14] If you preach this in some denomination,
[1:58:17] they will think you attacking their
[1:58:18] mind.
[1:58:23] But I'm so glad in this message we have
[1:58:26] no big somebody.
[1:58:28] We have no small.
[1:58:30] We only have one big Christ.
[1:58:34] Hallelujah. Amen. We have one big
[1:58:39] word, the Holy Ghost. And that's what we
[1:58:42] are following.
[1:58:45] Oh, I am so glad to announce this
[1:58:47] morning
[1:58:48] we are not
[1:58:54] but be aware.
[1:58:56] There will be men
[1:58:59] who will try to drive you
[1:59:05] following a man
[1:59:08] of following Christ.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; You know in the days of brother Bam
[1:59:15] There are people who came up and they
[1:59:18] said go it has been revealed to us
[1:59:21] no one should preach
[1:59:24] but you
[1:59:27] you were Jesus Christ
[1:59:32] he said what that's blasphemy
[1:59:35] I am your brother
[1:59:38] we have preachers everybody should
[1:59:39] preach
[1:59:41] everybody that is called to preach
[1:59:42] should preach
[1:59:44] that's what our prophet said
[1:59:46] even today you have some believers
[1:59:51] who will tell you that still only
[1:59:54] brother Bam should preach
[1:59:58] tradition of men
[2:00:00] philosophy
[2:00:02] and you know it's a certain spirit
[2:00:06] because it comes using the word
[2:00:10] but you have to have a spirit of desire
[2:00:15] to know like Paul said,
[2:00:19] some say we have aos.
[2:00:24] Did I die for you? Were you baptized in
[2:00:27] my name?
[2:00:30] Did I give my blood for you? But
[2:00:32] friends, we have someone who gave his
[2:00:34] blood for us.
[2:00:37] Who died for us?
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; The one that was worthy.
[2:00:42] And that is Jesus Christ.
[2:00:45] And brother said the message is Christ.
[2:00:52] Now we have no headquarter
[2:00:55] and we should not have a headquarter
[2:00:58] because we do not have to pay allegiance
[2:01:00] to any man.
[2:01:03] The highest authority
[2:01:06] in the church is the pastor.
[2:01:10] But what does the pastor use?
[2:01:13] He uses the word
[2:01:15] and the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:20] Did you know in this generation we have
[2:01:23] men who will tell you
[2:01:26] they go cry?
[2:01:30] My husband my husband
[2:01:35] your husband.
[2:01:37] God already spoke to me.
[2:01:39] Leave that man.
[2:01:41] He's stabbing you. I'll give you brother
[2:01:44] Julius
[2:01:48] because he knows brother Julius
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; is a die hard.
[2:01:55] He knows he's an follower.
[2:01:59] He would die for his leader. the same
[2:02:02] brother
[2:02:07] and they have many who are caught into
[2:02:10] those kind of
[2:02:13] they don't even check anything with the
[2:02:15] word
[2:02:17] but a prophet taught us always check it
[2:02:20] with the word
[2:02:23] give everything a word test
[2:02:28] if you pass the test of the word
[2:02:32] then believe it.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't, regardless of who has
[2:02:36] spoken it,
[2:02:38] walk away from me.
[2:02:42] All right. Now, I'm going to do a lot of
[2:02:44] quoting and brother, if you can put up
[2:02:45] the voice.
[2:02:49] So, while I'm quoting, I'm preaching.
[2:02:52] Don't wait for me to quote and then
[2:02:53] preach.
[2:02:55] I preach quote.
[2:02:58] Ephesian church agent
[2:03:00] says in other words take all the
[2:03:03] sacredness and all the power from the
[2:03:05] church
[2:03:08] and put it on the priests.
[2:03:15] Let the congregation live the way it
[2:03:17] wants to, but the priest is the holy
[2:03:18] one.
[2:03:23] Taking the Holy Ghost away from the
[2:03:24] people with signs and wonders following
[2:03:26] them
[2:03:31] and take that away and give them a holy
[2:03:33] power.
[2:03:35] Are you not so glad that you are
[2:03:38] believing a message that still believes
[2:03:39] in signs and wonders
[2:03:43] in the supernatural?
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:50] Every denomination
[2:03:53] is led by elders.
[2:03:56] And I I gave you example the Roman
[2:03:59] Catholic Church. That's what they call a
[2:04:01] Roman curer.
[2:04:04] Curia is a is a it's a it's um a council
[2:04:08] of of of uh how do they call them?
[2:04:10] Cardinals
[2:04:14] inside the big things.
[2:04:17] And when you go to the Anglican church,
[2:04:22] when you you have to go to Baptist,
[2:04:27] they sit down and they are the ones who
[2:04:30] make the big decisions.
[2:04:32] So they're the ones when someone goes
[2:04:34] rogue or direct them.
[2:04:39] But you see that is not the order of
[2:04:42] God.
[2:04:45] God has his own way
[2:04:48] of ruling over his own church.
[2:04:52] Am I preaching to someone this morning?
[2:04:55] What does God use?
[2:04:57] God uses the Holy Spirit
[2:05:02] and the word. And here is the most
[2:05:05] interesting.
[2:05:06] Every member of the body
[2:05:10] has access to those two.
[2:05:14] That should make you excited.
[2:05:17] You have access to the word.
[2:05:20] You have access to the Holy Spirit.
[2:05:23] You can deep in by yourself.
[2:05:27] So what then do pastors do
[2:05:31] the the teacher the the apostle
[2:05:35] ministry?
[2:05:37] Their job is not to introduce something
[2:05:40] new.
[2:05:42] Their job is not to give you their
[2:05:44] opinion.
[2:05:46] Their job is to edify you
[2:05:50] so that you can mature.
[2:05:53] And how do they do that?
[2:05:56] Preaching and teaching.
[2:05:59] But they also do it
[2:06:02] power of the Holy Spirit.
[2:06:06] You realize a man without the Holy Ghost
[2:06:11] preaching this gospel
[2:06:13] take many people to hell.
[2:06:18] You don't only need a gift.
[2:06:21] Gift is one thing. And the Bible says
[2:06:24] gifts and callings are without
[2:06:25] repentance.
[2:06:28] But you need Holy Ghost filled men
[2:06:32] who will take the word.
[2:06:35] the Holy Ghost and they preach this
[2:06:38] message and they preach the word
[2:06:42] and can I inform you we have these ones
[2:06:45] very many around the world.
[2:06:48] Amen. We have so many you can't finish
[2:06:52] them.
[2:06:54] Even right here in the church we have so
[2:06:56] many.
[2:06:57] I am just one little bit of
[2:07:01] but God will use them
[2:07:04] and then also he will use the nine
[2:07:05] spiritual gifts.
[2:07:08] Praise the name of the Lord. And that's
[2:07:11] the order of God.
[2:07:13] But this system
[2:07:16] they will take all those things and
[2:07:18] throw it out of the window.
[2:07:21] They are allergic to tongues.
[2:07:25] They are allergic to speaking in tongues
[2:07:27] and interpretation of
[2:07:31] afford in so many me churches
[2:07:35] brother. Do you know
[2:07:39] they speak about tongues in a negative
[2:07:41] way?
[2:07:44] Do you know why?
[2:07:46] Because they don't see them operating in
[2:07:47] their midst.
[2:07:51] They think it is Pentecost.
[2:07:55] It is not Pentecostal.
[2:07:58] It is
[2:08:02] open. Open your Bible. Open your Bible.
[2:08:04] Mark
[2:08:07] chapter 16. I want you to read vers 16.
[2:08:12] Not my Bible. In your Bible.
[2:08:15] Can we give you a microphone? You read
[2:08:16] it.
[2:08:18] Let's try to be fast.
[2:08:21] Brother Calb, quickly. Where's the
[2:08:23] microphone?
[2:08:27] Somebody come up. Stand up if you have
[2:08:28] you have seen it.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; No good Bible reader here.
[2:08:41] All right, read it quickly. And he said
[2:08:44] unto them, "Go ye into all the world and
[2:08:49] preach the gospel creature.
[2:08:52] He that believeth and baptized
[2:08:55] shall be saved. But he that believeth
[2:08:58] not shall be done.
[2:09:01] And these signs
[2:09:03] shall follow them that
[2:09:06] in my name they shall cast out. They
[2:09:09] will speak with new tongues. Read that
[2:09:11] again. In my name they shall cast out
[2:09:14] devils.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; They shall do what?
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Cast out devils.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody say they shall do what?
[2:09:19] Do we still believe that?
[2:09:22] They're casting out devils.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh-huh.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; And they shall speak with new tong.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues.
[2:09:29] Did you hear that?
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Oh, those new tongues
[2:09:33] have to be only languages of men." No.
[2:09:39] No. The Apostle Paul taught it can be
[2:09:42] tongue of angels or
[2:09:47] Yes sir. Yes. Yes. But as long as this
[2:09:49] coming from all by inspiration of the
[2:09:51] word.
[2:09:53] Can someone speak tong and interpret on
[2:09:55] their own? Yes.
[2:09:59] But then it has to be judged
[2:10:02] by those who are spiritual. You know
[2:10:04] these things are told well in the
[2:10:05] message
[2:10:08] but we just dismiss them
[2:10:10] and we go back to our foundations again.
[2:10:16] Because you see if we let anybody remove
[2:10:18] that from us
[2:10:21] what are we remaining with we are going
[2:10:24] to remain with philosophies.
[2:10:28] We are going to remain with tradition
[2:10:31] and Christ will not have his church like
[2:10:33] that
[2:10:37] come out of them.
[2:10:40] He wants to lead his church.
[2:10:42] He wants to be the one to instruct.
[2:10:48] It finally became in this church here.
[2:10:50] It was deeds
[2:10:54] and this place became a doctrine
[2:10:58] in the age of it took over
[2:11:04] and when Luther came out he couldn't
[2:11:07] stay that way. It went right back again
[2:11:09] and took over again.
[2:11:12] bishops, cardinal
[2:11:15] who in the world is the head of the
[2:11:18] church of God's church but he himself
[2:11:24] the Holy Ghost was sent to rule the
[2:11:25] church
[2:11:28] every believer
[2:11:31] not just the preacher
[2:11:33] the whole congregation
[2:11:37] the preacher is holy but all the
[2:11:39] congregation all the church must must
[2:11:42] have the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:48] So we are all holy.
[2:11:50] That's why he says to the saints at
[2:11:54] that's why I said God bless you saints.
[2:11:58] So you have been made holy
[2:12:01] and we have already been dealing with
[2:12:03] that
[2:12:05] our identity
[2:12:08] is not in our mistakes. Listen,
[2:12:13] for you not to accept what he has made
[2:12:15] you
[2:12:18] is to be proud.
[2:12:30] So he said you are holy.
[2:12:34] Do you believe it?
[2:12:36] You are holy.
[2:12:39] You are without blemish.
[2:12:42] No spot.
[2:12:44] No wrinkle
[2:12:46] washed in the blood. And then he says
[2:12:49] glorious child.
[2:12:52] That's what he sees when he
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:12:59] hallelujah. Do I have mistakes?
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; A whole lot of them.
[2:13:05] Have I done wrong things?
[2:13:08] A whole lot of them. But it doesn't look
[2:13:11] at those.
[2:13:13] He said, "As long as you have confessed
[2:13:15] and repented of them,
[2:13:19] the bleach of the blood
[2:13:23] of them."
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he bridges the curs
[2:13:31] on the other side.
[2:13:33] What is on the other side? The mystery
[2:13:36] becomes unveiled.
[2:13:40] What is the mystery? Follow me church.
[2:13:44] This mystery is a mystery which has been
[2:13:47] hid in all age
[2:13:51] generation.
[2:13:53] He says but now it has been made
[2:13:57] manifest
[2:13:58] to his saints.
[2:14:03] He says what is the mystery? It is
[2:14:06] Christ
[2:14:08] in you.
[2:14:10] the hope of glory.
[2:14:13] So that's why Paul said if there is any
[2:14:16] glory
[2:14:17] it is in Christ
[2:14:19] I have nothing to glory in my
[2:14:23] glory in Christ
[2:14:27] and in the work of redemption
[2:14:30] but he has done for me.
[2:14:33] So what is it? He is the preeminent one.
[2:14:40] I'm so afraid
[2:14:42] that the church has wanted to take that
[2:14:45] glory
[2:14:48] or a few members of it
[2:14:51] called bishops, apostles, pastors
[2:14:54] or some gifted people
[2:14:57] and you'll find that they will become
[2:14:59] something
[2:15:03] what God intended.
[2:15:05] Let's continue studying.
[2:15:08] Um and we are in the church Ephesian
[2:15:10] church
[2:15:11] now. Please just stay with me now. We
[2:15:15] only have one Sunday morning.
[2:15:18] It's it's 12:12.
[2:15:21] Give me some time.
[2:15:23] If you love the word, you won't be
[2:15:24] bored.
[2:15:26] You won't even be tired. You won't even
[2:15:29] do.
[2:15:31] Praise the Lord. Listen now. What was
[2:15:34] the spiritual climate of that church?
[2:15:39] It had left its first love,
[2:15:44] leaving his first love of the word of
[2:15:47] God
[2:15:50] was revealed to us as having fallen from
[2:15:53] its origin.
[2:16:00] Remember, we talking about our true
[2:16:01] origin.
[2:16:04] The church is fallen.
[2:16:07] because they have left
[2:16:13] of the blood
[2:16:17] again to where we came from.
[2:16:20] We come from God. We go back.
[2:16:24] That's why the origin was
[2:16:30] because
[2:16:32] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:38] In a plain English
[2:16:40] that means this church was in danger of
[2:16:43] be being taken away from the leading of
[2:16:46] the
[2:16:52] being taken away from the control of the
[2:16:54] spirit.
[2:16:57] This was exactly what took place
[2:17:00] after Moses led Israel out of Egypt.
[2:17:05] The way of God was to lead them by the
[2:17:07] cloud of fire
[2:17:10] by prophetic utterance
[2:17:12] by miracles and signs
[2:17:15] God given wonders.
[2:17:18] This is the way of God.
[2:17:21] He wants to lead us.
[2:17:24] Sisters, brothers, can we
[2:17:28] allow him to lead us?
[2:17:30] We believe is the same today.
[2:17:33] Miracles still happen.
[2:17:36] Wonder still happen.
[2:17:38] Sign still happen.
[2:17:40] Prophetic.
[2:17:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can you imagine?
[2:17:52] People despise these things
[2:17:55] and they call it Pentecost.
[2:17:58] No, it is ours.
[2:18:02] This was to be accomplished.
[2:18:05] Oh, listen now. How was God going to
[2:18:07] lead the church
[2:18:10] using those things? Prophetic utterance,
[2:18:15] signs and wonders and and all these
[2:18:18] things. How was he going to do that? He
[2:18:20] says this was to be accomplished
[2:18:23] by God selected.
[2:18:27] by God selected.
[2:18:30] He has more. All right. You want me to
[2:18:32] finish it? God selected, God ordained,
[2:18:34] and God equipped. And God sent men,
[2:18:44] God ordained.
[2:18:48] Do you believe that?
[2:18:50] That Oh my. May God open this to you
[2:18:53] now.
[2:18:54] Do you believe God can call
[2:18:57] and select a man,
[2:19:02] ordain the man,
[2:19:05] equip the man,
[2:19:07] and send the man out.
[2:19:10] How many believe that?
[2:19:13] Well, we believe it. But today, that has
[2:19:17] been replaced.
[2:19:19] You go to theology seminary.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; You stud degree
[2:19:25] or or some doctorate, PhD, whatever it
[2:19:28] is. And then you have those titles by
[2:19:31] your name,
[2:19:34] bishop, doctor,
[2:19:37] PhD,
[2:19:38] then the world can open their eyes.
[2:19:42] But who sent him?
[2:19:44] Philosophy. Philosophy. said, "Brethren,
[2:19:49] when I came among you, I did not come
[2:19:52] with excellency of spirit.
[2:19:57] I did not come with man's wisdom.
[2:20:02] The things I know, I did not learn it
[2:20:05] from the wisdom of man."
[2:20:11] It was revealed to me.
[2:20:16] Oh, may God send us more preacher.
[2:20:25] Those
[2:20:30] are the ones we want
[2:20:32] because then we know we shall hear from
[2:20:34] God.
[2:20:37] And then he says the whole church
[2:20:41] also will be dominated by the Holy Ghost
[2:20:44] move.
[2:20:47] But you see they rebelled
[2:20:50] and they wanted a set of rules and
[2:20:52] creeds to
[2:20:56] Brother said when they denominate
[2:20:59] they die.
[2:21:03] You know they come to say well we are
[2:21:04] not so many
[2:21:07] let us make rules.
[2:21:10] Some people want to run church
[2:21:14] as an NGO.
[2:21:17] Others want to run church as a company.
[2:21:22] Others want to run church.
[2:21:24] as their backyard business.
[2:21:29] Friends, we have to understand
[2:21:32] God is God
[2:21:35] and God does his business
[2:21:38] the way he wants to do it. Whether you
[2:21:40] agree with him or not, he will run.
[2:21:46] Amen. The church came together
[2:21:50] selected a man called Mafia.
[2:21:53] Many of you even don't know. He never
[2:21:56] accomplish anything.
[2:21:59] But God
[2:22:01] is good.
[2:22:03] He goes behind them
[2:22:05] and he looks for a man who was
[2:22:08] persecuting the church.
[2:22:12] A bad man,
[2:22:14] a bad boy,
[2:22:16] a gangster.
[2:22:18] And he tells him
[2:22:22] to feel
[2:22:25] I have selected you.
[2:22:29] When God selects you
[2:22:33] does not matter.
[2:22:38] Someone did not hear me.
[2:22:53] Hallelujah.
[2:22:56] and he selected him and he said I don't
[2:22:58] care what they think about you what you
[2:23:02] have done I have selected
[2:23:05] you are going to
[2:23:08] you are going to go
[2:23:10] bless
[2:23:12] to the
[2:23:14] preach
[2:23:21] I am the truth I am the way I am the
[2:23:26] Can you imagine
[2:23:28] God selected him?
[2:23:32] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he sent
[2:23:34] him out.
[2:23:37] He was equipped
[2:23:40] by the power of the Holy Ghost. He said
[2:23:43] everything I knew might
[2:23:48] so that I may win the excellency.
[2:23:51] [Applause]
[2:23:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can I say this?
[2:24:04] Christ. We are selected.
[2:24:08] Hallelujah.
[2:24:11] Hallelujah. Amen. Many are called
[2:24:15] chosen.
[2:24:17] We are the chosen people
[2:24:20] in this generation.
[2:24:22] We are the overcome
[2:24:25] to over.
[2:24:39] Hallelujah. In every age there were
[2:24:42] those overcame
[2:24:45] every age.
[2:24:47] Don't cry because there's a spirit
[2:24:53] training you
[2:24:55] doesn't matter. I must overcome.
[2:24:59] I must overcome.
[2:25:01] I must overcome.
[2:25:03] Don't just look at me. Preach with me
[2:25:06] this morning.
[2:25:08] I must overcome.
[2:25:11] Amen. You believe that you wrestle with
[2:25:15] it and you will prevail.
[2:25:18] Let me tell you, we have a prophecy.
[2:25:22] And the prophecy says, let me tell you
[2:25:24] what he say. He says, Amen. All hell,
[2:25:30] all hell
[2:25:32] shall not prevail.
[2:25:36] Shall not prevail.
[2:25:38] over you.
[2:25:40] Why? Why? Because you are
[2:25:46] God.
[2:25:48] You are God.
[2:25:54] You are God.
[2:25:57] You are equipped.
[2:26:02] Listen. Think about those words.
[2:26:05] Think about the words.
[2:26:07] You know what it means?
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Listen to them again. You are God
[2:26:12] selected.
[2:26:14] Think about it. You are God.
[2:26:18] You are God.
[2:26:22] You know what it means? It means you
[2:26:24] cannot fail.
[2:26:27] Now tell me how can God select you?
[2:26:32] No. No.
[2:26:34] Think about it. How can God select you
[2:26:37] today
[2:26:39] when he knows he will lose you tomorrow?
[2:26:43] [Applause]
[2:26:44] Hallelujah.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Glory
[2:26:47] [Applause]
[2:26:51] me. Amen.
[2:26:55] I shall prevail.
[2:26:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:27:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Who am I? I am chosen
[2:27:05] by God. I am known before the foundation
[2:27:09] of the world. I was ninjal
[2:27:17] to overcome
[2:27:19] all the demon.
[2:27:23] Hallelujah.
[2:27:26] [Applause]
[2:27:27] That is why
[2:27:29] he gives us of the spirit.
[2:27:34] He knew we cannot overcome
[2:27:38] being a human.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? Oh my, I feel twice
[2:27:45] my size right now.
[2:27:48] What did he do? He decided
[2:27:51] to overcome as a human being.
[2:27:56] So that we will not have to overcome a
[2:27:59] human being.
[2:28:02] Stop looking at your humanity.
[2:28:07] Look at your divinity.
[2:28:12] Because he has obtained you
[2:28:22] [Applause]
[2:28:25] Christ.
[2:28:27] Christ
[2:28:29] in you.
[2:28:32] the hope
[2:28:34] of glory.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Wait, sit down. Listen to this.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Listen. The Bible says, "All have sinned
[2:28:46] and have come short of the glory
[2:28:52] of God." So, we all came short.
[2:28:57] All I've seen and I've come short of the
[2:29:01] glory.
[2:29:03] But then he says, hey, here is a
[2:29:05] mystery.
[2:29:07] It has been hid
[2:29:09] from ages
[2:29:11] and generation
[2:29:13] but now it has been made manifest
[2:29:18] to every Tom Deacon Harry
[2:29:24] to his
[2:29:29] which is
[2:29:33] Christ
[2:29:36] in me.
[2:29:38] And then he say the
[2:29:46] hallelujah. So when he says all have
[2:29:51] seen and come short of the glory I am
[2:29:55] not one of them.
[2:29:57] Hallelujah.
[2:30:00] Do you get it? I am not.
[2:30:03] If you have not understood it, you are
[2:30:04] remaining
[2:30:07] jump.
[2:30:11] Put on your spiritual thinking.
[2:30:18] I am not one of them. We all have seen
[2:30:23] and have come short of the glory.
[2:30:25] Well, I used to be.
[2:30:28] I am no longer one of them.
[2:30:31] Why? I am on the other side.
[2:30:35] I have been liberated.
[2:30:38] I have been redeemed.
[2:30:43] To the glory.
[2:30:47] So where am I? I am walking in power. I
[2:30:51] am walking in.
[2:30:53] I am walking in the
[2:30:56] word of the Lord.
[2:31:04] That's the bright place.
[2:31:09] I'll give you some more.
[2:31:12] You know, he says that you know you have
[2:31:15] already passed
[2:31:18] from death
[2:31:20] into life.
[2:31:23] So where are you? You are where are you?
[2:31:26] You are in the life.
[2:31:28] Hallelujah. Stop yourself.
[2:31:43] Hallelujah.
[2:31:50] Where are we now? We are in heavenly
[2:31:53] place
[2:31:55] in Christ Jesus.
[2:31:57] So I I'm going to refuse
[2:32:01] to believe
[2:32:06] I am not a loser.
[2:32:08] I am not
[2:32:11] a sinner.
[2:32:13] I am not
[2:32:15] [Applause]
[2:32:16] a son of God.
[2:32:20] Hallelujah. I am rich.
[2:32:22] Not just in money.
[2:32:25] Amen. Not just in money. I am rich.
[2:32:29] Glory. His power in his grace.
[2:32:35] Hallelujah.
[2:32:37] Christ is being the preeminent one.
[2:32:46] Come on, give him a clap of praise.
[2:32:50] But you see
[2:32:52] these men,
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; they try to remove that power from us
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; and try to show you as one little sorry
[2:33:00] human being
[2:33:04] who is at the mercies of a certain
[2:33:05] so-called bishop, man of God, apostle,
[2:33:08] prophet, teacher, pastor,
[2:33:13] church, denomination, great
[2:33:15] organization.
[2:33:16] If you leave our church I'm Christ.
[2:33:20] You're gone.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; Gone where?
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, of course I'm gone in Christ.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; You need to understand
[2:33:31] when I say these things.
[2:33:34] It's also bringing me in problem because
[2:33:37] I'm a pastor with the church. You
[2:33:40] understand? But I'm not trying to point
[2:33:42] you to the church.
[2:33:45] No, I'm pointing you to Christ.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Sing a song. He said, "If you kill my
[2:33:53] body,
[2:33:55] my spirit, but my spirit
[2:33:59] is in Christ."
[2:34:02] That's where the bride is in.
[2:34:05] This message has come to separate
[2:34:10] us from the dogmas
[2:34:15] of men.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; So you you say but these people they not
[2:34:21] wanted they rebelled
[2:34:24] they wanted rules and greeds.
[2:34:28] Oh my so many rules.
[2:34:31] Let me tell you,
[2:34:33] I used to. I'll be honest with you.
[2:34:37] I used to, but I no longer see this
[2:34:40] message as rules.
[2:34:46] That's true.
[2:34:49] It used to be I couldn't even baptize
[2:34:52] somebody
[2:34:54] with a bracelet on their hand.
[2:35:00] Think about it. It was a revelation I
[2:35:02] had.
[2:35:05] You understand?
[2:35:07] I have to tell them. Remove your
[2:35:09] trousers
[2:35:15] because it worked,
[2:35:17] but in the realms of legalism.
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:24] So, I don't know. I'm not too sure how
[2:35:26] many genuine ones I had.
[2:35:30] But I can tell you I heard but I'm not
[2:35:33] sure whether they were all genuine.
[2:35:38] Are you genuine?
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; You can only be genuine
[2:35:44] when you are set free from the rules
[2:35:48] and then Christ in you does the good
[2:35:51] work
[2:35:55] without the rules.
[2:35:58] He that is in Christ
[2:36:01] has gone beyond the law.
[2:36:06] You not kick away the law
[2:36:09] is beyond the law.
[2:36:11] The law doesn't control you.
[2:36:16] How many understand this?
[2:36:20] It is all about Christ.
[2:36:23] It's not about rules.
[2:36:25] Ah,
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; it's not about rules.
[2:36:30] When a child is young,
[2:36:34] you raise them with rules.
[2:36:37] Like most of my children
[2:36:39] are now going by rules.
[2:36:43] It is a must for you as a parent to
[2:36:46] raise your children with rules.
[2:36:50] They are young. They're taking milk.
[2:36:53] They don't know what is good and wrong.
[2:36:56] wrong. So they need to be told
[2:36:59] you see but not forever
[2:37:02] when they you know maybe make 17 or 18
[2:37:05] then you realize if your rules have not
[2:37:08] worked on them to see the right thing at
[2:37:10] that time
[2:37:14] it cannot after 18
[2:37:18] quit
[2:37:21] because by that time
[2:37:23] to be mature enough
[2:37:27] to understand
[2:37:29] the what will please the father.
[2:37:35] If your children love you, they want to
[2:37:38] please you.
[2:37:40] Are you following me?
[2:37:42] They want to please you, but they don't
[2:37:44] know what to do to please you. When they
[2:37:47] are so young, so you need to tell them,
[2:37:50] "I don't want you to dress that. I don't
[2:37:52] want you to speak like that. I don't
[2:37:54] want you know sometimes when we are
[2:37:57] married we tell our children shut up
[2:38:02] and then you hear them telling each
[2:38:04] other shut up.
[2:38:06] You're like, "Oh, okay. I'll wash my
[2:38:10] tongue also."
[2:38:14] Cuz you need to tell them. You don't
[2:38:16] talk that way. Be kind. Don't tell your
[2:38:20] siblings, "Shut up.
[2:38:22] Shut up."
[2:38:25] But training is a process.
[2:38:28] But you need to really seriously train
[2:38:30] because you only have a short time.
[2:38:35] After that time,
[2:38:37] Then they are on their own.
[2:38:40] They will realize what is good, accept
[2:38:45] and pleasing to the father
[2:38:47] [Music]
[2:38:48] because they have grown.
[2:38:51] So they expected to know
[2:38:53] they expected to do.
[2:38:55] So when you see them doing something
[2:38:57] wrong,
[2:38:58] you may not even speak as much. We just
[2:39:01] wink at them and
[2:39:05] oh that happened
[2:39:09] change.
[2:39:12] That's the same thing with God.
[2:39:17] You know, we don't have to keep feeding
[2:39:19] on milk.
[2:39:22] There's a time when you came to Christ,
[2:39:25] you had to be told how to make your
[2:39:28] hair, how what to put on your skin, what
[2:39:32] not to put.
[2:39:35] You understand, what to dress,
[2:39:38] how not to dress
[2:39:40] and I'm afraid we want to teach these
[2:39:43] things for 40 years.
[2:39:46] The church needs to grow.
[2:39:49] When I say the church, I mean you as
[2:39:52] [Music]
[2:39:53] You cannot be in the message
[2:39:56] for 20 years for 5 years
[2:40:01] being told how to dress,
[2:40:03] how to make your hair, how to there's a
[2:40:06] problem with go and make inventory.
[2:40:10] Am I following rules
[2:40:12] or am I am I genuine?
[2:40:15] Do I have the Holy Ghost? Am I
[2:40:17] converted? Is there something wrong? Am
[2:40:20] I just following?
[2:40:22] Have I found Christ?
[2:40:25] Let me tell you, when you find Christ,
[2:40:28] oh, the Lord sees,
[2:40:31] you don't need them anymore
[2:40:33] because you want to do that which is
[2:40:36] good and acceptable to God.
[2:40:40] [Applause]
[2:40:42] You want to do that which is pleasing
[2:40:46] to the Father.
[2:40:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you know what is
[2:40:52] pleasing?
[2:40:55] By reading the word.
[2:40:57] By listening to the message. If when you
[2:41:00] believe, you don't read the message. You
[2:41:03] don't read the Bible. You will never
[2:41:05] know what is pleasing.
[2:41:07] You need to keep coming so we can tell
[2:41:09] you the Lord.
[2:41:13] But when you mature, we no longer talk
[2:41:16] about the rules. We have to get into the
[2:41:18] deep stuff.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; The deep the bone marrow.
[2:41:25] Pull it out. How many have you ever
[2:41:27] eaten bone marrow?
[2:41:33] Some of you don't know about
[2:41:35] maybe you are so rich and
[2:41:38] when you are eating meat just throw the
[2:41:39] body.
[2:41:43] But some of us the best part of the meat
[2:41:45] is the bone marrow
[2:41:49] after eating the meat
[2:41:52] then you take the bone
[2:41:58] begin to ah nothing like the bone marrow
[2:42:02] and I tell you friends we need to do
[2:42:05] that with the word
[2:42:07] you see we need to get into the deep
[2:42:09] stuff
[2:42:11] pull it out of the
[2:42:13] And when you do that, when you come to
[2:42:15] church, you will enjoy them.
[2:42:19] Amen.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be longer than usual
[2:42:23] today. Give me 30 minutes.
[2:42:26] And then I'll be quit. Now let let us
[2:42:28] follow on closely. He said, see how it
[2:42:31] started out in the early church.
[2:42:34] It was called deeds.
[2:42:37] Then it became a doctrine.
[2:42:40] It became the standard.
[2:42:43] It became the the unbending way.
[2:42:48] It finally took over and God was pushed
[2:42:50] aside.
[2:42:53] Oh, it sounded so small, so quietly,
[2:42:57] so in offensive
[2:43:01] even right now. Let me warn you.
[2:43:05] You know me, I encourage you here every
[2:43:07] day
[2:43:09] to go and listen to the message.
[2:43:11] But I want to know how many are
[2:43:12] listening to the message now. No, wait,
[2:43:14] wait, wait. Be sincere now.
[2:43:17] How many are listening to the message
[2:43:21] in their homes or privately on their
[2:43:22] phones or whatever?
[2:43:25] How many have started either listening
[2:43:27] or reading?
[2:43:29] Lift up your hand up high.
[2:43:33] Others are being like this. I want to
[2:43:35] see your hand.
[2:43:38] Okay. God bless you. Still it's a small
[2:43:41] number.
[2:43:43] There is a big number that is not
[2:43:46] listening.
[2:43:48] And that's a bad thing. But I want to
[2:43:50] encourage you. Stop pushing it ahead.
[2:43:56] Begin today.
[2:43:59] Begin today. It's a challenge I'm giving
[2:44:01] you.
[2:44:02] I encourage you to listen to the
[2:44:04] message.
[2:44:05] But I want I want to warn you of a
[2:44:07] certain spirit
[2:44:10] that is creeping in.
[2:44:13] [Music]
[2:44:14] Um I don't know if I'll find it on my
[2:44:16] phone.
[2:44:18] I saw a certain picture
[2:44:21] that was posted
[2:44:24] and um I know these things somehow you
[2:44:26] come across them
[2:44:29] and it's good as your pastor for me to
[2:44:31] address them from the front
[2:44:35] and this was a question
[2:44:38] from one of the preachers
[2:44:41] and when you listen to it I want you to
[2:44:42] think for a moment.
[2:44:45] He said this. Do you believe what the
[2:44:48] prophet said on the tape is your
[2:44:51] absolute
[2:44:57] or do you believe it is the Holy Spirit
[2:45:00] through you or your pastor?
[2:45:10] Are you thinking? You want me to read it
[2:45:12] again?
[2:45:14] Do you believe what the prophet said
[2:45:19] on the tape is your answer
[2:45:22] or do you believe it is the Holy Spirit
[2:45:24] through you or your pastor?
[2:45:31] Why? Why this question?
[2:45:35] For what purpose?
[2:45:38] What is the intention?
[2:45:41] You know, I I realize we just post
[2:45:43] everything. We see everything and post
[2:45:44] everything.
[2:45:51] Everything we post.
[2:45:55] So what is this trying to achieve?
[2:45:59] It's trying to shake you up
[2:46:03] and tell you you do not need you what
[2:46:06] you have to say. You do not need your
[2:46:08] pastor what he has to say.
[2:46:15] All you need
[2:46:18] is what the prophet had to say.
[2:46:22] Because the prophet is words.
[2:46:28] But not only is this wrong,
[2:46:32] it removes this principle
[2:46:35] of the preeminence.
[2:46:38] of God in his body.
[2:46:41] [Music]
[2:46:43] And listen to me carefully here
[2:46:47] because
[2:46:49] we understand
[2:46:51] according to Hebrews 13:8,
[2:46:55] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[2:47:00] today
[2:47:01] and forever,
[2:47:03] right?
[2:47:05] Brother Banham said, "I preach what?"
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; Say it louder.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; I preach what Paul
[2:47:18] did. He read only the letters and say,
[2:47:20] "Amen." And
[2:47:28] he read what Paul read
[2:47:31] and the Holy Spirit would come upon him.
[2:47:35] and he would expound it for the
[2:47:38] [Music]
[2:47:40] all the teachings we teach in the
[2:47:42] message
[2:47:44] are not new
[2:47:48] is the same old teachings that Paul
[2:47:49] preached
[2:47:53] what did he preach one God it's in the
[2:47:56] Bible baptism in Jesus name in the Bible
[2:48:01] no women preach
[2:48:05] Tongs must be interpreted.
[2:48:08] Women shouldn't cut their head.
[2:48:13] I don't even need to quote one
[2:48:16] to any of those to teach any of those
[2:48:18] things. It's right here.
[2:48:26] Tell me
[2:48:28] what I'm told. It's already in here.
[2:48:32] He didn't bring a new teacher.
[2:48:34] You already saw it. He came to finish
[2:48:36] this.
[2:48:41] So now that's why he say that the Bible
[2:48:44] is his absolute.
[2:48:48] The Bible is our absolute.
[2:48:52] Now brother is not our
[2:48:59] prophet.
[2:49:00] He died long ago.
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; Follow me closely here. I don't want you
[2:49:05] to miss anything here.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; But he as a prophet
[2:49:12] of the age,
[2:49:15] his interpretation
[2:49:19] of the Bible
[2:49:21] is the absolute interpretation.
[2:49:29] And I'll explain. There have been many
[2:49:33] today that explain the Bible.
[2:49:37] God has a way
[2:49:40] of expounding the scriptures.
[2:49:43] Are you following now?
[2:49:45] Amos 3:7.
[2:49:48] God will surely do nothing.
[2:49:52] He will reveal his secrets.
[2:49:56] his servers.
[2:49:59] Revelation 10:3 say,
[2:50:02] "But in the days of the fourth
[2:50:05] seventh
[2:50:07] when he begins to
[2:50:09] the mystery
[2:50:12] will be finished
[2:50:15] or is finished." So now it the seventh
[2:50:19] angel has to come a prophet of God and
[2:50:23] then he would open.
[2:50:26] Now let me put it this way. He would
[2:50:28] reveal
[2:50:30] the mystery.
[2:50:32] Are you following? Remember the book was
[2:50:35] already
[2:50:37] he revealed their
[2:50:42] what did he reveal? He revealed what was
[2:50:45] already there.
[2:50:49] So what was the problem? The problem was
[2:50:51] not this.
[2:50:53] The problem was this.
[2:50:56] Our eyes
[2:50:58] of understanding.
[2:51:01] But now after he has come, we can say
[2:51:06] our eyes of understanding
[2:51:09] the Lord has opened.
[2:51:14] So by hearing the message of the hour,
[2:51:18] our eyes open to the
[2:51:21] now we can understand this mystery.
[2:51:25] So you cannot remove the prophet of the
[2:51:27] age.
[2:51:29] He is the one to whom revelation comes.
[2:51:36] But remember
[2:51:38] after revelation has come to him,
[2:51:41] it's not all about him.
[2:51:44] Are you following church?
[2:51:50] He is not the groom.
[2:51:55] Who is more important?
[2:52:04] Right.
[2:52:07] Are you following?
[2:52:09] Who was more important?
[2:52:12] Please follow me closing here. Very
[2:52:15] sensitive subject.
[2:52:17] Was it
[2:52:19] [Music]
[2:52:20] already?
[2:52:24] Why
[2:52:26] chapter 4
[2:52:28] said, "Behold,
[2:52:30] I send
[2:52:34] you." Can you imagine someone said
[2:52:37] behold I send the prophet because they
[2:52:39] don't have the revelation
[2:52:49] the scripture says
[2:52:52] I send you.
[2:52:57] So who is being sent?
[2:53:00] Jesus. Your servant,
[2:53:05] your messenger,
[2:53:07] who is more important, the one receiving
[2:53:10] the message.
[2:53:12] Why? Because the preeminence of the one
[2:53:15] sending the message
[2:53:19] must stand
[2:53:22] within the one who has received the
[2:53:24] message.
[2:53:27] The messenger
[2:53:29] is a mighty man
[2:53:32] because God has used him
[2:53:35] was a mighty man.
[2:53:38] We don't read about him anymore
[2:53:42] because he finishes
[2:53:44] the story of and Isaac begin.
[2:53:51] Where is the church now?
[2:53:54] The church is within the story of
[2:53:57] Rebecca and
[2:54:02] [Music]
[2:54:02] [Applause]
[2:54:05] follow
[2:54:06] the Who is the bride?
[2:54:11] The bride is the bride of the bridegroom
[2:54:16] and the bridegroom
[2:54:18] wants to have preeminence in the bride.
[2:54:24] Imagine
[2:54:28] after Isaac
[2:54:30] and Rebecca saw each other,
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; the importance
[2:54:38] of
[2:54:41] diminish
[2:54:49] what?
[2:54:51] Not even not even
[2:54:57] told Rebecca
[2:55:00] there. He's the one the one with the
[2:55:02] heart on
[2:55:06] the moment they saw each other.
[2:55:10] You know love is strong
[2:55:13] is very strong.
[2:55:24] Love is strong.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Didn't look at this. I didn't look at
[2:55:30] this.
[2:55:33] Look somewhere.
[2:55:36] And then she also looked. If you notice,
[2:55:39] not everybody here is smiling. There is
[2:55:41] one person smiling.
[2:55:48] because we know each other.
[2:55:51] [Music]
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; That's how it was.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; Then she ran to him. He received her and
[2:55:58] the love story began.
[2:56:02] Now after Revelation 10:7,
[2:56:07] it begins.
[2:56:10] Take the book out of the angel.
[2:56:13] Eat it. said, "I took the book and I ate
[2:56:16] it. It became in my mouth sweet as honey
[2:56:21] and then he said, "Thou shall prophesy
[2:56:24] again."
[2:56:26] That's the place where we are now.
[2:56:28] Hallelujah.
[2:56:31] Is prophesying again.
[2:56:35] saying what the prophet said
[2:56:44] message.
[2:56:45] Hallelujah. What is the message?
[2:56:52] Hallelujah.
[2:56:54] Not a church system.
[2:56:56] A man, a man or something like that. The
[2:56:59] message is not William.
[2:57:03] We are noting people and we areing them
[2:57:08] to cry and
[2:57:11] why is the church built
[2:57:20] and that's where we are built.
[2:57:25] I am I am built on who Jesus Christ
[2:57:30] when I know who Jesus Christ
[2:57:33] I know who I am. I know who I am.
[2:57:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; You know that old song was holy all hail
[2:57:47] me.
[2:57:49] You know it's a very old song.
[2:57:51] Hallelujah.
[2:57:52] You cannot defeat the church of God.
[2:57:58] That's who we are.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:58:04] Amen. I have five minutes I see.
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I I try to bring these things
[2:58:09] and finish it in a go. But are you
[2:58:12] enjoying this church?
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:58:16] &gt;&gt; And so they came out and they you know
[2:58:19] friends to close what I started.
[2:58:23] I said what is more important
[2:58:26] is that Christ will be seen.
[2:58:29] [Music]
[2:58:31] We are not here to introduce a man to
[2:58:33] people.
[2:58:35] We are here to introduce Christ.
[2:58:38] The one that can change our life.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; The one that died for us.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; The one that has made a difference.
[2:58:49] Amen. Amen.
[2:58:54] You know,
[2:58:57] in the last five years
[2:59:01] or so,
[2:59:03] whenever the Holy Spirit tells me stop,
[2:59:10] cuz I realized if I don't,
[2:59:15] then I am out of his will.
[2:59:18] So, I just stop here. Let us stand on
[2:59:19] our feet.
[2:59:27] Amen.
[2:59:30] Amen.
[2:59:32] I just wish that uh we can get deeper
[2:59:34] into this. Thank you for being so
[2:59:36] listening.
[2:59:40] And as you close your eyes,
[2:59:42] as musicians come, could you please
[2:59:45] think about what you have heard?
[2:59:48] Think about yourself.
[2:59:51] Is Christ
[2:59:53] being the preeminent one
[2:59:57] in your life?
[3:00:01] We need to come to that place.
[3:00:03] [Music]
[3:00:04] where it's not about you.
[3:00:07] It's about him
[3:00:10] because he's the one that made a way
[3:00:14] where there was no way.
[3:00:17] Many times our back hits the wall and we
[3:00:19] do not know what to do next.
[3:00:24] Sometimes don't even know what and who
[3:00:25] to trust.
[3:00:29] But I want to encourage you, friend.
[3:00:32] We have someone we can trust.
[3:00:35] &gt;&gt; Someone that died for us.
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And his name is Jesus Christ.
[3:00:42] And he's here this morning
[3:00:45] to make a way for you.
[3:00:48] Remember, he wants to be seen.
[3:00:50] He wants to be magnified.
[3:00:53] He wants to be glorified.
[3:00:56] Would you say, "Lord,
[3:00:58] come and make a way in me.
[3:01:00] Make a way for me.
[3:01:07] &gt;&gt; What if brother Shalom can come and help
[3:01:08] me sing?
[3:01:12] This is a moment where you talk to him
[3:01:14] silently.
[3:01:17] [Music]
[3:01:25] You
[3:01:29] [Music]
[3:01:33] made
[3:01:36] you
[3:01:42] take away
[3:01:46] with our backs against the
[3:01:50] [Music]
[3:01:57] You
[3:02:00] made it our way.
[3:02:03] [Music]
[3:02:07] And we are standing
[3:02:09] here
[3:02:12] only because
[3:02:14] you
[3:02:16] [Music]
[3:02:17] [Applause]
[3:02:19] listen church.
[3:02:21] If you can close your eyes
[3:02:25] about what we are singing now,
[3:02:30] I'll tell you why we sing this song.
[3:02:34] John cried and he wept.
[3:02:38] said, "Who is worthy?"
[3:02:41] And John found there was no one.
[3:02:45] No one was worthy.
[3:02:48] That means you
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; and I would be lost forever
[3:02:54] with no redeemer.
[3:03:00] But Jesus,
[3:03:03] Jesus Christ made a way.
[3:03:06] And we are standing here today

[3:40:05] report for this week, please?
[3:40:08] [Music]
[3:40:10] as that is coming.
[3:40:13] &gt;&gt; I wanted to let you know that we were at
[3:40:15] PDN
[3:40:19] uh this past week
[3:40:22] [Music]
[3:40:25] I don't remember how many of us went but
[3:40:27] I think
[3:40:30] brother
[3:40:31] [Music]
[3:40:32] and uh and who else? Who else went with
[3:40:36] us?
[3:40:39] These ones are the ones that usually
[3:40:41] work on the budget
[3:40:45] [Music]
[3:40:46] for the youth meetings.
[3:40:49] [Music]
[3:40:51] &gt;&gt; So uh we have got already a bill build
[3:40:55] to us um an invoice
[3:40:58] &gt;&gt; but
[3:41:02] I think PDN will be much cheaper for us.
[3:41:09] uh than what we spent last year,
[3:41:13] much lesser.
[3:41:15] &gt;&gt; So the hall is smaller than Chamogo
[3:41:19] University.
[3:41:24] But uh overall when you rate them on
[3:41:28] like most of the other amenities that we
[3:41:30] want,
[3:41:32] [Music]
[3:41:35] they are much better
[3:41:38] because um we we have a hall
[3:41:42] with all the equipment
[3:41:45] the the the sound
[3:41:48] but we take our our instruments
[3:41:52] And um then um so we get to spend on a
[3:41:55] few
[3:41:59] uh but they just give us a oneoff for
[3:42:02] the hall
[3:42:04] [Music]
[3:42:06] and then they um also remember the our
[3:42:10] friends in Nairobi they've always been
[3:42:12] finding a hotel renting outside.
[3:42:19] Uh, brother Joseph, I don't know where
[3:42:21] you are going to get this information.
[3:42:25] So, but these people have
[3:42:28] um an entire building
[3:42:33] furnished,
[3:42:36] &gt;&gt; beautiful uh beds and everything
[3:42:40] that the brethren in Kenya or here
[3:42:44] you have money
[3:42:47] and you want to pay
[3:42:49] so you can sleep comfortably.
[3:42:54] [Music]
[3:42:55] there those uh um that accommodation is
[3:42:59] there
[3:43:00] &gt;&gt; uh each room I think goes for about 130
[3:43:03] a night
[3:43:08] yeah for two nights many of you can
[3:43:11] afford really especially those of you
[3:43:14] with families
[3:43:16] if you want to be with your wife and
[3:43:17] children
[3:43:19] it would be advisable
[3:43:22] come and let us know
[3:43:24] &gt;&gt; so that we can be able to um to book a
[3:43:27] room for you.
[3:43:30] &gt;&gt; So we we see that all the Kenyans will
[3:43:31] sleep there.
[3:43:33] Those that will be able to come usually
[3:43:36] have 30 representatives or more. I don't
[3:43:38] know how many will come this time.
[3:43:42] Then also um we have they have also more
[3:43:46] rooms they constructed.
[3:43:48] I think they also have other cheaper
[3:43:49] ones.
[3:43:54] The ones who don't want luxury, who just
[3:43:56] need a bed,
[3:43:57] &gt;&gt; they can als you can also find
[3:43:59] they are very limited.
[3:44:04] So you need to inform us
[3:44:08] ahead of time for booking.
[3:44:11] You cannot come in the week of the
[3:44:13] meetings and say I want a room.
[3:44:19] the other people will use the holes
[3:44:23] like we did last time.
[3:44:26] So if you want to sleep comfortably
[3:44:29] in a family group or something like
[3:44:30] that, let us know so that we can make
[3:44:34] that means you must be able to pay
[3:44:38] separately.
[3:44:40] Separately listen separately from the
[3:44:42] camp fee.
[3:44:48] You understand that?
[3:44:50] &gt;&gt; So, but um the rest of the people when
[3:44:52] they pay fee, of course, we'll get them
[3:44:54] those holes where they can sleep.
[3:44:58] So, um and also we we have areas where
[3:45:01] we can make our guests sleep.
[3:45:06] So, it's a good place overall when you
[3:45:09] consider all those things.
[3:45:12] Last year, we missed it because we were
[3:45:14] late. Someone else booked it.
[3:45:19] So we are not going to miss it this
[3:45:21] time.
[3:45:22] I told you we already have two confirmed
[3:45:24] guests from Australia
[3:45:28] Australia going to come and be our
[3:45:30] speakers
[3:45:32] and then we also expect um another one.
[3:45:35] I'll let you know.
[3:45:38] I just still working on that. That's why
[3:45:40] we have delayed to send out our
[3:45:44] announcements.
[3:45:47] But also this land fund, it's been our
[3:45:49] priority.
[3:45:51] [Music]
[3:45:53] So we wanted to first get it out of the
[3:45:54] way.
[3:45:58] Amen. So we will I think in the
[3:46:00] following weeks we will let you know
[3:46:03] the budget.
[3:46:05] Um the brother I think he's still
[3:46:08] working on it.
[3:46:11] Now um
[3:46:14] I want to first of all appreciate
[3:46:18] &gt;&gt; the givers, the ones who are consistent.
[3:46:22] May God bless you so much.
[3:46:26] [Applause]
[3:46:28] Amen.
[3:46:31] Um, Martin Luther gave 729
[3:46:36] [Music]
[3:46:38] and that is because we had a brother, a
[3:46:40] friend of ours
[3:46:45] uh from from Kenya
[3:46:47] &gt;&gt; who gave 510
[3:46:51] 52
[3:46:52] something.
[3:46:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:46:56] &gt;&gt; And and contributed towards our land
[3:46:58] fund. And this is not his first time.
[3:47:02] People love DVF
[3:47:05] &gt;&gt; and much of these funds we've not raised
[3:47:07] alone
[3:47:10] because much of this congregation is
[3:47:12] young people really,
[3:47:15] a few employed
[3:47:19] and uh so it is the grace of God
[3:47:23] and it will be the grace of God all
[3:47:25] through
[3:47:28] and It is by faith.
[3:47:32] Let me tell you without faith you cannot
[3:47:33] do such things like
[3:47:38] a church
[3:47:40] four years old
[3:47:44] 80% young people
[3:47:47] raising 99 million
[3:47:51] in four years. Isn't that a miracle?
[3:47:59] It's a miracle.
[3:48:01] It's a miracle.
[3:48:03] Not because we have a lot,
[3:48:06] but because God is helping us.
[3:48:10] Is that a man?
[3:48:12] So as a as for as a our target the
[3:48:15] brother already announced
[3:48:18] we need 166,000
[3:48:21] [Music]
[3:48:23] to fill up um uh the 100 million.
[3:48:28] I need that now
[3:48:33] so that you leave
[3:48:36] when you know on Wednesday
[3:48:38] we are making that transaction.
[3:48:44] [Music]
[3:48:47] Yeah.
[3:48:48] [Music]
[3:49:03] I I don't need two or three. I need one
[3:49:05] person.
[3:49:08] One person.
[3:49:21] No, not like that. What I'm saying, I
[3:49:23] need one brother or one sister.
[3:49:27] From a manga.
[3:49:29] I don't know whether we are streaming.
[3:49:31] This should not be from
[3:49:34] this should be from among us.
[3:49:36] [Music]
[3:49:40] 60,000.
[3:49:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:49:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much.
[3:49:56] [Music]
[3:50:02] family.
[3:50:06] May God bless you. May God bless you.
[3:50:10] We're going to pray blessing for you.
[3:50:15] This money we are giving for buying
[3:50:17] land.
[3:50:20] This is how we sow our seeds.
[3:50:24] Others
[3:50:25] you don't even have a box to break. This
[3:50:29] is your now you are saving
[3:50:33] because whatever you pay to the work of
[3:50:36] God. You are lending he must pay you
[3:50:40] back.
[3:50:42] You have swn in God's work. He has to
[3:50:45] return. Do we believe that?
[3:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:50:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you so much sister.
[3:50:54] So I want to announce
[3:50:57] brother where the treasurers
[3:51:01] please stand up quickly.
[3:51:03] [Music]
[3:51:08] Those are the treasurers. You meet them.
[3:51:12] We need that money either today or
[3:51:14] tomorrow
[3:51:16] &gt;&gt; so that we round off the 100 million
[3:51:18] shillings. Then
[3:51:24] &gt;&gt; there is another money which we used in
[3:51:26] the youth camp.
[3:51:28] &gt;&gt; It is too much.
[3:51:30] It is more than 30 million.
[3:51:32] &gt;&gt; Some of the money we have paid.
[3:51:35] [Music]
[3:51:36] There is still another lumpsum which is
[3:51:38] remaining.
[3:51:40] But I want to appreciate sister Esther.
[3:51:45] Sister Esther
[3:51:49] [Music]
[3:51:50] Sister
[3:51:56] to talk about it.
[3:51:58] &gt;&gt; But Sister Esther,
[3:52:01] she's one of the brethren in the church
[3:52:04] said, "Pastor,
[3:52:06] I'm going to help you carry."
[3:52:09] And she gave money that is not small.
[3:52:14] I want us to clap for her.
[3:52:17] Sister
[3:52:18] God bless you, Sister Esther.
[3:52:22] &gt;&gt; And
[3:52:25] Amen. Amen.
[3:52:28] [Music]
[3:52:30] &gt;&gt; Sister Mary, she's not around.
[3:52:37] She gave me an amount and said, "This is
[3:52:39] the match. I believe I will support on
[3:52:40] that."
[3:52:43] &gt;&gt; There was another brother Ken.
[3:52:45] He gave an million and 50,000
[3:52:49] to help on the 30 million.
[3:52:52] There was still some big money
[3:52:54] remaining.
[3:52:56] I don't want to tell it to you to
[3:52:58] discourage you
[3:53:03] or to make you starting
[3:53:06] [Music]
[3:53:15] But we are failing. We have failed.
[3:53:18] If you want to know the total
[3:53:22] ask with an intention of giving
[3:53:24] something,
[3:53:26] come and meet me,
[3:53:28] pastor, how much barre
[3:53:31] meet the treasurers. You ask them,
[3:53:34] they'll tell you. Then you make a pledge
[3:53:37] on what you want to
[3:53:40] this Wednesday.
[3:53:45] God gives us the grace and love all the
[3:53:47] money
[3:53:50] to pay 100
[3:53:53] million Uganda money
[3:53:57] [Applause]
[3:53:58] [Music]
[3:54:02] and there will be a balance of 120
[3:54:05] millions Uganda money.
[3:54:10] &gt;&gt; I'm requesting you for two things. So
[3:54:13] &gt;&gt; the first thing
[3:54:17] &gt;&gt; let us double our weekly contributions.
[3:54:21] [Music]
[3:54:22] We are more than able
[3:54:25] to buy this land
[3:54:29] but with unity
[3:54:34] there is no money that is too small.
[3:54:37] [Music]
[3:54:38] whatever you have. I've heard people
[3:54:41] saying, "Oh, they say, "Brother Brian,
[3:54:44] $5,000,
[3:54:49] but then you give nothing."
[3:54:54] It is also equally ashamed.
[3:54:57] If it is 5,000, you can
[3:55:00] in that week, give it.
[3:55:04] If it is 2,000,
[3:55:06] brother, count for me.
[3:55:08] If someone gives 2,000 share
[3:55:12] every week,
[3:55:14] how much is that in a month?
[3:55:19] Quick math. 8,000.
[3:55:23] How much is that in a year?
[3:55:25] [Music]
[3:55:32] 720
[3:55:38] [Music]
[3:55:43] Brother, are you right? Are you sure?
[3:55:48] &gt;&gt; Let me count again.
[3:55:52] Someone has given 2,000
[3:55:58] in four weeks.
[3:56:01] That's one month.
[3:56:03] 8,000
[3:56:06] &gt;&gt; in 12 months.
[3:56:10] &gt;&gt; 96,000,000.
[3:56:24] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[3:56:27] brother.
[3:56:28] [Music]
[3:56:35] Okay.
[3:56:43] [Music]
[3:56:50] There is an example I want to give you.
[3:56:52] How old are you, brother?
[3:56:58] Come.
[3:57:07] There's something I'm trying to impress
[3:57:08] on you. Come, come here, brother.
[3:57:17] [Music]
[3:57:24] Okay. Okay. Which class are you in?
[3:57:29] He's also in P7.
[3:57:32] Oh, so all the students we have here in
[3:57:33] P7. Okay, no problem. Let me use him as
[3:57:36] an example.
[3:57:38] Um, if you is it possible for you to
[3:57:42] work while you're going at school to
[3:57:44] find something to do maybe for mommy in
[3:57:46] her project or daddy or somewhere or the
[3:57:48] village or whatever and make some money?
[3:57:50] Is it possible?
[3:57:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. How much can you make in a week,
[3:57:56] in a day or in a week?
[3:57:59] [Music]
[3:58:03] You can make
[3:58:06] in in one week.
[3:58:09] &gt;&gt; Being a generous man that you are,
[3:58:12] &gt;&gt; how much can you give towards the
[3:58:13] church?
[3:58:18] [Music]
[3:58:26] Now brother, let us count for you.
[3:58:31] In a week
[3:58:34] 4,500 in a week
[3:58:37] times 4
[3:58:41] you would have given 18,000 shillings
[3:58:44] in one in one month
[3:58:47] time 12.
[3:58:50] Do you see how much you would have given
[3:58:51] in one year?
[3:58:54] Have you ever given towards the land
[3:58:55] fund?
[3:58:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:59:01] You've not yet given anything?
[3:59:04] You have not yet had
[3:59:08] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, okay. Am I speaking like a
[3:59:10] French man?
[3:59:12] Have you ever given anything towards the
[3:59:15] land fund?
