TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Um the song that I am about to sing is talking about the blood which I believe as we have heard that as long as we have the blood as long as we have the token upon us Satan has nothing over us. That is what I believe and that is my testimony and my confession today because many will be our afflictions but we believe that he will deliver us whenever your spirit is low. Just remember the blood &gt;&gt; that speaks for you. Please brother, put it on the screen. You can't cross the bloodline. So that you may look at the lyrics and may the song go deep in your heart as it has gone to me. Even though my spirit's low and it seems but still I see victory many times. times I'm walking by faith. Can see what lies before me, but still I see victory. And I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stare and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Cuz remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Sometimes our battles get hot and it seems we fighting a lot. Oh, I remember I'm standing on the rock. So, Satan, if I were you, I'd turn around and give up to cause. I do believe you're bound to lose. Oh, and I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his. Oh, and you may stare and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. So remember, you can't cross the bloodline. I've been sealed by predestination, by the lamb's great revelation chosen before the world began. So devil, don't try to shake me. For the word that lives inside me is the same that conquered death and hell. And I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stare and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. goes remember you can't cross the bloodline I remind you anient serpent this word made flesh and present and the blood still speaks for me. You may roar and bring your treasure, but the token is my shelter. And you'll never cross the blood, you see. Oh, and I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stare and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Cuz remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Oh, and I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stare and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Go. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Oh, you may stir and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Cuz remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Amen.

And how many are ready for it or you praise God? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I told the brothers that every preacher has just uh finished the devil. Goliath is dead. So we need to have pastor Maher come AND CUT OFF THE BUT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, brother Isaac should prepare for that event. How many agree to that? Listen, brother Isaac was our first come speaker. And I said, I've seen him preach before. I always thought he has not given us his best I still believe the same. So but meanwhile I just want him to come and greet us and maybe you know a word or two and then we will take it up from there. God bless you man of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I say praise the Lord. I say hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are we happy to be young people? Touch on somebody. Tell him I'm happy to be. ARE YOU AMEN. AMEN. Touch another one. Tell him I'm happy to be a young person. Amen. Amen. This is my greeting to the camp and the Nairobi team. I want to know I appreciate you for coming. Um I would have been very lonesome if I came alone &gt;&gt; and I request that the support we have given pastor TMO from DVF camp first to fourth we continue that way but because of of the constant of time I want to just greet with a scripture that is in proverbs chapter 29 chapter 20 and verse 29 we can read while seated so that I don't get that is proverbs chapter 20 and verse 29 only and I think the brothers that came from Nairobi who are not necessarily young people they and bear me witness. I told them our DVF meetings are not all only about youth. Is that true? It's I told them our DF meetings is like a convention for everyone. So be sure if you call for another one on time, we proverbs chapter 20 verse 29. Are we there? &gt;&gt; The glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of the old man is the gray head. Can we read together one to go? The glory of the young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the gray hair. Hallelujah. So, so I see in Nairobi old men and old women when they develop gray hair, they try to paint it black because they want to remain young. And this is an inspiration because WHERE WE ARE GOING THERE WILL BE NO GRAY HAIR BECAUSE WE SHALL BE 19. COME ON SOMEBODY SAY PRAISE THE LORD WHERE WE ARE GOING THERE WILL BE NO OLD MEN. WE WE ARE PREPARING OURSELVES FOR A YOUTH CAMP and and old MEN ARE NOT INVITED. SO MAY THE OLD MAN START turning young. If you FEEL OLD EXERCISE TO BE YOUNG BECAUSE WE ARE GOING FOREVER, WE SHALL BE YOUNG FOREVER. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. I AM HAPPY TO BE YOUNG. PRAISE THE LORD. AND YOU FIND YOUNG PEOPLE, YOUNG MEN, THEY WANT TO BEHAVE like good old men. YOU FIND YOUNG MEN, 25 YEARS, THEY ARE WEARING CLOTHES HERE. THEY ARE OLD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DRESS LIKE A YOUNG MAN. BE PROUD WHEN YOU HALLELUJAH. My little greeting. I want to call it young people on assignment. WE ARE YOUNG GENERATION BUT WE HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT NOT TO BE CHURCH MEMBERS NOT to be followers of Christ. Oh, we we ARE we don't want GUIL DEMONS is not for YOU FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE taken the MESSAGE become the message. Hallelujah. Are you GETTING WHAT I'M SAYING? WE ARE GOING NOT GOING TO THE HEAVEN WITH THE AFFILIATIONS THE GROUPS GROUP. NO GROUP, NO GROUP IS GOING IN THE TRUE BELIEF with the Holy GHOST to take A HOLD OF ME, CHANGE THEM FROM. So we are on AN ASSIGNMENT NOT TO be church MEMBERS YOUNG PEOPLE. WE ARE IN THE MESSAGE TO SET TO A CHURCH LEVEL. We are not TO SET WE HAVE A HIGHER CALLING. WE HAVE A HIGHER CALLING. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS FORGETTING THE THINGS that are in. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FORGETTING THE THINGS THAT ARE we have before us. YOU KNOW WHY? WE ARE THE FINISHING GENERATION. WE ARE THE FINAL GENERATION. AFTER US, THE CHANGING OF the body. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, my time is up. YOUNG PEOPLE ON AN ASSIGNMENT. So if you have settled a church, I BELONG IN THIS CHURCH AND I AM SATISFIED. We are CLIMBING HIGHER. WE ARE climbing higher. OUR calling is higher. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why we HAVE SAID the glory of the YOUNG MEN IS THEIR STRENGTH. USE YOUR STRENGTH THE WORKS OF JESUS CHRIST. USE YOUR STRENGTH TO PREACH THE MESSAGE. LET UGANDA KNOW that the rapture power. We shall not WIN THE WORLD BY GIVING THEM THE BIBLES and spoken word books. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND TAPES THEY HAVE their place. That's right. &gt;&gt; But we SHALL WIN THE WORLD WHEN THIS WORD BECOMES FLESH. HALLELUJAH. IN OTHER WORDS, WE SHALL go beyond saying what the says. I KNOW THAT IS HARD TO SAY, BUT WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND SAY WHAT THE WE MUST BECOME. WE MUST BE THE VOICE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. Young man, there's no time for water. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY. OH, THE preacher has come. Let's finish. Let's finish. Let's finish. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let me FINISH HERE. I have only three minutes and I have to DROP THIS IN YOU. THE POWER to become what God wanted you TO is not WITH PASTOR MAH AND NOT WITH BROTHER ISA AND NOT WITH PASTOR MICHAEL. THE POWER IS WITHIN YOU. THEY DIDN'T GET THAT. THE POWER TO become what GOD WANTS YOU TO BE. IS NOT WITHIN THE PREACHER. What we do as MINISTRY to bring THE so that you look at the mirror. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO THE BIBLE MUST BECOME FLESH. THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR MUST WALK IN WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU THAT IS MY GLORY. AMEN. Glory to God. Woo! Amen. &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. My my my cut off the head of Goliath. Well, if he has cut off, pastor Mah will just carry Goliath and take him to the pit. GLORY. Praise the Lord. The Lord is with us. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Isaac. That was tremendous. Amen. You know what? We are not part of any camp. When you are you are about to think that we are of the WORD GROUP. THEN YOU will find out. We are also the Holy Ghost group. When you when you thinking we are ONLY OF THE WORD, THEN YOU BEGIN TO FIND OUT we are also BELIEVING THE THUNDER. SO THEN THEN YOU GET CONFUSED. THE REASON IS ALL THESE THINGS ARE IN THE MESSAGE AND WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN THINKING THAT IS ONLY this you know teachings that we believe then you begin to realize we are different CLASS OF PEOPLE. WE are here to manifest the life of the message. BY THE WAY, THE MESSAGE, THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE THAT WE MIGHT BECOME, not that we might believe, we might become. If you realize ALL THESE MEN, I'VE just been preaching that. I hope you'll carry it with you TO AMEN. AMEN. Be seated, please. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is for you, Pastor Maher, &gt;&gt; because you're just going to take the platform short. There is a prayer request. There's a sister called Jamaima. She requests prayer for her auntie. She's suffering from breast cancer. They have tried every doctor, every hospital, but the sickness could not. I trust in the Lord that he can set her free because he's the Lord that he heals all manner of diseases. There is nothing to hurt. Amen. Could you pass it on to him? You just remember to pray for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And before we I'm going to have sister Juel come. uh she's uh there's a song I think pastor wants you to sing and while you are coming allow me because this is the only time after the word I don't know what will happen so I just wanted to take a moment or a few moments to appreciate the brothers and sisters men and women or from our church DVF that have really really made this come. Normally I would have them come but because of time I'm going to have them stand. Whatever you are which whichever department you are please stand. I don't know if everybody's inside is inside please stand come inside the church and stand and even those who are still outside please we've had those you know we we have many departments that has been making this possible we have the welfare doing the food accommodation how was The food by the way was it was good. I know in Uganda we b we boast of good food. I would have been very sad if I didn't hear anyone clapping. Even someone I know who is very difficult to please appreciate. Yeah. So we thank God for the brothers and the sisters. I will not for fear of forgetting. No remain standing all of you. Brother Baka you're seated please if you are part of this time and for fear of forgetting anybody I'm not going to mention names uh you know those who have been doing the music we have a lot of brothers and sisters and sisters singing all of you God bless you if you appreciate whatever they have done it's there are those that have been doing the logistics moving and especially the two brothers. I'll set true to my commitment. I will not mention names because I don't have names here and I will forget some names but I appreciate you those and God sees your God bless you. I mean those brothers who have even been driving the pastors you know and to make sure that you know everything they're comfortable and and of course there are also those who uh gave us cars uh you know parents of the young people in our church some of them are here I think um I saw brother wonder where is he outside. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's the because he's not part of your group. That's why I was mentioning him. &gt;&gt; And his wife, is she here? &gt;&gt; Okay. Is he the one? No. &gt;&gt; No. Okay. So, well, tell him I appreciate him. I know he's out. We appreciate him. Let us give him a clap. And uh also, Pastor and Mrs. We appreciate these two gave us cars and I know there are other brothers who have been using you know their own cars. We appreciate all the media team. We appreciate you. They had issues with the internet in the beginning but I think it is now sorted. We appreciate you very much. reception team. They told me they had some issues with some brethren. People are coming and say we still pay fee and the brother told me I I almost became angry. But I humbled myself and I told myself explain to the brother I don't know whether it was a sister &gt;&gt; but you know why? because to him it was a shock that this person did not know that he's supposed to support where he is coming for a camp. I hope there is going to come a time when all you young people will appreciate that fact that uh you have to support the work of God. Don't never want anything for free. The word is not for free, but you receive it freely. When you eat food, it's going to be bought. This place is rented. It's not the accommodations you sleep at are paid. So, if you don't want to contribute, who will pay that? So we have to be co-workers in the body. Amen. Uh the interpreters some of them their voices died. I thought I have a very good interpreter. Pastor Maher just busted his voice. But we appreciate all the interpreters the deacons and the ashers. God bless you. Uh the medical team, we have some doctors but I'll not mention names the brother and the nurses those who have been working in the sanitation technical and also taking care of the visitors in terms of food. Let us give these brothers and sisters. Amen. Now the team that put up all this, this was designed by a brother in our church. It's not from outside and it was printed by a brother in our church. We appreciate all the the God bless you. And now allow me that uh we will now go for the last for the last lap. Are we ready for it? &gt;&gt; You know when pastor Maher is preaching, it is okay for you. But for those of us preachers, you start wondering, am I a preacher? What am I going to preach at? you know, he's a the preaching machine. And you know, what one thing I love about his ministry is that he's deep ON THE WORD. HE doesn't go on the surface. He's deep on the word and uh we we appreciate the gift of God in you and uh pray that uh as we close these meetings, you will receive your last portion. after this service we are going to go uh we we will try to see if the Dick Gideon &gt;&gt; let me also join me to appreciate this young man &gt;&gt; very wonderful young man he works for this facility but he's pretty much been part of us through the meetings and I've seen him enjoying everyone and so he will be together with our team setting at the at the at the campfire. What we're going to do there is testimonies. If you have something God has done for you, come share it. Um if you have a song you do not sing, you know, fellowship, that's what we going to do. We'll do it until we are tired. You go sleep and then in the morning we will have a little breakfast for those who are coming. so that we can dismiss you. So the Lord bless you. Sister Joel, the floor is yours. As the pastor prepares to come, &gt;&gt; Pastor Maher, &gt;&gt; please come again. How many want him to come again? Amen. This was just a little tour. despie the land. I hope you can go back and tell them the land is flow with milk and honey. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister Joe. God saw himself in flesh even before creation. His purpose was redemption. God always saw himself in flesh. Even before creation, the lamb was lame before the foundation of the world. as Elohim. He thought it all. Mechis created the world but in Jesus he expressed it love to us. Oh, I follow him. He thoughts it all. Me created the world. But in Jesus, he expressed love to us. We're on a journey that started in the mind of God and we land in a glorified body. Keep on descending so we can ascend. We're on a journey that started in the mind of God and we landed a glorified body. He conscended so we can ascend. The bride was the mystery hidden go even before creation to be expressed in another body. Yes, the bride was the mistreating God even before creation to be expressed in another body before redemption. And now the word herself takes the word itself and reveals the self in itself. quickening the scriptures that's been written about her. In other word herself, it's the word itself and reveals herself in itself. We can in the scriptures that's been written about her. We're on We're on a journey that started in the mind of God and we landed a glorified body descended so we can ascend. We're on a journey that started in the mind of God and we land in a glorified body. He descended so we can ascend. The bride was the mystery hiddening God even before creation to be expressed in another body. Yes. The bride was the mystery held in God even before creation to be expressed in another body for redemption. Now the word herself is the word itself and reveals itself in itself. awaken in the scriptures that's been written about her. Now the bride herself takes the word itself and reveal herself in itself weakening the scriptures that's been written about her. We're on a journey that started in the mind of God and we landed a glorified body. He condescended so we can ascend on a journey that started in the mind of God and we landed a glorified body. We condescended so we can ascend. And Jesus sending word upon word, truth upon truth, word upon word. And Jesus said word upon word, truth upon truth, word upon word. Thank you Lord. Word upon word, truth upon you. We rejoice with your word upon truth upon you. Thank you, Lord. What up, truth upon you. We rejoice to see your lift in your pool. What a power truth upon you. Now the bride of self takes the word itself and reveals herself in itself. Praise the Lord. That sister is the jewel. &gt;&gt; Let's put our hands together. &gt;&gt; You see when they are coming to South Africa, she might not go back to Kenya. She is too good a singer. I don't tell the young men in my church who to marry and who not to marry. But on this one, I will have to break my oath. She is just a gift. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was a little disappointed. &gt;&gt; The bass was too loud. You know, you know, even in Benoni, we struggle with bass players and sometimes the bass drowns the voice. I'm a music person myself. So you must always balance the sound to the voice so we don't lose the message in entertainment. But we forgot to acknowledge our musicians. Let's put our hands together for them. I would like to give special acknowledgement to the sister who was playing bass in previous services. In the past two services I heard you playing leadh where is that sister city? &gt;&gt; She she she plays Oh, is it? Yeah, I saw she switched. She is really gifted &gt;&gt; and we appreciate God for her. Uh it's been an absolute pleasure to be here. I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. I would like to appreciate for the invitation, for the confidence and for arranging such a successful youth meeting. I see that uh the people are even more and more coming. I'm sure if there was tomorrow again, the place will be more packed than it is. It shows that uh God is honoring the vision by vindicating it. May you be blessed with your family, &gt;&gt; with your children, with your ministry. He He was a blessing when he came to South Africa. There's a reason why God opens doors for a man. It is because the favor of God is upon his life. And when you have such a man in your midst, don't try to stand in his way. If you are opposed to him, stand aside. But you would do better if you put your shoulders together with him. Brother Brham says, "Don't mock the man with don't try to tackle the man with the ball." If you're playing for the same team, support the man with the ball and God bless you. You might be the youngest pastor in Kala, but your heart is in the right place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We wouldn't have come if he was a scandalous man. But we also have a bit of discernment about us to know a man that is standing for the right. God bless you. Thank you for connecting me to a lot of friends here in Uganda. Ugandan friends and friends from Ethiopia, friends from Australia, Australia, Ethiopia, all because of brother Bas. We appreciate God so much. And uh you know when he preached in in Perth, he he called me &gt;&gt; to ask me do you know a pastor called Pastor Michael? I said from where? I already knew where he's going. He says from Australia. &gt;&gt; I said what about him? He says he's just like you. &gt;&gt; I said you are not the first person to say that. &gt;&gt; No, he was 20 years late. &gt;&gt; That call was 20 years late and we appreciate God and uh appreciate uh you know pastor Michael's ministration in the morning. Amen. That was sobering. Uh you see you need that when you have a meeting. You must have every aspect of our Christian life addressed. Introspection is one of those things. He was showing us how to get to perfect realization. The pathway to purpose. How you have to know yourself that even by knowing yourself, death becomes a pleasure. Amen. &gt;&gt; That when Christ knew his purpose, death became a pleasure. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; and brother Josh came and picked it up in Matthew 17, the adoption of Christ in on Matthew in in John chapter 4, in John chapter one actually when he's baptized, it's actually his birth, he receives the Holy Ghost. The lamp is being washed. And he just say this is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in full stop. And brother Brennham says your birth is not your adoption. The new birth is the earnest. In other words, it's the down payment. But when he comes to Matthew 17, He is moving into the full stature of the ministry of who he was because remember there was the man part and the God part. So the man part had to go through everything that you and me go through. He says he learned obedience through the things that he suffered. So he was suffering even through his life growing up to come to Matthew 17 where he is no longer saying I'm pleased to dwell in him but there was a voice transfer to say ye him. And the Bible says from that time, he began TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW THE son of man must suffer and how he's supposed to be killed, which was the purpose of his coming. It was to die on the cross, but he could not preach it until he comes to the maturity. So maturity is understanding that suffering is part of the package. That's why Paul would be told if you go to Jerusalem you will die. The prophecy by Agabas but he says to leave is Christ is to die IS GAIN RUN THE RACE. I FINISHED MY COURSE AND THEY AWAIT ME A CLOUD AND reward for the life I HAVE LIVED. IF HE SLAYS ME, I'LL still praise him. That level of maturity comes with the correct teaching. That's what pastor Michael was talking about. The reason why sometimes we have got the lake of the new birth says it is because of wrong teaching. Your teaching about the matter is wrong. That's why you also have an airship of ministers that fall along the way. It's because of the lack of the new birth. And the lack of the new birth is also because of the lack of correct teeth. Because when you are born, you are a baby. If you preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost as if it's the climax, you will end up into Nikolitism where you as the pastor will want to do the work of the Holy Ghost because you'll be disappointed with the PEOPLE not knowing that WHEN THEY ARE BORN THEY ARE BABIES. AND THEY ARE UNDER TTORS AND GOVERNORS UNTIL brother Brandham says you see that boy he DIDN'T GET FAR BECAUSE HE DIDN'T grow in the Holy Ghost. So with the HOLY GHOST YOU STILL STUMBLE. You still fall. WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU STUMBLE AND YOU FALL. BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THE HOLY GHOST BRINGS YOU UP every time. IT CHECKS YOUR LIFE. IT TEACHES YOU. THE REASON WHY IT'S A TEACHER IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. FOR RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN ELDER MAKES YOU A BABY. AMEN. We are not preaching it. So that was pastor Michael. Thank you Michael. MY FRIEND HE WAS CHARGING ME THERE WHILE I'M SITTING THERE. We appreciate God. We appreciate God, &gt;&gt; brother Josh. &gt;&gt; If ever you stole my heart, this afternoon I was sitting there, you stole my heart. You know you have preached well. When a pastor forgets about the people that are being preached to and he starts thinking about his church back home, he say, "I wish the people in Benoni can hear what this man is preaching." That's a message up my street. 100% the word. You were in your elements. And I can tell you, brother Josh, say this is your first trip to Africa. There's going to be many trips like this. I'm telling you, brother Josh. It is unlimited what God can do with a man. He can surrender himself the way you have surrendered. No man is able to put things together the way you did. Bless God be with you. God bless you. Bless your family. We really appreciate God. Amen. &gt;&gt; My friend, brother, he wanted to take over. I've never seen such a small man with such energy. I preached, pastor Michael preached, BIG BROTHER JOSH PREACHED. Platform never vibrated LIKE AND EVEN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VIBRATING. There's no demon here now. I'm telling you, THERE'S NO DEMON. IF THE DEMON OF SLEEPING IS NOT HERE, IF YOU THINK I'M LYING, try to sleep right now and see. TRY IT. TRY IT RIGHT NOW. SLEEPING AND SEE OUT. SICKNESS HAVE BEEN CAST OUT. BIG THING HAS BEEN PASSED. HALLELUJAH. I have enjoyed being here and we really appreciate God. Appreciate all of you for all you have done. Taking us from the airport feeding us up until this hour. Everything you have done, we appreciate it with my fellow ministers here at the bottom of our hearts. We appreciate you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you so much. I think I want to reiterate where where is sister shalom and sister Mary are they here? Sister Shalom and Sister Mary. They're not here. Okay, they will get it on the stream. These sisters have been special. The the reason why they are not here most probably they're busy preparing what we are going to eat and they have been serving us so well and very persuasive. Do you know that persuasion is a gift? Uh one day I'll preach a message called the power of persuasion. You see, if you look at Paul, he speaks like an apostle, a chief apostle. And you you you you need a certain temperament to speak in that tone. It's direct. It's deep. It's bold. It's fearless when you are in that position. And he he says I boast in the profession of my calling. He says I'm here not for the fellowship of flesh and blood fellowship of the mystery. He says I went to a certain place. I met some brothers who had received the faith before me. I with them for 14 days. I thought I would learn something from them but I learned nothing. and I shook their hands and I departed from that place. THAT is Paul SPEAKING IN THE BOLDNESS of his ministry. But when he was in prison, there was a man that he was imprisoned with. His name was called Onismas and he started fellowshipping with Onismas and converted Onismas. But Onismas was in prison because he had stolen from a brother from Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the brother he had stolen from was called Filimon. AND THEN PAUL WRITES TO FILIMON AND HE DOESN'T WRITE AS PAUL an apostle. HE CHANGES HIS TONE. HE SAYS, "PAUL, I write as Paul the aged." HE'S NO LONGER WRITING AS PAUL THE FIRE BRAND. I REBUKE OF SAYING BEFORE I ARRIVED IN CORINTH, I HAVE ALREADY JUDGED THE MATTER AND I'M TELLING YOU, I DON'T WANT TO FIND THAT BROTHER THERE. SUCH A ONE MUST BE PUT IN THE HANDS OF THE KING. THE LANGUAGE CHANGES. HE IS writing persuading filimony TO SAY I THOUGHT I WAS SAVING A SENTENCE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS A CAUSE AND OCCASION for the bringing in of Jesus. My brother, he has ruined you, BUT LAY NOT HIS CHARGE UPON HIMSELF. BUT IF EVER I MEANT ANYTHING TO YOU, PUT THE CREDIT IN MY BANK ACCOUNT AND RECEIVE SUCH A ONE AS A BROTHER, NOT A CHRISTIAN of persuasion. These sisters were coming with all sorts of Ugandan food. The way they persuaded us to eat. I was on a video call with my wife just now. She said, "You have gained weight. I tried to put a the phone at an angle to try to make myself slim. She said that angle is not helping our sisters. Amen. Amen. Let us stand up on our feet. And uh we appreciate yesterday. He was now preaching but it was all for a good cause. And I believe God will give us a good time today. Everything has been done. Everything has been preached. So I'm just going to preach a little extra. You know, when we talk about extra, it means we're finished already. So my title is the mystery of extra. We just doing the little extra. Genesis. Uh Genesis is my favorite book. My second favorite is the book of Revelation. And when Pastor Michael kept going into the book of Luke of the Gospels, I love Luke so much. You know, Luke was different because Luke never walked with Jesus. I know when when people are told to name the 12 disciples, they include Luke there. If ever we have an examined, you put Luke, I'll give you a zero. Luke was a convert of Paul, not a Jew. He was a Samaritan. His perspective of Jesus of all of them. He looked at Jesus as a different man. He had the men anointing. He was a gentile like you and me. Okay, let me not talk about that. We'll talk about it some other time. When I come back to Ukraine, No, I really love this place. I enjoy it. But uh let me not promise. You see, if you want to be loved, you must discuss. If you are too available, even in a relationship, too much availability breathes contempt. Sisters, are you CATCHING THE MYSTERY? WHEN YOU ARE AVAILABLE for everything, appear and disappear, you will be lovable. Genesis 24 1 and Abraham was old and well stricken in age. Sorry. Sorry. When Abraham was old and well stricken in age, and the Lord had blessed him in all things. Verse verses one. And Abraham said unto his elder servants of his house that ruled over all that he had, put I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh. And I will make this whereby the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell. Let's bow our heads. Father, we thank you. We've read what we believe to be your scripture. Anointed that it may be spiritfilled spoken words. Hide me in the shadow of the cross. Make me narrow in the wisdom of men. Let Christ and him alone be the one projected. In Jesus mighty name. Amen. And amen. And you may be seated. &gt;&gt; I wanted to say anytime these two brothers are invited, if you want me to be a third speaker, I agree. Uh it's it's not everyone you can share a convention and it goes well. It takes men of kindred spirit and I've been honored to share the convention. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to verses six of the same chapter. I didn't want to read everything while you are standing. And Abraham said unto him, "Beware that thou bring not my son fither again. Uh, it said that again &gt;&gt; again for the second time. And the Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and swear unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then. Amen. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. &gt;&gt; We're back to the statement again. Only bring not my son thither again. again means for the second time means in the mystery of life at some point Isaac was in Mesopotamia ABRAHAM DOESN'T want Isaac TO GO BACK THERE AGAIN SAYING, "Just bring the bride. Don't take my son again." &gt;&gt; And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter. Okay, maybe let's read a bit faster. The servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand. And he rose and went to Moses unto the city of N. demand his camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water. He said, "Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water, and the daughters of men of the city come out to draw water. Let it come to pass that the danszel to whom I shall say, let down thy pitch, I pray thee, that I may drink, and she shall say, drink. Now I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be be she that thou has appointed unto thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master. IT CAME TO PASS BEFORE HE HAD DONE speaking that behold Rebecca came out who was born to Bethuuel son of Mila the wife of Nahol Abraham's brother with her picture upon his shoulder and the damsel was fair to look upon. A virgin neither had any men known her. She went down to the well, filled her picture and came out. The servant ran to meet her and said, "Let me I pray thee a little water of thy picture." And she said, "Drink, my lord." And she hasted and let down a pitch upon hand and gave him drink. USA. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I'll draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking. She emptied and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels. Amen. Nangua. Now, Genesis chapter 24 is a special scripture. I think all the preachers have touched on it. This scripture is an end time scripture. IT IS A TIMELESS PARABLE. The way it is written, IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE MOSES TAKES THE PERSONALITY OF THE PERSON IN the play when he's writing it. You know, Moses wrote the pentat or the Torah, the first five books of the Bible. BUT THERE IS CERTAIN THINGS THAT MOSES WOULD DO AS HE'S WRITING. HE WOULD TAKE THE PERSONALITIES OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN HIS NARRATION UNTIL IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT LIVING IN THAT DAY WHO WROTE THE PART. HE WILL SAY, "AND MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD WENT up Mount Nebo AND GOD SHOWED HIM THE CITY AND THEN HE FOUND A ROCK ON THE MOUNTAIN AND HE GAVE UP THE GHOST AND HE died is Moses. WRITING ABOUT THE DEATH OF MOSES IN YOUR BIBLE IN GENESIS 24. FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THIS SCRIPTURE, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXTUAL TYPOLOGY OF THEIR PLACE. WE HAVE ABRAHAM AND FOR OUR SERMON TODAY, WE KNOW ABRAHAM TYPES A FRIEND OF GOD. MANY TIMES, BROTHER BRHAM TYPIFIES HIMSELF TO ABRAHAM saying he had seven LETTERS ending with Ham. I KNOW THAT. BUT FOR TODAY, ABRAHAM IS NOT A PROPHET. ABRAHAM &gt;&gt; IS A TYPE OF ELOHIM. HE'S A TYPE OF GOD IN THIS EQUATION. THE BIBLE SAYS HE WAS WELL STRICKEN IN AGE. In Genesis 24 is a parallel OF REVELATION 10. AND IN REVELATION 10, IT SAYS, "I SAW A MIGHTY ANGEL COMING UP CLOTHED WITH A CLOUD." IN OTHER WORDS, THE HAIR WAS WHITE AS WOOL. AND ONE SIGN OF OLD AGE IS WHITE HAIR. IN THIS EQUATION, ABRAHAM IS THE ANCIENT OF DAYS. GOD WHO IS BLESSED IN ALL THINGS. AND ABRAHAM, HE HAS A PLAN OF REDEMPTION TO REDEEM A BRIDE FOR HIS SON ISAAC. SO ABRAHAM REPRESENTS GOD. WHO HOLDS THE SECRET OF THE REDEMPTION OF THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDE IS TO BE REDEEMED. SO ONE CALLED ISAAC AND HE SAYS I DON'T WANT A FOREIGN BRIDE BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN A FOREIGN LAND. I live in THE LAND OF CANAAN. WHERE THEY ARE CANAANITES, A cursed people, A PEOPLE IN THE LAND. HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO GO TO MESOPOTAM in a land OF THE PEOPLE THAT I DWELL WITH AND FIND A BRIDE FOR MY SON. ISAAC REPRESENTS THE SON OF GOD WHO IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. NOW ISAAC WAS THE ONLY SON OF ABRA. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? ISAAC WAS THE ONLY SON OF ABRAHAM. AND SOME THEOLOGIAN WILL ASK ME AND SAY, "NO, ISAAC WAS THE SECOND BORN BECAUSE THE FIRST BORN WAS ISHMAEL." &gt;&gt; ISHMAEL &gt;&gt; WAS NOT THE SON OF ABRA. BUT ISHMAEL WAS THE SON OF ABRA. HEY. AMEN. IS A SON OF ABRAHAM. ABRAHAM SON OF ABRAHAM. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS GENESIS 24 AFTER a three days JOURNEY TO GO AND SACRIFICE ISAAC. GOD COMES BACK TO ABRA. HE SAYS, "BECAUSE YOU HAVE LISTENED TO ME AND YOU HAVE NOT REFUSED TO SACRIFICE THY SON ONLY." IN OTHER WORDS, GOD IS NOT REGARDED BECAUSE THE NAME OF ABRA. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU DID IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOUR NAME WAS CHANGED IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST WAS NOT THE CHILD OF ABRAHAM'S BEHAVIOR does not recognize it. THAT'S WHY WHEN THEY WERE WRITING A COMMENTARY and Paul was WRITING BY FAITH NOT UNBELIEF till the very END WITH YOUR MISTAKES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE PLAN OF HOW I WISH ONE DAY IS BEING WRITTEN THAT THEY WILL NOT FIND FAULT WITH ME. I HAVE to take off this jacket. Amen. BROTHER, BROTHER, I WISH ONE DAY WHEN THEY WRITE ABOUT ME NOT FIND WITH ME BROTHER GOD CAN ALLOW HIM THROUGH TIME WHAT I'M PREACHING PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND FINDS NO MISTAKE with your SAID WHEN THE TEXTMAN CAME, I lied. Who told you that? WHO TOLD YOU THAT? BROTHER LI IT WAS BROTHER WHO TOLD YOU THAT I LIKE. HOW DO YOU USE something that I tell you? BECAUSE HE SAID HE LIED. MY QUESTION IS WHEN I WAS TELLING YOU THAT I LIED, WAS I LYING OR WAS I ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? HOW DO YOU SAY SUCH A MAN LIE? EVEN THE BEST LIGHTERS THAT ARE LIVING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, THEY HAVE ZERO CONTENT. THEY HAVE TO USE THE MESSAGE TO CRITICIZE THE MESSAGE BECAUSE ON THEIR OWN THEY CANNOT STAND. AGAIN OF REDEMPTION. HE was the ONLY SON WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE. IT WAS A WORD THAT WAS BELIEVED BY SARAH. IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY UNBELIEF. SARAH BELIEVED THE PROMISE. BUT SHE JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT IT could be fulfilled in her flesh. THAT'S WHY SHE SAID THIS GOSPEL I BELIEVE IT WITH HER. SO WAS MENTAL CONCEPTION. BUT PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION, SHE WAS A MISTAKE IN GENESIS 16 which was corrected in Genesis 16. IT IT MEANS IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU MUST CORRECT YOUR MISTAKE IN THE SAME CHAPTER. WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE. ISAAC WAS A PRODUCT OF IMPATIENCE. NOW I WANT TO DROP a bomb. So I'm preparing you brother say now you can put your spiritual CABIN CREW FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELS for take OFF WAS A PRODUCT OF DOUBT. That's why I said you need to put ON A SHIRT. ISAAC WAS A PRODUCT OF DOUBT BECAUSE SARAH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BRING FORTH ISAAC son of ABRAHAM WHO WAS NOT ISAAC. IT WAS JESUS CHRIST. YES. CRYSTAL. AMEN. AH. AMEN. YES. AH. AND NOW WE ARE TOGETHER. WE ARE TOGETHER. WATCH THIS. WHEN GENESIS 18 HAPPENS WHEN ELOHIM COMES OUTSIDE THE TENT, HE SAYS THE VISIT WAS NOT ABRAHAM. That visit WAS BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING WAS ALL ABOUT SARAH. THAT'S WHY THE FIRST THING HE ASKED HE DOESN'T ASK. HE SAYS THY WIFE. He says, "I AM HERE TO PERFORM THAT WHICH I PROMISE IN THE PROCESS OF TIME THY WIFE SHALL HAVE A SONNESS of the women of the Bible. It's not a sickness. of barren women in THE BIBLE because they WERE SICK. GOD NEVER PROTECTED THE MAN, BUT GOD PROTECTED THE WOMAN. THAT'S WHY NO MATTER HOW MUCH PROSTITUTION SHE COMMITTED, SHE SLEPT WITH ALL THE MEN IN JERICHO, SHE NEVER FELL PREGNANT. WHY? BECAUSE ONE DAY WOULD COME OUT OF THE WOMB OF A GENTILE will be brought. LISTEN TO ME. SHE WAS PROTECTED. GOD WAS PROTECTING THE WOMAN BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO ME. WHAT? BECAUSE SHE WAS MARRIED TO MY NEVER HAD A CHILD. They never had a child. That's the SAME TIME of God. ISAAC CAME. THE PROMISE WAS HANGING AROUND LOOKING BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST IS NOT THE SEAT OF A MAN is not the SEAT OF A MAN BECAUSE THE SCRIPTURE PROPHESIED that the SEED OF THE WOMAN SHALL BRUISE. AT THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. SO WHILE THE DEVIL &gt;&gt; WAS LOOKING AT THE LINEAGE OF JUDAH PROMISE ANGRY AND SAID you are CHOSEN TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE HOW CAN IT EXPLAIN TO ME MYSTERY NAME. JESUS. YES. HE'S WAITING FOR THE PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS CHRIST. The Holy GHOST SAYS STAY ON THIS POINT. The Holy Ghost SAYS STAY ON THIS. THAT'S WHY ABRAHAM TAKES HIM ON A THREE DAYS JOURNEY. TO MOUNT MARIAH SACRIFICING. WHY WAS HE supposed to be sacrificed? HOW CAN ISAAC BE SACRIFICED? WHAT IS A FIGURE OF WHAT CHRIST WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY? THAT'S NOT JESUS NAME. &gt;&gt; IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE JESUS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JESUS NAME. &gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE. &gt;&gt; LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT SIDE. TO THE RIGHT. THERE WAS A WAY. WHAT IS &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY. DON'T WORRY. THE SITUATION IS UNDER CONTROL. HERE. I'M IN CONTROL OF THAT FOLLOWING the ticket. A male ship. IT WAS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM CIVILIZATION. No way. SEE THIS WAS NOT BORN. IT WAS CREATED. IT WAS A SPOKEN FATHER BEGINNING. WHY? WHY? BECAUSE WHEN JESUS COMES, YOU WILL BE GIVEN A CROWN. HOW MANY DAYS? WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK? HE SAYS, I GO TO SACRIFICE WITH THE LORD. WE WILL BE BACK. AND CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED. OH, bring it up again. I didn't want to go there. I didn't want TO GO THERE. BUT I thought someone is doubting it. IT ENDED UP BENEFITING US. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE BOOK OF HEBREWS ISAAC RECEIVED LIKE ONE UNTO THE DEAD. IN OTHER WORDS, ISAAC DIED AND RESURRECTED ON THE MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HE WAS A FIGURE OF CHRIST only begotten OF THE FATHER. THAT'S character number two. NOW CHARACTER NUMBER THREE. THE NAME IS NOT GIVEN IN THIS SCRIPT. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE'S THE ONE THAT IS WRITING the scripture. HE'S THE SERVANT OF ABRAHAM. THAT RULED THE GREATER PORTION OF THE KINGDOM OF ABRAHAM. THOUGH HIS NAME IS NOT HERE, THOUGH HIS NAME IS NOT HERE, IT IS WRITTEN SOMEWHERE. WE KNOW HIS NAME. HIS NAME IS ELAZA. ELAZAR WAS A PROPHET. AMEN. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY ABRAHAM IS GOD AND IS THE FRIEND OF ABRAHAM, IT PUTS ELAZA TO BE A PROPHET. ELAZA WAS OF DAMASCUS AND DAMASCUS WAS LOCATED IN THE NORTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Brham is preaching in another place. And while HE WAS PREACHING THERE, THERE CAME a note that was written. THUS SAY THE LORD, I will send a prophet and you preach IN THIS TABERNACLE and is a prophet from the north. And I'm glad that though we are in East Africa, America is still in THE NORTH TO US. OF DAMASCUS. WHEN WHEN ABRAHAM LOOKED WHO COULD CARRY THE MISSION ONLY QUALIFIED HE RULED THE GREATER PORTION OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD. ONE DAY BROTHER BRANA WAS PREACHING WAS saying certain things IN A CERTAIN WAY. THE BROTHER THOUGHT THIS IS REVELATION 23. Just like I preached on Genesis 0 yesterday also revelation 23 the seals AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE BOOK. AND THE BROTHER WANTED TO SAY THAT AND HIS NAME WAS DENNY HENRY HENRY AND HE FIND HIMSELF SPEAKING IN FRENCH. AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A BROTHER WHO WAS A FRENCH SPEAKING BROTHER. AND HE SAID THAT IS PURE FRENCH. AND THERE WAS A UN INTERPRETER WHO INTERPRETED FRENCH AND THEY WROTE THEIR INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEN HENRY SPOKE AND THE INTERPRETATION WAS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE NARROW PATHWAY. IT IS NOT YOUR CHOOSING BUT MY CHOOSING AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT BUT A GREAT PORTION HEAVEN IS AWAITING YOU WHO HAS A GREAT PORTION IN HEAVEN AND THE HEART OF ABRAHAM. AMEN. I'm not going to simplify this one. I will LEAVE IT LIKE THAT. AND ABRAHAM SAYS, "COME PUT YOUR HANDS UNDER MY THIGH." &gt;&gt; NOW THE THIGH IS A SECRET PLACE FOR THE WIFE. ONLY THE WIFE OF A MAN SHOULD SEE THE THIGH. Can you say amen? Can't be going around seeing people's eyes here. It's reserved FOR THE WIFE AND THE THIGH IS A euphemism is a euphemism for the loins a soft word. Okay. SO THE BIBLE USES EUPHEMISM TO EXPLAIN COMPLEX THINGS. It will say they ate a fruit in the garden. But the eating of the fruit is the committing of adulter. THE THE BIBLE WILL SAY URIAH SHOULD COME BACK FROM WAR AND GO AND WASH HIS WIFE WIFE'S FEET. THE WASHING OF THE WIFE'S FEET IS a euphemism of the intimacy of your husband IN IT SAYS AND SO WENT INTO THE CAVE TO COVER HIS FEET. THE COVERING OF THE FEET FOR DEFECATION. So you see even that I'm saying I'm using defecation. I'm using a euphemism to explain another euphemism. SO WHEN HE SAYS THE LOINS THE WHEN HE SAYS THAT THIGHS IS A EUPHEMISM FOR THE LOINS OF a man. BUT NOW THE LOINS OF GOD ARE NOT IN HIS WAISTLINE. HIS LOINS ARE IN HIS MIND. HIS SEED IS IN THE MIND. IT MEANS IS A MAN THAT GOD GIVES ACCESS to his LOINS WHICH IS THE MIND OF THAT'S WHY WHEN SEVEN ANGELS COME DOWN WHEN THE PICTURE IS TAKEN, WHEN THE PICTURE IS TAKEN, IT IS A PICTURE OF THE HEAD OF CHRIST. IT IS ALSO THE COMING DOWN OF OUR HEADSHIP. AND IT IS IN THE HEAD WHERE YOU FIND THE LOINS OF GOD. THE SEED OF GOD IS THAT'S WHY WILLIAM BRHAM IS TAKEN INTO THE MIND INTO THE HEAD OF GOD the seed OF GOD supposed to claim another. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS THY NAME IN THE BOOK IS NOT LIKE LEVI OR NEVI. BUT IT IS THE MYSTERY NAME WHO YOU ARE WHO WILL PREACH THE MESSAGE. WE DON'T ASK FOR A LIST OF NAMES. THE PREACHING IS IN A MYSTERY. WHEN I MEET YOU OUTSIDE THERE, YOU SAY, "PASTOR, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ME. HOW DID I KNOW? &gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME. NO ONE that is PREACHING YOUR NAME. YOUR NAME IS NOT MY NAME. WILLIAM WAS NOT WILLIAM FOR A LONG TIME. HE WAS CALLED WILLIAM BR. BUT IN THE MESSAGE COMMUNION, HE SAYS, "I HAVE COME TO REALIZE I'M NOT a son. ANOTHER KENYA AUSTRALIAN A WHITE BROTHER FELLOWSHIP WITH A BLACK BROTHER GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION WHEN WE WERE IN HEAVEN WE WERE THE OH SON OF GOD YOU NO DIFFERENCE YOU AND YOUR SISTERALE WE ARE THE SAME THE WORLD IS WAITING FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF DEMONS. NO, NO, NO. THE WORLD IS WAITING. When I SAY son of GOD is the son of time. WE WERE IN PREVIEW WHEN BROTHER WAS SEEING THE PREVIEW BUT NOW IT'S NO LONGER A PREVIEW. BROTHER, BROTHER by the prophet OF MANIFESTATION. THE SON OF A DOG IS A DOG. THE SON OF A PIG IS A PIG. THE SON OF A LION IS A LION. OF GOD. AMEN. YOU SEE A DOG OUT THERE. THE REASON WHY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A DOG IS BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A DOG. YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND DOG BEHAVIOR. The reason WHY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COWS. YOU ARE NOT A COW. THAT'S WHY YOU CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND THINGS. THE REASON WHY THE WORLD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND US HUMAN BEINGS ARE A MUCH WAKING THEIR GOD is the GATHERING OF MY ONE OF FIRE. ANOTHER LIQU FROM EVERY DISTRICT of fire. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. FORCH. GOD GIVES BIRTH TO GOD. GOD IS BEST TO GOD. DON'T LET THE WORLD DON'T LET THE WORLD TELL YOU OTHERWISE. YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT YOU. YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS NOT YOU. CERTIFICATE. &gt;&gt; YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS NOT YOU. YOUR FAMILY BACKGROUND IS NOT YOU. WHO ARE YOU? I AM GOD. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WHEN LUCIFER FELL WHEN LUCIFER FELL, GOD NEVER CAME DOWN. THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. ADAM FELL DOWN. ANGELS NEVER MIND. WHEN GOD SAID ADAM, HE WAS NOT REPEATING HIMSELF. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. HE SAID MALE AND FEMALE CREATED HE THEM AND HE CALLED THEIR NAME. THE WOMAN WAS ADAM. THE MAN WAS ADAM. EVE COMES AFTER THE FALL. I SAY I'M NOT TALKING TO EVE. I'M TALKING TO ADAM. ADAM, &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? ADAM, &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU? STARTED TALKING ABOUT THINGS SURROUNDING HIM. MY WIFE DID THIS. GOD WAS NOT LOOKING FOR ADAM FOR his condition. NO, &gt;&gt; GOD WAS LOOKING FOR ADAM FROM HIS POSITION. WHERE ARE YOU IS A CONSULTATION OF POSITION, NOT CONDITION. HE DIDN'T SAY WHAT. HE SAYS, "WHERE ARE YOU TONIGHT? TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE." MY QUESTION IS, "WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR POSITION? Why have you left? WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR SPOKEN WORD POSITION? WHY HAVE YOU LEFT YOUR AUTHORITY? YOU ARE NOT A SON BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS. YOU ARE A SON BECAUSE OF POSITION. THAT'S WHY TEACHING IS IMPORTANT IN THE MINISTRY BECAUSE THIS SHOWS THE BELIEVER. AND IF YOU READ EPHESIANS 4 11, IF YOU CAN DISPLAY IT, HE SAYS, "AND HE GAVE SOME APOSTLES, SOME TEACHERS, SOME EVANGELISTS, PASTORS, and there's no NOW TEACHERS DOESN'T COME WITH BECAUSE IT'S SPECIAL. SAME. Sit a little. Sit a little. So we see Elaza, &gt;&gt; his brother Brham, &gt;&gt; the eagle from the north, &gt;&gt; the prophet to carry out a mission to get a bride for Isaac. Are you seeing that? And the Bible says he arrives at the well in the evening time. He doesn't go alone. He goes with the angel OF GOD. Says he sends his angel to go WITH HIM. You want to know today LOOK FOR A MAN WITH THE angel of THE LORD. HE GOES WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. HE DOES NOTHING. BUT HE SAYS, "I AM WAITING FOR THAT ANGEL." ARE YOU seeing that? HE'S WAITING FOR THAT ANGEL. HE DOESN'T GO ALONE. HE HAS GOT SERVANTS. OTHER SERVANTS THAT HE GOES WITH MEANING THE MINISTRY OF BROTHER BRAN IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. AMEN. REBECCA WAS NOT REDEEMED BY ELAZA ALONE. ELAZA HAD SERVANTS THAT HE WAS WITH AND THEY WERE NOT ALONE. ALL OF THEM. THEY HAD THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. THEY HAD 10 CAMELS. BROTHER SAY A CAMEL IS A beast and a beast is a symbol of power. THEIR MINISTRIES go with the Holy GHOST FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE REDEMPTION OF THE BRIDE AND THEY ARRIVE AT THE WELL IN THE EVENING TIME. I'm rushing. I'M WINDING DOWN. Carin cruise fasten your seat belts for landing for take off. Now we must pass. NOW HE DOES NOT GET INTO THE CITY. HE DOESN'T START BY MIXING WITH THE DENOMINATIONS. THE BRIDE IS NOT CAUGHT IN THE CITY. SHE &gt;&gt; IS CAUGHT OUTSIDE OF THE CITY. I wish I could preach about the city and show you how the city becomes a denominational place. Because even the wise men when they got into the city, the star disappeared. That's why if you want to achieve things with God, avoid camps, don't get into world cities. We believe it this way. No, no, no. Never put a full stop. Always put a comma. There are many people that have REJECTED THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY PUT full stops where they wanted to put you dropped this in 2012. I was invited at a certain place in Zimbabwe and I preached there for 17 years. After preaching there, nine tumors disappeared. Blind eyes were open. We had a revolving prayer line. People would be struck by the Holy Ghost in their home. And be brought to the meeting 2012. I'm telling you this is a reality. And my ministry was characterized by that. everywhere I go preach. Then we went to sit uh you know for for for lunch and there was this elder and this elder was talking. I didn't understand what he was talking about whether he's criticizing or something. I knew my heart was right but he's just dropping things there right about the third book know about the opening of the word they were alien to me some of the things what is this elder talking about we have arrived this is it this is the manifestation but I didn't put It created a thirst in me to want to study this message MORE down the line. I STARTED SEEING ON MY OWN. This is what that ELDER WAS TRYING TO TELL US WITHOUT TELLING US, WITHOUT CRITICIZING. HE WAS JUST DROPPING SEED. IF we are TO BE FAITHFUL. THIS IS NOT THE CLIMAX OF THE HEALING OF THE S. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE. YOU DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT, &gt;&gt; BUT YOU ARE SAYING IT SOMEHOW. DROPPING IT AS THREE YEARS AGO INVITED INTO MY CHURCH. I SAID, "YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT YOU DID IN 2012 AND HELP ME in my MINISTRY PREACHING HERE. SOME OF THE THINGS MIGHT SOUND LIKE might sound like but no, I don't think it's necessary. &gt;&gt; IF GOD HAS A PURPOSE FOR YOU, TAKE THESE SEEDS. JUST LEAVE THEM THERE. ONE DAY THE INTEREST FOR THE HIDDEN PART OF THE MESSAGE WILL BE GENERATED IN YOU. DOES IT MEAN I AM NO LONGER HEALING THE SICK? THE SICK ARE TO BE HEALED. THE PACKAGE IS THERE IN THE TEMPLE. BUT THE HEALING OF THE BODY CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE HEALING OF THE SOUL. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND THE TREAD POOL OF THE SPEAKING THINGS INTO has been Pentecostalized. IT HAS NOW BECOME A I'LL SPEAK MY INTO EXISTENCE. I'LL SPEAK MY DRAMA. I'LL SPEAK MY IT HAS BECOME COALIZED. YOU ARE TAKING THE MESSAGE WITH THE DENOMINATION OF YOU. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANA HE SPEAKS OF THE 10 VISION and the fishing TECHNIQUES WHERE HE GENERATES THE CONCEPT OF POOLS. AND THE BLESSING OF THE LITTLE SHOE. In 1956, IN 1959, HE SPEAKS SQUIRRELS INTO HE SPEAKS MOSQUITOES OUT OF EXISTENCE. HE REPEATS IT AGAIN IN THE MESSAGE OF GRACES WHEN HE ANNOUNCES THE SECOND account of THE SPEAKING OF SPIRALS. HE HAS ALREADY SPOKEN BEFORE 61. THE PART OF THE THIRD POOL OF SPEAKING THINGS INTO AND OUT OF HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE TWICE ON THE ASPECT OF SPIRALS. HE GOES ON TO DEAL WITH THE STORM OF KOLERAT and that is the third boo that you hear being emphasized most of the times by ministers and it has been used to toel things but the the seals were not even revealed. WHEN THE SEALS ARE REVEALED, THEN HE SAYS THIS DEAD POOL IS THREE PARTS. THERE'S THE SPEAKING OF THINGS INTO AND OUT OF EXISTENCE. THERE'S THE OPENING OF THE WORD WHICH IS THE ONE THAT BRINGS ABOUT A BODY CHANGE. AND THERE'S THE ASPECT OF PREACHING TO THE TOTAL LORD. THE LAST TWO ASPECTS OF THE THIRD BOOK IS WHAT IS SCARCELY PREACHED ABOUT. AND YET IT IS THE ONE THAT BRINGS US INTO THE BODY CHAIN ON THE 28TH OF JULY 2807 1963 IN THE MESSAGE CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD WITH YOU. BROTHER SAYS IT'S 2:00. THE END OF THE SECOND POOL is at hand. Are you hearing what I'm saying? But you spoke spirals ALREADY AND YOU'RE not saying the POOL IS A WHICH IS HE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S THE OPENING OF THE WORD. THE BELIEVER RECOGNIZING WHO THEY ARE. AND IF EVER I HAVE A MINISTRY, I WOULD WANT MY MINISTRY TO BE A MINISTRY THAT BRINGS THE BRIDE INTO REALIZATION CONSCIOUSNESS. I've already told you a secret. I TOLD YOU A SECRET. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE MUST KNOW WHO THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T DESPISE OTHER MINISTRIES BECAUSE THE Bible also SAYS PETER WHEN YOU ARE CONVERTED STRENGTHEN YOUR BRETHREN. THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH MINISTRIES TO STRENGTHEN. HE JUST COMES TO STRENGTHEN YOU. IT'S GOING TO BE WELL. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE IT. YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE ANOTHER JOB. IT'S OKAY. IT'S A MINISTRY. IT'S IN THE BIBLE. IT'S NOT IN PLACE. THIS PART OF GETTING THE PERSON BY REVELATION TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE JESUS CAN RISE UP AND SAY THOU ART THE CHRIST. JESUS SAID SIMON FLESH AND BLOOD REVEAL THIS TO YOU FROM PASTOR FROM BROTHER GEORGE BUT MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN HAS REVEALED IT TO YOU. YOUR NAME SHALL BE CHANGED. YOU ARE NO LONGER SIMON. YOU SHALL BE PETER ROCK AND UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY HOUSE REVELATION REVELATION does not HAT YOU HAVING A NEW DOES NOT HURT YOU. HAVING A NEW JOB YOU MARRIED A REVELATION AND MANY TIMES HE LIKES YOU. YOU HAVE A REVELATION ABOUT WHO GOD IS. THE GREATEST REVELATION IS NOT KNOWING WHO GOD IS. THE GREATEST REVOLUTIONARY IS GOING THROUGH YOU. I KNOW BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. I KNOW BROTHER. I KNOW JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I KNOW PETER. &gt;&gt; I KNOW PAUL. I KNOW. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM. BUT WHO ARE YOU? IF IT SAYS THAT THOU SO MINDFUL OF CHRIST IS THE MYSTERY OF GLORY to put another LAYER THAT WAS IN GOD WAS PUT IN CHRIST. OH, THE BRIDE JOHN GO TO THE ANGEL.

YOU ARE NOT BROKE. YOU ARE NOT POOR. YOU ARE NOT BLIND. YOU ARE NOT. YOU ARE GOD. YOU ARE SON OF GOD. YOU ARE. YOU ARE. YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WHAT MY MAMA SAYS I AM. I'M NOT WHAT MY TEACHER SAYS I AM. I AM WHAT MY BOSS SAYS I AM. I'M NOT THE PASTOR SAYS I AM. I AM WHAT GOD SAYS I AM. I KNOW WHO I AM. I'M WALKING IN POWER. I'M WALKING IN MIRACLE. I LIVE A LIFE OF FAITH. You are. WHO ARE YOU? YOU ARE GOD. WE ARE AT THE WELL NOW. WE ARE AT THE WELL NOW. I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU TO SIT A LITTLE BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR. IT'S UNFAIR. WHEN YOU ARE AT THE WELL, IT'S ACTION TIME. WHAT IS THE WELL? THE MEETING PLACE FOR WOMEN. THE WELL IS THE MEETING PLACE. WHEN JESUS WAS AT THE WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? HE MET THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA. THIS IS THE WELL OF UGANDA. THE WORLD OF UGANDA EVENING TIME EVENING TIME. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES &gt;&gt; WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDORA AT THE WELL HE WAS AT THE WELL. THAT'S WHERE HE GOT AMEN. HE ARRIVED. AT THE WELL. AND HERE WE ARE AT THE WELL. AND THERE WAS a prayer. AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN 30 MINUTES? THE ANGEL WAS TELLING ME WHEN YOU ARRIVE, FEED THE CAMELS, FEED THE CAMELS. SOMETHING ABOUT THE 30 MINUTES. BROTHER SAYS MOSES AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. HE SAYS THE BUSH THAT WAS BURNING HAD been there BURNING FOR A SPACE OF ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS MOSES SAID I WILL now turn. IT WAS BURNING FOR HOW MANY MINUTES? &gt;&gt; 30 MINUTES. AND BROTHER SAID WHEN I WENT FISHING WITH THE WOOD BROTHERS AND I FISHED OUT THAT LITTLE FISH AND THE INSIDE WENT UP. HE SAYS IT HAD BEEN LYING THERE ON THE BANK FOR A SPACE OF ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. I HAVE BEEN HERE PREACHING FOR OVER 30 MINUTES. AND WHEN BROTHER WHEN THE 30 MINUTES WAS OVER, HE SAID LITTLE VISION, I GIVE YOU LIFE. AND I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S OVER 30 MINUTES. IT'S RESURRECTION TIME. LITTLE SISTER, I GIVE YOU LIFE. LITTLE BROTHER, I GIVE YOU LIFE. IT'S RESURRECTION TIME. AND SAYS, WHEN YOU WENT TO FINLAND, THE BOYS THAT HAD BEEN STRUCK BY GOD, HE SAYS THEY HAD BEEN DEAD FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. BUT AFTER 30 MINUTES, IT'S RESURRECTION TIME. WHEN YOU OPEN THE SEVENTH SEAL, SILENCE SILENCE IS NOT HERE. THE SILENCE IS IN HEAVEN. WHY? HE IS NO LONGER IN HEAVEN. WHERE IS HE? DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PASTOR. MY MINISTRY IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR TEACHER. MY MINISTRY TO DECLARE HIM. IS &gt;&gt; WHERE IN UGANDA. HE IS HERE &gt;&gt; IN YOUR LIFE. HE IS IN THIS PLACE. I WANT TO MAKE A DECLARATION. WE ARE NO LONGER IN A SCHOOL HALL. So there's a 10 LITER REVELATION. THE 10 LIT REVELATION IS DOING what you have been asked TO DO. SO THERE'S A 10 LIT skate and there is a 2,000 liter scale. One camel drinks 200 lit. 10 CAMELS DRINK 2,000 lit. A REQUIREMENT TO QUALIFY TO BE BRIDE WAS A 2,000 LITER REVELATION. BUT THE BEGINNING IS JUST A 10 LITER REVELATION. SO YOU CAN WEAR A 10 LIT SK. IT'S JUST BELOW THE KNEES 10. It's not a mini skirt. It's not also a long skate. &gt;&gt; It's a 10 LIT REVELATION. YOU CAN WEAR A 10 LIT TROUSER. It's not a short but it's not a trouser. IT'S A 10 LIT REVELATION. YOU CAN HAIRSTYLE. YOU HAVE NOT CUT YOUR HAIR, BUT YOU ARE NOT also keeping it the correct way. IT'S A 10 REVELATION. AND WE HAVE 10 LIT PREACHERS, 2,000 liter preachers, 2,000 lit preachers, WHO WOULD GO INTO THE OLD TESTAMENT, the Bible says, AND HE MET THE KING OF SALEM. AND HE GAVE TITHE OF ALL. BUT WHEN WRITES, HE SAYS, "AND THIS KING OF PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH GOD ALSO KNOWN KING AS THE RIGHTEOUS made like unto THE SON OF GOD WITHOUT you getting THE DATA. IT'S NOT THERE, BUT IT'S A 2,000 LIT REVELATION. WHEN THE BIBLE IS WRITTEN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, IT SAYS, "AND MOSES APPEARED BEFORE PHARAOH AND PHARAOH, THE MAGICIANS, AND THEY TOOK THEIR SNAKES AND THE ROAD OF AARON." AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NO LONGER THE ROAD OF MOSES. THE BIBLE SAYS THE ROAD OF AARON SWALLOWED THE SNAKE OF THE SORCERERS. In other words, THE ROD OF MOSES MUST BECOME THE ROD OF AARON. THE ROD OF THE PROPHET MUST BECOME THE ROAD OF THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. WE HAVE the snake of Jambbury. WE HAVE IT. THE SNAKE OF UGANDA. WE HAVE IT. THERE'S NO THERE'S NO WISH THAT CAN BE WITH YOU. THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS SWALLOWED THEIR POWERS. WE ARE SWALLOWING THE POWERS OF UKAN. COME, LET ME BLESS YOU. WE ARE SWALLOWING THE SNAKES of Uganda. ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? IF YOU AS THE PRIEST, &gt;&gt; THE THINGS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE, WE HAVE SWALLOWED IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN PAUL WRITES, HE SAYS AS JANICE AND JUMB WITH MOSES, WHERE DO YOU get the data of saying their names was Janice and JUMB IN THIS DAY AND IT SAYS AND REBECCA THE WIFE OF ZAKIUS WAS PRAYING FOR A HUSBAND. THIS SCRIPTURE SAID THE WIFE OF JESUS WAS CALLED REBECCA AND THEY WERE STANDING IN HALLELUJAH STREET AT amen corner. BROTHER WE WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE WIFE OF ZAKIUS. BROTHER WE WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE FRIEND CLEOPUS. HE SAYS CLEOPAS AND HIS FRIEND WE'RE GOING TO A MOUSE AND HE COMES IN ANOTHER SPOKEN WORD. NOW YOU KNOW THE FRIEND OF CLEOPUS ISOP WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THIS 2000 LITTLE REVELATION BROTHER WILL COME AND SAY IT WAS ON A TUESDAY MORNING AROUND 11:00 ON UNDER THE HOT DESERT SUN THAT MEC CAME DOWN AND VISITED ABRAHAM. HOW ARE YOU GETTING THE TIME? HE'S SEEING IT FROM A 2,000 LITER REVELATION. SO WHAT DID REBECCA DO? SHE DID THE EXTRA WHICH WAS NOT REQUIRED. IT WAS NOT ASKED OF HER BUT IT IS WHAT QUALIFIED YOU QUALIFIES THE BRIDE. WHAT QUALIFIES YOU IS GOING AN EXTRA MILE. SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO TONIGHT AS A FEED THE CAMELS. FEED THE CAMELS. THE WATERS OF REBECCA ARE DANGEROUS WATERS. WHEN SHE HAD DONE FEEDING THE CAMELS, THE CAMELS WERE NOW REBECCA'S COMING. WHEN YOU SAY AMEN, THE PROMISE BECOMES YOUR PROMISE. FEED THE CAMELS. REBECCA, &gt;&gt; WHEN SHE WENT TO THE WELL, SHE WAS WALKING. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE WELL, SHE WAS NO LONGER WALKING. SHE WAS RIDING. SHE WAS WRITING. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME HERE. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE WALKING, BUT YOU ARE NO LONGER GOING BACK WALKING. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME HERE. WITHOUT A JOB. YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING BACK WITHOUT A JOB. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME HERE. YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK. WHY FEED THE CAMEL? FEED THE CAMEL. THE CAMEL'S MOM ASKED, "WHOSE CAMELS ARE THIS?" &gt;&gt; MY CAMELS. &gt;&gt; MY CAMELS. ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU WILL SHOCK THE WHOLE VILLAGE. IF IT DOESN'T SHOCK THEM, IF IT DOESN'T SHOCK THEM, THEN GOD HAS NOT DONE IT. IF GOD DOES IT, YOU SHALL SHOCK THEM. YOU SAY, "IS THIS YOU? IS THIS YOU WITH A RANGE ROVER?" UH-HUH. IS THIS YOU THAT IS MARRIED NOW? IS THIS YOU WHO IS DEDICATING TWINS? &gt;&gt; THE BROTHER WHO COME HOLDING HIS OWN, THE SISTER WHO COME HOLDING HER OWN. TWINS FOR THE TIME THAT YOU WERE WAITING FOR. BLESSING MUST COME. HALLELUJAH. There was a man by the name of John Ryan. He was blind and he came in the prayer line. He was prayed for said, "Do you believe?" He says he believed. He says, "Receive your sight." He went back. HE WAS STILL BLIND. AND THEN his friend SAID, "YOU WERE LYING. HE LIED TO YOU OR BACK IN THE PRAYER LINE. HE CAME AGAIN. HE SAID, "BROTHER, BROTHER, I remember you. I prayed for you." He says, "They told me that you lied to me." My brother says, "Did you said you believe? Did you tell them when I did you have faith? You said you have." He says, "I believe it." My brother says, "Do you want new prayer or should you believe the old prayer? WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN? BROTHER SAYS, "GO BACK. GO TESTIFY. GO TELL THEM I AM HEALED." UGANDA, &gt;&gt; UGANDA, &gt;&gt; KENYA, KENYA. &gt;&gt; GO TELL THEM THAT I'M DELIVERED. GO TELL THEM THAT I'M HEALED.

BROTHER SAY BROTHER SAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST ACT LIKE YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB ACT LIKE YOU HAVE A JOB. IF YOU ARE YOU ARE SICK. ACT LIKE YOU ARE HEALED. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WON'T BE ACTING YOU WILL BE THE REALITY. HALLELUJAH. ACT LIKE IT UNTIL YOU BECOME IT. LIKE IT UNTIL YOU BECOME IT. WAS NO LONGER ACTING. HE RAN WITH THE POWER. I SAID TO FOLLOW HIM, PLEASE GOING TO RUN AWAY WITH THE TOWER TOGETHER. YOU WILL RUN WITH THE TOWER. HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED HOME, THERE WAS CONSULTATION. AND ELAZA SAID IF I HAVE FOUND HIM, LET ME TAKE THE DAM BACK TO ISAAC. AND THEY SAID, "But you still have some things." Therefore, delayed them so that he could give us. And Ela said, "Please, please allow us to go. I know you want TO GO. PLEASE ALLOW US TO GO. HE SAID ABOUT THIS MATTER, LET'S NOT ASK THE FATHER. LET'S NOT ASK THE MOTHER. LET'S ASK THE DANCER. WILL you go? WILL YOU GO? WILL YOU GO WITH BROTHER? WILL YOU CALL INTO THE RAPTURE? WILL YOU GO INTO PERFECTION? I WILL. &gt;&gt; I will.
