[Applause] [Music] takes over my soul [Music] my soul will be renewed when the spirit takes over my soul [Music] lord jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and we believe [Music] hallelujah i mean before you see it let's just go through this uh scripture straight away first and um we are going to the book of genesis once again [Music] this is part 5 of the series that we've been speaking on receiving the holy ghost oh [Music] amen all right so we read genesis chapter two verse 21 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slapped and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now one of my bonds and flesh of my flesh it shall be called woman because she has been taken out of the man [Music] remember that woman means taken out of the man and eve means mother of all living [Music] so eve was meaning mother of the bird and the good challenge mother of kings but adam was not meaning father of king and about adam challenged his attack and then here we see that she was taken out of the man one of them this man in the image of god her name was woman meaning a part of the man praise the lord and so here on verse 7 he says and the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground breathed into his nose please the breath of life and man became a living soul video i want to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ my name is christopher a blessing and a privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning coming to see the thank you for coming to fellowship even i'm so happy to see you sister also it's wonderful you know you've been away for a long time wonderful to see you this morning and also my brother last sunday you are not around sunday in the west nice to see you also hi everyone sister fortunate amen this other one to be here yeah that sunday the other sunday was it not his first time sunday with the script okay it wasn't your first time okay well welcome back again yeah amen today is a special day but uh as always i always want to just approach the world immediately directly and then we can always do the rest of the announcements and everything later every single day to record it in the something new that maybe perhaps you may not follow me well uh this is part 5. and all the other parts are on there online if you feel so desire the desire to go and follow up that we count all the coldness out there we've already had a wonderful worship at the nox sins and now we should be ready to receive the word you know whenever you go you come to church you should be ready to say amen and so i think today will be part two of the blood i will continue to speak a little bit on that connection with the holy spirit now then then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and 2019. amen i mean and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side again now while we are still reading john 20. i hope i hope i don't lose any of you i want you to follow me close this is a very sensitive scripture every year and my prayer is that you will receive a revelation as we are still reading here not just someone i want us to look at what we have read now i i know you you you can have you if you have a bible you can open it back both ways well i want us to look at john 20 and look at genesis okay you can have [Music] god caused a deep sleep to fall on adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up up the flesh instead they arrowed god took out a rib out and here the lord comes from the resurrection after the resurrection and he meets the disciples and he tells them peace be unto you amen so i am peacefully went to sleep [Music] then and the lord god calls the deep sleep and then after that he says he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead they are wrong [Music] and when he had so said when he had so say me then he showed unto them his hand i will never again economy and his side no are you following me there is something about the side whatever of jesus that it was very identical to the side of adam why the way to find a chimpanzee jesus the wife of adam came out of the ribs of of adam machado this is adam when god created the adam please follow me here and i would say bring this foundation here that throne that we are turned adam he spoke are you following me oh my there are many revelations going through my mind right now i pray that you will open your mind to receive it when god spoke in genesis chapter one i was always getting confused when i read that but when i read the message when i heard the message all had meaning so in genesis 1 we see because he was in the image of god is more children into existence these children have the character and the image of god amen just like adam and eve we're and now he begins all right all right let's take it a little slow here then he says then jesus said that to them again yes after he had showed them his side of his hands [Music] as my father sent me next time even so send are you remember and then when he had said this when he had saved me he believed on them all right now we notice that jesus yes you he tells them to receive the holy ghost yeah instead of being i don't know i don't know how to explain to you well figure it out if you can't do it that's okay hallelujah i mean in genesis chapter two or very very strong he says to this man he had molded out of the dust of the moon he actually says to that man the same thing jesus said when he rose from the crowd i want you to understand here that by the time jesus braved his breath there was not seen yet jesus yes would not breathe on the people the bible says he in other words you can only be in that image explaining it to someone achieving them before the fall you can only be in the image of god before the fall but then [Music] everybody the only difference in your car is that has not maybe manifested in you in a greater way you find the thief they are beating oh sorry [Music] i wanted to look at genesis 2 once again of the lord and the lord and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man too hallelujah all right good to go amen and i told you and i probably several times the reason why jesus came was to die on the cross the origin you can only be redeemed back to where you were not this is there are some souls in this world that are not redeemable because they do not have the seed of god no matter what you do they can never receive the holy ghost no matter what you do they in the beginning in the image of god in furniture let us create man in our image was in the image of god and adam and eve was in adam adam somebody was telling me the other day i the fact amen could not let his seed go to annihilation god could never accept a seed in his image [Music] um i always speak for an hour i hope that that would be to about 12. so by one i'll be done hallelujah i mean so i wanted to follow me with all your chickens and so adam adam was then his nature was perverted and all his children were perverted we were born in a perverted way that's why when jesus came up yesterday he was not able to breathe on the people and to tell them receive the holy ghost before they are redeemed only by being a part of a society remember the other man who came to jesus [Applause] he even smiling immediately and he said i've been doing all these works of the love from the since i was a baby i was wearing a long scarf about having no earrings [Music] yes would not breathe on them [Music] oh redeem the situation jesus amen i mean all the prophets but not people now just there by and that's of who [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and puts [Music] even your salvation hallelujah amen and so when jesus yes you went oh glory to god he went on the cross you know everything was already prophesied the moment you received because of your and when he killed all of them down the line would never take over he thought [Music] the spirit that brings life yes hallelujah amen who was jesus he was the manifestation of god yes [Applause] [Music] oh they cannot fall away hallelujah amen jesus yes did not look at the disciples and tell them let me die maybe i might redeem it i they hear you appreciate of god even when he's excommunicated he cannot join those lord jesus a true child of god even when you are living oh hallelujah amen receive you the holy ghost jesus say that yes yes after you have gone on the cross oh that man on the cross i believe in my only solution from the bondage [Music] [Music] maybe some of you don't know nobody have much moment one day i was in ethiopia a roman numeral ethiopia and one brother called me faster found believers more than a thousand but singular there are more people that believe the doctrine messages let's go back to the apostolate doctrine so they are preaching the message of restoration without having the prophets he was [Music] and so these people he listened to me very well [Music] [Music] he had always had the message being
