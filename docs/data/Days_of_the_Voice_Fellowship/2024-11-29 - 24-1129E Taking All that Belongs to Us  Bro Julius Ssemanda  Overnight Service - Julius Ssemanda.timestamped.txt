[1:10:11] preing so sometimes you know uh when I

[1:10:18] meeting I want to be
[1:10:21] comfortable and move around and push
[1:10:25] push means pray until something
[1:10:30] happens praise the name of the Lord I'm
[1:10:32] so happy
[1:10:34] tonight we have a
[1:10:36] brother who the Lord has um permitted
[1:10:39] that he would speak to us
[1:10:43] tonight uh maybe some of you know
[1:10:46] him others perhaps do not know
[1:10:51] him
[1:10:53] brother Julius
[1:10:56] J is um he's
[1:11:00] from I think he's not been in the
[1:11:03] message for so
[1:11:06] long maybe brother Julius you will tell
[1:11:08] us a little bit of how long you've been
[1:11:09] in the
[1:11:12] message uh but I love I've loved him for
[1:11:16] his uh love for the
[1:11:20] message and his
[1:11:22] Zeal um you know when if you see that if
[1:11:27] there is someone who will amount to
[1:11:29] anything in
[1:11:33] Ministry you will you will see them by
[1:11:35] the Zeal they
[1:11:38] have the fire they
[1:11:40] have when they starting
[1:11:43] out um you know I remember I still have
[1:11:47] this the the same Zeal and
[1:11:51] fire but there are certain things I used
[1:11:53] to do then that I may not be able to do
[1:11:54] now
[1:11:58] 18 years
[1:11:59] ago I I was I was wondering how I was
[1:12:02] you know able to one day I traveled by
[1:12:06] road to
[1:12:11] Zimbabwe I was almost killed
[1:12:15] inam there was an incident there the
[1:12:18] enemy had planned things for
[1:12:20] me but you see you I travel the whole
[1:12:23] week in a bus
[1:12:26] and then hit the road preaching and
[1:12:28] preach for a month
[1:12:31] plus go to Nair preach on the
[1:12:35] streets you know I was just traveling
[1:12:37] preaching traveling
[1:12:38] preaching baptizing traveling preaching
[1:12:41] Bap you know when God is just initiating
[1:12:44] you into the
[1:12:47] ministry that Zeal does a
[1:12:51] lot and that's why we want all our young
[1:12:54] people to be on fire
[1:12:57] but when you see someone who is starting
[1:12:59] out and and just you know like you need
[1:13:02] to push
[1:13:06] them there is a problem
[1:13:08] there usually but brother Julius has a
[1:13:14] Zeal and I've not heard him preach
[1:13:18] before but uh you can tell by talking to
[1:13:21] him that he's a real Christian
[1:13:26] amen I I think I'll just leave it at
[1:13:28] that and maybe speak more
[1:13:32] afterwards praise the Lord but even on
[1:13:35] Sunday there's there's more
[1:13:38] testimonies that uh we will share about
[1:13:41] what the Lord is doing
[1:13:44] in uh brother sh just gave me the news
[1:13:47] and I'm just so
[1:13:50] amazed God is still
[1:13:52] moving God is still doing miracles
[1:13:56] God is still calling his
[1:13:58] SE and there's a
[1:14:00] Revival now let me tell you that this
[1:14:04] message it is it moves by
[1:14:08] itself it's not an organization that
[1:14:10] pushes
[1:14:13] it it has
[1:14:16] power H how can I say there is Revival
[1:14:19] power behind the
[1:14:22] message when it is in
[1:14:26] City or in a country no man can put it
[1:14:31] out amen and no man can start
[1:14:34] it because it's only God who does start
[1:14:37] it and no one can put it
[1:14:40] out and so I believe there is more that
[1:14:43] God
[1:14:44] has amen
[1:14:47] for so I'd like um us to
[1:14:50] stand and to receive our brother Julius
[1:14:55] as uh he will be coming to minister
[1:14:58] tonight so brother Julius have your
[1:15:01] Liberty full
[1:15:05] Liberty preach like brother
[1:15:09] Julius preach your
[1:15:11] heart and let the Holy Spirit move so
[1:15:15] overnight you have up to two three hours
[1:15:18] to
[1:15:19] preach is that all
[1:15:21] right amen and then the left over time
[1:15:24] will be able to go in
[1:15:27] pray praise the Lord I understand
[1:15:29] there's another young person that came
[1:15:36] from ah God bless you please let us
[1:15:38] receive him
[1:15:41] godess this young man goes to work with
[1:15:45] him and uh is trying to reach out the
[1:15:51] message and he said I will take you to

[1:15:58] preaching or before the morning we shall

[1:33:01] amen my subject tonight
[1:33:05] is taking all that belongs to
[1:33:11] us taking all that belongs to
[1:33:16] us it was
[1:33:18] Moses that God had
[1:33:21] called to go and deliver the of
[1:33:25] Israel out of
[1:33:27] captivity and from bondage in the which
[1:33:30] they had been
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:33] taken by by in Egypt
[1:33:37] there and when the time of the
[1:33:40] promise to bring them out at
[1:33:43] come God sends
[1:33:45] Moses and he says I will deliver them
[1:33:49] out but with a might hand I'm going to
[1:33:53] deliver them
[1:33:54] but the Deliverance by the which I will
[1:33:57] deliver them shall be with a
[1:34:00] mighty and Moses went down
[1:34:03] there and the first
[1:34:07] miracle was the that he threw down the
[1:34:10] road that
[1:34:11] he and he turned into a snake and The
[1:34:15] Magicians of
[1:34:17] pharaoh their
[1:34:19] enchantments did the same
[1:34:22] thing but God
[1:34:24] the other Serpent of Moses SED up the
[1:34:28] others of The
[1:34:30] Magicians but The
[1:34:34] Magicians also did made the
[1:34:37] snakes with their
[1:34:40] enchantments imitators of
[1:34:44] God and Pharaoh's heart was
[1:34:48] hardened he could not let them
[1:34:50] go well God did another miracle
[1:34:55] he said all right he sent
[1:34:58] flocks it was
[1:35:00] blood turn all the water into
[1:35:03] blood The
[1:35:05] Magicians with their
[1:35:07] enchantments did the same
[1:35:10] thing was it making things
[1:35:13] better it was making things
[1:35:17] worse
[1:35:18] imitation makes things worse
[1:35:24] and Pharaoh's heart was
[1:35:26] hardened not let them
[1:35:29] go and God said I do another miracle FRS
[1:35:34] came all over
[1:35:35] Egypt filled the entire
[1:35:38] country The
[1:35:39] Magicians did the same thing with their
[1:35:47] enchantments and Pharaoh's heart was
[1:35:52] hardened God did another
[1:35:55] miracle
[1:35:57] Li came out of the Dust The Magicians
[1:36:02] with their
[1:36:03] enchantments this time it
[1:36:07] failed brother sister
[1:36:10] imitation has a
[1:36:12] limit it has a
[1:36:15] limitation the enchantments of the
[1:36:18] devil the
[1:36:22] liation they can imitate the truth they
[1:36:25] can imitate the servant of God they can
[1:36:28] imitate the
[1:36:29] Miracles but there is a limit their
[1:36:34] imitation and that is the
[1:36:37] Vindication of the true
[1:36:41] s that was the
[1:36:43] end of the
[1:36:46] enchantments of The
[1:36:48] Magicians the rest of the
[1:36:51] Miracles that were happening
[1:36:54] they had no
[1:36:55] power when the bo
[1:36:58] came all over
[1:37:02] Egypt they were attacked
[1:37:05] also they were also in
[1:37:09] trouble and now after
[1:37:13] Pharaoh had seen all these
[1:37:16] Miracles still he could not let the
[1:37:19] children of Israel
[1:37:21] go at first
[1:37:24] my subject is taking all that belongs to
[1:37:27] us at first he says all right the flogs

[1:53:25] fight and defeat you he has to first
[1:53:31] defeat if he can defeat God he can

[1:53:48] sisters what we need is a total
[1:53:54] deliver not
[1:53:57] halfway under the blood of bulls and
[1:54:02] gods Moses said I'm not taking a halfway
[1:54:07] deliver and under the blood of

[1:54:15] take brother as long as God gives me a
[1:54:19] job even if I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:54:25] you it can't be that's not the message
[1:54:31] that God brother I have the Holy
[1:54:35] Ghost things don't
[1:54:38] [Music]
[1:54:40] matter you don't know the Holy Ghost

[2:01:02] heads on the
[2:01:05] ground and that has made it to go all
[2:01:08] over the

[2:44:56] mine now he says this is where you
[2:45:01] failed uh
[2:45:08] 1953 now I don't want you to
[2:45:11] say know the problem we have
[2:45:14] today when the message is
[2:45:17] preached and someone say
[2:45:26] it's how you be when you are reading the
[2:45:30] message that's how you be when you
[2:45:34] reading the
[2:45:36] message say this
[2:45:42] isation of people but you are entangled
[2:45:46] in the same thing

[2:47:29] that
[2:47:31] God he
[2:47:33] does don't never think that you could
[2:47:37] ever ask too much of
[2:47:40] God I think I've asked too
[2:47:45] much wrong
[2:47:47] thought ever think that asking for
[2:47:52] more he says if you thirsty for more for
[2:47:56] more of God more of God for
[2:48:02] you you need more
[2:48:04] blessings more extra
[2:48:07] enlargement there is more of
[2:48:09] itory he
[2:48:11] says I believe the scripture
[2:48:14] says you have
[2:48:16] not because you ask
[2:48:20] and you ask
[2:48:22] not because you believe
[2:48:25] not he wants us to ask and
[2:48:30] believe that our
[2:48:33] Jo would be
