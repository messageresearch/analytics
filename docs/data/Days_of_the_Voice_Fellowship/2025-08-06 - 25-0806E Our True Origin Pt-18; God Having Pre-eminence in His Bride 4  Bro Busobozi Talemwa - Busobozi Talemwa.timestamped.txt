[44:05] brother Neville
[44:07] who was helping us to do the legal stuff
[44:11] and also brother Joel.
[44:15] So this represented us
[44:17] and uh we we we went into some further
[44:20] negotiations with him
[44:24] &gt;&gt; because you know he he we had agreed
[44:26] that uh before before on 7th August we
[44:30] pay a total sum of 100 million shillings
[44:39] after which we shall be remaining with a
[44:41] total of 120
[44:46] is payable within 8 months.
[44:50] So um
[44:53] of course it's been a struggle raising
[44:54] the 100 million
[44:59] especially because we used much of it uh
[45:02] in in our youth previous youth camp.
[45:08] We used 30 million shillings in excess
[45:10] of our of of of what we were supposed to
[45:14] spend.
[45:19] Of course, you know, because of the
[45:20] change of the venues and we used two
[45:22] venues and many other things
[45:26] also. We had a problem on on our
[45:28] visitors who are supposed to come the
[45:30] speakers.
[45:34] So, we had a lot of um unexpected
[45:36] expenses.
[45:40] So, but I made a decision in the meeting
[45:42] here with the committee
[45:46] and I announced to them that I'm not
[45:48] going to put that burden of the 30
[45:50] million shieldings on the church.
[45:55] But I I said I'll put it on myself
[46:00] because I made a decision
[46:03] and um without consulting with with the
[46:05] with the church
[46:08] But also um uh I also made it open that
[46:12] if anybody was willing to contribute
[46:14] something towards it,
[46:19] everybody would be open to do that.
[46:22] So of course we were remaining with some
[46:24] sum to make a 100 plus now that 30 which
[46:26] was remaining
[46:28] unpaid.
[46:32] So we from our collections here we made
[46:35] 100
[46:38] and um now it remained that debt.
[46:44] So um a few people have come up and
[46:47] really contributed towards it
[46:51] generously
[46:54] uh brother Ken of of Nairobi you know we
[46:57] announced what he gave
[47:01] yesterday. I was impressed when sister
[47:03] Monica, she might be streaming. She she
[47:05] she texted me and said, "Pastor, I have
[47:08] informed my group because she's one of
[47:10] the team leaders of the groups, one of
[47:11] the groups, my group, specifically
[47:13] Martin."
[47:16] &gt;&gt; And so they said that uh they
[47:18] contributed, they collected
[47:22] a certain amount
[47:25] which would support on that debt
[47:28] and yesterday they sent 110,000
[47:31] shillings.
[47:34] And I thought uh that was really might
[47:36] you might say well it's not covering a
[47:38] lot but
[47:40] it shows the burden and the sacrifice
[47:44] and and that's what we need to have
[47:46] brethren.
[47:48] It's not about the total amount of funds
[47:51] that you give.
[47:54] It's about the sacrifice, the labors and
[47:57] and the desire to serve God.
[48:01] And also sister John called me. She
[48:04] said, "Pastor, we've been praying and um
[48:07] you know this need was brought before
[48:09] our group
[48:13] and said that she told me in one hour
[48:17] I'm going to send $100."
[48:21] And uh you know she said it in dollars.
[48:23] I was like, "Okay."
[48:26] So, I think God is going to lift her a
[48:28] standard.
[48:30] So she sent $100
[48:34] &gt;&gt; to to the treasurers
[48:36] &gt;&gt; and also sister Esther gave I also
[48:39] announced that on Sunday,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; brother Daniel gave and uh these have
[48:45] all been sacrificial offerings
[48:50] and I have had to you know personally
[48:52] borrow some funds and and ensure that we
[48:54] we we meet our our deadline.
[49:00] And so I have the good news that I have
[49:02] for you today in that picture
[49:07] is that today we paid a total sum of 100
[49:10] million shillings.
[49:15] If you have been collecting money for
[49:16] four years, you know what this means to
[49:18] us.
[49:21] It's a total sacrifice.
[49:24] But we are so happy that we have been
[49:25] able to reach that milestone.
[49:29] So um so today we we we we topped up 90.
[49:34] We had already given him 10.
[49:39] So that is 100 out of 240
[49:43] and so we are remaining with a balance
[49:45] of 120.
[49:49] So we try to negotiate with him to give
[49:50] us a more
[49:53] um um payment schedule that is more
[49:56] friendly to us.
[50:00] But even then 8 months is still a lot
[50:05] for a business person.
[50:08] But incidentally we were able to at
[50:10] least get another deal which is better
[50:12] than eight months.
[50:17] Uh we are going to pay the balance in 12
[50:19] months.
[50:22] In 12 months
[50:24] from from today
[50:27] 12 months from today.
[50:30] So that uh which month are we in?
[50:35] We're beginning August. Yes. So by
[50:37] August next year,
[50:40] we must be done with that uh payment.
[50:43] You know, I was with the brothers. One
[50:45] of the brothers said pastor
[50:48] and actually it opened all our eyes
[50:49] those of us who were there.
[50:52] He said but uh if cuz it is 120.
[50:58] If each of the church members
[51:02] and those who are supporting us
[51:05] that are able and we we we count 100
[51:08] people
[51:11] who are able to produce
[51:14] uh 1.2 million
[51:18] in other words in our church if each
[51:20] person today can bring 1.2 2 million,
[51:24] [Music]
[51:27] not everybody. Only 100. But
[51:33] we can be able to pay all the 120.
[51:39] So everyone's eyes open.
[51:42] It doesn't have to be a few that are
[51:44] carrying the burden.
[51:48] We can set the goal. Others are able to
[51:51] give 10 million, others five, others
[51:53] three, others two, others one, others
[51:57] 10,000.
[51:58] But on average, if we can count that,
[52:01] everybody, you know, contributes 1.2
[52:03] million.
[52:06] [Music]
[52:08] and and um you know we keep giving
[52:10] within our weekly um weekly giving in
[52:12] our groups
[52:15] but you make a pledge
[52:18] um to give 100 uh 1.2 million within six
[52:22] months
[52:26] or within 8 months or 10 months whatever
[52:29] it is
[52:31] then we shall attain our goal.
[52:34] And so currently we are working on the
[52:36] on the on the on the plan for that
[52:40] [Music]
[52:42] and um when I'm back from Zimbabwe we
[52:44] shall be able to sit down as a church
[52:46] and
[52:49] and announce to you and discuss with you
[52:51] and see what exactly how we can
[52:54] operationalize that
[52:58] and make it work.
[53:00] But I want to encourage you as a church.
[53:04] We are more than able
[53:07] together.
[53:08] We are more than able.
[53:11] So we already have an agreement
[53:14] and the land is potentially ours.
[53:18] Is ours is ours.
[53:22] And I will tell you this, if we if we
[53:25] now pay extra 10 million,
[53:29] we will even get the first land title.
[53:34] He actually agreed to that
[53:36] &gt;&gt; and I felt that was also another
[53:38] wonderful thing
[53:40] because that that is that would be part
[53:42] payment of of the land because it is 22
[53:44] 240 I mean 220 rather I said 240 but
[53:46] it's 220. So that means each plot is
[53:49] 110.
[54:00] How many understand that? Yeah. So, um
[54:04] we will talk more about this.
[54:07] But for now, I just want to encourage
[54:09] you to double up
[54:12] in what you've been giving. Brother said
[54:15] now it will even be better now that we
[54:17] what we are paying. We we can see
[54:24] and and
[54:26] even they said, "Well, you can even use
[54:28] your land as far as um farming and if
[54:31] you want to grow some crops there or
[54:32] whatever."
[54:38] Well, then I said about farming, we
[54:42] don't want to farm because our faith may
[54:44] reduce. You may think that we will not
[54:46] get the money very soon.
[54:53] We are more than able to take that land.
[54:57] I want to speak like Joshua and Khalif.
[54:59] We are more than able. Tell your
[55:02] neighbor, we are more than able.
[55:05] Amen. Hallelujah. Already what has been
[55:07] done is a miracle.
[55:10] Four years, just a couple young people.
[55:15] It's it's it's it's a miracle.
[55:18] is a miracle and um we certainly thank
[55:21] God for that.
[55:24] So can we stand up on our feet and
[55:28] try to get into the word
[55:31] happy to see one of the elders brother
[55:32] Steven with us tonight.
[55:36] Bless you brother Steven.
[55:39] We always appreciate you.
[55:43] Um we're going to Colossians.
[55:49] chapter 2
[55:51] &gt;&gt; and I'll ask you to u pray with me
[55:54] first. We are also going to preach to
[55:55] evening light so I'll introduce that
[55:56] afterwards. Let's let's pray.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Father Lord we we've we've talked about
[56:04] the plan we have for the uh for our
[56:07] land.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Lord these are are things that are done
[56:14] by faith.
[56:17] If we were to do it according to what we
[56:19] see,
[56:22] we would not see any possibility.
[56:25] But Lord, it's more than what we see.
[56:29] It is what you have promised.
[56:33] For Lord, you did not promise that we
[56:37] will um you know live like poor people
[56:41] or live like low down people.
[56:46] But you promise that we shall be heads
[56:49] and not tails. We will build and
[56:52] inhabit.
[56:54] And Lord, all the good and perfect gifts
[56:57] come from God.
[57:01] It's our desire to have a place of
[57:02] worship,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; a place where um the mothers can be able
[57:08] to have a a a suitable place for their
[57:12] children,
[57:13] babies
[57:15] and and Lord, a a place where we can u
[57:18] we can call a holy sanctuary and
[57:23] and and go there to worship you in
[57:25] spirit and in fruit. And
[57:28] Lord, a place which we can call our own.
[57:32] Father, I remember when Abraham went to
[57:34] buy a piece of land where he would uh
[57:37] bury his wife and the rest of the
[57:39] people.
[57:44] And the people wanted to give it to him
[57:45] for free.
[57:47] He said, "I will not I will not take it
[57:49] for free.
[57:51] I will pay to the last dime."
[57:54] because he knew that no one can share
[57:57] your glory
[58:00] and that you had promised that you would
[58:01] bless him
[58:03] and that you would multiply his seed
[58:06] and that his seed would possess the gate
[58:08] of his enemies.
[58:10] And Lord, he knew who he was.
[58:13] And he knew that you were uh you were
[58:15] the owner of a of over of a thousand
[58:17] cattle on a hill.
[58:20] And father, you blessed his heart and he
[58:24] was able to purchase that piece of land
[58:26] right in Marapella, Lord. And father,
[58:30] Lord, I know that you bless a man
[58:32] according to his revelation.
[58:36] We ask your grace Lord and according to
[58:39] what you have revealed to us.
[58:41] May you bless the people financially
[58:45] as they give to you Lord that you will
[58:47] also uplift their own financial life
[58:51] that they will continue to support their
[58:52] families
[58:54] that as we wait for your coming Lord
[58:57] we will also live like sons of God right
[58:59] here.
[59:02] Not live sorry but live contented and
[59:05] happy.
[59:06] because of what you promised to us.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Father, I commit the congregation into
[59:12] your hands. The people that are going to
[59:14] listen to me preach tonight.
[59:16] Lord, may you help me. Take me out of
[59:19] the way. I have nothing good to say. I
[59:22] just ask you to help me Lord. And
[59:25] father, help my brother who is
[59:26] interpreting
[59:27] and help everybody to receive. Give us a
[59:30] good atmosphere, Lord. Father, we commit
[59:32] the service into your hands in the
[59:34] precious name of Jesus Christ.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; So tonight, I would like also to send
[59:42] our greetings to to evening light
[59:45] tabernacle
[59:48] tabernacle. We are streaming as well on
[59:51] Zoom
[59:53] and uh we send our greetings from uh
[59:55] here at DV.
[59:59] So I've been you know dealing with a
[1:00:01] series of uh of of sermons and I don't
[1:00:04] know whether to call it a series of
[1:00:05] sermons but I've been deal dealing with
[1:00:07] a a series of this subject
[1:00:12] of our true origin
[1:00:15] different inspirations
[1:00:19] and today we are talking about God
[1:00:21] having preeminence in his bride part
[1:00:23] four
[1:00:28] looks like I've not been able to bring
[1:00:29] that to an end.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; So let's see what the Lord will have for
[1:00:34] us tonight.
[1:00:37] So we are reading out of Colossians
[1:00:39] chapter 2
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:43] and uh we will read a few verses out of
[1:00:44] that
[1:00:47] if you are there. Let us read together.
[1:00:50] Beware, lest any man spoil you through
[1:00:53] philosophy and vain deceit, after the
[1:00:55] tradition of men, after the rudiments of
[1:00:58] the world, and not after Christ.
[1:01:12] For in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:01:15] the godhead bodily and and ye are
[1:01:18] complete in him which is the head of all
[1:01:20] principality and power.
[1:01:33] Amen. You may be seated. God bless you.
[1:01:36] May May the Holy Spirit help us tonight.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; So um we
[1:01:48] we have talked about Colossians chapter
[1:01:51] 2 8
[1:01:55] quite extensively.
[1:01:58] And tonight I'd like us to continue a
[1:02:00] little bit.
[1:02:03] Let be aware lest any man spoil you
[1:02:08] through philosophy.
[1:02:11] And we've talked about philosophy.
[1:02:14] We've talked about vain deceit,
[1:02:17] tradition of men, rudiments of the
[1:02:19] world.
[1:02:21] And you see all these things combined
[1:02:23] together.
[1:02:25] We saw that it is actually the beginning
[1:02:28] or the uh the um the root cause of of uh
[1:02:33] cults
[1:02:35] coming into formation.
[1:02:40] And we talked about cults and I told and
[1:02:42] I showed I tried to show you that you
[1:02:44] know cults are are groups of people that
[1:02:48] pay their allegiance to a man
[1:02:56] you know more than anything.
[1:03:00] If the man said it then it is true.
[1:03:04] And uh we also found out that uh uh I I
[1:03:08] tried to give you a definition of uh
[1:03:10] what a cult is and I showed you that it
[1:03:12] can also signify intense devotion to a
[1:03:14] person.
[1:03:22] Giving themselves to a either a person
[1:03:25] or an idea.
[1:03:30] So it doesn't have only to be religious.
[1:03:33] It can even be political.
[1:03:36] It can even be social. It can be you
[1:03:38] know a cult is not only only exclusive
[1:03:41] to religion.
[1:03:44] It is just a group of people that have
[1:03:47] intense devotion to something,
[1:03:53] a person, an idea, a lifestyle and and
[1:03:58] you know instead of Christ
[1:04:02] And you know the Bible says also that
[1:04:05] they worship the creature more than the
[1:04:07] creator.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And I showed you and I've been trying to
[1:04:13] show you that you see these will believe
[1:04:15] it as long as their man said it.
[1:04:22] All their heart, their mind, their
[1:04:25] everything is towards that man.
[1:04:30] If you speak about that man then you are
[1:04:33] in danger with them.
[1:04:36] Then they will exclude you.
[1:04:38] Then they will feel bad about you.
[1:04:41] Then they will dysfellowship you. They
[1:04:44] will excommunicate you because they feel
[1:04:46] you are not a part of their set of
[1:04:50] belief system.
[1:04:54] And I try to show you also that a cult
[1:04:56] is very close to what a denomination is.
[1:05:02] Because you see, a denomination is a
[1:05:04] group of people
[1:05:07] that organize
[1:05:09] under a set of beliefs.
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:14] And that's what philosophy means.
[1:05:17] Philosophy means a set of beliefs a
[1:05:19] creed.
[1:05:22] You know, they will tell you that we
[1:05:24] believe A B C D E F G full stop.
[1:05:28] So if you dare say anything that is out
[1:05:32] of what they believe
[1:05:35] even if it is in the Bible
[1:05:38] they will push you away they will
[1:05:40] excommunicate you and that's what every
[1:05:43] denomination is
[1:05:45] and that's why brother Bham preached a
[1:05:46] message and he titled it why are we not
[1:05:48] a denomination
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:52] and and this is what I'm trying to show
[1:05:53] you that indeed the message came to put
[1:05:57] await or to divorce the bride away from
[1:05:59] denominations
[1:06:04] because denominations were giving us
[1:06:07] over to the rulership of a man
[1:06:11] or to a a rulership of of of of a a
[1:06:14] belief system
[1:06:17] and and or or to a you know a allegiance
[1:06:20] to a a society or an organization
[1:06:25] or even or even a person
[1:06:28] you know and we even today even here in
[1:06:31] camp we have many cults
[1:06:34] potentially a denomination is a cult
[1:06:41] I will tell you that for sure because if
[1:06:42] you see the definition of a cult
[1:06:45] and a definition of a denomination
[1:06:48] it is almost the same
[1:06:51] you see you will tell them where do you
[1:06:52] get your authority
[1:06:55] to say what you
[1:06:56] They'll tell you, "Well, our our
[1:06:59] religion says so."
[1:07:01] Today, if you go on the road and and
[1:07:03] take a microphone and begin to preach
[1:07:04] the things that are in the Bible,
[1:07:08] you preach against Trinity,
[1:07:11] you preach against women preachers.
[1:07:14] You preach against, you know, the
[1:07:16] systems of man.
[1:07:18] Then you talk against speaking in
[1:07:20] tongues without interpretation,
[1:07:24] you know, and you talk about all these
[1:07:26] things that are actually being done in
[1:07:28] our churches or denominational churches
[1:07:30] today.
[1:07:32] People will close their ears. Others can
[1:07:35] even be offended
[1:07:37] at you. I've actually seen some videos
[1:07:39] online where when a preacher went out to
[1:07:42] preach,
[1:07:44] people came and slapped him or others
[1:07:47] called police officers to come and
[1:07:49] arrest them simply because they were
[1:07:51] offending their religions.
[1:07:54] They were offending their cults.
[1:07:58] They have offending their denomination.
[1:08:01] But you see this message of the hour, it
[1:08:04] came to show us our true origin.
[1:08:07] Now when we know our true origin, we
[1:08:10] will know we are set loose. We are cut
[1:08:12] loose from any denominational system.
[1:08:18] They will tell you when you leave our
[1:08:20] church, you are lost.
[1:08:22] They will tell you when you leave our
[1:08:24] denomination, you are going to hell.
[1:08:27] And that's what happened in the dark
[1:08:28] ages. That's even what happened during
[1:08:31] the days of of Luther and Whizzley.
[1:08:34] We see what did they what did the Roman
[1:08:35] Catholic Church do? They would take
[1:08:38] these people simply because you know
[1:08:41] what what would be their offense
[1:08:44] because they try to read scripture
[1:08:47] or to interpret scripture into the
[1:08:49] common language.
[1:08:50] [Music]
[1:08:52] They will take literally take these
[1:08:54] people and then they burn them with fire
[1:08:59] after claiming
[1:09:01] that they have removed them from the
[1:09:04] grace of going to heaven
[1:09:08] and they're saying they are going to
[1:09:09] hell
[1:09:11] and that the church will help them to
[1:09:13] send them quicker by burning them with
[1:09:15] fire.
[1:09:18] One of the people they burnt
[1:09:21] was a man who helped us to have this
[1:09:23] Bible today
[1:09:26] and his name is is William Tinddale.
[1:09:30] He was burnt at the stake
[1:09:33] because he translated the scriptures
[1:09:36] into the common language of the people
[1:09:37] there
[1:09:40] called English. And you know they had
[1:09:42] their own translations of scriptures
[1:09:47] into the Latin and and and that was
[1:09:51] completely a mess.
[1:09:54] Their translation was not right.
[1:09:58] It was, you know, not correct actually,
[1:10:01] but they wanted the people to be to read
[1:10:04] those incorrect translations.
[1:10:08] They they were trying to suppress the
[1:10:10] people.
[1:10:11] The Bible called it in in the beginning
[1:10:13] a deed of the Nicolant
[1:10:17] and then later on he called it the
[1:10:20] doctrine of the Nicolant.
[1:10:23] And a prophet told us what it is.
[1:10:26] He said the doctrine of the nicolant
[1:10:29] is where a certain group of a few elders
[1:10:35] or a few so-called bishops or pastors or
[1:10:38] teachers
[1:10:40] where they physically assert authority
[1:10:43] over the entire congregation
[1:10:47] where you have a holy priesthood
[1:10:51] that is the the clergy and then you have
[1:10:54] the lady the people
[1:10:57] and the people have no say
[1:11:00] because the spirit works through the
[1:11:01] leaders,
[1:11:03] the spirit works through the the bishops
[1:11:05] and the pastors.
[1:11:07] And that was brother Banham called it
[1:11:09] the doctrine of the Nicolante
[1:11:13] where you cannot claim that you have
[1:11:15] heard from God
[1:11:18] but they will tell you God how what
[1:11:22] did God find you? How did he begin to
[1:11:25] speak to you? You are not ordained as a
[1:11:28] priest.
[1:11:30] To them, God only spoke to an ordained
[1:11:32] person.
[1:11:35] And that is philosophy.
[1:11:37] That is vain deceit. That is tradition
[1:11:40] of men. That's rudiments of the world.
[1:11:44] And in every age in every generation,
[1:11:47] God raised a standard
[1:11:50] higher than what the devil was doing.
[1:11:53] And the standard the the Lord raised
[1:11:56] was to send a man in every generation
[1:11:59] with a revelation of the true word of
[1:12:02] God.
[1:12:04] And that true word of God in every
[1:12:07] generation liberated the people
[1:12:11] and set them free from the clause of
[1:12:15] religion, from the clause of
[1:12:17] denominationalism, from the from the
[1:12:19] tradition of men, from philosophy, from
[1:12:23] vain deceit.
[1:12:25] And we've talked about many traditions
[1:12:28] even in this message that people are
[1:12:31] trying to carry around.
[1:12:33] But I want to tell to show you and I
[1:12:35] have already showed you many times that
[1:12:37] the Lord has set us free
[1:12:41] from everything
[1:12:44] that that is to do with traditions of
[1:12:45] men.
[1:12:47] And what this message is all about.
[1:12:51] This message is about Christ.
[1:12:54] It's all about Christ.
[1:12:57] Praise the name of the Lord. And even
[1:12:58] where you find men
[1:13:01] trying to glue or point us to a man
[1:13:07] is a shame.
[1:13:09] Men claiming to believe this message.
[1:13:12] But then they would say their only their
[1:13:14] job is to point men to brother Brham.
[1:13:19] This messenger did not come to point us
[1:13:21] to brother Brham.
[1:13:24] This message is not about brother Brham.
[1:13:27] Brother,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; this message is about Christ.
[1:13:31] Brother Brham was a carrier of the
[1:13:32] message. He was only a preacher.
[1:13:36] He was only a messenger.
[1:13:39] And he said, "I preach what Paul
[1:13:41] preached."
[1:13:44] And what what did Paul preach? Paul
[1:13:47] preached Christ.
[1:13:48] 1 Corinthians 3:10. according to the
[1:13:51] grace of God which is given unto me.
[1:13:53] Paul said
[1:13:55] as a wise master builder,
[1:13:59] I have laid a foundation. I have laid a
[1:14:02] foundation and another build there on.
[1:14:05] But let every man take heed how he
[1:14:07] buildth there upon.
[1:14:11] For other foundation can no man lay
[1:14:17] than that that is laid.
[1:14:20] And then he said, "What is the
[1:14:21] foundation?"
[1:14:23] Jesus Christ.
[1:14:26] Amen. So it's all about Christ. And and
[1:14:29] brother Bam said, "I preach what Paul
[1:14:31] preached."
[1:14:33] So which means what brother Bam preached
[1:14:36] was not amen about him. It was not about
[1:14:40] him. I said it was not about him. It was
[1:14:44] about Christ. The one that died for us.
[1:14:48] the one that gave his life for us. If
[1:14:50] there is anything in this world
[1:14:53] that has tried to remove people from
[1:14:55] denationalism and cult
[1:15:00] is the message of God,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; but the ones in the cult,
[1:15:07] the ones in the denominations, they will
[1:15:09] not believe it
[1:15:12] and they will actually call you cult.
[1:15:16] And even they did to Paul.
[1:15:18] And Paul said the way
[1:15:21] they call heresy.
[1:15:24] Amen. The word they call heresy.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. I worship the God of my fathers.
[1:15:32] The word they call a clown.
[1:15:35] I worship the God of my fathers.
[1:15:41] For other foundation can no man lay
[1:15:45] than that which is already laid.
[1:15:47] And that is Jesus Christ.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; And by the banham said here in the
[1:15:51] regime of ages, I sincerely believe that
[1:15:55] the spirit of God has been speaking to
[1:15:57] us.
[1:15:59] And listen very carefully because this
[1:16:01] is a defining moment of brother Banam's
[1:16:03] message.
[1:16:07] Not only teaching us the truths of the
[1:16:09] ages,
[1:16:10] but he has been faithfully dealing with
[1:16:13] hearts that they may turn to him.
[1:16:18] That is the reason for all preaching.
[1:16:22] That is the reason for all teaching.
[1:16:26] For it is it is in the preaching and
[1:16:28] teaching of the word
[1:16:32] that the sheep hear the voice of God
[1:16:35] and follow him.
[1:16:38] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And
[1:16:41] even today there is preaching and
[1:16:43] teaching of the word.
[1:16:46] Because what Jesus did then he will do
[1:16:48] today he will do forever.
[1:16:52] And he says not for one moment
[1:16:56] do I bring a message to the people
[1:17:00] that I that they may follow me
[1:17:03] or join my church.
[1:17:06] Are you hearing now? I want you to
[1:17:08] understand what brother Bham is saying.
[1:17:12] He's giving a disclaimer.
[1:17:16] He said, "I do not bring a message
[1:17:21] that people may follow me."
[1:17:25] So if you're following Brother Brham,
[1:17:28] that's not the reason why he brought the
[1:17:30] message.
[1:17:32] Are you following what I'm saying?
[1:17:35] This message is not so that we may
[1:17:39] follow. Brother Baron
[1:17:42] And then he says, I did not even bring
[1:17:43] it that you may join my church.
[1:17:47] So if you join the church of brother
[1:17:49] Brham,
[1:17:51] that doesn't mean you have received the
[1:17:53] message.
[1:17:54] That is not even his purpose.
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] That's why I believe that's why they
[1:18:02] named his church tabernacle
[1:18:06] because he never intended to start a
[1:18:08] denomination.
[1:18:10] Trust me, if his church was called
[1:18:13] something like Capstone Church or
[1:18:14] Capstone Tabernacle or something,
[1:18:18] all of us would be named after them
[1:18:22] and it would be a big denomination all
[1:18:23] over the world.
[1:18:26] But who wants to name his church?
[1:18:30] Because we know better.
[1:18:32] That was a place where he was preaching.
[1:18:37] So that's why they named it that
[1:18:41] God. You know that church was called
[1:18:42] Apostolic
[1:18:44] Pentecostal Tabernacle at first
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; but they had to change it. God makes no
[1:18:51] mistakes
[1:18:53] because he didn't want to start a
[1:18:55] denomination.
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:58] And again he says, "Oh, start some
[1:19:00] fellowship and organization.
[1:19:06] So there is no organization
[1:19:08] that you can tell me we all believers
[1:19:11] need to be a part of.
[1:19:16] There is a reason why we have no
[1:19:18] umbrella.
[1:19:22] There is a reason friends and let me
[1:19:24] also say this. It is impossible to have
[1:19:27] one.
[1:19:30] It is impossible to have one.
[1:19:32] You can try it. It cannot work. Why?
[1:19:37] Simply because the way the message is,
[1:19:40] the way God package the message, it came
[1:19:43] in such a way it is impossible to be
[1:19:46] denominated.
[1:19:50] When brother Bam had preached for like
[1:19:52] 30 years,
[1:19:55] he said is now 30 years
[1:19:58] you know the message going forward.
[1:20:01] But we have not formed any denomination.
[1:20:04] We have not formed an organization.
[1:20:07] It's now more than 50 years.
[1:20:12] It's not formed a denomination
[1:20:15] because this message did not come for a
[1:20:19] group of people.
[1:20:21] This message came for individuals.
[1:20:24] And these individuals are scattered all
[1:20:26] over the world.
[1:20:29] in small groups here in big groups there
[1:20:31] you know
[1:20:33] some a few handful hundred a thousand
[1:20:37] tens of thousand but I can tell you they
[1:20:39] are scattered all over the world.
[1:20:42] Amen. And he says I have never done that
[1:20:47] and I will not do that now. I have no
[1:20:50] interest in those things. But I do have
[1:20:53] an interest in the things of God and
[1:20:57] people.
[1:21:01] He said his interest was in the things
[1:21:04] of God
[1:21:06] and people. The things of God is the
[1:21:09] word of God. We will see it.
[1:21:13] And if I can accomplish just one thing,
[1:21:18] I will be satisfied.
[1:21:21] Now I want us to see what was that one
[1:21:24] thing
[1:21:27] that our prophet desired to accomplish
[1:21:31] that would satisfy him that would make
[1:21:34] him feel like I have accomplished my
[1:21:36] purpose.
[1:21:39] She said that one thing
[1:21:42] is to see established
[1:21:44] a true relationship
[1:21:47] between God and man,
[1:21:52] between God and man.
[1:21:54] You cannot do that without pointing
[1:21:57] people to Christ
[1:22:00] because it was only Christ that was able
[1:22:03] to die, that was able to aim and
[1:22:06] resurrect again. And he was the one who
[1:22:09] brided the gap
[1:22:11] between sin and death
[1:22:15] wherein men become new creations in
[1:22:17] Christ.
[1:22:20] Amen. He says, "I want to see that
[1:22:22] relationship."
[1:22:25] How many believers today
[1:22:27] have a relationship between God and
[1:22:30] themselves?
[1:22:32] How many? Very many don't. And it is so
[1:22:36] sad. Many think they have to believe a
[1:22:38] set of rules or doctrines
[1:22:42] and they have tried to make this message
[1:22:44] a set of rules.
[1:22:48] Oh, can I preach to you this evening?
[1:22:50] The message is more than rules.
[1:22:53] The message is more than doctrines.
[1:22:57] It is more than teachings of God.
[1:23:02] It is a revelation.
[1:23:05] Because the church of Jesus Christ is
[1:23:07] built upon the revelation
[1:23:11] of who Jesus Christ is.
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ wants to have the
[1:23:16] preeminence
[1:23:18] in his church.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And then he says, I will be satisfied
[1:23:26] if they can have a relationship between
[1:23:27] God and men
[1:23:29] wherein men become new creations in
[1:23:31] Christ.
[1:23:34] filled with the with his spirit
[1:23:38] and living according to his word.
[1:23:42] Many think being filled with the Holy
[1:23:44] Spirit is a mere revelation
[1:23:49] with no manifestation.
[1:23:52] But if time allows, we're going to we
[1:23:54] are going to try to talk about that.
[1:23:57] He says, "I want to see men filled with
[1:23:59] the spirit
[1:24:01] and men living according to his word.
[1:24:04] And I would invite and bleed and want
[1:24:06] all to hear his voice at this time
[1:24:11] and yield your lives
[1:24:13] completely to him
[1:24:16] even as I trust in my heart that I have
[1:24:19] given my all to him."
[1:24:22] So it's all about Christ.
[1:24:25] And then he finishes up by saying, "God
[1:24:26] bless you and may his coming rejoice
[1:24:29] your heart.
[1:24:31] It's all about him who is coming. It's
[1:24:33] all about Christ."
[1:24:36] Oh my my my my. Help me preach to you
[1:24:38] this evening. It's not about brother
[1:24:40] Brana. It's not about Tabernacle. It's
[1:24:43] not about any association or
[1:24:46] organization.
[1:24:49] It's about the word.
[1:24:52] It's about Christ. him having the
[1:24:55] preeminence in your life. You having a
[1:24:58] relationship with him, having a personal
[1:25:01] walk with him.
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:05] Colossians 1:26.
[1:25:08] He says, "Even the mystery
[1:25:11] which has been hid from all from ages
[1:25:14] and from generations, but now is made
[1:25:17] manifest to his saints,
[1:25:20] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:25:23] riches of the glor of of the glory of
[1:25:25] this mystery among the Gentiles.
[1:25:40] which is Christ in you.
[1:25:44] And brother Bham said that's my purpose.
[1:25:50] Do you realize
[1:25:52] that brother Bham came as a seventh
[1:25:55] angel messenger
[1:25:57] to finish that mystery
[1:26:00] to oh my good Lord to finish that
[1:26:03] mystery.
[1:26:05] Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:26:11] angel. And then here he said, "I plead
[1:26:14] and I want all
[1:26:17] to hear his voice at this time
[1:26:22] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:26:24] angel. When he begins to sound, the
[1:26:27] mystery of God
[1:26:29] will be finished.
[1:26:32] given the mystery
[1:26:34] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:26:37] generations, but now he's made manifest
[1:26:42] to his saints.
[1:26:44] Not to everybody, not to everybody, not
[1:26:47] to denomination, not to religion, not to
[1:26:50] cult, to the saints.
[1:26:54] The saints are the redeemed of the Lord.
[1:26:57] Amen. They that have been born again,
[1:27:00] born of the world.
[1:27:03] Amen. And he says to whom God would make
[1:27:05] known
[1:27:08] what is the riches of the glory
[1:27:11] of this mystery among the Gentiles which
[1:27:15] is Christ in you the hope of glory whom
[1:27:19] we preach warning every man teaching
[1:27:23] every man in all wisdom that we may
[1:27:26] present every man
[1:27:29] perfect in Christ.
[1:27:32] Can you see it church? This is not about
[1:27:35] our little little church names.
[1:27:39] You find people so clouded
[1:27:43] in their church names
[1:27:45] selling the brand of their church.
[1:27:49] Listen, we are not here to sell church
[1:27:51] name brand.
[1:27:54] Our church name brand has nothing to do
[1:27:56] with it.
[1:27:59] If we love our church name so much,
[1:28:03] Then we are like the rest of the
[1:28:04] denominations.
[1:28:06] You find people so obsessed with who
[1:28:09] their pastor is. People are so obsessed
[1:28:13] with what they have accomplished as a
[1:28:15] church or now we have a church building
[1:28:19] or now we have 500 following us 1,000
[1:28:22] 20,000.
[1:28:24] And brother Bam said that's what the
[1:28:26] denominations were doing.
[1:28:28] They were so busting because they had
[1:28:31] the numbers.
[1:28:33] But let me tell you brother, sister, the
[1:28:35] move we are in is higher than that. We
[1:28:39] are no longer looking or seeking for
[1:28:41] numbers. We are no longer looking or
[1:28:43] seeking for our church name. For knowing
[1:28:46] who our pastor is and all that is good,
[1:28:50] but rather we are looking for one thing.
[1:28:52] That Christ may be seen. That Christ may
[1:28:56] be magnified. that Christ may be
[1:28:58] glorified in your life as an individual.
[1:29:02] If he is not glorified, if he's not
[1:29:05] seen, you will not go in the rapture.
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:16] He says, "Then whom we preach, warning
[1:29:20] every man and teaching every man in all
[1:29:22] wisdom, that we may present every man
[1:29:25] perfect in Christ,
[1:29:29] Amen. Where I also labor striving
[1:29:32] according to his working
[1:29:35] which workketh in me mighty.
[1:29:38] Amen. If you're a minister, it's not
[1:29:40] about you. It's about the working of
[1:29:43] Christ in you. Amen. If you're
[1:29:46] preaching, let them see Christ. If
[1:29:49] you're singing, let them see Christ. If
[1:29:52] you're playing an instrument, oh, let it
[1:29:54] be about Christ.
[1:29:56] Glory to God. It's not about you.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's all about him. Amen.
[1:30:04] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:30:07] A prophet says God has had a three-fold
[1:30:09] purpose.
[1:30:12] A three-fold purpose.
[1:30:15] In this great mystery
[1:30:17] secret,
[1:30:19] God in his great mystery secret
[1:30:24] that he had before the world began,
[1:30:28] he has got a threefold purpose in it.
[1:30:33] Oh, glory to God. This mystery secret
[1:30:38] was a secret. will be a secret will
[1:30:42] remain a secret until the days of the
[1:30:44] voice of the seventh angel. When he
[1:30:47] begins to sound, then this mystery
[1:30:50] secret will be unveiled
[1:30:54] will be opened.
[1:30:56] And then here he says it has a
[1:30:58] three-fold purpose in it.
[1:31:01] God had this mystery secret
[1:31:04] before the world began.
[1:31:08] And now what have we it says what we
[1:31:11] want to go upon this morning
[1:31:14] is what is that three-fold purpose.
[1:31:21] Now I believe by the help of the God who
[1:31:23] is present
[1:31:26] he will show you to us. Now if he had
[1:31:28] this three-fold purpose
[1:31:32] we want to find out what is this
[1:31:34] three-fold purpose.
[1:31:37] The first thing was
[1:31:40] that God
[1:31:41] wanted to reveal himself to the people.
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:49] Are you following me now? I'm I'm giving
[1:31:52] you bride food.
[1:31:55] This is bride material.
[1:31:57] This is not for chicken.
[1:32:01] This is for eag. Are you an eagle
[1:32:03] tonight?
[1:32:05] Amen. And God wanted to reveal himself
[1:32:09] to the people in this first mystery,
[1:32:13] first phase,
[1:32:15] first purpose.
[1:32:17] He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah,
[1:32:21] who covered all space,
[1:32:24] who covered all time, who covered all
[1:32:27] eternity.
[1:32:29] He could not do it. He is too great to
[1:32:32] be revealed to the people.
[1:32:36] because it would be too mysterious.
[1:32:41] God in this great mystery secret
[1:32:47] which was hid through ages which was hid
[1:32:50] through generations.
[1:32:52] He wanted to reveal himself
[1:32:55] to his people. But then he says he could
[1:32:59] not do it as the eternal God
[1:33:04] that covered all space and time and
[1:33:06] eternity.
[1:33:07] He was too great to do that.
[1:33:10] Oh, if he did it, it would have been too
[1:33:13] mysterious
[1:33:15] for us to understand.
[1:33:18] So how could that great being that never
[1:33:20] did begin that after you went beyond a
[1:33:23] cycle of hundreds and billions and
[1:33:25] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:33:27] light of space and onto out into the
[1:33:30] infinite
[1:33:32] into the eternity and a great scripture
[1:33:35] that was all that and still is. Can you
[1:33:39] describe that? He's just describing the
[1:33:42] greatness of God.
[1:33:46] He was there.
[1:33:48] He went beyond
[1:33:50] hundreds and billions and trillions and
[1:33:52] trillions and trillions of years
[1:33:56] of light space
[1:33:58] and on out into the infinite
[1:34:02] into the eternity.
[1:34:04] Oh, what a great creature. Oh.
[1:34:08] But what he wanted to do,
[1:34:11] he loved fatherhood.
[1:34:14] He want he was a father. And the only
[1:34:18] way that he could express
[1:34:21] it was to become a son,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; a man. Oh my. Glory to God. God, the
[1:34:29] infinite God,
[1:34:31] the great eternal God.
[1:34:34] Amen. He wanted to express himself
[1:34:38] as a father. But then he says he
[1:34:40] couldn't do that.
[1:34:42] He had to express himself as a son,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; as a man.
[1:34:49] That's the reason Jesus kept saying,
[1:34:52] the son of man.
[1:34:56] See, they didn't know what he was
[1:34:58] talking about.
[1:35:01] Many of them
[1:35:03] them that are following philosophy, them
[1:35:06] that are following vain sick, them that
[1:35:08] are following tradition of men, they did
[1:35:11] not know many of them. But now, do you
[1:35:15] get it?
[1:35:17] He wanted to express himself.
[1:35:20] That was his one of his great threefold
[1:35:23] purposes.
[1:35:28] He was to express himself
[1:35:30] to identify himself with human beings to
[1:35:35] reveal himself
[1:35:38] in
[1:35:40] oh my don't miss this. He wanted to
[1:35:41] reveal himself
[1:35:44] in Christ.
[1:35:47] Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Are you following now? God, that great
[1:35:51] eternal God. He wanted to reveal himself
[1:35:55] in Christ. That's why the Bible says
[1:35:59] Jesus was born.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; The Christ
[1:36:05] my children are born.
[1:36:10] You are born.
[1:36:13] Some of you are born the
[1:36:16] Are you following me now? But there was
[1:36:18] one that was born. See Christ
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:25] is a mystery of God revealed.
[1:36:28] You know he was revealing
[1:36:31] God himself
[1:36:33] tabernacle in man.
[1:36:38] Oh my my they did not understand that.
[1:36:41] They didn't understand that. So when
[1:36:43] Peter stands up on the day of Pentecost
[1:36:46] and he says, "Let this be known unto you
[1:36:50] that uh the Jesus
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; whom you have crucified
[1:36:55] God has made him both Lord
[1:36:59] and Christ." They didn't understand what
[1:37:02] he meant.
[1:37:04] They didn't understand he was meaning he
[1:37:08] was the revelation
[1:37:10] of the very God that created heaven and
[1:37:13] earth.
[1:37:15] Christ was a real revelation
[1:37:18] of the godhead.
[1:37:25] Amen. And that was his first forward
[1:37:27] purpose.
[1:37:30] And his second for purpose,
[1:37:34] this is the most exciting one for me
[1:37:38] is to have the preeminence.
[1:37:42] Now I'm arriving finally at our subject
[1:37:46] to have the preeminence
[1:37:49] in his body of believers.
[1:37:54] That is his bride
[1:37:57] that he might live in his people.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wanted to live in us.
[1:38:05] This mystery I'm talking about. It is to
[1:38:08] reveal the glory.
[1:38:10] It is to manifest the power and the
[1:38:13] glory of God.
[1:38:15] He himself wanted to come down and have
[1:38:20] preeminence.
[1:38:22] Not in a holy priesthood
[1:38:24] in a people.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; In a people,
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; you and me,
[1:38:33] he might live in his people.
[1:38:36] Now he could do that in he could do that
[1:38:38] in Adam and Eve
[1:38:41] but sin
[1:38:43] separated them.
[1:38:48] When we talk about our true origin
[1:38:54] I am not actually talking about Genesis
[1:38:56] 2
[1:38:58] because right now we are the man of
[1:39:01] Genesis 3.
[1:39:06] We are the fallen man.
[1:39:10] In Genesis 3, we are the fallen man,
[1:39:15] right?
[1:39:17] That's true.
[1:39:20] We are not in his image anymore.
[1:39:23] That's why we need to be restored back
[1:39:24] again.
[1:39:26] We need to be redeemed back again.
[1:39:29] In Genesis chapter 2, it was a
[1:39:32] manifested man
[1:39:34] into a body of flesh.
[1:39:38] Because in Genesis 2, you find the man
[1:39:42] Adam and the woman who was a part of the
[1:39:46] man. Because literally the word woman
[1:39:49] means a part of a man.
[1:39:54] But in Genesis 3, the man you see there
[1:39:58] is Adam, the man
[1:40:00] and Eve,
[1:40:02] mother of all living
[1:40:07] and and and brother Bham then talks
[1:40:08] about the hybriding
[1:40:11] and he talks about her as the greatest
[1:40:13] or she's or this kind of woman the
[1:40:15] greatest biggest hybrid.
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:22] Hybrid. Yes,
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; it is not in the purpose of God for for
[1:40:25] for hybriding the seed.
[1:40:31] But we see in Genesis 3, there is a
[1:40:34] hybrid that actually took place.
[1:40:38] The Bible says that so is is a way of an
[1:40:41] adulterous woman.
[1:40:43] She eats and wipes her mouth and says,
[1:40:46] "I've done no evil."
[1:40:48] We we know what the evil was. It was
[1:40:51] adultery. She ate from two seeds. She
[1:40:55] received of two seeds. She received of
[1:40:58] the seed of Adam, the son of God in the
[1:41:00] image of God, and then received from the
[1:41:02] serpent. And so then it it brought forth
[1:41:06] in her womb two different kind of seeds.
[1:41:10] This was a hybrid. It was not in the in
[1:41:13] the purpose in the plan of God.
[1:41:16] And we are all born like that.
[1:41:19] That's why the Bible says all of us have
[1:41:21] are born short of the glory.
[1:41:25] We come short of the glory.
[1:41:28] We cannot be in that image. We cannot be
[1:41:31] in that glory. Therefore, we our eyes of
[1:41:34] understanding
[1:41:36] a void to the mystery of God.
[1:41:41] Because the mystery of God, the twofold
[1:41:44] purpose, the second fault purpose of it,
[1:41:47] the second fold purpose of it is that
[1:41:49] God must be revealed or manifested or
[1:41:52] must have preeminence in his people.
[1:41:59] Genesis 3, man has lost the preeminence.
[1:42:03] Man has lost his identity.
[1:42:07] Genesis 2, that's when it happened
[1:42:12] when when when man who was spoken into
[1:42:14] existence
[1:42:17] and molded through out of the earth.
[1:42:21] Then we find that the devil took
[1:42:23] advantage of that.
[1:42:26] They were not in
[1:42:28] they had not known no sin.
[1:42:31] They were perfect as far as sinning is
[1:42:33] concerned.
[1:42:36] But the devil found them
[1:42:39] in that body.
[1:42:42] So when we talk about our true origin,
[1:42:45] I am not talking about that body.
[1:42:49] I'm talking about Genesis 1.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah. In Genesis 1,
[1:42:56] there is nowhere
[1:42:59] the devil could get man.
[1:43:04] He was he was in Christ.
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; He was a part of him.
[1:43:14] Let there be man in our image. And so
[1:43:18] God created man
[1:43:21] in his own image.
[1:43:26] Even the mystery
[1:43:28] which was
[1:43:31] praise the name of the Lord which was
[1:43:34] from ages and from generations but now
[1:43:38] it is made manifest with saints. Amen.
[1:43:42] And then he continues and he says which
[1:43:45] is Christ in you
[1:43:48] the hope of glory.
[1:43:51] So we have now at this level returned to
[1:43:54] the glory which we had with God in
[1:43:58] Christ.
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:13] You see, it's a process.
[1:44:16] Praise the name of the Lord. There's one
[1:44:19] that is happening now
[1:44:21] being positionally blessed
[1:44:24] in our rightful place in Christ.
[1:44:27] Amen. In the right positions and
[1:44:30] authority
[1:44:31] in Christ, in heavenly places in Christ,
[1:44:35] all those things happen in Christ.
[1:44:39] But then there's a second one that
[1:44:41] actually will now happen
[1:44:44] as our bodies
[1:44:46] are being translated.
[1:44:50] That is the final act
[1:44:53] of adoption
[1:44:55] that we are now waiting for.
[1:44:59] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:45:01] Now let's continue here a little bit.
[1:45:03] And then he says, "But sin separated
[1:45:04] them."
[1:45:06] So now there had to be some way to get
[1:45:09] it back again.
[1:45:12] This is rich to me just to even think of
[1:45:15] it. So what God's purpose was now why
[1:45:20] didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like
[1:45:22] that
[1:45:24] then he would never be able to express
[1:45:27] his fullness
[1:45:32] his full attribute
[1:45:35] because he could have been a father
[1:45:37] there.
[1:45:40] That's true. But also he's a savior. You
[1:45:44] say how do you know he was
[1:45:47] He is because I've had the experience.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; How many can How many know tonight God
[1:45:54] is a savior?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you know he is?
[1:46:00] Well, I know because I've had experience
[1:46:03] he is a savior and he had to express
[1:46:06] that. And how could he do it? Only
[1:46:10] through Christ.
[1:46:14] How could he be a son? Only through
[1:46:17] Christ.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Come on now, church. How could he be a
[1:46:21] healer? Only through Christ. All things
[1:46:25] are wound up
[1:46:28] in that one person,
[1:46:31] Jesus Christ. When I think of it, he
[1:46:34] say, I just see denominations pass off a
[1:46:37] sin. My my my my
[1:46:40] you missed that one. When you see the
[1:46:43] clear picture,
[1:46:45] you see denominations disappearing.
[1:46:49] Brother Dixon, you seeominations
[1:46:52] disappearing.
[1:46:55] When you understand
[1:46:58] this is all about Christ
[1:47:00] and his brain
[1:47:03] no longer see any
[1:47:06] church
[1:47:12] things disappear then you begin seeing
[1:47:15] Christ.
[1:47:18] How could he be a healer?
[1:47:21] only through
[1:47:23] Christ.
[1:47:25] So now you are no longer going to see
[1:47:27] the great anointed man of God.
[1:47:31] How could he be a savior? Only through
[1:47:34] Christ. You no longer see your pastor as
[1:47:38] the only divine savior.
[1:47:41] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:47:45] Oh my. Don't you love this? Everything
[1:47:48] is wound up in him.
[1:47:51] all denominations
[1:47:53] pass of the scene
[1:47:56] and everything else just going see when
[1:47:59] I see God's great purpose
[1:48:02] revealing himself and having first
[1:48:05] revealed himself in Christ
[1:48:08] the fullness of the godhead body
[1:48:11] and then to bring that fullness
[1:48:15] of godhead bodly
[1:48:19] into a
[1:48:25] And then he could have the preeminences
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:30] meaning the oversight
[1:48:37] meaning the leading
[1:48:41] preeminence means the officer. over
[1:48:47] the overseer. In other words,
[1:48:53] we have seen so many pastors who want to
[1:48:55] call themselves overseers.
[1:48:59] The Bible calls Christ the bishop of our
[1:49:01] soul.
[1:49:05] He's a great big overseer.
[1:49:09] He's the lead one leading.
[1:49:12] Oh, if a church is led by Christ,
[1:49:15] the pastor is led by Christ, the
[1:49:18] brothers and sisters are led by Christ,
[1:49:20] we are not going to have any problem.
[1:49:24] We will stop looking at each other.
[1:49:27] Your brother will offend you. You will
[1:49:30] still love him because Christ is leading
[1:49:33] you. So and so will do something to you.
[1:49:36] You will still forgive them because
[1:49:39] Christ is leading you. But why do we
[1:49:42] have hatred among brothers? Hatred among
[1:49:46] sisters, among families, among churches,
[1:49:50] camps here, camps there, camps here,
[1:49:52] camps there, competition here,
[1:49:54] competition there. Why? Because there is
[1:49:57] no Christ in these people's hearts.
[1:50:01] The Bible said with their mouth they
[1:50:03] worship me,
[1:50:05] but they were with their works. They
[1:50:07] don't listen. This is the denomination.
[1:50:09] This is the generation we're living in.
[1:50:12] And now this message is calling us back
[1:50:16] to go back to Christ.
[1:50:19] [Applause]
[1:50:22] If you have Christ in your heart,
[1:50:25] you will love your enemy.
[1:50:29] And let me put it this way. You will
[1:50:32] have no enemy.
[1:50:37] Pastor, do you mean it literally?
[1:50:40] Yes.
[1:50:44] Can I announce something to you? I
[1:50:47] personally have no enemy in this world.
[1:50:51] If they told you they were my enemy,
[1:50:55] then they need help.
[1:50:57] I love them.
[1:51:00] Guess what? When he was on earth,
[1:51:04] he had no enemy.
[1:51:08] He loved everybody.
[1:51:10] It makes me love everybody.
[1:51:13] Makes me love everybody. Makes me love
[1:51:16] everybody. Is good enough to
[1:51:20] people bad brother.
[1:51:23] I agree with you.
[1:51:25] People are bad.
[1:51:27] So bad. You help somebody
[1:51:31] and they will go and kill you behind
[1:51:33] your back.
[1:51:35] That's right. That's what people are.
[1:51:39] But that's why Christ came.
[1:51:42] That's why Christ came. He came that
[1:51:45] they may have life and have it more
[1:51:48] abundantly.
[1:51:49] If Christ is in your heart, you will
[1:51:52] have no out against anybody.
[1:51:57] You'll have no bad heart. You will be
[1:52:00] forgiving. You will love everybody even
[1:52:04] when they do bad to you. You will still
[1:52:06] love and pray for them. I challenge you
[1:52:09] to love everybody. I challenge you to
[1:52:11] forgive everybody. I challenge you to
[1:52:13] have a good heart, a good spirit so that
[1:52:17] they may say you are his disciple
[1:52:22] if they see that you have love for one
[1:52:23] another.
[1:52:25] But be not as Cain
[1:52:28] who hated his brother and he killed him.
[1:52:33] He loved him not. He could not love
[1:52:36] because God is love.
[1:52:41] Don't be disheartened.
[1:52:43] That's why Christ came.
[1:52:47] Let Christ
[1:52:48] be expressed through you.
[1:52:52] Let's do a recap here now.
[1:52:54] First
[1:52:56] he came to express himself completely
[1:52:59] God in Christ.
[1:53:01] Second to have preeminences
[1:53:04] by this in his church which is his body
[1:53:07] the bride
[1:53:09] till he could have the preeminence to
[1:53:11] express himself through them.
[1:53:14] Oh help me express yourself through me.
[1:53:21] And thirdly, to restore the kingdom
[1:53:25] to its rightful position
[1:53:29] that fell by sin
[1:53:32] by the first Adam
[1:53:34] back to where he walked into the cool of
[1:53:36] the evening
[1:53:38] which his people talked with them,
[1:53:39] fellowshipped with them.
[1:53:43] And he goes ahead to talk about God
[1:53:44] becoming.
[1:53:47] I can as well say you are God becoming.
[1:53:53] God has become you.
[1:53:57] God has manifested himself.
[1:54:00] He says when Eve went away from the
[1:54:01] word,
[1:54:03] she went away from Hammet.
[1:54:06] And when the church goes away from the
[1:54:07] word to her denomination, she rejects
[1:54:10] and commits fornications with the world
[1:54:14] of man's wisdom, rejecting the authority
[1:54:17] of God's word.
[1:54:19] The Bible said committing spiritual
[1:54:20] fornications
[1:54:23] any word in the Bible that's rejected
[1:54:26] or if any self interpretation put to it
[1:54:31] is absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:54:33] adultery against the God that is in your
[1:54:36] that is your husband
[1:54:41] and anulterist never enters the kingdom
[1:54:43] of heaven.
[1:54:45] And you know the three the third food
[1:54:48] phase of this is that he may restore the
[1:54:50] kingdom.
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:56] That's what Eve done in the first place.
[1:54:59] So you see now you know we're going to
[1:55:01] have a kingdom.
[1:55:03] We're going to live in that kingdom in
[1:55:06] reality.
[1:55:08] In reality.
[1:55:10] Now notice again now watch this
[1:55:12] three-fold purpose.
[1:55:14] manifest manifest himself in Jesus
[1:55:16] Christ
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; to come into the body of Jesus by Jesus
[1:55:20] Christ
[1:55:22] to have the preeminences
[1:55:25] to what to restore back Eden
[1:55:29] bring back that which was lost.
[1:55:31] That was the only thing out of order.
[1:55:35] All the rest of his things was in order.
[1:55:39] Another prophet said he only has
[1:55:41] interest in the things of God.
[1:55:46] And the only thing that is out of order
[1:55:49] is what happened in Eden.
[1:55:52] Must Eden must be restored.
[1:55:55] The domain of God on earth through the
[1:55:58] man must be restored.
[1:56:02] But he had to let he had to put on free
[1:56:05] moral agency to fall
[1:56:09] so that he might be a savior
[1:56:12] to display what is in him.
[1:56:15] His attribute of savior
[1:56:18] something had to be lost.
[1:56:22] And the very thing that man fail and
[1:56:24] become lost, he become the savior of
[1:56:25] that
[1:56:29] taking his own law. And he could not do
[1:56:32] it as the great Jehovah that covered all
[1:56:34] space and time.
[1:56:39] He had to become a man and he took
[1:56:43] kinship with a man that was lost.
[1:56:49] He became kinship. Uganda.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. And became a man.
[1:56:58] God made flesh.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my something inside brother
[1:57:06] says God became
[1:57:10] from God.
[1:57:14] God became
[1:57:16] from God to become me.
[1:57:20] to take my sin upon him
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; that he might make me him.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Okay, are you listening now? Ask your
[1:57:33] neighbor, are you listening? Listen. God
[1:57:35] became from God
[1:57:38] to become me to take my sin upon him
[1:57:44] that he might make me him.
[1:57:49] Amen.
[1:57:51] Back to his great purpose
[1:57:56] of sons and daughters of God.
[1:58:01] Amen. That attribute was in him.
[1:58:04] It had to be displayed.
[1:58:06] God became

[1:58:32] it's a revelation.
[1:58:35] It's an eternal. It's as eternal as
[1:58:37] God's word is eternal.
[1:58:42] But a three-fold purpose of God is great
[1:58:43] mystery.
[1:58:48] This is an announcement.
[1:58:52] The three-fold purpose
[1:58:58] of this God is great mystery
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:05] is revealed.
[1:59:10] Who is announcing this?
[1:59:14] The prophet of Malachi 4,
[1:59:19] the prophet of Revelation 10:7
[1:59:23] because when it sounds the mystery will
[1:59:26] be finished.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And now he says it is revealed.
[1:59:32] God manifested in Christ.
[1:59:35] Christ manifested in the church
[1:59:38] in order
[1:59:40] to redeem the lost Eve back to the
[1:59:42] original condition in the Garden of
[1:59:43] Eden.
