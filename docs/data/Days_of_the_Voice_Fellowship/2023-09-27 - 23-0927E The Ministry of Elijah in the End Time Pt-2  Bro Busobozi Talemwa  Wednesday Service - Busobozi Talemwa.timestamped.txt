[40:08] amen hallelujah
[40:15] Bibles
[40:17] because
[40:20] I'm going to be speaking part two of
[40:22] what I spoke on on Sunday yeah
[40:25] [Music]
[40:28] and I'm also ministering to the Saints
[40:32] in evening like uh
[40:40] Circle
[40:42] so
[40:44] for their service this evening on Zoom
[40:47] services
[40:50] so I'll greet them in a moment
[40:52] um
[40:57] praise the Lord
[40:58] are you happy to be in the house of the
[41:01] Lord
[41:03] amen Amina
[41:06] David said I was happy when they said
[41:08] unto me let's go to the house of the
[41:09] Lord
[41:14] so
[41:19] tonight we are reading once again from
[41:23] Malachi chapter 4 verse 5.
[41:26] [Music]
[41:36] and then
[41:38] we will read other scriptures later on
[41:44] behold I will send you Elijah the
[41:46] prophet before the coming of the Great
[41:48] and the Dreadful day of the Lord
[42:00] [Music]
[42:03] so I send out greetings uh to evening
[42:08] light by Tabernacle um
[42:14] asked me to speak to the Saints on Zoom
[42:16] so the Saints are streaming this on Zoom
[42:19] I send you our regards
[42:25] in the name of Jesus Christ
[42:27] so we are speaking on the ministry of
[42:30] Elijah in the end times
[42:35] there is a lot to speak on this subject
[42:40] So within one hour you can imagine that
[42:44] uh I I would just be hinting on a few
[42:47] things here and there
[42:51] sometimes I have quotes to read and then
[42:54] I end up not reading them
[42:58] but we just asked that the Holy Spirit
[43:01] to lead us tonight
[43:05] we have received an Elijah Ministry
[43:09] in our time
[43:11] and this ministry has turned our hearts
[43:15] back to the Faith of Our Fathers and
[43:21] um
[43:22] but you notice that Elijah
[43:25] did not just oh will is not just coming
[43:28] in the end time
[43:31] the ministry of Elijah has really been
[43:34] there even before our time
[43:40] the ministry of Elijah has been in the
[43:43] in the Old Testament
[43:46] again and it was prophesied to come
[43:50] again in the end times
[43:54] the prophecy which I read here in the
[43:57] Book of Malachi chapter 4
[44:00] is just a prophecy after the ministry of
[44:04] Elijah's existed twice
[44:07] [Music]
[44:11] because the first Ministry of Elijah is
[44:14] seen in the man himself Elijah
[44:20] and that was we will be able to look at
[44:23] it briefly today
[44:26] in the book of First Kings 18 shortly we
[44:28] shall read there
[44:31] but we also see that when Elijah left
[44:36] again that his ministry continued
[44:40] with another man called Elisha
[44:44] the anointing that was on the ministry
[44:47] of Elijah or the anointing which was
[44:50] upon Elijah
[44:53] came back in a double portion upon
[44:56] Elisha
[44:59] and Elisha's Ministry if you read your
[45:02] Bible you will find it has many
[45:04] similarities with the ministry of Elijah
[45:09] is
[45:12] because the ministry of Elisha was the
[45:15] continuation of the ministry of Elijah
[45:20] so now now after Elisha after Elijah and
[45:25] after Elisha
[45:28] now God through another Prophet Malachi
[45:33] she gives a prophecy he says behold I'll
[45:38] send you a lady the prophet before the
[45:40] coming of the Great and the Dreadful day
[45:41] of the Lord
[45:46] so in other words the ministry of Elijah
[45:51] is in continuity here oh where is
[45:54] now you have to understand that the man
[45:57] Elijah Was Won
[46:01] and he did not die
[46:04] he went to heaven alive again and you
[46:08] know but his spirit
[46:11] let me put it this way the spirit of God
[46:14] which was working upon Him
[46:18] continued working yes
[46:21] if you see if you you start the prophets
[46:25] you can study Daniel you can study
[46:28] Isaiah you can study you know Ezekiel
[46:30] and many other prophets
[46:33] you will notice that their Ministry was
[46:36] a bit varying
[46:39] ways
[46:41] for example the ministry of uh of Moses
[46:47] was that kind that would turn water into
[46:50] blood
[46:51] [Music]
[46:54] you know it was sent to force
[47:16] from all the other prophets
[47:20] we find you know
[47:22] love they wanted to use the ministry
[47:24] again
[47:28] he uses it for a walk of restoration
[47:33] so I want us to look at First Kings 18.
[47:38] and we will begin from verse 19.
[47:43] praise the Lord
[47:52] now there are quite very many verses but
[47:55] uh
[47:57] we will try and see how much we can read
[48:00] for you
[48:04] now there are for send and gather to me
[48:06] all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the
[48:08] prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of
[48:11] the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's
[48:14] table
[48:15] so I have sent unto all the children of
[48:17] Israel and gathered the prophets
[48:19] together and to Mount Carmel
[48:22] we are reading from verse 19 chapter 18.
[48:30] um
[48:50] and Elijah came unto uh
[48:54] better please and Elijah came unto all
[48:57] the people and said how long hold ye
[48:59] between two opinions if the Lord be God
[49:02] follow him but if Baal then follow him
[49:05] and the people answered him not a word
[49:07] then said Elijah unto the people I even
[49:10] I only remain a prophet of the Lord but
[49:13] bal's prophets are 450 men
[49:26] um
[49:42] let them better forgive us two blocks
[49:45] and let them choose one block for
[49:47] themselves and cut in pieces and lay it
[49:49] on the wood and put no fire under and I
[49:51] will dress the other Bullock and lay it
[49:53] on wood and put no fire under and call
[49:56] ye on the name of your gods and I will
[49:57] call on the name of the Lord and the god
[49:59] that hazareth by fire let him be God and
[50:02] all the people answered and said it is
[50:03] well spoken calling me
[50:06] cut it but way into Billy bear was
[50:10] interim
[50:12] vegetables
[50:37] and Elijah said unto the prophets of
[50:40] Baal choose you uh one block for
[50:43] yourselves and dress it first for year
[50:46] for ye and many and call on the name of
[50:48] your Gods put no fire under and they
[50:51] took the Bullock which was given them
[50:53] and they dressed it and called on the
[50:55] name of Baal from morning even until
[50:58] noon saying oh Baal hear us but there
[51:01] was no voice no any that sound answered
[51:04] and they leaped upon the altar which was
[51:06] made and it came to pass at noon that
[51:08] Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud
[51:11] for he is a God either he's stalking or
[51:13] he's pursuing or he's in a journey open
[51:16] Adventure he's sleepeth and and must be
[51:18] awake
[51:19] foreign
[51:20] [Music]
[51:29] [Music]
[51:40] [Music]
[52:01] [Music]
[52:09] and they cried aloud and cut themselves
[52:12] after their manner with knives and
[52:14] license till the blood gushed out upon
[52:17] them and it came to pass when they when
[52:19] the when midday was passed and they
[52:21] prophesied until the time of the
[52:23] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[52:25] there was neither voice nor any to
[52:27] answer no any that regarded
[52:29] foreign
[52:51] [Music]
[52:54] praise the name of the Lord now Saints I
[52:57] want you to uh uh to to follow me
[52:59] closely here
[53:02] sometimes you think that these things
[53:04] we've gone through it many times and you
[53:06] know you already know them
[53:09] but I know that it's the word of God is
[53:12] always
[53:16] closely so that you can be able to
[53:18] understand
[53:21] you see this sounds like a very good
[53:24] story
[53:26] foreign
[53:37] [Music]
[53:54] this was a time when Israel had
[53:56] backslidden
[53:58] Elijah came at the time when Israel was
[54:01] back Sweden
[54:03] and the glory of God had departed from
[54:06] Israel
[54:08] so King I have married from the among
[54:11] the heathens
[54:14] in shortly we are going to look at that
[54:17] mall
[54:19] but now you know Jezebel started
[54:22] fighting against
[54:25] fighting against Elijah
[54:29] and maybe I'm thinking for a little more
[54:33] Foundation I should give you a little
[54:34] more scriptures here for you to look at
[54:36] um
[54:40] uh I've not finished the reading in uh
[54:43] First Kings 18 Simmons similarities
[54:47] but if I don't go back please you could
[54:49] note it down and then read it later
[54:51] never said to you one day
[55:07] and it came to pass as if it had been a
[55:11] light thing for him to walk in the sins
[55:13] of Jehovah I'm the son of neighborhood
[55:15] that it took to wife Jezebel the
[55:17] daughter of ethbal King of the
[55:19] disadonians and went and served Baal and
[55:22] worshiped him
[55:23] foreign
[55:58] [Music]
[56:23] thing if you work in it anymore
[56:28] and you know we can know that by seeing
[56:31] the church the the church natural
[56:36] Israel is the church
[56:39] and we've seen that Israel God dealt
[56:41] with Israel as a as a nation as a group
[56:47] deals with uh with uh with the Gentiles
[56:50] as individuals
[56:54] everything that happens to Israel as a
[56:56] church as a nation
[57:00] it happens to us Gentiles as individuals
[57:05] while I look at Israel as a nation
[57:09] I wanted to examine your own personal
[57:12] life as an individual
[57:15] so now everything begins with
[57:19] before God sends Elijah
[57:22] things be
[57:25] you know the Bible says
[57:28] you know he had seen it as a light thing
[57:31] as a simple thing
[57:33] [Music]
[57:35] you walk in the sins of the son of deep
[57:38] of neighbors
[57:41] but now before we look at jeroboam
[57:45] I want you to look at them but before
[57:49] you look at him I want you to look at
[57:52] Solomon
[57:53] before we look at Solomon I wanted to
[57:56] look at David
[57:57] the whole thing begins
[58:00] David the Bible says he was a man after
[58:02] God his own heart
[58:04] [Music]
[58:05] whatever God said David said amen I
[58:09] believe it
[58:11] David walked in the will of God
[58:15] indeed what God desires
[58:17] yes David was not a perfect man
[58:21] just like every individual even you who
[58:25] is listening to me today you are not a
[58:28] perfect man foreign
[58:50] [Music]
[59:02] [Music]
[59:09] [Music]
[59:39] you know God told David well you know I
[59:42] love you but you have too much blood on
[59:44] your hands I won't allow you to build a
[59:46] temple foreign
[59:54] [Music]
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:35] amen oh fathers how many fathers do we
[1:00:38] have all you fathers all your fathers on
[1:00:42] Zoom today amen all of you hearing me
[1:00:45] for your father
[1:00:47] if you have children
[1:00:50] claim every one of them
[1:00:53] and you put them under the turkey
[1:00:56] none of them can be lost
[1:00:59] if you believe that with all your heart
[1:01:02] amen because the promise of God
[1:01:05] is unto you with your children
[1:01:11] that's the promise of God
[1:01:14] that happens also among the Gentiles
[1:01:18] if it happened to the to the Jews
[1:01:21] and so then Solomon built a temple
[1:01:26] but you see along the way
[1:01:29] Solomon
[1:01:44] most of these women he married them
[1:01:46] because of political alliances
[1:01:52] and he thought that he will it will help
[1:01:56] him to be a strong King
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:00] if God has called you
[1:02:03] he has anointed you to be what you are
[1:02:07] you do not need to go into any alliance
[1:02:10] with anybody
[1:02:12] you can accomplish the purpose of God
[1:02:15] for your life without any Alliance
[1:02:20] and many times these alliances
[1:02:23] trouble with God
[1:02:25] praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:28] is here that then so
[1:02:31] when he grew old his women they started
[1:02:36] to you know bring him closer to the to
[1:02:38] their God
[1:02:40] and they started building artists
[1:02:43] the same man who built the altar of the
[1:02:46] Lord
[1:02:47] began to build the altars of this other
[1:02:51] God because
[1:02:57] of that you know he came down when
[1:03:02] Solomon was about to die he comes down
[1:03:05] to it to one of the prophets
[1:03:07] and he told him I'd like you to go and
[1:03:12] prophesy not to the son of the of the
[1:03:15] Kings
[1:03:16] but to one of the servants
[1:03:20] prophesy to him and say
[1:03:23] praise God
[1:03:25] that God is going to reap the kingdom
[1:03:28] into two the cartoon
[1:03:30] and he's going to give you ten tribes
[1:03:37] and he will he will remain in Jerusalem
[1:03:42] because
[1:03:44] of my servant David
[1:03:47] the city of God could not be taken away
[1:03:49] from Death from the lineage of David
[1:03:54] because of David not because of Solomon
[1:04:01] the way you serve God can end up
[1:04:04] blessing your children
[1:04:08] there are certain things you are
[1:04:10] fighting
[1:04:11] am I preaching to someone here there's
[1:04:14] certain things you're fighting in your
[1:04:16] life
[1:04:17] listen listen those things that we are
[1:04:20] fighting
[1:04:21] if you don't overcome them it will be
[1:04:25] passed down to your children
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:07] it must die with me
[1:05:11] but the problem here
[1:05:14] Solomon Suleiman received and he reaped
[1:05:17] the blessings of his father
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:21] but he was not able to keep them
[1:05:25] he went and served other gods
[1:05:28] and when that happened God was not happy
[1:05:32] with him he said I'm going to take the
[1:05:35] kingdom
[1:05:36] and I will give the biggest part
[1:05:39] to the servant of Solomon
[1:05:42] so that he can rule as he wishes
[1:05:48] God is God that's what he desires
[1:05:54] listen
[1:05:56] so now
[1:05:58] um if you can go with me to the book of
[1:06:00] First Kings chapter 11.
[1:06:04] let us see this prophecy
[1:06:07] quickly now
[1:06:09] verses 29.
[1:06:11] and it came to pass at that time when
[1:06:14] went out to Jerusalem that the prophet
[1:06:17] ahija the children found him in the way
[1:06:19] and he had cried himself with a new
[1:06:21] gamut and they too were alone in the
[1:06:23] field and I he just called the new
[1:06:26] garment that wasn't him and he rent it
[1:06:28] in 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam
[1:06:32] take the ten that were the pieces for
[1:06:36] thus say the Lord for God the god of
[1:06:38] Israel behold I I will reign the kingdom
[1:06:41] out of the hand of Solomon and I will
[1:06:43] give you ten tribes but he but he shall
[1:06:48] have one tribe for my servant David is
[1:06:50] sick and for Jerusalem's sake the city
[1:06:53] which I have chosen out of all the
[1:06:54] tribes of Israel because that they have
[1:06:57] forsaken me and I have worshiped and
[1:06:59] have worshiped asterisk and the goddess
[1:07:02] of the zidonians
[1:07:04] the god of the moabites and Miracle the
[1:07:07] god of the children of Ammon and have
[1:07:10] not worked in my ways to do that which
[1:07:13] is in right in my eyes
[1:07:15] and to keep my status and my judgments
[1:07:18] as did David his father how bait I will
[1:07:21] not take the whole Kingdom out of his
[1:07:23] hand and I will make him Prince all the
[1:07:25] days of his life for David my servant is
[1:07:27] sick whom I chose because he kept my
[1:07:30] Commandments and my statutes but I will
[1:07:33] take the kingdom out of his son his hand
[1:07:35] and I will give it unto thee even ten
[1:07:38] tribes and unto his son will I give one
[1:07:41] tribe that David my servant may have a
[1:07:45] light always before me in Jerusalem the
[1:07:48] city which I have chosen to me to put my
[1:07:50] name there I will take thee and thou
[1:07:53] shalt Reign according to all that thy
[1:07:56] soul desireth and shall be king over
[1:07:58] Israel and it shall be if thou Wilt how
[1:08:01] can unto listen listen to this part now
[1:08:03] and it shall be
[1:08:05] verse 38 and it shall be if thou Wilt
[1:08:08] hecken unto all that I command thee and
[1:08:12] he will walk in my ways and do that
[1:08:15] which is written my sight to keep my
[1:08:17] statues and my Commandments as David my
[1:08:20] servant did that I will be with you and
[1:08:22] build the assure house
[1:08:25] as a build for David and I will give
[1:08:27] Israel unto you oh my God
[1:08:30] and praise God I wanted to hear this you
[1:08:33] know this is a powerful promise
[1:08:36] you know God was you know
[1:08:38] if there is something that God loves
[1:08:42] someone who will stay with the world
[1:08:46] someone who who
[1:08:49] the ability to stand with the world
[1:08:53] in the face of anything
[1:08:56] in the face of every Temptations
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:16] It's a holy city but you see because of
[1:09:20] Solomon now Solomon carries the the
[1:09:23] legacy of his father
[1:09:25] because he went to other gods
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:29] God was not happy with him
[1:09:32] now send Prophet ahija
[1:09:35] to go and prophesy to a servant called
[1:09:39] Jeremiah
[1:09:43] was only a servant
[1:09:46] someone who did not even have any claim
[1:09:49] on on royalty
[1:09:52] someone would never dreamed of being a
[1:09:55] king
[1:09:57] someone who never thought you will never
[1:09:59] be anything
[1:10:01] that is the same way God blesses the
[1:10:04] Gentiles
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:09] God keeps you an Everlasting Covenant
[1:10:14] we have a big promise here
[1:10:17] it can be accomplished
[1:10:20] it will be accomplished
[1:10:25] there is a condition
[1:10:28] God gives a condition
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:32] he says yes you know he had a new
[1:10:35] government yeah
[1:10:44] and it begins taking your new suit and
[1:10:48] cutting it into 10 pieces
[1:10:51] some of you can box him
[1:10:55] but
[1:11:00] as long as it is
[1:11:04] praise God come here that's why people
[1:11:06] don't believe in the way the Holy Spirit
[1:11:08] acts when it comes
[1:11:11] because people shout and dance
[1:11:15] they feel offended the holy spirit is
[1:11:18] not emotion
[1:11:20] but the holy spirit is emotional
[1:11:23] whenever he moves on somebody
[1:11:26] who does things in an emotional way
[1:12:28] you see
[1:12:30] but
[1:12:32] for for Solomon they addressed Suleiman
[1:12:36] One Tribe will be given him again the
[1:12:39] way which catch him and he will remain
[1:12:42] with a City
[1:12:43] Jerusalem
[1:12:45] because that one was chosen
[1:12:49] city of God
[1:12:52] and because of David my servant
[1:12:57] it will remain in his language
[1:13:00] I want to say this God does not remember
[1:13:03] does not forget
[1:13:06] God always remembers
[1:13:08] every promise he makes
[1:13:11] when he made a promise to David
[1:13:15] he did not forget it has God given you
[1:13:18] any promise
[1:13:23] he cannot forget the promises
[1:13:27] Hallelujah that he has met to his
[1:13:30] beloved
[1:13:36] I'll give One Tribe to him because
[1:13:41] uh I I am because of David myself
[1:13:48] so God remembers the son of solomona not
[1:13:52] because of Solomon but because of David
[1:13:57] God will remember your children's
[1:14:00] children because of you
[1:14:03] if the Lord Jesus
[1:14:06] the decisions
[1:14:11] God will remember your children his
[1:14:13] children
[1:14:16] because of you
[1:14:21] know because of your stance
[1:14:24] because of your good decisions
[1:14:27] we remember the generations
[1:14:33] that's a powerful prophecy
[1:14:36] praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:39] Hallelujah
[1:14:41] and it says and it shall be
[1:14:45] yeah
[1:14:47] and then he says here and I will thank
[1:14:50] you
[1:14:52] and you will reign and forget according
[1:14:58] to all that your soul desires
[1:15:04] and you will be king over
[1:15:08] Israeli when you are given a promise you
