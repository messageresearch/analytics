the Book of John chapter 4 vers 7 [Music] amen amen [Music] is that verse 7 yes John chapter 4 and verse 7 okay uh maybe we can read together there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat then sayith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asks drink of me which I am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans Jesus answered and said unto her if thou know if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water the woman said unto unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the whale and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle Jesus answered and said unto unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hether [Music] Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that sayest thou truly the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ow to worship Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh suchar to worship Him and Jesus continued to say God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth the woman said unto him I know that the Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he took he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why took thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and said to the man come see a man which told me all things that I have ever did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him amen you may be seated so this evening by God's grace I want to speak uh on the presence of God um it's not going to really be preaching as such I'm not dressed like a preacher tonight I'm just going to be uh you know sharing with you a few thoughts on the presence of God this thought came to me last night as we were in the family Altar and so uh I tried to stay away from it but you know I just felt that I should share something on this tonight with you amen uh so just a few words and then we'll go into prayer so when we talk about the presence of God um Everybody many people have different definitions for and by the way we are happy to have sister doas amen you're you're welcome it's been a long time looks like you had forgotten home yeah but we are happy that she's here tonight amen and to see all all of you who have made it in in this Friday night service I know this Friday night service is usually for those who in luga we say saying it is for those who can break through yeah it's by the grace of God and uh we have come because we need to be in his presence we have come because we are a needy people and we there is nothing like being in his presence you know if you are given an opportunity to be in a in the if uh to be in the presence of somebody great how will you feel to each of you you have your great people to some of you maybe it is the president to others it is your king where you come from to others it is your role model or someone that you've been following and then you feel that if that person came and shook your hand that would make your day it would make you a week maybe it would make you year because you have been in the presence of your idol you understand so now uh I believe there have been many Great Men on on the in the world many Rich many powerful uh many who have great names uh many who have made a very big things the world change the world and um you know when people at one time when people came in their presence they felt so special one of those men was Solomon and there was a woman all the way from Ethiopia called the queen of shba and the queen of shba heard of the wisdom of Solomon and the Bible says she traveled all the way from the land of shba I don't know how of course at that time they were traveling on Horseback there were no cars there was uh no uh you know airports and airplanes so she must have gone on Horseback or maybe even on uh uh you know those I believe they had horses yes chariots yeah and so she traveled from the of shba all the way to um to Israel and she was able to meet um Solomon and to to talk with him only to talk with him but you see when you go before a great man there's a day here I shared on um uh I shared on hor being you know when you give honor I said when you give honor you get access how many remember that those of you who missed it I'm sure it will do you good sowing honor and harvesting access and I told you that you know our generation most people do not honor others anymore you you find that we don't honor each other and um you find that older ones don't honor younger ones younger ones don't hon older ones but do you know that each of us has a different Grace that God has placed upon our lives and if you can be able to honor each other you realize that you you will you will have access to Greatness if you know if you want to understand what I'm talking about you look at all the great people today world you will see that they honor there's a certain person or certain people that they honor so much and that was able to give them access to a certain Grace or a certain anointing or or you know man upon their life so then there was this woman called the queen of shba so when she went before Solon she did not go empty-handed she was also a queen so she was a great woman in I believe she was a queen of most of the parts of Africa but when she traveled to Solomon she went with a lot of gold she went with a lot of silver she went with a lot of you know clothing and a lot of things the treasures of her country and and um you know and then she took it to King Solomon when King Solomon saw all these things his heart melted and he was happy and this woman got access to to him it is believed that the book of Song of Solomon was written you know speaking of Solomon and this queen of shba we know that the book of Song of Solomon is a type it is speaking of Christ and the bride I think one day I I'll take some time and preach out of it it's a very wonderful book so you can see that Solomon got favor before this uh uh I mean queen the Queen of Sheba God favor before Solomon when she reached his presence she didn't come empty-handed she came with gifts she came with praises she came with you know whatever you can think of had a lot of servants she had a lot of things I mean she didn't come alone so for her to get access to the king and to be able to test or to hear or be in the presence of his wisdom she had to come with all these things she had to Hon him you know as as you know uh uh people you know honor others even here imagine if you are some of you older sisters if a younger sister just looked at you and greeted you as if she was greeting a child and then just gives you your hand God bless your sister you can truly say that this sister does not have honor for me and your heart will be closed to her but if she comes to you with respect and reverence depending on the circumstances you know she may bow a b or or you know or or kneel or or you know um just bow a little bit and give you a hand you feel that you are honored even if your son wanted to marry that sister you will tell him you can go ahead she's a good sister but if she's not she's the kind that does not honor in your presence you can never support her because you you will say no no that's very wrong character and you find other sisters when they honor them or brothers they they they also feel like kings yes yeah yeah but I believe we should honor one another I saw one sister that was saying that if a younger sister comes to greet her honoring her you know trying to kneel down or you know some cultures they just bend a little bit like this so you will find that when this one does it like this the other will also do it and their knees will you know just comes and you know and their knees will me you know to show that you are honoring me but I'm also honoring you I believe we should always honor each other there is access in honor when you are in the presence of someone and you honor them there is access that you receive to certain things that you never had before today I'm not talking about hor I'm talking about the presence so this woman came and honored the king but there is no way you can talk about the presence without talking about the horor so when the king when the queen came before the king she honored the king and you know they had some very wonderful time together and then she left back to go to to her country and when she was leaving the king also honored her and gave her many many beautiful gifts praise the name of the Lord but in the presence of the king she went away a changed woman amen now today I want us to talk about another king one that is greater than Solomon our Lord Jesus Christ there is something about the presence of God I told you today I just want us to discuss a few things there is something about the presence of God that we as Believers and as a church we do not need to get used to the presence of God is where things happen happen is where healing takes place is where Deliverance happens you hear people call their churches deliverance churchur and you know for them they say they believe in Deliverance but you know FR message Believers we don't we don't do it like that why because every Serv service is a Deliverance service but our deliverance happens under under the word in the presence of God without that presence you cannot even talk about deliver not there it is in that presence you may have a burden and that burden will be lifted in that Pres you may you may have a problem even sometimes for years and when you enter that presence that burden will just leave you maybe it may be a big problem but you see the qu the problem that we have many Believers don't enter that presence you know when God comes down after or during the preaching of the word you find that there are some other people who are very dry they don't even know what is taking place they're looking around they're not understanding what is happening look at this one is falling look at this one is crying this I can never cry like this someone once told me you know Pastor the word was so hot the other day I almost shouted another said the word was so good I almost cried I just had to get out so I don't cry before the people I I looked I said poor this one you don't understand there is something about the presence of God actually we in the message many people in this message we do not appreciate the presence of God enough that's a bad thing because you see we have educated ourselves with all the doctrines with all the good teachings we know how we should dress we know how we should talk we know what we should do and what we should not do but when you talk about the presence it's not there be it in our family altars be it in the churches we are very you find someone even younger people you know we are singing but they are very dry you find them looking around it used to be that new people who came in the church new Believers that they are the ones when you know people are singing or worshiping they don't know what is happening so they know they did not all they knew is something out out there they do not know how to behave themselves in the presence they they did not know how to yield to the presence so when he comes they don't know how to behave so they begin looking around whenever you see someone like that is either new or he does not know anything about the Holy Spirit and then that kind of person will come in and go out the way I feel I will not even exhaust this today there is much I want to talk about the presence did you know brother Enoch a preacher can preach for 1 hour or two hours and you get nothing but in that presence everything you needed all the questions you have would be finished in that presence there is something about the presence of God you know when you are in before the presence of a great man you come with expectation you come believing something is going to happen I want you to think about it if the president called you to the state house do you think you're just going to go and walk away if Sister PE the president sent you an invitation to begin with you won't believe is it is this m and then after you have believed it is yours then you are going to begin the excitement first then you going to show it to your friends some of you may not even show it to anyone because you don't know someone may do something which will hinder you from going you really want to go and you are under expectation you believe something good you don't even know what but you believe something good is going to come out something good is going to happen because you're going before the presence of the president but this is only a man who is going to die just like the rest of us and you find people bragging and boasting because they close to the president or because they close to the king or because they close to so and so and but for us we have a king amen who is the king over all the kings of the world and we have his audience his word tells us amen he can hear us anytime we want to call on him he says ask ask and he shall receive amen knock and it shall be open for for you so in other words he says I'm always available whenever you want me just come and access me freely and in the presence of God things always happen and by the way whenever you are maybe in church and you feel like shouting you shout it's not just a feeling it is honoring the presence of God when you feel like Clapping Your Hands you do it when you feel like running around you feel like crying or kneeling down don't even care about your neighbor why because whatever you feel like doing it is revealed to you and when you do it it is your way of honoring him it's your way of honoring him you know when you see a great man coming you automatically feel like kneeling down oh you're welcome you know depending on your culture you see of course there some cultures I've told you here before that don't kneel down and there other cultures that KN and other cultures Bend but I want to tell you every culture has a way they honor every culture has a way of others just bend a little bit others kneel down others lie down you know and others I mean there are many ways of Hing and so even worship is a honor when you are worshiping God you recognize his presence immediately do whatever he tells you to do do whatever I mean you should be soft in your heart don't Harden your heart in the presence of the king you know if it's to shout or cry out I mean go ahead and do it you know if you have a gift or something or speaking in tongues or giving a prophecy these kind of things as long as it is given in order go ahead and do it it used to be that in the message churches we now feared even those things you know talk about Tong T are for Pentecostal Tong are from Pentecostal they say but I want to show you something here in The Book of Mark in The Book of Mark chapter 16s 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damed and these what signs are you following me and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils amen you believe that Amen in my name they shall speak with what it's right there they shall speak with everybody repeat that they shall speak with new tongues do we believe that we believe in speaking in tongues actually this is a sign of those that believe not not the nonbelievers he said shall follow the Believers the unbelievers seek after those signs but the Believers don't seek them the Believers are followed by these signs so in other words if we are believers those signs will be in abundance in our mid it is not a shock it is not a surprise as a matter of fact it is a surprise shock if we don't have those signs in our Med if we don't if we can't cast out demons and if we can't speak in new tongues and if we can't interpret these tongues and if we can't see the gifts of healing and the gift you know all these things if you can't see it in a minut then there's a problem with our faith there is a problem with our belief it means our God is dead and we are not in his presence but to all those who are in his presence this things happen friends hallelujah amen it can be one song that will Propel you into that presence you know I told you this thought came to me last night I was shocked friends I was shocked I mean I was very tired and we had um you know a very late family alar I think about 10 or you know 10: p.m. yeah so we usually have family alter 8:30 we should have it around that time but this week will been a bit you know later on and so uh yesterday we had it around 10 p.m. and so you know the some children were even already you know sleeping and and so we prayed and shared the scripture and S and you know and so they went to bed and and so before the big ones of us were like about I don't remember how many maybe seven or five I don't know I have a big family I don't remember how many and so we were just there worshiping and we sang song after song and after song and planned but as we began honoring him as we began honoring God after one song and we had one playing the piano and another one the guitar and we just worshiping and honoring him and honoring him and honoring him and there something happened to me that actually I've seen the presence of God happen many times many times you can feel that his presence is about to come but that one happened without me expecting it I honored him and sang from my heart and sang from my heart and he was with all of my heart all of the sudden something just came over me called it like a spell and I couldn't stop it started you know um like the prophet would saying and you know just crying out and uncontrollably and these brothers who were playing and singing and they just continued on and it looked like everybody was glued to that and by let me ask you a question what do you call that you call it excitement I call it the presence of God you know when you honor him whenever those moments happen and you honor him yield yourself yield yourself just do it with all your heart and you may even be having a problem that moment when you honor him in that presence the prophet says in that SP of a moment I would just find that quote and read it for you also I told you I'm just discussing this with you tonight praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the the prophet would you know talk about the SP of a moment and each of us need these friends I just pray that the Lord will would give it to us whenever we are in his presence praise the name of the Lord I just pray I get the court that I'm looking for quickly praise the Lord I think it's a wonderful quote that I have to read for you all I'm just searching out for the quot I did not plan to read it for you [Music] today brother bam would talk about um when you know just like a moment that happens yeah I think I got it in the message works is Faith expressed listen to what it says he says I want to tell you something now work on that pulsation thank you for interpreting it that way how many have ever felt that you've ever felt that in the presence of God he says work on it that Spar of A Moment Like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it grab meaning it may just leave many times when brother bam is in a prayer line someone would you know he would say I see someone in the congregation or and you know I see the the pill of fire over somebody El and he would say please don't miss it please don't miss it oh he's about to miss oh she's about to miss you would see the move of the spirit the pulling or the rejection of it and then he would say oh she's missed it and then someone would get it how does that happen it is the whole thing is in this quot just that moment when something is revealed to you grab it now when he says when he can come to you as a pulation he says your healing is now God Is providing for you your jump up and shout jump up and raise your hand and then you be like ah no how will I be and then that that that thing leaves you and you see it keeps happening to Believers it keeps happening to Believers and that is very sad and you come to the whole service and nothing happen because when something was happening you rejected it you push it away he says that when that just moment when something is revealed to you grab it you know what is grabbing it you know not just catching it but grabbing it hold it to it that Spar of moment work on that pulsation sometimes it's not even the whole service for you is just maybe the preacher may speak something that will resonate with you or something that and then you should just catch it praise the name of the Lord there is something about the presence of God good friends I've seen people there was a girl um that came in one of our services and she had a spirit on her she kept on falling and falling and falling and um you know they took her to a lot of people they took her to which doctors even it never worked they took her to [Music] pastors they would pray for her the thing goes and then comes back again and so she she kept on would just be there and then Falls passes out and then she begins shaking and Shing you know people you've seen people who are like [Music] that and so she just came in the service a nonbeliever and when the word was going on as the word was going before even the word finished as the word was going on something she had something and she received it she grabbed it she shouted and received it and before you knew it again she had just passed out and she fail the same way she always fall but that falling was different she receiv her Deliverance right in that service she never from that moment until today she never have never had that she ever fail again that's SP of a moment that's why you shouldn't be shocked when you see people falling in a service sometimes it is someone receiving the Holy Ghost sometimes is someone being delivered of something sometimes it is just someone you know walking into their Victory because we believe in being slain in the Holy Spirit you know it is possible do you believe that well we believe it because we have seen it and we continue to believe it you see the presence of God changes everything about what you planned or what you thought amen when God comes down everything is rearranged oh my you remember I don't want to preach but oh my this is just burning me right now you remember when Moses came down the children of Israel said Moses you are the only one that speaks to him but we also want to see him and we want to speak to him God told Moses is it what they said it is all right I will come to them but before I come come to them I want you to prepare them tell them to be clean clean up wash everything those of you who are shabby and dirty and unclean the Holy Spirit cannot come in your room the presence of God forget about it I'm just preaching to you tonight especially you younger men if you don't want to shower I don't want to wash your clothes don't want to clean your room or your house and when someone enters there what's happening the presence of God can't come there God told them tell them to clean up wash everything clean everything and then on the last day here was what is going to happen he said I will come around the end of that mountain and and you know um you know everybody will just come near and you know what happened those people could not comprehend that presence they could not comprehend they could not they told Moses please Moses tell him to go our away please tell him to go away we are going to die for our life tell him to go away you talk to him and give us the report but we don't want to die praise the name of the Lord that's why there are Realms of the presence of God we may never walk into people like brother have walked into them are you hearing me there are certain RS of presence that we may not be able to walk into but even what what we he allows us access it is so holy it is so wonderful that in that presence nothing can fail hallelujah amen I remember vividly one day I was in Western Kenya some years ago and I had one of the brothers who was assisting me who is now the pastor there in Ethiopia and um he was going to have his wedding and you know he didn't have enough money for his wedding and he one of the first Believers and it was a bden a burden on my shoulders and I did not know what how to encourage him what to tell him and his family was poor they didn't have money so I was keeping the matter in prayer and one day but uh very early in the morning around 3 34 a.m. I had just slept off as usual we were in meetings there so this was the middle of the night before we go to another meeting in the morning I will never forget that experience you know I had prayed up the whole evening we were in charge and we had a wonderful time in his presence and at that moment you know I I kind of woke up and and then fell into a trans and I saw myself come before the presence of someone now friends I I I know it was Christ oh brother would you know um I don't know what to say but I know it was Jesus Christ because this is what I knew when I was in his presence I looked at him I couldn't see his face but I was seeing it I can't explain it I couldn't see his face but I could see him I I I cannot say that he looked like this or that but I saw him I couldn't I can't explain I'm sorry but the Lord knows I'm saying the and I was as I was standing there before him and I started to tell him what this brother was going through he he he listened to me and heard everything that I was saying and then he took me friend that that that is the most sweet feeling you ever have you know as I talk about it I remember how it felt I started crying uncontrollably I wasn't actually crying but I was just shedding tears and that presence and and then it took me and and and you know put me around his shoulder and um then he started talking and it was as if he was speaking to that brother I remember all the words he spoke to him and he said he said the money that he has is enough I have provided to him enough and say and and then he say said and then then what Chang said he said he called that brother's name and then he began speaking to him words he said you're my son and I love you and the resources I've given to you are just enough for you and the other words he spoke and I was in a trance and when I woke up when I woke up out of this I realized I was just crying physically I couldn't believe it I was crying and there was a great I don't know whether to call it fear or reverence or that atmosphere and I was just crying and crying and I picked up my phone and I started recording those words that I heard and I recorded them and and you know as I cried and later I sent it to the brother and you know what friends that brother did not need any extra coin what he had is what God multiplied and he had a powerful wedding but friends I tell you he told me other things there but what I I said this to say this the presence of God is real our God is real and when he says anything in his word he is always ready to accomplish it and brother bam said if you want angels to appear to you speak about the Lord you know in your daily walk you know in your family in your in your life if you begin to talk about the Lord there is no way angels will not appear to you and we have had many testimonies of people who have had visitations of Angels the other day I was speaking to a sister who told me you know she had an Angelic visitation in her room one of them even took a picture let me tell you friends God is real we just living in this Dimension where we do not have access to the other dimension but that other dimension we can be able to access it if we hit the right door at the right time in the right moment you can literally walk through that door and see what Supernatural eyes can [Applause] see God can literally you know transform your eyes and you can be able to see what others can see amen praise the name of the Lord amen it happened it has been happening to very many you know uh you know not just to brag about it but even my wife when we were in Ethiopia she she met that angel you know as she was in Prayer by the way whenever you hear an angel appeared an angel appeared someone was either in prayer in fasting or in singing but they must have been seeking after that presence the pillar of fire never left this message amen the pillar of fire is still available God is still with us this message is not only you know the words and teachings and doctrines the doctrines are important because they bless us but much more than that we are seeking after his presence let me tell you when you walk into that presence even dark addictions can break it completed something which was so impossible to you but when you walk into that presence it can completely become nothing you've had people who say I was a drunken I was immoral I was doing that I did not know how to overcome it but one day when I was praying something happened to me and then I begin explaining what happened what was that it was the presence of God when his shows up and you receive it that SP of a moment then he begins to activate certain elements in you then he begins to do things what man cannot do then he begins to create your job can you imagine creating a job God can do it it is done in the presence you know things which are possible when you are in that presence things begin to happen he let me tell you when you go in that presence and you are in prayer you are no longer the one praying you begin praying words he places on your mouth and that kind of prayer it is so sweet you even feel like you don't want to stop you feel like you are just you know in another world and many times Amen in your private prayers you can even begin busting in other times and begin praying in tongues you know Apostle Paul actually said that if you can't interpret your tongues pray alone in secret so Apostle Paul believed in praying in times Hallelujah do we believe it exactly we believe it he said in church it should be interpreted because we need to be edified we need to know what you are saying hallelujah but if you're in your private prayers in your prayer closet you can even pray in tones you can even sing in tongues I remember there is a day I sang in Tong for almost 30 minutes 1 hour but I was jumping the whole time as a young child and I was having many Revelations I was having many upliftings don't think I'm going crazy friends this is the presence of God Amen when you walk into that presence you are into another real you are no longer into the realm of debate or trying to understand you are now in the real even of the supernatural where all things are possible where before you prayed for something that never works but when you are in that presence you pray for things and they actually happen What is the difference the difference is in the presence amen he is there to make it work that's why whenever we go and prayer Brethren amen try to enter that presence that's why we see songs that's why we pray you know to do what to enter into that presence this woman at the well she walked into that presence she came from wherever she was coming from she was living in sin amen but when she came in that presence amen when she met Jesus she actually even never knew that the man Jesus was actually God himself and as she walked into his presence you know something that moves me here Jesus sent away all the disciples and he told them go and buy meat imagine telling 12 men to go and buy meat because he was setting himself up to go and give someone his presence he will leave 99 just to give you his presence that's why sometimes you will see someone will receive a spark whereas everybody is not knowing what is happening it is your day of your visitation someone may someone next to you may feel nothing but when you you are swimming in the waters of Revival amen because God has come your way praise the name of the Lord and this woman as she met with Jesus Jesus began to talk to her and you know Jesus told her things about her life she said give me to drink she said I'm a I'm a Samaritan we have no connection with the she said if you knew who was asking you to give me today you would have asked me to give you because the water I will give you when you drink it you can never thirst again you can never thir again I mean what is what what was it trying to say when you come in that presence you drink and you cannot thirst again amen amen if you have thirst for alcohol and you drink the alcohol he gives you you can never thir for another alcohol amen if you had thir for immorality and drink Hallelujah from him you drink from The Well of water you can never search for those things again if you had amen hung and thirst for filthy movies songs amen and then you drink from this well of water friends that dies amen you can never thirst again for the worldly things let me tell you all our young people need to drink from this world of water Hallelujah I had many personally personally I had many thirst I thirsted after many filthy things but I'm here has a testimony one day I drank from this well of water my thirst amen and I've never thirsted for those filthy stuff again my thirst changed and he said if you come and drink from me the water I give you you can never thir again friends is a living water the presence of God that's what it does to you you see someone crying and squeezing themselves and what is happening they are drinking and I God help me I never want to be a spectator whenever the presence of God comes I never want to be a spectator I just immediately close my eyes and I said Lord give me all s to drink ref kill me the woman said unto him sir you don't have anything to draw with and the well is deep how will you give me this living water are you greater than Jacob our father Jesus had answered and said whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never Thirst by the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life amen the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not give it to me when you walk into that presence you are not like I don't care I don't mind you said give it to me give it to me I want to drink give it to to me and the woman asked for it neither he said I don't want to come here to draw I want to drink this and Jesus changed the story he said go call me your husband by the this is what happens in the presence of God he reveals everything those kind of SES when you come to church and the preacher is literally talking about your life how did you know that how did you friends whenever you are in such Services it is the same Jesus just know you are in the presence and behave like this woman behave what did she do she didn't walk away sometimes you feel you see the presence of God coming down and there someone walking out the church almost you want to cist alone and you walk out how can you do that in that presence this woman could not walk away said go fetch me your husband and then Jesus said the woman said I have no husband Jesus said yes sure you said the truth because you've had five and even the one you're living in with right now the is also not yours so in other words you're a prostitute you've been going from one man to another thinking about this woman she must have been looking for something she did not find with the first man she didn't find with the second man she didn't find with the third with the fourth thinking about people who do immorality did you know the imoral Spirits cannot be satisfied cannot you cannot live in immorality with one man or one woman it is impossible why because it is a spirit and you you are seeking you have a thirst you are seeking to satisfy the thir but you see this Spirit lies to you tells you this one will help you and if it doesn't this will help you this help you so you will never find Mr best you'll never find Mr best or Miss best you you find that you are always unsatisfied you find you're always unhappy something is lacking but friends you just walk into that presence one I've seen it happen before to a prostitute I've seen it happen before I've given this story many times how we met her in on one of the streets in Ethiopia and we were just preaching just going going back home and and um then you know she introduced herself to us just called us called on us and myself and the brother that I was with and brother Paul and so she started introducing herself to us long story short turns out she's a prostitute but then we invited her we gave her an invitation reason because we couldn't communicate well with her because of language barrier so we gave an invitation so that she can come at time when we have another interpreter and this woman came and we sat down with her together with brother and this sister who was interpreting and um when she walked into the room she was shocked to find Two Men and and one woman and she was dead fourth I don't know whatever went through her mind but as she so she was like what come come come in and then soon enough she noticed there were open Bibles on the table she noticed she was under attack friends the God of this message is a living God hallelujah he's a living God that's what I witnessed that day and this woman sitting there with all this weird makeup on her she thought she had come to work she did not know she had come to be worked on and and and then right there as we quickly went into the scriptures and then we started preaching to her and we introduced ourselves and started preaching to her the word speaking about Jesus and how Jesus loves her and how Jesus can save her and and what does she say about these things she said I have been a prostitute for 10 years this is the only job I know how to do I I don't think I don't I don't want to deceive Jesus I don't want to do that I I want I I don't want to do that friends I have no power within me to leave this job I told her look it's like as if she had spared of something picked the scripture and they started reading to her not by power nor by might but by my spirit sayth the Lord and as we read that scripture to her something lighted up within her she began realizing there is another power we talking about there is something which can literally overtake her she realized at that moment she was in another presence let me tell you what happened from that moment began crying what made her cry it wasn't anything that we say it was the word designing a heart just like the woman at the world and that woman right there she started crying and crying and crying and then immediately she said I've decided to give my life to Jesus we baptized her that same day and she became a believer in the church Hallelujah one of our church first church members happen to become a converted prostitute let me tell you Jesus is still in the same business today he can change even the worst all it takes is that presence I am showing you it is not a man that does it it is not even you who says I have decided from today I am going to do like this you cannot you will fail again but let me tell you when you walk into that presence amen there is a power that shs you up there is a power that realigns everything in you and changes your mind and changes your desire and changes even the way you were thinking and that's the power of the holy spirit amen this beyond what you've been hearing it is beyond what is written is the power that changes and that happens in the presence and this woman as she was standing there she noticed as this man designed heart that this was somebody else and the Bible says she dropped her water picture oh may God help us to drop our pictures drop your picture you know you have that little picture where you have kept in your little secrets where nobody can get into the place where I've been fetching that filthy water which will make you thirst again yeah in here out every time you fetch every time you fetch but when you never satisfy your thirst your thirst is never quenched maybe you are here tonight amen and you have a thir that is never quenched no matter how much you try but let me tell you my brother my sister I am talking about amen one who knows how to quench the once and for all amen he gives you a water whereby when you take one seep brother you take one seep only before you know it you have no desire for that you have no desire amen for the filthy movies you have no desire for the worldly music you have no desire for immorality you have no desire what happened you took a seep out of that Living Water W glory to God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and then you see what happened here she threw that water picture down H with it it away and said my life no longer needs this I no longer need this that to fill the old stinking water [Music] I have found a soul I have found a SCE whereby I will drink and I will
