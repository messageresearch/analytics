message through our song I may not be a good a singer but I really want you to take these words that have been on my heart I've really been singing this song throughout the week meditating about it so may we sing it together [Music] over and over he Ms me and makes me into his likess if I show that clay a Vel L now I am today all because Jesus he didn't throw that lay away empty and broken I came back to him the soul unworthy so God receive but in all his P he started over again I bless Day He Didn't Throw the Clay Away over and over he moldes me and makes me to his likess if I show th I am today and oh because Jesus he through thear he is the I am the CLE molded is you want me to stand oh when I and my face so he just pies up the P he the thr that way away oh over and [Music] over LS me and makes me into his lik if I sh that place I am today oh because [Music] Jes [Music] that Hallelujah yeah can go straight away to the word Isaiah chapter 64:8 but now oh Lord Thou Art my father art Our Father we are the clay and and the work of thy hands we can also go to Luke chapter 15 verse 10 it says likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth Hallelujah you can have your seats I really want to thank the Lord that has enabled me once again to stand here it is not easy because here we do not speak the words of a man when you try to speak your words you become you you become a failure Hallelujah but just pray for me to deliver the message God has given me our message today will be broken pieces being made whole truly from the beginning we see Adam when God had created Adam he created a righteous man but the devil creped in and lied into Eve and Eve lied the husband and told the husband and the husband had nowhere to escape it because he was the Redeemer of Eva so from that from from the beginning the vessel that go the the person God that created was broken by the devil you may ask yourself what was good when that was happening it may be a question to everyone but God had given man uh that how they call it free moral agents he created man on a free moral agent he gives you everything you decide on what to take he told them when you eat of this you're going to die but man took another way here brother Bram says but while God was Ring after creating man but while he was resting and trusting in his Masterpiece his enemy came in and found this Great Masterpiece and he and he by deceit he creeps under the the the gardens walls and then he M he mad this beautiful Masterpiece and mud it so that it fell God had had trust had trust in his Masterpiece but when he had rested the devil crept in and destroyed the Masterpiece but God is God God remains God he never gave up on his Masterpiece he started over and over it's like now we here we all have our backgrounds everyone has his background even the wrers you see even the people you admire all have the their background we all come from a background I may also be coming from a bad background but God didn't give up on me and he's not giving up on you Hallelujah you just have to keep in his presence keep seeking him keep looking for him it's when you're also going to be a masterpiece that is redeemed Hallelujah we see a lot about him the go the person God created here brother Brenham is telling us he trusted in his Masterpiece but the devil came in and and destroyed the Masterpiece it is the same even right now the devil is always creeping in to destroy the master pce but shame upon the Devil Hallelujah because when Christ died for us at the cross we are redeemed forever he paid he pay the price for it it's like when this great arure this great sculpture that Michelangelo was making that that Monument of Moses he made it but when he was making it the ones that were looking at it have asked themselves what is that man doing what is that man trying to do it they may not even see sense in it but the the one who had the vision he knew what he was creating God has the vision he knows what he creating you don't just coming here just because you have to come or you're not listening or you're not living as a Christian because you have to live as a Christian but God has a purpose to while you're here and we should also listen and hear his word because through it when we are going to perfect what God is trying to mold within us at times situations tend to take us away life situations tend us tend to take us away but when we stick on the line of God's word we shall surely overcome Hallelujah yeah you may you you may be coming from a broken broken background some of you have committed really sins that you can even not H to people but God has saved you God has redeemed you you should not be ashamed of who you are right now even you should not be ashamed of what you were because God changed you and I know you cannot go back to that that state Hallelujah I person I really thank God though some of us were born in the message we grew up in the message we thought maybe that is the way to go but when you're growing the devil is also attacking when you grow the devil attacks and you you start then there you start asking yourself is what I'm having really worth it most people ask themselves that question but I thank God amidst everything that came amidst all that came in my life I really thank God that I still press on that I still know what I'm holding I really thank God for that Hallelujah yeah some of us here even right now you know yourselves you and God know yourselves know what is taking place in your lives it may not be that good but thank God you're here thank God you're still coming to you still holding on that you're still holding on the the truth still holding on his word because he's the only one that will save you he's only God's word that can give life you some of you may have even few minutes back or hours back you might have been doing something bad things but thank God you're here thank God you're here I did not come to I didn't come to encourage Sinners that you can knew because Grace is still more for us but I came to remind you Hallelujah I came to remind you that that Grace yes is still there and God is still saving and don't give up on yourself keep resting on it may not be a one day Journey that you can walk but keep resting on but value that Grace value the the grace you have right now God is trying to bring something in you molding something new in you molding back the other Masterpiece he had because he he is God and he cannot be defeated though the devil came in and destroyed the the the first Masterpiece he had made but God he didn't TR let's see what brother Bram says here I says in the message the masterpiece so God in preparing this masterpiece here he was building a new masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the Patriots and the and the Patriots Foundation First was Abraham and then Isaac and then Jacob and then Joseph the four the four corners and now Abraham was the foundation of Faith let's say it had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's gra God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that anyone knows that but in Joseph was Perfection that is where you you you could set the monent at first it was it was do this or do if you don't do this this and this this if you don't do this or I I will not do this if you don't do this I will not do this it was lws but we thank God that He gave us the grace he built more he built again the foundation on love if he build the foundation again on Grace he build the foundation again on faith when you believe in God as the word says faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God you not just develop that Faith you you have to continue listening hearing the word of God attending to it giving it more time then the faith will come that is one of the foundations building a masterpiece what Masterpiece the bride Hallelujah the bride he's building a new masterace but in the Old Testament all they are built on if you don't do this this will happen if you don't do this it was lost but now he has given us Grace look at Jacob he was a supplanter he was a liar he was everything he also knew himself I think all of you remember the day when he cried he said I'll will not leave this Angel before you change my name because he knew his his status he knew what was in him so you should you also know know what is in you you also know what you do but hold on to the angel hold on to the angel hold on to the word of God hallelujah that word will change you that word will give you life that word will give you a peace of mind sometimes you ask ourselves what am I going to do what am I this and this I'm trying my level best yes we are trying all of us but we do not try by our our energy or by by our our thinking or by anything or by our intellectual we try because of God's grace because of those the the foundation he built on building a new masterpiece he's building a bride he's building you Hallelujah think of that at times people just come just they always just come to church because my friend will papor will not see me at church and ask me my father will not see me at Church my this and this will not H leave that because every individual receives salvation on an individual basis would do not inherit salvation you receive it on an individual basis God does not have grandchildren he does not have may this is a young child or this and this or what and what but he comes to you personally Hallelujah but though he comes personally we always have to also stand with our brothers and sisters we also have to keep our brothers keep keeping them always encouraging them to also take take the way because it's not easy taking it alone sometimes we BL we blame a lot uh our brothers and sisters that this and this he cannot leave this but it is e don't most people because we are not on the same level most people tend to be more spiritual and criticize others that are also growing in the faith it is a journey my brother encourage your sister encourage your brother is a journey when I really think about it I really ask God to forgive me at times we tend to to to blame people so much but instead of blaming encourage your brother love your brother because it is only love that will help us keep pring on help our brother when you see a brother doing something wrong don't rebuke so much because you also once in that state Hallelujah sometimes we tend to forget where we came from I know where I came from I know what I I have been doing I know what I did and when I see a brother sometimes doing it I just feel the love of praying for that brother praying for that sister it's all that will keep us moving it's all that will build the bride you're not going to be the bride the bride of Christ Alone you're just pieces pieces that make up the bride so when you push away your brother I don't know you're breaking more your brother into more pieces that will not be even that will take long to be again brought back into one one piece Hallelujah but here in uh he promised he was starting a new masterpiece as you see in the on the day of Pentecost everything was was down everything the devil had tried so much to destroy it he started building up a new masterpiece many were broken into small small pieces but is bringing those small pieces through generations as you see it started e let us read in uh in Jeremiah chapter 18 verse 1- 16 to 6 song leader because you see a brother song leading you want to be this uh some great person in church you want to be some great person in the village HH but not everyone is going to be that great person leave like now someone who the right position sometimes God is mold are broken he's molding them back to the whole uh to to to a hole and it is painful sometimes but leave it for the porter it's a way to go when you try to to obstruct the porter you may become lame hallelujah how many like lame people how many here I see all of you do not like them because there's a way you look all of us do not like them isn't it so how many want to be lame if there's no one let the word of God work on you let God work on you let God mold the pieces hallelujah hallelujah let God mold you let God mold out what he seeing in you because you're not the holder of the vision he created us he knew what he wanted us to be he knew what you want he wants you to be you may not be like me I may not be like you some people like God has made people different in different kinds some people are soft in life some people are rough and people have nothing to do about it because is the nature he has some people are very fast in doing things some are slow some but all we leave it to God there has a reason sometimes why he does that thing Hallelujah so leave the pieces to God to make them a whole you may be going through difficult situations but leave the the situations leave all those that are breaking you leave all those to him he may break you he may break some something on you to mold a better thing on you sometimes we we we we become annoyed we start complaining to God about some things that are happening in our lives about things that are happening that Lord why is it taking long I'm not getting rich I'm not getting this and this but why why why sometimes we should not ask a lot because it takes a process a process to build up something brother brother Bram talks about those people that like uh that overnight riching is most people like such things like good things to come very first like nothing but all those good things have a process have a process so he's molding even right now he's molding me he's molding you it may seem too long for you it may seem so difficult for you but leave the pieces for God to mold them some people have even given up on themselves saying for me I'm a total sinner for me I I fa I failed I cannot try to do this but when you leave everything to God when you say God I really I I really cannot manage this and you're truly genuine with God you'll see even the things that were so hard for you to do you're now doing them someone could not pray for an hour you can now pray for even more than an hour ask yourself what happened Leave the Pieces to go to mold them don't give up on yourselves keep resing on we all we all go through abs and down and downs at times when you're down very down you feel most of us feel it that I'm really down but what do you do in that state do you just leave the state to continue just keep crying like Jacob he CED dear God help me change my status change my my my my everything change me change my name it's so we also have to do those are our fathers we look at them as you see here Jacob represented Grace truly when you read about Jacob he was not that good but God changed them look at Samson he was broken pieces before his enemies when they removed his eyes they cut his Red Rocks he was nothing they criticized him they said now where is your god but Samson what he did gave him victory at the end Hallelujah he just said God help me once again at least let me die with my enemies you should have that that that that in in you tell God I want to die with my enemies at least if I cannot die right let me die with my enemies fighting with my enemies you see Samson he was engaged into very many things we all know he was taken up by L with the girls DEA we also go through them sometimes some are even going through them right now youve Fallen you just have no that power that God gave you as a Believer but don't give up on yourself when you do not give up on yourself God is Resto will restore you slowly by slowly Samson reached at a point that even the kids will laugh at him imagine a great man imagine a belie you're there in the world and the ones that you used to preach to are now looking at you saying now what were you preaching what were you telling us you even get ashamed of yourself but when you do not give up on yourself God is going to build you again but I do not encourage Sinners sometimes may say ah God is building me let me continue doing this and this God is building me no because even go when God is building you it takes even you to get desperate for it at god build me God change me God do this and this help me change my my everything change my ways change everything you may continue doing them you may on you in the process doing something but when you're desperate on changing it that is the the issue in it when you're desperate it's where God starts from but some people are are comfortable that ah God knows things are not easy don't be comfortable in that state you are in even if you don't want to pray at least sometimes I feel sometimes I I was down I wouldn't pray but I when I was in my bed I said ah when I do not pray where will I be prayer is the only strength the the only greatest God has given us it's where everything changes I started asking myself when I was in my bed I said when I do not pray what will happen to me the devil may creep in so I started when I was on my bed still sleeping I started praying Slowly by slowly I sat on my bed now after some time I had the the strength of praying but if I didn't now what would happen I would sleep I would sleep throughout the night I I failed at times we give up very quickly just I cannot manage I cannot manage this and this I cannot manage but it's up to you giving up when you give up it's where the trouble starts from Hallelujah carry all your broken pieces to God and put them before him and say God I'm really tired I'm really tired may you change me it may be a long process it may be a long process to leave all your addictions it may be a long process to leave your Monga it may be a long process to leave your lying it may be a long process but when you're desperate about it God will build up the pieces that you feel cannot join to help you overcome and overcome to me I will give a living testimony though I was born in the message I didn't leave in the message only I re I reached at a point that I didn't value what I had because I had not met God I myself I reached at the point I would go to church because of my parents but I didn't have the strength of going there I reach at church and those I feel whatever they telling me is a bit boring but when you are seed of God however much you run away from God however much you feel I'm not worthy God still holds you he still has you in his hands I when they would preach the word and I hear a bit of it when I was not doing ah it would strike me very hard I go back home think about it that week I would keep thinking about it I'd pray God help me help me live as the word says help me do this and this but it started all with me the desperation though I didn't have the the the energy to to to overcome all the energy to fight the devil in some circumstances but started with me I said God help me change this I know it is not good I but some people are comfortable with what they they have year to year yeah to year a person does not change is the same and see living a life that is not good just because they do not give the pieces to God give the pie all the pieces to God he will mold you he will mold you back to what he had in mind to why you here have you ever asked yourself why you you you you in this world did you just come to die and then go you have a purpose to why you here do you know why Michael Angel was Mo was he was making that piece of Moses he reached at a point he stried it because he believed in it he believed in what he was making he had a vision on what he was making so God created us for a purpose Hallelujah he created us to serve some purpose you not here just to live and die have you ever asked yourself why you here did you just come to suffer in this world everyone has a purpose to why he's here ask God why did you bring me here you have a purose why I'm here but we all know there's one purpose that is uniform to us to why God created us he created us to worship Him Hallelujah worship him with all our heart with all our mind with all our strength Hallelujah may we leave that purpose you may have even other purposes God has created you for but that is uniform to us worshiping him he created all humans to worship Him Hallelujah you may feel very dry but we remember in Ezekiel God sent e Ezekiel he told him prophesy to these bones that they can come back to life let let us read there Ezekiel chapter 3 38 38 verse no it is 37 verse verse 1-6 it says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there was very many in the open Valley and low they were very dry they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered oh l oh Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus says the Lord unto thee bones behold hold that will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay s news excuse me and our Lay News upon you and will bring up Flesh on you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and he shall live and he shall know that I am the Lord hallelujah you may be the dry bones right now you may look at yourself as a heap of dry bones you may look at at yourself as a heap of nonsense you may look at yourself at a as a heap of nothing you're nothing but if God BR gave life back to the dry bones do you think he can give up on you he can never give up on you he created you for a purpose and the purpose has to be complished Hallelujah don't allow that situation don't allow don't obey to it so said no I was not created for this I was not created to do this I was created to serve God I was created to be an example as created to live God's word hallelujah don't allow the situation to sit on you here brother Bram says in the message persevering a real Christian fights for his position he has to stand alone him and God and he fights every inch of ground so you do not have to Baby them around at times our pastors take us and saying no us leave this person leave this and this but the here the prophet says you do not baby them though we are going through you may be going through that tough situation that you are not living righteously but we are not we are not trying to they're not trying to babysit you that you can remain in church it may be a short time of Grace that you have and you lose it out but here we see every Christian fights every inch as you see Joshua and calib when they were when they were fighting for the promised land they God told them every step you'll take it will be yours every inch you'll take it will be yours why did why did God say that yet you had the energy to just kill all the what were there sometimes you go through to Value what you have to Value the truth you have to Value God's word if I just give you this hotel that if M gives you this hotel that from today and onwards this is yours I think you may eat money and say ah now I'm going to just sleep wake up eat my money again sleep but do we sleeping every day because he knows and that's how all things are going even your Christian Life when you you sleep you deteriorate you start losing your power Hallelujah so let us stand for our let us stand and fight for our positions let us stand like Joshua and calib you also ask God where is my Mountain what is it give me my Mountain you promis this and this you have confidence of asking God God you promis me this and this you promise me that you'll be with me you promise me the Holy Spirit you promise me because you'll have confidence you'll have confidence in you that what whatever you're asking it really deserves to be yours but how can you come to ask God something even you're not worthy of that God give me the Holy Spirit ah and then you you're just there living your life the way you want you think God will give it to you you're not desperate for it you think God will give it to you you have to just be desperate you ask God like the man who was asking God to to fill him the holy spirit is that God when you do not fill me the Holy Spirit you'll find the Heap of my bones here he was desperate but we should not forget that he's not about all Us by the grace of God though even the desperation you have it is God's grace but some people sometimes even people go beyond the grace shall we live in sin because of that Grace will abound some people just take it for granted know what you're holding Hallelujah know what you're holding and then God will help you go through difficult situations go through even things that you cannot manage yourself from I have seen it some things I could not even overcome but when I said God here I am do whatever you want to do and God really did something because I was really desperate for it I said God change my life how can I always come to church and my life is still like this how can I always come to church and I'm still lying how can I always come to church and I'm still doing this and this think of that when you're right with God he will will help you through everything even when you you're in a bad bad situation is going to help you because being right with God doesn't it doesn't only mean that you're doing un right you're doing righteous things being genuine with God saying God I cannot manage this please help me you're right with God say God I cannot manage you're really sincere some people console themselves ah this one is this one is very little I can also manage but you cannot manage we cannot manage by ourselves be sincere to go tell God I cannot manage this and this I cannot go take away this go take away my life take away this and this I cannot manage them only that will make you more right with God being sincere with God hallelujah being sincere do you think Samson was right by the time he was praying was he right do you think Jacob was right by the time he was praying God came to save Sinners not righteous people but is the sinner supposed to call upon God God help me this and this Hallelujah as you see in the word the the word of God Hebrews chapter 4 chter 4:12 it says the word of God is quick and it it is better than a sword that is is like these swords that are edged both sides it will cut everything that you think even it cannot that you think I cannot separate my life with this and this you see sometimes you look at your life you say this is so connected Lord how can I do it like now if you look at my hand there's no joint that will show that here something can break at times you get so attached to sin and you become one thing but God's word it is sharper than a sword do you have the a two-edged sword it will cut even whatever you cannot see if can separate a spirit and a soul H give it to him give everything to him even when you see ah it is very difficult when you see when things are really tough you cannot make it he his word is more and more stronger to do it for you Hallelujah yeah let us read this quote as as welcome brother martin and that super anointing swept over over me say tell sister tell harti that she found Grace in the sight of God who could have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak by this gift into existence whatever she asks speak it into existence I looked at sister the first time it was ever performed on a human being I said sister ask what what you will God is going to give it to you what do you think of that does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is God's complete number here is the first time on a human being and he what did he choose some great arist Aristo a great noted Minister a poor little widow woman that could hardly write her name God knows what she is doing said ask what you will said unto brotherto brother unto me brother branam what do you mean I said ask anything you desires it shall be produced right here that you will know that the Lord God of of Heaven answers and his scriptures are true my first time with the new gift my first anointing I could hardly hear her and she looked around when had when we had been talking about her little CP sister I said oh oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jumping to the glory of God haty looked around and all all around and she said brother Bill my great desire is for the Salvation of my two boys what why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for $10,000 she would have got million God knew God know what she was going to ask for Hallelujah s had a sister by the time brother Bram asked her that what do you want little sister Edith who was crippled everyone would have looked at it saying your sister needs help can't you but at times even our prayers always ask God to or to help you pray his will upon your life as brother brother brother brother bham was was asking what why did you ask that he thought he would say God help my little sister who is crippled walk and brother brother brother brother Bram was saying you you'll see little Judith here jumping but why did she ask ask that God to save her her children it was God's right will for her to ask that so whatever we pray for whatever we ask ask God's will not to be contrary with God's word not to be not to always complain about God's word at times you ask what God does not want us get just because it is a hard desire Hallelujah always wait upon God's will life will not be so hard life will not really be so hard he will make you walk through what you're supposed to go through he will make you do what his will is in your life Hallelujah God bless [Applause]

about our welfare for Hereafter well what are we going to amount to if we gain the whole world Amen and it says in desperation paragraph 170 that remember desperation see what desperation will do desperation will drive across the sea with drive across the sea desperation will drive you from another state desperation will drive you anywhere a precious old father and his daughter with desperation try to get in come in every everything else and sit down and he continue to say that I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it is lack of love God the love of God I
