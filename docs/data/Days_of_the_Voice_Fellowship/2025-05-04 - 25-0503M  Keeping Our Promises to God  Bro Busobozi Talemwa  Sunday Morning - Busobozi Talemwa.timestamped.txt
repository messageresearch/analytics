[1:42:33] Amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:42:37] church.
[1:42:41] Amen. I just have a a few announcements
[1:42:44] but before we do that I think we can
[1:42:45] just read the scripture first then we
[1:42:52] Uh we are reading out of the book of
[1:42:58] Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:43:09] 5 and um we'll read verses four in to
[1:43:14] six in inclusive.
[1:43:23] 4
[1:43:26] to6. Excuse
[1:43:31] me. We're reading in the name of the
[1:43:35] Lord. Suffer
[1:43:42] not. Sorry, I think I'm looking at the
[1:43:44] wrong verse. We're beginning from verses
[1:43:47] four. When thou voest a vow unto God,
[1:43:52] defund not to pay it, for he has no
[1:43:56] pleasure in
[1:43:57] fools. Pay that which thou hast vowed.
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:18] Can we say amen to
[1:44:20] that? Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
[1:44:24] flesh to sin, neither say thou before
[1:44:27] the angel, that it was an error.
[1:44:29] Whatever should God be angry at thy
[1:44:32] voice, and destroy the work of thine
[1:44:34] hands,
[1:45:00] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated,
[1:45:05] please. Uh, first of all, I'd like to um
[1:45:08] I think these ones came in late. I'd
[1:45:10] like to recognize the presence of
[1:45:12] Joshua's siblings. Where are you? Can
[1:45:13] you stand?
[1:45:17] Can you all
[1:45:19] stand? Please join me to welcome them
[1:45:21] over there. God
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:24] bless to have you fellowshipping with us
[1:45:26] this morning. God bless you. You may be
[1:45:29] seated. Amen. There. Their parents I
[1:45:32] think in
[1:45:34] Kungu and um so um it's good to have
[1:45:38] them in fellowship.
[1:45:42] Um, also there is sister
[1:45:45] Joyce. Sister Joyce, I know you had
[1:45:48] someone that wanted to give their life
[1:45:50] to the
[1:45:52] Lord. You're still praying for them.
[1:45:55] Where's
[1:45:58] Joyce? Ah, all right. Over here. God
[1:46:00] bless
[1:46:01] you for a while. I've been looking for
[1:46:04] you each service asking where sister
[1:46:08] Joyce, but I'm happy to see you today.
[1:46:12] God bless you.
[1:46:14] Amen. And also there's a brother David
[1:46:17] who has been uh lost for a
[1:46:21] while. Nice to see you, brother
[1:46:26] David. We are even waiting for your
[1:46:29] family to see them for the first
[1:46:33] time. Amen. Amen. Is the Lord good? Has
[1:46:37] he been good to you this week?
[1:46:40] Amen. Nice to see different
[1:46:43] ones. Um, you know, those who are coming
[1:46:45] for the first
[1:46:49] time, brother Omnet, I'm happy to see
[1:46:51] you dressed as an elder. God bless you,
[1:46:54] sir. God bless you. Nice to see you.
[1:46:57] Amen. Amen. I mean, I could mention one
[1:47:00] by one. I'm happy to
[1:47:03] see sister back
[1:47:06] there. Always always I'm so happy to see
[1:47:08] you in
[1:47:10] church and I'm so happy to see each and
[1:47:12] every one of you. Turn to your neighbor,
[1:47:15] tell them God bless
[1:47:16] you. You're welcome to the house of
[1:47:20] God. Amen.
[1:47:22] Amen. Um it's been a
[1:47:26] while without traveling uh for some
[1:47:29] time.
[1:47:32] Uh those of you who know me, I um I've
[1:47:36] actually some people were shocked to
[1:47:38] hear that, you know, I'm a
[1:47:42] pastor because they know me on a mission
[1:47:47] field, you know. So even when we started
[1:47:50] this church, I was traveling to Ethiopia
[1:47:52] quite
[1:47:54] often. Sometimes I would be gone for two
[1:47:57] months. And I remember brother
[1:48:00] Martin at the time was the person song
[1:48:03] leading and then
[1:48:06] ministering. And then we had a few
[1:48:08] brothers come
[1:48:13] along and
[1:48:15] others and we appreciate you know we
[1:48:17] appreciate the uh the ministry that God
[1:48:19] has joined to um you know to DVF.
[1:48:25] There is a reason why God does that.
[1:48:29] He puts um he provides where there is
[1:48:32] need. He knows what we don't know. So he
[1:48:36] knows my
[1:48:37] weaknesses as a pastor. So he would give
[1:48:40] me other
[1:48:41] men and women to be um to cover up and
[1:48:46] be the
[1:48:48] strength. And my absence I realize from
[1:48:50] the church is my
[1:48:55] weakness because you know I miss you and
[1:48:58] then you also miss
[1:49:00] me. Uh but all in all whatever we want
[1:49:04] to do is for the glory of
[1:49:07] God. I was supposed to be away on
[1:49:13] Easter. I was actually supposed to be in
[1:49:15] Australia because brother Gary had asked
[1:49:17] me to go take Easter meetings for
[1:49:22] you. Uh but unfortunately the visa for
[1:49:25] Australia took very
[1:49:29] long and so I could not make that
[1:49:33] trip. Uh but incidentally as soon as we
[1:49:36] had postponed the trip then pastor
[1:49:42] called and he said that he wanted us to
[1:49:45] go and be with him
[1:49:47] in Kenya. We by the way had a very good
[1:49:51] meetings
[1:49:53] there. Wonderful time of
[1:49:55] fellowship with the believers in in
[1:49:58] Kenya and we went with several
[1:50:03] brothers and his
[1:50:05] wife but I was about to say brother she
[1:50:09] used to travel with
[1:50:12] brother but this time uh is is very busy
[1:50:17] with his own family.
[1:50:20] So we are not able to travel
[1:50:22] but also brother
[1:50:24] polycup and who else? Just lift up your
[1:50:27] hand
[1:50:29] if yes
[1:50:32] who is that? Oh brother Dixon. Um and
[1:50:35] also brother Daniel. Brother Daniel. Is
[1:50:38] that is that all?
[1:50:40] Yeah. Oh also brother Josh. Nana Josh
[1:50:43] and brother praise. I remember praise.
[1:50:46] What is brother praise? We're going to
[1:50:48] praise. H okay. I couldn't see. Uh
[1:50:52] brother was uh obstructing. So um we
[1:50:55] traveled with those to Kenya
[1:50:58] and also with pastor Kaith
[1:51:00] from Jamaica and we shared the meetings
[1:51:04] there and it was a good
[1:51:07] time. It's a a blessing to serve the
[1:51:10] bride of
[1:51:12] Christ no matter where it is.
[1:51:16] So, uh, my visa for Australia finally
[1:51:18] came through
[1:51:22] and, um, it's unfortunate for you, for
[1:51:26] us that I'm going to leave for a
[1:51:30] while, but it's fortunate for
[1:51:33] them because we shall be preaching to
[1:51:36] them for a
[1:51:39] while. Um, I was just looking at most of
[1:51:42] the flights that come out of Africa
[1:51:46] I think Australia is the farthest
[1:51:50] destination
[1:51:55] uh from
[1:51:56] here is is farther than
[1:52:00] UK then um you know most of
[1:52:04] Europe and the US
[1:52:08] and um you know
[1:52:09] Canada it's a little farther
[1:52:13] away. Uh so I was thinking it's quite
[1:52:17] and I'm explaining this for you to
[1:52:19] understand. It does. It is logically
[1:52:24] impossible for for me to just go away
[1:52:28] for a weekend going to such a farther
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:33] distance after spending so
[1:52:36] much and then you just go for three four
[1:52:40] days is practically not
[1:52:43] [Music]
[1:52:44] worth. So I'll be away for the entire
[1:52:48] month of May.
[1:52:51] And I'm also not actually going to
[1:52:53] Australia only. We are I'm going to have
[1:52:54] about 10 services in
[1:52:56] Australia. Australia. I'll visit Brother
[1:52:59] Gary for the first
[1:53:01] weekend. He's really my main
[1:53:04] host and then I'll be also going out
[1:53:07] into the
[1:53:10] country several other
[1:53:12] churches. Uh so for a total of about 9
[1:53:15] to 10
[1:53:17] services. So it's a working trip. I'm
[1:53:19] not going to
[1:53:21] relax. I'm going to uh preach this
[1:53:26] message. Um then from there, Australia,
[1:53:30] I will also go to Singapore. Singapore.
[1:53:33] Singapore is a country about five five
[1:53:35] to six hours away from
[1:53:39] Australia. So I'll also be there for a
[1:53:43] weekend and then I will return home.
[1:53:46] I'll be back next month.
[1:53:49] Uh but that is a short trip compared to
[1:53:51] the others I've taken because I've I've
[1:53:52] been away for two
[1:53:56] months. But it things are different
[1:53:59] now. God has given us a lot of
[1:54:03] brothers that can be able to minister to
[1:54:06] us and um you will I'm sure you're going
[1:54:09] to be
[1:54:10] blessed with the different uh
[1:54:14] ministries. Um I remember I used to
[1:54:17] travel and uh I have to get like I have
[1:54:19] a friend of mine brother Bate and others
[1:54:21] I would asking them to come and fill my
[1:54:27] place but things are different
[1:54:30] now we have brother
[1:54:33] Martin he'll be ministering to
[1:54:36] you we have brother Julius
[1:54:39] some people don't know brother Julius
[1:54:41] stand
[1:54:42] up stand up and face the people with
[1:54:46] That's brother
[1:54:47] Julius. We'll be ministering to you. Um
[1:54:51] we have um uh brother
[1:54:54] Emmanuel. Stand up. Brother Emanuel.
[1:54:56] Some people don't know him. This
[1:54:58] brother, you have never heard him
[1:55:00] minister. Uh but I've we posted one of
[1:55:04] his clips or one of his preaching on the
[1:55:06] on the
[1:55:09] group and it was really a blessing.
[1:55:12] Actually, brother took an entire sermon
[1:55:15] which really blessed us
[1:55:19] here. This brother miners
[1:55:23] in he will also minister I think one of
[1:55:26] the
[1:55:28] Wednesdays. We have brother
[1:55:31] Daniel. Brother Daniel, can you
[1:55:34] stand? Yeah. Look, look behind if you
[1:55:37] don't know
[1:55:37] him. right
[1:55:41] there. Brother Shem, how many were
[1:55:44] blessed by brother Shem's ministry?
[1:55:48] Hallelujah. Uh, he has a special
[1:55:50] ministry.
[1:55:52] Trust me, I cannot say that unless if I
[1:55:57] have seen it to
[1:55:58] be he will take a service or
[1:56:02] two. So, um, and then I think I've
[1:56:05] forgotten several. Yeah, brother
[1:56:08] poly. Yeah, he's
[1:56:10] uh he has an interesting ministry
[1:56:13] also growing and I'm sure that um uh
[1:56:17] these young brothers will stand with the
[1:56:20] uh other more experienced
[1:56:23] brothers and brother Joel. Where's
[1:56:25] brother Joel?
[1:56:27] Joel. Some people don't know you. So
[1:56:30] just Yeah. Brother Joel
[1:56:34] and brother Marvin here.
[1:56:38] Amen. Amen. So these brothers, I'm sure
[1:56:40] I've forgotten someone, but all these
[1:56:43] brothers are all from the
[1:56:46] house. So they will minister to
[1:56:48] us in my
[1:56:50] absence. Let us stand with them. Let us
[1:56:54] support them and um and you know, let us
[1:56:57] attend
[1:56:58] church. There are some service there are
[1:57:00] some churches where the pastor can't
[1:57:02] even announce he's going to be away.
[1:57:06] because he knows if he
[1:57:08] tries the church will be empty that's
[1:57:11] when everybody will plan to go to visit
[1:57:15] grandmother because pastor is not
[1:57:18] allowed we don't come to church for
[1:57:20] pastor we come to church because of the
[1:57:23] message because of the lord and so
[1:57:26] please always uh stand behind these
[1:57:29] brethren and the others who are going to
[1:57:32] be you know brothers
[1:57:34] and going to be
[1:57:37] ministering in the other
[1:57:39] department. I mean like Sunday school
[1:57:43] teachers, the media
[1:57:45] department, music department,
[1:57:48] singers. We have a lot of brethren
[1:57:51] really
[1:57:52] serving and I usually call all of them
[1:57:56] ministers because they're ministering in
[1:57:58] the
[1:57:59] temple. We we we so much appreciative
[1:58:03] all the sacrifices everyone is
[1:58:05] doing for the glory of the Lord.
[1:58:09] Also, I'd like you to
[1:58:11] remember Oh, before I leave that, will I
[1:58:14] send your
[1:58:16] greetings? Amen. Amen. Amen. Uh I will
[1:58:20] now send them when I know you have given
[1:58:22] them to
[1:58:23] me. And uh also I I would like you to
[1:58:28] pray for two things. Number one, we are
[1:58:33] looking for another
[1:58:35] venue for the fellowship in
[1:58:40] um the current one we have is at is this
[1:58:43] is the uh hall the main
[1:58:48] hall but it is in a little bit
[1:58:54] inconvenient because their times are
[1:58:57] strict. There's already a church for
[1:58:59] shipping there on Sunday
[1:59:02] mornings. So, we can only do Sunday uh
[1:59:06] evening. We need to find a place where
[1:59:08] we can have a Sunday morning
[1:59:11] service and other services as
[1:59:14] well. Would you pray for that
[1:59:17] please? Whether the Lord will
[1:59:20] provide also we shall be able to find a
[1:59:22] suitable
[1:59:24] place. Um also uh we are preparing a
[1:59:28] mega
[1:59:31] crusade. Um it's going to actually I was
[1:59:35] I'll just give you a little bit of uh
[1:59:37] what we are
[1:59:39] planning. We are planning to have about
[1:59:42] 50 young
[1:59:45] people and young does not mean
[1:59:49] age. You can be 50 no
[1:59:51] problem. But we want young because they
[1:59:54] can be able to move
[1:59:57] and
[1:59:58] evangelize, invite people. So we we are
[2:00:02] planning to go there and do a mega
[2:00:03] crusade with about 50 young
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:06] people and um you know it's a bit
[2:00:10] different the way we want to do
[2:00:12] it. The budget will be
[2:00:16] big but I don't some of these things are
[2:00:18] not exclusive to Pentecostals.
[2:00:23] Why do they do
[2:00:25] crusades? The way they do them, the way
[2:00:28] they do them, yet they don't have a
[2:00:32] message. We have a
[2:00:34] message. So we are we are supposed to do
[2:00:38] more than even what they're
[2:00:40] doing. So this is what we are currently
[2:00:43] planning. And I just begin to prepare
[2:00:46] yourself. Who was registering the names?
[2:00:50] Brother Dan was. So if you are
[2:00:53] interested to participate in
[2:00:55] that, please see brother Dan and he will
[2:00:59] put you on the
[2:01:00] list. But I warn you, if you don't go to
[2:01:04] him, we will put you on the list
[2:01:07] anyhow and we shall tell you please
[2:01:10] these are the
[2:01:12] days. So you volunteer and go before we
[2:01:14] put you on the
[2:01:17] list brothers and sisters.
[2:01:20] Yeah. This is not exclusive to
[2:01:24] brothers. Amen. Amen. So, are we ready
[2:01:28] for the word?
[2:01:31] Amen. It's already midday, so I know I
[2:01:34] usually preach up
[2:01:36] to
[2:01:38] 120. Uh, but just in case I go a little
[2:01:41] overboard,
[2:01:44] uh, bear with me. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:48] So I'm going to uh speak on a very
[2:01:50] interesting uh
[2:01:52] subject. Keeping our promises to
[2:01:57] God. When you vow a vow unto
[2:02:01] God, define not to pay
[2:02:04] it. God has no pleasure
[2:02:08] in
[2:02:11] fools. Pay that which you have vowed.
[2:02:14] Better is it that thou should not vow
[2:02:17] than thou should vow and not
[2:02:23] pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
[2:02:26] flesh to
[2:02:29] sin. Amen. Don't tell an angel it was an
[2:02:34] error. Meaning an angel will come and
[2:02:37] will ask you what about what you
[2:02:40] promised
[2:02:41] God and you will say oh I made a
[2:02:43] mistake.
[2:02:45] Don't do that.
[2:02:48] So God will require you to pay the vows
[2:02:52] you have
[2:02:54] made to to keep the promises you have
[2:02:59] made. Praise the
[2:03:02] Lord. Now I want us to begin this
[2:03:04] looking at
[2:03:06] God and his word. And I'll do a little
[2:03:10] bit of quoting in this
[2:03:11] service in the message in the church of
[2:03:13] the living
[2:03:15] God. God is worth no more than his
[2:03:19] word. And if his word is no
[2:03:22] good, then he is no
[2:03:24] good. Now I if I can't put no confidence
[2:03:28] in what you
[2:03:31] say, you are no
[2:03:33] good. But you are just as good as your
[2:03:36] word is.
[2:03:41] this what I'm what we are going to talk
[2:03:42] about
[2:03:43] today. Can I have a little more sound?
[2:03:45] What we're going to talk about today is
[2:03:48] um let me call it Christian
[2:03:51] living. How are we expected to be uh as
[2:03:55] Christians, as
[2:03:58] believers? Are we not supposed to have a
[2:04:01] difference between us and the world?
[2:04:06] Are we supposed to tell lies every now
[2:04:08] and then?
[2:04:10] You find many believers don't have fear
[2:04:12] to tell
[2:04:14] lies. A lie as simple as I'll come and
[2:04:17] see you
[2:04:19] tomorrow and they will not come and they
[2:04:22] will not call to let you know that they
[2:04:23] are sorry they were not able
[2:04:27] to. They tell you, "Well, I I I will
[2:04:30] help you and they will not help you."
[2:04:33] And they not come back again to let you
[2:04:36] know why they were not able to
[2:04:39] help. You understand what I'm talking
[2:04:41] about? You know, they
[2:04:43] pledge on
[2:04:46] funerals. Many people do that on
[2:04:50] weddings.
[2:04:51] Go back and look at how many weddings
[2:04:53] you have pledged
[2:04:56] to and how much of that pledge you
[2:04:59] fulfilled. You see, when you pledge to a
[2:05:03] brother, you are pledging unto the Lord.
[2:05:06] So, if you do not fulfill your
[2:05:08] pledge, you have lied. You've not kept
[2:05:12] your promise. You are a liar and you are
[2:05:15] a
[2:05:16] fool according to the word.
[2:05:20] Praise the name of the Lord. So you see
[2:05:23] try to begin making
[2:05:27] inventory. Do you fulfill your
[2:05:30] pledges? We have land
[2:05:33] fund. When you in your heart pledged to
[2:05:35] the
[2:05:37] Lord and Lord if you do
[2:05:39] this I am going to give this
[2:05:44] mercy. Lord just try
[2:05:47] me. Can God fulfill his
[2:05:50] promise? Did you fulfill your
[2:05:53] promise? Did you keep your
[2:05:55] vow before
[2:05:57] God? Well, of course, no one knows your
[2:06:00] vow. But God knows your
[2:06:05] vow. Praise the name of the Lord. And so
[2:06:09] today, I'm the
[2:06:10] angel. Don't tell me it was an
[2:06:13] error. I am here to remind you. Whatever
[2:06:16] vow you make, oh God, if you give me
[2:06:19] this
[2:06:21] child, I am going to do this for you.
[2:06:24] You know, many times in our prayers, we
[2:06:26] make this
[2:06:27] vow, especially when our back is against
[2:06:30] the wall and you really need God to
[2:06:33] come, not just an
[2:06:35] encouragement, but you need something
[2:06:39] to you pushed to make a vow.
[2:06:43] Oh God in your desperation. Many times
[2:06:47] we make vows in
[2:06:50] desperation or in
[2:06:52] expectation. Then you tell God just try
[2:06:55] to do this thing for
[2:06:57] me. Give me this job. I will not miss
[2:07:04] any. I'll give my first fruit. I give my
[2:07:08] tithe. I will be faithful. I will live
[2:07:11] right. I will do this and that. Did you
[2:07:15] keep your
[2:07:16] vows? We are talking about keeping our
[2:07:19] promises to
[2:07:21] God. And don't be so
[2:07:24] quiet if the word is cutting
[2:07:27] you. Let it cut you while you are
[2:07:29] shouting
[2:07:30] anywhere. So he says, if I can't put no
[2:07:33] confidence in what you
[2:07:35] say, you are no good. But you are just
[2:07:39] as good as your word is.
[2:07:42] And God is just as good as his word
[2:07:47] is. And I as a Christian
[2:07:50] believer, I believe that this Bible is
[2:07:55] inspired. You believe that? And it is
[2:07:58] written by the Holy
[2:08:00] Spirit and it is infallible word of
[2:08:04] God. And God is under
[2:08:08] obligation to his word. to the believer
[2:08:12] that will accept his
[2:08:14] word. God is under
[2:08:18] obligation to his word and any word is a
[2:08:23] seed if you accept it in your
[2:08:26] heart by faith and you believe
[2:08:31] it and confess it, God will bring it to
[2:08:36] pass. Amen. So whatever God has
[2:08:39] said and you accept it by faith in your
[2:08:43] heart and you believe it in your heart
[2:08:46] and you confess it on your mouth, God
[2:08:49] will bring it to
[2:08:51] pass because God keeps his
[2:08:55] word. In the beginning was the word and
[2:08:58] the word was with God and the word was.
[2:09:04] So the word
[2:09:06] is the word is
[2:09:08] God. Oh praise praise God. This means
[2:09:13] whatever God
[2:09:15] says that is him.
[2:09:20] Revelation
[2:09:21] 19:13. And he was clothed with a vesture
[2:09:24] dipped in blood and his name is called
[2:09:27] the word of God.
[2:09:49] Amen. So what is the name of the lamb of
[2:09:52] [Music]
[2:09:54] God? Come on now.
[2:09:57] First John said, "In the beginning was
[2:10:00] the what?
[2:10:02] the word and the word was with and the
[2:10:04] word
[2:10:05] was and then here he says his name is
[2:10:09] called the word of
[2:10:12] God. So if you want to see
[2:10:15] God, believe the word. If you want to
[2:10:18] believe God, believe the word of God.
[2:10:21] The word of God is equals to
[2:10:24] God. That's why the Bible says his word
[2:10:27] is forever settled in
[2:10:32] It cannot fall to the
[2:10:34] ground. If God says you will be blessed,
[2:10:39] it cannot be changed. If God says
[2:10:42] tomorrow, you are going to be a
[2:10:45] millionaire. That nothing in the world
[2:10:47] can
[2:10:48] change. Even if it looks like it cannot
[2:10:52] be, God's word is always
[2:10:56] truth and his word always
[2:11:00] happen. Amen. Why? Because a
[2:11:03] word is a thought
[2:11:07] expressed. Before you think something,
[2:11:10] before you say
[2:11:12] something, what do you do? You think
[2:11:14] it is a thought before you say it.
[2:11:19] Okay. Now in the message making a
[2:11:21] way the prophet says now before it can
[2:11:24] be be a
[2:11:26] word it has to be a
[2:11:29] thought for a word is a thought
[2:11:34] expressed. God in his
[2:11:37] mind perceived these
[2:11:40] things and then they were in his
[2:11:44] mind. Then he spoke them.
[2:11:48] And they are as good as finished when
[2:11:50] God speak.
[2:11:58] Hallelujah because he is
[2:12:02] infallible and he can do nothing
[2:12:06] else. He only does what he
[2:12:10] thought and what he thought is what he
[2:12:14] speaks. You know when you look at
[2:12:16] parliament
[2:12:18] Some of you who love watching those
[2:12:19] parliament when they're
[2:12:22] debating the South African parliament is
[2:12:25] is really very
[2:12:27] funny. the South African Parliament.
[2:12:32] I saw several I've seen several clips
[2:12:34] and and you know these politicians and
[2:12:38] you know one comes up and says
[2:12:39] something and he says something and the
[2:12:43] speaker you know calls him to
[2:12:45] order or maybe someone else comes and
[2:12:48] complains oh no how can he call me
[2:12:52] that and then the speaker says oh my my
[2:12:55] friend withdraw the
[2:12:57] watch so wedraw and if he refuses to
[2:13:01] withdraw the words, he will be thrown
[2:13:03] out of the party. Listen to me. The man
[2:13:06] has to come on the
[2:13:08] podium and say, "Okay, speaker." Right
[2:13:11] honorable speaker, I
[2:13:15] withdraw. But you already said it. But
[2:13:18] because it was not good, you have to
[2:13:21] withdraw. But God cannot withdraw
[2:13:23] anything he
[2:13:26] say. Whatever he says he has already
[2:13:29] sought
[2:13:30] it. Sometimes you can speak
[2:13:33] words and it will damage it will cause
[2:13:36] damage to the
[2:13:38] people. Sometimes even we as
[2:13:41] preachers you know you don't expect
[2:13:44] preachers to be
[2:13:46] perfect. Yes. A preacher is a man of
[2:13:50] God the anointing everything is
[2:13:55] perfect. And that is true. When he's
[2:13:58] under the anointing, everything is
[2:14:00] fine. But sometimes, you know, as a
[2:14:03] human being, he may say
[2:14:06] something which did not come from the
[2:14:09] anointing and it may not be completely
[2:14:12] good. It may hurt you. You may feel bad.
[2:14:17] How can he say that? Especially you know
[2:14:20] we are going to have a lot of brothers
[2:14:22] preaching
[2:14:23] here and some of them are young in the
[2:14:25] ministry. You find that you know words
[2:14:27] like that can come
[2:14:29] through. What are you going to do? Are
[2:14:31] you going to walk away? You must
[2:14:33] understand this is a human being. He is
[2:14:36] not
[2:14:37] infallible but God is
[2:14:41] infallible. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:14:43] Man is fallible but God is
[2:14:46] in. Are you are you are you hearing me?
[2:14:49] What I'm trying to say that we as human
[2:14:52] beings many times we will speak
[2:14:56] words and these
[2:14:58] words many times we will withdraw them
[2:15:04] because I shouldn't have said
[2:15:06] [Music]
[2:15:07] that how many have ever
[2:15:10] been you know including me I've been
[2:15:12] there and then he says something
[2:15:14] and I shouldn't have said that but
[2:15:17] there's already gone
[2:15:19] and hurt somebody, you will go to them
[2:15:22] and say, "Well, I never meant
[2:15:24] that." They will say, "But you say that
[2:15:27] so you can't unsay it." But you see, we
[2:15:30] we are men and many times that will
[2:15:33] happen. And that's okay because we are
[2:15:36] human beings. Are you following me? But
[2:15:40] God, his word is invalid.
[2:15:44] He thinks before he
[2:15:46] speaks and his thought is
[2:15:51] perfect. So if God has ever told you
[2:15:55] anything, don't worry. He will never
[2:15:57] change
[2:15:58] it. You can Amen. Put your life
[2:16:02] on. Oh hallelujah. Amen. You know we can
[2:16:05] study many books. We can read many
[2:16:08] books. Sometimes those books contain
[2:16:13] theories, someone with
[2:16:15] theory. You know, you read it and read
[2:16:18] it and then afterwards you get a
[2:16:20] bachelor's degree, you get a master's
[2:16:22] degree, you get a PhD, you know, oh, you
[2:16:25] are educated, but that simply means
[2:16:28] you're full of many
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:31] theories. But those things are
[2:16:34] valid. That is why brethren, we must
[2:16:38] always put our
[2:16:40] life to something that is
[2:16:44] infallible. That does not mean you
[2:16:46] should not go to
[2:16:47] school. Go to school and learn the fible
[2:16:51] things so you can know how others
[2:16:54] think and then you can know how to live
[2:16:57] among. Are you following me? But your
[2:17:00] life when it oh my God when it comes to
[2:17:04] your
[2:17:04] soul you can never bless it on those
[2:17:08] things. Amen. You can only bless your
[2:17:11] soul on something that is
[2:17:14] eternal something that is perfect on
[2:17:17] something that is
[2:17:19] unchangeable on something that is
[2:17:21] permanent. And the word of God is
[2:17:24] permanent. The word of God is
[2:17:26] infallible. Whatever he say is perfect.
[2:17:31] Before he said it, it was perfect. After
[2:17:34] he said it, he cannot
[2:17:37] revive. He cannot have first
[2:17:42] edition. His word is only first
[2:17:48] edition. Without
[2:17:50] it, it settles it. And that's why I
[2:17:54] believe
[2:17:56] it. Whatever he says, he cannot change.
[2:18:01] That's why we are a wordbased
[2:18:04] church. We are not a man based
[2:18:07] church. We are not followers of men. We
[2:18:11] are not a cult. We are following
[2:18:14] God because his word is
[2:18:18] permanent. He says, "Yeah, let every
[2:18:21] man's word be alive.
[2:18:24] and my
[2:18:25] word be the truth. So then God is
[2:18:30] attitude follow me closely. If God saves
[2:18:34] saved sinners back
[2:18:36] there on the basis of accepting the
[2:18:38] burnt
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:41] offering the sacrifice
[2:18:44] provided he has got to do the same thing
[2:18:46] today.
[2:18:49] or he did wrong when he took the first
[2:18:51] man
[2:18:54] by. If God healed a sick back
[2:18:57] there upon the basis of the shed blood
[2:19:00] of an
[2:19:03] animal, upon the basis of the
[2:19:07] atonement, God has to do the same thing
[2:19:12] today. Oh, he was wrong when he healed
[2:19:15] the first person.
[2:19:19] You can't
[2:19:20] change. We as human beings, we
[2:19:23] grow. We
[2:19:25] mature. We find better
[2:19:28] [Music]
[2:19:29] things. We talk better
[2:19:33] things. We wear better
[2:19:36] things. The other time I was I was back
[2:19:39] home and you know uh put up my
[2:19:45] pictures and
[2:19:47] And they were showing me my
[2:19:49] pictures. You know when I was like
[2:19:53] a how would I have dressed this for
[2:19:56] sure?
[2:19:57] Actually the court I was not dressing
[2:19:59] it.
[2:20:01] It was dressing
[2:20:03] me if you look at that
[2:20:07] picture. But what happened at that time
[2:20:11] I thought I was the best.
[2:20:15] I thought I was dressed better than
[2:20:16] everybody
[2:20:19] else. But I don't know how others looked
[2:20:21] at
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:23] me. But you see, now I am better than I
[2:20:27] used to be.
[2:20:30] And I can tell you I am still
[2:20:33] changing. Hallelujah.
[2:20:37] My hairstyle is changing.
[2:20:41] That's why some some brothers, you know,
[2:20:43] they get all stuck on people's way they
[2:20:46] do the
[2:20:49] hair. The brother gets offended or
[2:20:52] brother. Sometimes you have to
[2:20:54] understand this is a young person
[2:20:58] growing. Allow them a chance to
[2:21:01] grow into the grace of Christ that they
[2:21:04] will understand. The things I used to
[2:21:07] do, I do them.
[2:21:11] Because even you are not the same way
[2:21:14] you used to
[2:21:15] be. Amen. There was a time I used to
[2:21:19] wear a big
[2:21:21] cross because I I did not know
[2:21:25] better. I used to see a bishop wearing a
[2:21:28] big
[2:21:30] cross is a
[2:21:32] crucifix. So when I came into the
[2:21:34] message, I found it difficult to leave
[2:21:38] it. I even read in the message where
[2:21:42] they asked brother, is it wrong to put a
[2:21:45] crucifix like in your car or
[2:21:49] something? He said, I don't see a
[2:21:51] problem. I said, you see, I can also
[2:21:54] wear
[2:21:55] a because brother said a crucifix is a
[2:21:58] sign of of the of of the crucification
[2:22:00] of Jesus.
[2:22:04] And so we remember
[2:22:05] Calvary. You get a point at the time as
[2:22:09] I can also wear the
[2:22:11] cross. I can wear the cross. And if you
[2:22:14] come to dick on
[2:22:17] me how worldly I am, I will explain it
[2:22:21] away with a
[2:22:22] [Music]
[2:22:25] quote. You find people who like you know
[2:22:28] dressing all the jewelry.
[2:22:32] putting this here, putting this here,
[2:22:34] necklace, this
[2:22:35] that let me tell you, you need to leave
[2:22:38] these people to
[2:22:40] grow. And I'm preaching what I'm I am
[2:22:43] understanding what I'm talking
[2:22:47] about. We do not believe in
[2:22:53] legalism. Do this, do that, do this.
[2:22:57] That has never saved anybody.
[2:23:01] What saves us is the grace of
[2:23:04] Jesus. Listen, that comes by the
[2:23:09] word. You know what? If that this
[2:23:12] person, this woman, this boy, this
[2:23:15] girl gets in contact with this
[2:23:19] world, this word will do the same thing
[2:23:22] in their
[2:23:23] life that he did in my life that he did
[2:23:27] in your
[2:23:28] life. Brethren, we ought to say,
[2:23:32] "Amen." You know, I can't wear that
[2:23:35] cross anymore. The things I used to do,
[2:23:38] I deserve no
[2:23:39] more. It is okay for
[2:23:42] you. It's all right by
[2:23:44] me. But my revelation is
[2:23:51] higher. I've grown higher in
[2:23:55] knowledge. I've grown higher in
[2:23:58] revelation. I've gone higher in
[2:24:01] understanding. And now the way I speak,
[2:24:05] the way I dress, the way I present
[2:24:08] myself is not the way I used to do
[2:24:11] it. There was a time, I used to wear a
[2:24:14] short.
[2:24:16] Yes. Yes. A
[2:24:19] short and when brothers would come to me
[2:24:23] say,
[2:24:23] "Believers, I'm not supposed to wear
[2:24:26] shirts." I pulled out a picture where
[2:24:29] the Bam was hunting in South Africa.
[2:24:33] And he had a short. So what are you
[2:24:36] talking about? And no brother here says
[2:24:40] shorts are women's underwear and under
[2:24:45] garments. A man that does that is
[2:24:49] a now I understand that I can't wear a
[2:24:53] short and go to a
[2:24:57] supermarket. My revelation is higher.
[2:25:00] My understanding is higher. I can't even
[2:25:03] wear a
[2:25:05] short and be in my house. I can only do
[2:25:08] that in the bedroom if I
[2:25:11] want. Imagine my children seeing me and
[2:25:14] all
[2:25:18] my
[2:25:22] hair. You're traumatizing your
[2:25:26] children. Let me tell you but if you
[2:25:29] it's okay by you as a brother of this
[2:25:34] belief of the word I can only know which
[2:25:36] level you are
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:42] at I can understand brother don't worry
[2:25:46] I can understand there is some maturity
[2:25:48] you need to get
[2:25:51] to
[2:25:54] amen you're my other but I will tell you
[2:25:57] this I have outgrown
[2:26:01] that I have I I am higher in
[2:26:05] revelation are you hearing what I'm
[2:26:07] saying if you as a sister can now say
[2:26:12] you know as long as it does not go it
[2:26:14] goes below the
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:16] knee and then you wear a dress which is
[2:26:21] just and then when you sit
[2:26:25] the skirt comes up. But when you stand
[2:26:31] it, we will know where you have reached
[2:26:36] in. Where you are in your Christian
[2:26:39] world, we will know you are a baby in
[2:26:43] Jesus
[2:26:45] Christ. You are not an
[2:26:47] [Music]
[2:26:49] unbeliever. You are a believer who is
[2:26:52] still very
[2:26:54] young. You still need to
[2:26:56] grow. But let me tell you, when you
[2:27:00] grow, no one will tell you those things
[2:27:04] are. You must receive a
[2:27:07] revelation. You throw them away. You
[2:27:11] begin putting on a real dress, a real
[2:27:15] scar because you have a real revelation.
[2:27:19] You know who you are.
[2:27:22] You are a woman, not a baby
[2:27:25] girl. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, we need to
[2:27:28] grow.
[2:27:32] So we see
[2:27:33] here then says we as human beings, we
[2:27:38] grow, we
[2:27:40] mature, we find better
[2:27:43] things, we talk of better
[2:27:46] things, we wear better clothing.
[2:27:50] We drive a better
[2:27:58] automo if I can get
[2:28:03] that I would drive it and
[2:28:11] people the brother has come. But when
[2:28:14] you grow, you're like, "That's for
[2:28:17] children. That's for young people. You
[2:28:20] don't want
[2:28:21] that. You you you want something more
[2:28:25] official, something which you you get
[2:28:28] the point?" So you see, we we will drive
[2:28:31] a better
[2:28:33] car. There are some of you, my mother
[2:28:35] was talking to me
[2:28:36] yesterday. She was saying, "I want to
[2:28:38] sell this
[2:28:39] car. I want to drive a better car now."
[2:28:43] I said, "What's wrong with this one?
[2:28:45] This one is very
[2:28:48] small. I'm ready to
[2:28:50] sacrifice and and I sacrifice more money
[2:28:53] and get a
[2:28:56] better whereby to her as I age 50 and
[2:29:01] above, she feels she has passed a
[2:29:03] certain
[2:29:04] thing. You get a point. This is all
[2:29:07] right because we are human beings.
[2:29:11] We are
[2:29:13] progressing. And and while I'm on that,
[2:29:16] let me put in the the last
[2:29:18] nail. We must allow people to
[2:29:24] progress naturally, spiritually,
[2:29:29] naturally. You see not you know what
[2:29:32] laws
[2:29:33] do, they force someone to be who they
[2:29:36] are
[2:29:37] not and they become hypocrite.
[2:29:40] That's why in our churches we are filled
[2:29:42] with many
[2:29:47] hypocrites. And this is different. Why
[2:29:49] I'm talking about is different. In the
[2:29:52] Pentecostals, they say it's okay. Here
[2:29:55] we are saying it is not
[2:29:57] okay. There is a way a believer must
[2:30:00] dress. A believer should not be that,
[2:30:03] should not be that, should not be
[2:30:04] that. We know. But we are saying we are
[2:30:08] not going to force anyone to be
[2:30:11] that you must mature and grow and
[2:30:15] progress into that
[2:30:19] revelation. So DVF we must be
[2:30:24] mature. Amen. where it says well a woman
[2:30:28] as long as she doesn't cut her
[2:30:31] hair she can keep it
[2:30:34] anyway as long as she has not
[2:30:37] carried and she shouldn't look like the
[2:30:40] world who has the
[2:30:43] measurement for what doesn't look like
[2:30:45] the
[2:30:47] world I will tell you what it is it is
[2:30:50] the level of your spiritual maturity
[2:30:53] [Music]
[2:30:56] Hey, if you brother, sister or rather
[2:30:59] your sister, if you go in the saloon and
[2:31:03] you make those kind of worldly
[2:31:06] hairstyles, if you shows me your level
[2:31:09] of
[2:31:12] immaturity, I will not judge you, but I
[2:31:16] will help you by praying with you and by
[2:31:20] preaching you some
[2:31:22] more. But adventure when you
[2:31:25] mature, you will reach a moment and
[2:31:28] say enough of these
[2:31:31] styles. I want to look more
[2:31:35] natural. I want to look like a a real
[2:31:38] good
[2:31:40] woman filled with the Holy Ghost, not
[2:31:43] just some kind of rec.
[2:31:52] You know they will have those
[2:31:54] hairstyles where you know part of their
[2:31:57] eyes closed
[2:31:59] in and you know when they come to talk
[2:32:01] to you with all the long
[2:32:06] nails and then you wonder why do you
[2:32:09] keep pushing the hair? Why don't you
[2:32:12] leave it there? is just some way of
[2:32:14] swag.
[2:32:16] [Music]
[2:32:18] Believers are supposed to be
[2:32:21] different. We are supposed to have a
[2:32:24] character of
[2:32:25] Christ. But if that's the level where
[2:32:27] you
[2:32:29] are sisters, don't make that young
[2:32:35] sister. Let her grow into
[2:32:39] it. I will tell you what you can do.
[2:32:42] Create an
[2:32:44] atmosphere for her to
[2:32:47] grow for her to
[2:32:49] progress the
[2:32:51] atmosphere. Love, love, love,
[2:32:55] love, love covers a mountain of
[2:32:59] sin. That's even why God loves us.
[2:33:03] When God loves us, he corrects us, but
[2:33:07] he
[2:33:08] loves. He doesn't weep
[2:33:11] us, but he loves
[2:33:13] us. Come on dear. Don't you think this
[2:33:16] is better? Don't you think this is
[2:33:19] better? And then you like, I want this.
[2:33:22] You say, "It's all right." And then you
[2:33:24] come back again. Why do you think about
[2:33:26] this? And then one day you like, I see
[2:33:29] him. I see him. I don't even
[2:33:33] say that's my
[2:33:35] beloved
[2:33:37] and is but
[2:33:41] one.
[2:33:43] Hallelujah. Glory to
[2:33:46] God. And then he says but God cannot
[2:33:50] progress in that way.
[2:33:55] We
[2:33:56] progress but God does not
[2:33:59] progress because he was perfect to begin
[2:34:04] with and perfection cannot progress
[2:34:09] anymore. Are you still
[2:34:13] progressing which means you're not
[2:34:16] perfect? None of us is
[2:34:18] perfect. We are
[2:34:21] progressing but God is not.
[2:34:25] That's
[2:34:25] why we do not need our
[2:34:29] perfection to make it. If it is by our
[2:34:35] perfection, all of us would go to hell
[2:34:38] because I will assure you we progress
[2:34:41] until we
[2:34:44] die. Even when a rapture come, we will
[2:34:48] still be progressing.
[2:34:50] But I'll tell you, brother, what is
[2:34:52] going to get us
[2:34:54] in is his
[2:34:57] perfection. Why? Because that never
[2:35:01] changes an
[2:35:03] inch. And when you receive it in your
[2:35:06] heart, you become
[2:35:11] perfection and then you begin hating
[2:35:13] these other
[2:35:15] things. So he was perfect to begin with.
[2:35:19] until perfection cannot progress
[2:35:21] anymore. It's already
[2:35:24] perfection. Amen. So you don't have to
[2:35:28] say God doesn't have to say well this is
[2:35:31] a different
[2:35:32] age. You've got a better thought
[2:35:35] now. If it is then he cannot be
[2:35:41] God. Regardless of the change of
[2:35:45] ages is the unchanging God.
[2:35:49] So if he is God but he spoke back
[2:35:54] there he has to stay with it
[2:35:57] now because he was perfect
[2:36:00] there but he's perfect
[2:36:03] now you see then he can't
[2:36:08] progress what I mean he can't end better
[2:36:15] things what we are preaching is not a
[2:36:19] new gospel. Listen, listen, listen. The
[2:36:22] message of the hour or the end time
[2:36:25] message of God is not a new
[2:36:29] gospel is not even a better
[2:36:33] gospel than what others are preaching.
[2:36:37] That is so then it is a
[2:36:40] force because what God had in the
[2:36:44] beginning you can't have something
[2:36:47] better. What he had in the beginning is
[2:36:51] what he would have
[2:36:52] today what he will have
[2:36:55] forever. It is the
[2:36:57] others that left that original
[2:37:02] gospel. Amen. What we are preaching we
[2:37:06] call the end time
[2:37:08] message the same old time
[2:37:12] gospel that Paul preached that Peter
[2:37:16] preached preached is the same one we are
[2:37:20] preaching the others
[2:37:23] departed that's why Malachi 4 is
[2:37:26] speaking about a
[2:37:28] restorer Elijah the prophet he will
[2:37:31] stand the hearts of the children back to
[2:37:34] the father. What we are preaching to you
[2:37:38] is not some new
[2:37:39] idea, some new revelation. It is a real
[2:37:43] old time
[2:37:45] gospel that has been
[2:37:49] restored back in our
[2:37:52] generation. Amen. The Catholics left
[2:37:55] it. The Anglicans left it. The goals
[2:38:00] left it. God in our generation has sent
[2:38:04] a prophet with a message, not a
[2:38:08] different one, but his message is a
[2:38:10] message of
[2:38:12] restoration to tell us go back to the
[2:38:17] Bible. Go back to what
[2:38:19] Paul, that's why Paul said, I have laid
[2:38:23] a
[2:38:23] foundation. Paul laid a foundation. And
[2:38:26] he said, "The foundation which I have
[2:38:28] laid is Christ. No man can lay
[2:38:33] another." And then he said,
[2:38:37] "Oh, but every man's work shall be
[2:38:40] tested with fire." And then he said if
[2:38:44] any man preach any other
[2:38:47] go there is not another but there are
[2:38:51] some who come men who captain unaware
[2:38:55] they come and try to
[2:38:57] pervert this gospel. But he said if any
[2:39:02] man even if it is earth even if it's an
[2:39:05] angel from heaven if he come and preach
[2:39:08] another gospel let him be cast which
[2:39:12] means
[2:39:13] The gospel which Paul preached and the
[2:39:16] apostles is the same one we are
[2:39:18] preaching
[2:39:19] today. But there are many who are
[2:39:22] cast because they left it. They left one
[2:39:26] god. They preached three gods. They left
[2:39:30] baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:39:32] Christ. They use father, son, holy
[2:39:34] ghost. They have no
[2:39:37] revelation. They have left the way it
[2:39:39] was done.
[2:39:41] But I thank God. There are groups of
[2:39:44] people all over the
[2:39:45] world. By the way, all over the
[2:39:48] world that have been
[2:39:51] restored, we are one of
[2:39:54] [Applause]
[2:39:55] those.
[2:39:58] Hallelujah. God's first thought was
[2:40:01] perfect.
[2:40:04] It is his
[2:40:05] thought that was
[2:40:09] expressed in his
[2:40:11] word. It cannot
[2:40:15] improve. It cannot
[2:40:17] progress. It is simply
[2:40:21] perfect. Amen. Tell your neighbor is
[2:40:25] simply
[2:40:27] perfect.
[2:40:29] Now we have been talking about the
[2:40:31] thought of God.
[2:40:34] Because you may wonder how does this
[2:40:35] connect with us keeping the
[2:40:37] [Music]
[2:40:40] promises? Why should we even keep the
[2:40:42] promises? We are in perfect human
[2:40:46] beings. Uhhuh. I want you to see the
[2:40:50] connection.
[2:40:50] Now after understanding who
[2:40:53] God then you have to understand who you
[2:40:58] are. Praise the name of the Lord. In the
[2:41:03] harvest, we are his
[2:41:08] attributes. So what was the thought of
[2:41:10] God
[2:41:14] expressed? The
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:18] word not. So are you following
[2:41:21] me? Be actively
[2:41:24] involved. I'm happy to
[2:41:26] say you know his thought is his word.
[2:41:34] Right. What what is his word? Where is
[2:41:37] his word? Is his word
[2:41:41] something or
[2:41:45] somebody? Did someone get
[2:41:47] it? Is his word something or somebody?
[2:41:52] Is his word the words in this Bible?
[2:41:58] If it it only stops
[2:42:00] there, then you will fail to understand
[2:42:05] God. Then you will see
[2:42:08] God only as a piece of
[2:42:13] [Music]
[2:42:15] information. Are you following me?
[2:42:17] Please keep your thoughts together with
[2:42:19] me. God is not a piece of
[2:42:23] information. Oh my. Get ready for this.
[2:42:28] Let me read this portion for you. Who
[2:42:30] could tell how uh who could tell God how
[2:42:34] to make
[2:42:36] things? In the beginning when there was
[2:42:39] just he
[2:42:41] alone and if we had eternal
[2:42:45] life there is only one form of eternal
[2:42:48] life and that is God.
[2:42:54] God. So if we have eternal
[2:42:58] life, do we have eternal
[2:43:01] life? In the book of John, he says, I
[2:43:04] give them eternal
[2:43:07] life. So we have eternal
[2:43:10] life. Oh, I'm so excited by
[2:43:12] that. I have eternal
[2:43:16] life in me. And he says if we have
[2:43:20] eternal
[2:43:21] life, we were with God right
[2:43:37] then. Please don't don't lean on your
[2:43:41] table. You will not understand. sit on
[2:43:44] the edge of your
[2:43:46] seat because you will miss something.
[2:43:49] Listen, he says if we have eternal
[2:43:52] life now, now now we were with God right
[2:43:58] then. And then he says a part of
[2:44:02] God. So which means the logos has a
[2:44:07] part. We are a part of him.
[2:44:11] We came from
[2:44:14] Jesus said I came from God. I go back to
[2:44:17] God. Meaning he was God and he was man.
[2:44:21] He was a part of God. Don't be confused.
[2:44:25] What Jesus was, you
[2:44:28] are.
[2:44:30] Hallelujah. That's why he's our brother.
[2:44:34] He's the first born. I'm the second.
[2:44:38] Amen. I am a part of
[2:44:40] God. We are his
[2:44:44] attributes. We are now his
[2:44:50] attributes. Where is somebody give me?
[2:44:55] All right. Look here.
[2:44:58] Church, come brother. You you work in
[2:45:00] water.
[2:45:03] Come. Read. What is this? How do they
[2:45:07] call that one? Composition. Okay. What
[2:45:09] does composition mean?
[2:45:11] Interpret it means what? The things
[2:45:14] which are contained in the water.
[2:45:17] Red number one, sodium, sodium,
[2:45:21] potassium, potassium, calcium,
[2:45:24] magnesium, iron and chloride. So these
[2:45:27] are the compositions. God bless you that
[2:45:30] he has read. These are the things that
[2:45:34] make this
[2:45:35] world. Amen.
[2:45:40] Now these are
[2:45:47] attributes. You got it.
[2:45:50] Now it is it is a part of this
[2:45:54] attributes of this
[2:45:55] water. Okay. How many elements do we
[2:45:58] have in our
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:01] body?
[2:46:02] Scientists rescue us
[2:46:05] here. Seven.
[2:46:08] Number one,
[2:46:12] there are 17. Uhhuh. Okay. Can we can we
[2:46:15] talk about some of them? Speak it out
[2:46:17] loud everybody if you
[2:46:23] water.
[2:46:27] Zinc zincion.
[2:46:30] We even have iron in our body. All
[2:46:32] right. That's amazing. Potassium.
[2:46:33] Potassium.
[2:46:35] Oxygen.
[2:46:45] Listen, those things,
[2:46:48] don't miss this. Don't
[2:46:50] miss.
[2:46:52] Listen, those
[2:46:54] things which make up our
[2:46:57] body is our
[2:47:00] body. Are you hearing now? There are
[2:47:04] attributes that make up our
[2:47:06] body. But those same attribute that make
[2:47:10] up our
[2:47:11] body also is the same thing which is in
[2:47:13] the
[2:47:15] soil. All those
[2:47:17] attributes that are in our body that
[2:47:20] make up our body are in the
[2:47:22] ground. That is why when they bury
[2:47:25] someone in the
[2:47:26] ground after so many years they will not
[2:47:29] find anything.
[2:47:32] Where will it go? It has gone back where
[2:47:35] it came
[2:47:38] from. Are you getting it? Now is the
[2:47:42] same thing like this attribute that make
[2:47:43] up the
[2:47:45] water is is the water attributes is
[2:47:48] equal to
[2:47:49] water. Now is saying here we are
[2:47:53] attributes of God.
[2:47:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. We come from God.
[2:48:02] We go back to
[2:48:03] God. He's not talking about the
[2:48:07] flesh. He's talking about the
[2:48:10] soul. Our soul is an attribute of
[2:48:14] God. That's where we came from. That's
[2:48:17] where we are
[2:48:19] going. You have that soul in
[2:48:23] you. You are a part of
[2:48:26] God. Logos has a part.
[2:48:30] Oh my my my my my.
[2:48:32] So we are his
[2:48:34] attributes and we are talking about our
[2:48:38] souls. Oh my my
[2:48:41] my knows that song prepare to sing it
[2:48:44] afterwards. You can kill my body but my
[2:48:48] soul. Amen. If you know that song,
[2:48:50] prepare to sing it. Wonderful song. And
[2:48:53] because in the beginning was the
[2:48:56] word and a word is a thought
[2:49:00] express. Uhhuh. We are now coming back
[2:49:02] to eat. A word is a thought of
[2:49:07] God.
[2:49:09] Express. So
[2:49:11] we are in his
[2:49:15] thought. Then we are
[2:49:18] expressed into
[2:49:21] word and we become what we
[2:49:27] are. Sit on the seat of your age on the
[2:49:31] edge of your seat rather. Listen
[2:49:33] carefully. Hear the word we were a
[2:49:37] thought. And then God said, "Let there
[2:49:41] be
[2:49:42] man in our
[2:49:45] image." And there was man in the image
[2:49:49] of which is God. He's not talking about
[2:49:51] the flesh. He's talking about what is on
[2:49:54] the
[2:49:57] inside. Now man in the image of
[2:50:01] God
[2:50:03] fell. He came in flesh. He fell from the
[2:50:07] glory of God.
[2:50:11] Not listen. Oh
[2:50:15] my. Listen. He fell from the glory of
[2:50:19] God, not from the image of God.
[2:50:23] [Music]
[2:50:28] Fallen
[2:50:29] man is still in the image of
[2:50:32] God but not in the glory of the
[2:50:40] image. That is why the message has to be
[2:50:44] preached. The word has to be preached.
[2:50:47] What is the
[2:50:48] purpose? Hunting for the lost
[2:50:51] attributes.
[2:50:55] We cannot know because serpent seed came
[2:50:58] in and there was a
[2:51:01] mixer. So we don't know whether everyone
[2:51:03] is an
[2:51:05] attribute but there's something that God
[2:51:09] has as a
[2:51:12] weapon to
[2:51:14] hand every
[2:51:16] attribute that was in God before the
[2:51:19] foundation of the world. Look at it this
[2:51:22] way. If God is a magnet, he has this big
[2:51:26] magnet which he will use to take
[2:51:30] everywhere.
[2:51:32] This magnet will only
[2:51:34] attract those pieces, those
[2:51:38] attributes that make up the
[2:51:42] magnet. Are you hearing me? Now, let me
[2:51:45] tell you, we are the thoughts of God.
[2:51:52] How did we come to
[2:51:53] be by the spoken
[2:51:55] word? But we have been
[2:51:58] lost and we have been from the glory of
[2:52:00] God
[2:52:01] down. So what God is doing, he sent his
[2:52:06] word
[2:52:09] again. He sent his word
[2:52:11] again. That's why I'm preaching right
[2:52:14] now. As I am preaching, whoever has a
[2:52:18] part of God in them,
[2:52:21] Whoever is an attribute of
[2:52:24] God, they will fill the
[2:52:26] pool. They feel they will hear the
[2:52:29] name. Why? Because whatever I'm talking
[2:52:33] about is what makes up your
[2:52:36] soul. You will feel the fire on the
[2:52:40] inside. Why? Because whatever you are
[2:52:44] hearing is connecting to what is in
[2:52:46] there.
[2:52:49] Let me tell you, brother, sister, you
[2:52:51] may be a drunkard. You may be in a bar.
[2:52:54] Amen. I don't care where you may be. You
[2:52:57] may be in a
[2:52:58] prostitute, prostitute house. You may be
[2:53:01] whatever it is, smoker. I don't care if
[2:53:05] you were an attribute of
[2:53:07] God. When a word comes, I told you, you
[2:53:11] will hear your
[2:53:14] name. You will hear your name and you
[2:53:17] will
[2:53:18] say that's why you are
[2:53:21] shouting. What is that? An attribute of
[2:53:24] God.
[2:53:26] Hallelujah. Amen. We are hearing our
[2:53:29] names. We are filling the pool. We are
[2:53:33] getting a
[2:53:35] connection.
[2:53:36] Amen. If you don't know what we talking
[2:53:39] about, stay alone for a while.
[2:53:45] Amen. Stay in church for a while. You
[2:53:48] will soon fill the
[2:53:52] pool. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why he
[2:53:55] sends his
[2:53:56] word. His word is coming to do well to
[2:54:00] call all the attributes of
[2:54:03] God. That's why we have to be born
[2:54:06] again. Not by our mother. born again by
[2:54:12] the spoken
[2:54:15] word. We have to have a word
[2:54:19] bath.
[2:54:21] Amen. A
[2:54:22] word. That's why when you go in this
[2:54:26] denomination, the word they
[2:54:28] have is
[2:54:31] mixed.
[2:54:33] So you go and get
[2:54:36] confused. That's why people just end up
[2:54:39] only dozing.
[2:54:43] Even if you're a
[2:54:44] seed and you go in those formal
[2:54:47] religious
[2:54:50] organization, you will not fool the
[2:54:53] pool.
[2:54:55] Why? The word is a
[2:54:59] mal. It's
[2:55:01] mixed. Have you ever taken
[2:55:04] wheat which is mixed with
[2:55:07] [Music]
[2:55:12] swallowing it is a problem.
[2:55:14] As you
[2:55:17] swallow, but when you take just
[2:55:21] wheat, it's just so soft. You feel nice.
[2:55:25] So many of you when you're buying wheat,
[2:55:28] you want to be sure about the
[2:55:33] supplier. Is it
[2:55:35] mixed what is original? That is why it
[2:55:39] matters where you attend
[2:55:44] church if you attend church where the
[2:55:47] word is preached and there is no
[2:55:50] pool change your
[2:55:53] church even if it is
[2:55:56] here because you may be serpent seed and
[2:55:58] you don't feel the
[2:56:06] pool but maybe When you go to
[2:56:09] Anglican, you will feel the pool when
[2:56:12] you go
[2:56:16] back. I'm enjoying this
[2:56:19] church. Or when you go among some of our
[2:56:23] friends, then they begin this. This is
[2:56:26] my
[2:56:27] church. This is my
[2:56:29] church. Then you feel the pool.
[2:56:33] But the
[2:56:35] bride, by the way, this is not about our
[2:56:37] church
[2:56:38] about it's about the
[2:56:41] world. So the bride is pulled by the
[2:56:45] what? Amen. Not by how many people in
[2:56:49] the
[2:56:49] church, not by how the good the preacher
[2:56:52] is
[2:56:53] dressed, but by the quality of the word.
[2:57:09] I'm sorry. The way I'm speaking is only
[2:57:13] reflecting my
[2:57:14] experience. Is only reflecting my
[2:57:18] experience because I've been in some of
[2:57:20] those
[2:57:21] denominations and I remember how I used
[2:57:23] to be.
[2:57:26] I
[2:57:27] remember they would bring a song, you
[2:57:31] want to begin
[2:57:33] singing. The best you can
[2:57:36] do is to tap your
[2:57:40] feet because you don't want to offend
[2:57:42] others. If you begin saying hallelujah,
[2:57:45] you will
[2:57:49] see. Thank God. He redeemed us and he
[2:57:54] restored us back again to the
[2:57:59] original where we can dance and have
[2:58:02] liberty of the
[2:58:03] spirit but where we cannot do the
[2:58:06] worldly
[2:58:09] dances where we we have found a
[2:58:16] balance. is the word that guides
[2:58:19] us, not a church
[2:58:23] manual. Okay, let's go back here. And
[2:58:25] because in the beginning was the
[2:58:27] word and a word is a thought
[2:58:30] expressed. So we were his
[2:58:33] thoughts that expressed into the
[2:58:36] word and become what we
[2:58:39] are. That's the reason our names may be
[2:58:42] not what we have now.
[2:58:46] That's the reason why our
[2:58:48] names maybe not the names we have
[2:58:54] now but our names our real names here is
[2:59:00] not talking about the name you're called
[2:59:02] by
[2:59:04] now he's talking about your
[2:59:08] identity. Hallelujah. Amen. Elijah.
[2:59:11] Elijah come here. Hallelujah. Stop
[2:59:15] there. Elijah. Did you see that? Is the
[2:59:18] power of calling a
[2:59:20] name. Amen. But the names he's talking
[2:59:23] about now is not
[2:59:26] Elijah.
[2:59:28] Uh-uh. He's is talking about some a
[2:59:31] name. I can call by reading the
[2:59:34] word, by preaching the word. And
[2:59:37] everyone whose names is
[2:59:40] there, they will
[2:59:42] respond. Amen.
[2:59:46] The names, our names were put on the
[2:59:48] lamb's book of
[2:59:51] life. Amen. Before the foundation of the
[2:59:55] world. And if it wasn't
[2:59:57] there, then it will never be
[3:00:00] there. I'm so glad my name is
[3:00:03] there. My name is on the book. Your name
[3:00:06] is on the book because you were there
[3:00:10] before the foundation.
[3:00:14] And Jesus come to
[3:00:17] redeem he came to
[3:00:19] redeem all those whose
[3:00:23] names on that
[3:00:26] book. He know
[3:00:28] them. Hallelujah. He didn't come to
[3:00:31] convince somebody. He didn't come to
[3:00:34] explain to somebody. Let me tell you, I
[3:00:37] don't believe what I believe because
[3:00:40] Amen. I received an explanation. I was
[3:00:43] not talking to this. Somehow somewhere I
[3:00:46] heard my name being called and I am here
[3:00:51] in
[3:00:52] response. When I say I am here, I'm not
[3:00:56] meaning this place. I am meaning the
[3:00:58] word. I am in the word. Why? I heard my
[3:01:03] name being
[3:01:05] called. We are the
[3:01:08] word made flesh today.
[3:01:17] Now remember, we are not the word. This
[3:01:21] is in questions and
[3:01:24] answers. Did we just say we are the
[3:01:27] word? And then the prophet of God says
[3:01:30] we are not the
[3:01:34] word. Put the quote
[3:01:38] there. We are not the word.
[3:01:41] Can we say amen?
[3:01:44] But we are the word. Can you also say
[3:01:47] amen?
[3:01:49] Pastor, I don't understand it. Who told
[3:01:51] you you have
[3:01:53] to? He said only
[3:01:59] believe. Brother, get a quote quickly.
[3:02:02] Jesus was not
[3:02:03] God. Can we say
[3:02:06] amen? Some people are like doubting.
[3:02:10] But he was
[3:02:12] God. Can you say amen?
[3:02:16] Many have got it now. He was a man yet
[3:02:20] he was God. He could cry and yet he
[3:02:24] could raise a dead. He could cry for a
[3:02:26] man being
[3:02:27] dead and raise him back again. He was
[3:02:31] Jehovah Gyra. He was Jehovah Rafa. He
[3:02:34] was Jehovah. He was Jehovah. All go with
[3:02:37] me. He was
[3:02:39] Jehovah and yet he was a
[3:02:43] man. He owned the earth and made the
[3:02:47] earth and had not a place to lay his
[3:02:51] head. That's what I'm talking about.
[3:02:54] Jesus was not God. That he was a man
[3:02:58] 100% human. But also Jesus was God. That
[3:03:03] he was God
[3:03:04] himself, the creator of heaven and
[3:03:06] earth. Listen to me. God is not flesh
[3:03:09] and blood. God is a
[3:03:12] spirit. And he the spirit which gives
[3:03:16] life was in
[3:03:18] Jesus. Amen. As a man, he cried when his
[3:03:22] friend
[3:03:23] died. But as God, he called
[3:03:28] Lazarus. As a man, he slept and he was
[3:03:31] tired. as God. He said, "Peace, be
[3:03:35] still." You have to understand Jesus was
[3:03:39] 100% man, 100% God. If you can't
[3:03:43] understand it, you can't understand
[3:03:47] yourself. Why? Because because there is
[3:03:51] a part in me that is the eternal God.
[3:03:56] There is a part in me that is the
[3:03:58] Jehovah, the creator of heaven and
[3:04:01] earth. The one that gives life that part
[3:04:05] in me is
[3:04:09] eternal. He says I give them eternal
[3:04:11] life. That part in me brother sister but
[3:04:16] also amen with me there is another body.
[3:04:21] this body which is a sinful body which
[3:04:24] is a tired body a weary body a very bad
[3:04:28] body it always gets in my
[3:04:31] way this body is also here so I am a man
[3:04:37] in this body with with a body but also I
[3:04:40] am God in this body an attribute of God
[3:04:45] in this body okay wait for the beautiful
[3:04:48] part Jesus as a
[3:04:51] when he died. Oh, praise God. God never
[3:04:58] died. The spirit which was in
[3:05:01] him left and then Jesus as a man was on
[3:05:07] the cross
[3:05:11] praying father why have you forsaken me?
[3:05:15] Because the father is God and he cannot
[3:05:19] die.
[3:05:20] Hallelujah. Yes sir. Listen listen. But
[3:05:25] on the third day on the third day that
[3:05:29] spirit came back
[3:05:32] again. Hallelujah. Amen. Came back
[3:05:35] again. And rose
[3:05:37] Jesus from the grave.
[3:05:41] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, sister, it's
[3:05:44] the same thing with
[3:05:45] us. Amen. We who were dead
[3:05:50] in a when his spirit came by his word,
[3:05:54] we rose from the
[3:05:56] dead. And even when the Bible says that
[3:05:59] if that same
[3:06:01] spirit which was Jesus Christ on the day
[3:06:05] if it dwells in
[3:06:08] you if it dwells in you he will
[3:06:13] quicken your mortal
[3:06:17] body your human body he will quicken it
[3:06:21] and one day we are going to walk. people
[3:06:25] will see us but with a body which is
[3:06:29] like
[3:06:32] his. Amen. These are
[3:06:36] scriptures and we shall be like him
[3:06:41] immortal. We will be able to appear and
[3:06:48] disappear. Come on. You have to rejoice
[3:06:52] and hallelujah.
[3:06:56] Amen. It may be said we should reflect
[3:06:58] the attributes of our
[3:07:03] origin. Our life, our words, our way of
[3:07:07] life. This is the ultimate purpose of
[3:07:12] the
[3:07:15] word so that we might become the word.
[3:07:22] Now the Bible says when you vow
[3:07:28] unto God,
[3:07:30] do not fail to pay
[3:07:31] it. God has no pleasure in
[3:07:35] food. Because fools are not his
[3:07:39] attributes. His
[3:07:41] attributes are him.
[3:07:45] So if you are an attribute of
[3:07:46] God, you're going to have a mind like
[3:07:48] that of
[3:07:50] God. You're not a fool. A fool is
[3:07:53] serpent
[3:07:57] seed. Psalms 14. One, the fool has said
[3:08:01] in his
[3:08:02] heart, there is no God. They don't
[3:08:06] believe in the existence of God. The
[3:08:08] Bible says they are
[3:08:09] corrupt. They have done abominable
[3:08:11] works.
[3:08:13] There is none that doeth
[3:08:15] good. They don't believe. But a believer
[3:08:19] is not a
[3:08:21] fool. Hebrews
[3:08:23] 11:6. Without
[3:08:25] faith, it is impossible to please God.
[3:08:29] For he that cometh to
[3:08:31] God must
[3:08:34] believe. Everybody say must
[3:08:37] believe that he
[3:08:40] is and he's a
[3:08:43] rewarder of them that diligently seek. A
[3:08:46] fool does not regard God as
[3:08:49] God. So you will come to God and say God
[3:08:53] give me this and I'll do this and then
[3:08:56] when God gives it to you
[3:08:58] like it's not you gave it to me. with my
[3:09:01] own strength because you don't believe
[3:09:03] in
[3:09:05] God. But the wise, they will honor and
[3:09:08] believe God is not a
[3:09:13] man. They will keep their
[3:09:16] promises. Shall we have some
[3:09:18] examples of the wise? Amen. Hannah, I
[3:09:23] don't have time to read the whole thing.
[3:09:24] I'll read what I can. She vowed to give
[3:09:27] a son to the Lord.
[3:09:30] to service unto the Lord. If God will
[3:09:33] give her a
[3:09:35] child, when someone was born, she took
[3:09:39] him to the temple and dedicated him to
[3:09:42] God as promised. Hannah was
[3:09:49] wise. I wish I had time to read
[3:09:52] everything, but it will take a long
[3:09:54] time. What you do? Go and read for
[3:10:00] chapter
[3:10:01] one, you know, you will see in her in
[3:10:03] the bitterness of her
[3:10:05] soul when she prayed to God and
[3:10:08] we vowed a
[3:10:10] vow and she said, "Lord of us, if you
[3:10:14] will indeed look on my
[3:10:16] affliction and your handmade and
[3:10:19] remember
[3:10:19] me and not forget your handmmaid, but
[3:10:23] will give unto thy handmade a
[3:10:26] child, then I will give him unto the
[3:10:28] Lord.
[3:10:29] all the days of his life there shall no
[3:10:32] raza come upon his
[3:10:35] head. And when the Bible says when she
[3:10:37] weed him, she took him up with her with
[3:10:41] three
[3:10:43] bulocks. She gave she gave more than she
[3:10:49] promised when you said, "God, do this
[3:10:51] for me. I'll take my
[3:10:52] time." And then you bring 10 person
[3:10:59] me. I've already paid my tithe. What are
[3:11:02] they collecting
[3:11:03] now? I already promised my
[3:11:07] part. Don't be rigid with
[3:11:12] God. She she she she she
[3:11:16] gave with three
[3:11:19] bulocks, one air of flour, and a bottle
[3:11:23] of wine.
[3:11:26] [Music]
[3:11:27] And she
[3:11:28] brought for them to have the Lord
[3:11:33] supper and brought him unto the house of
[3:11:36] the
[3:11:36] Lord
[3:11:38] in the child was
[3:11:40] young. And they slew a
[3:11:43] bulock and brought the child to
[3:11:45] Eddie. And she said, "Oh my
[3:11:48] Lord, as thy soul
[3:11:51] liveth, my Lord, I am the woman that
[3:11:54] stood by
[3:11:56] thee, praying unto the Lord, for this
[3:11:59] child I pray, and the Lord has given me
[3:12:03] my
[3:12:04] petition, which I asked of
[3:12:08] him." She remembered the
[3:12:11] Lord and she didn't say, "Now give me
[3:12:14] back my child."
[3:12:15] She left the child
[3:12:18] there. When you give an offering unto
[3:12:21] the
[3:12:22] Lord, you don't have to
[3:12:25] remember it is
[3:12:32] yours. Uh brethren, if you you would
[3:12:34] have given me
[3:12:36] time, I would have said things which
[3:12:38] should have helped
[3:12:40] us. I'm not going to preach for about
[3:12:42] five weeks.
[3:12:45] So would you stay with me for a few more
[3:12:49] moments? When you promise
[3:12:51] God and you give him something, it
[3:12:54] doesn't have to be money. Don't think in
[3:12:56] terms of
[3:12:58] money, it it might be your
[3:13:01] strength, your
[3:13:03] knowledge, your
[3:13:05] ingenuity, your gift, something that you
[3:13:08] you can give to the Lord, your children,
[3:13:12] whatever it is. and you've given it to
[3:13:14] the Lord. Don't come back and demand it.
[3:13:19] Is the Lord
[3:13:21] is the Lord
[3:13:23] is. Hallelujah.
[3:13:26] It's the Lord
[3:13:27] [Music]
[3:13:29] is. You might bring a piano. You might
[3:13:32] bring it's not yours anymore.
[3:13:36] As long as you made a
[3:13:39] vow, keep it. It is the Lord is I am
[3:13:44] broke
[3:13:46] now. Brother Shem the which I have told
[3:13:49] you I've changed my mind. Did you buy
[3:13:53] it? Did the church collect for it?
[3:13:55] Please give it to
[3:13:56] me. You become tough because you are now
[3:14:00] poor.
[3:14:05] Brethren, keep your promises that you
[3:14:08] make to God. God is not a man. God is
[3:14:12] looking for his
[3:14:13] attributes. One, a person, a man, a
[3:14:15] woman who will be like
[3:14:18] God. Keep your word.
[3:14:21] Jacob after his vision at
[3:14:24] Bethl, Jacob vowed that if God protected
[3:14:29] him, he would worship the Lord and give
[3:14:31] a tenth of
[3:14:35] oil. Years
[3:14:37] later, Jacob returns
[3:14:39] to build
[3:14:41] an God honors those who
[3:14:45] remember and fulfill their
[3:14:47] vow after even many years.
[3:14:51] [Music]
[3:14:54] And vowed a vow saying if God will be
[3:14:57] with
[3:14:58] me and will keep me. Remember he was
[3:15:01] going back home and he was fearing his
[3:15:05] brother. But now if God will keep me in
[3:15:09] this way that I go and he will give me
[3:15:12] bread to eat and ramen to put on so that
[3:15:15] I can come to my father's house in
[3:15:17] peace.
[3:15:20] Then shall the Lord be my
[3:15:23] God. This one did not promise a
[3:15:26] child. This one did not promise a child
[3:15:30] like
[3:15:31] Hana. This one, Amen, promised to serve
[3:15:34] the
[3:15:37] Lord. Then the Lord shall be my God. And
[3:15:41] this stone which I have set for a
[3:15:44] Peter shall be God's
[3:15:47] house. And of all that thou shalt give
[3:15:49] me, I will surely give a
[3:15:54] 10. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Pray. Praise
[3:15:58] the Lord. Let's see the fulfillment of
[3:16:00] the
[3:16:01] promise. And God said unto
[3:16:04] Jacob. Genesis 35, arise, go to
[3:16:09] Bessa. Ah, this is the angel of the
[3:16:11] Lord.
[3:16:12] Now, come back. Remind him of the
[3:16:15] promise. God does not forget your
[3:16:20] promises and make thee an altar unto
[3:16:24] God. The God that appeared unto thee
[3:16:26] when you you were fleeing from the face
[3:16:28] of E is thy
[3:16:31] brother. Then Jacob said unto his
[3:16:35] house, leave me
[3:16:38] alone. Now I am
[3:16:41] prospering. Now he's coming back to me.
[3:16:48] What is wrong with you? Leave
[3:16:56] me now. I have a good
[3:16:58] house. Now everybody wants to leave me
[3:17:03] alone. Am I your
[3:17:10] parent? Go back to your
[3:17:13] home. Listen
[3:17:16] brother, forget your promise to
[3:17:19] God, when you didn't have when you were
[3:17:23] poor when you were young, when you were
[3:17:30] in bless me. Now it is time to pay
[3:17:35] back. Then Jacob said unto his household
[3:17:38] and to all that were with him, "Put
[3:17:41] away the strange gods that are among
[3:17:46] you." They had even
[3:17:48] started worshiping other
[3:17:51] gods. Brother Shalom, they had started
[3:17:53] worshiping other
[3:17:55] God. He forgot his
[3:17:59] promise. But when the angel of Lord came
[3:18:02] say, "Please remember your
[3:18:04] promise." He said, "Please my people,
[3:18:07] put away your strange
[3:18:08] God. Be clean and change your garment."
[3:18:14] You see, brother, when God comes down,
[3:18:17] you will know you need to change your
[3:18:19] clothes. Hey, you need to change your
[3:18:23] clothes. You need to put away a strange
[3:18:25] goat. Do you know what else you need to
[3:18:28] do? Listen. And let us
[3:18:31] arise, go up to Bethl, and I will make
[3:18:34] there an altar unto
[3:18:36] God, who answered me in the day of my
[3:18:38] distress, and was with me in the way
[3:18:41] which I
[3:18:43] went. And they gave unto Jacob all the
[3:18:46] strange
[3:18:48] gods which were in their
[3:18:51] hand. Are you hearing me, church? Can I
[3:18:54] hear amen from sisters?
[3:18:57] and all their
[3:19:01] hearings which were in their ears.
[3:19:07] I did not know it was a strange
[3:19:09] god. Hallelujah. My
[3:19:12] sisters. That's why we don't wear
[3:19:15] them. And they gave unto Jacob the
[3:19:19] earrings which were in the ears. And
[3:19:22] Jacob hid them and the oak which was by
[3:19:24] the
[3:19:27] And they journeyed and the terror of of
[3:19:29] of God was upon the cities that were
[3:19:31] around about
[3:19:35] them and they did not pursue after the
[3:19:38] sons of
[3:19:41] Jacob, brethren, can I prophesy to you?
[3:19:45] If you give away all the strange
[3:19:48] gods, God will bring the fear of the
[3:19:51] Lord, the terror of the Lord,
[3:19:56] upon your
[3:19:57] enemy that are around about
[3:20:00] you and they will not be able to attack
[3:20:04] you. Amen. Give up your strange
[3:20:08] God. So Jacob came to
[3:20:11] lose which is in the land of Canaan and
[3:20:14] Bethl. And he and all the people that
[3:20:16] were with him and he built there an
[3:20:20] altar and called a place El Bethl.
[3:20:25] Because there God appeared unto
[3:20:27] him when he fled from the face of his
[3:20:30] father. Jacob kept his
[3:20:33] promise. Can I give you another
[3:20:38] one in the book of Judges 11? It speaks
[3:20:41] about he vowed to offer something as a
[3:20:44] burnt
[3:20:47] offering whatever came to him first when
[3:20:50] he arrives home.
[3:20:54] If he wins in
[3:21:01] battle, brethren, are you in a
[3:21:05] battle? Any battle in your life. God can
[3:21:09] fight your
[3:21:11] battle. He will give you strength to go
[3:21:14] through your
[3:21:15] battle. He will not give
[3:21:18] up. I am not speaking idle words. Those
[3:21:23] are prophetic
[3:21:24] words. I said you will not give up. You
[3:21:28] will
[3:21:29] overcome. Amen. Amen. If you trust in
[3:21:32] the Lord with all your but
[3:21:37] remember you vow to
[3:21:40] God, he will keep his word. Oh God, do
[3:21:47] something for me to overcome my
[3:21:51] enemies. If you do, I will do this for
[3:21:54] you. By the way, those kind of prayers
[3:21:56] are answered right
[3:22:01] now. If you're praying for something and
[3:22:03] is not
[3:22:04] working, pray like
[3:22:08] that. Sorry those who are
[3:22:11] streaming, this portion is for my
[3:22:13] church.
[3:22:15] Pray like
[3:22:17] that. Something you're praying it's not
[3:22:20] working. Make a promise to
[3:22:22] God. I don't want others to
[3:22:25] hear. Make a promise to
[3:22:27] God. Tell God, do this thing for me.
[3:22:32] Here is what I want to
[3:22:33] do. Some of you, you make small
[3:22:37] promises. You want big
[3:22:39] things. You are not having good hearts.
[3:22:46] God give me land and house of my own.
[3:22:49] I'll give church, land
[3:22:52] fund 500,000
[3:22:55] sheep. He has given you a house and
[3:23:01] land. If you want big things from
[3:23:05] God, you should be ready to surrender
[3:23:07] everything you
[3:23:10] want and everything you have.
[3:23:14] When we talk about making
[3:23:17] promises, remember this is not only
[3:23:19] physical
[3:23:21] things. I'm giving a few examples for
[3:23:24] you to see. Some people were promising
[3:23:27] physical things. Others were promising
[3:23:29] spiritual things. But
[3:23:32] nonetheless, God
[3:23:34] answered and they were supposed to keep
[3:23:36] their
[3:23:37] vow because remember you a son of God an
[3:23:41] attribute of God.
[3:23:43] Amen.
[3:23:45] So Jeff
[3:23:46] went because of time I will not read
[3:23:48] that portion but you know when he
[3:23:52] prayed you know the first when he
[3:23:54] reached home after winning the battle
[3:23:58] the first thing that
[3:24:00] came before him was his beautiful
[3:24:06] daughter and he
[3:24:09] cried my
[3:24:12] [Music]
[3:24:14] I want you to see. And just came to
[3:24:17] Misipe into the house, his house. And
[3:24:20] all his daughter came to meet
[3:24:23] him with a
[3:24:25] timbros and with
[3:24:27] dancing. Oh daddy, you are back. Oh
[3:24:31] daddy, you have defeated your
[3:24:33] enemy. And she was his only
[3:24:37] child. beside
[3:24:39] her. He had neither son nor
[3:24:45] daughter. And it came to pass when he
[3:24:48] saw her that he rent his
[3:24:51] glory. And he said, "Alas, my
[3:24:56] daughter, thou has brought me very
[3:25:00] low, and you are one of them that
[3:25:02] trouble
[3:25:04] me. For I have opened my mouth unto the
[3:25:07] Lord.
[3:25:09] and I cannot go
[3:25:12] back. Do you see that kind of
[3:25:15] heart? He didn't say God. Surely you
[3:25:19] understand, brother. When you open your
[3:25:22] mouth to
[3:25:24] pray and you promise God
[3:25:27] anything, fulfill
[3:25:31] it regardless of what it
[3:25:34] takes. And this teaches us don't promise
[3:25:38] what you know in the integrity of your
[3:25:40] heart you cannot do.
[3:25:42] [Music]
[3:25:47] He promised anything the first
[3:25:51] thing and God said that's what you have
[3:25:53] said. All right. He made him
[3:25:57] overcome and now his child comes. God
[3:26:01] did not require this
[3:26:03] child. There is no scripture which says
[3:26:05] God has ever required human sacrifice.
[3:26:10] This was a man for when he sacrificed
[3:26:13] his
[3:26:14] daughter. He was a man fulfilling his
[3:26:17] vow to God, not God requiring human
[3:26:24] sacrifice. Are you hearing me? So be
[3:26:27] sure when you promise, promise what you
[3:26:30] are able to
[3:26:32] do. Praise the name of the Lord.
[3:26:38] Oh, this reminds me. Shem was saying,
[3:26:40] "Oh, when I was going to die and then I
[3:26:42] promised God things you told us,
[3:26:45] brother." I don't remember all the all
[3:26:47] your
[3:26:47] promises, but that's a good one for you
[3:26:50] [Music]
[3:26:51] today. David, David vowed not to
[3:26:56] rest until he found a dwelling place for
[3:26:58] the Lord.
[3:27:01] Though David wasn't allowed to build a
[3:27:04] temple, he gathered
[3:27:06] materials and he made
[3:27:08] plans and his son Solomon completed
[3:27:12] that. But you will see that David
[3:27:14] fulfilled his
[3:27:15] promise. He didn't say you have rejected
[3:27:19] me. He kept on doing what he wanted. He
[3:27:23] never rested until the Lord had a house.
[3:27:28] Paul made another vow which included
[3:27:32] shaving his
[3:27:33] head and abstaining from certain
[3:27:37] things. Paul fulfilled his
[3:27:40] vows. I wish I had time to go into the
[3:27:42] details but because of time I'm not
[3:27:44] rushing. Now I rushed because I wanted
[3:27:47] to read a story for
[3:27:50] you. Brother
[3:27:52] Brana this story is
[3:27:55] amazing. So brother Bham also made a
[3:27:58] vow. So this is not only old testament
[3:28:01] thing, it is even new
[3:28:03] testament. Can we read the story in the
[3:28:06] message testimony
[3:28:08] 1963? He says I made a vow to
[3:28:11] go a few years ago going out with a full
[3:28:14] gospel
[3:28:16] businessman. I said I wouldn't shoot
[3:28:20] game for somebody
[3:28:26] else. Game the white
[3:28:30] people. I think mostly the white
[3:28:33] people. They have what we call
[3:28:35] game. Here in Africa, you know, we know
[3:28:39] hunting. You know, when we go hunting,
[3:28:42] we are hunting what we are going to
[3:28:44] eat. We we hunt for meat.
[3:28:47] But in the
[3:28:49] west many call it game because it's like
[3:28:51] a
[3:28:53] game because they go hunting,
[3:28:56] shooting, they'll take an animal and
[3:29:00] kill it and remove the head and put it
[3:29:04] in the house and many of them won't even
[3:29:06] use the
[3:29:07] meat. So really it's like
[3:29:11] murder if you want to call it that way.
[3:29:14] So brother Bam was a very good handler.
[3:29:18] And brother Bham, you know, was doing
[3:29:19] also like uh he he is now saying he made
[3:29:22] a promise, a
[3:29:24] vow that he will not shoot
[3:29:28] again for Yes. for somebody
[3:29:32] else or is he shooting or he's killing
[3:29:35] an animal for someone
[3:29:37] else? No. Unless it is an
[3:29:40] emergency. He said, I will not do it. He
[3:29:44] made that vow.
[3:29:46] So he says and and and he was with some
[3:29:49] brothers. They went hunting in the
[3:29:50] island. They were
[3:29:52] somewhere about I think three or four.
[3:29:54] Well, I'll just read them for you. And
[3:29:56] it's brother Jack Palmer is here.
[3:29:58] Brother Jack, he was from Georgia. He
[3:30:00] usually come up here. He was standing
[3:30:01] here and the night before he said,
[3:30:02] "Brother Bam, get me a deer."
[3:30:10] You know, brother Bam was a very good
[3:30:12] hunter and my just shook because I I had
[3:30:15] vowed I wouldn't do
[3:30:18] that four or five years ago because that
[3:30:22] year I killed 19 head of
[3:30:26] elk
[3:30:28] alone just for them businessmen who sit
[3:30:31] around and talk their business.
[3:30:36] and I would have to go out and kill
[3:30:38] their
[3:30:40] game. And that just didn't seem like it
[3:30:43] put me in a murder
[3:30:50] case. But I wouldn't do it. I would take
[3:30:54] them to where it's at, but I wouldn't
[3:30:56] shoot
[3:30:58] it. So I promised God I wouldn't do it.
[3:31:03] So then I had got I left the place going
[3:31:05] back starting uh started back down the
[3:31:08] hill and and the voice spoke to
[3:31:13] me. Why not walk with
[3:31:17] me? So as he's in the
[3:31:20] woods and that voice of God speaks to
[3:31:23] me, why not walk with
[3:31:26] me? Okay, I'm going to speak a little
[3:31:28] bit. I skip and find meat, two full
[3:31:31] grown phones and a big boy
[3:31:35] came and something said to me, "There is
[3:31:38] a deer for brother
[3:31:41] Evans, one for
[3:31:43] brother and one for the other
[3:31:46] Methodist. There is exactly what the
[3:31:49] Lord has given to you for
[3:31:54] now. Killed them for them. They can't
[3:31:56] get away those animals. There is no way
[3:31:59] for them to. I had a rifle hanging down
[3:32:02] on my shoulder right
[3:32:05] there. Praise the name of the Lord. And
[3:32:08] before they could even go turned around,
[3:32:11] I would have killed I would have killed
[3:32:13] three of
[3:32:15] them. Before they could even move, they
[3:32:19] was right in my hand.
[3:32:21] And I thought, "Ah, there they are. Just
[3:32:24] the three. easy to roll them right down
[3:32:26] the hill and to them right on on out.
[3:32:31] And I thought that will be very easy.
[3:32:34] There is the
[3:32:35] three then we could go home from
[3:32:39] there. Take out and get out of the
[3:32:42] mountains. And as I looked at them
[3:32:44] there, they were standing looking at
[3:32:47] me just as
[3:32:49] quietly about 15
[3:32:53] yards. I just stood still and they
[3:32:56] watched me. I thought, well, there it
[3:32:59] is. The only thing is just throw your
[3:33:03] rifle over and they are
[3:33:07] gone. And then I remembered I promised
[3:33:10] God. I wouldn't do it. And I remember
[3:33:14] that I thought no, I can't do
[3:33:17] it. That isn't right. I promised God
[3:33:20] that I wouldn't do it.
[3:33:23] And he says that when you make a
[3:33:26] promise, you stay with
[3:33:28] it. God expects you
[3:33:31] to I thought well just perfect in my
[3:33:34] hands but yet I promised him I wouldn't
[3:33:36] do
[3:33:38] it. I said I said go on mother take your
[3:33:41] babies and go into the
[3:33:43] woods. Enjoy
[3:33:45] yourself. I love
[3:33:53] this roast. He couldn't kill
[3:33:55] them. And they come a little closer.
[3:33:59] Oh, how unusual that is for that
[3:34:08] dear. And they would look at
[3:34:11] me and turn their head and me standing
[3:34:15] there.
[3:34:16] dressed in red with a rifle standing in
[3:34:18] my hand and they walked real close. I
[3:34:22] could feed them out of my
[3:34:24] arm and they just nosed around
[3:34:27] there a few moments, turned
[3:34:32] around, walked on a back a little piece.
[3:34:36] They stopped come back again. Something
[3:34:39] kept saying, "They are right in your
[3:34:41] hand. They are right in your hand. The
[3:34:44] Lord has put them in your hand. I said,
[3:34:48] but I
[3:34:50] promise. I promise that I wouldn't do
[3:34:53] it. Since then, I
[3:34:56] thought one time David was led right
[3:34:58] into the very side where Job was laying.
[3:35:00] Well, rather King Saul was
[3:35:04] laying. And Job said to him, said, "The
[3:35:07] Lord, I'll deliver him into your hand."
[3:35:11] But he said, "God forbid that I would
[3:35:13] touch his
[3:35:15] anointing." And he says, "The prophet,
[3:35:17] you must wash when you make a
[3:35:20] promise." And then I said, "I promised
[3:35:23] God that I wouldn't do it, so I
[3:35:28] won't." Even as small as a small thing
[3:35:30] as a
[3:35:32] dear. Yes.
[3:35:34] Whatever you promise to God, however
[3:35:36] small,
[3:35:38] however, a man is as good as his
[3:35:42] word. Let me now try to bring this to a
[3:35:45] close. A man is just as good as his
[3:35:47] word, musicians can
[3:35:50] go. You are just as good as your
[3:35:53] word. I am just as good as my
[3:35:56] word. If I can't take your
[3:35:59] word, I want no dealings with you.
[3:36:03] I want you to be the same to
[3:36:05] me and you must be the same to
[3:36:08] God. If you can't keep his
[3:36:11] word, then I want to know who is
[3:36:15] God that can keep his
[3:36:18] word. Brethren, where are the
[3:36:22] musicians? Please
[3:36:23] come. Let me say this.
[3:36:27] Many times as
[3:36:29] believers, we speak idle
[3:36:31] words, things we don't
[3:36:34] mean and we say it
[3:36:37] now. And remember you are a
[3:36:40] Christian. Look at me here. Remember you
[3:36:43] were a
[3:36:44] believer. And when you give your
[3:36:47] word, someone should be able to cash it
[3:36:50] in.
[3:36:56] Are you hearing me? Those in the back,
[3:36:59] are you hearing
[3:37:00] me? Your word must be good
[3:37:05] enough. Don't give your
[3:37:07] word if you can't keep
[3:37:11] it. Your word must be good as
[3:37:15] yourself. If you give your word and you
[3:37:19] don't keep it, you are as good as your
[3:37:21] word.
[3:37:23] Imagine if God would give us his
[3:37:27] word and then here prophecy
[3:37:30] comes. Sorry my children, I made a
[3:37:34] mistake but next time I'll do
[3:37:37] better. Who will trust God
[3:37:41] again? When God gives his
[3:37:44] word, he keeps it because as good as his
[3:37:49] word, all his promises
[3:37:53] We must also who are in the image of
[3:37:58] God, attributes of God, be able to keep
[3:38:02] every promise we make to God and to one
[3:38:12] another. God's word will never
[3:38:15] fail. It fails then God can
[3:38:19] fail. Cuz no man is any better than his
[3:38:23] word. Tell your neighbor you are not
[3:38:26] better than your
[3:38:27] [Music]
[3:38:29] wife. Hey you sisters and brothers who
[3:38:32] are very good at saying borrow
[3:38:36] me. I will pay you next
[3:38:40] week. Are you here today?
[3:38:43] If you are here, can you say amen?
[3:38:49] Let me talk to you. Borrow me. I'll pay
[3:38:52] you next
[3:38:54] week. When? Next week.
[3:38:57] On on
[3:38:59] Friday. Friday morning around
[3:39:02] there. First of all, you know, on Friday
[3:39:06] next week, you don't have any
[3:39:07] expectation to
[3:39:11] pay. That's a lie. You are lying right
[3:39:14] there before that
[3:39:16] brother and that shows who you
[3:39:19] are. And I want to ask you, are you a
[3:39:23] fool or you are a child of God or you
[3:39:27] are an attribute of
[3:39:29] God? But if you can't pay on
[3:39:31] Friday, call up the brother. Tell him,
[3:39:35] "I'm sorry. It looks like I won't be
[3:39:37] able to pay
[3:39:38] on. Can we push it ahead?
[3:39:43] Don't wait for him to call you. But some
[3:39:45] of you
[3:39:47] brethren, a brother will call you and
[3:39:50] call you and call you until you begin
[3:39:53] even abusing him. What's wrong with this
[3:39:56] one? And they will call you and you
[3:39:58] refuse to
[3:39:59] pick. You refuse to pick
[3:40:02] up when you borrow the
[3:40:05] money. I believe of the
[3:40:08] message. Shame on you, brother, sister.
[3:40:15] and you wound somebody, you hurt
[3:40:19] somebody, they will call you, refuse to
[3:40:22] pick up, then you come to church on
[3:40:27] Sunday and when it comes time to
[3:40:31] greeting, if the deacon puts you close
[3:40:33] to that,
[3:40:38] can you change me?
[3:40:44] And then after service, no one will even
[3:40:48] see. You will take off like a
[3:40:53] hair because you know you have
[3:40:57] debts. You should repent
[3:41:00] today. If any of you have anyone's
[3:41:05] debt and you refuse to
[3:41:08] pay, go back and apologize to
[3:41:11] them. Amen. And I can tell you if you
[3:41:15] don't have the money to
[3:41:17] pay, you can promise God
[3:41:21] also God provide this
[3:41:24] money. I will do this for
[3:41:28] you. But with God
[3:41:32] fulfill he will give you the money. I
[3:41:35] remember let me tell you this testimony
[3:41:37] as I'm finishing the pis can play
[3:41:42] slowly. One time I went to
[3:41:45] China and I I ministered a few places. I
[3:41:49] really had a heart to help people.
[3:41:51] all the funds I was given. I bought a
[3:41:54] church
[3:41:56] projector in Mana which actually still
[3:41:59] even I bought clothes for children and
[3:42:02] everything. I spent all the money that I
[3:42:05] was given by friends and brothers love
[3:42:07] offerings spent all the
[3:42:10] money. So I came back home with a bag of
[3:42:14] clothes
[3:42:16] and so we distributed everything. After
[3:42:19] that we began suffering
[3:42:23] seriously
[3:42:25] seriously. I've told this story to some
[3:42:27] of
[3:42:28] you
[3:42:30] financially suffering seriously.
[3:42:34] My wife called me. I said, "Dear,
[3:42:36] there's something wrong. Marry a
[3:42:38] spiritual woman by the
[3:42:40] way." And sister, be spiritual to
[3:42:43] [Music]
[3:42:46] your
[3:42:47] dear. The money you bought this
[3:42:51] thing. Where did you get it? I
[3:42:55] explain. Did you tithe
[3:42:58] it before
[3:43:00] [Music]
[3:43:02] you? Honestly, it had skipped my
[3:43:07] mind. I told her I did
[3:43:11] not right there. We knew why we are
[3:43:16] suffering. We took hands together
[3:43:19] without wasting time. God told me, "What
[3:43:21] should we do?" I said, "For sure." Okay,
[3:43:25] I don't know. And while I was there, the
[3:43:27] Holy Ghost came to me and told me pray.
[3:43:32] So I held my hands. I said, "Let us
[3:43:34] pray." I repented to God. I repented
[3:43:38] bitterly. God, I'm sorry. I did not pay
[3:43:41] tithe out of this. It was not
[3:43:45] intentional. It is in my heart to do it.
[3:43:48] But Lord, I don't know how I didn't even
[3:43:52] have any job at the time. I don't know
[3:43:54] how. I don't know where. But provide
[3:43:59] supernatural more fun. And then what I
[3:44:02] will do, I
[3:44:03] promise I will take the a portion out of
[3:44:07] it and pay the tithe I did not
[3:44:10] pay. Plus, I will pay also tithe of that
[3:44:15] one. And I promise from today, I'll
[3:44:18] never
[3:44:20] default. I will always pay my tithe.
[3:44:23] [Music]
[3:44:25] Brethren, we said
[3:44:27] amen. In a few days, I think about three
[3:44:30] days, a brother, I don't know who it was
[3:44:33] at the moment. I was even going to
[3:44:35] another
[3:44:36] mission. Just saw on my
[3:44:39] messages. He sent me a love
[3:44:42] offering. He said, "Brother B,
[3:44:45] you the Holy Spirit has instructed me."
[3:44:49] Those were the specific words. My wife,
[3:44:50] I'm sure you remember them. has
[3:44:52] instructed me to send this funds to
[3:44:56] you. I nearly broke
[3:44:59] down when I looked at this money. It
[3:45:03] could pay all the other
[3:45:05] time pay this time and remain with
[3:45:09] someone. But the more I was going to
[3:45:11] remain
[3:45:12] with was the smallest
[3:45:16] portion and I had other
[3:45:20] problems. Immediately the devil told me
[3:45:24] of course God knows the situation you
[3:45:26] in paid this life and this will pay in
[3:45:30] the
[3:45:30] future. I told him devil get
[3:45:35] behind. That day the pastor saw me
[3:45:38] coming with a big envelope.
[3:45:41] Say pastor this is my
[3:45:43] tithe your tithe you know when your
[3:45:46] pastor asks you
[3:45:48] that he's wondering do you earn this
[3:45:53] much sometimes we ask cuz we don't want
[3:45:56] to take tithe from bad you get money in
[3:45:59] a in dubious
[3:46:03] means brother Elijah paying 2 million
[3:46:12] You
[3:46:13] understand? But I
[3:46:16] explained pray for me. You don't know
[3:46:20] how I
[3:46:20] felt. Ever since then, I've never I've
[3:46:24] I've kept my
[3:46:26] vow. Brethren, God is God. God is not a
[3:46:33] man. We should keep our promises.
[3:46:40] [Music]
[3:46:41] Praise
[3:46:42] [Music]
[3:46:46] God. There are many more things I might
[3:46:49] say, but allow me to stop
[3:46:53] here. I trust that you got something to
[3:47:00] bless. Amen. Shall we stand?
