[Music] and I'm reading in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] when Jesus came into the costs of kaiseria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiahs or one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto them blessed are thou Simon but Jonah for flesh and blood as we not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will rebuild my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and also whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be loose in heaven then charged he is the disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ summer [Music] [Music] foreign it's now this evening as usual when I'm ministering to uh the Saints on Zoom we do not go more than one hour [Music] if I I don't get done with the subject we shall carry on on Sunday the Lord willing on the power of Revelation the power of Revelation so there is a power of Revelation so in this in this scripture here Jesus asks the disciples a question and he said who do you say who do people say that I the son of man um and so they said some say your John some say you're Elijah some say you're Jeremiah or one of the prophets but then he said what about you this is what they call me what about you what do you call me who do you say that I am and remember that these people had been with Jesus for almost three years now but many of them did not know who he was not that they did not know who he was as a man they knew he was Jesus the son of Joseph the son of Mary yes but that was common knowledge but you see there was something that was needed more than that common knowledge and I'm telling you there is always power in Revelation when you receive the Revelation or a revelation about something usually something is about to happen when you were in the middle of a breakthrough and you don't have Revelation about what is happening you will always miss your visitation because you have no Revelation and so these people knew that he was Jesus and they knew that he was a Jew and they knew that he was a good man they knew he was a good teacher but maybe none of them had a revelation something that that he only and God knew yeah and maybe others also because many of them were saying it's just one of the prophets and that was true Jesus was one of the prophets they said maybe others to the ex and they said maybe it's Elijah because the things that Jesus was doing was exactly in the line of the other prophet and if you know the scriptures Jesus is the son of man me in the son of man Ministries was a prophet because he as uh as God he manifests himself in three offices of a son of a son [Music] [Music] salvation will be finished let me tell you salvation is only going to be on the earth when God is still as a son of [Music] and Jesus all right now verse 16. and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Christ that Revelations Peter spoke a higher Revelation Peter said yes yes you are the Christ himself Jesus was God in flesh yes that was a revelation which came from God but God revealed it to him [Applause] was Peter foreign so when they when the Catholics sovereign was the pastor of the Church of which I am a member we are in the church where Peter was we believe the same message Peter believed so if Peter was a Catholic which means we are the best Catholic but they are not possible because they fell away from the truth the gospel and Peter preached again and the Protestants they say that oh no it wasn't Peter The Rock was Jesus because you know Jesus is a rock um Peter was there rather Jesus was the rock yes where he built his own church but then the prophet of Our Generation God gave him a higher Revelation I said thank God for Revelation yeah who Jesus was always if you understand it say amen hallelujah [ __ ] Jesus told Peter yes flesh and blood has not revealed this to you my Father in Heaven has revealed revealed my father's revealed my father's revealed to you who I am and Upon This Rock meaning abundance [Applause] God himself foreign the revelation when you have that relationship about anything you are sure to Victory now the scripture in Hebrews 11 6 says without faith that is meaning to please God cannot be pleased if you don't have [Applause] [Applause] the possess our faith [Music] teaching of some system now thank you when we say Peter what did Peter received Peter received Revelations what was that that was faith you get it who are you you're a human being can you prove it foreign [Applause] [Music] you ever have faith it is given to you by the grace of God foreign foreign foreign by the word of God it could be a Muslim Obama it could be a Catholic I don't care what religion if they they receive revelation of that scripture you may be a message that brings coins in the church [Applause] and yet you have enough you are the kind women that thinks about yourself only you are the kind that feels even want to give ties you are giving your money you have no Revelation that is a blessing there is a blessing let me tell you all you need is spiritual Revelation when you receive that Revelation I must leave you know not as though I am poor but as though as I have Siri the Bible says listen to me they buy the scripture tells us we shall beheads can you say Amen to that gamma Amina foreign he says we shall learn to again that is scriptures you can read it all the days of your life and still live a defeated life if it is somebody who gives with Revelation you will even see them they keep cheer free a wire the Bible says God loves a cheerful Giver not giving oh he has taken my sins they're telling us to support someone but a very poor person and you'll find a Muslim out there practicing the law of God foreign it is because of lack of Revelations God promised to bless you God promise to increase this is a spiritual promise and it is a spiritual law the only thing you need is to tap into it by revelations you are now why do people listen why do people after them I want to make use of it why do people foreign they pay a lot of cash buy wire sentence and then the man anoints them with oil that's the power so-called holy water on them how does they feel I think I am under a curse that's why I am sick that's why I'm like this let me go to a man of God who has special anointed let him touch me it is lack of Revelation you don't need to pay your money go for someone to break a cast don't just look at me if you're believing what I'm saying say Amen to the world foreign is there a sickness he cannot heal worry you can heal diabetes HIV you can you can heal madness he can heal all this sicknesses are you hearing me how many believe that here our God can do that our God can deliver people but why do we still love people take advantage of others and what the Bible says there shall be many false prophets is revelation you can even come and I pray for you and you go back not die you don't get well know that another person comes they pray for you you go back not die and they are not well another person it doesn't matter who prays for you it is your Revelation is your faith you understand faith is a revelation where you receive a revelation Hallelujah but when I go there to another game and they pray for me and I say I am going to be well it is finished till it is done let me tell you when you come and they pray for you it will be finished because you have the same Revelation that woman because the other blood issue what did she receive yes nobody told her go and touch the hymn of Jesus but you can say something what was that Sam it was revelation is a Hallelujah she could not see that something she could not feel that something but something told her you go to Jesus you break and you fight yourself away through to him she was convinced she was like crazy she was like losing her mind to talk to somebody somebody would have told her yeah even if you try how can you reach where he is and then finally my ears is [Music] [Laughter] foreign he has no faith that he's going to make it no Revelation he has no inspiration what is he going to do he will win it this woman if she didn't have what she had enough even if jesus carried her yes it would mean nothing again if I could buttered I would be free yeah [Music] that was the moment we make you do things if you believe it faith will make you do that okay myself boom the blood is what happened to you something happened amen revelation foreign God is able to change overcome this is the Bible something is going to happen by Revelation you won't even sit like as if you were dead when the word of God foreign everybody said the scripture with me foreign foreign you don't even fight a Woman by a dream you don't find a Woman by reading the scripture when you find a Woman by revelation what is revealed to you when I pray when I go to church the pastor is going to tell me exactly where she is a revelation I said to myself in my Heart by Revelation when I speak to this guy yes and when I spoke to her but now again I spoke to her curiously I didn't I didn't you know young men of these days they just go there they begin to put out a very expensive city back again the neighbor neighbor you see me I'm done with my degree he's in so many degree I even have a motorcycle I even have a car foreign lack of Revelation how does revelation somebody help me Faith cometh by fearing this is subject yourself to the world hear what God is saying whatever God I said whatever you need Hallelujah Man by Revelation you can say in five years I'm going to be earning 5 million foreign Hallelujah man when we were fellowshipping in the church there but to add it to church every day some of you you remember I was about Isaac yes I spoke to them and said God has laid a revelation there must be a church in this area nobody told me what to do it was a revolution why is it here now it was Revelation
