We appreciate you and we thank you Lord. We are grateful father to know that it's all about you my father. It's all about you my father. And that is why this morning we come, laying aside every weight and every casting down every imagination and high thing that exalted itself against the name of God. This morning we come to worship you and to praise to dedicate ourselves unto you once again to give you thanks heavenly father for you are our God we surrender all things unto you praying that heavenly father you'll move in this service you'll touch every heart you'll answer every prayer you'll grant every request And each one of us, Father, will have an experience of the power of God. Lord Jesus, we know that right in your presence, mountains can be shaken. Lord, rivers can be able to part. Lord, we can experience the miraculous God right in our midst. We look away to Jesus this morning. Lord, not on our problems, not on our situations, but by eyes of faith. We look at the written word of God and apply it in our lives. And Lord, even as we come to the most important part of the service, the reading of your word and the ministration thereof, we pray that father the anointing of the Holy Spirit will move in this building. Lord, let your holy spirit, let your glory fill this temple once again. We surrender ourselves unto you, praying that you have your own way. We remember our pastor Lord overseas for miss ministry. May you be with him, Father. And as I stand in the gap for him, Father, I pray, dear, Lord Jesus, that you may give me grace, Lord, to rally behind the vision that you've given to the man of God. And as I put my hands on the wheel, push this cut a little farther. May all the glory and honor go back unto thee. For this we pray &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can take your seats for a moment. Indeed, what a manner of man is Jesus. That is a question this morning. And I believe you have the answer. What has he done for you? What he has done for you? That is the kind of man that he praise the name of the Lord Jesus. I greet you all once again. In the lovely and precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ, thanking God for yet another opportunity to be standing before you. I'm happy to see you. Are you happy this morning? We thank God. He has been gracious indeed. uh down in Kenya, we are still fighting the good fight of faith and we know we have overcome regardless of how the devil fights. When sickness comes, we are more than conquerors to our precious brother. No, it is just a battle. But I have overcome. So do not be afraid. Do not look at the hands and start feeling sorry for me. I didn't come for your pity. I came to lift up the name of God. So let us not focus on other things. We are here for the word. And you know I just want to appreciate the pastor in absentia for this opportunity to stand before you. And I also want to appreciate you as well for the love. I believe if you also didn't want me to come I wouldn't have made it here. You would have told your pastor pastor never invite that young man again. And I believe your pastor would have listened. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. But to show that I've come again, I believe it's your prayers. And here we are. Are you prayed up for the service? We appreciate all the men of God, the church officers, the trustees and the deacons, you know, all of them standing at their post of duty. You know, as I was saying, mine is just to come put my hands and you know, and push this wheel a little bit further just to come and support the ministry that you do. I follow your services and indeed you have very wonderful men of God that labor to feed you spiritual good in due season. And you know, I'm just here to just, you know, go on, brother. Keep on, keep on just to come and support. I received greetings from back home. Uh brethren from church sent me with greetings. Few that knew I was coming this way. Brother Paulo, &gt;&gt; brother Isaac &gt;&gt; and so many of them and they send their love. My family as well, they also send their greetings and I believe that you receive them. Are you happy? Can you now get into business? Can we get into the word? Why don't you just sing this song? I just have a thought that the Lord placed in my heart. I've I've preached on it back home, took a couple of services on it. Uh but I trust that God will help me today to condense all of them into one. So if you're expecting something, I want to tell you in the right place because it's going to be power, not because of me. But because it is the word, I can say a million words. But one word from the Lord will be more than enough. And we shall be opening our Bibles. You'll have to forgive me today. I don't know if some of you know me as a lengthy preacher. Sorry to disappoint. Today we are going to read an entire book. Okay, the amens are very few there. &gt;&gt; Today we are going to read an entire book. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you for not being Ugandans today. Uganda. You know I was told Ugandans are like mud. When it rains they don't come to church. Mad. Mad. Because when it rains and they're coming to church, they can, you know, they can melt. That is what I was told about Ugandans. I don't know how true it is. But I'm just saying thank you for not being Uganda. You are Christians and that is why you're in church. And we are going to read an entire book of the Bible. Brother Shalom, help us sing that song. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I'm going to speak from a slave to a son from a slave to a son. And the book we are going to read is the book of filmon. &gt;&gt; Do not worry. It is just one [music] chapter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. [singing] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. I want you to identify with a song, [singing] not just plain on words, [music] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your conditions and circumstances. Because this morning, I want us to go head on against the devil. &gt;&gt; [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I am [singing] a child of God. &gt;&gt; You unravel me. [singing] You travel me [music] with a meloy. Oh, you [singing] surround [music] me with a song. It's a new song indeed. &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away &gt;&gt; and all things have become new. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be not afraid. in his hand. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Fear not. [music] &gt;&gt; I am. I am. I am a child of God. [music] [singing] I'm no longer I'm no longer a slave to fear. [music and singing] Oh yes, I am a child [music and singing] of God from my mother's womb. You have [singing and music] chosen me. You are chosen in Christ even before the foundation of the world. my [singing and music] name. &gt;&gt; Have you had the new birth experience? &gt;&gt; Have you been born again &gt;&gt; into this family? [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. your love. Your blood flow through my ve [music] I'm no [singing] longer I'm no longer a slave [singing] to fear. No longer slave to fear. &gt;&gt; No longer slave to sin. &gt;&gt; No longer slave to the world. &gt;&gt; All shackles are broken. Jesus breaks EVERY PATTER. &gt;&gt; I'M NO LONGER SLAVE. [music] HALLELUJAH. [singing] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I [singing] am a child. One more time. [music] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer I'm no longer [singing] a slave to fear. [music] I am I am &gt;&gt; I am a child of [music and singing] God. &gt;&gt; The book of Filimon, [music] a very small portion of scripture but carries such a weight and a death. uh it's just after Titus and just before Hebrews. So I'm going to read the first verse. and you will read the second. Forgive my English. There are those who say it is not filon but it is phimon. &gt;&gt; So forgive my unarned English. We are going to go with filon today. Paul &gt;&gt; a prisoner of Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother and to Philon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer. I don't know if it's okay if I read the first verse and then read the second verse. Yes. So I'll read the first verse and then you read the second. So over to you. Grace to you and peace from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus and toward all saints. for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother Yet for love's sake, I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also as a prisoner of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me. whom I would have retained with me, that in thy state he might have ministered unto me in the bones of the gospel. for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should receive him forever. &gt;&gt; To thee both in the &gt;&gt; If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. I have written it with mine own hand. I will repay it. I be it. I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides thee. &gt;&gt; Having confidence in thy obedience, I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I see. There salute thee Aperas, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. And the church says, &gt;&gt; amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; as we stand here together with my brother, Lord, as [clears throat] vessels that you are to use today, we surrender ourselves to you. Any man can read the Bible and flip through the pages. But it's only the lamb that can take the book, break the seals thereof, and Lord, reveal the content. Lord, may you come down with an open book for we know the Bible has become a new book. Reveal yourself unto us, Father. We surrender all things unto thee. For this we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You can take your seats. Uh I've already given my text from a slave to a son. I'm just trusting the Lord to give me grace. I just arrived early this morning. Uh, brother Shem was gracious enough to come and pick me. We were getting to the house a few minutes past 4. So, we've really had some sleep, but we trusting God for strength to be able to preach the word in. So, God bless you so much. And for a a maybe a context to give it a little bit of a context, I want to use these words. Grace. Grace that rewrites our story. Grace that rewrites our story. Now, there's a special kind of people I want to deal with today. You know, I'm not trying to scare people or something, but I believe by the grace of God, knowing that I'm standing behind the sacrament desk, I want to deal with a group of people today. I want to deal with people that are struggling with guilt and shame. So, if you're one of those people, I want you to know that this is your son. And I want you to pay close attention because God sends inspirations our way. And if I can start putting it like this, you are in the wrong place if you just come to church because it's a Sunday. I want to tell you for sure this message we believe IS ALIVE. GOD SENDS inspirations our way FOR A PURPOSE. WHEN GOD'S WHEN GOD ANOINTS HIS SON WITH A special message, it can COME TO DELIVER PEOPLE. IT COMES SO that people can be set free. IT CAN COME SO that people can be BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. IT CAN COME SO THAT people can be filled with the Holy Ghost again. It can come for PEOPLE TO BE REVIVED. SO WAR unto you and me if WE FAIL TO CATCH WHAT GOD IS DOING IN THAT PARTICULAR TIME. REMEMBER THERE WAS A POOL AT Bethesda at BETHESDA BETHESA AND THE ANGEL WAS COMING down and WOULD START THE WATERS IN THE POOL. AND WHEN THE ANGEL START THE WATERS, IT WAS TIME FOR THE SICK PEOPLE TO ENTER THE AND THEY WERE GUARANTEED THAT AS LONG AS THEY ENTERED IN THERE, THE END OF THEIR SICKNESS WOULD BE AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT. SO I'M TELLING YOU, BROTHER, THERE'S AN ANGEL BEHIND THE ANGEL BEHIND THE BUILDING IS STRONGER [screaming] THAN THE ANGEL IN HEAVEN. COME ON, FRIEND. I'M WRITING THE MESSAGE. WHEN A PREACHER STANDS HERE, HE IS POWERFUL [screaming] BECAUSE IT IS THE CHANNEL THAT GOD IS USING. COME ON, SAINTS. DO WE READ THE MESSAGE? BROTHER PANA SAYS THE ANGEL BEHIND THE PULL. SOMEONE on the display. If you can get that for me and I see SOME PEOPLE DOUBTING. YOU COME TO CHURCH JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT. LET ME TELL YOU, YOU'RE MISSING A LOT. THE SECRET to your DELIVERANCE IS RIGHT HERE TONIGHT IS RIGHT HERE THIS MORNING. THE TIME FOR PLAYING CHURCH IS OVER. The prophet of God says in THE MESSAGE, THIRSTING FOR LIFE, THE GOD of heaven is IN THIS BUILDING TODAY. PARAGRAPH 87. If there's someone taking note, the God that created heavens and earth is here tonight. That is what makes him god to me. HE HAD THE highest place in heaven and took the LOWEST PLACE ON EARTH. HE COME FROM THE HIGHEST HEAVEN AND WENT TO THE LOWEST HELL. BECOME YOU THAT YOU WHO THROUGH HIS GRACE MIGHT BECOME HIM. SAINTS, LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE RECEIVED SOMETHING THAT NOT EVEN THE DEVIL CAN TAKE AWAY FROM. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND THE DEVIL. THE BIBLE SAYS THE DEVIL BELIEVES AND HE TREMBLES. BUT CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING? BELIEVING IS NOT ENOUGH. OBEDIENCE IS WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. WHEN YOU OBEY THE WORD [screaming] AFTER YOU HAVE BELIEVED, THAT BRINGS GOD DOWN, THAT BRINGS THE POWER, THAT BRINGS THE RESULT. ONLY BELIEVE, BUT THEN OBEY. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH ME? SO THE DEVIL CAN BELIEVE BUT HE CANNOT OBEY BUT UNTO YOU IT HAS BEEN GIVEN SOMETHING [screaming] THAT WHEN THE WORD COMES YOUR WAY I DON'T KNOW HOW I DON'T KNOW WHY [screaming] BUT WHEN I HEAR THE WORD SOMETHING DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF ME I JUST SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE THROUGH HIS GRACE MIGHT become him. Sons and daughters of God. He's in the building today. Night after night, he represents himself. And I can say service after service. He represents himself. Right in your business. Now follow me closely. The church has been preached to death. People come usually to the church. They say, "Well, we'll just go." Just go because it's a duty. Sometimes, sometimes they go because there is certain ministers, great men in the land today that can really bring out a sermon and they go to hear that. I'm pretty sure there's that character here today simply because there was a brother FROM NAIROBI. THAT IS WHY I'M GOING TO go to church. Now, if your intentions were good and you under expectations, God bless your heart for that. BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE who will not come to a Wednesday service because it is brother Martin preaching. I didn't get it. They won't come to a Wednesday service. BECAUSE PASTOR IS NOT around and it is brother Martin and it is brother Julius preaching. Brother Julius has nothing to tell you. I can only go to church when it is THE PASTOR PREACHING. THE CHURCH HAS HAD ENOUGH [screaming] SERMONS. But there's something that we're LOOKING FOR GREAT men in the land today that can really bring OUT A GREAT SERMON. AND THEY got to hear that. But what WE REALLY OUGHT TO GO TO CHURCH was to find Christ. YOU JUST GO TO CHURCH TO WORSHIP, TO LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER, TO LOOK AT YOUR SISTER, TO WORSHIP UNTIL YOU CAN EXPEL ALL YOUR GUILT AND SHAME. [screaming] Is there somebody who's guilty today? Uhoh. I'm preaching to guiltless people. So I I change the sermon. [laughter] Should I change the sermon? IF YOU'RE GUILTY, THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THAT GUILT CAN BE STRIPPED OFF. IF YOU'RE HAVING SHAME, [screaming] THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE THAT SHAME CAN BE STRIPPED OFF AND HE says uh expel all your guilt and SHAME FROM all the world and its GLOOM OUT OF YOUR hearts and let Christ come in, GOD'S satisfying portion. Then you will have eternal life. Who is here? Who is here? &gt;&gt; HIS SPIRIT IS HERE. HIS SPIRIT WANTS TO MOVE IN THIS CHURCH. DO YOU BELIEVE IT NOW? We can start. Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. You love the Lord. We read in the scriptures about this man by the name of Onesimus Onesimus. &gt;&gt; But before we get to Onesimus, &gt;&gt; the letter is addressed to Filimon. &gt;&gt; So I want to put it like this on is a little mystery that is hidden in the letter of Filimon. PAUL THE MESSENGER is writing a letter to Filimon and he has some very uh odd request if I put it like that because just to put some background to the story was a man that had been converted to Christ through the ministry of Paul and now Filimon in In his house, he had servants. And you know the purpose of a slave in a household is to fulfill the will of his master. In other words, a slave was just as equal to a prisoner. They didn't have rights. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO THEMSELVES. Whatever the master said, that is what WOULD GO. THEY WERE UNDER their masters their entire life. We can go in the Old Testament and we could hear of the trumpet of Jubilee. How upon the blowing of the trumpet of Jubilee, you are a slave. The trumpet of Jubilee divide your freedom. But in this kind of place in the Roman households, there was nothing about the trumpet of Jubilee. If you are bought as a slave, if you had been sold as a slave, you are a slave for life. Your entire LIFE WILL BE TIED TO YOUR MASTER FOR AS long as you live. The only thing that will lose you from your master is death or if out [clears throat] of the goodness of your of his heart your master decided to set you free. So and in the household of filon there was such a man by the name of Onesimus. Now this man Onesimus he was a slave. Yes. And when he robbed his master He fled. He fled. He ran away. He ran away to Rome. And when he flees to Rome, this is a place where he meets Paul. Now, Matthew, it was one thing for a slave to run away. That was punishable. It was another thing for a slave to run away after having stolen from his master. SO HE STOLE and he ran away. If he had RAN AWAY AND HE CAME BACK just like that, the master would have been gracious and maybe forgiven and he never do that again. Never run away. But now he has stolen the master's possession and he runs away. That is what we call a double tragedy. Double trouble. So even if halfway in the journey he regrets his decision and he THINKS OF GOING BACK, HE LOOKS AT WHAT HE STOLEN and he says because of this I cannot go back. I'm speaking to somebody today. Somebody that has been A BELIEVER HAS BEEN FAITHFUL BUT THEN THEY HAPPEN TO slip and fall. They happen TO DO SOMETHING THAT FILLS THEM WITH A LOT OF GUILT, that fills them with A LOT OF SHAME. AND THEY SAY, "IF MAYBE I HAD DONE THIS, MAYBE GOD WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED ME BACK. BUT NOW THAT I HAVE DONE THIS AND THIS AND THIS, MY LIFE IS IN A WORSE CONDITION." NOW I AM SPEAKING ABOUT ONESIMUS TODAY BECAUSE ONESSIMAS IS A MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE BOOK. THE LETTER WAS TO FILM BUT THE CONTENTS OF THE [screaming] LETTER WAS TIED RIGHT THERE. WE ARE MOVING. So we see on being a man that he was meets Paul and by the preaching of Paul his life is changed. His life is transformed. He becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus. The same way you and I when we came across the message of our messenger. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you met this message. Maybe you listen to the tape. You listen to spiritual amnesia. You listen to the you listen to spiritual amnesia. Maybe you listen to look away to Jesus. Maybe you read THE CHURCH BOOK. ARE ANY OF THESE THINGS? AND FROM THAT ENCOUNTER, YOUR CONNECTION AS ONESIMUS, &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm preaching to somebody. &gt;&gt; Friends, the Bible has become a new book. &gt;&gt; We are not preaching the Bible like a newspaper. WE ARE SEEING OURSELVES [screaming] WRITING THE SCRIPTURES. BRETHREN, THIS IS OUR FAMILY ALBUM. THIS IS OUR FAMILY ALBUM. WHEN WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE BIBLE, WE SEE ABRAHAM. Abraham is our father of faith. We move along. WE SEE MOSES. WE SEE DAVID. WE SEE JOB. WHO ARE THIS? THIS IS A CLOUD OF WITNESSES. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; So I I I don't want to preach to people that are looking to me as if I'm preaching Greek. I am not speaking about Onesimus. I am speaking ABOUT YOU TYPED IN THE BIBLE. [screaming] [laughter] Let me support that with a quote. Now, you give me this code in the message identification. The message identification 64 640216 40216 paragraph 2 uh uh paragraph 27 &gt;&gt; and he says I just wonder today if we couldn't look in the Bible and say that IS ME. YOU remember the story of that little boy that had never seen a mirror before. The only thing he's ever known was just a little piece that his father used to use while he was shaving the beard. It was just a little piece. If you wanted to look at the beard here, you have to place you have to turn the eyes. That is what he knew. until one time he visited his relative AND HE GOT INTO THE HOUSE AND HE SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS SUCH A BIG LAUGH AND HE MOVED CLOSER AND THE MOMENT HE MOVED CLOSER HE SAW ANOTHER BOY IN THE MIRROR. LET ME DRAMATIZE it for you. I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MIRROR [screaming] WAS SEVEN steps higher. THE MIRROR WAS SOMEWHERE UP ABOVE. SO HE HAD TO CLIMB UP 17. HE HAD TO CLIMB FAITH, VIRTUE, TEMPERANCE. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HE HAD TO CLIMB UP. THE STATES ARE OUR PERFECT MAN. GOT ON TOP. HE SAW SOMEBODY THAT WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAND, THE PERSON IN THE MIRROR LIFTED HIS HAND. WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAND, THE PERSON IN THE MIRROR LIFTED THEIR HAND. WHEN HE RAISED THE [screaming] OTHER HAND WHEN HE SAID HELLO, THE BOY SAID HELLO. AND REVELATION AND HE SAID MAMA. [screaming] SOMEBODY SAY MAMA. THAT IS ME. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, &gt;&gt; WE HAVE MET. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE [screaming] MET THE MESSAGE OF MALACHI. &gt;&gt; AND AS ON, &gt;&gt; GLORY TO JESUS. &gt;&gt; HERE WAS ONESIMUS. &gt;&gt; PAUL HAS WRITTEN A LETTER. HE'S CARRYING THE LETTER AND HE'S GOING TO FILL HIM. HE'S GOING TO FEEL CARRYING A LETTER THAT SPEAKS ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THE JOURNEY. HE HE LEFT HIS MASTER'S HOME WITH SHAME, &gt;&gt; WITH GUILT, WITH A LOT OF OPPRESSION. BUT WHEN HE MEETS THE MESSAGE, WHEN HE GETS IN CONTACT WITH THE MESSAGE, SOMETHING HAPPENED. AND NOW THE HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Give me that quote, brother. I want us to identify our position in THE WORLD. You know how WE OVERCOME THE DEVIL. HOW WE SHAKE OF THE GUILT AND THE SHAME IS BY knowing who we are. I'm going to be a bit radical TODAY where you will disassociate YOURSELF from anything that is not of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would really want us to read that if you can find it. Yes. No, no, no, no. Identification. Identification. I'm giving this to to give you some time to look at it. Amen. If I have this shirt and this shirt is dirty, can I ask you a question? Am I dirty? What is that? &gt;&gt; The shirt. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So I can disassociate myself and say I AM NOT DIRT THAT I am just wearing a dirty. Hallelujah. I AM NOT A SINNER. I HAVE JUST PUT ON A BODY OF SIN AND WITH THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO WALK IN THIS WORLD. TELL THE DEVIL IF YOU SUBJECT THIS BODY TO SIN. THE REAL ME WILL SUBJECT THE SAME SAME BODY TO FASTING AND PRAYER TO PRAISING AND [screaming] WORSHIP. AND WHEN I COME TO CHURCH AND I [screaming] WORSHIP, WHAT HAPPENS? THE SHAME FALLS AWAY. THE KILL FALLS AWAY. HALLELUJAH. [applause] We in the business of LAUNDRY as instituted by Paul because he said we are being washed by the water and the what? SO WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, LAUNDRY BUSINESS IS HAPPENING. THAT IS WHY THE PASTOR HAS TO GET THIS QUART HAS TO GET THAT THAT SCRIPTURE. HE'S MIXING THE CHEEK. HE'S MIXING THE WATER AND SOMETIMES IT CAN SCRATCH. IT CAN BE ROUGH. [screaming] WHAT IS HAPPENING? SCRUBBING THE CLOTHES. SCRUBBING AND SCRUBBING. BECAUSE YOU OUGHT TO BE CLEAN. &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, PERFECT AS YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER [screaming] IS ALSO PERFECT. [applause and cheering] This is identification. Are you in 64? Go to 64. I don't know why the devil does not want us to read this. Even if it takes 10 minutes, we are going to I'm not in a rush. 642164216 paragraph 27. So I just wonder today if we couldn't look in the Bible and say that is me. What are you looking at today? Are you busy looking at football? Busy looking into politics. YOU CANNOT FIND YOUR IDENTIFICATION. You have the royal seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; You [clears throat] can't go into another family and start looking at your looking for your PHOTO in the album of another family. You cannot come to my house and start looking for your photo in my house. You're not a part of my family. BUT IF MY DAUGHTER COMES AND SAYS, "DADDY, I want to see MYSELF IN YOUR PHOTO. You open your album." I just said, "Daughter, come let's not even go far and I'll come to the phone and write in the phone. My daughter will be able to see." So I just wonder today if we couldn't look in the Bible and say THAT IS ME AS WE WONDER which one is it? Which character in the Bible would we look like? Let's just take that for a little text now and stay with it for a while. And as we look into God's word, let us do something here. Let us identify ourselves. For he gives others in there for examples of what we are. Now remember that God takes his spirit or takes his man It was never his spirit. Satan takes HIS MAN never his spirit. So let us see IF WE CAN IDENTIFY our present state now with Bible character. God takes his man. Did God take Paul? DID GOD TAKE ON ESIMUS? BUT HE never took AWAY THE SPIRIT. So the same same ministering spirit is right HERE EVEN THIS DAY. SO WE see we can be able to identify ourselves with Onesimus this morning because the life of Onesimus is a life where we can see the grace of God in plain view. Because prophet says, Paul, he was the man who had suffered with Christ. And when that slave over there HAD RAN AWAY, PAUL HAD BORNE SO MUCH PERSECUTIONS SO MANY THINGS OF CHRIST till when that runaway slave ran away. Paul say wrote BACK TO HIS MASTER AFTER THE SLAVE had become converted, HE SAID, DON'T TREAT HIM AS A slave anymore. There's a change in designation. When grace is writing, grace does not write the HISTORY OF THE PAST. WHEN GRACE IS RIGHT, GRACE, REWRITES YOUR STORY. Wrote the story of Abraham. WE KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LIED. We know that Abraham doubted. But when Paul is writing in Romans, he says Abraham believed God. WE KNOW MOSES WAS A STAMMER. MOSES WAS WEAK. MOSES HAD TEMPER. MOSES DOUBTED GOD. WE KNOW MOSES EVEN GOT TO A POINT WHERE HE KILLED A MAN. BUT WHEN GRACE IS RIGHT IN HEBREWS 11, HE SAYS BY [screaming] FAITH MOSES WE KNOW SAMSON FELL. HE WAS DECEIVED BY A WOMAN. BUT WHEN CHRIST IS RIGHT THERE BY FAITH WE KNOW DAVID FELL DAVID FELL DAVID HAD A LOT OF WEAKNESSES BUT GRACE IS RIGHT by [screaming] faith WHAT DOES GRACE do what DOES GRACE DO GRACE REWRITE stories [applause] and the thing that I want you to get today, we are focusing on a finished work. But it's one thing for you to conduct yourself in accordance with that. Don't treat him as a SLAVE ANYMORE. TREAT him as a brother. IF HE OWES YOU ANYTHING, CHARGE IT UP TO ME. THIS is a man that only had one quote. I want you to see the cost of grace. There is no love without giving. There is no love without sacrifice. Ask me, I'll tell you. If you say you love, and you cannot give something is wrong. &gt;&gt; Should I go home? Let me actually say this. I hope pastor is not streaming. You cannot say you love God. You cannot say you love God. And as you're coming to church, you're looking for a wrinkled up note to put in the office. You have eaten the whole week. You've actually come to church already full that &gt;&gt; and you're looking for 1,000 10,000 10,000 &gt;&gt; 10,000 1,00 trustees. Is that true? And you're coming and you say, "Oh God, watch." There is no love without giving. &gt;&gt; Pastor did not send me to preach about money. So please do not say that he's preaching like this because pastor I am preaching by divine insight. This was not in my notes even. There is no love &gt;&gt; without giving. You have put on a suit you have put on good shoes and 1,000 and IN THE BACK POCKET THAT IS WHERE the 50,000 M but now if you did not have change to give the 1,000 that you usually give you put two fingers in the prayer. You start searching. Let the fingers do the walking and you just pull one and you say you love God. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Be serious. &gt;&gt; You say you love God. &gt;&gt; Should I continue preaching? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And yet you cannot even make it to church on time. &gt;&gt; Yet you say you love. Actually, I'm I love God. What you love is your pastor and you do because we have an order, 30 minutes before the sun. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not telling you this because I'm also good myself. But the correct correction begins in the house of God. It is time for us to you know have a relook for God. We love God. We will give our finances. We will give our time. We will give ourselves into THE &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Do you love grace? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we see this is what grace does here. you know, Paul, a man with just one coat. And here's Onesimus, who maybe stole quite, you know, some some items of value. But Paul says, "If he owes you, put it on my heart, isn't this what the Lord did for us? Don't you love him? Let's go. Now, I want to give a couple of quotes and then we we can have some some good climax as we continue to read quite a lot. See, he had been so in fellowship with Christ in his suffering till he was to be an outcast. He knowed what it was to fellowship in his suffering. He knowed how to sympathize WITH OTHERS. AND he says that's the reason Christ become human that he might know the groans of sickness the heartaches OF DISAPPOINTMENT that he WITH US MIGHT FELLOWSHIP TOGETHER. HE HAS BEEN partaking of life like we have. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Jesus was tempted in all like MAN just as we are disappointments and heartaches and sickness. For he bore our sicknesses and our teeth. You love the LORD JESUS. YOU KNOW, HOWEVER, in another message, he says, "However, he ordered GREAT DEBT AND PAUL had been so into LOVE WITH CHRIST till he sent word to the master that owned the slave that now he has become a beloved brother. ALL THAT HE OWES YOU, PUT IT IN MY account and I'll pay you when I COME. PAUL had been a Christian so LONG until he knew what it was to forgive, what it meant to forgive somebody. He had been forgiven himself. And I think every Christian that's really been FORGIVEN knows the appreciation of forgiveness. Do you see what grace has done? Grace brings forgiveness. And you know that it's only by grace that to be here for us to believe this message. I am only in THIS MESSAGE BY GRACE. FOR IT'S ONLY BY GRACE THAT I'M in this message. I don't know why my Lord GOD CHOSE ME, BUT I'M SO GRATEFUL ANYWAY, BUT I KNOW IT'S ONLY BY GRACE. SO, WE ARE so grateful that God has done these things for us. So, and we SEE THAT OUR DEBT WAS PUT ON JESUS'S HEART. AND I THINK OF PAUL THERE THAT GREAT CHRISTIAN. How that his HEART HAD KNEW THAT THERE WAS A GREAT CHURCH AGAINST HIM AND CHRIST by his own blood brought his pardon at the cross. HE TOOK HIS PLACE and he knowed how to feel for other people. I'm not just reading quotes for you, but I'm pray I'm not just reading quotes, BUT I'M PRAYING THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL QUICKEN THEM IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT IF I HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, I SHOULD HAVE A HEART OF FORGIVENESS AND YOU HAVE A FEELING FOR THE PEOPLE BECAUSE I OWE A GREAT DEBT AND IT WAS PUT ON JESUS'S HEART. AND CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT JESUS? THAT DEBT [screaming] IS NOT SOMEWHEREING SOME INTEREST OR ACREWING SOME PENALTIES. NO SIR, NO SIR. THAT DEBT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID WHILE HE WAS ON THE CROSS. I [screaming] WAS ON HIS MIND AND HE SAID IT IS FINISHED. SO NOW TONIGHT I CAN START WITH BOLDNESS like Onesimus because SEE WE ARE IDENTIFYING WITH Onesimus today. So if you are identifying as I want us to go to anus for a MINUTE INTERACTED WITH PAUL HE has listened to the message of his day he HAS BEEN CONVERTED and now he's been given a letter and YOU KNOW THE LETTER IN THOSE olden days in the olden days the the letter was written. And after being written, you know, the writer would sign and to ensure that it is secure, they would ROLL IT UP and put a seal on it. And once the letter gets to the recipient, THE RECIPIENT REALIZES THAT THIS LETTER HAS NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH. SO IF THERE'S A SECRET THAT IS CONTAINED IN THAT LETTER, IT IS STILL a secret and NOBODY HAS READ IT. BUT CAN I GIVE YOU A SECRET? THE LETTER. HALLELUJAH. The letter. GO WITH ME SAINTS BECAUSE WE need to come to a time where this message becomes a reality. are not just some 1,200 SERMONS by a man from Kentucky. God's love letter TO US. THIS is the token. THIS IS THE LETTER THAT PAUL, THE MESSENGER OF THE AGE, [screaming] HAS GIVEN TO ONESSIMUS SO THAT ONESIMUS AS YOU CAME FROM WHERE YOU CAME FROM, YOU CAME IN A FALLEN CONDITION. COME ON SOMEBODY. [screaming] YOU CAME FROM WHERE YOU CAME FROM IN A FALLEN CONDITION. &gt;&gt; BUT I AM GIVING YOU SOMETHING. AND WHAT I AM GIVING YOU NOW CONTAINS THE SECRET OF YOUR NEW NAME. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH ME, SOMEBODY. PREACH WITH ME. PREACH WITH ME NOW. THE LETTER THAT YOU'RE GOING BACK WITH CARRIES YOUR NEW IDENTIFICATION. [screaming] I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE WHAT [screaming] NAMES THEY HAVE CALLED YOU. ONESIMUS. IN THIS LETTER, THERE'S A MYSTERY [screaming] THAT TELLS YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU ARE NO LONGER A SLAVE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE MY BROTHER and you have received. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR prophet messenger. PAUL IS A TYPE OF CAN I TELL YOU? IT'S EASIER TO BRIDGE TYPES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT, but when we get TO THE NEW TESTAMENT, IT BECOMES REAL AND SOON because grace has already BEEN REVEALED. WE ARE NOT SEEING GRACE IN SHADOW FORM. BUT WE ARE SEEING GRACE IN A MAN WHO CALLED APOSTLE PAUL. Go with me. In the Old Testament, it was types and sh. But now IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, WHY DID PAUL say follow me as I follow Christ? Because it is no longer PAUL LIVE. IT IS CHRIST. WHATEVER is coming FROM PAUL IS A REFLECTION FROM SO WE ARE NO LONGER IN A GLARE AT ALL. Inspiration is coming my way. We are no longer we are no longer walking by a glare. You can find quotations where brother Brham says that that those that never MOVED with the revelation of the word in their day, they were living using a past life. They were living with a glare. And the other word for a glare IS FALSE LIGHT. SO WE ARE NOT walking by the glare anymore. WE are walking in A TIME WHERE THE BIBLE IS NO LONGER IN PAGE FOUR. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE [screaming] IS WALKING ON. THAT IS WHAT PAUL [screaming] WAS TO ONESIMA. PAUL WAS NOT PREACHING TO ONESIMUS BY WHAT? &gt;&gt; HIS ACTIONS WERE A TESTIMONY AND PREACHING TO ONESIMUS. &gt;&gt; You are my brother. &gt;&gt; And we've received one like Paul as well. Did Paul meet with the pillar of fire? Did he converse with THE PILLAR OF FIRE? SO WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSENGER OF THE caliber of Paul. THAT'S THE REASON WHY. HE WAS VERY VERY WATCHFUL. [screaming] HE asked will Paul be judged? &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let them let them call me a brand. BUT I AM A BELIEVER OF THE MESSAGE OF WILLIAM. &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE HE IS GOD'S VINDICATED PROATION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Can I show you something? &gt;&gt; Paul refers to Onesimus. as a psalm. Is that right? We read it together that I have begotten him. You know, begotten is to bear to bring forth. So in other words, Onesimus is a son to Paul. And you know we also sons of brother Brahham. Hallelujah. What happened one one morning early morning sleeping on the on the bed his arms behind his head and he's wondering what happens when people die. When I die will I just be like a cloud floating in the air. I'll be moving in church and sing brother I can speak to him and he can speak and at that point a voice tells him who would you like to see beyond the curtain of time yes I would LIKE THAT VERY MUCH he crosses over TO THE OTHER SIDE AND THE voice speaks to him you remember how you read in the Bible &gt;&gt; that when the prophets and the fathers They were gathered with their people. And he said, "Yes, I remember. But do you mean that all these are broms? We are not so manys in our families like this. So, brother Brham was looking at people and thinking that they his family. But the angel CORRECTS HIM. THESE ARE not physical brands. THESE ARE THEY [screaming] THAT WERE CONVERTED TO CHRIST BY BELIEVING YOUR MESSAGE. I AM PROUD TO BE IDENTIFIED AS A BRANHAM TODAY. [screaming] I AM A SON OF BRANHAM. &gt;&gt; I AM BEGOTTEN OF BRHAM BECAUSE BRANHAM IS A PARALLEL OF [screaming] ABRAHAM. HALLELUJAH. THE SAME WAY THAT ABRAHAM had a seed and those were God's people at that time, God also has a seed in the God also HAS A SEED. AND WHAT DOES THE PROPHET ASK? You know, you know, he was very very careful. Will Paul be judged? And what did the voice tell him? Yes, he will do. And what did he say? If Paul's people shall ENTER IN OTHER WORDS, IF ONESIMUS SHALL ENTER, [screaming] BRETHREN, CATCH IT. CATCH IT. CATCH IT. [screaming] THIS WAS NOT ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. IF THE STANDARD THAT PAUL SET, he could REWRITE THE STORY OF ANIME. given me IN MY DISPENSATION AS A STAR IN THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD [screaming] IN THE church book. Brother Brandham says that the big star will be shining its light and there will be other other stars that will be drawing light. SO ONESIMUS WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT DREW FROM PAUL. SO IF PAUL'S PEOPLE SHALL ENTER, Christianity is not A GROUP AFFAIR. THIS is an individual. SO IF ONESIMUS [screaming] SHALL ENTER, HAVE I BEEN IDENTIFIED with Onesim? SO IF ONESIMA SHALL ENTER, &gt;&gt; THEN MY PEOPLE SHALL also enter. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. [applause] Praise God. Amen. This is what grace has done for us. THIS IS WHAT God's mercy has brought our way. OUR STORIES HAVE BEEN REWRITTEN. PRAISE THE name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, he says here that now IN TIMES PAST HE WAS unprofitable unto thee but now profitable to you and me. You see the name Onesimus, the meaning of that name meant or rather means one that is profitable, ONE THAT IS USEFUL, THAT IS THE meaning of the name on. So Onesimus had a name BUT HIS LIFE WAS NOT PROJECTING THE REALITY OF HIS NAME. UNTIL HE GOT INTO CONTACT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUSE. AND WHEN HE GOT IN CONTACT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUSE, THE CHARACTER THAT WAS IN HIM, YOUR NAME is your character. Remember, I'm not speaking ABOUT THE NORMAL NAME. I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT JULIUS. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE Lord Jesus. I'm not about the name Kennedy. Kennedy. No sir, I AM SPEAKING ABOUT THE NAME THAT YOU HAD EVEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR LIFE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT NAME THAT IS? I'M GOING TO TELL IT TO YOU NOW. THE FAMILY IN heaven and THE FAMILY ON EARTH IS KNOWN BY ONE NAME. &gt;&gt; WHAT [screaming] NAME IS THAT? &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I SEE I SEE &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANA &gt;&gt; AS HE'S preaching the seals he says I no longer CALL YOU CHURCH I CALL YOU BRIDE I CALL you Mrs. JESUS. What is the opening OF THE SEAL? IT IS THE LETTER THAT PAUL HAS WRITTEN ROLLED UP AND SEALED. BUT AS ONESIMUS IS CARRYING IT AND HE'S GOING TO FILM, THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER ARE NOT A MYSTERY TO HIM. WE came into this world having fallen, born in sin, shaped in iniquity. We came into THIS WORLD SPEAKING LIES. BUT WE'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE PAST. THE BIBLE has become a new book. And we ARE NOW ON A JOURNEY. WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE WE CAME FROM. WE ARE GOING BACK TO GOD. WE ARE GOING TO FILM. WE CAME FROM GOD NOT THE WAY WE WERE supposed to go. This is your life. We came from God. Having bypassed our theory, THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF A slave being set free. But Onesimus made himself FREE CONTRARY to the provisions OF THE MASTER. SO he went contrary to the will OF HIS MASTER. HE CAME INTO THIS WORLD from the thoughts OF GOD. INTO THE FLESH HAVING BYPASSED OUR THEOPIA which is the word body. SO AND THAT PUT US IN SLAVERY AND NOW AS we are going BACK we are going with A LETTER. WE ARE GOING WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE WE ARE GOING WITH A TALKING. HALLELUJAH. It's not SINKING MEET WITH THE MESSENGER. FROM THE MOMENT SHE MEETS THE MESSENGER, HER LIFE IS CHANGED. ARE YOU WITH ME? SO WHEN JUDGMENT IS COMING TO FALL, ALL she had to do was display the token. AND AS LONG AS THE TOKEN WAS ON DISPLAY, NO DISTRACTION. WILL COME UPON HER. SO THE TOKEN IS NOT JUST BEING displayed for THE SAKE OF IT. RA ALSO HAD TO KNOW WHAT THIS token what THIS WHAT THIS TOKEN. SHE HAS TO KNOW WHAT THIS TOKEN MEANS TO HER IN HER [screaming] HOUSE. SO THAT SHE DOES NOT APPLY THE TOKEN BUT SHE'S OUTSIDE LOTTERYING. HE HAS TO APPLY THE TOKEN AND STAY IN THE HOUSE AND [screaming] WAIT UNTIL SO ONESIMUS HAS TO CARRY THE LETTER AND AS HE'S CARRY AS HE'S CARRYING THE LETTER HE HAS TO KNOW THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER BECAUSE THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTER WILL DETERMINE HOW HE BEHAVES IN THE JOURNEY. HE HAS A LETTER, A LETTER THAT SPEAKS ABOUT HIM. HE IS A MYSTERY IN A LETTER TO PHILIP. HE HAS TO KNOW WHAT THE LETTER SAYS CONCERNING HIM AND THAT WILL SHAPE HIS CHARACTER. Remember the letter is sealed but TO an open book. TO ONESIMUS. The seals have BEEN BROKEN TO ONESSIMUS. &gt;&gt; SHE'S NO LONGER in Ludicia. SHE HAS PICKED THE EYES OUT [screaming] and his eyes ARE HE CAN SEE. I AM NO LONGER A SLAVE. &gt;&gt; I AM BEGOTTEN OF PAUL. [screaming] I AM ENJOYED. So my new IDENTIFICATION is not in relation WITH THE PAST. SO AS HE IS GOING, &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING with a new song. [cheering] Are you SEEING WHAT I'M SAYING? AS WE ARE GOING TO GOD, THE BIBLE HAS BEEN SEALED &gt;&gt; TO THE DENOMINATIONS. &gt;&gt; BUT TO ONESSIMUS, &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THIS BIBLE. I AM INSIDE THE BIBLE. I AM TYPED IN ONESIMUS. I am TYPED IN DAVID. I AM TYPED IN ESTHER. I AM TYPED IN THIS ONE. I HAVE TEDD IN THAT. &gt;&gt; SO AS I AM GOING BACK TO MY FATHER, I KNOW [screaming] &gt;&gt; I AM CARRYING THE DNA. [applause] &gt;&gt; So you can imagine ON CARRYING A LETTER that has declared his freedom. But then he's CARRYING THE LETTER. WHERE AM I EVEN going to stay? No. How am I even going to repay for all that I owe him? If the seal has been broken TO HIM, HE KNOWS HE'S WALKING. HOW WILL I pay? Yeah. I I I took away his clothes. I took away the shoes and I spent all of them in. I spent all of them with women. What am I going to do? That is somebody to whom the seals have not been. BUT IF ONESIMA HAS READ THE CONTENTS OF THE SINS HAVE BEEN BROKEN, HE KNOWS [screaming] THE DEBT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID. HE KNOWS PAUL HAS ALREADY SAVED. PUT IT ON MY [screaming] ON MY ACCOUNT. HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE TO FEAR. HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE TO SIN. HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE TO THE PAST. [screaming] HE'S NO LONGER A SLAVE TO THE VOICE OF THE ENEMY BECAUSE THE LETTER [screaming] HAS GIVEN HIM IDENTIFICATION. This is the real you. [cheering] Hallelujah. HOW MANY OF US HAVE ALLOWED THE DEVIL TO GIVE US A PICTURE THAT is contrary TO WHO WE ARE. THANK GOD FOR THE MESSAGE. GOD'S GRACE TO US HAS REWRITTEN OUR has broken the SEALS OF OUR LIVES AND HAS MADE US KNOW WE WERE RAISED IN THE CHICKEN. You were raised AMONG THE CHICKEN. BUT THE EYES [screaming] HAVE BEEN QUICKENED. OUR EYES OF UNDERSTANDING HAVE BEEN OPENED. OUR [screaming] EYES OF UNDERSTANDING HAVE BEEN OPENED. AND WE CAN SEE WINGS. [snorts] Just like MAMA EAGLE. [screaming] A BIG JUST LIKE MAMA EAGLES. [laughter] WINGS. THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE NEW TESTAMENT TO FLY. WHEN THE STORMS COME, THE HIGHER WE GO, WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF [screaming] THE STORMS. WE HAVE GOT OUR IDENTIFICATION. WHEN THE STORMS COME AND THE CHICKEN IS THERE, let us go. Let us go. It is about to rain. IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN. WE HAVE REALIZED WHO WE ARE. WE ARE EAGLES. WE STRETCH FURTHER AWAY. CLAP [screaming] TWICE AND OFF WE GO. AND THE HIGHER WE GO, THE BETTER WE SEE. THE HIGHER WE [screaming] GO, THE PROMISES WE COME TRUE. THE LONGER I SERVE HIM, HALLELUJAH. THE LONGER I SERVE HIM, THE SWEETER HE GROWS, THE MORE I KEEP [screaming] ON FLYING, THE MORE I REALIZE THERE IS MORE LAND TO POSSESS. [screaming] THERE IS MORE HOLY GHOST. THERE IS MORE REVELATION. THERE IS MORE POWER. [screaming] THERE IS MORE ANOINTING. THERE IS MORE BLESSING. THERE IS MORE BREAKTHROUGH BECAUSE I KEEP [screaming] ON FLYING. I KNOW WHO I AM. I AM NOT A CHICKEN. I HAVE MY IDENTIFICATION. I HAVE seen [screaming] my ego. This is who I am. And I can TELL THE DEVIL, DEVIL, WATCH OUT. YOU'RE coming to MY THOUGHTS. ALL I NEED TO DO. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEBATE WITH YOU WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. I'LL KEEP ON FLYING. &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING. &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING WHERE THIS BODY WILL NOT HOLD. [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO JESUS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I'LL KEEP ON FLYING WHERE THIS BODY WILL NOT HOLD ME ANYMORE. WHERE THIS [screaming] BODY WILL SPEAK IN TONG WILL PROPHESY WILL BE QUICKENED IN THE HANDS OF THE SICK AND THEY RECOVER. [cheering] Are you seeing where we are? This is our place. Not to allow the enemy to preach TO US ANYTHING CONTRARY from what we have received. Have you forgotten? Take a peek at the letter. Take a PEEK AT THE LETTER. IS THE JANITOR ARE YOU CLIMBING MOUNTAINS? TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WHAT DOES THE LETTER SAY? THE LETTER [screaming] HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY GRACE AND GRACE HAS REWRITTEN MY STORY. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You love the Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; So we see He was not profitable. But now with a full revelation of what his name is, he is quickened. The meaning of that name can now be seen. Let me tell you saints. We are the onesimus of these things. People that are ordained to be profitable, profitable in the kingdom of God, to be profitable in their assemblies, to be profitable in your family, to be profitable in your school, to be profitable YOUR PLACE OF GOD. THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS ORDAINED. Let's cry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says something that is so amazing. &gt;&gt; You know, receive ones on receive ones &gt;&gt; as myself. Do not regard Onesimus as a slave. Regard him as a brother. and not just regard him as a bride, but when you see him, see melle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want that to sink. We can be Christians with partiality sometimes. &gt;&gt; That we regard this one better than the other one. until you realize we have classes. There's a class of those who drive. There's a class of those who wear suits. There's a class that lives in certain areas. And when church is over, the different classes meet up. When you're meeting the brother of your class and the anointing is so and of the other class, we actually even have another style back home where you don't even greet the brother well. You actually do like this and you actually go but the messenger of the age said if you see him receive him the way you will receive. [applause] I just want us to reflect on this a bit. You remember the prodigal son. You know after the prodical son came back you know the elder brother had a lot of bitterness. Take some time and read that story because he was like father you mean to tell me I've been with you all this time. You've never been slain for me. nothing but now this your son after he has squandered all THE MONEY HE'S coming and you're even killing the father what are you trying to show here father praise the name of the lord Jesus there are people who are like that in the king but can I tell you something this This is what the difference was. The elder son was a son but with a slave mentality. I really wish I I really wish I had the time to drink. When the son When the prodical SON IS COMING, HE does not realize the brother has come. When the feast is being planned, he does not realize what is happening. Because remember the place of a son is beside the father. But all THIS TIME HE IS with the servants in the field. Yes sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; Actually when he even comes BACK HOME HE DOES NOT go to the father oneonone. He sends another servant. Go check what he's having. Are you getting a mentality? So when he's telling the father why are you doing this? And the father gives a very strange answer. You have been with me all this time. But your brother, he was once lost and now he's found. This is how I understand that scripture. What the father is trying to tell this son. You have been with me all this time. Yet you are not realizing that you are actually my son. You are blaming me for not giving YOU A KID to celebrate with your friends. Don't you realize that as my SON WHAT I HAVE is yours. SO IF YOU WANTED IT, ALL YOU HAD TO DO [screaming] WAS TAKE IT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing amnesia? The devil gets you catched up in a POINT where you can be so fundamental and everything ELSE but you're still living under privilege. BECAUSE IF YOU WANTED A KID, YOUNG MAN, EVEN IF YOU TOOK 10 I WILL EVEN REALIZE IT BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE IS YOURS. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SUNSHIP. SUNSHIP. [screaming] This is where God has PLACED US. [screaming] THIS IS where God has put us. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? How underprivileged have you been living? &gt;&gt; Are you in a place where you find that I don't think I'm I'm even worth it. I just feel like I'm worthless. You try to think that Christ would have died for you. And the journey becomes so hard for you. There was this man There was just an old bum. You know, a bum is someone who doesn't have a place to live. He's just living out in the streets. And it happened that one time. This old bum was was you know he was uh he got involved in an accident and he got so injured and mangled up and it got to a place where now uh he had been taken to hospital and the doctors were there thinking what can we do for this man because his case is so difficult I don't think we can be able to undertake it and when he was just there. His arms had been broken, his ribs were broken, the legs were broken. He was in such a bad condition and it appeared as if he was unconscious. Maybe that might be your condition. But I'm here to tell you, God specializes in things important. Do you feel like you've drifted? I'VE DRIFTED SO FAR. I'VE DRIFTED SO much in my prayer life. I've drifted so much in my consecration life. I don't even KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. I'VE JUST BEEN LIVING a life of formality. God specializes in mending the broken piece. Pick up the broken pieces and bring them to the Lord. So he was there unconscious. And the doctor the doctors are discussing and now what do we do and they arrived at a conclusion that it is not worth it. We will spend a lot of time trying to fix him up all the surgeries and all that. It will take a lot of money and a lot of resources. and they just decided it is not worth it. And you may have gone through the storms of life. The devil may have mangled you up. disappointments may have come your way and emotions and you end up so broken and you just start feeling so worthless and you feel oh I don't think there's any hope for me but as these doctors were making this disease it actually happened that he was not just as maybe near to death as they had thought because as they were there and saying no I don't think we can be able to do anything about this he gathered up his courage and he said hey doctor just a minute I've heard what you've said that I'm not worth your time I'm not worth this and that or that all right but I want to tell you something. I am worth something. I am worth the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. HE LEFT HEAVEN TO COME AND DIE for me. And I'm here to tell you, my brother, my sister, the stones of life may have left in such a bad place, but I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE SOMETHING BECAUSE IN REVELATION 5, THERE WAS A COUNCIL THAT WAS HELD AND GOD ASKED. WHO IS WORTHY [screaming] TO TAKE THE BOOK? WHO IS WORTHY TO BREAK THE SEALS? THE QUESTION WAS, WHO IS WORTHY? AND NO ONE WAS WORTHY. AND JOHN WAS THERE BEATEN UP, ALL BROKEN, REALIZING THAT ALL WAS LOST, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE OF THE ELDERS SAID, "WEEP NOT." AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU [screaming] HAVE SUFFERED. YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH STUFF, BUT THE TIME HAS COME. WEEP [screaming] NOT THE SEASON OF WEEPING. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord is upon me now. &gt;&gt; The season of WEEPING has come to an end. HALLELUJAH. HOW has it come to AN END? BECAUSE THERE IS ONE THAT IS WORTH. THERE IS [screaming] ONE THAT HAS THE POWER TO REWRITE YOUR STONE. [screaming] THERE IS ONE THAT HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE YOUR SITUATION. [screaming] GOD SPECIALIZES IN THINGS THAT IMPOSSIBLE. WILL DO WHAT NO OTHER POWER DO. WE SING A SONG CALLED ANY MOUNTAINS YOU CAN'T tunnel through. God is either going to give you a tunnel in the mountain. He gives you the power to climb the MOUNTAIN or the wings of an eagle to fly above the mountain. You know what else? He can also GIVE YOU THE POWER TO SPEAK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND CAST IT INTO THE SEA THAT THE GOD WE SERVE GOT ANY RIVERS THAT ARE UNCROSSABLE. THERE'S A river before you and it is REFUSING TO PASS for you to walk. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. ASK FOR POWER. YOU KNOW TO do what? To walk on water. [laughter] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. GRACE HAS ALREADY REWROTE YOUR LIFE. YOU ARE AN OVERCOMER. [screaming] [applause] What a wonderful THING TO GO INTO BATTLE TO KNOW THAT I'M ALREADY A WINNER. TO GO INTO A FIGHT TO KNOW THAT THE VICTORY listen I am not going to get the victory remember that song I went TO does it say I am going to the enemy's camp I am going to the enemy's camp I ALREADY WENT [screaming] AND I TOOK BACK. &gt;&gt; SO MINE IS TO EXERCISE. &gt;&gt; MINE [screaming] IS TO CATCH A REVELATION OF WHAT IS IN THE LETTER TO EXERCISE MYSELF ACCORDING TO IT TO [screaming] REALIZE I AM ALREADY A SON. [cheering] And he said, &gt;&gt; "I am worth something. I am worth the life of the Lord Jesus Christ." And that is what you're worth, my brother. And you see, when you know your wife, you know you're a partaker of what Adam lost. &gt;&gt; You know you're a partaker. of redemption. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him this morning? [applause] &gt;&gt; Luke 10:30. And before we get to Luke chapter 10, as the brother is opening it up, &gt;&gt; you can just read one word by one word, my brother. No problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was this man by the name of &gt;&gt; meisph. [laughter] It's a bit of a tongue twister. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord Jesus. I'm &gt;&gt; just giving him some time to open Luke chapter 10. This was a time when David has ascended &gt;&gt; into kingship. And you see David has ascended into kingship. Saul is dead. &gt;&gt; Jonathan is dead. The entire family of Saul has already been killed in battle. And then David asks a question to one of his servants. And he asks the servants, "Is there anyone of the family of Saul that might be alive?" Because I want TO SHOW KINDNESS. TO THE FAMILY OF SAUL. And one of the servants said that Jonathan has a son. Who was Jonathan? Jonathan was a friend to David. You can put this down if you would want to read it later. In the book of second Samuel, Jonathan was a friend to David. and he had a son. There was just one issue with the son. The son was lame on his but he was a son to Jonathan. He was a son. So David says, you know, go go bring them forth and me is brought He bows his face before the king and identifies himself and said, "Oh, your servant is here." And David says unto him, "Fear not because I am going to show you kindness for Jonathan your father's &gt;&gt; because your father was my friend. And you see the Bible says that David loved Jonathan as his own. The identification and the connection between Jonathan is what made me a partaker. our association with this message. Saints for Jonathan's sake, I will show you kindness. YOU ARE A SON OF JONATHAN, my friend. So stop regarding yourself AS A SERVANT. From today you will eat at my table. Who eats at the king's table? The family of the king. So from today you are a son in my house. You mean me? I am not looking at your condition. I am looking at your ASSOCIATION with my friend. Was Abraham a friend of God? Was Branham a friend of God? Yes, he was afraid of God until one day God asked him, "Why don't you walk with me?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO [clears throat] BY ASSOCIATION, HERE COMES He's lame. You know, HE'S JUST DRAGGING HIMSELF UP. HE'S struggling trying TO MAKE THROUGH. BUT [screaming] WHERE IS HE HEADED? &gt;&gt; HE'S HEADED &gt;&gt; IN THE SEAT at the king's TABLE BECAUSE HE HAS A POSITION, REVELATION 3 FROM VERSE 20 GOING DOWNWARDS. AND TO HIM THAT OVERCOMES WILL I GRANT THE RIGHT [screaming] TO SIT WITH ME IN MY THRONE JUST AS I OVERCAME AND SAT ON MY FATHER'S THRONE? HERE comes my LAME DRAGGING HIMSELF. [screaming] WHAT IS HE LOOKING AT? &gt;&gt; IS HE LOOKING AT HIS FEET? &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; HE'S LOOKING AT THE SEAT. ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR CONDITION? ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE? [screaming] LOOK TO JESUS. LOOK TO THE THRONE. LOOK TO THE THRONE. HALLELUJAH. You will eat at the king's table. Ah hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BY FRIENDSHIP you will partake of the third bull ministry. HALLELUJAH. What is SERVED IN THE KING'S TABLE? It's a seven COURSE MEAL WHERE YOU'RE GROWING FROM FAITH TO VIRTUE INTO THE STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN. YOU CAN BE ABLE TO HOLD THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT AND BY FAITH. YOU CAN SAY LET THERE BE AND YOU CAN SAY &gt;&gt; I HALLELUJAH [screaming] THE SPOKEN WORD SPEAKS INTO EXISTENCE AND SPEAKS OUT OF EXISTENCE. [screaming] YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR FAMILY AND SAY IN MY HOUSE NONE OF MY CHILDREN. [screaming] I'M GOING TO GET LOST. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. [applause and cheering] AM I SPEAKING TO PRAYING MOTHERS? I'M SPEAKING TO PRAYING MOTHERS. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR WEAKNESSES, BUT LOOK TO THE THRONE [screaming] AND SIT AT THE KING'S TABLE AND START DINING AND START DINING AND SPEAK. [screaming] [applause and cheering] OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Let's finish with this. Grace rewrote the STORY OF MIBIA. FROM A LAME MAN TO HAVING A POSITION AT THE king's table. One thing about our king, HE DOES NOT LEAVE YOU TO BE LAME. This is what he does for us. And Jesus answering said, "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among it." These are things we know. We know that coming from Jerusalem to Jericho. It refers to a backsliden condition. It refers to how Onesimus came from the master in the wrong way. How you and I came to this world the wrong way and fell among thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed. When you stripped off your reignment, what is left? Shame. The shame of your nakedness is exposed. So he was left in a shameful condition and he's wounded. He cannot be able to do anything. And guilt puts you in a place where you cannot pray. Guilt puts you in a place where you cannot worship God with freedom of consciousness. Is someone with me? And departed leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that day. And when he saw him, he passed by and there was a priest. someone who was supposed to be an intercessor between God and man comes and finds him and he actually moves so far away from I don't want to be associated and likewise a Levite when he was at the place came and looked on him this one rode near the brother has really fallen. Hey, the sister has really fallen and he went on to the other side. These are characters we have and passed by the other side. But a certain Samaritan appeared, came where he was and when he saw him, he had compassion on him. You see, the love of God is what drove him to give himself. And he continues to say and went to him. &gt;&gt; What did he do? Bound up his wounds. You see, on your journey to the king's table, there's a certain power that God gives you that you do not go there. struggling, falling and getting all the tough, he comes and heals you, patches you up, bound up his wounds, &gt;&gt; pouring in oil and wine. And what happens? And set him on his own beast. So the way he's going BACK is not how he came. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He, you know, beast signifies power. Oil is a type of the Holy Spirit. Wine stimulation of revelation. So God is bringing these ingredients to a people in a certain condition. He puts them on his own beast. &gt;&gt; The same power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is what is at our disposal, friends. If we end up living lives that are under privilege, you can never put it on God. God has already done it. The story of your life has already been. But do you know will you live a life that patterns after what grace has written about and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And on the tomorrow when he departed, he took out two pens and gave them to the horse and said unto him, "Take care of him, and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again, I will repay." If you had the time, we would have preached on this as well. But I just want us to see something as we meditate, as the musicians come. I want us to sing that song. If not for grace, &gt;&gt; amazing grace house with the sounds. Grace has rewritten our story. We know we are Mrs. Jesus Christ. We know we are sons and daughters of God. But does our life pattern after that? You've been living maybe with shame and guilt and all this kind of. But my purpose today was to show you that you have no reason to live under that shadowing because God has already rewritten your story. [music] Now, it doesn't have to be guilt and shame of maybe actions and wrongs that you've done. If you have that, if you have that God has still made a way, you can still be in a certain guilt and shame where you're living under privilege. You're not living as a son of God. And is there somebody that will say to today, Lord, I realize your grace on my realize what you've done and Lord, I come as we stand on our feet. Lord, I rededicate myself to you. Lord, just like Onesimus, give me more of what? OF WHAT? GIVE ME MORE OF WHAT YOU want concerning me. I want a full revelation of what your word says concerning. I want to live a life free from sin, free from oppression, free from shackle. This is what grace has done. Where will you be? [music] This message that we've received &gt;&gt; is a message of grace, but now I'm found. It would have been a hopeless [music] case. It would have just been an empty space. But say message gives us purpose. This message gives us identity. Maybe maybe you've not really KNOWN WHO YOU ARE AND YOU WANT TO CROWD, "OH GOD, HELP ME. I've seen a small glimpse, but Lord, I want to step before the mirror of the world and see it in plain view." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. escape an empty place. [music] &gt;&gt; If not for Amazon [singing] [music] is so sweet to me. I once [singing] was lost was lost, &gt;&gt; but now I'm found. [music] &gt;&gt; If you still stay lost, &gt;&gt; that is up to you. &gt;&gt; has located YOU THIS AFTERNOON. AND REST HAS TOLD YOU YOU ARE NO LONGER A SLAVE BUT A SON. Amazing [music and singing] grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. &gt;&gt; How sweet the sound. I [singing] on [music] was lost. I on was lost. But now [singing and music] I'm found. A hopeless [singing] and unus [singing and music] from the depth of our hearts. &gt;&gt; RAISE YOUR VOICE &gt;&gt; AND CONFESS OF WHAT GRACE HAS DONE FOR YOU TODAY. REST HAS GIVEN YOU A SAVIOR. [music] REST HAS GIVEN YOU REDEMPTION. YOU HAVE A HOPE OF GLORY. YOU HAVE A hope of eternity. On Christ the solid rock we stand. ALL THE crowd is seeking sand. [music and singing] God's unmmerited favor. Amen. That is for us. [music] If not for grace. Oh yes. Amazing grace. How sweet [singing] the sound. [music] I was [singing] lost. &gt;&gt; I on was lost. [music] Now I'm found. [singing and music] My whole blessings, &gt;&gt; an empty [music] face if not for grace. [music] Where would I be? [singing] You only know &gt;&gt; I want you [music] through eyes of love. Our hopeless [music and singing] game [music and singing] [music and singing] of life. We appreciate we thank you. Father Lord, we honor you. We glorify you, Jesus. We appreciate you, Lord. We stand on the praise. We stand [music] on the house. We stand on the way. The Lord died for a sinner and a fresh like heaven [music] father came on Jesus and stood in the camp of God. When all was lost when he was your father would have been destroyed.

[music] Amen. God bless you all. Amen. [music] Uh thank you uh brother Shalom. Did you appreciate the word? Amen. Amen. So uh like uh we uh I promised you uh last Sunday, today I would love to give you an overall update about the youth camp contributions. Uh just briefly uh you remember we decided to do this so that we can um uh reduce on the burden on our pastor. So uh right now uh we received the prayers which we believe would really be uh kind of somehow enough to take us through. Uh but I mentioned that [snorts] if you have not given in your pledge that is mostly um by the other category. was mostly by the youth who gave in these pledges that you come to me or brother Dan or brother Joel and you can give in your contribution then uh we are going to record it so we have not received anyone and time is closing in how many days brother Dan are we remaining with around 61 days that's approximately two month up to 9th January so kindly let us uh do our best and bring them in. So for those who pledged uh we agreed, you know, we can bring 5,000 uh 1,000, 2,000, uh 10,000, it would be enough. So uh I appreciate uh those who have uh given as much as 5,000. May God richly bless you. And uh would love to emphasize those who have not given in anything towards your pledge. kindly uh send it in. Uh there are those that I tried to reach out to in the course of the week and uh those that I have not uh anytime I'll be reaching out. So let's start uh the pledges coming. I want to appreciate those who have given in more uh and uh than their balance what they have given. If uh you are in the group, I'm usually posting um what you have given towards your pledge and the balance. So I would love to appreciate I would I'm not going to mention names but God really richly bless you. So um we paid the venue uh we paid a deposit to the venue which was 2 million and uh right now uh the amount collected is two as of end of day yesterday it is uh uh 2 million765,000. So that means uh in cash we are having only 765,000. So and the amount that is not that has not been u sorry the figure is 2,815,000 million. So and our total pledges were 13,360,000. So this means the amount that we have not cleared is 10,545,000. So we have not even got to nearly a quarter of what we pledged. So let us give in uh this week. Uh I appreciate last week it was some quite good time for those that gave in. God bless you once again. So uh this week I'll if I give you a call uh to remind you uh don't feel bad because uh we really need to pay some of the service providers and the rest. So that is the update. We having 800,000 for now uh which can't do anything. And uh once again uh this was a request from uh the pastor uh the I don't know I don't want to call them the the older people because no one here is old but those ones uh that are not the youth like we collected kindly send in uh the pledges because at least a church member we should not give something less than 100,000 others will be paying a camp fee of 50,000. So, uh if you're a church member, you should u give something that is more than 100,000. Briefly, one person will be paying will be spending us as the church, we are going to be spending about 70,000 on each person that will be camping at the venue. um which makes it uh if uh these people come and pay 50 we shall be in a deficit of 20,000. So that's the reason why us here we are few but uh you know we have never estimated our we have never underestimated ourselves and we will never so let us give in in that the 100 at least we can get uh the 20,000 to at least support one person one visitor that will be coming in. So God richly bless you uh brother Dan and brother Joe they'll be waiting for the pledges or the contribution for those that did not send them in. And if you're also part of the youth kindly uh reach out to us so that we can record it. Otherwise God richly bless you. I wish you a very uh nice Sunday and best for the rest of your week. My redeemer [singing] is faithful and true. Everything he said he will do. Every morning [singing and music] is on you. Our redeemer [singing] is faithful and true &gt;&gt; shall rise on our feet. Praise the Lord. We appreciate the minister for that. [applause] Brother Kane, God bless you so much. We are grateful and so glad to have you. Shall we bow our heads and we pray? Precious Lord Jesus, Father, we thank you for this moment. We thank you Lord for this day thou has spoken to our hearts. Lord, we thank you Lord Jesus Christ for being such a wonderful father that even this morning you have reminded us Lord [music] of where we came from and father of who we are. And Lord Jesus, we know that this is the message of the hour. For our prophet says that Lord, if the church will know who they are and father, what we stand for, that church be an invisible army. Heaven father, king of glory, we thank you for the vessel you have used this day. And we pray that Lord, may you bless your servant. May you refresh him. King of glory. We pray that may you continue using him in a mighty way. Lord Jesus, bless the Lady, King of Kings. Even the word that has been preached [music] this day, Father, for us here. May it not stop here, Lord Jesus, as your word tells us that we should not only be hearers of the word, but help us be doers of the word, Lord. For even in our nature, we cannot do without you. But we pray that Lord, may you come and be that faith in us, Lord Jesus. As you said in Psalms that the path of the righteous man is like a shining light that shines so brighter and brighter to the glory of the day. We pray that may this word increase our faith. Help us Lord Jesus even as we are leaving this place is our prayer and our desire that Lord you bless each one of us. You are the Lord of life ahead of us and you undo all the plants of the devil. May you go ahead of each one of us Lord Jesus. Remove all the barriers Lord the snares that the enemy has placed father in front of us Lord. May the pillar of fire this afternoon divide himself Lord by each one of us Lord Jesus Christ. Remember our pastor we trust Lord receive him this week Lord Jesus. We pray that may you give him the grace Lord to be safe back home Lord. Father King of Kings we pray for the ministers of this church and the entire body of Christ wherever they are. Father, we pray for the family of our brother Kennedy. Lord, may we pray that Lord, may you bless them as well and this fellowship, King of glory. We thank you, Father, King of Kings, even for those who have not come this day. [music] May you give them the grace. Heaven Father, bless each one of us. In the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. [applause] Ah, amen. May the Lord bless you. Yeah, maybe before we leave. Amen. God bless you, brother. May God bless you all. I believe you you've all been blessed. Have you enjoyed the word today? Has the Lord been good? [applause] Amen. We really appreciate the Lord for our precious brother Ken. Amen. He has really been a blessing. So you are dismissed. Let's sing this song. Yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot. How many are saying that uh the brother should take our greetings to the church the other side? [applause] Yeah. So, brother Ken, I'm really sorry, but kindly take our greetings uh to our brethren, our friends that side, brother Isaac and other brothers and the entire fellowship and your family as well.
