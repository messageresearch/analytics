from [Applause] what the whole world has been waiting for and see you now but we are privileged that we are the people who have seen the end of the world and what the apostles knowing where we [Applause] [Applause] i was preaching on focused faith but here again god is reminding us let us hold the first part without delivering oh sorry in the message the unconditional covenant the prophet says listen you are the covenant people of god movement go to [Applause] [Applause] amen god gave back the spirit to leave the church that's why it is mandatory to every believer filled with the holy spirit god is leading he's not making man to lead his church amen by the holy spirit he's leading the church blessed be the name of the lord it is the holy spirit who blesses us in our position coming before you it is the holy spirit who is the quickening power amen the bible says that later killings send it back you have received it you have got the covenant it is written to you by god now that you have received it amen are you a covenant when you realize who you are amen but when god looks at you he looks at the blood of jesus christ absolutely and what makes the devil not to understand that satanic achievement should be together the perspective is looking at you yes the name of the lord amen to make him more i don't know how i can see you to make him more mad amen blessed in the name of the lord come here because we are redeemed by the blood of messiahs amen i mean so we have we are the children of god you have something special to share with us that's why we ought to come running but god the is [Applause] gather together [Music] to others and the devil tells you you're standing there you don't even need to go to church you are finished you are nobody and i'm here to tell you i'm here to tell you challenge that never amen man blessed be the name of the lord come here but we are child of god god is not blaming you because you have faith because when you face you remain down see amen but remember [Applause] [Music] he said you are not he said you are sons and daughters of god. and the truth is not in heaven can turn that way blessed be the name of the lord amen that that is in us faith because the bible tells us which was in god the deity of jesus christ my life [Music] amen let us go back to that scripture let's all fast the profession of our faith okay 24 and let us consider one another to provoke and to love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of our soul together as the manner of some is but exalting one another and so much the more as you see that they are pushing [Applause] funny even when you're outside is there never been where were you still you are identified if you try to live like the rest of the world amen amen you will try but you will not come perfect like the way they do in the world in the name of the lord amen so what do we need tonight because the teacher traitor you need to know where we are yes we are living in him that's longer than we think yes sir we have no more time to watch the future we are the people holding the rapture we are not here but we must stay focused [Music] the price was so big in the messenger the cruelty of sin over what community and what did he do what it takes to drive sin out of our lives [Applause] just like the devil that's italian word amen amen that never had to see you when you are in and my brother if you relax you just come with a small touch in darkness amen if you light a small touch in darkness even amen light will not darkness will not uh overtake you jesus the bible tells me i believe god made them out of the church people realize who they are and what they are position and what they are positionally never knowing but my influence comes from the kingdom of god there are two kingdoms in this world i'm not talking and you must be influenced from these two kings if i'm catholic then you will have to overcome the world it says if we can get if uh if we can get a scare out of the child what [Music] tomorrow and the christian asked themselves what is happening amen and they had to answer themselves by saying they are amen amen amen we have the ark of the colonies is [Applause] is [Applause] amen we shall cast out demons and will take the maybe 21 days uh christopher is 60 days president ukraine then amen i but the mother will bear with him

feathers then the mother will tell you we come out with them your father jesus knows oh [Applause] yes amen amen [Applause] amen he will remove the comforts blessed be the name of the lord in the message desperation the prophet says when we are in problem will never leave your house [Applause] that they have wings because sometimes they think it is just for decoration then it will use the wing to cover the other one thinking about the there is something much better than just being warm if you are watching there is something much better than just being is amen amen we're not still there see

your seats for just a moment just want to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ i did not expect that i would make it to church today i was telling the brothers i probably need some rest for a few days i couldn't even wear my suit today nobody stole another suit today i was too tired for it but but also they i was we had four days of meetings and i thought initially that i had a backup plan i thought that brother elder brother charles of mata would be helping and so after the preaching we had agreed with the past that you will be taking we will be alternating the services either i take morning it takes afternoon i check afternoon tax morning now this is the numbers so for uh meetings sometimes [Music] fellowship and speaking to ministers uh at one time we had uh a little more than 500 people gathered in the same place there are no speakers or microphones like this the brothers they took with me helped me to distribute their books and to drive sometimes i did most of the driving because of the bad roads never said it be more comfortable so but the lord was good in all name of your name will come ali so you will get the full report on the videos for the first time i think i will prepare a video uh a presentation to show you to show the whole channel too to go away without everybody [Music] i was telling one brother that some ministers in other countries they take a leave for some several days or weeks and then they you know pray and and you know go out family you're part of the family family and then they come back and refresh never come along but i was telling him that here in uganda if uh one pastor was to do that i think many many would judge him and say the pastor is becoming cannon but uh i think one of these days i'll do it i hope not no one will say that i'm not he said you don't realize that you were overworking yourself until you get above 50. a little longer so you need to pray for me i i hope that you people love me and pray for me to appreciate that um before we we give our offerings i also wanted to now announce to you i'll announce it on sunday but to those of you who are here uh we are having a visiting minister so you know mueller is again during the weekend of 22nd weekend you'll be with us uh from around 18 to then to the new for the following week for just one week uh some of you already know him brother timothy has been here before i don't think in this fellowship but he has been in uganda before and also in europe he's a son to brother john anders but john anders is the pastor of anti-messenger in uh in in washington zumba we can say anytime tabanoko in washington and uh they are great friends to us uh actually i think his first service to preach was for us but now the lord is really using him in many countries and we trust that you'll be a blessing too so uh also the wedding of uh brother uh brother o'kello olugando i'd like to give him an opportunity to come and give us the because i had people complaining we don't know nothing we don't know anything so brother come nowhere to manipulate i did not have it written here so uh just for you to clarify you need to know the dates of this uh the traditional ceremony and the dates of the wedding god bless you since it's gracious to speak to you this evening i know last time pastor i clarified on this the very engagement day and previously the introduction was slated for 26. and the wedding is slated for 28th of this month [Music] and then the wedding was slated 28th when we made some adjustments but rather we saw the introduction taking 28th of this month and then the wedding 4th of june but we've been having changes overall and um as i've been waiting with pastor what the truth when he was in karamoja where he's been having communications with the church in toronto is when he talked to me and he told me basically on his condition he's not having good attachment with the dick on board [Music] and i've not been able to carry out some activities as usual you know that we have to make invitation cards oh yes the conclusion is the wedding is coming back to kampala come away this church 4th of june yes and they they would love to come and attend the wedding too so that is what i have not yet communicated to the church so god bless you come on amen i mean so you've had that is the the introduction ceremonies on 28th focus and the word in sorority and to those of you who know sorority sister sarah their home is just right opposite at the at the airport they flying school there is opposition
