[37:25] the uh
[37:32] the church book in the figurement age
[37:48] and we are where you stop
[38:10] let me try to see if i can get it here
[38:52] okay so
[38:58] have you noticed during rally
[39:05] all right i just uh played from what we
[39:07] stopped last time and then we can be
[39:09] able to
[39:10] pick up our discussions i know there are
[39:12] some questions that were said to me but
[39:13] i never really had the time
[39:15] to review them because they were sent to
[39:16] me a bit late
[39:21] but i'll be looking at it as we are
[39:23] listening to this and then we can also
[39:26] go through them
[39:49] okay
[39:52] i'm good to go
[39:56] 22 17
[39:58] and the spirit and the bride say come
[40:01] and let him that heareth say come
[40:04] see the bride speaks the same word as
[40:05] does the spirit she is a word bride
[40:08] proving she has the spirit
[40:10] in every church age we hear these words
[40:13] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[40:16] the spirit saith unto the churches
[40:18] the spirit gives the word
[40:21] if you have the spirit you will hear the
[40:22] word for your age as those true
[40:24] christians took the word for their age
[40:27] did you get that last thought
[40:29] i repeat
[40:30] every church age ends with the same
[40:33] admonition
[40:34] he that hath an ear let him an
[40:36] individual hear what the spirit sayeth
[40:38] to the churches
[40:40] the spirit gives the word
[40:42] he has the truth for each age
[40:44] each age has had its own elect and that
[40:46] elect group always heard the word and
[40:48] received it proving they have the seed
[40:50] in them john 8 47
[40:53] and he that is of god heareth god's
[40:55] words ye therefore hear them not because
[40:58] he are not of god
[41:00] they refused the word jesus and his
[41:03] words for their days but the true seed
[41:05] received the word because they were of
[41:07] god
[41:08] and all thy children shall be taught of
[41:10] god
[41:11] holy spirit isaiah 54 13
[41:15] jesus said the same thing in john 6 45
[41:18] being one with the word proves whether
[41:20] you are of god and spirit filled no
[41:23] other criterion
[41:25] but what are tongues and interpretation
[41:27] and the other gifts they are
[41:28] manifestations
[41:30] that is what the word teaches
[41:32] read it in first corinthians 12 7
[41:35] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[41:37] given to every man to profit with all
[41:40] then paul names being one with the word
[41:43] proves whether you are of god and spirit
[41:45] filled no other criterion but what are
[41:48] tongues and interpretation and the other
[41:50] gifts they are manifestations
[41:53] that is what the word teaches
[41:55] read it in first corinthians 12 7
[41:58] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[42:00] given to every man to profit with all
[42:03] then paul names those manifestations
[42:06] now comes this very good question i know
[42:08] that you are all anxious to ask
[42:11] why isn't the manifestation and evidence
[42:13] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[42:15] because you surely could not manifest
[42:17] the holy ghost unless you truly were
[42:18] spirit filled
[42:20] now i wish i could say that is right
[42:22] because i don't like to hurt people or
[42:24] walk on their doctrine but i wouldn't be
[42:26] a true servant of god if i didn't tell
[42:28] you the whole council of god
[42:30] that is right is it not
[42:32] just let us take a little look at balaam
[42:34] he was religious he worshipped god he
[42:37] understood the proper method of
[42:38] sacrificing and approaching unto god but
[42:41] he was not a true seed prophet for he
[42:43] took the wages of unrighteousness and
[42:46] worst of all he led the people of god
[42:48] into sins of fornication and idolatry
[42:50] yet who would dare to deny that the
[42:52] spirit of god manifested through him in
[42:54] one of the most beautiful portions of
[42:56] absolutely accurate prophecy the world
[42:58] has ever seen
[43:00] but he never had the holy ghost
[43:02] now then what do you think of caiaphas
[43:04] the high priest
[43:06] the bible says that he prophesied the
[43:08] kind of death the lord should die
[43:10] we all know there is no record of him
[43:12] being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man
[43:14] like dear old simeon or that sweet saint
[43:17] called anna
[43:18] yet he had a genuine manifestation of
[43:20] the holy ghost we can't deny that
[43:23] so where is manifestation as an evidence
[43:25] it isn't there
[43:26] if you are truly filled with the spirit
[43:28] of god you will have the evidence of the
[43:30] word in your life
[43:32] let's show you how deeply i feel and
[43:34] understand this truth by a revelation
[43:38] now that is something i wanted to
[43:40] uh quote out of what brother banner has
[43:43] been emphasizing
[43:45] on this paragraph
[43:48] can i have the screen hack please
[43:51] now
[43:52] in this paragraph
[43:54] he indicates that
[43:56] the manifestation
[44:00] is not
[44:02] confirmation
[44:03] that one person
[44:05] is filled
[44:07] with the holocaust
[44:09] how many understand that
[44:11] all right
[44:13] manifestation is not proof
[44:15] that you are filled
[44:18] with what a ghost
[44:20] but many people again go on the contrary
[44:23] to say
[44:24] or to teach that manifestation is not of
[44:27] god
[44:30] have you seen any way yes since we have
[44:32] started reading the church edible
[44:35] have you seen anywhere in this
[44:38] church edible where brother banh has one
[44:41] time
[44:43] spoken against manifestations
[44:47] if you remember tell us
[44:48] have you seen it anyway
[44:51] nowhere at all
[44:52] as a matter of fact
[44:54] in this church book
[44:56] brother banham's emphasis
[44:58] is on the word and the manifestation of
[45:01] the spirit
[45:04] but now you need to understand
[45:07] that the church edge book is meant
[45:10] by the bottom
[45:11] his intention was the intention of the
[45:13] holy spirit to have him do this was for
[45:17] an outreach
[45:19] whereby this book would go
[45:21] all over the world among the theologians
[45:24] those who are not the theologians among
[45:25] whoever so that they can be able to read
[45:28] the revelations
[45:30] of god in our generation because
[45:33] this book
[45:34] has a compilation of every teaching that
[45:37] we believe and teaching this message
[45:40] all the message
[45:42] doctrines are in this book
[45:46] not our church money not
[45:47] misunderstanding
[45:48] we don't have a church man
[45:50] okay
[45:51] but i said all the major teachings that
[45:54] are taught in this message are in the
[45:56] church
[45:58] are you following me yes
[46:00] now
[46:04] i i want you to uh follow me can you
[46:07] please set that up
[46:10] make sure there's no sound at all
[46:13] okay now uh
[46:18] okay
[46:19] i wonder if you can
[46:22] if you can still hear me
[46:24] can i be hard
[46:27] because i'm not quite sure
[46:30] whether i can still be hard i don't know
[46:32] if i'm getting again here
[46:35] can someone here try and tell me
[46:38] the ones online are taking quite long
[46:39] tell me whether i can still be honest
[46:50] yes hello can you hear me
[47:09] okay so
[47:11] since uh sarah arquello i say you are
[47:14] connected here since the peace
[47:16] i really wanted to know whether or not
[47:19] you can hear me
[47:29] yes
[47:32] okay what about now is the volume fine
[47:41] is it fine now
[47:51] okay if you tell me that the volume is
[47:54] fine then we can continue
[47:58] oh yeah but you know
[48:00] but that that was a few minutes ago
[48:02] maybe not now
[48:07] okay
[48:08] is the volume fine now
[48:20] people are getting problems using this
[48:22] technology
[48:23] it takes quite a long
[48:36] okay
[48:38] for whatever reason our volumizer let me
[48:40] try to see
[48:42] if i can make it better
[48:47] okay do you think that that is better or
[48:50] it is worse
[48:54] is that better
[49:04] um
[49:42] technology
[49:52] we're having issues today
[49:54] let me try to see
[49:56] if you can be able to adjust it
[50:03] oh yeah it's quite low
[50:14] i wonder now can i be hard
[50:27] i think that should be fine
[50:28] what do you think
[50:30] yes
[50:31] yes
[50:38] okay forgive us for the low volume
[50:42] really forgive us
[50:45] i also see those who are on youtube you
[50:47] need to let us know
[50:49] whether it is well now
[50:59] okay
[51:00] shall we proceed
[51:16] so
[51:16] i was explaining a point here that i
[51:19] think is very important for us not to
[51:21] just bypass and go and go on without
[51:23] explaining it yes
[51:25] [Music]
[51:26] you see
[51:28] brother banham in this portion
[51:30] is trying to
[51:32] emphasize
[51:34] that
[51:37] they prove
[51:39] the evidence
[51:41] that someone has is filled with the holy
[51:43] spirit
[51:44] is not because they manifested
[51:48] the spirit
[51:50] and this of course is offensive to our
[51:53] friends that mental customs
[51:55] because they'll be like how come that
[51:56] you can manifest he himself he says it
[51:58] down up here did he read it yes
[52:02] he says why isn't the manifestation and
[52:05] evidence of being baptized with the holy
[52:07] ghost because you surely know
[52:10] you because you surely could not
[52:11] manifest the holy ghost unless you truly
[52:14] wear
[52:16] spirit filled they say
[52:18] now i wish i could say that is right but
[52:20] i don't like to hurt people or walk on
[52:23] their doctrine but of course it's going
[52:24] to do just that
[52:26] but i would i wouldn't be a true servant
[52:29] of god if i didn't tell you the world
[52:30] cancer
[52:32] of god that's right is it not
[52:34] now and then it goes ahead to tell you
[52:37] manifestation is not the proof you have
[52:42] the
[52:44] holy spirit in your soul
[52:49] he gives you an actual example actually
[52:51] one he gives you two examples here the
[52:54] first example
[52:55] being that of caiaphas
[52:58] and the other example being that of
[53:00] balance
[53:01] how many remember who balaam was
[53:05] yes you know who balaam was billy paul
[53:07] who was born
[53:11] okay you don't know and yet you raised
[53:13] up your hand who was bottom
[53:31] okay we don't want to call him a first
[53:33] prophet really because actually even
[53:34] what he prophesied was true okay
[53:37] but we want to say that he was not
[53:39] filled with all of us because he had a
[53:41] gift of prophecy it was a manifestation
[53:43] a true manifestation but he as a man in
[53:46] himself he was not changed he was still
[53:48] having the lust for the money he was
[53:50] still having the lust for those things
[53:52] of the world he was still having lust
[53:54] for gold lust for that you know the man
[53:56] was not changed but the man had a right
[53:58] gift
[53:59] he had the right manifestation but he
[54:01] himself was not changed so it is true
[54:04] and possible for someone to preach and
[54:06] many people go to heaven and forgive he
[54:08] goes to heaven
[54:09] it is true and possible for someone to
[54:12] sing out of the anointing and go to hell
[54:15] it is possible for someone to speak
[54:16] thanks and and go to hell it is possible
[54:19] for someone you understand and therefore
[54:21] went by the banner listen to me
[54:23] everybody
[54:25] that's what when brother banham said it
[54:26] is what some people use
[54:28] in a wrong way
[54:30] when they say that you can still be feel
[54:32] you can still have the holy spirit every
[54:34] day of your life and still go to hell
[54:36] that's what it meant can we get it i saw
[54:39] that they put they posted it on the
[54:41] group and some of you started to beat
[54:43] yourselves then but
[54:45] that was actually true but the balaam
[54:47] says it all right so you need to be told
[54:50] right so that you can know can you get
[54:51] me that quote brother if you can get it
[54:53] to me then it will save me my time here
[54:54] of looking looking for it
[54:59] hallelujah
[55:02] okay
[55:03] let me find my phone here
[55:19] okay did someone find it brother did you
[55:21] find it
[55:24] that you can be baptized with the holy
[55:25] spirit or filled with the whole spirit
[55:27] every day of your life or you can have
[55:28] the holy spirit video of your life
[55:30] and still
[55:32] go
[55:33] to here
[55:40] by the time did you get it
[55:43] okay you will find that i'm talking
[55:45] now
[55:46] why would he do that why would he say
[55:48] that
[55:50] to some they have thought he meant that
[55:55] he meant
[55:56] he meant what we have been talking about
[55:58] here that if you don't have the holy
[56:00] spirit you will go to heaven
[56:01] that's not actually what he meant
[56:04] and uh
[56:08] let me get down i'm realizing that some
[56:10] are even confused while i'm talking so i
[56:12] need to get that quote right away
[56:23] okay
[56:37] okay someone online can you send it to
[56:39] us
[56:56] hmm
[57:03] allow me to take my time and get this
[57:05] quote for you
[57:12] is every day of your life
[57:49] my mind i can't find the question are
[57:51] you watching that chat group are you
[57:53] sure
[57:54] university
[58:08] for some reason
[58:09] maybe i'm using the wrong heat words but
[58:11] uh
[58:13] i'm not getting it as fast as i thought
[58:15] i would so
[58:17] but none of you is also trying
[58:19] you don't have the table on your phone
[58:24] friends just come on it's a bible study
[58:27] huh
[58:28] pull up your phone you get search those
[58:31] words on your job
[58:54] no
[59:13] some more about it
[59:22] what does it say
[59:24] are you ready for us
[59:28] the choice of your conduct
[59:30] you pull
[59:31] you can't mix it now
[59:33] you are either for god or against god
[59:36] and the outward expression shows exactly
[59:40] what's on the inside see
[59:44] the call cover
[59:46] many of you think i got the baptism of
[59:48] the holy ghost i am going to heaven
[59:51] that don't mean one thing that you are
[59:54] going to heaven
[59:55] no sir
[59:58] you can have the baptism of the holy
[1:00:00] ghost every hour in your life and still
[1:00:03] be lost and go to hell
[1:00:07] the bible says so
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] you believe that do you believe that
[1:00:16] yes
[1:00:19] do you believe that
[1:00:21] did you believe
[1:00:22] the message of this generation yes
[1:00:24] so do you believe his message to be true
[1:00:27] so do you believe this
[1:00:28] yes
[1:00:30] i believe it without my heart
[1:00:32] but you see you need to believe it with
[1:00:33] understanding
[1:00:35] okay and that's why i thought i should
[1:00:38] bring this up and connect it with this
[1:00:41] quote here
[1:00:43] in this quote by the banana is not
[1:00:45] trying to say
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:50] that
[1:00:52] you must not have manifestations
[1:00:55] okay i want us to separate things here
[1:00:58] i want us to separate
[1:01:00] the manifestation
[1:01:03] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:06] or the feeling of the holy ghost
[1:01:09] and
[1:01:11] the believing
[1:01:12] okay
[1:01:14] you believe
[1:01:16] but you don't have
[1:01:18] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:21] are you following
[1:01:22] me and by the bottom here gives us two
[1:01:26] examples
[1:01:29] of chi of us
[1:01:31] and who else
[1:01:35] these two people
[1:01:36] had the manifestation
[1:01:40] of the spirit
[1:01:43] and you cannot have the manifestation of
[1:01:46] the spirit
[1:01:49] without the anointing of the spirit
[1:01:54] you get the point
[1:01:57] there are certain things you can't fake
[1:01:58] by yourself
[1:02:01] you see people jumping up and down
[1:02:03] speaking tongues and falling down and
[1:02:05] you know those things
[1:02:07] you can't
[1:02:08] well there are some people who who know
[1:02:10] who are very good comedians and
[1:02:13] they can know how to fix such but i
[1:02:15] wouldn't even
[1:02:16] really know why you faked that
[1:02:18] i don't know why you would why you would
[1:02:20] want to fake that but i know some people
[1:02:22] can't but
[1:02:24] some of these things even we see it in
[1:02:27] abundance among the pentecostal world
[1:02:29] today
[1:02:30] you know they speaking in tongues the
[1:02:32] prophecy they they come on
[1:02:36] the manifestation
[1:02:38] about the manifestations what happens
[1:02:40] yeah you don't tell yourself to dream a
[1:02:43] dream just come to hell the vision
[1:02:46] you know all designated spirits all
[1:02:47] these things
[1:02:50] yeah the gift of healing and you know
[1:02:51] you can't fake that if it has happened
[1:02:53] it has happened there are people out
[1:02:55] there who have a gift i don't know if
[1:02:57] they're in here also can just place
[1:03:00] their hands on you pray and ask for your
[1:03:01] reading and you'll be healed immediately
[1:03:04] and each of you actually must have that
[1:03:07] each of us must have that
[1:03:08] because it belongs to us
[1:03:11] hallelujah
[1:03:13] now
[1:03:14] let me not veer off from the point let
[1:03:15] me follow this line this thin line so
[1:03:17] you can be able to get this even if you
[1:03:19] got this and you really got it well i
[1:03:21] would say that our day has been fruitful
[1:03:24] okay
[1:03:26] so now
[1:03:27] you can manifest those things but it
[1:03:30] does not mean that you are
[1:03:32] baptized with the holy ghost
[1:03:34] but you can say this the version of the
[1:03:35] world says yes sir
[1:03:37] but it doesn't mean you're baptized with
[1:03:38] the holy ghost so what confusing us know
[1:03:42] about confusing you there are three you
[1:03:44] are three in one that's right can you
[1:03:47] say i'm three in one
[1:03:49] come on say it lovely
[1:03:52] live in one one
[1:03:54] body god bless you two
[1:04:01] here
[1:04:02] is that you can be baptized with the
[1:04:04] holy ghost every day of your life on
[1:04:06] your body and on your spirit and you
[1:04:09] still go to hell
[1:04:12] but if you baptize the horribles in your
[1:04:15] soul as a sin
[1:04:18] it is there and you cannot be lost
[1:04:23] now
[1:04:24] people who have the baptism of the
[1:04:26] spirit of god on their soul and on their
[1:04:29] spirit
[1:04:30] or rather on their spirit they put it
[1:04:32] that way on their spirit
[1:04:33] they can be able
[1:04:35] to
[1:04:36] manifest all these gifts
[1:04:38] because actually by the time i say when
[1:04:40] you receive a new spirit
[1:04:42] it can be able to
[1:04:44] link up if you can get me that quote
[1:04:45] also quickly
[1:04:48] brother can you
[1:04:50] find that quote there
[1:04:52] oh you have gotten this one right you
[1:04:54] want to leadership
[1:04:56] can you project it oh you didn't get it
[1:04:58] yes you wanted
[1:05:01] me just straight
[1:05:03] yes that one can you project it so so
[1:05:05] that the others can also see it if they
[1:05:07] do not get it as uh we will find this
[1:05:10] one as well he says that uh
[1:05:12] what did i want to say
[1:05:31] you have it right there
[1:05:54] okay
[1:05:56] i'm going to take my time because what
[1:05:58] i'm teaching now is a very sensitive
[1:06:00] part
[1:06:02] and i need us to be able to see that
[1:06:04] thin thin line
[1:06:06] oh brother uh should i quit relying on
[1:06:08] you so i can just use mine here
[1:06:11] you're taking quite long i did not want
[1:06:13] to change this but i think i might have
[1:06:15] to
[1:06:17] so that's
[1:06:30] uh yeah but uh
[1:06:34] you are
[1:06:35] okay now i'll just uh
[1:06:41] okay this is the first one we range yes
[1:06:43] i put it up a little bit
[1:06:49] let this warm up
[1:07:01] brother martin can you please scroll up
[1:07:08] okay
[1:07:09] all right i think
[1:07:12] everybody cannot see that
[1:07:14] okay now you allow me to project this
[1:07:20] okay can we read together
[1:07:24] notice
[1:07:25] you you put a new spirit
[1:07:28] god has to give you a new spirit
[1:07:31] or you couldn't even get along with you
[1:07:34] have you heard that
[1:07:35] now you can't get along with yourself
[1:07:37] that's all there for spirit
[1:07:39] you had in you
[1:07:41] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[1:07:44] so you can get along
[1:07:45] with his
[1:07:47] spirit
[1:07:48] now remember the new spirit is not the
[1:07:50] holy spirit but the new spirit is your
[1:07:53] new
[1:07:54] spirit but guess what it is put there by
[1:07:58] god no but by
[1:08:00] god by
[1:08:02] the spirit
[1:08:04] it's a new spirit it is put there by god
[1:08:06] half physically
[1:08:08] by
[1:08:09] his spirit okay but actually it is your
[1:08:12] spirit
[1:08:13] are you following me yes you know if you
[1:08:16] you are like cussing drinking smoking
[1:08:22] yeah
[1:08:23] speaking of what yes
[1:08:26] yeah
[1:08:27] abusive
[1:08:28] yeah being abusive
[1:08:30] you know
[1:08:31] you know speaking with having the
[1:08:32] language uh your mouth is like vaga you
[1:08:36] know the things of the world uh
[1:08:39] you're not ashamed of them you know and
[1:08:42] then
[1:08:43] you know the way you are speaking the
[1:08:44] way you are behaving the way you are
[1:08:46] dressing the way you are you know
[1:08:47] because of that old spirit which you had
[1:08:50] it had the appetite for the things that
[1:08:52] are aware of the world so even yourself
[1:08:54] sometimes you'll feel depressed you'll
[1:08:56] feel bad you'll feel funny you'll feel
[1:08:58] you know you would even feel bad about
[1:09:00] yourself you always feel you know you
[1:09:01] can't get along with yourself even
[1:09:03] that's why people commit suicide you
[1:09:05] know because of that old spirit that old
[1:09:07] nature which is in them
[1:09:09] now
[1:09:09] you can't even get along with yourself
[1:09:11] without without all spirit how do you
[1:09:13] think you can get along with god by the
[1:09:14] bottom says so what does it do for you
[1:09:18] he gives he puts
[1:09:19] he says so he got to put a new spirit in
[1:09:22] you so you can get along with his
[1:09:26] spirit
[1:09:27] i'll put a new spirit in them this is in
[1:09:30] ezekiel
[1:09:31] and i'll put my spirit in them he said
[1:09:34] after he's given you a new spirit that
[1:09:36] is you
[1:09:37] don't get it confused with god's spirit
[1:09:39] it is not it is you and you
[1:09:43] so you can get along with this
[1:09:47] now if he ever gives it to you
[1:09:51] please
[1:09:52] i hope i'm presenting it right
[1:09:55] he says that uh
[1:09:57] if when he gives you a new spirit
[1:10:00] so you've got a new spirit before you
[1:10:02] get a holy the holy spirit
[1:10:05] now when you get
[1:10:07] then then the new spirit it will help
[1:10:10] you to get along with the holy spirit if
[1:10:13] god ever gives you the holy spirit so it
[1:10:17] means you can actually have a new spirit
[1:10:19] without
[1:10:20] the holy spirit and what will the new
[1:10:23] spirit make you do
[1:10:24] the new spirit will make you to easily
[1:10:27] get along with the holy ghost
[1:10:30] but that doesn't mean you have the holy
[1:10:32] ghost
[1:10:34] mark that
[1:10:37] what does a man who can easily get along
[1:10:40] with the holy ghost do
[1:10:44] when do you sing a song you only need to
[1:10:46] do this
[1:10:49] bless the lord oh everybody in that
[1:10:53] place in here who had a new spirit you
[1:10:55] had something already clicking in you
[1:10:58] and you feel like oh i i i
[1:11:00] want to sing that oh i want to share i
[1:11:02] want to worship the lord you know yes
[1:11:05] but if you have no new spirit you'll be
[1:11:07] like ah
[1:11:08] that's what i mean
[1:11:10] you know
[1:11:11] but if you have any spirit you will
[1:11:12] immediately sink in
[1:11:15] when people begin to shout and they're
[1:11:16] aiming to hold on to drop their hands
[1:11:18] and jump around even if that's doing
[1:11:20] them anyhow it's automatic why because
[1:11:22] you have a new
[1:11:23] seriousness you easily get along with
[1:11:26] him when he moves
[1:11:28] when he comes down and he takes your
[1:11:30] hand you don't say ah leave me you don't
[1:11:32] act like a god you act like a
[1:11:34] because you already have a new spirit
[1:11:37] within you to get along
[1:11:39] with him when he shows up you understand
[1:11:43] but don't make a mistake that is not
[1:11:45] dead
[1:11:47] and when that is on you when you have a
[1:11:49] new spirit and you easily get along with
[1:11:52] him so he can calm down and he can even
[1:11:54] use you like that donkey
[1:11:57] that was with bottom that's right
[1:11:59] you remember when they were oh glory to
[1:12:01] god
[1:12:04] when god came down and balaam was there
[1:12:07] and paul was going to curse the people
[1:12:10] of god
[1:12:11] what did god tell him
[1:12:13] he said don't go
[1:12:15] you put him here
[1:12:16] no
[1:12:17] he did not hear he refused
[1:12:20] he said i'll go and cast them
[1:12:24] because of the money which they had put
[1:12:25] in front of him
[1:12:30] now badam started out to go as he was
[1:12:33] going to go and cast the people of god
[1:12:37] the angel of god appeared
[1:12:39] but because ah
[1:12:41] was blinded
[1:12:43] because balaam did not have the holy
[1:12:46] spirit
[1:12:47] to design the things of god
[1:12:51] at this time at this moment
[1:12:54] he was now
[1:12:56] having his eyes on the money
[1:12:58] so that's why people within his spirit
[1:12:59] but without their holy spirit are very
[1:13:01] very dangerous
[1:13:02] because they are confusing sometimes
[1:13:04] sometimes they act like they
[1:13:07] it is
[1:13:08] god is truly using them
[1:13:10] and sometimes they act like the devil is
[1:13:12] truly using them
[1:13:14] is the same one who came
[1:13:16] and and uh prophesy to the children of
[1:13:20] israel very good things
[1:13:22] and then he came here and spoke with
[1:13:25] king balak
[1:13:26] and he was very and they were cutting
[1:13:27] the idea of
[1:13:30] you know getting the money and going to
[1:13:31] cars
[1:13:33] he was double dealing
[1:13:35] people with a newspaper but without the
[1:13:37] horribles can beat our dealers
[1:13:39] when they go they behave like vultures
[1:13:41] sometimes
[1:13:43] when they go in the wild they eat
[1:13:46] when they come in the church oh wow
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:51] you know
[1:13:53] what is happening
[1:13:54] they are just having a new speech but
[1:13:56] they are not they have not gone all the
[1:13:58] way you gotta point they have not yet
[1:14:00] received a seal
[1:14:03] god has not yet been
[1:14:06] able
[1:14:06] to
[1:14:08] to
[1:14:09] to put his seal on them he is up on them
[1:14:11] to say i own this one
[1:14:13] he's saying that you still have a way to
[1:14:15] go
[1:14:16] so he can hold you you still have the
[1:14:18] lust and the desires of the world he
[1:14:19] can't own you that way
[1:14:22] so
[1:14:23] these people can be able to even speak
[1:14:25] tons and to prophesy
[1:14:27] but they don't have their
[1:14:29] holy spirit
[1:14:31] if god
[1:14:33] as balaam was going and he was blinded
[1:14:36] he wouldn't even see the angel because
[1:14:37] of the blind in the spiritual blindness
[1:14:40] but the
[1:14:41] donkey was it a donkey yes he saw the
[1:14:44] angel
[1:14:45] and it stopped
[1:14:47] and but but i'm told it what is wrong
[1:14:50] with you why are you dreaming me can't
[1:14:52] wait
[1:14:54] the dog was like my master
[1:14:57] why are you beating me
[1:14:59] i thought they ever disobeyed you
[1:15:02] can't you see the one who is in front of
[1:15:03] us
[1:15:05] balaam because he was too blind that he
[1:15:07] didn't even
[1:15:08] get shocked that this don't be speaking
[1:15:10] to you
[1:15:11] imagine if that again started speaking
[1:15:12] to you
[1:15:14] and then you are like
[1:15:16] ah go away
[1:15:17] like your mind is focused on something
[1:15:19] that you can't even see this is a
[1:15:21] miracle
[1:15:22] how can a dog speak but i'm almost that
[1:15:25] blind so blinded that you cannot see
[1:15:28] that's how this better cause as many of
[1:15:29] them are so blind that you bring the
[1:15:31] world they can't see their worthy but
[1:15:34] they are like the spirit like that man
[1:15:35] women spirit
[1:15:37] you can't see the word of the day
[1:15:40] [Applause]
[1:15:42] you know you understand
[1:15:44] they feel they so they think they are
[1:15:45] rich but actually they are blinded
[1:15:48] because of the things that never
[1:15:50] presented before them
[1:15:53] okay there's a thin line here
[1:15:55] and that's why i'm taking my time
[1:15:56] because i wanted by the time by the end
[1:15:58] i present by the time i end up
[1:16:00] presenting this i want you to see it
[1:16:01] very clearly so you can be grounded very
[1:16:03] well on this
[1:16:05] now
[1:16:07] the donkey continued to speak and these
[1:16:09] guys continue to slap it
[1:16:12] and they don't have to bypass the angel
[1:16:14] to continue going
[1:16:16] but here is my point the donkey
[1:16:18] prophesied
[1:16:22] the dog is fought in times
[1:16:24] and prophesied
[1:16:27] because that wasn't his language so it's
[1:16:28] times and it's prophesied
[1:16:31] because you spoke a message
[1:16:36] and understand so it spoke in times and
[1:16:38] interpreted that is prophesying
[1:16:41] hallelujah
[1:16:44] so this donkey could do dark tangs and
[1:16:47] interpret them or prophesy
[1:16:49] because a tongue which they have tweeted
[1:16:52] by the battle says it is a prophecy
[1:16:54] but this
[1:16:56] man was so blinded that he couldn't see
[1:16:58] so here is my point now let us leave the
[1:17:00] man alone let us look at the donkey
[1:17:03] i wanted to show you that you don't need
[1:17:05] to be a soul filled with all the gods to
[1:17:08] talk times and prophesy
[1:17:11] this donkey i'm not saying i don't even
[1:17:13] believe it would be the right
[1:17:16] he does not soul at all
[1:17:19] but has a spirit
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:22] it has no soul
[1:17:23] that's why it could
[1:17:26] get anointed to prophesy
[1:17:28] so every human being if you have a new
[1:17:30] spirit of god you can be able to
[1:17:33] prophesy
[1:17:34] you can be able to speak in times you
[1:17:36] can be able to manifest all these gifts
[1:17:38] why
[1:17:39] not because you have the holy ghost but
[1:17:41] simply because
[1:17:43] you have a new spirit and you can easily
[1:17:45] sink in
[1:17:47] with him when he shows up
[1:17:50] when he comes up your spirit is made in
[1:17:53] a way that you can easily receive him
[1:17:56] that's what a new spirit means
[1:17:59] can we now read it in that understanding
[1:18:02] i will put a new spirit in them and i'll
[1:18:04] put my spirit in
[1:18:07] then he said after he's given you a new
[1:18:09] spirit that is you
[1:18:11] don't get it confused with god's spirit
[1:18:14] yes it is not it is your new spirit so
[1:18:17] you can get along with the
[1:18:20] holy spirit
[1:18:21] if he ever gives it to you
[1:18:24] amen now because in your condition
[1:18:28] never get along
[1:18:30] you never get along you can't get along
[1:18:32] with your wife you can't get along with
[1:18:34] your husband you can't get along with
[1:18:36] your neighbor
[1:18:37] yeah even some of you can't get along
[1:18:38] with your siblings yeah
[1:18:41] you always want to fight and disrupt
[1:18:43] each other that's not good because you
[1:18:45] you have that old spirit of yours
[1:18:48] you know which gets angry quickly yeah
[1:18:51] you can't get along with your husband
[1:18:52] you gotta get along with your neighbor
[1:18:53] how are you ever going to get along with
[1:18:55] god so he has to give you a new spirit
[1:18:57] before you can get along with him
[1:19:01] are you following yes
[1:19:04] so he puts a new spirit in you and then
[1:19:07] he puts
[1:19:08] here yes everybody with me and then he
[1:19:11] puts his spirit in you
[1:19:15] gives you a new spirit a new look
[1:19:17] outlook a new faith then he puts his
[1:19:19] holy spirit in hallelujah
[1:19:23] that's what happens
[1:19:25] when he has given you a new spirit and
[1:19:27] prepared your heart prepare your soul to
[1:19:30] receive him and then now he will
[1:19:33] actually i should believe that
[1:19:35] you people should actually begin to
[1:19:37] prophesy and speak talents before you
[1:19:38] even receive the holy ghost
[1:19:40] so if there is no manifestations in your
[1:19:42] life it's a clear sign you you you have
[1:19:45] not even received the holy ghost
[1:19:46] it's a very clear sign
[1:19:51] you have not even received the holy
[1:19:52] ghost
[1:19:53] because
[1:19:54] before you receive the holy ghost you
[1:19:56] receive the new spirit
[1:19:58] and the new spirit
[1:20:00] will
[1:20:00] make it
[1:20:02] possible for you to manifest those gifts
[1:20:05] so if you've not even manifested any of
[1:20:08] those things in your life it is a clear
[1:20:10] sign even in this spirit you might not
[1:20:11] have it
[1:20:13] let right along the holy spirit
[1:20:16] if the word of god comes and they preach
[1:20:18] and you are like a dead rock
[1:20:20] it's a clear sign that you are not even
[1:20:22] going to see the new spirit
[1:20:24] i'm talking some of you here when you're
[1:20:26] mediating on sunday i love that oh i
[1:20:28] wish i wonder when we will have church
[1:20:30] again that's wonderful even as we were
[1:20:33] burning up in the church
[1:20:34] oh i tell you
[1:20:36] we were panicked we were jesus we're
[1:20:38] hollering we were shouting
[1:20:40] why because
[1:20:42] christ had come and when he comes up
[1:20:45] when he gives us his word and the
[1:20:46] brighter jesus is in the world and you
[1:20:48] know you feel you're full with it and
[1:20:50] then you know you can't hurt people to
[1:20:52] shout and clap your hands and dance
[1:20:54] around you know why because it is broken
[1:20:57] down in your heart
[1:20:59] but you see i'll show you that thin line
[1:21:02] that separates
[1:21:03] the pentecostals and the truth in one
[1:21:05] believers
[1:21:06] okay
[1:21:08] and i want to show you more quotes here
[1:21:10] about this before
[1:21:12] many people that spirit that new spirit
[1:21:15] god had given to you and your spirit to
[1:21:17] get along with his spirit well some
[1:21:19] people
[1:21:20] some mean they can't even get along with
[1:21:22] themselves let alone with god if he
[1:21:25] would come that's right so that was so
[1:21:27] doubtful ah and up and down so doubtful
[1:21:30] god has to give you a new spirit god has
[1:21:33] to give you a new nature so you can get
[1:21:34] along with yours
[1:21:36] where
[1:21:38] comes my good lord
[1:21:40] i hope you see
[1:21:41] god gives you a new spirit for yourself
[1:21:43] and then he puts his spirit in there
[1:21:45] amen to dwell with you and to
[1:21:49] and you know what
[1:21:51] and to abide together with you and to
[1:21:52] abide with you all right here's another
[1:21:54] one
[1:21:58] the new spirit it's a new life that has
[1:22:00] nothing that's good but god has to give
[1:22:02] you a new spirit so we can get along
[1:22:04] with his spirit the old spirit you had
[1:22:07] you couldn't get along with yourself let
[1:22:10] alone god the spirit so he puts he gives
[1:22:12] you a new spirit you see
[1:22:16] all right
[1:22:17] one last one here
[1:22:22] and i'll give you a new spirit
[1:22:26] now many times and there has been a
[1:22:28] terrible mistake the people have thought
[1:22:31] uh sometimes that the new spirit was the
[1:22:33] holy spirit but it isn't it's a new
[1:22:35] spirit god gives you a new why you
[1:22:38] couldn't get uh along with yourself with
[1:22:41] your old spirit how how are you going to
[1:22:43] get along with the what goes god had to
[1:22:46] give you a new spirit so you can get
[1:22:47] along with this spirit and sometimes
[1:22:49] people i knew how to i had affliction so
[1:22:52] you will receive it then a new spirit in
[1:22:54] that heart and then i'll put my spirit
[1:22:57] in that he gives you a new heart then he
[1:22:59] puts any spirit in that new heart and
[1:23:01] then he gives you
[1:23:03] the holy spirit
[1:23:04] new heart new spirit and my speech three
[1:23:06] things is pop off
[1:23:08] now many times we try to make a
[1:23:11] that thing just say well as soon as you
[1:23:13] get a new spirit you quit your stealing
[1:23:16] you quit you are lying
[1:23:17] things like that you say oh hallelujah i
[1:23:20] got it
[1:23:21] and you find out the first time you
[1:23:23] anyone crosses your path a little a
[1:23:25] little bit oh must see what a difference
[1:23:28] yeah you know you
[1:23:30] you when you get a little bit like oh
[1:23:39] why it is because you never had the holy
[1:23:41] ghost really you only received a new
[1:23:43] spirit
[1:23:44] and you find out the first time anyone
[1:23:46] crosses your path to say oh my so you
[1:23:48] blow up up like a frog eating back back
[1:23:51] and shout
[1:23:53] someone crosses your path
[1:23:56] you just blow up like a frog eating back
[1:23:58] shot
[1:23:59] but let me tell you brother that is the
[1:24:02] reason you never got godly spirit yeah
[1:24:04] yes that is true oh you say he stepped
[1:24:06] on my toes
[1:24:08] i i'll just not put up with that
[1:24:12] that shows what you got in you that is
[1:24:15] true i will put a new spirit and then
[1:24:17] i'll put my spirit in him
[1:24:20] hallelujah
[1:24:22] now the heart is in the center of the
[1:24:24] emotions of the human being your heart
[1:24:26] is in the middle of you that is exactly
[1:24:28] right so god puts a new heart in the
[1:24:30] middle of the old man then he puts a new
[1:24:32] spirit in the middle of the new spirit
[1:24:34] or heart and puts his spirit in the
[1:24:36] middle of the news
[1:24:38] hallelujah
[1:24:40] what is the name of the lord amen
[1:24:41] actually
[1:24:44] it continues even
[1:24:47] let me see if i can get this one
[1:24:53] okay
[1:24:59] all right let me see there's another
[1:25:00] watch on this that i wanted to to get
[1:25:04] um
[1:25:06] he said when you receive a new spirit
[1:25:15] okay yeah
[1:25:16] now just like i think
[1:25:19] the gifts of the spirit the gifts of the
[1:25:21] spirit is not
[1:25:26] it's the attributes of
[1:25:30] gifts of healing speaking in tongues and
[1:25:32] all those other things are attributes
[1:25:33] it's the fruit that the tree bears so
[1:25:36] the trees is the main thing the holy
[1:25:38] spirit and the holy spirit is god and
[1:25:40] god is
[1:25:42] love and god is
[1:25:44] love hallelujah
[1:25:45] so there is another quote i wanted you
[1:25:47] to see here wherever the banham says
[1:25:49] that
[1:25:50] why would you receive a new spirit you
[1:25:52] receive a new spirit so that those
[1:25:54] things can be able to manifest in your
[1:25:56] life
[1:25:57] hallelujah that's when the shout comes
[1:26:01] yes
[1:26:02] praise the name of the lord
[1:26:04] okay let me find for let me find that
[1:26:06] for you here
[1:26:09] give me a second
[1:26:17] okay
[1:26:20] looks about a new spirit
[1:26:47] oh i wish i'd get this quickly
[1:27:00] okay if i don't get it surely you can be
[1:27:03] able to continue with what you have
[1:27:25] okay let's see if this will address it
[1:27:45] all right uh i i uh
[1:27:48] whenever i tell you to remind me for
[1:27:49] some quote or something you people need
[1:27:51] to someone needs to
[1:27:53] take that up and
[1:27:54] be sure to remind me
[1:27:56] uh okay so
[1:28:00] all right now
[1:28:05] uh i uh
[1:28:07] this isn't what i was trying to find
[1:28:09] again i couldn't find it right now
[1:28:12] so
[1:28:13] how do we proceed
[1:28:15] now i want us to go back to the court
[1:28:16] that we were
[1:28:18] we are on in the pegamon church age
[1:28:22] and
[1:28:24] we try to
[1:28:25] review this
[1:28:31] okay so while we're here
[1:28:39] yeah right here
[1:28:41] oh
[1:28:45] so when he says
[1:28:50] again don't forget the other quote which
[1:28:51] i read for you and it got so many of you
[1:28:53] who lose in your mind that you can how
[1:28:56] did you put it
[1:29:01] i want the words exact words

[1:29:42] yeah i said yeah i got it
[1:29:45] and he says no you haven't got it
[1:29:47] that's the same thing he's trying to
[1:29:48] talk about here
[1:29:50] such a person was receiving the new
[1:29:52] spirit
[1:29:53] you know like

[1:30:29] brother
[1:30:30] that until the day of your redemption
[1:30:33] getting that that quote
[1:30:34] okay as you are getting it let us read
[1:30:36] this again he says that many of you
[1:30:39] think i got the baptism of the holy
[1:30:40] ghost i'm going to heaven that don't
[1:30:42] mean one thing that you're going to hear
[1:30:43] me no sir you can have the baptism of
[1:30:45] the holy ghost every hour in your life
[1:30:48] every hour in your life
[1:30:51] and still be lost and go
[1:30:54] to hell now
[1:30:58] the message and the bible cannot
[1:31:00] contradict
[1:31:02] now the scripture says did you get that
[1:31:04] brother
[1:31:06] okay yes
[1:31:07] go project that for us here
[1:31:10] i'll just remove this in a moment
[1:31:12] okay
[1:31:26] this is a faith there you're welcome
[1:31:28] thank you for being a part of the
[1:31:29] program okay he says here
[1:31:32] ephesians 4 30 and grief
[1:31:34] uh you cast about words
[1:31:37] and give not the holy spirit of god
[1:31:40] whereby ye are sealed until when
[1:31:43] your next revival
[1:31:46] until when you feel that again
[1:31:49] until the point the first person
[1:31:50] finishes
[1:31:56] so friends when you receive that holy
[1:31:58] spirit of god the baptism of the holy
[1:32:01] ghost
[1:32:02] in your soul
[1:32:04] it is one time
[1:32:07] and you are with him until the day of
[1:32:09] redemption it's a clear sign you can
[1:32:11] never be lost
[1:32:12] it's a clear sign you're going in the
[1:32:14] rapture
[1:32:15] you see why you need him yes
[1:32:17] therefore if you are playing around
[1:32:20] if you are playing around and you don't
[1:32:21] receive the holy ghost you are lost
[1:32:25] no matter how much word you do
[1:32:28] okay
[1:32:29] so the holy spirit you receive him one
[1:32:32] time
[1:32:33] in your life
[1:32:35] in your
[1:32:36] soul in your soul
[1:32:41] and
[1:32:42] these other the one he was saying that
[1:32:44] you can have the maximum of the holy
[1:32:46] ghost every hour in your life
[1:32:48] what is he talking about
[1:32:51] he's talking about
[1:32:53] he's not talking about manifestation
[1:32:55] he's talking about the baptism of the
[1:32:56] holy spirit in your
[1:32:58] spirit spirit
[1:33:00] in your spirit
[1:33:02] that's what brings the manifestations
[1:33:07] as we have already covered that
[1:33:09] and that one can come in and go coming
[1:33:11] and go coming and go depending on the
[1:33:13] weather and the spiritual environment
[1:33:16] you know
[1:33:17] you remember how one day brother soul he
[1:33:20] was moving around around it and god came
[1:33:23] and they spoke to him through someone he
[1:33:25] said you are going to receive a sign
[1:33:27] that a sign which will show you that you
[1:33:28] are the right king of israel or this
[1:33:30] this is the first king of israel
[1:33:34] do you know the sign that god gave him
[1:33:36] he said that when you go among the
[1:33:37] prophets when you reach the sons of the
[1:33:38] prophets
[1:33:40] you will prophesy like them
[1:33:42] that will be a sign when you prophesy
[1:33:44] that will be a sign
[1:33:45] you
[1:33:46] are going to be the king
[1:33:49] for you
[1:33:50] so when as he was walking he went and
[1:33:52] met the other
[1:33:54] sons of the prophet and the man said the
[1:33:56] prophet said
[1:34:02] people were walking around and said
[1:34:04] isn't that so
[1:34:05] he's also a prophet
[1:34:07] he's an but is he a prophet
[1:34:10] no he was never a prophet
[1:34:12] but people always are like that when
[1:34:14] they see someone
[1:34:16] speaking like a prophet they say is a
[1:34:17] prophet
[1:34:19] but aparnam says prophets are born they
[1:34:21] are not men there are for that man who
[1:34:23] was not born a prophet therefore would
[1:34:24] not be a prophet that's right
[1:34:27] but he had a gift of prophecy on him
[1:34:29] that was a
[1:34:30] manifestation it was where on his spirit
[1:34:36] you remember even when he was going to
[1:34:37] take
[1:34:38] david
[1:34:39] when he was hunting david and that they
[1:34:41] would live somewhere
[1:34:43] in the in the house of uh i think where
[1:34:45] they have the boosts or some people like
[1:34:47] that
[1:34:48] so
[1:34:49] he was sending people to go and depict
[1:34:53] to go and pick that
[1:34:55] man living
[1:34:56] and the more he said there the more they
[1:34:59] did not come whatever you would say do
[1:35:00] not come but you know what was happening
[1:35:03] whoever he was sitting there was
[1:35:05] reaching there and anointing was coming
[1:35:06] on him so he would begin to prophesy
[1:35:09] so
[1:35:10] also so when he went there
[1:35:13] to go and pick up david to bring him
[1:35:16] uh he said let me go myself this is the
[1:35:18] boy i'm saying that i'm not coming
[1:35:22] when someone reached there he started
[1:35:24] prophesying from morning until
[1:35:30] because he was in the right atmosphere
[1:35:32] you understand
[1:35:33] so
[1:35:34] this manifestation comes depending on
[1:35:37] the atmosphere yes
[1:35:38] you know as we were starting here some
[1:35:40] of you you are wondering what was
[1:35:41] happening we are not starting because
[1:35:43] there was an atmosphere that came here
[1:35:45] it was hard for me to continue
[1:35:47] making the road around it and things got
[1:35:49] around then i came out of that
[1:35:50] atmosphere it was going to be very hard
[1:35:52] for me to continue you know because i
[1:35:54] was in that atmosphere of prophecy i was
[1:35:56] in the atmosphere of the anointing of
[1:35:58] the holy spirit
[1:35:59] so now when you get into that atmosphere
[1:36:01] when you have a new spirit you begin to
[1:36:02] prophesy
[1:36:04] when you have any spirit you begin to
[1:36:06] sing when you have holy spirit you
[1:36:07] become happy you grab your hands you
[1:36:09] jump up and down you understand
[1:36:11] when you have a new spirit you you
[1:36:13] become lively yeah that that the holy
[1:36:15] ghost comes and he quickens you and your
[1:36:17] spirit and you getting through they they
[1:36:19] they
[1:36:20] move
[1:36:21] you can't be just their staggering
[1:36:25] from the beginning of the service until
[1:36:26] the end it is a clear sign you have the
[1:36:29] old spirit which is very dirty and
[1:36:31] stinky
[1:36:34] that's true
[1:36:35] it means you have not been changed at
[1:36:37] all maybe you have only received a new
[1:36:39] heart but you may be if you receive a
[1:36:41] new heart it means it gives you appetite
[1:36:43] for the wife
[1:36:45] so if you receive a new heart you should
[1:36:47] have a new speech also soon afterwards
[1:36:50] because if you have happened for the
[1:36:52] world it is the word which brings down
[1:36:54] that anointing for you to also receive
[1:36:56] the new spirit
[1:36:57] one day you hear the word and something
[1:36:59] convicts you and then you are like oh
[1:37:01] god and then it strikes you again you
[1:37:03] come it's fixed you you know
[1:37:14] and one of those days the one will
[1:37:16] strike you well enough until you feel
[1:37:18] like
[1:37:32] means you are now a candidate you are
[1:37:34] warming up to receive your holy ghost
[1:37:36] anytime soon hallelujah
[1:37:38] so now
[1:37:39] but the bottom is saying you can receive
[1:37:41] that anointing you can receive that
[1:37:44] anointing on your spirit every day of
[1:37:47] your life and you prophesy and you speak
[1:37:50] tongues and it never went down and you
[1:37:51] do all those things of the
[1:37:53] manifestation of the word of the spirit
[1:37:56] and you still go to hell
[1:38:00] there are fire that's what we say about
[1:38:01] the pentecostals
[1:38:04] they have the anointing of it
[1:38:06] they have a new spirit
[1:38:08] many of them actually when you preach to
[1:38:09] them they watch something's guessing
[1:38:11] inside them he closes his eyes you know
[1:38:13] i've always seen them i always enjoy
[1:38:15] that by the way you know when i'm in the
[1:38:17] field there you know you're preaching
[1:38:19] and you're evangelizing to them you know
[1:38:20] i was with one brother sometimes i
[1:38:22] pushed him and he was like
[1:38:26] he was an old man of 65 years
[1:38:30] but as i was still preaching i was
[1:38:31] preaching because he was saying these
[1:38:33] things i can't understand them yet
[1:38:34] anymore
[1:38:37] another right now
[1:38:38] so i cannot go there but my father is a
[1:38:40] physical brother
[1:38:41] you know and i was preaching to him and
[1:38:43] that he did like this he was
[1:38:45] and then he did like this
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:53] you know the man was being grieved by
[1:38:55] the power of the what
[1:38:57] of the holy ghost by the power
[1:38:59] does it mean that is the time he was
[1:39:00] filled with the word spirit
[1:39:02] no but it simply means he had a new
[1:39:04] spirit so he could easily tap into the
[1:39:06] holy ghost and know it is god moving so
[1:39:09] he was grieving under that
[1:39:16] you know it comes sometimes with the
[1:39:18] mornings that we cannot be attacked how
[1:39:20] does it put it
[1:39:24] you people me get that
[1:39:29] these cookies you all don't know them so

[1:43:22] a new heart god gives you a new heart
[1:43:25] breaks forth and gives in your hand
[1:43:28] then
[1:43:28] that new heart gives you appendage for
[1:43:31] what
[1:43:33] for the world and the love for the word
[1:43:36] you pray for the word you'll be like i
[1:43:37] pray for the world i want to eat the one
[1:43:40] when you hear people talking about
[1:43:42] what you're sharing yeah because you you
[1:43:44] are in love with it

[1:43:52] a question
[1:43:53] you have appetites
[1:43:55] you you come in time
[1:43:57] because you have what
[1:43:58] appetite it is given to you by what by
[1:44:00] the new heart and when you receive a new
[1:44:02] heart somebody tell me
[1:44:19] that very moment when you made your
[1:44:21] decision you received a remark that was
[1:44:23] the moment you said in your heart
[1:44:25] that was the moment
[1:44:27] say when you surely if some of you here
[1:44:29] are faking it well you don't even have a
[1:44:31] new heart
[1:44:32] even you happy that for what we're doing

[1:44:40] one for you each of you can only give
[1:44:41] your mind for me
[1:44:43] the moment i remember
[1:44:47] i accepted the word
[1:44:49] that was the
[1:44:51] moment god had given me a new heart
[1:44:54] to accept that what you believe it i
[1:44:55] meant it's the change of heart
[1:44:58] i made up my mind
[1:45:00] i made up my mind to go all the way the
[1:45:03] rest of my life
[1:45:06] i've made up my mind to go all the way
[1:45:09] the rest of my life
[1:45:12] oh
[1:45:13] i've made up my mind to

[1:45:26] you see the moment you make up your mind
[1:45:28] to go all the way with christ
[1:45:31] yes
[1:45:32] it's the moment you decide to leave all
[1:45:33] the worldly pleasures
[1:45:36] it's the moment you decide to cut
[1:45:37] yourself off from the world you've got
[1:45:40] your
[1:45:41] physical spiritual america called from
[1:45:44] the world that very moment

[1:53:05] lord what about human beings who have a
[1:53:07] spiritual body
[1:53:09] can't you see you people don't even need
[1:53:11] to act you should be ashamed if you can
[1:53:13] act like those stones
[1:53:15] because they themselves can even shout
[1:53:16] so it means even the lowest thing which
[1:53:18] can give god glory can give good glory
[1:53:20] then if you are you cannot even behave
[1:53:23] better than a stone
[1:53:25] that means you're even worse than a
[1:53:27] stone
[1:53:28] because a stone is light
[1:53:30] lively
[1:53:31] according to jesus they say that you can
[1:53:32] give god
[1:53:33] glory
[1:53:35] that's what god says
[1:53:38] some people sit there
[1:53:40] what can i say i can't even say like a
[1:53:42] song because a strong can
[1:53:45] some people can't worship god no matter
[1:53:47] what
[1:53:48] you know i'm not saying that you must do
[1:53:50] like everybody else but at least there
[1:53:52] must be some bit of life in you yes
[1:53:55] you know
[1:53:57] there must be some bit of life in you
[1:53:59] some people they be on the zoo meeting
[1:54:01] because the zoo meeting
[1:54:20] when you are there you know you are you
[1:54:22] are being actively engaging in the
[1:54:23] service that you if you have a new
[1:54:25] spirit you will connect with what the
[1:54:26] people say yeah
[1:54:28] you understand yes
[1:54:30] you will receive it
[1:54:31] hallelujah you will write yours
[1:54:34] that you put there amen let it bless
[1:54:37] somebody who was losing you say hey yeah
[1:54:39] someone said amen also you understand
[1:54:41] you hate me yeah when you have a spirit
[1:54:43] you you you can't be there
[1:54:45] you'll be alive
[1:54:48] fully alive then
[1:54:50] one of these days
[1:54:52] after all that is done
[1:54:54] after all having said all that
[1:54:57] you receive the holy ghost
[1:54:59] now many people when they receive a new
[1:55:01] spirit they stop there they think that's
[1:55:03] it that's what mother madam was trying
[1:55:05] to say
[1:55:07] but
[1:55:08] but
[1:55:09] basically holy spirit you can even bring
[1:55:11] the word to them they reject it
[1:55:15] if
[1:55:16] they are not the seed of god
[1:55:19] they will reject it even if they are the
[1:55:21] son of god sometimes they can reject it
[1:55:23] until it is still the holy ghost that i
[1:55:25] said that it is impossible for you to
[1:55:26] praise god without you
[1:55:31] without faith
[1:55:33] it is faith in the word of god
[1:55:35] but it gives you the holy ghost
[1:55:38] it is the holy ghost
[1:55:40] that helps you to get stuck with the
[1:55:42] world
[1:55:42] no matter what in what situation you
[1:55:44] apply the word you understand
[1:55:47] and how does the holy ghost come into a
[1:55:49] believer
[1:55:50] the all of us comes into a believer
[1:55:54] shouting
[1:56:02] but the bottom says that one of the
[1:56:04] mysteries
[1:56:05] that were open in our time
[1:56:07] is
[1:56:08] to be filled with a holy ghost without
[1:56:11] sensation
[1:56:24] yes even if we end with this one today
[1:56:26] because
[1:56:27] i want you to really understand what
[1:56:30] this is all about
[1:56:32] okay
[1:56:33] let me get that for you here
[1:56:40] okay i have it ready
[1:56:45] it says
[1:56:46] all these mysteries
[1:56:51] can you put that up
[1:56:53] the screen please
[1:56:54] all these mysteries
[1:56:57] follow me please the mystery of the
[1:56:59] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:57:05] without sensation without
[1:57:14] the person of christ performing in you
[1:57:17] the same words that he did
[1:57:20] hallelujah
[1:57:21] hallelujah i said hallelujah
[1:57:25] now
[1:57:27] the holy spirit comes with doubt
[1:57:31] and some people use this to say
[1:57:33] what is this gibberish crying like
[1:57:35] babies pentecostal babies
[1:57:51] when it was about sensation
[1:57:53] but remember
[1:57:54] can you receive the boxing of the holy
[1:57:56] ghost
[1:57:58] without manifestations
[1:58:02] can you answer me after what you know
[1:58:03] now
[1:58:05] this comes last
[1:58:09] this can't last
[1:58:11] that's right
[1:58:14] wait
[1:58:15] it was meaning what he was saying
[1:58:20] i've already believed the word
[1:58:23] i've received a new heart i've received
[1:58:25] a new spirit where god has moved like in
[1:58:27] my heart where all the manifestations
[1:58:30] are actually
[1:58:32] some maybe or more depending on how you
[1:58:34] walk with god you know
[1:58:36] god has already manifested himself in my
[1:58:38] life
[1:58:40] shouting how that one is even now my
[1:58:42] lifestyle
[1:58:44] speaking in danger that is
[1:58:46] every time you know i have no problem
[1:58:48] prophecy that's always a part of me
[1:58:52] you understand
[1:58:53] running on the floor that has never been
[1:58:55] a problem
[1:58:56] you have been up and down ah it is
[1:58:58] always a part of
[1:58:59] me you know when ever since when ever
[1:59:02] since god changed me when did he change
[1:59:04] you i'd rather give me a new spirit i've
[1:59:06] not been the same since that time that's
[1:59:08] right you know
[1:59:10] no but you don't have the holy ghost yet
[1:59:14] when those things happen why did those
[1:59:16] things begin to happen i've been already
[1:59:17] for a long time
[1:59:19] and i've been changed i can say i've
[1:59:21] been changed i'm not what i want to be
[1:59:23] yet what does it mean i'm going to
[1:59:24] receive that person with the whole visit
[1:59:27] i'm not what i want to be yet but
[1:59:30] i'm not what i used to be there is a
[1:59:32] change in me happening
[1:59:34] i've not yet received a full redemption
[1:59:37] but there's a change in me
[1:59:39] happening are you following me
[1:59:42] and then
[1:59:44] one of those days as these things is the
[1:59:46] lifestyle
[1:59:48] so who are you
[1:59:50] you are a believer
[1:59:53] a believer who has already see who
[1:59:56] believes in the pentecostal blessing who
[1:59:58] believes in shouting and i shall not
[2:00:00] believe it but actually already
[2:00:01] manifesting it you are let me put it
[2:00:03] this way you are a believer already
[2:00:05] manifesting
[2:00:06] the life of
[2:00:10] already manifesting
[2:00:12] the life or the let me put it to you you
[2:00:15] are a believer already manifesting the
[2:00:17] attributes
[2:00:19] of christ in you
[2:00:22] you are i believe already
[2:00:31] and then one day
[2:00:33] you are somewhere praying
[2:00:38] and god gives you the holy ghost
[2:00:43] the mystery of the baptism of the holy
[2:00:46] ghost
[2:00:48] without
[2:00:50] god
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:07] if some was to dwell in you what would
[2:01:10] happen
[2:01:17] now would you know that he has come in
[2:01:18] you
[2:01:20] yes
[2:01:21] you would know
[2:01:23] why
[2:01:28] because you will change
[2:01:30] because you change
[2:01:32] have you had that that's right because
[2:01:38] now
[2:01:39] you can have the new speed as you want
[2:01:41] you can speak in times as you want you
[2:01:43] can manifest all the gifts as you want
[2:01:46] but still have last
[2:01:50] but still
[2:01:51] be alive still be a thief
[2:01:56] should be
[2:01:57] another fornicator
[2:02:00] you can preach even and under the
[2:02:02] anointing and still be a thief
[2:02:06] but let him come
[2:02:08] in your heart
[2:02:13] he is not the shouting
[2:02:15] the shuttle has already been there
[2:02:18] now people use this to me there's not
[2:02:20] going to be shouting
[2:02:22] there isn't going to be anything
[2:02:25] you just come in your visa
[2:02:28] and you may not spend
[2:02:30] and then eventually
[2:02:32] someone will tell you
[2:02:33] you have him say yeah by the way
[2:02:38] do you understand no
[2:02:40] actually the shouting and the praise the
[2:02:43] glory is hallelujah
[2:02:45] i have already been there
[2:02:48] there will be the year there is no way
[2:02:50] you can deceive the world that's what we
[2:02:51] say there is no way i can receive the
[2:02:53] holy ghost without manifestation
[2:02:56] because manifestation has been already
[2:03:00] the holy ghost comes in and out why why
[2:03:03] do we also say when he comes in your
[2:03:05] life you must know
[2:03:08] how can someone entirely another person
[2:03:10] coming in i don't know how
[2:03:13] i know
[2:03:14] what i think how i think how my thoughts
[2:03:16] think
[2:03:18] i know how i behave i know what i you
[2:03:20] know
[2:03:21] i know my name and everything when i
[2:03:23] begin to realize my name is no longer
[2:03:25] what i thought it is
[2:03:27] the moment it's not like that maybe
[2:03:29] after some time i realized no you
[2:03:31] realized at the very moment
[2:03:35] what has happened
[2:03:37] i don't feel that way anymore amy i was
[2:03:39] having headache for that brother
[2:03:50] [Music]
[2:03:55] when he comes in amen you must know when
[2:03:57] he comes in hallelujah
[2:03:59] so it's not like a mystery that it
[2:04:01] happens mysteriously decided we know it
[2:04:03] rather means when he comes in you amen
[2:04:06] he
[2:04:07] is not he is not a shout he is not the
[2:04:10] the wind he is not
[2:04:13] come on
[2:04:14] the tongue is not
[2:04:16] those manifestations right yes but he is
[2:04:18] that's too small voice
[2:04:20] amen the still small voice gives you a
[2:04:22] message
[2:04:23] the person comes in your life sister
[2:04:26] brother to live a life in you
[2:04:29] whereby what will he do continue
[2:04:31] finishing that quote performing come on
[2:04:34] somebody
[2:04:46] you see now
[2:04:47] we are not even talking about
[2:04:48] manifestation as such
[2:04:51] we're talking about
[2:04:52] the works
[2:04:54] of
[2:04:55] the
[2:04:56] holy spirit
[2:04:58] the works of the
[2:05:01] flesh are manifest and these are
[2:05:09] but the works of the spirit are also
[2:05:13] manifest and these are
[2:05:16] faiths
[2:05:31] those are the kindness
[2:05:38] you see
[2:05:39] this is a character we're talking about
[2:05:40] someone's character yes
[2:05:42] like jesus has a way like you have a way
[2:05:45] about you some of you like pulling your
[2:05:47] nose
[2:05:50] so even jesus yeah
[2:05:52] he has a way he behaves
[2:05:54] when his character comes in you yeah you
[2:05:57] understand
[2:05:58] some people they just like touching
[2:06:00] their ear
[2:06:05] [Laughter]
[2:06:12] um
[2:06:29] you cannot be the same again
[2:06:32] now you can say what about the
[2:06:34] manifestations
[2:06:36] it's just going to now continue
[2:06:38] increasing
[2:06:40] perfectly god bless you hallelujah
[2:06:51] and
[2:06:52] one of them
[2:06:56] was an adulterer and another was a very
[2:06:59] clean brother he saw it in a vision
[2:07:02] he saw the brothers in the church and
[2:07:04] then in the vision he saw them like that
[2:07:06] and by this time for him he did not know
[2:07:08] even the things which we are preaching
[2:07:09] about he didn't know them at that time
[2:07:12] so you went among these people that
[2:07:13] jesus called me or you know started
[2:07:15] singing and then one brother was
[2:07:16] speaking with another preaching
[2:07:19] and then he said these brothers are they
[2:07:20] having this
[2:07:21] is this the spirit of god and then he
[2:07:23] saw a vision if someone was an adulterer
[2:07:25] another one was not so he was asking how
[2:07:28] come that someone can have the spirit of
[2:07:30] god and then behave like this
[2:07:32] how can they be
[2:07:34] and then manifest the gift of the spirit
[2:07:37] because for them they thought god cannot
[2:07:39] sit on that vessel meaning if you don't
[2:07:42] have the holy ghost what cannot come in
[2:07:44] your life you understand
[2:07:46] but that's how god revealed this
[2:07:51] that the rain falls on the just and the
[2:07:53] unjust that's right the good and the bad
[2:07:57] this this
[2:07:58] they want to tell the ones who are going
[2:08:00] to heaven they will all god does not say
[2:08:02] are they saying i'm going to only give
[2:08:04] you to my bride this can suffer and
[2:08:06] suffocate
[2:08:07] if god is generous he will give his
[2:08:09] reign to everybody so therefore israel
[2:08:10] means the spirit
[2:08:12] but this spirit like he said in the book
[2:08:13] of job i will put my spirit upon all
[2:08:16] flesh he's not meaning the baptism he's
[2:08:19] not meaning the person of christ
[2:08:20] performing in newport
[2:08:22] in the veil works
[2:08:23] he's not meaning that christ coming in
[2:08:26] their soul but he is meaning the
[2:08:27] manifestation of his spirit coming upon
[2:08:30] them and that surely can come upon any
[2:08:33] that's right whether believers are not
[2:08:35] believers there are facts we as
[2:08:37] believers does it mean we should reject
[2:08:39] it
[2:08:40] as a matter of fact if we reject it it
[2:08:42] clearly shows
[2:08:44] it clearly we can't even see the holy
[2:08:47] spirit
[2:08:49] if someone is saying i have the one who
[2:08:50] is brother but actually
[2:08:52] he he is a very very very a
[2:08:56] you know cold
[2:08:59] ground zero person you know
[2:09:02] it's a clear sign they're lying they
[2:09:04] don't have the holy ghost you understand
[2:09:05] yes
[2:09:08] i have a way about me i can't even just
[2:09:09] say amen i'm just there
[2:09:12] i'm attentive i'm just like joshua
[2:09:15] you know
[2:09:17] no that one is a curious sign this
[2:09:19] brother is lying to us you understand
[2:09:21] there must be that life in you
[2:09:24] i've got a life of god in me
[2:09:28] i've got a life of god in me
[2:09:40] when it is in you you can't be the same
[2:09:42] you can't be group one anymore like like
[2:09:45] lovely now this year is lukewarm but you
[2:09:47] you can't give you one
[2:09:49] when his life is in you you can't be
[2:09:51] white
[2:09:52] there are five having known everything
[2:09:55] that you know now let me now ask you a
[2:09:58] question
[2:09:59] amen
[2:10:01] can you
[2:10:04] what is the proof
[2:10:06] that someone has the holy ghost
[2:10:14] the life of christ
[2:10:17] what is the proof that someone has
[2:10:40] yes
[2:10:52] so where is manifestation as an evidence
[2:10:55] it isn't there
[2:10:56] if you are truly filled with the spirit
[2:10:58] of god you will have the evidence of the
[2:11:00] word in your life
[2:11:04] i love the way it puts it
[2:11:05] if you are the spirit of god
[2:11:09] you will have if you are filled with the
[2:11:11] spirit of god you will have the evidence
[2:11:14] of the word in
[2:11:17] not that you will believe the word in
[2:11:18] the election
[2:11:20] please please repeat this correctly
[2:11:23] he's not saying you will believe the
[2:11:24] word intellectually you be like a
[2:11:25] professor you feel like
[2:11:27] you know someone was known in the world
[2:11:28] for years
[2:11:30] you just
[2:11:30] you know
[2:11:32] he's not meaning that when he says that
[2:11:34] me brother do you know how long i've
[2:11:36] been in the message brother
[2:11:51] in if you are not excited the way you
[2:11:53] were excited when you first came in then
[2:11:55] it shows that you don't have that worry
[2:11:58] he says the evidence is the word of
[2:12:00] the word
[2:12:02] in your life
[2:12:04] not the word in your head please
[2:12:06] understand that
[2:12:08] not the word in your head
[2:12:10] but the word in your life the life of
[2:12:14] christ was infested in you hallelujah
[2:12:17] that word
[2:12:18] is christ himself hallelujah
[2:12:21] and he cannot be in your life
[2:12:24] manifesting his characters
[2:12:27] without manifesting his characteristics
[2:12:31] some of you need to understand
[2:12:33] he cannot be in your life
[2:12:35] manifesting his character without
[2:12:38] manifesting his characteristics
[2:12:44] you got it now
[2:12:45] i mean can i say the third time yes he
[2:12:48] cannot be in your life
[2:12:51] manifesting his character without
[2:12:54] manifesting his
[2:12:56] characteristics
[2:12:57] hallelujah
[2:12:59] what is the character of brother o'kara
[2:13:06] brother of carol
[2:13:09] his character can be defined by his
[2:13:13] beauty the way he
[2:13:14] is but his characteristics will be
[2:13:18] defined in the way he behaves
[2:13:22] the things we see and he hear
[2:13:25] and can tell about him
[2:13:28] the character and the nature of christ
[2:13:30] in you
[2:13:32] is what we read in ephesians
[2:13:36] is what we read in galatians
[2:13:40] the works of the spirit are manifest
[2:13:44] what are those is the words of the
[2:13:46] spirit this is character
[2:13:49] love long suffering peace
[2:13:52] all those things
[2:13:55] but then
[2:13:57] we need to see the characteristics of
[2:13:59] that character
[2:14:03] we need to see the manifestation
[2:14:08] surely
[2:14:09] if god in me
[2:14:12] is patient
[2:14:13] that's special that's a character
[2:14:16] in that same patient god in me
[2:14:20] we praise god in times of truth that's
[2:14:23] right
[2:14:24] you know i'm just being patient
[2:14:28] because i've lost this and that i'm just
[2:14:29] being patient
[2:14:31] actually if you're patient enough
[2:14:33] you'll praise god and you're trying to
[2:14:35] say hallelujah
[2:14:37] you know that sacrifice of the holy
[2:14:39] spirit
[2:14:41] look this is no longer even a new spirit
[2:14:42] anymore it is the holy spirit himself
[2:14:44] now
[2:14:46] if the holy spirit in you is love
[2:14:50] when someone steps on your foot
[2:14:54] you will hug them
[2:14:57] you will do it
[2:14:59] and tell them brother i know you need me
[2:15:02] i forgive you
[2:15:04] i know you didn't mean to hurt me my
[2:15:06] sister i forgive you
[2:15:08] amen
[2:15:10] hallelujah
[2:15:12] and then when you come in the church you
[2:15:13] will dance together
[2:15:15] you'll not be like okay i have patience
[2:15:18] but because i'm sad today even i cannot
[2:15:21] dance even like i can't even worship god
[2:15:23] even i cannot i have no joy now
[2:15:28] because this has happened to me
[2:15:33] it is a clear sign you have no character
[2:15:35] on christ because that character goes
[2:15:36] with characteristics it goes with its
[2:15:38] life
[2:15:39] it goes with that with everything about
[2:15:41] it
[2:15:42] you know you see that while the preacher
[2:15:44] is preaching the word i i have faith in
[2:15:46] the character not so
[2:15:48] i have faith
[2:15:49] but i'll just receive it silently
[2:15:52] you know
[2:15:53] if you have faith brother you will jump
[2:15:54] back
[2:15:56] [Applause]
[2:15:59] you know it's the life of it
[2:16:02] you understand
[2:16:04] there is your evidence that you have the
[2:16:06] holy ghost
[2:16:07] it goes together
[2:16:09] let me tell you the things that i said
[2:16:11] in this service for about one hour now i
[2:16:14] never plan to say them
[2:16:17] myself i'm going to go back and listen
[2:16:19] because i believe it was the holy spirit
[2:16:21] revealing this to us today that's right
[2:16:24] i have not had it
[2:16:26] i've heard it from him
[2:16:28] hallelujah
[2:16:30] therefore
[2:16:31] we'll go back and listen to these things
[2:16:34] so i can be able to get inspiration on
[2:16:36] what
[2:16:37] i can preach on regarding this subject i
[2:16:39] believe the holy spirit was really
[2:16:41] really opening this world for you young
[2:16:43] people because there's a purpose he has
[2:16:45] for you
[2:16:47] because he has been i've never seen it
[2:16:49] this way brother okay
[2:16:51] the way he has been able to connect all
[2:16:52] those courts for us
[2:16:54] says who are you talking about are you
[2:16:56] talking about yourself pastor no i'm
[2:16:58] talking about him because he's here
[2:17:01] we have been able to bring all those
[2:17:02] sports for us how some have used some of
[2:17:05] us wants to confuse us and take away our
[2:17:08] liberty
[2:17:10] make us think that if you have the holy
[2:17:11] ghost you're going to be like a dead
[2:17:14] wrong
[2:17:14] if you have a holocaust you're just
[2:17:16] going to accept the word and put it in
[2:17:17] your head as long as you can be able to
[2:17:19] tell those words and if someone begins
[2:17:21] to read the quote yeah let us take a
[2:17:23] little look at
[2:17:33] but if you do not have that life of it
[2:17:35] in you
[2:17:36] you are just wasting your time
[2:17:39] and i'm about to close
[2:17:41] i thought that was a very important
[2:17:42] thing to do for us today
[2:17:46] let's show you how deeply i feel and
[2:17:47] understand this truth by a revelation
[2:17:50] god gave me
[2:17:51] now before i tell it i want to say this
[2:17:54] many of you people believe me to be a
[2:17:56] prophet i don't say that i am you said
[2:17:59] it
[2:18:00] but we both know that the visions god
[2:18:02] gives me never fail not once
[2:18:04] if anyone can prove a vision ever failed
[2:18:07] i want to know about it
[2:18:08] now that you follow me this far here is
[2:18:10] my story
[2:18:12] many years ago when i first came across
[2:18:14] the pentecostal people i was in one of
[2:18:16] their camp meetings where there was much
[2:18:18] manifestation of tongues interpretation
[2:18:20] of tongues and prophecy
[2:18:22] two preachers in particular were engaged
[2:18:24] in this kind of speaking more than any
[2:18:26] of the other brethren
[2:18:28] i thoroughly enjoyed the services and
[2:18:30] was truly interested in the various
[2:18:31] manifestations for they had a ring of
[2:18:33] reality to them
[2:18:35] it was my earnest desire to learn all
[2:18:37] that i could about these gifts so i
[2:18:39] decided to talk to the two men about
[2:18:41] them
[2:18:42] through the gift of god resident in me i
[2:18:44] sought to know the spirit in the first
[2:18:46] man whether he was truly of god or not
[2:18:49] after a brief conversation with that
[2:18:50] sweet humble brother i knew that he was
[2:18:52] a genuine solid christian he was real
[2:18:56] the next young man was not at all like
[2:18:57] the first one
[2:18:59] he was boastful and proud and as i spoke
[2:19:01] to him a vision moved across my eyes and
[2:19:04] i saw that he was married to a blonde
[2:19:06] lady but was living with a brunette and
[2:19:07] had two children by her
[2:19:09] if ever there was a hypocrite he was one
[2:19:12] now let me tell you i was shocked how
[2:19:15] could i not be
[2:19:17] here were two men one of which was a
[2:19:19] real believer and the other was a sinful
[2:19:20] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[2:19:23] gifts of the spirit
[2:19:25] i was troubled by this confusion i left
[2:19:27] the meeting to seek god for the answer
[2:19:30] i went alone to a secret place and there
[2:19:32] with my bible i prayed and waited on god
[2:19:34] for the answer
[2:19:35] not knowing just what portion of
[2:19:36] scripture to read i casually opened the
[2:19:38] bible to some place in matthew
[2:19:41] i read for a while and then laid the
[2:19:43] bible down
[2:19:44] in a moment a wind blew into the room
[2:19:46] and turned the pages of the bible to
[2:19:48] hebrews chapter six
[2:19:50] i read it through and was particularly
[2:19:51] impressed by those strange verses
[2:19:53] hebrews 6 4-9
[2:19:56] for it is impossible for those who were
[2:19:58] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[2:20:00] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[2:20:02] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[2:20:04] word of god and the powers of the world
[2:20:07] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[2:20:10] them again unto repentance
[2:20:12] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[2:20:14] son of god afresh and put him to an open
[2:20:17] shame
[2:20:18] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[2:20:20] that cometh off upon it and bringeth
[2:20:21] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[2:20:24] dressed receiveth blessing from god
[2:20:26] but that which beareth thorns and briars
[2:20:29] is rejected and is nigh unto cursing
[2:20:32] whose end is to be burned
[2:20:34] but beloved we are persuaded better
[2:20:36] things of you
[2:20:37] and things that accompany salvation
[2:20:39] though we thus speak
[2:20:42] i closed the bible laid it down and
[2:20:43] meditated a while and prayed some more
[2:20:46] i still had no answer
[2:20:48] i again opened the bible aimlessly but
[2:20:50] did not read
[2:20:51] suddenly the wind blew into the room
[2:20:53] again and once more the pages turned to
[2:20:54] hebrews 6
[2:20:56] and remained there as the wind ceased
[2:20:59] i read those words over again and when i
[2:21:01] did
[2:21:01] then came the spirit of god into the
[2:21:03] room and i beheld a vision
[2:21:05] i saw in the vision a man dressed in the
[2:21:07] purest white who went forth into a
[2:21:09] freshly plowed field and sewed grain
[2:21:12] it was a bright day and the sewing was
[2:21:14] done in the morning
[2:21:15] but late at night after the sower and
[2:21:17] white had gone a man in black came and
[2:21:19] stealthily sowed some more seed amongst
[2:21:21] that which the man in white had sown
[2:21:24] the days went by
[2:21:25] the sun and rain blessed the ground
[2:21:28] and one day there appeared the grain how
[2:21:30] fine it was
[2:21:32] but a day later appeared the tears
[2:21:34] the wheat and tears grew together
[2:21:37] they partook of the same nourishment out
[2:21:38] of the same soil they drank in the same
[2:21:41] sun and rain
[2:21:42] then one day the skies turned to brass
[2:21:45] and the plants all began to droop and to
[2:21:47] die
[2:21:48] i heard the wheat lift their heads and
[2:21:50] cry to god for rain
[2:21:52] the tears also lifted up their voices
[2:21:54] and pleaded for rain
[2:21:56] then the skies darkened and the rain
[2:21:58] came and again the wheat now full of
[2:21:59] strength lifted up their voices and
[2:22:01] cried in adoration praise the lord
[2:22:04] and to my wonderment i heard the revived
[2:22:06] tears also look up and say hallelujah
[2:22:10] then i knew the truth of the camp
[2:22:12] meeting and the vision
[2:22:14] the parable of the sower and the seed
[2:22:16] the sixth chapter of hebrews
[2:22:44] difference
[2:22:45] they were of different seed
[2:22:48] here also was the answer to matthew 7 21
[2:22:51] through 20.
[2:22:53] have you seen it yes yeah
[2:22:57] let me play that for you again
[2:23:00] the seeds were people elect and
[2:23:02] reprobates both partook of the same
[2:23:05] nourishment water and sun
[2:23:07] both prayed
[2:23:08] both received help from god for he may
[2:23:11] see
[2:23:12] where
[2:23:14] people
[2:23:15] who
[2:23:23] nourishment
[2:23:24] of the water and
[2:23:26] the sun
[2:23:27] both pray
[2:23:29] both receive the help from god for he
[2:23:32] makes his son to raise
[2:23:35] to his son andre to fall on both the
[2:23:37] good and
[2:23:39] and though they both had the same
[2:23:41] wonderful blessing and both had the same
[2:23:45] wonderful manifestation somebody said
[2:23:48] that again
[2:23:50] at the same
[2:23:52] wonderful
[2:23:53] situation talk about all of them
[2:23:57] there was still one great difference
[2:24:02] they were all different
[2:24:07] they were of differences so the issue
[2:24:09] here is the seed so what we see the
[2:24:12] pentecostals do
[2:24:14] they are impersonating it
[2:24:17] because
[2:24:18] it was not meant for them rather
[2:24:22] it's not it's meant for the believers
[2:24:25] this raid was meant for what
[2:24:30] it was made for the follower the wheat
[2:24:34] it was meant for the wheat
[2:24:36] this thing was meant for
[2:24:40] the manifestation was made for
[2:24:43] whatever
[2:24:46] are you getting on my point yes i hope
[2:24:48] someone is understanding something new
[2:24:50] here
[2:24:51] the manifestations were met for them
[2:24:56] the world was meant for
[2:24:59] the spirit was meant for
[2:25:02] nonetheless
[2:25:04] the
[2:25:06] what
[2:25:07] that's the tire
[2:25:09] also enjoyed the same
[2:25:11] but bacteria cannot be healed with the
[2:25:14] shack
[2:25:16] that the seed brother cannot be here
[2:25:18] with a shark
[2:25:20] the shark cannot be here with the siege
[2:25:25] as much as it will enjoy the rest
[2:25:28] but it cannot go on unto perfection
[2:25:32] and how does perfection come
[2:25:34] perfection comes in by receiving the
[2:25:37] true genuine holy ghost
[2:25:40] in your soul
[2:25:42] and how do you receive that by accepting
[2:25:44] the word of your debra amen hallelujah
[2:25:48] and basking yourself under that word day
[2:25:51] by day but says the revelation striking
[2:25:53] after the relationship it breaks the
[2:25:55] stimulation of revelation hallelujah
[2:25:59] let me know this is a mystery
[2:26:01] the things you're hearing not very many
[2:26:03] people know that not very
[2:26:18] with his son and reign to fall on both
[2:26:20] good and evil
[2:26:22] and though they both had the same
[2:26:24] wonderful blessing and both had the same
[2:26:25] wonderful manifestations
[2:26:27] there was still that one great
[2:26:29] difference
[2:26:30] they were of different seed
[2:26:33] here also was the answer to matthew 7
[2:26:35] 21-23
[2:26:38] not everyone that saith unto me
[2:26:40] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[2:26:42] of heaven
[2:26:43] but he that doeth the will of my father
[2:26:46] which is in heaven
[2:26:47] many will say to me in that day
[2:26:49] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[2:26:52] name
[2:26:52] and in thy name have cast out devils
[2:26:55] and in thy name done many wonderful
[2:26:57] works
[2:26:58] and then will i profess unto them i
[2:27:00] never knew you
[2:27:01] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[2:27:04] jesus does not deny that they did the
[2:27:06] mighty works that only the holy ghost
[2:27:08] can accomplish by way of men
[2:27:11] but he did deny ever knowing them
[2:27:14] these weren't backsliders these were
[2:27:16] wicked unregenerate reprobates
[2:27:19] these were the seed of satan
[2:27:21] and there it is
[2:27:23] you can't claim that manifestation as
[2:27:25] the evidence of being spirit born
[2:27:26] spirit-filled no sir
[2:27:29] i will admit that true manifestation is
[2:27:31] the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[2:27:33] mighty acts but it is not the evidence
[2:27:35] of the individual being spirit-filled
[2:27:38] even though that individual has an
[2:27:39] abundance of those manifestations
[2:27:42] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[2:27:44] today
[2:27:45] is just the same as it was back in the
[2:27:47] day of our lord
[2:27:49] it is receiving the word of truth for
[2:27:51] the day in which you live
[2:27:53] jesus never did stress the importance of
[2:27:55] the works as he did the word he knew
[2:27:58] that if the people got the word the
[2:28:00] works would follow
[2:28:01] that is bible
[2:28:03] now jesus knew that there was going to
[2:28:05] be a terrible drift away from the word
[2:28:07] in the pergamian age which was as yet
[2:28:09] 200 years off from the patmos vision
[2:28:12] he knew that drift would cause them to
[2:28:14] go into the dark ages
[2:28:16] he knew that the way man originally got
[2:28:18] away from god was by first leaving the
[2:28:20] word
[2:28:21] if you leave that word you have left god
[2:28:24] thus he is presenting himself to the
[2:28:25] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[2:28:28] churches of all ages
[2:28:30] i am the word
[2:28:31] if you want deity in your midst then
[2:28:33] welcome and receive the word
[2:28:36] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[2:28:37] between you and that word this which i
[2:28:40] am giving you the word is a revelation
[2:28:43] of myself
[2:28:44] i am the word
[2:28:46] remember that
[2:28:49] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[2:28:50] impressed with the word in our midst
[2:28:52] let me give you a thought here
[2:28:54] how do we pray
[2:28:56] we pray in jesus name don't we
[2:28:59] every prayer is in his name or there
[2:29:00] isn't any answer
[2:29:02] yet in first john 5 14 we are told
[2:29:06] this is the confidence that we have in
[2:29:08] him that if we ask anything according to
[2:29:10] his will he heareth us
[2:29:12] and if we know that he hear us
[2:29:14] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[2:29:16] the petitions that we desired of him
[2:29:19] now we ask
[2:29:20] what is the will of god
[2:29:23] there is only one way to know his will
[2:29:25] and that is by the word of god
[2:29:27] lamentations 3 37
[2:29:30] who is he that saith and it cometh to
[2:29:32] pass when the lord commandeth it not
[2:29:35] there it is
[2:29:36] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[2:29:38] it
[2:29:39] so we can't ask unless it's in the word
[2:29:41] and we can't petition or ask unless it
[2:29:43] is in his name
[2:29:44] there it is again
[2:29:46] jesus the name is the word
[2:29:49] will
[2:29:50] you can't separate god and the word they
[2:29:53] are one
[2:29:54] now then this word he has left behind on
[2:29:56] the printed page is a part of him when
[2:29:58] you accept it by faith into a
[2:30:00] spirit-filled life
[2:30:02] he said that his word was life
[2:30:05] john 6 63 be
[2:30:08] but that is exactly what he is
[2:30:11] john 14 6
[2:30:13] i am the way the truth and the life
[2:30:16] romans 8 9 be
[2:30:19] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[2:30:21] he is none of his
[2:30:24] there it is he is spirit and he is life
[2:30:26] that is exactly what the word is
[2:30:29] that is exactly what jesus is he is the
[2:30:32] word
[2:30:33] so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[2:30:36] in faith takes that word into his heart
[2:30:38] and places it upon his lips why that is
[2:30:40] the same as deity speaking
[2:30:42] every mountain has to go
[2:30:44] satan cannot stand before that man
[2:30:48] if the church way back there in that
[2:30:50] third age had only held on to the
[2:30:51] revelation of the living word in their
[2:30:53] midst the power of god would not have
[2:30:55] faded as it did in those dark ages
[2:30:58] and right today when the church returns
[2:31:00] to the word in faith we can say without
[2:31:02] doubt that the glory of god and the
[2:31:04] wonderful acts of god will be in her
[2:31:06] midst again
[2:31:08] one night as i was seeking the lord the
[2:31:10] holy spirit told me to pick up my pen
[2:31:12] and write as i grasped the pen to write
[2:31:16] his spirit gave me a message for the
[2:31:17] church
[2:31:18] i want to bring it to you
[2:31:20] it has to do with the word and the bride
[2:31:24] here is what i am trying to say to you
[2:31:27] the law of reproduction is that each
[2:31:28] specie brings forth after its own kind
[2:31:31] even according to genesis 1 11
[2:31:34] and god said
[2:31:36] let the earth bring forth grass and the
[2:31:38] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[2:31:41] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[2:31:43] is in itself upon the earth
[2:31:45] and it was so
[2:31:47] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[2:31:49] into a plant and thence into fruit
[2:31:52] the very same law applies to the church
[2:31:54] today
[2:31:55] whatever seed started the church will
[2:31:56] come forth and be like the original seed
[2:31:59] because it is the same seed
[2:32:01] in these last days the true bride church
[2:32:04] christ's seed
[2:32:05] will come to the headstone and she will
[2:32:07] be the super church a super race as she
[2:32:10] nears him
[2:32:11] they in the bride will be so much like
[2:32:13] him that they will even be in his very
[2:32:15] image
[2:32:16] this is in order to be united with him
[2:32:19] they will be one
[2:32:20] they will be the very manifestation of
[2:32:22] the word of the living god
[2:32:24] denominations cannot produce this
[2:32:27] wrong seed
[2:32:28] they will produce their creature
[2:32:32] denominations cannot reproduce or
[2:32:35] produce this
[2:32:36] why
[2:32:38] because
[2:32:42] this
[2:32:46] says that this is in order to be united
[2:32:49] with you
[2:32:52] they will be
[2:32:54] one
[2:32:55] they will be the very manifestation
[2:32:59] look at that
[2:33:00] there will be a very manifestation of
[2:33:02] the word of the living
[2:33:04] god the very manifestation of the word
[2:33:08] of the living god

[2:35:41] of the word of the living god
[2:35:45] denominations cannot produce this

[2:35:54] the life that this message can produce
[2:35:57] in your life
[2:35:59] denominations cannot go are you getting
[2:36:01] what i'm talking about

[2:36:07] this message will produce a people that
[2:36:09] are going to live for the name of christ
[2:36:11] this message are going to produce a
[2:36:13] people that will behave differently
[2:36:16] women that all listen to me please the
[2:36:18] women that will dress differently
[2:36:20] women even who would treat themselves
[2:36:22] like women
[2:36:23] denominations have collided
[2:36:26] and
[2:36:27] and collaborated with the devil to
[2:36:28] undress the women but in this message
[2:36:32] the message will place women in the
[2:36:34] right positions both in the church and
[2:36:36] in their homes
[2:36:37] this message will we will put the men in
[2:36:40] the line and give them the mind of
[2:36:42] christ whereby they will be able to do
[2:36:44] those things which seem and which are
[2:36:46] right you see
[2:36:47] this message will make us for fake the
[2:36:50] things of the world denominations can't
[2:36:52] do that that's why people are there and
[2:36:54] they can do what they always do are you
[2:36:56] listening to me
[2:36:58] hey please listen to me now they are in
[2:37:00] their denominations and they behave the
[2:37:02] way there they don't find a problem with
[2:37:05] what they are doing and when they come
[2:37:07] in the message
[2:37:09] are you saying that this is wrong even
[2:37:10] that is wrong even that is wrong even
[2:37:12] that is wrong but believers who are
[2:37:14] truly believers of this message
[2:37:16] hallelujah
[2:37:22] [Music]
[2:37:30] look at me
[2:37:33] hallelujah
[2:37:35] from since i knew the message
[2:37:37] and when he said me you can as well see
[2:37:39] yourself
[2:37:40] from sins i believe this message have
[2:37:42] not been the same from sins i believe
[2:37:45] this message i've lived a separate life
[2:37:48] from since i believe this message i've
[2:37:50] lived a life hallelujah that is beyond
[2:37:52] reproach
[2:37:54] hallelujah
[2:37:55] where jesus himself came on this earth
[2:37:57] and he said
[2:38:00] show me
[2:38:02] where i have broken the law
[2:38:04] show me
[2:38:06] the if i have not done what was written
[2:38:08] of me
[2:38:09] tell me connect me tell me amanda you
[2:38:12] can condemn me of sin that's what jesus
[2:38:14] said
[2:38:16] how come he would say that
[2:38:18] do you know that the bible and the
[2:38:20] message tells us we are going to be the
[2:38:22] very manifestation of that word
[2:38:24] we are going to be christ
[2:38:26] not even christ like we are going to be
[2:38:29] christ
[2:38:30] we are going to be here
[2:38:34] the prophet says she is him in this same
[2:38:37] such book somehow we shall find i think
[2:38:39] maybe down there she is him
[2:38:43] this message is going to produce a very
[2:38:45] different species
[2:38:48] this message is made that's why
[2:38:49] sometimes people are like oh these are
[2:38:51] high standards they get out they feel
[2:38:53] like they must say ah this high standard
[2:38:54] is up there they get out there even many
[2:38:57] who claim to believe it they make their
[2:39:00] own standards
[2:39:01] leaving the standards of the world
[2:39:04] they will not be counted among the bride
[2:39:06] christ is only looking for those that
[2:39:09] are his seed and his seed will manifest
[2:39:13] the very word of the living god in our
[2:39:15] generations
[2:39:17] the denominations cannot manifest that
[2:39:20] one
[2:39:22] do you know what separates us from the
[2:39:24] denominations
[2:39:25] do you remember
[2:39:28] of course if you want to know what
[2:39:29] separates us from the denomination then
[2:39:31] you should know what makes us who we are
[2:39:33] what makes us a true church
[2:39:35] so can we now remember what make us a
[2:39:37] true church those two principles have
[2:39:39] you forgotten them already
[2:39:41] the fewer words of god
[2:39:44] the viewer
[2:39:45] of god
[2:39:49] the manifestation of god's power in our
[2:39:51] life
[2:39:52] hallelujah
[2:39:54] now the denominations are those that
[2:39:56] don't believe in the pure word of god
[2:39:58] even if it's
[2:40:00] what but there is no life they are dead
[2:40:04] god demolitions so there could even be
[2:40:07] some who put themselves in the category
[2:40:09] of believers when they actually
[2:40:10] donations
[2:40:13] can you imagine brad yes
[2:40:16] it's not what i say is what the one says
[2:40:21] the denominations cannot produce this
[2:40:28] i'm getting blown away

[2:41:04] revelation of jesus christ
