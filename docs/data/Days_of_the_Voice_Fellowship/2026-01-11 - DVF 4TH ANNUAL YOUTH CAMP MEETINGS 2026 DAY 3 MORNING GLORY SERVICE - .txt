You know, if we can stay like this, ah the rapture can come quickly. I tell you because you know staying in the presence of God is just a wonderful wonderful Amen. So we are in for wonderful services today. Today just this moment is just the beginning of a wonderful day and we are here. Usually we thought we just maybe come and you know hear something from a minister something little and maybe we also pray for the day and uh but uh this morning we have I have something special for you &gt;&gt; you know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother that came came just flown in a few days ago. uh from Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; I just felt that I should we should try to kind of um have him come because um you know for him also to have a wonderful time. Maybe you want to sit for just a few moments &gt;&gt; uh for him to just uh come and enjoy fellowship with us. and uh then go back and be a blessing to his people. But was one of the first believers in Ethiopia I think yesterday I alluded to that when I was speaking a little testimony. &gt;&gt; Um my wife and I you know went to Ethiopia for our honeymoon in 2013. And on that honeymoon, one sister believed the message. &gt;&gt; So we did not plan it that way. &gt;&gt; So I'm not trying to tell you that I'm a very spiritual man that people believed on my honeymoon. What I'm saying is that we were there when God did it. And this sister her name is Sister Yordit &gt;&gt; and she happened now to be the very first believer in the country of Ethiopia as far as the work that God sent us to do there is concerned. A few others believed and you know through her and brother Asid is one of them. Amen. She got an invit he she gave him an invitation to come. She gave him an invitation to come. Uh she gave him an invitation to come. &gt;&gt; Don't think are you the one interpreting for the minister? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. take yourself out of the way, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; And say what the preacher is saying. I know you're a good interpreter, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let's take yourself out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, um, he she invited him to come and, um, you know, he received the message there after he was a lecturer in one of the un several universities and I remember one time, you know, sitted in my office. I told him brother I told him God can give you a university &gt;&gt; a college of your own and you know the Ethiopians are very uh the people who grab the blessing he shouted amen amen and then just a few months after that he asked me to name the college and which means God gave it to him and uh and uh we named it Bridge College and and so God has been God has blessed him and together with him maybe some of you have even seen those videos when he was interpreting and we've reached out to many places And uh God has brought in many souls. &gt;&gt; So brother is an evangel evangelism machine. &gt;&gt; He has a burden for souls. Shall we receive him this morning tell us his testimony and whatever whatever more he wants to do. We have a short time but I know it will be an inspiration to the young people. Let us clap our hands as we receive brother. Amen. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom saints. How are you? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? Hallelujah. Clap runs TO THE LORD.

YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE LORD. YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE LORD. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Clap your hands to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I cannot uh I cannot stop praising the name of Jesus Christ. So I believe you will help me. You'll support me. Hallelujah. Together we will destroy the planets of the devil. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT YOU TO SHOUT. SAY HALLELUJAH.

HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Are you AFRAID OF TO SAY HALLELUJAH? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That is the language that belongs to the believers for this ministry. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to keep the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy. That's why. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have so many things to say &gt;&gt; but uh because of the time shortage we have to use it effectively now uh directly. I would love to pass into the testimonies that I have bring. &gt;&gt; Yeah. While the media team is preparing the PowerPoint, maybe to share you what the Lord has done in the country of Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; you are not an Ugandian. You are not Kenyan. I am not Ethiopian. We have one citizenship that is heavenly citizenship. Praise be the name of Jesus Christ. But when the Lord bring us to this planet earth, he make us some of some of us to be Ethiopian, some of us to be Kenyan, some of us to be Ugandian, some of us to be Chinese from each and every nations and nationalities. The Lord has his own bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we shall see soon together with the bridegroom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until then, we have to share what the Lord has been doing in our life. &gt;&gt; There is a scripture that says in the Bible, there are two major tools that you can overcome the devil. testimony. You are GOING TO DESTROY THE HEAD of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And also by the revealed word of God. That revealed word of God has come into our own way. We didn't come into the message, but the message come to our own way. HALLELUJAH. YOU NEVER ASK IT TO COME. I NEVER ASK IT TO COME. BUT HE HIMSELF bring it to my own way. Hallelujah. I take it. I receive it. I had it and I'm not leaving it. Hallelujah. I'm not enjoying it. Hallelujah. You have got already the power. You have got already the revealed words of the time power. You must tell for others. You must you don't have to sit in your house. You don't have to sit in your church. Go and search for the souls. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God will do something special. So you know uh back years uh in Ethiopia you know how I I I wonder how God has been using different pupils, different ministers. for for the message to come to Ethiopia. I cannot finish it. I cannot completely finish everything what the Lord has done in Ethiopia but in respecting in respecting of my life in connection with my life in relation with my life. I'm going to share you the testimonies what the Lord has given. So as pastor has been telling you can you just uh slide one more this is just the yeah now this is our situation now now I put it uh a word it says before the beginning you know brotherham says even this day not that day even this it has been already in the mind of God before even the foundations of this world while he was in the form of the logos. &gt;&gt; Amen. So before everything begins before the beginning saw this congregation this is the congregation that I'm leading that I'm ministering right now. Praise be the name of Jesus Christ. So now let us go to the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How it begins. &gt;&gt; Can you? Yes. So in the beginning what just happened? &gt;&gt; You know in the beginning I uh was married before I come to this message and uh there was a sister her name is sister Yodit. She was like you know a Samaritan woman for me. &gt;&gt; She just bring the message. She was the first touch or the first person who told me about the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh I'm going to show you who she sister Yod is. But before this picture that you are seeing, can you find out pastor Talima and his wife and also his two daughters? You are seeing it. Yes. On the first picture they have invested their time. I have to appreciate that. I I have to respect that. Please clap your hands for pastoral. It was not easy &gt;&gt; for them you know their intention was to come and to enjoy their honeymoon. &gt;&gt; The Lord has his own plan beyond beyond the honeymoon. &gt;&gt; The Lord used pastor Talma to for 5 years. Hallelujah. And I have been able to really get the message really to see the message. So uh this is where I just bring him to uh my house. Then after the dedication of my baby. This is my first baby. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So my first baby born he he was just dedicated in the church where where pastor was leading us. So I then in the next slide you will see I I I I I invited them to come to my house. Yeah. Amen. But before that so this is sister Yodit that introduced this message to me. For your surprise, we met with he was I received the message until now. He is rejecting the message. I thank God for that for that friend because he bring her this sister in my way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I just really grabbed it. Hallelujah. So in the next slide that you see uh I just bro I just invited pastor Talma and brother Germa. Brother GMA is now the husband for sister Yodit. Now this time they are preaching the message in my house where I have been preparing a little ceremony because of the birthday ceremony for my first baby. After the invitation from the church program then they come back to my house. What was the reason behind? &gt;&gt; I have told every uh person that I know, all the relatives that I know, you must come and listen to what the message is saying about me. I didn't have that much knowledge about the message, but I have already totally received it. I'm convinced that you know some of the things in the message will be revealed through time but whether it is reveal you have got the full uh the full you know meaning interpretation or not. You must keep. You must just keep believing and be a testimony wherever you go in your place of God, in your house, in your neighborhood, wherever you go. That was the first step that I have done of the hour at my place. I hope they're not ministering. I'm now leading a church back home in Ethiopia. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So even pastor Mo he has got married and now he's now a pastor in back in home in even recently I I hope those people who come from start Exodus church from pastor week church they the saints from the believers from Ethiopia have been traveling and seeing there. Yeah. So this is the way the work of God is uh how the work of God is doing. Hallelujah. So in the next slide there was uh an amazing movement of the message in you know this is howasa mission in 2019 you know 2019 it was time. You know what I what I always be amazed by the work of God. It was a time of chaos. You know, &gt;&gt; but you know for the first time before 2019 many ministers have gone to Hawasa to preach this message. What makes it special in 2019? Pastor Tal he told me I have got this vision this year I am coming with brother Kane you know you have seen brother K from Nairobi church brother K the one who has been preaching yesterday we are we are coming to Ethiopia we I have got a big burden to outreach this message in uh city called Hawasa It's not his first time when he has king coming. Many people many has been preaching. What makes it special in 2018 when they come in before we go to we were having a prayer. I remember it was I think in at brother Gay's house. Yeah. We were just like this holding each other hands each other and we have been praying. You know what just happened while we are praying just a voice come to me. The Lord spoke to me and I was in that you know in that condition of in that presence. I remember I prophesy once I said in this year in this mission this mission will be different it was recorded I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what what what the Lord was speaking in this mission a church will be established in our that was the voice that I have heard it's kind of difficult for you even to to to speak about planting a church brother but the Lord was faithful just we go there inasa For I think about two weeks you have been preaching a message. Remember it was time. It was everybody you know everyone has. &gt;&gt; IT WAS TERRIBLE TIME. God helped us. He just supported us. I have never seen a move of God like that time just within short period of days or time. about 35 pupils have got baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ALMOST MORE THAN 35 PUPILS. Out of the 35 individuals who have been baptized, THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN FAMILIES, seven families and other individuals. Now what just happened? Those believers have been having fellowship in one of the brother's house and that brother has been living in Hawasa. He has been I mean his name was brother Tim. Brother Tim he cames from Nairobi Kenya but he was living in Hawasa. He has been working in Hawasa Industrial Park. He was a chemical engineer. &gt;&gt; He was dedicating himself, his life, his house, even his uh wife, they have been dedicated. So we were having fellowship. The believers have been fellowship in his house. Now because of the flow of the believers cannot hold the believers, it becomes TOO MUCH. WE didn't ask the believers But sometimes THEY SAY &gt;&gt; NOW WE NEED A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; We need TO HAVE A CHURCH. WE NEED TO RENT A CHURCH. They asking us then what can I say about how the Lord has been intervening his life his way. Hallelujah. I believe also God give him uh you know some you know uh some pupils for pastor Talma and he has been uh trying to manage to to bring those finances to support then one way or another God prepared all the financial provisions the church in Aasa has been established praise be the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Now in the next slide. Yeah. Oh, I think this thing has been changing in another. Can you read it? No. No. This another language. I don't know how it changed into another language. But let me tell you something about Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; I don't know when it is converted into PowerPoint file. I think that's why. But let me tell you, I have it in my uh smartphone. So about Ethiopia you have to know something in Ethiopia &gt;&gt; do you know that we are about 135 million population it means almost three times Uganda now what why am I saying this in Uganda &gt;&gt; or when you go to Kenya &gt;&gt; or Zimbabwe or any other African countries. There are a number of message believers and there are number of churches. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; what about for us? &gt;&gt; We have to WORK VERY HARD. WE have to preach THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THIS BURDEN IS NOT ONLY FOR US. YOU HAVE TO share this burden. That's why I'm bringing this message. That's why I'm bringing this testimony. THERE IS A LOT OF WORK to do in Ethiopia. &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. God has already started to raise to raise us, different, different ministers. You need to pray for Ethiopia, you know, comparing with the total population. Me, I have studied accounting and finance. my first degree international I also uh so let me show you something from the message you know brother Branam he said at least one in a million you know that message even if you come to the calculation of of one in a million how many thousands of believers must come out from 135 million population take still we have we have so many works to do. We have outreach to do for Ethiopia. We must go. We must support one way or another. We have to pray. We have about 12 regions. We have about two chartered cities. If you go and even if if you go in one region, one region might have about 4.9 million population is about 4 million in one region. The population is too much is good. So we have to be able to outreach. Do you agree for that? Do you agree for that? Are you happy? So what we are going to do just the last slide I think the Yeah. Let us claim for the message of the hour. Hallelujah. Amen. There is something that I have bring. I am a man of faith. You don't have to have faith. I will have faith for you. Don't worry. I am a man of faith. I know you are a man of faith also. In this building, every one of you are a man of faith. So I just bring by faith just to be a sign. You know in uh Branam's tabernacle when he was you know uh he when he was uh ministering sometimes he told them to bring handkerchiefs to be as a sign then they will pray over on that handkerchief. People who have faith and use that will get healed whether they have cancer or any kind of diseases. So it's biblical I was thinking I was meditating what should I bring as a sign just like if there is a one or two deacons that can bring me that uh uh I have bring the Ethiopian flag. If you can help me the deacons, &gt;&gt; I would love to give this Ethiopian flag just as a sign just to pray over it. Let them give you for each and everyone. Yeah. It may not be enough, but at least it gives them. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

I believe you know what I'm talking about in this chapter of Exodus. You know the chapter these chapters of Exodus is an amazing uh chapter as we have seen it now from verse 12. This is just a beginning of Exodus, a beginning of going out. You know, brother Abraham said in around paragraph 8, he said, "And now it's a type of today shown us we are also facing another exodus. It is going to begin exodus. You know, Israelites has been in Egypt. They were in uh they were under bondage. But God is going to do something special. He is about to execute judgment. But that judgment does not attack the righteous generation. A judgment IS COMING EVEN IN THIS GENERATION. But only the righteous generation has the right to PASS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A SIGN. THEY DO HAVE A TOKEN. THAT TOKEN IS CALLED THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. THE WHERE IS THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST? IS IN THE WORD. THE WORD IS JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF. AMEN.

NOT THEY THEY WILL NOT ONLY PASS THE DAY JUDGMENT. IT IS THEIR JOURNEY TO START UH FOR FOR BEGINNING EXODUS. THEY WILL COME OUT BUT THEY WILL ALSO ENTER INTO THE PROMISED LAND. It has twofold meanings. THEY COME OUT AND THEY WILL ENTER INTO THE PROMISED LAND. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY BROTHER TOLD US THAT GOD HAS A WAY.

You see the way of God is different than we think. Hallelujah. You know in the message called identification. The prophet told us if you are in the lamp's book of life because that lamp already A sufficient sacrifice has been made already. An accepted sacrifice HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY. SO IN THE MESSAGE CALLED IDENTIFICATION, THE PROPHET TOLD US IF YOU are in THE LAMP'S BOOK OF LIFE, I BELIEVE ALL OF US are written in the lamp book of life. IS THERE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE IN THIS CONGREGATION TODAY? BECAUSE YOU ARE ELECTED BEFORE THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD.

But God only meets the true worshiper and under the BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We are very lucky. So God needs God always you know follows the same standard same principle what was in Genesis shall continue without shedding of the blood of sin. What the Bible says without shedding of the blood there is no remission of sin. By an eagle eye the prophet comes in our age and told us while we are you know arguing about is he told us sin is not just making ADULTERY lying just you know having FIGHTING EACH OTHER THESE ALL BAD THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING. NO NO NO NO NO. THESE THINGS ARE THE BYPRODUCTS OF SIN OF SIN. THE REAL SIN AND BELIEVE BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR BY THE MESSAGE OF YOUR AGE BY THE WORD OF GOD WHEN YOU ARE DEDUCTING FROM THE SCRIPTURE YOU are sinning. SO THAT SIN NEEDS WHAT? A sacrifications of blood. No one was worthy BRING US BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL SITUATION EXCEPT JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF. GOD MAKE HIMSELF HUMAN FLESH. HE COMES IN A HUMAN MADE FLESH in fullness just for FOR US TO RECONCILE BACK TO HIM. THE BIBLE TOLD US RECONCILE himself to us. He reconciled us to himself. AMEN.

AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let us pray the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. GOD BLESS YOU. I LOVE YOU. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's give another clap of Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Uh, can I can I have that book? Brother, &gt;&gt; see friends, this man that just spoke to you when he received the message, he never slept off with it. He went to work. You see this church age book? He translated it. If you look at the characters, I don't know if the camera can see this for those who are on, but if you look at the characters, you think it's a chicken trying to scrub a few words. You can make nothing out of it. But the message came in English. But these people in Ethiopia also deserve to hear the message in their own language. And brother without even knowing brother prophesy that this message will go to every nation and will be translated in many languages all over the world. &gt;&gt; I believe Maharik was one of them. So this day these prophecies fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed to identify himself with a pillar of fire. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he just shared a few pictures there. One of them brother testify the pastor now in one of the pastors in Aasa. was a pastor in the Pentecostal church and uh this man was very very stubbornly rigid in his own ideas because he loved the Lord too much. He never wanted to be deceived. So you thought what we are teaching is deception. &gt;&gt; But because brother Aset had translated a message in in in some of these tracks, they happened to be one of a little young sister living in brother Tim's house. Brother Tim who happens to be a Kenyan. There's a connection and Kenya. This sister's name is called Rebecca or Eurob or whatever you want to call it. And she picked that little tract. You see, we always told them, "Don't sleep. Take a tract. Give to tell someone about the message. This is what every one of us must do after THIS YOUTH COME. LET US BE ON FIRE FOR OUR GENERATION. EVERYONE AROUND US MUST KNOW GOD HAS SENT A PROPHET WITH A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION. THIS IS A TOKEN MESSAGE. And this sister took that little track in this because she was going into this institution. And brother Tesa happens to be doing some accounting work for that institution and she gives this truck to this man and the man was attracted and he came he said I would like to meet your pastors. Some of our team told me about him. to be ina with brother. We sit down with him, not one time, not two times, many times. As one of the pastors here preached, there is always that supernatural element. Let me tell you, no one can say I brought someone into the message. NO one can claim that. No one can claim that. AMEN. NO ONE BROUGHT YOU TO THE MESSAGE. IT'S ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAD A SEED OF GOD IN YOU. WHEN THE WORD CAME TO YOU, YOU REALIZE YOUR TRUE ORIGIN AND YOU RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AMEN. And so when he came to and we know we talked and talked and he could not get it. But one day a supernatural element kicked in. I've seen it and I would like to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus. One day I'm preaching in his church of God comes upon me and a song comes to mind. Let's begin singing that song. We're going to sing that song in Christ. Give me truth, mercy. But I tell you friends, brother is one of those God has anointed with the desire to see this message spread across the world. I never expect that you are you've gone this far. This is wonderful. you this man can preach anywhere. &gt;&gt; Well, if you want to invite him to your church, that's why I know you are leaving. He's leaving right away on Monday or something like that. We are happy to have you here. Thank you so much. God bless you. Let us give a clap of praise to the Lord for you. When you go back to Ethiopia, we send our greetings. I'm going to have this always with methopia. You are always going to have that with me praying for Ethiopia. My voice is beginning to go. I'll do something about it. But listen, as we dismiss, we are going to be here uh at 9:15 Sunday morning. Amen. And uh men of God are ready to speak to us. Prayed up. I'm expectant. If there are those gifted with prayer and intercession, if there are those who are gifted with prayer and come to meetings like this, it's always good you step back and pray for the service if you can. The man I told you about, come here, brother Brian. This is the man I told you about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you got a baby girl and she's alive.
