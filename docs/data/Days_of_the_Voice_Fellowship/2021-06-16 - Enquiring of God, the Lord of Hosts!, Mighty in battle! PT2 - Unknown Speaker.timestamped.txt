[22:49] i just uh want to invite you uh
[22:53] to to go to the scripture um
[22:58] see that you know and uh we are going to
[23:02] read where we read last time
[23:09] we are speaking today on
[23:12] uh inquiring of god
[23:15] mighty in battle
[23:19] come on
[23:27] and the lord has been ministering to us
[23:29] and i'm going to come about that with
[23:30] you amen so i invite you to open your
[23:33] bibles in the book of fast quran cause
[23:51] and when the philistines heard that
[23:53] david was anointed king of
[23:55] all israel all the philistines went up
[23:58] to sick david
[23:59] and david heard of it and went out
[24:01] against them
[24:18] and the philistines came and spread
[24:21] themselves in the valley of refinement
[24:27] [Music]
[24:30] that's what
[24:43] david inquired of god
[24:47] saying shall i go up against the
[24:49] philistines
[24:50] and would thou deliver them into my hand
[24:54] and the lord said unto him go up for i
[24:56] will deliver them into their
[24:57] hands
[25:12] when you speak to the lord and the lord
[25:13] answers back
[25:17] gives you an assurance
[25:22] go and pursue the enemy amen amina the
[25:26] reason why we preach this message
[25:29] without fear or whatever you could tear
[25:32] it's because we know that the lord was
[25:34] with us
[25:36] and that when we got to attack the enemy
[25:40] he cannot
[25:52] so they came up to bile perez him and
[25:56] david smote them there
[25:58] then they would say god has broken in
[26:01] upon mine enemies
[26:03] then david said god has broken in upon
[26:04] my enemies by
[26:06] mine hand like the breaking forth of
[26:08] waters therefore they call the name of
[26:10] that place
[26:32] amen verse 12 and when they had when
[26:34] they had left their gods there
[26:37] david gave a commandment and they were
[26:40] banned
[26:41] with fire
[26:45] now
[26:50] david ordered that the gods of those
[26:53] philistines would be burnt with fire
[26:59] and the philistines yet again spread uh
[27:03] yet again spread now we'll look at verse
[27:06] 13.
[27:07] themselves are brought in the valley uh
[27:10] yet spread themselves
[27:11] abroad in the valley
[27:17] [Music]
[27:19] david inquired again of god and god said
[27:22] unto him
[27:23] go not up after them turn away from them
[27:26] and come upon them over against the
[27:28] mulberry trees
[27:30] [Music]
[27:44] and it shall be when thou
[27:47] hear a sound of going in the tops of the
[27:50] mulberry trees that
[27:52] then thou shalt go out of battle for god
[27:55] has gone forth before thee to smite the
[27:57] host of the philistines
[28:00] that double
[28:28] and the fame of david went out into all
[28:31] lands
[28:32] and the land that the lord brought the
[28:34] fear of him
[28:35] upon all nations
[29:06] now we understand that christians do not
[29:08] do
[29:09] things like unbelievers
[29:24] because we have the strength to do it
[29:31] we always wait upon the lord will the
[29:33] judges say
[29:34] that even the bible says that they that
[29:36] wait upon the lord shall renew their
[29:38] strength
[29:45] as an ego
[29:48] they shall run and not be wary
[29:52] teach me lord teach me lord to wake up
[29:56] it's important for a child of god to
[29:58] learn to wait upon the lord
[30:00] [Applause]
[30:03] but you see how can you wait upon the
[30:05] lord if you have gotten inquired of
[30:42] whatever he says you very well know in
[30:44] your heart
[30:45] that is not going to give you his
[30:46] opinion but he's going to give you what
[30:49] you must do
[30:50] again
[30:57] god has no opinion
[31:00] god has final words
[31:04] [Music]
[31:17] is an absolute quran the bible is
[31:20] amen it's the absolute truth
[31:24] whatever god has spoken in his word it
[31:26] is the absolute truth
[31:46] [Applause]
[32:12] some of us have been following what is
[32:14] happening even in israel at this time
[32:19] and uh because you see we know that
[32:21] israel is god's time peace
[32:30] hallelujah i mean guess what i did not
[32:33] prepare this quote but i just want
[32:35] you brother if you can get it for me uh
[32:37] uh but isaac about the shame if you can
[32:39] quickly get for me that quote
[32:43] uganda as i also tried to find it here i
[32:45] just feel to read it for you here

[32:57] our audio is fine if our audio is not
[33:00] fine
[33:00] you just let us know
[33:10] okay we are reading from the message
[33:14] uh questions and answers on genesis 5307
[33:22] 29.99
[33:28] do you believe that the jews return to
[33:30] palestine is a fulfillment of the bible
[33:36] prophecy
[33:40] [Music]
[33:51] and then he said if you want to see what
[33:54] time of the year it is
[34:01] are you hearing this if you want to see
[34:04] what time of night it is
[34:09] look at the clock tonight
[34:13] if you want to know what day you are
[34:15] living in
[34:24] [Music]
[34:43] [Music]
[34:46] what
[35:00] is
[35:05] to palestine was a fulfillment of
[35:08] prophecy
[35:13] and when we fast forward come back here
[35:16] or
[35:16] uh oh i think we have just gone back a
[35:19] little bit now
[35:23] you see they have been fighting walls
[35:27] with philistines never seen the suit for
[35:30] a very very long time
[35:33] the battles or the wars that you are
[35:34] hearing of happening now between
[35:37] israel and palestine did not just begin
[35:39] now it started many years ago
[35:56] but you
[36:47] [Applause]
