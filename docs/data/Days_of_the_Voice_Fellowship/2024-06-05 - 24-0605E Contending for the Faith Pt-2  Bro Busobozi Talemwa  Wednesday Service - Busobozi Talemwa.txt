evening light and I'd like to greet them as well on Zoom God bless each of you you we are going to read from the book of Jude now we did uh read this on Sunday we did we read it on Sunday but um we are going to read again and and um then take on from where we stopped Jude is just the book before revelation so we are reading verses 3 to 4 amen beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful to to write unto you and exalt you that you should honestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints for there are certain men crept in and awar who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated um speaking on contending for the faith Part Two for the saints that are with us on Zoom or hearing this for the first time on Sunday I was dealing with um with what our faith what the faith is and and I was I mentioned that there are many faiths on Earth today and many denominations but there is really One Faith one true faith and that's the the faith which was once delivered to the Saints by Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth and how from Jesus Christ on down to the disciples and from the disciples on down to the whole world but for the first 300 years that Faith was almost pure until later on in 300 25 ad when you know emperor Constantine R he helped sumon a meeting which was called n Council and that it was at a place called n or and um at that place there they agreed what should be the faith and they summarized and and the majority accepted to believe in in three persons that make one God and from that from that moment onwards they formed what they called the one the Catholic Church now Catholic means Universal Catholic means you know the Catholic Church means the universal church so then they would form a church which they believed to be the church the only church that held the true faith and later on they would go ahead to put a man to head that church and that man was called the pope now of course we know that that was not the true church and that what they had what they thought was not the true Faith but it was the Fulfillment of jude4 which says for there are certain men kept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemn and Godly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God our Lord Jesus Christ so they denied him they rejected him and when they rejected him they formed their one one one world denomination and they wanted to bring the world into an order of of you know whereby they they believed in one religion so they turned the faith into a religion it was never a religion it was always the truth presented in the form of the of the scriptures which the disciples had written to different Believers in different places but this men when they came in they brought in their own dogmas and Creeds they brought in their own ideas and they began to teach it as the as the word of God when indeed it was not the word of God it was doctrines of men it was traditions of men so they replac the holy spirit with a man we see here then the B you know uh we I did read for you on Sunday where the Bible in the Book of Revelation speaks about the Deeds of the Nicol which later on became the doctrines of the nicolan so we see I read for you where the Prophet now goes ahead and expounds on what the the the deeds and the doctrine of the nians was this is where they it says N means to conquer and the latest meaning the people so the nian spirit was a spirit at a time that conquered or S to conquer the lady to rule over the people to rule over the church so now whereby God in his Sovereign wisdom had given the word and the Holy Spirit to lead the church but these men when they crept in they replace the Holy Spirit and the word with men with doctrines of men so now you had a holy [Music] priesthood instead of having a holy a holy nation so now you had a few men who were supposedly the ones who were holy the holy men whereby now the congregants came to them to confess their [Music] sins their word was law their word was the final Authority and ultimately the word of their leader the pope was the final final Authority so we see that that is a spirit of niolon and by the way that spirit is not dead it is still alive today whereby you find men you know submitting themselves to men rather than submitting themselves to the word and the Holy Spirit where they have replaced the leadership of the holy spirit with the leadership of men and I want to say thank God for the message of the hour because it has restored us back again to the leadership of the Holy Spirit to the leadership of the word Believers all around the world we are moved by the word and the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Spirit will always agree with the word if it is the holy spirit leading you he canot to do anything that is out of the word if it is out of the word then that is not a holy spirit that is the spirit of the Antichrist praise the name of the Lord and so we notice now these men that crept in Una aware they came with the doctrine of the Nicol the word is not no longer continue to be the absolute and of course we know that that seed of the nians was sold in the beginning at Ephesus Church age at that time it was just a little seed a little baby Spirit which started out slowly and it started out eating up the church you know it was just a little deed which a few people practice trying to control the people trying to teach the people their own ideas trying to bring their ideas as if it is the gospel truth and let me tell you that same spirit that you know it comes in slowly you don't notice you don't notice and even in the in in the married couples meeting I spoke about that Spirit of nicolan really you know coming into the family you find that man well of course we know that the headship in the home or in the family is a man the husband and um but but you know not he not meaning the physical man because he says the head of every man is the wife the head of every woman is the man and the head of every man is Christ so even in the family when he says the head of the woman is the man it really means the headship is Christ not you the man the physical man because you two do not have your own head your head is Christ the word so that means every family every home must be laid by the word must be led by the Holy Spirit we must learn to do things after Consulting with God what what is God's will about this what does God intend to do but where you find a man saying me I have spoken I'm the man you must do as I've said no that's not the spirit of God you must consult with God you must know the will of what you're going to do in your home is it against the word does it agree with the mind of the holy spirit in the same way you also find in the family the spirit of Jezebel of that woman Jezebel who is not willing to submit herself to her husband and who is bringing foreign gods in in the home in the family because you see Jezebel was the spirit of Jezebel is a rebellious Spirit does not want to submit does not want to hear does not want to be corrected that's not want to be Tau that's the spirit of Jezebel it is attacking a generation but it's also attacking the family and God hurts those two Spirits the spirit of Jezebel and the spirit of the and now the message of the hour has come to restore us from these spirits of the age back again to the to the original back again to The Original Seed back again to the First Gospel back again to the faith which was delivered to the Saints and we today in this generation are contending for the original Faith which was once delivered to the Saints you find people have been over overcome by the spirit of Jezebel they they rebellious our generation is very rebellious people do not want to hear what the word of God says even when they hear they are not willing to soften their hearts they are not willing to hear and to break down the Bible says in the end time they will be he will be highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God we are the ones living in this time do you know that people are like that people are he they high minded they love Pleasures more than they love God they love Pleasures more than they love the world but the restored bride loves the world more than she loves Pleasures amen we are containing for the faith we are restored back again to the beginning where the word is our portion where the love of Our Lives is the amen the word of God we are restored back again to the beginning praise God and we see that we are living in the time when these men that crept in unawares they have come and they have overtaken the church and theyve they've defiled it praise God so we looked at many things we also looked at the uh the a few things about the church ages and how it started in the beginning with the Ephesian Church age and church Ag and the others that came afterwards but you see that seed was growing we read about the S how he said leave them to grow together now two seeds in the framework of the Christian faith he said let them grow together the True Vine and the false Vine and he said but at the time of the Harvest we shall be able to separate the True Vine will go into the Ghana will be harvested the wheat but the tears will be packed for burning do you know we are in a generation where that prophecy is being fulfilled we are in a time when the True Vine which is the wheat being gathered up from all around the world from all tribes from all nations from all walks of life the wheat is being gathered the wheat is being gathered I feel like I am part of that whe I am gathered we are gathering around around Christ amen the prophet was asked a question where shall We Gather shall We Gather in TX or should we Gather in in Jefferson but then he said well it has been revealed to me where you should gather just gather in Christ the Lord hallelujah we are not having any denomination we don't have any headquarters together to we don't have any church together too if I tell it is days of the voice Fellowship I am a liar if I tell you is evening life I am a liar if I tell you it is this church or that church I am a liar we only have one place that place is not a church that place is not a denomination that place is the person of Jesus Christ that is why we must be filled with the Holy Ghost the Bride of Jesus Christ is being gathered by the voice of the bridegroom amen through the messenger of the last age and Gathering us back again to the foundations of our faith again to the Fai which was delivered to the Saints we are being gathered right there let others seek a home below I feel like traveling Oh amen this is where we want to be how many feel like traveling on tonight amen let me tell you brother sister if you are here joking around or playing around message preachers keep preaching and you you keep coming to church you hear a good someone you go back home you he a good someone you go back home but you are not willing for that word to change you one of these days you will be shocked you will be surprised when you come to church and you realize there is no one to receive you you there's no to preach to you and then you realize the raptures happened do you not to you called luk one message believer you are the first one going to know the Rapture has taken place when everybody else is still worshiping normally and then you will come to church you realize there is no one you will call the pastor he's not there you call the Deon he's not there you will call the sister not there and then you realize you are seeing someone else who was also not serious like you and you realize he also doesn't know what happened she realizes you are all stranded you look at yourself that morning or that it will be a morning you look at yourself and you realize it has happened imagine how you will look imagine how you will feel when you know the Rapture has taken place and you are left behind now you'll prepare yourself and of course you can't take your life if you take your life you go straight to hell so then you will know you have to wait for what comes next you have to be persecuted oh praise God because you are the foolish virgin you may realize you don't even fit among the foolish virgins because the foolish were virgins they were they had lived a life they were sincere Christians so to you message believer amen you cannot even be a foolish virgin because to be left for the rapture means you are not a serious Christian so what you have what you hearing today what you hearing every service take it serious and let it change your life amen praise the name of the Lord oh my I don't want to be left behind I don't want to be in the tribulation I want to go in the Rapture I want to go and be with the Lord and that's why we must contend for the faith today we must content for the faith today in what we do we must content for the faith in our life we must content for the faith our works must show what we believe our life must reflect what we claim to believe praise the name of the Lord and we see the Believers of every generation stood up for what they believed the Bible speaks of the seven Church agents right from Ephesus on down to the last one you know when you notice God came down in Ephesus and he used PO used Iranian P used maruse Kumba and then comes you know sadis then he uses Martin Luther Luther that was the time of the reformation and then comes Philadelphia this was a missionary age then God used John wisley amen and then we we we know we are living in the last age now this is the age of people's rights everybody claims they have their rights to do this to do that but this is the time God has sent a messenger William Bram with a message of restoration praise the name of the Lord this message is to restore us back again to the beginning back again to the foundations of the of our faith did you know that Paul was misunderstood by many but still Paul he laid the foundation but he was misunderstood by many but he laid the foundation of our faith and if you do not understand Paul you cannot understand William Bram if you can't believe Paul you can't believe William Bram if to you William Bram is a false prophet Paul will be a false prophet because William Bram had no other religion but Paul's religion bam did not teach another Revelation but he only restored what Paul preached he only Tau what Paul preached the message of William Bram is a message of restoration praise the name of the Lord Paul would say in the book of Galatians chter 1 ver6 I Mar that ye are soon removed from him that called you into the grace of of Christ unto another gospel says which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ so now this is Paul speaking and he says you removed from him that called you to the grace of Christ and you moved into another gospel but who are these that are bringing another gospel he is not another gospel but there remember he said Jude said certain men who crept in unawares and here Paul says it is not another gospel but there be some that trouble you and would perver the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you he said let him be a cast as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that he have received let him be a cast now Paul had the authority listen please he did not just say this words he was speaking it with what we call Apostolic Authority because he was the one that laid the foundation in 1 Corinthians 3:10 he says according to the grace of God which is given to me as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation praise God and another build there on but let every man take he how he build there for other Foundation can man lay than that is late which is Jesus Christ so now follow me closely here the foundation Paul claims to have L but then he goes ahead to say the foundation I have laid is Jesus Christ so now that means the teachings Paul told is Jesus Christ If any man deny If any man reject any of the teachings Paul told he is rejecting Jesus Christ it means he has a spirit of the Antichrist on him because Paul laid the foundation and the foundation was Christ praise the name of the Lord he says I've laid a foundation and that's why he could come up and say If any man preach to you another gospel than what we who the apostles has preached let him be a cast he says they won't preach another gospel they will be caring the same Bible but what they are preaching will be different from what Paul preached their results will be different from the results Paul had are you hearing me church so now he says those are already a cast praise the name of the Lord and then you ask me what did Paul teach Paul taught one Goden he said God is not a trinity of person today they preach the Trinity of they say there is God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost and they say father is God son is God holy spirit is God but father is not the son and son is not the father and son and father is not the Holy Spirit each of them is not the other but each of them is God and each of them is separate but there one God that is a lie that's a lie help me and say that is a lie that's not the truth because they're trying to say God is like a bunch of grapes where you have several grapes on one on one on one branch God is not that way Bible says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth praise the name of the Lord and in the book of First John you could put those verses there brothers first John 5:7 because I'm speaking fast and maybe people may want to see those verses and so you can just through it for them right there first John 57 it says there are three that that three in heaven there are three that that witness in heaven and he says one is the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and he says these three these three are one these three are one and then verse eight he says there are three that bear we record on Earth the the water the blood and the spirit and he says these three agree in one now listen the one that agree in one is because they are three distinct things you can have one without the other you can have the water which symbolize a justification without having the blood you understand you can be justified but not Sanctified you can be Sanctified but not filled with the Holy Ghost but justification and sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost agrees in one salvation you understand me but here when he says the three that bear record in heaven the Father the word which is the Son and the Holy Ghost these three one not agree in one because you cannot have one without having the other why because they are the same person amen God the spirit condescended down and in the Book of John chapter one what does he say he says in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen in verse 14 he says the word remember the word which was God the word which means God dwelt Among Us and we beheld his glory the only glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth what does that mean amen the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New Testament is the same God in the book of Isaiah 42 amen he says I am the Lord and that is my name and my praise I will not give to any grav which means he has a glory oh my follow me he has a glory and he cannot share his glory but then in Colossians 1 verse 267 he says there's a mystery there's a mystery which has been hidden for ages but now it has been revealed and he says this is the mystery Christ in you the hope of your [Music] glory amen hallelujah amen now the glory of God which you would not share which you cannot share has come anded into a human being first in his son embodied in Jesus the son of God what was it he was Emmanuel walking down the streets of Jerusalem what was it God With Us God was above us now he became with us through Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem the disciples said we walked with him we ate with him we talked with him we saw him who was he amen when he was asked by the disciples he also asked he said who do you say that I am who do you say that I am and Peter by revelation he said you are Jesus the son of the Living God how could he be the Son of God if he was not God the son of a pig is a pig the son of a God is a God the son of a human being is a human being the Son of God is God himself Hallelujah when he said he was the Son of God the discip the Jews they wanted to kill him and his crime for calling himself God he never did say he was God he only said he was a Son of God but the Jews knew if you were a Son of God it means you are God and we find out later on that that Peter received that Revelation you are God In the Flesh and when and when Jesus heard that he told him Simon B for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father in heaven and upon this Revelation I will build my church and the Church of Jesus Christ has been built upon that revelation of who he is amen the Church of Jesus has been built upon the revelation of godliness upon the revelation of the godhead amen but they they have missed it they perverted it they T another Jesus they T another God but that same Jesus who was here on Earth is the same one who has come back again on the day of Pentecost the same Pillar of Fire which led the children of Israel in the desert is a same Pillar of Fire which came back again and when Paul saw it he said who are you my Lord my Lord because he knew this is the lord of the Old Testament and the voice out of it said I am Jesus in other words the Jehovah you know has become Jesus his name is now Jesus Oh My My My My that should make a True Believer to be excited amen the Jehovah of the Old Testament became the Jesus of the new and now we see that that same Jesus he came back again in the upper room in the form of another pill fire Hallelujah once again another P of fire and he divided himself into many pieces and he came in many disciples inside their hearts as the Holy Spirit and that's why he said the mystery which has been hidden for ages has now been revealed which is Christ in you the hope of your glory what is the holy spirit is the Lord Of Glory who is Jesus is Lord so the holy spirit is Lord Jesus is Lord so Jesus was the revelation of the glory of God and we have the full name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost as the Lord Jesus Christ and this is what Paul taught this is what all the disciples stood for but when these men came in they came and and broke it feared it introduced the Trinity to deceive men who were unsuspecting and today billions of so-called Christians believe in the Trinity the Trinity is a Doctrine from her it is not a Doctrine from the Bible it is an antichrist spirit amen it's the spirit of niolon to come and rule over people yet it was never a Bible Doctrine it was never a teaching but today it has been restored back to us by the message of Our Generation amen why did Paul preach you say Paul preached water baptism in that name we just talked about the name above all names the name of the Lord Jesus Christ did you actually know the Bible says I believe it is in the book of Colossians that whatsoever you do in word or In Deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to the father by do all In The Name Of The Lord Lord Jesus why because the name of Jesus is a name above all names God has had many names in the Old Testament he's been called Gyra he's been called Shalom he's been called s it's been called many names it's been called Jehovah but in our time he has come to us amen with a name above all other names amen and that's the name of Jesus and that's the name that can save you from your sins and the Bible says At The Mention Of The Name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and that's the name and that's what Paul taugh Paul taugh the power of the name the Believers in the book of Acts they were persecuted because they Tau in the name and when they arrested them then they would tell them when they releasing them one time they told Paul you can go away but just be sure not to speak in that name again the devil feared that name because he knew the power of that name At The Mention Of that name amen the devil Shacks At The Mention Of that name amen the devil knows is The Only Name that can beat him when we are praying for the sick we pray through the name of Jesus Amen when we are chasing demons we Chas them in the name of Jesus Amen when we're praying for deliverance we pray in the name of Jesus and the devil knows is The Only Name that can defeat him because Jesus is the only one that could defeat him on the cross and because the devil knows that he has tried to take away the name from the lips of the people and when it came to water baptism he replaced it with titles of father son Holy Spirit they don't know those are titles but in the Book of Matthew 28:9 Jesus said baptize in the name the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost one name not names of but they name all and that name is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah is the name above cancer it's the above witchcraft it's the above poverty it's the above your sickness is a above your problems it's a above every Mountain you have in your life if one day by Revelation you can simply call on the name of Jesus Christ you will notice your mountains can move the devil has been against that name that's why we should never take the name of the Lord in vain praise the name of the Lord and we see that baptism is Paul preached it should be in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you know he also taugh the Holy Ghost baptism and he Tau it that it is a seal until Redemption and he said that every believer should receive the and and and apostles also Tau it they all believed that a man having believe must receive the Holy Spirit as a matter of fact in the book of Acts 19 Paul asked the Believers who had believed these were people who had been already baptized they had been baptized already and they were found at a place called Ephesus and they were Disciples of John and so Peter asked Paul asked them a question and what then were you B and he said baptized unto John well then he said well John bapt baptized un repentance and then he began to teach them about Christ and about the name of the Lord Jesus and the Bible says when they heard this they were all baptized now this is the second time it doesn't matter how many times you are baptized you may be baptized 1 million times I don't care if it is not in much water and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have to do it over again you are not baptized and these people in the book of Acts chapter 19 they went back again to the water I found a preacher who told me you know those people did not baptize the second time they simply prayed for them to receive the Holy Ghost I said you are a li when you go to the Scripture it says they were baptized and when Paul had prayed over them they receed the Holy Ghost and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy amen Paul Tau amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it is so sad today that even if find so-call believers they no longer believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may have believed but if you have believed and you have not been filled you are a theologian but until you filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you are just a theology but we find every believer that believed was filled was filled was filled with the power of the Holy Ghost amen that is the power to overcome that is the power to live a Christian Life that is the power to overcome the world no man can fill you with the Holy Ghost no man can give you the Holy Ghost Only God Can amen and you can only do it by asking by being under expectation he will fill you with the Holy Ghost amen some people thought when you receed the message you have received a full package which within it has the Holy Ghost when you receive the message you're just going to the Rapture you lying yourself wake up because even if you receive the message you have to receive the life of the message the message is one thing it is the mechanics by the Holy Ghost is the life that come to the mechanics and he gives it power praise the name of the Lord when he comes on that morning he's going to be looking for one thing the token the token is the holy spirit amen if you don't have it you may be in church you may claim to be a believer but your life will never match up to the word until you are filled with the Holy Ghost then and only then then and only then will you be able to live the life of a Believer and friend if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are not going to the Rapture amen you know the prophet would also say that you know one person told me you know brother bam said you can be baptized with the Holy Spirit every day of your life and go to hell I said well yeah that's true that's true he's talking about the anointing you know you can be you can be baptized into the anointing every day you know by the holy ghost coming upon your body and upon your spirit and then you have an emotional experience you may shout you may dance you may talk tongues and everything but if the life doesn't come out that means you only receive an emo experience in the Book of Ezekiel he go father to say amen he must receive a new heart a new spirit and his Spirit now many people receiveing new hearts and others receive a new spirit and they think they received the Holy Ghost no no no no sir praise the name of the Lord the Holy Ghost if he comes in your soul your life will change and when you receive him he abides in you he can never leave you until the day you go to Rapture there and is there to stay many Believers don't have the Holy Ghost and that's why it is hard for you to leave a Christian Life and how can you receive the Holy Ghost you only have to ask you have to believe for it you have to take time you can just come in church and have an emotional experience and say that's it no you have to seek after him you have to thirst after him unless you are hungry unless you are thirsting you cannot be filled and how can you claim you have the Holy Ghost when you still have anger when you still have lust after this after that after the other when you actually still are doing rumors all over passing this here passing that here passing it show you are not yet changed it show something in there is lacking you are the one falling from this fication into another another it means you are lacking you are lacking but unless you have the hunger for it you cannot be filled with him you have to have the hunger you have to have the thir and the Bible says blessed is he that hungers after righteousness blessed is he that thirst after righteousness they shall be filled but if you don't have the hunger for him the thirst for him you will not be filled friend and I'll be a liar to tell you you'll go to heaven praise the name of the Lord you know when he comes in your life he changes your entire nature really he is to change the nature natur the way it is cannot inherit eternal life we need a new nature and the Holy Spirit changes Natures praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and you can receive the Holy Spirit no matter the age you have even if you are 9 10 years 8 years seven years 5 years as long as you have the thk for it and the hunger for it even if you 40 you can receive the Holy Ghost you can have an experience which will change your life forever another say you you can receive the Holy Ghost silently you cannot receive the Holy Ghost silently because there is no one who has ever been born silently where you are there is but those who are born silently are all dead because if you had a still birth it's a dead birth yes if a child is born and is still it means he's dead and a prophet said some Christians who have got a still birth they have to receive some spanking of the gospel and then they will be born and then a cry will go out you know let me tell you you know our religion is not the Holy Ghost is not emotion no it's beyond emotion life is God himself but but when he comes it is an emotional experience amen hallelujah amen that crying you hear going out is not the life but that crying comes because the life has come amen so you can't tell me you receive the Holy Ghost without an experience you must have an experience you must have an experience something you can put your foot on and say that day that hour that minute God vised me and my life has never been the same again that is the faith and we are contending for that faith and I tell you friends that's what Paul preached Paul stood for it Paul believed in tongues in manifestation of tongues and interpretation of tongues and that's what he believed in and he find you know people who are against those things we are not against the manifestation of the Holy Ghost it doesn't prove it's not the absolute proof that someone is filled but it is the proof that the Holy Spirit has manifested so the person with the Holy Ghost and the one who who doesn't have him both can have the manifestation and that's a mystery because the prophet says that the the rain falls on the just and on the unjust and and and in the Bible he speaks of the latter Reign and the former rain and the prophet says the former r is the teaching rain the doctrines the pressing in order and everything but then the latter rain is the falling of the Holy Ghost and then we are in a generational time where he's giving us both the former oh my God he's giving us the former Reign and the later re at the same time in the same season here he he said ausa was not the was not the full restoration had a latter rain but they never had a former rain but you see it could not be the full restoration until the word has also been [Music] restor so the Pentecostals are not wrong in that they have the gifts and manifestation of it because that is to be expected it was promised to be restored but only restored the former part of the latter rain rather the manifestation of the gifts and the power of God but you know they could not be the original bride that had the full faith until the full word was also restored to the church and guess when does the word when does the come into view the bride only comes into view when the word and the Holy Ghost has been restored to the church we are the generation we are the people amen because we are living in the time when Mal amen has been fulfilled because he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet what will he do he will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers we are living in that time John the Baptist fulfill the first portion of the fathers of the children that is the fathers of the law to the wisdom of the J shall live by faith from the LA to Grace but the malach F the end time women would restore the hearts of the children the Gentile children the church would take their hearts by the teaching of the world and it would take us by this doctrines amen by all these doctrines of one God of water baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the manifestation of the gifts here as a woman is covering the second coming of our Lord Jesus talk about the tribulation the Rapture no women preacher no women preacher in the Bible he thought about all that deons pastors must all be married men or rather married to one wife I should say dress in modest clothing Grace not this Grace oh because we have Grace let us do what we want said no no no Grace means the Life of Christ gives you the righteousness of God and then you can leave the world not yours but his and you live that's the grace that he told modest clothing operations of church offices and Gifts Cain as a son of the wicked one these were all teachings taught by Paul Believers Maring Believers believer not not not fashioning after the world all this were doctrines and teachings taugh by Apostle Paul but the church lost it in the way but what did he say when Malachi 4 comes on the scene Matthew 1711 he said and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias Elijah truly shall first come before Jesus comes and when he comes he will restore all things Hallelujah the former rain and the latter rain shall be restored in the same season amen the teaching of the word the full doctrines of the Bible everything Paul tgh everything the apostles belied together with the power of it together with the Holy Ghost together with the manifestation of it will all be restored again to the ch that's what he Tau and here we are we have been restored again back again to the beginning and this is the faith we are contending for praise the name of the Lord and I'll finish it off tonight with this quot praise God not for one moment brother bam says do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fell organization I have never done that and I'll will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and the people and and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite and plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him and even as I trusted in my heart that I have given my all to him and he says God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart that is the message of the hour that is the anti message that's what we believe and we are contending for that faith God bless you you may stand on your Fe Amen Let us give him a CP of Praise hallelujah hallelujah father
