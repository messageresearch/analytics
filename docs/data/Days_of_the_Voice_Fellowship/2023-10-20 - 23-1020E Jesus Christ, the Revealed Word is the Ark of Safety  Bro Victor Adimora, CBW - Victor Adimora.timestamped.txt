[23:03] away but my words shall not pass
[23:08] away but of the day and the hour knoweth
[23:11] no
[23:12] man know not the angels of heaven but my
[23:15] father
[23:16] only but as the days of Noah were so
[23:21] shall also the coming of the son of man
[23:24] be for as it is in the days that were
[23:26] before the flood they were eaten and
[23:28] drinken and marrying and given in
[23:30] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[23:33] into the ark and knew not until the
[23:36] flood came and took them away so shall
[23:38] also the coming of the C of man be then
[23:42] shall two be in the field and one shall
[23:44] be taken and the other left two women
[23:47] shall be grinding at the Mill the one
[23:49] shall be taken and the other left watch
[23:53] therefore for ye know not what hour your
[23:56] lord doth come amen you may have your
[24:06] seats this evening by the grace of
[24:11] God we want to encourage
[24:13] you we want to encourage
[24:17] you and strengthen you by the
[24:22] word the efforts of man can do
[24:24] [Music]
[24:26] nothing the ability of man can do
[24:29] [Music]
[24:31] nothing but the word of God is what we
[24:36] need and when the word comes by your
[24:40] way it is the food you need in due
[24:45] season it gives you strength to
[24:49] overcome it gives you strength in
[24:52] prayer it gives you strength in
[24:55] Walking it gives you strength in
[24:59] talking it gives you strength amongst
[25:01] your
[25:02] peers
[25:05] friends gives you strength amongst your
[25:10] co-workers and and it's a light that
[25:14] shines light that
[25:17] shines in the midst of a dark
[25:22] world so by the grace of
[25:26] God this evening
[25:29] we want to speak
[25:31] on
[25:33] Christ the revealed
[25:36] word is the Ark of
[25:42] Safety Jesus
[25:44] Christ the revealed
[25:47] word is the Ark of
[25:50] [Applause]
[25:53] Safety so the Bible said as it was in
[25:56] the days of Noah
[26:01] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[26:03] of
[26:05] man if we look back to the days of
[26:09] Noah we find out they were doing the
[26:11] same thing that we're doing
[26:15] today they were
[26:17] eating they were drinking they were
[26:22] carousing they were building
[26:24] houses buying lands but they were
[26:28] missing the revealed word for their
[26:32] hour they were missing the revealed word
[26:34] for their
[26:38] hour so it took a prophet
[26:42] coming in this
[26:44] generation to turn our hearts back to
[26:47] the revealed
[26:51] word Jesus
[26:53] Christ is the Ark of Safety
[27:00] and Christ is the revealed word for this
[27:07] hour and the fullness of
[27:10] life of Jesus
[27:13] Christ has been loosed to the
[27:18] believer at the opening and the
[27:20] unveiling of the Seven
[27:24] Seals when the seals were open
[27:28] it Loos the power to the
[27:31] believer it Loos an anointing to the
[27:35] believer to give them strength in this
[27:39] hour to overcome every Power Of
[27:44] Satan to overcome every force of
[27:48] darkness and that's why the Bible
[27:51] says that no weapon formed against you
[27:54] shall prosper no weapon formed against
[27:56] you
[28:00] shall
[28:00] [Music]
[28:02] prosper and any tongue that rises up
[28:04] against
[28:07] you you shall
[28:13] condemn for this is the
[28:17] heritage of the Servants of the lord of
[28:20] the Servants of the
[28:23] Lord so do you realize that is your
[28:26] possession
[28:30] every promise in the
[28:33] scripture belongs to
[28:37] you when you come into this body when
[28:40] you come into this
[28:42] body the body of Jesus
[28:45] Christ every promise in the
[28:48] book belongs to
[28:51] you and Faith
[28:54] cometh by hearing the word
[28:58] and when you hear the
[28:59] word it gives you the faith to receive
[29:02] the
[29:04] word hold to lay hold lay hold lay hold
[29:09] lay hold lay
[29:12] hold of every
[29:15] scripture amen
[29:17] Amen brother brandham
[29:20] said and I believe that this Universal
[29:26] Revival
[29:28] that's sweeping the lands
[29:31] today is an
[29:35] indication of the
[29:37] message like it was in the days of
[29:41] Noah while men and
[29:45] women are rioting in
[29:49] sin and Noah had a ftic
[29:51] [Music]
[29:54] gospel that he
[29:56] preached but he called the
[30:00] people to an arc of
[30:02] [Music]
[30:04] safety and I believe that the Glorious
[30:06] [Music]
[30:08] Gospel of the Son of
[30:11] God manifested by the Holy
[30:14] Ghost it's sweeping the country
[30:18] today and bringing the people into the
[30:22] ark which is Jesus
[30:26] Christ
[30:27] safely
[30:30] secured from all the judgments that's
[30:32] going
[30:35] come and when the judgments
[30:39] strike and the atomic powers and the
[30:42] Rocks the
[30:45] Nations and the atomic Powers rocks the
[30:52] Nations will ride above the waves into
[30:56] Glory
[30:59] [Music]
[31:00] this
[31:02] word that God has sent in this
[31:05] hour is your
[31:08] protection this
[31:10] message that God has sent through the
[31:13] voice of William
[31:16] brandham is your
[31:17] [Music]
[31:19] safety this
[31:20] message that God has sent in this
[31:24] hour through the voice of William
[31:26] brandham
[31:29] is your rest is your
[31:33] rest
[31:35] amen I want to show you something
[31:38] here so Noah was a
[31:42] type of the
[31:44] remnant the Jews that were carried
[31:47] through the
[31:50] tribulation but
[31:52] Enoch was a type of the true
[31:56] church
[31:57] he was a type of the elected
[32:02] bride that did not go through the
[32:06] tribulation but was caught away in the
[32:11] Rapture so the prophet of God would
[32:13] say that Enoch was a type of the Bride
[32:16] of Jesus
[32:19] Christ brother R
[32:21] said now it's the same thing
[32:25] today we are at the end
[32:30] time now those people ought to have
[32:34] known
[32:40] people Noah was a type of the Jews that
[32:42] will be carried over to the
[32:45] [Music]
[32:48] tribulation Enoch was a type of the real
[32:51] [Music]
[32:53] message for Enoch was taken up and then
[32:57] the flood
[33:01] came and now the church will be taken
[33:06] away so that God can deal with the
[33:09] [Music]
[33:13] Jews the
[33:17] 144,000 as we've been through the
[33:21] scriptures something I want to show you
[33:23] in the
[33:25] scripture is the type of the
[33:30] Ark there's four examples of the Ark in
[33:33] the
[33:37] scripture and we want to talk about a
[33:39] few of
[33:41] them the first one is Noah's
[33:46] Ark the Bible says here in Genesis
[33:49] chapter
[33:51] 6 God speaking to
[33:54] Noah he said make the an ark of
[33:57] gopherwood
[34:01] rooms shalt thou make in the
[34:06] ark and shalt pitch it
[34:10] within and without with
[34:12] [Music]
[34:14] pitch so brother Baron would
[34:17] say that the gopherwood was a type of
[34:19] the
[34:24] believer because the goer wood was soft
[34:27] and
[34:28] Hollow soft and
[34:34] Hollow so listen what brother Braham
[34:36] said
[34:37] here the ark was made out of gopherwood
[34:47] it's nothing but just
[34:55] Hollow everything is taken out of
[34:58] it it's grow that
[35:01] way the lightest wood there is the
[35:05] lightest wood there
[35:09] is now why did they do
[35:12] [Music]
[35:13] that so it could soak it in with
[35:16] [Music]
[35:18] pitch and the real seed of
[35:22] God is an absorbent for the spirit
[35:30] all denominations is took
[35:33] out all unbelief is
[35:36] [Music]
[35:37] out and when the Holy Spirit comes into
[35:40] the germ of
[35:43] life when the Holy Spirit comes into the
[35:46] germ of
[35:50] life it produces another seed just
[35:55] exactly another Son of
[35:59] God another daughter of
[36:02] God when that seed comes into the
[36:05] presence of a Shak
[36:08] Glory will bring the life that's in the
[36:11] sea it will bring forth the life that's
[36:13] in the
[36:16] sea amen another amateur
[36:22] God another miniature

[36:30] Creator do you realize that's who you
[36:34] are your Minature

[36:47] it
[36:48] you you say I don't feel
[36:51] it I don't look like
[36:54] it it doesn't matter what you feel like
[36:58] it doesn't matter your level of
[37:01] Education it doesn't matter how much
[37:03] money you
[37:05] have but what
[37:08] matters is what God Said in his
[37:10] [Applause]
[37:12] word God said in his
[37:14] word that you are more than
[37:18] conquerors you are more than
[37:20] conquerors and greater is he that's in
[37:24] you than he that's in the world
[37:27] what than he that's in the world greater
[37:29] is he that's in you than he that's in
[37:30] the
[37:34] world Amen
[37:37] you're you're a mighty
[37:40] Army and when you recognize who you
[37:44] are the prophet said you're an
[37:46] invincible
[37:46] [Applause]
[37:49] Army you're an invincible
[37:52] Army praise
[37:55] God
[38:00] hallelujah amen see what I'm trying to
[38:02] show you
[38:05] tonight is that you are
[38:07] [Music]
[38:08] actually you become the
[38:12] ark and I prove to you in the
[38:16] scripture that you become the
[38:18] [Applause]

[40:28] it means to
[40:32] atone it means to stand between stand
[40:38] between it means to
[40:43] intercede so now this
[40:47] pitch was in between the gopherwood
[40:51] it was to be sealed
[40:55] Within
[40:56] and
[40:59] without a type of the Holy
[41:02] Ghost not just a little bit here a
[41:05] little bit
[41:06] there but a fulfilling of the
[41:10] believer to fill the believer inside and

[41:20] nature and from the outside is expressed
[41:22] in
[41:24] life this holy ghost
[41:27] power that was loose to the message of
[41:30] the
[41:31] hour it brings forth a holy
[41:35] life brings forth a consecrated life
[41:38] that's what consecrated
[41:41] life that when you walk when you talk
[41:45] when you talk when you
[41:48] think the world wonders what happened to
[41:52] you but you can tell
[41:55] them that I've become an
[41:58] ark I've become part of the Ark of Jesus
[42:02] Christ you become the gopherwood
[42:07] filled with the
[42:08] [Music]
[42:10] pitch that makes up the Ark of Jesus
[42:14] Christ it begins to make up the body the
[42:18] body of Jesus
[42:20] Christ to reach
[42:22] out to a sick and dying world
[42:28] the Bible says that you are a
[42:32] light set upon a hill set upon a hill on
[42:41] Hill amen you are the light of the
[42:46] world Amen do you
[42:49] realize that being part of the
[42:53] body in Christ the revealed word
[42:57] word is your
[43:01] atonement by being born
[43:05] again and becoming part of the revealed
[43:08] word of this
[43:10] hour the revealed word is your
[43:16] atonement it's your
[43:18] protection from the wrath of
[43:21] God that's coming upon this this
[43:25] age it's your
[43:27] protection from the judgments of
[43:30] God that's coming upon this
[43:33] world what you say brother Victor what
[43:36] are you talking
[43:38] about life is good life is
[43:42] good I have my
[43:44] friends I have my
[43:47] associates I have my job I have my wife
[43:52] I have my husband I have my
[43:55] kids I have everything that makes me
[43:59] comfortable but do you
[44:02] realize this message
[44:05] came to prepare us for our body
[44:09] change we have not been called to stay
[44:13] here we've not been called to remain
[44:15] upon this
[44:17] Earth the seat of God inside of
[44:21] you is longing for a body
[44:25] change
[44:27] it's longing to leave this world leave
[44:31] this
[44:32] world and put on a body
[44:36] Immortal and that's why the word came by
[44:39] your
[44:41] way to
[44:43] Quicken or make
[44:48] alive the seed of God that laid there
[44:51] before the foundation of the
[44:54] world
[44:57] [Applause]
[44:58] and you are the seed of
[45:01] God that's why you can be
[45:05] reborn for only the seed of
[45:08] God can be born
[45:11] again because being born
[45:14] again is a personal
[45:18] revelation of Jesus Christ to
[45:21] you so it takes the Holy
[45:24] Ghost that's present here
[45:27] tonight to reveal the word to
[45:31] you that you may
[45:34] realize that I'm not from

[52:17] provides your marital
[52:19] needs he provides the needs in your

[52:24] spirit
[52:26] because you surrendered
[52:29] everything my father
[52:32] says that he owns a cattle in a thousand
[52:37] hills so it seems like things aren't
[52:39] working
[52:41] out but one day you'll be walking one
[52:44] day you'll be
[52:45] walking and you'll look back and be like

[53:29] man so whatever you've surrendered for
[53:34] God he will pour back a
[53:41] hundredfold but I want to say
[53:44] something the denominational mindset of
[53:47] that
[53:50] scripture is that God is going to give
[53:52] me lands and wealth and money
[53:57] but I want you to I want you to stop for
[53:59] a
[54:00] minute and look around
[54:03] you and realize that God has given you
[54:07] family God has given you Brothers and

[55:50] faith you say I have a little bit of
[55:54] faith Bible said that a Mustard Seed

[56:05] work and it begins to move the mountains
[56:08] in your
[56:09] life but you say I struggle with
[56:13] depression I struggle with

[57:51] Arc is the Ark of the Covenant
[57:57] how many know the Ark of the Covenant in
[57:58] the
[58:01] scripture so the Ark of the
[58:05] Covenant now that Ark was made out of
[58:08] shittim
[58:10] wood wood Ora
[58:18] wood and it was overlaid with pure
[58:22] gold it was overlaid with gold
[58:27] the Bible says here and thou shalt
[58:31] overlay with pure
[58:36] gold within and
[58:39] without shout th overlay
[58:43] it listen people want to people want to
[58:46] come yes people want to
[58:48] come and tell you this Bible's not
[58:52] real oh my
[58:55] the
[58:59] theologians and all sorts of ideas of
[59:04] man want to take the power out of the
[59:09] scripture but I want to show you a
[59:10] little
[59:12] seed and I want to tell you that God
[59:15] doesn't make
[59:17] mistakes what God Said in his
[59:20] word he will
[59:23] fulfill every promise in the
[59:26] book it is yay and
[59:30] amen so here the Bible
[59:33] says God said overlay the ark overlay
[59:38] the
[59:42] ark with pure
[59:45] gold do you did you
[59:48] notice that the ark that Noah
[59:53] built was also overlaid with pitch
[59:56] inside and
[1:00:00] out God's order doesn't change God's
[1:00:04] order doesn't
[1:00:07] change what he did in
[1:00:09] Genesis he will do in
[1:00:12] Revelations what he did a year
[1:00:15] ago he will do again
[1:00:18] today because Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ is the same
[1:00:23] yesterday day and
[1:00:25] forever and if you can believe
[1:00:29] tonight for whatever is you need
[1:00:32] whatever you
[1:00:33] need and brother Ram said if you come on
[1:00:37] the same basis of
[1:00:41] faith God is
[1:00:45] obligated to meet your
[1:00:48] need
[1:00:50] hallelujah
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:53] amen hallelujah
[1:00:57] amen so I want you to notice how I want
[1:00:59] to get to something here I'm going to
[1:01:00] skip through some of this
[1:01:03] here for the sake of
[1:01:06] time now overlaid with pure
[1:01:11] gold gold speaks of
[1:01:14] deity gold speaks of
[1:01:23] deity okay
[1:01:26] pure gold speaks of
[1:01:30] deity and the Bible says that you should
[1:01:34] Crown the ark with gold crown it with
[1:01:38] gold which speaks of
[1:01:42] Splendor or
[1:01:47] sovereignty or
[1:01:49] honor now what I want to show you here
[1:01:52] for a few
[1:01:53] minutes is that the Ark of the Covenant
[1:01:56] which is
[1:02:01] Christ was also speaking of
[1:02:05] you so the Ark in the
[1:02:09] scripture is speaking also of the bride
[1:02:12] of
[1:02:14] Christ you have to
[1:02:17] realize that all that God
[1:02:20] was he poured into
[1:02:23] Christ and all that Christ
[1:02:25] was he's poured into the
[1:02:29] church so you become life of his
[1:02:33] life bone of his
[1:02:35] bone flesh of his
[1:02:38] flesh Spirit of his
[1:02:40] spirit amen
[1:02:43] amen so here we
[1:02:45] are that the that the Ark of the
[1:02:48] Covenant
[1:02:50] now was made after the pattern of the
[1:02:53] Tabernacle
[1:03:00] amen and and and part of that Arc of the
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] Covenant was the mercy
[1:03:13] seat and the and the mercy
[1:03:16] seat which no one could approach brother
[1:03:19] Ram
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:21] says unless there was an atonement
[1:03:26] when it was sprinkled with
[1:03:29] blood then it became The Mercy
[1:03:35] Seat
[1:03:38] but but after the blood was taken
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:43] off then it became a judgment
[1:03:46] [Music]
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:49] seat amen so brother Brown
[1:03:52] says this holy fire from the
[1:03:57] altar being passed from lamp to
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] lamp is a wonderful
[1:04:07] type of of the holy spirit in the seven
[1:04:10] Church
[1:04:14] ages the original outpouring of
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:21] Pentecost which outpouring came Direct
[1:04:24] from
[1:04:26] Jesus on The Mercy
[1:04:30] Seat is end doing his
[1:04:34] church through all the Seven
[1:04:37] Ages and showing forth
[1:04:40] perfectly that Jesus Christ is the
[1:04:44] same amen so this holy
[1:04:47] fire the fire that Lit the candlesticks
[1:04:50] in
[1:04:52] Revelations God lit every
[1:04:56] age but now in this last
[1:05:00] day the outpouring of
[1:05:02] Pentecost the outpouring of
[1:05:06] Pentecost was not a
[1:05:10] denomination it was an
[1:05:13] experience and so when Pentecost
[1:05:17] stopped and became a Pentecostal
[1:05:21] organization they died right there
[1:05:25] because God kept moving
[1:05:28] on God kept moving on to the unveiling
[1:05:30] of the message of this hour come again
[1:05:32] sorry God kept moving
[1:05:35] on to the unveiling of the message of
[1:05:38] this
[1:05:42] hour and that's why God's been going
[1:05:44] through the
[1:05:46] land sounding forth the
[1:05:49] message calling some out of Baptist
[1:05:53] calling some out of the
[1:05:55] Baptist some out of the
[1:06:00] wans some out of
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:03] Pentecost into the body of Jesus
[1:06:07] Christ Church we've not been we've not
[1:06:10] been called into another
[1:06:14] church we've not been called into
[1:06:16] another
[1:06:19] organization we've been called into the
[1:06:21] body of Jesus Christ
[1:06:25] and the body is the
[1:06:26] [Applause]

[1:06:59] Place of the Living
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:04] God so I want you to note something
[1:07:09] here it wasn't uh it wasn't just the
[1:07:14] structure of the Ark what the
[1:07:19] structure that saved the
[1:07:22] people it wasn't touching the Ark of the
[1:07:25] Covenant that save the
[1:07:29] people but if you realize in the
[1:07:33] scripture there was a word that went
[1:07:36] forth
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:40] first God said through his
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:44] Prophet come into the
[1:07:47] ark God said through his Prophet
[1:07:51] Joshua let the Ark of the Covenant it go
[1:07:54] before the
[1:07:56] people it wasn't the the stone and the
[1:07:59] wood and the
[1:08:00] [Music]
