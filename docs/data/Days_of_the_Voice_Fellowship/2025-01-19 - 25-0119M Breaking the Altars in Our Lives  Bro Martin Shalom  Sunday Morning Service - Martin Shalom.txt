battle blessed be the name of the Lord amen keep praying for them amen shall we turn to our Bible this morning amen amen uh let's turn to the book of uh second second chonicles we are reading from vers 34 beginning from chapter4 verse amen Lord Jesus we thank you for the reading of the word pray that you come and add your anointing upon that the great holy spirit will come and give us the inspiration in the name of Jesus Christ amen say that jiah was 8 years old when he began to Reign and and he reigned in Jerusalem one 30 years and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of David his father and declined neither to do right neither to the right hand nor to the left for in the eighth year of his Reign while he was yet young he began to seek after God of David his father and in the 12th year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places andto The Groves in the cved images and the molten images and they break down the altars of uh of balim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the gr and the Groves and the carved images and the molten images he break in pieces and made dust of them and stred it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them and he burned the bones of the priest upon their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem and so did he in the city of manasse and Ephraim and Simeon even unto Nepali with uh with their mats round about and when he had broken down the altars and the Groves and had bitten the the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel he returned to Jerusalem [Music] fore [Music] for for the Lord reading the blessing the bless reading of you may have your seats praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah are you fine you turn around and check your brother sisters in amen amen uh this morning I have something that I want us to share and I will uh take my text from the scripture we have read and I call it uh from this verse verse 7 where he say that and he and when he had br Bren down the altars and the Groves and had beaten the graven images into the powder and cut them and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel and he returned to Jerusalem [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord amen I'll call my sharing this morning tearing down the altars or breaking down the altars in our lives blessed be the name of the amen you know an idol uh the the definition for an [Music] idol here say that an idol or an idol or image okay an ID is image or representation of a god used as an object of worship blessed be the name of the Lord but remember the Bible says that God does not share his worship with blessed be the name of the Lord as we are moving we are going to see the some of these things there are some things in our lives which maybe you never know it has been an idol to you without even you knowing blessed be the name of the Lord and when we go back to this scripture we are seeing Josiah blessed be the name of the Lord Josiah was the grandson of mani and if you read second chronicles you see how these Kings behave how they reign and how they Deed from God and what followed after that blessed be the name of the Lord but there is something special about Josiah praise be to God because if you come back up here when man died and then his son inherited him blessed be the name of the Lord and his son was called Ammon and the Bible says in 2 Chronicles 33 ver 21 that Ammon was 2 and 20 years old when he began to Reign and Reign two years in Jerusalem but but he did that which was evil in the sight of the [Music] Lord his father for am sacrific all the covered images which man his father and had made and served them and humbled not himself before the Lord man his father and humbled himself but Ammon trespassed more and more blessed be the name of the Lord you remember in Kings that when Israel sinned against God God gave them in the hands of their enemies and each time God gave them the house of the en they knew where the problem was and go back to God and repent of their sins amen and again received them blessed be the name of the Lord and there God sent them judges they sinned again and then they repent again and then God delivers them blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have just read we are seeing jah's father was an ID worshiper because his grandfather was also an idol worshiper but if you read the story of man man when he sinned against God and God gave them to gave him up the hands of his enemies and he was taken in C he cried to God he repented and God remembered them amen and after he died his son picked the man from and he did exactly like his father blessed be the name of the Lord amen there is something that I want to show you this morning it's not a must that you have to live like your parents you have to live like your grandfather blessed be the name of the Lord and here when when comes blessed be the name of the Lord the Bible says he was just 8 years old he began to re and in Jerusalem and and and 30 years in Jerusalem 1 and3 years and he did that which was right in the sight of the never did like his father like his grandfather and walked in the ways of David father and decline neither to the right hand not the left for in the E year of his Reign while he was yet young he began to seek after God blessed be the name of the it is always good to see God when you are young amen he never went the ways of his father but he started to see God at his early AG blessed be the name of the Lord
