I'd like us to turn to the word tonight. We just want to continue with the Sunday service, Sunday sermon that we were dealing with dity tabernacord in man. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. I I think we finished off when we were talking about uh Mary. and how she was highly favored. Amen. And uh we we talked about the angel coming to Mary. Uh but for a little rehearsal we can read Luke chapter 4 chapter 2 once again vers Eight. I believe everybody's there. If you're there, say amen. Yeah. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And and lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around about them, and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." And this shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest and and on the and on earth peace, good will toward men." And it came to pass as the angel were go as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherd said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us." And they came with hest and found Mary and Joseph and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that had it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them. May the Lord bless you. You may be seated. This evening we are also speaking to Evening Light Bright [Music] Tabernacle. I'd like to greet the saints on Zoom tonight. May the Lord bless you all. And to the saints here, this will be part two of what we talked about. And so because of the Zoom, we'll just do um um one hour. So we're trying to make it brief. So just pray for me will you? Amen. So the we talk we are talking about the subject of dity tabernacle in man and um you know the reason why I read this scripture told you on Sunday is because you know it's unfolding the plan of God which he had purposed in him before the foundation of the world. [Music] And I showed you that the devil usually has a plan. And we we read talked about scriptures where in the book of revelation it speaks about the falling of the devil on earth. He was defeated in heaven and he came down to the earth. So we are fighting a defeated devil. Our enemy is defeated. So if if you have fever or if you have any any sickness or you have any problem in a mountain, you know that is an enemy. It seems a temptation. It's an enemy. The flesh is an enemy to you. But you see, it's a defeated enemy. We are not fighting an enemy that we think will be defeated. He came down to earth as a defeated devil and he remains as such. Amen. But when he came down, I would think being a creature of God, he was created to be [Music] perfect. He was created to be perfect. You know the Bible to be perfect. Be perfect. Yes. That's what the Bible says. He was created. He was perfect until iniquity was found in him. So you know those are kind of things that we may not completely understand because someone may ask if the devil was created perfect and for your information he was not the devil. He was called Lucifer because all angels are perfect. They are meant to be perfect. That's why when an angel sins he cannot be forgiven. There is no forgiveness for for angels sinners just like there is no forgiveness for serpent seed because they are already sinners. Okay, I want you to hold this. You see the serpent seed will see serpent seed does not sin but serpent seed is a sinner. You are a sinner not because you have sinned. You are a sinner because you have committed sin. You are not meant to sin. Are you following me now? But to them they are sinners not because they committed sin but they are sinners to begin with. But you know Jesus can only forgive those who committed sin. They did something which was bad that they were not supposed to do. They were not meant to do it. They were meant to be perfect. They were never sinners. That's why I am not a sinner. I am a child of God. But you see when I sinned, he forgave my sin. Why did he forgive my sin? Because I was in him before the foundation of the world. And then he says, he that is born of God cannot commit sin because his seed remains in him. Praise the name of the Lord. So we are not judged. because we are not sinners. Okay, he missed there. You know, we we are not judged because we cannot be judged already because we are not sinners. You understand? We are not sinners. We are born to believe. I am born to believe. I cannot unbelieve the word. I am a believer even when sometimes wrong things happen in my life. I just did not mean to do that. But in my heart, I am born to be a believer. But you see that is a seed of God. The seed remains a seed. But angels, they are born also to be perfect. But you see, that's why when angels sin, they cannot be redeemed back. Because Jesus did not die for angels. Jesus died for Adam's race. He died, Amen. for for human beings. Those who were his seed, those who were in him before the foundation of the world, those are the ones who he died for. Therefore, when they sin, he redeems them. Are you following me? But angels cannot be redeemed. And Lucifer is one of them. When he sinned, iniquity was found in him. He cannot, you could not be redeemed. But all the gifts he had, he remained with them. He remained with the singing. He remained with the beauty. He remained with the powers. He remained with the anointings. But he did not continue to be who he became a devil. A dragon. Bible calls him a dragon. that old serpent, the devil, a deceiver, the father of lies. But we see he had a plan. He thought he will ascend above the stars of God, become God. But when he failed at that, he said, "Okay, I'll go down to the human race. That's my plan B and take over in the human race. If I can't take over, I'll confuse the human race and I will rule over them. And right now, he's ruling over the world. You see, the devil thinks he's ruling over the world. But I can I can tell you this. There are those the devil cannot rule over. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Because the devil cannot rule over. They are meant to be perfect. They are meant to be deity tabernacled in man. Amen. If I cannot do that, the devil thought, I will steal, I will kill, and I will destroy the human race. And I showed you that that was the plan of Satan. But you see where the devil has multitude of plans. God has one plan. By the way, there is one thing that comforts me. Amen. To know to know that when God thought of me, whatever he thought of me, he cannot think another. He cannot change his mind. So no matter how much you have done at his body in his life, God did not change his mind about you. That is why it is pride. If you fall away and you feel that God cannot restore you back, if you're a child of God and and you feel like a sinner and the word of God is preached, as a child of God, you must accept. You must accept your freedom. You must accept the word of God. If God says you are good and you're not bad, you cannot say no. You don't know what you're talking about, not for someone else, let me tell it is for you. It is pride for you not to accept the pattern given to you. Amen. Whatever God thought of me can never change it. He will never change it because his first thought is as perfect as he is. Amen. And God had a plan. And he talked about his plan as a plan which was a perfect plan. It was a winning plan. No angel. No man knew it. It was a plan which was top secret. It was hidden away. You know when Adam and Eve was sinning in the garden of Eden the angels tried to go and help the situation and many people ask a question. If God is a loving God why didn't he hinder Satan from tempting Eve and the answer is simple. Because God had a plan and the plan he had then is the plan he has now. If God allows you to be found in any situation, it is because he has a plan. We must learn to be to be to behave like believers. Let us learn to trust God. In good situations, bad situations. Even when you are confused and you are helpless, God has a plan. Even when you think you have failed yourself, failed your parents, failed your pastor, failed everyone. God has a plan. Many times when I feel I've failed myself. But you know, you set out ambitions. You say, "I want to do this, this, this, and this." I remember the scripture. The footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. David said, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow man, I fear not." There is nothing goes wrong in a a life of a believer. Am I preaching to someone? In a life of a believer, everything is perfect. Everything is good. That's why the Bible says all things all together that love God that are called according to his purpose. I am not God according to my purpose. God according to his purpose and I believe I'm a child of God. All the good, all the bad works for good. And God has a plan for me. It's called Alpha and Omega Plan. Omega. He kept it hidden. You know this plan. No angel knew it. He left Adam and Eve to sin. He left them to fall away because he had a plan to come and redeem them. Amen. I wanted to think about it. How would he have been called a redeemer if he did not redeem anybody? How would he have been called a savior if he did not save anybody? So he told the angel Gabriel and all the other angels, don't go. They couldn't understand. Why would we go to do the work we are made to do? Because there is something I want to be. There is something I want to become. I cannot become it. If my son does not fall away, he has to fall away so I can come and say where are you? And when he comes, then I'll get a C of them to eat. Then I'll be a redeemer. But that was only potentially. That was just the beginning. The devil did not understand co of skin. This is all you can do. But that was the beginning. When God is beginning his work at you, you may not see it. Others may not see it, but a believer is made to believe. Let us always believe in the plan of God for our life. Tell your neighbor, God has a plan. Hallelujah. God told all the angels. Step aside. Step aside. It looks like the devil is winning. But God had a plan. And on Sunday we wanted to talk about uh we we started trying to talk about the execution of the plan. I will not go repeat what we talked about on Sunday but I want to go down to the execution of the plan. Luke 1 28 Luke 1 28 And the angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." Talking of Mary. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The angel came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou art highly favored. Thou art highly favored." I want us to see something. Why would the angel come and speak this word? Because we are looking at something that was hidden for ages. Something that was hidden for thousands of years. No angel in heaven knew. No man on earth. It was hidden. It was kept away. But the moment it was going to be executed, God called one angel and his name is Gabriel. The one who sends the message. The one who sends the tidings from the presence of God. He called him. He said, "Gabriel, it is time." Gabriel look what it is time for that top secret plan to be unveiled. It is time. The season has arrived. Let me tell you, brethren, many times you may have questions about tomorrow, about your life. Keep the faith. Do not lose faith because there is always a time. There is always a season for the plan of God to unfold. Amen. And the angel said what? He said, "Now go to the earth." You remember because God had already said it in the book of Genesis. You know when he when he gave that prophecy if you will call it and I will put an en between thee and the woman. and between thy seed and their seed, he shall bruise thy hair, and thou shall bruise his head. So he's talking about the seed of the woman, the seed of a woman is a child who is born by a woman without the help of a man, without man giving the woman seed, it will be the seed of the woman. There's only one that was that way. That was Jesus. Jesus is the seed of the woman. But before that, no one knew. When it was spoken by God, it was not understood. It was still a secret. But when the angel came, the angel came to a woman. The angel did not come to someone educated. The angel did not come to a theologian. The angel did not come to someone with DD or LLD. That's all good, but that's not the qualification of revelation. It's not about what you have or what qualifies you. It's about who you are. Glory. Amen. Amen. I want you to understand that in this world, God does not choose everybody. There are those who are favored. Not everyone is bride. Think about it. Many are called, but few are chosen. From the few, I am one of them. You are one of them. It is a privilege. Hallelujah. And there was a promise that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son. And it was it it it sounded as if it is something that is no longer a secret when Isaiah prophesied it. But you see, it was still a hidden secret. until the revelation of that secret. How does God reveal it? By manifesting [Music] it. Are you following me now? And the angel came and said, "Hail Mary, thou at highly favor. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. The secret which was hidden from all ages from all generations before it was going to be revealed to this little woman. And that's why the angel said, "You are highly favored. The mystery of God, the mystery of God coming down, tabernacling among men was going to be revealed. Hallelujah. And the first one to know was Mary. That's why she was highly favored. Not everybody knows the mystery of God, but you know the mystery of God. And you are highly favored. Can you shout, I am highly favored. When it was time for God to now execute his plan, the first one to know was me. The second one was the shepherd. The things these humble people knew. Even the kings did not know. These were privileged people. The things you know, not even the presidents know, not even the kings know, not even the educated know. You are privileged. We are privileged. Thank God for the ending message. Hallelujah. Amen. We are privileged. The things we know, not even the kings know. We are privileged. Tell your neighbor, you're privileged. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. I am privileged. He says, look at it this way. Oh, too many read the Bible where it says Acts 238. Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ. for the remission of sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and just they just pass right now. They don't see it. If they saw it by getting in the spirit, they would have known that it if they want to receive the Holy Spirit, they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And then God would be duty bound. to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Spirit. They never get in the spirit or it would have to happen to them exactly as the word says. And then he says, "Pray to God for a revelation by his spirit." Why many are baptized and they don't have the Holy Spirit? because they don't have revelation. Brethren, do you see the importance of revelation? When it is revealed to you personally, it will happen as he has said. And the angel said unto her, "Fear not Mary, for thou has found favor with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus. He shall be great and and and and shall be called the son of the highest. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over the house of Judah forever, and of his kingdom there shall be. Then said Mary unto him, How shall this be? Seeing I know not a man. And the angel said unto Peter, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the son of God." Hallelujah. By the way, let me pause a moment to tell you. Do you realize nothing could stop this? Amen. It was the season for it to be fulfilled. God had already seen it. God had already said it. Right? In Genesis, he had prophesied about the seed of the world. The prophets Isaiah and others, they saw the same thing. They prophesied about it. And now it was the time for it to happen. It was the time for it to be fulfilled and nothing could stop it. The devil could not stop it. Was the devil alive? Yes. He was alive in hell, but he could not stop it. It was the time for God to be tabernacled in man. Do you know? I don't honestly I don't know if the angel Gabriel actually knew what he was talking about. God himself was going to come down in human flesh. That was what was prophesied. It was time for it to happen. No one could stop it. No man could stop him. No angel could stop him. Even if Joseph refused, he could not stop him. All the church, they could not stop him. You know, maybe there was at the time for disease who had their virgins because they were reading the same scripture but they had no revelation. Maybe they also had virgin and they had a program, church program of virgin because the scripture was saying a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son. So this was a prophecy by one of their prophets. Maybe they had a ministry of virgin and they they had a place they were keeping them and they would provide everything they wanted. They will not allow any money that those are virgins. They are kept for the sake of the Holy Spirit overshadowing them. God will come and choose one. But you know God is the way he does things. He passes all those who think they are organized and he go to the disorganized. Someone told me one day. How do you think you are the bride of Christ? Where is your headquarters? Who is your archbishop? How are your churches structured? And I told him, brother, Our headquarters is in heaven. Our bishop is Jesus Christ. We are structured according to the Holy Ghost. And the Bible, he said you are disorganized. How can you even correct your preachers? Because you are disorganized and they think they are the true because they have the systems. Brethren, God bypasses all that. God doesn't look at the systems and we bring it down even to you as an individual. It is good to go to school. It is going is good to get those accolades then you'll get good job. Can we say amen? Can we say amen? But let me also say amen. Don't call me a fanatic. Even if you're disorganized and you have no education and you have no job, God is able to call your name, God is able to organize something out of nothing and build you and make you responsible. Let me tell you, the most responsible people and the believers of the word. That's why let the world take everything. Don't let them ever take Christ from you. Amen. Because this organizes us. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I want to have an education. I want to have the degree. I want to have the master. I want to have the PhD. I want to have Christ. [Applause] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Have that and then you can have everything else. Praise the name of the Lord. If I passed a virgin and he came to one who was engaged. He even came to the one who was engaged because because he wanted to confuse those who thought they know. According to them, this one did not qualify because she already had love feeling for somebody else. But God came to her because she qualified. How did she qualify? She had a heart to believe. She had a heart to receive the word. Let your heart always be receive the word. When the word of God is preached to you, God will harden your heart. Release your heart to minister to you. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord and the Holy He says, "How shall these things be?" He said, "Don't you worry, Mary. The Holy Ghost shall come upon you. The power of the highest shall overshadow." Amen. And who was Jesus? Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God was made manifest in the flesh. Amen. Amen. Justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, lived on in the world, and received up into glory. Who? God. Not the second person. But God, God was manifest in flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world. Who do we preach? Jesus. Who do we believe on as our savior? Jesus. Who came in flesh? What is his name? Jesus. But the Bible say that was not just Jesus. That was God himself. The creator of heaven and earth. John 8 5:58. Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am." Before Abraham was, I I am. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What does that mean? Hebrews 138 Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. He did not say I was. He said I am present continuous before even Abraham was. I am meaning I am before Abraham. I am during Abraham. I am after Abraham. I am even right now. I am even after now. I am even now. And his name is Jesus. Who was it? It was God in flesh. He was 100% God. He was born the Christ. He is the resurrection and the life. He is alpha and omega. Alpha and omega. He's the creator of all things. The world was made by him. Amen. He lost from the dead. Who was it? 100% God without controvers without doubt. God was made. Who was Jesus? Jesus was God. Can you say Jesus is God? 100% sure. But what confuses them is the same God who who was in him. The one we called Jesus. 100% God. He was also 100% man. Are you confused? He had flesh and blood. That was not God. That was not God. He cried. That was not God. God crying. That was not God. He was tempted. The Bible says with all manner of temptations even as we are tempted. Brother Bam said even in sexual temptation he was tempted in it. Was that God? That was a man [Music] like he died. God doesn't die. That was man. Not maybe man. God man. That was 100% man. He slept because he was tired. And when he slept, he would go into deep sleep. Then the sheep was going to run. That was mansing away. That was man. That was man like you. Like you like me. No difference. That's why we call him our brother. He was man. But you see when he woke up and he saw the storm, he said, "Peace, be still." That was not man. That was God, the creator of heaven and earth. When he wept, that was man. But after he wait then he said now man wait a moment flesh wait a moment we'll come back to that and then he began calling remove the stone roll it away and then he began shouting us forth that was God not man% God hallelujah so you see who was Jesus [Applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Why am I preaching this? Because Jesus Christ is the same. Yesterday, today even somebody get the same. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Who are you? Why me? 100% man. I am what is in there 100% God himself might of flesh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. In a in a message testimony of a true witness, Judy says, "Oh God, what is it? The Holy Ghost, the true witness of God. The Holy Ghost, the true witness of God. What is it? That's what the Holy Spirit is. And the Holy Spirit says, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why when when you have issues, don't always think you are a man. When situations become tough, remember who you are. Hallelujah. Adoption is meant to put you in your right place. As a son of God, as a daughter of God, Jesus was a son of God. And that means he was God. Amen. When you realize you're a son of God, problems come sometimes. Remember who you are. Remember, [Applause] brother speak to the storm. Hallelujah. Amen. The power is within. The rapture is not coming. Hallelujah. Where? Why in you? What's the Holy Ghost? [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Is everything is in knowing who you are. Amen. Amen. That's why the prophet says, "We know who she is. Once she stands, she will be an invisible." Amen. Amen. Amen. Why are we defeated? Why do we get anxiety? Why do we get depression? Why do we have problems? And we we cry and cry and cry because we are 100% man. But we forget who we are. Yes, we are man and we truly are God. Hallelujah. Let me tell you, the children of God are different from the children of the world. Hallelujah. When you have problems, don't cry as if you have no hope. God told Moses, I'll make you a god. I'll make you go. Not a second go of the third of the You will be God. And when Moses went among them, problems come. We need to change the way we pray. Amen. Amen. Let the religious denomination of people pray without revelation. Let them pray like that. Let me tell you, we should pray but not pray like them. Jesus said you don't receive because you pray amidst you should know who you are. Pray with revelation. And if you want to know how, go and see how David used to pray. He prayed with revelation. Amen. And now we see right there. God told Moses, "Moses, what is wrong with you?" Those are my words. I say, "Why [Music] cryposes?" I had to remember who he was. Hey, by the way, I can just talk and see pattern. Hallelujah. [Applause] Moses each time cried back to God. Even when God even when Moses went back to cry to God about how the children of Israel were complaining, they didn't have meat. They had only manner, God told him, Moses after the the words they had exchanged go back and strike with your rod, strike the rock and the water will come out. What happened? Was there anything new? The rod was with Moses. The word was with Moses. The hand was the hand of Moses. Everything you need is right in you. Amen. Yes, sir. You have to know who you are. The work of the ministry is to bring you to the realization of who you are. This by the way is the real message of the hour. Everything else is details. The message of the hour is you knowing who you are. Amen. There are some demons which used to defeat me and I would cry to God every time I come. I cry if you just come and take it away. How many feel like that? You feel like [Music] maybe but today I don't even remember when those demons now last overcame. Why? I realized who I am. I am a son of God. I realized I had authority. When you are a son, God is no longer here. God him spoke because the father is in the son and the son is adopted to speak your words. Amen. And it will be by revelation. It will not be by idol talk. It's not like the way the do it by revelation. You receive a revelation of who you are. You begin sometimes to speak things into amen. Oh glory. What church? That's the reason I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying, shaking or speaking in tongues. or any sensation they are all right. Now some people read such quotes and they begin hitting on emotions. Brother Bham never hit on emotions. Emotions is part of the true Christian faith. But that's not it. There is more. He says that's all right. The things are all right. But the devil can impersonate that. So real. What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is not crying. The Holy Ghost is not crying. The Holy Ghost is not feeling. He is not speaking inside. He's not shouting. There is something else. We need to understand the Holy Ghost. And he continues on to say God in man. It is more than a sens. It is more than shouting. It is more than weeping. It is more than joining church. God himself living in man himself when we can speak and it's just the same as [Music] God. Hallelujah. That's the church. The way the first apostolic church went for God himself where you can speak and it is God speaking. Amen. I know there are some brothers who say that's the third pool which I also believe is but the problem they say it will come in the future. Well, let me tell you something. There is nothing new coming. All things are finished. Hallelujah. The mystery of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. The mystery of God. Everybody answer me will [Music] be there's no more revelation. There's no more new thinker. It is all here. Hallelujah. And would speak life into the little form would speak, you know, squeeth. Can that happen now? Is it possible or is it in the future? Jesus. Yes. The today what he did yesterday will do the same. If it was God in Jesus, it is God and you look the same God, the same power. Hallelujah. He is 100% man. 100% God. 100% man% man. God raising the dead. 100% man sleeping. 100% God. Call me in the seas. If you want to see the man in me, I am right here. But I tell you, there is something else. What you're hearing talking about me is God. And there's a God part in you, sister in you. And you live on it, another part in you. Amen. Hallelujah. Without what I'm preaching to you, is the message of the hour, not my interpretation. Okay. As I'm approaching to finish, let me read you some more. testimony of a true witness. We need a we need a day of weeping and mourning waiting until God sends the Holy Ghost. His witness, not an empty shell, not an empty denomination. You see, we say we have the Holy Ghost, have the Holy Ghost, but we have so many troubles. and so many problems. We need a sh of the real Holy Ghost and Bible says we need a week. We need a morning until God sends that Holy Ghost. And he says, "What is it?" Not, not an empty shell, not an empty denomination, but Amen. Jesus said in Mark 16 that the Holy Ghost when he come he will testify in every succeeding generation. Amen. Every generation brother even our generation. Hallelujah. To the end signs the these signs follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out. How long is this witness going to be to the end of the world? How long? Every generation in my name, they shall speak with if they take up drink, it wouldn't harm them. If they lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.

All of a sudden I failed. There was coming something down over the top of them woods. The Holy Spirit moved down and said, "Stand up." And said, "Speak to that little fish. It is not a man presuming the Holy Spirit being a witness in you." And he said, "Speak to that fish. and it shall have life again. It had been laying there dead half an hour. It was floating in the winds and by the bottom said I said little fishy. He did not pray. is saying little fish I give you your life in the name of the Lord Jesus that little fish that little fish you want to hear this turned over flipped up and went out right through the water just as hard as he could go. I stood there not knowing what to do. When you are adopted son of God, your words have authority. Your words give life. Amen. You have joy in you.
