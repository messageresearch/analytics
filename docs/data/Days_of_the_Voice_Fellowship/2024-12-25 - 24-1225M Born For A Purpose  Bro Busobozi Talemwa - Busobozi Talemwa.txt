hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord amen thank you musicians shall we go to the Book of John chapter 18 not a normal Christmas text but it will get us there by God's grace John chapter 18 verses we are beginning from verses 33 ver 37 then pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell tell it thee of me pilate answered am I a Jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence pilot therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth even one that is of the truth here with my voice amen may the Lord add blessings upon the word you may have your uh welcome back sister Stella I've not seen brother polyup I don't know whether he's chch right over here welcome back from Kenya I understand Sister Mary and sister gud they went to represent us in the convention of nakuru uh he was informed that they went to be there amen and uh so uh this is the first time we are doing something like this and I'm happy to see at least a good number coming to you did well tell your neighbor you did well oh this is Brother Ro God bless you uh this brother is a is a young a young Minister um who has a burden for this message and um I never knew him but sometime back we had a moment an opportunity to meet and he came and visited me we spoke a lot uh the Lord laid it on his heart you know to go all the way to uh a village called I don't know how many of you've heard say that God led me to go from the city and go to the Village to preach uh so you can tell that it's a real burden this time when we were visiting West n we got an opportunity to visit there is home with his wife as well as see the place where he's starting the ministry so I'm happy to see you here God bless you very much amen is the Lord good to you has he been good to you he took you from the past Christmas and brought you to this Christmas that's one full year is the grace of God love of God and you must have a smile on your face amen I want to see Smiles everywhere we have come here because of Jesus we do not um uh celebrate Christmas the way the world does because uh the way they do it as tradition has it they usually have things like um Santa Santa Claus and and you know that children kind of love that and um you know he wears that red and white and he brings gifts I did not say green where did you get green from get connected okay so um and and so he that man big fat man in that kind of thing brings gifts to [Music] children and he hands the and oh say father Christmas has given us a gift and then you wonder who is this man who is this guy because me I grew up thinking who is this guy they're talking about the birth of Jesus and I'm seeing a man that I don't even see in the Bible but when I came into the message our Prophet told us those are the lies of denominations we believe in nothing like Father Christmas and you a Believer should never even post those things on your walls on your status you find Believers posting Father Christmas that's that's the devil okay pastor what did you just say the devil Santa take it the other way around Satan sat it has nothing to do with Jesus nothing to do J well if we should celebrate Christmas we should have a stable we should tell our children the story of the birth of Jesus you know we should we should be happy in our homes and have a good meal and teach our children about the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ because I mean they grow up seeing you celebrating their birthdays and you're telling them God was born in flesh and they have never seen you talking about that he was born so such a day is good for you to now explain the whole thing properly and tell them how he was born where he was born the scenarios in which he was born and everything about Christmas so today I'm not really going to speak on the subject of Christmas as in the way I did it I think about two years ago I preached on a subject called Christ in Christmas and I was trying to lay the foundations what we believe and what we don't believe so I may not go into that kind of thing today but maybe for a few remarks before we go into the scriptures today there are some believers who don't even believe in attending church like this because that the people will say that they they also celebrating Christmas there is nothing wrong with that we are here to celebrate Jesus Christ not a day we are not sth Day Adventist our Christmas our Sabbath rest is not a day it is a man Christ Jesus it is the word which was bed into our hearts 25th December is not and cannot be the day when Jesus Christ was born you know at the time when he was born there was you remember there were shepherds there were shepherds at that time and they were you know in they were in you know uh feeding their their lambs um and then the Angels Came and brought the news of the birth of Jesus now you can imagine you know during the time of snow the Shepherds were never out feeding chep or LS no they were you know always under you know in a place where it is warm so this is one of the indications to show us that he could not have been born on 25th December because that is winter so the it was just coined by the Roman Catholic church but that does not mean that we as believers do not believe that Jesus was born we don't care when he was born we only care about when he was born in our life in the form of the holy spirit so we celebrate every day the birth of Jesus Amen and not being that today the whole world decided to celebrate it all right it is okay let us also celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ in our hearts as we have always done and um it's okay to eat good meals it is all right and to you who is saying pastor no that's not right tell me where is it in the message you know sometimes we take Traditions not scripture not message but we should take the message not tradition amen am I talking to someone here um and and then also gifts you know when Jesus was born gifts and today I'll talk a little bit about gifts gifts were given so it's okay to give gifts bam was always giving gifts on Christmas by people who loved him I'm so thankful there are people who love me and they brought me some gifts I will not mention but they know themselves I want to say thank you so much those who brought those Christmas gifts to me I really very much appreciated and those who have not brought you can bring as well and it's okay to give each other gifts each other at Christmas gifts show someone love don't be very religious show someone love praise the name of the Lord amen so but this morning I want to speak on a title that I've titled born for a purpose born for a purpose uh we will go back in our scripture in the Book of John 18 then pilate ENT entered into the Judgment the Judgment Hall again now remember this is the time they trying to try Jesus and pilate you know they brought him before Pilate and pilate asked Jesus are you the king of the Jews so Jesus answered him do you say this of yourself or did others tell you about like this so pilate answered am I a Jew your own nation and the chief priest have delivered you to me tell me what have you done Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world praise the name of the Lord if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from heav how many know the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus I believe our kingdom is not of this world so we like Jesus our kingdom is not of this world Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world so pil there said unto him are you a king then this is the second time he's asking Jesus answered thou sayest I am a king so in other words Jesus did not say I am not a king but he said you have said I am a so to this end was I born and for this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth praise the name of the Lord there are two things there that you need to look at number one he says I was born for this cause number two he says for this cause I came into the world did you just get the understanding of that he talking about two things he was born and then he came into the world those are two different things Jesus coming into the world means he came from somewhere meaning he he was before he came he is more than what we see he is more than what the religions and the denominations are celebrating [Music] today he is more than a baby in a Manger he is God in flesh he created the heavens and the Earth but here he has come down into the Earth I want you to see in the message God's Gift always find their places he says when you realize what are we doing here where did we come from these are very important questions or what business we we get we get we got being here we wasn't put here just by chance we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose but still we are back on the basis of free moral ageny where we can serve it or reject it just like Adam did in the beginning I I want each of you to ask yourselves this question what what are we doing here where did we come from where did you come from did you come from some of you would say I came from my father I came from my grandfather where did we come from where did I come from where did you come from it's a question that you must ask yourself there are some people who don't believe believe in God they believe they just happened and they believe they're just going to disappear Into Thin Air so because of that they don't care how they live they don't care how they take their vessel their body they they go into immorality they smoke they drink they don't really care they will even tell you don't take life seriously you living so seriously and you know when they find Believers the way we live I don't dress that way I don't dress that I don't eat that I don't talk speak that way they will be surprised they will be shocked when they see how our sisters dress when they see how we behave around our sisters when they see how we talk when they see how we don't talk they are shocked because they can't understand how we reason because for them they think they're just like a tree that just grew and dies and goes into nothing they think they're just like a god which is just you know raised and maybe is eaten and it disappears they think they're just like uh you know any other creature but I will have you to know this morning we are more than any other creature we are the super R when God created all the other creatures at the end of it he said now let us create man in our own image so you see God was lonely God needed someone like him all the other creatures he created but he needed another creature my which was more than a creature he needed someone like him someone he could fellowship with someone he could understand and someone who could understand him and the only thing that would would be like that is something like God something that is equal to God praise the name of the Lord and so he said I will create man in my image so man is a super he was created to do what to have dominion to over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air over the beasts of the field we are above any animal we are above any bir we are above any fish we are created for a purpose Adam came into this world oh my God now listen Adam was not just born Adam came into the world I was not just born I came into this world she hallelujah hallelujah she's not my mother because I came into the world did you ever see no no no did you ever see Jesus saying Mary was was his mother did you ever see that not one time in this whole Bible did Mary call Jesus mother Jesus call Mary mother never happened why why because Jesus understood that where he came he he knew who he was he knew what he was doing here he knew where he came from and he knew what business got him into [Music] the but the problem why we can't overcome oh hallelujah hallelujah why we can't overcome the world is because we always think we are born by our mothers but the Bible says man born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble few days and full of trouble man born of a woman how many year born of a woman how many year born of a woman where you can refuse but that's the truth you are born by a woman I was born by a woman too you to was born by a woman no matter how strong or how big or how intelligent you are you are born by a woman because of that you are full of trouble and you are over a few days you grow old and you die you get sick you know teeth will begin to come out some of you are losing a lot of Truth and others are having pain right now for something why because you are disintegrated you are born of a woman you are full of trouble you are like a a flower or like a um like a tree or something or a flower the B calls it a flower it just dries up you know that's how we are all of us but I want you to know there is some other man in me that is not born of a woman now when a child of God understands that then a child of God will begin overcoming when a child of God understand I didn't I was not born of a woman I came into this world and I came into this world for a purpose you know when job was suffering and he had a very terrible time in his life you know God came down and ask him a question where are you where were you when I created the heavens and earth where were you when the sons of God sh for Joy where were you answer the question where were you and the answer is simple I was in God before the foundation of the world I am not just you know appearing here for the first time I have I have existed before not not as in preexistence but I have been in his mind I have come here for a certain business so what are we doing here where did we come from what business did we come here to do and says we was not put here by chance we were put here for a purpose Amen Let Me Tell You Brethren the day I started overcoming is when I found out my life's purpose the reason why many people are destroyed why many people suffer why they fail to live a Christian Life it's because they have never found out the purpose why they born I was not born to eat and die I was not born to dress I was not born to have children I was not born for all those things was born for more than those I was not born just to marry it is a spiritual purpose I am here I was born for a purpose Jesus was born for a purpose there are many things he did but there was this one purpose why he was born let me tell you when you find out the purpose why you were born you begin overcoming you begin overcoming you begin over coming and there there comes a time when you die now when you die your work is done then you have to report on how you live that is a a real truth all of us each of us will give an account on how you lived your life did you leave for the purpose have to do anything on it yes because the prophet here says You must serve that purpose but then he says but still we are on the basis of free moral agen where we can serve it or reject it praise the Lord Paul one time he found out at first he thought he was born to persecute the the Christians but one day he met the pill of fire and when he met that pill of Fire from that day he realized he was born for a greater purpose and everything changed all his affiliations changed all his friends changed all his associations and then he started leing for that purpose one time he said to me if I preach not the gospel why he had found his life's purpose he had found his life's purpose and he knew if he doesn't do it him there are people who are born just to be um to help people in the world you find that someone is born just to be a philanthropist the Bible calls it the gift of helps and that that is just that person need purpose they don't know how to preach they don't know how to sing they don't know how to you know you know do anything else for them wherever they look wherever they are found they have that thing of wanting to make someone's life better do you know people will receive eternal life just that basis and they don't even know they are not doing those things so they can get eternal life but they will just get it and then they will wonder when were you in the hospital and we visited you when were you sick and we visited you when were you hungry and we fed you when were you naked and and and we dress and he said when you did it to the little ones you did it unto me so they were shock they did not even know that they served God but by living their life's purpose they receive eternal life I want you to think wider today each of us here today to you also were on each of you we have a purpose you have a purpose while you were born and until you find that purpose you are just wasting time you can all go to school we can all go to the same school we can all graduate we can all get Bachelors Master but each of us has to find our life's purpose are you hearing me others are born just to uh to sing that's their life's purpose well they can go start PhD but finally they end up just touching the World by their sing writing songs writing poems and singing some of them just that that is their life's purpose God put them into this world to do that and the problem of mankind is finding purpose and staying in it that is the problem of mankind when they find their they they can't they don't want to stay in their life if if people found their life's purpose you would not have um um jealousy you know where you find that someone is doing something and then you are so jealous feel like it should be me and they clap for someone they should be people if they find their life's purpose won't mind about who does you are relaxed you know you know there is no one in this world like you there's only you who can do what you do there only you who can touch people the way you touch God blessed in you to do how am I communicating this morning what is your life's purpose is it just to go to school there is more than that it's okay to go to school you cannot tell me me just my life's purpose is to get married you are looking at life in a very narrow [Music] way you were pleased in this world to touch people's lives to change the world I am here to change the world I don't care how many are there changing the world they cannot change it like I do you understand there's only one me in the world there are many people called Jesus even in the days of Jesus there was a man called Jesus read your Bible but he could not be Jesus of Nazareth Hallelujah there is only one Jesus who was born for a purpose dying and redeeming mankind he was only him that's why we are the only Jesus only Jesus could die on the and save the world there are others who died on the cross but only Jesus die on the cross change the world only Jesus was born a virgin only Jesus was born for that purpose I don't care how many do what I'm doing don't care how many do what you're doing don't be anxious for anything God has brought you into this world to live a life of purpose to change the world around you to bring a Revival into the world Amen and to bring the name of the Lord to be glorified praise the name of the Lord if it is dying on the cross there are many who have died before even Jesus was born you know even the time when he was dying are those who died with him on the cross at the same place so when you're talking about go calary there was great and at Cal on that same day at Calvary there was the blood of Jesus and the blood of these other thieves so which blood are you talking about the the thing is not about Calvary when we talk about Calvary we are talking about the man Jesus amen and that's why it's not the Lal physical blood might even have powered down and mixed up we are talking about the blood that you receive by Faith by faith in him by faith in his word that's why Jesus here said this is the reason why I came into this world I was born into this world I came that I should bear witness unto the truth he was a faithful witness and he says everyone that believes or lies the truth will hear my voice and we hear his voice and we believe his voice why because we also are born for our purpose he came into the world you know in the Book of John he says that he came into the world and his own received him praise the name of the Lord so before you leave church this morning I want you to just have that answer why were you born what are you doing here where did you come from what business did you come here to do Believers are alens we came from another place and we came here for a mission some of you don't know your mission what is your mission you find someone he wants to sing he wants to preach he wants to play he wants to Brethren if we can understand each of us we are born for a purpose and if each of us find our purpose and we zero on it zero on it the world can change the world can change you know I've been seeing some of our brother Brothers in um in the in the Western World you find a brother or a sister finding out when they young in their teens finding out that they were born to be a Pianist that person will begin playing the piano that person will be faithful to that c from that infant age growing up getting married they will still remain faithful you know growing up they have children they will still remain faithful they will have grandchild they will remain faithful at the post of Duty never leaving unless they really dying in the hospital they always be at the piano growing old B the duty and they only are stopped because of death why they find found out their life's purpose they found out their life's purpose our purpose is just not to make money go to school make money children do this we are doing all these things because we are born of a woman one thing we do because we are born of God hallelujah hallelujah we do all these things because we are born of a woman and they all full of trouble but we do one thing when we realize we are born of God and that one thing is the purpose for which we came into this and if you've not found out yet you will never overcome the world because the Bible says that they that are born of God overcome the world not they that are born of a woman but they that are born of God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah not all of us are born to be millionaires I believe we are all born not to be poor right but not all of us will be millionaires yes not all of us will be millionaires but there are those who are born to be millionair that God knew before the foundation of the heed in this one to make a lot of Millions for what purpose so you can live a life of [Music] service there are some of you that even if you got $10,000 we will not see you at church again that's how we know you you're not called for that some of you can't handle you know some small money but these people who are born to be that one it's not money they value it is the purpose for which they born they are given to the distribution of the Saints I hope that this little thought can you know come into your heart and burden you to find out why are you born why do we have people fighting people families fighting siblings fighting jealous why do we have witchcraft is because people don't know why they are born someone sees another one driving and they feel so bad in [Music] their it should be me I'll be them and you find someone who was prospering everything goes down and then they begin suffering smiling I'm so thankful that Believers we cannot be Bewitched we cannot be Beed but if you go and live the wrong kind of life this statement doesn't apply to you if you go live the wrong kind of life you go in the devil's territory witcraft will catch you as sure as there is a God in heaven until you repent but a Believer who knows their position in Christ who is living right witchcraft has no power over them hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord and so you find you know all those things happening in the people's hearts that's why by the way when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the knowledge you receive the understanding why you came into the world and so you will love everybody do you know that someone who has the Holy Ghost will always love everybody you know if you have the Holy Ghost you can never Hur someone by the way did you know that when you receive the Holy Spirit you will love everyone even those who don't love you so if you wanted to know whether you have the Holy Ghost or not take your heart what is the status of your heart you should love every you should have no enemies yes sir your enemies you should leave it to God God should work on them but you should love everyone it makes me love everybody makes everybody makes me love everybody is good enough for me give me that old time ReliOn it's that old time Holy Spirit devil w't go near that's the reason people fear but it's good enough for me so do you have enemies receive the Holy Ghost one time you will feel so much love in your heart amen from the day I receive the B of the Holy Ghost I don't have enemies and I want to declare to you this morning in this whole world I have no enemy no one enemy not even half an enemy are there people who have hurt me are there people who have haunted me are there people who have done things to me yes are there people that have wronged yes because I'm human being but in my heart I have no grud in my heart I have no enemy why because since Jesus came into my heart he changed everything about me he changed my heart and he gave me love and and I have a reason to leave the reason why I leave I found it out I found my life's purpose the purpose why I live is so that I can serve him so that I can preach the gospel and I don't care who loves me or who Me by what I preach because this is the reason why I live I preach it in my home I preach it in other countries whever God sends me I don't preach it for money I don't PR it for you know a name I do what I do because I found out this is the reason why I live I was even in school I decided to drop out my mother told me what is wrong with you are you losing your mind all your siblings have gone to school what are you trying to do go back to school these ideas of marriage and she was being a good mother but I told her mom I'm crazy about this I have made up my mind I'm dropping out and I'm going to get married and I'm going to live my life's purose you know what God never disappoints and I'm saying God never disappoints and I'm not saying drop out of school that's how God dealt with me well even if I dropped out I still continued I finished I'm a graduate so I am not uneducated why

always give it to you Hallelujah am and he saying seek theom of God and all this righteous and everything else all these things shall be added unto you amen but the problem people want to seek all the

purpose and Jesus was born for a purpose he found out his purpose when he was so young you know before he was even born his purpose was declared first by prophets Isaiah 96 just to give you a few examples to us a child is born and to us a son is given and a government shall be upon his should and his name Shall be Called wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace now many debated on this scripture even when Jesus was being born they still debated on it it was a hard scripture during the time but everyone had their own opinion but God does not give an opinion his word is that say the Lord it must happen whatever his word has prophesied about me it must happen if he says I'm a man of Val I used to read those scriptures and I look at myself having no much education having no money no big backround and I was wondering how are these things listen let me tell you brother When God says something about you in his word better believe it because his word cannot fail his word has never failed shall always be accomplished how does God fulfill how does God you know explain his word by making it come to pass I am fearfully and wonderfully man it must happen if you doubt it just watch the space God will show by making it come to pass how fearfully and wonderfully made I am are you hearing me I'll be head and not a tail you believe that your heads are not t by that's a prophecy for you also from the word pastor preached for us here scriptural Authority that is scriptural Authority for us so by scriptural Authority I tell you today you shall be heads and now if you believe it it shall be if someone doubts it tell them wash the space something is working something Isen soon and very soon God is going to lift me from glory to glory to whatever you desire according his word it must be and he will fulfill it that's how godes by fulfilling his word so the child was born anyhow but they were debating but the child was already born even when he

the Jews King they knew he was a king they knew he was a king for we have seen his St in the East and I come to worship Him Hallelujah we don't do a lot of drives No we don't do a lot of advertisement but why are there message churches all over the world answer that question answer that question why do we have message churches even where we have in scenarios where pastors who have been preaching it leave it but this church is Contin why oh someone should understand there is a mystery here when a star appears the work is already done you can't change nothing you can't change nothing people will

who have claimed they have stars but when you checked it it was a foral light we have a true star in our generation a star has appeared to us Seven Stars in the right hand which are the Angels to the seven churches an angel means messenger a star is a messenger when a church Edge receives a star there is no way you can take away now in our age we have received William Mar BR Bram to you who

Believers Hallelujah Hallelujah why because the star has dis appeared and the Stars has declared it praise the name of the Lord praise God and Jesus as a boy now I want to try and begin descending descending here now when Jesus was a boy he knew why he was called in Luke 2 uh vers 41 now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover and when when he was 12 years they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days they returned they returned as they returned the Child Jesus T behind in and Joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company they went a day journey and they sought him among their skin fs and acquaint and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after 3 days they found him in the temple sitting in the mid of the doctor both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were at his understanding and answers what manner of man is this that counts the Raging SE that says your sins be forgiven oh my and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sold thee Sor your father and Jesus was looking at you what did you say can you say that again your father and me mother we have been looking sor Jesus looked at and he said unto them how is it that he s me don't you know that he must be about my father's business I love the way Jesus was answering didn't want to offend anyone but he said a bitter truth in other words what did you say your who father the work of Joseph was carp work but the work of the temple is the work of God so whose son was Jesus hallelujah amen Jesus was a Son of God he was not born of Mary he was not born of Joseph he was born of God and because of that he knew his purpose in at 12 years how old are you why are you born you don't know why you born shame on Jesus 12 no one told him they are very busy calling telling him that father he already knew his father was he already had an experience he knew God was his father at this age he already knew the purpose for which he was born he already was ready to execute that purpose so I ask you again why are you born to work for that company is that the reason to raise your children that is that all come

walked it was God walking the Jehovah of the is the Jesus of the Jehovah means our salvation do mean God our Salvation am I preaching to someone Jesus is the god that created heaven and earth there is no other God he was in that Temple God is a spirit remember he was in that Temple hallelujah hallelujah and he's still birthing more more temp the devil was confused the first time I'm sure even now he is more confused because we have more temples where God is dwelling in him the fullness in each of us a portion all of us together the fullness of God hallelujah hallelujah not D Fellowship only the entire body of Christ all over the world it is God in flesh I love this don't you I said Merry Christmas now we can talk about it because the king is B God himself in flame they brought gold to show he is more than a man he's more than a prophet he is God in flesh let me give you a little more on gold when Jesus asked his disciples who men say that I am they said you are Jeremiah one of the prophets prophets son of man who do they say I the son of man son of man meaning Prophet they said you are just like one did you get it but then Peter when Jesus asked but what about you what do you say Peter he was still going to talk something struck him and received the Revelation and he said you are Jesus the son of God not the son of man the Son of God did you get it the difference between son of man and Son of God son of man is a prophet Son of God is God hallelujah when Jesus heard that he said Peter Flesh and Blood revealed to you upon this Ro upon this revelation of who I am I will build my child the Church of Jesus The Message Church is buil upon the Revelation that Jesus is God hallelujah oh we should shout more [Music] because oh yes sir and the second gift was frankincense

die that we might have life and have it more abundantly and anyone knows that my is very costly the message The Shining Light but a bit ma what represent his great Supreme sacrifice he's crushed out Young Life at Calvary where the sins of the world ground and because of his sacrifice for Sinners that he died there he was wounded for our transgression for our ini thetis of our peace and with his stripes we were healed that's why they offered him M and that's how Christ was identified by gold man and frankincense and by them men foreshadowing and showing in typ that life was to be listen deity man for service to die that he might redeem the nation because he was to save his people from amen D manifested for service that he might die and redeem hallelujah hallelujah praise the name name of the Lord friends sometimes when you go into the scriptures and read about Jesus it hits you hard to know what he became for what we should become and I want to if you can turn with me to the Book of Mark 15 and the chief Priestess of all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death and for none for many bear false witness against him but their witness agreed not together and there arose sat and bear false witness against him we heard him you all heard what Jesus said but I want you to see what this man says we heard him say I will destroy this Temple that is made with hands and within three days I will build another one made without hands is that what Jesus said this man changed the words because he he lacked understanding but neither so did there Witnesses agree together and the high priest stood in the mid and he asked Jesus saying you answer nothing what is it with these Witnesses against you but he held his p and answered nothing Frankin again the high priest asked him said to him thou the Christ the son of the blessed and Jesus said I [Music] am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of God and coming in the Clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes and said what need we any F Witnesses [Music] you have had the blasphemy what think and they all condemned him to be guilty and some began to spit on him to cover his face Buffet him and to sayto him prophesy listen Church the prophets had prophesied I'm finishing right here the prophets had prophesied the Angels had prophesy the stars that prophesy the gifts had prophesy the whole nature prophesy what did they want him to prophesy he did not need to it was done he was born to die that you might have life when you find your purpose you won't care what the
