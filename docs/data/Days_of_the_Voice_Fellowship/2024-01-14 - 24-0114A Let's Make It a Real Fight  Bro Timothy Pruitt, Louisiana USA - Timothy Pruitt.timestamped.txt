[59:23] bluff
[59:36] when men and women quit looking at the
[59:38] sickness and the
[59:43] disease and they start looking at what
[59:45] God said

[59:49] over all things how many can say all all
[59:54] things
[59:55] are subject to Jesus

[1:00:40] letters a l l
[1:00:48] All That's how little your the enemy
[1:00:51] that is against you

[1:02:11] like very much brother
[1:02:14] Timothy are you part of the body of
[1:02:18] Christ how many is part of the body of
[1:02:21] Christ well in Revelations 10
[1:02:24] I saw a mighty Angel come down and he
[1:02:28] put one foot upon the land and one foot
[1:02:30] upon the sea he was showing he had
[1:02:34] dominion over it
[1:02:39] all amen so I don't care what part of
[1:02:42] the body you
[1:02:44] are if you're the skin on the bottom of
[1:02:47] the
[1:02:50] foot the lowest of the lowest of the
[1:02:53] lowest
[1:02:55] but when that foot goes
[1:02:57] down every devil is under
[1:03:04] you I'm the weakest of Christians every
[1:03:08] devil is under
[1:03:16] you let me just say this real
[1:03:19] quick all the part of the
[1:03:22] body is important
[1:03:26] the Unseen and the
[1:03:28] seen actually the Unseen is more
[1:03:30] important many times the
[1:03:33] seen you can cut a finger off and
[1:03:39] live and still
[1:03:41] live you can lose your arm and still
[1:03:45] live what happens if something on the
[1:03:48] inside like your heart or your liver or
[1:03:50] something of vital
[1:03:53] importance
[1:03:55] then the whole body
[1:03:56] dies he said we are one body jointly fit
[1:04:01] together we are all
[1:04:05] important amen not I'm not just so I'm
[1:04:08] not important because I come from a
[1:04:10] different
[1:04:11] country that has nothing to do with it
[1:04:14] I'm part of a body that body is Jesus
[1:04:18] Christ and we are everyone
[1:04:23] important
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] hallelujah one day there was a bunch of
[1:04:33] Israelites gathered on a
[1:04:35] Hillside and there was this big old
[1:04:37] giant his name was
[1:04:41] Goliath you know when when you say the
[1:04:44] devil's like
[1:04:45] this when he gets a edge on you that's
[1:04:48] when he thinks he has
[1:04:51] you he walked out about 10 foot tall
[1:04:57] tall big armor and
[1:05:02] spear said I'll tell you what what I'll
[1:05:06] do I'll make an agreement with you send
[1:05:09] me a man to fight me and if he if he if
[1:05:13] I win then you serve
[1:05:16] us if your man wins then we'll serve
[1:05:20] you lying
[1:05:22] devil ly
[1:05:27] devil listen the devil never keeps one
[1:05:30] of his
[1:05:36] deals he said well I don't know if I can
[1:05:38] be a
[1:05:39] Christian I don't know if I can be a
[1:05:42] Christian because I hear Christians have
[1:05:44] to give
[1:05:47] 10% to the work of God so I don't know
[1:05:49] if I can afford
[1:05:52] that well let me tell you the devil
[1:05:55] takes more than
[1:06:03] 10% oh yeah I know I used to serve him
[1:06:08] too I know he takes a
[1:06:12] lot I wasn't always a
[1:06:15] Christian I didn't always serve the
[1:06:17] Lord but thank God it changed my
[1:06:21] life but I found out
[1:06:24] God gives more than he
[1:06:29] takes Hallelujah he'll give you back
[1:06:32] more than you can ever give to
[1:06:35] [Music]
[1:06:36] him amen yes
[1:06:41] Hallelujah that went pretty good for
[1:06:43] about 40 days Giant Goliath
[1:06:49] message but one
[1:06:51] day brother brandham said
[1:06:54] there was a different set of ears in the
[1:07:01] camp hallelujah hallelujah he went good
[1:07:04] for 40
[1:07:05] days when he he can make his
[1:07:08] challeng he could go in back
[1:07:11] in and then Philistine women would give
[1:07:14] a
[1:07:15] massage calm his hair and feed him
[1:07:18] grapes and he could lean back and he
[1:07:20] could say I'm the
[1:07:22] man
[1:07:25] but on this day there was a different
[1:07:28] set of ears in the
[1:07:33] camp and Goliath got up that
[1:07:37] morning he didn't know it but it was his
[1:07:40] last
[1:07:41] morning he ate his
[1:07:45] breakfast probably had about 12
[1:07:48] pancakes three dozen of
[1:07:50] eggs five cups of coffee it was his last
[1:07:59] breakfast he put on his
[1:08:01] armor it was his last time to put his
[1:08:04] armor
[1:08:06] on he walked out of his
[1:08:09] tent and he made his boast it was the
[1:08:13] last time he was going to make that
[1:08:15] boast cuz there was a little David in
[1:08:18] the
[1:08:19] camp Hallelujah and David heard him he
[1:08:23] said who is this uncircumcised
[1:08:26] phis how dare he how dare he challenge
[1:08:30] the army of the Living
[1:08:32] God I'll fight
[1:08:37] him David wasn't a
[1:08:40] fighter he was a
[1:08:42] Shepherd sure he had a sling that would
[1:08:45] kill a
[1:08:47] lion he he he could kill a
[1:08:50] bear but you know the real secret behind
[1:08:53] David's
[1:08:55] courage he had the anointing all poured
[1:08:57] on
[1:09:00] him Hallelujah he knew he was next and

[1:10:03] you David said this don't fit
[1:10:07] me It Don't Fit who I
[1:10:11] am and he began to testify what God had
[1:10:14] done for
[1:10:15] him how he killed the lion how he killed
[1:10:18] the bear and he said that giant will be
[1:10:22] just as them
[1:10:28] Hallelujah and he started walking down
[1:10:30] into the valley I've been in this Valley
[1:10:34] there in Israel I've been in the valley

[1:21:35] particles coming
[1:21:41] together and Satan started try to punch
[1:21:44] at
[1:21:46] me and he tried to not only tell me that
[1:21:49] creation wasn't
[1:21:51] real but the Bible wasn't
[1:21:54] real and that Jesus wasn't
[1:21:58] real you know he was just a man that
[1:22:00] lived like Billy Graham or all
[1:22:05] Roberts yeah he was a great
[1:22:08] man but then after a while he BEC so
[1:22:10] great that he became a God to
[1:22:14] the and it scattered all over the world
[1:22:17] since he's dead and that's all there is
[1:22:19] to
[1:22:21] it
[1:22:24] that's Satan speaking to the prophet's
[1:22:27] mind and he said I thought
[1:22:31] this
[1:22:32] Satan how a liar you
[1:22:37] are you've been talking to my
[1:22:40] conscience he said but I want to ask you
[1:22:43] a few things who was it the Hebrew
[1:22:46] Prophet spoke
[1:22:48] about that would be the anointed Messiah
[1:22:51] that would come 2000 years
[1:22:54] ago and it was foretold by the
[1:22:58] letter that he would come and he would
[1:23:02] live and he would die and he did that
[1:23:06] just exactly as it was
[1:23:08] said it was written in the
[1:23:11] word and every word is
[1:23:14] true then he
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:21] left
[1:23:23] you want the devil to
[1:23:25] leave take him back to the
[1:23:28] word it is
[1:23:30] written
[1:23:47] is Proverbs 18:21
[1:23:51] says
[1:23:53] let me say this first a thought is just
[1:23:57] a thought unless you have let it become
[1:24:01] words and then those words become
[1:24:06] power amen as long as there's a thought
[1:24:09] you just cast it
[1:24:11] down but when you begin to speak it that
[1:24:14] means you begin to believe what you're
[1:24:17] thinking Proverbs
[1:24:20] 18:21 it says death and
[1:24:23] life are in the power of the
[1:24:28] tongue amen how many's
[1:24:37] got death and life are in the power of
[1:24:40] the
[1:24:43] tongue and they that love it shall eat
[1:24:46] the fruit
[1:24:50] thereof Matthew 12:3 7
[1:24:53] says by thy words thou are
[1:24:58] Justified and by thy words Thou Art
[1:25:07] condemned lot of power in what we
[1:25:12] say Amen Hebrews 4:14
[1:25:16] says seeing then we have a great high
[1:25:20] priest that's passed into the the
[1:25:23] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[1:25:26] fast our
[1:25:29] profession Hebrews 10:23
[1:25:32] says let us hold fast the profession of
[1:25:35] our
[1:25:37] faith without
[1:25:40] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:25:44] promise the Bible also says a
[1:25:48] double-minded
[1:25:49] man is unstable in all his
[1:25:56] ways Proverbs 19
[1:26:00] says verse 14 says let the words of thy
[1:26:05] mouth and the meditation of my
[1:26:08] heart be acceptable in thy sight oh
[1:26:12] Lord 141 and verse three Psalm 141 and
[1:26:17] verse3 set a watch oh Lord before my

[1:27:07] mouth keepeth his
[1:27:11] life wo he that openeth wide his lips
[1:27:16] shall have

[1:29:16] brother and you start talking to him and
[1:29:19] he don't even know what you're talking
[1:29:21] about
[1:29:22] it was all in your
[1:29:26] mind we have to cast down
[1:29:29] imagination and every High thing that
[1:29:32] exalted itself above the word of
[1:29:38] God
[1:29:40] Amen questions and
[1:29:42] answers brother brandom has asked this
[1:29:44] question please explain how a person
[1:29:48] knows if he's thinking his own
[1:29:50] thoughts
[1:29:54] or if the devil is placing thoughts in
[1:29:56] his mind to make him think
[1:30:00] wrong especially if you know you don't
[1:30:03] want to think
[1:30:08] them very simple if it's contrary to the
[1:30:13] word it's the devil's Tak
[1:30:17] it if it's with the
[1:30:19] word it's God's
[1:30:24] if it's the wrong
[1:30:26] thoughts it's the
[1:30:28] devil if it's good
[1:30:31] thoughts of the word and of God it's
[1:30:34] God's
[1:30:41] thinking hello
[1:30:44] somebody did you not did you notice who
[1:30:47] he left
[1:30:48] out
[1:30:50] you he said the devil he said
[1:30:54] God but the devil wants to come put
[1:30:57] thoughts in your
[1:30:59] mind and make you and make you think
[1:31:02] it's your
[1:31:04] thoughts when it's his thoughts but if
[1:31:07] it's contrary to the word of God it's
[1:31:11] not your thinking it's the devil's
[1:31:15] thinking but if it's susceptible to the
[1:31:17] word of
[1:31:18] God it's
[1:31:20] God's
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:28] here's another
[1:31:29] question in the case may be that the
[1:31:31] devil is placing thoughts in your mind
[1:31:33] about a certain
[1:31:37] thing how may it be that I can overcome
[1:31:39] it or get rid of
[1:31:43] it he says go the opposite
[1:31:50] direction
[1:31:52] if you know you're a
[1:31:54] Christian and the devil tries to make
[1:31:56] you think you're not a
[1:31:58] Christian you say I am a
[1:32:01] Christian I am a
[1:32:18] Christian the man the man the man
[1:32:20] continues with
[1:32:22] question he
[1:32:24] said when you answer this please pray
[1:32:26] for me to overcome I know I'm not by
[1:32:32] myself brother brandham says God grant
[1:32:34] your overcoming whoever you
[1:32:38] are may your thoughts go to the right
[1:32:41] place I am a
[1:32:43] Christian I am a believer Satan you have
[1:32:47] no hold on me now listen to this he says
[1:32:50] frankly

[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] thing to keep from figing here in the
[1:33:00] pull
[1:33:02] pit CU he was battling the same
[1:33:12] thoughts the prophet had those kind of
[1:33:20] thoughts
[1:33:22] he was
[1:33:25] human hey the the the the devil appeared
[1:33:28] in his room one
[1:33:32] morning and he began to speak to him he
[1:33:35] said you have no power with
[1:33:39] God of all people to tell that
[1:33:43] to he had cast out demons after demon
[1:33:46] after demon after demon and he's
[1:33:49] standing there before him

[1:34:28] in the name of Jesus
[1:34:31] CHR and he said he
[1:34:33] left and he said after he
[1:34:36] left the most precious presence came
[1:34:39] into the
[1:34:41] room and this words begin to
[1:34:44] speak the never failing presence of
[1:34:47] almighty God is with you wherever you
[1:34:50] may go
[1:34:57] I feel that same presence right

[1:56:38] now but when she was going through this
[1:56:41] issue of brain
[1:56:46] bleeds she was in and out of the
[1:56:48] hospital
[1:56:50] and she was we didn't know what would
[1:56:53] happen and I had some meetings to go to
[1:56:56] Just Like
[1:56:58] These and my father said we're at a Red
[1:57:01] Sea
[1:57:05] moment we either going to back
[1:57:08] up or we going to speak and go
[1:57:16] forward amen so we we went on I went to
[1:57:19] the
[1:57:21] meetings while I was at brother Ron
[1:57:25] Spencer I was preaching on these
[1:57:27] words the god that
[1:57:31] answers the god that
[1:57:34] answers and I would preach I was
[1:57:36] preaching on God brother Brandon speaks
[1:57:39] about
[1:57:40] it he says God answers he said God
[1:57:42] always
[1:57:44] answers but many times it's in an
[1:57:46] unexpected way and an unexpected place
[1:57:48] and an unexpected
[1:57:53] he said but the deal is you have to
[1:57:55] recognize God
[1:57:58] answered I was coming down to the end of
[1:58:00] that
[1:58:02] service and I'd walked away from my iPad
[1:58:04] here that I keep my notes
[1:58:08] on and it had went
[1:58:10] dark and I was standing in the front of
[1:58:14] the I was speaking about the three
[1:58:16] Hebrew
[1:58:18] children how that they were going into
[1:58:20] the
[1:58:21] fire we won't we'll save time here but
[1:58:24] but how God looked
[1:58:26] over and brother Bram said he caught the
[1:58:28] East Wind and the West Wind and the
[1:58:32] light and as as they stepped into the
[1:58:35] fire the fourth man came
[1:58:40] down it takes a fire to produce a Fourth
[1:58:48] Man
[1:58:51] all of a sudden I hear somebody speaking
[1:58:53] at the pull
[1:58:54] pit and I didn't have a watch at that
[1:58:57] time that would
[1:58:58] operate operate my
[1:59:01] iPad but brother Ron sitting behind
[1:59:06] us he saw my iPad light
[1:59:09] up and it goes flipping through the
[1:59:14] icons it pulls up the
[1:59:17] message goes down with the
[1:59:20] messages picks a
[1:59:23] tape picks a tape and I hear this voice
[1:59:28] said my favorite of all the
[1:59:31] hymns said Booth cin wrote it in a
[1:59:34] cornfield Booth cber name name of yeah
[1:59:38] wrote it in a
[1:59:41] cornfeld he said but it's my favorite of
[1:59:43] the
[1:59:44] hymns he said because it expresses the
[1:59:47] extreme deity of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:52] Christ especially in the day that we're
[1:59:54] living
[1:59:56] in he said people want to make him just
[1:59:58] a
[1:59:59] prophet but he was more than a prophet
[2:00:03] he was
[2:00:05] God
[2:00:07] Amen and it was booming all over the
[2:00:10] audience out of my
[2:00:15] iPad and I just looked at it for a
[2:00:18] moment went back
[2:00:21] off and I got to looking at what song he
[2:00:24] was referring
[2:00:25] to it was down from his
[2:00:28] glory ever living
[2:00:31] story my God and savior came and Jesus
[2:00:35] was his name born in a manger to his
[2:00:39] ownest
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:48] stranger I would leave that meeting go
[2:00:50] the next weekend to brother Josh
[2:00:53] Bennett my mom during that time would
[2:00:56] come out of the
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:59] hospital and seemingly
[2:01:02] improve but after I got through with
[2:01:04] preaching at brother Josh as I flew
[2:01:08] home and the day I landed in
[2:01:13] Street the day I landed in
[2:01:16] streetport she went back into the
[2:01:18] hospital
[2:01:19] and she never came out she would pass
[2:01:22] away some weeks
[2:01:24] later but a few days I would go see
[2:01:28] her she had had so many brain bleeds
[2:01:31] that she wouldn't
[2:01:35] speak you could tell maybe she
[2:01:37] recognized you a little
[2:01:39] bit she wouldn't say any
[2:01:42] words for about 20s something hours she
[2:01:44] had not spoken a word to
[2:01:47] anybody I walked into her hospital
[2:01:51] room I looked at her brother bus I said
[2:01:53] I said mom look at
[2:01:56] me I said I want to let you
[2:01:59] know God's in the
[2:02:02] fire she turned and looked at
[2:02:05] me and she started
[2:02:08] singing down from his
[2:02:15] glory ever living
[2:02:17] story
[2:02:20] my God and savior
[2:02:22] came and Jesus was
[2:02:25] his born in a
[2:02:28] mangor she sang the whole verse to me
[2:02:31] brother
[2:02:32] bus then she lifted up her hands she
[2:02:35] goes oh how I love him oh how I adore
[2:02:40] him my strength my
[2:02:42] sunshine my

[2:02:58] healed I thought it was over with that's
[2:03:00] where my faith
[2:03:02] was few weeks later she would go across
[2:03:04] the curtain of
[2:03:06] time I was sitting about the second row
[2:03:10] at her
[2:03:14] funeral and I was saying why
[2:03:17] God

[2:03:22] things and then her
[2:03:25] die he spoke these words in my
[2:03:28] ear he said she's okay he said but I
[2:03:32] came down to show you I'm in the fire
[2:03:35] with
[2:03:37] [Music]

[2:03:44] heart and he said you won't always sing

[2:52:19] service God is moving on your
[2:52:22] heart this is our last preaching
[2:52:24] [Music]
[2:52:27] service the only service we are
[2:52:29] remaining with is for
[2:52:31] Testimony but maybe your testimony is
[2:52:33] still in the
[2:52:36] making and you can have your testimony
[2:52:38] just in the next few moments right
[2:52:43] now
[2:52:45] God has told
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:48] you God has told
[2:52:52] you God has told
[2:53:02] you you can only be
[2:53:08] forgiven you can only be forgiven as
[2:53:11] much as you
[2:53:13] forgive
[2:53:18] and when the preacher spoke
[2:53:24] that the Holy Spirit instructed me at
[2:53:27] that
[2:53:31] moment to speak to
[2:53:35] you anyone who is under the sound of my
[2:53:40] voice maybe you've been dropping with a
[2:53:43] burden of
[2:53:47] forgiveness and you are
[2:53:49] bitter maybe because you were
[2:53:53] hot and your heart
[2:53:57] broken and you pray but your prayers are
[2:53:59] not
[2:54:02] answered because of that
[2:54:05] burden but if you can allow the Holy
[2:54:09] Spirit to melt your heart
[2:54:12] now and say Lord
[2:54:16] forgive and you make a resolution to
[2:54:18] walk out of this
[2:54:21] meeting and go and ask that person to
[2:54:24] forgive
[2:54:26] you they don't need to ask for
[2:54:29] forgiveness from
[2:54:32] you with this sweet spirit of
[2:54:36] God moving down on your
[2:54:39] heart all the
[2:54:42] bitterness will be behind and
[2:54:45] you and the love of
[2:54:49] God that passes all
[2:54:53] understanding will come and cool over
[2:54:55] your
[2:54:59] heart and give you
[2:55:02] peace and joy
[2:55:05] unspeakable and full of
[2:55:09] Glory But
[2:55:11] first you must forgive
[2:55:15] I wonder how many
[2:55:17] here are caring that
[2:55:24] burden I don't care where you are
[2:55:27] from you may be from
[2:55:30] Congo or from Kenya or from
[2:55:34] Zimbabwe or from right here in
[2:55:37] Uganda or from any other country that is
[2:55:39] represented
[2:55:41] here I speak to you
[2:55:45] in the name of Jesus
[2:55:47] Christ let that burden of
[2:55:50] unforgiveness leave you right
[2:55:53] now be filled with the love of
[2:55:58] God forgive your
[2:56:01] enemies I instruct you to do that right
[2:56:05] now forgive your
[2:56:10] enemy God will take your
[2:56:13] Brokenness
[2:56:15] and M
[2:56:18] character you are losing your mind
[2:56:20] because of this
[2:56:24] burden and you're fighting a battle you
[2:56:26] don't even know what you're
[2:56:29] F I know God is dealing with someone
[2:56:40] here you don't have to leave these
[2:56:42] meetings the way you came
[2:56:47] you are a good
[2:56:49] person but if you allow this burden to
[2:56:52] weigh you
[2:56:54] down you will never come to a place of
[2:56:59] Victory but think about
[2:57:02] it if you can let
[2:57:04] go and let God come
[2:57:08] in you will be
[2:57:11] free you'll be full of joy
[2:57:18] love you will leave this
[2:57:21] meeting and as we heard the Devil will
[2:57:25] think you are the person that
[2:57:30] left but he will realize you're a
[2:57:32] different
[2:57:36] one some of you are going back to clean
[2:57:39] up your
[2:57:43] rooms you're going you you're going back

[3:09:42] with a precious
[3:09:46] Brothers in the convention there and
[3:09:48] praying for the sick
[3:09:50] together and the Holy Spirit just put an
[3:09:53] an inspiration on my heart to
[3:09:58] instead to come in place of the
[3:10:01] ministers I had
[3:10:04] invited um and uh well you're going to
[3:10:09] to hear about this but first hear what
[3:10:10] I'm telling
[3:10:11] you
[3:10:13] and so I spoke to brother
[3:10:16] Timothy and I told him my desire that I
[3:10:19] had on my heart for them to
[3:10:21] come and also to Brother
[3:10:24] David and brother they had some other
[3:10:26] schedules they had prepared I think you
[3:10:27] had meetings I don't know May in

[3:10:34] this or but it was just conflicting with
[3:10:37] a

[3:11:36] him that he has quite a a great
[3:11:41] ministry
[3:11:43] but he has not lost his place in the

[3:12:10] man there someone not shared this with

[3:12:18] down

[3:12:41] you've come here to support us
[3:12:43] your presence is a great great
[3:12:47] support I mean I mean imagine someone
[3:12:49] coming all the way from New
[3:12:51] Zealand and he didn't even want to
[3:12:54] preach but how many were blessed in that
[3:12:56] morning
[3:12:59] devotion God bless you brother amen and
[3:13:02] your wife who here with
[3:13:04] us this has been a big meeting for
[3:13:07] us the first of the kind last year was
[3:13:10] not as big as this
[3:13:15] uh uh but this year it has been a bit
[3:13:19] bigger and uh I mean we're talking of
[3:13:22] nine
[3:13:23] countries we have eight Flags there but
[3:13:25] actually there's a ninth one the
[3:13:31] brother and so many people have been
[3:13:34] streaming it from around the
[3:13:36] world we've heard from a
[3:13:39] few there's a pastor in h who I wanted
[3:13:42] to share this this on video but I think
[3:13:43] I I missed it
[3:13:45] but he I think after you ministered
[3:13:48] Brother
[3:13:50] David in one of the
[3:13:53] services he says that his daughter got
[3:13:55] an experience in the Holy
[3:13:59] Ghost they were streaming the
[3:14:02] service in the church and he asked me to
[3:14:05] share the testimony with
[3:14:08] you and there many other testimonies who
[3:14:10] have not been really accessing it that
[3:14:13] much the whole
[3:14:15] time but many people are sending in
[3:14:17] their
[3:14:19] appreciation and they're saying they are
[3:14:21] really really blessed in these
[3:14:24] meeting brother
[3:14:27] Prince from
[3:14:29] Zimbabwe uh I don't know he did not
[3:14:32] speak I think he will speak shortly
[3:14:33] after these ones because he did not
[3:14:35] introduce
[3:14:38] himself most of these are young
[3:14:41] people a few are old men and
[3:14:46] women but uh we've arranged these
[3:14:48] meetings with younger
[3:14:51] people younger people arranging young
[3:14:55] people's
[3:14:57] meetings I say praise the name of the
[3:15:00] Lord amen and so we had many
[3:15:04] departments uh because of time I'm not
[3:15:06] going to ask them to speak or do you
[3:15:08] want them to
[3:15:10] speak because we need to leave this
[3:15:14] Place quickly so that they can take the
[3:15:16] speakers and set it up on the
[3:15:19] firep so because of that I'm not going
[3:15:22] to let them
[3:15:24] speak do you allow me to speak on all
[3:15:27] your
[3:15:28] behalf so God bless you so I'm going to
[3:15:31] introduce one by one when I do then you
[3:15:34] can
[3:15:37] leave my mother when I believe the
[3:15:40] message she chested me out of the
[3:15:43] house and she told me she has disowned
[3:15:46] me and she said because I've gone into
[3:15:49] fake
[3:15:51] things after two years I connected with
[3:15:56] her after her anger had
[3:16:00] reduced and I ministered this message to
[3:16:03] her uh a few years after
[3:16:06] that I I I was in Nairobi with some
[3:16:10] brothers and we I developed a big burden
[3:16:13] to pray for

[3:40:26] come bigger like bigger than
[3:40:29] this you told me you going to come
[3:40:31] bigger two have already left their
[3:40:34] Patron brother Isaac ISAC uh for some
[3:40:38] reason he had to to drive back with
[3:40:39] another
[3:40:42] appr and so we also have brother
[3:40:46] Prince but Prince has quite a
[3:40:50] testimony and we got connected in
[3:40:56] Zimbabwe you know he was born in the
[3:40:58] message and then left went into the
[3:41:01] world and then came back so I found him
[3:41:04] when he was
[3:41:06] back but you know still struggling and
[3:41:09] questioning whether
[3:41:10] not to go to
[3:41:12] Ministry but while we ministering
[3:41:14] together he actually intered one
[3:41:18] service and then they gave me another
[3:41:20] interpreter I I told Pastor side why is
[3:41:24] that young man that interpreted for
[3:41:27] me said that one
[3:41:30] there but Pastor was like that is there
[3:41:32] when the pastor does that you know that
[3:41:35] issue but he said that one is running
[3:41:37] away from
[3:41:38] Ministry I said I want him can we go
[3:41:41] with him
[3:41:42] to and my we had quite an experience
[3:41:45] didn't we and and and uh ever since
[3:41:49] we've been
[3:41:50] connected and from after those meetings
[3:41:53] he took to the
[3:41:55] streets God Le a fire in
[3:41:58] him I was told 15 people have already
[3:42:00] been baptized from the
[3:42:03] streets and I'm so glad for him to be
[3:42:06] here and I asked P I said would you like
[3:42:09] him to come he said
[3:42:12] you representing an entire nation you
[3:42:14] have to stand
[3:42:17] here God bless
[3:42:19] you I greet you all in the lovely name
[3:42:22] of our Lord Jesus
[3:42:26] Christ the prophet one time in a vision
[3:42:28] said I saw black hands lifted
[3:42:33] up and I'm glad and I believe and I'm
[3:42:36] glad and I
[3:42:38] believe that amongst those hands
[3:42:41] with my very black
[3:42:44] hands like the Pastor said I was born in
[3:42:46] the
[3:42:48] message but the message was not born in
[3:42:51] me so along the lines you know the devil
[3:42:54] plays tricks on you
[3:42:57] because because you're not yet grounded
[3:42:59] in the
[3:43:00] message so when the pastor was preaching
[3:43:03] he was talking about me right
[3:43:06] there and his testimony is exactly like
[3:43:08] my testimony
[3:43:11] but God is gracious and kind and
[3:43:16] merciful the prophet says we were in
[3:43:18] God's mind before the foundations of the
[3:43:21] world and if God would lose me that
[3:43:24] would mean God has lost his
[3:43:30] mind of which God can never lose his
[3:43:34] mind my name is brother
[3:43:38] Prince
[3:43:41] but one
[3:43:43] day but one day I just had an
[3:43:46] inspiration
[3:43:48] somewhere I told myself I love the name
[3:43:53] g did I know little did I know that when
[3:43:56] I was born my father actually wanted to
[3:43:57] give me that
[3:44:01] name but he did not know what it meant
[3:44:04] Pastor so I gave myself that
[3:44:07] name and I had to go and tell the
[3:44:10] meaning of
[3:44:14] it it means
[3:44:17] gentleman and I believe that I'm one of
[3:44:21] the very few gentlemen left in this
[3:44:22] world Amen so I like to thank my pastor
[3:44:29] Pastor you know forgive me Pastor for
[3:44:32] taking much of your
[3:44:34] time you know God sends an answer every
[3:44:37] time when you need
[3:44:38] him I was I was going I was going you
[3:44:43] know in my mind I had one thought that
[3:44:46] was telling me that
[3:44:49] something you know you have that
[3:44:52] feeling but one part of me was looking
[3:44:54] at where I
[3:44:58] have and I felt so
[3:45:03] ashamed so when he
[3:45:05] came I was actually conflicting in my
[3:45:08] mind
[3:45:11] then I was on the pulpit asking
[3:45:14] God after that he came to me after the
[3:45:17] service he said young man you
[3:45:20] preach I took it as a question and I
[3:45:23] said no because I was
[3:45:26] running he corrected me and
[3:45:29] said I am not asking you I am telling
[3:45:33] you then the the way that it began one
[3:45:37] day after all night I was sleeping
[3:45:41] thinking out of the blue a friend of
[3:45:43] mine sends me a testimony by Pastor per
[3:45:50] green where he wanted to move from one
[3:45:52] city to another and he was conflicting
[3:45:53] in his mind and as the
[3:45:57] prophet about how do I know the will of
[3:46:00] God in my
[3:46:02] life you know that short clip came to me
[3:46:05] at the time when I was thinking of
[3:46:08] it
[3:46:10] but still I
[3:46:11] ran until one day I was sitting in a
[3:46:14] Combi TX back home we call them combies
[3:46:17] yeah you call them taxi taxi and God
[3:46:21] sent a drunkard holding a beer bottle in
[3:46:23] a comie sitting in front of
[3:46:28] me him he started preaching to
[3:46:32] me Holy Ghost convicted
[3:46:36] me said you are
[3:46:38] running and now look at you a drunker
[3:46:41] with a bottle of Castle ler is preaching
[3:46:43] to you in
[3:46:46] a if you want to run continue to
[3:46:50] run but somewhere along the
[3:46:54] line my story and that's the reason why
