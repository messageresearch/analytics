our Lord Jesus Christ God bless you so much amen thank you so much for fellowshipping with us tonight I just uh told Brother Martin uh I think we can do because I see 100% is uh can be able to hear English and I have a lengthy subject uh just to make sure that I I go through it all we can do that interpretation tonight is that okay uh turn with me to the book of Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 8 if you have your Bible with you Samuel is one of the prophets we are reading chapter 8 of 1 Samuel verses we will read from verses 1 to 7 and then we shall be seated after that and it came to pass when so Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel now the name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second ABIA they were judges in BBA and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after the laer and and took bribes after L and then took bribes and perverted judgment and when all the Elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel unto Rama and said unto him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased Samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel taken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them amen you may have your seats may the Lord bless the reading of his word tonight so nice to see uh different ones today that have come to be in the uh part of the service and also those who are online we just greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ so today I want to deal with the subject of the bishop of our souls now uh there has been h a discussion on one of the uh forums uh on WhatsApp some of you I see some of you members on that Forum called the Western Uganda forum and it's BR brought a lot of heartbreaks to some people and sometimes some of them have even been ministers and um they've been dealing with this subject and a lot of young people excited about the subject so one of them actually wrote me today and uh and was pointing me to one of the sermons that uh um one of the pastors was dealing with and he said aha this is what I want you to comment about and so usually I feel a bit timid to comment on such things on public forums I believe that um the WR way to comment on such things the subjects it's um is on the pulpit behind the sacred desk where the Holy Spirit comes and helps us so uh today I want to speak on the bishop of our souls and there's been especially in our generation this is is a subject I want to really approach in um uh a very humble way because our Our Generation has suffered a lot of um uh problems when it comes to uh honor or when it comes to honoring uh uh the men of God or the Servants of God or the officers that God has presented to us as a church recently in my home I was dealing with one of the young men came from Eastern Uganda and he had a lot of resentment for one of the elders and he was you know having a way says okay you can also rebuke an elder you know if he does something wrong but you know I took we almost went uh into the word and we took about 2 hours or or even more and he might actually hear this and we were talking about horor and I also uh sent him my my um one of the sermons I preached here and I titled it um sowing uh sowing horor and harvesting access how many remember that yeah so those of you who missed it you should really go back to it we are one of the churches here that really believe in honor in honoring uh each other but also honoring Servants of God and Men of God now if you read the message and if you're really a believer of the message you realize that brother bham was someone that um honored all men of God regardless of whether they were Believers of this message or they were from the denominations brother banam honored them he respected them even when he called them on the microphone maybe to pray for them he would say you you're a man of God or you're a servant of God from such and such a church you would even mention the name of the church where the man of God is coming from sometimes he not even of course it wasn't even Believers of the message of the hour but you see our Prophet honored men of God in his time there were others who was uh God was using in a might way for example there were others like U um Billy Graham there was Tios born at the time T we know much of his Healing Ministry started with brother bham of course but even he was ministering uh during the time before he met brother bham uh there were others like especially Billy Graham and or Roberts these were um having also big campaigns during that time and if you hear how brother bam was of course uh mainly how he was referring to them and talking to them he wasn't trying to show the people that he was the big shot and they were nothing but he was honoring them before his people you would think that if you honor another Minister before your people they will follow the other minister but bam was never bothered by that he knew that if God called him no man can take his place if God called you or calls you no man can take your place and you can't take another man's place so if I stand on the pull pit here and I honor another man of God I Hon another Pastor it doesn't mean that now you know I will get afraid oh people are going to leave my church and I go to that church because I honored the other man you see you have to understand in the economy of God each of us has a place and no man can take your place in your family you know you might be more than one child but no one can take place what God has made you you will be and no one can take or replace you you are the only you that is in the world and you see when you understand that you actually in your own individual life you will learn really honoring people honoring men of God honoring each other honoring your elders especially if someone is older than you to honor them and honor comes in many ways honor comes in you know humbling yourself when you're speaking to somebody it comes when you in some you know you know you bow down a little bit or you kneel or you even give something did you know that even to give someone something is honor and you know we talked about that woman the Queen of Sheba the Queen of Sheba went with a lot of gifts and you know she was going to meet a king King Solomon and uh she did not go empty-handed she went with a lot of gifts and gave it to um to to the King King Solomon and because of these gifts that she went with I believe there must someone must have told the king there is a woman who has come we don't know who she is but she has come with a lot of gifts and the king must up said oh a lot of gifts let her come in I believe those kind of gifts were so big and so much that it even you know the King was so rich King Solomon but those gifts must have uh you know melted the heart of the king to even desire to meet this woman who is she let her come in because of those many things she took and U so she got access to the king and and you know the rest is history we know that uh uh she was the one that um you know is exchanging words with King Solomon in the book of Song of Solomon so we see of course we know that she's typing the bride and Solomon was typing uh typing Christ praise the name of the Lord and so we also see honor of course comes in gifting did you know that even when you come to church and you give your you give an offering you give a tithe you give you know do you know you are honoring God by doing that and that's why we do not want to come to church empty-handed because if if you come empty-handed you are not honoring God by doing that well of course you have honored him by coming to worship him and all that but giving is a part of worship so we see that we honor God by giving we honor him by worshiping him and you cannot say you have woried him in spirit and in truth without giving so giving is part of our worship to God can we say Amen to that well you have to say Amen if what you are hearing is the word of God don't just look at me and be a spectator praise the name of the Lord and so we also realize that um you know uh blessing one another like you can you know if you have some money or you have a cloth or you have something and you give it to a brother you give it to a sister that also is honor and so when you you honor each other or when you honor generally when you honor anyone in life you get access to whatever God has given them and I wish that was is what I was speaking about today but I'm speaking about something else but I say one more thing that sometimes you know when we say honor it's not even you know you know bowing down sometimes it is you know the Bible says that he that receives a prophet in the name of what a prophet receives what the prophet's reward so what is the prophet's reward I believe you know this Prophet God has given him a a blessing God has given him an anointing God has given whatever God has given to him either for you or it is upon his life as an anointing whatever is upon him or them if you honor them God will also place it upon your life or somehow you know you realize that um God can actually uh you know take him and then use him in your life in such a way that you will also feel blessed feel honored by God simply because you honored that Prophet there is a little you know a prophet called Elisha these little boys or little girls whoever they were they were they came running behind him and and shouting because this man had a bold head you know how is it called in luganda a and they were shouting CH man you know he was having a bald head and while they were doing that God was not happy with them of course but God did nothing but here is a prophet a man of God who was anointed you see that anointing upon him could give life and it could also give death H and you see because they approached him in a a wrong way they ashamed him they ridiculed him you know they did not receive the H which was upon his life but they received a curse and he you know he called the Sheep bearers out of the forest and the Sheep bearers two bearers big they came and ate up these children one by one and finished them 40 of them 40 of them so if that could happen I believe if those children had honored that man of God they would have received a blessing so if you receive a a you know a blessing if you receive rather the man of God in the name of that man of God and you honor a man of God or you honor a woman of God a child of God God will give you the blessing that is upon their life or the honor rather the anointing which is upon their life and I was telling this young man I said you saw uh he had seen this interview with one of our uh billionaire brothers from Nigeria so he was like I think Pastor now you have a lot of money I said look this is the problem that we have in Africa we think that when you meet someone who has a lot of money they should give you what they should give you some of their money but listen it is not their it is not my money it is their money I told this brother I actually gave to this brother you see I ought not have said that public but I've already said it so you see I I had to give you see what was I doing I was honoring him I was blessing him and by doing that God has to also bless me with at least something that he has blessed him with so I'm tapping into that anointing I hope this is all right this is not Penta this is Believers this is what we believe praise the name of the Lord and so I believe that members of this church CH young or old you should really honor Elders you should honor men of God a preacher a pastor whoever it is just honor them God will bless you for doing that and so today I just want on that basis to approach this subject um I don't know whether this is the right TI to give it but I just thought I should just throw those words out Bishop of our souls because what was being debated on is oh should we call some believer some uh Brothers Bishops or some others are calling themselves bishop or it is wrong to call each other bishop and things like that but um um this I I just want to approach it this way here is a man of God Samuel a prophet of of God of course from the time God had made Israel a nation or God had called them and called them his people God was using prophets God was using men of God and we see that Samuel was one of them and God was judging Israel using a prophet now a prophet is a man that God was speaking to and now this man would bring the mind of God to the people and so he was more like a king Prophet so you see was having all those offices Israel did not have a king like the rest of the tribes like the rest of the Nations around them so they had only a prophet and so now as Samuel became old they um he um made the Bible says he made his sons judges judges over Israel like leaders you know he kind of delegated authority that he had upon his sons and one of them was Joel the firstborn another one the second one was ABIA and and so they were judges in BBA and the Bible says that his sons walked not in his ways of course this was a man of God called by God anointed by God having the spirit of God upon him he was an elder among them but you see they honored him they respected him but now when he delegated the authority to these other young men this young man did not walk in his way the ways of his father and so these men felt so bad they said no no no no we cannot accept we cannot accept such younger men to rule over us or to lead us to mislead us when we can also do something about it so they connived among themselves they came together and they all agreed they said we now need from today we need a king over us just like other nations around us you see we need a king and so they uh they came to Samuel and they told him look Samuel I think you're now growing old and now you you know your sons are not leading Us in the ways that you have been leading us we want a king to judge over us now I do not know it's a matter of debate uh on the issue of the sons of Samuel now I believe the sons of Samuel I don't know whether it was God who told Samuel to do it or it was Samuel who did it on his own I don't know but let me tell you Brethren God always wants you to honor his servants if a man of God Rises up and you believe him as a man of God well even if he makes a mistake in fact there is a quote where brother bam says if your pastor comes up raises up receive him as a man of God even if it says no matter what he does if you respect him in that category in that office you are receiving him as that office God will respect you for doing so so you see he says no matter what he does why because God understands that Servants of God pastors whatever preachers they are also human beings and they can actually make a mistake but you see if you receive him you're not receiving a man of God because he's perfect because he has never done anything wrong wrong or said anything wrong actually many times even here on the pulpit we miss say things or say things the wrong way but you see you understand and say well I receive it because he's a man of God but I understand what he was saying there is actually a sister here who corrected me I miss said some scripture and and you know I uh what scripture was that sister yeah remind me because I needed to correct it I forgot also to correct it when I came back on the other Sunday she doesn't want to to to be recognized but um there's a scripture I think I was I don't now remember what was I speaking about let me to remember I was speaking about um oh I just if I remember it I'll let you know but she came up and corrected me and said pastor that that was not supposed to be this it was supposed to be I said oh yes it was supposed to be that way I miss said it but you see she doesn't now say oh no he's not he's no longer my pastor actually because you know no you respect him as long as God has put him in that office there is an anointing upon him in that office and if you respect that anointing God will honor you for doing so and so we notice here that I don't know whether the man of God had made a mistake or not but you see he made his sons um uh you know judges and they misid things and they did wrong things and so people came up and they said we no longer now want these judges and we no longer want you some to be a prophet to us and things like that we actually want a king over us like the other nations and um Samuel said all right it's okay I've heard your request let me go to God and Samuel went to God and when he asked from the the Lord the Lord told him hacken unto the voice of the people in all that they have said unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me in other words God was identifying himself with the office and position and calling of Samuel and he's saying well by rejecting you the prophet they have rejected me and he says I should not Reign Over them so was God reigning over them was God ruling over them yes was God ruling over them yes but how was he ruling over them he was ruling over them using a man of God so right before I even continue I want to say God is our Bishop God is our leader God is the one who rules over us but God always uses human beings without a human being God can do nothing in the Book of Amos 3:7 it says you know um you know you know surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets praise the name of the Lord and so uh in Psalms 118:8 and please I just want you to follow me because this is some kind of um a teaching in a way I'm just going to read a lot of quotes and I want you to follow me and follow the trend of thought in the Book of Psalms 118:8 it says it is a it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in Princess hallelujah how many believe that it is better to trust in the Lord I always say and I always tell people do not trust in a man but trust in that in the god in that man because you see that is why it is very dangerous for a Believer to marry an unbeliever because you see if you marry an unbeliever how can you trust them where is your confidence our confidence is not in people our confidence is in God but you see God uses people and if uses if God is so confident in a man then I'm also so confident trusting in that man that God has sent why because I'm not trusting in the man but I'm actually trusting in the god of that man William Bram was a man but why do we believe him as a prophet because God Amen had confidence in him God stood Amen in a pill of fire and was just right there to prove that look I am with with this man so anybody who wouldn't believe in him as a messenger of Our Generation doesn't have confidence in God amen when God sent Samuel whoever did not believe in Samuel did not actually believe in God that's how God operates that is how his word operates and as Believers we want to believe everything that God says in his word we have we want to have confidence in God not confidence in man and you see by the way the difference the major difference between denominations and the message is denomination trust in man but the message we trust in God as I would show you later on you see we don't trust in man we trust in God the Catholic Church they they choose their Pope and the man leads them and they choose another one and even in these other churches they choose men and they send this one over there they send this one over there and you know there's one man maybe in a headquarter you know controlling everything but the Believers work and operate differently because the bishop of our souls as I will show you later is Jesus Christ now I want you to see in the message the rejected King the rejected King 196 if you can get this course it will be all right brother Marvin he says but still it isn't the will of God that man should rule over man I did not hear any amen it is not the will of God that what man should rule over man God sent on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost to rule in man's hearts and rule in his life it was not meant for man to rule over man but we love to say that it's a very outstanding thing when we can say we belong to such a great organization that is why it is something very confusing for people when they hear about us and they ask us where is your headquarter and we tell them our headquarters in heaven they would say what so you mean you have no Archbishop we said no we have no Arch Bishop so what is wrong with you how I mean they don't how someone asked me how do you even you know correct each other when they mistakes when they the wrong things when a person makes a mistake they can't understand that actually God wants to have the Holy Spirit ruling in many's Hearts if it is the holy spirit ruling in many's Hearts then we don't need all these kind of organizations because it is God ruling his own church from the very beginning that is how it has been now as I'm building I want you to follow me closely because you see to miss this he like walking on a razor blades age you can go the other side or go the other side I want you to really follow me closely if you have notes a pen and a paper you can write some of these quotes or scriptures and then read it later listen it says in the message the rejected King he says do you see the holy spirit is our judge God never give us a pope or a bishop amen or anybody Amen to be a judge the Holy Spirit the person of God in the form of the Holy SP spirit is our judge and our guide how many believe that from the time the Israelites desired a king they had rejected God a king is someone who would rule them after the desire of his own heart not after the desire of God but after the desire of his own heart now you have to understand when we talk about a king or when we talk about these Bishops of the world and um and you know the the the judges and things like that these are people who rule according to the desire you just look at um I read this for you in one of the services look at First Kings 11:37 he says and I will take thee now this is when aijah Prophet aijah was speaking to jeroboam you remember Prophet are he just speaking to jeroboam uh when God was promising jeroboam that he will give him the kingdom uh if he walks in the ways of of of David so he said and I will take thee and thou shalt Reign according to all that thy Soul desires and sh be king over Israel there many many things I want to say today but I want you to give me your undivided attention and follow closely but also say Amen so I can be able to continue so we see here that um um this is Prophet aijah when he he gave this prophecy what did he tell uh the man jeroboam he told him you see I will take thee now God was telling him if you do this if you do this all right then I will will take thee meaning jeroboam and you will reign you meaning You Will Rule according to what to what God desires according to thy Soul desire and shall be king over Israel now you have to understand a king is not always aligned with God's will a king has his own will as much as a prophet does not have his own will a prophet always has the will of God a man of God who is sent by God ordained by God Sanctified by God anointed by God always has the will of God but a king who is chosen by people elected by people always has his own will you go back in the Bible in the book of Acts you'll see this man who was he even was he Matthew what was his name that he that was elected by the disciples to replace Judas how many remember his name what was it was he Matthews it was Matthew say that again brother Matas I think that's another language matus Matthew matthus okay he was called Matas yes other language they called him maansi but it's the same thing matus so you see matthus how many know what brother matus did in the Bible we don't even know anything about brother matthus and because why mathus was voted by people matus was go was man elected but you see God chose one man and his name was Paul see how much Paul did see how much destruction he brought to the kingdom of darkness why because Paul was elected or voted and sent out by God so you see God wants to lead his own people using his own people that he has anointed and he sent out okay now I want you to follow closely here a king King when he he's a king he should rule usually Kings rule according to the desires of their own Hearts not according to the will of God but according to the desires of their own hearts and that's how the Bishops of the denominations are it's according to the desires of their own hearts and maybe their Church uh kind of uh agreements and things like that not according to the word of God the will of God that's why many times they mislead people from the word of God to their own church doctrines because they are there to guard their Church doctrines not the word of God now I want you to to take your Bible with me to the book of 1 Samuel and we are going to look at um at we are going to continue looking at those words that um Samuel spoke when they said they needed a king I want you to see the response of God H to um to to these people in verses chapter 8 in verses 9 praise the name of the Lord you will find this very amazing very very amazing uh chapter 8: 9 now therefore Heen unto their voice now this is God telling Samuel prophet Samuel to to listen to the people he says listen to them but yet protest Solly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them uhhuh he says Now do not you just listen to what they telling you listen to them but also tell them about the person that is going to R to rule over them look at verse 10 he says and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people now it isn't it amazing by the way that prophet Samuel God does not God did not explain just please listen to me God did not explain to prophet Samuel how this King will be but prophet Samuel was so much aligned with God that he knew the mind of God about how those King Kings will rule the people and I wanted to hear the next words on how he spoke to them and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked him of a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his Horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over 50s and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his Harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be Bakers and he will take your fields and your vineard and your olivard even the best of of them and give them to his servants and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your Vineyards and give to his officers andto his servants you see the authority of um of a king that did not come from God but a king that the people desired H and that's how the generations are our generation you know the denominations the Bible says they have heed upon themselves teachers having itching ears you know people that will tell them what they want to hear they will vote them into Power into Ministry be our Bishop be our this be our that be our pastor and he will take your men servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen which ye shall have chosen uh uh all right let me read that again and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye uh shall have chosen and the Lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of Samuel and they say nay but we will have a king over us this is how the people are they cannot be in a church without a bishop they cannot be in a church without a hierarchy without you know this kind of you know headquarters this and that that and that and that and that and that and they feel that we message Believers are losers because there some of them even say we are you know others say we are a c because we don't have a hierarchy we don't have a headquarter they want our headquar to be somewhere in America our headquarter is in heaven Hallelujah all over the world we are one body Hallelujah and so the people have always desired that and this is what God told them if you put if you choose a man and you make him a you know a bishop or or a king I keep using the word Bishop which means overseer which means like a king and I'll get into that a little bit later on and he says you see and you choose a man over you and make him a king over you you know he's going to do all these things to you he's going to make you suffer he's going to use you he's going to you know make you servants he's going to even take from you and steal from you and things which belong to you and um you know he he he will make you cry he says he will make you cry out in that day but God will not hear you but they still said huh we have heard but still we want a king and God gave them what a king but I want to show you where our King is in the book of 1 Peter chapter 2: 21 for even here too where you he called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that he should follow his steps who did not sin neither was gu found in his mouth he's talking about our King friends Hallelujah who did not sin oh my the other king would make you suffer would make you do this would make you suff but you you know what our King did he did not sin neither was God found in his mouth who when he was reviled revived not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judged righteously who his own bear his own self bear our sins instead of putting sins on us he Beed he took our sins upon himself in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live un righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed for ye were as sheep going astray but now you are returned unto the shepherd and Bishop of your souls Hallelujah so now Jesus Christ the one who suffered he became a servant and the Bible says he that became a servant he that took his sins our sins upon him he is actually the bishop of our Souls praise the name of the Lord and so now I'm going to read two significant quotes Okay and others as well but two significant quotes one from the paman church age and another from the Ephesian Church age and I want you to follow through with each of them because you see if you just leave right now you will miss I want you to join everything okay uh let's first go through with it in in the pamman church age I'll just begin reading from somewhere he says you will recall that I brought out in the Ephesian Church age that the word nicolon the word nicolan comes from two Greek words Nik which means to conquer and la which means the L okay nikol means to conquer the are you now seeing are you connecting here it is just like the king that Israelites said we want you to have give us a king So now there would come somebody having a spirit of nicolan wanting to conquer the lady that's why we don't have such things in the message churches where you have a bishop saying you go to that church you come out from that church you do that you this one remove him this one you know no we don't have things like that why because you see the denomination people have it because for them they have this Spirit of nicolan ruling over them in their churches okay listen carefully Nika which means to conquer and Laos which which means the lady nicolan means to conquer the lady now why is this such a terrible thing it is terrible because God has placed God sorry God has never place his church in the hands of an elected leadership which moves with political mind edness you have to shout Amen on that God has never placed a church his church in the hands of people with a mind of politics church is not run by politics or political mind church is led by God the bishop of our souls and you know he says he has bless his church in the care of God ordained spirit filled word living men who lead the people through feeding them the word so you see how God was using Samuel Samuel was spirit filled Samuel was God ordained Hallelujah Samuel was wor living and because of that God was using him and now here we are saying the same brother is saying the same thing God is doing today God always puts his church in the hands of God ordained spirit filled wory living man so men Yes Men we'll come to that later on who lead the people through feeding them the word not saying I am your pastor do that I am your pastor leave that woman and marry and take this one leave that man is not your husband take this one you see why why did you divorce you know my Bishop told me my pastor told me my my overseer General overse told me for us we are liberated from those things Hallelujah the has set us free from denominations and the speed of nanism Hallelujah he has not separated the people into classes so that the masses are led by our holy priesthood it is true that the leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation we have nothing like the holy priesthood like they have in Roman Catholicism or or Orthodox or whatever they are the holy ones they don't even marry and yet they so full of hypocrisy they said they don't marry but you see the many of them they after they they are dead people realize that oh they had a wife and the children actually these days they even know know the public you see the other is the wife of the father so-call father the Bible says called no man father on Earth I am the he's the only our heavenly father but you see they have wives here on Earth and yet they claim publicly that they don't marry because they are living a Celebrate life for the sake of the Gospel but that's why even the book of First Timothy he said what he I think it is second Timothy somewhere I wish I would get it quickly is chapter 4 second someone could quickly check it for us he said you see they do it in hypocrisy in hypocrisy they are not tell in the truth they forbid to marry they they they forbid to they tell people to abstain from certain Meats they do it what in hypocrisy praise the name of the Lord okay I don't know whether it is chapter chapter 2 is it chapter two okay let me let me get it for you here because I thought it is a a very good one some of those quotes when you speak it it's good to uh give the people a quot did you get it 1 Timothy chapter 4 oh yeah I I had gone to 2 Timothy chter 4 vers um vers 2 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with with a hot iron forbidding to marry commanding to abstain from Meats which God has created to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it is received with Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the word of God and prayer that's why for us we eat everything including pork amen and that's why we marry we don't forbid people to marry but you see they forbid to marry they they tell people to absend from me but they do it in hypocrisy because they go behind and do those things which they told people they shouldn't do them you see this is what happens with these kind of of of of leaders you see but a prophet goes ahead to say father there is no place in the world where priests or ministers or such mediate between God and the people no nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord God wants all to love and to serve him together can you say Amen to that he says listen nanism destroys those precepts and instead separates the ministers from the people and makes the leaders overlords instead of servants Jesus is the bishop of our soul but he was a servant all preachers all men of God all pastors all Bishops should be servants yes now this Doctrine actually started as a deed in the first age it appears that the problem lay in those two words Elders which means preceptors and overseers which means Bishops now I want you to see the meaning of these two words says though scriptures shows that there are several Elders in each Church some began ignaas among them to teach that the idea of a bishop was one of preeminence or authority and control over the elders now the truth of the matter is the word Elder signifies who the person is while the word Bishop signifies the office of the same man yes sir so the the Elder is the pastor but also he says it is who he is right the Elder is an elder we will see here he explains later on who the Elder is but you see he says the Elder is the man and and Bishop is the office of the same man that is why in first Timothy chapter 3 I believe he says this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work and then he begins to talk about the qu qualifications of a bishop you see the bishop is an office he says the Elder is the man Bishop is the office of the man Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord am he is an elder not because he is elected ordained Etc but because he is older okay so for instance you know a man goes and starts a Ministry and you know he B many children in the Lord and you know you see him as an elder some times you know God has given me that privilege of being an elder both in Ethiopia also here and sometimes you realize that even the people that see you as an elder you they actually older than you in age but he not talking about the age of the world he's not saying an elder with beards white beard gray beards and you know having a stick you know he's an elder he's talking about the age in the Lord not a novice an older man in the Lord or in the ministry he he's about an elder his chronological age he is an elder not because he is elected or ordained but because he is older he is more seon so you can even have more Elders actually in the church who are not even pastors you see because they are older in the Lord and many times you look up to them oh this is an elder in the church not because he order but because he's he's been in the in the in the truth for a long time and sometimes they the deacons and so forth now listen he's an elder not because he's elected ordained Etc but because he's older he is more seasoned he is more trained not an noice reliable because of experience and long-standing proof of his Christian experience but no the Bishops did not stick to the Epistles of Paul but rather they went to Paul's account of the time he called the elders from Ephesus to meitus in Acts 20 in verse 17 record States Elders were called and then in vers 28 they are called overseers now if you look in Acts 20: 17 here they call them elders but in vers 28 they call them overseers same people so these these these Elders were also the same people who were called Bishops or overseers bishop and overseer means the same thing because they were overseers of Bishops of some Churches there and these Bishops no doubt politically minded he's talking about the other wrong kind of Bishops with the wrong kind of mind set and these Bishops no doubt politically minded and anxious for power insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers now now first of all before I continue There is the right kind of Bishops scriptural bibilical and the wrong kind of Bishops that's why I said it is like working on a res Ed you can miss it there's the right kind of way of looking at it and the wrong kind of way of looking at it now brother bam here is explaining to us the the the what they thought which was actually the wrong kind of way he says listen there were more than local um he says insisted that Paul had given the meaning that overseers were more than the local Elder with official capacity only in his own church to them so in other words these people these false Elders or these bishops from the false Church system were insisting that the word bishop or overseer was meaning a man who had more Authority surpassing his own local church to control other pastors of other local churches so to them a bishop was now one with extended authority over many local Elders such a concept was neither scriptural nor historical yet even a man of the sture of polyup do you know polyup was supposed to be the messenger of the second Church age but he was scrapped off and he ran as his student became the messenger of the second Church age why because he did not lean towards this idea and this kind of spirit of nanism he says but even a man of the state of Poa leaned toward such organization thus that which started as a deed in the first age was made a little Doctrine and so it is today Bishops still claim power to control men and to deal with them as they desire you remember now the idea of the kingdom and kingship you know they have that idea that this is my kingdom and they rule this and rule that and tell this and do that this according to their own desire blessing them where they saw Will in the ministry this denies the leadership of the Holy Ghost who said separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work where unto I have called them this is anti- word and Antichrist the prophet says you see this kind of idea to think that a bishop is one that has a power to control men and to deal with them as he desires telling placing this one there placing another here denying one leadership here you know it is denying the Holy Ghost leadership to the church because it's the Holy Spirit who actually spoke and said separate me Paul and Barnabas how does he speak he speaks through gifts he speaks through his word he speaks through the Holy Ghost but to go against that is anti- word and his Antichrist Matthew 20:25 he says but Jesus called unto them uh called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise Authority upon them but it shall not be so among you you didn't hear that let me read it again but Jesus called unto them called them unto him and said ye know that the princes meaning the Kings and all that of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them over the people and they that are great exercise Authority upon them the people but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be greater among you let him be your minister and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but he came to minister to give his life for a ransom for many by the way this is what we believe Hallelujah we don't believe in men exercising authority over the others politically We Believe Amen in men who are great among us to be servants to serve others if you can't humble yourself to serve you are not called into the ministry Ministry is all about service Ministry is all about service yes sir not Power Glory esteem and you know and all those kind of things it's all about humility and service you know Jesus was the greatest Minister was the greatest man that came and lived on Earth but do you know what he did he washed the disciples feet he washed the disciples feet the dirtiest part of the body and he said to them even Peter had refused he says you can't wash my feet he said but if I don't wash your feet you are not part of me he says okay wash my old body you know friends I want to tell you something if you are great you will be humble if you want to see Great Men you will look at them and see that they are humble never mistake someone who is humble for being poor and low down always great men who know they are great will always be humble but when you find someone so stiff necked and you know hey I'm the bishop I'm the man of God I am this I'm that you know you will know that man is nothing is just an empty tin sir but thank God because the message has straightened us up it has taken us away from those kind of things that I've not seen really I've not seen any minister in the message who would you know brag and make themselves bigger than the others no why because the message humbles you the message amen puts you in your place amen you have to understand a servant not a lord over the people but a servant over the people we are ministers of the Gospel Matthew 23:8 says but be not ye called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye Brethren and call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven praise the name of the Lord he's trying to show come on be servants be humble be humble be humble now in in the message the re rejected King which I've been reading from it says now Samuel is in our message represents the Holy Spirit now Samuel was the mouthpiece of God and today the holy spirit is the mouthpiece of God and today instead of having all of our different F go in church God wants us to let him rule God wants us the Believers to let God rule not popes Bishops and General overseers and doctrines and denominations and everything he sent the Holy Spirit to rule the church Hallelujah we believe in the Holy that's why if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are not being ruled over by God he wants to be in your heart and to rule over you in the in in the message the Hebrews the Hebrews said is chapter 5 and six I promise that I would read a lot and I want to follow closely because I'm building up up to something he says but I believe in the in the supreme authority of the local assembly now having understood friends that God is the leader of this church he wants to have sovereignty he wants to be Lord over our souls he wants to lead us he wants to lift up one and bring down another and he wants the greatest among us to be servants to be humble all right but then we understand every local assembly every Church local assembly starts is is is is Sovereign he says and I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly yes Let each Church be its own choose its pastors its deacons its whatever it is and then that way the man in there has no Bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it is the individual in with the Holy Spirit show me by the Bible what what's greater in the Bible than a local Elder to a local church he says a local Elder in that local church is the greater is the greatest office that there is that's right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each Church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in brotherhood like that together but the sovereignty of the local church meaning the local church is Sovereign in itself let me let me proceed so that I can bring it all together in conclusion now listen he says now same same message now this is part two now if there is anything wrong in the church that you ever know of some individual or some person or anything you are Duty bound and you will answer before God if you don't clear that thing out you the church now remember it's not on my shoulders as a pastor it is on yours and anything wrong in the church God will make you answer for it that's right that's the way he runs his church that's the way it is in the Bible That's the order of the Bible That's the sovereignty of the local church the pastor he says the pastor is the head not General overseer somewhere the pastor of that local church is the what is the head now I want to show you having brought up that because you see when we talk about um uh the when we talk about the local church okay maybe before I I get into that let's first read from the Ephesian Church age um Chapter 3 of the church age book Ephesian Church age some of you who don't read these messages they they really are so nice if you can read them you'll grow in the things of God you'll grow in the things of God read the message yourself so that you don't get misled read the Bible read the message ah you'll be fine listen now now what was the spiritual climate of that church it had left its first love leaving its first love of the word of God was revealed to us as having fallen from its origin which was Pentecost in plain English that means the this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the Holy Spirit the control of the Holy Spirit did you see it's a danger the every church every local church must always be F by the Holy Spirit and the word not by a man or by a group of men but by the Holy Ghost he says this way this was exactly what took place after Moses LED Israel out of Egypt the way of God was to lead them by The Cloud of fire prophetic utterance Miracles and signs and God given wonders Oh Glory that's why I love this spach things brother I love it where the church hasn't these things where there is no Supernatural manifestation of the Holy Spirit where there is no Miracles where there is no signs and wonders where there is no prophetic utterances where there is no you know STS and interpretation brother we are risking by being led by men we want to be led by the Holy [Applause] Ghost this was to be accomplished by God selected oh hallelujah how was going God going to accomplish leading his church by the Holy Ghost how how by simply coming from heaven like wind no this was going to be accomplished by God selected God ordained God equipped and God sent men you cannot take men out of the equation God will always use men and if you about to hear from God on anything brother you should always respect man of God amen I tell you what many people fail to see the day of their visitation because they look at a man they don't see God in men they look at a woman they don't see God in that woman but you see God uses men and women to accomplish what he wants to accomplish you can't take that out of the equation you see what happened to these people he says men with a whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move I love that okay let's go up a little bit it says this was exactly what took place after Moses LED Israel out of the way God was to lead them was to okay all right they rebelled and wanted a set this was to be accomplished by God selected God ordained God equipped and God sent men with a whole Camp being dominated by a holy ghost move we want our church to be under a holy ghost move Hallelujah woo they re bailed and wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by we are not run by a set of Creeds and rules no we are run by the Holy Ghost they rebelled and they wanted a set of rules and Creeds to go by then they wanted a king then they wanted to be exactly like the world and went into a complete apostasy and Oblivion that is exactly how the first church age started and it will be worse it will get worse and worse until the holy spirit is completely rejected and God Must Destroy the people see how it started out in the early church it was called Deeds the Deeds of the nians then it became a Doctrine it became the standard it became the unbending way where men are simply listening to men and and the Creeds and dogmas instead of listening to the Holy Spirit and the word I continue here it finally took over and God was pushed aside Brothers may we never push God aside it started so small so quietly so in offensively H and God was pushed aside it looked so good it seemed so sound then it caught a hold and like a Pyon it squeezed out the very breath and killed all the spirituality there was in the church oh oh that false Vine is subtle it is like an angel of Light until it gets a hold on you now I want to say that I believe in leadership everybody tell your neighbor I believe in leadership but he says it is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word hallelujah and then he says now get ready for this and then he says I believe also that God has sent men in the church tell your neighbor God has sent men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men let me first stop there did you hear that what did you hear the church is ruled over by what by Men first stop there and think about it the church is ruled over by men you don't want to believe it you better shout Amen on that as well God has amen the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge woo the church in the beginning was being ruled over by Samuel he was a man God had sent to take church God uses men he says I believe that but that rule hey this is what changed the order now this is only the where the difference is the difference is here listen he says he says the church is ruled by what by men that God has done what sent to take charge but he says but that rule is by what by the word so that it is not man rule really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and the spirit are one Oh Glory not you just telling us oh I'm feeling I'm feeling I hear I hear no tell us what does the word say if what you're feeling or what you hearing or the voices you are hearing all the words you're hearing are against the word we don't want to know tell us what the word says and we shall believe you to be a man of God hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God that's why you will see a man standing on the pulpit and telling their people don't go to meetings don't go to that convention it is evil don't do that if I came here on the pulpit and said that you will surely not even hear what I said you'll behave as if you never heard why because in the message we know better we don't we are not led by a man we are led by a what we are led by a man who God has sent to take charge and that man will not rule really by his thought but he will rule by the word if I have a scripture for what I'm saying you better hear it because then is the word of God Hebrews 13:7 remember where them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation now you understand there are people that God has sent in the church to rule over you and those are the pastors the Bishops the the the apostles the the you know listen but they Ru by the word okay they rule by the word so you find now a church every church is Sovereign every church is Sovereign every chch is is independent it doesn't have a bishop somewhere but you see there is some message which has confused some of our people brother bam preached it in 1962 called sides with Jesus and some of the unlearned are confused and maybe some of them are watching me now online cuz I sent this message to some of them I said watch it you see they confused they think oh because we are led by the Holy Spirit we are led by we should we should we don't have the order in the church butam says we are not an organization but that doesn't mean we are disorganized you see we are not a denomination but we are organized in how we are doing things he says the highest office in the local church is an elder is the pastor no man over him but you see if this church days of the voice as we call it dvf if we started different fellowships out of our church which church is it from it is from dvf and therefore it's a part of the church it's part of the local Fellowship it's part of the local church and therefore it's a part of us and and that's the whole idea that B bam was speaking of in taking sides with Jesus he was not bringing the denominational idea of Bishops but he was bringing he was saying still the same thing where now the church has prospered and out of the church other fellowships have started these ones don't run and brother just goes there and says now me I'm a bishop of my own no it doesn't work that way and then you find brother en going in saying no me I'm Sovereign I'm Sovereign you just beginning you are from us you are our child we need to take care of you we are your Bishop I'm still your Bishop if I'm your Bishop here even if you go I'm still your bishop and that means Pastor it doesn't mean anything better praise the name of the Lord and this is what brother bam was speaking of in the message taking s to Jesus and I wanted to Cle to listen to it carefully and understand now I noticed that that how the churches the evangelism started scattering out everywhere from the church they they started scattering out from everywhere and when we we will take for instance the Paul becoming a great missionary to our people we find out that he went about wherever the Lord led him and he established a church and it was a new Faith the churches of those days like Asia Minor and all through Europe they didn't believe that message and when he had to preach the message and many was converted to it then there was he he if excuse me if he left the people in that condition they would wander right back into their pagan gods and into Judaism and whatever more because the people had no one to teach them the converts they had no place to go so Paul established churches in different parts of the country and then here he says each one of these churches he left someone who was in order a man that was trustworthy a man that was known as a pastor Shepherd like myself we we started the fellowship in Ethiopia in Adisa we left there a brother who is trustworthy a brother who is known as a pastor oh then after this church then become other little churches come out of it now when that church other little churches come out of what like here in dvf after we start you know start out and we begin doing evangelism and other churches begin coming out you find churches starting here churches starting there out of this what Fellowship okay are you following other little churches come out of it younger men and old men raised up and become churches okay they also become churches out of that the man that was over the first church was called the bishop are you following me now and then his that went out from him his children was called Shepherds or pastors and then each group of little churches all would come back to this bishop now people have heard this and I'm sure some of them wanted to delete this from the message it is there because it is the word of God praise the name of the Lord it is the order of of how the churches grow but you see why many people in the message have a problem with understanding this is because many message churches don't grow they remain very small 50 people in 10 in 20 years they don't even they have never heard about um maybe another church starting out from among them and so when another so when some Ministries have fellowships which grow and they bath other churches and these ones become their um sister churches and then this pastor here of thew of the original Church who brother bam is saying is the bishop the pastor the Elder the Elder really Bishop means Elder as I was starting in the beginning are you following me so uh you know the Elder who is the bishop now he is um he he has these other pastors in all these little fellowships and he says they all come back to him come back to him for what we shall see it after I'm going to to read for you come back for what come back for teaching come back for grounding come back for establishing in the knowledge of the truth not controlling around and leading like sheep are you following me but they have to come back they have to recognize that Elder but you see in the message we are not used to that maybe we used the Which churches begin we used to Breaking churches you see this one I feel a calling upon my life and then it begins brother brother R join me I'm going to start a church sister I'm going to brother I please just join me you would see I even make you the Deon brother and then they break the church and then they start another church there and and I'm Sovereign don't talk to me that is not the way brother bam told us that is not right and I thank God that this church did not start by breaking any church we started organically I love that word organically we started organically we started from the house here we went there became bigger got a tent and then until we came we came here and of course a ministry will attract different people coming from anywhere I I love the message because brother bam has presented it in such a way that it leaves no room for speculation or for debate but the BAM said any man has a right to choose a fellowship where they want to Fellowship in so you see it might be from one church or from the other church I don't care here we have people who have believed from here we have those who have joined from other churches but that's okay that's all okay it's all in the plan of God it's all in the word of God there's Provisions for that you see but you see once you come and be a part of that fellowship and you be you know then how does another church start it starts if you want to it start organically then God sends a man or if the church itself has a program like I know some Churches have programs and then maybe God do some evangelism somewhere a church begins there then the church our church our fellowship original Fellowship will look after that Fellowship for a while a while could be 5 years 10 years for until God sends a man there now you remember when I was beginning to read by bam said the church has his Sovereign in itself it chooses its own leaders you remember that not he's not talking about the original Church where there was a man with a vision to start he's talking about a church like that for example we go brother brother Deon en we go in ch there oh there in kasak whatever and then we we we do a crusade um you invite some of your friends and others come and then a church starts a church of maybe 50 people or 20 people or 30 or 50 and then we have a fellowship there running running running over time we are not going to say oh because the brother is near let him start no it doesn't work that way the church has to First grow the people have to understand the message know the message who is going to be helping them the original church is going to be sending ministers to help them and then after this church or Fellowship has grown to such an extent that it can now within among themselves choose one man to lead it's not me to say now brother I see the way I see you now I've given you that one now you I've sent you there HH we don't operate that way in the message you see you see the church itself that local church that local body of Believers there will now me as the Elder can maybe just go there to help them vote among themselves maybe suggest some names and then they vote among themselves a man that would lead the assembly after they have voted who voted for that man the people so I have no control over that man because the people are the ones who put him in that position praise the name of the Lord and so does the does it eliminate the the elders responsibility no does it eliminate the sovereignty of the local church no so you see it's an it's a misunderstanding we have in our generation and now I'll just continue here reading in this message taking Jesus maybe a little bit of uh quotes here and then I I'll close shortly listen he says then I would say each one of these men he out here now brother bam is going to begin calling out men that have started believing the message out from his church from his Fellowship where he was a pastor he says these men like brother CRA and brother Junior all of them as long as they feel their duty at that post and they Associated here together you can't go down and meet with Methodist you have no fellowship with them the Baptists no you go talking about speaking in tongues and the baptism in Jesus name they kick you out that quick you see that's right you sit around there you would be like a dove Among Us a bunch of crow crows you would have no fellowship at all you would die I ain't making fun of Methodist and Baptist now remember that I am not saying that I'm just drawing a comparison there are many Methodist and Baptist are good man godly man but I'm talking about the fellowship so he says you can't fellowship with someone and unless you believe what they believe you can't now go and team up with Pentecostals Baptists and and some Methodist and say us begin a fellowship Fellowship on on the basis of what you see there is brother he says there okay he calls another brother back there tonight an evangelist sitting back there brother JT panel brother Baer believe this brother sitting here some many of you here are men of God calling in your life you can be doing something just don't sit around don't sit around let's do something amen the problem with us in the message we sit around we don't do something we don't have the fire for spreading this message he said let's do something you don't get one Soul saved get that one saved each one of us now I think this church if you men would when you build this church men like this he says when you build this church make this like your headquarters okay he's talking about these brothers he mentioned name one by one by one these are brothers who have been in the church is okay if I come back here is maybe you like brother IRAs brother an Brother Martin brother so and so you know you are men of God he's talking about the preachers right and he says you see now you've gone out there you do something do something there do something there do something and then the church has expanded all right now we have all the other small churches out of it he says now make this one here like your headquarter now he's talking about the local Fellowship the local church where these ones came from you see he talking about pedigree really each of you should have should be able to say here is where I was birthed here is where my Ministry started from but a quarter of ministers in the message will be able to know who their fathers are in the Lord if you ask them many of them who is your father in the Lord they would don't even want to say no leave leave him alone all I know that God called me God called you you cannot remove the man God used a man there is a man that God used who is he the one that impacted your life the one that that God used for you to realize that you even had a calling in your life for Ministry you see and sometimes you get a question that you you can't discuss and it says so you Brothers he talking about all these brothers you go out there and now you make this one like your headquarter and like brother NE here being like the senior Elder among you now the pastor of the local of the local the local church which he said now you can make like the headquarter he says he's the like the senior Elder among you and sometimes you get a question that you can't discuss out with your church out there bring it here to brother Neville okay and you all it together if you can't come you remember now when he said that these ones they still come back to the bishop the Elder this is what he meant you have like questions you can't discuss things you don't understand okay bring it now to your local Elder okay if you can't come to any decision I'll be coming right pretty soon then we will all have then we'll all come together with it and then in there get training in your own groups other ministers men that you see that has ACC calling in their life for the ministry train them younger men bring them in here to the Elder okay so you see other men out in those other groups they're coming up you need to train them also bring them now to the Elder don't just say okay now I've also got my kingdom we are not raising kingdoms we are raising the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord now I'm a pastor of my own I don't even need to look up who who who right now recently I was talking to uh a brother one of my sons in the Lord I don't know if that's the word to say in Ethiopia he's a pastor many of you know him brother Ephraim so he's doing a great great work in one of the regions in Ethiopia so he um several especially this past several weeks a few men of God have been contacting me these are Bishops now if he's a bishop you understand what it means he's a man of a great big group and you know he served God for a long long time and so um they've been contacting me some of them he has baptized so far two Bishops in the denominational world and one of them was in Russia and he contacted me he said I'm I'm in Russia do we have Believers here he said my name is so and so H uh he said Apostle ephra has contacted me with you he said you are his Pastor you know because you see brother Ephraim is calling him an apostle but you see he's been taught well he understands look as much as this man is looking at me as his Apostle I've presented a message to him but I also have to connect him with my pastor so he can know more of the message and this man is is in Russia I told him oh you're in Russia I called I called up the brother the pastor is a pastor in Russia his name is um uh uh I don't I don't remember the name I'm sorry but you see um he had um uh I met him I met him when I was in um Germany so he's a very good brother powerful testimony and so they're doing a great work in Russia so I connected him over with him and probably they will be able to meet and I've never met the man myself but you see he wrote me a message he says I desire to meet you I desire to meet you so you see this this is how God works he says you see um get training in your own groups and other ministers men that you see has ACC calling in their life for the ministry train them youngen bring them in here to the Elder all of you sit together in a ministerial meeting and there teach the deeper things of God don't go on to the bad end keep someone who can have confidence in to be kind of a leader a leader for you so we must always have leaders we are not leaderless we may not be a denomination but we are not leaderless Hal hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and then sometimes if you don't see it just exactly the way he does goes the goes that's all right you in the faith anyhow just move along maybe when he come together then all of us together we pray the designment of God come down and he will give it just exactly what it is you see and let us know just how to do yet and it says and in there churches can go here and training up a group of men and if I'm an Evangelistic if I'm in Evangelistic work somewhere there is places I can place them worldwide brother bam now here is a prophet is saying I have places worldwide I can send those men if you give it to me I can always send them go here go there go there go there go there like I sent this brother over to a brother in Russia said go meet him you see so this is how God works Jesus Christ is the bishop of our souls but then you see he has men that he uses Among Us and he uses them for what if you remember in the book of Ephesian 4 he says what what what is the fivefold ministry for I think we can finish with that read Ephesians chapter 4 it says for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry vers 12 for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God andto the perfect man andto the measure of the stat of the fullness of Christ praise the name of the Lord amen and so this last beat in the message teing heads with Jesus I've not read it for us because we've not grown to that level yet I've really read it for the other people who had questions and um but of course it's also good for our understanding and to know how the order of the church is and um this um you find that churches especially in um Congo in sorry in Zimbabwe they have been well out and you find the churches are in order they they understand how things move they they will always honor the elders they will always you know submit to the elders even when the Elder makes a mistake you won't find one Minister you know pointing out imagine me standing here on the pulpit and calling out a minister and rebuking him openly and even calling out his name it is ridiculous you see what Young ministers can do but we thank God that he has given us councel from the message of the hour and that we stand we stand on because it's the food for our souls you may stand on your feet God bless you praise the Lord how many love the message of the hour amen amen we thank God for the message because by that we live by that we know who we are amen and by that we can grow and can edify Our Generation friends there's a lot that we need to do before we go in prayer I just wanted to let you know uh of um the vision that the lord gave me for a fellowship that I shared with you on Sunday I'm waiting on this Friday we are going to meet with the brothers that are going to be helping I've already invited them uh we're going to meet here at church at 5:00 p.m. with those brothers and the purpose will be to EST to talk about what we are intending to do but we are intending to have those different fellowships if you like to call them that or sales in our different areas and I believe it will achieve a lot achieve a lot achieve a lot and in in reaching out to our society ities and sending the message out and um you know even edifying the Believers who are in those areas so let's just pray our precious Heavenly Father we thank you so much Lord for everyone who has been under the sound of my voice we thank you for your grace we thank you for the love and the understanding you have given to us in this knowledge of the message of the hour father Lord we now can be able to speak with boldness that we we have Jesus Christ as the bishop of our souls but Lord we know that he has sent he the bishop of our souls has sent some men some Apostles others pastors others teachers you know and and and all these men of God that he has sent Elders in every church and for the edifying of the church for the church to grow in the knowledge of Jesus Christ Lord we needed to know these things so that we can be able to know how to handle ourselves and many times we find that especially younger ministers getting it wrong and getting overly excited and doing things wrong but I pray that you will give Grace To Our Generation Lord that we will know what to do how to do it how to approach things and how to be respectable to our elders and how to uh to please you in everything that we do because at the end of the day you alone take all the glory take all the honor you deserve it father Lord we thank you so much I pray that a blessing of God upon each person who has been here those who have been online as they go back to their homes Lord that you will
