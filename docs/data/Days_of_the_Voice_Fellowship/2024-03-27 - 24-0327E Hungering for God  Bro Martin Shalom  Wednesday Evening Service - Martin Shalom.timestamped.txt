[33:53] righteousness what is the opposite of
[33:55] blessing the opposite is cast
[33:58] so if you don't thirst and if you don't
[34:01] hunger for righteousness then you are
[34:04] casted blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:07] amen this happen even to
[34:12] non-christians you find them looking for
[34:17] happiness what make them looking or go
[34:20] looking for that happiness it is because
[34:22] of the hunger they have in their heart
[34:25] for those things and now Prophet tells
[34:28] us that is the real right hunger but
[34:32] being perverted of the devil amen that
[34:36] man is made in the way that inside his
[34:39] heart he has to worship amen so there is
[34:45] a versum in his
[34:47] heart which that verum what can quench
[34:50] that versum what can fill that Gap is
[34:54] only God and God alone but that devil
[34:58] divert that hunger and you find someone
[35:02] go
[35:03] drink that he won't forget his problem
[35:06] he won't forget his sorrow and then
[35:11] after being drunk for just some few
[35:16] hours he will pretend that has forgotten
[35:18] the sorrow but I've ever found drunkard
[35:21] men crying
[35:23] again not tears of joy that today I'm so
[35:26] drunk that I'm so
[35:28] happy but regardless of that drunkenness
[35:33] still they remember their sorrow and
[35:36] they find them
[35:37] crying maybe because they have been
[35:40] because uh they've been drinking that's
[35:43] why uh their marriage broke and now the
[35:47] man has remembered the time he used to
[35:49] have at home the fellowship with the
[35:51] family and you find the man crying
[35:54] blessed be the name of the Lord so the
[35:56] same thing we are living in the time
[35:59] where there is a lot of things there are
[36:02] many things that try that we are
[36:05] substituting with the hunger for
[36:07] God because we must and we must have
[36:11] hunger for God when a Christians is
[36:14] having conviction when we have Godly
[36:17] conviction in our heart it will always
[36:19] drive us toward
[36:21] righteousness because the Bible tells us
[36:24] that we should be holy be holy because
[36:28] your father in Heaven is Holy so Godly
[36:32] hunger will always drive us toward
[36:36] Holiness amen because when we Are Holy
[36:40] not having our own Holiness but God's
[36:42] holiness God is happy with us amen that
[36:47] is the reason Jesus came Jesus never
[36:50] came that we should remain in our sin in
[36:52] our bondage in our shame but Jesus came
[36:56] to set us free from the bondage of sin
[37:01] amen so we ought to be free people we
[37:04] ought to be people who are hungering and
[37:07] thirsting for God last Friday we talk
[37:09] about the soul
[37:12] travail and if you look at this is
[37:14] almost the same thing but just in
[37:17] another Direction amen blessed be the
[37:21] name of the
[37:23] Lord blessed are they uh blessed are the
[37:28] uh blessed are the pure in heart for
[37:31] they shall see God Purity in heart does
[37:34] not just come from
[37:36] nowhere but the hunger of God purifieth
[37:40] our soul blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:44] when we are hungering for God we will be
[37:46] conscious of our sins amen the hunger
[37:49] for God makes a Christian to acknowledge
[37:53] his sins and when we acknowledge our
[37:56] sins
[37:58] we
[37:59] repent we confess them amen
[38:03] acknowledgement of our sin this where we
[38:05] look at ourself we look how short we are
[38:09] how belit we are before God Amen this is
[38:13] when we are seeing what God did for us
[38:16] that we were
[38:18] undeserving blessed be the name of the
[38:20] Lord but
[38:21] God because of his Mercy when he thought
[38:26] of us he came down and redeemed us
[38:30] blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:39] amen praise the
[38:43] Lord hungering for
[38:50] God you can when you are hungering for
[38:54] God or when you are thirsting for God
[39:01] you will be in
[39:06] desperation and you find that
[39:09] uh you find very few Christian with that
[39:14] desperation the word is
[39:18] preached different means they will come
[39:20] and
[39:22] preach and you find you're not
[39:25] desperate but each each time God sends
[39:29] the message each time God sends the
[39:34] word God does not just
[39:36] move just
[39:39] anyhow amen but every time God sends a
[39:44] minister he has a
[39:47] reason he want to do something he's
[39:50] speaking to somebody is speaking to you
[39:53] and me
[39:55] amen and the word comes
[39:58] and sometime you find we are on tension
[40:00] we are on our
[40:01] toes but the following day the
[40:05] fire dies out why because we don't have
[40:10] that
[40:12] hunger we have to reach a point whereby
[40:14] each one of us we build our personal
[40:17] relationship with God we must be certain
[40:21] of God we are having Christian who are
[40:24] not certain of God
[40:28] amen they are not sure whether on the
[40:30] right whether they are believing the
[40:31] right message they're not sure whether
[40:33] they're going to heaven they're not sure
[40:35] whether they are Christian they're not
[40:37] sure whether they are
[40:39] Saint amen they are not even sure
[40:42] whether they're in a
[40:46] church and when you're not certain of
[40:49] God you can easily be deceived because
[40:52] you look at another organization and you
[40:55] will think that they're doing much
[40:56] better than you or us blessed be the
[41:00] name of the Lord amen but Jesus said
[41:04] blessed is the man who
[41:05] hungers and thirst for
[41:10] righteousness for they shall be filled
[41:13] without hunger you cannot be
[41:16] filled without hunger you cannot even
[41:18] cook food that mothers
[41:21] cannot if Mom is not hungry and the
[41:24] children are not hungry and Dad is not
[41:26] hungry do you think they will cook no
[41:30] they will
[41:34] not and God each time God comes he
[41:37] always comes to feed the hungry
[41:41] Souls
[41:45] amen there are people almost everywhere
[41:49] whose heart are all a
[41:52] flame what is that flame it is the
[41:55] hunger amen
[41:58] those men and women were hungering for
[42:01] God that's why their hearts were on
[42:04] fire it was bubbling in their soul they
[42:09] were hungering that's why time came when
[42:12] they were threatened and they were kind
[42:14] of losing their morale the Bible says
[42:17] they went and gathered in one of the
[42:19] brothers house and they locked thems
[42:21] there and they
[42:23] prayed and they were rilled again
[42:28] blessed be the name of the
[42:30] Lord when you see things are not moving
[42:33] when you see that you're are not
[42:34] hungering for God you need to go into
[42:38] the
[42:41] closet blessed be the name of the
[42:47] Lord the prophet refers as as
[42:51] iglet he said God is the mother
[42:53] ego and when an ego get when the ego
[42:58] uh get old it goes in the
[43:02] rocks and it revive it
[43:07] strength Christian we must have
[43:09] questions we must be questioning our
[43:13] lives because this is the body of Christ
[43:16] is a healthy
[43:19] body and a healthy body must grow
[43:23] spiritually because we are talking about
[43:25] spiritual matters
[43:28] amen we know ourselves we know whether
[43:31] we are overcoming or whether we are
[43:33] being defeated blessed be the name of
[43:36] the
[43:37] Lord We complain about business and
[43:41] tiredness but that is
[43:44] typically a
[43:46] spiritual
[43:48] problem more than a problem of
[43:54] schedule because you'll find that in
[43:57] such a case where we are Desiring you
[44:00] are Desiring other things more than God
[44:03] but you are saying you are busy you
[44:07] see blessed be the name of the Lord I'm
[44:10] not talking about hunger and thirsting
[44:11] for busyness or our own personal things
[44:15] but we are hungering and thirsting for
[44:20] God because after hipping
[44:24] all it's God that matters
[44:27] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[44:29] that's why Jesus says that what will
[44:31] benefit a man to eat the whole
[44:34] world and by the end of the day you lose
[44:38] your soul blessed be the name of the
[44:40] Lord only the hungry all only the people
[44:43] who are hungering for
[44:44] God or are thirsting after righteousness
[44:48] they are the only people who are filled
[44:51] with the Holy
[44:56] Spirit blessed be the name of the
[44:59] Lord Jesus says in John
[45:02] 4:14 whosoever drinketh of the water I
[45:05] give him will never thirst indeed the
[45:09] water I give him will become in him a
[45:13] spring of water welling up to eternal
[45:19] life when Jesus gives you that
[45:24] water you will not thirst for something
[45:27] else but to be thirsting and hungering
[45:31] for God and in John 6:35 is then Jesus
[45:35] declared I am the bread of life which uh
[45:39] I'm the bread of life who came who
[45:42] comes whosoever comes to me will never
[45:45] go
[45:49] hungry and whosoever Believes In Me will
[45:52] never be
[45:55] thirsty
[45:58] and
[46:00] remember uh the Bible says in John
[46:03] 3:37 that on the last on the last and
[46:07] greatest day of the feast Jesus stood
[46:10] and said in loud voice if any man if
[46:14] anyone is thirsty let him come to me and
[46:18] drink whosoever Believes In Me as the
[46:21] scripture has said streams of Living
[46:25] Water will flow from within him blessed
[46:29] be the name of the Lord
[46:39] amen you know as the days um as the
[46:44] years are going by as approaching the
[46:48] coming of the
[46:51] Lord the way is getting narrow and
[46:55] narrower blessed be the name of the
[46:58] Lord and that's why you find that uh you
[47:01] Ed not to struggle to some
[47:04] extent but somehow today somewhere
[47:07] somehow you are
[47:10] struggling things are getting
[47:15] worse but Abraham in the message the
[47:17] world is falling apart it says
[47:18] everything is
[47:20] crumbling nations are breaking politics
[47:24] is crumbling churches are crumbling
[47:27] amen look at the Pentecostal
[47:31] World
[47:34] sometime maybe like in the YouTube you
[47:37] go and see what is happening there they
[47:40] are fighting one
[47:44] another there is no life
[47:48] there and we say in the message the life
[47:51] is in the seed which is true but if the
[47:55] life is the seed
[47:58] that seed must be
[48:00] identified
[48:04] amen you must be having a sign of Life
[48:08] inside you in whatever we do in our
[48:12] daily life the life of Christ must be
[48:15] manifested in US amen and how are we
[48:19] going to see these are things which are
[48:21] not just going to presume about or think
[48:24] about it but this are the things which
[48:27] must be
[48:29] manifested when Brother s is hungering
[48:32] for God He will always be here
[48:37] amen you will not force him as far as
[48:40] serving God is
[48:44] concerned his way of worshiping will
[48:48] exchange blessed be the name of the
[48:53] Lord because we have got the full
[48:56] package of the
[48:58] hour and we are not just running
[49:02] anyhow like Apostle Paul say that we are
[49:05] not Bo like people are boxing air we
[49:08] know what we are talking
[49:10] about when comes the Holy Spirit you
[49:14] know what you're talking about you know
[49:16] who he is that the Holy Ghost this is
[49:19] the passion of Jesus Christ in The
[49:22] Believer blessed be the name of the Lord
[49:26] other think that the Holy Ghost is
[49:28] speaking in tongues you know much much
[49:31] better than
[49:32] them others think that the Holy Ghost is
[49:36] casting out
[49:39] demons others think that the Holy Ghost
[49:42] is praying and you
[49:43] cry but we are the people who know that
[49:47] when it comes the Holy Ghost we know who
[49:50] he is amen we know what he does when he
[49:54] comes and we know how how to get him we
[49:58] know how to approach God blessed be the
[50:01] name of the Lord
[50:08] amen where is that
[50:11] hunger I remember one time we talked
[50:13] about returning to the first
[50:16] love brother it is the first love which
[50:19] will give us
[50:21] Victory because all of us when we had
[50:23] just
[50:24] believed we were too
[50:27] us amen and God was
[50:32] happy and brother tells us that the
[50:35] early church is the
[50:39] pattern this message the coming of
[50:42] Malachi for is to restore us
[50:45] back to the apostles amen restoring back
[50:51] is all not only the word the
[50:55] power
[50:57] the glory of God the Holy Ghost amen
[51:01] because we run without the word we in
[51:04] denomination without the word and we
[51:08] were seeking God not knowing that we had
[51:10] left him in the word blessed be the name
[51:13] of the Lord we were holding men's
[51:20] tradition yet God is in his word but
[51:25] when the prophet came
[51:27] he told us Jesus Christ is the same
[51:29] yesterday today and
[51:31] forever and himself says that the church
[51:34] the pattern it is the book of
[51:38] Acts but if you look at ourself people
[51:41] who are waiting for the
[51:43] rupture and we look at ourself with the
[51:47] book of Acts or the Acts of the
[51:52] Apostles if you wear yourself because
[51:55] the Bible tells us we should make our
[51:58] calling and election
[52:00] sure each one of us will know this
[52:06] amen so my brothers my
[52:12] sisters what
[52:14] happened and what went
[52:18] wrong blessed be the name of the
[52:25] Lord David says in Psalms chapter 63: 1
[52:30] that oh God you are my God honestly I
[52:34] Seek You My Soul thirst for you my body
[52:39] Longs for you in a dry and we land where
[52:46] there is no
[52:48] water
[52:51] amen honestly will I Seek You When David
[52:55] lost the joy of salvation
[52:57] we are seeing David in Psalms 51 crying
[53:00] oh God restore unto me the joy of my
[53:02] salvation the joy of my salvation the
[53:05] joy of our Salvation is the fuel which
[53:08] keeps the believer to
[53:11] move because without that but what I'm
[53:15] say that when a child of God
[53:18] backslide is not lost but you lose the
[53:22] joy of your
[53:23] salvation you become dry you become
[53:28] Canal when a Believer is living in sin
[53:32] he becomes
[53:34] Canal what happened that Veil moves
[53:39] away and then you remain dry when you
[53:42] come to
[53:45] church 30 minutes you'll be checking on
[53:48] your
[53:50] watch you'll be so anxious of the
[53:52] incoming messages in your
[53:54] phone why because you you lost the joy
[53:57] of
[54:01] Salvation yes
[54:02] sir when the minister is preaching it's
[54:06] like you feel it's taking long we know
[54:09] these things even I was reading that
[54:11] message the other day you see it's
[54:14] because that Joy is not there but get my
[54:18] brother amen get my man or woman who is
[54:22] hungering for God Amen whose hearts are
[54:28] bubbling it will be different story even
[54:31] when you have only two or five in the
[54:33] church the church it will be like the
[54:36] church is parked with hundreds of them
[54:38] blessed be the name of the
[54:40] Lord so my brother my sister if there is
[54:43] something that we need to we need money
[54:45] and other things that is okay but let
[54:49] God give us that hunger in our
[54:53] heart God F me
[54:58] God cleanse me
[55:01] amen God bend me mold me that should be
[55:06] our
[55:08] prayer shape me after your own image
[55:12] blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:15] amen blessed are the poor in spirit for
[55:19] there is the Kingdom of
[55:22] Heaven others mistake this scripture and
[55:25] they think that when you are poor person
[55:27] you are
[55:28] spiritual and sometime they even quote
[55:30] this scripture but say bless are the
[55:32] poor in
[55:34] spirit blessed be the name of the
[55:40] Lord what is the best
[55:42] way of learning
[55:46] prayer It Is by
[55:48] praying
[55:50] amen the best way to learn how to pray
[55:54] is by
[55:55] praying
[55:58] we go before
[56:00] God God give us that
[56:04] burden there are time we say that
[56:06] without the without the birth pain the
[56:08] baby cannot be
[56:10] born and we are carrying the
[56:13] womb we are cutting the seed in us and
[56:17] the Bible tells us as was in the days of
[56:19] Jo uh in the days of Lord as was the
[56:22] days of his first shall it be in his
[56:24] second coming and we seeing this first
[56:26] in first coming the word put on flesh
[56:29] the word became
[56:30] flesh and was manifested Among Us amen
[56:35] and Jesus say as it was in his first
[56:38] coming shall it be in his second coming
[56:41] this same word is putting on flesh again
[56:46] amen and you and me God is being
[56:49] tabernacled in US blessed be the name of
[56:53] the Lord amen
[57:03] he says that whether that how much we
[57:06] pray that I think finally the matter of
[57:09] appetite of hunger for God and all that
[57:12] he is and desire we have plenty of
[57:17] food could it be that the church is the
[57:21] pool of
[57:22] laia the church has backslide and lost
[57:26] their hunger for
[57:30] God we are not going with the flow of
[57:33] the age we need back God in fact we need
[57:38] back God back in his
[57:46] church blessed be the name of the
[57:51] Lord the church has backslide and lost
[57:55] their hunger for God
[57:56] and that is a very very dangerous
[58:01] State praise be to
[58:04] God may God give us that
[58:08] anger because if we lose it we are
[58:13] gone what has kept us moving what has
[58:17] kept me moving for all these years know
[58:20] that I don't make
[58:21] mistakes mistakes will be there but
[58:25] inside your heart
[58:27] something will tell you you can make it
[58:31] try again press on Amen and then you get
[58:34] encouraged and you rise up again and you
[58:38] keep moving on what has kept us moving
[58:41] for this time it is the grace of God
[58:45] that hunger of God in our heart and we
[58:48] should not allow that to
[58:51] die Believers you ought to have appetite
[58:54] for word 24/7
[58:57] because the moment the devil takes that
[58:59] away you are
[59:02] gone
[59:06] amen and only what can kill our appetite
[59:10] what can kill that hunger is the things
[59:12] of the
[59:15] world you see nowadays you don't need to
[59:17] go in the
[59:21] streets and do something weird maybe see
[59:25] naked women
[59:29] you can even just through your your
[59:32] phones and
[59:34] computers the devil has brought it close
[59:37] to
[59:39] you and if there is something that is
[59:41] keeping us busy so much busy is the
[59:45] gagets around
[59:47] us and sometimes it's very hard it is
[59:50] very hard even to
[59:52] realize the way I always weigh it how
[59:55] much time time do I spend with my phone
[59:58] and how much time do I spend reading the
[1:00:00] Bible and how much time do I spend in
[1:00:02] prayer that's the only way you can
[1:00:04] balance
[1:00:06] that you say you know I'm doing business
[1:00:09] yeah it's okay to do business online it
[1:00:12] is
[1:00:13] okay but after you are done with your
[1:00:19] business uhhuh then get your
[1:00:23] timetable for the whole week
[1:00:26] for how
[1:00:27] long and that can
[1:00:30] tell blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:00:34] get someone who's hunger
[1:00:37] okay physical
[1:00:40] hunger a child can even fall in the S
[1:00:45] span because of
[1:00:47] hunger sometime at home I see my wife
[1:00:51] when the baby's hungry she comes and gra
[1:00:53] and grabs here Mommy food this one grabs
[1:00:56] here it's because that kid is
[1:00:58] hungry the body is demanding for food
[1:01:03] amen and physical things and spiritual
[1:01:06] things they are just the
[1:01:12] same you cannot tell us that you are
[1:01:14] hungering for God you are waiting for
[1:01:16] the Rapture and you're not minding about
[1:01:19] your
[1:01:20] soul you come to church
[1:01:24] occasionally you don't know that because
[1:01:27] if you're hungering for God you will try
[1:01:30] your best
[1:01:34] that you reach there very
[1:01:39] early you will come singing Praise
[1:01:43] amen there are some people who come to
[1:01:46] church they come watching their staffs
