[1:27:39] is
[1:27:41] better and the whole earth was of one
[1:27:44] language and of one speech and it came
[1:27:46] to pass as they journeyed from the East
[1:27:49] that they that they found a plane in the
[1:27:52] land of sha and dwelt there and they
[1:27:56] said one to
[1:27:58] another go to let us make a brick and
[1:28:01] burn them thoroughly and they had and

[1:28:18] whose top May reach unto heaven and let
[1:28:21] us make us a name lest will be scattered
[1:28:25] abroad and the face of the whole
[1:28:28] earth and the Lord came down to the to
[1:28:30] see the city and the tower which the
[1:28:33] children of men
[1:28:34] builded and the Lord said because the
[1:28:37] people is one and they have all one
[1:28:40] language and this they begin to do and
[1:28:43] now nothing will be restrained from them
[1:28:46] which they have imagined to do may the
[1:28:51] Lord add blessings upon the word you may

[1:36:21] service
[1:36:25] we usually have a Wednesday service on
[1:36:27] the
[1:36:29] evening but this is going to be 25th
[1:36:36] December and so I would want to give you
[1:36:39] my Christmas message
[1:36:43] then on that day of
[1:36:47] 25th um let's
[1:36:50] see how many can say we can be here
[1:36:53] early in the morning and we have a
[1:36:54] morning
[1:36:57] service how many say well would like to
[1:37:00] be here in the evening and we have an
[1:37:02] evening
[1:37:05] service no many of you are not raising

[1:37:18] problem they even say it's 25th it's
[1:37:21] Christmas Day
[1:37:24] oh for us we should not even go to
[1:37:26] church even some of them they decide to
[1:37:28] eat
[1:37:30] doo at DF we don't believe
[1:37:33] that that's a religious
[1:37:36] spirit brother bam did not eat doo on
[1:37:40] Christmas is our
[1:37:43] example in this
[1:37:45] generation amen he even decorated his
[1:37:50] house he even had a Christmas tree
[1:37:55] do you do you believe that brother was
[1:37:58] Elijah so don't be more more ho than
[1:38:02] your
[1:38:04] Prophet so if the world is doing all the
[1:38:08] Santa
[1:38:11] Claus wearing those things and you know
[1:38:14] they call him father Chan
[1:38:16] chras for us we don't believe in that in
[1:38:19] that in those things we don't believe in
[1:38:21] those that's a religious of
[1:38:25] deception we also know Jesus was not
[1:38:28] born on
[1:38:30] 25th but there is no
[1:38:32] harm in coming to
[1:38:36] worship the Jesus will
[1:38:39] know amen so um uh we will be here

[1:46:29] to be headed
[1:46:34] to in we have some baptisms to
[1:46:41] do
[1:46:43] today um at around we have made an
[1:46:46] appointment with them for around 3
[1:46:48] onwards p.m.
[1:46:53] so as you can see there's quite a lot to
[1:46:56] do so if you have sent me a message or
[1:46:58] called me and have not answered it's
[1:47:00] quite a lot to
[1:47:04] do and they pray for us because there's
[1:47:07] a lot to
[1:47:08] do um and lastly I have many
[1:47:11] announcements this
[1:47:15] morning
[1:47:18] um we have made a payment
[1:47:23] the initial
[1:47:25] payment for the fellowship place
[1:47:33] in
[1:47:34] um and i' I've made that payment by
[1:47:39] faith believing that you will step in
[1:47:43] and and and and
[1:47:47] support um you know when a fellowship is
[1:47:49] starting
[1:47:53] uh we can always
[1:47:56] support uh but not
[1:47:59] permanently because we are not building
[1:48:01] a
[1:48:03] denomination the people
[1:48:05] there will have also to chip in and
[1:48:09] support their own
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:12] work but you see there many of them are
[1:48:14] young in the
[1:48:17] faith and we need to support them in the
[1:48:21] beginning we shall collect an
[1:48:24] offering at the end of the
[1:48:27] service if you have a burden to support
[1:48:30] that
[1:48:31] work and be a part of that
[1:48:34] blessing so a month is 300,000
[1:48:39] Shillings and we'll need also to buy a
[1:48:42] few things like
[1:48:45] chairs uh Sister Rose you are the one
[1:48:47] who bought most of these chairs how much
[1:48:49] is the chair
[1:48:55] okay 28
[1:48:59] 25 so if you want to buy a chair two or
[1:49:03] five we are looking at buying at least
[1:49:05] 30 to 50
[1:49:07] chairs for the
[1:49:09] start and so these are the
[1:49:11] needs may God lead you as you think on
[1:49:14] how you will
[1:49:17] give brother lumu I'm happy to see
[1:49:20] you God bless you and all the saints
[1:49:23] visiting with us this
[1:49:25] morning amen so I'm
[1:49:29] tired I don't know how I preach when I'm
[1:49:33] tired but if you pull on the
[1:49:36] word ah God will speak to
[1:49:39] you
[1:49:41] amen are you expectant this
[1:49:44] morning are you happy this
[1:49:47] morning oh your happiness is very low
[1:49:49] are you happy this
[1:49:51] morning amen I'm going to speak on a
[1:49:54] very important
[1:49:58] subject um it's a something that has
[1:50:02] been on my heart but you know it came up
[1:50:04] when I was having a conversation with uh
[1:50:08] Pastor
[1:50:13] Gideon speaking in the
[1:50:16] car usually when I'm speaking with
[1:50:18] brothers sisters I kind of you know get
[1:50:21] inspirations
[1:50:26] and so I got this and I pray that the
[1:50:28] Lord will use it to bless
[1:50:31] us especially at the ending of this year
[1:50:34] and the beginning of the new
[1:50:37] year I'm going to speak on the unity of
[1:50:48] purpose the unity of purpose
[1:50:53] tell your neighbor the unity of
[1:50:57] purpose I know part of the uh um sister
[1:51:03] Stella and her two sons I think they are
[1:51:05] also in
[1:51:08] Kenya they informed me they went there
[1:51:10] for family I think wedding or
[1:51:15] something so I'm going to speak on the
[1:51:17] unity of
[1:51:21] purpose the unity of
[1:51:24] purpose shall we go back again to the
[1:51:26] place where we read in Genesis
[1:51:30] 11 and the whole earth was one
[1:51:33] language and one
[1:51:36] speech and it came to pass as the Jed
[1:51:38] from the
[1:51:40] East they found a
[1:51:44] plane praise the
[1:51:46] Lord they found a plane in the land of
[1:51:51] sha and they
[1:51:53] there now you have to remember that this
[1:51:55] is After the
[1:51:59] flood so these people boundled
[1:52:01] themselves together in this
[1:52:03] place and they dwelt in this place and
[1:52:07] they said one to
[1:52:09] another go to let us make
[1:52:12] brick and burn them
[1:52:15] thoroughly and they had brick for
[1:52:19] stone and they had slime for Mot
[1:52:25] that is in vers
[1:52:38] three and so they said now let us build
[1:52:41] a city and a
[1:52:44] tower whose to May reach unto
[1:52:49] Heaven listen listen please listen to me
[1:52:51] now I you want you to bring all your
[1:52:53] thoughts together we just get into the
[1:52:56] word you know the good thing in the
[1:52:58] message we don't excite people by
[1:53:00] hallelujah praise God we we are excited
[1:53:03] by the
[1:53:06] word amen so put in your heart let us
[1:53:10] see what the Lord has for us this
[1:53:12] morning and so they said let us make a
[1:53:16] name Les we be scattered abroad and face
[1:53:19] the abroad upon the face of the whole
[1:53:21] Earth
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:25] so they didn't want to spread themselves
[1:53:27] across the whole
[1:53:29] earth and you know God came
[1:53:33] down to see the city they had built and
[1:53:36] the
[1:53:38] Tower and the Lord said behold the
[1:53:40] people is
[1:53:42] one I want you to hear what God's
[1:53:44] testimony was about
[1:53:47] people he said now the people are
[1:53:50] one they have all one language
[1:53:55] and this they begin to
[1:53:58] do nothing will be restrained from
[1:54:03] them which they have imagined to
[1:54:08] do do you believe God's
[1:54:11] testimony brother brother shame if you
[1:54:13] can give me more sound not louder but a
[1:54:18] little heavier if you can please thank
[1:54:19] you so you see that you know God gave a
[1:54:23] testimony that these people cannot be
[1:54:28] restrained do you remember the sermon
[1:54:30] brother Michael preached here some years
[1:54:34] ago unrestrained
[1:54:39] generation you see you know we are the
[1:54:42] unrestrained
[1:54:44] generation the devil cannot restrain
[1:54:47] us the devil cannot hinder
[1:54:49] us if we have a vision and we start on
[1:54:54] it the devil cannot hind
[1:54:57] us but now these people
[1:55:00] here God said they cannot be
[1:55:06] restrained whatever they have imagined
[1:55:08] to
[1:55:09] do they are going to do that was God's
[1:55:14] testimony and these people's plans
[1:55:18] was to build a strong and defensible
[1:55:25] City their plan was to build a massive
[1:55:30] Tower in the
[1:55:33] city and that Tower was supposed to
[1:55:36] reach the
[1:55:39] heavens and also their plan
[1:55:42] was to make a
[1:55:45] name for
[1:55:48] themselves wow sounded like a big plan
[1:55:50] right
[1:55:52] and also their plan was to keep
[1:55:55] themselves
[1:55:57] together now there are many many
[1:55:59] approaches you can have on this Tower of
[1:56:01] bab but today I want to take one of the
[1:56:03] unity of
[1:56:12] purpose there is something that these
[1:56:14] people
[1:56:16] had that many Believers don't have
[1:56:22] there is something that these people had
[1:56:24] and God testified that they had
[1:56:29] it many families don't have
[1:56:32] it many churches don't have
[1:56:35] it many nations don't have
[1:56:39] it and that's why they are divided and
[1:56:42] they
[1:56:45] fall there is something about Unity of
[1:56:48] purpose
[1:56:53] when you have Unity your
[1:56:56] purpose whatever your vision
[1:57:00] is whatever you have set out to
[1:57:04] do it cannot be
[1:57:08] restrained but the problem that we have
[1:57:11] is many people do not have Unity or
[1:57:16] purpose but you see these people's Unity
[1:57:20] of purpose
[1:57:24] was not within God's
[1:57:27] will you know what was God's
[1:57:30] will I want you to look at Genesis 1:
[1:57:37] 28
[1:57:39] 28 I will I shall read it in the
[1:57:41] Amplified
[1:57:42] version it says and God blessed
[1:57:47] them granting them certain Authority
[1:57:52] and he said to them now are you
[1:57:55] following
[1:57:56] me are you following me this
[1:58:06] side the end there has not hit you so
[1:58:10] much
[1:58:11] power I want you to
[1:58:15] be so that I may preach to you the
[1:58:18] word don't make me sleep
[1:58:22] tell your neighbor don't make the pastor
[1:58:24] to
[1:58:26] sleep praise the Lord amen praise the
[1:58:30] Lord amen okay thank you brother that
[1:58:33] that's good yes
[1:58:37] okay God granted them certain
[1:58:41] Authority God has granted us certain
[1:58:46] Authority on this
[1:58:48] earth now we can do many things
[1:58:52] but if we are not walking within the
[1:58:54] authority of
[1:58:56] God we will never accomplish
[1:59:00] anything we will walk
[1:59:04] uncertainly and we will not be
[1:59:06] prosperous in our
[1:59:09] endeavors but you see the Bible says God
[1:59:11] blessed
[1:59:13] them God gave granted them certain
[1:59:17] Authority and he said to
[1:59:19] them be fruitful
[1:59:24] multiply and fill the
[1:59:27] Earth F the
[1:59:29] Earth everyone say fill the
[1:59:33] Earth so God's
[1:59:35] purpose was that the people will F the
[1:59:40] whole but this people's
[1:59:44] motive was to keep themselves to one
[1:59:49] place so they can make a name for thems
[1:59:53] so they can keep themselves together in
[1:59:55] one
[1:59:56] place so they can build a massive
[2:00:00] Tower and they would be
[2:00:03] strong and
[2:00:05] defensible but you see what when God
[2:00:07] looked at that he said this is not my
[2:00:10] purpose for
[2:00:13] man
[2:00:15] immediately came down and changed the
[2:00:17] whole
[2:00:18] thing these people were speaking the
[2:00:20] same language
[2:00:22] these people had the same
[2:00:25] speech but you know when God came down
[2:00:28] you know he changed
[2:00:30] everything don't ever think you are too
[2:00:32] powerful that God can't change
[2:00:36] you you cannot Prosper because of your
[2:00:38] own
[2:00:40] power you cannot Prosper because of your
[2:00:42] own knowledge and
[2:00:44] wisdom you have to submit yourself to
[2:00:46] the plan that God has already set for
[2:00:48] you
[2:00:52] you do that and you are in the unity of
[2:00:56] Purpose with others together oh you can
[2:01:01] accomplish what no one has ever
[2:01:06] accomplished I believe I am looking at
[2:01:08] some people
[2:01:10] here not everyone but I'm looking at
[2:01:13] some people
[2:01:14] here that are going to
[2:01:17] accomplish what no one has ever
[2:01:20] accomplished I am looking at some people
[2:01:23] here who will invent
[2:01:26] things no one has ever
[2:01:29] invented I am looking at some people
[2:01:31] here who go to certain
[2:01:34] Heights in their life amen that no one
[2:01:39] has ever
[2:01:40] attained I believe I'm the only me in
[2:01:43] the
[2:01:44] world and I believe I have an
[2:01:48] ability from the authority of God
[2:01:52] he said go be
[2:01:55] fruitful
[2:01:57] multiply the
[2:02:02] subjugate I am here to do just
[2:02:06] that I am looking at people that will
[2:02:09] attain certain
[2:02:13] Milestones that the world has never
[2:02:19] seen amen that is that SA the
[2:02:24] word as long as we are walking in God's
[2:02:28] will we are more than
[2:02:32] able tell your neighbor we are more than
[2:02:36] able I am looking at
[2:02:39] people who will accomplish
[2:02:42] things that no one has accomplished in
[2:02:44] their
[2:02:47] family hallelujah amen where they say no
[2:02:50] one buys a kind in our
[2:02:53] family I'm looking at someone who will
[2:02:56] accomplish
[2:02:58] that and will buy a car and everyone in
[2:03:02] your family will be
[2:03:05] surprised no one has ever built a
[2:03:07] home in your family in your family but
[2:03:12] it is possible for
[2:03:13] you now think about something in your
[2:03:17] family that your father failed to do
[2:03:20] your father's father to
[2:03:22] do and then many times we begin to think
[2:03:26] even me I
[2:03:28] can't I stopped reasoning like that
[2:03:31] many I started reasoning like this I am
[2:03:35] a special
[2:03:37] person the Bible told me that the Bible
[2:03:40] says you are a royal
[2:03:43] priesthood you are a peculiar
[2:03:46] people meaning I am
[2:03:49] different I am not common I am not
[2:03:53] I am here in this world to start a new
[2:03:57] generation which will do
[2:04:01] exploit
[2:04:03] hallelujah hallelujah amen I am not just
[2:04:06] exciting you I am Telling You
[2:04:10] reality I am Telling You
[2:04:12] reality if everyone in my family was
[2:04:17] poor oh they had
[2:04:19] riches and the riches got Finny
[2:04:23] look I can begin something
[2:04:25] new the likes of which none of my family
[2:04:28] members has ever
[2:04:30] seen why because I joined another
[2:04:34] family I am
[2:04:37] United with another
[2:04:39] family the family of God and we have
[2:04:43] another
[2:04:45] purpose we are
[2:04:47] united in one
[2:04:49] purpose there is much I want to share
[2:04:53] today in a very short time I want I want
[2:04:56] to be done because of the things I told
[2:04:58] you we are going to
[2:04:59] do so that means I have only 53
[2:05:03] minutes so give me all your
[2:05:06] attention and let me try to um keep this
[2:05:09] time by God's grace amen hallelujah amen
[2:05:14] F the Earth F the Earth was God's
[2:05:18] will but this people's motive
[2:05:22] was not God's
[2:05:24] will their motive came from someone I
[2:05:29] know it came from
[2:05:31] Lucifer what is your
[2:05:33] motive it either comes from God or from
[2:05:38] Lucifer are you hearing me this morning
[2:05:41] let me read for you Lucifer's
[2:05:43] motive Isaiah
[2:05:46] 14:12 how thou fallen from Heaven oh
[2:05:50] Lucifer son of the
[2:05:53] morning how thou cut down to the
[2:05:57] ground which did weaken the
[2:06:00] Nations for thou has said in thy
[2:06:04] heart I will Ascend into
[2:06:07] heaven I will exalt my
[2:06:10] throne above the stars of
[2:06:14] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[2:06:17] the
[2:06:19] congregation in the sides of the North
[2:06:23] I will
[2:06:25] Ascend above the heights of the
[2:06:28] clouds I will be like the most
[2:06:32] high yet Thou shalt be brought down to
[2:06:37] Hell to the sides of the
[2:06:40] pit the motive of
[2:06:43] Satan was to go
[2:06:46] high to to exalt himself higher so he
[2:06:50] can make a name for himself
[2:06:52] he wanted to have a
[2:06:55] kingdom bigger than the one Michael
[2:06:57] had but you see the kingdom of
[2:07:00] Satan cannot be bigger than the kingdom
[2:07:03] of
[2:07:05] God we are in this world but we have two
[2:07:09] kingdoms and they all side by
[2:07:12] side and both of them are pulling on
[2:07:15] us but because we have a seed of God in
[2:07:18] us the kingdom of Satan can not fully
[2:07:22] defeat
[2:07:23] us we will always overcome we shall
[2:07:26] always overcome because the seed of God
[2:07:29] remains in
[2:07:31] us and you see this the results of the
[2:07:36] unity this people wanted to they had
[2:07:38] come
[2:07:40] together of the at
[2:07:43] Babel and they had decided to build
[2:07:46] themselves a
[2:07:48] tower but because their Unity was not
[2:07:52] right their purpose was not
[2:07:56] right God from heaven sent them a
[2:08:03] spirit which made them change their
[2:08:07] tongues and they began speaking in
[2:08:10] unknown
[2:08:13] tongues until to date has never
[2:08:18] changed I can call here people who speak
[2:08:20] 10 different tongues
[2:08:24] one is
[2:08:25] speaking another another another
[2:08:31] anothera another one you
[2:08:35] know
[2:08:37] another and I'm still only in
[2:08:40] Uganda and have not
[2:08:42] finished and when I go to another
[2:08:44] country same thing to another country
[2:08:46] same thing and these people began
[2:08:48] speaking different
[2:08:50] tongues everyone was
[2:08:53] confused because they were not
[2:08:55] understanding what the other was saying
[2:08:57] and this this this has had a
[2:09:01] repeat in our
[2:09:03] generation you find in churches many
[2:09:06] churches which claim to have the
[2:09:09] spirit you find many different people
[2:09:11] speaking different
[2:09:14] tongues no one understands what the
[2:09:16] other one is
[2:09:18] saying and they don't care because they
[2:09:20] are confused
[2:09:24] so what is it it's another
[2:09:27] B it's another B but we have had a voice
[2:09:32] come out of my
[2:09:34] people be not partakers of our
[2:09:37] sins and that's why where we are when
[2:09:41] God if when God gives us a language a
[2:09:44] tongue amen he gives the
[2:09:48] interpretation why because he doesn't
[2:09:50] want us to be
[2:09:52] confused he wants us to understand and
[2:09:55] to be
[2:09:57] edified praise the name of the Lord and
[2:10:00] so these people's motives was
[2:10:03] wrong but they had one
[2:10:06] thing the unity of
[2:10:10] purpose nothing was restrained from
[2:10:14] them whatever they imagin to
[2:10:17] do for Satan to pull off his plan
[2:10:22] for him to pull off his plan in
[2:10:25] heaven he had to
[2:10:28] convince the
[2:10:32] angels to believe in his
[2:10:36] cause in his
[2:10:38] purpose can you imagine that Satan
[2:10:40] himself had a purpose in
[2:10:43] heaven imagine all of you are
[2:10:48] angels okay and I'm not sat
[2:10:54] and then would
[2:10:55] come and
[2:10:57] say all of you support me stand with me
[2:11:03] let us stop this
[2:11:04] government I want my Throne to be
[2:11:07] up I want to be high I want to be known
[2:11:12] I want to make a name for myself so let
[2:11:14] us do this and he
[2:11:18] convinced successfully
[2:11:21] many angels he convinced them in
[2:11:24] heaven he knew one
[2:11:27] thing today let us learn something from
[2:11:30] the way Satan does
[2:11:33] things because whatever he learned he
[2:11:36] learned it from
[2:11:38] God s knew one
[2:11:41] thing that Unity the power there is a
[2:11:44] power of
[2:11:48] unity there's a a great power in unity
[2:11:51] of
[2:11:55] purpose because he knew it sat knew it
[2:11:58] so much that he dared
[2:12:04] God he he dared God the creator of
[2:12:07] Heaven and
[2:12:09] Earth you know daring him is like
[2:12:13] a no you know like someone who would
[2:12:16] come like if if you were a soldier
[2:12:24] imagine sat he was a
[2:12:27] creation but he came and and he dared
[2:12:31] God
[2:12:32] himself and he said I want to take that
[2:12:35] the throne where you are
[2:12:40] sitting what did he trust you see he
[2:12:42] knew one thing if I can get most of the
[2:12:45] angels to stand with
[2:12:47] me and we agree
[2:12:49] together then shall accomplish what we
[2:12:53] want so there is two cases we have seen
[2:12:55] so far there is one case the one of of
[2:13:00] the Tower of
[2:13:02] Babel they had Unity
[2:13:07] of and they wanted to build a
[2:13:11] tower and they wanted to make themselves
[2:13:14] a great
[2:13:15] name and they wanted to be known and to
[2:13:18] be
[2:13:20] secure wanted to be in one place and
[2:13:24] powerful and God said they were going to
[2:13:28] accomplish
[2:13:29] it but there is another group of
[2:13:32] people these were also angels in
[2:13:35] heaven and they were you know at first
[2:13:38] you know they were all submitting to
[2:13:40] God but together sat Lucifer with the
[2:13:44] demons with all the
[2:13:46] Angels they
[2:13:48] agreed to top the government in heaven
[2:13:52] now let me tell you this in both these
[2:13:57] scenarios they were going to accomplish
[2:14:00] it the only thing that stopped
[2:14:04] it is
[2:14:07] God I don't know whether someone is
[2:14:09] getting the Revelation
[2:14:11] yet when there is unity of
[2:14:15] purpose whatever you have set out to do
[2:14:21] whatever you have imagined to
[2:14:24] do it will be
[2:14:26] finished it will be done it will be
[2:14:29] accomplished the only Satan himself can
[2:14:32] stop
[2:14:33] it the only thing that can stop
[2:14:36] it is
[2:14:39] God at the Tower of
[2:14:41] Babel it was God who stopped it if God
[2:14:45] had not stopped
[2:14:47] it today we would have a great power B
[2:14:51] speaking the same
[2:14:53] language and and you know man would make
[2:14:56] himself a kingdom different from what
[2:14:58] God envisioned for
[2:15:02] you but you see God could not allow it
[2:15:06] his will had to be
[2:15:08] done and he came and confused all of
[2:15:11] them and Lucifer he would have taken
[2:15:14] over
[2:15:16] Heaven he had the
[2:15:18] power why because of the unity of
[2:15:24] all the demons all the
[2:15:26] Angels which which were turned to Demons
[2:15:28] because
[2:15:29] the they were United with him they were
[2:15:33] agreeing with everything he was
[2:15:35] saying imagine it looked like God is
[2:15:39] defeated because most of the
[2:15:42] Angels had
[2:15:46] bowed most of the Angels had bowed
[2:15:50] that's why we sing a you are God from
[2:15:53] beginning to the end there's no place
[2:15:55] for argument you are God by
[2:15:58] yourself because listen there is nothing
[2:16:01] that can defeat the word of
[2:16:05] God there is nothing can defeat the word
[2:16:08] of
[2:16:09] God the word of God will always take the
[2:16:14] preeminence that's why for me as long as
[2:16:16] I set to do something and I know I am
[2:16:18] right standing on the word
[2:16:23] I don't fear no
[2:16:25] evil I don't fear
[2:16:27] nothing because I know God is with
[2:16:31] me but you see there is the
[2:16:34] power in unity of
[2:16:39] purpose can you read matthew8
[2:16:55] Matthew
[2:16:57] 18
[2:16:59] 19 and I say unto you that if two of you
[2:17:02] shall agree on Earth as touching
[2:17:04] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[2:17:06] done for them of My Father which is in
[2:17:07] heaven
[2:17:21] where two or three are gathered together
[2:17:23] in my name there am I in the midst of
[2:17:29] them did someone get
[2:17:31] that now you have heard it but I want
[2:17:34] you to now take it for
[2:17:37] yourself if two of you shall agree on
[2:17:41] us as touching
[2:17:44] anything that they shall
[2:17:48] ask if two shall agree as about anything
[2:17:52] on
[2:17:54] Earth and they ask it it shall be done
[2:17:58] for them of My Father which is in
[2:18:03] heaven now I want you to see this you
[2:18:06] know a brother came and told
[2:18:09] me some came you know even if you want a
[2:18:15] male
[2:18:16] child this scripture will work
[2:18:21] amen I said are you
[2:18:24] sure and he gave me his testimony I had
[2:18:27] three
[2:18:29] girls she said brother do you need a
[2:18:32] son I said yes I said I need more than a
[2:18:35] son I need several
[2:18:38] Sons he said well I tell you what to
[2:18:40] do one brother gave me a
[2:18:43] scripture I said is it a new scripture
[2:18:45] that is not in the
[2:18:48] Bible he said no it is in the Bible he
[2:18:51] read it to me he said you see this is
[2:18:54] the scripture I had
[2:18:57] children I had children but I did not
[2:19:00] have a male child and I needed God to
[2:19:03] provide for me a male
[2:19:05] child and so he said I met a
[2:19:09] brother who told me he used this
[2:19:13] scripture and it worked for
[2:19:16] him so he said I also did the same thing
[2:19:19] he did
[2:19:21] and I told him so what did you
[2:19:23] do he said he told me that he held hands
[2:19:27] with his
[2:19:28] wife and together with his wife they
[2:19:32] agreed that God will give them a wife
[2:19:36] God would give them a child a male child
[2:19:39] and so we they prayed oh God give us a
[2:19:42] male
[2:19:43] child and God answered them and I told
[2:19:47] him God answered them did he answer you
[2:19:49] also
[2:19:51] he said yes after very very very many
[2:19:55] years God answered me and I have my son
[2:20:00] I said
[2:20:01] amen in my heart I was like I will also
[2:20:03] try
[2:20:05] it children come from
[2:20:08] God so if you listening to me and you
[2:20:12] bar children come from
[2:20:14] God children come from God and I held
[2:20:18] hands with my wife I said God give us a
[2:20:22] male child some people when you are
[2:20:25] praying your prayers are not very
[2:20:28] clear so even God is not sure how to
[2:20:30] answer
[2:20:31] them you see oh God we want a child
[2:20:36] maybe a male one maybe okay whatever you
[2:20:39] want that prayer God will never answer
[2:20:42] because you're not sure about what you
[2:20:44] want you are not sure about what you
[2:20:48] are amen but you you have to be sure
[2:20:51] about what you want when you come before
[2:20:54] God God I need a white
[2:20:59] car God I need a car like this like this

[2:21:25] request amen if you are married you come
[2:21:29] together with your wife or with your
[2:21:32] husband that's why agreement is very
[2:21:34] very
[2:21:35] important and unity is very very
[2:21:39] important divided we
[2:21:42] fall United We
[2:21:45] Stand I'm trying to show you the power
[2:21:48] of unity

[2:25:14] of
[2:25:16] purpose praise the name of the Lord and
[2:25:19] the devil knows

[2:25:28] Unity he has always wanted
[2:25:32] Unity he has always been promoting
[2:25:35] it and I want to show you
[2:25:38] here in the message
[2:25:41] Oneness uh brother bam says something
[2:25:44] about the Council of
[2:25:47] churches he says mandas it builds
[2:25:49] another Tower of
[2:25:55] Babel what does he do look in this world
[2:25:59] Council of churches
[2:26:02] now the Anglican the Roman Catholic the
[2:26:06] Methodist the
[2:26:10] resian the
[2:26:12] Pentecostals and all of them United
[2:26:16] together Christian Science and many of
[2:26:19] the Cs that deny the Virgin
[2:26:25] birth they deny the duty of
[2:26:29] Jesus they make God three
[2:26:33] people they try to worship three
[2:26:36] gods they deny the Virgin
[2:26:42] birth some of them deny the
[2:26:45] blood some of them deny his
[2:26:48] miracles all of them do
[2:26:51] nearly they try to unite such as as that
[2:26:56] together how can you do it it's a
[2:27:00] man-made
[2:27:02] Tower it will fall like

[2:27:13] fall this people United
[2:27:16] together one
[2:27:18] mind one Unity of purose
[2:27:21] but God could not let it
[2:27:24] stand because it was a manmade
[2:27:28] idea but God will let any purpose
[2:27:33] stand if it isn't grounded in the
[2:27:40] word and these
[2:27:43] denominations by the way they have all
[2:27:44] come together in a council of churches
[2:27:50] but God said not by
[2:27:53] power not by mind but by my spirit say
[2:27:57] the Lord that is how I will unite my
[2:28:03] church The Church of God is not going to
[2:28:07] be United by
[2:28:10] denomination not by
[2:28:12] organization not by
[2:28:15] education not by
[2:28:17] theologians but by my spirit say the

[2:32:03] Ghost and
[2:32:05] power and all believers all over the
[2:32:08] world we are united in one
[2:32:13] purpose one
[2:32:15] Spirit we are baptized into it by the
[2:32:18] power of the Holy Ghost
[2:32:21] the moment you are sealed by the Holy
[2:32:24] Ghost you are ready for the Rapture you
[2:32:27] are ready for the Rapture I don't know
[2:32:29] how many are here for the
[2:32:31] Rapture but you see as many as are
[2:32:35] baptized by one
[2:32:37] Spirit they are all
[2:32:39] ready and he says oh
[2:32:42] my when he does what
[2:32:45] happens and his son will bear record on
[2:32:48] the same
[2:32:51] his signs will bear record on the
[2:32:55] same yes that's how Israel could say
[2:32:58] before they got mixed up with
[2:33:03] Moab there was a pill of fire over
[2:33:07] them what will he do he will bear a
[2:33:11] record the same kind of
[2:33:14] record but after they got
[2:33:18] disassociated separ their Oneness
[2:33:20] between them and
[2:33:23] God and they got in with Moab and
[2:33:27] them the victory all
[2:33:31] failed they stayed in the wilderness for
[2:33:34] 40 more
[2:33:36] years till God raised up another
[2:33:39] group to go over hey and complete his
[2:33:48] plan God
[2:33:50] will has a plan and his plan will never
[2:33:57] fail
[2:33:59] Hallelujah God uses men to accomplish
[2:34:01] his
[2:34:04] plan but when a man sleeps away from the
[2:34:09] plan God does not sleep away from the
[2:34:13] plan I see a man called
[2:34:17] sa we think people chose soul
[2:34:21] it was God who
[2:34:22] chose he he told the man of God go and
[2:34:28] anoint sa was going about his
[2:34:31] business and he gave him a
[2:34:33] sign he said you know when the spirit of
[2:34:36] God comes upon
[2:34:38] him when he comes among the prophet the
[2:34:41] son of the prophets he will begin
[2:34:44] prophesying like them and that will be a
[2:34:49] son
[2:34:51] that is
[2:34:52] chosen God
[2:34:54] chose not the people and soul was
[2:34:58] supposed to follow God's
[2:35:01] plan but time came when s's had became
[2:35:07] hty he became
[2:35:10] disobedient he became
[2:35:13] proud and God said no
[2:35:16] problem so you think you are the only
[2:35:18] one

[2:37:51] as he was proud thinking that he the man
[2:37:54] of
[2:37:56] God God s did not
[2:37:59] know are you hearing me church that God
[2:38:02] is only interested in his right
[2:38:09] purpose and so you know David was
[2:38:13] there and you know the man of God looked
[2:38:15] at all the other children
[2:38:19] God kept on saying no no no no no no
[2:38:25] until Le David showed up and God said
[2:38:28] yes I'm sure even when the man of God
[2:38:31] was going to anoint
[2:38:34] him he
[2:38:36] was could he really be the
[2:38:39] one and he finally anointed
[2:38:42] him and Little
[2:38:44] David was just there smiling like this
[2:38:47] young man saying what is happening to me
[2:38:51] in other words the man of God told him
[2:38:55] congratulations you are a king from
[2:38:57] today God is going to use you from
[2:39:01] today I'm not just using you as an
[2:39:04] example this as a Rema word for you God
[2:39:08] is going to use you from today
[2:39:11] Hallelujah and God anointed a
[2:39:14] man and Saul was still jumping up and
[2:39:17] down I am the man of God I'm the man of
[2:39:20] God but listen there's something I was
[2:39:23] coming
[2:39:24] to God is only looking at his
[2:39:28] purpose and God has not run out of
[2:39:32] men and right from that
[2:39:35] time when David
[2:39:38] disobeyed when David when Saul
[2:39:41] disobeyed you know God anointed David
[2:39:44] and sa knew nothing about
[2:39:47] it the time he knew about it
[2:39:50] he wanted to kill the boy but remember
[2:39:53] you cannot be killed until the purpose
[2:39:56] has
[2:39:58] been you cannot die until his purpose is
[2:40:03] accomplished can you PR over your life
[2:40:07] and say I shall
[2:40:09] leave to declare the purpose of
[2:40:13] God
[2:40:15] hallelujah and right
[2:40:17] there Soul was jumping up and
[2:40:20] down but God had a
[2:40:23] king sa was
[2:40:26] disobeying God had a
[2:40:28] king are you hearing me this morning
[2:40:31] Saul was playing around but God had a
[2:40:35] king and I want to tell you
[2:40:38] Church whatever God has called you to
[2:40:41] do do it with
[2:40:45] diligence because God has a little David
[2:40:47] somewhere
[2:40:50] if you are the one sweeping the
[2:40:51] church don't begin playing
[2:40:54] around God want someone else who will do
[2:40:59] it let me help them to S the
[2:41:02] church you are not helping
[2:41:04] anyone sweep the church because God has
[2:41:07] called you to
[2:41:08] do and there is a blessing behind
[2:41:12] it way everything you do for God has a
[2:41:15] blessing behind
[2:41:17] it and if you play
[2:41:20] round God will anoint a little David oh
[2:41:23] God may you help me may you not anoint
[2:41:26] my little
[2:41:29] David help me to be
[2:41:32] diligent help me to be
[2:41:36] committed help me to be
[2:41:40] surrendered now look when God brings a
[2:41:42] church together with his
[2:41:45] Spirit they will have signs and of the
[2:41:47] Living God among them
[2:41:50] what kind of signs when God separated
[2:41:52] Israel from
[2:41:55] Egypt God gave Moses and Israel a sign
[2:41:58] of a pill of
[2:42:03] fire and he gave them a
[2:42:05] prophet when he separed Abraham from
[2:42:08] lot there was an angel to an angel came
[2:42:11] to
[2:42:12] him that could design the thoughts and
[2:42:15] intents of the heart
[2:42:20] and I read a quote here that brother bam
[2:42:22] was speaking about the foolish
[2:42:27] virgins you see he says as um he say he
[2:42:31] was talking about the foolish V virgins
[2:42:33] and he says the Council of
[2:42:38] churches is nothing else in the world
[2:42:42] but a star of the foolish virgin
[2:42:50] okay you have to interpret get the
[2:42:51] correct the correct interpretation here
[2:42:53] star not with a but with I star of the
[2:42:57] foolish
[2:43:09] virgin you know the foolish
[2:43:13] virgins are the ones that are not going
[2:43:16] to go in the rapture
[2:43:19] the foolish
[2:43:21] virgins they are going to remain behind
[2:43:24] they will miss the
[2:43:26] Rapture do I have some fo virgins here
[2:43:33] today they will miss the
[2:43:35] Rapture but the wise virgins will go
[2:43:39] the and he said the counc of
[2:43:43] churches we have a counc of churches
[2:43:45] called The World Council of churches
[2:43:49] even here in
[2:43:51] Uganda we have c those
[2:43:55] churches they unite together all the
[2:43:59] denominations and I think they called
[2:44:01] ecumenical movement ecumenical
[2:44:06] council all of them come together for
[2:44:09] what reason for love for
[2:44:14] Unity solidity what else
[2:44:20] you know and so they unite
[2:44:23] together and um you know they they begin
[2:44:26] to say we are the voice of religion in
[2:44:28] the
[2:44:31] country and the Catholic
[2:44:35] church is not a member of the World
[2:44:37] Council of
[2:44:42] churches but the Catholic Church the the
[2:44:46] the leader of the World Council of
[2:44:48] churches
[2:44:51] he reports occasionally to the uh to the
[2:44:56] pope of
[2:45:05] R
[2:45:07] and you know you would wonder why would
[2:45:09] the leader of the Council of churches
[2:45:12] report the pope of Rome when the
[2:45:14] Catholic church is not a member of the
[2:45:15] of the Council of churches
[2:45:30] we are preparing ourself for the One
[2:45:32] World
[2:45:36] Government one world
[2:45:39] religion and the C of of the
[2:45:42] churches they all unite under they say
[2:45:46] we don't believe in the same Doctrine
[2:45:51] but we should agree to work
[2:45:55] together what is that you think that is
[2:45:58] a good thing I surprise you by doing
[2:46:02] that the people are getting the mark of
[2:46:04] the
[2:46:06] beast the Bible says they get it by the
[2:46:09] right
[2:46:10] hand
[2:46:12] fellow by the
[2:46:15] forehead Doctrine intellect
[2:46:19] people are going to get the back of the
[2:46:20] beast in two
[2:46:23] ways
[2:46:25] one by being in the wrong
[2:46:30] fellowships two by believing the wrong
[2:46:34] doctrines and the Council of
[2:46:37] churches is a star of the foolish
[2:46:41] virgins so all those who are joining the
[2:46:44] Council of
[2:46:46] churches those systems those organiz
[2:46:49] those
[2:46:50] religions they are actually preparing
[2:46:53] the foolish
[2:46:55] virgin for the
[2:46:58] tribulation but I'm so glad I have a
[2:47:02] message that has called me out of the
[2:47:05] denomination I am not a member of The
[2:47:07] ecumenical
[2:47:09] move we will never be a member we are
[2:47:12] not about to be a
[2:47:14] member that is why even this
[2:47:17] message is not known anywhere by the way
[2:47:20] did you know that they'll ask you what
[2:47:23] is your
[2:47:24] religion no one knows our
[2:47:27] religion because we cannot
[2:47:29] Unite with them to unite with them we
[2:47:34] have to be a
[2:47:37] denomination but we are not one so we
[2:47:40] can never Unite with
[2:47:43] them that's why we even have different
[2:47:46] Church
[2:47:47] names don't have a
[2:47:50] headquarter yes you you may find one
[2:47:53] Church name maybe in a few places and
[2:47:55] another one and another one and another
[2:47:59] one depending on who started those
[2:48:02] churches but you see all the Believers
[2:48:05] all over the
[2:48:06] world what is our
[2:48:09] name we have no
[2:48:11] name think of it the Roman Catholic
[2:48:14] church is called the Roman Catholic
[2:48:15] Church all over the world the angan
[2:48:19] church is called all over the
[2:48:22] world but the message
[2:48:24] church is not a
[2:48:27] denomination it is a revelation of the
[2:48:30] word it's a restoration back to the
[2:48:33] apostles
[2:48:34] Doctrine we have one Unity of
[2:48:39] purpose we are restored back again our
[2:48:43] purpose is the message the word the Holy
[2:48:47] Ghost and that's we cannot be part of
[2:48:50] the Council of
[2:48:51] churches the Council of churches is
[2:48:54] another Bible
[2:48:57] today but I'm so glad you know there's a
[2:49:00] song that says oh I'm so glad he found
[2:49:02] me with his arms he
[2:49:07] bound and he led me into this message
[2:49:11] and now I'm one of his own and oh what
[2:49:16] Joy of knowing you know what he led me
[2:49:19] into this
[2:49:20] message he brought he he he set my feet
[2:49:24] on the Rock to
[2:49:26] stay we have not come here or we don't
[2:49:28] gather here to form another
[2:49:32] denomination and that's why I'm so sorry
[2:49:34] for people who come to this message and
[2:49:36] remain
[2:49:39] siners you come to the message
[2:49:42] church and you remain going to
[2:49:46] fornication the angel of the Lord is
[2:49:48] watching
[2:49:50] and you know you you are not filled with
[2:49:52] the Holy
[2:49:53] Ghost that means you are not yet filled
[2:49:56] with the Holy
[2:49:57] Ghost you are in the message
[2:50:00] church you've not overcome the
[2:50:03] world but you know those who shall
[2:50:05] overcome the
[2:50:06] world shall sit with him on his
[2:50:10] throne this message has come to bring us
[2:50:13] into one
[2:50:15] purpose of Overcomers
[2:50:19] we are the Overcomers in this
[2:50:23] generation we are the ones in the true
[2:50:26] unity in the message as the ego stirreth
[2:50:30] up her
[2:50:33] nest he
[2:50:35] says my Ministry is a Ministry trying to
[2:50:39] unite the bride of Christ
[2:50:42] together not unite denominations to one
[2:50:45] denomination
[2:50:48] but unite brothers and
[2:50:51] sisters as one group of
[2:50:54] people one in
[2:50:56] purose one in heart one in
[2:51:00] unity to see the coming of the Lord
[2:51:03] Jesus
[2:51:04] Christ so in other words this message is
[2:51:07] not uniting one denomination into
[2:51:11] one it is uniting people brothers and
[2:51:16] sisters the body of Christ
[2:51:21] together that's why we don't have a
[2:51:24] headquarter these details are very
[2:51:26] important for those who are new to the
[2:51:27] message we don't have a
[2:51:30] headquarter our headquarter is the
[2:51:34] word our Archbishop is Jesus
[2:51:37] Christ we are all United under that one
[2:51:41] message we are all corrected by that one
[2:51:45] message when someone does a mistake
[2:51:49] someone people have come up and have
[2:51:51] asked me how do you then correct erant
[2:51:56] ministers you see you correct ER
[2:52:00] ministers by the
[2:52:02] word not by the discipline of the
[2:52:09] organization you saw what happened to
[2:52:11] the Archbishop here of one of the
[2:52:14] churches they told they disciplined him
[2:52:18] but you see the denomination disciplined
[2:52:22] him and so they are they also ask us how
[2:52:25] can we discipl our
[2:52:30] ministers
[2:52:32] chur you you are the church and when you
[2:52:36] receive this
[2:52:38] word you have a
[2:52:40] right to walk away from me if I'm not
[2:52:43] preaching the
[2:52:47] truth and where will you go there are
[2:52:50] many tens of millions of preachers who
[2:52:52] are preaching this
[2:52:55] message even here
[2:52:57] Ina in every city in
[2:52:59] Uganda there are tens of thousands of
[2:53:03] them what I'm trying to show you church
[2:53:06] God is Not
[2:53:08] bankrupt of men he will use of women he
[2:53:12] will
[2:53:12] use but he's only looking for people who
[2:53:15] have a thirst and hunger for the world
[2:53:21] that's why we should never
[2:53:25] compromise amen we should never
[2:53:29] compromise praise the name of the Lord
[2:53:31] amen
[2:53:37] now Psalms 1331 says behold how good and
[2:53:41] how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
[2:53:43] together in unity
[2:53:49] you see does this mean we will always
[2:53:51] agree on
[2:53:55] everything it simply means as Believers
[2:53:58] we unite around the
[2:54:03] word right here I want to correct some
[2:54:12] people many
[2:54:14] times when a person doesn't agree with
[2:54:17] another
[2:54:19] on just some little
[2:54:21] thing okay how many here believe that
[2:54:24] Jesus is coming to take us in the
[2:54:26] Rapture lift up your hand if you believe
[2:54:29] it okay how many here say he will come
[2:54:32] on a white horse lift up
[2:54:36] your lift up your
[2:54:39] hand okay okay how many here say he will
[2:54:43] come on the
[2:54:46] clouds okay okay and those of you who
[2:54:49] have not lifted up how do you believe
[2:54:51] you will
[2:54:53] come you have other
[2:54:57] opinions so you
[2:54:58] see our Revelation is
[2:55:01] different but we all believe in the
[2:55:05] Rapture and someone comes up and says no
[2:55:08] how many believe we are going to have a
[2:55:10] a tribulation lift up your
[2:55:13] hand how many believe here how many
[2:55:16] believe we are going to have a
[2:55:17] tribulation
[2:55:27] now how many believe it's going to be
[2:55:29] seven
[2:55:35] years okay how many believe it's going
[2:55:37] to be 3 years and a
[2:55:41] half okay now you see different
[2:55:45] understanding how many believe the bride
[2:55:48] will through the
[2:55:52] tribulation you see we all believe that
[2:55:56] bride will not go through the
[2:55:59] tribulation but depending on which
[2:56:01] church you came
[2:56:03] from of course if you came from this
[2:56:05] church you know the tribulation three
[2:56:08] years and a
[2:56:10] half but if you had another Pastor who T
[2:56:12] you
[2:56:14] different your tribulation is going to
[2:56:16] be seven years
[2:56:19] but I don't
[2:56:20] care you are my
[2:56:24] brother there's going to be a
[2:56:26] tribulation and both of us believe we
[2:56:29] are not going to be a part of
[2:56:31] it Hallelujah am so what am I trying to
[2:56:35] say the unity of of
[2:56:38] purpose it means we are united around
[2:56:41] the
[2:56:44] world with all other believers
[2:56:48] talking about I'm not talking about only
[2:56:49] this church I'm talking about all other
[2:56:53] believers all over the world we are
[2:56:56] united around the
[2:56:58] world someone who little Revelation on
[2:57:01] the
[2:57:02] word that is a little different from
[2:57:04] what I
[2:57:06] have I don't care about it they are my
[2:57:09] brother and they are my
[2:57:11] sister and that's why we should always
[2:57:14] Unite with other believers
[2:57:18] we should never get
[2:57:20] indifferent we get some kind of spirit
[2:57:22] around us to feel and believe we are the
[2:57:24] only right
[2:57:28] group do you know that there are many
[2:57:30] groups like
[2:57:32] that and I believe we are the only right
[2:57:35] one some of them even say for us we are
[2:57:38] eagles for them they're
[2:57:41] chicken Believers of the message will
[2:57:43] say
[2:57:44] that and you find a pastor on the pull
[2:57:47] pit say for us we are the Eagles for
[2:57:50] them they the
[2:57:52] chicken he's not talking the
[2:57:54] denominations he's talking about other
[2:57:55] message believers who don't
[2:57:57] have the Revelation that he
[2:58:00] has he feels he has a special
[2:58:02] Revelation listen we have no special
[2:58:06] revelation we only have the message of
[2:58:08] the hour
[2:58:10] period period That's What We Believe and
[2:58:14] every brother who believes it is our
[2:58:16] brother
[2:58:19] every sister who believes it is our
[2:58:22] sister do you believe that church that's
[2:58:25] why in this church I want to employer
[2:58:27] you I want to instruct
[2:58:29] you you should never ever disfellowship
[2:58:33] other
[2:58:36] [Applause]
[2:58:38] believers they our
[2:58:41] brothers it doesn't matter what their
[2:58:42] Church name
[2:58:46] is what what belies I don't care
[2:58:49] what I don't care what
[2:58:56] name as long as they believe the
[2:58:59] message they are our
[2:59:02] brothers as long as they believe in one
[2:59:05] God they are our brothers as long as
[2:59:08] they believe in the
[2:59:09] Resurrection The rupture they our
[2:59:12] brothers as long as they believe in the
[2:59:15] baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:59:16] Christ
[2:59:18] they are our
[2:59:21] brothers they believe in Malachi
[2:59:23] 4 they are our
[2:59:25] brothers you know they believe in all
[2:59:28] the Mysteries the Seven
[2:59:33] Seals the right Ministry the working of
[2:59:36] the of the gifts in the
[2:59:40] body they our
[2:59:43] brothers but where they got
[2:59:47] denominational they go into Creeds and
[2:59:50] dogmas they go into clanning themselves
[2:59:52] and try you
[2:59:54] know going into for us we are this tribe
[2:59:57] for the others we are this tribe you
[3:00:00] know for us we see no we we don't
[3:00:04] associate with
[3:00:07] that we have a message and the message
[3:00:10] is a perfect revelation of the
[3:00:13] word and we as Believers we unite around
[3:00:17] this message
[3:00:21] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[3:00:24] name of the Lord
[3:00:26] amen now there's a I have a a very um a
[3:00:31] a short reading here that I
[3:00:33] read that I felt is very
[3:00:37] significant and I must um read for you
[3:00:39] before I I
[3:00:45] conclude um it says um this was written
[3:00:49] by a man called
[3:00:52] Randy and he was giving a little
[3:00:54] comments on the book of
[3:00:58] nemiah and um I want you to follow this
[3:01:02] through with
[3:01:03] me have we received that kind of vision
[3:01:06] from God
[3:01:10] himself yes but before I share his
[3:01:13] vision that should ultimately bring
[3:01:14] Unity
[3:01:19] let's look at a few biblical principles
[3:01:21] on
[3:01:25] Vision
[3:01:27] maybe maybe because this is a long
[3:01:29] reading maybe I can read it without
[3:01:31] interpretation can anybody hear
[3:01:41] English
[3:01:42] separately okay so let me just read it
[3:01:45] in English amen praise the Lord amen
[3:01:48] okay it says one of the best places to
[3:01:50] look is the book of Nehemiah Nehemiah is
[3:01:53] among other things a great leadership
[3:01:55] manual it teaches strategy management
[3:01:57] and people skills it is a book on
[3:02:00] teamwork possibly most of all it shows a
[3:02:03] comparing vision and a Divine and a
[3:02:06] Divine communication of
[3:02:08] fruition the setting for the book of
[3:02:11] Nehemiah takes place roughly 500 years
[3:02:14] before the time of Christ after the
[3:02:16] Babylonian captivity as a result of the
[3:02:19] decree of Cyrus the Jews were allowed to
[3:02:21] return to their Homeland only to find
[3:02:23] the city of Jerusalem in Ruins we are
[3:02:26] introduced to Nehemiah as the cup Bearer
[3:02:29] and I and I I pray that some of you will
[3:02:30] go and read the book of Nehemiah after
[3:02:32] this as the cup bearer nemiah was a cup
[3:02:35] Bearer to the king excuse me as a high
[3:02:38] position in the Royal Court in the 20th
[3:02:40] year of the king's Reign One of
[3:02:42] nehemiah's Brothers who had been living
[3:02:44] in Judah visits him in Susa nemiah asks
[3:02:48] about the surviving captive Jews about
[3:02:51] Jerusalem the answer which bothered him
[3:02:54] greatly was survivers were in great
[3:02:57] distress and the wall of Jerusalem was
[3:02:59] broken down and this bth a passion for a
[3:03:04] compelling Vision now I want you to see
[3:03:07] Nehemiah was a
[3:03:09] prophet nemiah was you know in captivity
[3:03:12] like the rest of the
[3:03:14] Jews and here for very many years
[3:03:19] they were not in
[3:03:20] Jerusalem and here his brother came and
[3:03:23] told him about what was
[3:03:27] happening he told him how the wall was
[3:03:31] broken he told him how you know the
[3:03:34] survivors were in great
[3:03:40] distress be you know received a
[3:03:43] burden and received a
[3:03:46] vision to of rebuilding the Temple of
[3:03:50] rebuilding
[3:03:51] Jerusalem but before we okay let me
[3:03:54] continue here and we see principles I
[3:03:56] want to show you tonight before I I
[3:03:59] complete this sermon the principles of a
[3:04:03] compelling
[3:04:08] Vision one the first bibical principle
[3:04:12] just listen of a compelling Vision
[3:04:14] number one it starts with God and is
[3:04:17] received through prayer the first thing
[3:04:19] Nehemiah did after hearing about the
[3:04:21] state of Jerusalem was fall on his face
[3:04:24] before God and pray nine times in the
[3:04:27] first year in the first chapter of
[3:04:29] Nehemiah the word pray or prayer is used
[3:04:33] it has been said nothing significant for
[3:04:35] God ever happens apart from prayer this
[3:04:39] must be where any Vision
[3:04:41] begins God spoke to Nehemiah in that in
[3:04:45] that still Small Voice and assured him
[3:04:47] of what what could and should be done he
[3:04:49] knew the walls needed rebuilding this
[3:04:52] wasn't just a dream Nehemiah dreamed of
[3:04:55] it wasn't even his idea this was the
[3:04:59] vision given to him by God today it is
[3:05:03] so easy to dream up big plans for God
[3:05:06] and then ask him to bless them this is
[3:05:08] backwards our vision whether for our
[3:05:11] family our church our fellowship or
[3:05:13] ourselves must begin with a complete
[3:05:17] dependence on God and on commitment to
[3:05:20] listen to him I want to show you
[3:05:22] something about
[3:05:24] Vision you the Bible says where there is
[3:05:26] no
[3:05:28] vision the people
[3:05:31] perish listen Church my time is up but I
[3:05:35] want you to give me 20 more minutes I I
[3:05:36] wrap
[3:05:37] up I said
[3:05:39] 20 listen are you listening ask your
[3:05:43] neighbor are you
[3:05:46] listening we are talking about Vision
[3:05:51] here
[3:05:53] Vision without it no matter what you are
[3:05:57] talking about it will
[3:06:02] fail let it be a
[3:06:04] church a church without
[3:06:08] Vision it
[3:06:10] fails a family without
[3:06:13] Vision a family a family
[3:06:21] families it
[3:06:23] fails fellowships they fail anything we
[3:06:28] are talking
[3:06:29] about there must be vision driving
[3:06:34] it and we see here that one of the
[3:06:37] principles of a compelling
[3:06:41] vision is a true Vision starts in prayer
[3:06:46] with God
[3:06:52] you know when you go in
[3:06:54] prayer some Believers the problem
[3:06:56] Believers don't want to
[3:07:00] pray we don't want to pray and by the
[3:07:04] way if you live a life where you never
[3:07:07] pray you will always be disturbed in
[3:07:11] things of
[3:07:14] life but when you put yourself to a life
[3:07:18] of
[3:07:21] prayer God will give you
[3:07:25] Vision before this year
[3:07:28] ends just be in prayer that's why we
[3:07:32] even do that overnight of
[3:07:35] prayer so we can get vision for the next
[3:07:40] year you know whatever face you reach
[3:07:42] out and you need to hear from God you go
[3:07:44] in prayer
[3:07:47] so nemiah went in
[3:07:50] prayer and you know God revealed to
[3:07:55] him what he must
[3:07:57] do God showed him what he must do he
[3:08:02] became
[3:08:04] sad which was a taboo before the king to
[3:08:08] be
[3:08:13] sad the second principle of a compelling
[3:08:15] Vision it goes through God is appointed
[3:08:18] leader that's the second principle
[3:08:32] now okay I'll I I'll read this where's
[3:08:35] brother
[3:08:36] Elijah okay come and help the brother
[3:08:38] come and help the brother to
[3:08:40] interpret I know I you will interpret
[3:08:43] for about 15
[3:08:45] minutes this is I Little David
[3:08:49] today praise the Lord okay let me just
[3:08:52] read this and then he will interpret
[3:08:53] when I'm speaking okay the second
[3:08:55] principle listen just listen Church
[3:08:56] listen to these things very important
[3:08:58] the second principle of a comparing
[3:09:00] Vision it goes through God's appointed
[3:09:02] leader Nehemiah completely accepted and
[3:09:06] believed in the vision given to him by
[3:09:08] God are you listening to me to the point
[3:09:11] he was willing to put his life on the
[3:09:13] line in chapter two Nehemiah is serving
[3:09:17] the king and the King notices he has a
[3:09:19] sad countenance and questions him this
[3:09:22] terrified Nehemiah because it was a
[3:09:24] violation of the law to be sad in the
[3:09:26] king's presence Nehemiah confronts his
[3:09:29] fear and tells the king the vision God
[3:09:31] gave him amen okay don't hear what don't
[3:09:35] see how how small my David is just
[3:09:38] listen to what he's going to be speaking
[3:09:39] praise the name of the Lord just all
[3:09:41] right okay just I was going to tell you
[3:09:43] to use a higher voice praise the name of
[3:09:45] the Lord I want you to see something
[3:09:47] Church praise the name of the Lord
[3:09:50] praise the name of the
[3:09:52] Lord a second
[3:09:55] principle yes uh a
[3:09:59] vision is it has to go through God's
[3:10:02] appointed
[3:10:06] leader God you know I was um I was
[3:10:10] speaking with the pastor I told you and
[3:10:13] he told me this he said that U
[3:10:18] a church just like you see dvf here a
[3:10:22] church is not just the
[3:10:25] people a church is the vision of the
[3:10:30] person that God has chosen to
[3:10:34] use are you hearing me if for example
[3:10:37] brother
[3:10:39] um you know brother Dixon
[3:10:43] here goes to
[3:10:47] with a
[3:10:48] button with a vision to go and start
[3:10:52] something there you know the ministry
[3:10:55] the ministry there will not be the
[3:10:58] building will not be the chairs will not
[3:11:02] be the
[3:11:03] musicians the ministry there will be
[3:11:05] brother
[3:11:08] Dix you understand is the man that God
[3:11:13] has chosen to use there and he brings
[3:11:16] that vision and he uses this man to
[3:11:19] bring it to the
[3:11:29] people praise the name of the Lord now
[3:11:31] listen okay just listen to this God God
[3:11:33] has always used I thought these are very
[3:11:35] words of great words of wisdom and I
[3:11:36] wanted you to listen to it now God has
[3:11:38] always used these people to accomplish
[3:11:40] great things one remarkable aspect of
[3:11:43] the book of Nehemiah is there are no
[3:11:45] Miracles involved if you have ever seen
[3:11:48] a book with no
[3:11:50] Miracles is the book of
[3:11:53] Nehemiah there are no Miracles involved
[3:11:56] here we are only seeing a man with a
[3:12:00] burden for something to
[3:12:02] happen he's going to stop at nothing
[3:12:05] until it
[3:12:11] happens there are no Angelic host coming
[3:12:15] down to help it is just God's man
[3:12:18] serving God's people a god sized
[3:12:21] compelling Vision however is too great
[3:12:24] for just one
[3:12:26] person there is no way nemiah could have
[3:12:30] accomplished it by
[3:12:32] himself nemiah needed
[3:12:36] people to accomplish a
[3:12:40] vision what I'm speaking on here is very
[3:12:44] foundational and I'm I'm going to first
[3:12:46] nail it down properly in the next
[3:12:47] minutes I asked
[3:12:50] listen when
[3:12:52] nemiah he was serving the
[3:12:56] king he was the
[3:12:59] one holding the cup of the
[3:13:02] king you know if you are the one holding
[3:13:04] the cup of the
[3:13:06] king you always had to be
[3:13:11] happy like that brother is
[3:13:13] smiling you always have to be happy
[3:13:19] so it was not allowed to be
[3:13:24] S are we in the presence of the king
[3:13:27] here who is
[3:13:30] Happy neiah had to be happy but when he
[3:13:34] was told by his
[3:13:35] brother about what is happening in
[3:13:40] Jerusalem became
[3:13:43] sad so he became like this
[3:13:47] so when the king looked at him said what
[3:13:51] what is happen to
[3:13:52] neiah in other words do you want to die
[3:13:55] how can you be sad in my
[3:13:59] presence and then he
[3:14:01] explained he said my people are
[3:14:04] dying I need to go back allow me let me
[3:14:08] go back and do
[3:14:10] something I want to do something for my
[3:14:13] people I want to do something for my
[3:14:16] people you know I was just laying I was
[3:14:18] just seeing a brother laying in the
[3:14:22] [Music]
[3:14:25] coffee I knew him to be a very lovely
[3:14:27] brother humble
[3:14:28] brother but you see God had used
[3:14:32] him he built churches he helped the
[3:14:35] brothers he help the
[3:14:37] ministers he stood for this
[3:14:40] message talking about a high profile
[3:14:42] person in the
[3:14:44] government but he did a lot
[3:14:47] but you see the Bible says our works the
[3:14:49] works of of those who
[3:14:52] believe they go before
[3:14:54] them and now he's he's standing before
[3:14:57] God and the only thing that he can point
[3:15:01] out the only thing he can point
[3:15:04] out is what he did for the Lord and for
[3:15:07] the work of God but you see also he was
[3:15:12] standing serving the
[3:15:14] king but in his heart said no this is
[3:15:18] not
[3:15:18] enough I have to go back and serve my
[3:15:22] people he was sad because of that by the
[3:15:25] way to be sad before the king to be sad
[3:15:29] before the King was risking his
[3:15:35] life the king would just say you kill
[3:15:38] that he he risked his
[3:15:42] life all for
[3:15:44] what because of the vision he had
[3:15:49] received but if a vision is
[3:15:52] big if a vision is from
[3:15:55] God if a vision is
[3:15:58] great it cannot be accomplished by one
[3:16:02] person God will always have a leader he
[3:16:05] will
[3:16:06] choose and he will say I want to use
[3:16:09] you but not only you he will use you but
[3:16:15] he will give you many many
[3:16:18] amen
[3:16:20] hallelujah and every church ministry is
[3:16:23] like
[3:16:24] that and every family is like
[3:16:27] that you know when when when you a man
[3:16:30] and have a big Vision like brother Alan
[3:16:34] here you have dreams and vision things
[3:16:36] you have God has revealed to you you
[3:16:38] have to accomplish in this
[3:16:42] life he now begins to give you other
[3:16:44] people to support you
[3:16:46] he now begins to bring
[3:16:48] Marine he now begins to bring children
[3:16:51] you children don't come only for you to
[3:16:54] bust
[3:16:55] on they come to move the
[3:16:59] vision they come to move the vision that
[3:17:01] God has given
[3:17:03] you you understand that's why if someone
[3:17:06] has no
[3:17:09] children it's a bad
[3:17:11] thing it is good to have
[3:17:15] children it is good for a father to have
[3:17:20] children you believe that every parent
[3:17:23] who has
[3:17:25] children he's always very
[3:17:27] happy when he just looks at his
[3:17:30] child I always hear my mother I'm sorry
[3:17:32] talk about
[3:17:34] you you know when she's talking to her
[3:17:37] friends she begins talking about her
[3:17:40] children oh this one is doing that oh
[3:17:43] this one is doing that and until now
[3:17:46] after she has talked about them she
[3:17:48] begins to feel good
[3:17:50] now because she has
[3:17:52] children you understand so this come to
[3:17:56] support your
[3:17:59] vision even
[3:18:01] Ministry Ministry cannot be done by one
[3:18:06] man when God calls
[3:18:09] Moses he gives the vision to
[3:18:14] Moses listen Vision doesn't come to many
[3:18:17] people at the same
[3:18:19] time God chooses a leader one
[3:18:22] man just like in our generation he chose
[3:18:26] one
[3:18:27] man one
[3:18:29] man one
[3:18:36] manth one man in the hands of
[3:18:42] God go and study your history books
[3:18:47] there is no man in this
[3:18:50] generation listen for the last 50
[3:18:55] years whose Ministry canot be Tred back
[3:18:57] to William
[3:19:04] Bram I'll show you an example here just
[3:19:07] in our
[3:19:09] country there is a man many God has
[3:19:14] used I don't look at their bad side
[3:19:17] I look at what they have
[3:19:19] accomplished you can look at Pastor Kay
[3:19:22] for
[3:19:23] example he's done a great work in this
[3:19:25] country in his own
[3:19:32] rights so we see that uh he claims T
[3:19:38] osbor is his spiritual
[3:19:44] father have you heard about a man called
[3:19:49] Bishop
[3:19:51] Bon how many have heard of
[3:19:54] it he claims
[3:19:56] also his spiritual father is
[3:20:02] Osborne did you know
[3:20:05] that now T
[3:20:08] Osborne gave his
[3:20:11] testimony Tom Osborne so we call him t l
[3:20:14] Osborne you need to read more
[3:20:17] oror was a man that went to
[3:20:21] India and he went with his wife to to
[3:20:25] heing Crusades and all these things
[3:20:27] preach the
[3:20:28] gospel and they failed they told them
[3:20:33] you can you demonstrate this thing
[3:20:34] you're telling
[3:20:37] us can God heal us these people who
[3:20:40] have and they failed to perform one
[3:20:44] Miracle fa flat
[3:20:47] and his ministry was coming to one
[3:20:49] end he came back to America
[3:20:54] defeated until he his wife told him
[3:20:59] about and they sat in the tent of
[3:21:01] brother
[3:21:02] bham and they saw the
[3:21:05] Miracles
[3:21:08] life they saw the feet of of a child
[3:21:13] becoming longer
[3:21:16] they saw close eyes becoming
[3:21:21] normal said
[3:21:23] what he said no he went a prayer
[3:21:28] closet he said if this God have
[3:21:31] seen the god of William Bram is the god
[3:21:35] of the Bible I also want to be able to
[3:21:38] perform
[3:21:40] Miracles he
[3:21:42] prayed until God gave it to
[3:21:44] him and he came here to you guys
[3:21:47] he went all over the
[3:21:49] world so is all
[3:21:51] robots and others they all saided with
[3:21:54] William
[3:21:56] Bram many of you did not know that
[3:21:59] William Bram was a man that God gave the
[3:22:03] vision in our
[3:22:05] generation for the bright
[3:22:16] [Music]
[3:22:23] know the vision of this generation
[3:22:25] hallelujah amen so a God sized comparing
[3:22:29] Vision if a vision is a big
[3:22:33] Vision if it's from
[3:22:35] God it is too great for just one
[3:22:40] person just like in a local
[3:22:43] church if God has given me the vision
[3:22:46] for
[3:22:50] you know someone brother sh canot also
[3:22:53] come and
[3:22:56] say I also have the vision for the
[3:23:00] church that's
[3:23:03] confusion Brother Martin cannot come and
[3:23:06] say you know I'm a minister
[3:23:09] here Pastor is not doing things
[3:23:12] correctly I also have the vision for
[3:23:15] things to be done this way
[3:23:18] we are going to get
[3:23:20] confusion we have to be
[3:23:22] led by a God given
[3:23:29] Vision but you see it cannot be done by
[3:23:32] one
[3:23:34] person okay listen a leader must be
[3:23:36] willing to stand alone but he or she
[3:23:39] also realizes that a compelling vision
[3:23:41] gets others involved after nemiah had
[3:23:44] been in Jerusalem for 3 days if
[3:23:46] evaluating the situation he gathered
[3:23:48] everyone together he gave a starring
[3:23:50] challenge to the citizens of Jerusalem
[3:23:51] sharing his vision immediately the
[3:23:54] people responded and you know what the
[3:23:56] people said they said let us rise up and
[3:23:59] behold and they began the good work the
[3:24:03] entire third chapter gives a detailed
[3:24:05] worker plan of where now listen where
[3:24:08] each family was involved in rebuilding
[3:24:12] the wall when when nemiah went and told
[3:24:15] the people
[3:24:18] and he told them the vision that God had
[3:24:19] given
[3:24:20] him everyone called The
[3:24:24] Vision let us
[3:24:27] build are you hearing me I'm not
[3:24:30] preaching to dvf
[3:24:32] now whoever is streaming and is not part
[3:24:34] of the ministry
[3:24:38] sorry let us
[3:24:41] build let us
[3:24:44] build are you hearing people said let us
[3:24:49] build the vision
[3:24:51] be gave the vision of the work that God
[3:24:55] had given
[3:24:58] him and then the people
[3:25:00] responded let us
[3:25:03] build all of together all of them
[3:25:06] together as one
[3:25:07] group now there's something I wanted to
[3:25:09] show you here he says each
[3:25:13] family each
[3:25:15] person was
[3:25:17] involved in the rebuilding of the
[3:25:21] wall everyone was
[3:25:24] included from the strongest to the
[3:25:27] weakest from the richest to the
[3:25:31] poorest from the most influential to the
[3:25:35] least
[3:25:37] influential it is almost comical reading
[3:25:41] through vers 8 where it states a man
[3:25:43] named there's a man called uz
[3:25:47] and a man named
[3:25:49] Ania where they were working besides
[3:25:52] each other
[3:25:53] listen but was a rough and tough gold
[3:26:04] smith yes Han's occupation was a
[3:26:07] manufacturer of
[3:26:10] perfumes I want you to see all these
[3:26:13] people they were working together
[3:26:17] you have the one who is making
[3:26:20] perfumes is working side by side by with
[3:26:23] a
[3:26:34] goldi we don't
[3:26:42] know gold smith yes
[3:26:57] now you see these people are working
[3:26:59] side by
[3:27:00] side you find someone who is working in
[3:27:03] media

[3:30:18] forced and be
[3:30:22] begged and be parted on the
[3:30:33] back come let's
[3:30:39] pray it is a very risky
[3:30:43] thing you've not caught the vision
[3:30:47] you've not caught the
[3:30:50] vision if you are going to cast a
[3:30:52] compelling Vision it must be one that
[3:30:55] gets everyone
[3:30:57] involved everyone must be involved a
[3:31:00] church must include the older members
[3:31:02] the younger members the spiritually
[3:31:04] mature the new Christians even the new
[3:31:07] Believers not only the older ones
[3:31:09] everyone must be a part of the vision
[3:31:12] everyone must be a part of it you know
[3:31:14] even the children parents you must teach
[3:31:17] your
[3:31:19] children you know what is a vision a
[3:31:21] vision cannot be accomplished by one
[3:31:25] person but together we can do it in Rec
[3:31:31] time we can accomplish what no one has
[3:31:34] ever
[3:31:36] done you see we need men who have Vision
[3:31:39] who have CAU the vision who
[3:31:42] understand what is going on
[3:31:46] praise the name of the Lord and you you
[3:31:48] are an
[3:31:51] adult and I've been because I've been
[3:31:54] hearing the group team leaders look look
[3:31:57] let me say
[3:31:58] this our
[3:32:00] vision in this
[3:32:02] church is not to build big
[3:32:06] churches and uh you know get a name for
[3:32:10] ourselves our vision is to preach the
[3:32:14] message to take the message
[3:32:17] everywhere but how can we take the
[3:32:19] message
[3:32:21] everywhere when we don't even have a
[3:32:25] home when they kicking us
[3:32:29] out parent go parent or
[3:32:32] go if we are claiming we are preaching
[3:32:34] the
[3:32:35] gospel we must catch the
[3:32:38] vision get land build a
[3:32:42] church if the Lord is coming in 20 years
[3:32:44] you will find when we are finished
[3:32:47] if he's coming in one year you will find
[3:32:49] when we
[3:32:52] trying a vision that we have it's a
[3:32:55] vision that we
[3:32:57] have it's a vision it is a vision it is
[3:33:00] a
[3:33:01] vision we must do this thing it must be
[3:33:07] done you know this this writer said even
[3:33:11] if the one who has received the vision
[3:33:13] stands alone he will is ready to do it
[3:33:18] to do
[3:33:19] it I'm ready to do it but how many will
[3:33:23] do it with
[3:33:24] me how many will catch it we have a
[3:33:28] message unlike any other
[3:33:31] denomination we have a vision to run
[3:33:34] with this
[3:33:37] message we we should
[3:33:40] grow we should come out from being
[3:33:42] called and being pushed and
[3:33:46] to the extent someone has to push you to
[3:33:49] even to come to
[3:33:52] church these days you're not
[3:33:55] coming I will come Pastor it's all
[3:33:59] right you've not caught the
[3:34:03] vision I remember when we were young
[3:34:05] people we used to be so much on
[3:34:08] fire come very early in the morning you
[3:34:12] you sweep the church you clean the
[3:34:15] chairs
[3:34:16] you clean the
[3:34:18] pulpit you look everywhere is everything
[3:34:22] fine and then you begin song
[3:34:27] reading but our younger people here I
[3:34:30] see them arriving many times
[3:34:33] late what are you doing in this
[3:34:35] Vision what are you doing in the work
[3:34:37] that we are doing what is your part that
[3:34:40] you
[3:34:42] playing you must catch the vision
[3:34:46] you as an
[3:34:48] individual and lastly every
[3:34:52] Vision will be
[3:35:01] OPP you know many many people people
[3:35:04] many times people want to do
[3:35:06] things that are not
[3:35:09] opposed when you do something and
[3:35:11] everybody likes it you are happy
[3:35:15] about you do something and now one
[3:35:20] it you know I would say
[3:35:23] this I was talking with Pastor
[3:35:28] Gideon uh as we were coming down back to
[3:35:31] Uganda and I told him say Pastor if you
[3:35:35] counted all the churches of the
[3:35:38] message that in
[3:35:42] Uganda and say
[3:35:45] let us uh ask each of the
[3:35:51] members to collect a sum of
[3:35:55] [Music]
[3:35:57] money and within a
[3:36:00] year we
[3:36:04] counted we can be able to
[3:36:07] get maybe 1.2 billion
[3:36:10] shs think about it brother Andre
[3:36:16] and with all these churches without even
[3:36:23] buildings without even land like
[3:36:26] us renting they 50 here 100
[3:36:30] here
[3:36:32] 200 and we we many churches res to
[3:36:37] begging from
[3:36:41] abroad what I'm saying we have more than
[3:36:44] we need
[3:36:49] I'm delivering my heart to you this
[3:36:51] morning we have more than we need we
[3:36:55] have more than we need but we don't
[3:36:58] we've not caught the
[3:37:00] vision that's the only
[3:37:03] problem okay if we brought that proposal
[3:37:05] do you think people will buy
[3:37:09] it how many churches will buy
[3:37:12] it it is easier for them to write in
[3:37:14] Canada to write in America right
[3:37:17] inmany let us get help
[3:37:20] us help our poor
[3:37:22] ones who are the poor ones we are not
[3:37:29] poor no we are not poor we are only not
[3:37:33] catching the
[3:37:35] vision many of you younger people you
[3:37:38] are now in
[3:37:40] Holiday what are you
[3:37:43] doing you sleep
[3:37:45] you eat you sleep again you eat you
[3:37:48] sleep again you are
[3:37:50] lazy La go out find a
[3:37:55] job this is from a past I told
[3:37:59] you find a
[3:38:02] job support the
[3:38:04] Vision support the work of
[3:38:08] God support the work of
[3:38:10] God the reason why we preach the gospel
[3:38:14] is because we are conv the gospel is
[3:38:16] true
[3:38:19] period this message is the
[3:38:22] truth let me tell you nothing is going
[3:38:25] to stop it we are going to take it
[3:38:28] everywhere nothing will stop
[3:38:32] it but the need is
[3:38:34] great but we have to cat the
[3:38:37] vision you yourself you have to ask
[3:38:39] yourself what can I
[3:38:43] do what can I do
[3:38:46] we have books we are printing
[3:38:49] here Brethren from other continents have
[3:38:52] to send
[3:38:55] money for
[3:38:58] printing it is a shame on us as
[3:39:02] Believers in
[3:39:05] ug
[3:39:06] translation they have S money to support
[3:39:11] translators and when they
[3:39:13] stop the translation stop
[3:39:18] let me ask you a question who benefits
[3:39:21] from the
[3:39:23] translations is it not
[3:39:25] ugandans is it not
[3:39:28] ugandans why then are ugandans not able
[3:39:32] to support
[3:39:42] the who is poor raise up your hand I'll
[3:39:44] pray for you
[3:39:45] the demon of
[3:39:46] poverty up
[3:39:49] your no one is poor
[3:39:52] here no one is poor and let me tell you
[3:39:55] you will never have all that you need
[3:39:57] for
[3:40:00] everything we walk by
[3:40:03] faith God provides for the journey as we
[3:40:08] move but the work of God should be
[3:40:10] number
[3:40:12] one everything you are doing but but
[3:40:15] what happens we don't have the unity of
[3:40:20] purpose yes it is not there that's all
[3:40:24] we need you need we need to be United in
[3:40:30] purpose
[3:40:32] United let us all do this let us all do
[3:40:36] this this is the right thing to do let
[3:40:38] us all do it if it's a prayer meeting
[3:40:41] let us all
[3:40:42] go if it's collecting for supporting our
[3:40:45] work let us all do it if for whatever we
[3:40:48] have to do let's do
[3:40:50] it why because we are given a
[3:40:55] commission as we all stand on and we let
[3:40:58] us read Matthew
[3:41:09] 28 vers um
[3:41:13] 19 go you there teach All Nations
[3:41:16] baptizing them in the name of the father
[3:41:17] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[3:41:19] teaching them to observe all things
[3:41:21] whatsoever I have Commit commanded you
[3:41:23] and L I Am With You Always even until
[3:41:26] the end of the world so he said we
[3:41:28] should go and teach All
[3:41:32] Nations we should make in other we
[3:41:34] should make disciples of all the as
[3:41:37] musicians come of all the
[3:41:41] nations we should take the gospel to All
[3:41:44] Nations
[3:41:46] All
[3:41:47] Nations All
[3:41:50] Nations I want it to come to your
[3:41:51] knowledge All
[3:41:54] Nations All
[3:42:00] Nations All Nations so it is a must for
[3:42:06] us to take whose responsibility is it he
[3:42:10] that has
[3:42:12] believed so I know people would say oh
[3:42:15] we have not even
[3:42:17] finished collecting for our church
[3:42:20] land now we are very busy running to
[3:42:22] start another fellowship somewhere
[3:42:26] another we will a thousand of
[3:42:30] them the work we are given is to go to
[3:42:34] All
[3:42:35] Nations but you see this Vision that we
[3:42:38] have we cannot do it alone I cannot do
[3:42:41] it alone we need people to cat the
[3:42:44] vision
[3:42:47] and ask yourself a
[3:42:49] question what can I
[3:42:52] do as you bow your
[3:42:57] heads Lord
[3:43:00] Jesus you have given us a great burden
[3:43:04] in our
[3:43:07] hearts you've called us out of the
[3:43:09] denominations
[3:43:16] not to start another
[3:43:20] religion but you have called
[3:43:22] us to take this
[3:43:26] gospel to all the
[3:43:30] nations but the question
[3:43:34] is what can we
[3:43:38] do maybe someone will be able to
[3:43:43] pray maybe someone can wait upon the
[3:43:48] Lord and pray for the work of
[3:43:51] God pray for the pastors the
[3:43:57] Min pray for the
[3:44:00] musicians maybe someone will say I can
[3:44:03] do
[3:44:04] that I can do this everyone according to
[3:44:08] their
[3:44:10] abilities and doing it with all their
[3:44:13] hearts
[3:44:16] knowing that the
[3:44:18] day is f running
[3:44:22] out Christ is about to come back
[3:44:25] again we have little time
[3:44:28] left we need to consecrate ourselves
[3:44:33] more yield ourself
[3:44:35] more allow you to use us
[3:44:41] more father I pray for someone here
[3:44:43] today
[3:44:47] that in their hearts they have a
[3:44:49] desire for you to use
[3:44:54] them Lord I pray that you will give
[3:44:57] leadership you'll give
[3:45:01] direction that your
[3:45:03] grace will undertake for
[3:45:07] them you will give them
[3:45:11] ability you'll give them strength
[3:45:15] that they will be able to know your
[3:45:18] will they will be able to go in prayer
[3:45:21] because that is where we find the
[3:45:26] vision what can I
[3:45:29] do if everyone just go in prayer and ask
[3:45:32] the Lord what can I
[3:45:35] do have I done my
[3:45:39] best is there not more that I can do for
[3:45:41] the Lord
