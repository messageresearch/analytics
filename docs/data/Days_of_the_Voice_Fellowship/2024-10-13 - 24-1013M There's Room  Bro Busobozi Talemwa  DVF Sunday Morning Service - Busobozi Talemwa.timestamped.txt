[1:27:16] 24 and Isaac digged
[1:27:19] again okay I can begin from 17 and Isaac
[1:27:22] departed then and
[1:27:24] I think my sound would need to be fine
[1:27:26] tuned a little bit maybe increased a
[1:27:29] little bit and Isaac departed then and
[1:27:33] pitched his tent in the valley of gual
[1:27:36] and dwelt there and Isaac digged again
[1:27:39] the whals of water which they had digged
[1:27:41] in the days of Abraham his father for
[1:27:45] the Philistines had stopped them after
[1:27:47] the death of Abraham and he called their
[1:27:50] names after the names by which his
[1:27:53] father had called them and Isaac's
[1:27:56] servant digged in the valley and found
[1:27:58] there a well of springing water and the
[1:28:02] hadman of Geral did strive with Isaac's
[1:28:05] hadman saying the water is ours and he
[1:28:08] called the name of the well esek because
[1:28:12] they strove with him and they digged
[1:28:14] another well and strove for that also
[1:28:17] and he called the name of it sitner and
[1:28:20] he removed from then and digged another
[1:28:23] well and for that they strove not and he
[1:28:26] called the name of it reoboth and he
[1:28:29] said for now the Lord has made room for
[1:28:32] us and we shall be fruitful in the
[1:28:36] land
[1:28:53] amen
[1:29:23] for for
[1:29:56] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[1:29:58] bless the reading of the
[1:30:14] word uh first of all i' would like to
[1:30:17] appreci and I'd like you to join me to
[1:30:19] appreciate uh sister Angela who the Lord
[1:30:22] used to buy the other third FL
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:32] we we appreciate your
[1:30:34] giving amen and there are three things
[1:30:36] that I wanted to talk about
[1:30:39] today but I'll talk uh about two of them
[1:30:43] at the end of the
[1:30:46] service uh
[1:30:49] yes I talk about the two of them at the
[1:30:52] end of the service
[1:30:55] one is about the land
[1:31:01] fund and the other for our youth
[1:31:03] upcoming Youth
[1:31:05] Camp so I talk I'll address those at the
[1:31:09] end of the
[1:31:11] service but for now I just wanted to say
[1:31:13] that we've had a wonderful
[1:31:17] week and the Lord laid it on my
[1:31:21] heart uh to do a little more or
[1:31:28] evangelism but you see I believe that
[1:31:30] it's it's not resting on the on the
[1:31:33] shoulders of the pastor
[1:31:36] alone I believe it is resting on all our
[1:31:40] shoulders it is not my burden it is our
[1:31:44] burden of course I'm speaking to those
[1:31:46] who have been called by the Lord and are
[1:31:51] saved and if you're born again
[1:31:54] then you should have a burden for the
[1:31:55] lost
[1:31:57] souls and so we felt that um we need to
[1:32:00] do a little more
[1:32:03] evangelism to reach out to more
[1:32:06] souls about with this message of the
[1:32:09] AR and so we started um what we call
[1:32:13] home
[1:32:15] sales so we decided to bring Church
[1:32:18] closer to the
[1:32:21] Believers and already there are many
[1:32:23] testimonies coming out of
[1:32:26] it um the different
[1:32:30] cells and these are scattered all across
[1:32:33] the
[1:32:35] city and wherever our brothers and
[1:32:38] sisters from this church are
[1:32:42] coming and um on
[1:32:44] Monday uh I was I had an opportunity to
[1:32:47] go and I was with this with the
[1:32:50] Believers who are fellow who go to
[1:32:52] school at ucu
[1:32:58] and um we met the sister peace who goes
[1:33:02] to school
[1:33:05] there and brother nille I think both of
[1:33:07] them are not here this
[1:33:10] morning so brother neille is is he lost
[1:33:15] somebody so he went for bu
[1:33:19] the and so uh the Believers there have
[1:33:22] gathered their friends Gathering their
[1:33:24] friends every
[1:33:27] Monday and so they invited me so I am
[1:33:30] the one taking care of that Fellowship
[1:33:34] there and we we are expecting God to do
[1:33:37] a
[1:33:39] lot we we we preached I think we on
[1:33:41] Monday we had more more than 10
[1:33:46] people uh being our first
[1:33:49] day so I believe more souls will hear
[1:33:52] this message
[1:33:55] that school has 11 I think I was told an
[1:33:58] estimate of about 11,000
[1:34:02] people I believe that God will reach out
[1:34:05] to many many with this
[1:34:10] message this message is not for us to
[1:34:13] sleep on and
[1:34:16] die you know God must bring in the very
[1:34:19] last
[1:34:21] one every predestinated child of God
[1:34:23] should
[1:34:26] come wherever they are God will find
[1:34:29] them and brother and also brother Marvin
[1:34:33] was ministering to the Saints in
[1:34:38] mukono um I received a good testimony
[1:34:40] out of
[1:34:42] there how they were blessed at they
[1:34:45] gathering at sister Esther's
[1:34:48] home God bless s eser who opened your
[1:34:50] home for that
[1:34:53] they they I think they had um I was told
[1:34:55] a few new people I think two three three
[1:34:59] yes three new people so those are three
[1:35:02] new Souls who had the message for the
[1:35:04] first
[1:35:07] time at the University we had about also
[1:35:10] four
[1:35:12] new and also brother Jo ministered
[1:35:16] in
[1:35:19] place and then also we were I think was
[1:35:22] that on on Thursday in
[1:35:26] innd uh we had a good time there we had
[1:35:30] seven new I don't remember how many were
[1:35:32] they sister
[1:35:33] G you don't remember it was at Dr M's
[1:35:38] place they invited all their
[1:35:41] neighbors and we we we met somewhere
[1:35:44] there's a gentleman who has an office
[1:35:46] there but he has a good field so he gave
[1:35:49] it to us a good compound
[1:35:54] but we agreed with brother M and
[1:35:58] others this this next
[1:36:01] Thursday we shall not do it
[1:36:04] there you know he has a clinic there we
[1:36:08] want to and it's right on the
[1:36:10] road we want to do it right in front at
[1:36:13] the at the
[1:36:15] road and we want to get
[1:36:18] speakers so we shall be preaching and
[1:36:20] speaking when everyone there whether you
[1:36:22] want to hear or not you are hearing the
[1:36:27] message and I thought that was a good
[1:36:30] idea so that's what we are intending to
[1:36:32] do by God's grace on
[1:36:35] Thursday and we don't have that speaker
[1:36:37] so if you want to buy that
[1:36:40] speaker or speakers more than one you're
[1:36:43] welcome to do
[1:36:44] that we had one but I think it got
[1:36:47] issues so I believe that the Lord will
[1:36:50] will do will do wonderful things
[1:36:52] there and then on Friday we were in at
[1:36:56] in
[1:36:58] ch brother where brother Alan
[1:37:02] lives and we we had um uh I think one
[1:37:06] new person and several Believers
[1:37:10] there we were all together I think in
[1:37:12] that Fellowship that day did we get to
[1:37:14] 15 probably 10 to 15
[1:37:17] people and um this sister asked a lot of
[1:37:20] questions I believe she will come to the
[1:37:21] message this lady
[1:37:26] and brother Dan also was at
[1:37:32] in uh what's the name of the
[1:37:37] brother where's brother brother Mandela
[1:37:40] yes over at brother Mandela's
[1:37:43] house and I was told they also had a
[1:37:46] wonderful
[1:37:47] time uh sister Agatha was there as
[1:37:51] well Enoch so if you are coming from an
[1:37:55] area where you don't have any Fellowship
[1:37:58] during the
[1:37:59] week by the mar they
[1:38:02] met in in G I don't remember the day but
[1:38:08] they usually meet in
[1:38:09] G and I was told they also had a good
[1:38:13] time and um also on
[1:38:18] Friday Brother Martin went and
[1:38:20] ministered over at sister Rose's house
[1:38:25] and I was told it was wonderful
[1:38:27] there about 60 neighbors
[1:38:32] came and they had the
[1:38:34] message and they loved the message and
[1:38:37] as soon as brother Mar finished
[1:38:41] preaching there is a a young lady I
[1:38:43] don't know whether she's here that my
[1:38:44] mom lives
[1:38:46] with and
[1:38:49] um uh you know she came from the village
[1:38:52] with a familiar
[1:38:57] spirit that has been troubling
[1:38:59] her for a while so she came in
[1:39:03] here we cast it out and she became
[1:39:08] fine and then you know um um so then
[1:39:12] she's been fine for a
[1:39:14] while and so Sister Rose decided to
[1:39:17] begin living at at
[1:39:20] home because of different reasons
[1:39:24] and so for a while I think about two
[1:39:26] weeks and those demons recollected
[1:39:30] themselves they came back and began to
[1:39:33] meting so for for some time think about
[1:39:36] a week so Brother Martin went and
[1:39:40] preached uh this Friday after finishing
[1:39:43] the
[1:39:45] summer everybody was happy and new
[1:39:49] people were there and they asked them do
[1:39:52] you have any question
[1:39:54] anybody with any question and before
[1:39:57] they could even raise up their
[1:39:59] hand this Spirit came on this girl so
[1:40:03] heav and you know she fell down and lied
[1:40:07] as though dead and so Brother Martin was
[1:40:11] he said a battle was raging in him
[1:40:12] should I pray for her or I just leave
[1:40:14] her I continue the
[1:40:17] service and then he say he kind of felt
[1:40:20] I should pray for
[1:40:21] her so he went to lay he was closing his
[1:40:25] eyes so you went to lay the hand on
[1:40:28] her and this Spirit was so angry with
[1:40:33] brother
[1:40:33] M so it came with a big blow to
[1:40:37] him give him a big blow and then he
[1:40:40] realized hey what's happening here so
[1:40:43] and it was really a very intense
[1:40:48] battle and so this he gave me the
[1:40:51] testimony and I was so amazed by what
[1:40:53] God Our God can
[1:40:55] do and so this Spirit began talking and
[1:41:00] manifesting so you people thought you
[1:41:02] had cast me
[1:41:04] out I have come
[1:41:07] back and you know your Jesus does not
[1:41:09] have
[1:41:10] power and so Brother Martin would talk
[1:41:13] and this
[1:41:14] talk and so he prayed and cast out the
[1:41:18] and so he was wondering there are
[1:41:19] unbelievers
[1:41:21] here so what if this does not go they
[1:41:25] will all say your Jesus is not
[1:41:28] powerful but I tell you our Jesus is
[1:41:32] powerful amen am there is no demon or
[1:41:35] there is no power that is beyond our the
[1:41:38] name of our Lord
[1:41:41] Jesus the devil will fight all
[1:41:44] right you know but let me tell you he
[1:41:47] can never
[1:41:49] win because our Jesus is stronger
[1:41:53] because the word we believe is powerful
[1:41:56] more
[1:41:57] powerful the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:42:01] not it pulls down every
[1:42:05] stronghold and so that demon
[1:42:08] left after a big intense
[1:42:13] battle and SS like Brother Martin you
[1:42:16] see that's where Jesus sent two by
[1:42:19] two I said Wherever I Go
[1:42:23] I I don't go
[1:42:24] alone I go with a
[1:42:27] brother so you brothers that are
[1:42:30] ministering in this
[1:42:32] places go with
[1:42:34] somebody go with
[1:42:37] reinforcement but also as a church we
[1:42:40] should pray for the
[1:42:42] ministry we should pray for the vision
[1:42:44] that God has given
[1:42:46] us burden that we have you know there
[1:42:49] are many things that look like as if it
[1:42:51] will be defeated
[1:42:54] but the purpose of God cannot be
[1:42:59] defeated what God has thought will be
[1:43:03] perfected and it will surely come to
[1:43:06] pass and and so with those things I just
[1:43:09] want to go to the
[1:43:12] word and this morning I'm speaking on
[1:43:14] there is
[1:43:18] room Gathering
[1:43:21] Souls not building a
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:27] denomination tell someone Gathering
[1:43:30] Souls not building a
[1:43:34] denomination and so you see this man
[1:43:38] here
[1:43:39] Isaac digged again the wells of water
[1:43:42] which they had digged in the days of
[1:43:44] Abraham his
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:49] father and you know they were buried and
[1:43:51] they were there and they were dead for a
[1:43:53] long
[1:43:57] time but as soon as he came to dig them
[1:44:01] up the Philistines came
[1:44:04] out you know the Bible says the
[1:44:07] Philistines had stopped these
[1:44:11] Wells when Abraham died and so they when
[1:44:16] Isaac came up to dig them
[1:44:20] again um you know water began coming out
[1:44:25] and so the Hard Men of this
[1:44:29] place came against the hadman the the
[1:44:32] hadman of
[1:44:36] Isaac and they began to say this this
[1:44:39] water is
[1:44:41] ours and you know Isaac did not debate
[1:44:45] with
[1:44:46] them did not strive with
[1:44:48] them he simply left
[1:44:51] them to continue knew owning what they
[1:44:54] thought they
[1:44:56] owned and he called the name of that
[1:44:59] place the name of that well
[1:45:03] is because they strove with
[1:45:06] him and they died another
[1:45:09] well and this when he dig another
[1:45:11] well then these people came again they
[1:45:15] said this one is also
[1:45:17] ours brother never strive with
[1:45:20] anyone never strive with no
[1:45:24] what God has given
[1:45:27] you amen can
[1:45:29] multiply the blessing that God has given
[1:45:32] you can
[1:45:34] multiply you find people fighting for
[1:45:38] land a portion and each of them is
[1:45:41] fighting for it and sometimes they even
[1:45:43] kill each other you see the blessing of
[1:45:46] God
[1:45:48] make and he adds no
[1:45:51] sorrow amen and if so God wants to bless
[1:45:55] you he will bless you in the
[1:45:58] city and he will bless you in the
[1:46:01] village no matter where you go if
[1:46:04] someone is fighting for something that
[1:46:05] belongs to
[1:46:07] you don't worry it is flourishing
[1:46:11] because of
[1:46:12] you you didn't hear me it is flourishing
[1:46:16] because of
[1:46:18] you so what you simply need to do is to
[1:46:21] walk away
[1:46:23] don't fight with no man on any
[1:46:27] issue are you hearing me don't ever
[1:46:30] fight with
[1:46:32] anyone if someone is fighting for
[1:46:35] something let them have it because the
[1:46:38] blessing of God rests with
[1:46:41] you it is not in the place it is in you
[1:46:46] you know there is nothing like a holy
[1:46:49] place there is nothing like a holy
[1:46:51] mountain
[1:46:53] there is nothing like a holy you know
[1:46:55] you know
[1:46:57] Church there is only a holy
[1:47:00] God and wherever holy God
[1:47:03] is that place is
[1:47:06] Holy if God is on the mountain it is a
[1:47:09] Holy Mountain if God is in the church it
[1:47:13] is a holy church if God is in a village
[1:47:16] it is a holy Village if God is in a land
[1:47:19] it is a holy land wherever he is
[1:47:23] that place is
[1:47:25] Holy and now what about if God is in a
[1:47:29] person you are a holy person the Bible
[1:47:33] says you are a holy
[1:47:36] PRI so whenever you go you are the one
[1:47:39] taking with yourself the Holiness of
[1:47:43] God I am the embodiment of the power of
[1:47:49] God the favor of God the blessing of God
[1:47:54] wherever I go there will be
[1:47:57] Prosperity why because I am a son of
[1:48:02] prosperity you are a child of
[1:48:05] prosperity never accept to be reduced
[1:48:08] down to fight for
[1:48:11] things whatever God has given you is in
[1:48:15] you not in the
[1:48:16] thing hallelujah amen and so they Str
[1:48:20] with the world they Str with another
[1:48:22] world
[1:48:24] and he said okay I'll leave it to you
[1:48:26] and I will move
[1:48:28] on and God will bless me any and so he
[1:48:32] went and dug another
[1:48:33] whale and no one came up to fight
[1:48:36] for and he said all right I'll call this
[1:48:40] one
[1:48:42] theob which
[1:48:44] means amen God has now the Lord has made
[1:48:48] room for
[1:48:51] us everybody tell your but God has made
[1:48:55] room there is
[1:48:58] room
[1:49:00] Hallelujah I just want to take this in a
[1:49:02] certain
[1:49:03] way and I pray that that the Lord will
[1:49:07] help us to bring
[1:49:09] it now I'm going to quote for you
[1:49:11] several quotes and scriptures so listen
[1:49:13] in the message God is provided
[1:49:16] way brother bam says that's about like
[1:49:20] our Pentecostal churches today
[1:49:24] one of them says glory to
[1:49:26] God I belong to the Assemblies of
[1:49:29] God the other one says I am the Church
[1:49:33] of
[1:49:34] God and the other one says me I am UPC
[1:49:40] United another one says me I am
[1:49:43] Ang I am that or the other you keep
[1:49:47] grumbling and God is God God cut the
[1:49:50] water off from you
[1:49:54] there is something I want you to see
[1:49:56] today even what we are doing the
[1:49:58] evangelism and going there what is our
[1:50:07] vision what are we trying to
[1:50:09] do what is our
[1:50:12] job this what I want to impress upon
[1:50:14] your hearts this
[1:50:16] morning what is the purpose of this
[1:50:19] message is it to build another
[1:50:21] denomination
[1:50:23] is it to build to make another
[1:50:26] organization what is this
[1:50:29] about you know it used to be some years
[1:50:34] ago Believers of the message used one
[1:50:42] license um because you see to operate a
[1:50:48] church you need to have a legal require
[1:50:51] I mean the legal requirement to operate
[1:50:52] a church is a
[1:50:58] license because you can't just well you
[1:51:01] have we have freedom of
[1:51:03] worship but you see we we have to be
[1:51:06] known by the
[1:51:08] government how does the government know
[1:51:10] us who are we so then we we we we we put
[1:51:15] up some articles of Association and
[1:51:17] things like
[1:51:19] that and then we tell the government
[1:51:22] is who we
[1:51:24] are this is what we believe and we want
[1:51:27] to come together into an
[1:51:31] association just stay focused here and
[1:51:34] so we want to have to be in a fellowship
[1:51:37] of and we want to to run a
[1:51:40] church and so the government says okay
[1:51:44] so in other words for them to know we
[1:51:45] are not some kind of
[1:51:48] terrorist oh we are not a political
[1:51:51] party
[1:51:53] but we are just
[1:51:55] Christians you know this requirements of
[1:51:57] having a
[1:52:02] license no the requirement of having a
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:12] license is not required by
[1:52:16] God God does not require us to have a
[1:52:19] license to run a church
[1:52:24] God does not require us to have a
[1:52:25] license to preach the
[1:52:28] gospel in the Bible they gathered in
[1:52:31] homes of
[1:52:33] Believers every day and then on Sunday
[1:52:37] they all met together and that's what we
[1:52:40] are trying to
[1:52:41] do We Gather in homes of
[1:52:44] Believers and then we meet
[1:52:46] together that's all God
[1:52:48] requires and it requires you to be
[1:52:50] filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:52:52] that's all it requires but because we
[1:52:55] are part of a
[1:52:57] country which has a
[1:52:59] constitution we need to have a
[1:53:03] license we need to be permitted by the
[1:53:05] government to
[1:53:08] operate and so in in the in the first
[1:53:11] years you would find that Believers
[1:53:13] simply would just go to a church which
[1:53:15] is
[1:53:17] registered and say can can I have your
[1:53:20] license
[1:53:23] and the things I'm going to be talking
[1:53:24] about are very important please don't
[1:53:28] do if it does I will embarrass
[1:53:31] you I've warned you I'll call out your
[1:53:34] name and I say brother stop sister stop
[1:53:39] do praise the name of the Lord because
[1:53:42] this what I'm speaking about is very
[1:53:44] important okay and if you on the
[1:53:46] internet you are doing a
[1:53:49] hope you not wasting your internet for
[1:53:51] nothing
[1:53:54] all right so the the requirement of the
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] government is for us to have a
[1:54:02] license but we don't the word of God
[1:54:05] doesn't require us to have
[1:54:08] one so to to have a license you also
[1:54:11] need to have a
[1:54:14] name a name you run
[1:54:17] by so you say well me I'll be called um
[1:54:21] so and so redeemed
[1:54:26] Church oh like for us we said we will be
[1:54:28] called we took a scripture in Revelation
[1:54:30] 107 says Shall be Called days of the
[1:54:37] voice so we said we are days of the
[1:54:39] voice
[1:54:41] Ministries another one will go take
[1:54:43] another name and say I am this I am
[1:54:46] that I'm trying to draw your
[1:54:49] attention that those things are not
[1:54:51] important to
[1:54:54] it is just for the government for the
[1:54:56] legal
[1:54:59] requirement but you see in the first
[1:55:02] Believers would even use one
[1:55:07] license but that is also not
[1:55:11] important whether we using one license
[1:55:14] or we using 100
[1:55:17] license that doesn't
[1:55:19] matter what matters is the message we
[1:55:22] are
[1:55:24] preaching what matters is the gospel we
[1:55:27] are
[1:55:29] propagating that that is what
[1:55:31] differentiates us from the
[1:55:34] denominations there is a truth I want to
[1:55:37] share with you
[1:55:38] today and I want you to be
[1:55:41] sober and not miss what I'm going to
[1:55:43] share with you this morning and so
[1:55:45] brother bam says you know he was trying
[1:55:49] to type these Wells
[1:55:54] you know the whales that they
[1:55:57] dug and these people kept on fighting
[1:55:59] for
[1:56:00] them and he said it's like the these
[1:56:04] Pentecostal churches
[1:56:07] today they are so proud of being those
[1:56:13] names you know mine is called Church of
[1:56:16] God m is Assemblies of God and these
[1:56:19] days even in the message churches
[1:56:22] in some unlearned
[1:56:25] men you find that they think that having
[1:56:28] those I mean those names are
[1:56:31] important those names are not important
[1:56:34] to
[1:56:35] God whether you are called
[1:56:37] DVS or you are called you know the names
[1:56:41] of the churches and message that you
[1:56:42] know here in
[1:56:44] Uganda it doesn't matter to God but
[1:56:48] these people they thought that that was
[1:56:49] what is important
[1:56:52] and they began you know it says they
[1:56:54] began
[1:56:56] grumbling but you see it says God had
[1:56:59] already cut off the water from
[1:57:03] them you know when they came and began
[1:57:05] grumbling for these
[1:57:08] Wells you know Isaac had already moved
[1:57:11] away and the water went with
[1:57:15] him it is not about the
[1:57:19] well it is about the water in the well
[1:57:24] it's not about your church
[1:57:26] name it's about the amen the gospel the
[1:57:29] message you
[1:57:32] propag and so they began
[1:57:34] Grambling this is ours this is ours it
[1:57:38] is our water he said okay it is yours it
[1:57:42] is all right you can continue with it
[1:57:45] and he dug another and when they saw he
[1:57:49] had gone away and D another one
[1:57:52] maybe this water dried
[1:57:54] up and they and they saw him having
[1:57:58] water
[1:57:59] there no this is also
[1:58:01] ours said oh you also want no
[1:58:05] problem and another let me tell you it
[1:58:09] is not about the
[1:58:11] whale it's about the water in
[1:58:14] there and he said he let them to
[1:58:18] Grumble but God had already cut off the
[1:58:21] water
[1:58:24] what denominationalism
[1:58:27] does it cuts off the flow of the
[1:58:34] water that is why we are not a
[1:58:37] denomination why are we doing
[1:58:40] evangelism why are we preaching we are
[1:58:43] not trying to start another
[1:58:46] denomination we are only Gathering the
[1:58:50] bride we are gathering

[2:02:04] your
[2:02:07] God for it looks like the gates may open
[2:02:10] into the promised land
[2:02:15] soon how many believe that the gates are
[2:02:18] opening anytime
[2:02:20] soon let go in with a true singing and
[2:02:24] [Music]
[2:02:26] rejoicing when the bride and groom takes
[2:02:28] his place at the
[2:02:31] throne he says brother listen leave
[2:02:35] humble leave
[2:02:37] loving leave one
[2:02:40] another love one another brother don't

[2:02:48] you if you see something coming up in in
[2:02:52] your heart against
[2:02:55] somebody get it out from their right
[2:03:00] then and Satan will do his best to get
[2:03:03] among
[2:03:06] you don't you let that
[2:03:09] happen sat want you know let me tell you
[2:03:13] Church there is one thing the devil
[2:03:15] cannot
[2:03:17] do the devil cannot stop the water the
[2:03:21] flow of the water
[2:03:24] the devil cannot
[2:03:26] fight with what God has
[2:03:29] done and what God has done he he has
[2:03:32] brought the message to
[2:03:34] us but what does the devil do he comes
[2:03:38] in among the people who have received a
[2:03:41] message and he tries to make them you
[2:03:45] know Hur one
[2:03:47] another try to bring
[2:03:50] bitterness and you find some people
[2:03:53] speaking as though they are the only
[2:03:55] ones who have access to
[2:03:58] Heaven There is no one human being has
[2:04:01] access to
[2:04:04] Heaven not even our Prophet
[2:04:07] brother he did not have the the access
[2:04:10] to
[2:04:11] Heaven only one man has access or rather
[2:04:15] gives
[2:04:16] access his name is Jesus
[2:04:20] Christ and as long as a
[2:04:22] preacher is preaching the
[2:04:25] message then he has the key then he has
[2:04:28] the access for the
[2:04:30] people but there is no one who can stand
[2:04:34] up and say if you are not in my
[2:04:38] church you are not going to the
[2:04:42] Rapture
[2:04:44] Hallelujah the Catholics say only the
[2:04:47] Catholics will go to
[2:04:49] the the anglicans say only the
[2:04:53] angc the Pentecostal say only
[2:04:56] Pentecostal even among them they have
[2:05:00] divisions each of them say our group is
[2:05:03] the one
[2:05:04] going but I will tell you my brother my
[2:05:07] sister this message has told us love
[2:05:13] everybody leave
[2:05:16] humble if you see something coming in
[2:05:18] your heart against somebody
[2:05:22] get it out of your
[2:05:25] heart it is only the
[2:05:27] message which is the word of God that
[2:05:31] will will have will open access to
[2:05:33] Heaven
[2:05:36] people no one single denomination
[2:05:40] has now imagine a Believer who is coming
[2:05:45] from Days of the voice
[2:05:47] Fellowship claiming our
[2:05:50] church days of the The Voice Fellowship
[2:05:53] is the only one taking people to the
[2:05:55] r what about another brother coming from
[2:05:58] inner
[2:05:59] Veil Fellowship fellow it means he will
[2:06:03] not
[2:06:04] go I thank God for this
[2:06:07] message because it has made us
[2:06:11] understand it is not about the
[2:06:14] we it's about the
[2:06:16] water if your has the water
[2:06:22] right and that's why we should love one
[2:06:26] another Believers are not only
[2:06:29] here there are believers all over the
[2:06:33] world there are people almost
[2:06:36] everywhere whose hearts are all
[2:06:40] afame with the fire that fell at
[2:06:43] Pentecost which cleansed and made them
[2:06:47] clean it is burning now within my heart

[2:07:18] brothers we should love them we should
[2:07:22] fellowship with
[2:07:24] them the spirit of
[2:07:27] bitterness is not of
[2:07:33] God and I want to show you
[2:07:35] today the spirit of
[2:07:38] bitterness is connected to a spirit of
[2:07:46] denomination the spirit of
[2:07:48] bitterness is what made Roman
[2:07:53] Catholicism to kill
[2:07:56] people because they did something that
[2:07:59] their Church did not
[2:08:03] accept imagine a man like William
[2:08:07] tindel he translated the
[2:08:10] scriptures into English and at that time
[2:08:14] it was not
[2:08:16] permitted by the Roman Catholic Church
[2:08:21] to translate scriptures into a lay man's
[2:08:26] language it was not even permitted for
[2:08:28] anyone to read
[2:08:30] it but God anointed a
[2:08:33] man his name was William
[2:08:36] Tinder and he went against what the
[2:08:38] church was
[2:08:40] saying and he did what the word was
[2:08:44] saying brother we are not under control
[2:08:48] of any church system
[2:08:52] the mess has liberated
[2:08:55] us the mess has delivered
[2:08:59] us the only one who has authority over
[2:09:04] us is the word and the Holy
[2:09:09] Spirit and that man went
[2:09:13] R according to
[2:09:15] them and he decided to translate the
[2:09:18] scriptures so they said because you have
[2:09:21] gone the church
[2:09:24] doctr we are going to kill
[2:09:27] you he said all right no problem you can
[2:09:31] go ahead they tied him on a stick and
[2:09:35] put firewood on his
[2:09:37] feet and they lit that
[2:09:40] fire and the man burnt
[2:09:43] away but I'll tell you something they
[2:09:46] can kill the
[2:09:48] flesh they cannot kill the soul
[2:09:52] as long as it is well with your
[2:09:55] soul the system May discard
[2:09:58] you the system May reject
[2:10:01] you but you see there is a well of
[2:10:05] water springing out from
[2:10:09] you amen it's a Well of Living
[2:10:14] Water and sat will try to even among the
[2:10:17] message
[2:10:19] Believers he has tried to bring in to
[2:10:22] creep in with that
[2:10:25] spein and try to separate
[2:10:28] Brotherhood the moment you find
[2:10:31] people beginning to
[2:10:34] think that our church is the best our
[2:10:37] pastor is the best that's a wrong Spirit
[2:10:41] coming is the wrong Spirit
[2:10:44] friends I hope you never have it
[2:10:48] here it's the wrong spirit
[2:10:51] you should always have this in your
[2:10:54] mind the message we have is the truth
[2:10:58] the spirit we have received the spirit
[2:11:01] of God that is our
[2:11:08] absolute don't you let that happen he
[2:11:11] said some sck Tong
[2:11:17] fellow might come along and try to take
[2:11:20] you away from it
[2:11:23] you think they could talk Moses out of
[2:11:26] the presence of
[2:11:28] [Music]
[2:11:30] God where he had been there and he had
[2:11:33] seen
[2:11:34] it is there anyone who can talk us out
[2:11:37] of the presence of
[2:11:41] God there is no one who can talk us out
[2:11:43] of the
[2:11:45] presence hallelujah amen Moses no one
[2:11:48] could talk him about
[2:11:52] we don't take from it or we don't add to
[2:11:55] it just keep it in the way the Lord
[2:12:00] said we don't want no
[2:12:04] denomination we don't want no
[2:12:07] denomination we don't want no
[2:12:10] organizations we don't want no
[2:12:13] malice we don't want no
[2:12:15] stri we want
[2:12:17] God and he is the word
[2:12:21] come on shout it we want
[2:12:24] God he is the
[2:12:26] one that's why we have come
[2:12:28] out out of organization out of
[2:12:32] denominations the Bible says come out of
[2:12:34] her my
[2:12:36] people don't be partakers of our
[2:12:39] sins we have come out of
[2:12:42] denominations we have been
[2:12:44] liberated we have been set free we have
[2:12:47] been filled with the Holy Ghost we are
[2:12:49] being prepared
[2:12:52] The Chariot of
[2:12:53] fire is coming down soon soon and very
[2:12:57] soon we shall see the
[2:13:00] king because he's coming down and I'm
[2:13:03] going up I said he coming down and I'm
[2:13:07] going up are you going
[2:13:10] to if you are not excited by
[2:13:14] that then I don't know if you know what
[2:13:16] I'm talking
[2:13:17] about but if you know what I'm talking
[2:13:20] about will move your heart it will
[2:13:23] excite your soul because you will
[2:13:26] realize you are like an eego soon and
[2:13:30] very soon you are going to
[2:13:33] fly out of this world they will ask you
[2:13:38] are you a Catholic no are you Anglican
[2:13:42] no are you Pentecostal Organization no
[2:13:47] what are you we can't understand you you
[2:13:50] are confused
[2:13:52] which denomination are you from where is
[2:13:54] your headquarters who is your bishop and
[2:13:57] they will never get all those
[2:14:02] answers they can count the anglicans in
[2:14:04] the
[2:14:05] world they can count the Catholics in
[2:14:07] the
[2:14:08] world they can count the Pentecost in
[2:14:11] the world but do you know what there is
[2:14:14] no
[2:14:15] one who knows the number of Believers of
[2:14:18] the word in the world
[2:14:23] because this message
[2:14:26] movement is not a
[2:14:29] denomination we have no
[2:14:31] headquarter we don't we don't even know
[2:14:33] how many numbers of Believers we
[2:14:36] have why because the Bible says the
[2:14:40] secret is he knows his
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:47] own hallelujah amen even if they counted
[2:14:51] in all message Believers
[2:14:53] churches and they count all those
[2:14:55] Believers still they will have a wrong
[2:14:59] number because you may find 100 people
[2:15:02] here but maybe the Believers are
[2:15:06] five we don't know how many we are
[2:15:10] preaching to one in a
[2:15:12] million the Rapture is one in a
[2:15:15] million the shark will not be with a s
[2:15:21] hallelujah amen this message is for the
[2:15:24] seed and soon and very soon the seed
[2:15:28] will be
[2:15:29] harvested and we shall come out of this
[2:15:31] world and we will go to
[2:15:34] glory and the others will be
[2:15:37] left in their
[2:15:39] denominations in their
[2:15:41] organizations with their Arch
[2:15:43] Bishops but for us we shall go with the
[2:15:46] bishop of our
[2:15:48] soul on to Glory Hallelujah I am so glad
[2:15:54] I can say I am one of
[2:15:57] them hallelujah amen why because I am
[2:16:04] in
[2:16:06] in there is
[2:16:08] room room for
[2:16:10] everybody every song you
[2:16:13] see is a potential
[2:16:16] believer preach to them the message tell
[2:16:20] to every fall
[2:16:21] brother to every sister there is room
[2:16:25] for
[2:16:26] you room at the
[2:16:29] fountain I tell
[2:16:32] you when someone goes out with this
[2:16:36] message you are a
[2:16:39] dynamite because you can go
[2:16:41] anywhere with this message and it it
[2:16:45] will
[2:16:46] sell
[2:16:49] Hallelujah woo yes
[2:16:51] you go to the Roman
[2:16:53] Catholics and you just speak one little
[2:16:57] mystery one God not three 20 is from
[2:17:04] hell what's wrong with you you getting
[2:17:07] that from you go to the anglicans you
[2:17:10] just say one thing baptism of
[2:17:13] babies is from
[2:17:16] hell where did you get that from you say
[2:17:20] pcal
[2:17:23] they are
[2:17:24] fine you go to the
[2:17:26] pentec and you tell them where did you
[2:17:29] get anything like women
[2:17:33] preachers what about
[2:17:35] that there is a group called The
[2:17:39] UPC in E called
[2:17:43] Church which is they believe they the
[2:17:45] first
[2:17:46] church because a means apostles
[2:17:50] believe they the apostolic
[2:17:52] church we call them the Jesus only here
[2:17:56] or the UPC or the apostolic church but
[2:17:59] they believe they have the
[2:18:01] truth but you go to them with this
[2:18:03] message you pull one truth because you
[2:18:06] know they believe women should not
[2:18:08] preach some of
[2:18:09] them some of them they believe in
[2:18:12] Holiness they dress properly come on
[2:18:14] what do you believe almost everything
[2:18:16] they believe in one God they baptized in
[2:18:19] Jesus name m M almost like
[2:18:22] message but you pull out one one from
[2:18:26] the message and you tell I saw this man
[2:18:29] I spoke to him and SP he was debating
[2:18:32] debating de like these
[2:18:34] Philistines and I said uh I said to
[2:18:38] myself I am tired of debating and I said
[2:18:41] to him do you know about Malachi 4 he
[2:18:44] said what is Mal I said okay keep Qui
[2:18:46] let me teach
[2:18:48] you and I showed him
[2:18:51] there is an Elijah to come last and he's
[2:18:53] going to pull out the
[2:18:55] Mysteries he was seeing
[2:18:58] stars and then I went I took another
[2:19:01] level one of the
[2:19:03] Mysteries the serpent seed you know some
[2:19:07] children here in the world children
[2:19:10] children of
[2:19:11] Serpent and others of God he was seeing
[2:19:15] Stars why not because I knew too much
[2:19:20] but because
[2:19:21] where I am the water the river is
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:27] Flowing this message can sell
[2:19:31] everywhere everywhere you go they need
[2:19:34] it all over the world the spirit is
[2:19:38] moving all over the world as God said it
[2:19:41] will
[2:19:42] do and where is it moving it's moving in
[2:19:45] every
[2:19:46] place it's moving in every person
[2:19:50] open their heart for more
[2:19:54] Revelation because Revelation comes from
[2:19:57] God we are not building a
[2:20:01] system William Bram never started a
[2:20:05] religion we are not members of any
[2:20:08] religion in the
[2:20:09] world they ask you what is your religion
[2:20:13] you just say what you want to say
[2:20:15] brother if you want to say Catholic no
[2:20:19] problem because I'm the First
[2:20:22] Catholic and the original
[2:20:25] Catholic Catholic
[2:20:28] means
[2:20:31] churchu and they are the wrong Catholic
[2:20:35] Church I am not the Roman Catholic
[2:20:38] church because the Roman Catholic
[2:20:41] Church is the wrong Catholic
[2:20:43] church I'll prove that right now the
[2:20:46] Roman Catholic church does not does not
[2:20:50] believe their popes their Bishops
[2:20:55] marry but my Catholic
[2:20:59] Church My First
[2:21:02] bishop his name called Peter he was a
[2:21:06] married
[2:21:08] man and the Roman Catholic
[2:21:11] Church they claim Peter was also their
[2:21:15] first so they first
[2:21:18] married why don't they marry
[2:21:23] I am the original Catholic
[2:21:25] Church We Are The Universal
[2:21:28] Church is all over the
[2:21:31] world they call you pentec yes we are
[2:21:35] Pentecost we are everything and we are
[2:21:40] not you are
[2:21:42] confusing we are
[2:21:44] confusing because even he that is in US
[2:21:47] is
[2:21:48] confusing they can't understand
[2:21:52] they call him man and yet he was God and
[2:21:55] he says yes I am man 100% And I am God
[2:21:59] 100% said you are
[2:22:02] confusing he said if you don't believe I
[2:22:04] am he you will die in your sin before
[2:22:08] Abraham
[2:22:10] was I was I am before Abraham was I am
[2:22:17] meaning he is the same yesterday
[2:22:21] today and forever he was he is he to
[2:22:26] come and we are only a part of
[2:22:30] him that's why we confuse the
[2:22:33] world we confuse the
[2:22:35] nonbelievers is there anyone confused
[2:22:39] here Believers we confuse the
[2:22:47] nonbelievers if they didn't understand
[2:22:49] him they won't understand us if they
[2:22:53] didn't believe him they won't believe
[2:22:56] us but we know where we are
[2:22:59] standing the first two
[2:23:02] worlds there were type of
[2:23:05] denominations denominations separate
[2:23:10] Brotherhood it takes away the fire and
[2:23:13] burden to focus on the
[2:23:18] truth Isaiah each time never wasted
[2:23:24] time with the philes he never wasted
[2:23:28] time we should never waste time with
[2:23:34] denominations in the message why are we
[2:23:36] not have
[2:23:38] denomination a prophet says so we don't
[2:23:40] have any
[2:23:42] denomination all believer should shout
[2:23:44] to
[2:23:45] them because I think the denomination
[2:23:51] separate
[2:23:54] Brotherhood yes of course says every
[2:23:57] believer should have a home
[2:24:01] church but what does it mean is not
[2:24:04] meaning the church here the church there
[2:24:05] the
[2:24:06] chur we have one Church of the
[2:24:11] Bride today and in the generations
[2:24:14] before one church but we are in
[2:24:19] different physical
[2:24:22] areas and so because of that we have
[2:24:25] fellowships
[2:24:28] everywhere so a
[2:24:30] Believer should subscribe to be a member
[2:24:35] or to regular Fellowship in one of those
[2:24:44] churches how about if you are believed
[2:24:47] from
[2:24:48] here and I'm your pastor
[2:24:51] but you feel that you will be better
[2:24:54] under another
[2:24:58] preacher if you decide to go
[2:25:01] there are you a
[2:25:03] sinner no you are
[2:25:07] not Pastor what you saying is going to
[2:25:09] take away the
[2:25:12] people let them
[2:25:15] go as long as they in another body of
[2:25:18] Christ
[2:25:21] I mean if they are in the same body of
[2:25:24] Christ if you have gone to another
[2:25:27] fellowship it is all
[2:25:30] right you're not saying Amen on that say
[2:25:34] Amen the
[2:25:36] decision to do that has been given to
[2:25:39] every
[2:25:42] individual it's not your pastor that
[2:25:44] decides for
[2:25:46] you it is you decide for yourself
[2:25:51] as long as you are led by the spirit of
[2:25:55] God the problem is for you to be
[2:25:58] floating
[2:26:00] around you never have a home
[2:26:03] church that is not correct why because
[2:26:06] you will not
[2:26:08] grow this Sunday you are here another
[2:26:11] Sunday you are there another Sunday you
[2:26:12] are here another Sunday you are
[2:26:15] there the Pentecostals do
[2:26:17] that for us we are
[2:26:22] our Prophet has told us find our own
[2:26:27] church stay there pay your ties support
[2:26:32] give
[2:26:33] offering be there physically in every
[2:26:37] service not when you want in every
[2:26:40] service participate in what they are
[2:26:44] doing and then you will
[2:26:47] grow some people never grow
[2:26:51] because they are
[2:26:55] fls you FL
[2:26:58] the and you never grow
[2:27:01] spirit and you are never delivered from
[2:27:03] your
[2:27:04] demons because you are floting
[2:27:07] floting you come in dvf when God is
[2:27:11] beginning to work on you and I said
[2:27:14] something which will struck
[2:27:17] you I've changed
[2:27:21] now I'm in evening
[2:27:22] light when you go to evening light they
[2:27:25] will preach you say this is my chur from
[2:27:29] today and another time the pastor will
[2:27:32] come and he will say something which you
[2:27:36] are doing and condemn you
[2:27:41] repent this will not be
[2:27:44] easy now I'm in in a
[2:27:47] veil now I'm in life boat you are always
[2:27:52] floating and so you don't grow you don't
[2:27:57] change and you know we have what we
[2:28:04] call okay you know when you are
[2:28:09] cooking thank
[2:28:12] you when you are cooking how many have
[2:28:15] ever cooked sweet
[2:28:18] potatoes you people don't know how to
[2:28:21] you only cook rice and
[2:28:23] chicken if you're cooking sweet
[2:28:27] potatoes and then you remove it from the
[2:28:31] fire before it is
[2:28:33] ready you willess
[2:28:36] it oh it is
[2:28:38] hard okay let me take it back it will
[2:28:42] not it will continue being hard let me
[2:28:45] put more fire it will never be
[2:28:48] soft why
[2:28:51] in English it is
[2:28:57] what it
[2:28:59] has the English speakers I'm sorry I
[2:29:01] don't know the
[2:29:05] word no matter how much you
[2:29:08] cook these people they can sit under
[2:29:11] firey
[2:29:13] preachers they can sit under
[2:29:17] revivalist they can sit when God is
[2:29:19] filling people with Holy
[2:29:21] Ghost nothing will
[2:29:27] happen yeah you see they don't attend
[2:29:30] church they attend they don't attend
[2:29:31] they
[2:29:33] attend until you feel like should I call
[2:29:35] the person and I pray for
[2:29:37] him but you see this person is
[2:29:41] lukewarm is's not hot not
[2:29:47] cold he confused
[2:29:50] he looks like a Believer and again is's
[2:29:53] not completely he we don't understand
[2:29:57] him may you never be like that brother
[2:30:01] sister if you decide to Fellowship in
[2:30:04] one
[2:30:06] Fellowship be there don't dis Fellowship
[2:30:09] the others
[2:30:11] though if there is a convention or
[2:30:14] special meetings or something like
[2:30:17] that we are encouraged always to be a
[2:30:20] part of those
[2:30:22] Fellowship but you see when there is a
[2:30:25] service and your pastor prepared to
[2:30:27] preach to
[2:30:29] you come to your church and
[2:30:32] here because you see your pastor has a
[2:30:36] burden for
[2:30:40] you praise the name of the Lord and so
[2:30:44] friends if you see um as much as we have
[2:30:48] different fellowships all in the same
[2:30:54] body we are not a
[2:30:57] denomination our denomination
[2:30:59] denomination separate
[2:31:02] Brotherhood in here we have maybe more
[2:31:05] than 100 fellowships of of message
[2:31:11] believer and they all our
[2:31:13] brothers they are all our sisters we
[2:31:16] love them and they love
[2:31:18] us and this man had sleept in some other
[2:31:21] way we I'm reading from the message
[2:31:24] Fellowship he couldn't have Fellowship
[2:31:26] for he wasn't dressed
[2:31:33] right and when a man let his Creed or
[2:31:36] his denomination separate him from his
[2:31:43] brother something is
[2:31:47] wrong he slipped in by denational
[2:31:53] gate talking about that man that rather
[2:31:56] the angel kicked
[2:31:59] out and something like that and the
[2:32:01] Bible said bind him and throw him out of
[2:32:03] the outer the
[2:32:07] dark where there will be weeping and
[2:32:09] wailing and nashing
[2:32:13] of praise the name of the Lord now
[2:32:16] friends today I'm going to read for you
[2:32:19] out of the church AG
[2:32:21] book specifically from uh uh the regime
[2:32:26] of the
[2:32:30] ages the res others they call the
[2:32:38] rese

[2:32:53] Pepper so you can get
[2:32:56] appetite to hear what I'm going to read

[2:33:07] carefully brother bam here talks about
[2:33:09] two doctrines the do of
[2:33:11] balam and the doctrine of
[2:33:15] niolon notice above
[2:33:18] all that the bam will will do deliberate
[2:33:26] maneuver it is a deliberate maneuver of
[2:33:30] a corrupt it is a deliberate maneuver of
[2:33:32] a corrupt clergy to bind the people to
[2:33:37] them
[2:33:40] [Music]
[2:33:52] are you following me you see how this is
[2:33:55] how the of
[2:33:57] work it deliberately
[2:34:02] Maneuvers to corrupt
[2:34:05] Believers when who does that they
[2:34:09] corrupt
[2:34:12] preachers and they want to bind the
[2:34:15] people to them
[2:34:18] them have you ever heard of people of a
[2:34:22] preacher who has told you if you leave
[2:34:25] this
[2:34:29] church you're
[2:34:32] finished you're
[2:34:34] finished I am the
[2:34:36] person supposed to take you to heaven to
[2:34:39] lead you to heaven if you leave this
[2:34:43] church you're
[2:34:45] finished others that stand on the pulpit
[2:34:48] and they use their gift
[2:34:50] all youu I
[2:34:51] see you were going to
[2:34:54] perish this was going to happen and that
[2:34:57] was going to happen but because you
[2:34:59] here and the man of God me
[2:35:03] myself I'm speaking to you you are
[2:35:07] saved and and and the others on the
[2:35:10] microphone prophesy
[2:35:14] Papa say yes our man of godish
[2:35:21] these are
[2:35:24] corrupt they want to bind the people to
[2:35:29] them oh my God your
[2:35:32] salvation is not tied to any
[2:35:36] man your
[2:35:38] salvation is tied to your faith and
[2:35:41] belief in the
[2:35:44] truth I don't care whether you kneel to
[2:35:47] me or you lift me up or you bow down to
[2:35:49] me
[2:35:53] but at the end if you don't follow the
[2:35:56] message the way I preach it you will
[2:35:58] still be
[2:36:03] lost by the leading of the people and
[2:36:05] they deliberately you know he says by
[2:36:08] Leading the People deliberately into the
[2:36:11] scene of unbelief
[2:36:22] I was in
[2:36:23] Ethiopia and one preacher a very old
[2:36:27] preacher told us there was
[2:36:31] somewhere and uh this preacher
[2:36:34] said to the people hallelujah hallelujah
[2:36:39] the spirit of God is here now do you
[2:36:42] want to hear from the Bible the
[2:36:46] word or you want to hear from above
[2:36:53] so the people had to make a
[2:36:55] choice and everybody said
[2:36:58] above so he took the Bible and threw it
[2:37:01] away and he
[2:37:03] began above is
[2:37:08] him of course you begin prophesy
[2:37:10] prophesy
[2:37:12] prophesy and but at the end of the day
[2:37:15] you tell you now whatever is in your
[2:37:16] pocket bring it out this is about
[2:37:25] he's really after your
[2:37:27] pocket that is above above leads them to
[2:37:31] your
[2:37:32] pocket but
[2:37:35] above has always told the
[2:37:38] people repent or
[2:37:44] perish and the man of God
[2:37:47] Nam he came with a lot of
[2:37:50] um he came with a lot of
[2:37:52] money but you see the man of God Elisha
[2:37:55] could not
[2:37:57] take he told him go away with your
[2:38:00] money I'm not after
[2:38:02] it this message is the only
[2:38:08] truth that is not after your
[2:38:12] money God will use your
[2:38:15] money if you freely give it
[2:38:19] but this message is not after your
[2:38:24] money and by the way whether you give or
[2:38:27] you don't you will still go in the
[2:38:30] Rapture if you're the
[2:38:33] bride the only
[2:38:35] difference will be the levels of your
[2:38:39] [Music]
[2:38:40] glory and don't think that is a small
[2:38:42] thing
[2:38:43] also because if you don't
[2:38:46] give and you don't sacrifice and you
[2:38:49] stand for this
[2:38:50] message there is no way that you can
[2:38:53] receive a a one um higher
[2:38:58] Glory you will be judged for how you
[2:39:01] have used your
[2:39:05] resources you'll be judged meaning
[2:39:07] you'll give an
[2:39:09] account are you following me now so he
[2:39:12] continues here the nian
[2:39:16] doctrine was the corruption of the
[2:39:23] CL as they s political power among
[2:39:38] themselves while bism is the is the
[2:39:41] subject sorry while babism is the
[2:39:44] subjection of the people to their system
[2:39:46] of creed and worship in order to hold
[2:39:48] them
[2:39:58] now watch this carefully what is it that
[2:40:02] bound the people to the nominal church
[2:40:04] and thereby destroyed
[2:40:10] them what is it it bound them to the
[2:40:13] nominal
[2:40:15] Church to hold them there now watch this
[2:40:18] carefully say
[2:40:21] it was the Creeds and dogmas formed into
[2:40:25] church
[2:40:47] tenant I'll read it again it was the
[2:40:50] Creeds and
[2:40:53] dogmas formed into church
[2:40:57] tenants it was the doctrine of the Roman
[2:41:01] Catholic
[2:41:03] Church do you understand this is how
[2:41:06] denomination
[2:41:07] operates they will have
[2:41:12] resolutions from
[2:41:14] today we have
[2:41:16] resolved we shall do like this like this
[2:41:20] this thing they have resolved to do
[2:41:21] becomes the gospel
[2:41:26] truth the bride does not move upon
[2:41:32] resolutions the bride moves upon the
[2:41:34] word and the holy
[2:41:38] goers they were not given the true food
[2:41:41] and the word
[2:41:44] word they were given the food that came
[2:41:47] from idol worship
[2:41:51] Babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[2:41:53] Christian
[2:41:58] terminology you know wrong
[2:42:00] doctrines traditions of ideas for
[2:42:05] example they taught infant
[2:42:09] baptism it is not here in the
[2:42:11] Bible you see them with
[2:42:15] laries even the wish doctors have them
[2:42:18] you see you see them with
[2:42:21] scapular they say if you wear
[2:42:23] this you will go straight to heaven if
[2:42:26] you
[2:42:26] die it is not here in the Bible you see
[2:42:30] them believing in the
[2:42:31] Trinity it's not here in the Bible women
[2:42:36] preachers nowhere in the Bible it is all
[2:42:39] false
[2:42:41] doctrines which were started and and you
[2:42:43] know by this false Church
[2:42:46] system you know you see them you know
[2:42:53] confused in such a in
[2:42:57] gifts this one is shouting in
[2:42:59] Tong this one is praying this one
[2:43:02] everybody pray in Tong yet the Bible
[2:43:05] says when you are in the church tongues
[2:43:09] must be spoken to to
[2:43:14] edify therefore it should be interpret
[2:43:19] if you want to pray in tongues it's okay
[2:43:21] but at
[2:43:23] home at
[2:43:24] home in your own private prayers but in
[2:43:28] the church let your tongues edify
[2:43:32] us and it cannot edify us without
[2:43:38] interpretation but the false Church
[2:43:40] system
[2:43:42] refus for them they coin these things
[2:43:44] among
[2:43:45] them you find there are women wearing
[2:43:48] trousers
[2:43:51] and their pastors have told them it's
[2:43:54] okay yet the Bible says if a woman wears
[2:43:58] a man's
[2:44:00] cloth she's an
[2:44:03] Abomination do you know what an
[2:44:06] Abomination it means God looks at
[2:44:09] you and he
[2:44:12] speaks
[2:44:13] Abominations Abominations are on
[2:44:17] pulpits Abominations are ing in the
[2:44:23] [Music]
[2:44:30] church when they move like this every
[2:44:35] move is meant to make younger men
[2:44:40] lustful you know the way they dress that
[2:44:44] trouser it is an Abomination
[2:44:46] friend an Abomination stand standing in
[2:44:49] a holy
[2:44:50] [Music]
[2:44:52] place and yet it has made been made to
[2:44:55] be
[2:44:59] accepted now listen to
[2:45:01] me these are B this is Babylonian
[2:45:07] paganism wrapped up in Christian
[2:45:12] terminology and that very same
[2:45:16] spirit and Doctrine is Right among us
[2:45:20] all
[2:45:23] Protestants and it is called
[2:45:30] denomination nism is
[2:45:35] Organization no no no listen to this
[2:45:37] don't miss
[2:45:38] this humanizing the leadership of the
[2:45:46] church and thereby this posing the
[2:45:53] spirit you you don't understand what
[2:45:55] this
[2:45:56] means you know the spirit of
[2:45:59] nanism is a spirit of
[2:46:02] organization that humanizes the
[2:46:05] leadership of the
[2:46:09] church I have spoken I'm your pastor I
[2:46:11] have
[2:46:13] spoken it's a spirit of
[2:46:16] nanism we don't follow that
[2:46:19] we don't we cannot BET our life on what
[2:46:22] the pastor has
[2:46:26] said but we follow with our life and
[2:46:29] everything in us if the pastor tells us
[2:46:31] the
[2:46:36] word it's just like in the
[2:46:39] home if your
[2:46:41] husband always is the kind who just
[2:46:43] tells I have spoken
[2:46:46] just I am your husband
[2:46:49] you have to listen to everything do
[2:46:52] it that is the spirit of
[2:46:58] nism Pastor what do you mean you know
[2:47:01] there are people who like quoting the
[2:47:03] pastor is the husband of the
[2:47:07] church but the pastor has no seed of his
[2:47:11] own the pastor is a
[2:47:14] chamberline are you hearing me he
[2:47:17] doesn't you remember the chamberline who
[2:47:18] was preparing Esther and
[2:47:21] other he he was he he didn't have a seed
[2:47:24] of his
[2:47:26] own he was using the seed the only the
[2:47:29] one who the only one who had a seed in
[2:47:30] the house was the
[2:47:33] king and the only one who has a seed to
[2:47:36] give us life is the
[2:47:37] [Music]
[2:47:38] king the spoken word is the Original
[2:47:44] Seed so the pastor is the head of the
[2:47:47] church he rules the church that is true
[2:47:51] is the highest authority of the
[2:47:57] church the pastor is the
[2:48:00] head of the deacon Board of the
[2:48:03] musicians of all the offices in the
[2:48:06] church and the body but he rules the
[2:48:11] church using two
[2:48:14] things the word and the Holy Spirit
[2:48:19] not as his desire he
[2:48:22] is therefore I must not lead the body
[2:48:26] with my
[2:48:34] emotion no sometimes
[2:48:58] can you interpret that you see there is
[2:49:01] some sheep which can really make you mad
[2:49:04] and you can can I Chas this sheep and I
[2:49:07] tell them to go and look for another
[2:49:11] Pastor go
[2:49:13] away and I
[2:49:16] remember these are not my sheep
[2:49:20] the Sheep of
[2:49:22] Jesus
[2:49:24] for and he his
[2:49:30] blood are you not happy to know that you
[2:49:33] are the Sheep of Jesus hallelujah amen
[2:49:38] and Jesus told us as
[2:49:42] Shepherds as
[2:49:44] ministers we must serve in humility
[2:49:49] preachers and ministers and
[2:49:52] servants they are
[2:49:56] servants
[2:49:57] servants you are the
[2:50:00] boss the body is the
[2:50:03] boss some also I'm also part of the
[2:50:08] body we are the
[2:50:10] boss and our
[2:50:13] preachers our
[2:50:16] servants when you go in a restaurant
[2:50:19] and they serve you
[2:50:23] food who is the
[2:50:26] boss the one getting the food or the one
[2:50:30] serving the
[2:50:34] food the one going to
[2:50:36] eat said the one going to
[2:50:39] eat because you ordered for the
[2:50:43] food and you are going to be
[2:50:45] paid you're going to pay for it you are
[2:50:49] the
[2:50:50] boss praise
[2:50:53] God
[2:50:55] nanism let me proceed here finish this
[2:50:58] quote nanism is organiz organization
[2:51:01] humanizing the leadership of the church
[2:51:03] and thereby deposing the
[2:51:10] spirit maybe the brother can come and
[2:51:13] help come on come on up brother martin
[2:51:15] and
[2:51:16] help and help the brother
[2:51:19] and he says bism is denominationalism
[2:51:23] which takes the church manual instead of
[2:51:27] the Bible this is you know brother Mar
[2:51:29] be a little faster because I don't want
[2:51:31] to be cut here he says niol nanism is
[2:51:34] organization humanizing the leadership
[2:51:36] of the
[2:51:44] church can I speak lug and you speak
[2:51:46] English
[2:51:50] NM
[2:51:54] organization let let us
[2:51:58] human let us make an organization an
[2:52:00] organization then then they get a human
[2:52:04] being and they put him
[2:52:07] there and they begin all to look up up
[2:52:10] to
[2:52:11] him and they remove the
[2:52:14] spirit what he says is what we
[2:52:17] say what he says is what we
[2:52:20] follow but in the message we believe in
[2:52:24] the leadership of the Holy
[2:52:28] Spirit not in the leadership of a
[2:52:34] manism is denominationalism which takes
[2:52:37] the church manual
[2:52:53] instead of the
[2:52:55] Bible and right to this
[2:52:58] hour many of God's people are CAU in the
[2:53:01] snare of denominationalism and God is
[2:53:04] crying to
[2:53:11] them and he says come out of her my
[2:53:14] people that ye be not partakers of our
[2:53:17] sins
[2:53:21] that ye receive not of her
[2:53:25] plagues you see they are
[2:53:28] ignorant but if the Rapture should take
[2:53:31] place at this
[2:53:34] moment ignorance would not be would be
[2:53:37] no court of appeal from the Judgment
[2:53:41] of for being in the wrong
[2:53:45] ranks but I'm so
[2:53:47] glad brought me
[2:53:49] out he brought me out of he brought me
[2:53:53] out of
[2:53:54] denominationalism for the cl to organize
[2:53:57] themselves with one rank over
[2:54:02] another until they are finally headed by
[2:54:05] a
[2:54:09] president that is a manifestation of the
[2:54:12] Antichrist
[2:54:16] Spirit regardless of how wonderful and
[2:54:19] necessary it may
[2:54:22] seem it is nothing but human
[2:54:28] reasoning taking the place of the
[2:54:31] word are you not so glad Brothers sister
[2:54:35] that you can come
[2:54:36] here Amen on Sunday morning on Wednesday
[2:54:39] evening knowing you are not going to
[2:54:41] hear human
[2:54:44] reasoning you can walk into a message
[2:54:46] Church
[2:54:48] knowing you are going to hear God
[2:54:50] speaking to
[2:54:54] you and any person who is in the
[2:54:57] organized
[2:55:01] denominations is right in the midst of
[2:55:04] an antichrist
[2:55:10] spirit let me repeat that any
[2:55:14] person who is in the organized denom
[2:55:21] Nations is right in the
[2:55:24] middle of an antichrist
[2:55:31] system now let me say this and I make it
[2:55:35] very
[2:55:37] plain I am not against the
[2:55:41] people I'm against the
[2:55:45] system and by being part of
[2:55:50] systems they are receiving to themselves
[2:55:52] the mark of the
[2:55:56] beast amen that's why God has called us
[2:55:59] out this message is a calling
[2:56:02] out come out of my
[2:56:05] people come on that's why we should
[2:56:09] evangelize because we have a
[2:56:12] message that is calling them
[2:56:14] out out of
[2:56:17] their you know they may be perfect
[2:56:19] humanly
[2:56:22] speaking they may never have
[2:56:27] fornicated let me tell you brother if
[2:56:30] they part of the false Church
[2:56:33] system they shall receive the mark of
[2:56:36] the
[2:56:37] be you see why it is important for you
[2:56:40] to believe the
[2:56:42] message and you also see why it is
[2:56:44] important for you not to fellowship with
[2:56:46] nonbelievers
[2:56:51] by the right hand of
[2:56:55] Fellowship by receiving their
[2:56:58] Doctrine you receive the mark
[2:57:02] of I want to be
[2:57:06] separate hallelujah amen now listen in
[2:57:11] the message
[2:57:12] denomination and I believe that God has
[2:57:15] dealt in each age
[2:57:19] but did you ever notice
[2:57:22] that every time a church
[2:57:26] fall and as soon as they
[2:57:30] denominate they start failing right
[2:57:33] then and whenever they
[2:57:36] fail God never raises that church
[2:57:41] again it goes to the
[2:57:46] seat now now you
[2:57:49] remember there is a picture I had on the
[2:57:51] old
[2:57:53] church of the Bride
[2:57:55] tree you see these denominations came
[2:57:59] forming one by one by one by one by
[2:58:04] one but it all started as a move of
[2:58:09] God God was moving God was accomplishing
[2:58:13] his
[2:58:14] word but when they denominate
[2:58:19] they die God moves they they God
[2:58:25] moves you know how did they
[2:58:27] denominate the way we have seen and then
[2:58:30] they say this is everything we
[2:58:34] believe everything in this book is what
[2:58:36] we
[2:58:37] believe and we believe nothing
[2:58:41] else but for us as Believers of the
[2:58:45] message we don't have a full stop on
[2:58:47] what we believe
[2:58:51] we believe
[2:58:53] everything that God has revealed to our
[2:58:56] Prophet we believe everything in the
[2:58:59] Bible we believe
[2:59:02] everything more that God will reveal to
[2:59:07] us because we believe there is more in
[2:59:11] God hallelujah amen there is more in
[2:59:16] God and in the message when am I against
[2:59:19] organized religion these are some of the
[2:59:21] messages you can
[2:59:22] [Applause]
[2:59:26] really now if I judge and accept the
[2:59:30] word and see that that Christ died for
[2:59:32] me then I will ask for his life to come
[2:59:35] in and guide me and if his life is the
[2:59:38] word and he wrote the word how can his
[2:59:41] life be in me and me claiming to have
[2:59:44] the Holy Spirit and adding a Dogma
[2:59:46] instead of the word all
[2:59:55] right a Believer cannot add anything on
[2:59:59] the
[3:00:01] word it just wouldn't
[3:00:04] work how can I add a
[3:00:08] denomination when he is against
[3:00:12] it and showed it through
[3:00:15] history every time they denominate they
[3:00:20] die they die
[3:00:23] spiritually they grow members all
[3:00:28] right but spiritually they never go
[3:00:31] anywhere so have you heard that having a
[3:00:35] big
[3:00:36] group is not a sign of
[3:00:42] prosperity amen the church can be very
[3:00:45] big but when they spiritually
[3:00:50] after it organized it died right
[3:00:54] there the Holy Spirit left it there is

[3:11:04] happening very
[3:11:06] soon people who know about this message
[3:11:09] and are joking around with
[3:11:12] it ah it will be a very sad time for
[3:11:15] them
[3:11:17] if the Rapture
[3:11:19] happens and you realize I'm
[3:11:23] left you will begin
[3:11:25] laughing and crying at the same
[3:11:29] time the Rapture has
[3:11:32] happen some of you called L
[3:11:37] unbelievers you like coming L to
[3:11:40] church that day you will
[3:11:43] come the Bible says I don't know whether
[3:11:45] it will be morning or night but
[3:11:48] I just hope it will be Sunday early
[3:11:53] morning and others will
[3:11:56] go and then you
[3:11:59] arrive at 11
[3:12:03] a.m. today I've been where will I
[3:12:06] sit
[3:12:09] behind then you
[3:12:13] reach where the deons I'm not seeing
[3:12:15] them
[3:12:19] okay let me
[3:12:24] go yes the church is
[3:12:26] open maybe because the first brother who
[3:12:29] always opens had already opened by the
[3:12:31] time the Rapture
[3:12:31] [Applause]
[3:12:39] happened and then while you are
[3:12:42] entering you find another sister she's
[3:12:45] crying
[3:12:47] and
[3:12:48] laughing she's in the
[3:12:52] spirit and
[3:12:54] then to see another
[3:12:58] brother today people are not
[3:13:02] serious today they not
[3:13:04] serious only five people in the
[3:13:07] church and you begin to think you're
[3:13:12] spiritual before you know
[3:13:15] it see the people cry
[3:13:18] continuously there
[3:13:21] no and then your mind comes
[3:13:26] back you won't even ask anyone because
[3:13:28] you know
[3:13:38] already should I cry should I
[3:13:41] laugh and I'm so
[3:13:44] foolish and I knew about it
[3:13:48] I thought I put myself right
[3:13:51] tomorrow and then you realize is serious
[3:13:54] then you begin
[3:13:58] cry even if I cry I know what is going
[3:14:02] to happen and then you begin laughing at
[3:14:06] yourself friends people who know about
[3:14:09] this
[3:14:10] message and they're joking
[3:14:12] around it will be a sad sight for them
[3:14:18] the others will continue worshiping
[3:14:20] normally in their
[3:14:23] denominations that's why you will come
[3:14:25] all the way to
[3:14:26] church because you are seeing everything
[3:14:28] is normal in the other
[3:14:31] denominations in the other
[3:14:33] denominations everything is
[3:14:36] normal and then by the time you reach
[3:14:38] here that's when you realize things have
[3:14:41] changed things have taken a
[3:14:44] corner may God help you brother sister
[3:14:46] to be serious we a brother sister amen
[3:14:49] there is
[3:14:50] room there is room for
[3:14:53] you and I want to finish with a few
[3:14:55] quotes here in the message tting for
[3:14:59] life he says now many people begin to
[3:15:02] think on the subject of
[3:15:05] life and now feeling free and I have
[3:15:09] always tried to to hold to not hold
[3:15:12] things back
[3:15:19] never in my life knowingly have I ever
[3:15:22] called out a character meaning a
[3:15:26] person
[3:15:34] name I have rebuked
[3:15:37] sin preached what I thought was
[3:15:40] right but never disregarded any brother
[3:15:47] he could be just as
[3:15:50] wrong and I could be wrong
[3:15:53] too but regardless him being
[3:15:57] wrong don't disfellowship him from my
[3:16:00] fellowship with Christ with
[3:16:04] him we are
[3:16:07] brothers we should not disfellowship
[3:16:10] Brothers brother from another fellowship
[3:16:13] is our brother
[3:16:17] why because there is enough room for all
[3:16:19] of
[3:16:21] us hallelujah amen in the message
[3:16:25] absolute says and I see the word is the
[3:16:30] absolute they told me you preach
[3:16:32] absolute and it was really nice the
[3:16:34] Believers there
[3:16:36] were and I see the word is the
[3:16:39] absolute and I'm tied to
[3:16:41] it how many are tied to the word
[3:16:47] determined I will know nothing else but
[3:16:49] Jesus
[3:16:52] Christ and him
[3:16:55] crucified he had a reason for
[3:16:58] it and I'm determined
[3:17:01] listen to hold that
[3:17:08] reason no matter what anybody else
[3:17:13] says I don't disfellowship them
[3:17:18] or discredit
[3:17:19] them but I know what I'm tied
[3:17:23] to by the way this here is a
[3:17:28] key in the Christian Journey we are
[3:17:32] walking many
[3:17:34] times when someone doesn't see the way
[3:17:37] you see
[3:17:39] things you don't even by the way do you
[3:17:42] know even in this
[3:17:44] message people see different things
[3:17:46] different ways
[3:17:52] yes people read the
[3:17:54] Bible but each one sees it
[3:17:58] differently the same applies to the
[3:18:01] message not everybody sees what you
[3:18:06] see someone will tell you if you plate
[3:18:09] your hair you're going to
[3:18:11] [Music]
[3:18:12] hell and they're
[3:18:15] wrong they're wrong
[3:18:17] you can quote them the
[3:18:19] message but what
[3:18:22] happens some Believers some ministers
[3:18:25] will disfellowship
[3:18:28] them no you not a
[3:18:31] brother don't disfellowship each
[3:18:34] other where are we we
[3:18:37] at there's enough room for
[3:18:41] us there is
[3:18:43] room there is
[3:18:45] room in the greatest battle ever
[3:18:48] fought no matter how wrong they
[3:18:51] are let's not disfellowship or
[3:18:53] disassociate ourselves with
[3:18:56] anything as long as we can win a
[3:18:59] soul let's go in with a as wi serpents
[3:19:06] but and try to win every soul that we
[3:19:11] can you know if you are a believer of
[3:19:13] this

[3:19:16] came here and told us that he even went
[3:19:19] to the mosque and worn a
[3:19:22] soul how many remember that
[3:19:25] that it is only believe you know in this
[3:19:29] message we are
[3:19:35] bulletproof the devil can try to send
[3:19:37] his bullets of wrong
[3:19:44] doctrines it can't penetrate
[3:19:47] it cannot
[3:19:50] penetrate you will go and walk in a
[3:19:54] Pentecostal
[3:19:56] church if you a
[3:19:58] preacher and you have a burden for
[3:20:00] someone a
[3:20:01] friend tell you I I go to your

[3:21:22] problem when he comes
[3:21:25] here it will be
[3:21:28] impossible he will come
[3:21:31] back brother Alan was telling me the
[3:21:34] other sister
[3:21:36] came but she just came and had me
[3:21:41] preaching and then at the end she asked
[3:21:43] questions she said I have three
[3:21:45] questions
[3:21:48] I had you mention William
[3:21:49] Bram I had also someone else mention
[3:21:52] William
[3:21:53] Bram I want to know who is this William
[3:21:58] BR number
[3:22:00] two what
[3:22:02] baptism I was baptized in the name of
[3:22:05] father son Holy
[3:22:06] Spirit but I had you mentioned in the
[3:22:08] name of the Lord Jesus
[3:22:10] Christ what is the
[3:22:13] difference number three what was number
[3:22:16] three
[3:22:18] tongues is it wrong to speak
[3:22:21] Tong I heard some
[3:22:23] people I said good
[3:22:26] questions so she came to visit us but by
[3:22:29] the time she was leaving she didn't even
[3:22:32] want to go we were there because of her
[3:22:34] for two
[3:22:37] hours and I'm telling you she's going to
[3:22:39] be
[3:22:41] baptized hallelujah amen she told me she
[3:22:45] understood perfectly
[3:22:48] you see there is room we atob there is
[3:22:52] room don't be
[3:22:55] St go and call out
[3:22:59] somebody your friends you're talking to
[3:23:01] them minister to
[3:23:03] them in those fellowships around your
[3:23:05] home bring them
[3:23:09] in bring them me call them let them come
[3:23:13] to
[3:23:14] Fellowship let them here by the way even
[3:23:16] if they may hear one one word they will
[3:23:18] hear
[3:23:19] something it doesn't that's why I put
[3:23:21] younger men to minister in this
[3:23:24] fellowships it doesn't matter whether
[3:23:26] they have preaching for their first
[3:23:29] time they will say
[3:23:32] something which those Souls have never
[3:23:34] had
[3:23:36] before why because what we have is more
[3:23:40] than
[3:23:41] denomination it is more than
[3:23:44] organization it is more than religion
[3:23:48] Hallelujah we are gathering
[3:23:51] souls for the
[3:23:54] Rapture there is room for
[3:23:56] everybody and we are determined to do
[3:24:00] that we are determined how many are
[3:24:03] determined be
[3:24:05] determined to call them witness to
[3:24:09] somebody bring them
[3:24:11] in bring them from the fields of
[3:24:14] sin it's not only
[3:24:17] Sinners as part the things they
[3:24:20] doing they are sinners because they have
[3:24:23] no
[3:24:28] truth and I finish with
[3:24:31] that I hear someone say how come they
[3:24:34] Sinners because they have no
[3:24:38] truth that rich young ruler was was a
[3:24:42] sinner how many agree because he wanted
[3:24:45] a saor
[3:24:47] he said good Master what can
[3:24:52] I and he told
[3:24:54] him C he told him um you know the
[3:24:59] Commandments go do
[3:25:01] them I want to ask a question
[3:25:04] here how many Among
[3:25:09] Us have fulfilled The Ten Commandments
[3:25:12] perfectly
[3:25:16] since they were born raise up your
[3:25:21] hand that man was holier than all of
[3:25:27] you as far as the laws are
[3:25:30] concerned and the good
[3:25:34] works think about it but he was a
[3:25:38] sinner why he didn't have
[3:25:42] Christ and who is Christ the word
[3:25:47] so these people may be in the churches
[3:25:49] they may be so called they may sing they
[3:25:51] may do all things but if they don't have
[3:25:54] the full truth the full
[3:25:57] word they are
[3:26:00] seers and you need to reach them
[3:26:04] out in
[3:26:06] humility in
[3:26:08] love let us turn on our feet
[3:26:16] and I finish with these words as we
[3:26:20] stand the prophet says standing in the
[3:26:23] Gap now many of the people and
[3:26:28] churches musicians can come he says this
[3:26:31] is an open

[3:51:16] [Music]
[3:51:22] Church you may have your seats for just
[3:51:24] a
[3:51:26] moment I will not keep you long just
[3:51:30] those two
[3:51:35] announcements uh the first announcement
[3:51:37] is that we start as a committee last
[3:51:43] Sunday and
[3:51:45] we we were trying to make the
[3:51:50] budget I think we bit a little later and
[3:51:52] I think uh brothera you can stream this
[3:51:55] part there are certain people who are
[3:51:56] part of us and would like
[3:51:58] to uh to also get this announcements so
[3:52:02] we we we are a bit late in making the
[3:52:06] budget this
[3:52:09] year and that gives us a short
[3:52:13] time to to look for the funds that we
[3:52:16] need to have a successful
[3:52:22] youth uh so we are looking
[3:52:25] for uh 37 million
[3:52:31] Shillings
[3:52:33] uh this is the budget that we
[3:52:38] made amen
[3:52:41] amen um so
[3:52:45] I told the
[3:52:48] committee that we we are going to have
[3:52:50] to find this
[3:52:52] money we as a church no one will do it
[3:52:55] for
[3:52:57] us unfortunately I do not have with me
[3:52:59] here what this budget entails does
[3:53:02] someone have it is I think you have it
[3:53:06] can I have it brother just bring it up
[3:53:08] to me here
[3:53:14] so I can give you the
[3:53:17] details of that
[3:53:23] budget and I I see many are not here
[3:53:26] today so I hope they will be able to
[3:53:28] find this from the
[3:53:33] scen so the
[3:53:39] venue we have been asked
[3:53:42] for um
[3:53:44] uh 9 million
[3:53:49] Shillings this year we are
[3:53:52] blessed because this money that I've
[3:53:55] just told you the 9 million
[3:53:59] shs it includes almost everything that
[3:54:02] we need to accommodate our
[3:54:08] people it includes a hall which can sit
[3:54:10] up to a thousand people
[3:54:15] um the only bad side of it is that it's
[3:54:18] a little older Hall than the one we had
[3:54:21] this
[3:54:25] year but we are trying to work with the
[3:54:28] school so that they
[3:54:32] can so and also they will uh give us uh
[3:54:37] the uh the
[3:54:39] chairs all the
[3:54:42] chairs um
[3:54:45] they have two
[3:54:50] Flats one of them is for boys another is
[3:54:53] for girls
[3:54:57] hosts and in each they can accommodate
[3:55:00] up to 500 or
[3:55:04] more and people not sleep like goats
[3:55:08] last
[3:55:12] time you know like last time we give
[3:55:15] they gave us a hole and mattresses so
[3:55:17] everybody was just falling wherever they
[3:55:21] were but this time we have
[3:55:24] bed
[3:55:26] mattress so they will simply need to
[3:55:28] bring their
[3:55:34] beddings um and also this includes the
[3:55:39] kitchen dining
[3:55:42] areas um left out
[3:55:45] anything standby
[3:55:50] generator it includes
[3:55:52] Power grp Cleaners cu the school wants
[3:55:55] to be
[3:55:56] cleaners um security
[3:55:59] Personnel all those things so it is
[3:56:02] included in
[3:56:03] there in the 9 million Shillings so this
[3:56:05] is the cheapest you can find
[3:56:10] anywhere really God is with us to give
[3:56:12] us this uh this this
[3:56:17] place and uh I think it's a good a good
[3:56:25] amount last year some of you who don't
[3:56:27] know we were paying uh 45,000 per person
[3:56:32] per night to
[3:56:38] sleep every
[3:56:40] person 45,000
[3:56:45] for the two
[3:56:46] nights 15,000 per
[3:56:49] night uh and on top of that we were
[3:56:51] paying for the hall we paid 3 million
[3:56:53] Shillings separate for
[3:56:56] theall so uh you can see that this year
[3:57:00] it's much
[3:57:04] better you're not happy for
[3:57:07] that you should be
[3:57:09] happy then uh music um Department
[3:57:14] is going to be taking up to 3 million
[3:57:19] Shillings no no no no not just say what
[3:57:22] I'm
[3:57:25] saying uh we're going to be renting
[3:57:30] equipment and
[3:57:32] um last the other place they were giving
[3:57:35] us but here we need to rent all the
[3:57:38] equipment we mean we mean the speakers
[3:57:41] and
[3:57:42] the monitor
[3:57:44] and
[3:57:45] microphones all those things that go
[3:57:47] with the sound this cannot work there
[3:57:49] the hall is much bigger what we have
[3:57:52] here cannot work
[3:57:53] there so we need to pay that much and
[3:57:57] then for food we expect 500 to 6 700
[3:58:05] people and that would attract about 12
[3:58:07] million
[3:58:10] shs um and um then the the stage lights
[3:58:15] 2 million
[3:58:16] Shillings curtain 2 million
[3:58:19] Shillings carpet 1 million shills
[3:58:22] interpreter interpreters Department we
[3:58:24] need also some
[3:58:27] funds
[3:58:29] um not only interpreters I don't know
[3:58:31] why you put interpreters for many other
[3:58:33] departments to to help depart the
[3:58:35] ministers I think
[3:58:37] 500,000 Logistics 500,000 shs technical
[3:58:41] department 500 Shillings
[3:58:44] Medical Department
[3:58:47] 200,000
[3:58:50] accommodation for our visitors who are
[3:58:51] going to
[3:58:53] be 5 million
[3:58:55] shs
[3:58:57] um m 2 million
[3:59:00] shs that brings us
[3:59:05] to7
[3:59:07] 700,000 so we're thinking if we go
[3:59:09] squeezing squeezing squeezing
[3:59:14] may we may at least make bring the
[3:59:17] budget down to 35
[3:59:21] million and so we agreed in the
[3:59:26] committee that uh the
[3:59:29] people um we estimated okay we estimated
[3:59:32] depending on the last youth
[3:59:36] camp we estimated that at least the the
[3:59:40] the young people that are coming
[3:59:44] will contribute 15
[3:59:48] Millions we estimated that according to
[3:59:51] our last
[3:59:57] Youth and so then that leaves us as a
[4:00:01] church with 20 million shs to look
[4:00:07] for amen amen and uh the good news
[4:00:12] is we had about
[4:00:15] 20 I have the number here 20 we had

[4:09:20] amen God is more than able to
[4:09:23] do those who that God would

[4:09:57] here next year
[4:10:04] Aug brother Joel is that up to
[4:10:08] August
[4:10:10] yes uh so
[4:10:14] 10 what was our
[4:10:18] plan let us gather as much as we
[4:10:23] can so that by
[4:10:26] August we buy our
[4:10:29] land but with the p we are going
[4:10:34] now we cannot do we cannot attain that
[4:10:38] goal unless we double our efforts Tri
[4:10:45] now to you
[4:10:46] Brethren who are not
[4:10:54] giving I'm about to take a
[4:10:59] microphone and give it to each
[4:11:02] individual and I ask
[4:11:05] you how much do you give every
[4:11:10] week I know people in this church
[4:11:15] who you can call
[4:11:17] poor but they they cannot fail to give
[4:11:23] 10,000 I know
[4:11:26] them but I also
[4:11:28] know those who you can say they are well
[4:11:32] of they don't even give
[4:11:35] anything now these
[4:11:38] Brethren are the ones um going to make
[4:11:42] us fail to hit the
[4:11:46] target some of them their idea
[4:11:50] is I can't give
[4:11:55] 20,000
[4:11:57] small let me collect big sums of
[4:12:01] money and give 20 million
[4:12:05] go but it has been 36 weeks
[4:12:13] person who was giving
[4:12:16] 10,000 has given 360,000
[4:12:20] you who is waiting to get a big
[4:12:25] miracle you have given
[4:12:28] nothing imagine it is a lack of
[4:12:33] vision I'm encouraging our brothers and
[4:12:37] sisters don't discourage your team
[4:12:41] leader they call you they text
[4:12:46] you by the way on the WhatsApp groups
[4:12:49] there are some members who are not even
[4:12:51] of this
[4:12:53] church but your team leader will send
[4:12:56] messages
[4:12:58] there and you will never cheer
[4:13:02] them you the members of the church you
[4:13:06] be some of the group members who WR are
[4:13:09] the ones from other churches who are
[4:13:11] supporting us
[4:13:15] I'm speaking on behalf of the group team
[4:13:19] leaders they are not
[4:13:21] happy they are saying you discouraging
[4:13:25] them give what you
[4:13:28] can the Bible says God gives seed
[4:13:32] to
[4:13:37] the so you cannot fail to have a seed to
[4:13:41] give
[4:13:43] God gives you what to give and then when
[4:13:47] you give God will multiply you and then
[4:13:51] you will get more to give if what you
[4:13:54] have is
[4:13:56] 5,000 and give
[4:14:00] consistently give
[4:14:02] consistently and you will soon realize
[4:14:05] we shall achieve our
[4:14:08] goal so in 10
[4:14:12] months if we are collecting cuz I
[4:14:15] noticed on
[4:14:17] average if you take 36
[4:14:21] millions and you divide it in 10
[4:14:25] weeks I mean you divide it in 36
[4:14:29] weeks that's 1 million on
[4:14:32] average it means every week we give
[4:14:35] averagely 1 million
[4:14:49] so we give like a
[4:14:51] million now it means in 10
[4:14:56] months um if we keep giving 1
[4:15:01] million a
[4:15:03] week that will mean we shall raise a
[4:15:06] total sum of um 1 million time
[4:15:10] uh Time 4 that's 4 million a month times
[4:15:14] 10 that's 40
[4:15:18] million by the by the end of
[4:15:23] August no pressure for
[4:15:26] rent 40 million extra and that means we
[4:15:29] shall have made 100
[4:15:32] million from from now to
[4:15:39] Aug now if we are giving the way we are
[4:15:42] giving
[4:15:44] when others are sleeping others
[4:15:46] are but if all of us
[4:15:49] come and we and we come and
[4:15:54] together and we triple what we are
[4:15:58] giving it means by the end of
[4:16:04] August we shall have enough money for
[4:16:07] our
[4:16:08] land because because we shall have um 6
[4:16:13] 78 we shall have 180
[4:16:16] millions and surely I can tell you we
[4:16:18] will find land around that price or
[4:16:21] something like
[4:16:22] that by August if we triple our
[4:16:28] eorts you who is
[4:16:30] giving you I I I Tred to ask
[4:16:34] around let me ask let me just show you
[4:16:37] an example brother brother Brian God
[4:16:41] bless you how much have you been giving
[4:16:43] weekly 15 15 is it possible for you to
[4:16:48] triple it in a
[4:16:53] week
[4:16:56] uh it's not possible now is it possible
[4:16:59] to add it's possible to add and then you
[4:17:01] make it double not
[4:17:03] triple yeah it's possible he's is not
[4:17:06] able to Triple is able to
[4:17:09] double sister Monica how much have you
[4:17:11] been giving a week
[4:17:13] okay are you whatever you've been giving
[4:17:15] are you able to triple it are you able
[4:17:18] to double it uhhuh h Sister Mary are you
[4:17:21] able to double
[4:17:24] it no I'm I'm just you're not committing
[4:17:27] I'm just asking are you able to double
[4:17:29] it like the ability not the decision
[4:17:32] okay you're not deciding I'm asking the
[4:17:34] ability if you cut off some other things
[4:17:36] are you able
[4:17:39] to oh you're able to triple it double
[4:17:44] many people who are giving the on have
[4:17:47] asked I know they
[4:17:49] give and sister Grace you have been
[4:17:52] consistent God bless
[4:17:54] you for sister Grace she has never
[4:17:58] missed a
[4:18:00] week am is always the the number one
[4:18:04] there I know because she's in my group
[4:18:06] so God bless Grace but I'm sure you can
[4:18:09] trip what you giving
[4:18:14] most of us who have been giving we can
[4:18:19] double if we
[4:18:21] doubled and the people have not been
[4:18:25] giving you pay what you have not given
[4:18:27] for 36
[4:18:30] weeks and you also begin giving
[4:18:35] consistently by August we shall buy our
[4:18:39] land
[4:18:41] but if if we continue the way we
[4:18:47] are like
[4:18:50] that when August
[4:18:52] comes we are going to begin spending
[4:18:56] what we are
[4:18:59] giving if we giving 4
[4:19:03] million if we are giving 4
[4:19:06] million uh we shall because every month
[4:19:09] we pay 800,000
[4:19:12] it means we shall go
[4:19:15] down to
[4:19:19] 3.2 and that will make us go for another
[4:19:21] longer
[4:19:23] time and who knows even maybe the own of
[4:19:25] the building may say I'm increasing
[4:19:31] range because he doesn't want to make
[4:19:35] contracts so
[4:19:37] Brethren the only chance we
[4:19:41] have to bring this m to
[4:19:45] rest is to double our
[4:19:47] efforts and those who are not
[4:19:52] giving you start
[4:19:54] giving and you pay what you have not
[4:19:58] given and then cuz you know is 36
[4:20:03] weeks and I tell you
[4:20:06] Brethren then by August we can be able
[4:20:08] to achieve our goal
[4:20:16] connes so so far the pledges we have the
[4:20:20] extra ples we
[4:20:23] have is 1.7 million 1.7 today 1.4
[4:20:31] seven uh that
[4:20:34] means that is not for the land fun it is
[4:20:37] for the for the Youth
[4:20:39] Camp so we need a 4 14.5
[4:20:46] 5
[4:20:54] yes okay now the church
[4:20:58] members already you are paying the camp
[4:21:00] fee because I was being asked are you
[4:21:01] going to be to pay camp
[4:21:05] fee already you are paying more than
[4:21:08] camp
[4:21:09] fee so that's not a problem you pay more
[4:21:14] than what you pay at least
[4:21:18] 200,000 and those who can't pay what you
[4:21:20] can not lesser than the camp
[4:21:26] fe uh but um the pledges those who have
[4:21:29] made
[4:21:30] pledges please fulfill
[4:21:33] them and I was telling the
[4:21:36] people if we do not raise the money by
[4:21:40] pledges
[4:21:44] we have nowhere to run we shall run to
[4:21:47] our land
[4:21:50] fund so if you don't give the
[4:21:54] pledges then we are going to eat up
[4:21:56] again on our
[4:21:58] L and this is your money this our money
[4:22:03] for our church
[4:22:06] land and um I I know that the Lord will
[4:22:10] bless you financially
[4:22:13] so that you can be able to
[4:22:14] give i' I've been I've talking to some
[4:22:19] pastors um
[4:22:21] elsewhere who it it seemed as if they
[4:22:24] were burdening the people financially
[4:22:26] this that this
[4:22:29] that the church is looking for money for
[4:22:31] land
[4:22:35] Building and someone would say why don't
[4:22:37] we leave the
[4:22:39] preaching and this Youth Camp and
[4:22:44] we just come for
[4:22:46] prayers all those
[4:22:49] churches who have had people
[4:22:53] give of course there are those who never
[4:22:55] give no matter what you
[4:22:58] say but there are those who cat the
[4:23:02] Revelation and they give
[4:23:05] consistently they support the vision
[4:23:07] they support the
[4:23:10] bur God blesses them
[4:23:13] and that's why I was telling you I I'm
[4:23:15] not apologetic when I say we are going
[4:23:16] to raise millionaires from our
[4:23:23] fellowship God is a search of
[4:23:26] hearts and and to become
[4:23:30] rich is not out of a lot of
[4:23:34] prayers it's out of
[4:23:36] giving if you give the Bible says you
[4:23:39] shall do what
[4:23:42] you shall receive so we still need
[4:23:44] pledges of 13 million
