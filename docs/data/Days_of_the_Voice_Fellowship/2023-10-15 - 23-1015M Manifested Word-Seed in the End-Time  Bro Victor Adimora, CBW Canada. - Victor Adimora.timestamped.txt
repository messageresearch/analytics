[1:06:04] heart God got a hold of my heart when I
[1:06:06] was
[1:06:10] 17 it was a supernatural
[1:06:15] experience when I was 15 16 I was in the
[1:06:20] world I was just in high school or board
[1:06:23] in school
[1:06:26] and I was partying and drinking and
[1:06:33] smoking but one day Jesus came by my
[1:06:37] way
[1:06:39] amen he came by my way in my
[1:06:43] bedroom I began to cry out to God and
[1:06:45] say
[1:06:47] Lord why does it have to be this
[1:06:51] way I didn't hear a response
[1:06:55] but I started to see a
[1:06:58] change a desire began growing in my
[1:07:03] heart which begin to push out the
[1:07:05] desires of the
[1:07:09] world and it begin to change me from the
[1:07:12] inside
[1:07:15] out the drinking
[1:07:18] went the smoking
[1:07:20] went the running around went
[1:07:25] the swearing
[1:07:27] went and I've never been the same ever
[1:07:32] since that's the transforming power of
[1:07:35] the
[1:07:37] word when Jesus comes into a
[1:07:41] life and changes them from the inside
[1:07:45] out they can never be the
[1:07:49] same power of God Amen let's stand to
[1:07:53] our feet

[1:09:49] Christ to fulfill the mind of God in
[1:09:52] this last AG
[1:09:56] as a prophet would
[1:09:57] say from the back part of the mind of
[1:10:02] God God had a
[1:10:04] purpose and his purpose was to have the
[1:10:07] preeminence in the
[1:10:10] people to express his
[1:10:14] attributes and that's what we're here to
[1:10:17] do our purpose goes beyond
[1:10:22] working our purpose goes beyond making
[1:10:26] money our purpose goes beyond
[1:10:30] eating our purpose goes beyond even
[1:10:33] coming to
[1:10:35] church it goes into the manifestation of
[1:10:37] the Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:41] God where now you begin to bring
[1:10:45] forth the very promised word of God for
[1:10:51] today amen let's read

[1:11:02] first
[1:11:22] okay
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:39] am and I'll read here behold what manner
[1:11:42] of love the father has bestowed upon us
[1:11:44] that we should be called the sons of God
[1:11:47] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:11:50] because it knew him not verse two belov
[1:11:53] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:11:56] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:11:58] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:12:01] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:12:04] as he is and every man that hath this
[1:12:07] hope in him purifies himself even as he
[1:12:10] is pure you may have your
[1:12:14] seats the prophet of God would say here
[1:12:16] in the message God rich in
[1:12:21] Mercy he said God is the
[1:12:25] word and it was made flesh and dwelt
[1:12:28] amongst
[1:12:30] us that he might bring
[1:12:33] forth the other attributes of
[1:12:37] God the body of
[1:12:41] Jesus was the very body of
[1:12:44] God Moses seen him
[1:12:48] pass the back part of
[1:12:50] him no man had seen his face
[1:12:54] but now we see
[1:12:56] him we have beheld
[1:12:58] him see him as the
[1:13:02] sacrifice he was an attribute of God
[1:13:06] displayed the
[1:13:08] word and when any believer comes to
[1:13:13] God he become God's attribute of his
[1:13:19] word he is used to manifest that Word of
[1:13:26] Promise for this
[1:13:28] day so when God's called
[1:13:32] you whether you're born in the
[1:13:35] message whether you come into the
[1:13:38] message God's called you to manifest his
[1:13:43] attributes all that God
[1:13:46] was he poured into
[1:13:48] Christ and all that Christ
[1:13:51] was he's poured into you and
[1:13:54] I he's poured every
[1:13:57] attribute he's poured his
[1:13:59] power he's poured his
[1:14:02] anointing he's poured Faith he's poured
[1:14:06] love into you that you might manifest
[1:14:08] who he
[1:14:11] is the Unseen
[1:14:13] God is here amongst
[1:14:16] us he's here manifesting through your
[1:14:21] flesh we not looking for a corporate
[1:14:23] body to
[1:14:25] come we're not looking for the second
[1:14:27] coming of brother
[1:14:29] Bram but we're looking for the
[1:14:31] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[1:14:33] of
[1:14:34] God we're looking for the expression of
[1:14:37] Jesus Christ again
[1:14:39] today as he was in his corporate
[1:14:42] body he said um he said more Works than
[1:14:46] these will you
[1:14:48] do it's not that we're going to do more
[1:14:50] Works than
[1:14:52] ourselves so that we're going to do
[1:14:54] Greater
[1:14:56] Works but that more Works shall we do
[1:14:59] because it's a many membered
[1:15:04] body and so God's
[1:15:07] purpose is to bring Sons and Daughters
[1:15:09] of God to
[1:15:12] maturity to manifest his life to the
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:16] world and to find the last elected seat
[1:15:19] of
[1:15:22] God that we can go on a
[1:15:25] Rapture and remember the Rapture is a
[1:15:28] body of
[1:15:32] Believers so I'm dependent on

[1:15:49] come
[1:15:50] from so the same God that purposed in
[1:15:53] you has purposed in
[1:15:57] me and when that last elected
[1:16:02] seed comes to the revelation of who they
[1:16:06] are the Rapture will take
[1:16:09] place amen the denominations of tus
[1:16:12] Rapture is an event yes it is an
[1:16:16] event but this
[1:16:18] message this
[1:16:20] Prophet this word has taught us that
[1:16:24] it's a body of
[1:16:27] Believers which is a born again
[1:16:31] experience which is the revelation of
[1:16:33] Jesus Christ in
[1:16:35] you
[1:16:38] amen so what is the proof of a
[1:16:41] manifested
[1:16:45] seed the elect of
[1:16:48] God will hear his
[1:16:51] voice amen we cash the elect of
[1:16:55] God will hear his
[1:16:58] voice amen the Bible says here in John
[1:17:02] chapter
[1:17:04] 10 my sheep hear my
[1:17:08] voice and I know
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:22] them
[1:17:24] of the message of the
[1:17:26] hour so it's more than coming to
[1:17:30] church it's more than just listening to
[1:17:34] tap but now it goes into
[1:17:38] understanding what the prophet is
[1:17:41] saying it goes into a divine
[1:17:46] revelation of what this Prophet
[1:17:50] taught my sheep hear my voice
[1:17:55] the Sheep of
[1:17:57] God hear the word
[1:18:01] expressed the Sheep of
[1:18:03] God hear the word
[1:18:07] expressed so they it goes beyond the
[1:18:10] sound of the
[1:18:12] message it goes beyond a
[1:18:15] feeling it goes beyond
[1:18:19] emotion it goes beyond coming to the
[1:18:21] altar
[1:18:23] it goes beyond reading your Bible and
[1:18:25] praying every day but it goes now to
[1:18:28] where those things bring forth a
[1:18:32] life brings forth the life of Jesus
[1:18:36] Christ where it's not I that lives
[1:18:39] anymore but it's Christ that
[1:18:42] lives your friends ask what happened to
[1:18:46] you your wife asked what happened to you
[1:18:49] your children ask what happened to you
[1:18:52] said I met
[1:18:54] God I've never been the
[1:18:56] same I've been changed from the inside
[1:19:00] out Chang and my nature change my
[1:19:03] emotions aren't the
[1:19:05] same my desires aren't the
[1:19:07] same the things I used to do I do them
[1:19:10] no more because I've Been
[1:19:13] Changed by the renewing of my
[1:19:16] mind because it's God's transforming
[1:19:19] power of the
[1:19:21] SE seed of God has been
[1:19:25] there before the foundation of the
[1:19:28] world put inside of you a
[1:19:32] desire and so you come through the muck
[1:19:34] and the
[1:19:37] mud like that little
[1:19:40] Li the Lily comes through the
[1:19:44] mud and it fights its way through the
[1:19:50] Li and it fights through the mud
[1:19:54] and then it expresses its
[1:19:57] beauty and that's who how you and I
[1:20:01] are amen the prophet said that we
[1:20:04] bypassed our
[1:20:07] theophany to come into the world to be
[1:20:10] tempted amen that we might be
[1:20:13] tried to express the gold of
[1:20:17] God which is a Christlike
[1:20:20] character try do the fiery furnace of
[1:20:25] affli God allowed us to bypass that we
[1:20:27] might Express him as a
[1:20:31] Healer that he can express himself as a
[1:20:34] savior he can express himself as a
[1:20:38] deliverer he can express himself as a
[1:20:42] Transformer what is it is God expressing
[1:20:45] his

[1:42:36] bride amen he predestinated a prde for
[1:42:40] whom he did for
[1:42:42] no he also did
[1:42:45] predestin to be
[1:42:47] conformed to the image of his son
[1:42:52] that he might be the
[1:42:54] firstborn among many
[1:42:57] Brethren amen
[1:42:59] moreover whom he did
[1:43:02] predestinate them he also
[1:43:05] called and whom he
[1:43:07] called then he also
[1:43:10] justifi whom me
[1:43:12] Justified then he also
[1:43:14] glorified amen God for ordained a
[1:43:18] plan that would Express his for
[1:43:23] all that God
[1:43:25] was church all that God
[1:43:28] was the
[1:43:30] creator of the heavens and the Earth all
[1:43:34] that he was before he was
[1:43:37] God brother would say that before God
[1:43:41] was God he was eloh the self-existent
[1:43:46] one amen amen because God is an object
[1:43:50] of worship
[1:43:52] brother would say that he created angels
[1:43:55] to Angels begin to
[1:43:58] worship and then he became God Amen but
[1:44:02] before
[1:44:03] that El amen so before God was
[1:44:09] gone amen out of him come the
[1:44:14] logos the Loos was the
[1:44:17] light the
[1:44:19] word that went out from God the word
[1:44:23] that went out at the
[1:44:25] beginning that went
[1:44:27] out amen which was the first begotten of
[1:44:29] the father Jesus
[1:44:32] Christ amen the logos went out from God
[1:44:36] the and it came
[1:44:39] down and took on
[1:44:42] flesh amen manifesting the
[1:44:45] fullness and the glory of
[1:44:49] God so I want you to follow me follow me
[1:44:54] stay with me for a few more minutes I
[1:44:55] won't be too
[1:44:56] long but I want you to
[1:44:59] understand that almighty
[1:45:02] God the Bible says God is a
[1:45:06] spirit so that Spirit
[1:45:08] God When sin came into the
[1:45:11] garden when there was a fall in the
[1:45:14] garden when the serpent beguiled
[1:45:18] Eve God had a plan for
[1:45:22] Redemption and that plan for Redemption
[1:45:25] God cannot die as a
[1:45:28] spirit the spirit cannot
[1:45:30] die and so God had to come in the
[1:45:34] flesh to die to be
[1:45:39] kolk kinsman
[1:45:41] redeemer with
[1:45:43] man he couldn't die as an
[1:45:46] angel because an angel is in kin with
[1:45:49] man
[1:45:52] let me put it this way you
[1:45:54] understand Angelic
[1:45:56] seed can't bring forth human
[1:46:01] seed right so if you understand what I'm
[1:46:03] saying so a there there's no there's no
[1:46:05] seed of angels but Angelic seed can't
[1:46:08] bring forth human
[1:46:11] seed human seed can only bring forth
[1:46:14] human
[1:46:15] SE and
[1:46:17] angels are angels okay so God had to
[1:46:22] come into the
[1:46:24] flesh you had to become a
[1:46:26] human in order to bring
[1:46:30] back back to God
[1:46:33] again amen so when we saw
[1:46:37] Christ when we saw the fullness of God
[1:46:40] in
[1:46:41] flesh we saw
[1:46:43] God Amen for
[1:46:46] Jesus was the very expression of
[1:46:49] God was the very Heart Of
[1:46:52] God Jesus was the very love of
[1:46:56] God Jesus was the very power of
[1:46:59] God all that God
[1:47:02] was he poured into
[1:47:07] Christ so when Christ was upon the
[1:47:10] Earth the Bible says he was he was he
[1:47:13] was right he was comly that nobody his
[1:47:15] cess wasn't
[1:47:18] nice he wasn't good to look
[1:47:22] upon he wasn't Rich he wasn't
[1:47:25] wealthy he didn't have a place to lay
[1:47:27] his
[1:47:28] head but he walked amongst
[1:47:31] us the creator of heavens and
[1:47:34] earth walking in
[1:47:36] flesh to do what the Bible says Jesus
[1:47:41] came to seek and
[1:47:44] save those who were
[1:47:47] lost now not all
[1:47:51] will be
[1:47:52] saved John chapter 3 says for God so
[1:47:56] loved the
[1:47:57] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:48:01] son now listen that whosoever
[1:48:05] believes so sometimes people take that
[1:48:09] scripture and say oh how can you sa the
[1:48:11] whole world so be
[1:48:14] saved but the Bible says is
[1:48:18] whosoever believes
[1:48:21] shall be saved so that's the key you
[1:48:24] must believe the
[1:48:26] word amen this message you must believe
[1:48:30] the
[1:48:31] word only believe all things are
[1:48:35] possible only believe this word will
[1:48:39] take
[1:48:41] you amen I
[1:48:43] want amen he is the Shak
[1:48:46] [Applause]
[1:48:47] Glory he is the logos
[1:48:51] that went out from
[1:48:53] God God therefore Christ who is our
[1:48:58] life he cannot be a
[1:49:02] denomination amen catch this very
[1:49:05] closely so when you go out to work or to
[1:49:07] school or wherever you
[1:49:09] go and someone says to you what's wrong
[1:49:12] with
[1:49:14] denominations what's wrong with
[1:49:17] organizations what's wrong with creeds
[1:49:22] because Christ is not a
[1:49:25] denomination Christ is not an
[1:49:29] organization the word is
[1:49:32] eternal so if it come from
[1:49:34] Heaven it's got to go back to
[1:49:37] heaven and you come from
[1:49:39] heaven and you're going back to heaven
[1:49:42] but
[1:49:44] denominations are
[1:49:47] Earthbound amen dominations
[1:49:52] increase are
[1:49:55] Earthbound they're
[1:49:57] Earthbound it doesn't have the
[1:50:00] power to take you in a
[1:50:04] Rapture doesn't have the
[1:50:06] substance to change your
[1:50:09] body amen what you say what you say how
[1:50:13] is that
[1:50:15] so because the Bible remember the
[1:50:18] fullness of the word
[1:50:22] has to be expressed in this
[1:50:24] day all that God
[1:50:28] is has to be expressed
[1:50:31] today and so if you take a part of
[1:50:34] God and you leave the
[1:50:37] rest it becomes the
[1:50:40] denomination if you take a part of
[1:50:42] God and you leave the
[1:50:45] rest it becomes an
[1:50:48] organization and it stop
[1:50:51] moving on with
[1:50:53] God so that's why it's
[1:50:56] important so we must eat all the
[1:51:00] message eat all the
[1:51:02] words if it hurts you say
[1:51:06] out if you bless it you say
[1:51:09] Amen take the word into your mortal body
[1:51:14] into your spirit and into your soul and
[1:51:18] it will bring this body
[1:51:21] into subjection to the
[1:51:23] word amen hallelujah hallelujah remember
[1:51:28] it's the word that makes the
[1:51:31] difference amen Moses goes on and says
[1:51:35] here he said I beseech
[1:51:37] thee Show Me Your
[1:51:39] Glory he said I will make all my
[1:51:42] goodness pass over
[1:51:45] thee amen I will proclaim the name of
[1:51:49] the Lord before thee
[1:51:51] I will be gracious to whom I will be
[1:51:54] gracious I will show Mercy on whom I
[1:51:56] will show
[1:51:58] mercy and he said thou can't see my
[1:52:02] face for no man has seen my face and
[1:52:06] this church listen to the scripture here
[1:52:09] and the Lord
[1:52:10] said
[1:52:12] behold there is a place by
[1:52:16] me and thou shalt stand upon a rock
[1:52:20] amen there's a place by Jesus Christ
[1:52:23] there's a place for you in the
[1:52:25] world that places
[1:52:28] upon it's upon the rock of
[1:52:31] Revelation Amen Let the storms
[1:52:34] blow let men say what they want to
[1:52:37] say but this word is the revelation of
[1:52:41] God and when you stand on the
[1:52:44] word there's not enough gates of hell
[1:52:46] that can
[1:52:48] prevail amen hallelujah amen God's

[2:03:52] God's love letter
[2:03:56] to God's love letter to
[2:03:59] me amen and that's why he's come down

[2:04:14] the CH the wings of the
[2:04:17] Cherub over the ark over the Ark of the
[2:04:21] Covenant and the prophet would
[2:04:24] say that when that sh Glory begin to
[2:04:29] shine God's presence was
[2:04:32] there the Shak
[2:04:35] Glory the personal and Vindicated

[2:05:03] build the
[2:05:05] house and the priest could not
[2:05:08] enter into the house of the
[2:05:11] Lord because the glory of the
[2:05:14] Lord had filled the
[2:05:16] house and when all the
[2:05:20] children of Israel saw how the fire came
[2:05:23] down and the glory of the Lord upon the
[2:05:28] house amen they bowed themselves with
[2:05:32] their faces to the

[2:09:29] B to lay hold of God's
[2:09:33] promise because you begin to express his
[2:09:36] power his

[2:09:41] himself
[2:09:43] revealed
[2:09:45] amen and

[2:11:58] stands for and that she can do the
[2:12:00] Greater
[2:12:01] Works she will be an
[2:12:04] invincible if they get the true
[2:12:07] revelation of the two
[2:12:09] Spirits working within the framework of

[2:12:17] spirit discern and
[2:12:19] withstand discern and uh and and
[2:12:24] oppose the Antichrist
[2:12:27] Spirit Satan will be
[2:12:30] powerless he he will be as
[2:12:34] thwarted today is when Christ with stood
[2:12:37] his
[2:12:39] effort power over him in the
[2:12:42] desert yes Satan hates
[2:12:45] Revelation but we love it
[2:12:49] with true Revelation in our
[2:12:51] [Applause]
[2:12:53] lives the Gates of
[2:12:55] Hell cannot
[2:12:57] Prevail but we but we will prevail over
[2:13:05] the church it's not we
[2:13:10] will we have
[2:13:13] take it's now we're going to
[2:13:16] Prevail we are now
[2:13:19] Overcomers Jesus Christ it's not we're
[2:13:23] going to
[2:13:24] overcome now we are the sons of God
[2:13:29] manifested power of God overc every
[2:13:34] devil now we are the sons of God now we
[2:13:37] are the daughters of God now we're
[2:13:41] overcoming amen
[2:13:44] hallelujah hallelujah just a few more
[2:13:46] minutes just a few more minutes
[2:13:49] hallelujah
[2:13:50] amen hallelujah Church Hallelujah this
[2:13:54] is Rich amen amen so I'm going to skip
[2:13:58] one here but you become expressed
[2:14:04] image of his Vindicated
[2:14:10] headship so when you're born
[2:14:13] again when you've come into the
[2:14:15] body you begin to EXP
[2:14:19] Express his
[2:14:21] headship amen his
[2:14:24] headship so let me explain what headship
[2:14:28] is so brother R says
[2:14:30] here when the head unites with the
[2:14:34] body The Head and the body become
[2:14:38] one and this
[2:14:40] message has United the head with the
[2:14:43] body the purpose of this
[2:14:46] message is to unite the head with the
[2:14:49] body and that's why brother Bram said he
[2:14:53] said my
[2:14:54] message is to show the
[2:14:56] people that Jesus Christ is
[2:14:59] here he's not a far
[2:15:02] off he's
[2:15:05] right and church if you can
[2:15:08] see with eyes of
[2:15:10] Faith you will see the living savior
[2:15:15] here so the head shall
[2:15:19] which is the
[2:15:21] word is united with the
[2:15:24] body which is the
[2:15:26] word so the word meets the
[2:15:30] word and the prophet said when the word
[2:15:33] meets the
[2:15:35] word takes
[2:15:37] place amen the power of God is on
[2:15:40] display when the word meets the
[2:15:44] word the Earthly bride United with the
[2:15:46] Heavenly GR
[2:15:49] so now you begin to express his
[2:15:53] head begin to express his
[2:15:57] mind you begin to express the
[2:16:01] word hallelujah hallelujah let me lay
[2:16:04] something in here quickly here amen the
[2:16:06] prophet of God said
[2:16:09] here I read a scripture
[2:16:15] first just beareth me for a little bit
[2:16:17] here
[2:16:19] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[2:16:25] head for as much as he is the
[2:16:30] image and the glory of
[2:16:35] God but the woman is the glory of the
[2:16:39] man and I'm sure we all understand why
[2:16:42] Paul's saying
[2:16:44] this but Paul is basically saying
[2:16:47] pulling back from to
[2:16:49] Genesis he saying that the man was in
[2:16:51] the original
[2:16:54] Creation The Very image of
[2:16:56] God but the woman came out of the
[2:16:59] man Eve came out of the side
[2:17:03] of so that's what that's what Paul's
[2:17:05] saying here that's why he's saying the
[2:17:08] woman is the glory of the
[2:17:10] man the man is the image of the glory of
[2:17:14] God man should not cover his head
[2:17:18] but the woman should have her hair
[2:17:21] covered for the man is not of the
[2:17:25] woman but the woman of the
[2:17:28] man neither was the Man created for the
[2:17:32] woman but the woman for the
[2:17:35] man so I'm getting into something
[2:17:40] here for this
[2:17:42] cause ought the woman to have power over
[2:17:45] on her head
[2:17:49] because of the
[2:17:51] Angels
[2:17:53] nevertheless neither is The Man Without
[2:17:55] The
[2:17:57] Woman neither the woman without the
[2:18:01] man NE nevertheless neither is The Man
[2:18:04] Without The
[2:18:07] Woman neither the woman without the
[2:18:10] man in the
[2:18:12] Lord for as the woman is of the
[2:18:16] man even so is the man also by the
[2:18:21] woman but all things are of
[2:18:24] God Amen judge in
[2:18:28] yourselves is it comely that a woman
[2:18:30] pray unto God
[2:18:35] uncovered not nature itself teach
[2:18:39] you that if a man have long
[2:18:43] hair it is a shame unto
[2:18:46] him but if woman have long
[2:18:48] hair it is a glory to
[2:18:51] her for her hair is her
[2:18:55] covering so their sisters who have hair
[2:18:58] down to their
[2:18:59] heels and their sisters who have hair
[2:19:01] down to their
[2:19:03] ears but the prophet said don't cut
[2:19:06] it because when you cut your
[2:19:09] hair you are showing you're out of
[2:19:13] headship when you cut your hair sisters
[2:19:18] you are showing you're not under
[2:19:21] headship and when the brothers have long
[2:19:24] hair they're showing they're not under
[2:19:28] headship and that's what Paul is saying
[2:19:31] here he's saying that the woman should
[2:19:34] have her hair
[2:19:35] long and the man should cut his
[2:19:39] hair
[2:19:41] amen so brother would say now that long
[2:19:44] hair was a Nazarite
[2:19:46] vow
[2:19:50] it was showing that you're
[2:19:53] separated it was showing that you're
[2:19:55] consecrated unto
[2:19:57] God it was showing that you've given
[2:20:00] your life to
[2:20:02] Christ and that's what happens that the
[2:20:04] sister or the woman or the
[2:20:07] wife under the headship of the
[2:20:11] word and the man in his
[2:20:15] position the sister is in her
[2:20:18] position the man is is not without the
[2:20:22] woman and the woman is not without the
[2:20:27] man so it's not
[2:20:29] saying that that the man should push
[2:20:32] aside the
[2:20:34] woman and it's not saying that the woman
[2:20:37] should push aside
[2:20:39] the I don't know how it is
[2:20:42] here but in
[2:20:44] America the woman like to run the man
[2:20:52] and in other
[2:20:53] cases you have the
[2:20:55] men pushing down the
[2:20:59] women but in the mind of God that's not
[2:21:02] what God
[2:21:04] father in the mind of God that's not
[2:21:07] what he
[2:21:08] envisioned he envisioned that the twain
[2:21:11] shall be
[2:21:12] one the husband and the wife the man and
[2:21:16] the woman
[2:21:18] in their god-given
[2:21:20] positions in their god-given
[2:21:23] place sering
[2:21:25] God so they've come under headship of
[2:21:28] the
[2:21:30] word
[2:21:33] amen I'll just close with this here I've
[2:21:35] been long
[2:21:38] sorry I'll close with
[2:21:44] this so when you come into this body
[2:21:48] you begin to
[2:21:51] pulsate a
[2:21:53] life from another
[2:21:59] kingom so when I say
[2:22:01] Paul that means you have a
[2:22:06] heartbeat that means you're
[2:22:09] alive and when you begin to pulsate this
[2:22:13] life from another
[2:22:16] kingdom
[2:22:18] it shows that you're not of this
[2:22:20] world but you're from another
[2:22:23] world and the life inside of
[2:22:26] you is pulsating a life from another
[2:22:33] kingdom where Jesus Christ is
[2:22:36] King and that kingdom is the
[2:22:40] word and I'll close with this here that
[2:22:44] Kingdom the Bible says the Kingdom of
[2:22:46] Heaven is within
[2:22:48] you and that
[2:22:51] kingdom is the word of
[2:22:53] God spirit and
[2:22:56] life in your own
