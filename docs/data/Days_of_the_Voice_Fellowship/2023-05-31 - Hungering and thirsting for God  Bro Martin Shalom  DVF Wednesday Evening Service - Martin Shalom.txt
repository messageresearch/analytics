[Music] no I think we can begin from verses let us just begin from verse 1. Precious Jesus we thank you for the reading of the word we are reading yes I pray that Lord you take me out of the way come and speak to us just these few minutes we are having here give us the Revelation in Jesus name amen and seeing the multitude he went up into Mount and into mountain and when he was set his disciple came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught to them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for there is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed I the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in the heart for they shall see God blessed are the other are the peacekeepers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which Pastor which are persecuted for righteousness sake for Vera is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when you shall when men shall reveal you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for your sake rejoice and be exceedingly for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophet which were before you material is my [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] amen Amina praise the Lord this evening I want us to share on a hungering and thirsting for God [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord and here in verses 6 where we have just right the Bible says that blessed are they blessed are they which do hang and fast after righteousness for they shall be filled um praise be to God so tonight we are going to go alongside that line together praise be to God brother when I mean the message he defied this as fast is a painful desire yeah [Music] amen how many knows tests all of us we're not in Utah so thirsty and I want to tell you when you are fast you cannot quench it with something different amen man you must look for water somewhere and every human being fast blessed with the name of the Lord and all of us we know hunger if you really feel really really hungry I remember one time Pastor he was preaching and he said that never joke with they are hungry angry man this foreign I Define when they are just lightings [Music] and when they reach there what they can find nothing not even a smoke they will start with the kids foreign [Music] [Applause] after the things of the world [Applause] praise be to God you shall be filled when there is a hunger and thirst in your soul when you're hungry and fasting after God when there is that deep calling unto the day somewhere you always respond towards amen and when you are not fasting and when you are not hungry brother sister there is something wrong somewhere ah I assume you are there you don't get fast you don't get hungry will you just sit and relax and it starts bursting around us like I'm becoming superhuman to watch they no longer feel hungry it is okay probably I'm fine let me tell you if you are on your right mind when you're in right you are right you will go and seek for medical attention amen mean you will call Dr Peter and tell him brother I think there is something wrong I no longer gets thrust no hunger amen and then he will he will advise you blessed with the name of the Lord and that will be one of the clear signs that something is wrong with you and you have no time you don't eat food and you're not hungry something is not right in your life foreign water for you to be alive amen I'm talking about hungering and fasting for God blessed with the name of the Lord how many of us do online fast for God and if we use that discretion that anger is another definition you really feel like you should even just get a drop of water blessed with the name of the Lord because the border is demanding [Music] but remember there is another man inside amen and David says as the hard palate for water broke away to my soul fast after God our soul is meant with us and every Christian must be fast after God when your soul is thirsting after God [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord just like the way it is physically that you can't spend a day without taking water but sometimes Christians spend days without prayer whatever they don't read the word they don't pray they don't first some even claimed that the prophet first lady for them I remember but let me hope that that group is not here you will have to fast for yourself nobody will fast for you some claim that the groom is here there's no need for fasting [Music] we are living in the ends of the end times we all to be more serious than even the first Runners more serious than those who started this race because we are seeing the Finishing Line [Music] blessed in the name of the Lord now we are the people who have reached who are reaching the finishing life and Church of God either you are fasting after God all you are fasting after the devil [Music] you will never be neutral and if you don't if you're not fasting after God that is a clear sign that you are fasting after the devil the things of the world if you don't have time to pray that is [Music] hey man Nina blessed in the name of the Lord listen to this quote and any man that is born of the spirit of God um the world and they are separated in different life because they can't digest it are the things of God blessed with the name of the Lord you let us look to be something simple but fast is the drive is that driving force a Christian who does not have fast for God um you cannot get anywhere dust is that driving force you cannot receive the Holy Ghost without faster you cannot receive God in your soul unless she was bursting after God and you cannot have fast for God unless you are reading the word unless you're listening to the world unless you're praying and fasting that is the only way blessed with the name of the Lord amen Amina if you are if you have come hungering and thirsting for God the angels of God will direct you to that spot to find it amen Amina but if you don't if you're not hungry they will not die they will direct you nowhere you must have that thirstyness are you sure but where your heart is where your riches that is where your heart will be if your wishes is with God your heart will be where where God where God is word is amen that's where the service is going on blessed in the name of the Lord sometimes things of God we just take it for granted very busy when is that works because they want to be appreciated by his or her boss sometimes they even go over time because there is some cabinets they wake up in the morning foreign and when they are out there at their workplace is even the one will bring the Jazz but find them in church we must hang to take it we must this is a must because if you don't have anger for God forget about Rapture amen this is the driving force that's how he sold fast after God made me away and he's asking God When shall I appear before every time you will ask God awareness Rapture happening because we're Desiring to go and see your savior amen [Applause] Hallelujah you must be missing something blessed be the name of the Lord you know when you have examples in the Bible um I'll ask him some questions amen they relaxed and they lost that hunger to go deeper in God Amen God came and rebuked back to the first love amen there's a message I was listening to I was saying the message called deceived Church by uh deceived Church by the world's bench foreign holding it blessed the name of the Lord praise the Lord when there is no hungering for the things of God whatever hungering for God is a sign that something is wrong spiritually when a child does not have fast or hunger for food we as parents the first thing who will deworm them amen you will go get some deworming tablets [Music] and for your information for that truck to work you must give them when they're hungry because they have he has some people people name inside there are some aliens inside so you have to first make that when maybe the people's just woken up in the morning or you adults that's when you take that woman tablets and those guys who are eating inside they will think that they'll put their food poison blessed in the name of the Lord why don't you eat when you're satisfied why don't you eat when he was why don't you take that medicine when you are satisfied when you are all disturbed by being satisfied by the out of us wait when you are hungry when you put them tablets amen man you cannot get anger of God's word amen you have to fast and vomit the things of the world I didn't ask yourself why don't I feel the burden to pray foreign bless the read the name of the Lord we must hunger to God and fast after righteousness the only thing Jesus Jesus told us for righteousness not fasting after the things of the world not fasting after our own businesses amen it is good to do those businesses amen amen [Music] listen here when the people begin to Hunger for More Of God there is always been more of God amen every time you feel you you are lacking more of God of God for you amen and we must come with that hunger in our hearts let us never ever lose our conviction and of judgment praise be to God you sleep without praying you don't feel conviction in your house you wake up in the morning without praying and you're just okay you come let in church there is something wrong somewhere go pick the modest bench out of the basement let us come back on our knees blessed be the name of the Lord there is something wrong somewhere but when we have the fast for God what I'm talking about um you know the seriousness you thought Jesus was coming next to you amen and you are very careful in your world every time you get time you pray you fast what happened where is amen Amina but what I'm saying is wrong for Christian not to like to oh okay it is wrong for a Christian prayerlessness is as chibi praise be to God and how do we know that we pray look at ourselves you know the Bible says the word of God is sharper than it is the world is going on the word Sons Our Lives we know ourselves amen better than any other any person else we know the kind of life we are living outside there whether it's prayer life or it is in our days it is very hard uh rather than unless we are serious with the god the coming of the Lord can fall on us unaware us something unique was happening in the spiritual world blessed with the name of the Lord something unique was happening with Abra why do we change Ibrahim Lord but because of Abraham's prayer God send angels to go and visited with him blessed with the name of the Lord and today the world is in darkness amen man people are moving from where and where they are going for somebody their pilgrimage come to seek blessings from different countries they have come to worship the day as the sins are and for you you are blessed because you know that the blessing of the Lord is in his wife how old we to be on our knees and to thank God for this Revelation blessed be the name of the Lord some majority took this the word of God for granted and I believe even some of Noah's family but because apply the token in prayer amen Amen brother Peter is a medical personnel he knows he can tell us what is happening in the world today even the very malaria is resistant to the drugs no longer going however it used to be what is happening we are living in the end times Chicago foreign this is not guesswork you must be sure I must be sure that I'm saved I must know the ground I'm standing blessed with the name of the Lord I must know that I'm a born-again Christian you must be sure brother that you met God this is let us not deceive ourselves Let each one of us be sure because Jesus is coming soon things are getting hard and harder every single time but the Bible tells us when we see these things happening politics is going back to the world they are they are just the same as the world what are you going to do are you going to act like others the Bible tells us when we see these things happen and look up our Redemption is amen you will not be in position not be able to look up foreign you will not know your promises unless we go back because Jesus says the righteousness they shall be filled God has never lied in this world brother when we seek out the righteous it is confirmed we will be filled you must be filled I must be filled musician must be failed some leaders must be filled our children because Jesus praise be to God amen if you have if you have if you have to force yourself constantly to try to press and do what is right or correct and the world is still hungering in you there is something wrong the Holy Spirit you will not hunger for the world Amen and if it is hard for you to go to church and just press yourself to come when the church is open there is something wrong with that Spirit don't explain anything this is the word there is something foreign when we have the fear of Christ in our hearts it will bring conviction and we will see how how uh how unable we are how you fail God how you are not moving the way God wants you to know do you know yet God has a place he wants you to move because a very quick word blessed with the name of the Lord and when the Holy Ghost comes he will show you those areas amen the spirit of God will run you right single to stretch the church every time the door opens for Fellowship you know each time we hear us towards in the days of Noah we are looking at the floods and the people who were seriously look at the conditions amen we should not forget to look at that the state of the condition of of the people's heart in Noah's time very well religious they are the pastors as well they are preachers as well but the voice of God was within us Jesus said that they were building and giving into marriage don't only look at that and stop when somebody is building I have to build my permanent home foreign Gamba when the last ship will end and again it says what is holding the word of God again but when the prayer is taken wait and see what will happen but are you prepared may you wait to get sick that is where my question is you know I was I was I was reading different scriptures and I was pondering in this thing I was looking at the Revival the state of Revival the condition of Revival the heart that brings Revival and I said God help me we must be revived this is the message of restoration it is given to us amen amen must be restored what brings restoration is the hand of God in our eyes that is may God give him our hunger and fast for him says here in the message the queen of shebling that you almost have to hire people in the United States to come and hear the gospel America you need to supply some 50 or 20 000. come and listen to the word if we do that here you could do overflow this place blessed in the name of the Lord a long time ago when the church God form and everything the people begin to Crave uh to crave more of God the Bible of the Spirit come into existence see you were hungering and fasting for more of God and as long as you thirst for more of God there is bound to be more of God somewhere to respond to that your heart goes hunger and fasting some kind of a holy ghost Revival will break out somewhere God wants to come down and make love with you he's seeking fasting hungering trying to get some of you such a heart to make love to you foreign amen they are they are improving on themselves everything you must do your part no questions

always been against it but it's and I think a man that has the spirit of God in him would be against it because the spirit of God would testify that it is wrong to him don't never let the spirit of worship and Spirit of worship and that cleaning Holiness ever die among you know keep that light burning for it is the life line of the church what is the lifeline of the church the spirit of worship and cleaning Holiness that is the lifeline of the church he says we should keep that back our people are getting away from that from the practice practice of Holiness we begin to let down many bars
