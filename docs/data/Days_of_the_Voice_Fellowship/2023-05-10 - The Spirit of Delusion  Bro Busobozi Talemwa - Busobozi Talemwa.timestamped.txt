[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] I'm going to speak on something which
[0:11] affects most of us
[0:15] especially the younger generation the
[0:17] younger people the younger people
[0:20] really most of my summons if you've been
[0:23] following me really can help a lot of
[0:25] young people
[0:29] and I'm not saying it does not help the
[0:31] other ones
[0:34] but I trust that you to be of help now I
[0:37] want to speak on the spirit of delusion
[0:41] you see the spirit of delusion is a very
[0:45] cunning spirit
[0:47] is a very stubborn Spirit
[0:50] you see if I try to look into the
[0:53] dictionary
[0:56] to try and find the meaning of the word
[0:59] delusion foreign
[1:08] [Music]
[1:20] foreign
[1:33] Ty held despite the encode providable
[1:39] evidence to the contrary occurring
[1:41] especially in mental conditions
[1:46] a
[1:47] beliefs that someone holds
[1:50] and is convinced this is truth
[1:54] despite
[1:59] here he says they incontrovertible you
[2:02] know they despite the
[2:05] the uh explanations
[2:16] you tell him this is
[2:27] what he thinks is right
[2:30] you will show him evidence
[2:33] you will show him evidence infallible
[2:36] evidence
[2:38] you will prove to him Beyond reasonable
[2:44] what you are telling him is
[2:50] what I know is what is Right Church
[2:54] truth now that is the spirit
[2:56] and it's uh called delusion
[3:00] and mostly it is in mental cases
[3:05] conditions
[3:07] whereby someone is mentally challenged
[3:12] whereby they even here we take we call
[3:14] them Botanical cases
[3:18] and whereby they believe there's
[3:21] something
[3:22] and you know they believe maybe they are
[3:25] the president
[3:27] and you know those who started
[3:30] psychology
[3:31] they try to learn how to deal with such
[3:34] people
[3:35] questions
[3:37] you find different conditions
[3:40] some people who believe there's
[3:42] something
[3:43] you can just say I am Obama's Obama
[3:47] oh I am Trump who runs that Donald Trump
[3:49] Joy Biden Obama said Joy Biden I'm the
[3:51] president of America
[3:54] and you can't convince him otherwise
[3:57] jump for you to talk to him you need to
[4:01] salute to him
[4:02] respect to him
[4:09] now it's a condition
[4:11] it's a mental condition
[4:14] you know according to
[4:17] um medicine
[4:18] according to the Bible Bible is a spirit
[4:23] it's a spirit for you and it's called
[4:26] delusion
[4:28] not everyone gets this listen listen
[4:31] church not everyone gets the spirit of
[4:33] delusions
[4:35] but those who get the spirit of the
[4:38] illusion get it this way
[4:41] but God gives you the truth
[4:44] hallelujah man but when you say the
[4:48] truth
[4:49] you do not get to appreciate it
[5:11] so it comes only after rejecting the
[5:15] truth
[5:17] and that's why Believers of the word all
[5:20] over the world
[5:23] I love us of the truth
[5:26] you must always be a lover of the truth
[5:30] and I say what is the truth
[5:34] Jesus Christ is the true yes he said I
[5:38] am the way I am the truth
[5:42] no man can come to the father
[5:47] Jesus yes he's not here physically
[5:50] where is Jesus
[5:58] this is not a textbook kind of seek we
[6:03] have a lot of books that people call us
[6:06] textbooks or reference books or
[6:08] something like that
[6:10] those of you who have gone to University
[6:15] a lot of reference books
[6:19] this one here is more than just a
[6:22] reference
[6:24] this one is the book foreign
[6:51] [Applause]
[7:19] and Beyond this one
[7:22] there is no law
[7:25] praise the name of the Lord
[7:28] Hallelujah
[7:32] now
[7:34] this word much you know is what we
[7:37] believe us believe
[7:39] and anyone who doesn't believe this
[7:43] I think you need to bring it down a
[7:44] little bit it's vibrating I don't know
[7:45] who doesn't bring anyone who doesn't
[7:47] believe this word
[7:52] God
[7:53] will accept certain spirits
[7:57] to come and attack them
[8:02] and this spirits will be very strong
[8:06] that you can almost not break them
[8:09] it's called illusion
[8:12] people will start believing lies
[8:16] and
[8:18] to attend next single movie they will
[8:20] not actually know that they are
[8:22] believing lies
[8:24] that's what I want to prove to you this
[8:26] morning
[8:30] but the devil has tried to bring
[8:33] and you will see actually by the end of
[8:36] the service
[8:39] so many people deceived
[8:43] foreign
[9:04] therefore is now working in the children
[9:06] of disobedience
[9:14] [Music]
[9:18] at the beginning they are disobedient to
[9:21] the true word of God
[9:24] that's right
[9:27] they're disobedient to the true word of
[9:29] God
[9:32] the word of God is
[9:36] the Bible says when any man comes to God
[9:40] first you must believe that he is
[9:45] a rewarder of all those are diligently
[9:48] Seekers
[9:57] to follow whatever he tells you
[10:00] believe whatever he tells us don't come
[10:04] to go to the bed
[10:05] don't come to God to give him your
[10:08] opinion
[10:09] you don't come to God to suggest to him
[10:12] so what do you think you should do
[10:15] what do you think he should have done
[10:17] but when you come to God
[10:20] he wants you
[10:22] to submit whatever
[10:42] [Music]
[10:51] just cause a disbelief
[10:58] and their questions
[11:01] meant to desire knowledge
[11:04] but whoever needs knowledge or wisdom
[11:09] I guess the Bible says God gives it
[11:12] if you have a clean heart if you have an
[11:16] opinion
[11:19] God will answer all your questions
[11:22] but when you come and you don't
[11:25] understand a few things
[11:27] together
[11:32] [Music]
[11:36] am I talking to someone else
[11:39] you are going to heaven again on the
[11:42] blessings that you believe the whole
[11:43] world
[11:46] I may not understand everything here
[11:50] I tell you this I believe everything is
[12:10] a problem there's a there's a question I
[12:13] heard
[12:16] I have believed it
[12:20] As I Grew I grew the message
[12:23] I came to land that you see it was
[12:25] difficult for me to understand
[12:28] in my early years
[12:30] the first two years
[12:32] and I was preaching but I wasn't
[12:36] understanding
[12:38] I never preached about it
[12:41] because it wasn't coming it wasn't like
[12:44] coming to me
[12:46] I would I would preach it sometimes I
[12:48] see it
[12:49] but then when I go back and I read when
[12:53] I'm sharing with other people they begin
[12:55] to challenge me
[13:00] I can't understand
[13:02] so someone would come and tell you
[13:05] if God is
[13:08] who what was that voice yeah
[13:12] and yet Jesus is God
[13:15] yes
[13:18] of the father
[13:27] okay okay if Jesus was there was God
[13:31] why was he praying
[13:35] wasn't praying to he to the father
[13:38] that means there's another fact
[13:41] this is
[14:20] again
[14:35] the sin which cannot be forgiveness
[14:40] refusing to believe the world but the
[14:43] Bible says they that are born of God
[14:45] now
[15:23] soon
[15:26] I want to say that God is
[15:28] someone came out of a question that my
[15:30] daughter asked me
[15:33] Elizabeth came I don't know where she
[15:35] got the question from Elizabeth
[15:39] but she came and asked me
[15:42] why do some people use tattoos on their
[15:45] bodies
[15:47] [Music]
[15:55] some of these people are deluded
[16:02] and I want you to say that God
[16:05] is a master artist
[16:09] God loves arts and you see he made many
[16:14] creatures
[16:15] he met every creature in their own kinds
[16:19] and every creature was supposed to bring
[16:22] forth of its own kinds
[16:26] see some of the scriptures I have them
[16:27] on the screen
[16:29] God also made man
[16:32] in his own image the man was supposed to
[16:36] live or to be above all these creatures
[17:42] foreign
[18:03] [Music]
[18:41] then you foreign
[19:00] [Music]

[21:11] and I said are you sure it is a wild
[21:13] animals
[21:14] that elephant was not termed
[21:20] and we are supposed to be like putting a
[21:23] bed and a zoo
[21:24] we are supposed to live above all the
[21:26] Creations
[21:31] all these creatures
[21:35] why is it like the way it is
[21:43] and he has deceived the human race
[21:49] instead of believing the word of God

[21:56] hallelujah amen I hope everybody can see
[22:00] that
[22:01] now let us look at this slide number two

[25:37] so in the beginning God he created
[25:40] heaven
[25:41] and therefore for us we are just a
[25:44] little bit Katie fatally cartoon of the
[25:47] creation of God

[1:02:51] how they think yeah
[1:02:56] foreign now
[1:02:59] you might not like it
[1:03:02] but if the word says it
[1:03:04] if the word shows us the way and we are
[1:03:08] following the World Series
[1:03:15] God has gathered nature
[1:03:18] let me put it this way there are even
[1:03:21] some things what do you need to we don't
[1:03:23] need the word the Bible the words to
[1:03:26] tell us
[1:03:28] what I'm preaching today that's why I'm
[1:03:31] not even reading too much scriptures
[1:03:35] the Bible says doesn't even nature
[1:03:39] itself teach you
[1:03:42] foreign
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:04:07] go back to the last one go back to it
[1:04:10] go back together yes now see this one
[1:04:14] and you find boys
[1:04:17] rushing to love girls
[1:04:21] and then you expect a woman with those
[1:04:23] kind of things to raise your children
[1:04:27] in the fear of God
[1:04:32] you are also deceived the woman that
[1:04:36] does it is
[1:04:45] whatever is inspiring
[1:04:48] she's trying to copy this
[1:04:52] and you will find that the spirit of
[1:04:54] this
[1:04:55] it might even be the one ruling
[1:05:02] foreign
[1:05:17] you say what is that pasta just shoes
[1:05:20] it is not just shoes
[1:05:23] whoever made it and whoever buys it has
[1:05:27] a at the speed of delusions
[1:05:29] to try and copy the other one
[1:05:35] is not good enough you should have feet
[1:05:38] like like the hoofs over of a horse
[1:05:43] so they will buy these ones
[1:05:45] and they will begin walking
[1:05:49] foreign
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:14] foreign
[1:06:31] I I had to put this picture so you can
[1:06:33] be confused
[1:06:35] let me ask what is that
[1:06:40] what is this
[1:06:44] you see others yeah this is a snake
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:53] actually this is a man with a tattoo
[1:07:19] that's why the Bible does not allow
[1:07:21] people to use tattoos
[1:07:24] but the Devils
[1:07:28] rejecting the truth and then they go for
[1:07:32] this
[1:07:33] they are not happy with what God has
[1:07:35] made them okay buddy
[1:07:38] Elizabeth that's your answer
[1:07:40] that's why they do tattoos
[1:07:43] because they are deluded
[1:07:47] Satan to want what they are not
[1:07:51] and you find out everywhere
[1:07:54] you are in charge like here
[1:07:57] you may not have tattoos foreign
[1:08:58] hmm
[1:09:07] and then the devil will give you all up
[1:09:09] standing now
[1:09:11] but if you take God this way
[1:09:14] there's something that the father has
[1:09:16] not planted in you
[1:09:18] come he will approach it out I bet you
[1:09:21] could jump if it's a sickness that is
[1:09:24] making you tiny God and God Alone
[1:09:29] even the sickness making you fat
[1:09:34] and then you go and see yourself
[1:09:37] this is so black yeah
[1:10:00] I will not get tired
[1:10:11] who told you that the white are the one
[1:10:14] who are beautiful
[1:10:16] actually a good man will look for
[1:10:18] character
[1:10:20] not skin color
[1:10:24] amen Brothers
[1:10:28] a a good man will look for character not
[1:10:31] skin color or massage
[1:10:39] Pastor when you're preaching to us you
[1:10:43] are telling us that we should not look
[1:10:44] for beauty
[1:10:49] [Laughter]
[1:10:52] lies in the hands of the beholders
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] sister
[1:11:02] and when they come for you
[1:11:06] when the white ones
[1:11:13] because you want to be the one their
[1:11:15] soul was longing
[1:11:16] [Applause]
[1:11:19] forever
[1:11:20] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[1:11:23] Lord give me the next slide
[1:11:26] next slide have you seen that what's the
[1:11:31] difference
[1:11:32] is the similarities
[1:11:35] you find a woman
[1:11:39] trying to mimic an ego
[1:11:42] you find them with all those longer
[1:11:44] nails
[1:11:47] like what you see there
[1:11:49] see God gave an eagle
[1:11:53] such Nails
[1:11:55] in order for it to get its place
[1:11:59] you don't need actually sister with
[1:12:02] those kind of nails you can't even eat
[1:12:06] if you eat you can easily become sick
[1:12:10] I wonder how they even keep hygiene with
[1:12:12] us
[1:12:18] and the devil is destroying a generation
[1:12:28] I say we as Believers of this world
[1:12:31] let us stay above the spirits
[1:12:35] live Above This is
[1:12:40] for we cannot be overtaken by them
[1:12:43] praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:47] living a life
[1:12:49] you can now decide what gender they want
[1:12:52] to be
[1:12:53] somebody
[1:12:56] it comes from what we have been saying
[1:12:59] how can a good understanding man or
[1:13:03] massage
[1:13:34] and you find them
[1:13:37] because I'm reaching my climax when we
[1:13:40] get done with this
[1:13:44] getting posters
[1:13:47] foreign
[1:14:23] are beginning to persecute those who say
[1:14:26] anything against them
[1:14:32] when I was in South Africa I told the
[1:14:35] people you see because in South Africa
[1:14:37] they're like almost in the US
[1:14:44] but in Uganda we think yeah we are still
[1:14:46] okay
[1:14:47] but let me tell you we are not okay
[1:14:57] to believe in life
[1:15:11] they themselves will control the world
[1:15:16] because this is their Heritage
[1:15:21] before the bread comes down they're
[1:15:24] going to take the take over the whole
[1:15:26] world um
[1:15:30] they are the ones with the money sister
[1:16:18] foreign
[1:16:26] think about it
[1:16:28] now you are saying that is so bad
[1:16:31] and the first things I was showing you
[1:16:33] were saying that's okay
[1:16:39] hey you are joking the devil is at it he
[1:16:44] has been at it from the beginning
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:50] to pervert their minds
[1:16:54] even in school
[1:16:57] children their mind will become
[1:17:00] perverted
[1:17:02] in our society
[1:17:11] that's why you told women to wear
[1:17:13] trousers
[1:17:16] so that they can think their men
[1:17:18] you thought him in the beginning it was
[1:17:20] a style because
[1:17:22] now you know better because there is a
[1:17:25] wrong speed behind it
[1:17:28] they started by saying women have rights
[1:17:33] and then finally they said
[1:17:39] is the spirit of delusion
[1:17:42] and it's the Looting the whole
[1:17:44] generation
[1:17:45] listen to me no one will survive
[1:17:51] the mark of Christ
[1:18:07] the spirit of delusion
[1:18:10] mankind you can now decide whether they
[1:18:12] are a cow a monkey a donkey a lizard or
[1:18:14] something
[1:18:17] um
[1:18:21] someone saying for me I've discovered
[1:18:24] that since I was born
[1:18:26] I'm feeling uh like a monkey
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:31] I feel pretty from beginning with today
[1:18:35] I am registering in the government
[1:18:38] as a man
[1:18:42] no
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:59] you think I'm joking it is already
[1:19:01] in the world
[1:19:04] is a strong religion is
[1:19:14] imagine terrorism
[1:19:16] I'm going to nail this properly
[1:19:23] Generations
[1:19:31] as long as they have consented
[1:19:35] so whether we are married or not we can
[1:19:39] do whatever we like because
[1:19:48] the spirit of the illusion
[1:19:51] you have no rights
[1:19:54] kissing a man a woman who is not your
[1:19:56] husband or wife
[1:20:00] you have no rights sleeping with someone
[1:20:04] else's wife
[1:20:05] because whoever is not yet married
[1:20:09] for a husband
[1:20:16] someone else is there
[1:20:18] and if you are the one don't marry them
[1:20:22] the Bible says to you young men and
[1:20:25] women
[1:20:26] if you born
[1:20:31] what's up
[1:20:34] that is the Bible solution
[1:20:39] that's why Rwanda married
[1:20:44] foreign
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:05] no brother this is the word
[1:21:09] so you find a pasta
[1:21:16] that's why you hear the stories
[1:21:20] that's why here days of the voice
[1:21:30] sisters alone
[1:21:39] you have no business
[1:21:42] we believe in Holiness
[1:21:49] it is
[1:21:53] a beautiful thing tomorrow
[1:21:56] you
[1:22:03] will build our society
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:14] think about marriage
[1:22:23] who are very serious they said on these
[1:22:27] things
[1:22:27] when a young man comes past them brother
[1:22:31] you have a spirit of life
[1:22:36] I don't believe that I don't believe
[1:22:39] that but Pastor you're not married you
[1:22:42] also have a spirit of life
[1:22:45] I believe that we should take the word
[1:22:48] the way it is
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:23:00] I don't believe
[1:23:02] that kind of thing too mature adults can
[1:23:04] decide to do anything
[1:23:12] tell somebody that's alive
[1:23:17] you see they say anybody can believe
[1:23:19] whatever they like
[1:23:21] as long as they believe it they are
[1:23:24] right no that's a lie baptism baptizing
[1:23:28] babies he's alive
[1:23:30] no matter how many people do it
[1:23:32] baptizing babies I say this is
[1:23:44] only one baptism of water
[1:23:48] um
[1:23:55] that the Bible says any other thing is a
[1:23:59] lie of the devil
[1:24:00] Guru
[1:24:36] all right I have two more slides now
[1:24:37] okay of two scriptures
[1:24:40] Romans 1 21.
[1:24:43] because that when they knew God
[1:24:46] they glorified him not as God neither we
[1:24:48] are thankful but became vain in their
[1:24:50] own imaginations
[1:24:52] and their foolish Hearts heart was
[1:24:54] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:24:56] wise they became fools
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:22] the professor they profess to be wise
[1:25:25] and the Bible says they became fools
[1:25:28] brother
[1:25:31] foreign
[1:25:50] and they begin you know you know it's
[1:25:53] all right to have those nails
[1:26:00] they profess to be wise
[1:26:02] but they became full Neighbors
[1:26:08] you see why am I preaching this
[1:26:10] because we
[1:26:13] have a responsibility
[1:26:15] to tell you these things
[1:26:20] it's a it's a responsibility given to us
[1:26:22] by God
[1:26:25] the spirit of delusion
[1:26:28] over an entire generation
[1:26:37] and and people are becoming fools
[1:26:43] and it says their foolish Hearts were
[1:26:45] stuck imaginations
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:27:01] here is what it is Lord we have sinned
[1:27:04] all night and taken nothing nevertheless
[1:27:07] at Thy word
[1:27:17] there you are taking God at his word
[1:27:22] and I'm saying take God at his word
[1:27:25] church
[1:27:28] it is taking God at his word
[1:27:34] not what you taste
[1:27:37] what this says that all that says
[1:27:40] I'm taking God at his words
[1:27:50] I don't know how they're going to be
[1:27:51] there
[1:27:52] but if there wasn't any there and Peter
[1:27:55] let down the net with faith believing
[1:27:57] that God would fulfill his word faith
[1:27:59] would put some there singer
[1:28:02] yeah
[1:28:10] I want to finish with this church
[1:28:13] Hallelujah man we are believers
[1:28:16] we are like Peter during a pet I said we
[1:28:19] are believers tell somebody
[1:28:23] Hallelujah
[1:28:26] if we believe I tell your neighbor I'm a
[1:28:28] Believer
[1:28:30] don't worry anymore
[1:28:40] Peter had what Jesus said
[1:28:45] he said we have been casting
[1:28:48] we've not found any fish
[1:28:51] but he said
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:56] I believe it is
[1:30:15] I am fearful commander and wonderfully
[1:30:18] made not only one and Ken peace
[1:30:37] I'm challenging some of you now I don't
[1:30:39] know how many will catch it
[1:30:41] how many will believe it how many will
[1:30:45] accept it do you know you can start your
[1:30:47] company
[1:30:50] million dollar company a company
[1:30:53] and you know if there is no job it's for
[1:30:57] you God can make you create some jobs
[1:30:59] even for others
[1:31:06] did you know God our God the God of this
[1:31:09] message
[1:31:14] he specializes
[1:31:21] he is not looking for possibilities
[1:31:52] [Applause]

[1:32:19] said in beginning
[1:32:21] if you stick in the naturals
[1:32:27] is going to be natural enough
[1:32:33] because the God of this message
[1:32:38] what he has done for others he can do
[1:32:41] for you what is impossible
[1:32:46] that man cannot do it
[1:32:49] that's why we are believers

[1:33:28] believe with me right now I want you to
[1:33:31] believe with me right now God is able to
[1:33:34] take it
[1:33:36] because you believe the truth
[1:33:39] he will not bring the spirit of delusion
[1:33:41] to you
