[6:09] Listen. How many appreciate brother?
[6:17] Let us give him an applause. Praise God.
[6:20] Let us have a seat for him.
[6:25] I'd like to greet you all in the name of
[6:26] our Lord Jesus Christ. Uh God has really
[6:30] given us a wonderful time and I think
[6:33] this can continue up to morning
[6:36] &gt;&gt; but uh many of you are going to be
[6:38] traveling and so you need to to to have
[6:42] some rest. The preachers that preached
[6:45] are sleeping here and they're tired so
[6:47] we cannot be here up to morning. But I'm
[6:50] not the bring of bad news. I'm the bring
[6:52] of good news. We're going to go for a
[6:55] few hours perhaps maybe one and a half
[6:57] or something like that and unfortunately
[7:00] you know we cannot be here the whole
[7:01] night
[7:03] but at least maximum two hours and then
[7:05] we go rest. Uh but what we are going is
[7:09] we are going to hear testimonies people
[7:11] who have testimonies and then there are
[7:13] some who had special songs uh they gave
[7:17] it in but it was not called. I know they
[7:20] are here. I don't know. Do you have some
[7:21] of those papers? Ah, okay. So, we're
[7:24] going to give them the the opportunity
[7:25] to hear the songs, but we are going to
[7:28] prioritize testimonies. There's already
[7:30] someone here. Actually, before I even
[7:32] sit down, I'll invite them. Sister
[7:34] Comfort, who says she has a testimony. I
[7:37] don't know whether she's from Uganda or
[7:38] Kenya, but if you're here, just come and
[7:40] give your testimony right now. So I'm
[7:42] going to hand over the program or the
[7:43] service to brother Brian who will run it
[7:46] and just invite you for the special
[7:47] songs and then uh the testimonies as
[7:50] well. We are record we are streaming
[7:52] this service. It is live. So you can
[7:54] always go back and watch this. Uh but I
[7:57] think the stream just started. Uh is the
[7:59] stream on brother Isaac? Yeah. So it
[8:01] just started a few moments ago. So uh
[8:05] there are many things you can see if you
[8:08] have not been at the at the camp from
[8:11] the beginning. There are many things
[8:13] that uh those who think a streaming
[8:15] would really miss
[8:18] because uh the first day on Friday many
[8:21] meetings were not streamed or we had
[8:23] streaming difficulty here and then of
[8:25] course when we came here I mean we've
[8:26] had almost one hour here of rejoicing
[8:29] and those people streaming of course
[8:30] missed all that and and so uh on the
[8:34] next camp. Don't plan to stream, plan to
[8:36] be here.
[8:38] How many appreciate God for what he has
[8:40] done for us. Amen. Ah, it's been a a
[8:44] real wonderful time. And everybody's
[8:46] happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. God is
[8:49] happy.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; I mean, because of what he has
[8:51] accomplished in our lives and never be
[8:54] the same again after this camp. So,
[8:57] before I invite brother Brian, I'm going
[9:00] to invite Sister Comfort if she's here.
[9:04] I'm hungry for testimonies. Wonderful
[9:06] testimonies. I want to hear. By the way,
[9:08] when you come here to give a testimony,
[9:10] you're not giving testimony of what God
[9:12] did for you in your village. You're
[9:14] giving testimony of what has happened.
[9:16] We want hot testimonies. What God has
[9:18] done for you in this camp. Understood?
[9:22] So if you you're writing that you have a
[9:23] testimony, we want a a live testimony. A
[9:27] live testimony. Is it a live testimony,
[9:28] Sister Conf? All right. God bless you.
[9:32] God bless you.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; Sorry, just a moment. Sister Abigail,
[9:41] where are you?
[9:43] Is she here?
[9:47] She left.
[9:53] God bless you.
[9:56] I thank God for providing for me in
[9:59] order to come for this youth camp cuz it
[10:03] wasn't easy.
[10:05] And uh I've attended so far, this is the
[10:08] third one. The first two, okay, I was
[10:10] blessed but there is something different
[10:13] about this one that I can't tell cuz the
[10:17] first two youth camps I attended, I went
[10:20] back the same person. But at least now I
[10:23] feel different.
[10:26] Um, I thank him for everything he has
[10:29] done for me. Last year was really hard
[10:32] and I came here with the baggage from
[10:35] last year, but I feel I'm now free and I
[10:39] feel like a new person and I'm grateful
[10:43] for all the things God has done for me.
[10:56] Okay.
[11:00] Um, last year was really bad for me. Uh,
[11:02] I lost three people,
[11:05] two uncles and a friend. One of my
[11:07] uncles, most of you know him, the late
[11:09] pastor Dipio. Then, uh, I also quit my
[11:12] job, went back home and started staying
[11:15] home. And, uh, things were not really
[11:18] easy. So, I've been drained mentally,
[11:22] but I thank God for this conversation. I
[11:25] was at the verge of giving up on coming
[11:27] here due to financial issues, but I
[11:29] thank him for giving me the grace to
[11:31] come. God bless you.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; If there something that I would say,
[11:39] this mic keeps breaking up, so I don't
[11:42] if you can get it sorted.
[11:44] uh if there is something I don't know
[11:46] how many here are from here not from out
[11:48] of the country raise up your hands
[11:52] please I want because I want to see if
[11:53] it is relevant okay so then there are
[11:57] also those of course who are streaming
[11:59] uh and maybe have been a part of the
[12:01] camp or maybe they're in the adomeries
[12:03] and so I want to just communicate this
[12:07] two things number one I've been asked by
[12:09] many why we don't do Q&A
[12:12] I know young People love questions and
[12:14] answers sessions. Uh but we do not do
[12:19] Q&A in this uh DVF youth camp because I
[12:24] feel it's not the burden a burden that
[12:27] God has given to us to do to run. I mean
[12:30] there are many youth camps they do that
[12:31] and in your local churches also that is
[12:34] done. Uh I've often found that um for
[12:38] example if you now ask a question
[12:42] and the reason why I'm explaining this
[12:44] is because we have received a lot of
[12:46] feedback some young people who wanted
[12:48] this to be done and so if it's not done
[12:51] then they're going to be disappointed
[12:53] and if they are disappointed
[12:56] uh we want them to know why why we are
[12:59] not doing it. So um
[13:02] if you you come here with a question and
[13:05] maybe it's a question from not even
[13:08] necessarily what the preachers have
[13:09] preached on then you will receive an
[13:12] answer but my answer or the answer of
[13:15] whichever pastor will be giving you an
[13:17] answer might not be exactly what your
[13:19] your pastor back at home would answer on
[13:21] such a such a matter and then it is
[13:24] going to cause trouble. is going to
[13:25] cause issues with your pastor and that's
[13:28] not the intention or the purpose of this
[13:30] camp. The purpose of this camp is not to
[13:32] indoctrinate you. The purpose of this
[13:34] camp is to encourage you on your walk
[13:37] with the Lord and you know get you
[13:39] established in the present truth and get
[13:41] you on fire for God. That's it. The the
[13:43] rest is not really our concern. And and
[13:46] so if you have any questions uh out of
[13:48] this camp or then you go and ask your
[13:52] pastor. And if you feel that you really
[13:54] have to ask then you can always write us
[13:56] or call us then we can always see if we
[13:58] need to really u but I think anything
[14:01] doctrinal I would really advise that you
[14:03] always take it to your pastor that's
[14:04] that's the best way that we can advise
[14:07] um I think that have I explained it
[14:09] well. Yeah. So we we we not do we don't
[14:13] do these camps to cause controversy.
[14:15] It's not our purpose. It's not our
[14:17] intention. The purpose is to be to edify
[14:19] the body. To edify the body. Then the
[14:22] other thing is um and you have to excuse
[14:24] me. I'm trying to remember because I'm
[14:25] tired. When I'm tired, things begin to
[14:27] to leave my mind. Uh the other thing
[14:30] that I wanted to talk about Yes. is the
[14:33] registration. Now many times now this is
[14:36] for the Kenyan group. You have really
[14:37] done well. Actually, let us all clap for
[14:39] the Kenyan group. The Ugandans clap for
[14:41] the Kenyan group. Yeah. And uh because
[14:44] uh they have uh Where's Brother Ken? Is
[14:47] he here?
[14:50] Yeah. Brother Ken over there. God bless
[14:53] you so much, Brother Ken and Brother
[14:54] Isaac and the rest of the leadership.
[14:57] this they have really been very very
[15:00] good in mobilizing and and you know
[15:02] telling you what to do and I I know as
[15:05] much as we also organize here but it is
[15:07] not easy to I mean put 48 not all young
[15:10] people I know there even the older ones
[15:12] but 48 people on a bus and by the way we
[15:15] were even worried this time because it's
[15:17] election period and you remember
[15:20] recently there was issues between Kenya
[15:22] and Uganda I don't know yeah so we were
[15:25] really worried what what will happen But
[15:27] if you stopped on the border and so but
[15:30] I didn't want to make it an issue so I
[15:31] didn't talk about it but we were praying
[15:33] and we talked about it to brother Ken
[15:34] and we were praying and and so we wrote
[15:36] a letter in just in case did you get any
[15:38] issues at the border brother Ken? No
[15:40] nothing. So really God is in this. God
[15:43] has been in this and we appreciate God
[15:45] for that. And so the Kenyan group has
[15:47] really done their part. I mean they pay
[15:49] their camp fee and you know they they
[15:51] they don't really give us trouble but
[15:54] the ones that give us trouble are the
[15:55] Ugandans.
[15:58] Uh and I I wanted to say this here
[16:01] because I have the time to do it and
[16:03] also it is streaming so the others who
[16:05] are not in the church can also hear or
[16:07] we are there and have left they can also
[16:09] hear now or later. The the reason please
[16:12] allow me to explain this and then I'll
[16:13] just leave the service to you to enjoy.
[16:16] The reason because I need to go and rest
[16:19] a bit. Pastor Maher is leaving very
[16:21] early in the morning at 6:00 and we need
[16:23] to uh drop him at the airport. The
[16:25] reason why we we pay fee. Now to some of
[16:29] you it is obvious but to others it is
[16:31] not. Trust me there are people here who
[16:34] don't know why we pay fee. They actually
[16:36] even think we are making money from
[16:37] them. That is what some of them think
[16:41] and they find it very hard. Why? These
[16:43] are just gospel meetings. Why are you
[16:45] asking for money? The gospel is for
[16:47] free. I mean preaching is for free. They
[16:49] they can't understand it. So allow me to
[16:52] explain it to them so they can
[16:53] understand why we always require h fee.
[16:57] Um
[16:58] we pay what we what we always um ask
[17:02] people to pay is just 50,000 shillings.
[17:04] That's not the cost for you to be here
[17:06] for three days the way we do.
[17:10] It doesn't cost us 50,000. It costs us
[17:13] an average of 80 to 90,000 shillings.
[17:17] Many of you did not know that. That's
[17:19] that's the cost. Of course, you you're
[17:21] going to begin some of you will just
[17:22] look at the food at the plate, the food
[17:24] you eat. But it's not only the food,
[17:26] okay? But because you look at the place
[17:29] where you are sleeping, it's not only
[17:30] that. It's the food. It's the place
[17:32] where you are sleeping. It's the venue
[17:34] which we are, you know, renting and and
[17:36] and and you know, we we also pay for it.
[17:39] It is the, you know, the ministers we
[17:41] have. We need to take care of them. We
[17:43] need to, you know, feed them also. We
[17:45] need to transport them. We need to pay
[17:47] for their accommodations. I mean, you
[17:49] can say, well, it's none of my business,
[17:50] but they are coming to minister to you.
[17:52] So, it's part of camp. And you know, you
[17:54] you're looking at all these other things
[17:56] that goes in the media, that goes in the
[17:57] music, that goes in this. So, all those
[18:00] are expenses of the camp. So, all that
[18:02] put together an average of uh say if we
[18:04] have 500 young people, then you look at
[18:06] um an average of about 80 to 90,000
[18:08] shillings per person. So if you round
[18:10] that up, how much is it for 500 people?
[18:13] How much would you need to take care of
[18:14] them?
[18:16] A good mathematician here.
[18:20] 500 people times 90,000 shillings. How
[18:23] much is that? Huh?
[18:30] Is that a good mathematics?
[18:33] About 45. Actually, we have always spent
[18:35] about 50 millions. So I don't know how
[18:38] the other come in but that's how much
[18:40] which means the average is a little bit
[18:41] more we always spend that much now on
[18:46] top of that now many young people will
[18:48] come and say I don't have money and
[18:51] maybe it is true they don't have money
[18:52] but maybe they also did not bother to
[18:54] find money because they thought that ah
[18:57] this is just a youth camp I'll just be
[18:59] allowed in and others just want to sneak
[19:00] in and you know people have their own
[19:03] way about things but uh let's look that
[19:07] and now we're going to have another camp
[19:09] this coming January. Let's say if if you
[19:11] were saving uh just how much would you
[19:14] need to save to just 50,000 is a
[19:16] contribution. It doesn't even take care
[19:19] of you but it only contributes because
[19:22] since you are not the host we don't want
[19:23] to put the whole weight on you to say
[19:26] pay for it. You never plan for it. So
[19:28] well we plan for it we want to pay the
[19:30] bigger share of it but we are asking you
[19:32] to contribute only 50,000 shillings. So
[19:35] if you don't contribute that then you're
[19:36] putting the weight on us. Every after
[19:39] the end of camp
[19:42] um uh last year I was left with a
[19:44] deficit of about 30 million shillings
[19:46] which we took out of our land fund and
[19:47] we had to pay and we had to look for it
[19:49] afterwards because we needed to clear
[19:51] the other part and then this year I have
[19:54] a deficit that I know of. I don't know
[19:56] the rest of the I don't know the rest of
[19:58] the details. not received from the
[19:59] treasur's department but I have a
[20:01] deficit of about 10 million or so which
[20:04] needs to be paid you know so but that
[20:06] you can't explain to everyone so the
[20:08] only thing I'm asking you to do is do
[20:11] your part let's if everyone can do their
[20:14] part then we will always have a very
[20:16] successful meeting but if you come
[20:19] everybody's happy and then you leave the
[20:21] host wondering where am I going to get
[20:23] this money to sort these things you see
[20:26] God will provide
[20:28] Why didn't he provide to you to bring
[20:30] your contribution? You understand? So
[20:32] let everyone do our part and let
[20:34] everybody be happy and let god also
[20:37] bless each of every one of us. So I
[20:40] think I just took the trouble to explain
[20:41] that. I don't expect to explain it
[20:43] again. Then lastly regarding the
[20:45] registration, we need to always know
[20:48] before you come. Registration helps us
[20:51] to know before you come for us to have
[20:52] an expectation of how much resources we
[20:55] need to take care of you. Now that you
[20:57] know that we always even need much more
[20:59] than what you give us. So we need to
[21:00] know how many are coming so we can take
[21:02] care of you. So we we at least need you
[21:04] to register
[21:07] uh two months before two months before
[21:09] really so we can be able to know that
[21:11] you are coming even if you're not too
[21:13] sure but you think you might come
[21:15] register. So always whenever we open
[21:17] registration let's try to do that. The
[21:19] reason why I'm explaining to you is
[21:21] because you are not very old. You know,
[21:23] you are young, which means you can
[21:25] adjust. Adjust your thinking. Adjust
[21:27] your mindset and let everybody be happy.
[21:30] Am I communicating? God bless you. I
[21:33] think let me just leave the microphone
[21:34] before you get bored of me. Otherwise, I
[21:37] love you very much. I appreciate you.
[21:39] Thank you so much for coming this year.
[21:41] We we really enjoyed being with you.
[21:44] When you go back, send our regards to
[21:46] your church. And uh now I hand it over
[21:49] to brother Brian.
[22:13] Okay. God bless you. uh that there there
[22:16] is a key that got lost and they first
[22:19] found it but again it got lost again. So
[22:22] if you have it
[22:27] there's a key okay there's a key which
[22:30] got lost at first
[22:33] then they found it later on it
[22:35] disappeared again so if you have it
[22:38] please you can see brother Ranga
[22:41] or any deon
[22:44] that must have legs
[22:47] it keeps appearing and disappearing
[22:51] Now I wanted brother Asagget to invite
[22:53] you to Ethiopia.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not ready.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; Invite them to come to Ethiopia. You
[22:59] don't want
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are almost all of you are
[23:02] invited to Ethiopia.
[23:05] We will sponsor every one of you by
[23:07] face. God will provide through you. So
[23:11] you will come, you will enjoy ina is our
[23:15] best traditional food just like what you
[23:18] call it here.
[23:21] Not m okay in is more like chapati.
[23:24] Yeah. But in is more
[23:27] nice.
[23:29] I really appreciate the Ugandians food
[23:33] and the way you accept the visitors and
[23:37] the way you worship. Yeah. Please clap
[23:40] your hands for yourself.
[23:45] So, so uh since I have got this mic on
[23:48] my hand, I don't think I will hand it
[23:51] over to anyone.
[23:55] But I would love also to appreciate my
[23:57] pastor, pastor Busobosi. He is my
[24:01] pastor. He is my father. I am really
[24:03] proud of him. You don't know what kinds
[24:05] of anointing is upon him. So please use
[24:08] him before he get old.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:14] &gt;&gt; Use him. Hallelujah. So support him,
[24:17] support his vision. That's what I can
[24:18] say about Pastor Busoboi. He's an
[24:21] anointed uh man of God. Really that I
[24:25] can be proud of him. So you know back in
[24:28] Ethiopia almost more than I can say 80
[24:31] 85%
[24:33] all of the ministers and the other
[24:35] saints that have come to this message uh
[24:39] if you scratch their back uh you might
[24:42] find the hand uh uh what you call it
[24:47] uh stamp of pastor Tala.
[24:52] Yeah every one of us history with him.
[24:56] So I really appreciate him and uh this
[24:59] is what I want to say. Uh please don't
[25:02] forget your plan to come to Ethiopia.
[25:06] Don't you want to come to Ethiopia
[25:09] &gt;&gt; either on foot either on air either on
[25:12] bus you I can see that you have also a
[25:15] very nice experience in traveling by a
[25:18] big bus. So we will join you then.
[25:21] Hallelujah. Praise be the name of Jesus
[25:23] Christ. We are very lucky people. God
[25:25] bless you. Shalom.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; So, brother brother Asaged is also
[25:31] leaving
[25:32] &gt;&gt; on Tuesday uh morning uh whatever. So,
[25:36] just keep him in prayers. He has a great
[25:39] work ahead of him. He is only one of a
[25:43] very few ministers that are standing.
[25:46] Um he is having a church in uh one part
[25:50] of Adis Sababa. Um, brother Mogus is
[25:54] having another church in a little more
[25:56] central. Actually, brother Mogus's
[25:58] church was the one I was pastoring
[26:00] before I came uh back to Uganda with
[26:03] with my wife. We were there for about
[26:05] four or five years. And so, uh, brother
[26:08] Morg is also there in Addis and then
[26:10] brother Girma is also in Addis and
[26:12] brother Tesa is in Aasa. Brother Ephraim
[26:15] is in Aasa. These are one of the
[26:18] I think I might have forgotten a few but
[26:20] these are the first first believers
[26:22] there and now they are all pastors. So
[26:23] please remember them those names that I
[26:25] mentioned in prayer. All right now over
[26:28] to your program.
[26:35] Can we appreciate our pastor?
[26:38] Amen.
[26:40] So I think we're going to end the
[26:42] session of uh special songs. I kindly
[26:45] request you if you if your song is very
[26:48] long to give chance to your brother and
[26:50] your sister at least shorten it please
[26:53] in good heart. So this one says uh
[26:56] brother Victor Bamukama
[26:59] want to sing to sing a special song.
[27:02] Then uh the next person will be brother
[27:05] Joseph.
[27:07] So, brother,
[27:14] &gt;&gt; praise God. I greet you all in the name
[27:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[27:19] appreciate the Lord for this
[27:20] opportunity.
[27:23] The song says, I'm going to hold on
[27:26] Jesus.
[27:28] So, be blessed as you listen to it.
[27:34] I'm going to hold
[27:36] on.
[27:38] Hold on to Jesus.
[27:41] Hold to the lamp of Calvary.

[28:32] Nothing seems to make sense.
[28:35] Many looking for the way. Searching to
[28:39] and from.
[28:41] Sometimes this rope I'm holding
[28:45] seems to be sleeping. But I'm going to
[28:49] hold on tighter to the only hope I know.
[28:54] I'm going to hold
[28:56] on
[28:58] hold on to Jesus.

[29:07] I'm going to hold
[29:09] on.
[29:11] Hold on to Jesus and Jesus will hold on
[29:17] to me.
[29:20] Well, Satan keeps on talking,
[29:24] saying you can't make it,
[29:28] trying to convince me that there is no
[29:32] use to try. Oh, but I refuse to listen
[29:37] and keep right on going,
[29:41] trusting and believing in the Jesus. No
[29:45] time. I'm going to hold on.

[30:09] to me.

[30:46] convince me but there is no use to try
[30:51] but I refuse to listen and keep right on

[43:40] The storm they were facing was fearful.
[43:45] The ship seemed so small in the waves
[43:49] and the wind just kept growing harder.
[43:54] And yet there was still so safe
[43:59] from out of the dark. He came walking.
[44:03] He had never lost them from view.
[44:08] He can see through the darkest of
[44:11] troubles.
[44:12] He just wanted them to see too
[44:19] that you never be filled till you're
[44:22] empty.
[44:23] Until you're broken, you never behold
[44:28] until the border has dried your vessel
[44:31] with fire. You never come forth as gold.
[44:37] I didn't know how much he loved me until
[44:42] I pass through the storm and looked.
[44:46] I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[44:49] needed. Until he was all that I heard
[44:54] that you never be fil
[44:59] until you're broken, you never behold.
[45:03] until the potter has dried your vessel
[45:07] with fire. You'll never come forth as
[45:10] you go.
[45:13] I didn't know how much he loved me until
[45:17] I pass through the storm and looked
[45:20] back.
[45:22] I didn't know Jesus was all that I need.
[45:26] Until he was all that I heard.
[45:33] Sometimes the storm that you're facing
[45:37] may seem like your whole world has
[45:40] changed
[45:41] and the fire just keeps getting hotter
[45:46] as the potter is shaping the clay.
[45:50] For Jesus, he knows what he's doing.
[45:55] Even though it causes you pain, he just
[46:00] want us to know that lay on his
[46:02] shoulder. His disciples is still the
[46:06] same.
[46:10] That you'll never be filthy. You're
[46:12] empty.
[46:14] Until you're broken, you never be home.
[46:18] Until the pter has tried your vessel
[46:22] with fire and never come forth.
[46:28] I didn't know how much she loved me
[46:32] until I passed through the storm and l
[46:37] I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[46:40] needed. Until he was all that I heard.
[46:45] I didn't know how much he loved me until
[46:50] I passed through the storm and looked
[46:52] by.
[46:54] I didn't know Jesus was all that I need
[46:59] until he was all that I heard.

[1:05:36] God bless you saints.
[1:05:39] Before we sing, I want to give my
[1:05:41] testimony.
[1:05:43] I want to thank God
[1:05:46] because I got a revelation of his word.
[1:05:49] Genesis 1 verse 27 that says so. manage
[1:05:55] in the image of God. God created he male
[1:05:59] and female created.
[1:06:01] I was so glad when say that the pigs
[1:06:06] produce pigs. The gods produce God's
[1:06:10] soap. God created me. So that means I'm
[1:06:13] God.
[1:06:15] I was so glad for that scripture and
[1:06:18] very many other scriptures that revealed
[1:06:20] to me because before coming to the
[1:06:23] conversion God led me to read Genesis
[1:06:26] and Revelation then and Exodus and
[1:06:30] Nehemiah. So I thank the Lord that what
[1:06:32] I've been reading is what they have been
[1:06:35] also reading. I really thank the Lord.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And we are going to praise him. And so
[1:06:45] we thank him for this new year because
[1:06:47] it has been a blessing. We have started
[1:06:50] it with blessings.

[1:26:04] world that I am the message.

[1:26:10] song. If you know it, you can sing with
[1:26:13] me.

[1:31:59] Let us welcome sister Irene Nasali
[1:32:03] and then
[1:32:05] sister Dorin from Kenya. Get prepared.
[1:32:11] We trying to wind up.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God saints. I'm going to give a
[1:32:17] very short testimony then I sing the
[1:32:20] special song. Earlier this week I got so
[1:32:23] so so sick and I was rushed to the
[1:32:26] hospital at night and um by God's grace
[1:32:31] I'm fine. But as a result of the
[1:32:33] sickness and all that I got some severe
[1:32:36] chest pain. By the time I came here, I
[1:32:39] was super super dying. But no one could
[1:32:41] tell. Meanwhile, I thank God for that.
[1:32:43] That even when I'm sick, you barely
[1:32:45] tell. But after
[1:32:49] praying and all that, the very first day
[1:32:51] I came, the pain disappeared. I could
[1:32:54] barely catch my breath. I could not even
[1:32:57] sing because of that pain. But I thank
[1:33:00] God that I'm free. I'm healed and I can
[1:33:03] now sing.
[1:33:06] And uh the special song we are going to
[1:33:09] sing it together. Uh I hope we all know
[1:33:13] about aunt Jamaima as the prophet talks
[1:33:16] about the testimony. I've been burdened
[1:33:19] to sing this song and I pray it blesses
[1:33:22] your hearts.

[1:39:36] more. I want to sing for you a song that
[1:39:40] is always my favorite song because I
[1:39:43] believe it's an anthem for me. The love
[1:39:45] of God.
[1:39:51] The love of God
[1:39:55] is greater
[1:40:00] than tongue or pain.
[1:40:05] I never tell.
[1:40:10] It goes beyond
[1:40:14] the highest time
[1:40:19] and reaches to
[1:40:23] the lowest hand.
[1:40:28] The guilty pair
[1:40:32] bowed down with care.
[1:40:37] God gave his son
[1:40:42] to
[1:40:46] his child.
[1:40:51] He reconciled
[1:40:55] and pardon
[1:41:00] his sins. Oh love of God, oh love of
