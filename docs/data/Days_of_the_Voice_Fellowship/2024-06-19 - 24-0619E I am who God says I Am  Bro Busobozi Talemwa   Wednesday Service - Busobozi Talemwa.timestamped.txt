[39:33] your in Jesus
[39:35] name
[39:37] amen so I'm speaking to you church
[39:39] tonight on I am who God says I
[39:47] am amen would you like to turn to your
[39:50] neighbor and tell them I God says I
[39:56] am and I'm going to tell you in our
[40:00] generation we have a lot of Christians
[40:03] that are living very defeated
[40:07] [Music]
[40:08] lives now when I said defeated
[40:11] life I mean many
[40:14] things it could be a defeated
[40:16] life because someone is constantly
[40:19] living in
[40:21] sickness it could be a defeated life
[40:25] because someone is repeatedly confessing
[40:27] uh the bad things that they are going
[40:29] through and their
[40:33] failures it could be a defeated
[40:35] life because someone cannot be able to
[40:38] pay
[40:40] bills maybe find food to
[40:43] eat it could also be a defeated
[40:46] life because they are living in sin and
[40:50] having some Spirits upon them that they
[40:52] find uneasy to break out
[40:59] and then they
[41:01] accept the definition of the devil upon
[41:04] their life upon their family upon their
[41:11] community so you often find people
[41:13] saying my
[41:16] sickness that person is already
[41:18] defeated my
[41:20] sickness
[41:22] Myers my pain my heartbreak
[41:28] my
[41:29] HIV my
[41:31] cancer they have
[41:34] accepted that it is theirs they have
[41:37] owned it they have come to
[41:40] terms with what the devil said they
[41:44] are and so they are living a defeated
[41:48] life and also you find others who may
[41:51] not actually be sick in their
[41:54] body but they they learn to say things
[41:57] that they're going through and they own
[41:59] [Music]
[42:01] them and they say my
[42:04] poverty you know my
[42:08] heartbreak my sin and you know you you
[42:12] you you learn somehow the devil tunes
[42:15] and changes your
[42:18] mind to accept a bad situation upon your
[42:23] life and when you accept it in your mind
[42:27] then you you confess it with your
[42:30] mouth and remember there is power in
[42:33] confession the Bible tells us that Jesus
[42:36] Christ is the high priest of our
[42:40] confession whatever we
[42:42] confess he is there to make it come to
[42:46] pass so the more you confess
[42:49] poverty the more you will leave in
[42:51] poverty the more you confess defeat in
[42:54] an area in your life
[42:57] the more it will actually Prevail in
[43:00] your
[43:01] life and then after confessing it you
[43:04] will go and
[43:06] pray I Reb this situation I B it I break
[43:10] it I
[43:12] conf and then afterwards you come back
[43:15] my
[43:17] PO nothing is going to
[43:19] happen my
[43:23] joblessness everything is going to
[43:25] remain constant
[43:28] my
[43:29] last because you see you have confessed
[43:32] it and God is
[43:35] faithful to fulfill your
[43:39] confession that is why as
[43:41] Believers no matter what the devil
[43:44] claims we
[43:46] are no matter what life tells us that we
[43:51] are no matter what our neighbors tell us
[43:54] that we
[43:57] no matter what our own bodies tell us
[44:00] we if it disagrees with what God says we
[44:06] are we must never agree with
[44:08] it we must never confess it we will we
[44:12] should always disagree with
[44:15] it you understand what I'm saying
[44:18] because if you accept a bad thing about
[44:22] you so shall it
[44:24] be so tonight I want to speak to you
[44:29] about who I
[44:31] am about who you are and and I just
[44:34] phrase it I am who God says I
[44:38] am I am who God says I
[44:41] am and what does God say about
[44:44] you God says this about
[44:47] you you are a chosen
[44:50] generation if you believe it repeat it
[44:52] after
[44:53] me repeat it in the first first person
[44:58] pronoun I am a chosen
[45:01] generation okay now I want you to you've
[45:03] confessed a lot of negative
[45:05] things so we are here in the house of
[45:08] God to undo everything you have
[45:11] confessed about yourself that is
[45:14] negative this is the beginning of
[45:17] becoming what God has purposed for you
[45:19] to
[45:21] be that's why many times I tell you to
[45:23] confess things and say it on your lips
[45:27] because when you prophesy it when you
[45:30] speak it you know it will surely happen
[45:34] because you know you've placed it on
[45:35] your lips and is the high priest of our
[45:39] confession well if you believe what I
[45:41] believe you can say what I'm
[45:43] saying I am a chosen
[45:45] generation I am a royal
[45:48] priesthood I am a holy
[45:50] nation I'm A peculiar
[45:53] person hallelujah amen this is what God
[45:56] says I am
[45:58] God actually does not see us as
[46:01] commoners God sees us as a chosen
[46:06] generation there is always a generation
[46:08] that is
[46:10] chosen maybe you may be five children in
[46:12] your
[46:14] home but you are the chosen one maybe
[46:18] you are 10 in your clan but you are the
[46:22] Chosen and maybe if you're doubting that
[46:24] you are
[46:25] chosen let me bring it this way there
[46:28] are many people who have heard this
[46:31] message but very few have believed it
[46:34] many people have uh you know believed on
[46:37] Jesus
[46:38] Christ and they are members of
[46:41] denominations but when they hear this
[46:43] message they turn it
[46:46] down they are
[46:48] called but they're not chosen the Bible
[46:51] says many are
[46:52] called but few are
[46:54] chosen only the chosen ones going in the
[46:59] Rapture are you hearing me now amen the
[47:04] Rapture is not for all the
[47:08] Christians the Rapture is not for all
[47:10] the so-called Bible
[47:15] Believers I said so called because they
[47:17] claim to believe the
[47:19] Bible but they don't actually fulfill
[47:21] everything that is written in the
[47:24] Bible they don't they don't have the
[47:26] capacity believe the
[47:29] word and because of that they are not
[47:33] chosen and they were not
[47:36] predestinated unto
[47:40] adoption but
[47:42] we I don't know everyone so I would say
[47:45] but but I have been
[47:48] predestinated I was in the mind of God
[47:50] before I was
[47:52] born before I was in my mother's
[47:55] womb before I came into this
[47:57] world God knew me God separated me God
[48:03] God ordained
[48:04] me and God anointed me amen and he made
[48:08] me amen not only a
[48:11] prophet but let me service he made me a
[48:14] part of
[48:17] him the church that goes to the Rapture
[48:19] is a part of Jesus
[48:22] Christ that is the church that is
[48:25] chosen even among
[48:27] the
[48:28] Jews we have the chosen ones not all the
[48:33] Jews are the chosen ones we have 144,000
[48:39] Jews these are the
[48:41] elect these are the chosen ones from
[48:45] among the
[48:46] Jews and so we find that even in the
[48:48] Gentile
[48:50] church we have many that are
[48:53] called they are called to leave the
[48:55] world
[48:57] and accept Jesus but they are not
[49:00] chosen the chosen ones are
[49:03] few he did not even choose you because
[49:06] of what you
[49:08] did we will get see it as we go down
[49:11] there he chose
[49:13] you because of his grace he chose you
[49:17] because of his
[49:19] predestination according to his
[49:21] knowledge according to his um it is his
[49:24] prerogative
[49:27] who he
[49:28] chooses and and and therefore he comes
[49:30] and says you are a chosen
[49:33] generation you are a royal priesthood a
[49:36] holy nation A peculiar
[49:39] people and I want to show you where the
[49:41] power of the of the Church of the chosen
[49:43] ones of the Bride
[49:45] [Music]
[49:46] is a prophet would say
[49:48] here in the revelation of Jesus
[49:52] Christ now there now remember this
[49:55] Christ in the
[49:57] Church in Christ in the true
[50:00] church is a continuation of the book of
[50:05] Acts you know the book of we have four
[50:08] four
[50:10] books Mark Luke Matthew and John these
[50:15] are the
[50:16] Gospels it
[50:18] records the things that Jesus
[50:22] said it records the things as it
[50:26] happened
[50:28] according to what they
[50:29] heard or according to what they
[50:32] witnessed that's why we said The Gospel
[50:35] According to
[50:36] Mark The Gospel according to
[50:38] Matthew the Gospel According to
[50:42] Luke now for example I'll give you one
[50:46] example Mark says in the Book of Mark
[50:50] 16 that going the world preached the
[50:54] gospel he says Jesus said these words
[50:57] this is Mark that Jesus said go in the
[51:01] world preach the gospel to every
[51:03] creature that believes and is baptized
[51:07] shall be saved that's what Mark
[51:11] comments but when it comes to
[51:13] Matthew Matthew says Jesus
[51:17] said uh um um in Matthew 28 now he says
[51:22] going the whole world and okay I forgot
[51:26] the
[51:27] way he renders that let us get it okay
[51:29] it says it says go ye there and teach
[51:33] All
[51:34] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[51:37] the father and of the son and of the
[51:40] Holy Spirit teaching them to observe all
[51:44] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[51:47] and lo I Am With You Always even until
[51:49] the end of the world so who is
[51:53] correct so people the theologians they
[51:59] debating no Matthew is not correct no
[52:02] Mark is correct but Mark here added
[52:05] this but the word of God is Not subject
[52:08] for
[52:09] debate the word of God is fully
[52:13] correct how many agree with me you say
[52:16] Amen the word of God is yeah and amen to
[52:19] the
[52:20] believer in this church we believe every
[52:24] word we believe every verse
[52:27] we believe every line we believe every
[52:29] word what even even a full
[52:32] stop can I have a big amen to the
[52:34] Believers who
[52:35] believe so whatever they say is
[52:38] correct and the Bible does not
[52:43] contradict but now we find that Matthew
[52:45] said that and and Mark said that but now
[52:50] the holy spirit is the one that maybe
[52:53] this one is saying what they had or the
[52:55] other saying what they had
[52:57] but when the Holy Spirit comes
[53:00] down on the day of
[53:02] Pentecost it begins in the book of Acts
[53:04] chapter
[53:06] 2 from that moment onwards they were not
[53:10] saying what they
[53:13] heard they were not saying what they
[53:16] saw but they were
[53:19] demonstrating what Jesus Christ himself
[53:23] say let me take it a little higher
[53:27] demonstrating who they had
[53:30] become because of what Jesus said they
[53:33] were so now the book of
[53:36] Acts is not a
[53:38] story is not um you know reference
[53:43] they're referring to this referring to
[53:45] that it is now the the place where Acts
[53:49] were
[53:52] done they did not instruct they did not
[53:54] say that Jesus told them to baptize
[53:58] but that's where they
[54:00] baptized and you find that all people
[54:02] were
[54:03] baptized in the book of Acts we are
[54:06] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[54:09] Christ and that's why we keep on saying
[54:12] if anyone is not baptized in the name of
[54:14] Jesus
[54:16] Christ they need to go back again to the
[54:19] water because they were never baptized
[54:22] correctly now the book of every other
[54:25] book
[54:26] you go back and read go and check every
[54:30] book ends with the word
[54:33] amen amen is a full
[54:36] St but the book of
[54:38] Acts has no Amen on
[54:41] it because it did not
[54:43] end the book of Acts
[54:47] continues for as many as we receive the
[54:49] Holy
[54:50] Ghost amen will do the things that was
[54:54] done in the book of Acts
[54:57] hallelujah amen God is still here on the
[55:00] SC God is not dead our God is alive
[55:05] everything that was done we still do it
[55:08] today what do you find in the book of
[55:11] Acts you find Believers that cast out
[55:14] Devils we still believe in believe in
[55:16] casting out Devils today we find
[55:19] believers who we baptized we still
[55:22] baptized today by the way can you
[55:24] imagine they are preach who are
[55:26] preaching that baptism is no longer
[55:31] necessary which Bible do they
[55:34] read water baptism is
[55:37] necessary for every
[55:39] believer because we are continuing the
[55:42] book of
[55:44] Acts the Holy Spirit came
[55:47] then and baptized
[55:49] Believers he still comes
[55:51] today amen if if if there were tongues
[55:54] and interpretation of tongues
[55:58] same thing must happen
[56:00] today now in the true
[56:03] church but in the false
[56:05] Church you will find the same things but
[56:08] upside
[56:10] down in the false Church you are going
[56:12] to find women
[56:14] preachers in the book of Acts you don't
[56:17] even find one single woman
[56:21] preacher but in the false churches you
[56:24] will find women preachers
[56:26] you will find women wearing
[56:28] trousers you will find women having the
[56:30] spirit of
[56:32] Jezebel rather than the spirit of
[56:34] Christ that's the false church but in
[56:37] every true
[56:39] church now what is the church we are
[56:42] just a fellowship of the
[56:44] church the Church of Jesus is all over
[56:47] the
[56:48] world it is a mystical
[56:51] body it is all over the world and
[56:54] whenever you find a fellowship
[56:57] a group that is part of that church they
[57:00] will practice exactly what is in the
[57:05] Bible and I believe here we are part of
[57:07] that
[57:09] body and then he says that now Christ in
[57:12] the true church is a continuation of the
[57:14] book of
[57:18] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[57:20] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[57:22] come into the church and defile it
[57:30] you know the desire of the devil is to
[57:31] make it look
[57:33] warm to make it
[57:37] formal to make it
[57:39] powerless may we never become
[57:43] formal a place where you even go to
[57:45] church and you feel so heavy you can't
[57:47] even say
[57:50] Amen the reason why that
[57:52] happens is because the devil is making
[57:54] you for
[57:56] there are many spirits sitting on
[57:59] you which are not the spirits of Christ
[58:02] but if the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[58:03] sitting on you and you hear the word
[58:07] echoing in your ears it will give you
[58:10] the
[58:11] appetite you will automatically begin to
[58:13] love it you will begin to say Amen you
[58:17] will begin to cheer the word you will
[58:19] begin to shout
[58:20] hallelujah why because Christ the spirit
[58:25] of Christ is upon
[58:27] but he says the spirit of the
[58:30] Antichrist wants to make the church look
[58:33] warm
[58:35] foral and
[58:37] Powerless now the Book of Revelation
[58:39] exposes
[58:42] Satan revealing his
[58:45] works now the works of Satan is the
[58:48] attempted destruction of God's
[58:53] people and the discrediting of his
[58:58] word right down to the time he cast he
[59:01] cast into the Lake of
[59:05] Fire that the Book of Revelation Reveals
[59:08] All
[59:09] That Satan FS
[59:12] that he cannot stand it he knows and I
[59:16] wanted to begin with this quote because
[59:18] it brings out my title properly and I
[59:19] wanted to
[59:22] here Satan knows that if the people
[59:27] get the true
[59:29] revelation of the true
[59:31] church and what she
[59:35] is and what she stands
[59:38] for and that she the church can do the
[59:42] Greater
[59:43] Works she will be an invisible
[59:48] Army the devil knows that if the church
[59:53] finds out who she is
[59:56] and there that's why the devil tries his
[59:58] best to cover her
[1:00:02] eyes you shouldn't know who you
[1:00:04] are you shouldn't know who you
[1:00:07] are and so people are walking
[1:00:10] blind they
[1:00:13] blindfolded by demons
[1:00:15] in they
[1:00:17] blindfolded to who really they are the
[1:00:21] devil reduces
[1:00:22] them to being a denomination
[1:00:26] the devil reduces them to the to the to
[1:00:28] their
[1:00:29] weaknesses and the things happening
[1:00:31] around them the devil reduces
[1:00:35] them and you know the things I'm
[1:00:37] speaking to you here friends I have been
[1:00:39] in a lot of counseling
[1:00:43] sessions and I don't know how you are
[1:00:46] but I'll tell you you know we we are in
[1:00:47] a very difficult
[1:00:50] generation we are in a
[1:00:52] generation that the devil is ready
[1:00:56] if possible to completely remove and
[1:00:59] destroy the
[1:01:01] church and when you talk to young people
[1:01:05] you realize many of them don't actually
[1:01:07] understand the authority they have over
[1:01:11] sat they cannot
[1:01:13] understand what God has said they
[1:01:16] are they cannot understand what the word
[1:01:20] of God says even about
[1:01:23] them and how is the devil going to
[1:01:25] hinder them from understanding by making
[1:01:28] them not read the
[1:01:30] word by by you know making them so
[1:01:33] busy by the way social
[1:01:36] media is our number one
[1:01:40] Enemy Number One
[1:01:42] Enemy Number One
[1:01:45] enemy you know you can spend two
[1:01:48] hours how many have smartphones
[1:01:52] here and even to those of you who have
[1:01:54] not I'm sure you're planning to have one
[1:01:57] very
[1:01:58] soon and I'm sure you had one
[1:02:01] before and you you can spend 2 hours 3
[1:02:06] hours
[1:02:08] scrolling scrolling you don't know what
[1:02:11] is
[1:02:12] down but you keep
[1:02:14] scrolling and and the devil keeps us
[1:02:17] that
[1:02:18] way the more we spend time there the
[1:02:22] less time we spend in the
[1:02:24] world and why is he doing
[1:02:26] he doesn't want us to realize who we
[1:02:31] are and the more things you watch on
[1:02:34] social
[1:02:35] media the more you will know your
[1:02:38] weaknesses you will find what others are
[1:02:41] doing you will see the Badness in people
[1:02:45] and you realize that you are almost like
[1:02:47] them as
[1:02:48] well and so you you just well it's not
[1:02:51] after all it's not only
[1:02:53] me it's everybody else
[1:02:59] but the word of God reveals what the
[1:03:02] true church
[1:03:03] is and what she stands for and what she
[1:03:07] can
[1:03:08] do and once the church realizes who she
[1:03:11] is and what she stands for and what she
[1:03:13] can
[1:03:15] do she will be an
[1:03:18] army that cannot be
[1:03:22] defeated if they get a true revelation
[1:03:26] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:03:28] of the Christian
[1:03:31] church and by God's spirit design and
[1:03:34] withstand the Antichrist
[1:03:39] Spirit Satan will be
[1:03:43] powerless before
[1:03:46] her if you can be able to understand the
[1:03:48] two
[1:03:50] Spirits working in the framework of the
[1:03:52] Christian
[1:03:54] church and by God his holy
[1:03:58] spirit you are able to discern and
[1:04:01] overcome and withand and overcome and
[1:04:04] fight over and
[1:04:08] overcome the Antichrist
[1:04:11] Spirit now Satan is
[1:04:14] powerful but before you who has received
[1:04:17] that
[1:04:19] Revelation Satan will be
[1:04:22] powerless meaning he will do everything
[1:04:24] he has been doing before
[1:04:26] but before you he cannot move you an
[1:04:31] inch he cannot overcome you you shall
[1:04:34] not be moved because you have realized
[1:04:37] who you
[1:04:38] are when someone realizes who they
[1:04:42] are there is nothing can move
[1:04:46] them praise the name of the
[1:04:49] Lord when I was in M I gave a
[1:04:53] story did give a talked about this
[1:04:56] little slave
[1:04:58] boy and how when he went to
[1:05:03] slavery he was very
[1:05:06] different and you know they would come
[1:05:09] buy these slaves byy the
[1:05:11] slaves and so when he wanted this slave
[1:05:14] master looked at this
[1:05:16] one and he said let me buy this
[1:05:19] one he said this one is not for
[1:05:22] sale he said why is it not for sale
[1:05:25] one is mine said but I want this one
[1:05:29] because it's very special he said no I
[1:05:32] want he not for sale they said why is it
[1:05:35] different he told him I'll tell you I
[1:05:38] found out that back at their home the
[1:05:43] Homeland where he came from he was a son
[1:05:46] of a
[1:05:47] king he was a
[1:05:50] slave among the slaves but he behaved
[1:05:53] different
[1:05:56] he talked
[1:05:57] different he walked
[1:05:59] different he his
[1:06:02] mannerism the way about
[1:06:05] him everything was
[1:06:08] different he was in pain like the
[1:06:10] rest he was in suffering like the rest
[1:06:14] he was in poverty like the rest he he
[1:06:17] was in trials and Temptation like the
[1:06:19] rest but he was
[1:06:21] different his stood with shoulders High
[1:06:26] he never did confess that he was a slave
[1:06:29] he could not confess he was a slave why
[1:06:32] because he knew who he was no amount of
[1:06:36] slavery no amount of trouble no amount
[1:06:39] of problems could make him sto so
[1:06:43] long because he knew who he was he was a
[1:06:47] son of a king and now the Bible has said
[1:06:50] we are a royal
[1:06:52] priesthood we are a chosen generation
[1:06:56] we are a holy nation we are peculiar
[1:06:59] people God said all these
[1:07:02] things about us before we are even
[1:07:06] born Hallelujah so it's not about us
[1:07:10] it's about what he has said about
[1:07:13] us and if we can only
[1:07:16] know the power The Authority that the
[1:07:20] word has given to us the devil is going
[1:07:23] to become powerless before us
[1:07:26] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen if
[1:07:29] you can only know amen what the word
[1:07:32] tells us if we can only have the
[1:07:37] revelation we know now because I've read
[1:07:39] it for you but I'm talking about having
[1:07:41] a
[1:07:44] revelation if you can have the
[1:07:46] revelation of who you are of what you
[1:07:49] stand for amen amen if you can only have
[1:07:52] that
[1:07:53] Revelation the devil become
[1:07:58] powerless and you will become an
[1:08:00] invisible
[1:08:03] Army meaning every battle you fight you
[1:08:06] will win it every battle over sickness
[1:08:10] every battle over temp every over sin
[1:08:13] you will def every over poverty you will
[1:08:17] overcome why because you are become an
[1:08:20] invisible
[1:08:21] Army you will not live like the rest of
[1:08:24] them when everybody
[1:08:26] accepts you know the spirits come upon
[1:08:29] them and eventually they they say they
[1:08:33] accept you find someone actually
[1:08:36] literally you know having a spirit of
[1:08:39] last overtaken with this woman that
[1:08:42] woman that woman that
[1:08:44] woman and then he realizes I think me
[1:08:47] I'm born this
[1:08:49] way I have
[1:08:51] accepted I cannot have only one
[1:08:54] wife find them now marrying here
[1:08:58] marrying there having children he
[1:09:00] doesn't even know the number of children
[1:09:02] he

[1:09:05] accepted that he is weak that he is
[1:09:09] adulterous but now let me tell you amen

[1:09:16] you will be fought and tempted in your
[1:09:18] body like
[1:09:21] them but amen if you have a
[1:09:23] revelation of who you are of what Christ
[1:09:27] the word has told you that you are then

[1:09:33] to be an
[1:09:36] invisible it will be impossible for the
[1:09:39] devil to defeat you it will be
[1:09:41] impossible for the spirit of
[1:09:44] adultery to overtake you you young

[1:12:41] me I read as I read that
[1:12:44] letter she she she said I remember some
[1:12:47] of the
[1:12:48] words why are you behaving around me

[1:14:15] pastor and the devil told me you know

[1:14:31] even and I went to the Pastor said
[1:14:35] pastor there is something I wanted to
[1:14:37] talk to you about and it was a big
[1:14:39] burden for me by the way now when I look
[1:14:42] back I said really it
[1:14:43] was it was a devil trying to tempt
[1:14:46] me to try to kill
[1:14:50] me but because I realized who I
[1:14:53] was and he said what is
[1:14:56] it I told him I have this
[1:14:59] letter I I I just want to give it to
[1:15:02] you I walked away I just gave it to him
[1:15:07] and walked
[1:15:08] away when I reached back in my room I
[1:15:11] realized I received
[1:15:15] Victory I was no longer
[1:15:17] nervous but I was so happy so full of
[1:15:21] freedom I began worshiping I began
[1:15:24] praying
[1:15:25] that that kind of Prayer of Victory but
[1:15:28] if you are defeated we shall see you by
[1:15:30] the way you appear in
[1:15:34] church especially you younger people who
[1:15:37] come to church and you appear as if a

[1:16:33] kind of uh in some kind of
[1:16:35] prison and tell you you are this you are
[1:16:38] that that's why you even found people
[1:16:41] coming
[1:16:43] up after many
[1:16:46] years there's this preacher in
[1:16:49] America he a shame friends the
[1:16:52] generation we are living in
[1:16:55] he came up I think after many
[1:16:58] years and they they were calling him
[1:17:01] Bishop
[1:17:02] Bishop he said brothers and
[1:17:05] sisters I'm tired of
[1:17:07] hiding finally I'm coming
[1:17:11] out to announce to all of
[1:17:14] you that that I'm
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:19] gay and everybody was
[1:17:22] like what is that someone who who does
[1:17:26] not know who they
[1:17:28] are and let me tell you friends these
[1:17:32] spirits and not only in the
[1:17:36] world whatever the enemy will try to use
[1:17:39] about with on anyone in the
[1:17:43] world he will try on the
[1:17:47] church all these immoral
[1:17:50] Spirits you may never be even tested by
[1:17:53] drinking or smoking or what
[1:17:56] more but you can be tested in some other
[1:17:59] area whereby it is even
[1:18:04] unexpected but now the question is who
[1:18:08] are
[1:18:09] you are you what your body says you
[1:18:13] are are you what the people says you
[1:18:16] are are you what the devil says you
[1:18:19] are are you what circumstances around
[1:18:22] you say you are
[1:18:25] listen friends this is this is what has
[1:18:27] given me
[1:18:28] strength this is what has given me power
[1:18:32] over sin over the devil for the past 18
[1:18:36] 19
[1:18:37] years of my salvation I have always
[1:18:41] taken what God says I
[1:18:44] am and I always confess What God Says I
[1:18:48] Am and when you confess What God Says
[1:18:52] You Are
[1:18:54] can never be
[1:18:56] defeated by any power by any Force by
[1:19:01] any Devil by any demon why you will live
[1:19:04] above
[1:19:06] it you will be overcoming
[1:19:09] daily and I want to give you a Biblical
[1:19:11] example here of a man called
[1:19:15] Gideon judges 6 verse1
[1:19:27] judges chter 6
[1:19:30] verse1 and the children of Israel did
[1:19:33] evil in the sight of the Lord and the
[1:19:35] Lord delivered them into the hand of the
[1:19:37] Midian of of Midian seven years and the
[1:19:40] Hand of the Midian and the Hand of
[1:19:42] Midian prevailed against Israel and and
[1:19:46] because of the midianites the children
[1:19:48] of Israel made them dens which are in
[1:19:51] the mountains and caves and strongholds
[1:20:19] praise the name of the
[1:20:20] Lord now friends when you do that which
[1:20:25] is evil in the sight of the
[1:20:27] Lord the Lord will deliver you in the
[1:20:30] hand of your
[1:20:36] enemy and the Hand of your of your
[1:20:39] enemy will actually Prevail against
[1:20:43] you now this is what Satan wants us to
[1:20:46] think about
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:48] ourselves he wants us to
[1:20:51] live in
[1:20:53] caves in
[1:20:55] dens in
[1:20:57] strongholds he wants us to to live in
[1:21:01] hiding he wants us to live in
[1:21:03] fear they had lived untrue to
[1:21:07] God but
[1:21:09] regardless they were still his
[1:21:14] children how many understand what I'm
[1:21:16] saying Israel had lived un
[1:21:19] true and because of that God gave them
[1:21:22] gave them over to the hand of the enemy
[1:21:25] for seven years whatever they would
[1:21:30] cultivate at the time of harvest the
[1:21:33] midianites would come to
[1:21:35] harvest and whenever the Israelites saw
[1:21:38] the midianites
[1:21:41] coming they would quickly run
[1:21:44] away and hide in
[1:21:46] dens hide in
[1:21:48] mountains caves and strongholds and and
[1:21:52] that's why the devil wants the church
[1:21:53] how has to
[1:21:55] be the devil wants it that whenever you
[1:21:59] see him
[1:22:00] coming he wants you to take off he wants
[1:22:04] you to live in fear he wants you to live
[1:22:07] in
[1:22:07] hiding whereby he knows you fear that
[1:22:12] Spirit each of you Church each of you
[1:22:15] each of us has something whereby you
[1:22:18] attempted
[1:22:20] by actually in the in the Bible in the
[1:22:23] book of James
[1:22:26] let me just present this onto you church
[1:22:28] tonight and I hope it will be a blessing
[1:22:29] to somebody
[1:22:33] tonight okay now in the Book of
[1:22:37] James I believe it is um chapter
[1:22:47] one vers
[1:22:50] 13 I'll begin from vers
[1:22:53] 12 blessed is the man that endureth
[1:23:00] Temptation so now listen please
[1:23:03] CL which means
[1:23:05] Temptation you can't pray like this oh
[1:23:09] God take away
[1:23:11] Temptation it is not going to go
[1:23:15] away are you hearing me are you hearing
[1:23:18] me Church Brother Joseph God is not
[1:23:21] going to come and catch it and take it
[1:23:23] away
[1:23:25] it's going to remain
[1:23:28] there but it says blessed are
[1:23:30] you if you endure
[1:23:35] it now enduring it meaning going through
[1:23:39] it pressing
[1:23:41] through overcoming
[1:23:44] daily blessed is the man that endureth
[1:23:48] Temptation for when he is
[1:23:51] tried he shall receive the Crown of Life
[1:23:55] which the Lord has promised to them that
[1:23:57] love
[1:24:04] him let no man say when he is tempted I
[1:24:09] am tempted of God for God cannot be
[1:24:12] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[1:24:14] any man
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] you understand so God cannot tempt
[1:24:31] you no and God cannot be tempted with
[1:24:36] evil so when you are in a
[1:24:38] Temptation don't say God is
[1:24:41] tempting God cannot tempt you but I will
[1:24:44] tell you what tempts
[1:24:46] you the scripture says every man is
[1:24:49] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:24:52] last and enticed
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:03] so you see the Bible now here says every
[1:25:05] man is drawn away of his own
[1:25:11] desires and you know it entices
[1:25:14] you you find everybody has a different
[1:25:17] kind of weakness or
[1:25:21] Temptation and you see he says that when
[1:25:24] last has conceived when that desire
[1:25:30] conceived now now okay are you following
[1:25:33] me now these are a very good scriptural
[1:25:35] things we can be able to look at to help
[1:25:38] us
[1:25:39] overcome now he says when last has con
[1:25:43] when when last he says okay wait he says
[1:25:44] when last has
[1:25:48] conceived so last
[1:25:51] conceives last is your desire
[1:25:55] your desires things that entice
[1:25:58] you things that pull you away from
[1:26:01] God things that seduce
[1:26:04] you amen it says that when it comes to
[1:26:08] you when it is finished with you when
[1:26:11] you feed it and you give it
[1:26:13] room it impant
[1:26:16] you so in your spiritual womb you become
[1:26:22] pregnant with your
[1:26:26] L that's why you find you know people
[1:26:29] who watch certain things you know you
[1:26:31] find that they keep watching it they
[1:26:33] keep watch until they they get
[1:26:39] pregnancy when people talk to bad
[1:26:42] people people who are already perverted
[1:26:44] in their
[1:26:45] minds so over and over and over and over
[1:26:49] you find that also in in your mind you
[1:26:52] begin feeding yourself with those things
[1:26:55] you become pregnant of that Spirit you
[1:26:59] have not actually done anything bad
[1:27:03] yet but you are pregnant with that
[1:27:08] Spirit it may be a spirit of
[1:27:11] theft and you pregnant with it but you
[1:27:15] have never stolen
[1:27:17] anything but you are the one who always
[1:27:19] goes and watches movies of Thieves
[1:27:24] you you always want to hear stories of
[1:27:27] Thieves you meet people who are
[1:27:30] thieves and you find that someone
[1:27:33] actually even can know how they break
[1:27:35] into a house where when what time he
[1:27:37] knows all the
[1:27:42] tactics how do they know that they are
[1:27:46] pregnant with the spirit of Seft
[1:27:50] and you find another person maybe is
[1:27:53] pregnant
[1:27:55] with the spirit of
[1:27:56] Witchcraft he has never
[1:27:58] Bewitched but you see he puts you know
[1:28:01] how does bewitching
[1:28:03] begin it begins with
[1:28:05] hatred and then you know you add on
[1:28:09] rumors and gossip and and then from
[1:28:13] there and then competition and from
[1:28:16] there then you feel like it is a
[1:28:21] process you begin to have a pregnancy
[1:28:25] everybody is saying God bless you God
[1:28:27] bless you you brother you a sister but
[1:28:29] you are
[1:28:30] pregnant not pregnant of the word but
[1:28:33] prant of a
[1:28:36] spirit to that people who go into
[1:28:39] fornication you don't just
[1:28:41] fornicate it begins with pregnan
[1:28:43] spiritual
[1:28:45] pregnancy whereby you begin watching bad
[1:28:49] videos reading bad
[1:28:52] magazines whereby you begin going into
[1:28:55] wrong
[1:28:57] things and you talk to about wrong
[1:29:00] people and and you know all these things
[1:29:03] begin to come on your
[1:29:05] mind and you become
[1:29:08] pregnant you know all the
[1:29:12] figures you know everything about
[1:29:15] women how do we know you the moment you
[1:29:18] bring that
[1:29:19] subject you become excited
[1:29:24] you even see them in the
[1:29:26] church when we whenever we call youth
[1:29:30] meetings and you want to talk about God
[1:29:32] boy
[1:29:33] relationship these who are over
[1:29:36] excited because they already
[1:29:39] pregnant with a certain Spirit leading
[1:29:42] them to Immortal
[1:29:44] living you know you begin by filling
[1:29:46] your mind and seeing wrong things and
[1:29:49] hearing wrong things and you know you
[1:29:51] know when you open all those Gates
[1:29:56] of your mind of your spirit of your
[1:30:01] flesh you become
[1:30:03] pregnant of that uh of that
[1:30:08] lust of that
[1:30:10] desire you know you know you can you
[1:30:13] know talk about other desires there very
[1:30:14] many many
[1:30:16] desires some alcohol other smoking and
[1:30:20] other things you know you become
[1:30:22] pregnant
[1:30:24] and then he
[1:30:26] says and after you have
[1:30:29] conceived that conception bringeth forth
[1:30:34] sin so here is where you find a person
[1:30:38] when you talk about something or rather
[1:30:41] you talk against it they don't like
[1:30:45] you you always want to judge
[1:30:48] people what is wrong with
[1:30:51] fornication can't you preach without
[1:30:53] mentioning fornication
[1:30:55] because they already
[1:30:57] Sinners who is a sinner a sinner is a
[1:31:01] nonbeliever whereby the word of God
[1:31:04] comes and it judges you but you're not
[1:31:07] willing to accept
[1:31:10] it so now that
[1:31:12] pregnanc bring for
[1:31:14] sin and remember anything you do it
[1:31:19] begins with this
[1:31:22] pregnancy what if committed
[1:31:25] adultery it began with sin with
[1:31:28] unbelief by unbelieving what God
[1:31:32] Said and doing things according to her
[1:31:35] own
[1:31:38] L and and now sin is not the
[1:31:41] end and When sin is
[1:31:44] finished it bringeth forth
[1:31:47] death now when you die you can't be born
[1:31:51] again
[1:31:54] you're
[1:31:56] gone the Bible even says it is
[1:31:59] impossible you are once
[1:32:01] enlightened you tested of the gift of
[1:32:05] God and then you go back again and and
[1:32:08] and you become pregnant and you you sin
[1:32:11] and you
[1:32:15] die there's no more that can be done for
[1:32:19] you so what ought we to do we are
[1:32:23] supposed to in
[1:32:24] fear we are supposed to walk in
[1:32:28] sincerity we are supposed to actually
[1:32:30] know what the word of God says that we
[1:32:35] are otherwise I'm not saying church that
[1:32:37] you should not have um you know the
[1:32:40] Temptations and desires that are
[1:32:45] wrong actually anybody who preaches that
[1:32:47] is preaching a wrong
[1:32:50] doctr what the gospel does for us
[1:32:54] is not to take away from our flesh bad
[1:33:00] desires because our flesh can never be
[1:33:03] born
[1:33:04] again our flesh can never receive the
[1:33:06] Holy
[1:33:07] Ghost but what the word
[1:33:10] does is to fill us with the power of the
[1:33:14] Holy Ghost in our
[1:33:16] soul that we may be able to put our
[1:33:20] flesh under subjection
[1:33:25] the Bible says work in the
[1:33:27] spirit so that you will not
[1:33:31] fulfill the desires of the
[1:33:34] flesh meaning the desires of the flesh
[1:33:37] will be
[1:33:39] there even when you receive the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost the desires of the flesh will
[1:33:44] remain
[1:33:45] there but when you have the Holy Spirit
[1:33:49] and you working in the spirit you will
[1:33:52] not fulfill them
[1:33:54] because you will now only be listening
[1:33:56] to One Thing the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:58] in
[1:34:00] you you'll be listen to One Thing who
[1:34:04] you are who you are there are certain
[1:34:07] things our president cannot
[1:34:10] do not because he cannot do but because
[1:34:14] of who he is and because he knows who he
[1:34:17] is there are certain things the king of
[1:34:20] England cannot do because he doesn't
[1:34:24] have the ability to do them but because
[1:34:27] of who he is hallelujah you can't find
[1:34:30] our
[1:34:31] president going there ordering forx on
[1:34:34] the
[1:34:37] street you can't find him doing
[1:34:39] that eating maze on the
[1:34:43] road doesn't he have the ability to do
[1:34:46] that he does but he can't do it because
[1:34:50] he knows who he is so now when you
[1:34:53] receive the
[1:34:54] revelation of who you are you know you
[1:34:57] have a better
[1:34:59] life you can live a higher life you will
[1:35:03] aim and treat yourself with
[1:35:06] respect With
[1:35:08] Honor because you have a
[1:35:11] revelation that there are certain things
[1:35:13] you cannot
[1:35:15] do because of who you
[1:35:19] [Music]
[1:35:21] are now we see here
[1:35:24] the
[1:35:25] Israelites were living in
[1:35:27] dens in caves and in
[1:35:33] strongholds in vers
[1:35:36] three and so it was when Israel had
[1:35:39] sown that the midianites came up and the
[1:35:42] amalekites and the children of of the
[1:35:44] East even they came up against them
[1:35:57] and and they encamped against them and
[1:35:59] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[1:36:01] Thou come unto Gaza and left no
[1:36:04] sustainance for Israel neither sheep nor
[1:36:06] Ox nor ass
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:23] came up with their cattle and their
[1:36:25] tents and they came as grasshoppers for
[1:36:28] multitude for both they and their camels
[1:36:31] were without number and they entered
[1:36:33] into the land to destroy
[1:36:49] it and Israel was greatly impoverished
[1:36:53] because of the midianites and the
[1:36:54] children of Israel Cried unto the Lord
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:02] hallelujah now let me tell you friends
[1:37:05] if you're a child of
[1:37:07] God if you do your sins you pay for your
[1:37:11] sins that's true I will not lie to you
[1:37:13] about
[1:37:18] that praise God I know you don't want to
[1:37:21] hear that that's the truth if you live
[1:37:26] wrongly and a wrong kind of
[1:37:28] life you will pay for it in this
[1:37:32] life knowing if you do things knowingly
[1:37:35] that they're
[1:37:38] wrong there's always payback
[1:37:41] time and Israel was going through
[1:37:43] payback time
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:46] here where the amerit and the midianites
[1:37:49] came up against
[1:37:51] them and they were
[1:37:54] they were destroying all their
[1:37:56] Harvest they came in as grasshoppers to
[1:37:59] destroy
[1:38:01] them and they they made them
[1:38:04] poor that's what the devil wants to do
[1:38:07] some of you you may actually be
[1:38:09] physically
[1:38:11] poor having having Financial
[1:38:15] issues simply because you didn't pay
[1:38:17] your
[1:38:18] Ty God will allow you the amerit and the
[1:38:21] medit to come and make
[1:38:27] it is the
[1:38:28] consequence to your
[1:38:30] wrongdoing so you see but if you pay
[1:38:33] your tiers and
[1:38:35] offerings God promised to protect your
[1:38:39] increase to preserve it to bless you do
[1:38:43] we believe that
[1:38:45] church but then we see here when Israel
[1:38:48] moved that way and they displeased God
[1:38:52] he allowed midianites and the
[1:38:56] Amit to come up against them and D they
[1:38:59] destroy their
[1:39:02] increase they came in as
[1:39:05] grasshoppers Israelites became
[1:39:08] poor the med Came Upon them as
[1:39:10] grasshoppers to destroy
[1:39:13] them but one part I loved here and the
[1:39:16] children of Israel Cried unto the
[1:39:20] Lord that's one thing that we have
[1:39:24] as an upper
[1:39:26] hand against our
[1:39:29] enemy amen that's why I love what Mah
[1:39:32] said Mah said Rejoice not against
[1:39:36] me oh my enemy when I sit in darkness
[1:39:41] the Lord shall be a light unto me when I
[1:39:43] fall down I shall rise up if you're a
[1:39:46] child of God no matter what happens it
[1:39:50] is who God said you are
[1:39:53] and amen if God was to choose he will
[1:39:57] always choose
[1:39:58] you he will always choose you amen when
[1:40:03] you cry unto him he will always have
[1:40:07] mercy and our hope is not in any
[1:40:09] material
[1:40:12] wealth or in any man our hope is in God
[1:40:17] when we are in
[1:40:20] trouble friends if you see things not
[1:40:22] going well
[1:40:26] especially most of you young
[1:40:29] people in your financial life
[1:40:31] and before you go to
[1:40:34] people and even you
[1:40:37] adults please lend me some money me some
[1:40:41] money please before you do
[1:40:44] that
[1:40:47] first go to God In
[1:40:50] Prayer search your life
[1:40:54] how is your spiritual
[1:40:56] life are you standing right with
[1:40:59] God because it may be God who has
[1:41:01] allowed that to
[1:41:06] happen imagine a
[1:41:08] brother who doesn't pay
[1:41:11] TI God says he a
[1:41:14] robber and then he says he puts
[1:41:19] money in the pocket where there is
[1:41:22] hes now that kind of brother he will
[1:41:25] always be in
[1:41:29] lack and now imagine that kind of
[1:41:32] brother coming to you who pays your tith
[1:41:34] as
[1:41:36] proper saying borrow
[1:41:38] me and you also my
[1:41:45] brother are you on the side of
[1:41:47] God or you are not there are certain
[1:41:50] people you can even help
[1:41:54] and you also yourself get in
[1:41:58] trouble because you you're not on the
[1:42:01] side of
[1:42:02] God that's why everything we do we have
[1:42:05] to seek the mind of
[1:42:08] God what is God's will about
[1:42:11] that so you can be able to do what is
[1:42:15] acceptable and the will of
[1:42:17] God and so we find that when a child of
[1:42:21] God is in trouble
[1:42:23] you should always come to God In
[1:42:25] Prayer because God has
[1:42:29] answers to your
[1:42:31] troubles Psalms 1211 it says I will lift
[1:42:34] up my my eyes to the
[1:42:37] heels from when cometh my help my Help

[1:43:47] FL the spirit of the Lord shall lift up
[1:43:52] a standard against

[1:44:37] From The Lord when all the

[1:44:51] In Prayer

[1:45:51] dwelling I want to say to you
[1:45:54] Church make the Lord your
[1:45:58] habitation amen do not plant things when
[1:46:01] you are out of the will of
[1:46:05] God our hope as
[1:46:09] Believers is not in the things that man
[1:46:11] can
[1:46:13] do our hope as
[1:46:15] Believers is in God if you're trusting
[1:46:19] your husband trusting your wife your
[1:46:22] father your
[1:46:23] friend more than you trust in
[1:46:26] God it's not going to be well with
[1:46:29] you but may God help us that we'll be
[1:46:33] able to trust in him so let us finish up
[1:46:36] this story in of
[1:46:38] Gideon verse S and it came to pass when
[1:46:41] the children of Israel Cried unto the
[1:46:42] Lord because of the
[1:46:47] midianites that the Lord sent a prophet
[1:46:49] unto the children of Israel
[1:46:53] which said unto them thus sayith the
[1:46:55] Lord God of
[1:46:57] Israel I brought you up from
[1:47:01] Egypt and brought you forth out of the
[1:47:03] house of the of
[1:47:06] bondage and I delivered you out of the
[1:47:09] hand of the
[1:47:10] Egyptians and out of the all that
[1:47:13] oppressed
[1:47:14] you and drave them out from before
[1:47:18] you and I gave you their Al and I said
[1:47:21] unto you I am the Lord your God he are
[1:47:25] not the god of the
[1:47:27] Amor in whose land you dwell but ye have
[1:47:30] not obeyed my
[1:47:32] voice and there came an angel of the
[1:47:36] Lord now friends the moment God brings
[1:47:39] his
[1:47:42] displeasure to his
[1:47:44] people something
[1:47:47] happen one thing led to
[1:47:50] another the first thing was the
[1:47:53] Israelites came in
[1:47:56] prayer that's why when things are
[1:47:58] happening in your
[1:47:59] family go in prayer call all your
[1:48:02] children every go in prayer let us begin
[1:48:06] to do that sometimes in the church we
[1:48:09] can do that as well if you realize
[1:48:12] things are not going well here and there
[1:48:14] you said let's call up a prayer and a
[1:48:16] fast it is healthy it is
[1:48:20] scriptural and when you do that pleases
[1:48:23] God that now God will begin will send
[1:48:26] his
[1:48:27] messenges and they will begin to speak
[1:48:29] his word and tell you his mind about
[1:48:32] what is
[1:48:34] happening so now God told them I'm not
[1:48:38] pleased with
[1:48:40] you because you have not obeyed my
[1:48:43] voice I was with you I took you out of
[1:48:46] each I brought you out of bondage I
[1:48:49] delivered you out of the hand of the
[1:48:51] Egyptians deled you out of all your
[1:48:54] oppressors I dve them out from before
[1:48:56] you I gave you their land I am the Lord
[1:49:00] your God fear not the god of the
[1:49:04] Amon in whose land you
[1:49:06] dwell but you have not obeyed my
[1:49:12] voice that was the only problem God had
[1:49:16] with but God did not forsake
[1:49:21] them that's why by the way you must
[1:49:24] always be
[1:49:25] careful very very
[1:49:28] careful to speak against a brother or a
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:35] sister I'm telling you
[1:49:37] Church do not grieve the holy
[1:49:41] spirit that Grieves the Holy
[1:49:44] Spirit if someone is the chosen of the
[1:49:47] Lord if someone is the anointed of the
[1:49:50] Lord if someone is a child of God
[1:49:53] no matter what they have done no matter
[1:49:56] what kind of Life they may be
[1:49:58] living if you can't understand what
[1:50:00] they're going
[1:50:01] through a prophet said go and encourage
[1:50:04] them but if you can't pray for them but
[1:50:09] never be
[1:50:11] found to talk against
[1:50:13] them or talk about
[1:50:16] them have you seen
[1:50:18] Brothers have you seen brother
[1:50:20] sister blah blah blah what does does a
[1:50:24] prophet said is the same as killing
[1:50:29] them you're murdering them you're not
[1:50:32] doing anything good for them you're
[1:50:34] pushing them deeper into the H they are
[1:50:37] in the reason I say that is because no
[1:50:40] matter what the elect
[1:50:43] does God always stands on the side of
[1:50:48] the Israel had
[1:50:50] SE God had given them to the hand of the
[1:50:52] evil the
[1:50:54] enemies but when they prayed but when
[1:50:58] they prayed God was moved amen and he
[1:51:01] sent a
[1:51:03] prophet whenever God sends a
[1:51:06] prophet there is something else
[1:51:08] coming Hallelujah when he sent a prophet
[1:51:12] brother also the angel of the Lord
[1:51:15] came hallelujah amen and there came an
[1:51:18] angel of the Lord and he sat on the ark
[1:51:24] that's why I say brother Henry in this
[1:51:28] generation we have received a
[1:51:32] prophet amen only two people believe it
[1:51:34] here we have received a prophet in this
[1:51:38] generation am I right to
[1:51:41] say we have the unel of the
[1:51:44] Lord watching over this
[1:51:47] message that's why I feel so
[1:51:50] sorry for people who talk against
[1:51:54] M by the way I will tell you
[1:51:57] this go back to the
[1:52:00] 50s the
[1:52:01] 60s men who walked with William
[1:52:06] Bram and were not with
[1:52:09] him but watched him from
[1:52:11] AF all these
[1:52:14] men had high regard and
[1:52:19] respect as a man of God
[1:52:22] about people like
[1:52:23] Roberts Rob Billy Graham Graham and and
[1:52:29] and actually his gift was birthed out of
[1:52:32] the Min
[1:52:34] of you find that these men were very
[1:52:39] respectful they did understood
[1:52:41] everything brother William Bram
[1:52:44] taught but they could not open their
[1:52:47] mouth to say it is of the devil or it is
[1:52:50] not correct they were quiet
[1:52:53] about they preached what they they
[1:52:58] knew I believe that's the attitude of a
[1:53:01] true child of
[1:53:04] God when someone is an elect a child of
[1:53:08] God be careful not to bring the wrath of
[1:53:10] God upon
[1:53:13] you that's why
[1:53:15] gossip gossip can take very many to
[1:53:20] Hell more than immorality will
[1:53:24] that's how dangerous it can
[1:53:26] be
[1:53:29] when and Miriam began conniving and
[1:53:33] talking behind
[1:53:35] Moses they brought a problem in the
[1:53:38] church and when God came down he wasn't
[1:53:41] on their
[1:53:42] side what were their
[1:53:44] issues is Moses the only one
[1:53:48] anointed how could he marry a
[1:53:51] med it's against the the
[1:53:54] word and they were right on both
[1:53:57] accounts but when God came down he was
[1:54:00] on on the
[1:54:01] side God is a a principle keeping
[1:54:05] God he has his principles and his
[1:54:08] principle is if he makes a confidant
[1:54:11] with
[1:54:12] anyone he he always takes his
[1:54:16] s and in this generation God has made a
[1:54:19] covenant with a prophet of this
[1:54:21] generation
[1:54:23] he made a convenant which he himself
[1:54:26] came and signed
[1:54:28] on
[1:54:29] publicly several
[1:54:32] times you go to
[1:54:35] FBI or I don't know I think it's in
[1:54:37] Congress
[1:54:39] now there's that picture of the Prophet
[1:54:43] William Bram with a pill of fire on him
[1:54:47] and the United States
[1:54:49] government authenticated it as the only
[1:54:54] document that has ever been taken with a
[1:54:58] supernatural physically
[1:55:07] visible of fire which was with Moses
[1:55:11] which was with the children of Israel in
[1:55:12] the desert which Paul saw came down in
[1:55:17] some hon
[1:55:20] in Texas and was
[1:55:24] taken when this man took these
[1:55:27] pictures all of them died on that
[1:55:31] film only one picture that one the
[1:55:35] seventh picture the seventh messenger
[1:55:39] the seventh picture was the only one
[1:55:41] which was
[1:55:42] good and when it came out and it was
[1:55:45] developed they realized the pill of fire
[1:55:48] was there the same pill of Fire
[1:55:52] was always saying he is here now the
[1:55:56] holy spirit is not to fit from where I
[1:55:58] am standing God himself came and made a
[1:56:02] covenant openly before all to see before
[1:56:06] the whole world and he said I am with
[1:56:09] this
[1:56:10] man Hallelujah and his the man died long
[1:56:14] ago but his message was Vindicated by
[1:56:19] God it has been proven by God
[1:56:23] Hallelujah and this the angel of the
[1:56:26] Lord is around this
[1:56:31] message you've seen these men who have
[1:56:33] come up
[1:56:34] recently to talk up against
[1:56:37] Israel you saw what happened to them one
[1:56:40] of them was speaking
[1:56:43] public and he spoke I don't remember the
[1:56:46] words immediately he fell down and died
[1:56:53] and recently also this man in
[1:56:57] Iran he was actually even here in
[1:57:00] Uganda he also spoke some filth stuff
[1:57:03] about
[1:57:05] Israel and both of them would be talking
[1:57:07] about the end of
[1:57:09] Israel when they talk against them
[1:57:12] against Israel being that is going to be
[1:57:13] ended wiped
[1:57:17] out God brings down his judgment
[1:57:20] upon he also died
[1:57:23] now what was God trying to do God was
[1:57:27] passing a message saying you can't do
[1:57:30] that I have a covenant with
[1:57:34] Israel right now Israel is in
[1:57:38] blindness right now Israel cannot
[1:57:41] actually receive the Messiah right
[1:57:44] now it's not their time yet it's still
[1:57:48] the gentle
[1:57:50] dispensation but even in their
[1:57:53] blindness even in their
[1:57:55] rejection God is fighting for
[1:57:58] them how much more the Bride of Jesus
[1:58:03] Christ a true Born Again child of
[1:58:06] God God will always fight for
[1:58:09] them that's why when you know who you
[1:58:12] are and people are fighting you people
[1:58:15] are speaking words against you never
[1:58:18] speak
[1:58:19] back let God fight for you
[1:58:22] because God will always fight for
[1:58:26] youu amen you just have to know who you
[1:58:30] are and right here the angel of the Lord
[1:58:34] came even when they had not heard his
[1:58:38] voice God was not
[1:58:40] ashamed to say I identify myself with
[1:58:45] Israel and there came an angel of the
[1:58:48] Lord and sat under an
[1:58:51] o which was in
[1:58:53] Oprah that pertained unto joash and the
[1:58:57] ab
[1:59:00] abite and his son Gideon threshed Wheat
[1:59:03] by the wine press to hide it from the
[1:59:05] midianites and the angel of the Lord
[1:59:07] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[1:59:10] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[1:59:20] Val now I wanted to
[1:59:22] understand Gideon was the son of
[1:59:25] um
[1:59:28] joash and this
[1:59:32] man actually his father even had an
[1:59:35] alter for
[1:59:39] B just like the rest of them they had
[1:59:42] sinned and this man Gideon was also
[1:59:49] hiding he was fearful
[1:59:53] he was
[1:59:55] sinful and that's what he had
[1:59:58] accepted about his life he was
[2:00:02] poor he was everything you can
[2:00:05] say but when God when the angel of the
[2:00:07] Lord
[2:00:08] came he told he appeared to him and he
[2:00:12] said the Lord is with
[2:00:15] you thou Mighty Man
[2:00:19] of so what should we believe about
[2:00:23] G is it the reality we are
[2:00:26] seeing or what God
[2:00:29] about hallelujah what should we believe
[2:00:32] about
[2:00:33] you is it the things around you that
[2:00:35] everybody
[2:00:36] see or what God says
[2:00:39] about what should we believe God said
[2:00:43] the Lord is with you you a mighty man of
[2:00:46] Val I believe the Lord is saying us to
[2:00:48] us the same thing tonight the Lord is
[2:00:51] with you
[2:00:53] that mighty men and women
[2:00:56] of I believe the Lord is saying the same
[2:00:58] thing to
[2:00:59] me the Lord is with
[2:01:03] me and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord
[2:01:08] if the Lord be with
[2:01:09] us have you ever seen when God says
[2:01:12] something and even you don't believe it
[2:01:13] about
[2:01:18] yourself is with you
[2:01:23] I wish Pastor knew about my
[2:01:25] life I'm a very fearful
[2:01:28] Pastor I'm even a very sner good
[2:01:34] sinner Gideon didn't believe God's
[2:01:37] testimony about
[2:01:40] him didn't say
[2:01:44] Amen my Lord if the Lord be with us why
[2:01:48] then is all this be falling us
[2:01:52] where shall be all these Miracles which
[2:01:53] our fathers told
[2:01:57] us where are
[2:01:59] they saying did not the Lord bring us up
[2:02:02] from
[2:02:03] Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us
[2:02:07] and delivered us into the hands of the
[2:02:11] midianites and the Lord looked upon
[2:02:15] him and
[2:02:17] said go in this thy might
[2:02:22] and thou shal save
[2:02:24] Israel from the hand of the
[2:02:27] midianites have not I sent
[2:02:30] thee now you are very busy complaining
[2:02:33] about your
[2:02:36] weakness God is very busy looking at
[2:02:40] your
[2:02:42] possibility your Authority your power
[2:02:46] your
[2:02:48] commission this is what God is saying
[2:02:51] and I'm here to preach to you tonight to
[2:02:53] say You must also be able to say indeed
[2:02:57] I am who God says I
[2:03:00] am because when the man was
[2:03:03] complaining about all the things around
[2:03:06] him God didn't talk about
[2:03:08] it God simply said and he says go in
[2:03:13] your
[2:03:14] might in this your
[2:03:19] might where is your strength brother
[2:03:22] your strength is in the
[2:03:24] Lord amen and thou shal save
[2:03:28] Israel from the hand of the median
[2:03:31] nightes when you see a spirit attacking
[2:03:34] the
[2:03:35] church oh the family of believer or one
[2:03:38] brother one sister you must be your
[2:03:41] brother and Sister's
[2:03:45] Keeper by praying for them by
[2:03:48] interceding for
[2:03:50] them why because if you know who you
[2:03:53] are you will never go out to begin
[2:03:57] gossip you will never go out to begin
[2:04:01] slandering but what you going to do you
[2:04:04] know who you are you are a son of God
[2:04:07] you a daugh of God with authority
[2:04:10] against every Power Of Darkness
[2:04:13] therefore you're going to come in prayer
[2:04:15] and begin to destroy one by one by one
[2:04:18] by
[2:04:19] one and deliver the children of
[2:04:22] God and he said have not I sent the and
[2:04:27] he said unto him oh my Lord where shall
[2:04:31] I save
[2:04:32] Israel behold my family is
[2:04:35] poor in man and I'm the least of my
[2:04:38] father's house and the Lord said unto
[2:04:41] him surely I'll be with you and thou
[2:04:46] shalt Smite the
[2:04:48] midianites as one
[2:04:50] man hey
[2:04:52] my when I read these things I'm
[2:04:54] chared because I feel like God was
[2:04:58] lifting up
[2:05:00] Gideon to a place that Gideon never
[2:05:03] thought he
[2:05:06] was where are you seeing
[2:05:08] yourself Gideon was seeing himself as a
[2:05:11] poor
[2:05:12] man Gideon was seeing himself as a man
[2:05:14] from a poor
[2:05:16] family
[2:05:18] defeated sinful but when God came he
[2:05:22] said no let me tell you let me tell
[2:05:24] you I will be with you and you are going
[2:05:28] to Smite the
[2:05:30] medion as one
[2:05:34] Manu one man in the hands of
[2:05:37] God can bring down the words of
[2:05:40] J one man one woman in the hands of God
[2:05:44] can shake
[2:05:46] all all hell brother you are bigger than
[2:05:50] you know
[2:05:51] s there is greatness in
[2:05:54] you actually in each of
[2:05:56] us but we can't see it unless we read
[2:06:00] God's
[2:06:01] word everything is in
[2:06:03] here if you can be able to get into
[2:06:05] God's
[2:06:06] word then we are going to see the
[2:06:09] testimony of God about
[2:06:12] us and I ask you not to listen to the
[2:06:17] testimony of of you about you from some
[2:06:21] some other
[2:06:27] source because that will mislead
[2:06:30] you but if you listen to the
[2:06:33] testimony of God about
[2:06:37] you you are going to live a triumphant
[2:06:42] life let us stand up on our feet I was
[2:06:45] still going but uh time is fast spent

[2:07:18] whether they can be able to do or
[2:07:20] accomplish anything for
[2:07:25] you but it's not about what we think
[2:07:27] about
[2:07:30] ourselves it's about what you have said
[2:07:32] about
[2:07:34] it and you said that there will be a
[2:07:38] bride a bride without spot without
[2:07:41] drink washed in the blood of our
