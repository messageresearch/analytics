[21:31] i want to tell you something about
[21:32] worship
[21:34] when you are worshiping
[21:37] you see
[21:38] let me ask you a question
[21:40] if i was to give you some money
[21:43] brother billy paul how much would you
[21:45] like me to give you five thousand or ten
[21:46] thousand
[21:51] how much brother
[21:54] come on up here
[21:56] if i was giving you money right now no
[21:58] no not money to sing just as a gift
[22:01] five thousand or ten thousand what would
[22:03] you choose
[22:07] okay this is not sincere
[22:10] rather how much
[22:16] do you know why
[22:17] [Music]
[22:19] do you know why
[22:20] because 10 000 is more than five
[22:24] so he wants me to to give him
[22:26] much he wants to receive much
[22:30] but many times when we give we don't
[22:32] want to give much
[22:34] we want to give the leader and then we
[22:36] remain with the match
[22:38] okay
[22:39] some of you have carried your offerings
[22:41] and that's good we shall give to the
[22:42] lord but do you think that's what he
[22:44] desires
[22:45] he desires our heart
[22:47] so right now we are giving to him
[22:50] this praise and worship is not for me
[22:52] he's not for the preacher is not for the
[22:55] world passerby is not for even anybody
[22:58] it is for the lord
[23:00] how god loves an extravagant worshiper
[23:04] someone who worships in spirit and in
[23:06] fruit
[23:07] number one number two when you worship
[23:09] you don't mind about your neighbor oh
[23:12] they will think i'm crazy or they will
[23:13] think i'm just over spiritual do it with
[23:16] all your heart
[23:18] hallelujah whether you are rich or poor
[23:20] whether you are young or old you dance
[23:23] no one
[23:24] where the spirit of god is there is
[23:27] freedom
[23:28] liberty amen so as long as you are in
[23:31] the house of the lord no one will touch
[23:33] your brother come on in the polypolya
[23:35] reduce the speed reduce the fire
[23:38] let your fire even go up
[23:41] as in praise to our god amen

[45:11] and we believe in the blood of jesus
[45:13] washing us from every sin
[45:15] and so uh
[45:17] by god disgrace i'm the pastor of this
[45:19] leader fellowship
[45:20] and uh
[45:22] so this morning you are not going to be
[45:24] hearing from myself
[45:25] but you'll be hearing from another
[45:27] minister in this church by the martin
[45:30] you will be ministering the word of god
[45:32] and so here we give uh time to the word
[45:35] of god because we believe that the word
[45:37] is what will transform us
[45:39] everything you know healing miracles
[45:41] signs wonders
[45:43] prosperity all those things are good but
[45:46] they do not transform your soul
[45:48] you see your soul just like your flesh
[45:50] needs food to eat like your flesh needs
[45:53] muguyo
[45:55] posho
[45:56] matoke and things like that chicken oh
[45:58] you cannot leave the chicken out brother
[46:00] and so so you know your flesh needs all
[46:02] those things to be able to to to grow
[46:05] in the same way your soul also needs the
[46:08] word of god to be able to grow and so
[46:10] here we give time to the word of god and
[46:13] actually most of the time in the
[46:14] fellowship we usually give it to the
[46:16] word of god and because we believe we
[46:19] surely need it to be able to be
[46:21] transformed into the image of jesus
[46:23] christ
[46:25] and so before we go into
[46:28] the changing of all of the service i
[46:30] just wanted to give
[46:31] the
[46:33] update
[46:34] regarding our
[46:36] land contribution fund
[46:38] i know that there are those who are
[46:39] continually
[46:41] uh
[46:42] being faithful in giving towards their
[46:45] their pledges
[46:48] and this sunday only about three brother
[46:51] sam
[46:52] brothers
[46:53] and brother sister grace
[46:56] and
[46:57] and
[46:58] sister kavatoro
[47:00] have been able to fulfill their pledges
[47:02] i think that is
[47:04] november
[47:05] but assam has fulfilled this november
[47:07] pledge
[47:08] since the grace greatest how november
[47:10] pledge
[47:12] for week one
[47:13] and then sister cavatoro
[47:16] had december pledge
[47:18] so we have now a total of
[47:21] 4.932 so we are almost hitting five
[47:24] millions
[47:26] amen
[47:27] and uh
[47:29] we are looking for 150 million
[47:31] to buy land for the cabinet
[47:34] that seems like ah you're still far but
[47:37] look two months ago we had it
[47:40] so if you hold your hands and say maybe
[47:43] let god come and help us
[47:45] he will not come
[47:47] he will not come but now we can say god
[47:49] is already helping us and we are
[47:51] progressing
[47:52] amen from 115 million we are all we are
[47:55] about to hit
[47:56] to knock the 5 million out and how many
[47:59] will be remaining the good mathematician
[48:02] 245
[48:03] so we are going we are moving forward
[48:06] and so
[48:07] some of you i know there are some that
[48:09] someone who was streaming the other day
[48:10] and wrote me and said we are praying for
[48:11] you for your church land so whoever that
[48:14] wants to contribute don't only pray
[48:16] don't only pray prayer is good and
[48:18] important it's prayer that is going to
[48:20] lead us through this
[48:22] but if you can give towards that
[48:25] noble cause that would be wonderful
[48:27] people when people die people are rushed
[48:30] to contribute they can even contribute
[48:33] in just one hour because of someone who
[48:35] is dead
[48:36] but in this case we are contributing for
[48:38] a
[48:39] even a better cause
[48:41] even a better cause
[48:43] because we are going we are actually
[48:45] also contributing for the
[48:47] those ones who die
[48:49] to the world and are alive in jesus
[48:52] christ to be able to meet in one place
[48:54] and glorify the living jesus christ amen
[48:58] so it's a noble cause god will bless you
[49:01] as you continue to
[49:03] fulfill your pledges
[49:06] so uh shall we
[49:08] [Music]
[49:10] sing one song
[49:14] as we give our offerings and take this
[49:16] and then after that
[49:18] our advice is that we need to sing a
[49:19] special song as the minister comes
[49:22] so for now let us done and then
[49:24] brother
[49:26] [Music]
[49:32] so let's pray for the those who are
[49:34] going to

[1:11:39] together my bible is affair
[1:11:42] yeah normally uh when we read when we
[1:11:45] are reading the word we stand but what's
[1:11:48] going on between me
[1:11:50] as a way of respecting the word of god
[1:11:57] because we know that when the earthly
[1:11:59] when the national anthem is sung
[1:12:02] in tijuana
[1:12:05] they also do stand as in respecting of
[1:12:08] the americans
[1:12:11] so how much more is the word of god
[1:12:19] let us turn to matthew 27
[1:12:25] we are reading from
[1:12:27] verses
[1:12:46] and
[1:12:56] from buses
[1:13:19] yeah you're reading matthew chapter 7
[1:13:25] yeah we're getting we are beginning from
[1:13:27] verse

[1:13:39] and when the morning and when the
[1:13:41] morning come all the chief priests and
[1:13:43] elders of the people took counsel
[1:13:45] against jesus to put him to death
[1:13:59] and when they had bound him they led him
[1:14:02] away and delivered him to pontius pilate
[1:14:13] then judah then judah's wish had
[1:14:16] betrayed him when he saw that he was
[1:14:19] condemned repented himself and brought
[1:14:22] again the 30 pieces of silver to the
[1:14:24] chief priests and elders
[1:14:26] how
[1:14:41] saying i have seen in that i have
[1:14:44] betrothed the innocent blood
[1:14:46] and they say
[1:14:48] what is that to us see
[1:14:50] thou to do that
[1:14:54] okay
[1:15:08] okay and he cast down the pieces of
[1:15:11] silva in the temple and departed and
[1:15:13] went and hanged himself

[1:16:01] then 27 says then the soldiers of the
[1:16:03] governor took jesus into a common hall
[1:16:06] and gathered unto him the whole band of
[1:16:09] soldiers and they striped him and put on
[1:16:12] him a scalloped rope and when they had
[1:16:15] when they had platted a crown of thorn
[1:16:18] and and put it upon his head and read
[1:16:22] and read in his right
[1:16:25] hand and they pulled their knees before
[1:16:27] him and mocked him saying before
[1:16:30] him and mocked him saying hail king of
[1:16:33] the jews and they spit upon him and took
[1:16:36] the reed and smudged him on the uh on

[2:34:53] everything was paid for
[2:34:56] sin
[2:35:26] when he tells us about to be baptized in
[2:35:28] jesus name we do the same we're talking
[2:35:30] about what's happening
[2:35:32] when it turns out to separate ourselves
[2:35:34] from the things of the world we do well
[2:35:36] between
[2:35:37] singapore
[2:35:53] highways
[2:35:55] not to wonder anymore
[2:35:58] but to live

[2:36:18] that day at calvary opened up the way
[2:36:21] for all those patriarchs
[2:36:30] sold for it
[2:36:32] sold for it but it gave it to you free
[2:36:34] uh
[2:36:48] the opening fade brings a man right back
[2:36:51] in the presence of god without seeing on
[2:36:53] him

[2:38:37] done but we are made perfect in the
[2:38:40] presence of god
[2:38:47] [Music]

[2:40:31] oh sorry jesus said just automatically
[2:40:34] something to you is no more than going

[2:40:41] if the next man first you think about
[2:40:44] him
[2:41:01] i mean

[2:41:23] like jesus christ
[2:41:28] now the river doesn't run up and down at
[2:41:30] the same time

[2:42:51] reason then amen there are no forces in
[2:42:55] hell that can violate the word of god
[2:42:58] praise be to god
[2:43:05] so we believe when the word is preached
[2:43:08] jesus is here to vindicate his word

[3:05:34] people don't even realize
[3:05:37] that they do not
[3:05:39] respect that enough
[3:05:42] to know that you came from glory and as
[3:05:44] the preacher said it wasn't just another
[3:05:47] person
[3:05:48] that came
[3:05:50] but it was the very person
[3:05:52] the god who created heaven and earth
[3:05:56] that great spirit the bible calls
[3:05:59] the spirit
[3:06:01] in the book of john chapter
[3:06:03] 4 verse 24
[3:06:05] god is a spirit jehovah god you came
[3:06:08] down and you condescended yourself in a
[3:06:11] form of a man
[3:06:12] you put on human flesh
[3:06:15] so that you can be able to die
[3:06:19] can't the world see that this was not
[3:06:21] just an angel
[3:06:23] this was not just another body or
[3:06:25] another little somebody this was the
[3:06:28] very god who had created heaven and
[3:06:31] earth
[3:06:32] the god who said let there be and there
[3:06:34] was was the same same god that came down
[3:06:40] in the form of human flesh and the bible
[3:06:42] tells me the book of john chapter one
[3:06:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[3:06:46] word was
[3:06:48] with god and the word was god
[3:06:50] and the word put on flesh and built
[3:06:53] among us you put on flesh so that you
[3:06:55] will be able to die
[3:06:56] on that cross
[3:06:57] you put on flesh so that you will be
[3:06:59] able to bleed on that cross amen so that
[3:07:02] when they pierce your side aim and blood
[3:07:04] and water will be able to bring forth
[3:07:06] your bride your
[3:07:08] church
[3:07:10] it is because of that cross
[3:07:13] amen like the wife of adam was taken out
[3:07:17] of his side
[3:07:18] by ripping his side open even your wife
[3:07:22] the church was taken out from your side
[3:07:25] when you were ripped on your side and
[3:07:27] the blood and water gushed out
[3:07:29] that has passed the church of jesus
[3:07:31] christ
[3:07:33] and today we are here because of that
[3:07:35] blood
[3:07:36] we are here because of that blood
[3:07:38] we can even sing and say oh the blood of
[3:07:41] jesus
[3:07:42] oh the blood of jesus for it washes away
[3:07:45] all our sins
[3:07:47] and makes us free and makes us happy
[3:07:50] and has identified us to who we are this
[3:07:53] this morning
[3:07:55] father we appreciate the blood we
[3:07:56] appreciate your sacrifice
[3:07:59] lord you you you humble the bible says
[3:08:01] you were in the form of god
[3:08:03] but you you you humbled yourself into a
[3:08:06] form of a man
[3:08:08] and you humbled yourself even to die on
[3:08:10] that cross
[3:08:13] you would have called all the host of
[3:08:15] angels
[3:08:16] to come and rescue you on that cross
[3:08:20] you would have simply said
[3:08:22] michael
[3:08:24] come and show them you would have called
[3:08:26] gabriel you would have called one of the
[3:08:28] great mighty angels
[3:08:30] but you did not
[3:08:32] you did not call them
[3:08:35] because you had a purpose to be on the
[3:08:37] cross
[3:08:38] you had a reason to be on the cross
[3:08:41] and i'm glad that i can say i am that
[3:08:44] reason for you to be on the cross
[3:08:48] no matter what the devil says there is a
[3:08:50] church triumphant
[3:08:52] a church of jesus christ going to go in
[3:08:54] the rapture
[3:08:55] she will not go in the tribulation
[3:08:57] because you have died and gone through
[3:08:58] the tribulation for her
[3:09:00] and i'm so glad to be identified with
[3:09:02] that church
[3:09:04] i'm so glad to be identified with that
[3:09:05] body of christ
[3:09:07] and my brothers and sisters here lord
[3:09:10] we just pray oh god that you will help
[3:09:12] us
[3:09:13] that we should identify ourselves with
[3:09:15] without blood

[3:17:31] [Music]
[3:17:32] i love jesus too much amen
[3:17:36] for all my family
[3:17:38] i stand as a born again
[3:17:42] but they're all catholic
[3:17:44] and protestant but i've changed my mind
[3:17:47] because when jesus is coming back he
[3:17:50] will take me
[3:17:51] but when they refuse to come back to
[3:17:53] jesus christ
[3:17:55] the son of god
[3:17:58] i know my grave
[3:17:59] is different from them
[3:18:01] my children grave is different from them
[3:18:05] even when i've got married they're all
[3:18:08] catholics but i know this message it
[3:18:11] will risk to them
[3:18:13] it's the first time
[3:18:15] for my sister doctors
[3:18:18] to give me the message when she went
[3:18:21] i know where she was staying she asked
[3:18:24] to reach me i know god was already
[3:18:27] prepared the way for me through her
[3:18:31] and my family so
[3:18:33] i want to be baptized again
[3:18:43] because the first baptism it was in
[3:18:46] catholic
[3:18:47] the second baptism
[3:18:49] i made it in
[3:18:52] a certain church which is called seven
[3:18:54] days adventists but i don't believe
[3:18:57] whether they have used the true name not
[3:18:59] a title on my name
[3:19:02] on my baptism and i want to
[3:19:05] re-baptize again
[3:19:07] in the name of jesus christ
[3:19:13] [Music]
[3:19:16] [Applause]
[3:19:21] the second thing i'm giving
[3:19:24] thanks to god
[3:19:26] [Music]
[3:19:27] to bringing doctors
[3:19:29] from the route where she was lost when
[3:19:31] she was born
[3:19:34] she has not known born again what is
[3:19:36] this
[3:19:37] but i've tried with my level best to
[3:19:39] bring her back
[3:19:41] home
[3:19:42] in the hand of jesus christ
[3:19:45] so good work
[3:19:47] through me and through monica
[3:19:50] and make dr stewart where she is
[3:19:53] i thank god for
[3:19:55] giving life of doctors an easy hand and
[3:19:59] make her a good
[3:20:01] girl
[3:20:02] because
[3:20:03] if
[3:20:04] we are working with her really people
[3:20:06] see what kind of a girl is dockers
[3:20:09] you cannot compare her with the ladies
[3:20:12] out there with the young girls walking
[3:20:14] around there
[3:20:16] i thank god for pastor
[3:20:18] may the lord protect you and your family
[3:20:22] may the hand of the lord
[3:20:26] really i'm very happy to continue
[3:20:28] keeping you and your family and they all
[3:20:30] church
[3:20:31] i know this is my church but i'm staying
[3:20:33] far you pray for me
[3:20:36] and my husband
[3:20:38] a lot is in training to go to somalia i
[3:20:42] want you to dedicate him in the hand of
[3:20:45] god pastor
[3:20:47] i love you all
[3:20:49] i love god i love jesus christ
[3:20:52] i love the children of god i like being
[3:20:54] born again
[3:20:57] i thank you
[3:21:01] praise the lord
[3:21:04] she
[3:21:05] was born again before her
[3:21:09] in the yeah before you
[3:21:12] and she was uh
[3:21:14] you know ready
[3:21:16] knowing jesus in another level
[3:21:19] but now
[3:21:20] she tried to show her the way with
[3:21:23] monique i'm told and now when she came
[3:21:26] again she passed
[3:21:28] and then when she passed now she's again
[3:21:31] going back and showing her by the way
[3:21:33] there is something missing here i know
[3:21:35] she's realizing hey
[3:21:40] we love the way god god the way god
[3:21:42] works is amazing
[3:21:44] amazing and you see if you love him
[3:21:46] he has to continue revealing
[3:21:49] himself to you you know if you love god
[3:21:52] without your heart it doesn't matter
[3:21:53] what you believe
[3:21:54] he reveals more of himself to you
[3:21:58] but the more you love him amen
[3:22:01] the bible speaks of one uh i think that
[3:22:03] he was a sister
[3:22:04] someone would remind i think she was
[3:22:07] a sister priscilla
[3:22:09] sister priscilla
[3:22:11] was with her husband
[3:22:13] um what was the name of her husband
[3:22:15] aquila and so they went somewhere and
[3:22:18] they found a preacher preaching in power
[3:22:20] and anointing and this man was full of
[3:22:23] revelation but he did not have the full
[3:22:26] message of the hour
[3:22:28] because he did not he knew jesus but he
[3:22:31] did not know him the way the priscilla
[3:22:33] and the pillar knew him
[3:22:35] he did not have the full revelation so
[3:22:37] priscilla and aquila told him
[3:22:39] and when he received it the bible says
[3:22:41] that they
[3:22:43] showed him the scriptures and were able
[3:22:45] to bring the word of the hour to him so
[3:22:48] i'm sure that maybe some of you who you
[3:22:50] could not jesus but you see
[3:22:52] at what level do you know him
[3:22:54] amen you may know him but you have to
[3:22:57] know him at the level of the day that
[3:23:00] you are living in and now we have known
[3:23:02] him and i want to sing the song as we go
[3:23:05] we have known him in his name
[3:23:08] in the power of his name we are the
[3:23:11] people of his name
[3:23:13] you know that
[3:23:14] you see others may know him as a friend
[3:23:16] as a hero as this as that
[3:23:18] as a
[3:23:20] uh
[3:23:21] one that gives them prosperity as one
[3:23:23] that gives them miracles signs and
[3:23:25] wonders as that oppressor is wonderful
[3:23:27] but you should know him in the power of
[3:23:30] his name
[3:23:32] and his name is the one that through his
[3:23:34] name we receive salvation of our souls
[3:23:37] that's why even in water baptism we
[3:23:40] baptized in his name the name of our
[3:23:42] lord and savior jesus christ the bible
[3:23:44] says there is no salvation in any other
[3:23:47] name
[3:23:48] if i had time i would preach another
[3:23:49] someone but i know you are tired you all
[3:23:51] want to go so let us just sing one song
[3:23:53] and if there is anyone with a question
[3:23:55] sister i don't know when you're ready
[3:23:57] for water baptism
[3:23:59] but uh we'll talk to you and we'll
[3:24:01] be able to have some time with you and
