[1:37:18] where is
[1:37:20] he ah right over here
[1:37:24] um there are many ways I can do this but
[1:37:26] because of time I'll just give a few
[1:37:30] comments uh brother success okay just
[1:37:33] come up uh let I think it's better be
[1:37:35] said by your
[1:37:37] mouth if you could be
[1:37:40] little can you give him a
[1:37:43] microphone you will need to interpret
[1:37:45] him anyway so you have another
[1:37:47] microphone
[1:37:52] brother um I just have a question maybe
[1:37:55] uh if you can come over this
[1:37:57] side where you a minister come stand
[1:38:00] over here with
[1:38:01] me amen and
[1:38:04] so uh brother success told me was giving
[1:38:07] me the testimony on how he got to know
[1:38:09] about
[1:38:14] us I got my contact and all that just
[1:38:18] that part can you tell the
[1:38:20] people praise the
[1:38:22] Lord I'm grateful that I'm
[1:38:25] here um it so happened that last year in
[1:38:33] October I was from my field
[1:38:38] work so I branched over to a certain old
[1:38:41] man who has been in the message all
[1:38:43] along
[1:38:47] Ina so when I entered in his home I got
[1:38:50] some small box
[1:38:55] the box contain those MERS the message
[1:39:02] players so I asked him where can I get
[1:39:04] this message
[1:39:09] player he had no clue where we can get
[1:39:13] it he said he was also
[1:39:16] given and then I looked around on the
[1:39:18] box I found some
[1:39:21] contact and then I had to call that
[1:39:24] number it went
[1:39:27] through then I began to talk to that
[1:39:30] person that person came to be known as
[1:39:35] Pastor the rest is
[1:39:39] history bless you well like you said
[1:39:42] there's much we can
[1:39:44] say uh but brother success has been in
[1:39:48] touch
[1:39:50] since and he came in our
[1:39:53] Camp last this year in
[1:39:58] January I think it's been two years
[1:40:00] since you came to the
[1:40:02] message yeah so he was a minister in
[1:40:06] Christ
[1:40:08] Embassy Embassy uh but he was he was
[1:40:12] eventually
[1:40:14] baptized I think by some brothers in in
[1:40:18] nebe and uh brother sucess I love him
[1:40:22] for his Zeal and his love love to know
[1:40:24] more to get deeper into the
[1:40:30] word some time back I traveled with
[1:40:32] Pastor Robert kabasi to uh
[1:40:38] nebi and we was going to distribute a
[1:40:41] bunch of message players that our
[1:40:44] brother had purchased through
[1:40:47] us to the pastors there so we met like
[1:40:52] all the pastors most of the Pastors in
[1:40:53] West
[1:40:56] n and so uh we we gave them those some
[1:40:59] of you know who have been part of this
[1:41:01] ministry you know how you know the
[1:41:02] vision of the message player came
[1:41:08] about some years
[1:41:11] ago how you know I um felt that people
[1:41:14] should listen to the message of brother
[1:41:16] bam
[1:41:19] directly and so I took a piece of paper
[1:41:22] and Drew
[1:41:24] like what was what came to me as a
[1:41:28] revelation and little player with the
[1:41:33] buttons with
[1:41:35] numbers that you have an index and then
[1:41:38] you just you can just press that number
[1:41:39] and then a message will
[1:41:42] come and so all the messages of the
[1:41:44] Prophet are on that
[1:41:47] player but I did not know how I was
[1:41:49] going to realize that that dream that
[1:41:51] vision
[1:41:54] shortly after that I found myself in
[1:41:56] China long story
[1:41:59] short and I shared this bden with a
[1:42:01] brother
[1:42:03] there and uh he took me in a few
[1:42:06] factories because I thought this is
[1:42:07] something they needed to
[1:42:11] fabricate in the city called
[1:42:14] shenzen after seeing a few factories
[1:42:17] they had big players like big as Bible
[1:42:20] and I said no this is Buy
[1:42:29] so I felt that is not what I
[1:42:32] needed so I went back in we went back to
[1:42:35] the brother's
[1:42:36] office and as we were seated there just
[1:42:41] put my arms like
[1:42:43] this and thinking
[1:42:46] meditating and then a brother comes with
[1:42:49] this exact message player
[1:42:54] the one I had
[1:42:55] drawn was on the paper the brother
[1:42:59] brought it and put aside this
[1:43:02] one this is another brother who did not
[1:43:04] know
[1:43:06] English his name I think is brother L
[1:43:09] and so he came and put it there it was
[1:43:12] 100% perfectly
[1:43:17] identical I stood up it you know took it
[1:43:21] in my hands I tried to speak to the
[1:43:24] brother but he couldn't answer me
[1:43:25] because he did not know English and
[1:43:28] later on the other brother
[1:43:29] interpreted and told me that he also had
[1:43:32] a burden and for a while they have been
[1:43:34] using that same player in
[1:43:40] China you know God is amazing
[1:43:43] friends and you know that message player
[1:43:45] has helped very many by thousands in our
[1:43:52] country especially in Co when people
[1:43:54] couldn't go to
[1:43:56] church stay at home and just switch on
[1:43:59] very easy
[1:44:01] andise God so um I'm happy that at least
[1:44:05] through that we can be able to meet our
[1:44:06] brother
[1:44:09] success um he he has he has a burden for
[1:44:13] the message he just told me I would like
[1:44:15] you to uh your ministry to Mentor me
[1:44:17] into the ministry
[1:44:23] and so we've been in touch for a
[1:44:25] while and we hope that the Lord can use
[1:44:28] us to help him and the people there in
[1:44:30] nebe in a little way that we can be able
[1:44:36] to
[1:44:38] am amen amen praise the Lord amen I just
[1:44:42] thought I I I was thinking debating in
[1:44:45] myself should I say this today or should
[1:44:46] I
[1:44:50] not but I think I should say it because
[1:44:53] I want you to
[1:44:55] pray uh we are led by God's
[1:44:59] grace to start a fellowship
[1:45:03] in and um seeing how many people we've
[1:45:08] baptized so far
[1:45:10] there many of whom have not even been
[1:45:12] able to make it to church this
[1:45:15] morning because of Transport for someone
[1:45:18] to travel all the way there it has they
[1:45:20] have to pay 20,000 to go and come
[1:45:25] all those from here they that's what
[1:45:27] they're
[1:45:29] paying so we we
[1:45:32] went uh by faith and moved
[1:45:36] around and were able to find a
[1:45:40] place um so uh this is a a
[1:45:46] hall it's a hall the place is aall
[1:45:57] [Music]

[1:52:53] amen tell your neighbor the king is
[1:52:58] searching tell the neighbor on the other
[1:53:00] side the king is
[1:53:02] searching
[1:53:04] amen so last
[1:53:07] Sunday I spoke on subject of the Lamb's
[1:53:15] wife that the lamb is the same as the
[1:53:19] king is the king of kings he's the Lord
[1:53:23] of
[1:53:23] lords amen sister phib I'm happy to see
[1:53:26] you God bless
[1:53:27] you and and so he is searching for a a
[1:53:32] wife I believe that I'm the I'm the
[1:53:36] wife of the king I Am The Virtuous
[1:53:40] wife of the king do I have someone who
[1:53:43] can say I am The Virtuous
[1:53:46] wife the king amen among all the women
[1:53:51] he saw me he loved me he chose me amen
[1:53:55] and I'm his wife amen the church is
[1:53:59] always typed as a
[1:54:03] woman and Christ is always typed as the
[1:54:06] husband of the
[1:54:09] church so you see we are the wife
[1:54:13] ofr but there are many who claim to
[1:54:17] be you see before I announced my wife
[1:54:22] many who claimed that I loved
[1:54:26] them or maybe they
[1:54:29] presumed that I loved them you see all
[1:54:32] these young men who are not yet into
[1:54:35] that there are many young ladies who are
[1:54:40] expect maybe that brother but you see
[1:54:43] yours is to
[1:54:45] wait amen the the
[1:54:50] ours we cannot claim him
[1:54:56] he is the only one that can claim
[1:54:59] us amen and we have many churches
[1:55:03] today which claim their misses Jesus
[1:55:08] Christ which claim their followers of
[1:55:12] Jesus they claim but does he claim
[1:55:15] them the Bible says many shall come unto
[1:55:18] me on that
[1:55:20] day and they will say unto me Lord
[1:55:23] Lord didn't we do many great things in
[1:55:26] your
[1:55:26] name s and wonders in your
[1:55:29] name but I will say unto them go away
[1:55:33] from me doers of
[1:55:36] iniquity I
[1:55:39] never I
[1:55:41] never I never knew
[1:55:43] you so he they claimed we know
[1:55:47] you but he claimed I don't know
[1:55:50] you and I believe
[1:55:52] is the same thing
[1:55:55] today there are many who claim to know
[1:55:58] Jesus but Jesus does not know
[1:56:01] them they claim to follow the
[1:56:04] word but the word has rejected them so
[1:56:08] the King
[1:56:10] Jesus is searching for a wife he's not
[1:56:13] going to marry
[1:56:15] everything he going to marry someone who
[1:56:18] is
[1:56:20] virtuous he's looking for a specific
[1:56:24] wife oh when I was
[1:56:29] looking but when I was
[1:56:32] looking amen I was looking for someone
[1:56:37] specific someone specific with specific
[1:56:43] characteristics you know I heard things
[1:56:46] that you could not
[1:56:49] replace let me first remove my cat so I
[1:56:52] can can preach properly if you don't
[1:56:54] mind praise the
[1:56:56] Lord
[1:56:58] hallelujah
[1:57:00] amen I like being free you know I can't
[1:57:03] dress properly and then when the speed
[1:57:05] comes I just feel like let me throw away
[1:57:06] all
[1:57:08] this are you free this
[1:57:10] morning Hallelujah you know I was
[1:57:14] specific in what I
[1:57:16] wanted I needed
[1:57:19] something that was exactly that was on
[1:57:22] my
[1:57:24] heart I could not replace it with
[1:57:27] anything
[1:57:28] else I could not compromise on
[1:57:31] it because I had a future that I
[1:57:36] wanted I had something that I desire to
[1:57:41] have and I knew it would it would come
[1:57:43] it would be because of the type of
[1:57:45] person I
[1:57:48] chose and so then I chose
[1:57:52] a woman of
[1:57:54] virtue I chose a woman that had some
[1:57:59] characters that were depicting what I
[1:58:03] believe characters that were the kind of
[1:58:08] characters I also
[1:58:10] heard let me say right here
[1:58:13] Brethren a drunker will always choose a
[1:58:17] drunk an immortal person will always
[1:58:20] choose an immortal person
[1:58:22] a bad person will always choose a bad
[1:58:25] person sheep will always choose
[1:58:27] sheep and God will always choose God you
[1:58:31] see you cannot choose something else
[1:58:33] that you are
[1:58:34] not you understand what I'm saying you
[1:58:37] know you've had many people say those of
[1:58:38] you who are married say my wife is
[1:58:41] bad well she's bad because you are
[1:58:45] bad you cannot be good and you choose a
[1:58:47] bad
[1:58:49] wife you can only choose something that
[1:58:51] you reflect yourself
[1:58:54] in are you hearing me church amen the
[1:58:57] wife your wife is a representation of
[1:59:01] you if you claim to be a God-fearing
[1:59:05] man your wife will be a God fearing
[1:59:09] woman if you claim to be
[1:59:12] prayerful your wife will be
[1:59:14] prayerful why because when you are
[1:59:17] choosing you cannot look for something
[1:59:20] beyond what you have what you
[1:59:24] are when you are choosing your eyes will
[1:59:27] only see who you
[1:59:29] are your wife will be
[1:59:33] you in the same way when King Jesus is
[1:59:37] looking for a wife he can never look for
[1:59:40] something that does not reflect
[1:59:44] him amen Jesus is looking for
[1:59:48] someone for a church without sport
[1:59:52] without wrinkle a church that looks
[1:59:55] exactly like
[1:59:59] him but today we are going to take it
[2:00:01] and and make a foundation out of the
[2:00:03] Book of
[2:00:05] Esther because um you know the Book of
[2:00:09] Esther there are some books that are in
[2:00:11] this
[2:00:13] Bible that without the revelation of
[2:00:15] this
[2:00:17] message it will be hard for you to
[2:00:19] understand
[2:00:20] them for example the Book of
[2:00:24] Esther The Book of
[2:00:27] Ruth I preached on it before the book of
[2:00:30] Song of
[2:00:31] Solomon some people even fear to read
[2:00:33] Song of
[2:00:34] Solomon because they feel those are
[2:00:38] words those are very spiritual
[2:00:41] words and they are addressed by the king
[2:00:44] to his
[2:00:46] Queen they addressed from Christ to his
[2:00:49] bride you know let me tell you friends
[2:00:53] you see the relationship of Jesus and
[2:00:55] his
[2:00:57] church is a love
[2:01:00] affair is a love affair it's a
[2:01:06] relationship praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:09] and so I want us to go in the Book of
[2:01:11] Esther and be able to type all this uh
[2:01:14] we we beginning with that
[2:01:18] Foundation praise the name of the Lord
[2:01:21] and so here was a king
[2:01:25] Kingus and um I'll not give the whole
[2:01:28] background as I did on Sunday but I'm
[2:01:29] going to show you here he sat on his
[2:01:31] throne in the of his
[2:01:34] kingdom in a place called
[2:01:38] suan and in the third year of his
[2:01:41] Reign he made a feast for the
[2:01:44] Nobles this Feast continued for six
[2:01:49] months which is a total of 80
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:54] days and after 6
[2:01:56] months he made a fe to all the
[2:02:00] people of the
[2:02:03] Kingdom for seven days and he gave them
[2:02:07] to
[2:02:08] drink Royal
[2:02:11] Wine tell your neighbor Royal
[2:02:14] Wine praise the name of the Lord amen I
[2:02:18] hope that this morning someone can drink
[2:02:19] from that Royal wine
[2:02:23] and this Royal wine was drunk in vesses
[2:02:25] of
[2:02:29] gold the queen
[2:02:31] also she made a feast for the
[2:02:34] women you know this is from vers
[2:02:37] s let me read it maybe you you can just
[2:02:41] listen to it if you read luganda read in
[2:02:43] your Bible and they gave them drink in
[2:02:45] vessels of gold the vessels being
[2:02:47] diverse one from another and Royal Wine
[2:02:49] in abundance according to the state of
[2:02:52] the king and the drinking was according
[2:02:54] to the law none did
[2:02:57] compel for so the king had appointed to
[2:03:00] all the officers of his house that they
[2:03:02] should do according to Every Man's
[2:03:04] pleasure also V the queen made a visit
[2:03:07] for the women in the Royal house which
[2:03:09] belonged to King aeras on the seventh
[2:03:11] day when the king of the when the heart
[2:03:14] of the King was Marry with wine he
[2:03:17] commanded Mechman B habon Biga and abaga
[2:03:21] Z and carcass the seven Chamberlin that
[2:03:25] served in the presence of aeras the king
[2:03:27] to bring V to the queen before the king
[2:03:31] with the Crown Royal to show the people
[2:03:33] and the princess her beauty for she was
[2:03:37] fair to look on but the queen V refused
[2:03:41] to come at the king's commandment by his
[2:03:43] chamber lines therefore was the king
[2:03:46] very WTH and his anger band in him so
[2:03:48] you see when the king made a F
[2:03:53] the queen also made a
[2:03:57] fist and she made also a fist with our
[2:04:01] people and with the women and they said
[2:04:05] okay let's make a feist for
[2:04:07] ourselves because I'm the I'm the crown
[2:04:11] I'm the crown queen I'm the
[2:04:14] queen and so I have the crown the Royal
[2:04:17] crown on
[2:04:18] me I'm
[2:04:20] beautiful the king loves me I know he
[2:04:24] already married
[2:04:25] me he cannot chase me
[2:04:28] away because I am his
[2:04:31] wife so let me do what I want I am in
[2:04:35] his
[2:04:36] Palace but let me do what I want because
[2:04:39] I'm the
[2:04:40] queen now in the
[2:04:42] Bible the things I'm going to say
[2:04:45] today it's not so much of preaching it's
[2:04:47] a little
[2:04:48] teaching and I want you to be attentive
[2:04:51] and listen
[2:04:52] if you read in the Book of Romans
[2:04:54] chapter
[2:04:56] 11 the Bible speaks about the Jews and
[2:04:59] the
[2:05:01] Gentiles and the Bible says you know the
[2:05:04] Jews were the original
[2:05:10] branch on Christ and they were cut off
[2:05:15] you know the reason why because of
[2:05:18] unbelief they refus to believe the
[2:05:21] gospel
[2:05:23] Christ came among them the Bible says he
[2:05:26] came among his
[2:05:27] own but his own received him
[2:05:31] nor so you see they kicked him
[2:05:34] away theyed and rejected
[2:05:37] him and when that happened you know the
[2:05:41] Bible says they were cut
[2:05:43] off amen but you see Christ cannot stay
[2:05:47] without
[2:05:49] branches he has to be full
[2:05:52] Christ cannot stay without a
[2:05:55] wife he must have a
[2:05:58] bride and so when he cut them off the
[2:06:02] Bible says he went in the
[2:06:05] forest in the wild and he picked another
[2:06:09] Branch out of the tree of the
[2:06:13] wild and hefted
[2:06:16] it Hallelujah do you know who that is
[2:06:20] that is the G
[2:06:22] church that is us until today the Jewish
[2:06:28] people do not believe
[2:06:30] Jesus they are
[2:06:32] blinded but the Bible says they were
[2:06:34] blinded for our
[2:06:37] sake amen their blindness is our
[2:06:43] blessing when they rejected
[2:06:45] Christ what did Christ do he rejected
[2:06:49] them and then what did he do he went and
[2:06:52] got another one and we are the one that
[2:06:55] now is
[2:06:58] virtuous we are now precious in His
[2:07:02] sight we are now precious in His
[2:07:05] sight you know when you read the book of
[2:07:07] Song of
[2:07:09] Solomon you will understand how precious
[2:07:12] we
[2:07:13] are the words that he flourishes on us
[2:07:17] he says my loved
[2:07:18] one oh you have d's eyes oh you are
[2:07:22] beautiful oh you are virtuous and many
[2:07:25] lovely words this is how Jesus sees
[2:07:29] me not because of what I have
[2:07:33] done not because of what I will
[2:07:37] do but listen because of his choosing of
[2:07:43] me do you know how Jesus expresses his
[2:07:46] love to his
[2:07:49] church how does he Express his love not
[2:07:53] by doing good things for
[2:07:55] you he will do the good things but that
[2:07:58] is not how Jesus expresses his
[2:08:02] love he expresses his
[2:08:05] love by choosing he or she that he
[2:08:10] loves many times you may even ask for
[2:08:13] good
[2:08:14] things he may or he may not give it to
[2:08:18] you but how do you know he loves you
[2:08:21] because he chose you in him before the
[2:08:25] foundation of the
[2:08:28] world the pcal they
[2:08:31] say that if you you are you are
[2:08:34] prospered it means God has favored you
[2:08:36] and he has loved
[2:08:38] you and if you are poor it means you are
[2:08:42] cast but we have other Prophet who has
[2:08:45] come and he said
[2:08:48] riches do not mean you are blessed
[2:08:51] you can have riches and still
[2:08:55] cast but you know even
[2:08:59] poverty does not mean you are
[2:09:02] cast you can be poor now but be rich
[2:09:06] tomorrow you see the Cloudy
[2:09:10] Skies you know the Cloudy Skies the
[2:09:12] heavy
[2:09:13] Skies bad
[2:09:15] life does not mean that God has cured
[2:09:19] you someone can
[2:09:23] someone can say what did I
[2:09:25] do things are not
[2:09:27] moving
[2:09:31] for and they go to some of these
[2:09:33] Deliverance
[2:09:34] pastors and they the way I see you have
[2:09:37] a
[2:09:38] cur and they they break the Cur they go
[2:09:41] to another church they break the Cur
[2:09:43] they go to another church and that cast
[2:09:45] will never be
[2:09:47] broken and indeed it can never be
[2:09:49] broken but let me tell what breaks the
[2:09:52] cast is by by receiving The Blessing of
[2:09:58] Abraham let me tell you Brothers Abraham
[2:10:01] was a blessed
[2:10:03] man and no one could C
[2:10:07] him and all his children can never be
[2:10:12] cast because his Blessing was from
[2:10:16] generation to generation to generation
[2:10:20] and who are we today
[2:10:22] who are we today we are the amen sons of
[2:10:26] Abraham amen by
[2:10:29] Faith by faith we are in the same
[2:10:32] lineage can I say we are
[2:10:36] blessed can I say I am
[2:10:38] blessed whether life is good or
[2:10:41] bad I am blessed and because I am
[2:10:45] blessed life must become
[2:10:49] good praise name of the
[2:10:52] Lord hallelujah and so we notic that
[2:10:56] Israel because they rejected
[2:10:59] Christ they were cut off and Christ came
[2:11:03] among the
[2:11:04] Gentiles and now the Gentiles are
[2:11:07] enjoying the blessings of the
[2:11:11] word and whenever wherever the word
[2:11:14] goes a blessings a blessing follows
[2:11:18] it wherever the word is received
[2:11:22] a blessing follows that
[2:11:25] place praise the name of the Lord and so
[2:11:28] friends we see
[2:11:30] here that Esther is a type of the Bride
[2:11:34] the Gentile
[2:11:39] bride we get into that now we see
[2:11:42] here King King AAS called for a
[2:11:47] visit King Jesus today
[2:11:51] has also called for a
[2:11:56] f and they gave them
[2:11:59] wine they
[2:12:00] drunk they
[2:12:02] drunk and everybody became
[2:12:05] drunk and they became very
[2:12:07] happy and the King was also very
[2:12:10] happy and when the king is Happy the
[2:12:14] first thing that came in his
[2:12:16] mind was I want to display the beauty of
[2:12:19] my queen
[2:12:23] and wine symbolizes stimulation of
[2:12:31] Revelation I like to run all over the
[2:12:33] place one I don't I don't I didn't wake
[2:12:36] up up in the neighborhood when the Lord
[2:12:38] showed me
[2:12:42] that stimulation of
[2:12:45] Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is
[2:12:48] associated together
[2:12:54] always in the Bible I got that in
[2:12:57] concerence
[2:12:59] here there is a starring of
[2:13:03] them where wine and oil goes
[2:13:08] together all the time when the truth of
[2:13:12] a promised word of God has been truly
[2:13:15] revealed
[2:13:21] when it is revealed to his
[2:13:24] Saints amen the saints that are filled
[2:13:27] with
[2:13:28] oil they will all get
[2:13:33] stimulated wine is a
[2:13:37] stimulation Hallelujah stimulated with
[2:13:43] joy stimulated with
[2:13:46] shouts and when it does it has listen it
[2:13:50] has the same effect upon them that wine
[2:13:54] does upon a natural
[2:14:07] man now when you drink wine or
[2:14:13] alcohol you become
[2:14:15] stimulated you become
[2:14:18] happy have you ever seen a drunk man a
[2:14:20] drunk
[2:14:23] oh have you ever been a
[2:14:25] drunkard now you know how a drunkard
[2:14:29] is when you drunker a drunker doesn't
[2:14:32] have an
[2:14:35] enemy a drun has no
[2:14:39] bitterness alcohol takes everything
[2:14:43] away are you following me there's
[2:14:46] something I want to show
[2:14:48] you a drunkard is happy
[2:14:52] even when they were sad and
[2:14:55] depressed they take
[2:14:58] alcohol and then they begin to feel
[2:15:00] happy and they begin
[2:15:03] singing you see drunkards have their own
[2:15:07] song you can't sing it unless you are
[2:15:10] also
[2:15:13] drunk when you begin singing
[2:15:16] it without being
[2:15:18] drunk they will wonder what's wrong with
[2:15:21] with you but when you are drunk like
[2:15:24] themen you will sing the song you will
[2:15:28] have joy in your
[2:15:29] heart but you see the normal
[2:15:33] alcohol soon wees
[2:15:35] off and then you have
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:40] hangover and that's why Believers don't
[2:15:45] drink tell your neighbor that's why
[2:15:47] Believers we don't drink
[2:15:51] because that kind of alcohol wears
[2:15:53] off we want the kind that does not wear
[2:15:58] off
[2:15:59] hallelujah amen that will give us the
[2:16:02] same
[2:16:05] effect like a
[2:16:07] drunkard but this effect will never go
[2:16:11] away amen and he said what is that it
[2:16:16] says
[2:16:17] wine is talking about revelation
[2:16:21] you see the stimulation of
[2:16:25] Revelation let me tell you brother when
[2:16:27] the word of God is revealed to
[2:16:29] you when you have seen one
[2:16:33] God baptism in Jesus
[2:16:35] name Holiness when you've seen all these
[2:16:39] teachings in the Bible seven Church
[2:16:43] ages the order in the
[2:16:47] church you will see the confusion that
[2:16:49] other denominations are in
[2:16:54] and you you'll wonder how God loved
[2:16:57] you to give you that
[2:17:01] Revelation and it will excite you that's
[2:17:05] why when we hear the word we cannot be
[2:17:08] Idol as a dead
[2:17:11] log if you are like that it means you
[2:17:14] have no
[2:17:16] Revelation when the preacher is
[2:17:18] preaching you are hearing what he is
[2:17:20] saying
[2:17:22] but a person with
[2:17:24] Revelation he has more than what the
[2:17:27] preacher is
[2:17:28] saying when the preacher is
[2:17:31] preaching Revelation began begins to
[2:17:33] stimulate
[2:17:35] you more Revelation revelation after
[2:17:38] Revelation
[2:17:40] striking amen when I talk about the wife
[2:17:43] of
[2:17:46] jesusall someone say what's wrong with
[2:17:48] that person the preacher simply say say

[2:17:54] person has had something else you are
[2:17:58] the wife of
[2:18:01] Jesus oh thank you Jesus

[2:36:27] system who answered their
[2:36:30] histor Luther who was a Catholic
[2:36:35] priest are you still here Church Luther
[2:36:39] was a Catholic
[2:36:40] priest but when God sent
[2:36:43] him he rebelled against his
[2:36:46] church he said this church has gone away
[2:36:50] from the principles of the

[2:37:25] that
[2:37:26] [Music]
[2:37:28] level whereby we become a reel to
[2:37:30] everything but the
[2:37:35] word then there's a
[2:37:38] problem you
[2:37:43] church is the one that God used to begin
[2:37:46] and Kickstart the Reformation the
[2:37:47] Protestant movement
[2:37:53] he became a
[2:37:55] rebel let me become a rebel to the to
[2:37:58] the ordinances of

[2:38:05] God hallelujah amen what is your

[2:38:22] there find the one of Paul mine is right
[2:38:26] there I know I believe what they
[2:38:29] believe I preach why they pre I live
[2:38:33] what they
[2:38:35] lived and you see Luther was also a man
[2:38:39] sent by God with the same thing William
[2:38:42] R same thing they were not bowing to any
[2:38:46] system of
[2:38:48] mind William Bram had a very big
[2:38:52] anointing many churches begged
[2:38:56] him come and join us they say you know
[2:39:00] why they wanted him to help them make
[2:39:06] money he refused he said I have to be
[2:39:10] faithful to my
[2:39:12] calling messenger that was sent to the
[2:39:15] church
[2:39:16] agents was not corrupt
[2:39:21] imagine
[2:39:23] saying
[2:39:27] here and you tell the king that I'm
[2:39:34] coming big would speak with
[2:39:38] others big would
[2:39:41] speak what the other ones
[2:39:44] have every chamberline was saying the
[2:39:47] same thing
[2:39:49] you see all these Church
[2:39:51] Messengers they all say the same
[2:39:55] thing not
[2:39:57] different and the Bible says in the book
[2:39:59] of Isaiah
[2:40:01] 4:1 and in the day in that day seven
[2:40:04] women shall take hold of one
[2:40:09] man and we they will say we will eat our
[2:40:13] bread and we will wear our own
[2:40:17] apparel only let us be called by thy
[2:40:23] name to take away our
[2:40:25] reproach imagine find Days Of The Voice
[2:40:29] Fellowship what we
[2:40:32] believe what we do what we stand for is
[2:40:37] against the
[2:40:38] Bible but we are claiming to be
[2:40:42] Christians that's where the church has
[2:40:45] reached and in the last days seven women
[2:40:50] they will hold on to one
[2:40:53] man but they will not allow him to
[2:40:56] provide

[2:41:27] thing gives a story he says I got a
[2:41:31] clipping at home out of a
[2:41:36] newspaper you read it yourselves it said
[2:41:39] what's happened to the morals of our
[2:41:41] American
[2:41:42] [Music]
[2:41:44] women two out of every three soldiers
[2:41:47] was divorced by their wife wives that
[2:41:50] went overseas in the first six
[2:41:56] months two out of three was
[2:42:00] divorced these women just took off and
[2:42:03] ran
[2:42:05] out why is it if you understand friends
[2:42:09] it's the spirit of the
[2:42:13] time we have got to get in the spirit of
[2:42:16] the last days when the last days are
[2:42:18] here
[2:42:29] yes Friends when the times have
[2:42:34] come the times will enter the spirit of
[2:42:37] the end time and he says if you go to a
[2:42:39] dance
[2:42:42] hall hey you have to get in the spirit
[2:42:45] of dancing
[2:42:49] oh you want
[2:42:52] dance I've never been in a dance
[2:42:55] hall apart from
[2:42:57] church it's a very good church is a very
[2:43:00] good Dance
[2:43:02] Forever that's why you don't judge me
[2:43:04] when I dance in
[2:43:07] church because this is my dance
[2:43:10] hall amen but you see Church those who
[2:43:14] go to those dance halls he says they
[2:43:17] can't dance
[2:43:19] until they have to enter the spirit of
[2:43:21] the
[2:43:23] hall that's why to enter that Spirit
[2:43:27] they have to drink a
[2:43:29] little or they have to
[2:43:31] smoke or they have to get
[2:43:34] weed and they not really
[2:43:39] normal then they go
[2:43:41] there yeah
[2:43:45] man and then they put the music
[2:43:49] and they just there like
[2:43:51] zombies they begin
[2:43:54] dancing literally hell on
[2:43:57] [Music]
[2:43:58] Earth I am so glad Jesus redeemed me
[2:44:02] from
[2:44:03] that I am so glad Hallelujah I am one of
[2:44:07] those that are out of
[2:44:09] mess
[2:44:11] Hallelujah and he says if you go to the
[2:44:14] church you have to get into the spirit
[2:44:17] of worship
[2:44:20] before you cannot
[2:44:24] worship that's why when we come here you
[2:44:28] have to come here
[2:44:30] relaxed some of you are here you are not
[2:44:34] here that's why it is so hard sometimes
[2:44:36] for pastors to
[2:44:40] preach the pastor is
[2:44:43] rushing he spent the whole week
[2:44:48] preparing for you to hear from
[2:44:51] God and when you all now come many of
[2:44:55] you are not in the spirit of
[2:44:59] church even before the pastor begins
[2:45:02] preaching you are looking on your
[2:45:05] clock what time what
[2:45:09] time late it's late it's late if you
[2:45:12] want to hear from God if you come to
[2:45:15] church come to church
[2:45:20] remove all other
[2:45:24] programs imagine a person going to the
[2:45:28] dance he doesn't want even the phone he
[2:45:33] removes he he has already even taken his
[2:45:37] weed he doesn't want to be
[2:45:41] bothered he's just there the whole
[2:45:46] night and then he's drinking
[2:45:49] and then finally
[2:45:50] Falls you find them in the
[2:46:02] [Music]
[2:46:04] morning others they L drag them at home
[2:46:08] and then they would sleep the whole day
[2:46:10] why they were in the spirit of the
[2:46:13] dance
[2:46:15] Christians where are you wake up
[2:46:21] get before you come to church get into
[2:46:24] the spirit of church
[2:46:29] yes you listen you cannot make another
[2:46:33] program on Sunday no
[2:46:38] no if you have another
[2:46:42] appointment tell them I can't
[2:46:45] promise I'm going to church and they
[2:46:49] would ask you when will you come back
[2:46:51] whenever we are done with
[2:46:54] church but some of you Hallelujah you
[2:46:58] say come at
[2:47:00] one and when it
[2:47:03] one the word is going
[2:47:05] on Pastor finish Pastor finish
[2:47:09] Pastor if you are like that you can
[2:47:11] never receive anything from
[2:47:13] God and then when the p is about to
[2:47:16] finish you are very happy one
[2:47:22] quot
[2:47:24] already if you're off go
[2:47:27] away we want people who are in the
[2:47:30] spirit of the
[2:47:32] thing let me tell you we may be 50 or
[2:47:36] 100 or 20 as long as we are all in the
[2:47:40] spirit of
[2:47:42] the god is bound to visit
[2:47:45] us Miracles are bound to happen
[2:47:47] Hallelujah
[2:47:49] amen you have to enter the spirit of
[2:47:52] worship close yourself away from the
[2:47:58] world the world has to get in the spirit
[2:48:01] of the last
[2:48:04] days and that means the last days are
[2:48:07] here God has promised that these things
[2:48:09] would be
[2:48:12] here men and women are asleep and they
[2:48:14] don't realize
[2:48:17] it and you know he says it will continue
[2:48:19] to get worse and
[2:48:24] worse listen
[2:48:26] Church divorces will continue to
[2:48:30] happen
[2:48:34] yes it did not used to be this
[2:48:37] way I can authoritatively
[2:48:41] say 90% of all of you all of
[2:48:45] us are coming from broken homes
[2:48:51] even if our parents are living
[2:48:53] together they not
[2:48:55] happy they separated a long time
[2:48:59] ago others are bewitching each
[2:49:01] other others got other people in in
[2:49:04] their
[2:49:04] relationship others divorced others
[2:49:08] separated why it is the spirit of the
[2:49:13] age and the prophet said it will
[2:49:16] continue to get worse and worse
[2:49:21] Dives will continue to
[2:49:23] happen you see men these
[2:49:26] days boys are becoming
[2:49:32] girls no wonder they don't even want to
[2:49:35] work they are very
[2:49:37] lazy so in other words you have SS for
[2:49:42] men it used to be that a man would think
[2:49:49] this preach it now now this is the thing
[2:49:51] now you see listen to me Church men
[2:49:54] would
[2:49:56] think men would
[2:49:58] plan and men would make money men would
[2:50:02] take charge of their
[2:50:04] homes list men would protect their
[2:50:08] women take care of them stand through
[2:50:12] with them through
[2:50:14] sick but these days men are so weak
[2:50:19] until women are becoming
[2:50:23] men why do you think why do
[2:50:30] you single mothers are too many today
[2:50:33] why because
[2:50:39] men something something happen because
[2:50:43] the woman wants you to provide for
[2:50:46] her you're too fearful even for
[2:50:50] responsibility immediately you take
[2:50:53] off and you leave the mother with the
[2:50:56] children oh let me tell you it is going
[2:50:58] to continue getting worse and
[2:51:02] worse it is the spirit of the
[2:51:05] age it's a problem going on by the way
[2:51:09] until women have come to a place where
[2:51:13] they
[2:51:14] feel they cannot trust men anymore
[2:51:20] and they
[2:51:21] feel that whatever men can do they can
[2:51:26] do is because there's a problem with our
[2:51:30] men the devil has targeted
[2:51:35] men to destroy them to completely remove
[2:51:39] the backbone their
[2:51:42] backbone when men are
[2:51:44] destroyed then the generation is rued
[2:51:48] where are
[2:51:49] men that can take
[2:51:52] responsibility men that can provide for
[2:51:54] their
[2:51:56] homes men that can take control of their
[2:51:58] own
[2:52:00] family take care of their children love
[2:52:03] their wives
[2:52:04] genu protect their wies
[2:52:07] genuinely fight for
[2:52:09] them you know these days you know women
[2:52:13] men can't fight for their
[2:52:16] women then you touch a woman of the
[2:52:21] man they would beat you and all your
[2:52:23] teeth would be
[2:52:24] out but these
[2:52:26] days you men can't fight for
[2:52:30] their when they

[2:52:43] woman and you see also the woman you are
[2:52:45] going to say don't worry me I just love

[2:56:09] Age come out of her my
[2:56:12] people don't be partakers of our sin
[2:56:18] by the way that's why even women are
[2:56:20] storming the
[2:56:22] pulpits young men are fearing to stand
[2:56:25] for
[2:56:27] God they can't preach
[2:56:32] anymore they tell you to take the word
[2:56:34] and
[2:56:35] preach you can't
[2:56:38] why not because you have no
[2:56:40] gifts but because you're too
[2:56:44] sinful so you are condemned
[2:56:48] but let me tell you if you can live
[2:56:51] right take the word I started preaching
[2:56:53] when I was 13 once years
[2:56:58] old and let me tell you it was a very
[2:57:00] nervous
[2:57:05] experience when the spirit of God Came
[2:57:07] Upon me stood before the people now I
[2:57:10] knew I had to rebuke them teach to instu
[2:57:14] them let me tell you it doesn't matter
[2:57:17] how old somebody
[2:57:20] is no it doesn't
[2:57:22] matter see you can take the
[2:57:24] word and stand with it and preach it and
[2:57:29] live with it don't allow anyone to
[2:57:32] intimidate
[2:57:35] you no Bible colle should send
[2:57:40] Hallelujah you don't need any
[2:57:43] paper you need the Holy
[2:57:46] Ghost and a a life
[2:57:49] to the
[2:57:53] word if if you don't stop this then I'll
[2:57:55] C you no one can Cur
[2:57:59] you praise the
[2:58:01] Lord friends I want to come to a climax
[2:58:04] now and learn this
[2:58:07] place
[2:58:09] Hallelujah just give me a few more
[2:58:11] minutes
[2:58:12] now see I want to bring this subject
[2:58:15] into perspective of the king searching
[2:58:17] for a virtuous wife
[2:58:22] the king response was to divorce
[2:58:27] her you
[2:58:30] know we see that there
[2:58:34] was a house called a house of
[2:58:38] [Music]
[2:58:39] women I'm not now going to read I'm just
[2:58:42] going to go through these
[2:58:43] things chapter 2 verse 1 to 4 that's
[2:58:46] where I am now
[2:58:49] you see and there was a chamberline
[2:58:50] called
[2:58:53] he and so he was the chamberline of the
[2:58:55] House Of The Virgins of the
[2:58:59] women when all the virgins
[2:59:03] came before we get there I will tell you
[2:59:05] that the word went
[2:59:08] out the king is
[2:59:11] searching tell your neighbor the king is
[2:59:16] searching and word went
[2:59:18] out to every place in the
[2:59:22] kingdom it was a vast
[2:59:26] Empire the King was searching searching
[2:59:29] for virtuous
[2:59:32] God he was going to marry anything that
[2:59:35] cross his
[2:59:37] path he was going to marry a virtuous
[2:59:41] girl a God that can listen to every
[2:59:45] word of the king and so the women came
[2:59:50] very many of them virtuous
[2:59:53] girls and all came in that
[2:59:56] room in the house of of the women and it
[3:00:00] was manned by a
[3:00:02] chamberline called
[3:00:05] he and now the Bible says all these were
[3:00:09] Fair
[3:00:12] virgins yes
[3:00:14] beautiful and they came in the palace
[3:00:16] suan to of the
[3:00:19] women into the custody of the of he the
[3:00:22] Chamberlin the king
[3:00:28] chamberline virgin enough is not for you
[3:00:30] to see The
[3:00:33] King The King wanted a purified virtuous
[3:00:42] wife so you see they would go through
[3:00:44] the first six months
[3:00:49] they would be showered with bitter
[3:00:53] HS and then another six
[3:00:56] months Street HS and
[3:01:00] orders oh my God you know the Bible
[3:01:02] talks about I will not expand it but in
[3:01:05] the Book of Revelation it speaks about
[3:01:07] you know the the eating of the
[3:01:10] book so the chamberline he The Virgins
[3:01:13] received all the things for their
[3:01:14] purification
[3:01:26] praise the name of the
[3:01:27] Lord
[3:01:29] now I'm coming to a climax soon and
[3:01:33] really I'm not doing this justice but
[3:01:35] it's all
[3:01:36] right don't you worry don't be in a
[3:01:39] hurry let me be in a hurry you don't be
[3:01:40] in a
[3:01:41] hurry praise the name of the Lord this
[3:01:44] plane must
[3:01:46] land and land
[3:01:48] properly so don't hurry me I'm finishing
[3:01:51] I'm
[3:01:53] landing amen don't jump out because you
[3:01:56] may
[3:01:58] die just just stay with me amen and and
[3:02:02] you know they began to be purified
[3:02:06] purified
[3:02:07] purified the women The
[3:02:11] Virgins
[3:02:13] now here was a virgin Among The Virgins
[3:02:20] and when I read this it touched me by
[3:02:21] the way it moved my
[3:02:24] heart let me tell you God
[3:02:28] loves making a nobody
[3:02:35] somebody in the
[3:02:38] pal the Bible says there was a certain
[3:02:41] Jew whose name was
[3:02:44] M the son of
[3:02:46] J son of
[3:02:48] sh do you remember that
[3:02:52] name the son
[3:02:54] ofish
[3:02:58] benjamite do you remember do you
[3:03:00] remember when the king uh the King David
[3:03:03] was being Chas by his son
[3:03:07] abs and he went into the mountains you
[3:03:10] remember the man who came stoning
[3:03:13] him how many remember that man is name
[3:03:17] come on
[3:03:18] now what was the
[3:03:24] name you remember the name shim shim
[3:03:29] everybody say shim shim shim was the man
[3:03:33] sheim out you know he was from the
[3:03:36] family of King
[3:03:41] sa from The Tribe of
[3:03:45] Benjamin shim was not happy with
[3:03:49] David and you know shim came with
[3:03:53] curses and He was cursing
[3:03:56] David because he killed
[3:03:59] sa and the family of sa because was
[3:04:03] coming from the same
[3:04:05] family he was a
[3:04:08] relative so now listen Church M was a
[3:04:14] grandson of shim
[3:04:19] a grandson of
[3:04:23] shim that family of
[3:04:26] shim not a good
[3:04:28] family she cast The King by the way
[3:04:32] later on repented and the King forgave
[3:04:35] him but the king told his
[3:04:43] son this is the same same family
[3:04:48] that cast King
[3:04:50] David and you know you can't cast what
[3:04:52] God has
[3:04:54] blessed when C what God has blessed the
[3:04:57] cast comes on
[3:04:59] you so you might as well say sh was
[3:05:01] coming from a family that wasmer
[3:05:07] cast but that is where mod came
[3:05:12] from was a grandson of
[3:05:16] shim a of no
[3:05:19] bodies a family of the
[3:05:22] curers a family that was not accepted by
[3:05:25] God
[3:05:27] Som because it was rejected by God and
[3:05:31] soul but I want you to see that the
[3:05:34] Bible
[3:05:36] says is the man that brought
[3:05:42] upaa and you know because Esther you can
[3:05:45] say Esther was a cousin of M
[3:05:52] because because you see the Uncle of
[3:05:54] Modi was the father of
[3:05:58] Esther are you still following me we are
[3:06:01] trying to Le now we are approaching to
[3:06:04] land
[3:06:05] listen now not land but land displ my
[3:06:11] brother you miss it but it's all right
[3:06:13] let's continue so we see here as Esther
[3:06:16] was coming
[3:06:18] she came from a family of the
[3:06:24] rejects
[3:06:26] amen when I read
[3:06:29] this I broke
[3:06:32] down doesn't matter about my
[3:06:39] background if God is to favor
[3:06:43] me he will favor
[3:06:45] me no matter what my back
[3:06:52] is she was a
[3:06:54] nobody from a family of no
[3:06:57] bodies
[3:06:58] but was destined for
[3:07:05] greatness I know I'm listening and ra
[3:07:08] I'm talking to someone here
[3:07:10] today I believe it I know
[3:07:14] it that is destined for greatness
[3:07:22] not because I said
[3:07:24] it because we in the same anointing of
[3:07:29] Esther why Esther had something special
