[24:21] AAR just to come and be with us this uh
[24:25] this evening Lord uh those who have made
[24:28] it here here and those who are uh
[24:30] following this service online I pray
[24:33] that each one will uh will will receive
[24:36] a blessing from Heaven that it will be a
[24:38] special service it will be a spe a
[24:40] special moment in your presence father
[24:43] bless everyone who has come for it's a
[24:45] sacrifice to come but Lord we know it's
[24:48] a blessing to be in your presence Lord
[24:51] may you strengthen the man of God and
[24:52] use him Lord to power out whatever it is
[24:55] that you have designed before the
[24:57] foundation of the world that he would be

[25:07] speak to us father we commit all things

[25:12] Jesus mighty name amen
[25:15] amen
[25:17] amen praise the Lord you may be seated
[25:19] for just a
[25:22] moment we I would like to greet you all
[25:25] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[25:29] I wonder brother Samuel and this brother
[25:31] sister if you could come R this
[25:39] side amen how many are happy for the
[25:43] Vista that God has given to
[25:46] [Applause]
[25:48] us
[25:51] amen and
[25:53] uh yesterday
[26:00] yesterday we were in
[26:03] ginger for the graduation of brother
[26:08] Dixon and it was a wonderful
[26:12] moment amen and uh after that we went to
[26:17] which is one of the main reasons why I
[26:19] actually
[26:22] went is because I wanted to be uh to be
[26:26] able to speak to the family
[26:31] uh the
[26:32] father mother's
[26:34] house so there were aunties
[26:38] grandparents and many other family
[26:41] members we had 20 to 30 people
[26:45] there and I preached to them the
[26:48] word and uh it was a great
[26:52] opportunity some of them actually live
[26:54] here in
[26:56] Cala so uh we are trying to engage with
[27:00] them I'm sure they will start coming to
[27:02] our
[27:04] service so it was a wonderful
[27:07] opportunity Dixon desired
[27:10] that he asked me he said that I want to
[27:15] graduate but I see it as an
[27:18] opportunity for my people to hear the
[27:21] message uh so I just honored that
[27:25] because it was a good a good desire
[27:30] and I think if you also do the
[27:33] same if you have a
[27:35] wedding or a party
[27:38] graduation even if it's a birthday
[27:42] party if you decied to make one invite
[27:45] us to preach the
[27:47] message yes it's a good opportunity to
[27:49] preach the
[27:51] word those friends of yours who have
[27:53] never heard what you
[27:56] believe but the problem we shy away from
[27:59] those kind of
[28:01] things we should not shy away from
[28:04] it an
[28:06] opportunity amen so this this
[28:10] weekend we are blessed with Pastor
[28:12] Francis
[28:15] BTA an
[28:17] elder in the
[28:19] message from kosi
[28:23] Kenya
[28:25] amen um tomorrow we shall be doing an
[28:33] interview which is one of the main
[28:36] reasons really why I failed to invite
[28:41] him um but I was just asking him how old
[28:45] he is he's um on the seventh floor
[28:50] already he's headed to the eighth
[28:54] one so he's I don't know whether he
[28:57] would feel okay if I said he's an old
[29:00] [Music]
[29:03] man and so he and I are very great
[29:09] friends but we are Generations
[29:14] apart if you've noticed most of my close
[29:16] friends are old
[29:20] people and that's why many people think
[29:23] when I tell them my age they say no
[29:24] you're joking
[29:28] because I behave like an old
[29:31] man you know when you stay around
[29:34] wisdom you also get that
[29:38] wisdom amen and so uh Pastor batita is
[29:42] one of the very first generation here in
[29:44] East
[29:48] Africa that received this enti
[29:52] message and did not only receive it and
[29:55] believe
[29:56] it but they also uh went out to preach
[30:01] it and evangelized it um and as you will
[30:05] hear on the
[30:07] interview also in Uganda he
[30:11] came in those early
[30:13] years Western Kenya and the rest of the
[30:15] part
[30:17] of and uh there's many other things we
[30:20] can
[30:21] say so I've been blessed to be a part of
[30:23] the meetings he has been making there in
[30:25] Kenya
[30:29] ever since I was actually in
[30:32] Ethiopia uh one of ours there a deacon
[30:36] in
[30:38] Ethiopia brother
[30:40] Timothy he's from the church of Pastor
[30:45] Francis and so he is the one who
[30:47] connected
[30:49] us and I came to love Pastor
[30:52] V what he stands for the way he believes
[30:56] this message testimony in the
[30:59] past and in the
[31:01] present and um so I feel that his
[31:04] ministry this
[31:06] weekend is going to impact Our
[31:11] Generation uh Pastor I think about 90%
[31:15] of the members of this church both here
[31:17] and elsewhere wherever they're
[31:24] following are younger people so we
[31:27] believe that your ministry this
[31:30] weekend is going to impact the Young
[31:35] Generation and so it's U recently uh I
[31:39] think around April
[31:44] March he had um a huge Health
[31:50] Challenge he actually told me that he
[31:53] thought he had gone twice
[31:58] uh but certainly God has added him more
[32:01] time I
[32:03] believe for such a time as
[32:05] this and um for him to travel all the
[32:08] way from Western
[32:11] Kenya come and be with us
[32:14] here it's a great
[32:17] honor and not that he's coming to speak
[32:19] to thousands of
[32:22] people but even if it is for one
[32:25] soul I believe the purpose of God shall
[32:28] be
[32:29] accomplished and I want to sincerely
[32:32] appreciate you Pastor
[32:34] for and accepting our
[32:37] invitation you know in your um at your
[32:42] age your business
[32:45] schedule both at work and also in the
[32:48] ministry you've come I would like to say
[32:51] thank you so
[32:52] much thank you so much so this evening
[32:56] we are just going to have uh him preach
[32:58] to
[33:00] us and then on Satur day that is
[33:05] tomorrow at 300
[33:09] p.m. we we we shall host the interview
[33:12] on the bench as usual
[33:15] here and um so if you can come and be a
[33:19] part of it that's
[33:22] okay and even those following online if
[33:24] you a young minister
[33:28] I'm sure that that session will be a
[33:32] blessing so please come and be a part of
[33:36] it and then on Sunday we shall have the
[33:39] last service with
[33:41] him so it's a a powerp
[33:45] weekend
[33:48] amen uh he was uh coming by car he was
[33:52] having a driver driving him
[33:56] down and when they reached the
[33:59] Border uh they noticed that the car they
[34:02] forgot to clear it through customs
[34:04] through
[34:06] immigration last
[34:13] time bringing it back
[34:19] again I was thinking to
[34:22] myself if it was me at his
[34:25] age even at my age I feel it's difficult
[34:29] to go to travel by
[34:33] bus I was thinking if it was me at his
[34:37] age I just called and said I'm sorry I
[34:39] cannot
[34:42] come but he
[34:44] decided to come by bus from the
[34:50] border want to say we appreciate that
[34:54] sacrifice and so uh be ATT

[53:27] but I want to give this
[53:32] thought we can do
[53:37] something there is something we can
[53:42] do um thinking about this great man of
[53:49] David
[53:51] David when when he was uh in his
[53:59] battles he had
[54:04] about7 who
[54:07] decided we
[54:11] stand and they were not rich
[54:14] men of them
[54:18] were some of them were
[54:21] poor some of them were unable to pay Lo
[54:27] that's what the Bible says some of them
[54:29] were not pay their
[54:32] [Music]
[54:35] loans and they said what shall we
[54:38] do and they joined the B of
[54:43] David and when they join the
[54:48] of I want you to see the type of men
[54:54] thatav these are men
[54:56] who their
[55:01] lives and I believe the Bible
[55:05] says in the book of
[55:07] Acts
[55:09] God separate
[55:20] me men who have taken their
[55:24] lives and they have not saved it
[55:28] they have took taken their life and put
[55:30] in
[55:33] danger for the sake of the
[55:36] gospel and this men of
[55:40] David there are men who took their
[55:44] lives their
[55:46] homes aband their
[55:49] Farms maybe their
[55:52] buses and said we are going to stand
[55:57] praise the name of the
[55:58] Lord and they went to stand
[56:02] with where they would get the
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] next Now look for they going
[56:13] to and when they know there's nothing
[56:17] toefit ra keep
[56:20] away but can you
[56:23] imagine this made know there nothing we
[56:30] they going to
[56:32] standav for the principle that this is
[56:35] becom a
[56:38] king they know he coming to be a
[56:44] king ask why you
[56:47] foll because he the
[56:50] king God
[57:05] they know the
[57:09] king you may
[57:11] say but the soul is
[57:13] there is
[57:15] there but this men have a
[57:21] re they know where the anointing is
[57:26] they know where the spirit of God is
[57:30] leading and they decided we follow
[57:35] him and we
[57:36] see the Bible gives us three of
[57:42] them it gives us
[57:51] one amen
[57:54] amen this man oh
[58:06] verse
[58:12] says he lifted up his spear against 800
[58:24] [Music]
[58:26] when they came threatening he didn't
[58:28] give
[58:31] up when they came armed to
[58:36] attack because of
[58:39] David Because of Who David is to
[58:43] them he could not see the
[58:47] ground he could not be
[58:54] moved when Christian are threatened and
[58:57] they
[58:59] move when they are threatened and they
[59:02] they see
[59:05] ground Satan does not come you know in
[59:09] Beats

[1:00:04] Soldier he could not give
[1:00:06] up sometime the Devil comes he comes
[1:00:10] with this
[1:00:11] temptation when you are not
