want to thank God for his grace [Music] amen Brothers you can continue doing that slowly slowly so I would like to uh to bring greetings from everywhere I have been unfortunately I thought I would show you a slideshow with photos and some videos [Music] but I thought it is going to be better to uh to do a newsletter instead uh um [Music] they will save time and it will have more information [Music] [Music] I'm trying to put together a newsletter and uh we shall put it up on the website and give you the link and PDF so you can be able to go through it again but for those who cannot be able to read and maybe those who will not access I just want to give you a little bit of uh a report of what the Lord did during the time when we have been away this was a missionary trip you know it was past aside who helped me to understand that um it has been a missionary [Music] when you travel as a pastor maybe you visit church and then minister in a church and then come back but this was a full-fledged missionary trip traveling to many areas many places at the same time [Music] I did not initially tell you that I was going to South Africa Africa because I had not yet got the Visa and it came on the very last minute so I traveled on 30. and I'm telling you friends before I even tell you everywhere I've been but I've been greatly impacted by this trip to especially you know commit myself to do more for the Lord I think we we all need to do more for the Lord because there are many people out there serving God seriously and we really want to also continue to do more even more to be more serious foreign it was a good time especially not only in the service but also having fellowship with him this is a man who believes the same thing I believe I love this same message the way we love it he has consecrated this his life to this message and I really appreciated to see that a lot of young people they are really serving God with all they have an engine I think Pastor mahede is my senior I really from the fellowship I had with him and the kind of nature of the ministry has I felt he should even come in one of our youth meetings I believe he'll be a blessing so then from Johannesburg we had a Friday and a Sunday then I traveled to a flight to Zimbabwe Johannesburg we had initially planned with Pastor said who had actually invited us there is that we were coming he also invited us to come and take a few meetings they were having Easter meetings also in Harare I'm telling you this man have really worked for God has been physically run down [Music] in the past it was it seemed to be a very uh growing and fast-growing country um they had the white people there and so they had the Farms big farms Big Time Farms big factories I mean people were really the economy was booming white people left again uh you know like everything started going down so you have a lot of actually young people migrating from Zimbabwe to South Africa and the UK African UK but in the middle of all that has very little population Zimbabwe is how many people do we have here yes 45 Millions you know our land mass is not that large 17 millions and its land mass is so big so the people are very few so you would say that maybe you will find message believing churches of about maybe 20 people 30 40. foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and so for the for the most of the first week I spent it with the brethren in Harare was in um he left he went to Harare he went to the UK and all those places where he was going to see there was a lot of work that God did churches that which is almost 300 kilometers away this is a church of several hundreds I saw I saw on the on the cornerstone there was a writing that Pastor chikos dedicated that in 1987. a few of us were born at that time but at that time there were people preaching this message and there are very many people there who are still standing exception spent at their place at his home in a very way then we traveled back to uh to Harare and you see every place I'm telling you I was preaching please you can imagine I I was really I think I this was the time I've preached more services so then at in at Highlands this is a certain part in a Harare they had the Eastern meetings also about maybe a thousand people so a little more and and they were gathering there and we took the first day the Friday the Friday two Services I preached the first service the second service and remember on Saturday we had the main Services which was the reason why we went to Zimbabwe almost about another 300. [Music] after preaching on Friday morning Friday afternoon immediately we went to uh to our car and we traveled to uh to to Guero and by the time we reached in Guero again I sure didn't feel like preaching I'm so tired brother are you sure I'm preaching in the morning I said ah no you are the one so I started praying for God to give me Grace God gave us wonderful meetings I am Telling You wonderful meetings there is a testimony the Pastor said to me here is that one and uh and I'll read a portion for you of that testimony there is a quote of brother Branham Lucas Samson the lion run out to kill him the lion when the power of God come upon him just probably pull his Jaws apart a little bit curly headed shrimp about that high little bitty old fellows scrolling look on the street seven little locks hanging around his head like a little [Music] and he was no more than a little until the spirit of God come upon him um now it wouldn't be hard to believe that a great big giant could slay a lion with his hand [Music] I believe you couldn't but funny thing was this little bitty fellow done it but the spirit of the Lord come upon him um he ever eat [Music] [Music] just overcome it with the power of God Hallelujah and so friends while I was preaching in our church I should also say this the place where they were gathering they lost it you almost even canceled the meeting he failed to continue pressing forward to find another place [Music] couldn't find another place so but they had they had Churchland have toilets [Music] so they couldn't be allowed to hold me to have the license to uh hold meetings but he organized and he found the neighbors they allowed them to use their presses and and so they got a place on that land and they raised the tentative [Music] [Music] right at the foreign and you know and on the last service if you these services are being streamed on our Channel but you will listen right on the pulpitas on the last service I was preaching and I gave a degradation there will be a tabernacle here we should be raised for the glory of God [Music] there is a message [Music] right at that place they found a beehive and when when they removed it and see what the soil when they removed it is [Music] foreign we had about 12 services from there we went to Ethiopia had a fellowship with the with the pastor there and the brother girimi and his wife and also a few brethrens [Music] so it was a trip countries South Africa Zimbabwe South Africa Zimbabwe and Ethiopia I say it was a wonderful time of refreshing [Music] who really was encouraged and I believe there is there is more to do for the Lord all the Believers they are sent greetings amen do you receive the greetings but before we we go into the world I just want to appreciate the Brethren that I've been laboring here the ministry that has labored since I was away of where it is I want to say you know updates of the voice it's a moving a Ministry because of a man

more time now as we're going to the words [Music] [Music] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] I just invite you to your Bibles now we will go to the book of Acts chapter 7 verse 54. to me thank you brothers when they hired these things they were cut to the heart and they nushed on him with their teeth [Music] but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and cast him out of that City and stunned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was soul and they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin in their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep foreign foreign Acts chapter 7 and verses 54. however mommy yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] the Lord willing I'm going to speak for about 40 minutes I am not yet ready so ready

Else Matters tell your neighbor nothing else [Music] amen so we see here A Man by the name of Stephen and you know Stephen God had got a hold of him and Stephen was ready to yield himself and give his life let me tell you if you want to succeed in life you should never give yourself to something that you're not ready to die foreign [Music] that looks like zero percent so let me say it again in this life if you want to be successful could I never give your life to something hey reaching you are not willing and ready to die for children that is two percent did you hear that amen I mean all right

to Rebecca I'm willing to die for you let somebody touch you let them listen I'm willing to die and I hope you're waiting to die for me you must be waiting to die for something that you have given your life because your life is not cheap he said your name but your life is not cheap your life is expensive should not be played with your life to something you are willing to die for number one let me tell you when God gets a hold of your life nothing else he gave his life to something he was willing to die foreign [Music] [Music] and they wanted but when it comes to Jesus nothing else matters you need to have things in your life which you are not ready to dread for anything you can say you can take everything but when it comes to this when it comes to this is you cannot there is no negotiation I don't even want to talk to you as long as you're talking about do you know what that thing should be in our life [Music] Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ yes Chris is the word I say Jesus Christ yes Christian is the one and if you touch Jesus then you have touched my eyes and I cannot relate it he was even one of the Commanders did not even cast them what day the man while he was there the Bible says he said father praise the name of the Lord let us see what they said Stephen calling upon God say Lord Jesus receive my spirit [Music] and he cried with a loud voice [Music] not this sinach and he died why did they kill him they killed him I'm gonna die because of what he believes as I was in Zimbabwe and South Africa and even Ethiopia I met people that have surrendered their lives soon [Music] foreign God has blessed them so much that when it comes to the world these Goods to some of them they will even be surprised that you were a Believer and you are still you know like in living in a mediocre are there believers who are prosperous I was here I was listening to pastor mahanda Pastor Amanda was one of the pastors is the pastors at Highlands and he was giving a testimony of a police officers one of the top most in the government I will not go in the whole details without qualification foreign [Music] that will benefit me if you have this message but when you overcome you're not going to go out together to seek foreign foreign what made Daniel a prime minister their books on success was not the explanation by being like but you need to remember he had to come from Jacob yeah let me tell you God is looking for princesses nothing else matters foreign hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen found a young man and I'm I'm inviting him to come he said I spoke to his Pastor I said I'd like him he I I was touched when I saw how God was dealing with him and I perceived that there was something going on in his life but this is a young man born in the message but later on he did find it when you see he was out into the world the devil was taking him into many things but in all those things you know he found yes sir that there was no solution there was no peace foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God will give you a wife foreign thank you that's what Pastor Marcus did in Ethiopia my wife would remember that um foreign amen when he saw her nobody needed to tell him that this is whatever he said that for a few months about two three months later yesterday in the church he was interpreting foreign foreign foreign foreign [Music] [Music] you have gone in cases hey foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign and we found some Zimbabwe and I said you live here I want to say no this is my country I told him there's another high ranking officer you know I want to share the content nothing could suggest you as a soldier yeah [Music] [Music] he will tell you this message is true this message is true this is what the message some of us did that [Music] the same would have been in many many different parts of life and when God gets a holiday if you were a seed of God is and soul how does it he said I went when I was joining the the work here specialist so he you know to work for for the for the State House you have to go through the drills of the Army and the police for six months my name is I became so so strong and so how strong-hearted even when the world comes it doesn't move me easily but right there now we began talking he began encouraging him we began showing him crazy [Music] nothing foreign are you hearing what I'm saying to you nothing else matters when he was baptized and he was prayed for by brothers and his eyes opened you know their eyes we are blind guy you got severe people are blind that's his message and yet they think they are singing whatever um but when you come under the influence of the entire message what happened so they dropped now you go once like he did with him I believe is different from his second saying um foreign at first he thought it was okay to wear a a a a trousers you thought you cannot be smart and you thought you cannot look nice when you don't dress the way they dress but when the scales went off that you are fearful um you start seeing you no longer need the girlfriends you no longer need to do what the boys are doing today the boys out there I will call you foreign you are not going to have them together as friends when you're not sharing the word with them why because God has got us and the moment and he said everything I knew I now count as donkey for Christ everything I knew I am now declaring that means nothing Hallelujah man it is now losses he started counting his losses when you come to the message you begin counting losses you begin doing what counting losses foreign [Music] Christ Christ and when he gets a hold of you nothing else amen you will want to continue only in the pre-drawn plan that God has made you want to yield yourself so much to him that you will count all the losses amen but if you cannot count your losses I say count your losses everyone that comes to Christ must count losses drunk Prophet is assured ah
