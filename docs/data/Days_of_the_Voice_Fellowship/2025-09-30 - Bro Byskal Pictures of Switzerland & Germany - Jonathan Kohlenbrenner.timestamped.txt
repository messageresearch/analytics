[2:15] One day you're going to leave this
[2:17] world. And I say with the songwriter,
[2:20] what then?
[2:25] And I'm not preaching for time.
[2:28] I'm not preaching for this life.
[2:31] I'm not even here for this life.
[2:34] I feel very connected
[2:37] to another world
[2:40] and I feel like I'm a representative
[2:43] of that world.
[2:47] That's where God is.
[2:52] Heavenly Father,
[2:54] we've come to the closing moments of
[2:57] this time
[2:59] and we feel very connected
[3:03] to the eternal.
[3:06] You are our father.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; All things are
[3:12] uh within your hands
[3:15] and you just deal with us so tenderly.
[3:19] You show us your will.
[3:22] You tell us we shall fulfill it all. We
[3:26] shall do it, oh God. And we're so
[3:29] thankful you've allowed us to have this
[3:32] piece of eternity
[3:34] here in this time. And you've allowed
[3:37] this message to cause us to be merged
[3:42] with the eternal realm.
[3:45] Oh God,
[3:47] may the people see it. Father, may they
[3:50] go out of here walking knowing that they
[3:53] are eternal sons and daughters of the
[3:57] living God. Yes, we're here for a very
[4:01] short time, but we are eternal beings.
[4:05] We're eternal sons and daughters. Lord,
[4:08] when we greet one another, let it be a
[4:12] full understanding that comes our way in
[4:15] Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now. we
[4:19] pray to be witnesses of the eternal
[4:22] realm in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[4:27] Amen. Just want to sing till we meet.
[4:29] Till we meet at Jesus feet. Okay.
[4:37] [Music]
[4:48] Till we meet.
[4:54] Till we
[5:02] at Jesus.
[5:08] Till we
[5:11] [Music]
[5:19] go
[5:21] be with you till we meet again.
