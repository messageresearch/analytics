[1:14:10] always to be here.
[1:14:13] Uh God richly bless you and reward you
[1:14:15] for that.
[1:14:18] I do always desire to
[1:14:21] [Music]
[1:14:23] but the demand of Caesar
[1:14:28] Uh this time when pastor told me
[1:14:34] my supervisor had already told me I'm
[1:14:36] not going to be around on Saturday.
[1:14:47] night,
[1:14:50] you can't really make it to work on
[1:14:52] Saturday morning because
[1:14:57] there they want you by 7:20. Beyond
[1:14:59] that, a morning later
[1:15:06] beyond that you get a warning letter.
[1:15:09] Actually, it goes it goes you be
[1:15:11] expelled.
[1:15:15] So he had told me Saturday I'm not going
[1:15:16] to be around and as long as he's not
[1:15:18] there I have to be there.
[1:15:24] When I'm not there he has to be there.
[1:15:29] So I I met him I think around Wednesday
[1:15:34] when pastor told me
[1:15:37] to preach.
[1:15:39] I told him sorry but I want to talk to
[1:15:42] you.
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:46] got a certain program.
[1:15:49] Actually, I told him I'm going to
[1:15:50] preach.
[1:15:53] He said, "Ah, but I already told you I'm
[1:15:55] not going to be alone."
[1:15:58] I told him, "I don't know what to do."
[1:16:01] He said, "All right, I'll stay." You go.
[1:16:06] Yeah.
[1:16:09] So he was really tired and exhausted,
[1:16:12] but he stood for me.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:18] So I thank God for that.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Exodus 23:29-30.
[1:16:26] The Bible says
[1:16:29] Exodus chapter 23 verse 29-30.
[1:16:37] I will not drive them out from before
[1:16:39] thee in one year,
[1:16:44] lest the land become desolate, and the
[1:16:47] beast of the field multiply against
[1:16:49] thee.
[1:16:51] By little and little I will drive them
[1:16:54] out from before thee until thou be
[1:16:57] increased and inherit the land.
[1:17:01] Amen.
[1:17:20] [Music]
[1:17:26] Amen. You may take your seat.
[1:17:31] Just a few words to encourage you
[1:17:35] in the service of the Lord
[1:17:38] that you may press on
[1:17:41] towards the mark of thy calling in
[1:17:43] Christ Jesus.
[1:17:46] Nothing beyond that.
[1:17:49] But just what will encourage you
[1:17:53] to keep on believing,
[1:17:56] pressing on,
[1:17:58] trusting
[1:17:59] and abiding in Christ.
[1:18:03] In that simplicity,
[1:18:07] the simplicity of Christ,
[1:18:11] God will guard your hearts
[1:18:15] and minds
[1:18:18] till the day of Christ.
[1:18:21] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:22] You not see in this scripture
[1:18:26] uh if you see your neighbor dozing
[1:18:31] the spirit is willing but the flesh is
[1:18:33] weak.
[1:18:36] Tell them
[1:18:40] you may wake up when we are not here.
[1:18:48] We've not gone home
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; but when the Lord has taken us
[1:18:52] I'm afraid don't sleep.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Just stay awake for a short while.
[1:19:00] So here he says, I will not drive them
[1:19:03] out from before thee in one year.
[1:19:08] I I I I
[1:19:11] will not drive them out from before you
[1:19:15] in one year. these Canonites and
[1:19:18] Hittites and Heites
[1:19:20] that were inheriting the promised land.
[1:19:24] God says,
[1:19:26] "Yes, I'm going to drive them out,
[1:19:29] but not in one year.
[1:19:32] Because if I do that, the land will
[1:19:35] become desolate."
[1:19:39] Oh God almighty,
[1:19:41] God is mighty.
[1:19:43] Why drive these fellows away quickly?
[1:19:46] He says, "If I do that, the land will
[1:19:50] become desolate and the beast of the
[1:19:53] field will multiply against you."
[1:19:57] You are still few. You are still little.
[1:20:01] You have not yet attended to that
[1:20:04] to possess the entire land.
[1:20:07] But little and little
[1:20:11] I will drive them out
[1:20:14] until
[1:20:15] you be increased
[1:20:18] and inherit the land. I will give you a
[1:20:21] portion by portion, little by little, a
[1:20:25] portion at a portion, one day at a time,
[1:20:29] until when you increase, then you
[1:20:31] inherit the entire land. But if I dare
[1:20:35] drive them away,
[1:20:37] the land will become desolate.
[1:20:39] Yourselves also will be consumed.
[1:20:49] Oh, you promised us the land.
[1:20:52] Just give us the land. He says fast you
[1:20:57] will live in the land
[1:21:00] of the promise
[1:21:02] with them
[1:21:04] but little by little I'll drive them
[1:21:07] home.
[1:21:09] God is in no hurry.
[1:21:12] That's my subject.
[1:21:14] God is in no hurry.
[1:21:17] Before I go further, I'll read a
[1:21:19] quotation. God talked to Moses
[1:21:23] 1953.
[1:21:25] The prophet says, "Write down to the end
[1:21:28] of the road.
[1:21:31] Write down to the end of the road." No.
[1:21:35] Going down to the end of the road.
[1:21:39] God will be faithful.
[1:21:42] You quit your doubting.
[1:21:46] Give over
[1:21:48] and give up.
[1:21:50] and let God.
[1:21:53] He said, "I will not give you the land
[1:21:56] in one year.
[1:21:59] For if I give you the world thing
[1:22:02] in one year, the wild beasts
[1:22:06] will come in and consume you. But little
[1:22:11] by little,
[1:22:13] as you are able,
[1:22:17] as you are able,
[1:22:21] I will give you the land
[1:22:25] as you are able.
[1:22:28] God is faithful to his promise. He says,
[1:22:31] "Quit doubting,
[1:22:33] give over, give up.
[1:22:37] Let go
[1:22:39] Paulo one day as he was sailing in that
[1:22:42] boat
[1:22:44] I believe that's actually 20
[1:22:47] he says
[1:22:49] God told them
[1:22:52] they let loose the ship
[1:22:55] let it loose give it over to the wind
[1:23:00] the ship is going to crash
[1:23:04] but life will be saved
[1:23:07] You may be afraid to give up and let go.
[1:23:11] But give over
[1:23:13] give up.
[1:23:15] Something may crash but life will be
[1:23:18] saved.
[1:23:21] As you are able,
[1:23:24] God is in no hurry.
[1:23:32] He works in his own good time.
[1:23:36] And the timing of God is good.
[1:23:40] Listen brothers
[1:23:42] chapter 3,
[1:23:46] a common scripture.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But Peter says,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; "I will not be negligant
[1:23:56] to keep you in memory or to remind you
[1:24:00] of these things.
[1:24:02] I will keep reminding you of the things
[1:24:04] that you know.
[1:24:10] Ecclesiastes chapter 3, he says,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; we go together, brother. To everything
[1:24:17] there is a season
[1:24:20] and a time to every purpose.
[1:24:24] To everything,
[1:24:26] not some things.
[1:24:28] everything
[1:24:30] there is a season
[1:24:33] and a time to every purpose.
[1:24:37] Every purpose has a time. Every time is
[1:24:43] for a purpose
[1:24:45] under heaven.
[1:24:47] A time to be born
[1:24:50] and a time to die.
[1:24:53] a time to plant
[1:24:55] and a time to break up that which is
[1:24:58] planted.
[1:25:00] There is a time to kill
[1:25:02] and a time to heal,
[1:25:05] a time to break down
[1:25:07] and a time to build up,
[1:25:14] a time to weep and a time to laugh.
[1:25:18] Maybe now is your time to to weep.
[1:25:24] but there is a time to love.
[1:25:27] When we talk about time, when something
[1:25:30] is put in time,
[1:25:32] it has a beginning and it has an ending.
[1:25:36] He says there's a time to mourn.
[1:25:40] There is a time to dance.
[1:25:42] You can't be sorrowful all the time.
[1:25:45] You can't be unhappy all the day. There
[1:25:48] is a time to mourn and a time to dance.
[1:25:54] Brother, sister, you can't be so
[1:25:56] unhappy.
[1:25:58] You can't be so cast down. There is a
[1:26:01] time to lift up.
[1:26:04] You can't look at us
[1:26:07] and show us attitude day after day,
[1:26:10] death after day. There's a time to
[1:26:13] rejoice,
[1:26:15] a time to cast away stones.
[1:26:18] You can carry burdens
[1:26:21] heavy like a stone. There is a time to
[1:26:24] cast them away.
[1:26:26] A time to gather stones
[1:26:29] together. A time to embrace
[1:26:32] and a time to refrain from embracing.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; There is a time to get.
[1:26:44] Listen brother and a time to lose.
[1:26:48] The people think
[1:26:51] listen brother. Job says to his wife,
[1:26:56] "Why speaks thou like one of the foolish
[1:26:58] women?
[1:27:00] Shall we only receive good from God
[1:27:04] and not evil?" Listen brother, there is
[1:27:07] a time to get prophets.
[1:27:10] There is a time to make a loss. You must
[1:27:14] understand
[1:27:15] the principles of God. But every loss
[1:27:20] comes with a certain good.
[1:27:26] But there is a time for that.
[1:27:29] It says a time to get
[1:27:32] and a time to lose. There is a time for
[1:27:35] you to work,
[1:27:37] a time to earn.
[1:27:40] But there is a time to give away.
[1:27:45] Brother,
[1:27:47] I sat and I thought,
[1:27:51] I said, God, if it wasn't you,
[1:27:55] I wouldn't have studied.
[1:27:57] If it wasn't you, I wouldn't have got
[1:28:00] the job of that.
[1:28:02] If it wasn't you, I wouldn't have got
[1:28:05] the money that I have.
[1:28:07] When I look,
[1:28:10] what do I lose to give away what you
[1:28:13] have given me?
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; I don't lose anything because thou has
[1:28:18] given it unto me,
[1:28:20] brother. A time to get and a time to
[1:28:24] give away. There is a time to keep
[1:28:28] and a time to cast away.
[1:28:32] You have got to keep
[1:28:35] but there is a time to cast away
[1:28:38] brother. There is a time to ren
[1:28:46] and a time to sue
[1:28:48] a time to keep silence
[1:28:51] and a time to speak.
[1:28:56] You can't be chit chattering all the
[1:28:57] time.
[1:29:00] Chick.
[1:29:05] There is a time to quiet
[1:29:10] just for once.
[1:29:13] Don't be so. There is a time to speak.
[1:29:18] A time to love and a time to hate. A
[1:29:22] time of war
[1:29:25] and a time of peace.
[1:29:28] What prophet
[1:29:31] as he that walketh in that wherein he
[1:29:33] labors
[1:29:37] I have seen travail
[1:29:40] which God has given to the sons of men.
[1:29:44] Listen to beised in it.
[1:29:50] God gives you travail.
[1:29:54] Be exercised in
[1:29:56] listen brother.
[1:29:58] physical exercise
[1:30:01] profitth but a little
[1:30:05] but spiritual exercise
[1:30:08] is profitable in all things
[1:30:11] if you don't want to give it yourself
[1:30:14] God gives it to you in
[1:30:18] He has made everything
[1:30:22] beautiful
[1:30:24] in his time.
[1:30:29] God has made all things beautiful in his
[1:30:34] own time.
[1:30:37] Maybe all you can see,
[1:30:40] all you can see,
[1:30:42] no goodness.
[1:30:45] Maybe that's what you're seeing.
[1:30:48] But he says
[1:30:50] in his own time,
[1:30:53] he makes everything
[1:30:56] beautiful.
[1:30:59] It turns ashes
[1:31:02] into beauty.
[1:31:05] It makes masterpieces
[1:31:08] from broken pieces.
[1:31:12] It can turn the tables around.
[1:31:15] But what the enemy meant for evil,
[1:31:18] God turns it around for my good.
[1:31:22] There is nothing happens to a believer
[1:31:25] that is haphazardly.
[1:31:28] That is by coincidence.
[1:31:30] Oh brother,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; when you get anything
[1:31:40] and bless it in time,
[1:31:46] it has got a beginning and an end.
[1:31:50] He says
[1:31:53] through everything
[1:31:56] there is a season.
[1:31:59] I don't know what it is that you are
[1:32:02] longing for.
[1:32:04] So Lord, there is a longing.
[1:32:07] There is a season
[1:32:10] and a time
[1:32:12] to every purpose.
[1:32:15] In other words,
[1:32:17] do you know the purpose of what you are
[1:32:19] long longing for?
[1:32:25] What purpose is it for?
[1:32:38] Sometimes
[1:32:40] we have things that we cry to God
[1:32:44] till when you come to a point
[1:32:48] and you say, "Oh Lord, how long
[1:32:54] like the souls that were under the
[1:32:56] altar?
[1:32:59] At the opening of the sixth seal,
[1:33:05] the souls under the altar
[1:33:08] and they said, "Lord, how long?
[1:33:11] How long? How long?"
[1:33:16] They were longing for virgin.
[1:33:20] How long shall it be?
[1:33:23] But he said, "Rest yet for it.
[1:33:29] I want to tell you brothers,
[1:33:31] rest for a little season,
[1:33:35] times and seasons.
[1:33:37] It's God who appoints these times.
[1:33:43] Men have schedules.
[1:33:47] Organizations have schedules.
[1:33:50] They have timets.
[1:33:53] They have a way they do their things.
[1:33:57] They have times for everything.
[1:34:00] They pay you for the time you have
[1:34:01] worked for
[1:34:04] at such a time you are supposed to be
[1:34:05] doing this.
[1:34:07] They have a program for the warrior.
[1:34:11] Where do they get the things
[1:34:14] and should you do anything
[1:34:18] that will make their program interfered?
[1:34:22] Brother, you are fired.
[1:34:26] But look brother,
[1:34:29] if money can be like that,
[1:34:32] they want to be so organized.
[1:34:37] Set a time for everything,
[1:34:39] a season for everything.
[1:34:42] Nevertheless,
[1:34:44] some of these things change by
[1:34:45] emergency.
[1:34:49] You and I set up things.
[1:34:53] But because of emergency things,
[1:34:57] you change time tables,
[1:35:00] because of human failures,
[1:35:03] we change time tables, we change
[1:35:06] schedules, we change programs,
[1:35:09] because of sicknesses,
[1:35:12] death, tax, some
[1:35:16] of course it there are things can't
[1:35:17] continue
[1:35:21] sometimes.
[1:35:24] Man's
[1:35:25] program,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; man's schedule
[1:35:32] meets the schedule of God.
[1:35:37] Look brother, if you ever set anything
[1:35:42] to be accomplished the next hour,
[1:35:47] the next day,
[1:35:50] the next minute.
[1:35:52] It is the future
[1:35:55] and there is no certainity
[1:35:59] in the hands of men
[1:36:02] that it is going to be
[1:36:04] unless
[1:36:07] it meets the program of God.
[1:36:11] So when you see it happening
[1:36:14] and you have planned it, you have a
[1:36:16] program for tomorrow.
[1:36:20] If you have a program for tomorrow,
[1:36:22] And you you fulfill that program
[1:36:25] just know that program
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; met the program of God.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Therefore you have got to plan.
[1:36:40] But
[1:36:42] in James chapter 4
[1:36:46] 13- 15
[1:36:50] it says
[1:36:52] James chapter 4
[1:36:55] 13-15 he says
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:02] go to now
[1:37:04] you that say today or tomorrow we will
[1:37:08] go into such a city should we go
[1:37:11] together
[1:37:14] come over here you that say tomorrow
[1:37:18] we will go into such a city
[1:37:21] and continue there a year
[1:37:25] and buy and sell and get gain
[1:37:30] whereas you know not what shall be on
[1:37:33] tomorrow
[1:37:36] for what is your life?
[1:37:39] It is even a vapor
[1:37:43] that appearth for a little time
[1:37:46] and then vanishes away.
[1:37:49] For that you ought to say
[1:37:57] if the Lord will
[1:38:01] shall live
[1:38:03] and do this or that.
[1:38:08] God in simplicity.
[1:38:12] If the Lord will
[1:38:15] shall live and do this and that
[1:38:21] look
[1:38:23] because
[1:38:25] it's God who knows that time.
[1:38:29] Sometimes
[1:38:31] men set time problems.
[1:38:35] They run bankrupt.
[1:38:39] So man really keeps his time.
[1:38:46] But Jesus keeps all his appointment.
[1:38:52] The church
[1:38:54] is God's organization.
[1:38:57] It's not confused and disorderly.
[1:39:02] That's why the prophet had to preach a
[1:39:04] message.
[1:39:07] church order.
[1:39:10] God is a God of order.
[1:39:16] Is a God of order.
[1:39:21] He's never moved by conditions.
[1:39:25] God is moved by his time.
[1:39:31] So brother, this condition
[1:39:36] this condition.
[1:39:38] That is not what moves.
[1:39:41] God is moved by his
[1:39:44] not your time.
[1:39:46] He's tired.
[1:39:50] God has a time table.
[1:39:54] That's why the prophet preached a
[1:39:56] message, the junction of time.
[1:40:02] He says we come to this junction
[1:40:07] that now the church has to be restored.
[1:40:10] This is where he sends Malachi 4.
[1:40:14] He says when he says we turn to this
[1:40:16] junction
[1:40:20] you turn to that junction
[1:40:22] the way of the word.
[1:40:25] Look brother
[1:40:27] he has the time table.
[1:40:32] They wandered in the wilderness
[1:40:35] and wondered and wondered
[1:40:37] and God was looking
[1:40:40] at them. But he said, "You have wandered
[1:40:45] on this mountain too long,
[1:40:48] turning northwards."
[1:40:51] The time God says, "Too long."
[1:40:57] It was really too long.
[1:41:04] So God has got a time table.
[1:41:07] Sometimes you want things so quickly.
[1:41:12] So quickly. So quickly.
[1:41:15] You want it so quickly.
[1:41:21] In a moment. In a tinkling of an eye.
[1:41:27] The moment I pray like this,
[1:41:31] I open my eyes.
[1:41:33] Let there be.
[1:41:36] Open your eyes.
[1:41:42] There isn't.
[1:41:44] But there is.
[1:41:46] The problem is
[1:41:50] thou seeest not
[1:41:53] as the bonds form in the womb.
[1:41:58] Tell me
[1:42:00] how come
[1:42:07] to bonds start to form.
[1:42:14] The problem is
[1:42:17] You want things so quickly,
[1:42:19] [Music]
[1:42:21] but if it's not God's time,
[1:42:24] you can't force it.
[1:42:30] And when it is time,
[1:42:33] you can't stop it.
[1:42:44] letting off the pressure
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; 1965.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; It says,
[1:42:55] "Get it over here."
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; No, no. 1962.
[1:43:08] I' read wrongly.
[1:43:14] Here he says paragraph 34.
[1:43:25] So then I thought,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; what would I speak to this congregation?
[1:43:39] I thought
[1:43:42] well
[1:43:44] they are probably trained right
[1:43:48] in everything
[1:43:51] no doubt
[1:43:53] but there is a pressure on the people
[1:43:56] today
[1:43:59] and that pressure
[1:44:02] has no limitation.
[1:44:07] or any denominational lines
[1:44:11] or any denominational lines.
[1:44:20] It has no edge line.
[1:44:24] So you can't say pressure is for the
[1:44:26] aged
[1:44:30] it has no
[1:44:32] it has no respect of person
[1:44:37] can't say I'm too spiritual
[1:44:41] I'm a man of God
[1:44:44] I'm so spiritfilled
[1:44:47] I believe that no doubt
[1:44:50] but it has no respect of
[1:44:55] You can't say I'm still young.
[1:44:58] You can't say I'm too old to worry.
[1:45:01] Soon I'm going anyway,
[1:45:04] Lord. I'm waiting.
[1:45:06] I'm ready to go. I've been faithful in
[1:45:09] your sons.
[1:45:11] I'm just too old.
[1:45:14] Bit tired.
[1:45:16] There's no need for pressure.
[1:45:19] It's on young and old.
[1:45:23] good and bad. You can't say I'm too good
[1:45:28] don't be under pressure
[1:45:30] to want something quickly.
[1:45:33] I want God to hurry hurry.
[1:45:36] It's on everybody
[1:45:39] pressure.
[1:45:45] We are living in a neurotic age.
[1:45:52] neurotic
[1:45:55] I don't know how to say it exactly
[1:45:59] nervous tension
[1:46:03] everybody resting here
[1:46:10] and going there
[1:46:13] and going nowhere
[1:46:16] you know why you are just trying to
[1:46:18] hurry
[1:46:24] You are just on a rush.
[1:46:28] You are going nowhere.
[1:46:36] Everybody's resting here.
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:47] Someone in the market
[1:46:49] is on a rush said
[1:46:54] fish and we all
[1:46:58] looking the man is not carrying.
[1:47:02] He just wanted to hurry.
[1:47:09] So we learned the same thing also in the
[1:47:11] market.
[1:47:14] because you rush
[1:47:16] and going there and going nowhere.
[1:47:19] It is just to that kind of an age.
[1:47:26] And and I know
[1:47:29] this church
[1:47:31] would be plagued with it
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:41] as everywhere
[1:47:43] is plagued with it.
[1:47:47] It says tabernacle
[1:47:50] is plagued with it.
[1:47:53] everywhere
[1:47:55] the whole world.
[1:47:58] Someone is saying, "No, brother.
[1:48:03] I'm preaching the message.
[1:48:09] You get in a rush.
[1:48:16] I want to fulfill my pledge very fast.
[1:48:21] I'm worried. I'm married.
[1:48:23] My brother is going to call.
[1:48:25] You are rushing forward, brother.
[1:48:29] You made the pledge. You brought the
[1:48:32] empty vessel.
[1:48:35] Allow God.
[1:48:38] You didn't make the pledge to worry
[1:48:42] and be so bothered, sorrowful,
[1:48:49] brother.
[1:48:56] Allow God.
[1:48:58] Allow God.
[1:49:00] God is in no hurry.
[1:49:03] Listen, when you we say God is no in no
[1:49:07] hurry.
[1:49:09] It doesn't mean that God does not know
[1:49:13] the deadlines.
[1:49:20] Sometimes
[1:49:22] God even extends deadlines.
[1:49:25] Other times it comes at the last day.
[1:49:31] But look,
[1:49:33] it fulfills his promise. Listen,
[1:49:39] God is in no hurry.
[1:49:44] Who prov
[1:49:47] you but not the Lord?
[1:49:52] God is in no hurry.
[1:49:59] It's a day of pressure.
[1:50:02] Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up.
[1:50:19] God is in no hurry.
[1:50:22] Brother, I want to finish up here.
[1:50:25] God knows where to finish.
[1:50:29] Hurry, hurry, hurry up and wait.
[1:50:32] Drive 90 miles an hour
[1:50:38] driver.
[1:50:40] What's the matter with you fellow? We
[1:50:42] have got to go. Come up. Let us move.
[1:50:47] This man came to work.
[1:50:51] Please don't rush the man.
[1:50:54] Be a Christian enough.
[1:50:59] Drive 90 miles an hour.
[1:51:02] And then to get home for supper
[1:51:12] and wait 2 hours till it gets ready.
[1:51:19] That's right. It's a time and in that
[1:51:24] rushing
[1:51:27] and speeding
[1:51:29] it gets you to another station.
[1:51:36] Listen brother,
[1:51:41] the wife will say something a little
[1:51:43] contrary.
[1:51:48] You want to fly off.
[1:51:51] temper.
[1:51:54] Husband says something.
[1:51:58] Let the husband say something like,
[1:52:02] you
[1:52:07] and tell him to get in the room.
[1:52:11] Well, now husband,
[1:52:15] I don't want no words with you.
[1:52:18] Go out to them.
[1:52:21] Please don't talk to me. I don't want I
[1:52:23] don't want
[1:52:29] wife.
[1:52:31] Oh, I'm so nervous.
[1:52:33] See why? What's the matter?
[1:52:38] All of this together,
[1:52:41] this tension building up,
[1:52:47] then the results of it is
[1:52:51] doing something wrong.
[1:52:58] I love the truth
[1:53:03] because the Christian
[1:53:05] the Christian heart
[1:53:08] no matter how hard the truth is
[1:53:12] that's what it needs
[1:53:17] the results of this
[1:53:20] this hurry hurry hurry right rushing is
[1:53:24] doing something wrong and acting getting
[1:53:28] out of place.
[1:53:32] Find brother, sisters.
[1:53:34] What are you rushing?
[1:53:37] Get to this sister. Get to that sister.
[1:53:39] Get to this brother. Get to that
[1:53:41] brother. Sister, talk to this brother.
[1:53:44] Send him. Send him a message there.
[1:53:50] You are doing something wrong.
[1:53:55] Why? because you are trying to rush.
[1:53:59] You are in a hurry.
[1:54:04] You start to act out of place.
[1:54:09] You start to get as if someone has as if
[1:54:13] we have done something wrong to you.
[1:54:18] But there's nothing we have done.
[1:54:22] You are just all pressured up and
[1:54:24] pivoted.
[1:54:28] That's the matter. You are rushing God.
[1:54:33] You can't lead God.
[1:54:36] Let God lead you.
[1:54:40] It will make the poor act that way.
[1:54:46] I'm all poor.
[1:54:49] Oh God.
[1:54:51] They start to rush.
[1:54:54] It will make middle class act that way.
[1:55:00] I want to get to the top.
[1:55:03] It will make the rich act that way.
[1:55:06] I want to remain on top.
[1:55:09] It will make the wrong act that way.
[1:55:13] It will make the pretty good act that
[1:55:15] way.
[1:55:18] And it will make the good act that
[1:55:22] because it's tension
[1:55:26] steam build up
[1:55:30] to blow it out somewhere.
[1:55:34] If you don't blow
[1:55:37] the boiler up, if you don't
[1:55:42] you blow the boiler up.
[1:55:47] pressure.
[1:55:51] If you don't take off that rush,
[1:55:54] brother, sister,
[1:55:59] you're going to blow. You're going to
[1:56:00] blow.
[1:56:04] Don't rush your daughters.
[1:56:07] Don't rush your sons.
[1:56:09] Allow God
[1:56:15] You cannot tell your wife.
[1:56:18] Look, I need a baby.
[1:56:22] 9 months is too long.
[1:56:26] What are you rushing about?
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; You are rushing.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, papa.
[1:56:42] Don't rush.
[1:56:45] Now, we find that
[1:56:48] it builds up
[1:56:51] as the day goes.
[1:56:55] You talk to your boss.
[1:56:57] If you are working,
[1:57:00] people came to work when they are fine
[1:57:05] but they they have pressure
[1:57:10] and they had to start meditation
[1:57:17] and you wonder what good is the payment
[1:57:20] doing anything good.
[1:57:26] Brothers and sisters in
[1:57:30] overloaded with loans.
[1:57:33] This one
[1:57:35] you are trying to rush.
[1:57:40] I'm not saying it's bad to do that.
[1:57:43] I'm only saying there are people that
[1:57:47] are moved by attention
[1:57:52] just rushing
[1:57:55] and it's not God's time.
[1:58:02] A borrower
[1:58:05] is a slave
[1:58:07] to the render.
[1:58:13] If you are working
[1:58:16] al so and so
[1:58:19] and if you speak to the kid
[1:58:22] to the kid
[1:58:24] come in here mama I am there you are it
[1:58:30] builds up
[1:58:33] says oh my you feel like you are your
[1:58:36] head is going to come off.
[1:58:41] There are people that get in a rush.
[1:58:45] People get in a rush
[1:58:48] and they say, "My head is boiling.
[1:59:02] Don't blow me.
[1:59:05] I know I am with it
[1:59:12] every day.
[1:59:14] So I know what it means.
[1:59:17] It builds up.
[1:59:24] It's just becoming an erotic age.
[1:59:29] Everybody is all built up. Haven't
[1:59:36] got no time.
[1:59:40] I have no time. I have no time.
[1:59:43] I have no time. I have no time. I have
[1:59:45] no time to rest. I have no time to
[1:59:47] sleep. I have no time to talk to
[1:59:49] someone. I have no time to do this. I
[1:59:52] have no time to come back. I have no
[1:59:54] time.
[1:59:55] You got time.
[2:00:00] You are just on the rush.
[2:00:03] and you are going nowhere.
[2:00:06] You got all the time.
[2:00:09] A time to rest, a time to serve, a time
[2:00:12] to work, a time to pray, a time to sing,
[2:00:16] a time to praise, a time to have time
[2:00:18] with the friends,
[2:00:20] brother, sister, a time to fellowship
[2:00:23] with us.
[2:00:25] You got all the time.
[2:00:28] I've got no time.
[2:00:31] You got the time. You are just on the
[2:00:33] rush.
[2:00:35] And that builds up to a place that
[2:00:38] breaks up things.
[2:00:47] You will break your friendship.
[2:00:52] You will break your fellowship.
[2:00:56] You will break your marriages.
[2:00:59] You're rushing your wife. You're rushing
[2:01:02] husband.
[2:01:03] It causes people to have hard feelings.
[2:01:10] The prophet is speaking.
[2:01:12] It makes people
[2:01:15] to have hard feelings.
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:24] Just feel
[2:01:27] why are you feeling bad?
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Tell me why are you feeling bad?
[2:01:45] You are just rushing
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; when they snap them off and say things
[2:01:51] you don't mean to say.
[2:02:03] You are rushing pap.
[2:02:08] You need to give God a little bit of
[2:02:11] time.
[2:02:14] Give him a little bit of time.
[2:02:17] It doesn't matter your cry.
[2:02:24] I've cried too long.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; I have cried too long.
[2:02:30] Oh God. And it has not moved you.
[2:02:36] Which scripture says your cry moves.
[2:02:45] It does.
[2:02:47] It does.
[2:02:49] But in his time
[2:02:54] Look brother, sister,
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; you don't cry
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; for something
[2:03:03] to be done.
[2:03:06] God makes you himself to cry
[2:03:11] that when it happens,
[2:03:15] you appreciate it.
[2:03:18] But
[2:03:19] it is meant to happen
[2:03:23] because God has for ordained your test.
[2:03:28] But
[2:03:30] predestination
[2:03:32] looks to for knowledge.
[2:03:35] A predestinated person
[2:03:38] will behave as a predestinated person.
[2:03:44] If you say I won't do anything about it,
[2:03:48] It's a sign you are not predestinated.
[2:03:52] But if you predestinated to it,
[2:03:55] he puts a burden within you. Look
[2:03:58] brother,
[2:04:00] that burden is a hook
[2:04:04] that God puts in a man's heart
[2:04:09] therewith.
[2:04:15] God doesn't give man. If God doesn't
[2:04:18] give man a vision,
[2:04:29] a person is going to be so hard to guide
[2:04:32] because
[2:04:34] he has no burden. But a vision is a
[2:04:36] pattern
[2:04:38] that God puts in a man's heart.
[2:04:42] And this man, he has to live or die for
[2:04:45] that.
[2:04:47] It is the will of God.
[2:04:50] Keep that man.
[2:04:56] A vision
[2:04:58] is a hook
[2:05:02] to bring to come to pass
[2:05:05] that God predestinated to come to pass.
[2:05:12] There's nothing catches him by surprise.
[2:05:16] He's never afraid of any man's prayer.
[2:05:39] I'm done. No, no, no, no.
[2:05:45] How did this happen? How did you get a
[2:05:46] car?
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's a good one. Brother,
[2:05:51] you are inspired.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] I am afraid
[2:05:56] if so and so prays.
[2:05:59] I wasn't prepared.
[2:06:01] Let's hurry up. Let us go and meet Mary
[2:06:08] 100 years.
[2:06:10] God has appointed times.
[2:06:16] Do you know where the book of Abak is?
[2:06:20] you get to that book
[2:06:24] uh Habac we read chapter two
[2:06:32] uh uh verse 2-3
[2:06:41] it says
[2:06:46] and the Lord answered me and
[2:06:51] Write the vision.
[2:06:54] Make it plain upon tables
[2:06:58] that he may run
[2:07:02] that reads it.
[2:07:13] Make it plain.
[2:07:17] For the vision
[2:07:19] is yet for an appointed time,
[2:07:26] but at the end,
[2:07:28] it shall speak
[2:07:31] and not lie.
[2:07:34] Though it
[2:07:37] wait for it because it will surely come.
[2:07:42] It will not
[2:07:46] say no.
[2:07:49] Wait for it. It will speak and not lie.
[2:07:55] Wait for God to answer
[2:07:58] in his own time.
[2:08:02] teaching on Moses.
[2:08:06] But little boys and girls,
[2:08:10] does God hear prayer?
[2:08:13] It's a question.
[2:08:16] He hears prayer.
[2:08:20] Does God answer prayer?
[2:08:23] Yeah.
[2:08:25] He answers prayer.
[2:08:27] Does he answer real quick?
[2:08:32] Not all the time does he?
[2:08:39] No.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:08:42] he makes us wait,
[2:08:45] [Music]
[2:08:47] the longer they wait,
[2:08:50] the greater the testimony.
[2:08:56] [Applause]
[2:08:58] Adoption chapter 3.
[2:09:01] We all want to be led by the spirit.
[2:09:05] We all want that.
[2:09:08] Just what the spirit says, do
[2:09:15] then do it quickly.
[2:09:19] That's not rushing.
[2:09:22] Uhhuh. You are just in God's time.
[2:09:28] We are not rushing about buying the
[2:09:30] church.
[2:09:34] Brother, we are rushing.
[2:09:37] We are just in God's time. When you in
[2:09:39] God's time, you are not rushing pap. No
[2:09:44] matter how fast you are,
[2:09:46] you are not rushing. How has that young
[2:09:49] fellow made it like that? Rushing.
[2:09:50] Rushing.
[2:09:52] It is easy season, brother. He's not
[2:09:56] rushing.
[2:09:58] You just watch him.
[2:10:00] Someone is rushing and someone in his
[2:10:03] season,
[2:10:04] they are different. They may be resting
[2:10:07] at the same speed.
[2:10:15] One is
[2:10:17] the other one is rushing. He's just
[2:10:19] rushing,
[2:10:21] goinghere.
[2:10:24] just what the spirit says do
[2:10:28] then do it quickly.
[2:10:32] And let us remember
[2:10:34] while we are obeying the spirit
[2:10:38] one great lesson that we want to learn
[2:10:41] is never be hastily
[2:10:45] never rush.
[2:10:48] See
[2:10:50] take your time.
[2:10:53] Have faith.
[2:10:55] If we have asked God anything
[2:11:00] brother, I have prayed.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Did you pray? Brother,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; I've prayed.
[2:11:08] But brother,
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; it is tomorrow.
[2:11:12] It is tomorrow.
[2:11:14] Brother, did you pray?
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Brother, I prayed.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; You are behaving as if you didn't pray.
[2:11:22] Because
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; he says take your time
[2:11:32] have faith.
[2:11:34] If we have asked God anything
[2:11:38] remember God answers prayer.
[2:11:43] He does it
[2:11:46] in his time. Listen
[2:11:50] the way it is best.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; You want something
[2:12:07] gives me you are rushing
[2:12:13] in his time
[2:12:16] the way it is best.
[2:12:21] makes it work just right for us.
[2:12:29] A good and faithful servant
[2:12:35] is one that waits for his master's time.
[2:12:41] God knows what is best for you
[2:12:46] and when to give it to you
[2:12:50] and how to give it to you.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; But you are rushing.
[2:12:58] That's your problem.
[2:13:00] You are Russian papa
[2:13:07] for anything of God
[2:13:10] has an appointed time.
[2:13:14] It has a season.
[2:13:17] It has a purpose
[2:13:20] and it comes through the person
[2:13:23] that he has chosen.
[2:13:26] Amen.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Not everyone you meet
[2:13:31] connection connection
[2:13:34] connection connection
[2:13:37] connection
[2:13:40] by the person he has chosen
[2:13:45] trying to do God a service without it
[2:13:47] being his will.
[2:13:52] I want to wind up here.
[2:13:55] It says
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; 1965
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; 0718
[2:14:05] M
[2:14:08] paragraph 108.
[2:14:12] I just had
[2:14:14] little bit of quotations here.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; We are together brothers and sisters.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; God is in no hurry.
[2:14:25] Is you and I that gets in a hurry
[2:14:30] said, "How great are your thoughts
[2:14:33] towards me?
[2:14:36] They cannot be numbered.
[2:14:39] You can't tell me that God is thinking
[2:14:40] about you day and night
[2:14:44] and that he has missed something."
[2:14:47] No,
[2:14:49] God hasn't missed anything.
[2:14:52] is just waiting for the appointed time.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; But now not.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. I was 108.
[2:15:08] Now not
[2:15:10] there in following God.
[2:15:13] Now I want you to kind of jot this in
[2:15:15] your mind
[2:15:18] to keep God's commandments.
[2:15:22] to do God to do anything right for God.
[2:15:29] Amen. To do God a service correctly.
[2:15:33] [Music]
[2:15:36] There is five musts
[2:15:40] to do God's service correctly.
[2:15:49] these five musts.
[2:15:52] I want you to remember this.
[2:15:56] I want you to remember this.
[2:15:59] No matter how sincere a man may be in
[2:16:03] doing it,
[2:16:08] doing goddess service,
[2:16:11] these five musts must be there
[2:16:16] first.
[2:16:18] fast.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; It must be time to do it.
[2:16:28] Oh my my.
[2:16:33] You must be in his time.
[2:16:37] It must be in his season.
[2:16:42] You got that now?
[2:16:44] It must
[2:16:47] must be his time.
[2:16:51] One,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; it must be his season.
[2:16:55] Two,
[2:16:57] it must be
[2:17:00] according to his word.
[2:17:05] That has been spoken,
[2:17:07] it must.
[2:17:11] I don't care how well you said this
[2:17:13] ought to be or that ought to be.
[2:17:17] It has got to be according to his word,
[2:17:21] according to his time and his season.
[2:17:25] Those are three. It must be according to
[2:17:28] the person he has chosen to do it by.
[2:17:34] Those are four.
[2:17:36] I don't care how much dignaries.
[2:17:42] How prepared and how ready you feel.
[2:17:44] Brother, sister,
[2:17:46] how mature you think you have grown.
[2:17:48] Brother, sister,
[2:17:54] God has a way of doing it.
[2:18:00] But you always fail to do it.
[2:18:05] It must be according to his work,
[2:18:08] according to his time, according to his
[2:18:11] program
[2:18:13] and it must be by the person he has
[2:18:15] chosen to do it
[2:18:19] and to do it.
[2:18:28] Those are four.
[2:18:30] And the pro it must be
[2:18:34] it has got to be
[2:18:38] it must come to the prophet.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; You know
[2:18:47] everything
[2:18:50] it starts right here.
[2:18:56] The vision is given to the pastor.
[2:19:01] You know he gives it out
[2:19:07] for the entire church.
[2:19:11] A vision is given to a minister
[2:19:15] for that day
[2:19:19] for that day need there
[2:19:25] for that time for someone to get
[2:19:27] something
[2:19:31] A New Testament preacher is a prophet.
[2:19:36] So those are five musts.
[2:19:40] But he says first it must be his time.
[2:19:46] Second is his season.
[2:19:48] Again the man he has chosen today
[2:19:51] and then it has to be according to his
[2:19:53] word.
[2:19:54] And then he says it has got to come to
[2:19:57] his prophet.
[2:20:00] But
[2:20:02] you rush papa.
[2:20:11] It's so unfortunate
[2:20:14] that the people often times miss God in
[2:20:16] his time
[2:20:21] and wait for him to come in their time.
[2:20:26] God has put times and seasons in his own
[2:20:29] power.
[2:20:32] The Bible says shall come to pass in the
[2:20:34] last days.
[2:20:38] Second Peter 3, there shall come
[2:20:40] mockers.
[2:20:42] They say where is the promise of his
[2:20:43] coming?
[2:20:46] Since our fathers died,
[2:20:51] he has not come.
[2:20:54] He has not come.
[2:20:57] He says this. They are willingly
[2:20:59] ignorant.
[2:21:06] But the Lord is not slack concerning his
[2:21:08] promise.
[2:21:16] A day a thousand years is like one day
[2:21:19] before God.
[2:21:26] So he he's not he's in no hurry.
[2:21:32] The Lord will come in his own appointed
[2:21:34] time,
[2:21:38] his own time which he has appointed.
[2:21:47] You will start to complain
[2:21:50] and mama
[2:21:53] because you are rushing.
[2:21:57] Brother, God is not in a hurry.
[2:22:05] Brother Job, brother Job. Brother Job
[2:22:08] [Music]
[2:22:16] way.
[2:22:17] Just your home. You a boy. You
[2:22:20] brothers are like this
[2:22:23] mommies.
[2:22:26] Leave that child.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Calm down. God is hurry.
[2:22:38] God is in no hurry.
[2:22:42] Always
[2:22:48] remember
[2:22:51] before you rush someone
[2:22:55] you've also ever been there.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; So don't rush someone
[2:23:00] and don't rush yourself.
[2:23:03] God is in no hurry.
[2:23:06] I'm emphasizing that
[2:23:09] because we always try to rush
[2:23:14] as it was then
[2:23:17] the people waited for the Messiah.
[2:23:20] They knew that he was coming.
[2:23:24] The Bible says the prophets searched out
[2:23:29] what time the Messiah was coming,
[2:23:33] but he could not come
[2:23:35] until the f the time that was appointed
[2:23:39] was full
[2:23:43] and now I wanted to hear
[2:23:46] I don't know I think it's now I've taken
[2:23:48] one hour
[2:23:52] just get done here.
[2:23:54] I want to tell brothers and sisters,
[2:23:58] God won't give you anything
[2:24:02] until the time appointed
[2:24:06] has come to the fullness.
[2:24:11] Do you think the world didn't need a
[2:24:15] savior?
[2:24:17] Why was God waiting
[2:24:20] for all those years?
[2:24:23] Well, the world needed a savior
[2:24:26] right that very day in the garden.
[2:24:30] Why did he slay the lamb,
[2:24:33] take them by shadows?
[2:24:36] It had an appointed time.
[2:24:42] Why God is in no hurry?
[2:24:44] I wonder
[2:24:46] why isn't he in a hurry
[2:24:50] because
[2:24:52] everything
[2:24:53] he has ordained it for ordained it
[2:24:58] fixed
[2:25:01] he can't change it
[2:25:06] can't change my destiny
[2:25:11] that's not in the believers he's not
[2:25:13] going to change the destiny.
[2:25:16] It's already fixed.
[2:25:19] I know my destiny.
[2:25:23] Colossians 4:1-5.
[2:25:30] Now I say
[2:25:32] that the hair
[2:25:36] as long as he is a child
[2:25:40] defant.
[2:25:46] though he be lord of all
[2:25:50] but God has given us all these things
[2:25:53] but it looks as if we are like all these
[2:25:55] other don't have God
[2:26:01] as long as he is a child He found
[2:26:04] nothing for my servants.
[2:26:10] He wants you to grow.
[2:26:17] You know
[2:26:19] some believers.
[2:26:21] They have the Holy Spirit.
[2:26:25] It's not about their spiritual growth,
[2:26:29] but naturally
[2:26:33] your natural age also has an effect on
[2:26:36] how you behave.
[2:26:39] Whether you have the Holy Spirit or not,
[2:26:45] like it or not, it has an effect on how
[2:26:48] you behave.
[2:26:52] but is under tutors and governors.
[2:26:58] As long as is a child does not differ
[2:26:59] from a servant,
[2:27:03] but is under tutors and governance
[2:27:07] until the time appointed of the father.
[2:27:16] until the time
[2:27:18] appointed
[2:27:20] by the childh
[2:27:28] being tutored.
[2:27:31] Don't rush. Allow God to tutor you
[2:27:35] until the appointed time
[2:27:38] for your marriage, for your job, for
[2:27:41] your ministry,
[2:27:43] whatever you desire and long for,
[2:27:46] God is in no hurry.
[2:27:52] Even so we
[2:27:54] when we were children who are in bondage
[2:27:58] under the elements of the world.
[2:28:02] But when the fullness of the time was
[2:28:04] come,
[2:28:06] when the fullness of the time was come,
[2:28:12] God sent forth his son
[2:28:15] made of a woman made under the law to
[2:28:18] redeem them that were under the law.
[2:28:22] might receive the adoption of Jesus.
[2:28:25] He waited till the fullness of time.
[2:28:31] My dear sister,
[2:28:33] don't rush your husband. Brother, don't
[2:28:35] rush your wife. Preacher, don't rush the
[2:28:38] members.
[2:28:40] Don't rush the people. I preached about
[2:28:43] this yesterday.
[2:28:47] I brush that in the overnight
[2:28:50] still rushing
[2:28:51] and then I'm also rushing.
[2:28:56] There is a season of everyone.
[2:29:00] God only demands you to believe it.
[2:29:03] God's in no hurry. It's you and I who
[2:29:09] try to hurry up that way. But as long as
[2:29:13] God has spoken,
[2:29:15] it is as good as done.
[2:29:18] But the people want to plant today
[2:29:23] and a vest the next day.
[2:29:26] Impatient,
[2:29:28] get rich overnight,
[2:29:31] gambling,
[2:29:33] you will get poor the following morning.
[2:29:39] The power of the devil.
[2:29:42] Watch little things when they boil up
[2:29:46] and start at first.
[2:29:49] You know, mushrooms
[2:29:52] grow up overnight
[2:29:54] and die the next day.
[2:29:58] Take a long time. It takes a long time
[2:30:01] for an old oak to come.
[2:30:09] But he is really rooted.
[2:30:14] ungrounded
[2:30:16] when he gets there.
[2:30:20] God doesn't want to take you up there
[2:30:22] and everyone looks at you and they say,
[2:30:25] "Glory, glory. Really this man has God.
[2:30:29] Then before you know, you are down." You
[2:30:33] bring a li the name of Christ.
[2:30:37] You got to be rooted and grounded.
[2:30:40] not like mushroom.
[2:30:44] Allow God to take you one step at a
[2:30:46] time.
[2:30:49] It will give you experience.
[2:30:51] It will build your confidence
[2:30:55] and you will appreciate yourself.
[2:30:59] Wait for God to open the door.
[2:31:04] Don't try to do it yourself.
[2:31:11] Brother, God has done it for brothers.
[2:31:23] He's seeing you.
[2:31:25] But your time is not my time. It's not
[2:31:29] brother.
[2:31:31] You also have your time.
[2:31:34] And when I get tired,
[2:31:36] you also have to come with strength. And
[2:31:38] when you also get tired
[2:31:41] also come with enough strength.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; And for that
[2:31:48] wait to God open that door.
[2:31:53] Don't try to do it yourself
[2:31:56] because it won't work.
[2:32:00] Sometimes we think we are delayed.
[2:32:05] And we think we have been denied.
[2:32:12] But what I can say,
[2:32:14] it was simply divinely interrupted.
[2:32:21] Just a divine interruption.
[2:32:24] God is delays are not deniers.
[2:32:30] God will always make a way.
[2:32:34] I'm done, brother. Where there is no
[2:32:36] way,
[2:32:38] God is
[2:32:41] uh
[2:32:45] God will always make a way
[2:32:49] or else.
[2:32:51] He will become the way
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; where there is no way
[2:32:58] in his own way
[2:33:01] and in his own time.
[2:33:05] He makes a way where there is no way in
[2:33:09] his own way and his own time because his
[2:33:13] ways are not your ways and his ways are
[2:33:18] past finding out.
[2:33:26] God is the season
[2:33:28] is your right season. God is the time is
[2:33:33] your right time. Blessed is that man
[2:33:37] that med the word of God day and night
[2:33:40] is like a tree planted by the
[2:33:44] which bring forth in his season fruit.
[2:33:49] Amen.
[2:33:50] in his season,
[2:33:53] in the season of God.
[2:33:56] The problem with the fig tree,
[2:33:59] I wondered why did Jesus cast the fig
[2:34:03] tree for not having fruits.
[2:34:07] It was not yet the time of fixing.
[2:34:14] Little pastor told me,
[2:34:16] "Brother,
[2:34:18] it was not yet the time of figs
[2:34:21] to bring forth fruits, but it was the
[2:34:24] time of God
[2:34:26] to seek a fruit from the fig tree.
[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:32] It's not about brother, it's not my
[2:34:34] time. It's not my time. I'm still young.
[2:34:36] I'm still young. I'm old. I'm
[2:34:39] If it's God the time,
[2:34:41] brother, you are in danger. Two fruits,
[2:34:44] brother.
[2:34:49] Mr. M's impatency.
[2:34:54] Mr. and Mrs. impatency.
[2:35:06] If you are here,
[2:35:09] I'm calling your attention now
[2:35:12] to a courty trial.
[2:35:19] Let us sit now in a courty.
[2:35:24] Mr. and Mrs.
[2:35:29] I want to bring your attention to this.
[2:35:33] the trial.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; I read in the name of the Lord,
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; paragraph 68,
[2:35:49] he says, uh,
[2:35:56] I'm done. I'm done just here.
[2:35:59] this.
[2:36:00] So, Mr. Impatient
[2:36:04] or Mrs. Impatient
[2:36:08] comes and he claims
[2:36:11] remember we are in a trial.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; The prosecutor
[2:36:16] is the devil. Now, the prosecutor is Mr.
[2:36:19] Impatience and Mrs. Impatience is the
[2:36:22] one we want to look at now.
[2:36:32] So
[2:36:34] impatience
[2:36:36] and he claims
[2:36:39] that he one day was reading the Bible.
[2:36:43] He didn't go to churches
[2:36:46] but he was a believer.
[2:36:50] So one of them went to an evangelist
[2:36:55] and the other one went to a pastor.
[2:36:57] This fellow was just a secret believer.
[2:37:02] He stayed home and he went and he was
[2:37:05] reading in Mark
[2:37:07] the 11th chapter the second and 23rd
[2:37:11] verse
[2:37:14] where Jesus himself claiming to be God
[2:37:19] made his statement with his own lips.
[2:37:23] Every I say unto you, whosoever shall
[2:37:26] say to this mountain,
[2:37:28] be moved and don't doubt in your heart,
[2:37:33] but believe that what you have said will
[2:37:35] come to pass.
[2:37:37] You can have what you have said.
[2:37:41] And he said also that
[2:37:44] when you pray, believe that you receive
[2:37:48] what you ask for it shall be given to
[2:37:50] you.
[2:37:51] He says
[2:37:55] has been lame in his feet
[2:38:00] for about 25 years.
[2:38:04] And five years ago
[2:38:07] while sitting in a room
[2:38:10] feeling that he was inspired
[2:38:14] to read the word which he claims he
[2:38:16] believed.
[2:38:18] And with all his heart he believed.
[2:38:21] it and he then said with his own voice
[2:38:30] in my legs in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:38:36] leave me
[2:38:38] he said
[2:38:40] and that's been five years ago
[2:38:44] and is just as crippled as he ever was.
[2:38:48] Oh, therefore,
[2:38:51] Mr. Mrs. impatient wants to put his
[2:38:53] testimony against the word
[2:38:57] saying the word is not a valid.
[2:39:01] He wants to put it against the Bible
[2:39:03] being the inspired word
[2:39:07] and he says that this promise is not
[2:39:09] true.
[2:39:10] He has tested it and it wasn't true.
[2:39:22] Therefore,
[2:39:27] now the defense witness comes
[2:39:31] because we have to defend this the word
[2:39:34] now.
[2:39:36] We want Mr. Mrs. Impatient here
[2:39:42] that fellow that has been rushing.
[2:39:45] We want to free you from that spirit.
[2:39:50] He wants you this call this court his
[2:39:52] attention again
[2:39:55] the defense witness
[2:39:58] the the Holy Spirit.
[2:40:01] He wants to call this court and show you
[2:40:03] that the promises
[2:40:08] is only to believers
[2:40:12] not make believers.
[2:40:16] not impatient
[2:40:18] or skeptics.
[2:40:24] It is to believers only
[2:40:29] not to the impatient.
[2:40:34] If you have got real genuine faith,
[2:40:38] you will have real genuine patience.
[2:40:44] Patience,
[2:40:46] patience.
[2:40:48] It says in the message shalom,
[2:40:51] patience, patience.
[2:40:54] Some of us get so in such a hurry.
[2:40:59] I think many a good man has done that.
[2:41:03] You get in too much of a hurry
[2:41:09] because you want to do it yourself.
[2:41:13] Let us stand on our feet
[2:41:16] as I read James chapter 5 here
[2:41:20] verse 7
[2:41:22] to 11 he says
[2:41:25] be patient therefore
[2:41:28] brethren
[2:41:30] to the coming of the Lord.
[2:41:32] Behold
[2:41:34] the husbandman
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; waits for the precious fruit of the
[2:41:39] earth.
[2:41:42] and has longer patience for it
[2:41:47] until he receives the early and later.
[2:41:53] Be also patient.
[2:41:58] Est establish your hearts
[2:42:04] for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.
[2:42:09] Grudge not one against another,
[2:42:13] brethren, lest you be condemned.
[2:42:18] Behold, the judge stands before the
[2:42:21] door.
[2:42:23] Take my brethren,
[2:42:26] the prophets who have spoken in the name
[2:42:29] of the Lord
[2:42:32] for an example of suffering, affliction,
[2:42:35] and of patience.
[2:42:40] Behold,
[2:42:41] we count them happy which endure.
[2:42:45] [Music]
[2:42:47] You have heard of the patience of Job
[2:42:51] and you have seen that the end of the
[2:42:54] Lord
[2:42:56] that the Lord is very pitiful
[2:43:00] and of tender mercies
[2:43:04] as a father pies his children.
[2:43:08] The Lord pies them that he loves.
[2:43:14] Brother, sister,
[2:43:17] God is in no hurry.
[2:43:23] Teach me Lord
[2:43:26] to wait
[2:43:28] down

[2:57:37] Amen. As we are going to approach
[2:57:39] prayer,
[2:57:41] you know the message we have heard
[2:57:42] tonight,
[2:57:45] I believe that you can tell it has been
[2:57:47] inspired of the Lord
[2:57:51] and it is it has been spiritual food in
[2:57:53] your season.
[2:57:55] [Music]
[2:57:56] I believe this is the season
[2:57:59] that God wanted you to hear that.
[2:58:02] Maybe you might have been discouraged
[2:58:05] or maybe things are happening slower
[2:58:07] than you wanted them to.
[2:58:10] Maybe you have questions about your
[2:58:12] life.
