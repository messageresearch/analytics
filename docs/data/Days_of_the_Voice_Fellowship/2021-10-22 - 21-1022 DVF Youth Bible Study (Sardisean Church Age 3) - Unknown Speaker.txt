time today in the church it was quite a wonderful moment so tonight this evening we continue with our study on this additional church age and uh just like to go straight away to where we are stopped the last time we gathered where was that okay so i'm gonna project this here did you finish the salutation oh we did so are we gonna go to that demonstration that's what we're studying i think we did not go through the entire situation and we cover a little bit okay so you have your chat input as well as this broad here is for us i thought especially online this is actually good when let this read around paul was the first messenger and he said in galatians one eight that if any angel any paul was the first messenger and he said in galatians 1 8 that if any angel any messenger any vicar no matter who he was if he preached any other gospel than what paul preached let him be accursed paul knew that after he was gone grievous wolves would come in he knew that satan himself could appear as an angel of light so how much more his ministers so he warns that this gospel would always be the same now paul had baptized in jesus name and rebaptized where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till jesus came thus the next messengers all the remaining six would by the same holy ghost burn with the same fire and give the same light of the gospel of jesus christ and the signs would follow them did irony is qualify yes did martin yes did columba yes did martin luther most assuredly did wesley yes sir he had a great ministry and even prayed for his horse to get well and it did there you are seven church ages and seven messengers who were alike and paul pronounced a curse on anyone who said he was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light now does that last statement of mine bear up with the rest of the word yes it says in the word that if any man adds to this book or takes from it he would be plagued and judged unto condemnation by god god said i will add the plagues written in this book or i will take his part out of the book of life revelation 22 18 so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of god working out the will and word of god in different generations i would like to illustrate that from the word the spirit of god was mightily upon elijah then that same spirit came upon elisha in a two-fold effect then centuries later the same spirit which we call the spirit of elijah in order to describe its ministry came back upon john the baptist one day that same spirit identified by the same manner of ministry will come upon a man for the end of the gentile church age again the scripture says that god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and power and he went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil as jesus went away he told his disciples to tarry until pentecost at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them then that called out body the church would be in his stead upon the earth taking his place and because that same spirit that was in him would be in them they would do the very same word you remember the other part where brother was saying that the mystery of the of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation and they say but christ the same christ in you doing it very well with the very words so here we notice that some people because they say that okay the baptism of the holy spirit come without sensation so therefore they say you need to be very cold and dead like the preacher was preaching yesterday you find the church it's very cold and today there's no life at all no if you need you have that same spirit which was in christ the rest crashed from the dead it's going to quicken your motorboat not only when you are winning the eruption but it will begin weakening you when you are streaming whereby you will not be called for more and all dead but it says that that that very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and feel them then that called out body the church would be in jesus taking his place meaning that the church is the pope okay forget about the teaching of the roman catholic church which say that the pope has this he is the one who is instead of the son of god in this case we are learning here that it is going to be the church the world church together not one member of it but the world church together will be having that jesus christ then the call of the group the corrupt body of the church will be on this earth in his state meaning they'll be here instead of the son of god they will be here because where is the holy spirit the only spirit on earth right this is the holy spirit which is here instead of the sound but that holy spirit is not in trees or in the air that spirit is in the people the church and therefore that church will be the one here on this earth instead of the son of god so the pope wants to play the opposition the pope the pope wants to claim your authority you he wants to claim your position it's not the pope it is you do you that is here in jesus christ all right so then it says that that same script that was in him in who in christ would be in them who the church they would not do that they would do do the very same ones by the way when we say the spirit of christ be or dwell in you and um that all that was in part in you not you as a single member of the body that's why we need one another i cannot say that i i as myself i'm enough i don't i need you you need me we need one another in the body of christ just like you you cannot walk while leaving your or your arms behind you are following you everywhere you go yes because okay so because the body of jesus christ is a full body with all the members of the body in that body so therefore when we say the word is in the body it is the holy spirit in each and every one of us connected have you ever had the settlement coming together three can you use a bit louder voice how did the holy spirit come down in form of fire and then when he came in as a in a form of fire where did he go like as in one fire he split himself so each person got he said he says it was a tango fire a leak of fire a legal fire a leak of fire a little fight now when you are all together you are bringing together all your needs of fire together so you can buy that's why whenever we are together as children of god there is a fire there is a shout the shadow of the king is always in the camp why because you are all coming together but when you are alone and then when you your brother comes and guarantees you when an accident when we come together like that as children of god we are very dangerous to the kingdom and any people that is truly the body of jesus christ the true church will manifest jesus and the pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them the true church what we do what did jesus do one by one he knew that what else he calmed the storm what else he made a limb to walk turn the water into wine miracles yes he did he designed he raised the dead he lived a glamorous life he asked people said who can judge me you see who can condemn me no one would condemn you the cast of devils yes what else praise the lepers yes the men that are blind you see now each of you can literally remember what the worst people have done through you begin huh one we are not saying that the holy spirit is doing for you you are saying what has been doing through you for others or for you even doing it through you one you you're praying for someone before they got healed amen what else you see now that what i've written here and any people any person here that is truly the bodyguard just read this as if you're reading it for the organization it for yourself any person just put your name there if i am truly the body of jesus christ the true church should manifest the same wax as jesus did so if i ask you what works have you manifested and you are quiet it means can you answer the question it means it estimates please can you answer me this is here right here we are already believing it but yet it means peace yes it means you are an alien because they have a pastor abused that you go to all of us aliens understand if the devil came in somebody cuts it out someone was going to die he raised him up someone there he raised him up the storm came he calmly done by the spoken word i tell you sick somewhere someone comes to you please my child said oh just pick the one all right they're trying to go okay the child becomes fine these are the words that jesus did and also he says not only jesus people also those once we are done in the pain they cause a charge of peterborough what did we see their shadows raising the dead their shadows hearing the sick they were imprisoned and the the lord would you know come and they set them free you know some of them they even suffered because of the name of jesus christ many works miracles were done signs and wonders were done in their lives so now we need to find out you personally find out where are those words how can those works be made manifest in you when you are too busy how many times did you go back to review those sounds that you felt you needed to hear more orders something that you you reviewed you listen again or even other channels of many but how many do that is for them one day what do you think what do you use you use youtube for what let's be quiet as if you don't use youtube some people they're saying for only songs others even for worldly things why do you use youtube for all right you're too busy with your youtube your jeep is for with facebook first of all by the way it was banned in you can but uh people still have a way of accessing it they say the actors i wonder how they access well you're saying you use vpn you have too much time for vpn and facebook imagine something is blocked but you have time for it you still go and unlock it you have time for it but you don't have time to pray you don't have time to read the word you don't have time to seek the face of god jesus was a prayerful man imagine it's good but you would pray what about you is not even good at all so if we want those better words to be my manifest in our lives to first manifest that so we can identify ourselves as that research we have to create that atmosphere we are the ones who can create that atmosphere no one is going to create that atmosphere for us we you see the kind of life we live the kind of like you know each of you you know that kind of life you live in secret especially when no one is there that kind of life can hinder you meet christ or it can make you beat christ himself how he was able to overcome certain things he says he's not he who overcame them so what happened with him he can give a testimony and say jesus christ who overcame those things so it means you have to live a life of total surrender in order for these things to happen in your life because this is not just a story it is a reality it is a real star friends hallelujah praise the lord okay can you try to increase your volume uh this person online says they can't hear i do not think that there is a reason why it's not here okay what about now is that fine now okay you need to write back and let me know if that is fine okay so any other chart that does not have the spirit read it for yourself what does any church any church any person okay can you read it like this if i don't have the spirit and i'll continue if you do not have the spirit and the higher manifestations not only one but manifestation you read you are going to have to account for god some people have made this message as if it is a baptist church you know just to go on here be elected right now the true church is no longer going only for those things to be lectured it's more than that the true church is going for the true spirit and the true manifestation of the spirit and we now continue let us just it also says here that these seven stars or seven messengers to the seven ages are in his hand he is holding them you know right away that if they are held in his hand they are associated with his power that is what the hand signifies it signifies the power of god and authority of god not one of them came in his own power and authority that is what paul said no man would dare to it takes the authority of god and the power of the holy ghost there is something i wanted to see there uh it says what does the arm represent and the power and authority so when god when he says that he is seated on the right hand of god jesus is sitting on the right hand off what does it mean ah please can you answer is seated at the right hand of the majesty of my it means he is now lifted into a position of power and great authority right now he has power and authority by the way that one comes to show the power in the name because right now when you call upon the name of jesus you receive what you need the heal basically the bounds are delivered why because it's in the right hand he right now he has the old authority right now he has all power all power is given to me in heaven and then right hand wonderful no man would dare to it takes the authority of god and the power of the holy ghost the gospel is preached by the authority of god in the power of the spirit these men were all empowered by the holy ghost they all stood up to the world they could do that they were full of god they were sent or authorized by god not by self or other men now they had what the world could not have jesus said that when he went away he would send his spirit which the world could not receive that is right the world or world systems could not receive him that is what organization is it is world system show me a world system church that is full of the holy ghost i want to see it if you can show me such a church you are finding a mistake in the word no sir not one of these messengers was organized either they were put out or got out because they were convicted of the sin of organization how can the holy spirit possibly be an organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit and denominations take the place of the word remember organization is death it just can't be any other way if the world takes over the spirit departs yes the spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at pentecost by experience it will be a pentecostal church amen and there will be tongues and interpretation and prophecy and healings god will be in the midst of her and god will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that okay can you please i want us to read these things by our own mouth yes we begin there yes [Music] did you hear that yes by the experience so we are going to be praying the cultures in other words by experience not by organization or denomination so are we pentecostals yeah what is pentecost can someone tell me what it means no one among us can tell you what petabus means jesus okay okay what is better cause me do you know that the jews have the first offenders when that day of pentecost was fully calm so pedophilia right what day was it pentecost was a day do we agree yes now it was a fist that the jews used to keep and in the book of acts chapters 2 when that there are pentecost read them up and there quickly quickly read acts 2. i stepped up two [Music] okay you need to tell me if my sound is fine now please is everybody there brother you okay yeah go ahead verse one yes everyone who's there hungry when the day of them with all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they they appeared unto them proven tongues as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began and when the day of pentecost was forget about the holy spirit and jesus this day was already there before the holy spirit and jesus brother can you explain what what you're trying to say because you know it but you're not explaining it can you explain it for the people i think it was they were keeping it as a feast they were what were they celebrating uh because there was people who were bound those who were slaves do you people know what the year of jubilee is [Music] what please okay they used to count sabbath mm-hmm given can you explain what this man is explaining you are living without knowing what it means seriously all right can you first before you explain what the mother was explaining all right so brother marvin has explained very important points partners points there's much we can cover about that and um now the pentecostal people has told and i'll probably get back plenty back on this but i must be honest i've got to come to the one there is no such a thing as starting meeting you've been in ever thirty doesn't mean praying third means to wait after the ascension after jesus christ the crucifixion decreasing of the sanctuary and after that the day of our turn of the atonement the resurrection the day of their tournament when he was killed and then it's 40 days until the ascension and then pentecost now the word pentecost means 50. it means 50 days after offering of day of the atonement and then after the atonement was offered everything had to come out perfect later geographically everything else has got saved and pentecost it was a jubilee time like the battle of spain when they brought the first fruits of the harvest in and had a jubilee now the first views of the church the oligos charge the child that was to last these two thousand years still did us come the first few come at peterborough it was 10 days before pentecost time it was 40 days after the cleansing after the killing of the sacrifice until the ascension of jesus christ he said go after you and wait until you endured with power on high let us see what it says here in the organizing you are then dismissed in 1964. now we noticed last sunday preaching the first days and there was a feast you should listen to the message the feast of the tablets and there was a feast of pentecost and between the feast of pentecost and the feast of trumpets that was a long period of time exactly 50 days between pentecost and the feast of the trumpets and 53 days which pentecost means 50. it was the sheep waving the first frames of their harvest was brought in and we see it was in a tight back there with the natural first fruits representing the first phrase of the holy spirit to be powered out upon the people now of course us as gentile church to us it means uh the outpowering of the holy spirit because that was a time of uh that was a jubilee time he said go and wait by the way from the time that uh from the time he died and it rose it took the italic from how long did they wait how long have they said these things here they were they found many days you know when jesus christ rose from the dead from the grave the bible says that those people were on the streets of how many days but okay you don't know how long they were in the streets of jerusalem how long was it no no i'm talking about the ones who were dead when jesus first died the ones who were dead and they rose up 40 days and jesus when he rose up he appeared to the disciples and he told them to do what to tarry in the upper room they died for how many days 10 days to make 50 days and when the day of pentecost was fully come it was it was fully come on the 50th in the 50s yeah in this case which is the 50th day the fifth is pentecost and that was the day of peters which was actually they used even until the days and maybe we will check segments go through the first days one by one by one by one of course this is to the jews but also to show us in the past it will show us our [Music] just like the uh what we covered last time about the 70 weeks of dania it is for the jews but also as the gentiles it shows us where we are you understand so you can say that the jewish the jews jewish days we point to us the gentiles where we are in the timeline of god so this 15 pentecost was the jewish day but we as gentiles can also pick our food there to see that that's the day that the holy spirit came on the day of how many people came on that day when the holy spirit came three thousand people do you think otherwise it would come because of this of waiting only those who are waiting where 120 matters [Music] why did all the others come from all over the world because that was a great decision they would just come in there for business for other things you know but it was the celebrations of his life so but that's the day that also the holy spirit comes in my mind what a wonderful time it was because that jesus was also targeted physically speaking when everybody is there so they can hear the message father god has a way of doing things you seem to speak english because god ensured that business becoming english they measure that is that the colonized i mean that you the british people recognize that almost half of the world the mission that is will also come from the english so that's so that the message of the cross handbook almost all over the world now today alabama had to come from america because america was our superpower in our generation and anything from there when it just goes by the bottom said anything from hollywood comes from hollywood and goes all over the world how and why because all eyes are on on america that's why i also got ensure that his messenger for the last gladiation church age will come from america so that since all either on america they will not be able to visit if the messenger came from uganda so you have to come from a country where all eyes are fixed upon so we notice friends that the day of pentecost was the day that was the main fifth peter was rather better was 250 and 50 minutes jubilee and that's the day that our powering of the holidays came and from that time we know that when we said that we are doing the customers in a way we mean we have people who believe in the spirit of god we are people who believe in the outpower in the spirit we have people who believe in tongues because actually times the fire came fast on their pentecost so we are people who believe in tongues manifestation of the spirit of god and the miraculous and the power of god and where people who believe we are free we are liberated we are not bound by organization and denomination we are not in organized religion we are simply free we understand we are peter costas hmm some people when you tell them that they will become sick for us we are glad to know we are what not better cause by division but pentecostals by what and interpretation and prophecy and did you see that man who came on susan we prayed for him and god delivered him those things we are seeing them in our midst god is delivering the people god is healing people miracles are happening we see prophecies everywhere you know god is moving you know why because we are not trooping across the church we want to even see times in our church here if you're one of those that god is dealing with and uh don't cross your mouth open your mouth and let god use you all right because we believe in these things according to this message these are not my words are they my words this is the message you believe unless you are telling me they don't believe it maybe they just entered it himself in the midst of our and then he says hallelujah and she will be don't forget she will be unorganized okay let's now we can see that jesus christ is revealing himself through the ages by his spirit in the messengers they are as moses was to the children of israel as he had the revelation for his day so each messenger had god's revelation and ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power it is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough that we see the five-fold ministry of ephesians four apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep then god brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth god is in his people all of his people for if any man has not the spirit of christ he is none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognized in the people but he has placed a special leadership in these men of his own choosing and through the determined counsel of his own will they appear once in each age it is the same spirit in them what a far cry is this from the heresy of rome they have a man of their own choosing one after the other none producing the power of god none abiding in the word of god each one differing from the one before him and adding what he desires as though he were god god is not in it but he is in his messenger and he who would have the fullness of god would follow the messenger as the messenger is a follower of the lord by his word he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars revelation three one as this same lord identified himself with man in the incarnation he is again identifying himself with man by his spirit within man these are mine saith the lord the seven spirit-filled messengers are the lords they may be repudiated they may be questioned indeed to human minds they may not even seem to qualify nevertheless they are the messengers for their age god used an abraham he lied he used a moses he rebelled a jonah he disobeyed a samson he sinned a david he murdered he also used a joshua and a joseph and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose histories seem to be perfect all were and are his none dare deny that he used them by and through the holy spirit that he put within them to their own master they stood or fell and in them all was accomplished the sovereign will of god let external history attempt to refute this it still stands the eternal god still walks amongst the golden lamp stands and sends his messengers by his spirit with the word to the people of every age the denunciation revelation 3 1 be i know thy works that thou has a name that thou livest and are dead revelation 3 2 be for i have not found thy works perfect before god now here indeed is a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praised the true believers and then denounced the false vine but in this period there is evidently such wanton disregard for the lord and his word that the entire message to this fifth age rings with condemnation i know thy works what were these works that came up before the lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each age lapped over into the next stage so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth these works as you are well aware were one the leadership of the holy spirit was superseded by a human hierarchy two the pure word of god and its free benefit to all men was deposed for creeds dogmas church orders etc three the worship in the spirit and gifts of the spirit and all that which pertains to true community fellowship of the saints was cast aside for liturgy and literal idol worship pagan feasts etc four mariola tree was assuming a greater place in the christian worship until she had actually assumed a place of godhead and the son was brought from his lofty position of over all to being subservient to a man called the pope who termed himself the vicar of christ those who fought this terrible antichrist church were destroyed those who stayed with it found themselves the pawn of the church whether they be peasants or kings their lives were not their own and neither were their lives christ's but they belonged body soul and spirit to the church of rome they talked about the blood of christ yet they purchased their salvation with money and bought forgiveness of sins either by gold or penance the wealthier of them founded a happy situation when pope leo the tenth allowed them to buy indulgences for sins not yet committed so that they with ease of conscience could plan their awful crimes and then proceed to carry them out knowing that the pope had already remitted their sins the word of god was kept from them so who was to know the truth since truth comes only from the word the people were shut up in a dungeon of the roman church awaiting death and after death the judgment but the great drunk with the blood of martyrs and with no thought of the judgment reeled savagely on to kill men with both spiritual and physical death now toward the end of the fourth age which would be the beginning of the fifth age also the invasion of constantinople by the turks sent the learned scholars of the east with their greek manuscripts to the west the purity of the word and the teachings of true believers were thus disseminated and not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the basis of our modern printing presses was discovered facilitating the production of books thus we find the great hunger and demand for the bible could be answered god raised up many mighty men of which luther was but one calvin and swingley were two other luminaries and besides these were many many more who are not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty work of god was actually hindered by these very men for one thing they did not oppose the church state marriage of the nicene council but actually fostered that union the defense of the gospel by the state was welcome though there was no word for it and though we can see the wrath of man praising god in such events as henry viii taking up for the reformation and the rejection of papal authority it was a far cry from the truth of pentecost and protection of an omnipotent god in spite of luther's constant teaching against outside interference in local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop archbishop concept of church government thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remained shackled so in short order she was again imprisoned in the same dungeon when she had attempted to escape still the cup of the abominable works was not yet full not only did luther through poor judgment insight to battle and thereby caused the death of multitudes but singley's party persecuted unto prison the godly dr hubmeyer and though it did not commit him to the stake it was actually responsible in great measure for his eventual death by fire and calvin did no less for he demanded the arrest of servatus who had seen and taught the oneness of the godhead the state then tried this brother and to calvin's dismay he was burned at the stake if there was ever a time of denominational zeal it was at this tragic time the words of comenius describe much of this era comenus wrote the one thing needful he compares the world to the labyrinth and shows that the way out is by leaving what is needless and choosing the one thing needful christ the great number of teachers he says is the reason of the multitudes of sects for which we shall soon have no names left each church reckons itself as the true one or at least as the purest truest part of it while among themselves they persecute each other with the bitterest hatred no reconciliation is to be hoped for between them they meet enmity with irreconcilable enmity out of the bible they forged their different creeds these are their fortresses and bulwarks behind which they entrench themselves and resist all attacks i will not say that these confessions of faith for we can admit in most cases that they are so are bad in themselves they become so however in that they feed the fire of enmity only by putting them away altogether would it be possible to set to work on healing the wounds of the church to this labyrinth of sects and various confessions and other belongs the love of disputation what is attained by it has a single learned strife ever been settled never their number has only been increased satan is the greatest sophist he has never been overcome in a strife of words in divine service the words of men are usually heard more than the word of god each one chatters as he pleases or kills time by learned disquisitions and disproving the views of others of the new birth and how a man must be changed into the likeness of christ to become partaker of the divine nature second peter 1 4 scarcely anything is said of the power of the keys the church has almost lost the power of binding only the power of loosing remains the sacraments given as symbols of unity of love and of our life in christ have been made the occasion of bitterest conflict a cause of mutual hatred a center of sectarianism in short christendom has become a labyrinth the faith has been split into a thousand little parts and you are made a heretic if there is one of them you do not accept what can help only the one thing needful return to christ looking to christ as the only leader and walking in his footsteps setting aside all other ways until we reach the goal and have come to the unity of the faith ephesians 4 13 as the heavenly master built everything on the ground of the scriptures so should we leave all particularities of our special confessions and be satisfied with the revealed word of god which belongs to us all with the bible in our hand we should cry i believe what god has revealed in this book i will obediently keep his commands i hope for that which he has promised christians give ear there is only one life but death comes to us in a thousand forms there is only one christ but a thousand antichrists so thou knowest o christendom what is the one thing needful either thou turnest back to christ or thou goest to destruction like the antichrist if thou art wise and wilt live follow the leader of life but you christians rejoice in your being caught up hear the words of your heavenly leader come unto me answer with one voice even so we come now i just said that this era gave tremendous growth to the denominational spirit if the corinthian attitude of i am of paul i of cephas was ever exhibited it was now there were lutherans hussites swingly's party etc such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matrimony to the state that did it they were finished here were those lutherans who had criticized the roman church they knew the unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet luther as when peter was over balanced by the judaizers went right ahead and made the state instead of god the defender of the faith this is the first denomination of repute that came out of the harlot but when luther died it was not long until it had a hierarchy like the one it had fought this move of god by the time the second generation came along was right back under the wing of her mother she had gone back and did not even know it they had taken on their own name above his name they were living their own name too and all the denominations are doing that very thing today they are living their own name and not the name of the lord jesus christ that is easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but none are known by the power of god there is your test and i want you to notice right here that this era did not have the signs and wonders amongst them they gave up the power of god for the power of the state they clung to their own name they made their names great it was that old spirit of getting everyone into its fold today the baptists want the methodists to come over to the baptists the methodists are out to proselytize the presbyterians and the pentecostals want them all each claims to offer the most and to hold out the greatest hopes a sort of door to heaven or at least the way to a more abundant entrance how tragic it all is this denominational spirit has made all the denominations write their manuals and teach their creeds set up their offices and church governments and then each claims that she and she alone truly speaks for god as she is the best qualified now if that isn't exactly what the pope and the roman church are doing they are right back there with their mother the harlot and don't know it in closing our comments on this verse thou has to name that thou livest and are dead i cannot impress a so it brought the reformation by god instead of being praised because it sewed the seed of denomination that organized right back to the harlot after god had opened a door of escape when the move away from the catholic church took place it was not truly spiritual as a whole but more political most of the people took up with protestantism because as i have stated they hated the roman system of political and financial bondage thus instead of this being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of holy spirit influence as when god used purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at pentecost it was indeed a work wherein the wrath of man praised god and the results paralleled the history of israel when she left egypt and wandered in the desert not making it to canaan land however much was accomplished in that where the yoke of rome was even partly broken men could now receive the word of god and yield to the influence of the spirit without such great fear as formerly this opened the door to the great missionary age that followed the jezebel of thyatira was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people and thus we see her daughter athelia raise her head in the sardisian age with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seed by her schemes of organization the warning revelation 3 2 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god i wish it could be said that the sardisian age was a restoration instead of a reformation i cannot say that the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another pentecostal age but it was not the best that could be said of it was strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing my yes there certainly was this age had justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism with the holy ghost that is what god's original plan was that is what they had at pentecost they were justified they were sanctified and were filled with the holy ghost why listen to me the reason for being justified and sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the holy ghost that is the reason that there is a church it is the temple of god filled with god even the holy ghost the same spirit that was in jesus while he was here on earth causing him to do the mighty works which he did came back upon the church at pentecost so that they did the works that he did this age did not have those works oh they had the written word but not the revealed word this was the reformation period but fear not little flock god said i will restore and this reform was going to be the start of it he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of satan in the dark ages to the depth of god that they had at pentecost and in the first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this it says in the second verse that i read for i have not found thy works perfect before god do you know what the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back that is why i said the bible called it reformation not restoration it had started out in the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of god oh how luther preached the sovereignty of god and election he knew it was all of grace he separated the church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols he cast out the confessions to the priests he denounced the pope it was wonderfully good as he started but god had said fifteen hundred years before luther you are going to start things but your age will see it all unfulfilled i am leaving that to later hallelujah our god reigneth he knows the end from the beginning yes luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as we examine the flaws but there was a man called jonah he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet though you and i might not want to say so on the basis of how he acted but god knows them that are his and he has his way just as he did with jonah he had his way with luther in that age and he will have his way until the confirmation [Music] and so far from this age and now can we call it the age of restoration what age was it can someone tell me what's the difference between reformation and restoration someone the difference between reformation and restoration yes information means [Music] they didn't have the whole thing that's a reformation what is the reform it's not a form it's reform i'm not asking you what information i'm saying what is reformation you know these are very very important words for you to understand because if you do understand them then you are going to be able to answer most of the questions that are going to come your way because of this precious message which we believe and are standing martin luther never restored anything but rather he reformed because the church was deformed so martin luther reformed what was deformed do you not understand he has given a list of things that matter luda preached against martin luther preached against the pope's authority martin luther preached the authority of the church martin luther preached preached christ he preached to election he preached the justification by faith he preached it's another things that he preached he preached against uh you know recording the you know the bread and the wine according to the literal body and the literal blood of christ they would say this one is the real blood this one is no no you see martin luther was bringing back in a way those things which were already being told in the past by the apostles and they touch the child before you but what you need to understand is that martin luther never brought back everything his was that information not a restoration restoration now comes in the end time church in the church in the in the last days the last one the messenger which will come in the last church which is about the share oh everything back to the church but as we see his was to reform whatever he did only reformed the church as a matter of fact martin luther continued the baptizing babies he continued smoking and drinking he continued like we see he wasn't perfect like all the people god he was not perfect god doesn't pick perfect people he picks people who are ready to be used by him so no matter who you are god is ready to use you if you can be ready to be used by him and surrender yourself and make yourself available for him he's not working for you because you're perfect he's looking for you because you are ready and willing and are soft enough for him to let his word from here through your heart so that you can be able to go to the world now brother bottom here also reaches another part which three things he talks about one justification two sanctification three baptism of the holy ghost these three works of grace are actually started kickstarted right here in service by the message of matthew martin luther was the one who preached the message of justification what is justification come on now come in now yes [Music] um you acknowledge you're wrong but what to be justified what is to be justified give the meaning of justify do you use a computer do you know how to use a computer yes do you know that word called justify who knows it on the computer can you tell us can you tell us what that word means rather okay okay go ahead okay go ahead go ahead bro what um yes there are three ones justify and text them on the first line in the middle are you sure it's kind of everywhere middle last line it brings all of them and collects them properly and brings it on the first line on the first line so that you can be yeah we're gonna do very well on the page now to justify means nothing is organized disorganized but is to reorganize is to render organize to render good it is bad to render good so when you are justified you have been rendered silly less the reason why you need to be justified is because you have been disorganized full of sin full of unbelief but when you are brought back and organized the right line it means you have been rendered seamless not because of your words but because of the work of him that justifies hallelujah that's not afraid justification by faith we are justified by faith through through grace justification by faith through grace it is the gift of god oh they say there's battalions they love that hey they can shout on that you know what because they believe it's not what you do that matters it's not the things that you do so they see that you do god doesn't look at that it that justifies you you are a sinner and maybe even now you are a sinner but yet he has rendered you sinless and he has said you are his son this man loser would breach this and he would go around the corner and drink a pipe and smoke a pipe and drink a cow fight with his wife and they beat one another this one is asking he delayed by the father holy spirit and i'm telling you my brother he did it as a man because he wasn't perfect he was what did he say and now you are going to have all sorts of ideas all right now let me tell you but we have many things we can discuss about that but we let me take what the message said that god does not choose a perfect man neither were the believers of that generation perfect either if the messenger was not remembered where it was but yet he comes to them among the bride as long as they receive his message so you see it wasn't what they did it's what they believed what they believed made them do what they did you understand so what you believe today will make you do what you do the the message of the hour puts you into a form a life where you are supposed to be okay if you plant a maize and that may germinate can you say that that may seed or seedling is not real mates is it maze brother so you can debate no short message because you cannot even say anything about which it may even die along the way no no it is made because the life is insane no i just think i am but the truth of the matter was that as long as they see the seed regardless of the time when you see it so we see that luther was representing that first stage of grace called justification by faith and the people who are stuck with his message but god moved on we are no longer at the lab of justification we have now come up to the level of sanctification sanctification comes in another age as you shall see where we are going that comes with a jerusalem who's the message of the church of philadelphia but we see that even then the church is not yet perfect so when does perfection come i love this part where does perfection come the last age god bless you brother awesome it counts but [Music] if they have the holy spirit before us i would say whatever they did and believed was by the power of the holy spirit justification comes by the holy spirit sanctification comes by the holy spirit and you are filled then with the person himself that's like in a in the individual's life and we say you have the holy spirit before you you're satisfied you know the moment you heard the word and you are convicted surely i want to be baptized what touched you what made you do that the holy spirit right yes because the holy spirit but can we say you you're not feeling the holy spirit not yet but that is the spirit of god then you come to the next level you are sanctified you know the things you used to do oh i can't do them anymore as the father was giving us a testimony hey i am not going to do that i'm not a things are changing in my life something is happening what is that when you read that level can we say you're not true with the holy spirit not yet not yet my sister you're still moving on you always have to fight because i can do that i have many believers in this message but i'm not feeling the whole spirit is and who is doing wrong but but they are not filled with the holy ghost the life of president manifested through their life that's where the most dangerous part is then comes the part where you're filled with the holocaust in your soul that is not christ in you hallelujah manifesting his words as we have already seen manifesting his work it's no longer your works when you under justification and certification you can do your work you are trying to leave right you are trying i've been trying hard got to support i've been trying to not dream about i've been trying not to leave my body i've been trying i've really destroyed my best valuable thing at that level that their works are going to take them to the rapture and when you receive that also the ones we realize oh it's no longer my trying or my ability it is him who lives and works through me the things i do i do that no more because of my power but because of his power in me because of his work that he's doing in me so god has a work that is doing in each of the bride members of christ the body of christ hallelujah and so let me i think we can finish around here where about where he go he picks it up and talks about everything i've been talking about just around there let's let's get that now this was an unfulfilled age it was an age of reformation but that is how god wanted it i want to illustrate that to you the way i did to a very wonderful lutheran brother who was a president of a very fine seminary out west i had been invited to his place to have dinner with him and to speak to him concerning the holy spirit he was puzzled about many things and he said to me what have we lutherans got i said well you have christ he said we want the holy ghost do you think we've got it i said potentially you are believing unto it he said what do you mean potentially we are hungry for god we read a book on pentecost and the gifts of the spirit so some of us flew out to california to see the author when we got there he told us that though he had written the book he did not have the gift now when we saw the operation of gifts in your ministry we wanted to talk to you for you must know something about them now this brothers seminary is out in the country and surrounded by many acres of farmland on which the students can work and thereby pay their way through college he also has factories that go along with the farm to give added employment so using his fields to illustrate my case i said once there was a man who went forth on his own ground to plant a field of corn he pulled up the stumps cleared off the rocks plowed and disked it and then planted his corn each morning he looked out across the field but one morning instead of barren ground he saw myriads of little blades coming up he said praise god for my field of corn i then asked him did the man have corn he said well in one way he did i said potentially yes and that was you lutherans in the reformation putting forth your blade see the corn began to grow after it had rotted in the ground during the dark ages after several joints there were fine large it was the back edges when was the dark ages come on grass let's be very dormant like that come on where was the dark edges so which age are we looking at here mainly which which are we looking at satira is that right so after in platera the corn the seed brought now here in sardis the seed has sprung up the blade okay and one day a tassel of silk appeared that tassel of silk looked down at the blades and said you old formal lutherans haven't anything look at us we're the breeders the great missionaries our day is the mission write this down you have the the the dark edges where the corn rotted away darker edges the corn or the seed rotted away now in the satisfying the sadism church age here we see that the seed or the corn is putting forth the blade meaning it is sprouting coming out growing out aha that is in the sardisian church age now then by the bottom says here after several joints there we have fine large strokes and one day a tassel of silk appeared so the tassel when is the time of the test which we're going to come back to that the time of the tassel is going to be the philadelphia and church age because the torso of silly look down onto the blades of of service and say hey you all former lutherans have that energy look at us we have great breeders the great missionaries our day is the missionary era that tesla age was the wizardian age are you following that so the tesla age was the he was syrian age they were great missionaries they even excelled they were greatest missionaries and they even excelled us in our age what did that age do it's kind of like pollen in the breeze you know what pollen does when it's scattered what what is happening when's problem is scattered come on somebody do you know what problem is so when you discover what happens fertilization takes place what is what is fixing to take place drop in here what is fixing to happen the fruit is fixing to come out now the river may see the real cities of oil hallelujah the scene which went into the ground is not fixing to retire and when the seed returns there is that time when that seed which returned which was sown in the ground it has returned and then it it it is right ripened and went to ripens hey it's the time of the living of that sea we are leaving at that time of the ripping of that seed amen this is the time we are living in now oh my you see this additional church age was the time of bringing forth of the what of the blind hallelujah this is very great write those things down very very very important for you to know because this you find it everest or everywhere everywhere in every message the messages have been preaching in the recent past or this quote here only talks about explains everything that i've been trying to say i've been trying to say we are now at the time of the perfection where oh my when you take your signatures right where do you take it you collect it and the shark you collect it also what happens to the shark you burn it what happens to the seed you take it in your bun hallelujah there in glory land ended the troubles of this storyline we want it to be wonderful there hallelujah let us finish that who want to be wonderful there having nobodies to make oh joyously [Applause] [Music] because so just uh the rest we shall just go through it quickly and then we shall finish it up but so that can be in philadelphia so therefore it will not take a long time then go to audacity and then wrap up the church engines i'm sure by the time we are done you people you will be on another level we are rather getting creatures out before we even get that praise alone oh ended that rough goes and cares all the storylines [Music] foreign [Music] oh joyously [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] why [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] and talking with christ that soup [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] i want to [Music] [Music] [Music] it will be wonderful [Music] is oh will be [Applause] is okay [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
