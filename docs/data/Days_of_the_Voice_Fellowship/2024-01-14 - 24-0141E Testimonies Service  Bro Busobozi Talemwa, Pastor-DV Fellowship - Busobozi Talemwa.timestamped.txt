[29:12] about what our pastor team
[29:18] preached yeah the other day when he was
[29:20] talking about running away from
[29:26] God I've been that way for so many years
[29:29] I think for about 15
[29:33] years 15 even more in the
[29:38] ministry yeah and I've been running away
[29:41] running away running
[29:45] away but as brother Prince said God will
[29:48] corner you at some
[29:53] point how I found myself in Uganda I was
[29:56] still running
[30:01] away
[30:05] I I was looking for a comfort zone away
[30:09] from
[30:12] home but also I was caught again with
[30:15] the
[30:18] ministry uh I married here peacefully I
[30:21] went stayed peacefully I even left my
[30:23] church with Pastor Mo know some of them
[30:26] even there
[30:29] watching I went to a small
[30:33] Church in a place called di your way to
[30:38] Tanzania that's why I took my family
[30:40] after I
[30:42] married got a new house I started a new
[30:46] business I started praying there so that
[30:49] I don't be given
[30:53] responsibilities but the pastor could
[30:55] not also let me sit
[31:00] he started on me all interpretation or
[31:03] sometimes
[31:06] service I'm not around you
[31:09] takeover and
[31:12] uh I ran again
[31:16] away uh God gave me some few things I
[31:19] was doing in
[31:22] Moro that's I came
[31:25] to my wife is from uh
[31:30] Cara she is a
[31:33] Ugandan ug I got her from Little flocks
[31:37] here the church I can see some of our
[31:39] friends here whom I was meeting her with
[31:42] when I used to come
[31:47] around
[31:52] Pastor how am I forgetting it's my good
[31:55] friend Charles uh
[31:58] aor yeah that's where I got my wife from
[32:01] she was in maer that time in the last
[32:11] year some of you were asking me how did
[32:14] you marry from Mombasa and carja they
[32:16] don't match but it was Mombasa and
[32:23] Cala you see when you get someone's
[32:26] daughter
[32:28] when you get someone's daughter Isaac
[32:30] when
[32:31] when elaz got
[32:36] Rea he did not get her from the well
[32:39] straight to their
[32:42] home my pastor used to say a convention
[32:45] is like a
[32:49] well maybe you have not got your wife in
[32:52] your church where you pray or your
[32:56] husband
[32:57] when you go to Wells like this God can
[33:00] do
[33:05] something but even after got her from
[33:08] the world they had to ask her whose
[33:10] daughter are
[33:15] you and he had to go to the
[33:20] Village so I also went to the Village
[33:25] Ina to ask for permission to to to their
[33:33] daughter that's how I
[33:36] knew a place far away from my
[33:41] dreams but I found myself
[33:45] there these Elders here the two of them
[33:48] especially him
[33:52] pastor and another one who is not here
[33:55] they were they were there on me I
[33:57] remember even they sat me down to ask
[33:59] you are you really a
[34:03] Believer the stories we hear about
[34:05] Mombasa they really okay we he people
[34:08] wake up in the on top
[34:11] of of
[34:16] coconut I told them those are just
[34:20] stories it's not like
[34:23] that end in mango another another story
[34:30] but that is just a conception of people
[34:32] it's not like that mbas is a very
[34:34] beautiful
[34:37] city a very good
[34:39] place but like the prophet prophesied
[34:42] about cnia is full of all kinds of
[34:49] mess for you to stay there you have to
[34:52] be really born
[34:55] again
[34:57] uh else the pleasure of this world if
[34:59] you have not overcome you not sustain to
[35:02] be the
[35:07] message so those who were asking me how
[35:09] I came up to kja that's how I went to
[35:16] car yeah so to make that first
[35:25] shot
[35:28] uh when I came back to kja we had a
[35:31] project with my wife we were doing there
[35:33] a family
[35:37] project and even we decided to close one
[35:41] of our one of our main business in
[35:46] Kenya and we said
[35:49] maybe we can be here
[35:52] around but she didn't know I was running
[35:54] away from the ministry to
[35:58] so we stayed very well until uh the
[36:02] pastor of the church where I
[36:06] was he's not around one day he told
[36:10] me prepare you the one preaching on
[36:14] Sunday I
[36:18] said but it Contin like that a lot of
[36:21] things
[36:24] happened I found myself back in the
[36:28] puet and I've been running until uh
[36:31] close to the the end of the last year
[36:37] 2023 when I was seeking the Lord is when
[36:40] he told
[36:42] me you have to be in the ministry
[36:45] especially
[36:50] in then I told my wife I don't know why
[36:53] God is telling me to be in kja now I
[36:55] feel like I should go back
[37:02] but when brother Tim preached that it is
[37:04] struck my
[37:08] heart it was a confirmation of what God
[37:11] had told
[37:13] me
[37:15] and I promised God I will go and now
[37:18] start doing his
[37:21] work so if you are

[39:14] to so shortly uh the second testimony
[39:21] ahead and I believe this one is going to
[39:24] help
[39:25] someone
[39:26] [Music]
[39:28] it was about
[39:31] uh something God uh struck my heart as I
[39:34] was watching some services from Zimbabwe
[39:37] but Pastor gwna some of you have been
[39:39] streaming from
[39:43] him he having a church in Dubai they had
[39:46] a convention this
[39:51] year Dubai and the convention was so
[39:55] powerful
[39:57] like the brother from Ethiopia when he
[39:59] was preaching he
[40:02] said it looks like for you to be a
[40:04] believer you have to be
[40:10] poor you go and search that Convention
[40:12] of
[40:15] Dubai you see the equipment they were
[40:18] using the music team you ADM
[40:22] them you see how they had arranged the
[40:25] converstion
[40:28] and the kind of people who were in the
[40:33] convention One Pastor from Zab whom God
[40:36] sent to preach in UK brother Prince I
[40:39] forget the name but he remembers him I
[40:41] was
[40:43] talking he came there and he said
[40:47] wow past how do you feel when you see
[40:50] all your children are
[40:55] successful
[40:59] I tapped the
[41:03] blessing because one Minister was
[41:05] praying saying I know you have one
[41:09] car if you want a second one
[41:13] come I don't want to ask how many I have
[41:16] cars you might find two or
[41:19] three or none
[41:23] even our God is rich
[41:27] so I had a family out with my wife she's
[41:31] here and I told her we are not
[41:33] comfortable with eating and dressing
[41:36] just around
[41:40] there this year we need God to do
[41:43] something
[41:45] different then I asked her what do you
[41:48] want God to do for you in this
[41:52] year she said I want a
[41:55] job prayed and God told me she is going
[41:58] to have a
[42:01] job today when I was coming away from
[42:04] the outside the fellowship
[42:08] all she called me actually on our way to
[42:12] the meeting we were coming to pick our
[42:14] transcript in she has never picked them
[42:16] because I married and we went to
[42:22] Kenya I had faith that she should pick
[42:24] them because work is coming
[42:31] she called me she's like you remember I
[42:33] texted this person I need a job a big
[42:35] politician here
[42:40] in I told her yes and she ignored my
[42:45] message right now she has texted me and
[42:48] told me I want to give you a offer but
[42:50] don't fail
[42:54] me she like could that that be true
[42:57] honestly I can't believe they talking to
[43:02] me I
[43:04] asked why did you come to the
[43:06] meeting what were you tapping from the
[43:09] sermon you don't believe an angel can
[43:12] work for
[43:12] [Music]
[43:14] you I said I
[43:17] believe and she made a call some time
[43:19] back before we came here and she
[43:21] confirmed is a real
[43:25] thing
[43:26] God can also bless
[43:28] you you need to raise up your faith
[43:31] don't be satisfied with
[43:35] poverty don't be satisfied with
[43:38] poverty even as a young person some of
[43:41] you are not marrying because of
[43:46] poverty yes some of you sister are not
[43:49] married because they looking at her
[43:50] brother is
[43:55] poor
[43:57] the riches they don't come from the
[43:59] brothers they come from
[44:03] Gods
[44:05] everything some of us if we tell you how
[44:07] we married it will be a testimony of
[44:09] another
[44:11] day but one thing I can assure you if
[44:14] you trust
[44:17] God I've never slept angry in my
[44:21] life neither as she slept angry in my
[44:25] house
[44:29] we may lack some few things here and
[44:31] there but God has taken care of
[44:34] us so for you young
[44:38] people money is not the
[44:41] problem the problem is your faith to
[44:44] receive the
[44:46] money so you believe God when you come
[44:49] to when you came to this meeting he has
[44:51] answered your
[44:53] prayer but don't just get satisfied
[44:56] where you
[44:57] are God can raise you to a different
[45:01] standard so I'm your humble brother
[45:04] again Benjamin may the Lord bless
[45:06] you I had not plan to give a
[45:10] testimony now when pastor called me
[45:13] because we had a plan to have a meeting

[45:20] myself what am I going to
[45:22] testify but for a Believer a lot of
[45:24] things God has done for

[55:24] Lord I would like to make this small
[55:27] testimony I'm by the name brother chakis
[55:30] sis I'm a pastor my church is just four
[55:34] months
[55:40] old um it's 4 month old and I'm just two
[55:45] years old in the
[55:49] message um I'm not new into the gospel
[55:52] I've been serving under Christ Embassy
[55:54] Ministry
[55:58] [Music]
[56:00] P but as I was serving God met
[56:05] me it was one night when my regional
[56:08] pastor called me to go and open another
[56:10] church in another town somewhere in my
[56:18] region at campus I was sent and I went
[56:21] and open their branch in ARA
[56:23] City
[56:26] and they sent a pastor
[56:28] there God called me as an
[56:31] evangelist after that I went and open
[56:34] another church for that very Pentecostal
[56:36] Ministry in my home town called
[56:39] nav I grew it for 3 years and I got 50
[56:45] members as a young man I was so Z so
[56:47] much that I wanted to open church here
[56:49] and
[56:51] there so they sent me to go and open the
[56:54] next Church the Church in another town
[56:59] called so as I pray to prepare to go and
[57:02] pray open the
[57:06] church the Lord told
[57:08] me you're on your
[57:10] own I'm not with
[57:13] you look at myself I've served in this
[57:16] many for the last seven
[57:20] years are you sure Lord you're not with
[57:23] me
[57:25] then I asked
[57:26] myself what have I been
[57:30] doing so I prayed again I thought maybe
[57:33] it was my
[57:35] thought the same voice came you're on
[57:37] your own I'm not with
[57:40] you I called my regional
[57:44] Pastor I said I'm not going to that
[57:47] mission of P to open a new
[57:51] Branch because God is not with me
[57:55] he thought I was being
[57:58] rebellious I said I don't want to go and
[58:00] do what God is not part
[58:04] of so he said I'm going to send to
[58:07] headquarter Ina in where that's where
[58:09] the headquarter of the ministry
[58:13] is as a young man I so much wanted to be
[58:16] like those spiritual fathers of mine the
[58:20] Pentecost I loved Pastor Chris so
[58:23] much his ministry called Christ
[58:27] Embassy one of the powerful Min in the
[58:31] Pentecost they are
[58:33] rich most of the big pastors there in
[58:36] Nigeria USA they fly using their own
[58:40] Jets we all wanted to be like them as
[58:43] young
[58:44] men I wanted to be promoted and also go
[58:47] like
[58:49] them but the Lord said that he's not
[58:51] with
[58:53] me so that very
[58:57] night I said Lord take me to a Ministry
[59:01] where which is also Global like Christ
[59:08] Embassy which is also having loaded
[59:10] pastors because I I I want to serve the
[59:13] Lord but also want to make money I like
[59:15] business and
[59:21] businessman I want the Min which is
[59:23] having greater reation than Christ
[59:28] Embassy I want deeper
[59:32] Revelations I want to have the bragging
[59:34] right of the
[59:36] revelations yes I'm leaving Christ
[59:38] Embassy the Pentecostal but I want a
[59:40] bigger
[59:44] church so I stayed for two months and
[59:48] there they told the whole congregation
[59:49] and everybody that success has
[59:53] backed
[59:57] so as I prayed one day a certain
[1:00:00] man came and invited me and say that
[1:00:03] come and we pray in the
[1:00:06] message then I was like what is the
[1:00:11] message that message sometimes we call
[1:00:13] it the
[1:00:18] Bram I've never heard of such
[1:00:22] Ministry is it in this town also
[1:00:26] CS is there you
[1:00:28] come I
[1:00:31] came so they on that day I I forgot what
[1:00:36] they told Mar but the pastor preached
[1:00:38] about
[1:00:42] baptism it was so new to me that we
[1:00:44] don't baptism is in the name of Jesus
[1:00:47] not in the
[1:00:49] Trinity I got the next time they
[1:00:53] preached about um Church
[1:00:57] order yeah in Pentecostal it's so
[1:01:00] disorganized there's no
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:03] ordering us women are pastors everything
[1:01:09] is so the man preached
[1:01:13] about I was amazed the next day preached
[1:01:15] about church
[1:01:18] ages so many things then I began seeing
[1:01:21] a lot of things a lot of things then I
[1:01:23] was like I think I've arrived where I
[1:01:27] wanted praise the
[1:01:29] Lord so when I arrived I told that
[1:01:32] Pastor in ch that I found where I wanted
[1:01:34] to
[1:01:38] be I of the Prophet where he was talking
[1:01:42] about the
[1:01:45] Eagles that Eagles have okay it's like
[1:01:48] eagles know where they belong one day if
[1:01:50] if if if an eagle if an eaglet maybe
[1:01:53] hidden somewhere one day when the bigger
[1:01:55] Eagle
[1:01:58] F and he hears the voice of that
[1:02:02] eagle it will fly and go that mother and
[1:02:05] moves I was that e that small ego which
[1:02:09] was somewhere
[1:02:11] hidden when I heard the voice of this
[1:02:14] man of
[1:02:17] God Prophet
[1:02:19] Bram I felt like this is what I
[1:02:23] wanted
[1:02:24] from that day
[1:02:26] on I've loved the prophet iously so much
[1:02:31] his
[1:02:33] word last year in

[1:02:51] preaching on the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:53] Ghost

[1:03:39] me I preached and today we are around 20
[1:03:42] there
[1:03:45] in our church is
[1:03:48] progressing we are still
[1:03:50] few the first day we began the service I
[1:03:53] was arrested because one time I was in
[1:03:55] so much involved in
[1:04:00] politics it was a wrong politics because
[1:04:02] I was mobilizing for no those days when
[1:04:04] I was still in
[1:04:08] Pentecostal I used to be the N mobilizer
[1:04:11] in west region as theth

[1:04:24] the district
[1:04:26] there that this n mobilizer has gotten
[1:04:29] some youth here I don't know what they

[1:06:07] some of the message Believers there they
[1:06:09] say that a lot of
[1:06:15] steps but Gideon told
[1:06:18] me if God has called you he will give
[1:06:21] you the
[1:06:23] revelations will vindicate you and the
[1:06:27] Holy Spirit is enough for you you don't
[1:06:30] need anything you and the Holy Spirit

[1:12:53] chance to look
[1:12:57] at someone from South
[1:13:00] Africa said that the while the preacher
[1:13:03] was
[1:13:05] preaching each of the whole family was
[1:13:08] streaming the
[1:13:11] service but each of them was having
[1:13:14] their own
[1:13:17] Gadget where they were watching
[1:13:20] from and so they were in different rooms
[1:13:24] and so he was saying that his
[1:13:27] daughter was watching on the on the
[1:13:31] top and uh he was in the bedroom one of
[1:13:35] the
[1:13:37] bedrooms so by the time the father came

[1:13:55] Ghost and she was filled right there in
[1:13:57] her
[1:14:00] bedroom how many has got filled with the
[1:14:02] Holy Spirit in these
[1:14:04] meeting there is someone who came to me
[1:14:07] today and uh said pastor I have a
[1:14:12] problem when I
[1:14:14] went to to pray at the
[1:14:19] altar I I
[1:14:21] noticed that my hands were feeling as if
[1:14:26] electricity has gone through
[1:14:29] me and my mouth as if it has been
[1:14:33] shocked by
[1:14:35] electricity and that electricity was
[1:14:37] just so much on
[1:14:40] me and she was wondering whether she was
[1:14:43] having a
[1:14:45] problem but I have a question for
[1:14:48] you I want some young person to answer
[1:14:51] that question you
[1:14:54] answer if you are shocked by
[1:14:57] electricity there's no more
[1:15:00] electricity can you be the
[1:15:03] same no what will happen to
[1:15:08] you you'll be shocked by and then what
[1:15:13] happens you you die are you
[1:15:17] hearing when shocks you you are not
[1:15:20] going to remain the same because you
[1:15:22] will

[1:15:28] quiet I said you are so
[1:15:30] quiet when shocks you what will happen
[1:15:34] to you you will die now what about if

[1:15:45] you what will happen to
[1:15:48] you what happened to you your old nature
[1:15:52] will die

[1:24:56] uh let us give him a
[1:24:59] hand uh there is what is brother
[1:25:03] success
[1:25:05] huh yes I
[1:25:10] know yeah come here come here
[1:25:14] sir I know he has
[1:25:17] finished but I wanted to talk to him
[1:25:21] briefly
[1:25:24] see some certain things we take it for
[1:25:28] granted because we don't understand what
[1:25:30] it
[1:25:31] means I just wanted to be sure how how
[1:25:34] long have you been in the message
[1:25:36] now
[1:25:37] years and how long have you been
[1:25:41] preaching four
[1:25:43] months so this young brother contacted
[1:25:47] me and say to me that you met which
[1:25:51] pastor
[1:25:55] the in your
[1:26:03] area
[1:26:06] Michael okay I don't know the pastor
[1:26:08] Michel who is he that introduced you to
[1:26:12] me Pastor Michael okay so Pastor Michael
[1:26:16] connected him with
[1:26:18] me and told him that uh he should be in
[1:26:24] touch and I I heard you mention about
[1:26:27] Pastor
[1:26:28] Chris and about about
[1:26:32] Pentecostalism now being a believer of
[1:26:34] the
[1:26:35] message I think I already told you this
[1:26:37] but maybe not in
[1:26:38] details but I'm saying this because
[1:26:41] there also others are
[1:26:43] hearing being a believe of the message
[1:26:46] does not mean we rubbish other
[1:26:50] ministers but this message
[1:26:52] sets us on a Higher
[1:26:54] Ground of revelation of
[1:26:58] understanding it's just like the
[1:27:00] chickens and the
[1:27:02] Eagles and this message makes us to see
[1:27:06] as
[1:27:07] Eagles we don't eat like
[1:27:10] chicken but we eat like
[1:27:12] eagles and so when when the food has
[1:27:16] been gathered for
[1:27:18] Eagles EOS gather there you lose the
[1:27:21] appetite for what the chicken used to
[1:27:24] eat but I just wanted to encourage you
[1:27:26] my brother you just preach this
[1:27:29] message and I think I saw you you have
[1:27:33] Vision but God will give you the
[1:27:36] grace and and and if you you know stay
[1:27:39] right in the message study the
[1:27:42] message well yeah we we believe in the
[1:27:44] Holy
[1:27:46] Spirit but after you receive the Holy
[1:27:48] Spirit study the message listen to the
[1:27:51] message
[1:27:52] read it and I tell you nothing will stop

[1:29:33] it
[1:29:35] over bless
[1:29:37] you God bless
[1:29:40] you
[1:29:44] evening I had made up my mind not to
[1:29:46] come for these
[1:29:50] meetings because
[1:29:52] according to
[1:29:55] me I thought I had enough
[1:30:09] meetings he was so excited to invite
[1:30:15] me in my mind I was like uhuh I'm not
[1:30:20] coming
[1:30:23] but then I invited my friend from nairi
[1:30:26] to
[1:30:29] come so she called me when she was at
[1:30:32] the bus
[1:30:35] Park she told me that you had invited me
[1:30:38] for the youth meeting and I'm here at
[1:30:40] the bus Park please come and get
[1:30:49] me I really felt bad
[1:30:54] I felt
[1:30:55] like I could have called her earlier to
[1:30:57] tell her that I don't want to come for
[1:30:59] this
[1:31:06] meeting so I had to come because she was
[1:31:09] already at the
[1:31:13] bus so even coming here I didn't pack
[1:31:19] anything I was like let me go and try
[1:31:21] and see if it BS me I'll just go
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:27] home but for really pked a very big
[1:31:34] suitcase so the first
[1:31:37] service I wasn't really
[1:31:41] moved but the service of yesterday moved
[1:31:45] me a
[1:31:48] lot uh when Pastor Tim was preaching
[1:31:55] I was like uh uh I've taken a lot of
[1:31:58] time to come
[1:32:03] here so I CED myself that I should
[1:32:05] really
[1:32:10] pray so I
[1:32:12] prayed and this
[1:32:14] time I really
[1:32:17] prayed I really
[1:32:20] prayed until I sat
[1:32:23] down and that friend then asked
[1:32:30] me if I was feeling
[1:32:33] okay then I told her sister I'm in the
[1:32:37] spirit then I prayed
[1:32:40] again so I sat on the front
[1:32:45] seats and those people
[1:32:50] who
[1:32:53] you couldn't really
[1:32:56] sit and the seats were put like
[1:32:59] disorganized
[1:33:02] everywhere so the last time that I
[1:33:07] prayed uh I then opened my
[1:33:11] eyes and there was a Bible in front of
[1:33:16] me it is not my
[1:33:19] Bible was
[1:33:24] and I just read that verse
[1:33:26] [Music]
[1:33:29] Isaiah chapter
[1:33:35] 6se the Bible is just open to that to
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:40] chapter so I was like
[1:33:44] okay the glory of God has really come
[1:33:47] upon
[1:33:50] me
[1:33:52] so I W to
[1:33:56] Pastor I told him that I need you to
[1:33:59] pray with
[1:34:02] me so I
[1:34:05] thought would really make a very long
[1:34:10] prayer but he told
[1:34:12] me the glory of God has come upon
[1:34:18] thee and he smiled at me and said sister
[1:34:21] that's it
[1:34:24] so I walked
[1:34:26] back and I didn't regret to come for
[1:34:29] this
[1:34:33] conf another
[1:34:36] testimony I want to thank God for the

[1:38:30] minutes uh
[1:38:33] but I moved with a
[1:38:36] team and then some of them they were
[1:38:40] saying they want really to thank
[1:38:44] God you sing a song they
[1:38:50] want
[1:38:52] yeah after when we ended the the last
[1:38:59] service I just got brother he said
[1:39:02] you'll remain as my
[1:39:07] brother because the all
[1:39:10] meeting though we wrote letters or the
[1:39:16] request from wanted also to praise God
[1:39:23] but we we were
[1:39:27] unlucky hallelujah amen but with all
[1:39:33] that and now I can
[1:39:35] say thank the grace of the
[1:39:39] Lord me
[1:39:42] personally so
[1:39:45] yesterday I really saw the hand of God
[1:39:48] on my
[1:39:50] life
[1:39:53] whereby when brother Timothy was
[1:39:59] preaching so I saw God because I was
[1:40:03] praying really deeply my
[1:40:06] heart when other people were
[1:40:11] jumping but for me I was praying my
[1:40:15] heart so by the time when God just led
[1:40:19] him to touch me
[1:40:24] and then took me in
[1:40:28] front yeah
[1:40:30] later when he said God has finished
[1:40:36] all God has done what he
[1:40:42] wanted so when I went to
[1:40:45] sit I just felt my right
[1:40:49] hand I just
[1:40:52] felt a cold wind flowing over my hand
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:06] now so at that very time then brother
[1:41:09] timoth said you can handle one
[1:41:17] another you start worshiping
[1:41:19] God
[1:41:21] so the same feeling
[1:41:25] continued but with the Brethren that I
[1:41:28] was with at that
[1:41:31] time I saw the power of
[1:41:36] God moving over my
[1:41:40] body and went to my
[1:41:45] neighbor and I saw anointing taking
[1:41:48] place upon his life
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] so I looked a bit so
[1:41:57] heavy but that
[1:42:00] time I saw my body it was too
[1:42:05] light I can take the weight can
[1:42:13] reach hallelujah hallelujah so I thank
[1:42:16] God so much for
[1:42:19] that
[1:42:21] amen amen so that's why I'm giving
[1:42:27] praise and honor to the
[1:42:32] Lord he anointed me heang
[1:42:37] me
[1:42:39] amen so I know at this
[1:42:44] time yeah I have not finished my minutes
[1:42:48] five used
[1:42:52] I don't know now the
[1:42:58] leader one minute wow are we really the
[1:43:02] right time

[1:43:10] my so one just in seconds want to sing
[1:43:15] this
[1:43:19] song want to sing in our own local
[1:43:25] language and if I have other who

[1:43:33] we are not used to those
[1:43:36] things God gave us those natural
[1:43:42] machines yeah so look at the body but
[1:43:46] look you hear the voice the way it
[1:43:49] is
[1:43:51] those are magnified voices of
[1:43:55] God Amen so the song
[1:44:00] says that I've got my
[1:44:05] brethren have got

[1:44:11] Faith so I invite also other Brethren

[2:42:07] really want to be so
[2:42:11] brief I when I when we were coming for

[2:42:20] Wednesday and we usually have prayer and
[2:42:24] fasting
[2:42:28] Wednesday and somehow there some to some
[2:42:31] I was listening to and the Lord really
[2:42:34] spoke to me so much and something was
[2:42:37] like you should really go for these
[2:42:39] meetings and have very great
[2:42:44] expectation
[2:42:48] and I
[2:42:49] determined that when I
[2:42:53] go I am not going to give any space for
[2:42:56] the
[2:43:00] devil not even the thoughts he brings to
[2:43:03] my
[2:43:03] [Music]
[2:43:05] mind and I want to thank God in a
[2:43:08] special
[2:43:09] way for
[2:43:11] yesterday because it was an anointing
[2:43:16] after
[2:43:18] anointing and I want to thank God
[2:43:20] because I was
[2:43:27] refilled and there is aity that comes

[3:09:24] uh my
[3:09:26] thoughts I wasn't thinking as a
[3:09:31] Christian as the Pastor said pastor
[3:09:34] timoth as was preaching he said when you
[3:09:38] feel this the bad thoughts just know
[3:09:41] those are thoughts of the devil
[3:09:45] and when we were in the service I said
[3:09:47] God thank you for answering my
[3:09:49] prayers
[3:09:52] because I needed a pastor to talk about
[3:09:55] how I can overcome my
[3:09:57] thoughts and really he did
[3:10:00] it and I thank God that I got a gun with
[3:10:05] two sides that I can believe the sat in
[3:10:10] no
[3:10:11] minute amen than me to God I'm really
[3:10:15] really happy cuz my chains all were
[3:10:18] broken

[3:10:23] there's a sister who went to to him and
[3:10:26] told him and told him that she feels
[3:10:30] like
[3:10:31] electricity passing in her whenever

[3:10:48] lips with electric in it I really want
[3:10:52] to thank God for being blessed and I
[3:10:56] thank God for the ministers he has used
[3:10:59] God bless
[3:11:03] you this was the purpose of this of this
[3:11:06] youth
[3:11:07] cerence when you see a life
[3:11:10] changed when you see someone filled with
[3:11:12] the h Ghost and the power of God over
[3:11:14] all over
[3:11:15] them just makes me feel like

[3:14:26] done God is not done sister come over
[3:14:29] here she said something is telling her
[3:14:32] she has to say what she's going to
[3:14:35] say praise
[3:14:37] God my name is
[3:14:40] fortunate from nebe I pray pray in Paro
[3:14:44] church so I have one testimony that I
[3:14:47] want to tell
[3:14:49] you I'm in a
[3:14:51] family we are we are three who are born
[3:14:56] again my dad mom and
[3:14:59] I and I have a lot of
[3:15:02] brothers and those ones are not born
[3:15:06] again so they are
[3:15:10] drunkard the moment they are drunk
[3:15:13] they just come they fac me they said
[3:15:18] fortunate anytime you are going to kill
[3:15:23] you but I just asked myself god what
[3:15:27] have I done to this Brothers of
[3:15:29] mine then there was a time I asked them
[3:15:32] what have I really done to you they
[3:15:36] said my our dad has taken you to school
[3:15:39] and you have studied and for us you are
[3:15:42] left
[3:15:43] I told them I said just because of the
[3:15:45] grace of God otherwise even my dad
[3:15:48] cannot afford that money to take me to
[3:15:50] that extent it's just a grace of
[3:15:54] God then I was so
[3:15:57] stressed to the extent that even in the
[3:16:00] church I cannot
[3:16:02] participate even church members they are
[3:16:05] so concerned about my

[3:22:03] my praise God Saints I really thank God
[3:22:07] that I'm here and I was able to attend
[3:22:09] this these meetings because was
[3:22:13] when Pastor came our school Christian it
[3:22:17] was a dedication for senior sues then he
[3:22:20] announced about these meetings and I
[3:22:23] felt really touched I really and I I
[3:22:26] really said God I I have to be there I
[3:22:28] have to just be there and be
[3:22:31] blessed and during this week as it last
[3:22:35] week as it was beginning I lost hope of
[3:22:38] attending and I just said God if you
[3:22:40] just help me to attend
[3:22:42] I'll testify and I really testify that
[3:22:45] I'm here and I have been blessed
[3:22:48] that I was feeling So
[3:22:51] Unworthy whereby the devil would would
[3:22:54] come to me and tell me you are nothing
[3:22:57] before God but our brother yesterday
[3:23:00] told us that we are brought by the
[3:23:02] precious
[3:23:04] blood and we are more valuable than
[3:23:07] anything in this world and I thank God
[3:23:10] for that and I thank God that we renew
[3:23:13] our positions we are Overcomers and
[3:23:16] Satan is at our feet he has no control
[3:23:19] over our lives I really thank God for
[3:23:32] that let's
[3:23:40] see
[3:23:43] I want thank God for answering my
[3:23:47] prayers I
[3:23:49] remember when I was
[3:23:52] coming I was in a
[3:23:56] taxi I started saying
[3:24:00] Lord At first I I didn't have that okay
[3:24:05] I wanted to come but I was not on that
[3:24:10] fire That I Used to Be for other
[3:24:13] convictions but I was like God let your
[3:24:15] will be
[3:24:18] done the taxi but the devil could again
[3:24:23] distract
[3:24:29] me and I want to thank you
[3:24:33] that
[3:24:35] Jesus has Set Me Free from the bondage
[3:24:40] of condemnation
[3:24:44] I condemn myself so much I also don't
[3:24:47] know
[3:24:48] why I don't
[3:24:51] know but even though I do something
[3:24:57] small I start saying that but you are
[3:25:01] you really a
[3:25:07] Christian I just pray that God should
[3:25:10] help me
[3:25:12] and strengthen me
[3:25:15] more and I want thank him that he has
[3:25:19] already strengthen
[3:25:23] me through the word that has been
[3:25:26] preached I was seeing that I'm nothing
[3:25:30] to
[3:25:31] God but when I was praying I said Lord
[3:25:35] for me as myself I see that I'm unworthy
[3:25:40] but again you're telling me that I was
[3:25:43] spoked by the precious blood of Jesus
[3:25:47] Christ I just
[3:25:50] Breen this is a testimony but as well as
[3:25:54] I pray that you pray for us youths we
[3:25:58] have many things that distract Us in the
[3:26:01] way whenever we try whenever we try to
[3:26:06] to set my life free from
[3:26:09] condemnation and another the like the
[3:26:12] pastor was saying that this day tomorrow
[3:26:16] must be greater than
[3:26:18] today then again when you reach tomorrow
[3:26:22] then the things get worse you say oh
[3:26:25] Lord what is this but I thank
[3:26:29] God for the word that was preached I
[3:26:34] thank God cuz he has given me the G with
[3:26:40] bullets
[3:26:43] and I pray that I should use them all
[3:26:45] the time whenever I try to condemn
[3:26:48] myself let me
[3:26:50] remember that I was bought by the
[3:26:53] precious blood of Jesus Christ and I'm
[3:26:56] going to hav CU I'm just a stranger
[3:27:01] here I sometimes wonder how comes he CH
[3:27:07] me thank you
[3:27:10] Lord
[3:27:17] praise the
[3:27:18] Lord uh I've never seen anybody who can
[3:27:21] be able to explain Supernatural
[3:27:24] things Supernatural things cannot be
[3:27:26] explained by natural things and when God
[3:27:29] has done something for something for
[3:27:31] someone that is
[3:27:32] Supernatural you can easily
[3:27:37] tell I I have two more people that and
[3:27:43] um listen if it's a testimony I'm going
[3:27:47] to allow them how many agree with
[3:27:50] me I don't want people singing
[3:27:56] anymore God bless
[3:27:58] you I really thank God that I came to
[3:28:02] this
[3:28:03] confession I came with an expectation of
[3:28:06] being delivered
[3:28:08] and things as battling with but I came
[3:28:14] under
[3:28:16] expectation to be delivered during the
[3:28:20] service
[3:28:22] and Pastor team was ministering after
[3:28:25] the service he told us to gather
[3:28:28] together and pray with a
[3:28:30] friend and the power of God moved within
[3:28:34] us and I was delivered I didn't want to
[3:28:38] give the
[3:28:40] testimony
[3:28:47] but how do they call
[3:28:56] it yeah so I felt
[3:29:01] like I was cheating God if I don't give
[3:29:04] that
[3:29:05] testimony so I was like I'll not give it
[3:29:09] because there are very many people
[3:29:12] time has gone but I thank God that he
[3:29:15] delivered me he filled me with the Holy
[3:29:18] Spirit and I thank
[3:29:21] good
[3:29:23] that after that I don't remember the
[3:29:26] exact service today but after the
[3:29:30] service Pastor came on the
[3:29:34] pit and he said he was talking about
[3:29:38] forgiveness and he said I don't know why
[3:29:40] I'm pushing this
[3:29:41] that I believe it's for
[3:29:43] someone I had that thing I had this
[3:29:47] person I was like I've forgiven them but
[3:29:51] deep down I had not forgiven
[3:29:54] them and you can the prophet says you
[3:29:57] cannot have perfect faith when you don't
[3:30:00] have that
[3:30:02] forgiveness
[3:30:03] so I was like I let go but whenever I
[3:30:08] meet this person that thing comes back
[3:30:09] and I find out that I've not forgiving
[3:30:12] them so in the past I was really pushing
[3:30:15] on
[3:30:17] forgiveness I let my heart out to God I
[3:30:20] was like God I've really forgiven this
[3:30:23] person and I thank God that that thing
[3:30:26] like when you don't forgive that thing
[3:30:28] the heart there's a there's something
[3:30:30] but I thank God that it left I feel free
[3:30:33] even if I meet this person I am so happy
[3:30:36] and I thank God for that God bless
[3:30:40] you
[3:30:45] praise
[3:30:46] God I'm sister Alice
[3:31:00] from I appreciate God for this meeting

[3:40:32] my

[3:42:04] trying to look for something to take it
[3:42:06] away and instead of reading the word and
[3:42:08] looking unto God I always went to
[3:42:10] YouTube and watching movies trying to
[3:42:13] take away the pain but nothing could
[3:42:21] help I was in a very bad sad
[3:42:33] life the last Sunday of last year as
[3:42:36] beginning this
[3:42:38] year
[3:42:42] I prayed
[3:42:46] [Music]
[3:42:53] from God spoke to me in the scripture of
[3:42:56] Luke 3:
[3:43:04] 11 and spoke of that lady who always
[3:43:07] came to the church with a crippled
[3:43:19] and he say that that LE came to church
[3:43:21] with a crippled back praise and then
[3:43:24] goes back still with crippled
[3:43:37] back and the preacher said might be
[3:43:40] coming to church every time but always
[3:43:42] going back with the same crippled
[3:43:49] condition like that lady who was
[3:43:57] weak and I said God this
[3:44:08] year I've also been with a crippled
[3:44:12] going to church but seeing no
[3:44:19] change I thank the
[3:44:22] Lord in that scripture and that has been
[3:44:25] my prayer even before I came for
[3:44:28] [Music]
[3:44:30] the the next suay I went
[3:44:37] to through that scripture and the
[3:44:39] preacher read that same
[3:44:43] scripture before even the week before
[3:44:46] the
[3:44:53] converstion I dedicated myself into the
[3:44:55] presence of God I put fasting
[3:45:04] away and I asked the Lord and said Lord
[3:45:06] I want you to touch me in this
[3:45:08] convention that I'm going to
[3:45:14] because my decision has been that Lord
[3:45:16] let me walk with you in this
[3:45:19] [Music]
[3:45:21] year TR last year I laid down
[3:45:29] God my life has really been bad in the
[3:45:33] presence of
[3:45:36] [Music]
[3:45:38] God but I made a decision to walk with
[3:45:41] the Lord this
[3:45:43] year and I thank
[3:45:53] God I thought I wouldn't be forgiven and
[3:45:56] I was saying Lord have mercy upon me
[3:45:59] just like you did upon that
[3:46:03] woman but I thank the Lord who says that
[3:46:06] he doesn't judge
[3:46:08] me
[3:46:11] and he says that I'm precious to
[3:46:14] him and he's told
[3:46:17] me that he bought me with his own
[3:46:20] blood and he
[3:46:25] told that my name is
[3:46:35] written truly God has not judged me
[3:46:45] I thank the Lord I'm
[3:46:53] delivered I thank the Lord I don't have
[3:46:55] the burden that I came with on my
[3:47:00] heart and I thank the Lord that I am
[3:47:04] free I thank the Lord for this
[3:47:08] convention
[3:47:10] last year I was
[3:47:19] online but I Cried unto the Lord and I
[3:47:21] said next year among those that are
[3:47:23] going let me be
[3:47:33] [Music]
[3:47:36] among I thank the Lord that I'm not
[3:47:38] going back this the same way I
[3:47:43] came I thank the Lord because I'm a
[3:47:47] Victor because he
[3:47:52] say that he cannot be complete without
[3:47:58] me and there I have no reason why
[3:48:03] I I have no reason why I
