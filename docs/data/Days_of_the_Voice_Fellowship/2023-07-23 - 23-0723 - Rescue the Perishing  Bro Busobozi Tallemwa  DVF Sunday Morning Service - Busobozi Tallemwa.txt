there and I realized it is almost the same it's just very tiring only that we arrived there earlier we arrived here earlier but it's still tiring to the body so we um we were with the Saints there for a week bridged five services and other ministers I may not remember they're quite many they sent their greetings and the church here amen and so which was nice to see and fellowship with the Saints on the other side I know some people here streaming how many streams the services so I can see some of you followed so we had a good fellowship with the Saints okay I'm happy to see you this morning I

were a little bit in touch with him and and he mentioned that he would one time come and fellowship with us so we're happy to see it again my brother over here there is a sister Angela is she here foreign now I understand that this sister confessed the Lord as a personal savior during my time when I was away but I'm informed that she lost her auntie Roberts to cancer we we need to remember her in prayer and also sister Esther requests for prayer we remember to pray for those um now before we go to the award this morning I'd like to invite some brothers here there's this song that is part of what I'm going it's actually the sermon I'm going to preach to you this morning and the Brothers prepare to come meanwhile I appreciate you and brother martin for continuing to you know the ministry during foreign is there a problem so I don't know whether brother where's brother praise did you brief him okay we try to this is a new song we don't we didn't all know it but we tried to we tried it a bit yesterday so I say brother Peter there I hope you don't mess up things for us but uh let us um it's we are all new to it we don't know it but it's the message in the song and I I trust that listen to the words brother can you get those words rescue the perishing ah have you found the words [Music] because it would be very good if you can be able to follow on the screen I'm waiting for you brother to tell me whether you found out you found out perfect okay so he's going to give you the words there I know about the Enoch sings rescued me many times so that's another another one but this is another one it's the words in the song it's the words in the song so we are not perfect at singing it yeah and that's why I didn't want us to sing with the instruments amen Amina it's a very old-time song [Music] foreign so maybe we might go a little bit to church of Uganda this morning I'm interested to be a blessing and as to prepare us to hear the word this morning rescue the perishing care for the dying snatch them in pity from the grave [Music] falling down name of Jesus the mighty to say [Music] raise to the perishing Jesus is merciful Jesus will sing [Music] though they are

touched by a loving heart awaken by kindness [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus is merciful Jesus we will say foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus is merciful Jesus [Music] amen hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah oh my I just feel so touched by by these words rescue the perishing care for the dying Jesus is merciful yes watch yourself Jesus will save yes I'd like to speak to you and rescue the parishes and this will be I don't know what number of parts of the title that I was dealing with on the message of the hour I believe that this is what the message of the hour is about is to rescue the parishes so we are taking the reading out of Luke chapter 10 verse 30. foreign [Music] [Music] and Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down as certain priests that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise I levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed on by the other side but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had come he had compassion on him and went to him and bound up his wounds powering in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an in and took care of him and on tomorrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and unto him take care of him and and say unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou Spanish more when I come again I will repel them which now of these three thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showeth Mercy on him then Jesus said unto him go and do thou likewise [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign amen I would like us to just ask the Lord for our blessing father Lord we would believe that this moment is a swarmed moment as we approach your word now yes realize without you I can do nothing as you've dropped that dropped it down on my heart may you now give me utterances let me only speak what you want me to speak let me be silent where I would speak and that you would speak Lord to your people in Jesus Christ so uh as a disclaimer I want to say that I'm a bit wearing the In the Flesh I don't think that I'll do much of a preaching today amen [Music] so yesterday I was in entebbe at the fellowship there is we had a good time with the young people we had about maybe 15 or 12 I don't remember [Music] they want us to keep going back today so we we should continue to pray for those young people there I believe something will come out of there because you know they have about two or three who are really interested in hearing the message foreign that they have questions actually one one young girl one young lady she's um she she was asking me about women preachers and so from there we had gone to the Genesis to speak on the serpent seed fast can use of the rebounding so we we did not conclude so uh you remember them in prayer now speaking on Rescue the perishing [Music] my mind goes back many years ago when my mother used to uh you know my of course my family where I was raised there were ministers my father I preacher my mother I preacher and so they used to especially my mother she used to see those children that have been malnutritioned and maybe they have a big belly and then should you know bring them home and take care of them I remember there is this one little child and as you know she started to take care of her and you know you know I have Billy which was big like this you know started to subside she became normal and started eating normally and you see how my mother Joy when these people you know something happened in their lives at our home we were never alone we always had these children that my mother was taking care of I don't know uh I don't know no my mother that my mother is here maybe I can have the liberty of asking her how many do you have at home six how many of those are your grandchildrens looks like she's continuing with her business because I mean like how many grandchildren do you have in Toto she only has one at home of our grandchildren and then there are others five of them are not related right in any way but she's allow me to use the word rescuing them and I believe it's a good attitude when I looked at my life I noticed I'm kind of maybe my mother spoiled me I'm kind of it's very difficult for me to see someone in need [Music] I always feel that it's a responsibility that I have to take up but I come to think of either this is not um only physical condition but it is also spiritual and here in the scripture is that Jesus Christ gave a parable yes and you know this man as he was coming from Jerusalem going to Jericho he fell among Thieves now if you've been in one of our traditional churches you've had this many times but today I will not approach it in a denomination or religious way s you can get the application of these things so this man coming from Jericho going to Jerusalem coming from Jerusalem going to Jericho um he fell among Thieves and they stripped to him of his clothes they wounded him and they departed they left this man half dead and now the Bible says by chance and now some of you believe in chance oh believe in um praise the name of the Lord but I believe we are not chance the people we meet in life we don't meet them by communities we don't even meet them by chance but allow me to say we meet them by God is designed are you hearing me you see we are at a place where I can 100 say that we are standing right in the middle of the will of God [Music] if you're hearing what I'm speaking to you today you are hearing the will of God for your life if you believe it is what did the priest see nothing don't worry he saw him he passed by the other side and he said likewise he looked on him that he passed by on the other side but he says the Bible did not say by chance are you following me the Bible you know you remember when Jesus was passing by uh Samaria the Bible did not say by chance but the Bible says he needed to pass them it was by design it was by foreign he looked on him and he went to him and bound up his wounds powering in oil and wine my mind Russia is not Ethiopia one time in Ethiopia he was driving my daughter to school Elizabeth you know just around her school I find this um this young man but you know um he he looked like he was having him and so when I looked on him my heart you know was filled with compassion and I said to myself before I could drop my daughter I had to stop the car and I talked to him [Music] [Music] recently he was telling me that you know he sent me a picture when he's driving he said he said he said I'm driving I said praise the Lord and now in the physical it looks like a very good thing it is a very fulfilling thing in the physical to help somebody [Music] feel that fulfilling a feeling be a Good Samaritan but today I don't want to speak on the physical that much I want to speak on the spiritual and so you went on and and to him and he bound up his wounds oil and wine on his own he said him on his own beast and brought him and he took care of him and on tomorrow when he departed he took out two pens and give to them to the hosts and gave them to the horse and said to him take care of this young man and whatever you spend more I will come again and I will repay I don't believe that this story is just a story Jesus spoke in Parable yes [Music] [Music] to perish on foreign how the Mana came down from heaven and got a man we call it Angel's food and then he says Jesus Christ God himself coming down from glory and he came down to the Earth and he says he died he came to die so that he might rescue the parish he says he was Heavenly make us [Music] if he did not leave his glory come down to a place that is despised can you imagine God himself [Applause] [Music] amen God himself [Music] do you ever think of it Christ became me that I might become him and he says oh my that would shake the heart of an infidels if we ever looked at it Christ becoming sin Christopher knowing no sin yet he was medicine that through the righteousness of his life would might be redeemed and stand by his side do you know that the Bible says came to Christ having murdered an unbeliever the believer sanctifies in the same way if a woman came to church Christo having previously married an unbeliever attack sanctifies that's what marriage is if that wasn't the case the children they give back would have been how do they call them yep [Music] bastards yes but you see now he says they are holy because the the other one sanctifies the others Jesus Christ came down from glory and he was United with us and he is Holiness becomes ours in other words glory to God now I want us to look about three to about to look on about three or four things here from Jerusalem to Jericho that's one thing I want us to look at is it has a very big significance now he says in our sin our sin is at a very cast City Jericho our sin the sin here of this man the man coming from from Jerusalem going to Jericho now and a man like we read of the Good Samaritans when he was coming down from Jerusalem going to Jericho he was backsliding coming out of the of the city of the blessings going to the city of the Cox and that's when he fell among things spirit [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] watch it and he says I am the door I can assemble Young by me if any man enter in um he shall be saved and shall go in and out and fight bastards the thief cometh not yet but for still and to destroy but he says he says [Applause] and the Wolf catches the Indian sequence hearing free the hearing Shepherd fleece because he is not for the ship Jesus says he's trying to say I am the Good Samaritan and um and it says I know I know my sheep and I'm known of mine does the father now with me even so I know the father and I laid down my life for the ship this gospel we are preaching it is not a traditional kind of religious ritual Jesus yes the Lord Of Glory gave his own lives foreign Jesus gave his life foreign foreign [Music] [Music] life-changing Gospel of them he gave his life he gave his everything will rescue us he laid down his life for us and he is a real Shepherd all others that came before the denominations let me give an announcement did you know there is no religion taking people to heaven [Applause] with a message [Applause] foreign has made it real too foreign Generations hallelujah hallelujah he laid down his life away and he says all the others were saved and robots in the worldly pleasures oh goodness hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because pornography could not take me don't ask I'm here to rescue if you're bound by those demons by those Spirits you know let me tell you there is a good crowd of witnesses who can testify that you can live Holiness that there is no more people are living according to the world there are people or whatever living according if you've not been rescued foreign Hallelujah Hallelujah from all those desires the life without God oh he has rescued us out of that ah yeah all this came and steal from you to rob you of your real life's purpose Hallelujah I mean that's the intention of the devil is to rub you uh real life's purpose but I know there are people in our Generations Kingdom [Music] foreign foreign my heart foreign in outer place you know and and and and you know she said can you give me a ride to some place she was all smelly with all this kind of stuff but I said to myself what would Jesus do yes I said sure I'll give you a ride and the little time I went with her about the Lord and let me tell you every little bit gospel it will actually want your life [Music] foreign I'll never forget that prostitute Services no matter what kind of life he didn't ask this man who brought these wounds to you how deep are the wounds the situation baptism [Music] [Applause] Jesus Christ yes Crystal he wants to continue his release I said do not trust anything else without Christ do not trust anything else without Christ it is all singing son and a minute now it doesn't mean that we should just just be in the church all the Days of Our Lives no what does it what does it mean do what you have to do but remember don't do anything without Christ it is all sinking sound without Christ without Christ literally crystals but let Christ come in one time [Applause] foreign things are not going to work out for you because you're experience it's not going to work out for you because you know too much because you have connections or because you are great because you're from a good father maybe the same some things the Bible says that too much [Applause] of wives foreign [Music] foreign what account will you give you let let don't let the devil rob you of your youths when you are strong and energetic when you have time but you know a good day use it because you say for the right cause always if you don't use it for the right because the devil is right near you to use it for the wrong ones the second thing he said he was stripped of of Israel community in Revelation 3 17. the Bible says because you say I'm rich and increase with Goods this is our generation the Bible says we are wretched we are poor we are blind we are we are naked and we don't know [Music] [Music] was taken from this verse he says it was keep your Scots cleaning these men don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved and someone might even try to involve you obviously by steering a cross away from it now God is going to reward those who follow this device they are going to be closed without with uh with a to be closed in white even as he is close that is how the Saints are going to be close you know the Devil stay in our clothes in this generation even even speaking the women a woman is a very important thing God himself speaks of his church as a woman life cannot come foreign much money foreign that is true to do full you you cannot find them if you want to find your figure hey I don't know if it is to see our body is sorry you are looking at it you will never see them in the message are not Tomatoes [Applause] what are we looking for Teacher to know you are looking for character now let me tell you if you're a Son of God you will not look for an appealing dressy woman because you are not looking for a prostitute you are looking for a mother for your children you are looking for for your legacy you are looking for a daughter of God of good places like a princess the reason why you don't see this because your eyes you need something in the Book of Revelation 3. the Bible says you need eyes so that it can be applied on you so that you can see the right way when I saw my wife for the first time she wasn't appealing yeah God opened my eyes with you foreign again they are stripped naked by the devil sitanya Rambo dead he has done the boys into Sisters I've been looking I've been looking but then tonight either past Trends there have been many Trends in the past a giant of clothing many Trends was bell bottom while using a nine one see there was buggy there was quite many I mean even short Sunday but the whole of those Fashions we are covering the men up real good but now there was developed a new trend in the sixth Century it is to make men look like women because you find a man a real man um foreign foreign boys the Devil is a deceiver he has killed the generation but we are coming today let me tell you we are going to rescue all the sons of God out of that messed up and bring them to church everybody the devil has a Sinister motive question deceived the generations taught boys their girls and they are told girls they are boys it's a shame Johnson is a shame friends completely strip the generation for physical and Spirits the physical registration only shows the spiritual state of the church the church has been completely strict of all the Bible doctrines you find them baptizing babies and it is not nowhere in the Bible you find them believing in the Trinity of God that is wrong the three don't agree in one uh that's what the Bible says the position and the place of a wife in a home the place of her husband it has been completely confused they think they are going there as partners in marriage you are not Partners according to the teaching of the Bible in marriage and your wife is a part of you brother the Bible instructs the man to love his wife his own body the Bible instructs the woman who has made herself to us unto the Lord and he says that's the teaching of the Bible everybody strip the people from the world you find women preachers everywhere put that scripture there first Timothy chapter 2. you're not allowed to do that or even to be a deacon according to First Timothy chapter three now if you are you're fighting with that you fight with the Bible that have stripped the church they have not known the grace of Jesus Christ you see like you know it's Grace you can do what you want you

the stimulation of Revelations like like to around all over the place he said I didn't I didn't wake up the the neighborhood when the Lord showed me that the stimulation of Revelations when something is when something is open to you bust out um oil and wine um the Bible is associated together always I got the concordance and loops and there is a string of them like they are where wine and oil goes together all the time um when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his sins that's filled with oil they all get stimulated foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign oh you find a
