[31:48] message she's been streaming her
[31:50] Services I'm pretty sure she might be on

[31:54] now and so uh she has a few people that
[31:58] also would like to be
[32:01] baptized and also
[32:04] herself she she would also want to be
[32:06] [Music]
[32:08] baptized so uh those are very good
[32:12] news when you hear people who uh have a
[32:16] desire of receiving the
[32:19] word those are very good
[32:22] news amen and you're not happy with that
[32:28] we should really be happy with
[32:30] that so then that
[32:32] sister that
[32:34] group um and they all you know close
[32:39] to and then the group that B has been
[32:42] reaching out
[32:45] to uh and you know
[32:48] so those are the people that are really
[32:52] um uh leading us to you know have a
[32:54] burden for the city
[33:01] and the Lord
[33:03] willing
[33:05] tomorrow we will try and and and
[33:08] conclude uh the arrangement of getting
[33:10] that
[33:13] place where we shall be fellowshipping
[33:15] [Music]
[33:17] them you know that place already there
[33:20] is a a church that fellowships
[33:24] there it's a school hall
[33:29] so um they but the administration is
[33:33] ready to also have
[33:36] us because that that group only comes on
[33:39] Sunday
[33:42] morning so we thought what we can do is
[33:45] we can do an evening or maybe like a
[33:47] Thursday
[33:50] evening and also a Sunday
[33:56] afternoon so we will be uh collecting an
[34:02] offering uh for for helping us to
[34:06] acquire maybe a few
[34:09] chairs and also um you know maybe like a
[34:14] Pian
[34:16] piano um I think we need
[34:20] um um you can say about 1.5
[34:26] million uh to acquire those
[34:29] things so those who are willing and you
[34:32] know to
[34:34] pledge or to WR away give something
[34:37] towards that no
[34:42] cause we will do that after the
[34:46] service when and collect that
[34:49] offering you know the Bible says that
[34:51] until this gospel is preached the
[34:53] uttermost parts of the Earth
[34:59] the end shall not
[35:00] come so we have to bring in every last
[35:05] one and whatever we can do for the
[35:08] Lord let us do it let us do it we do not
[35:12] know how much we have here on
[35:15] Earth we are not trying to build a
[35:17] kingdom our
[35:19] own we we are furing the kingdom of
[35:24] God and we sent to do that
[35:28] how many believe that so in every little
[35:32] way that you can do
[35:33] it maybe by Prayer by giving by going to
[35:38] do
[35:39] something if you can
[35:41] witness do what you can do and and let
[35:45] us father the kingdom of
[35:47] God so this evening I want to speak on
[35:49] the great burden of the last
[35:54] Age The Great burden of the last age
[36:01] you know um I was looking at um we were
[36:05] having a conversation at my dining
[36:10] table with a few of our my young
[36:14] men brother Ken as well as
[36:18] pastor and you know we were talking
[36:21] generally about the age we are living
[36:25] in and brother Ken shared a quote
[36:29] which we are going to begin
[36:31] with and I thought that was very
[36:33] interesting and I thought I should share
[36:34] it with
[36:38] church from thean church
[36:41] age it says now before we go into the
[36:45] promise let me show again that the
[36:48] church has spoken by of of by the spirit
[36:50] in this book has two Vines whose
[36:53] interwinding branches composite
[37:04] but I say unto you and to the rest
[37:07] in as many as have not this
[37:12] Doctrine there it is he is speaking of
[37:16] the two
[37:18] groups one has the doctrine the for
[37:22] Doctrine another does not there they are
[37:26] scattered BR across the nations with
[37:29] each other's Doctrine opposing the
[37:36] other one is of
[37:38] God knowing his
[37:41] depths the other of Satan knowing the
[37:44] depth of
[37:46] Saturn now put it I'll put upon you none
[37:49] other
[37:51] burden so the word for burden is weight
[37:54] or pressure
[38:00] and later on brother bam would go on to
[38:01] show that every age has had has had its
[38:08] press you know I believe from the age
[38:10] from the very first
[38:13] age and here we are in the age
[38:17] called they also had their
[38:20] pressures he says the you know these
[38:22] were the dark
[38:24] edges he says the pressure of the dark
[38:26] edges was either Bend or be
[38:32] broken bow bow or
[38:35] die it was the
[38:39] Inquisition the power of the Empire
[38:42] backing up satanic
[38:47] worship praise the name of the
[38:50] Lord be organized open with your
[38:56] life remember th was the age of of the
[39:00] dominating
[39:03] female where you know the truth was
[39:06] almost completely removed from the
[39:10] earth you know the people you know the
[39:13] try Doctrine was was you know taken all
[39:15] over the
[39:17] world there was a church which which
[39:20] boasted to be the mother
[39:23] Church the Roman Catholic church and you
[39:27] see everybody else who did not support
[39:29] it all the doctrines of that false
[39:33] Church died they were killed you know
[39:37] they were taken in
[39:39] arenas imagine you know and then they
[39:41] would release dogs
[39:44] and and before they release them they'll
[39:47] tell them how many are willing to
[39:49] recount their
[39:54] faith and you know these women would
[39:57] would would
[39:59] refuse and the men would refuse they
[40:02] would say we would rather
[40:04] die and you see so they would take the
[40:07] women and open up their
[40:10] bellies with
[40:13] child and they would take out the
[40:16] babies and throw it to the to the
[40:20] Lions and and and and you know and you
[40:23] know they would leave them to bleed
[40:28] it was very bad but you know these women
[40:32] and children and Men did it for one
[40:35] reason because of what they
[40:41] believe and you see they would do it to
[40:43] one
[40:43] woman and she would see the pain that
[40:46] the other woman has gone
[40:48] through and they would come to her and
[40:50] ask her are you ready to save
[40:53] yourself and recount no I cannot
[40:57] you see there was an anointing upon
[41:01] them amen you know they had anointing
[41:04] upon them they were ready to die they
[41:08] were ready to risk it
[41:09] all the pressure which they had in their
[41:12] generation in their
[41:14] age was you know the
[41:19] Bowing to the organized
[41:24] religion I'm imagining if they can you
[41:26] know tell one of you you know bring a
[41:28] pistol and say whether you just join the
[41:31] Catholic church or you
[41:36] die I don't know how many I would remain
[41:38] with in the
[41:40] church but you see that's not even the
[41:44] only pressure of our
[41:46] age for them that's that was their
[41:50] pressure you know they had to make up
[41:53] their
[41:53] mind they had to bow or die
[41:57] you
[41:58] know it was banned to be
[42:03] broken but you see the Believers the
[42:05] True
[42:06] Believers of in that age they stood the
[42:10] test of
[42:11] time they overcame they stood with the
[42:14] word and those who were weaklings who
[42:17] did not have a
[42:19] backbone they bowed down and you know
[42:22] they then they did not die they accepted
[42:26] the false Doctrine
[42:28] they accepted to believe the false
[42:30] religion and the organized religion and
[42:32] be a part of
[42:35] it and they thought they were saving
[42:38] themselves but you see by doing that
[42:41] they died
[42:43] eternally but the Believers who died
[42:47] they gave their life's
[42:49] blood they will live
[42:52] eternally and those were the Bride of
[42:54] that age
[42:57] they overcame the pressure in their
[43:00] age even if it caused them to
[43:03] die they
[43:05] overcame it was a pressure you know it
[43:09] was a burden in their
[43:10] age but they were willing to pay the
[43:14] price they had a
[43:16] backbone they were willing to stand for
[43:18] the word and overcome the pressure of
[43:21] their but we see he says each age had
[43:25] its precious
[43:28] for example a great burden of the last
[43:32] age is the pressure of
[43:38] riches this is the burden of our
[43:42] age the pressure of
[43:45] riches if I asked here how many have an
[43:48] ambition of being
[43:51] rich all hands will go
[43:54] up it's the Press of edge
[43:59] not only that but also a pressure for
[44:03] soft
[44:05] living oh I'm going to talk about those
[44:08] things
[44:08] today and also another third thing the
[44:13] pressure for nervous
[44:17] tensions pressure of
[44:22] riches and N
[44:26] tensions in a complex
[44:29] age that we seem united we we seem
[44:32] unfitted to live
[44:36] in but you see if God sold fit for us to
[44:40] live in this
[44:44] age he will give us the
[44:47] grace to overcome in
[44:50] thisen when the spirit of the of the
[44:53] Devil comes in like a
[44:55] flag God Spirit come comes in and lifts
[44:58] up a
[45:00] standard the Believers of every
[45:03] age the
[45:05] Overcomers the bride in every age is the
[45:09] Overcomer she's the True Vine and she
[45:13] overcomes and lives
[45:15] above what the others are defeated
[45:18] in the bride in that age she will
[45:22] overcome so I don't care how many
[45:26] pressures have defeated
[45:28] others I am not in this age to be
[45:31] defeated like they are defeated I am in
[45:34] this age to overcome the pressures of my
[45:39] age I am going to live above
[45:42] it Hallelujah I am going to
[45:45] overcome I am going to be the
[45:48] Overcomer and you know the Overcomers in
[45:50] this age the Bible says to them that
[45:53] shall
[45:54] overcome I will give it to them
[45:57] to sit with me on my throne even as I
[46:02] overcame and sat down with my father on
[46:05] his throne the Overcomers of this age
[46:09] are going to
[46:10] rule hallelujah hallelujah
[46:15] amen now let us look at the pressures of
[46:18] this
[46:21] St Revelation
[46:25] 3 and may God help us to design these
[46:27] things as we go through
[46:36] them chapter 3: 17 now I cannot I'll not
[46:39] read the whole chapter but
[46:46] um it is speaking
[46:50] about
[46:52] from from vers
[46:54] 14 but I'm going to read only
[46:58] 17 because thou sayest I am
[47:02] rich and increase with
[47:04] goods and have need of
[47:07] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[47:12] wretched and miserable and poor and
[47:16] blind and
[47:19] naked the people in this
[47:22] generation the people
[47:25] inia they have this
[47:27] testimony that they are rich and
[47:29] increased with goods and have need of
[47:32] nothing you know we have a big pressure
[47:36] for
[47:39] riches whereby people will miss
[47:42] church because they're looking for money
[47:45] and the money they are looking for they
[47:47] will never
[47:49] find they seem to be running after
[47:51] something that is difficult to
[47:54] catch they more they run after
[47:57] eat the more difficult it is for them to
[48:02] catch the pressure for
[48:05] riches we have all these
[48:11] casinos L
[48:14] programs you know they go there why
[48:17] because you know this thing has come in
[48:18] our
[48:20] generation why everybody wants to be
[48:23] rich and to be rich fast
[48:27] H they don't want to
[48:30] invest time in their finding of
[48:34] riches when it comes to finding
[48:37] money they can do
[48:39] anything including Living
[48:42] Church including abandoning
[48:45] Fellowship including you know someone
[48:48] gets a
[48:49] job and it is it is 200 km from away
[48:52] from
[48:54] church and it's going to this place
[48:56] doesn't care whether they will go to
[48:57] church or
[49:00] not as long as I'm getting
[49:03] money you know it is a very weird
[49:07] generation whereby money has become the
[49:10] god of the
[49:13] people amen instead of church bringing
[49:16] them close to
[49:18] church money is taking them far away
[49:20] from
[49:21] church you find the priorities of the
[49:25] people how many of you if you called for
[49:28] a deal just during the church
[49:33] service deal for 1 million
[49:35] shs how many of you will choose to go to
[49:39] church
[49:40] service it's a question that you should
[49:43] be able to answer then you can know
[49:46] whether you are bowing down to the
[49:47] pressures of our
[49:49] age or whether you are
[49:52] overcoming what is more important to
[49:54] you is it attending a
[49:58] service or going out to get the 1
[50:02] million church is always
[50:04] there but this money is a
[50:07] deal that's why people come to church
[50:10] and they still take a phone
[50:13] calls they leave the phone on
[50:16] vibration because they are under
[50:18] pressure they want money they're waiting
[50:21] for someone who will call them they have
[50:24] made a deal and they know they have to
[50:26] be at church
[50:27] so you just don't wor to call
[50:29] me because whether I'm at church or not
[50:32] this deal must not pass you see they are
[50:35] not prioritizing
[50:37] God and that's why God is not revealing
[50:40] himself to them in a mighty
[50:43] way it is the pressure of the
[50:50] age and um I'm going to read out I'm
[50:54] going to do a lot of reading tonight so
[50:55] just follow me in
[50:59] he says now look at the first phrase of
[51:02] this
[51:04] verse because thou
[51:07] sayest see they were
[51:09] speaking they were talking as the
[51:12] mouthpiece of
[51:14] God this proves exactly what I said in
[51:17] verse 16 to
[51:20] 17 but they say it but but though they
[51:24] say it though they say they are
[51:28] rich that that does not make it
[51:31] right the Catholic Church says she
[51:33] speaks for
[51:37] God saying she is the assured voice of
[51:40] the
[51:42] Lord how many people can be so
[51:45] spiritually Wicked is more than I
[51:48] [Music]
[51:51] know but they produce according to the
[51:54] seed which is in them
[51:58] and we know where the seed came
[52:01] from thean
[52:03] church saying I am rich and increased
[52:07] with goods and have need of nothing that
[52:11] was her
[52:14] self-esteem the church inia is boasting
[52:17] for having so much
[52:21] riches follow closely
[52:25] now she looked at herself and that is
[52:28] what she
[52:30] saw she said I am
[52:33] rich which means that she is wealthy in
[52:35] the things of this
[52:38] world she is bursting in the face of
[52:44] gemes she's boasting in the face of this
[52:47] scripture in the Book of James chapter
[52:54] 2 I wanted to see what J said
[52:58] chter 2:
[52:59] 5 Heen my
[53:02] beloved you have the verse yes yes Heen
[53:05] my beloved Brethren has not God chosen
[53:08] the poor of this world rich in
[53:19] faith let me read again has not God
[53:23] chosen the poor of this world rich in
[53:25] faith
[53:34] what is the poorest country on
[53:37] Earth they
[53:40] said what's the most spiritual country
[53:42] on
[53:44] Earth
[53:47] Cong do you know the church the the
[53:50] country which has the biggest um number
[53:53] of message Believers in the world
[53:58] the
[53:59] world as one
[54:05] country but the
[54:11] poorest Pastor are you preaching us to
[54:13] be poor
[54:17] today just just follow
[54:19] me follow me
[54:23] today so James says
[54:26] God chosen the poor of this world rich
[54:28] in
[54:29] faith and haers of the
[54:33] Kingdom which he has promised to them
[54:35] that love
[54:38] him but ye have despised the
[54:41] poor imagine if a brother walks in here
[54:44] poor a poor
[54:46] brother some people don't even want to
[54:48] greet
[54:49] him but when you know a brother or a
[54:52] sister is
[54:54] Rich everybody wants to greet her or him
[54:59] oh sister oh God bless you because you
[55:03] know they have
[55:04] money so somehow you think that you will
[55:07] also maybe they will give you
[55:10] some and some people are very
[55:13] weird very
[55:15] cunning when they see someone coming to
[55:19] church and this someone is loaded with
[55:23] C when we come start pledging
[55:27] this person pledges a lot and gives a
[55:30] lot some people they are very good at
[55:35] strategizing you know they will go to
[55:37] them privately you see me don't didn't
[55:42] you see how song
[55:45] read God has blessed me but but my
[55:49] brother I'm having an
[55:51] issue ah I'm squeezed with life just
[55:55] borrow me some money
[55:58] money and and I promise oh don't worry
[56:00] brother and you see they use you know
[56:03] but this is all
[56:05] over is a spirit of the
[56:07] [Music]
[56:09] age I want to open your eyes to
[56:14] this and I hope after this
[56:17] service many will understand what it
[56:19] means to be a
[56:21] believer to overcome the burden the
[56:24] pressure of this last age
[56:27] and haers of the
[56:29] Kingdom which he has promised to them
[56:31] that love
[56:32] him but ye have despise the
[56:35] poor do not rich men oppress
[56:39] you and draw you before the Judgment
[56:43] seats do not they blashe that worthy
[56:46] that worthy Name by which ye are
[56:50] called and the prophet says now I do not
[56:53] suggest that a rich person cannot be
[56:55] spiritual
[56:59] but we all know that the word says very
[57:01] few
[57:05] [Music]
[57:07] are very few rich men and women are
[57:13] spiritual it is the poor that
[57:15] predominate in the body of the true
[57:20] church in the body of Christ the
[57:23] majority are poor
[57:26] [Music]
[57:30] well this is your Prophet you better say
[57:32] amen and a big
[57:35] one it is the poor that predominate in
[57:37] the body of the true
[57:40] church many Believers that I know are
[57:46] struggling now then if the church
[57:49] becomes full of
[57:51] wealth we only know one thing
[57:57] EAB you know what EAB
[57:59] means the glory is
[58:03] departed has been written
[58:09] over you cannot deny
[58:12] that so that is the
[58:16] word now let's talk about wealth in the
[58:20] church why there never has been such a
[58:23] show of wealth
[58:27] the beautiful Sanctuary he says why
[58:29] there never has been a show of wealth
[58:30] rather that's what he
[58:32] meant yes yes
[58:36] yes meaning at the age
[58:39] of the age we are living in is the age
[58:43] that has showed great wealth in the
[58:47] church compared to all other
[58:51] ages you know our
[58:54] age it is the age that shown great
[58:59] wealth never has been a show of wealth
[59:01] like
[59:03] [Music]
[59:04] today the beautiful
[59:07] sanctuaries they multiplied in number as
[59:10] never
[59:13] before the sanctu is churches the
[59:16] beautiful
[59:19] churches you just go and move
[59:22] around all the churches that were so
[59:24] small and Tiny
[59:27] and
[59:29] looking doesn't matter which
[59:31] religion just go and look around they
[59:34] all Bu The Magnificent
[59:37] build beautiful
[59:40] sanctuaries they have money this is the
[59:43] age which has
[59:45] money even right over here there's one
[59:48] denomination that has built a very
[59:49] beautiful
[59:52] Sanctuary it's a great show of wealth
[59:56] the various groups viy with each other
[59:58] to see who can build the biggest and the
[1:00:04] lovest everybody who builds they say
[1:00:07] ours is the most beautiful in the
[1:00:09] city ours is the most beautiful in the
[1:00:11] country and they build Education Centers
[1:00:14] worth unestimated
[1:00:19] millions and those buildings are used
[1:00:22] only one hour or two in a week
[1:00:29] now that would not be that would not be
[1:00:32] such a terrible
[1:00:34] thing but they expect this little time
[1:00:37] spent by the children in the education
[1:00:39] plant to take the place of the hours of
[1:00:41] training supposed to be given in
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:49] the what what it means that the age we
[1:00:52] are living in you know parents
[1:00:57] hand over their children to the
[1:00:59] school and they expect that the school
[1:01:02] has trained them
[1:01:05] over they no longer need to train their
[1:01:09] children I'm trying to show you by going
[1:01:11] through this that you see our
[1:01:13] age has lost the
[1:01:18] backbone our age has become so
[1:01:22] weak our age has bound down to the the
[1:01:27] precious but how many shall
[1:01:31] overcome money has powered into the
[1:01:33] church until different denominations own
[1:01:35] stocks and bonds factories oil wells and
[1:01:38] insurance
[1:01:49] companies they have powered money into
[1:01:52] the welfare and retirement funds
[1:01:57] now this sounds
[1:01:59] good you know Church come they come
[1:02:03] together and they have retirement
[1:02:06] funds they have welfare
[1:02:08] funds so if you're a part of the church
[1:02:10] a member of that
[1:02:12] church then you know you are a
[1:02:17] beneficiary you understand many churches
[1:02:20] have this
[1:02:24] program and they those these programs
[1:02:26] are not
[1:02:27] bad not even the way said it they work
[1:02:31] and they put their fund they put money
[1:02:33] to that
[1:02:36] fund they have a fund they build a fund
[1:02:41] where by you know when you
[1:02:45] retire you can always get like
[1:02:47] retirement
[1:02:49] funds welfare to help those who need
[1:02:53] help now this sounds good
[1:02:56] but it has become a snare to the
[1:02:59] minister for if they decide to leave
[1:03:01] their
[1:03:03] group more
[1:03:05] light oh for the love of
[1:03:07] God their pensions are lost to
[1:03:12] them most can't stand
[1:03:15] this and they stay with their pressure
[1:03:19] groups I have been in the mission field
[1:03:22] and I have
[1:03:24] seen many
[1:03:26] preachers you know you bring this
[1:03:28] message to them they see it clearly but
[1:03:31] they tell you if I leave I'll be
[1:03:34] poor if I leave I'll leave my
[1:03:37] salary if I leave I will leave my
[1:03:39] pension if I my welfare who will B me
[1:03:44] the church WIll B me and you know these
[1:03:46] things if I leave so I am sorry continue
[1:03:50] preaching this the first man in
[1:03:53] Ethiopia I met you know he even cried
[1:03:57] I'm sure my wife remembers him you know
[1:04:00] he cried after hearing this message he
[1:04:02] hugged me
[1:04:04] tight and and he said this message is
[1:04:08] the truth continue preaching it God is
[1:04:11] with you but for me oh for me I'm sorry
[1:04:16] I can't believe it if I believe it there
[1:04:19] many people will be
[1:04:21] disappointed and also how will I leave
[1:04:26] preaching
[1:04:26] it so is saying because of
[1:04:30] money many ministers will leave the word
[1:04:33] and stand with their pressure
[1:04:37] groups now don't forget that this is the
[1:04:40] last
[1:04:42] age we know that this is the last
[1:04:46] age because Israel has gone back to
[1:04:50] Palestine if we believe that he really
[1:04:52] is coming
[1:04:56] then there must be something wrong with
[1:04:57] those who are building so
[1:05:04] vastly praise the name of the Lord where
[1:05:07] some Believers read qutes like these in
[1:05:09] the early years and they started and
[1:05:11] decided not to build
[1:05:17] churches but you see we believe it but
[1:05:21] we also believe in
[1:05:22] building but we don't believe in putting
[1:05:25] all our program to
[1:05:29] building we believe we should also look
[1:05:31] after lost
[1:05:33] souls by the way that's the real program
[1:05:36] the true program of the true
[1:05:39] church you know sometimes we lose
[1:05:42] vision our vision is not building a big
[1:05:47] Cathedral our vision is reaching out to
[1:05:50] the very last
[1:05:53] Soul if God gives us the man to buy land
[1:05:56] praise the
[1:05:57] Lord if he doesn't praise the Lord but
[1:06:01] through the whole time we must never
[1:06:03] lose the
[1:06:05] vision the vision is to find the last
[1:06:09] one amen that's why we drive you know 10
[1:06:13] 10
[1:06:14] hours go preach you know in these
[1:06:17] Villages that's why we are you know
[1:06:19] starting out in this place that
[1:06:22] place you know actually when I was in
[1:06:25] you know some place in nebbe
[1:06:27] Cross as a young man who is doing a
[1:06:29] great work there and I saw I went there
[1:06:33] he showed me I was touched you know
[1:06:36] these are the things we should
[1:06:38] support you know why because it is
[1:06:40] bringing in
[1:06:42] Soul we are into the business of
[1:06:45] Soul we should never lose the
[1:06:48] vision we should never lose the
[1:06:51] vision but whatever else we can do we
[1:06:54] can do we will do
[1:06:56] but that's the business we are
[1:06:58] called it makes one thing that these
[1:07:00] people plan on staying here
[1:07:04] forever oh that the coming of Jesus is
[1:07:07] hundreds years
[1:07:11] of do you know that Religion Today is
[1:07:13] known as a big
[1:07:17] business you know whenever we have tried
[1:07:19] to find
[1:07:22] Brokers to fin us property
[1:07:26] you know they take you to a place and
[1:07:28] they begin showing you you see now there
[1:07:31] are people
[1:07:32] here here you can make good
[1:07:36] money this is what is in their mind
[1:07:39] because this is what the denominations
[1:07:40] have
[1:07:41] done they think that church is a
[1:07:46] business and indeed it is a business to
[1:07:50] them that's why you find even these
[1:07:52] younger people old ones on the streets
[1:07:54] preaching
[1:07:58] you think they are there because of the
[1:08:00] burden for L
[1:08:02] Souls many of but let me tell you many
[1:08:05] of them are there for
[1:08:09] money they
[1:08:11] preach and then they collect money
[1:08:14] offering there's one out down
[1:08:17] downtown he was collecting I don't know
[1:08:19] where they still there
[1:08:22] millions he has this oil he puts you're
[1:08:26] going to get a
[1:08:28] blessing 5,000 10,000 puts oil on you
[1:08:31] puts o on a
[1:08:33] blessing blessing blessing for
[1:08:37] money he's making
[1:08:39] money and you find young people on the
[1:08:42] streets they preaching because they want
[1:08:44] offering they want
[1:08:45] money they want money and you know
[1:08:49] that's why in the message our drive is
[1:08:51] not
[1:08:54] money come on now now our drive in this
[1:08:57] message is not
[1:08:59] money without
[1:09:02] price without money we are declaring
[1:09:06] this
[1:09:08] message amen amen you know that's why
[1:09:11] you young people you should not just
[1:09:12] always stay
[1:09:14] here don't look for a chance to preach
[1:09:17] here go out in the streets and
[1:09:21] byways go if you have a fire in you go
[1:09:24] and preach
[1:09:26] wi Souls be on fire for God do something
[1:09:31] for the
[1:09:32] Lord even you sisters go and witness
[1:09:36] invite a
[1:09:38] friend but you see church today has
[1:09:41] become a big
[1:09:43] business it is an absolute fact that
[1:09:45] they are placing business managers in
[1:09:47] the
[1:09:50] churches to take care of
[1:09:52] finances is this what God desires
[1:09:56] did not his word teach us in the book of
[1:09:58] Acts that seven Men full of the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost and Faith serve the Lord in
[1:10:01] business
[1:10:06] matters you can surely see why God said
[1:10:10] you say you are wealthy I never said so
[1:10:12] you say but I never said
[1:10:16] so so listen he says there are radio
[1:10:21] programs television programs numerous
[1:10:24] Church endeavors
[1:10:27] that are costing
[1:10:29] millions and millions of
[1:10:32] dollars well of course some when they
[1:10:35] read this quote they also did not read
[1:10:36] between the
[1:10:40] lines many of them said we will not do
[1:10:42] radio program we not do television
[1:10:44] program because we don't want to spend
[1:10:46] millions of doar but you see the prophet
[1:10:49] was showing us the spirit of the
[1:10:53] age you see wealth and Powers into the
[1:10:58] church the membership increases along
[1:11:01] with the
[1:11:04] money yet the work is not being done as
[1:11:08] it was done when there was no
[1:11:12] money men at that time would
[1:11:15] work there were no cars but the gopel
[1:11:19] went all over the there were no aanes
[1:11:23] but missionaries
[1:11:25] I don't know how they travel but they
[1:11:28] went all over the
[1:11:29] world how did they do it listen it was
[1:11:33] the burden of the word of the
[1:11:36] Lord but you see we now have more
[1:11:38] money we have airanes we have cars we
[1:11:42] have motorbikes we you know we have even
[1:11:45] how do they call you know those you know
[1:11:48] uh how do they call
[1:11:50] them
[1:11:53] yes Rockets or whatever it is
[1:11:56] but the
[1:11:57] gospel is moving slower
[1:12:00] now than it was moving
[1:12:02] there on the day of Pentecost they never
[1:12:06] had
[1:12:07] microphones think about
[1:12:10] it they preached on one
[1:12:13] day to
[1:12:16] 3,000 3,000
[1:12:18] people without
[1:12:20] microphone we have microphones today but
[1:12:24] can you imagine
[1:12:25] there is no one younger man that can
[1:12:28] even think of taking a microphone or
[1:12:30] rather a speaker going on the road and
[1:12:32] preaching to
[1:12:37] one why is the pressure for
[1:12:41] money the question the big question will
[1:12:44] be how do I
[1:12:47] benefit they would rather sleep in the
[1:12:50] bed and become so lazy but they don't
[1:12:53] have the burden for the
[1:12:56] the burden for L Souls let me tell you
[1:12:59] our generation is the
[1:13:01] worst and the pressure for this
[1:13:04] age you know people will become so
[1:13:08] traumatized because they don't have
[1:13:11] money they will not think of anything
[1:13:14] better because they don't have money it
[1:13:17] is not with
[1:13:18] money that you become
[1:13:21] great it is with a burden you have in
[1:13:23] your soul
[1:13:26] Hallelujah there was once two men they
[1:13:29] looked at the man at the place called
[1:13:32] Beautiful silver and gold Sur
[1:13:35] now but what I have I give unto you
[1:13:40] right in the name of Jesus rise up and
[1:13:44] walk does the church still have
[1:13:47] that that is what the church must
[1:13:50] have you that's what you should
[1:13:53] have if you don't have that then you
[1:13:56] have bowed to the pressures of
[1:13:59] the we must not rest we must not settle
[1:14:04] until we have what the
[1:14:07] apostles yes that
[1:14:12] manifestation that power of
[1:14:15] God are you following
[1:14:17] me that can make you eat when you have
[1:14:20] no
[1:14:22] money is the same power that made Elijah
[1:14:26] it he had no money do you know that
[1:14:29] Jesus said if you go
[1:14:31] out don't go with any P don't even go
[1:14:35] with a second
[1:14:36] clothing why because it's the Jehovah
[1:14:40] G provides whatever you
[1:14:43] need listen the church has to come to a
[1:14:46] place where we become
[1:14:49] Believers if you know what I mean we are
[1:14:52] not
[1:14:53] Believers we don't believe in the power
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:56] God but listen we must come to a place
[1:15:00] where we stop feeling sorry for
[1:15:02] ourselves because we don't have money
[1:15:04] like someone
[1:15:06] else are you hearing
[1:15:09] me the people who have accomplished a
[1:15:11] lot in this world for
[1:15:14] God and not the
[1:15:17] richest think about
[1:15:19] that they are not the
[1:15:22] richest in fact they're the poorest
[1:15:26] William Bram was a very poor man did you
[1:15:29] know did you
[1:15:31] know he didn't have money he even
[1:15:35] rejected $1.5
[1:15:39] million he didn't have
[1:15:41] money he didn't have money he was
[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:47] broke and you you can't do anything for
[1:15:52] God because you feel you are brok
[1:15:57] let let me tell you our
[1:16:00] economy the economy of this
[1:16:02] world is different from the economy of
[1:16:06] God when God wants to do
[1:16:09] something nothing can stop
[1:16:12] him not the lack of
[1:16:14] money or the availability of
[1:16:19] it if we the Believers understand
[1:16:22] that we shall learn to walk by
[1:16:27] you take your Bible and study it you
[1:16:30] find all the great men and women
[1:16:32] of that God me to do big
[1:16:35] things they were
[1:16:37] poor as per the world
[1:16:42] standards all the
[1:16:44] disciples were poor
[1:16:46] men why didn't he make zakus one of the
[1:16:52] disciples zakus
[1:16:57] oh Zak
[1:17:00] okay you know he was a tax
[1:17:03] collector he had a lot of money he had
[1:17:05] cheated from these kind of friends
[1:17:07] people he had a lot of
[1:17:09] money he never made him one of the
[1:17:12] disciples but he chose Peter a fisherman
[1:17:15] a poor man and you you are saying you
[1:17:19] cannot do anything for God because
[1:17:20] you're
[1:17:21] poor you cannot dress properly and come
[1:17:24] to church because you don't have money
[1:17:25] to
[1:17:27] buy list we have another
[1:17:31] economy the work of God is reliant on
[1:17:36] God's
[1:17:38] economy we are besting on God his
[1:17:41] economy my
[1:17:42] brother not on the economy of this
[1:17:45] world that's why for you to give to the
[1:17:49] work of God it is an opportunity for you
[1:17:55] a great
[1:17:56] opportunity because you know what if you
[1:17:59] don't give God will continue with his
[1:18:03] work if I don't give God will continue
[1:18:07] with his
[1:18:08] work if I don't serve God will continue
[1:18:11] with his work if I Don't Preach God will
[1:18:15] continue saving Souls how God has a
[1:18:18] great big
[1:18:20] economy God has men and
[1:18:23] women that you don't even know
[1:18:25] of for you to serve him it is an
[1:18:31] opportunity you are not helping
[1:18:34] God God is helping
[1:18:38] youu you are the masses of
[1:18:41] him and you find Elijah he was there
[1:18:44] crying oh God I'm the only one
[1:18:49] remaining they have killed all of them
[1:18:52] God said look at this one now
[1:18:55] look at this don't you know I have more
[1:19:01] 7,000 that have not even bow a
[1:19:04] knee to
[1:19:06] Bow like what what
[1:19:10] 7000 not 1 2 3
[1:19:13] four
[1:19:17] thousand whatever I am
[1:19:19] doing I'm not doing it for
[1:19:22] money I am working and serving at the
[1:19:25] mercies of
[1:19:27] God and I know it's an opportunity God
[1:19:29] has given
[1:19:30] me hallelujah amen it's an opportunity
[1:19:34] for me to serve
[1:19:35] him Hallelujah if I behave bad God has
[1:19:40] 7,000
[1:19:43] God have Mery upon me God you whatever
[1:19:47] you are
[1:19:49] doing in whatever area in the house of
[1:19:53] God brother Marin for you to sit
[1:19:58] there for you to sit there and just run
[1:20:02] this thing
[1:20:03] here as simple as it
[1:20:07] looks God has 7,000 ready to
[1:20:14] replace that applies to each of
[1:20:17] you God has
[1:20:20] 7,000 ready to replace
[1:20:22] you you just misbehave
[1:20:25] okay go on the
[1:20:29] side what then manner of men should we
[1:20:32] be and women when we are serving and
[1:20:38] ministering we should stay
[1:20:42] consecrated we should you know be
[1:20:44] desirous of God to you know move in our
[1:20:48] lives and use
[1:20:50] us as
[1:20:53] servants and you see here he says wealth
[1:20:56] Powers into the
[1:20:58] church membership increases along with
[1:21:00] the
[1:21:01] money yet the work is not being done as
[1:21:04] it was done when there was no
[1:21:07] money but men rested solely on their
[1:21:10] ability given them by the Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost may God help us to rest on the
[1:21:18] ability given to us by the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost they are paid now here is what he
[1:21:25] says about this
[1:21:27] generation there are paid
[1:21:31] Preachers did you know in most of the
[1:21:34] churches
[1:21:35] today preachers are on a
[1:21:39] salary so they are not preaching because
[1:21:41] they are
[1:21:43] called imagine what would you
[1:21:46] do if someone gives you a
[1:21:48] job and pays you for
[1:21:51] it you will do your best to please
[1:21:56] who your boss and in this case who is
[1:21:59] your boss the one who pays you so who
[1:22:02] pays
[1:22:04] you the church the people right so then
[1:22:09] you have to please those
[1:22:11] people not make them
[1:22:14] sad but you see if you preach what the
[1:22:16] word says without changing it you are
[1:22:20] going to make the people sad
[1:22:22] sometimes you remember I told you story
[1:22:25] of a pastor who you know had of a
[1:22:28] brother talking about women
[1:22:32] preachers and also about you know
[1:22:34] dressing scany
[1:22:36] cloths and you know he came and T it in
[1:22:39] his
[1:22:40] church and when he told it some two
[1:22:43] sister
[1:22:44] three the great financiers of the
[1:22:48] church the ones who give big
[1:22:51] seeds they they said ah he's attacking
[1:22:55] they picked their books and off they
[1:22:58] left and he saw them
[1:23:02] leaving he said Brethren please come
[1:23:05] back in the church I was just
[1:23:09] joking and they had to come back and the
[1:23:12] brother
[1:23:13] changed so today let's go in the real
[1:23:18] thing and he left the
[1:23:21] word oh you think it is comedy
[1:23:25] but wait until you sit in one of those
[1:23:28] churches and how these people
[1:23:31] compromise because these people are
[1:23:34] their
[1:23:34] [Music]
[1:23:36] bosses they are paid
[1:23:38] preachers they paid
[1:23:41] assistant paid Ministers of
[1:23:44] music you know you find you know all
[1:23:46] these people by the way you
[1:23:49] musicians out there in the world they
[1:23:52] pay
[1:23:53] everyone the the drama
[1:23:56] Rees a monthly or
[1:24:00] weekly you know
[1:24:02] organist they have a full band but each
[1:24:06] person is
[1:24:07] paid think about
[1:24:10] that each person and you know what these
[1:24:12] young men do they cannot play in the
[1:24:15] same
[1:24:18] church why because they have to find the
[1:24:22] church which pays better
[1:24:26] so if if dvf gives them one
[1:24:31] 100,000 he will
[1:24:34] assess look at evening light how much
[1:24:38] you uh 1
[1:24:40] million you will not even see them again
[1:24:43] they'll be playing the other
[1:24:46] side you think I'm joking you don't know
[1:24:49] that these things
[1:24:50] happening in the in the denominations
[1:24:52] out there why I love this message of the
[1:24:56] hour hallelujah amen and the True
[1:24:59] Believers of this
[1:25:01] message if God has given you a gift you
[1:25:04] will not bow to the pressures
[1:25:08] of with without
[1:25:11] money you freely given you freely
[1:25:16] gave we preach to please the Lord you PR
[1:25:21] to please the
[1:25:22] Lord this is life of
[1:25:26] service not profit
[1:25:29] making but you see the one you are
[1:25:32] serving is faithful to reward every one
[1:25:35] of your
[1:25:39] lab
[1:25:40] Hallelujah paid custodians programs and
[1:25:46] entertainment all costing great
[1:25:51] psms but for all that the power is
[1:25:56] decreasing yes the church is Rich but
[1:26:00] the power is not
[1:26:02] there God moves by his
[1:26:05] Spirit not by the amount of
[1:26:08] money or talent in the
[1:26:11] church we don't want your
[1:26:15] talent we want the spirit of God working
[1:26:17] through
[1:26:20] you praise the name of the Lord that is
[1:26:23] how amen true servants inia will
[1:26:28] be you want to be
[1:26:31] sure spirit of God is
[1:26:34] using you have waited upon
[1:26:37] God for your service for the work you're
[1:26:40] doing for the Lord whether it is in a
[1:26:42] music department
[1:26:45] interpretation preaching you know even
[1:26:48] even being late in the
[1:26:53] church don't just come let the spirit of
[1:26:56] God use
[1:26:59] you you know you cannot receive the word
[1:27:01] when you are in the
[1:27:03] flesh enter the
[1:27:06] spirit and you know you begin to receive
[1:27:09] it you will begin to amend the word amen
[1:27:12] amen receive
[1:27:17] Lord now I want to show you how
[1:27:19] diabolical this agge for money has
[1:27:21] become
[1:27:25] the churches have gone all out to get
[1:27:29] membership especially of the
[1:27:32] wealthy these things are really very
[1:27:35] good
[1:27:36] principles if we understand it it will
[1:27:39] differentiate it will help you to
[1:27:41] understand why we are different from
[1:27:45] denomination you know they try to get
[1:27:47] the membership of
[1:27:49] people especially the wealthy
[1:27:52] ones everywhere there is cry to make
[1:27:54] religion so
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:58] attractive I've even seen some time back
[1:28:02] on on
[1:28:03] YouTube so this Minister who changed
[1:28:06] literally
[1:28:08] everything brought something like a
[1:28:10] bouncing castle in
[1:28:12] the you know he has this
[1:28:14] screen you know he puts it there it
[1:28:17] changes
[1:28:19] colors very
[1:28:21] attractive and the colors that are
[1:28:23] changing
[1:28:24] are all reflected in what he has
[1:28:28] dressed and you know you know when you
[1:28:30] see him walk the way he has cut his
[1:28:34] hair this kind of
[1:28:36] style and you know the
[1:28:38] shoes the whole place
[1:28:41] looks so
[1:28:43] attractive and you know um then he was
[1:28:46] demonstrating whatever he was so he went
[1:28:48] on this the way he was delivering his
[1:28:51] suon on this is it called bouncing
[1:28:53] Castle
[1:28:55] so he was you know having a microphone
[1:28:58] of course on him
[1:29:00] somewhere and so he bounces as talking
[1:29:04] to the
[1:29:04] people Mak some acrobatics for and
[1:29:12] all imagine now someone come to
[1:29:15] church church
[1:29:17] is it's not like those places where you
[1:29:20] go and you are convicted and
[1:29:22] condemned you see it's all about
[1:29:25] what it's about getting
[1:29:28] membership so the money can flow it's
[1:29:32] all about money everywhere there is a
[1:29:34] cry to make religion so
[1:29:43] attractive Catholic
[1:29:47] pra and you
[1:29:48] say
[1:29:50] speak
[1:29:52] wait am I in religion
[1:29:59] in by the time I was
[1:30:02] in we do soft things you
[1:30:06] know little little slowly but
[1:30:10] today inating this cathal one of the
[1:30:15] cathal and they the songs we
[1:30:19] sing and they
[1:30:22] Dan I was like what
[1:30:26] so now you tell a young
[1:30:30] man he tell you why do I leave I'm I'm
[1:30:33] enjoying
[1:30:35] here uh plus I'm not being
[1:30:40] condemned I'm not being
[1:30:42] condemned so religion has become so
[1:30:47] attractive and appealing appe appealing
[1:30:50] that the rich and cultured and all who
[1:30:52] have worldly prestige will come in and
[1:30:55] be active in the
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:03] church can't they understand that if
[1:31:07] wealth is the Criterion of
[1:31:13] spirituality then the world already has
[1:31:17] God and the church has
[1:31:19] nothing because the church is
[1:31:22] poor the true church has is been
[1:31:25] poor I don't care how any message Church
[1:31:28] in the world
[1:31:31] is to the standards in their
[1:31:35] country their church is
[1:31:39] poor the Catholic church in every
[1:31:42] country is the
[1:31:44] richest biggest
[1:31:46] numbers so how come they are that way
[1:31:50] yet we are the ones with the
[1:31:52] truth because we don't measure
[1:31:56] spirituality by how much money we have
[1:31:59] GED for
[1:32:03] ourselves now in thean church age
[1:32:05] brother says now this is nothing against
[1:32:07] rich
[1:32:10] people because God can serve a rich
[1:32:14] man some of God's children are
[1:32:17] rich but money can be such a
[1:32:22] snare not only those who have
[1:32:25] it but also to those who don't have
[1:32:29] it way back there in the first
[1:32:32] age James cried out to those who were
[1:32:34] putting stock in the wealthy
[1:32:40] people have not the Faith of Our Lord
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ with respect to
[1:32:44] persons have not the Faith of Our Lord
[1:32:46] Jesus with respect to
[1:32:51] persons have not the faith of of our
[1:32:54] Lord Jesus Christ with respect of
[1:33:00] pass you know what happened in our
[1:33:03] church as we were growing
[1:33:06] up the rich ones the
[1:33:08] politicians they had special
[1:33:13] seats the the rich ones they had special
[1:33:18] seats and the others like
[1:33:20] that and the poorest they I'll be the
[1:33:24] other
[1:33:26] side that's how most of the churches
[1:33:29] do even in the Pentecostal
[1:33:32] churches because to them money is
[1:33:37] everything you
[1:33:39] see don't have the Faith of Our Lord
[1:33:43] Jesus Christ with respect of
[1:33:49] persons the poor there were trying to
[1:33:51] but up the rich in order to get
[1:33:57] help they were buttering them up so that
[1:34:00] they can get
[1:34:04] help don't do it Jim
[1:34:07] says don't do it money isn't
[1:34:11] everything money isn't the
[1:34:14] answer tell your neighbor money isn't
[1:34:16] the
[1:34:17] answer and today it is not the answer
[1:34:22] either we more wealth than we ever
[1:34:26] had and yet less is being accomplished
[1:34:31] spiritually it is not with money that
[1:34:33] God
[1:34:35] works he moves by his
[1:34:39] spirit and amen that that moving of the
[1:34:42] spirit comes only to a life consecrated
[1:34:44] to the
[1:34:47] word it is not with money that God
[1:34:51] works I want to repeat that it is not
[1:34:55] with money that God
[1:34:58] works how many want God to work for
[1:35:01] them it is not with money that God
[1:35:04] works God moves by his
[1:35:08] Spirit money is not the
[1:35:11] answer money isn't
[1:35:14] everything God Is The Answer God is
[1:35:17] everything a supernatural
[1:35:20] experience can give you everything you
[1:35:22] have ever dream
[1:35:25] we have more money and yet we have
[1:35:27] accomplished
[1:35:30] less you see we we say we are going to
[1:35:33] do this youth convention and other
[1:35:36] things some people think if they don't
[1:35:39] give us their
[1:35:40] money we will not do
[1:35:43] it let me tell you if something is the
[1:35:46] will of
[1:35:48] God it can never
[1:35:50] fail no man can
[1:35:52] fail church is not running because of
[1:35:56] money we need the money but God gives
[1:35:59] money
[1:36:00] anyhow so it is God who runs the
[1:36:03] church not money please understand what
[1:36:07] I'm saying in the church when Jesus was
[1:36:10] the pastor on
[1:36:12] Earth he even called them from their
[1:36:17] jobs they were no longer
[1:36:19] working and then it didn't mean because
[1:36:21] they're not working they should not pay
[1:36:22] tax
[1:36:26] so when the government need a
[1:36:28] tax wait a moment how are they
[1:36:31] feeding how are they
[1:36:35] sleeping we are talking about the
[1:36:37] economy of
[1:36:39] God Amen but you see when it came to the
[1:36:42] time of the
[1:36:45] government you see they needed
[1:36:47] money God just told
[1:36:49] Peter want what money just go to the to
[1:36:53] the lake
[1:36:54] fish the first
[1:36:55] fish open it mouth take out what you'll
[1:36:59] find inside and give it to the
[1:37:02] tax what am I trying to share to say to
[1:37:04] you to share what I'm saying is it is
[1:37:07] not with money the church is
[1:37:10] run I'm talking about the Church of
[1:37:12] Jesus
[1:37:13] Christ I'm talking about the gospel I'm
[1:37:16] talking about the word you know whether
[1:37:18] we go on radio or we go out somewhere or
[1:37:23] we help this
[1:37:24] church you know it is by God the church
[1:37:29] runs whether we want to buy the
[1:37:31] church and f a sanctuary if it is the
[1:37:35] will of God if it is the plan of God God
[1:37:39] will do it
[1:37:40] somehow because Jehovah
[1:37:43] Gyra he provides for every
[1:37:46] need we can't understand that if we are
[1:37:50] not in the
[1:37:51] spirit but some people think money is
[1:37:55] everything my sister money is not
[1:37:59] everything if God wants you to get
[1:38:01] married he will provide you the
[1:38:05] money if God wants you to have a wedding
[1:38:08] he will give you the money it is God not
[1:38:11] the
[1:38:12] money that's why you should go to God
[1:38:15] whenever you have
[1:38:17] need don't go to
[1:38:19] begging go to God because he's the
[1:38:22] provider for
[1:38:26] hallelujah hallelujah how much do we pay
[1:38:30] here
[1:38:34] 800,000 we can't afford
[1:38:37] it we can't afford it that's why people
[1:38:40] who didn't understand
[1:38:42] that they thought they have to serve God
[1:38:45] in a place which looks so
[1:38:48] bad because we can't
[1:38:51] afford he looks around the people
[1:38:54] how many will he give me 00,000
[1:38:58] we can't afford it even me how much do I
[1:39:02] have oh we can't afford it ah let's go
[1:39:06] somewhere under a
[1:39:08] tree listen friends it is not whether we
[1:39:12] can afford it or
[1:39:14] not it is God who places it in our
[1:39:18] [Applause]
[1:39:20] pockets fish was fish fish didn't
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:26] money but somehow God plac money
[1:39:30] there amen God told Peter I will make
[1:39:34] you fish as of
[1:39:36] men amen we are fish we are been fished
[1:39:41] out of the world and when God wants to
[1:39:44] do something he will place the money in
[1:39:46] our
[1:39:48] pocket it is not the money it is the god
[1:39:52] who does it
[1:39:54] and he's still in that business he
[1:39:57] provides Jehovah G don't look at your
[1:40:01] father your mother your pastor look at
[1:40:06] God that's why if you serve him
[1:40:09] Faithfully he will always
[1:40:12] provide don't compromise your
[1:40:16] stand because you have no
[1:40:18] money whether you have money or
[1:40:21] not he provides
[1:40:24] if he wants you to do
[1:40:26] something sometimes we have
[1:40:28] desires and sometimes he doesn't provide
[1:40:30] for
[1:40:33] something well because it's not his
[1:40:36] time it's not his will but if you sure
[1:40:39] it is God's will what you're
[1:40:43] doing God
[1:40:47] provides hallelujah hallelujah he moves
[1:40:50] by his
[1:40:52] Spirit no by
[1:40:54] money church is not run by
[1:40:57] money but is run by the spirit a
[1:41:00] preacher is not fueled by
[1:41:03] money you see in the Pentecostal
[1:41:06] reals when you invite a
[1:41:08] minister he asks you how
[1:41:12] much will you pay
[1:41:15] me or he says me without $10,000
[1:41:20] here I can't come and have to look for
[1:41:23] it
[1:41:25] first when you put it on the
[1:41:28] table they
[1:41:30] Fu hallelujah hallelujah the anointing
[1:41:33] is
[1:41:35] money you see but let me tell you the
[1:41:37] Bride of Jesus Christ is not fueled by
[1:41:40] money we are fueled by the
[1:41:45] spirit
[1:41:47] Hallelujah and he puts money in our
[1:41:51] pockets to serve his purpose
[1:41:55] but you see the the the one of the
[1:41:57] pressures of this
[1:41:59] age is money
[1:42:02] money people want to be rich and they
[1:42:05] want to find money in one
[1:42:07] minute you know and and they they very
[1:42:10] because of that they very
[1:42:13] lazy you see you look at a man who is a
[1:42:18] millionaire and you you begin conting
[1:42:20] them I want to be like that but you're
[1:42:23] not willing to do what he
[1:42:25] did I mean the man has told you we had
[1:42:28] brother cosas here for
[1:42:30] instance he told us how he
[1:42:32] suffered how he worked for his
[1:42:35] uncle for years and he was paid
[1:42:41] only no at the end of the whole
[1:42:44] working he was paid he was dismissed and
[1:42:48] graciously and he was
[1:42:51] paid and that's all he had
[1:42:54] after laboring after sweating after
[1:42:57] working but you see that did not stop
[1:43:00] him and today he's a multi-billionaire
[1:43:03] now when people when young people of
[1:43:06] this generation hear
[1:43:08] that I want to be like but when it comes
[1:43:12] to work even little things they can't
[1:43:15] do you can't even Ser your
[1:43:18] mother only tell go wash tensil
[1:43:24] you can't serve her you can't serve your
[1:43:27] father go SL the
[1:43:30] compound and you sneak
[1:43:34] out you go begin playing football with
[1:43:37] your
[1:43:38] friends and then you come back is
[1:43:43] in in your
[1:43:45] bed l a
[1:43:48] generation you see but you you want a
[1:43:50] big
[1:43:51] thing let me prophesy to you
[1:43:53] if you continue on that
[1:43:55] rout you can never get what you
[1:43:57] want that's the
[1:44:00] truth you see riches don't come to poor
[1:44:03] riches don't come to Les
[1:44:06] people riches come to hard working
[1:44:12] people find something to
[1:44:15] do don't be La especially you young
[1:44:19] people now you are in your
[1:44:21] holidays stop sleeping
[1:44:24] 10 12 15
[1:44:27] hours okay to those of you who don't
[1:44:29] want to
[1:44:30] sleep you sneak out you go in in in
[1:44:33] football you go out in these other
[1:44:35] things waste your
[1:44:37] time you see that's Les and you know the
[1:44:41] reward of Les is
[1:44:43] poverty whether you have education or
[1:44:46] not find something to
[1:44:49] do become
[1:44:51] busy are you hearing what I'm saying the
[1:44:54] Bible actually says a man who cannot
[1:44:58] provide for his
[1:45:00] family he is worse than
[1:45:04] unin in other words he can't make it to
[1:45:06] the
[1:45:08] Rapture so what does it mean it is
[1:45:11] impossible for a man who is working for
[1:45:14] God to fail to provide for you it's not
[1:45:17] your job which you
[1:45:18] provide it is God who provide through
[1:45:21] the works of your hand
[1:45:23] because he said I will bless the work of
[1:45:25] your
[1:45:26] hands what are you doing with your
[1:45:29] hands you're waiting for a
[1:45:31] miracle some people they even go to
[1:45:35] church
[1:45:36] Monday
[1:45:40] Mir oh Thursday Friday Sunday for sure
[1:45:44] it is coming today it will never
[1:45:49] come after you have prayed go and find a
[1:45:52] job
[1:45:54] work tell your neighbor go and
[1:45:58] work see that's how God
[1:46:01] provides he provides through
[1:46:04] work but don't become
[1:46:07] lazy the pressure of this age is for
[1:46:10] people to get money get it fast that's
[1:46:13] why they are going you know in all these
[1:46:15] loty
[1:46:17] programs you know because they want
[1:46:19] money and they want it
[1:46:21] fast they will some will do do anything
[1:46:24] money anything for money they will put
[1:46:27] the Bible aside we shall come back later
[1:46:31] for now what can I do to get money no
[1:46:33] Brethren whatever you are doing First
[1:46:36] Take it through the lenses of
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:39] the if it is not taken through that you
[1:46:43] will surely
[1:46:44] fail money is not the answer God Is The
[1:46:49] Answer praise the name of the Lord and
[1:46:52] people want to live so
[1:46:55] I'll finish with this here in the man a
[1:46:58] man running from the presence of the
[1:46:58] Lord he says and Jonah here was called
[1:47:01] on and this one of the Minor Prophets of
[1:47:03] the Bible to go down to this
[1:47:07] city and here we find an example of all
[1:47:09] of
[1:47:10] us every one of us we always running
[1:47:13] from
[1:47:15] something we run from trouble we run
[1:47:18] from
[1:47:19] responsibilities and I go down he say
[1:47:21] sometimes we find ourselves PR to run
[1:47:23] from
[1:47:25] work we don't want to we don't want to
[1:47:31] work some people just thinks they can
[1:47:33] make their living without
[1:47:36] working is this our Prophet who
[1:47:39] saying now you're not saying amen you
[1:47:41] better shout a big
[1:47:43] amen is the truth but I think Solomon it
[1:47:46] was that said we could find here the
[1:47:49] answer in watching an aunt
[1:48:00] that's a very deep
[1:48:02] word I don't even think people
[1:48:04] understand
[1:48:09] it you know a little
[1:48:12] Aunt they tell me if that Aunt doesn't
[1:48:17] work every Aunt every Aunt must work
[1:48:22] you know how many they
[1:48:24] are and you know how many big ants they
[1:48:27] can
[1:48:29] be but they can't build it without
[1:48:32] others
[1:48:35] working each
[1:48:38] ant has to
[1:48:40] work together with another and then they
[1:48:43] build a
[1:48:46] big so brother says here they tell me if
[1:48:50] every ant doesn't work
[1:48:54] and just lay
[1:48:55] in that Aunt doesn't eat that
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:01] winter so everybody has to
[1:49:04] work we got so many things we have to
[1:49:08] do so much responsibility that we have
[1:49:11] to
[1:49:13] face everybody has to face a certain
[1:49:18] responsibility but our people in this
[1:49:21] generation
[1:49:23] the younger people you know what is
[1:49:25] happening they want soft
[1:49:29] living without
[1:49:32] work they want to drive but they don't
[1:49:35] want to work they want to live in a in a
[1:49:38] very beautiful
[1:49:40] apartment they don't want to work you
[1:49:43] find someone on their phone having a
[1:49:46] beautiful big
[1:49:48] house mansion tell this is my dream
[1:49:52] you tell them what are I doing now to
[1:49:55] get it I'm
[1:49:57] praying you're wasting your
[1:50:00] time you are not looking like someone
[1:50:02] who is working towards your
[1:50:05] dream work we got so many things we have
[1:50:09] to
[1:50:10] do so much everybody has got a certain
[1:50:16] responsibility okay our Prophet here
[1:50:18] says when you choose your
[1:50:21] wife to get married
[1:50:23] or to choose when you choose your
[1:50:25] husband you've got to take a
[1:50:28] responsibility and then you must
[1:50:29] remember maybe you've build a
[1:50:32] home it's a nice pretty home and then
[1:50:35] remember as a married
[1:50:37] woman you have got to think of the
[1:50:40] responsibility of raising
[1:50:43] children and you got to think of them
[1:50:46] pretty sequels going to have little
[1:50:49] dirty handprints all over them
[1:50:55] then you get you got the responsibility
[1:50:57] of educating your
[1:51:00] children you got a responsibility of
[1:51:02] clothing and
[1:51:04] feeding are you hearing so when you
[1:51:07] think about getting married you're not
[1:51:09] thinking about just enjoying time with
[1:51:11] your husband or your wife you must think
[1:51:14] of the
[1:51:17] responsibility have you matured enough
[1:51:19] to enter into that
[1:51:21] responsibility you think it is a Bed of
[1:51:24] Roses you see when you get married you
[1:51:28] think of of
[1:51:29] children you you you think of walls
[1:51:32] being
[1:51:34] DED and you have to clean and that's why
[1:51:37] people don't think of that
[1:51:39] responsibility when they go for
[1:51:42] marriage a child does some little things
[1:51:45] and he will hit him with a big
[1:51:47] slap until the ears will
[1:51:49] bur because this man was not prepared
[1:51:54] you didn't see this
[1:51:55] coming you must know that this is
[1:52:00] responsibility marriage is
[1:52:02] responsibility as a mother you must
[1:52:04] teach your children you must educate
[1:52:06] them it is responsibility as a father
[1:52:09] you must close them Fe it is
[1:52:12] responsibility everything is a
[1:52:15] responsibility and it is so easy when
[1:52:18] the responsibilities face us
[1:52:23] it is so easy to shock from
[1:52:27] them and we find out that marriage is a
[1:52:30] responsibility in all
[1:52:35] manners and that's why many young people
[1:52:37] this this time are running away from
[1:52:41] Marriage they fear
[1:52:44] responsibility oh God have Mery on our
[1:52:48] generation it has no backup on every
[1:52:51] many times this had this is how to say
[1:52:53] he says but it is true that ministers
[1:52:55] many times they Shar a responsibility
[1:52:57] for standing for the true word of
[1:53:04] God when they are confronted with it
[1:53:08] they will shock that
[1:53:10] responsibility when truth of the word of
[1:53:12] God is brought face to face with the
[1:53:14] human
[1:53:16] beings we are PR to shock back until the
[1:53:19] last resource
[1:53:22] I just got through talking to my little
[1:53:24] nephew up
[1:53:26] there he's a Catholic and I baptized
[1:53:29] that boy in the name of Jesus
[1:53:32] Christ here a few years ago and he got
[1:53:35] with some little girl and turned
[1:53:39] Catholic and I H his mother's hand while
[1:53:42] she was dying over
[1:53:44] there she said to me the last words take
[1:53:49] care of
[1:53:50] Melvin and he's just being Dreaming
[1:53:54] Dreams he he he and he talks about the
[1:53:56] one of the dreams of
[1:53:59] Melvin he says he's been Dreaming
[1:54:01] Dreams he said I would walk into your
[1:54:04] church Uncle
[1:54:06] Bill in his dream and he was standing
[1:54:09] there preaching and I would run up to
[1:54:11] start to make a
[1:54:12] confession and then I would wake up he
[1:54:15] said I have I have been
[1:54:17] wrong I said Melvin you don't need no
[1:54:20] interpretation for that
[1:54:23] your place is down there where you
[1:54:27] belong but to face up to the
[1:54:33] responsibility sometimes it takes the
[1:54:34] very hide off of us to do
[1:54:39] that as a father to face
[1:54:42] up the responsibility to give your child
[1:54:45] a
[1:54:47] weeping did you know even to beat your
[1:54:49] child a responsibility
[1:54:53] children to be
[1:54:55] beaten to be
[1:54:57] whipped by your
[1:54:59] father did you think did you actually
[1:55:01] know it is his
[1:55:04] responsibility oh your amens are now
[1:55:06] very
[1:55:08] dry yes them little
[1:55:12] fellows you don't want to do that but as
[1:55:15] a father oh as a mother you have got to
[1:55:19] F the responsibility of raising that
[1:55:22] child
[1:55:26] because the Bible said spare the road
[1:55:28] and you will spare your
[1:55:31] son and that still stands good in the
[1:55:35] sight of every psychologist there in the
[1:55:40] world that Still Remains God's
[1:55:44] truth if there had been more of that of
[1:55:47] that
[1:55:49] practiced we wouldn't have had so much
[1:55:52] juvenile delinquency
[1:55:56] and and the RO we got in the world
[1:55:59] today but the old Golden
[1:56:03] Rule are you hearing me now the old
[1:56:07] Golden Rule of the
[1:56:10] home has been broken long
[1:56:13] Ag and they let the kids do whatever
[1:56:16] they
[1:56:18] want every parent has a responsibility
[1:56:23] you cannot let your children do what
[1:56:24] they whatever they
[1:56:26] are if they feel they want to do
[1:56:28] whatever they
[1:56:30] are let them get out of the house let
[1:56:32] them be on their
[1:56:33] own yes but as long as you are under
[1:56:37] your father mother's
[1:56:39] roof it is the responsibility of your
[1:56:42] father and
[1:56:44] mother to guide you
[1:56:48] right but even as I said
[1:56:51] ministers come to face to face with the
[1:56:54] truth and then they walk away from it
[1:56:57] there seems like there's something that
[1:56:58] they don't want to face up
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:03] to they just want soft living let the
[1:57:07] children do what they did you actually
[1:57:10] know young people whose parents left
[1:57:13] them to do whatever they
[1:57:16] want they even boast about it and they
[1:57:19] say their parents are good
[1:57:22] they're not
[1:57:24] good they're not good a good parent will
[1:57:28] not let you do whatever you
[1:57:31] want and even God cannot let you do
[1:57:35] whatever you
[1:57:36] want because he's a good
[1:57:38] parent he will not let you have soft
[1:57:42] living even when he wants to give you
[1:57:45] something he will let you earn
[1:57:48] it he will not make you get it
[1:57:52] he will let you ear
[1:57:54] it that's how a good parent does you
[1:57:57] remember the story thatas M have talked
[1:57:59] about byas in this service so
[1:58:03] much he gave us a story here of a boy
[1:58:08] who was you know um having Rich
[1:58:13] parents and his father I don't remember
[1:58:15] the whole story
[1:58:17] proper but his father told him if you
[1:58:19] make so
[1:58:20] much and you bring it to
[1:58:23] then I think I'll do something for you I
[1:58:25] don't remember the whole story some of
[1:58:27] you
[1:58:28] might but then this boy you know went
[1:58:32] and um was GI took the first
[1:58:36] money and gave it to his
[1:58:38] father his father threw
[1:58:41] it in the
[1:58:43] fireplace and the man B and the boy was
[1:58:46] just
[1:58:48] there told him dad so what should I
[1:58:52] go go bring more
[1:58:54] money and make more
[1:58:56] money and and then you bring it so you
[1:59:00] went and brought the second and the it
[1:59:04] in
[1:59:05] the and said now that what what do you
[1:59:08] want me to
[1:59:09] do says go again now the whole
[1:59:14] time this boy was being given this
[1:59:18] money by his mom I think
[1:59:23] but on this one he said what is wrong
[1:59:26] with my dad let me go out and make my
[1:59:30] own
[1:59:31] money I think this playing a trick
[1:59:34] some so went and and and and made the
[1:59:39] money it took him a little longer but he
[1:59:42] swe it
[1:59:43] out and he brought it to his dad Dad
[1:59:48] here is the money this time here is the
[1:59:51] money and he knew what this money
[1:59:55] me he had sacrificed he for and his
[2:00:00] father took the money and he was going
[2:00:02] to throw it in the fire just like the
[2:00:05] first two
[2:00:06] times and a boy ran into the
[2:00:10] fire said you cannot throw myy like the
[2:00:14] fire I SED for
[2:00:17] this for this ah it's all right
[2:00:22] that's why the father was waiting
[2:00:24] for and you know why we always don't
[2:00:28] value what we
[2:00:30] have because you have not labored for
[2:00:34] them even God don't expect I'm trying to
[2:00:38] bring a principle to you here don't
[2:00:40] expect God to bring money from
[2:00:43] Heaven into your pocket you need to
[2:00:48] work but you see what God will do he
[2:00:51] will train
[2:00:52] you he will guide you you will ask him
[2:00:56] yes he will give you whatever you have
[2:00:59] asked but through your work through your
[2:01:02] labor and what he does when he brings it
[2:01:05] to you and you you will cherish it
[2:01:09] because you have labored
[2:01:10] for you have labored you not you will
[2:01:13] not even look for soft
[2:01:15] living imagine if if if you've gone
[2:01:18] there to sweep on on the on the road
[2:01:22] and you made
[2:01:26] 1,000 let me ask you a question do you
[2:01:29] think you'll buy a bottle of 1,000 water
[2:01:34] water you cannot do you can you've
[2:01:38] sweated
[2:01:40] for my
[2:01:42] 1000 you'll be thinking what can I do in
[2:01:46] this to multiply
[2:01:48] it but you see why people love so
[2:01:53] is because they get they get free
[2:01:57] passes your father gives you 100,000 and
[2:02:02] then you squand it SP it in one day two
[2:02:06] days that's what they do at
[2:02:08] school 100,000 after two weeks it is
[2:02:12] over now I'm suffering it's finished
[2:02:15] where did it go they don't know the
[2:02:17] value
[2:02:18] of they want stop leaving they can't go
[2:02:21] like for
[2:02:24] portion because they don't know what it
[2:02:27] takes to make
[2:02:29] thisy and want the soft
[2:02:32] food you know with his father's
[2:02:37] money and that's why Believers we don't
[2:02:41] support the work of
[2:02:44] God because we don't want to
[2:02:47] work and probably the money you are
[2:02:49] receiving you're not getting it properly
[2:02:55] you're not getting it in the right
[2:02:57] way but if you're getting your money the
[2:02:59] right
[2:03:00] way serving God with your money will be
[2:03:03] a
[2:03:05] priority you will choose serving God
[2:03:08] than having soft
[2:03:12] life you will not B to the pressures
[2:03:17] of and because people don't because
[2:03:20] people keep bowing to
[2:03:24] they always have they always have n
[2:03:27] nervous
[2:03:30] tensions anxiety pain
[2:03:33] heartbreak these are the things that are
[2:03:36] attacking Our
[2:03:37] Generation it's the pressures of our
[2:03:42] age let us stand our
[2:03:46] feet but
[2:03:48] friends I hope this will not just be a
[2:03:50] sermon
[2:03:55] these are things that are
[2:03:58] applicable in your
[2:04:01] life if you can take
[2:04:04] it and apply it in your
[2:04:07] life you will never be the
[2:04:09] same the musicians can please
[2:04:13] come let's

[2:05:01] living we cannot risk it with only the
