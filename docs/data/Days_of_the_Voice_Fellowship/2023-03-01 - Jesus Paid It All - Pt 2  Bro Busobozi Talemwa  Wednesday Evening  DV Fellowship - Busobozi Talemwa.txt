the Bible this is just going to be a continuation of Sunday together Sunday so we'll read the second Corinthians chapter five a recording is [Music] foreign [Music] for he has made him to be seen for us who knew not sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him foreign [Music] Lord Jesus we ask you this evening to come back to us once again reveal yourself to us and Lord by the end of this meeting is May our hearts Rejoice within us looking because we know that you would have spoken to him in Jesus name amen so Jesus Paid It All yes amen Amina that's what we will speak on tonight once again and I didn't get to to finish it on Sunday but I trust that you will be able to get somewhere tonight I'm happy to see every one of you I want to say God bless you sir are you ready for the word tonight amen so um we read a lot of scriptures on Sunday because Sunday and I did not plan on Sunday to deal with the serpent seed although I had to touch it a little bit yeah because you see there is no way you can be able to talk about Sin without talking about the origin the original scene there's not as many sins it's only one sin [Music] that is unbelief of the truth the others are just the fruit of that sin [Music] so when the Bible says that man's sin that he says that for that for all have sinned I believe you see the sin that was done was what actually happened in the very beginning [Music] that's why the Bible says that all of us you each of us are born in sins and so sin was unbelief [Music] when Eve when when God gave adam the word Adam was Duty bound to keep that word you not only believe every word but to keep it is not only to believe it then you don't need to ask them you only need to look at their life it is your life that shows whether you're a Believer or not you see when God gave adam the word and he told him you see every fruit every tree every tree you will eat of it but of this one you shall not eat of it and then Adam believed and then when God left of course later on we know that he takes the woman out of the man and then now they become man and a woman and so they are together man and woman in the garden we don't see God telling Eve the word again God spoke the word once and then Adam was the one that now took it upon himself to teach his wife what God had said that's why the prophet says that a man is a priest in in his house are you hearing me this evening that even God will require your wife on your hands if you're married and your wife does something God will ask you you will be responsible before God but not the other way around what your husband does brother you are not going to be responsible sister I'm not going to be responsible before God um but what your husband does what your wife does rather the man is responsible and is answerable before God that's why when a sister accepts to be married to a man who does not believe the word she has made the greatest mistake because this is what is going to guide your life this is the one that's going to read your life your entire life is so it is very important notice that when Eve sinned when she heard from another source when the serpent came and gave to her the word not the word of God but the word from the Tree of Knowledge from that time she had an opportunity to turn down what the devil had spoken to her or to accept it that was her golden opportunity to accept the word or deny you accept the word but you see she lost that opportunity when she decided to hear from the Devils except what the devil said you see that was the scene that was done listen that was the original [Music] [Music] foreign their life tells what they believe they were they dress their friends they keep an association the way they talk you know what they hold dear to their souls these things tell what they believe and so we say that in Eve she went ahead and act from that fruit and you see adultery or Wednesday came out as a result was not known to hide before always she only got an idea to do it after she had believed what the devil said and you remember how we went through that on Sunday we went through up the process the legal process of the prosecution of an offender when when of course when you've seen when Eve transgressed also Adam came and took part of it and so they were all seen as before God but then you see in the following the laws or the legal processes their life was doomed remember I told you that you see the first one was his investigation of the crime when someone when an offender is going to be prosecuted the first thing that they do is to investigate on them [Music] then the second is to arrest the suspect foreign [Music] do you remember what the punishment was what was the punishment can somebody says how many were here on Sunday morning what was it death when Adam seen when Adam and Eve sinned Adam they were supposed to suffer the ultimate punishment for their sins because the Bible says the son of sins that Soul shall die it shall suffer the ultimate punishment so you see when Adam and Eve sinned they were supposed to suffer the ultimate punishment of their sins because all that were born after the manner of Adam's children were born in sin because [Music] even if it was his own son Adam was supposed to die the Judgment was already passed before the scene was done because you know even the the the the judge himself he is bound by the law he doesn't give judgment according to his soul judgment according to what was already given in the Lord so you see Jesus or God himself as the righteous he had to judge Adam and hold his race now we know that we all are from the lineage of Adam so we were all condemned today we are all sinners on them to death there is no amount of things that we can do that can redeem us from that day Christian Believers I want you to understand there is nothing we can do that is redeem us from that day that is why it had to take God himself that's why the devil was so happy because he knew that this race is finished there is no way they can be redeemed because according to the law [Music] the penalty for dies [Music] foreign foreign hallelujah amen so that in him we would become the righteousness of God that is we would be made acceptable to him and blessed in a right relationship with him by his gracious loving kindness Hallelujah man if God did not become amen if he did not make his son sin Captain we would have been lost forever that is why we are not saved because of our own words because of his work on the cross you will stop saying should I do this or should I not do that you will know like what Apostle Paul says all things are lawful unto me Amen to your Navy and some agenda but not all things are experience Hallelujah man there is nothing wrong for me to do okay I can't do all things and still go to heaven but I must not do all things because all things are defined not to hang up you're not to be seen by what I'm going to do I'm going to do such things that give my God my savior My Redeemer Glory that is what Grace is you will not even have this mentality of works in your head [Music] on our behalf investigations were made on Jesus yes if Jesus Paid It All for us yes Jesus had to go through the whole process hallelujah amen he had to go through the whole process on our behalf investigations we were made on Jesus he was arrested as a criminal yeah right man on our behalf he was prosecuted he was arraigned before a judge he was sentenced to death he said it will work by crucification he never appealed the case Hallelujah man he never built a case he accepted the Judgment because he knew he was he was doing it for somebody he was doing it for somebody he didn't care how heavy the price was I didn't care how heavy the sentence is to himself I have to bear this ultimate price because of somebody because of my own rest he became a brother can you imagine God himself so that he can be able to die for for us remember it had to be our brothers became amen and that is the word confuses the devil says is he their brother or is he God he is all of it I live here the beginning hallelujah amen that's what Jesus is he paid it so that we can be free when he paid the price in other words foreign let me ask you a question whose land is it is yours it is your brothers because now he has redeemed with his money if your brother redeems it is right he has a right to do with whatever he wants to do with it hallelujah amen oh glory amen when Adam lost his brother came down Jesus Christ yes and when he came down he paid the price he paid a price by his deaths on Calvary yeah and now whatever he paid belong to him let me tell you he paid for me I am the one he redeems that means what I am not a property of the devil anymore I am the property of Jesus Christ that the devil could not be able to say anything else when it ever brings you sickness to tell him take your hands away [Applause] if the devil takes something from you because the price has already been gone [Music] if the devil takes your joy away you have a right to claim it back I imagine Jesus on our behalf did every the whole he went through the whole process yes and we could read a lot of scriptures I wonder let's it will take a lot of time but I could just give you a few Snippets here and there let us let us look at a few of those processes as Jesus was going through them as he was going through the legal procedure let us look in the Book of Mark chapter 14. quickly now as he was being arrested Mark 14.3 it says and immediately while he yet speak cometh Judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders and he that betrayed him and had given them a token saying whomsoever shall kiss that shame that's that same is he take him and lead him away safely and as soon as he was come he goes straight away to him and said master master and kissed him and they laid him they laid their hands on him and took him and one of the them that stood by by Drew a sword and smote a servant of them I priest and cut off his ear and Jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with steps to take me I was daily with you in the temple teaching and he took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled and they all forsook him and fled and they followed him and he continues on and on and here we noticed that when they came to arrest Jesus he told them I was with you in the temple the whole time why didn't you catch me why didn't you arrest me today you are coming to me with steps and Spears and knives but he says all right the word must be fulfilled what was the word which was being fulfilled criminal he was being arrested it wasn't Jesus being arrested it was you being arrested foreign Matthew 26 verses 57 he says and the they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled but Peter followed him a far off under the high priest's Palace and went in and sat with the servants to to see the end now the chief priests and the elders and all the cancer sowed false witness against Jesus to put him to death but found none yeah though many false Witnesses came he had found they none at the last came to false Witnesses and we can go on and on and on and on but I want you also to look at Luke Chapter 22. you can write this down and read them later at your own time I wanted to look at Luke 22 verses 6 to 6. okay can you read in luganda is [Music] [Music] he was prosecuted as a Son of God yes Adam Adam the Son of God Jesus had to be his brother yes are you following me now I want you to see when he was being arraigned before a judge Luke 23. and you know I was reading one of the uh articles I think about a year ago a legal officer in a lawyer in Kenya Kenya who said that he was taking the Roman government and the Israeli government to court government because they prosecuted Jesus in a wrong way but they just told told them to take that that they they don't have jurisdiction to hear that case and so he even tried to take it in the in in the international court so they also could not file it but to me I think it's lack of understanding you see Jesus did everything even when they were Prosecuting they found that indeed he was not guilty this is [Music] look look at it in your Bible and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate and they began to accuse him saying we found his fellow we felt we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidden to give tribute to Caesar saying that he himself is Christ a king and pilate asked him saying that without the king of the Jews and he answered and said thou sayest it then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people I find no fault in this man and they were the more fierce jewelry the beginning From Galilee to this place and you see when he was taken before a judge yes we are told are you hearing me Church what did the judge say again I find him not guilty see that and song and if you continue on from verse 6 to 12. and and and and also up to verse 25 not true you will find that the people say no even if he's not guilty we want you to crucify him we want you to make him guilty and the man washed his hands and he said that is no problem be a bonus the king told them foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Laughter] there is nothing you can do to worry Choice none of your works okay what you can do God will give you eternal life there is only one thing there is only one thing that had to happen to be free Jesus had to be incarcerated yes Jesus had to be condemned yesterday Jesus did it on behalf of God and when parabas was being set for free Jesus was being caught yes at that moment listen at that moment hey even if pilate wanted there was no way to release Jesus the moment was set free foreign [Music] if Jesus was not caught yes but Jesus died yesterday the action of Jesus yielding himself was the price because Jesus died on the cross I paid the price for your freedoms hallelujah amen how many believe that how many believe that Jesus paid for your freedom yes he died the fact that you could be free Hallelujah and he did it willingly anything bad of us could do was just in a napkin to what Jesus had done yeah my mind Jesus Paid It All yes the message the return on Jupiter says the blood of Jesus Christ that makes me white as snow oh God no other phone I know and he says I don't know no organizations but I always eat all to him Jesus Paid It All yes [Applause] hallelujah amen and when I read this you know when that is in Romans 8 1 I was like Jesus there is and then the spirit of God came on me and I wrote I said we cannot come in the Judgment ever um did you hear that we cannot come into judgment ever the teachers I cannot come into judgment neither are we [Music] don't go into the kingdom of God the bride of Christ listen the bride of Christ does not go into Heaven by their works is there anyone hearing me [Music] what takes us into eternal life is the price Christ and that blood where is that blood it is which is the Holy Spirit [Music] foreign I don't want you to miss this mystery that the moment you receive the message of the hour and you're filled with the Holy Ghost you have received your attention why why because you have received the blood the price has been paid is a confirmation of the tokens [Music] the moment that blood was put on the door on the door knobs Hallelujah a man is leaving Egypt no one was going to die inside but the other homes died because they were not eternally your house is banned a new [Music] we will make it foreign hmm and that's why he says that are for now no condemnation now not tomorrow but now there is no condemnation everybody comes condemned Jesus was condemned yes yes and he served the sentence whose life has been hidden in Christ I say no condemnation you will never come before hallelujah amen people speak about the words of Christ will never come before the white Throne judgment oh my God the next time when somebody tells you indeed tell them not to me because the bride the message it is for the bride the Bride is a very different problem the bride of Christ will not stand before the judgments according to his wife [Music] what about the action that Jesus now how comes that our actions will be the one to take us let me take leave our actions I'm not going to be judged before they were thrown judgment I'm speaking the actions of the Bride The Works of the Bride the others they will come before they went through again the Bible says the book of life and the both young and small everybody where will the bride be um [Music] foreign judgment interview another proof that we are not going to stand before it's because it happens much later you see what's going to happen first is the rapture foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] is going to be here the Bible calls it the Millennia um the pride of Christ will be also a ruler he will be ruling together with Christ that will be the time which will fulfill the promise of the Messiah continuing on the throne of David would you remember when Jesus came yes and the people saw here the Jews as he was entering Jerusalem he has come as they were thinking nobody knows that it was the Messiah who had come to redeem them from the Roman Powers yes he was the one yeah they asked foreign that would be a wonderful time there will be no sickness because the Bible says during that whole time that's what the Bible says that is the time when the bride oh my God will rule but who shall We Rule that's so nice so interesting we are going to rule together when the Rapture happens there will be what we call the Armageddon after white the third world war that will destroy everything you see these things happening between Russia America China they are coming to a showdown but it will come after the bright disruptions and when they destroy everything destroys everything there will be people who think they are very intelligent they have Bankers where they can escape and even nuclear power will not destroyed and they will hide away foreign what will happen as farmers yet oh my goodness yet before the destruction of the world the way the bill gets they're the ones who could afford bankers but in that our civilization the value and they will be making fire with stones they would have gone back to Stone Age and guess who will be the Lord's over there and we shall have such powers you call us audience but actually we will not be aliens to them we shall be aliens because you would have come from the sky somewhere but indeed we shall have come from heaven but originally we are from here but they won't understand can you see why we should serve the Lord and at that time when we are in that in that in that beautiful city before we are before we say anything but when we want something before we say it shall be there I want an apple yeah foreign [Music] whereas the years a thousand years the devil Satan listen the change will be put off and he'll come back to us you will start from where he is and the Bible says he he will enter into these inhabitors of the Earth [Music] and when they go like zombies to attack the city the Bible says before they even get to come close foreign you see in that Resurrection everything that ever died whether he died on mars or whether he died [Music] the bride and his room so you see where the bride is not on the other side and after everything because if you never may not go that's what the Bible says blessed day and holy is he my buddy that is not that is not part that is part rather that is part of the first resurrection because the second death will not have power over what is the second day the second death is not the death of the body Oaks is the destruction of many Souls you see we there we get another mystery from them I want to know nothing like an eternal hell do we see thereafter Empire I'm going to be there yeah hallelujah hallelujah the Bride of Jesus Christ cannot come into condemnation the condemnation we suffer is here on Earth almost e mother not my brethren if the world helped you then okay before I read that let me read this in John 5 24 it says very very sound to you he that here is my word and believeth on him that sent me again shall not oh my man can you say this with me and shall not and shall not come into condemnation that is now notice this is not future tense this is present continuous tense is it's already happened it has happened in the past check what the movie is helping the moment Christ died yes we have energy to count really was put into Force when you believed him we know that we have passed from death and to life to Jesus Christ that's why among the Believers we really have love for one one for the yard let me tell you I have been in another church before I believe the message but I can tell you from good authority that all over the world I've never seen a group of people that love each other more than disbelievers it doesn't matter where you go which country you find yourself Hallelujah just display the passport weather lost you in their home they will share their food with you they will give you everything why why only because you were a Believer and the Bible says this is how we are able to know yeah pass from Death to life because we love the Brethren he that love is not his brother abides in death whosoever ahead of his brother is a murderer and as you know that no matter who has eternal life abiding in him oh my God hereby passive we the love of God listen because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren Katina I want to say we are going in the rapture we shall spend eternity together the eternal life in you will make you love one another I don't care who you you choose to be your clothes Associated but as far as I am concerned my clothes Associates my friends my real buddies are those that I'm going to spend eternity with I was just thinking I was I was just thinking the other day and it's not been very long we've been in touch and we've met one another like twice and you know I can call him a buddy you can call me I mean this is a person from a different dress no other connections but we have one thing in common you're going to spend eternity together foreign you see this that we have received will make you give Grace to one to another video it will make you understand your brother and yourself that you are going to move that you are going to make it because of your works but because of what he did righteousness as filthy rugs the Bible says but one thing that I I can be able to rely on I'm going to clean on that old rocket foreign the bride will not go through the tribulation and of course that does not necessarily mean that oh you know so now we're going to live like birds and do whatever we want to do them together if indeed the blood has been applied um lead you on the right yes some of you who would like to stay I'm going to preach after I'm done with this I'm going to preach to uh evening light by Tabernacle on zoom and I'm going to speak on something on separation so if you want to stay that's okay praise the name of the Lord I'll just be doing that right quick after this so let me finish with this quote it says not upon denominations upon the bride but here you will get it the bride will not go through that time oh the Bible says not the church will but not the bride can't you see yeah you said the church has to go through the persecution for the person for the Perfection of it no the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride [Music] um a man who chooses a wife don't put her through a lot of punishments he's already found Grace so she has found Grace with him he engages to her now and if there is anything he will keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride that is the creatures but it is how many Sinners was there in the world I got saved God saved me for a purpose how many Sinners were around me how many Sinners were around you God bypassed all of them [Music] [Applause] praise the name of the Lord foreign we want to give you praise come on give him praise Hallelujah [Music] [Music] for from you our thing to you let's see you deserve the glory if you want to worship with me tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] you deserve a glory [Music] oh you are worthy of it oh Jesus [Music] when I think about it [Music] you deserve a glory [Music] of it all has he lift your hand to Jesus tonight [Music] [Music] [Music] oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] thank you Jesus [Music] thank you Lord [Music] oh precious Jesus we love you Lord we give you praise [Music] Lord Jesus Jesus look at my ears we just have to close because we are going to into another Ministry Lord but it is a pleasure to bless everyone that has been here in this service tonight [Music] but sometimes I want to think about what you have done for us Lord Jesus I wish everybody would be able to know to receive the revelation of what I was just talking about tonight [Music] father it will come to a place [Music] do not worry too much about any punishment whatsoever but we will all be looking at the cross [Music] separating ourselves from everything we need to separate from Lord sometimes they don't take your cross and the price you paid so important [Music] forgive us Lord take it so important we want to we want it to mean so much more to us Lord so even as you said when we continue to do sins or go into the things of the world we are putting you back again to open shame and even as apostle Paul spoke and said shall we continue in sin that Grace May abounds there as many as we have baptized into Christ and Resurrection so important bless every one of us Lord bless the giving of the offerings in Jesus name be with everyone now as we go [Music] prepare integrate to another Ministry so if you really want to stay back and listen to this preaching as I'll be preaching to them I will just go straight right into it just sing a song or two and then we'll go straight into into that so you're welcome to do that um foreign [Music] [Music] long ago I know it's really so a babe was born to save man from their sea John saw him on the show the Lamb of forevermore all the cry that crucified of Calvary amen That Man From Galilee foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] with the Republican when to pray in the temple there one day he cried O Lord be merciful to me [Music] he was forgiven of everything
