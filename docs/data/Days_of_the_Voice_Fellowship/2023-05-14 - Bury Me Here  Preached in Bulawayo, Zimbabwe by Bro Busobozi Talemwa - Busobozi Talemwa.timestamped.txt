[11:40] he is going to come up front here and
[11:43] introduce our Minister for today so
[11:46] Pastor foreign
[11:48] [Applause]
[11:53] a lot of stuff that I do have I got it
[11:56] from him because he influenced me a lot
[11:59] since I was even a high school boy so I
[12:03] had a lot of influence from him I had to
[12:05] spend much of my time in her with him so
[12:07] he's one man who also taught me to be
[12:10] patient with things this one man who
[12:12] taught me to be most of what I am so uh
[12:16] this one if I am giving much time to
[12:19] speak then it might take ages for me to
[12:22] finish what he did for me but above all
[12:24] he showed me more love than anyone May
[12:26] and can show so is one person who I have
[12:32] been with in hard times and we have been
[12:35] also together in
[12:37] Sweet Moments so given that we both know
[12:42] how to serve on it and we also both know
[12:45] how to about so at this point I will
[12:48] call Pastor meeting to come and
[12:50] introduce the minister God bless you
[12:53] yeah
[12:56] God bless you
[12:58] [Music]
[13:03] thank you
[13:05] God bless you
[13:06] [Music]
[13:11] thank you very much
[13:14] in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus
[13:17] Christ amen are happy to be in the house
[13:19] of the Lord
[13:21] especially on a Wednesday
[13:23] amen normally I take home
[13:28] I say to those that do not come on the
[13:30] midweek Services they must not come on
[13:33] Sunday
[13:35] because you must not come to church
[13:36] where you want
[13:38] you must come to church because it's
[13:41] God's appointment
[13:43] so in our country there's a newspaper
[13:46] called the days it comes every day but
[13:49] there are Sunday males that come every
[13:51] Sunday
[13:52] so don't become a sentiment
[13:58] thank you
[14:00] amen so don't become the Sunday Mail
[14:04] and don't become like parade once in a
[14:07] month
[14:08] I mean so may God richly bless you we
[14:12] are so happy to be in the house of the
[14:13] Lord amen and I want to thank each uh
[14:17] brother Peter Chaka I stayed with him
[14:20] for over five years in my house it's
[14:22] been a blessing amen and we trust God
[14:26] he's still a tremendous blessing to you
[14:28] it's very good to be back in Bulawayo I
[14:31] want to appreciate Pastor gwenya let's
[14:33] appreciate him tonight
[14:34] [Applause]
[14:36] [Music]
[14:37] [Applause]
[14:39] the reason of me being in plawayo is
[14:43] because normally when he and me when we
[14:47] see something good we bring it home
[14:51] amen
[14:53] wherever we go we see something good we
[14:55] bring it home
[14:57] amen so last year I was I I went for
[15:01] meetings in Kampala
[15:03] Uganda it was a National Convention all
[15:06] churches were together in Kampala so I
[15:09] was slotted about two or three services
[15:13] it's all behind me there was a preacher
[15:16] that was always preaching behind me
[15:19] but I took note he was different
[15:21] amen and I get to know the testimony
[15:24] around him amen that he was raised in a
[15:28] Catholic home the father was a priest
[15:30] and he believed this message and he's
[15:33] still holding on to it and preaching it
[15:38] above all
[15:40] above all
[15:42] there was one significant thing that
[15:44] really touched my heart
[15:46] when I flew to Kampala I flew through
[15:50] Ethiopia I just got an interest in the
[15:53] country I realized that the population
[15:55] it has a population of
[15:58] 125 million people
[16:01] is the most after Nigeria as the most
[16:04] populous nation
[16:06] and it is the fourth largest
[16:08] International
[16:10] airliner by destination and by the
[16:14] number of aircrafts so I took a special
[16:17] interest because I had I listened so
[16:20] many times and preached from the Queen
[16:22] of Sheba she came from Ethiopia
[16:25] Amir
[16:27] so in the preacher student he I got to
[16:30] know that he he preached in Ethiopia he
[16:34] opened a church in Ethiopia Not Alone
[16:37] one but two churches there's never been
[16:40] a message Church in Ethiopia
[16:42] and he is the first seed is the first
[16:45] man that established a church and gave
[16:48] it over it as a pastor and the second
[16:50] one is also another living testimony
[16:53] [Applause]
[16:53] [Music]
[16:56] and is only 32.
[17:02] amen
[17:04] I don't look 50 but I'm 50.
[17:08] amen so that really touched me AME of
[17:13] how he is moving with the Gospel of
[17:15] Jesus Christ and I thought it best you
[17:17] could come down preach for us he's been
[17:20] to so we made another image with Pastor
[17:22] mahere he went to South Africa and then
[17:24] he came for Easter meetings I want to
[17:26] tell you says you are in for a
[17:28] gastronomical jubilee

[24:07] I I so I wouldn't have I would not have
[24:10] a lot of uh uh introductions he has
[24:13] already told you much about us and uh so
[24:16] he has saved me the trouble to go
[24:18] through a lot of introductions this
[24:20] evening but maybe what I would say that
[24:23] I've been in Zimbabwe before and uh I
[24:25] hope you don't mind standing for just a
[24:27] few moments so that you just sit after
[24:29] we have read the word and so I've been
[24:31] in Zimbabwe before
[24:33] that is in 2011 and I was I think 19 20
[24:37] years then and ministered I think for
[24:40] pastor Chessa and a few other other
[24:42] places so uh when he invited us to come
[24:44] again I said Zimbabwe was a great time
[24:47] for me then I went through a lot of
[24:49] trainings I went to Guru in the rural
[24:51] areas there and and so uh and I went
[24:54] through a lot and you know the Lord just
[24:56] training Us in the ministry and so
[24:59] Zimbabwe has special place in our hearts
[25:01] and so I received greetings from our
[25:03] church in Kampala days of the voice
[25:05] Fellowship my wife Rebecca and the
[25:07] family they all sent their greetings to
[25:10] you so I've already been around not only
[25:13] in Guero we've been in several places in
[25:16] in the country and so God has given us
[25:20] Grace to be able to speak to the church
[25:23] in Monterrey and a few in arale and so
[25:26] this evening the Lord has fallen on us
[25:29] to be here tonight I hope you've come
[25:31] expectant
[25:32] and believing that the Lord will be able
[25:34] to meet your need he knows what we need
[25:36] and he knows how to you know just come
[25:38] and speak to us and so without wasting a
[25:41] lot more time we'll just go in the word
[25:43] right now
[25:44] if you can
[25:46] open with me in the book of
[25:48] job
[25:50] chapter 19.
[26:00] we will read just two verses out of that
[26:09] chapter 19 verse 25
[26:19] 226
[26:25] oh
[26:30] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[26:33] that he shall stand at the latter day
[26:35] upon the Earth
[26:36] and though after my skin worms destroy
[26:40] this body yet in my flesh shall I see
[26:44] God
[26:45] Amen Let us just speak to the Lord for
[26:47] just a moment once again father
[26:50] we have read just a portion of your holy
[26:52] word I know that all these people that
[26:55] are here tonight believe this to be the
[26:57] truth and Lord you you met job one time
[27:01] and he was able at the end of it all to
[27:03] say by Revelation I know my redeemer
[27:06] liveth and and one time I'm going to see
[27:09] him in my flesh father may we be able by
[27:12] the end of this service also to be able
[27:14] to say the same thing like job did just
[27:18] come and speak to us Lord we yield
[27:19] ourselves to you I yield myself to you
[27:21] father that you will direct my thoughts
[27:22] and also the people that we will all
[27:24] hear from you tonight
[27:26] father we ask these blessings in the
[27:28] precious name of Jesus Christ amen he
[27:31] may be seated
[27:33] so I have been made to understand that
[27:35] there are more online than there is here
[27:39] uh this evening and so I want to greet
[27:42] also those who are online and I know
[27:44] some from home also could be following
[27:46] the service and so we are connected and
[27:49] you know it's not you know internet
[27:51] tells me of how the bride is going to be
[27:54] connected in that great Resurrection
[27:56] somehow imagine that you know Saints
[27:58] from all over just being able to
[28:00] congregate and meet together and meet
[28:02] the Lord in the air and so before we get
[28:04] into the word I want to say that I love
[28:06] the message with all my heart and like
[28:08] the Pastor said I've been I was
[28:11] um in the Anglican Church who was born
[28:13] there was raised raised there at one
[28:16] point I thought I was going to be a
[28:18] clutch there myself uh being a son of a
[28:21] clergy and you know being raised by a
[28:23] bishop in the Anglican Church I lived
[28:25] with him for two years started
[28:27] ministering actually when I was 13 years
[28:29] one time seated around the dining table
[28:31] he asked me whether uh you know I would
[28:35] preach he said he just you know he's a
[28:37] big fat man so he looked at me and and
[28:39] with those serious eyes and he said tell
[28:43] him what can you preach and so when he
[28:45] said that you know I feared because I
[28:47] did not expect him to ask me that of
[28:49] course I know in the Anglican Church to
[28:51] be able to preach you have to have gone
[28:53] through Theology and you know you you
[28:55] maybe you're a reverend or uh something
[28:57] at least and then you you can wear those
[29:00] big things that they wear the dresses
[29:02] and so uh when he asked me can you
[29:05] preach it it took me an awareness I
[29:06] didn't expect that you would say that
[29:07] and so I didn't know what to answer him
[29:10] and I didn't want I didn't I don't want
[29:12] to say no to him so I end up saying by
[29:14] the grace of God I believe I can and
[29:16] then later I regretted why I had to say
[29:18] that because the whole night I didn't
[29:20] sleep the whole night I was praying and
[29:22] waiting upon God to see how he will lead
[29:24] me what I will speak on and then he gave
[29:26] me Galatians 3 so I I I quote that
[29:29] scripture by inspiration and spoke it
[29:32] um uh at the church where we went to
[29:34] about 300 people I was only 13 years and
[29:36] so you can imagine you know I was very
[29:39] very nervous and so uh but by the grace
[29:42] of God about a hundred people wanted to
[29:44] give their lives to Jesus of course
[29:46] being in the aggregate Church the bishop
[29:48] just came and you know uh prayed a
[29:50] blessing I pray of blessing over them
[29:52] and he said now you are saved you can go
[29:53] back to your seats and so uh but that
[29:56] would then continue on like every
[29:58] service for uh for two years
[30:00] um whenever we the bishop traveled he
[30:02] would take take me along uh take me
[30:05] along and and then so time came when he
[30:08] actually now gave me a title he said
[30:10] you're a decision young evangelist and
[30:13] so whenever the president would come
[30:14] over or uh or the or one of the kings in
[30:17] the country you know we have very many
[30:18] kings in Uganda all all uh the uh you
[30:22] know one of the politicians or the
[30:23] Archbishop then you would introduce me
[30:25] as the devastation young evangelist and
[30:27] so I was used to traveling with him in
[30:29] his motorcade and you know being in that
[30:32] kind of high high I think I would want
[30:34] to call it hyper life and you know being
[30:36] in in good uh traveling in good cars and
[30:40] meeting good people meeting you know
[30:42] powerful things and so I had thought
[30:43] that that was the life I wanted to live
[30:45] because then of course you get to serve
[30:48] God and be closer to God and I thought
[30:50] being a bishop was really being closer
[30:53] to God but I did not know better until
[30:56] when I became 15 the message came my way
[31:01] Hallelujah and Friends when the message
[31:03] came my way I did not easily did not go
[31:05] you know well with me like like easily
[31:08] with me because I was I thought I was
[31:10] founded in what I believed to be the
[31:13] truth at the time and so uh long uh the
[31:16] story is long but uh I'll just tell you
[31:18] this mom this just short uh snippet of
[31:22] it my mother if things happen and I had
[31:25] to temporarily leave The Bishop's house
[31:27] but in that town because I was already
[31:29] enrolled in school there there was no
[31:33] um any members of our family and so I
[31:35] needed to stay in school and I needed to
[31:37] live somewhere so the only person who
[31:39] could think of was a family friend that
[31:41] lived in that in that place
[31:43] and uh uh guess what this family friend
[31:47] was actually a pastor in the message and
[31:50] so uh God had already envisioned all
[31:52] this before the foundation of the world
[31:54] and and so uh none of our church people
[31:57] wanted to live with me because they had
[31:58] girls in their homes and the rule is if
[32:01] you have if you're keeping girls you
[32:02] don't keep boys and so they said sorry
[32:05] we can't keep your son sorry we can't
[32:06] keep your sons but when we arrived at
[32:08] this man's house he had us you know just
[32:10] at the living room and the bedroom two
[32:13] rooms and and he was married and he was
[32:15] also keeping girls and so but when we
[32:18] arrived there he was a little bit
[32:19] hesitant but then when my mother said
[32:21] he's called pastor at at school you know
[32:24] for two years I'd been preaching and and
[32:26] so I always liked sharing the the word
[32:28] just the best scriptures with my friends
[32:31] and so when he had that he's called
[32:33] pastor at school oh he picked interest
[32:35] he said I think I'll keep him and so
[32:37] that's how I started staying with a
[32:39] message believer and so for about six
[32:42] months they began to share with me the
[32:44] message and uh you know uh to tell me
[32:47] about the godhead one God About the Name
[32:50] of Jesus of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[32:52] water baptism and tell me that of all
[32:55] the things that you now believe that we
[32:57] now all believe and I was not so fast in
[33:01] believing it because my mother before
[33:02] she left this place she had showed me a
[33:06] picture that was in this man's house of
[33:09] brother Barnum with that pill of fire
[33:11] and told me that this these people are a
[33:13] couch and this is the man they believe
[33:15] in and so it had kind of made me nervous
[33:18] and and brought a lot of fear on me and
[33:20] I kind of feared really uh go ahead and
[33:23] and dig deeper well I was saying that
[33:25] whatever they were saying was in the
[33:27] word but I I was fearing thinking that
[33:30] these people have more than what they
[33:32] are actually saying and whatever they
[33:34] have that is more that they are
[33:35] concealing somewhere is a bit cultish
[33:37] that's what I kind of felt and so after
[33:40] they had shared everything with me one
[33:42] time I asked them I said but who is that
[33:44] man because I waited for them to Bow and
[33:46] prostrate before this man and they did
[33:48] not and so one time I asked I said who
[33:51] is this man and so the pastor was very
[33:54] excited when I asked that question he
[33:55] said all right that's a good question
[33:57] and so he he sat down and he said now
[34:00] you can sit down let us talk about it so
[34:02] for about an hour or so took me through
[34:04] Malachi 4 Revelation 10 7 and all the
[34:06] other scriptures in Matthew and so I I
[34:09] really clearly saw that there was one
[34:11] thing that I cleared so at that moment
[34:13] was that indeed there was an Elijah That
[34:16] was supposed to come I clearly saw that
[34:18] in the scriptures
[34:20] but now the question that was not
[34:22] answered that moment was that he was
[34:24] this man so the question was how true am
[34:28] I he is this man and friends they tried
[34:30] to convince me of course tell me about
[34:32] all the vindications but uh well it was
[34:34] a bit convincing but it took it had to
[34:37] take God to move my heart and so uh in
[34:40] the morning very early in the morning
[34:41] every Sunday I would go to my church and
[34:43] then in the afternoon I would come to to
[34:45] their Fellowship and so this early
[34:48] morning one day after like this was
[34:50] after a six months of knowing everything
[34:52] and fellowshipping with them and living
[34:55] with them I went to our church our
[34:57] Anglican church and that day was the day
[35:00] that the Lord had prepared for him to
[35:02] move on my heart because that morning
[35:05] you know there are thick many things
[35:07] that happened on this on the same day at
[35:09] the same time in the church it was a
[35:12] woman preacher on the pulpit my heart
[35:13] was already told me telling me that is
[35:15] wrong of course they had already told me
[35:17] and so then after that they told us to
[35:21] look uh to the I think to the east I
[35:23] don't remember and they say that you
[35:25] would now have to recite the Apostles
[35:27] Creed how many another Apostles Creed
[35:29] where of course God has delivered us
[35:31] from the Creeds of man and so and so we
[35:34] have to recite the Apostles Creed so
[35:36] these men always told me that I was
[35:39] Catholic and I said no I'm not Catholic
[35:41] I'm Anglican I'm Protestant because
[35:43] Anglican Church of England it means we
[35:45] protested against the Catholic church
[35:47] and so they said but no you are still
[35:48] Catholic you just don't know it and so
[35:50] that that that that morning as we were
[35:53] reciting the Apostles Creed there was
[35:55] this phrase and I believe in the Holy
[35:57] Catholic Church I nearly fainted because
[36:00] these words I had never had them all my
[36:03] life in the Anglican Church I was now at
[36:05] that time close to 15 years and so uh it
[36:09] was so surprising to me and you know
[36:11] things began to happen at that moment I
[36:13] almost passed out and so I began to hear
[36:15] this wall of wind
[36:17] woo and as and as it was passing by I
[36:20] thought everybody was hearing it so I
[36:22] looked around it looked like everybody
[36:23] was focusing on what was going on and in
[36:26] that moment they taught us to look to
[36:28] the rear of the rare side of the church
[36:30] and they were going to conduct a baptism
[36:33] you know how they conducted baptism they
[36:35] called The Godfather and The Godfather
[36:37] repents or speaks or confesses on behalf
[36:39] of the child and then they begin to
[36:40] baptize the child with that holy water
[36:42] from the bowel in the name of the father
[36:45] and of the son and of the holy spirit so
[36:48] as The Godfather was answering for the
[36:50] baby and as they were now picking the
[36:52] water I I I from that world of wind that
[36:56] was going around my my head I had a
[36:58] voice friends that voice was very clear
[37:00] and it spoke to me and said call me by
[37:03] my name say Italian you were in the
[37:05] wrong place find the nearest exit and
[37:07] leave this place and as I had that I you
[37:10] know I began shaking and I I I I I had
[37:13] it second time and and then the third
[37:16] time I couldn't resist it I wanted to
[37:18] resist it but friends I couldn't resist
[37:21] it and so I picked my Bible and and I
[37:24] just swung you know just swung myself
[37:27] out of out of that church in the nearest
[37:29] exit and so of course I had nowhere to
[37:32] go these people were now in their church
[37:34] and so their Church of course is a
[37:35] message believer's church so I found
[37:37] myself there I had to go there of course
[37:39] I did not I had not made up my mind to
[37:42] join them but I had made up my mind to
[37:44] leave that church because of that
[37:45] experience which was very confusing to
[37:48] me of course at the time and so when I
[37:50] arrived there and then you know this man
[37:53] was preaching and hammering the gospel
[37:55] that's why friends were never a preacher
[37:58] is really preaching and hammering the
[37:59] gospel let us say Amen Let Us receive it
[38:01] because you never know someone is
[38:03] receiving their Deliverance while they
[38:05] are seated right there and by your
[38:07] saying amen you know God is moving on
[38:09] someone's life and so I just came and
[38:11] sat somewhere there and you know I was
[38:13] just like not there but there and but
[38:15] then when I found this man hammering the
[38:18] gospel you know jumping up and down as
[38:20] he as if to say chords of fire were
[38:22] under his feet
[38:23] I was I say to myself really this man
[38:27] seem as if they have something and so
[38:29] you was hammering everything I had left
[38:31] in our church he was talking his subject
[38:34] was that woman Jezebel and so he was
[38:37] speaking on the Catholic Church system
[38:38] and every wrong doctrine that they had
[38:40] propagated and you know that it's gone
[38:42] all over the world that a woman seated
[38:44] over the the many Waters and so as he
[38:48] went through all that you see God began
[38:51] to uh convict me in my soul about these
[38:53] all things that it was the truth of
[38:55] course they called the people who had
[38:56] accepted to believe they had known me
[38:58] for six months so they had given up on
[39:00] me because they know uh maybe you know
[39:03] there's some people who are like a hard
[39:04] not to crack You Preach to them you
[39:06] preach to them they keep coming to
[39:08] church but they're not making up their
[39:09] mind and so I was one of those and and
[39:12] so they had just given up on me but that
[39:14] day it was different as they called
[39:16] people who were ready to give their
[39:18] lives to Jesus I I wanted to go but you
[39:21] know something was just pulling me you
[39:23] know reminding me of all the prestigious
[39:25] leaving behind in our Anglican Church I
[39:27] was no longer going to go to Maryland
[39:29] address the bishop had promised me to go
[39:31] to Maryland to study theology so I was
[39:33] going to miss that part you know the
[39:34] devil was showing me a lot of things
[39:36] that you know these people have nothing
[39:37] where you are coming from you know you
[39:39] were living uh you know life at its
[39:41] maximum what are you going to get here
[39:43] you know these people were about like
[39:45] maybe 10 or 15 of them and and and so on
[39:48] most of them were living lives that
[39:51] seemed as as if to say miserable and you
[39:54] know I kind of felt uh these things it
[39:57] doesn't have my future here I don't have
[39:58] my future here but you see that's what
[40:01] it took for God to visit me it doesn't
[40:04] matter the place where God visits you
[40:06] when it is your day it is your day
[40:09] and so that was my day and and as I I
[40:12] was you know convincing myself not to go
[40:14] at that very moment you know that same
[40:17] condition came back again and I began to
[40:19] hear it
[40:21] when I was like oh not again by the way
[40:24] this that was the other one was the
[40:26] first and this was the only second time
[40:27] that thing ever came to me it never came
[40:29] back again but you see when it came that
[40:32] moment that from that war of uh in my
[40:36] ears The Voice came back again and and
[40:40] called me by name say talimar stand up
[40:43] throw both your hands up and declare on
[40:45] top of your voice that this is the truth
[40:48] that this message is the truth and tell
[40:50] them you would like to be baptized in
[40:51] the name of Jesus Christ
[40:53] that voice was very clear as clear as I
[40:55] am to you tonight
[40:57] and so I aesthetically you know stood up
[41:01] I think everybody was wondering what is
[41:03] happening because I just stood up
[41:06] and as if I was on remote control I just
[41:09] stood up and then just said both my
[41:12] hands but I only raised one out of fear
[41:14] and then and then I began to speak with
[41:17] a shaking voice and try to shout but I
[41:19] couldn't but I just tried my best and
[41:21] then I told them what the voice had said
[41:23] that I would I should tell them and you
[41:25] know what happened everybody began
[41:27] clapping their hands and shouting and
[41:29] rejoicing I was like is it a big deal to
[41:31] them
[41:32] but you see there's a big deal to the
[41:34] children of God when one saw
[41:36] hallelujah what one Soul has found
[41:39] Christ that was my day that I found
[41:41] Christ and I was baptized that same
[41:43] evening
[41:44] uh in in in in in Lake wamala in Uganda
[41:48] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[41:51] that was the beginning of my uh of my
[41:54] journey in this precious message when I
[41:57] came out of the water I made it a point
[41:59] I said to myself that I'm going to spend
[42:02] my life
[42:04] um I I I I never said it out loud but I
[42:07] spoke it in my heart I said Lord I'm
[42:09] going to spend my life I'm going to give
[42:11] it to you for the purpose of propagating
[42:13] this message I'll tell them wherever I
[42:15] go that God has sent this message and
[42:17] this message is true
[42:19] and that's what we have done ever since
[42:21] and God has been faithful
[42:23] God has been faithful I tell you what
[42:25] God has been faithful and if if you are
[42:28] here tonight and you have any doubt
[42:30] about this message I want to tell you
[42:32] that this message is true
[42:34] this message is true so if there is
[42:36] anything else I would say I think that
[42:38] is all I will say in whatever I will say
[42:40] tonight that the message is true amen
[42:43] God has already Vindicated it nobody
[42:45] needs to vindicate this message the
[42:47] message is Vindicated the message is
[42:49] true God Amen
[42:52] prophet and this message has changed
[42:55] lives I want to say the greatest
[42:57] Vindication of this message is not even
[42:59] the pit of fire it's not even the the
[43:02] cloud the greatest Vindication of this
[43:04] message is you
[43:05] hey man it is me it is a people that God
[43:08] has called out of the systems and the
[43:10] denominations of the world and he has
[43:12] set them amen under the quietness of the
[43:14] spirit under the word and you know we
[43:16] are bringing out little by little the
[43:18] nature and character of Jesus Christ and
[43:20] one of these days when the trumpet shall
[43:22] sound we are going Amen to go in the
[43:24] Rapture because we are being changed
[43:26] right now by this message of the hour
[43:28] and so on our honeymoon we went to
[43:30] Ethiopia and you heard what the Lord did
[43:32] there and so then we moved back to
[43:35] Uganda where we are currently passing in
[43:37] Kampala so I think that is all that you
[43:39] would want to know about us now can we
[43:41] go in the world
[43:42] praise the name of the Lord
[43:46] and so uh that's why tonight I want to
[43:49] share with you on a little subject
[43:52] I believe this message I'm here in this
[43:54] message and I want you to bury me here
[43:56] so I want to speak to you on a subject
[43:58] me here
[44:03] and so the prophet would go ahead to say
[44:05] that job is the oldest book in the Bible
[44:08] even before Genesis job and so the
[44:11] Patriots knew that job had an idea on
[44:14] where the Redeemer would stand you see
[44:16] us I'll read for you a little bit later
[44:18] and so job but the bottom said job said
[44:21] bury me here when he had the revelation
[44:24] of where the Redeemer would stand and
[44:26] all of them all of the Patriarchs all of
[44:29] them were buried at the same place
[44:31] in the promised land and so we will
[44:34] Begin by taking this from Genesis if you
[44:38] can turn to Genesis 23 with me I don't
[44:41] think that I will be wrong I'll try to
[44:43] keep the time so I want you to just give
[44:45] me your kind and divided attention
[44:47] Genesis chapter 23 verse 3 says that
[44:49] Abraham stood up from before he's dead
[44:52] and spake unto the sons of Health saying
[44:55] I am a stranger and a sojana with you
[44:57] give me a position of a budding place
[44:59] with you that I may bury my dead out of
[45:02] my sight and the children of Health
[45:04] answered Abraham saying unto him he
[45:06] asked my Lord thou art a mighty Prince
[45:09] Among Us in the choice of our separagus
[45:12] bury thy dead none of us shall with
[45:14] withhold from thee is but that thou
[45:18] mayest body thy dead now they wanted to
[45:20] give it to him for free and Abraham
[45:22] stood up and bowed himself to the people
[45:24] of the land even to the children of
[45:25] health and he communed with them saying
[45:27] if it be your mind that I should bury my
[45:30] dead out of my sight hear me
[45:34] and entry for me to Ephron the son of
[45:36] Zohar that he may give me the cave of
[45:40] macpella which he has which is in the
[45:43] end of his field for as much money as it
[45:46] is worth He Shall give it to me for a
[45:48] position for a budding place amongst you
[45:51] now Abraham did not want to get this
[45:54] boring place for free he wanted to pay
[45:56] his money for it and Ephron dwelt among
[45:59] the children of health and the Ephron
[46:01] the heated answered Abraham in the
[46:03] audience of the children of Health even
[46:05] of all of them that went in the gate of
[46:06] his City and saying name my Lord hear me
[46:09] the field
[46:10] give ID and the cave that is therea in I
[46:14] gave it thee in the presence of the sons
[46:16] of my people give it to them body thy
[46:19] dead you are trying to negotiate with
[46:21] Abraham but Abraham refused with
[46:23] negotiate and so Abraham bowed down
[46:25] himself before the people of the land
[46:27] and he speak unto him from the audience
[46:29] of the people of the land saying but if
[46:31] thou will give it I pray thee hear me I
[46:34] will give thee money for the field take
[46:36] it of me and I and I will bear him thy
[46:39] dead rather my dead there and ifron
[46:42] answered Abraham saying unto him
[46:46] my Lord heck and unto me
[46:48] the land is worth 400 shekels of silver
[46:52] what is that betwixt me and it's just
[46:55] very little money better for like that
[46:56] they did and Abraham heck and unto
[46:59] Ephron and Abraham wait to hear from the
[47:01] silver which he had named in the
[47:04] audience of the sons of Health 400
[47:07] shekels of the silver current money with
[47:10] the merchant imagine if someone tells
[47:12] you that I'm selling this land to you
[47:13] for 400 uh uh uh dollars and you don't
[47:19] even negotiate
[47:20] you see Abraham had a reason why he
[47:22] didn't do that this was a type and we
[47:24] will see it you see he did not negotiate
[47:26] whatever they asked he they wanted to
[47:28] give it to him for free he said no I'll
[47:30] not take it for free he said no this is
[47:32] nothing it's just worth 400. it's just
[47:34] nothing we can give it to you for free
[47:36] he said well I will buy it and he
[47:38] counted everything they said it was
[47:40] worth and he gave it to them without
[47:41] negotiating and and and and he paid off
[47:45] the land for a barring place for himself
[47:47] and for his uh for his date all right
[47:50] let us finish up on verse 20. all right
[47:53] listen on it says unto Abraham
[47:56] okay verse 17 and the field of Ephron
[47:59] which was in macapella which was before
[48:00] memory the field and the cave which was
[48:02] there in and all the trees that were in
[48:05] the field that were in the all the
[48:07] borders round about were made sure and
[48:09] to Abraham for a position in the
[48:11] presence of the children of Health
[48:12] before all that went in at the Gate of
[48:15] his City and after this Abraham buried
[48:17] Sarah his wife in the cave of the field
[48:20] of macapella before mammary the same is
[48:22] Hebron in the canon in the land of
[48:24] Canaan and the field and the cave that
[48:26] is there in were made sure
[48:29] and to Abraham for opposition of a
[48:33] burning place by the sons of Health
[48:36] did you know that brother Barnum
[48:39] actually emphasizes in several messages
[48:41] and I was just reading one of them in
[48:43] the glorified Jesus 1955.
[48:46] excuse me he actually said that a job
[48:51] that Abraham Buried buried his dead or
[48:54] both this land from where actually job
[48:57] was buried
[48:59] you see
[49:01] um maybe and you will excuse me for
[49:03] reading a lot but I know you love the
[49:04] message on the world do you praise the
[49:07] name of the Lord and so let me just uh I
[49:09] would I will not read the whole quote I
[49:11] just read a little bit of it it says
[49:13] from paragraph for the success knowledge
[49:15] he made preparation for that too now
[49:18] let's between the let's read between the
[49:20] lines just a little
[49:22] he says job watch how he specified where
[49:26] his budding place was Along Came many
[49:29] other of the prophets we will take care
[49:31] we will take for instance Abraham Sarah
[49:33] the sweethearts of the Bible and when
[49:35] Abraham come along loving Sarah when she
[49:38] died just didn't bury her anywhere he
[49:42] had a spiritual revelation of something
[49:44] the same thing job had so he goes over
[49:48] near the grave where a job was buried
[49:51] and purchased a piece of ground right in
[49:54] Palestine and buried Sarah there
[49:57] now if you want to read directly you
[50:00] want to say where is that in the Bible
[50:01] you might not see that's why we believe
[50:02] that brother is the messenger of Our
[50:05] Generation because there are very many
[50:07] things that the prophet will say that
[50:09] are a nominal Christian will never find
[50:11] anywhere you see that the prophet says
[50:14] that the Enoch built the Pyramid it is
[50:16] nowhere in the Bible you will not find
[50:17] it you will not find who built the
[50:19] Pyramid you will not find why it was
[50:21] built this the way it was built and many
[50:22] things that let me tell you there are
[50:24] many things
[50:25] that you cannot find out there but you
[50:29] will for sure find in the message of the
[50:32] hour
[50:32] Hallelujah and so then he says that
[50:36] Abraham refuses to take
[50:39] uh that that uh that job was buried then
[50:42] so Abraham takes a place and buys the
[50:44] the piece of land from the exact place
[50:46] or around the same area in Palestine
[50:48] where job also was buried and so Abraham
[50:52] refuses to take a borrowing place for
[50:54] free he also does not negotiate as I
[50:56] told you he paid exactly what he was
[50:58] asked to pay he pays all listen this
[51:01] will be significant in a few moments
[51:02] before I close he pays all the land's
[51:06] worth
[51:07] whatever was required of him to pay he
[51:10] said I will pay I am not going to take
[51:12] it for free I am going to pay because
[51:14] this is so important to me I want it to
[51:16] be a bearing place for my people so I'm
[51:19] going to take it for all its worth and
[51:22] so of course you know from Genesis 35 27
[51:26] and it says and Jacob uh came unto uh
[51:29] Isaac his father and to mammary and to
[51:31] the city of ABBA which is in Hebron
[51:33] where Abraham and Isaac so John and the
[51:36] days of Isaac were 144 school years and
[51:39] Isaac gave up The Ghost and died and was
[51:42] gathered unto his people being old and
[51:45] full of days so you see Isaac was also
[51:48] battered in the same place in Palestine
[51:51] right and then when you go back to to
[51:54] Jacob you see he was looking at the
[51:56] scripture here in Genesis 4 7 28 I know
[51:58] most of you could know this but for just
[52:01] the sake of giving a foundation of what
[52:03] I want to talk about let's just rehearse
[52:05] them a little bit in Genesis for the 729
[52:07] he says and Jacob lived in the land of
[52:09] Egypt 17 years
[52:11] so the whole age of Jacob was 140 and
[52:14] seven years and the time Drew now that
[52:17] Israel must die this is Jacob and he
[52:20] carried his son Joseph sorry he called
[52:22] his son Joseph and said unto him if now
[52:25] I have found Grace in thy sight put I
[52:28] pray thee thy hand under my thigh and
[52:31] deal kindly and truly with me remember
[52:34] now they were now in the land of Egypt
[52:37] they had left the land of promise so he
[52:39] said
[52:48] pay with my fathers and you will carry
[52:51] me out of Egypt and you will bury me in
[52:54] their boring place so you see this was a
[52:57] significant place
[52:59] Hallelujah all the Patriots were
[53:01] abandoned in that same place and we
[53:03] notice here when the time came now also
[53:05] for Joseph Joseph did not get a chance
[53:08] to live you know alive and so we're
[53:11] noticed here in Genesis 50 24 he says
[53:14] and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die
[53:18] and God will surely visit you I love the
[53:21] way you say these words Hallelujah he
[53:24] wasn't that God might visit you oh God
[53:27] maybe we'll visit you but God will
[53:30] surely visit you
[53:32] Hallelujah these people had a promise
[53:36] these people they knew they had to be in
[53:38] their land of promise and they knew that
[53:40] there was coming that time when God
[53:43] would visit them and so he said look I
[53:45] die but God will surely visit you and he
[53:48] will bring you out of this land unto the
[53:50] land which he swear to Abraham to Isaac
[53:53] and to Jacob and Joseph two can also the
[53:56] children of Israel saying God will
[53:58] surely visit you and he shall carry me
[54:01] shall shall carry up my bones from hands
[54:06] Hallelujah this man is speaking like job
[54:11] he knew maybe by the time God visits you
[54:14] my body might just be born
[54:17] Hallelujah but I know God will visit you
[54:21] it doesn't matter how long it takes but
[54:24] when God speaks his word his word must
[54:27] come to pass
[54:29] Hallelujah they had a promise and they
[54:32] promised had to come to pass oh my we
[54:34] have a promise and that promise must
[54:36] come to pass God must surely visit us
[54:40] and and so you see he said you'll carry
[54:43] up my bones hands so Joseph died so
[54:46] Joseph died but he had told them you
[54:48] must carry my bones out of here it
[54:51] doesn't matter how long I'm I'm long
[54:53] dead but you must carry me and so they
[54:55] involved him and they put him in in the
[54:57] coffin in Egypt and they waited for the
[55:00] time God will visit them
[55:03] excuse me and so Joseph died in the
[55:05] faith
[55:06] he knew that God would visit the
[55:08] children of Israel and he knew that God
[55:10] would carry them out of Egypt into the
[55:12] promised land praise the name of the
[55:14] Lord hallelujah I tell you what I'm
[55:16] looking for that time when God will
[55:18] visit this generation
[55:20] Hallelujah God has sent us a message
[55:23] and this message must fulfill its
[55:27] purpose that it has meant oh it was
[55:29] meant into our lives
[55:31] this message did not come to educate us
[55:33] to give us better knowledge about life
[55:36] and to give us better knowledge about
[55:37] things
[55:38] the purpose of the oh Hallelujah glory
[55:40] to God the purpose of this message
[55:43] is to bring forth about the change
[55:46] this is the only purpose of the message
[55:50] but there are many other things that are
[55:52] going to happen while we are living here
[55:54] the blessings of the message they will
[55:57] be there but the purpose of this message
[55:59] is the rapture
[56:02] that's why we have songs like I'm
[56:03] thinking of the Rapture I'm thinking of
[56:06] the Rapture the believer wherever you
[56:07] are you must be prepared for the coming
[56:09] of the Lord this message has come to
[56:12] call us out of the systems of man and
[56:15] prepare us amen for for the Rapture how
[56:18] does it prepare us It prepares us by uh
[56:21] by daily you know changing US changing
[56:24] us the word of God changes you changes
[56:26] me and brings us into the nature into
[56:29] the character into the image of Jesus
[56:31] Christ
[56:32] and so see Moses Moses as brother would
[56:38] say then in the message Israel and the
[56:40] church
[56:44] but the bottom would go on to say he
[56:46] says mother started out now of course as
[56:48] they were going out of the uh out of um
[56:52] out of Egypt he says mother started out
[56:55] the Holy Spirit spoke to him and said oh
[56:58] Moses you are forgetting something Moses
[57:01] you're forgetting something Moses go
[57:03] down and get the bones of Joseph
[57:07] Hallelujah he said you know what will
[57:09] the Holy Ghost do the Holy Ghost will
[57:11] show you things to come and he will
[57:13] remind you everything I taught you
[57:15] and by the bottom would say here that
[57:17] the Holocaust reminded amen Moses Moses
[57:20] amen as you are going out of Egypt don't
[57:22] forget the bones of Joseph don't forget
[57:25] and so mothers roughed them up and here
[57:28] he come and a period of fire leading him
[57:31] onto the promised land and he buried
[57:33] them by the side of Isaac and Jacob
[57:38] and he said why because they know there
[57:41] was coming the fast fruits of them that
[57:44] slept they knowed there was coming a
[57:47] resurrection one of them days hallelujah
[57:52] name of the Lord
[57:55] excuse me here for just a moment
[58:09] and so they know that there was coming a
[58:11] resurrection one of them days he says
[58:14] and then we continue on here job
[58:17] then says they knowed that just one
[58:22] that job said I know my redeemer liveth
[58:25] and at the last day he will stand upon
[58:28] the Earth and they know that the job had
[58:31] an idea where he was going to stand did
[58:35] you hear that that this Patriarchs this
[58:38] you know Isaac Jacob and you know Sarah
[58:41] Abraham he's saying they knew that job
[58:45] had an idea where the Redeemer was going
[58:47] to stand when it comes to fulfill that
[58:50] promise you see the job had an idea
[58:53] where he he was going to stand and so
[58:56] job said by the man I'm saying so job
[58:58] said bury me here
[59:02] yeah I wonder if you knew
[59:06] I come in here believe in the
[59:07] resurrection
[59:08] how many here believe in the coming of
[59:11] the Lord amen and we believe that Jesus
[59:14] Christ is coming back again amen the
[59:16] Lord is coming back to us again the Lord
[59:18] is coming back to us again Saturn will
[59:20] be bound a thousand years we will have
[59:22] no tempted then and the Lord shall come
[59:24] Amen to Earth again amen but let me tell
[59:28] you if you knew where the Lord amen is
[59:30] going to come and stand when he comes
[59:32] amen won't you tell everybody to bother
[59:35] you there
[59:37] here
[59:40] they wanted to be with Joseph they
[59:43] wanted to be with job they buried right
[59:45] around there in Palestine because that
[59:49] was the promised land and they know the
[59:52] resurrection wasn't going to be in Egypt
[59:54] it wasn't going to be in Europe it
[59:56] wasn't going to be somewhere else it was
[59:58] going to be in Palestine so they buried
[1:00:01] them there
[1:00:03] Hallelujah
[1:00:05] and the bride knows the resurrection is
[1:00:08] not going to happen anywhere out there
[1:00:10] there is a place where the resolution is
[1:00:12] going to happen and that's where the
[1:00:14] bride must be buried
[1:00:18] Hallelujah
[1:00:20] oh my let's just continue here and then
[1:00:22] and so he says Along Came Jesus Along
[1:00:26] Came Jesus the promised one
[1:00:28] they done to him what they say they
[1:00:30] would and oh they killed him oh he died
[1:00:35] his soul descended into hell
[1:00:38] preached to the souls that are in prison
[1:00:41] taking the kids of death and hell away
[1:00:43] from the devil he returned back on
[1:00:46] Easter morning and as he come through
[1:00:48] Paradise
[1:00:50] he knocked at the door Hallelujah I can
[1:00:53] hear him say children
[1:00:56] all them that were buried Hallelujah in
[1:00:59] Palestine all of them that were buried
[1:01:01] in faith all of them that were abandoned
[1:01:04] in that place
[1:01:06] Hallelujah and by the badam says I can
[1:01:09] hear him say children and Abraham say
[1:01:12] who is that
[1:01:15] imagine if you were Abraham if you were
[1:01:17] Sarah or if you were a job or if you're
[1:01:18] one of those and you hear him say
[1:01:20] children and you had waited you had been
[1:01:24] buried in that place
[1:01:25] [Applause]
[1:01:27] and
[1:01:30] then says
[1:01:32] he says I'm your seed the Seed of
[1:01:35] Abraham Daniel said who is that and he
[1:01:38] says I'm the stone that was cut out of
[1:01:40] the mountain Hallelujah
[1:01:44] Amen Let me just go ahead of myself a
[1:01:46] little bit to tell you this that the
[1:01:48] Bride of Jesus Christ over the seven
[1:01:50] Church ages from the very first church

[1:01:55] place
[1:01:57] and one of these days when he comes by

[1:02:02] had a revelation in every generation
[1:02:04] they had a revelation they had this much
[1:02:06] revelation of him but that is what they
[1:02:08] needed to be buried in that place and
[1:02:11] now we are the Omega bride we are

[1:02:16] word and we are also being buried here

[1:02:58] about the others
[1:03:00] but you see that was that much
[1:03:02] Revelation they had of Jesus Christ

[1:04:05] of the bodies of the saints that slept

[1:04:11] out of the city and appeared to many of
[1:04:14] them in that City

[1:09:30] because the message if it is Christ he
[1:09:33] has a life he has his way about him he
[1:09:36] has his own character he has his own
[1:09:38] nature when you believe it you must
[1:09:40] receive that Christ in your life and
[1:09:43] then he gives you his nature he gives
[1:09:45] you his way he gives you his character
[1:09:49] and then you begin to sing the things I
[1:09:52] used to do I do them no more
[1:09:53] [Applause]
[1:09:55] Hallelujah so if the message now is
[1:09:57] Christ
[1:09:59] Hallelujah I want to say bury me
[1:10:03] in Christ
[1:10:05] in the message
[1:10:08] Hallelujah
[1:10:10] friends I came in the message to die
[1:10:13] here to be buried here because this is
[1:10:15] the only place in our generation that
[1:10:18] Christ is going to come and meet the
[1:10:20] bride
[1:10:21] there is no other place
[1:10:24] all other places are dead lodges
[1:10:28] that sounds a bit rude but it's the
[1:10:30] truth
[1:10:31] there is no life he says when they
[1:10:34] denominate they die
[1:10:37] when they organize they die the message
[1:10:41] can never be organized
[1:10:45] the bride can never be denominated
[1:10:48] that's why I'm telling you this is the
[1:10:50] place where we must be buried
[1:10:53] Hallelujah
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] and then he said
[1:10:58] I'm continuing with the quote I was
[1:10:59] reading initially it says there are for
[1:11:00] today brother you can have whatever you
[1:11:03] want to oh the old cold formal religion
[1:11:07] you want to
[1:11:13] oh tell your neighbor bury me in Christ
[1:11:16] but I mean Christ for those that are in
[1:11:19] Christ will God bring with him in the
[1:11:22] resurrection
[1:11:24] say whatever you want to amen and call
[1:11:27] it a fanaticism whatever you want to do
[1:11:29] but just let me stay in him for those
[1:11:33] that are in him he's coming out of the
[1:11:36] Grave on the resurrection
[1:11:40] for God shall bring them up he promised
[1:11:44] to do it
[1:11:45] amenam says amen and I also added amen
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:51] let them say that they left the message
[1:11:53] how can you leave the message sincerely

[1:11:58] saying that he left the grave how can
[1:11:59] you leave the grave you a dead man how
[1:12:01] can you leave the grave ah you said how
[1:12:05] can you leave it you were dead you are

[1:12:08] nothing you can do until he comes to
[1:12:11] take you home let me tell you if you
[1:12:13] come in the message and you're buried
[1:12:15] here there is no way you can say I'm now
[1:12:17] leaving the message you are dead
[1:12:20] hey man he says I am dead and the life
[1:12:23] that I now live is not mine amen my life
[1:12:25] is healed Hallelujah in Christ in the
[1:12:29] midst of the hour I am dead to the
[1:12:32] things of the world there is no way you
[1:12:34] can be dead and again you are leaving
[1:12:35] how can you live when you are dead you
[1:12:37] are a dead man you are buried there

[1:12:46] oh my doesn't that make you feel good
[1:12:52] oh my
[1:12:55] praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:57] the purpose of the devil
[1:13:00] the purpose of the devil is to try and
[1:13:03] bring us confusions to try and bring New
[1:13:05] Revelations to try and bring this and
[1:13:08] try to bring that but let me tell you if
[1:13:10] God called you if you had an experience

[1:13:16] no way you can be discouraged to leave
[1:13:19] okay
[1:13:20] even when things you know some people
[1:13:23] say you see in the message there is no
[1:13:24] this there is no that everything we need
[1:13:26] is in the message of the hour

[1:13:31] need anything out in the world he
[1:13:34] everything he needs is in that grave
[1:13:38] you know what they were about it they
[1:13:41] are the only thing they needed was the
[1:13:42] resurrection that's the only thing they
[1:13:44] needed and the only thing we need now

[1:37:42] foreign
[1:38:14] real time
[1:38:35] amen we thank the Lord for a wonderful
[1:38:37] service I want to thank our pastor for
[1:38:41] passing this way he has been very busy
[1:38:43] but he spent time to be with us in order
[1:38:46] to thank Pastor said
[1:38:49] and our Reverend
[1:38:52] um but our witness for coming with them
[1:38:56] here and I want to thank the Lord also
[1:38:59] for safe travels that come back home I'm
[1:39:02] also one of the visiting ministers here
[1:39:05] right
[1:39:06] when he just finished preaching brother
[1:39:10] Hillary was he just pulled me I said is
[1:39:12] it can we have him once and I said ah
[1:39:16] he's he's with the elders they in arises
[1:39:19] can we cheat them
[1:39:24] because there are some of the things we
[1:39:25] end up planning you know when you are
[1:39:28] blessed
[1:39:29] when I just said to me for a short time
[1:39:32] at the surgery I could predict this you
[1:39:35] know when something is in somebody it
[1:39:38] doesn't take seconds you know you can
[1:39:40] tell that there's something
[1:39:43] and also judging from the testimony of
[1:39:46] opening those two churches in Ethiopia
[1:39:50] when you are going for your honeymoon
[1:39:53] it's a big something
[1:39:55] when something is in a man it cannot be
[1:39:58] heated
[1:39:59] it's going to show forth and I believe
[1:40:01] that
[1:40:02] starting from the testimony through the
[1:40:05] quotation through the service someone
[1:40:07] was encouraged and someone was also
[1:40:11] provoked to do something for God
[1:40:15] our Cave of my pillar is in hiding in
[1:40:18] Christ
[1:40:19] and one of these days we shall have
[1:40:22] that Rapture as you are saying that the
[1:40:25] purpose of the message I like that one
[1:40:27] is the body change
[1:40:31] and there are many blessings of the
[1:40:33] message that are incentives but that is
[1:40:35] not the main purpose
[1:40:37] so no one must miss that coming Rapture
[1:40:41] um we thank the Lord and we thank him
[1:40:43] for coming this way and
[1:40:46] this is not the full coming person I
[1:40:48] think you should come when the old
[1:40:49] church is here and
[1:40:52] um on a good Sunday or good weekend
[1:40:55] meeting
[1:40:56] we'll see how possible that can be
[1:40:59] so less for our heads as we pray
[1:41:03] our heavenly father we thank you for
[1:41:05] this service we thank you Lord father
[1:41:06] for the anointing that we felt your
[1:41:09] presence that we felt further through as
[1:41:12] you are ministering like those who were
[1:41:13] going to a mouth they said did not our
[1:41:15] husband when we are speaking father I
[1:41:18] know there's been great impartation as
[1:41:20] the word was going forth in our Lord I
[1:41:23] know someone has a testimony in the
[1:41:25] making someone Lord father will come and
[1:41:28] say surely from that day things are not
[1:41:30] the same father I pray that that
[1:41:32] anointing that Holy Spirit Will provoke
[1:41:35] each one of us to stand in their purpose
[1:41:37] to work for you while they stay alone
[1:41:40] for the way with the ability while we
[1:41:42] have the chance to do so anointed his
[1:41:44] father heal the sick and deliver the
[1:41:46] captives unsaving those who are online
[1:41:48] who are watching with us today Father
[1:41:51] may you anoint your servant and give him
[1:41:52] strength and shall be going forth a lord
[1:41:55] for the preaching throughout the nation
[1:41:56] in our day and wherever he shall go may
[1:42:00] be a blessing as he has been a blessing
[1:42:02] to us father we feel that new
[1:42:04] connections has been met in Fellowship
[1:42:07] in friendship and further even in the
[1:42:09] ministry may you bless him in the church
[1:42:11] and let this tie that has been made a
[1:42:14] lot of father that binds our hearts in
[1:42:16] Christian life grows stronger and
[1:42:18] stronger till the day when you shall old

[1:43:36] the enemy let your pillow fight be in
[1:43:38] the way Lord father to protect them and
[1:43:41] further to bring them safely and also
