of you that I've had greeting us sir thank you for fellowshipping with us today actually most people are not here today never one traversing activity but we had sisters Stella and uh we know she went for marking Man United against and also Sister Rose Center greetings that to me uh she just returned from Lira It's a Long John I think she's never taken it before and so she's with us I think maybe by streaming that I just wanted to uh let you know that we we are on the height of the preparations for the Youth meetings how many young people here are waiting for the Youth meetings it's going to be a wonderful time I believe you're really warming up for it we're expecting a lot we are believing that the Lord will come and visit the young people I tell you what if you can be in prayer for those meetings [Music] but if it happens that until then you've not received him I want to say this I believe that will be your time and maybe some of you that are struggling with things just come and come surrendered come believing and expect the marvelous to happen again so these are going to be uh meetings of creating an atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to do his work in your life um I have this a heavy burden on my heart I believe that the Lord has never disappointed us so he will not disappoint us this time also you are the speakers have already prepared themselves to come to take our uh morning devotion services if you were able to look at the program about we we will have more those morning devotions for those who sleep around who will be sleeping around and so but also anybody's welcome I don't think I need to reiterate the program because it's all over WhatsApp I'm sure how many have seen it how many have not yet seen it okay so some of you are raising your hands you're you are on the WhatsApp groups I don't know why you did not see it but if you've not seen it don't go away without seeing it ask somebody here they will just share it with you amen so we have already secured uh this place at the at the school promise which is just near here we shall be hosting all the young people that will come again um initially like I said not planned to host the young people but there seemed to be demand for read so we have organized and arranged for it and so then that calls also for a fee to support the accommodations and the food and all that so we've said I think it's the the smallest I've had in Kampala since 20 000 for everybody that you will want to spend around and that will not actually cater for everything him because many here in the church are also contributing so that will just support a little cut out so your food your your place to stay America and then of course we're going to be serving breakfast lunch supper together uh beginning with Friday night Saturday and Sunday the whole day you know if you come just plan prepare to live on Monday morning and then those who will just come to attend the services here they will pay 10 000. and that will be meant to also support a little on the food the lunch that will be served those days [Music] so I spoke to brother Robert and this morning I think yes and he told me that he has already announced and he's going to announce and encourage his young people to come Lifeboat okay what about my way of streaming okay so I say that many of you streamed so I was thinking you will have a double portion before we go to the world I just wanted to let you know that we've passed out a budget no dollar um trying to pull it up here brother Isaac another amount organization okay now this yes I've found it this is a all that is going to be needed for just the food and accommodation we will need a total of about 14 Millions but for the food and accommodation um we will need 7.4 yeah so we've been already contributing probably on Wednesday we contributed brother Andrew how much was contributed do you have an amount she's also pledging so you have to write that down she's pledging a hundred kilograms of rice so and and we need 160 kilograms with rice we are remaining only with 60. yes and uh she has also said she will also pledge all the onions again foreign [Music] [Music] again I believe we should be able to take care of them and take care of ourselves that was just what I meant I mean do we believe that we are a younger generation and you know what I believe that we should own uh our meetings and we should support them we should support our Ministries with our own substance there is a blessing in doing that so to you who is receiving it I'm sure you'll receive a blessings amen amen so while we stand at three minutes I'd like also to let you know that uh after this service we shall have a business meeting services so to those of you who have been attending the fellowship here the past year and you've given them you've given offerings you've given on the church uh land fund we are collecting money to buy our own land and build today we would like to report to you how much we have how much your money has done and everything that goes with that it would not be long maybe 30 minutes or 40 so please come and just listen to them but for now for an hour or so I'd like us to stand and get into the world and see what the Lord has for us this morning I noticed from just during the end of the year I had five meetings in on the same weekend my weekend DM in two different countries and I noticed I've not recovered from that yet pray for me for God to give me strength this morning are you expecting to hear something from him today are you expecting amen he will speak to you let us pray Lord Jesus we want to thank you so much this morning you know what these people need this um so we are going to the Book of Psalms foreign we will read verses 6 to 9. and I'm reading in the name of the Lord let not them that wait on thee O Lord God of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o God of Israel because for thy sake I have borne reproach shame has covered my face I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an Aryan and to my mother's children for the Zeal of thine house has eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are Fallen upon me foreign [Music] I mean you may be seated so this morning our subject is bearing reproach for Christ you know this subject I usually love speaking on things that are really real in our lives because then this is what we need to be able to grow spiritually so this subject of bearing reproach for Christ is a subject that we all deal with in a daily to wit them if you believed on Jesus at one point in your life you will have to bear reproach you know it's like a man or a woman who gets married to a man she is going to Bear reproach anything to do with this man again this man is a good man um she will receive the Praises but whatever he does she's somehow going to be accountable you can never be free from the things that your husband does the life of your husband is a part of you and you are part of it just like you know brother says that if you want to know a man look at what he married if you know no matter what it says the man can even be a preacher he may even Sing and Shout you know seem to behave so well and be so nice but it's not what he is or what he says he is what he says he is is nothing you will see his real self through the woman he married the brothers who are married here can you say Amen Amina brothers who are married are you here you know not many brothers want to say Amen to that food is true but my wife has bad behaviors whatever way that your wife is we know you by your wife that's right and in the same way we know Jesus by the wife he marries yes if you know he marries a sex Queen you know then we know that that's how Christ is so many of those who claim to Believe In Christ but when you look at their life carefully that's nothing to do with the character nature of Christ then we surely know they are not of him so in other words your nature and your character Community is reflect the nature and the character of Jesus Christ and here now we see David in the Book of Psalms David was a type of Christ brother says are the many things that David said Christ said amen and you know David was a prophet but here he says because for thy sake I have borne reproach shame has covered my face I am become a stranger unto my brethren um you remember David when he came one day and and he was first of all he was the harder of sheep and how the lion once came to eat sheep and he killed that lion and then a bear wanted to come and kill also the Sheep he killed it so David was a man that had experience by the things he suffered and after many years we know that David was anointed to be the next king of Israel you cannot see anyone defying the word which you claim to believe and you said nothing and you say who am I to judge I believe Believers every believer must have the Zeal of the lord of the house of the Lord should eat us amen and David from when he was a little boy so you know it was none of his business he was not a soldier but when he came he said but who is this you know he would have said please kill him not for sure if no one is going to go again I am going to go if no one is going to do anything about it again foreign you know I'm not just a man cinnamon you are looking at me as a little boy I'm not just a little boy I have an experience with the Lord I am a Shepherd yes it was right there at my post of Duty the Lord was with me a lion I began to fight with it another time who is this uncircumcised Philistine give me a chance he will show you that I have a living and they all said foreign hey okay I'll give you a chance but before I give you a chance come here brother to give you a chance but little David you don't have to wear my jacket so you can go and defeat foreign [Applause] hallelujah amen and David told them because of Christ for Christ that time of Victory himself he will never let you be ashamed the problem is men and Christians but I'll tell you you don't have to pray for it oh Lord Give Me Your reproach you don't need to pray as long as you stand with the world if you stand with the word everywhere you go you're natural where you are you're natural with anybody you take your way with the world the reproach will always but if it doesn't come it means you are not standing with the world and so he says I became a stranger unto my brethren um so he told them let me face him now I know you don't all believe me but let me first they laughed at him he said I don't care because I don't mind let me bear this Repro for the god of Israel is a living God and he took you know how is it called slingshot now and you know as he rotated it around Faith was building up you know how we rotate our slingshot um that is through prayer who does not pray has never believed you have to have that that desire even of stirring up your faith I'm stirring up your faith in the word of God [Music] it wasn't David who was throwing it it was the holy spirit amen he directed that stone Hallelujah right to the head of this Goliath had already been thrown in threes I will kill you and I'll feed you to the birds foreign stepped on this giant you know and I don't know how he lifted this way [Music] off the head I mean and put the head up Guru if you barely push for Christ God will give you a moment of victory blessed are ye in Luke chapter 6 verse 22. when man shall hurt you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast you your name as evil for the son of man is sick Rejoice he in that day and live for Joy for the Lord your reward is great in heaven for in life in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophetsu [Music] [Music] Guru amen I mean again I mean blessed are yeah tell your neighbor blessed are you yeah when men shall hurt you when they shall separate you from their company please understand this scriptures blessed are you when you hate men when you separate yourself from there did you hear that why don't we overcome the world and see because we are trying to leave the world we are trying to escape from the world see Christ is not going to take escapees but it's going to take those the world to whom the world has escaped from and see the Bible says listen to me carefully the Bible says reject the devil and he will do what now and he will do what and I could actually flee from Jesus hey you don't flee from the devil none of you has that ability because in your natural nature you are born to love the devil because you are born to love him nature betrays you your soul loves the Lord but your flesh loves the things of the world and heal yourself you know it now okay every day you love the things of the world even when you're a Believer when the music of the world is played there right now begin dancing some of you may even try to remain still because you don't want to show do you know you are dancing because you are that shall betrays that fast nature I will come back is the nature of sin we turn the world is the nature of the world put on the ones it loves you were born loving the world and I'm sorry you can never take that out of you is going to be with you chicken the better now until you go to the grave of kutus but there is something God wants you to do God wants you to love him God wants you to stand for his word the more you take your stand with the words God the world will run away from you hallelujah amen how many friends do you have foreign [Music] [Music] I cannot compromise take a little lipstick my friends I am sorry most anyway I can play with anything I cannot play with the words if they have a seed of God in them that will cause them to repent of them but if they don't have the seed of God in them they will reject you but yeah I will call you a fool they call you good for nothing and that is what is called a reproach for Christ you don't bring it upon yourself you only believe the world you will make enemies when men shall hit you around to whatever blessed are you or you I'm a kisser when men shall separate you from their company blessed are you all you are when men shall reproach you blessed are you Hallelujah when they will cast your name as evil blessed are you Hallelujah because they are doing that for Jesus is sick haha but yes some of you when someone tells you you are a fools how can you believe such a thing in this 21st century and then the more you hear them how are you only for today and then the next day only for today and then you put because I thought you were a fool your name is you just refuse the reproach of Christ but the Bible says for the sake of Christa and he said what should you do then rejoice in that day Hallelujah that day when you are approached for Christ Rejoice stop there he said also you should leap for John amen hallelujah foreign [Music] [Applause] how many of us are ready to accept the reproach for Christ I'm challenging you today to accept the reproach for Christ Rejoice hallelujah amen you know the word calls us fools also they call us nuts not or whatever it is they they also call us um you know Holy Rollers audible what about here in Uganda what do they call us they have called it to you before so please tell us yes what else come on the devil worshipers okay but devil worshiper culture [Music] look at this food what else huh all the women you make yourself old can you style up hallelujah amen when they call you those things we've acquitted in 12 years my brother my sister oh my you are blessed God blessed because you have just earned yourself a blessing amen and because you've been reproached for the sake of Christ and I sell you a place never turn your face down because you are reproached always Rejoice always Rejoice tell your neighbor always rejoice precious cat my sister yeah don't ever feel bad because you don't look like the world don't ever feel sorry about it let me tell you I love the way I worship my God I love the way I believe the world that's even when I go to church I want to shout I want to sing amen I want to dance [Applause] if you are approached because of that is you know when you go to church you know the devil wants you to be even quiet even in the church we have so many Believers defeated in church the devil will let you go but he will give you rules and regulations maybe the best thing you can do is try to use WhatsApp but they have seen you in charge they have seen you in charge but don't be there is The Gospel According to Lucifer but the Gospel According to Christ Angelia Christopher he says come to church oh when you get him how do we have church when we are here in the world we rejoice when we're here in the world we stand on our feet we are not sorry to swallow and we are not ashamed that is what makes us believer Hallelujah that's what differences us from the Baptists and the others praise the name of the Lord the Bible says don't worry when you are dressed in a different ways you put if everybody is cutting off all their sleeves I don't know how they call it the sleeve of the trousers if everybody is using chains if everybody is using earrings remove your earrings if everybody is using lipsticks don't use it and what will this do Captain will cause you reproach and when it causes they never feel ashamed the swelling of Christ Apostle Paul said in the Book of Romans I am not ashamed of the Gospel when she because there's the power of God and the Salvation this word save us on the last day this is the part of God because of this one you were not [Applause] you are not gonna be ashamed you will tell them everybody's doing it but Hallelujah I am not everybody hallelujah amen I am somebody's blood balls I am not of this world if nobody will whatever if everybody is going to have a girlfriend people have boyfriends and girlfriends when you ask them when are you going to get married Pastor maybe in five years you must not have a girlfriend that is the way of the world for marriage there's a difference between dating and quoting you go out [Applause] you you you you go to bed when is your marriage you see that is the way of the world if someone is going to quote you they must have either the permission of your pastor or your father sisters don't give your numbers to this young man foreign they should first come to his your pastor that's the way we believe it come to your pastor first if if your intentions are good why do you fear to come and tell me I want to marry your daughter why why do you go to her you are by passing the door going through the windows and the ventilators if you give them your numbers they will kill you but if he's a genuine man he will come through the pastor he's a bastard I can't take my mind off of sister fortunate you're fortunate everybody I love her with all my heart and I will tell the brother have you prayed about it he will say yes they will not fumble around because he knows what is his brothers and he will come back again are you sure yes and I also know fortunate is a good girl for marriage I don't attack for her for him we don't believe in matchmaking there's a brother who told me please speak to that sister for me and I said brother if I do that it means I'm the one now married you have to go and throw your application yourself and when they accept the applications and sister when someone comes to you before you say anything you are number one thing to do is my pastor aware um do you know you can never accept any brother until your fathers give any permission if your father does not give any permission and you accept and you vow no like either that's nothing it's just rubbishiro because the Bible Bible and the prophet says if that father gets to know of it is be careful again there is this is not a joking area but the world has come into the church we should be not ashamed we have been told in this message let us not be ashamed of the world to the eggs that you find a big boys writing little girls I love you that's the spirit of love this is not a speed of marriage and we are days of the voice should not entertain it in a finger days of The Voice [Applause] and we should not be ashamed of our stance we should stand with what the message says because if you stand with the message you can never be wrong if you bear the reproach for Christ there is a victory waiting God still asks people and our generation both men and women and I can speak that on Authority because I am one of them as far as the word is concerned I'm still a virgin today sometimes all right I'll not go there but you know boys immaturity foreign [Music] you know I have a friend of mine by the power he started uh uh political science or something like that yes and so he works with big organizations and so sometimes they uh receive opportunities of going for trips and it's been to Europe so one day he was on the plane and he was giving me his testimony and that was sad I think it was uh some Swiss Airlines or something like that or something yeah so then what would you like the everything they mentioned there was no soda there was no water it was beverages and he runs through the list and he told me I thought to myself I used to be a heavy drunkard I used to take Banks but the Lord delivered me and saved me I'm not going to go back this is a man who used to take all these drugs and you had dreadlocks and he was sleeping on the roads he was going for the cat like how many times but the Lord delivered him and he started a society or an organization of soba he called it sober life not to go in that lifestyle and so here he is presented with another opportunity to take a little beverage is all by himself foreign of the Gospel put it he took the refresh the woman looked at him confused maybe he has never taken this kind of things and then they were going as a team on his team from Kenya Kenya he was only a team of two the other was a little girl um and saw the book for them in a very expensive I think whatever Hotel one of the expensive cities and so he told me he said um there is when you know you are saved or not and these days I don't know what women are turning in um they don't wait for the boys they move themselves and so at that hotel lobby [Applause] their rooms were opposite it is you know like can I yeah and he told her I'm sorry I'm a Christian I don't do this kind of thing and she was embarrassed she went back to her room she gave him a distance and she respected him like nothing foreign and one day I was on one of the mission trips and I was going through Tanzania and I was going by bus because it was late I had to take a night into a place and so the place was very cold being that it was near the sea company and so I was in there but really feeling so cold and I was not yet married I was a young boy already on the mission work that was like 17 or something like that wow and so this man comes in my guide um foreign [Music] and the anger of the Lord came upon him and I told this man wow immediately you were shaking and moved and and said I did not know I'm so sorry you are interpreter supposed to interpret these things and he said I'm sorry but for about one hour um I lied on my bed thinking nobody was here to see me Peppa no one not my parents not my father my brothers my friends no one okay so I was not going to ask him the name of Christ because the Angels were there the angels of God are always encamping around those who fear the names you are going to be presented with that rare opportunity one day every day foreign this is a challenge are you hearing me friends this is a challenge oh are you going to ashame the name of Christ I wonder what you are going to do let's take a moment to think about it bearing reproach for Christ I promised you I would be one hour once I have three minutes to go I'll just starting but it's good to keep it's good to keep your word as a Christian nature in the message the reproach for the cause of the word and I'd like you to take this message each of you and listen to it or read it is God has a time and the reason for that time to fulfill all his Works God knows just exactly what he's going to do again we don't for that woman we just have to receive it as he gives it to us but he knows and there is nothing going to go wrong with what he has planned to do it has all have to come about he called you for a purpose oh yes I'm convinced he called me for a puppy and Peter originated he called you for a Papa he agreed already he would have been born in a believer's home you might have been born in a believer's home and that way you had that message the message I might have found you somewhere there is a purpose foreign when I was 15 years I thought God had destroyed my life I was first here with a bright future energy I had big promises they were driving me to school very young but I had everything I wish against it there is a scripture he gave me though he said foreign then he then he he here our support says the mystery of his will again there is nothing going wrong then why they been to the owner said whatever happened in your life in the past this is a bombshell listen to this whatever happened in your life was part of the plan oh baby God has a plan cartoon but you see it is a mystery of his wings some of us were to go before him God tell me now why did you call me he won't tell you but you know what he does oh praise the name of it he calls you justifies sanctifies by blessing you and positioning you in your place thundering Skies if we didn't have those things
