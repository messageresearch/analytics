man we're just a lovely body we love each one of you oh movie them so thrilled to see what the Lord's been doing in the country it's been such a such an encouragement to see how the Lord's been moving may he continue to move amen you know the scripture of jehu in the Bible is you know how it talks about jehu and his Chariot moment you ever know what it feels like if you rode in that Chariot that jehu drove quite well I drove like jehu this morning amen we were coming to coming to church this morning it was a little bit like Jehovah because God had a purpose this morning and we're gonna appreciate it amen I'm here now hey man we sure love him don't we Gala let's turn to our scriptures this morning I actually was going a different direction and I have I actually have two sets of notes up here video and uh so I thought I was going one way but uh we're just gonna change directions a little bit this morning just believe the Lord has a will to this morning amen amen we're gonna we're gonna turn the scripture to Isaiah 59. this is a scripture that everybody probably knows quite well laundry it's one of those scriptures that are like a banner scripture [Music] questions and so we'll start in verse 19. so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and His glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift a standard against him foreign and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression and Jacob saith the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever foreign [Applause] hey man that's not man saying that it says saith the Lord amen Amina it's the seed or I should say Thai mouth this is a multi-generational scripture here amen amen whoever is speaking to it said it's never gonna go away because when I put my seed in thy mouths amen Amina because it's Everlasting God's word don't die Amina amen amen let's bow our head in prayer precious Heavenly Father Lord we approach your word this morning Lord the revealed word we are so thankful foreign [Music] Lord they could hear the word like never before this morning foreign I'm going to take it maybe just a tad slower this morning because we got a couple more services hey man in Japanese right amen we'll try I said try and go slower this morning I'm gonna I'm just gonna take the title this morning we'll just title it a generation with power almost amen many people have entrepanji have preached on power there's the power of choice there's the power of the Cross there's the power of the blood there's the power over sin there's the power of the spoken word there's the power of Grace the word of his power is power to pursue you know these are all titles you know what humans are actually consumed with the desire for power yes yes somehow there's a desire to to be powerful some desire strength there was a gentleman in 2014 um he said a new world record with a 500 pound log yes I wouldn't think so this gentleman also he did a raw squat who's there who knows what a squat is a squat like gym class you know you go down and you do squats you put the weights on your shoulders we call that a squad I don't know what you call it that's the name of it but this fella in 2014 he did an 880 pound squat um 880 pounds on his shoulders serious power in them yeah he did a 900 pound deadlift Nazi Tula pound so that's if you do and he did a 629 pound bench press that power you didn't think you were coming to Fitness class did you man has mental power there's men that there's men and women that have Minds that are just incredible and they desire more search for man wisdom it's like an insatiable thirst man desire man has built machines to lift spaceships spaceships into space [Music] these are all just different forms of a power you know there's electrical power there was some lightning I think or some Thunder yesterday in the clouds there's there's lightning bolts no one lightning bolt when it zaps the ground it has enough power in a bolt of lightning just one and it comes out like that because just that fast you're blinking it's gone but in that one bolt of lightning it could light up because 56 homes for about one day thank you there's the natural disasters anybody ever seen a hurricane or a tornado dance [Music] yes Amina and man who seeks to be powerful presidents around the world that feel they have the most power and yet there's a desire for more but I want to speak today on a different Power Man can have their intellectual Powers they can have their machine or to speak about a different Power today you know when a disaster strikes oh you wonder how are you gonna how would you respond yeah I don't know if you've ever had a major disaster or you know do they have earthquakes or anything here yeah earthquakes so if you're in a community and there is a massive landslide that came down wait a minute and the power of all that Earth now that is moving to consume a community and now things start to get in in a bit of a panic moment [Music] everything that you were doing has just ceased and something now some people respond differently in these situations some people freeze but some people they switch gears something inside of them that they didn't even really even know was there kicks in the gear [Music] right and so they become suddenly this this they become calm they start directing what needs to happen they're running to maybe save a loved one that needs some Inner Strength that they didn't even know was there came to the surface you understand so there's a power that goes beyond physical it's somewhere inside that in a moment of disaster what you said is all right amen you know some people are like ah you know if I was in an earthquake I would be calm as a cucumber does that make is that a saying here and it just means that's usually how it is It's usually the person that you'd never think you never think they have something in them some inner strength and see everybody in the world you know they're all into yoga yoga right you know what yoga is yoga there's a different Inner Strength that comes from above not from sitting cross-legged with my fingers in a circle thinking about I don't know what you're too loud but there's a real Inner Strength that comes in a different time uh amen amen we're gonna go into that little bit so a common response a common response in a time of crisis these are the top five common responses some people a crisis comes a disaster strikes and they actually they they will start to laugh because they don't know how to process what's happening I don't know what to do and instead of having something cut rise up they Resort into either laughter or just silence this is this is this is actually science telling you this right now you know this is what they have studied this is what they say are the five common responses some people procrastinate disaster strikes and you get in a life or death situation and people then they want to prepare somehow when the World Trade Center was hit by a plane a wild Trade Center in Union America here here we are in a major moment of Crisis and they said 40 of the people in the tower went and gathered their personal belongings before they left the tower [Music] you're like the building is about to go down and you're worrying about them that's crazy but it's a moment of crisis spiritually moment of Crisis Satan coming in like a flood oh I'll I'll maybe maybe next service maybe tomorrow I'll just get it later my social life's much more important you're in a tower which is zimby and it's coming down don't be running off for your personal belongings some people they have arrogance you know when an hurricane came in it comes into Florida so often Florida and so many people like nah my host is fine I'll put up some boards on the windows it's all good there's arrogance there just another storm and then what happens is in a few hours their house is not there anymore that's right they said in Hurricane Floyd in 1999 70 of the people drowned most of them in their cars in the flooded streets because despite the warning of saying hey don't drive in that water don't go out there [Music] that's okay I got this it's an arrogance say don't go out in the world don't go out in the world don't go in the world don't go out don't fool them don't play with Satan's Kings [Music] don't go out and do that habit tell them that no problem don't socialize with those friends right Amina some people in a crisis moment they get tunnel vision but for not indoors and they get so focused on just one thing is some people in in many times in a flood they get so focused on their on their cats everything's flooding hurricanes coming from and they're barely barely surviving but my cat is inside like you're gonna die but they get Tunnel Vision on one little thing right [Music] [Applause] forget about the habit some people in a crisis they just go into paralyze they get paralyzed happens often you go into a state of War okay and it's just there's just so much going on right it's just a catastrophe all around and some people they just freeze that's where if you look into studies they study about what's called a thousand yard stairs it's where soldiers are standing there and he's just looking and every chaos is all around him but he's in such a State of Shock foreign that's how it is sometimes in spiritual Crisis get in such a state of spiritual trauma is up some people just are in shock and they're just paralyzed for these are common reactions in a crisis but there are some there are a few that react totally different we would call them a heroic active some power inside of them they don't laugh they don't procrastinate they don't have an arrogance you don't got tunnel vision they're not in shock but they move in action something moves up an inner substance bombs are dropping balloons are coming down um they get in action that's when a nuclear reactor in Russia blew up major disaster late 80s brother Michael that's like long before I was born it was so long ago it's history I was like born in 2000s it still applies Chernobyl they had to send divers into the radioactive water nobody wanted to go into into the into the plants they had to go and release a valve they stood there in a room and they said to the workers that were in there he said we need three people to go back into the plant okay in the dark and find this valve and most people foreign amen Amina everybody know about the Titanic you don't want the Titanic of course it went down and thousands of people died but you know who is thought to be the last person that went into the water is It's usually the the captain of the boat captain but one of the chefsumbi you say well who is that exactly probably a nobody on them but he was tossing people into boats chairs overboard and finally as the boat went down he was the last one to hang on the rail and go down with the boat [Music] most people are running back and forth trying to find a spot on a Lifeboat he's looking overboard toss and chairs because there are swimmers down there I needed something to float with chocolate how are you that calm when the boat is going down [Music] all right one more example for you there was a man called Louis Zamperini um Italian he's Italian Italy whiskey from Moonshiners but his brother forced him to start running so he started to run he actually went to the Olympics Olympics he then joined the military and in the war and I'm going to tell him his plane gosh it crashed and he's in a Lifeboat in the water with two other comrades so here he's on the water for over 30 days they have to bury one of his buddies in the water 47 Days Later 47 days on the ocean he's rescued foreign countless Horrors he then went to another camping and Time After Time After Time he was beaten somehow the the the leader of the Campbell just focused on him all the time in fact at one point the commander of the camp Oh no um had him punched in the face 220 times that is just one out of Untold amount of things he had to go through [Music] but he did something in him would not let him give up it's almost Indescribable the one time the the captain or the the commander yeah [Music] foreign [Music] he said I don't even how you go through those things [Music] but it's because there's a power inside compelling him I'm gonna live I'm gonna live there's something about life [Music] there's a drive of life just doesn't want to give up so now spiritually when a disaster comes like a flood the enemy is coming there is one who raises a standard amen I want you to spark all those examples in your mind in the back of your mind that's a natural aspect there's a natural power inside spiritually there's a flood upon us but then there's got to be a power man there's got to be a standard must rise up push back again the anime movie so let's step back in time just a little bit and here Bueno Satan's kingdom suffered a devastating blow wow that day on Calvary Calvary amen amen and Satan was reeling it is from the impact of what had just happened what just took place in Calvary Church Satan going back to his control he's going back to his planning room seeing how do I deal with this what just happened there on the cross all of my plans amen Amina hey man we'll go into it maybe in another service of what happened at that moment but Satan had to go back said Tanya he had to devise a new plan I need to figure out a way I just can't let this one rise up and demolish my kingdom this way [Applause] and so Satan got started going to work he says how do I do this his mind goes back to the beginning he says I just must pervert the word again I need to infiltrate the word ready to corrupt the word if it worked one Eve if I could just pervert in a little bit you won't die if that is what worked there you know why why change it up I'm just gonna go back to my original plan yeah and so now Satan starts it's a tiny not time to come his plan yeah brother Brian says now because when we see God's seed begin to take hold on he says then that fellow coming in is just as slick as he can be Who quote scripture watch him he's a deceiver he's a deformer A perverter or a corrupter of the Original Seed that's what he is attorney Charlie you know times have changed a little bit we gotta adapt with the time just the message a little bit we need to make it a little easier it's too strict you know so just a little bit it's okay to act like the world and go to church it's okay to do that I can live one way no I'll come to church but I can live corrupt on the other side not the message I serve oh yeah but Satan's a perverter Amen brother Brahm says now watch for that corrupter [Applause] he'll be Sly he'll be slick but keep your vision keep your vision when someone says well you know I don't know if brother Branham really said that or do you really need to follow that you say I'm keeping my eyes on the prize I tell you you just don't accept someone says well you know what the prophet said this is you know I don't know you go and look up in the message you go search it out don't you just swallow also well yeah brother Branham said brother Branham said through your filter her I'm gonna go read it myself that's why there's a passion to get the message into your language around the world because you got to be able to dig into this message you have to dig into this message for yourself not riding on someone else's Revelation what God reveals to you how can you reveal it to you if you don't dig into it you ever play we call the game a telephone and if I whisper the word to this brother here and he's here it tells it to this and he tells it and then he whispers and you just keep Whispering it along I guarantee you it isn't the word that I told this brother it's gotten it's gotten perverted a little bit corrupted as it went through everybody that's why you must be able to read the word yourself go through a whole bunch of people you need to be able to read it revealed to you that's why we showed her the burden to run with this message don't let Satan play a game and telephone with you okay and so Satan Satan started to release a power yeah Through the Ages now his desire to corrupt The Original Seed of God he said I want you to dig in a little bit young people no if we're reading the scripture we read about the powers that were released in Revelation and we know the horse riders that were sent out [Music] we know Revelation and then there's the four living creatures that surround the throne we know the lion the ox the man amen Amina all right if it wasn't for this message we would be of men most miserable everybody has their idea of what that scripture means that has a commentary on one way one preacher has his idea of what they are in another type of way but if it wasn't for a prophet we would be lost we'd be wondering ourselves well I don't know what that means one one minister in a denomination he said he had some idea I won't go into forsake a time I won't read it all yeah but he he put his idea of what the the beasts around the throne were yeah he's like oh the line is because there is courage [Applause] he was thinking you know what's the wing it's the eagle it's the wings of eagles that bring us towards heaven try and come up with some idea of what they think it is it's a corrupter yeah that's right amen in Israeli the Ark of the Covenant I was in the temple there were four the the Israel was it was it was placed around the Tabernacle oh they said there were three tribes on this side is foreign foreign all right Amina and so he goes to his Stables he says all right he bridles up a white horse says I need you to ride okay [Music] to combat the word she says I need you to ride he leads out this white innocent looking horse [Music] and Satan says I got an answer and so he gets and he straddles he gets up on that horse foreign [Music] and so he starts to ride at times starting to feed out teaching that time the cocoa that was contrary to the word of God is that is the devil is subtle he's a planner yeah who plays the game of chess I think there's somebody in Uganda that was like a super duper chess champion yeah it was a young lady right I know more than you about Jason it's strategy I'm gonna put my you know my my Pawn here's just looking for a Checkmate and so he sends out his power foreign and now the ultimate goal is to remove life out of God's Church his ultimate goal is to make you cold and so he starts to shift well that's not exactly maybe what it means you start to pervert the word of God in your own thinking well I don't know if that's really what it means you have now injected your own image of what you think this message is you have raised up an idol that's what he's trying to do yeah see it's just not that way he just said time to check us out exactly the way not your own ideas but that white horse went out to ride conquer the church and cease the life force from it yes I mean it happened but God said that's okay I I see Satan trying to ride [Applause] he's like I got a power too I can release something too and so he calls for a lion he says Satan just released his White Horse he's trying to pervert my words but I have something to come back bring out a lion and now send my word for it and that lion anointing started to descend upon the apostles because it was gonna spread forth that true word of God force and strength amen scripture says in Acts [Music] [Applause] says the lion happened Amina come on you're like who is this guy this is an illiterate fisherman he doesn't even know how to sign his name area ain't God don't really care what you know can I turned that tough fight I can't sign your name and you go forward hey man Amina he stood boldly in the face of the world at that time hey you're in Africa you know what lions are Africa they ain't afraid of nothing yeah that's right they walk like they own the jungle because they're kingaka and that's why that Spirit descended power to send it on Paul and Silas there they were chained up their arms chained to the ground oh but they started to praise of Crisis oh cookies of disaster they weren't running away they weren't Frozen What do we do now a boldness came about them they said these circumstances don't bother us what happened that jail shook apart [Applause] it was the lion demonstrating its might yeah it is amen Amina brother Branham says that Antichrist was writing his false teaching God he's teaching tooth the lion of the tribe of Judah Emperor because the word made manifests he says that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles Visions in power or let me help let's go to battle amen I'm in now he says it's because it was a living word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah writing out to come back now you got it he sends his power to my mind again the antichristo God sends his word um [Music] they Clash amen amen he says I think the disciples in the early days no degrees Divine has a degree no denomination one thing that was the Holy Spirit that they received they didn't need nothing else amen what a time that was when the lion was roaring amen Peter and John better nail gun walking through the gate beautiful here was a beggar on the side of the street Peter says pets I don't have silver I don't have anything of that nature I can imagine Satan was looking down on that moment he'd sent out his White Horse here now he was looking at an instance down there he's saying what's this what exactly is happening Peter says [Applause] Jesus Christ Satan didn't even know what to do something just happened right devil that was a Power released into a piece of the Antichrist amen [Applause] [Applause] you know what brother Brown said he said one hundredth chikumi in the Jays of the lion Monaco is power was released 100th of them 100. Satan said my goodness what do I do I need to change my tactic so he goes back to his tablet and he pulls out another horse another Power he leads out all right I can deal with this so he jumps off the white another Brandon says a red horse his rider Goes Forth [Music] same one yeah just another Power he's riding um a power given to him with a great sword he said this is Satan again that's the devil in another form yes said it's a man this man has a sword he says it pertains to the church said it's a political war and he said it changed from the innocent white to a bloody red is it all right if you're not gonna believe my perversion what can you just take my little my little tweets I'll just wipe them out and one Satan starts to destroy God's people I went to back 68 million Martyrs hundreds after hundreds a spiritual disaster who was upon the Earth that's right Amina and the Antichrist then went from Spirit went from Deeds to a Doctrine crowning a false prophet now church and state now had power echanism [Music] foreign I'll bring out my power amen I know exactly what's needed I know exactly what is needed I know how to react to this so as the enemy enemy's tactic shifted God said that's okay I have another anointing that I can send to my people and so out went forth the anointing of an Oxi and willingly one by one they were kicking and screaming they were fighting it they willingly went to this into the arena they went Parker to the stake they went never again in fact there was an account of one sister her name was [Music] this just gives you an idea of the anointing that was inside they didn't even know what they were doing how it switched from a lion anointing to an auction that's okay my savior demands me to live lay my life down and this one lady he's a little sister she was there in prison she had been put in prison for for being a Christian I won't go in all details but here she was she had a little baby and she who she was they were her father was just so dismayed and she was trying to make her to recanted trying to tell her you just stop being a Christian just recant of this she pointed to a vase yes um like a like a a ball a yes she said what is this Dad he said well that's a that's a ball she says it can't stop being what it is I can't just give up I'm not a Christian anymore it doesn't work that way something inside of her driving her edge it says I must if I must lay my life and they're inside the prison with her was another little another sister is pregnant and she was almost ready to deliver and she was so distraught because she was worried that she would not be able to give her life because they wouldn't send her to the arena being pregnant she prayed that she would give birth yes so that she could join her fellow Christians at the appointed day what you said he gave birth she gave birth and joined perpetua and they stood there as the the wild beast got in Solo in Cambridge tried to consume them which it didn't it just it just hurt them it hurt them and so they had to bring out some Gladiators [Music] I'm just showing you the power you say how could they do that your mind is telling you right now I don't even know if I could do that it's okay foreign I'll let you hold that thought we'll get there and now can you cut me down and Perpetual they had knelt down and the soldiers that came to take her life was a novice and he struck her with his sword yeah foreign amen Satan is like what is going on said it was attaching in the muscle for every one I killed there's a hundred more behind them how could this be Italian [Applause] he couldn't figure it out it enraged him as he tried to stomp out everything is [Applause] good man brother Branham says in the days of the oxente just a teeny little drop a cartoon [Music] God doesn't need many you just need one to plant his seed into it so Satan's getting really frustrated he's like I forced Millions to recanted so I gotta go back to my stable you know who died I gotta figure out what to do here every time I bring one out every time [Applause] my enemy sends out something greater you think Satan would have learned by now huh you get up nope so he goes back to this is it we have just a little strength Dark Age it was midnight for them for the True Believer Catholicism had taken over all that didn't agree with Catholicism was killed he said in his black horse [Applause] starts to ride I'm sure Satan thought victory was close he corrupted it so much now he starts charging for prayers indulgences the Holy Eucharist this is the literal blood and Body of Christ that's why it was a black horse is capturing the wealth of the world he says the scale weighing out if you go into scripture how the scripture reads measure of wheat for a penny which three measures of body for a penny if you guys say it if you are centered brother Branham said he was stripping his subjects of their money you say well that's a long time ago no that is still happening you know that to remain in good standing as a good Catholic you have to confess your sins once a year [Music] come on yeah okay if you want to be a good Catholic once a year you have to confess yourself my goodness Paul says I died daily yeah he says it but in a survey done a couple years ago three quarters of Catholics a return to me said they go to confession less than once a year again [Music] or not even at all [Applause] so now you can get a partial Indulgence [Applause] to reduce your time in purgatory [Applause] you know they outlawed indulgences in 1567. I was back at Martin Luther's days but you know now you can make a donation and so you know if you give some donations you can limit you know and you know some Indulgence kind of a one they call it a plenary Indulgence per sinner it still happens today you think that power isn't riding it was riding and it still has Contin and it stripped the people to foreign [Applause] [Music] Brilliant Minds of language and different ones like Martin Luther started to push back create a force that took on the Catholic church can you imagine terrorism the Catholic Church back in the 1500s this was the dominating Force I'd say you're almost insane to try and go against them but he didn't even know yeah look around this is crazy this isn't what it says in the scripture the people don't have the scriptures they need to be able to read the scriptures this is false Doctrine and God gave him the ability to translate [Music] put it into the word into German you get it in English [Applause] to push back is the power of Darkness listen to this brother Brown says how could men do anything else I want you to catch this how could men do anything else besides the power of that God has released to them catch that young people how can you do anything else how are you how can you do anything but do exactly what God's power has released you to do you have a choice something drove him whether he knew it or not [Applause] [Applause] let loose the powers that let loose he said the anointing and they couldn't do nothing again he said the church responded amen amen the church responded to the power that was released in our age amen Amina as we try and close here Satan with the ultimate frustration he says all right there's only one thing I can do Cola but it'll be my best the Reformation had ended had produced many harlots and denominations and Satan says I got one final power this will be the final blows and so he goes back to the stable and he pulls out not Jayo he's Pale Horse and while I say yeah he walks around that he says I saved my best to last he admiring the power yay of death that's what it was where are you he said this is my final charger and I'm going to Laden it with any every ornament of darkness and fear [Music] I got one final ride he puts his leg over on the saddle [Music] are you ready foreign [Music] [Applause] you know there's nothing more fearful to man than death someone that doesn't have Christ death is very fearful the culmination of all of his beasts all of his powers and he's injected his corruptness into the churches now there's a lacks of living there's a falling away because the life is gone because death is so death now is tearing to the land see but once again every time Satan underestimates he is combating yeah because God said all right you have death already I send out the Lion Man to maintain I sent her the power of a man too but I've got a different Power those were all Earthbound powers [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] what
