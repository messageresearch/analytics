seated this evening I would like to speak to you on a subject this is our time our Jubilee amen I believe we are in the Year of Jubilee amen that every captive can go free Jesus would take the scripture and he would begin to read it and he would lay it down and he would say this day the scripture is fulfilled the prophet said he was giving forth a warning of the coming forth of the great gusher of Pentecost to set at Liberty anyone that was a slave to sin amen anyone that was bound could go free and we know the Jubilee Year God told told the Israelites he said I want to I want you to remember that one time you were slaves and I came down and freed you and I want to make a day that at the sounding of the trumpet every slave no matter how long he's been a Slave slave he is at Liberty to return to his family he can return to his lands and be free of every debt for it is a time of Liberty and every slave when he heard that Jubilee sound maybe he was Ro a ho in a row of tomatoes he could throw that hoe down and he could look at them at his slave master and he could say I am a free man I couldn't do nothing on my own but I have heard the trumpet sound and I believe that what the voices said and I don't have to hold one more roow brother R said we were also slaves to sin we were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we came into this world speaking lives there was nothing we could do on our own to help us our whole makeup our whole nature everything that we were is sin but then one day we heard the Jubilee Trum told us that we could be free amen the trumpet is the gospel it is the good news you are no longer bound you no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free all debts are paid Hallelujah all debts are paid amen he came down and he took my place and He Paid a Debt a debt that I ow when I couldn't pay it on my own he came down and struck it all off and he said you are free hallelujah hallelujah the prophet talks about the Emancipation Proclamation it was a proclamation that the slaves who were Bound in slavery would go free they had been whipped and they had been beat they had been slaves but they said on this morning when the Sun rises you will be a free man amen those poor decrepid heart beaten slaves they were so anxious to be free till the strongest of them would climb to the top of the hill amen and they would begin to holler down as the sun come up as they saw it break Taking Over the Horizon they begin to scream from the top we are free and the next one holler down we are free we are free the Sun is up they can let the pressure off amen they can scream and they can shout to the top of their voices why because they were free that was the Su in but now is the now is the s o in Hallelujah the o n is up he is

it is your turn to experience all things are possible amen the word is a trumpet ounding in power and demonstration Amen brother BR was say it like this he said I believe that the age has come now how many can say now the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit Power and signs and wonders this great poing of God's spirit in this last day that'll be the thing that brings faith into the people for it'll take us into Glory that is what has been released in this age it is the power of the Holy Ghost it is the power of the Holy Ghost the same as it was on the day of pente Hallelujah we have the phenomenal the miraculous comes with us amen the baptism of the holy spirit is released again as it was on the day of Pentecost and when it was released it poured out signs it poured out wonders it poured out the miraculous hallelujah hallelujah in every Exodus we are in the Third Exodus amen I believe that you believe that Amen in the first Exodus it was accompanied by a pillar of fire amen it came by sound the voice of a prophet amen come on is that true amen amen all the way down every Exodus has the same thing a prophet a pillar of fire the power of God listen this ain't a weak religion we got it is a light that has guided the people of God all the way from the first Exodus through the second Exodus that Pillar of Fire is here among us even tonight hallelujah hallelujah and he comes with a message it is a message of Freedom let my people go [Applause] I'm here to tell that devil that had you bound let them go let them go you can't hold them no longer they wasn't your slaves they never belong to you but they belong to God let my people go you are free people [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you say well I like it where it's not quite so noisy I like it where it's not quite so noisy come to the wrong place [Music] [Applause] because I heard my Prophet say wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise Hallelujah he inhabits the Praises of his people you know people want to use quotes against the the worship and use quotes against the motion they'll take a few quotes and stack it and they'll they'll just do away with all the rest of it I can tell you how your Prophet acted in church he said I came to myself out in the middle of the floor with my pants leg pulled up yeah just like this he said I came to myself out in the middle of the floor with my pants legs up speaking in other tongues there's pictures of your Prophet sitting on a pit swinging his legs off amen I understand I I I I'm getting into some stuff I didn't mean to get into amen I understand there's a lot of wild fire a lot of wild fire amen but there's real fire amen the rain falls on the just and the unjust well I saw somebody shout that I know they don't live it the rain falls on the just and the unjust it's not something wrong with the r there's no seed to bring to life but if there happens to be a seed on the inside and the spirit begins to fall down it's it's a deep that calleth into the deep there's a deep to respond say yes Lord that's me Mama I heard my name I heard God Speak and he called my name the holy spirit is still leading the church hallelujah hallelujah it's the supernatural working in the Supernatural people God fulfilling his word and backing it up by the miraculous you say well brother have the word wonderful but you will not you cannot separate the word from the miraculous where the word is where he is the miraculous is always present in this generation under the greatest word that's ever hid the face of the Earth it was followed by the miraculous amen but the Antichrist Spirit he wants to put the he wants to put the miraculous of the supernatural in a day gone by you know they're saying this is not the day of Miracles that's the devil at work he can't talk us out of what God can do but just tries to tell you he don't do it now but this is the time for the phenomenal miraculous amen the third pole was nothing but the miraculous dead fish came to life squirrels were created storms were spoke out of existence tumors were spoke out of existence rebellious boys were giv lies am let me let me here tell you what the prophet said he said the day of Miracle is not p as says the theologians if the day of Miracles is passed the day of God is passed Hallelujah God is a miracle you say when they say the days of Miracles are passed he said when the day of Miracles passed the day of God is passed certainly the days of Miracles will never be passed hallelu never was and never will be when God told Moses I'll send an angel before you to keep you in the way and bring you into a place that I have prepared hallelujah hallelujah to bring you into a place that I have prepared sorry that angel was Christ it was the angel of the Covenant but still many people didn't believe it there's still people today that don't believe it but the men who rejected the light they went into a total darkness and he said I believe today those who reject the Holy Spirit In The Light Of God the days of Miracles and so forth you will go back into total darkness you see Pharaoh's heart how dark it it got so dark and so hard he said listen what am I trying to say to you that God who came out and led the Church of God out of Egypt from bondage into Freedom has come down again in the same manner to lead the church spiritual out of the bondage of sin first by the Holy Spirit sickness next and the third step is to go into Glory take this Mortal and make it immortality but God called an exodus it was a separating time God was making ready to fulfill his Divine word he had given to Abraham he had made a promise to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob hundreds of years had passed but God never forgets a promise in the season in the time God will bring it to pass you can rest assur that what God has promised God will fulfill it might look impossible it might be years since he said but God said it his word will be fulfilled it will come to pass and here they are Moses now on the back side of a desert tending some sheep and one morning he gets up and he looks on the side of a hill man I need to wipe my eyes I see a bush up there it's on fire but it's not burning I want to go back I want to go see what this is all about and he goes to the bush and then out of the Bush comes a a voice and it knew Moses it didn't call him Timothy or bus or David it said Moses Moses take off your shoes for you're standing on Holy Ground and we know the story he said I've come down I've heard the Cry of my people I've heard their oppression I've heard their cry and I have come down to deliver them he does it in the same manner I've heard their cry and I have come down to deliver he heard your cry when you thought you was nothing but a worthless nobody you said nobody cares nobody understands but God heard you and he's come down to deliver you and to break that chain off your neck I'm going bring my people out so here Moses had tried on his own abilities he had heard you know of the uh he' been taught all of his life who he was that he was to be a deliverer of God's people so he tried he killed an Egyptian but now he's not going on his own let's look at Moses now he's got a a donkey a wife a child where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to take overall what Moses you you you understand the Egyptians is the greatest army there's ever been where's your army at Moses what do you got Moses well I got a rod but what they failed to see was the pillar of fire that that was above him Moses wasn't going to Egypt on his own he was going under the power of the pillar of fire hallelujah hallelujah I pray that'll be you this weekend when you go back to your job you go back to your schools you go back to your hes you won't be going on your own but you'll be going under the power of the pillar of fire Hallelujah that power to lead you and guide you into a body change you might have tried on your own before you might have tried and failed but under the power of this God you'll never fail Hallelujah there is a power I'm telling you there is a power that's greater than any drugs greater than any pornography greater than any fornication greater than anything the devil can try to put on you there's a pillar of fire that's swirling in this building right now and he said I have come down to tell pharaoh to tell that devil let my people go this is your time this is your Jubilee this is your moment for freedom you know he said what has happened today he said because our churches have become intellectual and we get smart ministers they don't have no use for the holy spirit in the way that it was back there it's something we don't need today it's the days that's passed we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the SI we've got doctors now we don't need the Holy Spirit we are all intelligent people he said when you do that you take the lifeline out of the body amen amen hallelujah hallelujah a church that feels it don't need the Holy Spirit man will stand up and give you an intellectual talk didn't Jesus say he would to see the very elected if it was possible intellectual talks will be so smooth it would deceive the people it's the men who can handle that word in such a way they're but they're trusting in their intellectuals and they condemn the holy spirit this is where we're at we've got people that say we don't need it no more with the perfect word has come we don't need shout we don't need dancing we don't need none of that no more the perfect word has come so the part is done away with what that simply means is the whole word has come so just having a part is done away with now we have all of it amen so I want all that's in the word amen as brother Bram said Divine Healing is in the Bible he said I can show you where God put it in you show me where he put it out amen I will say shouting is in the Bible dancing is in the Bible speaking in tongues is in the Bible well what about that quote brother Timothy of bubble dancing well you got to realize what brother Brandon was dealing with he was speaking to people he wanted to shout they wanted to dance they wanted to gift but they didn't want the giver they didn't want the word I want to tell everybody we are not word rejectors no sir we are not word rejectors therefore when I hear the word I say Amen to the word and that word Call My Name hallelujah hallelujah I saw my name written in the book amen what did John say in Revelations chapter 5 he said when the book was open and he said I saw my name written there he said all the things in the heavens all the things in the earth everything under the Earth heard I John shouted why because it wasn't no more somebody else's gospel it was now his gospel amen this is what we want to get across to you this week this Holy Spirit this Pillar of Fire it's not just to coming preachers hallelujah it's not just to be in song leaders or deacons but it's to be in young ladies and young men that'll carry this gospel that'll tell the devil where he belongs amen hallelujah this young lady in our church she's a very timid type person she's very timid very quiet she's not very emotional I guess you would say but she desired that God would just move in her heart and God's used me many times to speak to her about different things she came to our prayer line there last last year and I just begin to tell her this is your moment this is your time receive it right now in the name of Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Lord hid her she didn't even go through the rest of the prayer line she just begin to dance and Sh all the way out you know what she told me brother bus she said I found out the best dance floor the best dance floor is the devil's head theil's hallelujah amen hallelujah the best place to give God praise is standing on top of your enemy when you realize he don't hold me no more his power over me is overwhelm I don't have to be bound to that no more i'me I'm free I'm delivered hallelujah hallelujah amen they brought in that first Exodus they came out of Egypt in with a mighty hand and God had a plan he said I'm going to take him by this way and I'm g go this way and I'm going go that way it's not going to be necessarily the best route God's got his own GPS GPS he said because I want pharaoh to look at this man they're lost they're lost they don't even know where they're going he said because I want pharaoh to come and I want to bring him down here and here they are just rejoicing going out of Egypt victory is mine Victory is m today is Moses what is that what is this water here we can't we where's your boat there ain't enough boats for all of us how are we going to get AC cross Moses were there not any Graves that we would die in Egypt all of a sudden out of this ear over here out of this ear over here they hear a sound of horses coming who is that coming in a big cloud of dust and here's Pharaoh

use what's in your hand Moses raise up that Rod of Fai speak and go forward and the Red Sea open he said I'm going to do something for you today the Egyptians you see today you'll see no more forever hallu Hallelujah they go across on dry land and they get on the other side and he said Moses hold up your Rodz dumb Old Devil he thinks he can use that same path but God allowed him to just bring them all in and the waters covered over there there was a young lady by the name of maram all of a sudden she got a glimpse now you can read it in your Bible he said you the Egyptians you see the to day you'll see no more forever a few verses down they saw them floating in the Red Sea but they weren the same Egyptians they no longer had to power to pick up a whip they no longer could tell him to make one more brick they no longer had the power to command them to do anything they had lost their power Hallelujah huj I believe we're right at that same moment right now there's demons that's losing their power right now they're losing their power of sin they're losing their power of sickness they're losing their power of unbelief and all of a sudden Mary saw that one that had made her make bricks that had beat her on on her back she saw him floating she couldn't handle it no more she began to grab a tamine and dance all over the place why cuz God God had destroyed her enemy [Applause]

is your moment this is your you got just a moment let you have your seats just a second I'll just tell you a personal testimony for a moment I came here 30 years ago come to Kenya and Uganda actually Uganda I was about 18y old boy and uh you know just a I was born in a message home my my my dad's one of the one of the elders in the message great Min but I had to have more than [Music] that but when I came here it sparked Something In My Heart and I and I began to search and look I had pushed all thoughts of ever being a preacher out I don't understand anybody that wants to be a preacher I'm sorry I don't understand you it was not me I didn't want it I'd have been a preacher's kid I've been under the microscope I didn't want none of that but God has other plans and he knows how to get you where he want you went through a lot of nose in the dirt you know he'll drag you if he has to he'll drag you if he has to nose all in your mouth and your teeth your dirt's all in there dirt's all in your mouth teeth but he'll get you there and he got me there and about 2,000 I gave myself to him for the service of the Lord been preaching ever since but you know there was a lot of complexes I faced a lot of things that I you know people would say or whatever you know people would still make the statement well he's a preacher because he don't want to work I don't understand that either it was a lot easier on the job I had but you know you you all these things begin to build up complexes and things so God would lead me even more into full-time Ministry I've been in full-time Ministry now since about 09 2010 so I yeah so I I um know still you'd go through things resentment because you you know towards the Lord because you didn't want this you know resentment towards the Lord because you didn't want this you know anytime a hard time would come say well I I don't want how I didn't want it anyway you know so go through a lot of complexes and brother you know uh I I would always try to do something on my own to make a some extra money and uh so I would do various little jobs and what have you and so I uh just just case you don't know you don't get rich preaching I'm doing this on purpose so just bear with me but I was looking to maybe go into business again so I went to visit brother Ron Spencer's Church brother Ron's A Gifted Man Of God I went to his house for a dinner and things never mentioned one time about going into business that night we would go to oh yeah I I I I um I didn't mention one thing about it so we went to church that night brother Ron came up to me he say going to be a great weekend especially for you I thought oh wow maybe God's got a word go into business you know and so we go up on the mountain the next day and we're up there and he he pulls me aside he said Timothy you was at my house yesterday he said I went to go take a nap after you left lay down he said the Lord told me to get up and go to my office and I sat down at my office and I begin to think about things and the voice of God begin to speak and says don't you tell Timothy don't go into business but he is my servant and I will take care of him and I saw God do miraculous things take care of bills and things I couldn't and and so uh few we few few years later it was actually the first of last year 2023 my wife came down sick and we had a lot of hospital bills and things a lot of other bills that were coming on and I was in my office crying out to the Lord and I was saying God I need you help me to stay in your will I can't do this on my own it looks impossible I I can't do it but I know you can and I'm weeping and I'm crying out with my heart this is on a Sunday afternoon after I after I led the songs at church the next morning my wife would go to the mailbox she would open up the mailbox pull out a few letters she bring me a letter said this is for you and I would open up brother bus it wasn't just enough it was more than enough in that moment I was preaching on it's your season it's your time it's your moment you know and I got to realize a little bit later that the male had not even run on Monday yet it was actually in the mailbox on Saturday or even Friday and here on Sunday I'm crying out to God asking him to take care of the need and he's saying hey bud go to the mailbox I've already provided I've already given it to you it's already there it's already there and I've come this evening there is a mailbox for you tonight you've been crying out to God he's heard you all week he's heard you last night he heard you yesterday and he's telling you it's already there go to the mailbox I have already provided it is yours it is yours this God is still doing the miraculous he's still doing signs of Wonders about seven years ago my mom would have her first brain bleed she couldn't she couldn't see out of her peripheral and so she was left almost blind very weaken condition but as we stood there at the hospital room the doctors were saying surgery and things we gathered around as a family those that could be there and we begin we was going to pray before we left because we couldn't stay with her she was in the ICU and as we begin to go to prayer out of my my father's mouth came these words she'll be in the ICU room tonight tomorrow night she'll be in a regular room and the next night she'll be home that's exactly what happened she came home and here here She is though in this broken condition and my youngest sister was living with her at the time and she came in to check on her she was sitting on her bed side in a very depressed condition now my sister has this has this little boy his name is Drew he was 18 months old he had never walked he had never crawled doctor said he had an undeveloped HP she sets Drew in the middle of the floor and she goes over to check on my mom and she begins to talk to her and all of a sudden the spirit of God began to move and those hands went up and she be to praise God and thank him for all that he had done and in the moment that the spirit of God came to that room her sight came back it went over her it went over to where little Drew was in the middle of the floor here's this little boy that had never walked or never crossed he stood up to his feet and he began to run all over the house that's our God that's our God Hallelujah there was a young sister

be here once again early in the morning for just one more day of his presence we'll be here by 6:30 and our precious brother morus from Ethiopia will be speaking to [Music] us I just I just introduced to you my pastor he's no longer now my pastor in the sense that I'm not in his local [Music] congregation brother is my best interpreter but today he's got it all wrong I don't remember what I said what did I say is no longer my pastor in the sense that I am no longer in his local congregation but once he was my pastor once he is my pastor he's my pastor forever for he begot me the gospel and that's how it that's how it works and Pastor morus I not only uh pastored him but I fathered him in this message and I'm very proud of him because he's a main pillar in Ethiopia is a is a man who had a an ambition in politics but that moment when it came to him he came to me and said these words I've decided to quit politics and I'm going to serve the Lord I never asked him to do that God vised here and God he has a lot of ability a very intelligent man he passed very well did a degree in law but when this message came to him it turned him around and I'm saying this specifically because you're going to hear him tomorrow and you will know the power of this message this message that we talking to you about is not a man's idea it's not a man's knowledge it's not even quot it's a life changer when God met me turned me around at one place I wanted to be a movie actor go turn me around he made a preacher out of me pray this message is real that's the reason we are preparing this bring anointed ministers to let you experience the power of this message you may sit down in your local church and think it's just ques it's a power if can yield yourself it will turn you around some of you are going on a wrong path of life but these meetings have the potential of changing your destiny forever and I believe this is what was happening in this Mee and brother morus is one of those like me like brother you had his testimony that this message has worked on and is standing in in a country that has spiritual femine the church is pastoring is the very first church in the country of Ethiopia Ethiopia the country has more than 120 million people and after you hear him preach then tell me if this message has no power it's not about me this has nothing to do with me it has nothing to do about the Timothy any of these P we are presenting to you a lifechanging message that's what we want to be seing we want that to be seen God knows that's the burden of my heart God bless each of you and strengthen youen your strength come back here early morning and let us hear from the man of and uh we will have another service after the devotion Sunday main morning service and our brother David mayor will speak again to us and then we shall have a second service our brother Timothy we and then we will have the last service now that will not be here we are preparing to have it at the uh at the fireplace and uh it will be a testimony Serv whatever God has done for you in this meeting don't be shy to testify about it and that's what that meeting by the fireplace will be just talk about it freely and give a testimony and it will bless very many there's a sister who sent me a testimony of how she receive the Holy Ghost sister if you want to you know yourself if you want to testify
