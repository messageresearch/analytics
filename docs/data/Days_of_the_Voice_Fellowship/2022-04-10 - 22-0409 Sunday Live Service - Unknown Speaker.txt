hallelujah hallelujah i'd like to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ my name is the different ones [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] remember when we started to do this it was with a few people about uh i don't remember the number that was in that meeting at my house meeting your customers but it was about uh probably 10 or 15. and we we agreed that we would start uh we would not rent another place we agreed instead of paying more money out there we can just collect that money and we use it to buy our lives and recently i told you that i'm believing the lord that by the end of this year this year uh 2022. believing that at least our first service of next year we should have it in our language what is it impossible with men is possible even if we get half the money or at least some uh fraction i'm sure that someone we can find someone willing to let us feel the ship in their place i'd rather take the land and then begin to use it while we clear it [Music] [Music] uh and so this uh month this sunday i have new names sunday ninayo amanyama i know that people who are contributing in the offering bag every sunday like you just did a few a while ago my name is um and also there are there are certain people that gave or have been giving towards uh the project of building the offices of days of the voice publication what would happen just bring it together but we mark it down on the sheets your sister docus i also contributed this past weekend and so i told you that how many remember how much we had last sunday in a sunday he's sick how many remember how much we had last summer sunday is the [Music] [Music] 11.3 [Music] and so today i'm happy to announce to you that we have 14 million even less than a million to make 15 million for this amount of efforts [Music] we are going to look to the lord to provide to us and those of you who are visiting with us hallelujah i mean hey man i think we'll just now stand and go to the scriptures [Music] when i was born again [Applause] [Music] when i was born again oh glad that when i was born again [Applause] [Music] it was a glad day when i was born again who know the things i used to do i do them no more oh things i used to do i all the things i used to do i do them no more it was a glad day when i was now [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah even we're taking john 20 [Music] and we'll read another script [Music] yeah sorry i did not recognize you in the beginning god bless you i'm happy we're happy to have you so we have many pastors with us hallelujah amen amen so you know when you have other preachers other ministers in the church try to be careful you have to be careful all right we're reading verse 21 then say jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so sender you and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive you the holy ghost is [Applause] if you do not have the holy spirit my prayer is that in this service you will receive the holy spirit we come before you this morning tuesday jordy and charity humility before your throne we ask that this day will be such a special day in our lives lord i know without a doubt there is someone here who desperately needs you to another woman [Music] may we recognize we need another time i need another time even as i'm speaking these words lord as you will bring them through my lips i pray that you will give me another task lord may the words come by inspiration and may they be received lord by inspiration may it not be a normal church service [Music] may be a service where your presence will just come and engage someone here you're not looking for a great emotional experience we are looking for a transforming power what would like to know your manager you just come and engulf our souls today on a new course got to take care of it and give us a reason to live in this world that when may you give us a good atmosphere welcome at 20 million we amen this morning i'm speaking on part 10 of receiving the holy ghost i'm a jacob amen man i want it to be expected yeah and this morning um we will dwell we read this john 20 but really i will dwell on luke 15. my subtitle which is really what i'm going on today is restore restoring the relationships and we have looked at many different dimensions of this same subject of the holy spirit we have looked at many dimensions of the subject of the holy spirit oh you have you have heard the word you have received the holy ghost you see they say that the word of god is a full package some scriptures like the one where jesus says that my word which you have had is spirit and his life so now they were comforted to believe that when you receive and believe the word you don't need to seek for the holy ghost because you have already received the holy ghost but they found out that the bible says in the book of acts 19. did you receive the holy ghost so which means you can receive the word and we talked about the old testament into that one the holy spirit is the life of god himself the holy spirit is something that restores us to the lost relationship with god it begins by accepting all the words not part of the world you know and we found the importance of revelation i saw that the children of israel had lambs but their egyptians did not have the prophet what would have a mystery tabari he was not looking for people coming from this tribal that drive us from that church or from that church [Music] but you see that these people they had the flesh the whole time today was a rejoicing because it brings stimulation you know let me tell you if you want to know someone is happy but when you're kind of in trouble for truly someone can really be happy give them food you will never you you look at all the pictures taken when people are eating amen and in this case we are talking about the world talking about gambling that's why we get so happy and free to say no to everybody that's why we get excited when we hear the word must excite you if you're a true child of god [Laughter] it is the word that moves because this blood will be a talking unto your [Music] amen what hallelujah [Applause] which i think is the outstanding subject of today what is the holy spirit another reason i have taken these three uh these subjects in line like this is because you cannot come and receive the holy ghost unless you know what it is [Music] unless you [Music] so if you know what if you know what it remember that we were born in the image of god what do you create what's that what's funny no no no no let me put it this way in the image of god twice before the fall here i'm not talking about supplements [Music] so now man was born in a foreign but when man fell from [Applause] [Music] [Applause] only [Music] you thought if you'll get this money you will be satisfied there was a single funeral saying to get material and you were not they were mature you thought if you look at the house what was that what if you knew me you would be satisfied and you were not you thought if you get a girlfriend or a boyfriend some of you thought if you come to church you'll be satisfied since i was in secondary school and i believe the lord the holy spirit is really working on him now at the time i would really want you to pray for him yeah i was wondering because [Applause] jesus is not something you can try yes you sit into your presence sir we did not come here to try him the truth is yes we come here because we are sure the rest is sufficient remedy for the soul of the heart and the spiritual sickness quickly became a physical sickness oh it's wrecked on you a sickness of the soul and it translated into sicknesses of the body that's why when he received the holy ghost over the devil in your body we are given the power and authority to wherever you know what he is to speak life to the things to speak healing to the sins because if we have received transformation never through our life we can speak healing i believe for healing because divine healing that there is something is the full full restoration of the souls [Music] the fully restored relations [Applause] all the preliminaries is all leading up to this this is you know you see he's preparing us to take a taker all the justification we receive sanctification it is leading up to this little prayer and it is unfortunate that many people don't reach this level of receiving the holocaust um it is sad i slept past three a.m last night never was [Music] how much willingness that today will be your day of receiving the true full restoration of your relationship with jesus i wanted to look at these scriptures in luke 15 brother give it to me on the screen luke 15 11. and he said a certain man had two sons at the arena father give me the portion of goods that falls to me i went in to one day and he divided unto them he's living and not many days after the youngest son gathered all together um there wasted his substance with rayotas [Music] he wasted his inheritance over chicago he put the name of his father to shame yes he never was bothered because he saw the recent church he had new priorities his dream was different his desire was different his purpose was different from that of his father but yet his father never wanted him to be a religious man you may ask me who is this when we have already rejected our true nature but he had our father in heaven always long for true and full restoration [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know you have read this scripture many times but i wanted to look at it differently today questioning this is and he would feign and fill his belly with the husks of that twine that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bred enough and despair and i perish with hunger supply and i will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way of his father saw him and i had compassion and rain and fell on his neck and kissed him father it's not changed it is still the same way today this is an announcement to you who are listening and in this site and i'm no it and bring heath of the fatted car from the killing and let us eat and be married for this my son was dead and he's alive again he was lost and is found in [Music] you are lost amen the love of his father the moment his father approved of him the moment they received the holy ghost as we shall see later the father said how do you become a member that doesn't make you a everywhere the accommodation food and members dresses and scars does not make you a man of the body of christ [Music] walking and dressing and talking and acting good doesn't make you a member either okay it's by one spirit by one now it [Music] is amen we have seen people believe this message husbands around me they are an adulterer you find them in committing adultery with girls that would be like their daughter or sangha there is no power to make them stay in the grace of god i was telling you the other day does not does not protect us from temptation we will be tempted to jack him everyone but what does the other guys do will help us i get three hours and fall to the next one temptation which you came over amen so these men and women have accepted another question received a message for twenty thirty forty years the relationship [Music] [Music] how many times [Applause] you oh [Applause] [Applause] and as long as you have something to offer them the moment you can you have nothing to offer the world you realize that you project it again praise the name of the lord let them come and give us the word we were listening to someone who said that uh uh you know i'm not in two projects but someone said that this last speaker [Music] do you think you are different brothers you think the friends you have hey my channel jordina really love you mother and your father you really think your brother loves you more than god i will tell you the ugly truth in this world everyone loves you if you have something to offer them and as long as you [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] until all this money finishes it wow and they told him please please excuse me the one who was calling him sweetheart excuse me who are you how can i help you yeah i would then who is that bishop or pastor or church that thinks they are something you can change and always nation when jesus realized without the father he is born the bible says he came to himself at that time he was feeding the swine because and he was eating the food that the pigs i was born like this how can i overcome this fan wouldn't change stay in me i just have to live my life can't be very after all i will die what can i hinder i cannot hinder myself from myself what can i do encourage eating eating is bread of sorrows one now how can i leave katakana there's nothing to do what is your question i'm stuck here i'm just stuck here see nowhere i wanna know when you might make the world be so diving seek the kingdom of god let me amen i remember when i was just married nine years ago i want to walk with my wife on the road that's the road and good day we would walk four kilometers to church one way kilometers and that is eight kilometers that is a kilometer in one day and we leave church when we are very hungry [Applause] and so [Applause] child my mother used to take me to conversions of believers i used to see what my parents were doing and i was doing it i could never see in any because of you know then she felt good now what are you ever doing i'm straightened now you made it everywhere so i heard a hand coming to work three point five kilometers i don't remember three kilometers hallelujah [Applause] is but what happens to us here oh that's where we're i won't be the only one i know the other preachers are doing their life season's a country the lord gave me a vision of the message player could they laughed i've sold those players for something close to eight years now with the revelation i've been buying i already know we don't need to look to the east or to the west we need to have a purpose driven life this message [Music] amen you will have lived for a right purpose again in this life you're leaving it behind your neighbor but what i'm speaking about today is like it the devil even among the message believers sit down they try to quiet the people don't let and being on another level no way that i could dial it down what's the difference between me this message is not to strike us into another baptism this message is supposed to take us into an experience someone told me you see that message is not only restoring what is in genesis [Music] has been restored church those ones in the tent tell hallelujah praise the name of the lord come here give me a little more time here now pay your debts [Music] this young man i can't help to but talk a little more about him and he came to his father i reached out he was just there in scene he [Applause] why do i go to hell with my eyes open there's a friend of mine for a second the ones i was calling baby the ones who are calling me sweetie have all forsaken me [Music] i charity hallelujah amen but he had not received the holy ghost you have to hear the word you receive revelation but that is not the holy ghost yet whoa hallelujah he is more willing to give you the holy ghost than you are willing [Music] [Applause] is that did not walk their tumbler he did not wait for himself today but he raised he had to come here [Applause] hallelujah amen and he went to his second day hallelujah amen hallelujah your father daughter jesus christ yes christian
