[Music] I'd like to appreciate Brother Martin for making the time despite the challenge of the rain this morning I'm an appreciate Brother Martin here we appreciate you Brother Martin and your family you are blessing to the body of Christ amen Amina we are taking uh John chapter 1 verse one is in this service today I'd like you to really um put on like brother Barnum would say your spiritual thinking okay um in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God is that a man should now I would like all of us to read verse 14 together and the Word was made manifest and let us read it again and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so the word was made flesh is so in the beginning was God the word was so what is the word God is the one and verse 14 says and the word was made flesh so remember what is the word now I want you to to to to to read it that way and God katonda was made flesh so in other words Jesus yes was not some other man that came out of nowhere it was the word which was in the beginning with God and now was made fleshura so I'm going to speak to you on the subject of the unrecognized Christ on Wednesday brother brother Andrew spoke on recognizing your promises and so the word recognizing is coming again to us today even Jesus was before the birth of Jesus the Jews knew the prophecies about his birth the Jews believed in the Messiah the Jews believe the Messiah would be born and when the Messiah would come he would have several characteristics so they believed in the messiah's coming stay hard and believed the prophecies one of the prophets and that is Isaiah in the book of Isaiah chapter 61 and you can turn it there today we are going to read quite a lot of scriptures so if you have your pain and and Bible you can knock those things down and and then go back to it after correctness in verse 1 of 61 of Isaiah the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has set me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound tomorrow [Music] is now this prophecy was given by prophet Isaiah before the New Testament that the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the Good Tidings and this prophecy was speaking on the coming of Jesus who would have the spirit of God upon him area would actually bind the we would actually bring Good Tidings to the makeup he would bind the Brokenhearted Proclaim everybody to the captives this was the ministry of the Messiah if you understand that say Amen now in Isaiah is I want you to look at that prophecy again praise the name of the Lord For unto us a child is born and to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the vasting Father the Prince of Peace now this prophecy was also given by Isaiah speaking on the coming of the Messiah [Music] are you following me you really have to say Amen in this service because if you don't you will does I can assure you know because you need to really put on your spiritual thinking as a child is born and to us a son is given oh man who was this son this was the Messiah that was for to come [Music] he says his name would be called wonderful the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace praise the name of Lord now I want you to follow this the Jews had this script the Jews believe in the description the Jews followed they read it every time in their synagogues but when the time for Jesus to be born came they never recognized him they did not even understand Jesus was the Messiah do you know why they didn't understand that brother somewhere because the Messiah was supposed to be nothing less than God knew the Messiah had to be God you know as I will show you in the Bible in the Book of John Jesus told them the Jews that he was a Son of God yes and they wanted to stun him immediately do you know the reason they gave him um he told them he was the son of God but they claimed he said he was God because they knew to be a Son of God it meant you had to be God himself are you following me this morning they read this scripture in their temples synagogues for years and years and on the day when Jesus was born they did not understand that the Messiah was born as a matter of fact only a few understood was one of them was one of them you know and we also find that the the Shepherds you know these were people who were despised the lowest of the people they are the ones who understood and recognized the birth of [Music] you see that this waste man anybody never said that again because of a nice day they realize that the Stars was leading them to the Messiah and they followed that stuff until they reached and they worship the king never recognized the priest the religious man never understood now if if those great people of that time did not recognize Christ [Music] I want to ask you a question do you think they will recognize Christ today the religious men are said there are not the Bishops back upon the mighty powerful the theologians you don't recognize Christ that way Christ reveals himself to babies such as can learn are you a baby so you can be able to recognize Christ now we need to understand that the Word was God to take it into it so God was made flesh this is the most powerful Revelation in the Bible hallelujah amen even Jesus himself he said he's going to build his church on the revelation of Christ because Jesus one day asked his disciple foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign in the beginning was the what foreign [Music] God became man too that you might become him I want to go for okay Hallelujah [Music] now turn to your Bible in the Book of John chapter four because verses 24. God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is the name of the Lord God is the spirit moyo is like water what is this chichino must how many water amazing one water okay we will find out how many it is okay how many disagree it's all right it's okay to disagree okay do you see this is what is happening that confusion it is how many water is this if this is how many water is this do you see the confusion the other one will even come and you know they will come and with red face yes and he will say no don't you have knowledge in your head don't take it that way this is one water two water it is there is two yeah when you said the studio you're right but what you said is true water you are wrong because the water is but also that water which is not one like your finger is that right it is more than one but not foreign it can be in this mother today guys and in another kind of bottle the bottles may be so many babies but you cannot say it is one water but you can say it's the same water yes and because it's the same word that's where the word Oneness comes it is it can be in many places at the same time in Uganda as a matter of fact that water is in you and it is the same word where that water is and that is how the spirit is the Bible says God is a spirit you cannot count the spirit the spirit is in heaven it's in America but how many is it same experience Hallelujah if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead yes [Music] [Music] it's not a different spirit it's the same same Spirit one day he came in a field of clouds one day you came and he says but he is foreign and then another one says divided in three parts so is one divided in three parts so what about God the father in which form is confusion is the same God who manifested himself in three different forms the Greek word is God changing his form God manifesting himself and you can never count him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now foreign foreign [Music] [Music] each of them is each of them is a is a is the spirit but each of them is not the other one Buddhism each of them is conduction foreign [Music] foreign so there is something that you need to understand so the Oneness teaching is wrong and that's why they go ahead to baptize in the name of Jesus they actually they call them Jesus only people yes we don't believe that to kill us and I find that many Believers of this message actually don't understand that they get mixed up there now our Prophet is telling us here but the trinidadians mixed it up and the Oneness people also mix it up I said God is not one like a finger is one cartoon those two groups got it mixed up I'm always you can't make it either way you put for me these quotes here this is a very sensitive subject now he says he was God manifested in a flesh of his creative foreign foreign [Music] [Music] he created everything all right now I want you to go to uh-huh First Corinthians chapter 15. foreign these are all very wonderful nuggets but okay let's continue but every man in his own order verse 23 Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ is at his coming then cometh the end when shall when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all Rule and all authority and power for he Jesus must Reign till so that is an end to his reigning till he has put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he has put all things under his feet but when he shall have all things uh when he shall when he says all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him that is in Christ Jesus and when all things shall be subdued unto him the then shall discern also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all ah [Music] Christ is [Music] [Music] God is on do you know him was created foreign if they're going to be banned foreign [Music] with a great noise foreign foreign people now I mean and I have the Catholic people here the the book called the thoughts of our faith and they use the word of Eternal sonship of God backwards [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he has now come back in the form of the Holy Spirit that's why the name of Jesus must still be used without the name of Jesus [Music] Hallelujah [Music] he divided himself and he went in different places but in Christ he was there yeah he walked in his foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord the Bible says that he was the fullness of God had bought it again does it mean heaven was empty God was still in heaven but God was in Jesus Christ in his fullness let me ask you a question to you who I hear can't understand that was Jesus God in the pill of Fire foreign [Music] all right okay so he's got the pill of Fire what about the crowd was it God yeah now you're thinking that's very nice this is the truth now God katonda is a spirit he's not anything visible but the spirit manifests himself invisible thing moving the visible things can pass away big wow but that God invisible but remains and he continues manifest himself now God the spirit came down in the field of fire came down in a body yeah foreign [Music] [Music] but when God was born in a man from that day and that name is Jesus yes to Jehovah means God our Salvation Jesus yes it means god ourselves but in the dispensation when it completes the son of David Ministries [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] created by these great Fountains of Purity and it created the logos it was in the form of what we we are now guadali movies it's a body that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a body that's waiting for you Christians style as soon as the life leaves this you go into that body each of us is waiting for us the moment we step out of this we step into that one let me tell you somebody born again child of God [Music] hallelujah amen I cannot wait for that that's why we say this world is not our home foreign oh hallelujah hallelujah I don't know how many he have ever felt homesick you have never felt homesick you know homesick is like a sickness wherever you just want homes because there is he said I've gone to prepare our place for you a mansion for everyone it's not a mansion like this one is a body you want to prepare for us to each of us Jesus yes hallelujah amen everyone who was born in sin they bypass their body foreign [Music] all right he came in that very body yes praise the name that's why you say it whatever your guy on the way I am the truth who was Jesus he was the man of life the Bible says but the second Adam Jesus Adam he was made yeah hey I mean Jesus yes was more than a man Jesus yes was the very man the very Source of Life yes Zoe was in Jesus reconciling every child of God he was God himself [Music] he was more than a son he was more than a son [Applause] hallelujah amen oh my what a revelation is somebody that doesn't have a spirit Christians you go into that when this is my fear foreign I cannot wait for that day when we come out of this when we come out of this rotten flesh in the other flesh we don't need to shower we don't need to clean up it's a part of God hallelujah hallelujah in the message who is this Melchizedek he says he's first being Spirits he began to form himself towards the flesh foreign [Music] before he came into this flesh he did not by passive fear foreign let us read this foreign [Music] was expressed in Jesus yes how many have got that the concept of God the attribute of God himself his concept his idea his himself was expressed in Jesus for years now Jesus was the express image of the invisible God yes [Music] and the Bible says God at any time you know what next message [Music] [Music] you never knew that I'm the express image of God I want money until Rich Furniture you don't know comment in the world he said if you've seen me I mean it does not end there let you come out the godhead never ends there deflate the express image why we are so happy foreign if they can't understand Jesus they can't understand you again and if they fail to understand who Jesus was they can't even baptize in the correct way because if you fail to understand who Jesus was you failed to understand the importance of the name of Jesus but it is the name of Jesus that connects us to the locals the words that speak to you they are spirits how can they understand when they have not received the revelations amen hallelujah amen who was Jesus he was the express image of the invisible God yes who was Jesus was God himself and recognized but to as many that have recognized you know what they're going to do they will accept it in his name the water was only paying this is foreign foreign [Music] are you like me this morning Oh Glory to God it doesn't matter whether you have any haters let me tell you you have an inheritance in heaven the Bible says we are of God little children that's what the Bible says we are of God foreign Hallelujah now listen oh my you'll have to excuse me I'm gonna take you for 20 more minutes or so is that fine Church listen he says God in we're reading Hebrews one one God who was Sunday times and in diverse man has spoken times past unto the fathers by the prophets as in this last days spoken unto us by his son logos whom he has appointed here of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his coming and the express image of his pastor and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself pledged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high [Music] you know yeah you'll get it enough questions [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and the prophet says in Brackets so God has spark decided to speak to us through the world that is why today from the New Testament after the death of Jesus we try we do not listen to anybody else prophets mighty man of God must be measured by the Son of God by the logos God today is speaking to us by the logos by the word himself by the express image of his person God became expressed in the person of Jesus Christ was the express image of God yes yes again in John 1 14 and the Word was made flesh and daughters are you hearing me the very substance the very substance you have composition here there is a lot of composition I see so yeah all the composition of God praise the name of the Lord God expressed it in the passion of Jesus [Music] Christ a very substance of God was made flesh so Jesus was this bottle cut yes without the bottle you don't have the water it contained him there Kathy you cannot say s 500 meals and this is the only water that there is Mexico and there is no more water even I've covered it is foreign [Music] foreign he was a hundred percent good yes God was made flesh the great spirit of God and to which no man could approach which no man had seen or could behold he was now tabernacled in the flesh expressing the fullness of God [Music] who on occasions would manifest his presence by the cloud or by the pill of fire that struck fear in the hearts of men whose heart characteristics [Music] we are made known only by revelation of words through the prophets God With Us brother Isaac hallelujah amen God cartoon must explain away glory to God Amen
