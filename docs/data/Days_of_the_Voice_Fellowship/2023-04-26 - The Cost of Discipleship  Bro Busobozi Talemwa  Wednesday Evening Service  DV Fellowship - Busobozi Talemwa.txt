[Music] it's a little praise song so if God has done something nice for you your Bible a little bit down and then for a minute let us sing that he says Lord Lord You've surely been good to me [Music] it goes like this Lord Lord you've surely been good to me Lord Lord Lord You've surely been good to me Lord Lord You've surely been good to me you have done what no other man can do can we Now sing it together [Music] [Music] I can't hear you now [Music] amen one more time [Music] amen One Last Time everybody amen [Music] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Luke Chapter 14 verse 25. I'd like to thank you for coming for the service this evening and I would also like to encourage you not to give up on coming to for services every service we attend Brothers It prepares us and it draws Us near to the coming over as Christians we have no Victory but what uh if we don't come to church [Music] try your level best to be on time you come on time be in church is it a man how many believe together with me we shall speak more on the same but for now let us go to Luke chapter 14 verses 25. and I'm going to read after verses 33. and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yeah and his own life also he cannot be my disciple hours and come after me cannot be my disciple [Music] and the brother will read after me for which of you intending to build a tower sits not down fast and counts the coast whether he has sufficient to finish it less happily after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to be old and was not able to finish or what king going to war against another king sits not down fast and consulted whether he be able to uh with the ten thousand meet him that cometh against him with the twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way of he sent it on um ambassage and desireth conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he has he cannot be my disciple foreign Amina our good Lord we thank you for the world bless us and speak to us you know the desires of our souls I need to hear from you we surrender ourselves to you now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated God bless you like I said I'm happy to see you know that the Lord has granted us the grace to meet again today only it is by his grace [Music] amen me amen I mean enjoyed Sunday amen amen our men are going to enjoy today you know whenever I go to church I'm expecting to hear something I'm expecting Sister Martin I'm happy to see that he made it tonight so whenever I go to church I'm expecting praise the name of the Lord so let me trust that each of you is expected I ask your neighbor you expected I don't know I might continue with this on Sunday or I might just I do not know how the Lord will let us see [Music] not really on me but on what I'm saying let us hear what the spirit is telling us now the geography teacher can't understand what I'm talking about so opportunity costs opportunity cost you see is described as the cost that is foregone opportunity costs or rather what I can say is the foregone benefits that would have been derived from an option not chosen oh [Music] you understand for example if there are two choices that you are supposed to take videos and you decide to choose one of them the other one you did not choose is had benefits and you decided to foreign sometimes bring about a high opportunity cost follow me follow me just closely here I mean I've already described what opportunity cost is now we are in an economics class this evening everything he said we can't understand it if you don't understand opportunity costs and I just told you opportunity for the sake of my brother opportunity costs opportunity cost in business that would have come out of the other option that you have not taken so now I'm saying in business a good decision if a person let's say if a person makes a good decision business decisions sometimes it might make what we call losses let me give you examples if someone is employed in a company and they are paying him twenty thousand years and then he decides to leave that company and starts his own business he gets uh 10 000 profits a year so the opportunity cost is is by by within a period of time it would seem he is losing ten thousand every year that is the opportunity that's what it cost to him is the opportunity costs it seems as if he has made a loss [Music] I'm going to nail it until you understand if someone was having a job right and he's getting twenty thousand Shillings and leaves the job and starts a business is he is he okay one person here who understands the economics said yes but in reality has he made any money he is not initially he was being employed getting twenty thousand profits but now he's employing himself but only earning ten thousands how much do you lose good day yes we all agree the losers look at the big picture you understand now do you think that he will continue to be a loser otherwise I guess it could be yes or no yeah from the type of business he has ventured into now against them it depends on the Dynamics in the market it depends on how he is invested invested into this business his life the investment the Investments you understand if he continues pushing into the business maybe after five years [Music] can it be compared the laws he suffered in the beginning [Music] a good decision to bring about a high opportunity cost in short terms [Music] you all understand that say Amen all right now this is a class of brilliant students in Christianity to be a disciple of Jesus I want to say there is also an opportunity [Applause] to be just to be his disciples you see to to be the Disciples of Jesus we give up Allah is a sure business is a sure business you know I told you that if someone or mundu enters into a business leaving his job when he's not too sure about his business it's a biggest mistake you can ever make but let me leave my teaching job and I go and ban the charcoal now you've now though you have been getting little money but you've been getting this and then you have gone to banjo now when you reach in charcoal even the little you were against you stop getting it that is things go wrong a business that never disappoints Hallelujah man this is the business of being a disciple of Jesus Amen being a follower of Jesus being a follower of the world if you follow the work you will never fail if you believe the word you can never you can't fall down you can never accidentally you the prophets are assured are you hearing what I'm saying look at your number following Jesus Christ what the Bible demands of us to do no one could call it bible church does not feel good in the first place yeah many Pleasures others they just go and cheats it seems as if it is enjoyable it seems as if it is [Music] because it makes you happy it is destruction but when you decide to be a Christian the reason why I'm preaching this today is I want us to understand of being a disciples you can't just follow something without thinking if you are leaving your job you have to think what business are you entering so let us not be Believers [Music] let us not be Believers without knowing the cross you should know what cause it is only your spirit you have decided to be a disciple but the problem that we have I want to ask you now let us go back to economics today foreign this man will be a double loser we have a lot of believers churches very mechanism you are not getting the world properly and see 24 numbers and you're not also getting Christianity and the word of God properly of Christianity you are not satisfied with the worldly things and even goddess you were there in the middle yeah you are not enjoying anything I want to be here following Jesus when I am enjoying what I'm doing when I enjoy it is foreign foreign foreign [Music] what what does the Bible say the Bible talks about a double-minded man Bible is what it says the devil-minded man all his ways we must not be double-minded we must be one-minded we are going to be Believers let us not be Sunday let us be believe us every day the Bible says it is better to see you welcome but the the last generation is foreign do you know how it's it feels on yourself you want to speed it up we're gonna go and do that it tastes funny but for me when I want water I love it these things of room temperature I want very cold and this is what God wants he says it is not be a fan of the world am I preaching to someone Overcomers that is the first thing is do you know that a Christian is not supposed to be in a situation where you look warm all the time you're the one begging foreign [Applause] huh foreign am I communicating sometimes it takes you to delete some contacts sometimes it takes you to separate yourself even change locations to focus on this message and decided to Bear the course and God never prospered if you show me one um foreign foreign stop in one second some people hospitals when the world is there when the brother is there your sister my goodness you when you find them chatting on their phones they are chatting as if they don't even know the name Jesus you see as if they have never known where Jesus is [Music] the spirit of a cockroach may God deliver you if there is if you can mean business count your losses for you to you know be a disciples when you accept amen you are accepted to undergo that opportunity say well yes this is what is going to cost me but it's all right I'm saving it for the future you can almost know the person who will be successful it's not hard it's not hard at all um what do we want in five years what are we going to be involved what is the vision what do we want our community what are we looking for you now it bring down to us what do you want in in two years you can't just be there [Applause] you are not guided you you must have Focus you must know what you want God you may not have it right now but you must you must know it no you're not human yeah why do people go to Lottery watch why why do they kill others why do they go for betting again because they are not focused they realize it when it's too late wanted to run to the king it wasn't his time so it was the wrong time and he was the wrong woman he didn't accomplish anything I don't want to arrive at things in my life before my time are you hearing what I'm saying you want to be serious with God you want to be like Khushi you want to be focused you have to take your time to see your future being Believers does not mean we just believe without reasoning with the word God has given us reasons to use it on us here be faithful this is what God wants for us you see if because what I'm saying if you you count your cost and you know you were a child of God will increase it 100 100 you cannot continue saying you're a Believers but you are there calling every girl and boy and even the people because there are many young people who listen to this so if the Lord gives me an anointing to speak about something I speak about it so please help me you were here that by the time we leave this place it would have gotten home Amina man the Lord will give you Grace to remove and be healed praise the name of the Lord um when you see in Luke 14 28 where we read Jesus said which of you pretending to build a tower sits not down fast whether he has enough money to finish that over innocence [Music] I want to say every important thing involves counting the cause foreign if if you want to to rent a house but we're gonna Park some music how much do you need if you want to help somebody if you want to give to the Lord how much do I give how much is a question that we ask every day in our life yeah nothing the cost is a very important and integral part of our Lives [Music] because he just knew uh the car is 25 million yeah all right I have it here what I'm saying and they buy that and they don't have money to put it what and then the car gets a problem and it just sits at the garage see the building of a house or Tower it involves somebody listens so badly understanding the course to raise the structures how much does it cost before you start you should know how much you have foreign [Music] tiger because if you don't count the course and I'm saying Brethren Even in our Christian Journey if you don't count the cause we shall be a laughing stock they make sacrifices all right I'll leave this I'll leave that I'll leave that Allah to follow Jesus that's why it is that song I've decided to follow Jesus that song doesn't sound like a man who doesn't know what is foreign foreign [Applause] we must count the cause thrilling up by normal triangle we must count the cross you know and Jesus said the man has to First counter and you know how much will it cost me praise the name of the Lord I see you have increased it so much but still I can't hear myself and I'm straining a lot so I don't know what exactly is wrong maybe the brother can help him to balance the sound now I'd like I would like you to look at verse 31. Oh what king going to make a war against another king see it's not down fast and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand s [Music] deep in our hearts Hallelujah man praise the name of the Lord King will make war against another king and doesn't first sit down [Music] and count the cross [Music] is generous and inquires from them tell me how big is our but uh our soldiers how big is our army and you'll be told I have ten thousand white and then he will ask how big is the uh the uh our enemies to give the accountability yes now you're coming brother generously will tell him um and Jesus said yes according to the situation there is no way we our army of ten thousand foreign [Music] and Jesus concluded by saying yes then this King while this the other Army of the enemy is still far away he will devise another means [Music] he will send an ambassador to go to the other Army again and send a message saying our King to offer peace foreign [Music] if you were a king you don't win a battle by being emotions we have to go and kill all of them together you must know the Art of War property must not only know how strong his arm is also how strong is [Music] these are two examples yes we are too but did you know he gave an example of a builder yeah but he also is he Jesus God himself is a building forever the house the Bible says in Hebrews 3 4 for every house is building by some man but he that built but he that buildeth built all things is God Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord who built all things did some people miss it and God has a wise Builder Museum he counted the cross and he knew what his church he knew we needed grace through his blood he knew we were helpless he knew he had to come and help pay the cost of salvation Hallelujah man so all we as Believers need to do is to believe what he has done for us the second example he gave chocolate was a king's example and he said a king will know listen listen now this is a very good one we know how to attack he will Fast count the coast Our God knew the strength of his enemies you remember the example he gave the enemies but when God looked at his enemies he gauged his strength and he also knew where his strength and he knew he's much stronger he knew the devil is much weaker than him he knew that he he knew that his armies are greater than Lucifer's Army [Music] so God did not send ambassadors of Peace Jesus yes did not come to bring peace what was that charity because when he came to fire yes he knew his enemies if he comes with a sword he must defeated Christ did not come to bring the gospel of peace with the Devil to destroy the very works of Saturn Hallelujah man and I want to say this also we therefore should not live at peace with the Devil no upana we should refuse to live at peace with the devil together if the devil brings you a demon a spirit of lust Satan we are created peace without Spirit fight against him how do you do that by coming to church by praying by coming for services by being on fire for God if the devil brings this kind of spirits demons believe us the problem with this they try to make peace with the Devil um do you know Ghana we should refuse foreign should count your course I don't know count your cost God counted this course if his armies were about his son his daughter's armies Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] foreign oh foreign we don't want even the thoughts of it yes until we get to that level refuse the spirits we cannot be delivered you have to refuse them you got to feel bad about them I'm a priest in the cabinet this is the anointing uponiko [Music] foreign there is a Thousand Angels hallelujah amen forever one demons [Music] do you believe it brother and the Devil comes and he begins to build houses foreign it's as much as you've you've you've you've went with them why why because at the sex glands are in the mouth the devil tells the world you can only do this the Believers are going to say no yeah the female and male glands when they mix together when that mixes that's what our Prophet says and the devil says I'm going to be holy unto the Lord foreign most of them are living immorally all of you here Beyond 21. the focus I'm telling you oh you know I will not give you the standard of another church for those of younger men here the anointing of days of the voice of so what are you doing now you you you you are very busy Contracting this is you it is trying to destroy young people yes we are not going to accept them together mucham We are following the right patterns that has been given to us we must count the costs we must count the costs praise the name of the Lord now I'll read for you one last quote the Investments it's a very good message and many times people who call themselves Believers and are unwilling to separate themselves yet after we could say it well I unidentified by uh identified by the scripture that the policies are still being given to whosoever wants to receive it foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] how can I get money you thought money just dropped from Heaven even those who got miracles of money they were true Disciples of Jesus yes and I'm preaching to you about the cost of disciples if you're not a true disciple I can't even get miracles of money Peter was one of them who got miracles he was following his master yeah fish when I was in a Guero Island fishing so now I can fish I'm very proud of that I I I I enjoy fishing but I learned a lot of it it has the spiritual connections there's a lot of patience involved mucho Hallelujah how much money do you think was there it was enough to take care of everything so God can give you miracles it doesn't happen to mediocrest all kinds of real disciples so what I'm trying to say you say that some people call themselves Believers themselves depart from the things of the world for you to be a true disciples when I was told you should do you sell everything remember you have touched the baddest parts [Music] you even know the part where you speak Jesus wants you to forsake it am I preaching to somebody tonight Jesus wants you to forsake it then then you will be the good disciple as I said he saw something in Jesus no man's heart you saw something in this message but to him the price was so great that he didn't want to pay any to pay the price if being a Believer it seems I should leave my girlfriend if being a Believer means this one is so hard for me if being a believer that means I should not even be flirting with girls on my phone foreign [Music] they came foreign foreign uh Brothers I'm wondering whether you know the song which says I'm giving my life away I also don't know the song very well but it has very good words I'm going to try and sing it and if they follow you you can listen to me and then you see if you can follow me brother Marvin I don't know whether you have this song If you don't have it you just find it now [Music] for me I've seen the passion of these days and they forgiveness of his final break now I can never be the same my heart has been forever change I want to
