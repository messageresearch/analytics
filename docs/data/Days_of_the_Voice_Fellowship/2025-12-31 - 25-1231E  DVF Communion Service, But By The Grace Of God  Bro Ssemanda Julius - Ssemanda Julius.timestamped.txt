[41:44] his duty bound to fulfill his promises.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; The prophet of the Lord says
[41:52] that there's one thing that the pro the
[41:53] Lord cannot do and that is failing. Our
[41:57] God will never fail.

[56:00] Father, we want to commit your word into
[56:01] your hands, Lord, our precious brother
[56:03] Julius that is going to minister to us
[56:05] the word. We pray that you will anoint

[56:29] we have come to remember
[56:33] the sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice
[56:36] that you did for us when you died for
[56:39] us. When you died and rose again, Father
[56:43] Lord, you did it for us. Not for
[56:45] yourself, but for us, we did not deserve
[56:47] it, but by your grace, oh God, you have
[56:50] given unto us the righteousness of God.
[56:53] And Father, we now commit this service
[56:55] into your hands, the preaching of the
[56:56] word into your hands. come and just take
[56:59] over. Come and do what you only can do.

[57:16] we just straight away go to communion
[57:18] after that. And then afterwards uh

[57:51] can give it to brother shalom. If you
[57:52] have testimonies or special songs you

[57:58] testimony you can give him a written
[57:59] note so that you will be called called
[58:02] in uh after the preaching of the word.

[58:12] something like that. So we will be here
[58:14] for as long as we have testimonies uh
[58:16] that we want to tell. So I'm expecting
[58:18] that the service might end around uh 1 1
[58:22] a.m. and if there are people who can
[58:23] travel home they'll be free to do that.
[58:25] But we are going to have some time of

[1:02:35] for us. We thank you for your grace and
[1:02:38] mercy. We thank you, Father, for
[1:02:41] offering up your son when he died upon
[1:02:45] the cross to pay the debt for my
[1:02:48] iniquities.
[1:02:50] Lord Jesus Christ, you did not turn
[1:02:53] away, but you took your our sins upon
[1:02:57] yourself, Lord, that we might become the
[1:03:00] righteousness of God.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And today, Father, we can stand and
[1:03:04] declare and confess that we are the sons
[1:03:08] and daughters of the living God because
[1:03:11] we have been accepted in the beloved.

[1:03:33] aside. Take every person aside.
[1:03:36] Circumcise the the lips that speak the
[1:03:39] ears that hear and the heart that it may
[1:03:41] believe. Lord may the Holy Spirit take

[1:04:03] and total preeminence that I may
[1:04:06] decrease that you may increase and every
[1:04:07] person father may see you through the
[1:04:10] preaching of the word in the name of the
[1:04:12] lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:04:19] Amen.
[1:04:22] Thank you so much dear pastor for
[1:04:25] supporting us to go
[1:04:29] to masaka there and we had a really
[1:04:32] wonderful time in the presence of God.
[1:04:35] The brethren they sent their greetings
[1:04:37] and they thanked you pastor so much.
[1:04:40] Amen.
[1:04:41] And uh
[1:04:43] I thank God that he gave us janimis we
[1:04:47] came back safely.
[1:04:51] Yes,
[1:04:56] I mean shall we go to the reading of the
[1:05:00] word?
[1:05:06] Okay,
[1:05:07] let us read from 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:09] 15
[1:05:11] verses 9 to 10.
[1:05:16] The scripture says 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:05:18] 15 9-10 it says
[1:05:22] for I am the least of the apostles
[1:05:26] that I am not meant to be called an
[1:05:29] apostle
[1:05:30] because I persecuted the church of God
[1:05:36] but by the grace of God I am what I am.
[1:05:43] Then he says, "And his grace which was
[1:05:47] bestowed upon me was not in vain,
[1:05:54] but I labored more abundantly than they
[1:05:56] all." Then he says, "Yet not I, but the
[1:06:00] grace of God which was with me." Amen.
[1:06:06] Then in Galatians chapter 2 he says
[1:06:08] verse 20-21.
[1:06:16] Galatians chapter 2 verse 20-21 he says
[1:06:19] I am crucified with Christ.
[1:06:22] Nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:06:28] liveth in me. And the life which I now
[1:06:33] live in the flesh, I live by the faith
[1:06:37] of the son of God which loved me
[1:06:43] and gave himself for me. Amen. May take
[1:06:48] the comfort of your seat.
[1:06:50] God bless you. May God bless the reading
[1:06:52] of his word. Amen.
[1:06:56] just uh open your hearts and we share
[1:06:59] something here
[1:07:03] that will bring us closer to the Lord
[1:07:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:07:07] Whenever I come to church, we just want
[1:07:09] to make sure that we we get a step
[1:07:11] closer to the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:07:13] the closer we get, the closer we get,
[1:07:15] then the rapture will have to take
[1:07:17] place.
[1:07:18] So here the scripture says that uh uh 1
[1:07:22] Corinthians chapter 15 9-10 he said that
[1:07:25] for I am the least of the apostles
[1:07:33] that I will not meet to be called an
[1:07:36] apostle because I persecuted the church
[1:07:40] of God. I was trying to adjust from
[1:07:42] preaching the interpreter to without the
[1:07:45] interpreter. That's why I silenced a
[1:07:48] bit.
[1:07:49] Yeah. So it says
[1:07:52] he that Paul is saying here that he is
[1:07:55] the list of the apostles
[1:07:57] because why he calls himself the list of
[1:08:00] the apostles because he persecuted the
[1:08:02] church of God. And then he says but
[1:08:07] but by the grace of God I am what I am.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] Then he talks about his then he says
[1:08:16] that and this grace that God bestowed
[1:08:20] upon me was not in vain.
[1:08:24] Listen carefully when the grace is given
[1:08:28] it's not in vain. Then he says he
[1:08:31] labored more abundantly. Then he says,
[1:08:35] "Yet not I
[1:08:41] but the grace of God which was with me."
[1:08:47] Then he says, "I am crucified with
[1:08:49] Christ, yet I live." Then he says, "Yet
[1:08:53] not I but Christ that liveth in me
[1:08:58] because he loved me."
[1:09:02] My subject is but by the grace of God.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God.
[1:09:13] The word grace means
[1:09:15] unmmerited favor.
[1:09:18] Favor that is given that you do not
[1:09:21] deserve. Favor that is given that you
[1:09:25] have not worked for. favor that is given
[1:09:28] regardless of who you are.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's God's grace. Unmmerited favor.
[1:09:37] God is grace. Paul is Paul here is
[1:09:40] saying that I am the least of the
[1:09:42] apostles
[1:09:44] because I persecuted the church
[1:09:47] but I am an apostle today by the grace
[1:09:51] of God.
[1:09:54] that but changed the story says but by
[1:09:58] the grace of God so grace comes to the
[1:10:02] list
[1:10:04] the list of men it comes to the
[1:10:08] undeserving
[1:10:10] when I say grace I want you to keep that
[1:10:12] word unmmerited favor
[1:10:16] because I want to talk about that
[1:10:17] unmmerited favor
[1:10:20] without merit it is given whenever we
[1:10:24] come to God.
[1:10:26] I want you to listen. Whenever we come
[1:10:29] to God, none of us should ever make a
[1:10:33] mistake of coming to God for justice.
[1:10:38] For justice.
[1:10:41] We should come to God
[1:10:44] for mercy
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; because justice is given according to
[1:10:49] your deeds.
[1:10:51] I want your mercy for if I come for
[1:10:54] justice I cannot stand.
[1:10:58] Justice is given according to your deeds
[1:11:01] but mercy is given regardless of your
[1:11:04] deeds.
[1:11:07] The Bible even says in Isaiah 40 64
[1:11:10] verse6 that even our righteous deeds are
[1:11:14] filthy rugs before God.
[1:11:20] We are talking about unmmerited favor.
[1:11:24] Favor without merit.
[1:11:27] Favor that you have not worked for.
[1:11:32] Let us go together. He says our
[1:11:35] righteous deeds are filthy rugs before
[1:11:40] God.
[1:11:42] Luke chapter 18
[1:11:45] vers 9 to 14 he says
[1:11:54] he says
[1:11:56] and he spake this parable unto certain
[1:12:01] which trusted in themselves
[1:12:05] that they were righteous
[1:12:10] and despised others.
[1:12:20] He had to get a parable because when he
[1:12:23] discerned in a congregation that he had
[1:12:27] he saw some that
[1:12:30] trusted in themselves that they were
[1:12:32] righteous and despised others.
[1:12:38] It says the two men went up into the
[1:12:41] temple to pray. The one a Pharisee,
[1:12:44] the other a publican.
[1:12:48] The Pharisees stood and prayed. He stood
[1:12:51] in the temple.
[1:12:54] And he prayed thus with himself. God, I
[1:12:58] thank thee.
[1:13:01] So confidence. Oh. God, I thank thee
[1:13:05] that I'm not as one. I'm not as other
[1:13:08] many are.
[1:13:11] Extortioners,
[1:13:13] unjust,
[1:13:15] adulterers,
[1:13:17] or even as this publican,
[1:13:20] I thank thee that I'm not like one of
[1:13:22] them.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I fast twice in the week.
[1:13:31] I fast twice in the week. I give
[1:13:34] tightness of all that I possess.
[1:13:38] See, he's claiming his righteousness.
[1:13:43] And the publican standing up off would
[1:13:47] not lift up so much as his eyes unto
[1:13:51] heaven,
[1:13:53] but smote up his breast, saying, "Go
[1:13:57] be merciful to me a sinner."
[1:14:06] I tell you this man that went down to
[1:14:10] his house, this man, this publican
[1:14:14] went down to his house justified
[1:14:19] rather than the other.
[1:14:24] God's grace is the justifier
[1:14:29] of him that believes on Christ. Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; What gives you justice is the grace of
[1:14:37] God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; For it is by faith, says the scripture,
[1:14:42] through it is by grace through faith
[1:14:45] that we are saved and not of your own,
[1:14:50] lest any man should boast.
[1:14:55] In the message of grace, the prophet
[1:14:57] says the message of grace has been
[1:15:00] tampered under the feet of many until it
[1:15:03] is become a disgrace.
[1:15:10] What grace does no
[1:15:13] I'm going ahead of myself. Let us let us
[1:15:16] go here. He says, "The message of grace
[1:15:20] has been trampled under the feet of men
[1:15:23] until it has become a disgrace.
[1:15:30] You forget.
[1:15:33] You forget
[1:15:38] until you start to think that it's your
[1:15:41] own righteousness.
[1:15:49] and it becomes a disgrace. He says
[1:15:53] and some
[1:15:55] now it's me saying that and some think
[1:15:58] that uh
[1:16:00] since God we are under grace they they
[1:16:03] do all kinds of things. We don't want
[1:16:06] that. We want to understand this. He
[1:16:08] said, "Some of them runs into eternal
[1:16:11] security,
[1:16:12] some run into everything,
[1:16:15] but
[1:16:17] the true message of grace remains the
[1:16:21] same."
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And there is where Satan tries to knock
[1:16:28] it out from the church.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:16:37] The prophet says, "Grace is what God
[1:16:42] does for you."
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; And works is what you do for God to show
[1:16:49] appreciation of what God did for you.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Listen, grace is known by its works
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; because grace produces the works. That's
[1:17:03] right.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 28-10 says,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; For by grace are you saved through
[1:17:14] faith, and that not of yourselves. It is
[1:17:19] the gift of God.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Not of works, lest any man should
[1:17:26] boast."
[1:17:28] Now listen verse 10. For we are his
[1:17:32] workmanship.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Created.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Created
[1:17:39] in Christ Jesus
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; unto good works.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Listen these good works. He says which
[1:17:48] God has before ordained that we should
[1:17:53] work in them. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; We when grace brought us in, God had
[1:18:02] already ordained the works that we
[1:18:05] should do.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The works that we should walk in were
[1:18:09] ordained before you even came in. So the
[1:18:12] works that you do is a product of God's
[1:18:16] grace,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; not your own. Amen.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Listen brother, sister,
[1:18:26] the prophet
[1:18:28] has got that had to make it that clear.
[1:18:32] He had to make that clear that grace is
[1:18:36] what God does for you.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; It's what God does for you.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:52] Now we want to see
[1:18:56] how much can this grace go.
[1:18:59] How much can this unmmerited favor sit?
[1:19:03] Of course, we are not going to to sit
[1:19:05] right to the end of it because it you
[1:19:08] can't stretch it to limit. It's so
[1:19:11] unlimited. So I want you to hear
[1:19:14] brothers and sisters
[1:19:17] regardless of where you are and what you
[1:19:20] have done
[1:19:22] God's grace can do for you.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen now. God's grace
[1:19:35] doesn't stop on saving you.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; It quickens you.
[1:19:42] It keeps you
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; and it takes you through every step of
[1:19:47] the way.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Unmmerited favor is what sustains you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; You are standing today by the grace of
[1:19:59] God.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; The songwriter had to sing a song. It is
[1:20:04] the grace that brought me this far and
[1:20:08] grace shall lead me home. Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Brother, am I going to make it to the
[1:20:13] rapture?
[1:20:16] How did you make it into Christ?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; How did you make it? That's the same way
[1:20:22] you're going to make it to the rapture.
[1:20:28] God is grace is the key that open the
[1:20:31] way for us into the kingdom of God.
[1:20:35] It's what paid the price for all of us
[1:20:39] and the qualification for each one of
[1:20:41] us. It
[1:20:44] grace, the grace of God qualified each
[1:20:48] one of us
[1:20:52] unto eternal life.
[1:20:56] It qualifies those that are called.
[1:21:01] When God called you,
[1:21:04] he gave you the qualifications
[1:21:06] for eternal life.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; What you received from the beginning
[1:21:14] has to take you through to the end.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Why? The people are fearing
[1:21:22] what is coming tomorrow. The people
[1:21:24] fearing our let let us get down here.
[1:21:28] Let us get down here. You know God fully
[1:21:30] equips you when he calls you.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; You cannot say you have gone too far
[1:21:41] that God's grace can't find you.
[1:21:45] I brother I don't believe that you can
[1:21:47] go too far my sister that God's grace
[1:21:49] can't find you.
[1:21:53] You can't come to a point where you say
[1:21:55] God's grace has lost me.
[1:22:00] It cannot lose you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; You can't get out of the sight of God's
[1:22:06] grace.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; If God has got you,
[1:22:11] he has got you. That settles it.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; If he has blessed you, he has blessed
[1:22:17] you. That settles it.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You know, God can't reverse that.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; What he has done shall be permanent.
[1:22:26] Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; We sing that song so much. It shall be
[1:22:30] permanent
[1:22:32] what the Lord has done for me. But you
[1:22:36] are fearing whether you're going to make
[1:22:37] it in rapture.
[1:22:39] You are fearing whether you're going to
[1:22:40] overcome. You are fearing whether you
[1:22:43] you can stand. You are fearing whether
[1:22:46] you you can make it a to a Christian
[1:22:48] life. You are fearing whether you can
[1:22:51] make it to holiness to perfection. You
[1:22:54] are fearing whether those weaknesses
[1:22:56] won't may get you to backslide. You are
[1:22:59] fearing whether you want to go back to
[1:23:01] the things you used to do. You are
[1:23:03] fearing that oh brother the brother may
[1:23:04] find me when I'm caught up. This thing
[1:23:06] may overtake me. It shall not overtake
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; because you didn't bring yourself to
[1:23:13] this.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something.
[1:23:22] When God says you are in,
[1:23:25] no one can say you out.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; When God is sealed you are in,
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; no one can open and say the seal has
[1:23:34] been broken.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You are sealed until the day of your
[1:23:38] redemption.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; When he opens the door of mercy for you,
[1:23:43] no man can shut that door.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; It is still open and dripping with
[1:23:48] blood.
[1:23:50] We come to a point where we say now I
[1:23:53] don't know this thing is holding me. I
[1:23:56] don't know how it can't let me go.
[1:24:09] Brother even said don't give it
[1:24:11] attention.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Someone said brother bra have a stubborn
[1:24:15] spirit
[1:24:17] said pray don't give it an attention
[1:24:20] it will go.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Now look here the prophet says in the
[1:24:25] message how can I overcome?
[1:24:29] Someone says I he says how can I
[1:24:32] overcome 1963
[1:24:39] I have fought brother Brham
[1:24:43] I have fought
[1:24:46] they told us to fight the good fight of
[1:24:48] faith I have fought
[1:24:52] they told us that character is a victory
[1:24:55] I have fought
[1:24:58] Indeed it is.
[1:25:01] But let me tell you
[1:25:04] got to understand the whole thing how it
[1:25:06] works.
[1:25:09] You know they told us you you cannot uh
[1:25:13] uh
[1:25:17] if you don't fight you cannot you cannot
[1:25:20] win. But he say so I have fought
[1:25:24] brother. I tried to quit smoking. I
[1:25:28] tried to let my hair grow out. I have
[1:25:31] tried to do this. I have tried so hard.
[1:25:36] Brother, brother, I just can't do it.
[1:25:46] Now you listen to what the prophet says.
[1:25:48] You know was always balanced.
[1:25:52] He said he says don't go this way. Don't
[1:25:54] go that way. Stay in the middle of the
[1:25:56] line.
[1:25:58] He says, "Don't try it anymore.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Just take a hold of his hand."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And say, "Father,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; you put my hand in the sleeve."
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; See, I am just going to give you my
[1:26:18] hand.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I am going to walk on Lord.
[1:26:24] look to you.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He says it will happen. He will dress
[1:26:30] you like a real Christian.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; You will be a real Christian.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; These works were for ordained.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That we should work in them.
[1:26:50] It's not about whether I am holding unto
[1:26:53] Christ.
[1:26:55] It is about who whether he is holding
[1:27:00] me.
[1:27:02] God by his grace predestinated you.
[1:27:09] It's not about what you are right now
[1:27:14] or what you have.
[1:27:21] I'm this. I'm that.
[1:27:24] This is all I have.
[1:27:27] God,
[1:27:30] you know the works were for ordained.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; I wonder what do I have to do?
[1:27:39] I just have to accept that.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; When he says upon your faith add upon uh
[1:27:46] upon your faith add virtue.
[1:27:48] knowledge.
[1:27:50] What do you have to do? Accept it.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; You can't work your way up. God has to
[1:27:58] work on you and get you up.
[1:28:08] likes to do that. I want you to listen
[1:28:11] brothers and sisters. Christianity
[1:28:14] is God's business.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Not any man's business. And every
[1:28:21] Christian is God's work.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; We sing that song. He's still working on
[1:28:30] me
[1:28:31] to make me what I have to be.
[1:28:35] He made the sun, the moon and the stars.
[1:28:39] He's still working on me.
[1:28:42] How wonderful
[1:28:44] he he must be. You see,
[1:28:48] you are a work of God. We are his
[1:28:51] workmanship.
[1:28:54] So it is God working on you.
[1:29:00] Remember this is God is a business.
[1:29:03] We are co-workers together with Christ.
[1:29:10] But this is God's business. He works
[1:29:13] upon you that you may walk with him.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen, church.
[1:29:23] It is God that brought you in and it is
[1:29:28] God to keep you in.
[1:29:32] Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You will you will struggle with it and
[1:29:36] you will fail. I'm telling you.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; You are trying to work it out. It won't
[1:29:43] work. It won't work.
[1:29:46] You'll become a hypocrite. I'm telling
[1:29:48] you,
[1:29:54] it's until when we come to a point where
[1:29:56] we lose the confidence
[1:29:58] as Christians. But Peter says, "Why look
[1:30:03] here upon us as if by our own holiness
[1:30:09] have made this man to walk."
[1:30:13] They say is faith in the name of Jesus
[1:30:15] through faith in his name.
[1:30:24] You see
[1:30:29] the grace of God,
[1:30:31] the scripture tells us and it says in 1
[1:30:34] Samuel 2:8,
[1:30:36] he takes a beggar from the dust of the
[1:30:39] earth and makes him a king.
[1:30:43] I take it in the physical and in the
[1:30:44] spiritual.
[1:30:46] Now let's go in the direction of the
[1:30:47] spiritual.
[1:30:49] He took you wherever you were from
[1:30:52] nothing and made you a kingdom
[1:30:58] and made you kings and priests
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; unto himself.
[1:31:08] What manner of people ought to it to be?
[1:31:11] Then John says, "What manner of love has
[1:31:14] the father bestowed upon us,
[1:31:20] you know, if you don't,
[1:31:24] you know, you don't have to feel it, you
[1:31:27] just have to believe it." You know, I I
[1:31:30] sometimes I wonder
[1:31:32] when you try to bring the grace of God
[1:31:35] and the love of God to a believer, you
[1:31:37] know, I sometimes I wonder and these are
[1:31:40] are struggling people, but they they
[1:31:42] want to do something about it.
[1:31:46] They just don't want to accept
[1:31:51] like
[1:31:53] and you remain in that condition.
[1:31:59] It's not sweet to them.
[1:32:08] But he told David, "When you are little
[1:32:11] in your sight,
[1:32:14] I chose you to be a king."
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; In the sight of David himself, he was
[1:32:20] little.
[1:32:22] He saw himself as nothing.
[1:32:25] But that didn't matter to God.
[1:32:32] He told Israel
[1:32:36] they were a little nation
[1:32:40] but God loved them.
[1:32:45] He loved them anyhow.
[1:32:50] And you see
[1:32:53] Malachi chapter one it says
[1:33:04] Malachi chapter 1:es 2-3
[1:33:11] I have loved you
[1:33:16] says the Lord
[1:33:19] Yet you say,
[1:33:22] "Wherein hast thou loved us?"
[1:33:27] Believers
[1:33:29] could not see the love of God.
[1:33:33] And God says, "I have loved you."
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Was not Esau Jacob's
[1:33:41] brother?"
[1:33:43] Oh my, says the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob
[1:33:49] and I hated Esau.
[1:33:52] What good or evil had they done?
[1:33:54] Nothing. But when God sets his love upon
[1:33:58] you, he can't reverse it.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; No, God is not an excited lover.
[1:34:17] But after a few days,
[1:34:22] that was an excited excitement. But God
[1:34:25] is not an excited person.
[1:34:28] It means what he says. He says, "I have
[1:34:31] loved you." But listen, Deuteronomy 6
[1:34:34] to8, Moses told the children of Israel,
[1:34:38] "The Lord your God, I love this, is
[1:34:41] going to give you possession
[1:34:43] over the land. Then he says,
[1:34:48] let us read it. Let us read it.
[1:34:52] Deuteronomy 6:7
[1:34:54] 6 to8
[1:34:56] we are talking about unmmerited favor.
[1:35:01] Deuteronomy 7 6 to8.
[1:35:06] I want you to stop trying hard.
[1:35:09] Stop trying hard because you are not
[1:35:12] changing because you preach a sermon
[1:35:14] because that you missed something in a
[1:35:17] sermon.
[1:35:20] The message was in between those lines
[1:35:23] and you missed it. Then you try to
[1:35:26] struggle to get you to that to that what
[1:35:29] to that mark to the standard of the
[1:35:32] message that has come to you. But you
[1:35:35] you you you are just pushing through to
[1:35:38] get into there.
[1:35:40] You can't brother sister.
[1:35:49] I always believe
[1:35:51] even pastor tells me I count not myself
[1:35:54] as one that has attained.
[1:35:58] And Paul said the same thing and the
[1:36:00] same thing to you.
[1:36:02] There's something that cries in the
[1:36:04] heart of a believer yearning for
[1:36:06] perfection.
[1:36:09] But many are trying to push themselves
[1:36:11] to that perfection.
[1:36:15] You remain a my sister.
[1:36:20] You try to fight the spirit of rumors.
[1:36:22] You try to fight the spirit of lies. You
[1:36:24] try to fight the spirit of lust. You try
[1:36:26] try hard.
[1:36:28] I have to make it. You try to push
[1:36:32] through so hard.
[1:36:34] It's not hard. It's not hard that it's
[1:36:37] not that way.
[1:36:40] God wants a surrendered heart.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord did not set his love upon you,
[1:36:50] nor choose you because you are more in
[1:36:52] number. This fits us just right.
[1:36:57] Because you are more in number than any
[1:36:59] people. No sir. For you are the fewest
[1:37:03] of all people.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But because the Lord loved you
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; and because he would keep the oath which
[1:37:13] he had sworn unto your fathers.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Because their fathers were men of God.
[1:37:22] It's God. It's God's business to keep
[1:37:25] the word that he has given to the man of
[1:37:28] God. It's not my business. It's not any
[1:37:32] any person's business. It is God's
[1:37:34] business to see up to that.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And you see it is coming upon the
[1:37:40] children because the oath was given to
[1:37:43] the fathers.
[1:37:44] He says, "Has the Lord brought you out?"
[1:37:49] He says, "He loved you. That's why he
[1:37:52] has brought you out with a mighty hand
[1:37:55] and redeemed you out of the house of
[1:37:58] bond men from the hand of Pharaoh, king
[1:38:02] of Egypt.
[1:38:07] Chapter 9 verse 1-6 says
[1:38:13] here, "O Israel, thou art to pass over
[1:38:17] Jordan this day to go in to possess
[1:38:21] nations greater and mightier than
[1:38:25] yourself."
[1:38:29] I don't know whether I I want you to
[1:38:31] take this grace apply it on the physical
[1:38:34] and on the spiritual
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; it says you are going to possess nations
[1:38:41] greater and mightier than yourself
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; cities great and first upon heaven
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; a people great and tall the children of
[1:38:51] the anarchims whom thou knowest
[1:38:55] and of whom thou hast he had Hey, who
[1:38:57] can stand before the children of Anch?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Understand therefore this day that the
[1:39:06] Lord thy God is he which goes over
[1:39:11] before you
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; as a consuming fire.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He shall destroy them.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; I don't care what has overtaken you. God
[1:39:24] goes ahead of you as a consuming fire.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Then he says,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; "And he shall bring them down before thy
[1:39:33] face."
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "So shalt thou drive them
[1:39:38] out, and destroy them quickly, as the
[1:39:42] Lord has said unto thee."
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; He told them, "It is the Lord by whom
[1:39:47] you shall put them down.
[1:39:52] Speak not thou,
[1:39:54] do not speak in thine heart.
[1:39:59] After that the Lord thy God has cast
[1:40:02] them out from before thee, saying, for
[1:40:07] my righteousness,
[1:40:09] the Lord has brought me into possess
[1:40:12] this land.
[1:40:16] because of my righteousness,
[1:40:18] God has brought me to possess this land.
[1:40:20] He says, don't even get that in your
[1:40:23] heart.
[1:40:25] Paul says, what do you have that you
[1:40:28] have not received?
[1:40:32] He says,
[1:40:34] "But for the wickedness of these
[1:40:37] nations," you know, I didn't think about
[1:40:39] this, but I'm seeing, you know, when
[1:40:43] brother sis, pastor, sister was telling
[1:40:45] telling us how how what how to behave
[1:40:50] after God has blessed us after he had
[1:40:54] seen that God is going to bless many of
[1:40:55] us. I'm seeing this the same thing God
[1:40:58] is saying
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; how we should behave after he has given
[1:41:01] us possession over the land.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; What should be in our hearts? Then he
[1:41:05] says, "But for the because of the
[1:41:07] wickedness of these nations, the Lord
[1:41:10] does drive them out from before you,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; not for thy righteousness
[1:41:18] or for the uprightness of your thine
[1:41:21] heart."
[1:41:24] does thou go to possess their land? But
[1:41:29] for the wickedness of these nations, the
[1:41:32] Lord thy God does drive them out from
[1:41:34] before thee, and that he may perform the
[1:41:37] word which the Lord swear unto thy
[1:41:39] fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; He says, not of your righteousness.
[1:41:51] I'm not depending on that. Listen, God
[1:41:55] says, "I'm going to do my things for
[1:41:56] you, but I'm not depending on your
[1:41:57] righteousness." That should make me
[1:41:59] happy.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; That is a gift for me.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; That's a key for me. Says, "Understand
[1:42:05] therefore that the Lord thy God giveth
[1:42:08] thee not this good land to possess it
[1:42:12] for thy righteousness."
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; God is giving it to you. But understand,
[1:42:18] it's not because of your righteousness.
[1:42:21] For thou art a stiff necked people.
[1:42:27] I got to tell you, brother, you mean I'm
[1:42:29] stiff necked? You are stubborn
[1:42:33] sometimes.
[1:42:37] But God just said, "These are my
[1:42:39] people."
[1:42:41] Then Moses says, "Remember that and
[1:42:43] forget not that you have always provoked
[1:42:46] the Lord."
[1:42:48] And I'm telling you the same. Don't
[1:42:50] forget you always provoke God. But God
[1:42:53] is not depending on those things. He's
[1:42:55] not depending on your righteousness. He
[1:42:57] is depending on his grace and love that
[1:43:01] he has bestowed upon you.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; How has the Lord loved us? This this is
[1:43:09] God's grace, brother.
[1:43:12] When you come to God,
[1:43:15] don't limit yourself and don't limit
[1:43:18] God.
[1:43:20] If you want to ask something from God,
[1:43:23] you ask something that yourself, you
[1:43:26] know, for this thing to be done, it will
[1:43:30] take the grace of God.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Then God will be glorified. I tell
[1:43:35] pastor some things but I tell him those
[1:43:38] things because I want something that can
[1:43:40] be done and I will say surely this was
[1:43:44] the grace of God.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Now for now like some some people to
[1:43:49] have 1 million in their pocket it
[1:43:51] doesn't excite them.
[1:43:55] You see, so such a person now needs to
[1:43:59] get as something big that the women
[1:44:02] don't see the love of God in it because
[1:44:04] they are used to that 1 million.
[1:44:06] But some of you that 1 million comes
[1:44:10] I have testimony.
[1:44:13] Why? Because that's the cross of God. So
[1:44:17] God to do something that everyone will
[1:44:21] look upon it yourself. You look upon it
[1:44:23] and you say surely this was the grace of
[1:44:27] God.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You look there's things God does and you
[1:44:31] say but what what good did I do? I just
[1:44:34] am not so fit for this. That's now God
[1:44:37] says unmmerited favor.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; We we don't say you don't have enough
[1:44:44] qualifications. I'm saying unmmerited
[1:44:47] favor
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; can get you there.
[1:44:51] It can get you there.
[1:44:56] God wants testimonies.
[1:44:58] He loves the testimonies.
[1:45:01] I've said if you ask for something, ask
[1:45:03] something bigger that yourself will know
[1:45:05] and everyone will know that the grace of
[1:45:07] God has done it.
[1:45:09] cast out devils without fear knowing
[1:45:12] this one thing that the grace of God is
[1:45:14] upon you to do that.
[1:45:21] There are many people today that think
[1:45:25] God can't give them something
[1:45:28] that think that one is for these
[1:45:30] brothers that one for this minister that
[1:45:33] one maybe pastor can believe for that
[1:45:36] because they feel they believe actually
[1:45:39] not they feel they believe
[1:45:41] they vile and the worst and undeserving
[1:45:44] and unworthy.
[1:45:48] I believe the same. You are not worthy.
[1:45:50] You are unworthy.
[1:45:54] But
[1:45:56] whip not John. He say
[1:45:59] you are not worthy but Christ is worthy.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; And because he's worthy, you are chosen
[1:46:06] in him, count yourself worthy of the
[1:46:09] blessing.
[1:46:11] Listen,
[1:46:14] if you count yourself worthy because of
[1:46:17] Christ, you are not boasting.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; If we boast, I'm rich. If we behave like
[1:46:25] we are great people because of Christ,
[1:46:28] you are not boasting. Simala,
[1:46:31] you are acknowledging that God's grace
[1:46:34] has picked me far. I was pocketing
[1:46:36] because that's how most time we boast.
[1:46:40] So look here
[1:46:42] you you feel that there is something you
[1:46:45] are not worthy or fit for.
[1:46:48] I'm sorry to say this but there is many
[1:46:50] of us that look at ourselves.
[1:46:53] I look at myself me which brother can
[1:46:56] take me which sister can take me. God is
[1:46:59] not depending on those things.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; God is not depend unmmerited favor.
[1:47:09] I don't care. Yes, you are not
[1:47:11] qualified. Yes. Okay, we can see it
[1:47:13] also. Really, really you are not
[1:47:15] qualified. You are not qualified.
[1:47:18] Really, we can see it. But God is favor
[1:47:21] has qualified you
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; for that husband, for that wife.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; When I'm talking about the grace of God,
[1:47:28] I'm not limited. It is not limited.
[1:47:38] God can change everything
[1:47:42] if you just get yourself to accept that
[1:47:47] unmmerited favor.
[1:47:50] You shut the door.
[1:47:53] Let me just get here.
[1:47:56] God's grace can prosper any person
[1:48:02] even in the land of their affliction
[1:48:07] because it's unmmerited favor.
[1:48:12] Joseph said, "He has prospered me in the
[1:48:16] land of my affliction."
[1:48:19] The end time message, all of it and
[1:48:22] everything in it and all that it does,
[1:48:26] it's by the grace of God because it is
[1:48:29] the message of grace.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister,
[1:48:41] my dear friends, God's favor
[1:48:45] byasses all your weaknesses.
[1:48:52] That's what troubles the devil
[1:48:55] when God does this
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; and says partake
[1:49:01] and the devil.
[1:49:05] How comes?
[1:49:10] How can it be?
[1:49:23] He looked beyond
[1:49:26] my faults and saw my need.
[1:49:30] I shall forever
[1:49:33] keep my eyes to Calary.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; God is favor bypasses your weaknesses
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; and it bypasses your inabilities.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Your inabilities.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, you have weaknesses. Yes, you have
[1:49:52] inabilities. But God is favor bypasses
[1:49:55] all that.
[1:49:57] That's why we sang that. Let the weak
[1:49:59] say I am strong. Let the poor say I am
[1:50:02] rich because of what the Lord has done
[1:50:06] for me. And the prophet says grace is
[1:50:09] what God does for you.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; He favors you. That's what he does for
[1:50:18] you.
[1:50:22] who has a testimony
[1:50:25] that you can stand today each one of us
[1:50:27] and say brother Julius where I am today
[1:50:31] I am what I am by the grace of God.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Now let me see you are going to become
[1:50:39] what you want to be by the grace of God.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; God's grace is perfect in weakness.
[1:50:49] He looks beyond all your faults and he
[1:50:52] sees your need.
[1:50:57] If you tell pastor
[1:51:00] pastor this this daughter of yours
[1:51:02] really this and that do you think that
[1:51:06] daughter will come to pastor and says
[1:51:08] daddy this and that and he says this one
[1:51:11] they told me even the things you do are
[1:51:13] bad and I'm not giving you he will just
[1:51:18] say oh really sorry just get
[1:51:22] what is that
[1:51:25] he bypasses all is and sees the need.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Don't be there and have a need and you
[1:51:35] think yourself not fit for that need and
[1:51:38] you think yourself not worthy for that
[1:51:40] promise.
[1:51:43] You are not worthy to begin with. What
[1:51:46] brought you in these promises to be
[1:51:48] partakers of them was God's grace.
[1:51:57] He saw my need.
[1:52:00] My sins are gone
[1:52:03] because progress provided a ransom.
[1:52:09] You may be the least
[1:52:12] of all,
[1:52:13] but don't despise yourself
[1:52:19] when no one expects anything good out of
[1:52:22] you.
[1:52:24] like Nazareus
[1:52:27] says, "Can anything good come out of
[1:52:29] Nazareus?"
[1:52:31] Says, "Can anything good come out of
[1:52:33] brother Elijah?"
[1:52:36] Would you have an Elijah here?
[1:52:44] God likes such kind of situations.
[1:52:49] He wants to use the unusual to do
[1:52:52] something unusual
[1:52:54] because God himself is unusual.
[1:52:58] Because God himself is unusual.
[1:53:04] Let us go to Matthew chapter 2
[1:53:12] verse 6.
[1:53:14] Oh, all right. Let me say Micah chapter
[1:53:16] 5 here says Micah 5:2
[1:53:21] But thou Betham a flatter
[1:53:24] thou thou though be little among the
[1:53:27] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[1:53:31] he come forth unto me that's to be ruler
[1:53:33] in Israel whose going forth have been
[1:53:37] from old from of old from everlasting.
[1:53:41] Matthew 2:6 says,
[1:53:49] "And thou Betham in the land of Judah,
[1:53:54] art not the least among the princes of
[1:53:57] Israel, for out of thee shall come a
[1:54:01] governor that shall rule my people
[1:54:03] Israel."
[1:54:04] He says, "Beth of Judah, are you not the
[1:54:08] least?
[1:54:10] Bethlehem was the least, but it says out
[1:54:13] of you shall come a governor.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I'm saying you might be the least, but
[1:54:21] that's God's grace.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; God is favor magnifies little people.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; He said he told David, I have made you a
[1:54:33] name like one of the great men of the
[1:54:35] earth.
[1:54:37] That was a God's grace. Now you that one
[1:54:42] someone to have a great name in the
[1:54:43] earth it should not st anyone God does
[1:54:46] God himself says he made David a great
[1:54:48] name like one of the great men of the
[1:54:50] earth
[1:54:53] you each one of you you like it
[1:54:56] I like it too like it too
[1:55:00] sincere you like it but God's grace is
[1:55:03] what does it
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; and for a good purpose then he says It's
[1:55:09] that kind of grace that rewrites our
[1:55:14] story.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Our calling and our election is greater
[1:55:30] than the number of your years on the
[1:55:31] earth.
[1:55:35] So it can't come to a point whereby it
[1:55:38] is like as if
[1:55:40] your your the answer to your problem is
[1:55:42] older than your problem.
[1:55:53] Shall we stand on our feet?
[1:55:57] Unmmerited favor. You you there is this
[1:56:00] song which says here
[1:56:02] the song says,
[1:56:10] "What a gift of grace is Jesus my
[1:56:13] redeemer."
[1:56:15] Shall we sing it together? Someone who
[1:56:16] knows it.
[1:56:18] What a gift of grace.
[1:56:23] Awesome.
[1:56:28] There is no more
[1:56:31] for heaven now to give.
[1:56:36] He is my joy,
[1:56:39] my righteousness
[1:56:41] and freedom.
[1:56:44] You know it. My st You have it.
[1:56:48] My deep and boundless peace.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; To this I hope
[1:56:57] my hope is only Jesus.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my life
[1:57:07] is holy but to him.
[1:57:13] Oh, how strange and divine
[1:57:18] I can see.
[1:57:21] All is mine, yet no one but through
[1:57:27] Christ
[1:57:28] in me.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; The night is done,
[1:57:36] but I am not forsaken.
[1:57:42] For by the Messiah,
[1:57:45] the Savior here we
[1:57:52] live our own
[1:57:54] in weakness and rejoiceing
[1:58:00] for in my need.
[1:58:04] His power is his plain.
[1:58:09] Oh,
[1:58:10] I own
[1:58:13] my sheer will defend me
[1:58:19] through the deepest
[1:58:23] valley.
[1:58:29] All the
[1:58:31] us
[1:58:41] through Christ.
[1:58:47] No faith I dread.
[1:58:50] I know I am forgiving.
[1:58:56] a future.
[1:58:59] The price he has been paid
[1:59:05] for Jesus bled
[1:59:09] and suffered for my battle.
[1:59:15] And he was ready
[1:59:18] to open the door again to his home.
[1:59:25] I hope
[1:59:28] my sin has been defeated.
[1:59:33] Oh Jesus now
[1:59:37] the
[1:59:39] is my
[1:59:44] chain are released.
[1:59:48] I can sing I am free yet
[2:00:00] with every breath with every breath.
[2:00:05] I long to follow Jesus
[2:00:11] for he has said
[2:00:14] that he will bring me home
[2:00:21] and day by day
[2:00:24] I know he will renew me
[2:00:30] until I stand
[2:00:33] with joy.
[2:00:35] before
[2:00:37] to this I hope
[2:00:40] to this I hope
[2:00:43] my hope is on the Jesus.
[2:00:49] All thy glory
[2:00:53] ever
[2:00:55] to
[2:00:59] the grace
[2:01:01] is coming
[2:01:03] still my name
[2:01:06] shall
[2:01:09] not
[2:01:11] through Christ
[2:01:14] in me.
[2:01:29] No.
[2:01:52] Good.
[2:01:53] Could you say
[2:02:06] no?
[2:02:08] No.
[2:02:11] So
[2:02:15] a full
[2:02:37] one say
[2:02:45] Oh
[2:02:49] my
[2:02:50] god.
[2:03:22] No

[2:24:30] you know, as we sing this song, friends,
[2:24:33] we are preparing our hearts for what
[2:24:36] we're just about to do. You know the
[2:24:38] Bible says Jesus said, "Do this in
[2:24:42] remembrance of me."
[2:24:45] Every time we come at the communion
[2:24:46] table, we don't want to come lightly,
[2:24:49] but we want to come remembering his
[2:24:51] death,
[2:24:53] remembering his resurrection,
[2:24:55] remembering the outpouring of the Holy
[2:24:57] Spirit, what he has done for us.
[2:25:03] Foreign
[2:25:20] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[2:25:53] Hallelujah.
[2:26:02] Montana

[2:26:37] Come on.
[2:26:48] Mang
[2:27:14] come
[2:27:29] Amen. Hallelujah. If brother Henry can
[2:27:33] come and help me in this second session.
[2:27:46] Amen. You may be seated maybe for just a
[2:27:49] moment.
[2:28:05] just the pianist.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:28:13] How many are happy to be here today?
[2:28:17] Amen.
[2:28:24] speaking of communion
[2:28:28] and while I'm speaking these deacons can
[2:28:30] make themselves ready to please come.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:28:44] Julius has preached a masterpiece on
[2:28:45] grace.
[2:28:52] That's why we are here
[2:28:55] because of his grace.
[2:28:57] And in a message communion,
[2:29:01] brother Bam says it is not given for the
[2:29:02] purpose that many people think it is.
[2:29:10] Some denominations do it as they call it
[2:29:13] the last rights.
[2:29:18] You know when someone is going is about
[2:29:20] to die they quickly call for
[2:29:29] you know they call the last rights
[2:29:34] I don't know what is that
[2:29:39] and so it's taught by some denomination
[2:29:42] you know that it pertains to salvation
[2:29:48] Communion does not pertain to salvation.
[2:29:53] Communion does not I think in fact you
[2:29:55] can call it a messa instead of
[2:30:00] communion does not give you salvation
[2:30:05] whether you take it in your death or
[2:30:08] what it does not have nothing to do with
[2:30:09] your salvation.
[2:30:15] It is a commemoration.
[2:30:21] Can we say amen?
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in in the gospel he said this
[2:30:25] do in remembrance of me.
[2:30:30] Not not it leaning or pointing to
[2:30:33] salvation
[2:30:37] but it's in commemoration of a finished
[2:30:39] work
[2:30:42] that has already been done in you.
[2:30:46] What we have already heard brother
[2:30:48] Julius preaching
[2:30:50] it's already done in you by the Holy
[2:30:52] Spirit.
[2:30:56] It's a commemoration.
[2:31:05] So you're not saved because you're a
[2:31:08] good person.
[2:31:11] You're saved because Christ chose you.
[2:31:14] No man seeks God.
[2:31:17] God seeks man.
[2:31:20] See Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[2:31:22] except my father draws him first."
[2:31:27] And if we could stop for a few moments
[2:31:29] and realize the great importance of that
[2:31:32] one thing,
[2:31:37] that it was God who chose you,
[2:31:41] not willing that you should perish,
[2:31:45] but give to you the opportunity and
[2:31:46] called you and elected you to be his
[2:31:48] servant.
[2:31:52] What could be more precious than that?
[2:31:56] Without you having a choice,
[2:32:00] it would be a total totally impossible
[2:32:03] for any man to seek God.
[2:32:08] For he is by nature is a sinner man.
[2:32:13] And he has nothing within him to give a
[2:32:16] desire to serve God.
[2:32:21] And a sinner is satisfied as a sinner.
[2:32:25] because his nature is to be a sinner.
[2:32:29] So we are all born in sin,
[2:32:32] shaped iniquity,
[2:32:34] we come to the world speaking lies
[2:32:37] by nature, children of disobedience,
[2:32:40] without God, without a hope,
[2:32:44] the wrath of God are binding on us.
[2:32:48] And by the loving grace of Christ,
[2:32:52] God in his sovereign grace
[2:32:55] and his omnipotence
[2:32:58] knocks at the at your heart and gives
[2:33:00] you the blessed opportunity.
[2:33:06] Amen. And how did he knock? By the
[2:33:08] preaching of the word
[2:33:11] and turned you around
[2:33:14] and said sent you up on the road.
[2:33:17] How could you turn that down?
[2:33:21] It changes your whole desire,
[2:33:25] turns you around
[2:33:27] and starts you the other way.
[2:33:31] Oh, you will be silly to the world,
[2:33:35] but you will be blessed and in the sight
[2:33:37] of God.
[2:33:41] Amen.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that do hung and thirst
[2:33:45] for righteousness.
[2:33:48] for they shall be filled.
[2:33:51] Amen. God by his amazing grace.
[2:33:56] Not as it was God who called you,
[2:34:00] you had no will to call.
[2:34:03] You could have had no desire to call
[2:34:07] because your nature was completely
[2:34:09] contrary to it.
[2:34:14] So then how does God call you?
[2:34:17] God calls you by election.
[2:34:22] When does he elect or choose you?
[2:34:27] This is the amazing part.
[2:34:29] God chooses you or God elected you or
[2:34:31] chose you.
[2:34:35] In him
[2:34:38] before there was anything.
[2:34:41] So if there was nothing,
[2:34:44] what did he choose from?
[2:34:46] There was only him to choose from.
[2:34:50] So he chose a part of him. Hallelujah.
[2:34:55] That's why brother Julius as he was
[2:34:56] preaching he said
[2:34:59] he read this scripture
[2:35:01] very powerful scripture
[2:35:04] and let me just remind you of it.
[2:35:07] Amen. Praise God. Isn't the Lord good
[2:35:11] friend?
[2:35:14] Listen. He read this scripture.
[2:35:18] And it says this.
[2:35:22] I just quoted it here. By for by grace
[2:35:25] are ye saved
[2:35:28] through faith
[2:35:31] and that not of yourselves.
[2:35:34] It is the gift of God,
[2:35:39] not of works.
[2:35:42] Meaning we are not saved by our works.
[2:35:46] Otherwise we should be boasting
[2:35:49] that I am better than so and so and so.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; So you should never look at your brother
[2:35:54] Jesus and think that you are better than
[2:35:56] them.
[2:36:00] We are all bad.
[2:36:02] We are all the same.
[2:36:05] But there's only one worthy
[2:36:08] and that is Jesus Christ.
[2:36:10] And so it's not of our works,
[2:36:13] lest any man should boss
[2:36:16] for we are his workmanship
[2:36:21] created in
[2:36:24] Hallelujah. Created in
[2:36:28] Christ Jesus.
[2:36:32] Meaning
[2:36:34] what we are was created
[2:36:38] where
[2:36:39] in Christ
[2:36:42] so that when he died we died too. When
[2:36:45] he rose we rose too.
[2:36:48] That's why we keep taking communion
[2:36:51] to remember we are a part of him.
[2:36:55] We are his workmanship
[2:36:59] created in Christ Jesus,
[2:37:02] not in our mother's womb.
[2:37:04] In Christ because you see, we were lost.
[2:37:09] Christ redeemed us.
[2:37:11] And so in him
[2:37:14] we were created.
[2:37:17] So now we are a new creation.
[2:37:20] And now he says, "We were created in him
[2:37:24] in Christ Jesus
[2:37:27] unto good works
[2:37:32] which God has before
[2:37:36] ordained that we should walk in those
[2:37:38] good works."
[2:37:42] So there is no nothing can hinder us
[2:37:48] to walk in those good works.
[2:37:51] of faith.
[2:37:55] That's why brother brother I love the
[2:37:57] sermon he preached
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; when he reached that part where brother
[2:38:01] was saying there's something upsetting
[2:38:03] you this and that this and that
[2:38:07] he said leave it alone
[2:38:10] forget about it
[2:38:13] I've tried to do this
[2:38:16] I'm trying stop trying
[2:38:21] because already you are ordained
[2:38:24] to walk in those good works
[2:38:26] whether you want it or not.
[2:38:30] So you just keep stop trying.
[2:38:33] Come hear the word. If you could change
[2:38:37] yourself, why are you here to begin
[2:38:39] with?
[2:38:42] No one can change ourel
[2:38:45] but the word can change us.
[2:38:47] So keep coming and hear the word.
[2:38:50] Amen. All of a sudden something will
[2:38:53] happen. Amen. So we are ordained to walk
[2:38:56] in those good works.
[2:39:00] Say I am ordained to walk in those good
[2:39:02] works.
[2:39:05] Amen.
[2:39:07] Praise God. So many of the churches has
[2:39:10] closed they have closed communion.
[2:39:16] That is just to their own church when
[2:39:18] they have their communion.
[2:39:22] but here we are not a denomination.
[2:39:26] We have an open communion for all.
[2:39:32] Of course, when we say all,
[2:39:35] we mean those who are who are believers,
[2:39:39] baptized
[2:39:41] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:39:44] much water, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:47] Those are the only ones that should
[2:39:50] partake of the
[2:39:52] Amen. And so, so all of them.
[2:39:56] All of them. For we believe that every
[2:39:59] believer
[2:40:02] has a right to the table of the Lord,
[2:40:06] to fellowship around the good things of
[2:40:08] God
[2:40:11] with every believer.
[2:40:13] Amen. Regardless of creed, color, or
[2:40:15] whatever he may be.
[2:40:18] that all have been made to drink of the
[2:40:20] selfs same blessing Christ.
[2:40:26] Amen. Amen.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I saw you know deacons you
[2:40:30] know I don't know whether you noticed
[2:40:31] last time you know
[2:40:34] please keep the children little children
[2:40:35] away from this
[2:40:39] let let it be done by people who are
[2:40:42] like I said you know born again and
[2:40:44] believers
[2:40:47] 1 Corinthians 11:23 says,
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that
[2:40:53] which I also delivered unto you."
[2:40:59] That the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:41:02] which he was betrayed took bread.
[2:41:10] And when he had given thanks, he broke
[2:41:12] it and he said, "Take it and this is my
[2:41:14] body which is broken for you. This do in
[2:41:16] remembrance of me."
[2:41:25] Is that a man? After the same manner
[2:41:28] also you took the cup which when he had
[2:41:30] sapped, saying, "This cup is the new
[2:41:33] testament in my blood.
[2:41:40] This do ye as often as ye drink it in
[2:41:43] remembrance of me.
[2:41:46] For as often as you eat this bread and
[2:41:49] drink this cup,
[2:41:54] we do show the Lord is death till he
[2:41:57] come.
[2:42:02] That's why we should not do this thing
[2:42:03] just just for the sake of doing.
[2:42:08] You have to you have to be consecrated.
[2:42:12] Do it reverently.
[2:42:15] I remember I think it was brother who
[2:42:17] told a story
[2:42:19] some you know boys who went and made fun
[2:42:21] and you know took some uh whatever it is
[2:42:23] and um some beers or whatever and then
[2:42:25] went up in in a certain hotel and they
[2:42:27] said they're taking communion
[2:42:37] and and you know they were struck
[2:42:40] so you don't play around
[2:42:43] with the word of God.
[2:42:45] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[2:42:48] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[2:42:50] unworthily
[2:42:55] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:42:57] the of the Lord.
[2:43:02] But let a man examine himself
[2:43:07] and so let him eat of that bread
[2:43:11] and drink of that cup.
[2:43:14] For he that eateth and drinkketh
[2:43:16] unworthily
[2:43:19] eatth and drinkkeeth damnation
[2:43:24] to himself,
[2:43:26] not discerning the Lord's book.
[2:43:31] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[2:43:34] among you and many sleep.
[2:43:41] So you see he tells you what happens if
[2:43:43] you drink unworthily
[2:43:47] because you know many become weak and
[2:43:51] others die.
[2:43:54] But the opposite is true.
[2:43:58] You examined yourself
[2:44:00] and you take it
[2:44:02] then it's going to be healing for you.
[2:44:06] If you're weak, you it's going to be
[2:44:08] strength for you.
[2:44:10] Remember the the children of Israel took
[2:44:12] it when they were going to to to go
[2:44:14] through the uh the desert,
[2:44:18] going to the promised land. And the
[2:44:21] Bible says, not even one of them,
[2:44:25] you know, um Shuh became old.
[2:44:31] We don't see them. Of course, they had
[2:44:32] no factories in the desert
[2:44:35] 40 years.
[2:44:37] No cloth was changed.
[2:44:40] Imagine
[2:44:42] that was supernatural,
[2:44:45] supernatural.
[2:44:47] You see, they took communion before
[2:44:48] that.
[2:44:51] So the opposite is also true. Healing
[2:44:52] and strength and and and and and good
[2:44:56] life.
[2:45:00] For if we would judge ourselves,
[2:45:04] we should not be judged.
[2:45:06] But when we are judged, we are chestned
[2:45:09] of the Lord and we should not be
[2:45:12] condemned with the with the world.
[2:45:16] Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come
[2:45:18] together to eat,
[2:45:21] t one for the other for another. And if
[2:45:24] any man hunger,
[2:45:26] let him if any man hunger,
[2:45:30] let him eat at home,
[2:45:32] that ye come not together unto
[2:45:34] condemnation,
[2:45:37] He did not come to quench your hunger.
[2:45:41] If you are hungry,
[2:45:43] wait until you go home.
[2:45:47] But we have just come to do this in
[2:45:49] commemoration for our Lord Jesus.
[2:45:55] When he come together, when therefore my
[2:45:57] brethren, when you come together to eat,
[2:46:01] t one for another.
[2:46:04] If any man hunger,
[2:46:06] let him eat at home that he come not
[2:46:09] together unto condemnation
[2:46:12] and the rest I will set in order when I
[2:46:14] come.
[2:46:17] Amen.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can have one of the my
[2:46:20] brother Enoch, if you can uh you know
[2:46:22] pray over the bread
[2:46:28] as they're preparing to break it.
[2:46:40] Crystalchech.
[2:47:19] Amen.
[2:47:21] Amen.
[2:47:22] &gt;&gt; As the deacons are breaking the bread,
[2:47:23] let us sing worthy is the lamb.
[2:47:30] Worthy,
[2:47:34] worthy,
[2:47:40] worthy
[2:47:43] is the lamb
[2:47:45] that was slain.
[2:47:50] Worthy,
[2:47:55] worthy.
[2:48:01] Worthy
[2:48:04] is the lamb
[2:48:07] that was slain.
[2:48:12] Worthy,
[2:48:14] worthy,
[2:48:18] worthy,
[2:48:21] worthy,
[2:48:25] worthy,
[2:48:27] worthy
[2:48:30] is the lamb
[2:48:34] that will save.
[2:48:39] worthy.
