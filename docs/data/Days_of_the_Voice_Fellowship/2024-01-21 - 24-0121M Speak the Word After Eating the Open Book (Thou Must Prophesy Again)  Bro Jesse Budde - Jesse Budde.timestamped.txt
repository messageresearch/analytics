[54:55] by more than 450
[54:59] people and uh these were from all over
[55:05] Uganda we had some from West n West we
[55:08] had some from uh the
[55:12] east in the parts of
[55:16] Toro
[55:20] Ginger we also had some from the the
[55:24] s others came from
[55:27] carja is really far
[55:29] away I know that because I've been there
[55:31] several
[55:32] times so the Brethren were able to come
[55:35] and it was they said it was a very
[55:37] wonderful time
[55:39] for we also had some from the south
[55:42] in I don't know whether is south or
[55:46] west they say West but it looks like
[55:50] South and some from um you know buo as
[55:54] well other
[55:56] places
[55:58] Tiana C even so really it was well
[56:01] attended from all across the
[56:06] country but also we had many who had
[56:11] represented other
[56:13] countries we had our sister H from South
[56:18] Africa brother Taz and his wife from New
[56:22] Zealand Zealand we also had
[56:27] uh our brother our brother Prince from
[56:31] zimb Prince
[56:34] Hallelujah and I've asked by Prince to
[56:36] do for us one song this
[56:38] morning how many would love that praise
[56:41] the Lord amen so we before we invite the
[56:44] preacher you are going to sing for us
[56:46] just after
[56:47] this but the prince is a I always use
[56:50] the word is a choice young
[56:53] man and
[56:55] so we we we are blessed to have him
[56:58] during this time he ministered actually
[57:00] for us here on on
[57:04] Wednesday and it was a
[57:06] blessing it was a
[57:09] blessing so we also of course had
[57:12] brothers from
[57:14] Ethiopia and his
[57:17] wife still within the country on
[57:20] Wednesday he was ministering at
[57:23] speckled
[57:25] and then on uh on Friday he was
[57:28] ministering at
[57:30] lifeboard Life Ministries and this
[57:33] weekend theyve traveled to
[57:36] Ginger be with Pastor
[57:39] Ste and we we're happy to share the
[57:42] ministry God has given to us with
[57:46] others that because the gift when God
[57:48] gives a man a
[57:51] gift it's not really for his local
[57:53] assembly only
[57:56] the gift is for the entire body of
[57:59] Christ that's why as pastors we keep
[58:01] sharing
[58:03] Ministries and today we are going to
[58:05] share another
[58:06] [Music]
[58:07] gift Jess from
[58:10] bud that's another gift of
[58:12] God and so when God gives a man a
[58:16] gift is not for his local assembly
[58:19] only for his place where he comes from
[58:23] for the entire body of Jesus
[58:26] and so our pastor is blessing Ginger
[58:30] today and also the meetings we are
[58:32] streamed actually all over the
[58:36] world yeah all over the world uh Pastor

[58:51] USA and they send their greetings and
[58:53] regards

[59:00] checking meetings we streamed from
[59:01] across
[59:05] Africa some in Europe others in in the
[59:10] USA Canada and they send their greetings
[59:14] I may not be able to mention everyone

[1:09:56] Andrew so that's another big thing we
[1:09:58] had for the month of
[1:10:00] January especially in our fellowship

[1:10:09] be our first
[1:10:14] wedding born
[1:10:16] here in the
[1:10:19] church so we need to put all our
[1:10:22] strength
[1:10:24] all our
[1:10:25] muscles all our
[1:10:27] money and encourage them so that they
[1:10:29] can
[1:10:31] prosper you know when you encourage
[1:10:33] someone to
[1:10:35] prosper you also
[1:10:38] Prosper now I remember in the first
[1:10:39] church that I
[1:10:41] pastored in Ethiopia if we had about 10
[1:10:45] weddings all born from our
[1:10:48] Min and I can tell you by the time I
[1:10:51] left we had encouraged them to prosper
[1:10:56] prospered us
[1:10:58] also you encourage
[1:11:00] them how do you encourage someone going
[1:11:02] to get
[1:11:04] married different
[1:11:06] ways you young
[1:11:10] men be there for
[1:11:13] them go ask brother
[1:11:16] Andrew what do you
