Father in the name of Jesus, we we give you thanks, Lord, for bringing us all through this year to this season, Lord, to this session, Lord, as we are now closing in to end the year. Father, we thank you, Lord, even for enabling us, a dear father, to be in this communion service tonight. Father, we want to commit your word into your hands, Lord, our precious brother Julius that is going to minister to us the word. We pray that you will anoint him father and use him oh God to benefit uh your saints this evening. We thank you Lord for granting unto them a traveling masses himself and brother Shalom all the way uh from uh from from Masaka. Father we thank you Lord for for this service and even those that you have enabled to be here tonight. Lord, we have come to remember the sacrifice, the ultimate sacrifice that you did for us when you died for us. When you died and rose again, Father Lord, you did it for us. Not for yourself, but for us, we did not deserve it, but by your grace, oh God, you have given unto us the righteousness of God. And Father, we now commit this service into your hands, the preaching of the word into your hands. come and just take over. Come and do what you only can do. Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you saints. I just wanted to um give you the order of service. So, uh we are going to begin with communion. We'll have the word and we just straight away go to communion after that. And then afterwards uh I think it will be then about um about 10 or or 10 or 10:30 then we can have the session for the crossover night. We're going to have a wonderful time. Amen. I'll speak to you. I I know I've not preached for a while but I I'll be preaching the second session of the crossover. Uh and then after that uh if you have any of course we we expect that if you have testimonies or special songs you've given it to brother shalom or you can give it to brother shalom. If you have testimonies or special songs you want to speak it yourself or whatever a testimony you can give him a written note so that you will be called called in uh after the preaching of the word. That should be uh probably after 1 12 after 30 minutes after midnight something like that. So we will be here for as long as we have testimonies uh that we want to tell. So I'm expecting that the service might end around uh 1 1 a.m. and if there are people who can travel home they'll be free to do that. But we are going to have some time of the word of prayer of songs of worship communion. How many are looking forward to this night? Amen. and it's going to be a really really wonderful night in his presence. So, uh, brother Julius and, uh, brother Shalom have just come in. They just arrived as the service was starting all the way from What's the name of the place? Brother Shalomi. Loi. Okay. Uh, that's where exactly. Is it in Masaka district? Ah, okay. So uh they just came all the way from Levitaki. It's been a long journey. I think you started you started it in the morning, right? Yeah. But we thank God for who has given them. Still just back from the mission trip. And you know when I just back from the mission trip, you're all anointed and all on fire. So I told him, brother Julius, let's just give us the communion.

Father, we thank you for the great things that you have done for us. We thank you for your grace and mercy. We thank you, Father, for offering up your son when he died upon the cross to pay the debt for my iniquities. Lord Jesus Christ, you did not turn away, but you took your our sins upon yourself, Lord, that we might become the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; And today, Father, we can stand and declare and confess that we are the sons and daughters of the living God because we have been accepted in the beloved. And father I'm thankful to you Lord for this hour that you have granted unto us. So father sharing your word having fellowship around your word in your divine presence. Father he said where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be in their midst. Take the flesh aside. Take every person aside. Circumcise the the lips that speak the ears that hear and the heart that it may believe. Lord may the Holy Spirit take the word. Lord add life to it and give the people the life of the word in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father we thank you. We give you honor. We give you glory. We give you the praises. We we accept you Lord. We we receive you. We welcome you father that you may come Lord Jesus and have full and total preeminence that I may decrease that you may increase and every person father may see you through the preaching of the word in the name of the lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Thank you so much dear pastor for supporting us to go to masaka there and we had a really wonderful time in the presence of God. The brethren they sent their greetings and they thanked you pastor so much. Amen. And uh I thank God that he gave us janimis we came back safely. Yes, I mean shall we go to the reading of the word? Okay, let us read from 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verses 9 to 10. The scripture says 1 Corinthians chapter 15 9-10 it says for I am the least of the apostles that I am not meant to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am. Then he says, "And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all." Then he says, "Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." Amen. Then in Galatians chapter 2 he says verse 20-21. Galatians chapter 2 verse 20-21 he says I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the son of God which loved me and gave himself for me. Amen. May take the comfort of your seat. God bless you. May God bless the reading of his word. Amen. just uh open your hearts and we share something here that will bring us closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. Whenever I come to church, we just want to make sure that we we get a step closer to the Lord Jesus Christ because the closer we get, the closer we get, then the rapture will have to take place. So here the scripture says that uh uh 1 Corinthians chapter 15 9-10 he said that for I am the least of the apostles that I will not meet to be called an apostle because I persecuted the church of God. I was trying to adjust from preaching the interpreter to without the interpreter. That's why I silenced a bit. Yeah. So it says he that Paul is saying here that he is the list of the apostles because why he calls himself the list of the apostles because he persecuted the church of God. And then he says but but by the grace of God I am what I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he talks about his then he says that and this grace that God bestowed upon me was not in vain. Listen carefully when the grace is given it's not in vain. Then he says he labored more abundantly. Then he says, "Yet not I but the grace of God which was with me." Then he says, "I am crucified with Christ, yet I live." Then he says, "Yet not I but Christ that liveth in me because he loved me." My subject is but by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; But by the grace of God. The word grace means unmmerited favor. Favor that is given that you do not deserve. Favor that is given that you have not worked for. favor that is given regardless of who you are. &gt;&gt; That's God's grace. Unmmerited favor. God is grace. Paul is Paul here is saying that I am the least of the apostles because I persecuted the church but I am an apostle today by the grace of God. that but changed the story says but by the grace of God so grace comes to the list the list of men it comes to the undeserving when I say grace I want you to keep that word unmmerited favor because I want to talk about that unmmerited favor without merit it is given whenever we come to God. I want you to listen. Whenever we come to God, none of us should ever make a mistake of coming to God for justice. For justice. We should come to God for mercy &gt;&gt; because justice is given according to your deeds. I want your mercy for if I come for justice I cannot stand. Justice is given according to your deeds but mercy is given regardless of your deeds. The Bible even says in Isaiah 40 64 verse6 that even our righteous deeds are filthy rugs before God. We are talking about unmmerited favor. Favor without merit. Favor that you have not worked for. Let us go together. He says our righteous deeds are filthy rugs before God. Luke chapter 18 vers 9 to 14 he says he says and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others. He had to get a parable because when he discerned in a congregation that he had he saw some that trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others. It says the two men went up into the temple to pray. The one a Pharisee, the other a publican. The Pharisees stood and prayed. He stood in the temple. And he prayed thus with himself. God, I thank thee. So confidence. Oh. God, I thank thee that I'm not as one. I'm not as other many are. Extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican, I thank thee that I'm not like one of them. &gt;&gt; I fast twice in the week. I fast twice in the week. I give tightness of all that I possess. See, he's claiming his righteousness. And the publican standing up off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote up his breast, saying, "Go be merciful to me a sinner." I tell you this man that went down to his house, this man, this publican went down to his house justified rather than the other. God's grace is the justifier of him that believes on Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; What gives you justice is the grace of God. &gt;&gt; For it is by faith, says the scripture, through it is by grace through faith that we are saved and not of your own, lest any man should boast. In the message of grace, the prophet says the message of grace has been tampered under the feet of many until it is become a disgrace. What grace does no I'm going ahead of myself. Let us let us go here. He says, "The message of grace has been trampled under the feet of men until it has become a disgrace. You forget. You forget until you start to think that it's your own righteousness. and it becomes a disgrace. He says and some now it's me saying that and some think that uh since God we are under grace they they do all kinds of things. We don't want that. We want to understand this. He said, "Some of them runs into eternal security, some run into everything, but the true message of grace remains the same." &gt;&gt; And there is where Satan tries to knock it out from the church. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. The prophet says, "Grace is what God does for you." &gt;&gt; And works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Listen, grace is known by its works &gt;&gt; because grace produces the works. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 28-10 says, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God. &gt;&gt; Not of works, lest any man should boast." Now listen verse 10. For we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Created in Christ Jesus &gt;&gt; unto good works. &gt;&gt; Listen these good works. He says which God has before ordained that we should work in them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We when grace brought us in, God had already ordained the works that we should do. &gt;&gt; The works that we should walk in were ordained before you even came in. So the works that you do is a product of God's grace, &gt;&gt; not your own. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen brother, sister, the prophet has got that had to make it that clear. He had to make that clear that grace is what God does for you. &gt;&gt; It's what God does for you. Amen. Now we want to see how much can this grace go. How much can this unmmerited favor sit? Of course, we are not going to to sit right to the end of it because it you can't stretch it to limit. It's so unlimited. So I want you to hear brothers and sisters regardless of where you are and what you have done God's grace can do for you. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen now. God's grace doesn't stop on saving you. &gt;&gt; It quickens you. It keeps you &gt;&gt; and it takes you through every step of the way. &gt;&gt; Unmmerited favor is what sustains you. &gt;&gt; You are standing today by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; The songwriter had to sing a song. It is the grace that brought me this far and grace shall lead me home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, am I going to make it to the rapture? How did you make it into Christ? &gt;&gt; How did you make it? That's the same way you're going to make it to the rapture. God is grace is the key that open the way for us into the kingdom of God. It's what paid the price for all of us and the qualification for each one of us. It grace, the grace of God qualified each one of us unto eternal life. It qualifies those that are called. When God called you, he gave you the qualifications for eternal life. &gt;&gt; What you received from the beginning has to take you through to the end. &gt;&gt; Why? The people are fearing what is coming tomorrow. The people fearing our let let us get down here. Let us get down here. You know God fully equips you when he calls you. &gt;&gt; You cannot say you have gone too far that God's grace can't find you. I brother I don't believe that you can go too far my sister that God's grace can't find you. You can't come to a point where you say God's grace has lost me. It cannot lose you. &gt;&gt; You can't get out of the sight of God's grace. &gt;&gt; If God has got you, he has got you. That settles it. &gt;&gt; If he has blessed you, he has blessed you. That settles it. &gt;&gt; You know, God can't reverse that. &gt;&gt; What he has done shall be permanent. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sing that song so much. It shall be permanent what the Lord has done for me. But you are fearing whether you're going to make it in rapture. You are fearing whether you're going to overcome. You are fearing whether you you can stand. You are fearing whether you you can make it a to a Christian life. You are fearing whether you can make it to holiness to perfection. You are fearing whether those weaknesses won't may get you to backslide. You are fearing whether you want to go back to the things you used to do. You are fearing that oh brother the brother may find me when I'm caught up. This thing may overtake me. It shall not overtake you &gt;&gt; because you didn't bring yourself to this. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. When God says you are in, no one can say you out. &gt;&gt; When God is sealed you are in, &gt;&gt; no one can open and say the seal has been broken. &gt;&gt; You are sealed until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; When he opens the door of mercy for you, no man can shut that door. &gt;&gt; It is still open and dripping with blood. We come to a point where we say now I don't know this thing is holding me. I don't know how it can't let me go. Brother even said don't give it attention. &gt;&gt; Someone said brother bra have a stubborn spirit said pray don't give it an attention it will go. &gt;&gt; Now look here the prophet says in the message how can I overcome? Someone says I he says how can I overcome 1963 I have fought brother Brham I have fought they told us to fight the good fight of faith I have fought they told us that character is a victory I have fought Indeed it is. But let me tell you got to understand the whole thing how it works. You know they told us you you cannot uh uh if you don't fight you cannot you cannot win. But he say so I have fought brother. I tried to quit smoking. I tried to let my hair grow out. I have tried to do this. I have tried so hard. Brother, brother, I just can't do it. Now you listen to what the prophet says. You know was always balanced. He said he says don't go this way. Don't go that way. Stay in the middle of the line. He says, "Don't try it anymore. &gt;&gt; Just take a hold of his hand." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "Father, &gt;&gt; you put my hand in the sleeve." &gt;&gt; See, I am just going to give you my hand. &gt;&gt; I am going to walk on Lord. look to you. &gt;&gt; He says it will happen. He will dress you like a real Christian. &gt;&gt; You will be a real Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These works were for ordained. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That we should work in them. It's not about whether I am holding unto Christ. It is about who whether he is holding me. God by his grace predestinated you. It's not about what you are right now or what you have. I'm this. I'm that. This is all I have. God, you know the works were for ordained. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I wonder what do I have to do? I just have to accept that. &gt;&gt; When he says upon your faith add upon uh upon your faith add virtue. knowledge. What do you have to do? Accept it. &gt;&gt; You can't work your way up. God has to work on you and get you up. likes to do that. I want you to listen brothers and sisters. Christianity is God's business. &gt;&gt; Not any man's business. And every Christian is God's work. &gt;&gt; We sing that song. He's still working on me to make me what I have to be. He made the sun, the moon and the stars. He's still working on me. How wonderful he he must be. You see, you are a work of God. We are his workmanship. So it is God working on you. Remember this is God is a business. We are co-workers together with Christ. But this is God's business. He works upon you that you may walk with him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen, church. It is God that brought you in and it is God to keep you in. Amen. &gt;&gt; You will you will struggle with it and you will fail. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; You are trying to work it out. It won't work. It won't work. You'll become a hypocrite. I'm telling you, it's until when we come to a point where we lose the confidence as Christians. But Peter says, "Why look here upon us as if by our own holiness have made this man to walk." They say is faith in the name of Jesus through faith in his name. You see the grace of God, the scripture tells us and it says in 1 Samuel 2:8, he takes a beggar from the dust of the earth and makes him a king. I take it in the physical and in the spiritual. Now let's go in the direction of the spiritual. He took you wherever you were from nothing and made you a kingdom and made you kings and priests &gt;&gt; unto himself. What manner of people ought to it to be? Then John says, "What manner of love has the father bestowed upon us, you know, if you don't, you know, you don't have to feel it, you just have to believe it." You know, I I sometimes I wonder when you try to bring the grace of God and the love of God to a believer, you know, I sometimes I wonder and these are are struggling people, but they they want to do something about it. They just don't want to accept like and you remain in that condition. It's not sweet to them. But he told David, "When you are little in your sight, I chose you to be a king." &gt;&gt; In the sight of David himself, he was little. He saw himself as nothing. But that didn't matter to God. He told Israel they were a little nation but God loved them. He loved them anyhow. And you see Malachi chapter one it says Malachi chapter 1:es 2-3 I have loved you says the Lord Yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved us?" Believers could not see the love of God. And God says, "I have loved you." &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Was not Esau Jacob's brother?" Oh my, says the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau. What good or evil had they done? Nothing. But when God sets his love upon you, he can't reverse it. &gt;&gt; No, God is not an excited lover. But after a few days, that was an excited excitement. But God is not an excited person. It means what he says. He says, "I have loved you." But listen, Deuteronomy 6 to8, Moses told the children of Israel, "The Lord your God, I love this, is going to give you possession over the land. Then he says, let us read it. Let us read it. Deuteronomy 6:7 6 to8 we are talking about unmmerited favor. Deuteronomy 7 6 to8. I want you to stop trying hard. Stop trying hard because you are not changing because you preach a sermon because that you missed something in a sermon. The message was in between those lines and you missed it. Then you try to struggle to get you to that to that what to that mark to the standard of the message that has come to you. But you you you you are just pushing through to get into there. You can't brother sister. I always believe even pastor tells me I count not myself as one that has attained. And Paul said the same thing and the same thing to you. There's something that cries in the heart of a believer yearning for perfection. But many are trying to push themselves to that perfection. You remain a my sister. You try to fight the spirit of rumors. You try to fight the spirit of lies. You try to fight the spirit of lust. You try try hard. I have to make it. You try to push through so hard. It's not hard. It's not hard that it's not that way. God wants a surrendered heart. &gt;&gt; The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you because you are more in number. This fits us just right. Because you are more in number than any people. No sir. For you are the fewest of all people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But because the Lord loved you &gt;&gt; and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers. &gt;&gt; Because their fathers were men of God. It's God. It's God's business to keep the word that he has given to the man of God. It's not my business. It's not any any person's business. It is God's business to see up to that. &gt;&gt; And you see it is coming upon the children because the oath was given to the fathers. He says, "Has the Lord brought you out?" He says, "He loved you. That's why he has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bond men from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Chapter 9 verse 1-6 says here, "O Israel, thou art to pass over Jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself." I don't know whether I I want you to take this grace apply it on the physical and on the spiritual &gt;&gt; it says you are going to possess nations greater and mightier than yourself &gt;&gt; cities great and first upon heaven &gt;&gt; a people great and tall the children of the anarchims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast he had Hey, who can stand before the children of Anch? &gt;&gt; Understand therefore this day that the Lord thy God is he which goes over before you &gt;&gt; as a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; He shall destroy them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't care what has overtaken you. God goes ahead of you as a consuming fire. &gt;&gt; Then he says, &gt;&gt; "And he shall bring them down before thy face." &gt;&gt; Then he says, "So shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has said unto thee." &gt;&gt; He told them, "It is the Lord by whom you shall put them down. Speak not thou, do not speak in thine heart. After that the Lord thy God has cast them out from before thee, saying, for my righteousness, the Lord has brought me into possess this land. because of my righteousness, God has brought me to possess this land. He says, don't even get that in your heart. Paul says, what do you have that you have not received? He says, "But for the wickedness of these nations," you know, I didn't think about this, but I'm seeing, you know, when brother sis, pastor, sister was telling telling us how how what how to behave after God has blessed us after he had seen that God is going to bless many of us. I'm seeing this the same thing God is saying &gt;&gt; how we should behave after he has given us possession over the land. &gt;&gt; What should be in our hearts? Then he says, "But for the because of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord does drive them out from before you, &gt;&gt; not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of your thine heart." does thou go to possess their land? But for the wickedness of these nations, the Lord thy God does drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the Lord swear unto thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. &gt;&gt; He says, not of your righteousness. I'm not depending on that. Listen, God says, "I'm going to do my things for you, but I'm not depending on your righteousness." That should make me happy. &gt;&gt; That is a gift for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a key for me. Says, "Understand therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness." &gt;&gt; God is giving it to you. But understand, it's not because of your righteousness. For thou art a stiff necked people. I got to tell you, brother, you mean I'm stiff necked? You are stubborn sometimes. But God just said, "These are my people." Then Moses says, "Remember that and forget not that you have always provoked the Lord." And I'm telling you the same. Don't forget you always provoke God. But God is not depending on those things. He's not depending on your righteousness. He is depending on his grace and love that he has bestowed upon you. &gt;&gt; How has the Lord loved us? This this is God's grace, brother. When you come to God, don't limit yourself and don't limit God. If you want to ask something from God, you ask something that yourself, you know, for this thing to be done, it will take the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Then God will be glorified. I tell pastor some things but I tell him those things because I want something that can be done and I will say surely this was the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Now for now like some some people to have 1 million in their pocket it doesn't excite them. You see, so such a person now needs to get as something big that the women don't see the love of God in it because they are used to that 1 million. But some of you that 1 million comes I have testimony. Why? Because that's the cross of God. So God to do something that everyone will look upon it yourself. You look upon it and you say surely this was the grace of God. &gt;&gt; You look there's things God does and you say but what what good did I do? I just am not so fit for this. That's now God says unmmerited favor. &gt;&gt; We we don't say you don't have enough qualifications. I'm saying unmmerited favor &gt;&gt; can get you there. It can get you there. God wants testimonies. He loves the testimonies. I've said if you ask for something, ask something bigger that yourself will know and everyone will know that the grace of God has done it. cast out devils without fear knowing this one thing that the grace of God is upon you to do that. There are many people today that think God can't give them something that think that one is for these brothers that one for this minister that one maybe pastor can believe for that because they feel they believe actually not they feel they believe they vile and the worst and undeserving and unworthy. I believe the same. You are not worthy. You are unworthy. But whip not John. He say you are not worthy but Christ is worthy. &gt;&gt; And because he's worthy, you are chosen in him, count yourself worthy of the blessing. Listen, if you count yourself worthy because of Christ, you are not boasting. &gt;&gt; If we boast, I'm rich. If we behave like we are great people because of Christ, you are not boasting. Simala, you are acknowledging that God's grace has picked me far. I was pocketing because that's how most time we boast. So look here you you feel that there is something you are not worthy or fit for. I'm sorry to say this but there is many of us that look at ourselves. I look at myself me which brother can take me which sister can take me. God is not depending on those things. &gt;&gt; God is not depend unmmerited favor. I don't care. Yes, you are not qualified. Yes. Okay, we can see it also. Really, really you are not qualified. You are not qualified. Really, we can see it. But God is favor has qualified you &gt;&gt; for that husband, for that wife. &gt;&gt; When I'm talking about the grace of God, I'm not limited. It is not limited. God can change everything if you just get yourself to accept that unmmerited favor. You shut the door. Let me just get here. God's grace can prosper any person even in the land of their affliction because it's unmmerited favor. Joseph said, "He has prospered me in the land of my affliction." The end time message, all of it and everything in it and all that it does, it's by the grace of God because it is the message of grace. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, my dear friends, God's favor byasses all your weaknesses. That's what troubles the devil when God does this &gt;&gt; and says partake and the devil. How comes? How can it be? He looked beyond my faults and saw my need. I shall forever keep my eyes to Calary. &gt;&gt; God is favor bypasses your weaknesses &gt;&gt; and it bypasses your inabilities. &gt;&gt; Your inabilities. &gt;&gt; Yes, you have weaknesses. Yes, you have inabilities. But God is favor bypasses all that. That's why we sang that. Let the weak say I am strong. Let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for me. And the prophet says grace is what God does for you. &gt;&gt; He favors you. That's what he does for you. who has a testimony that you can stand today each one of us and say brother Julius where I am today I am what I am by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Now let me see you are going to become what you want to be by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; God's grace is perfect in weakness. He looks beyond all your faults and he sees your need. If you tell pastor pastor this this daughter of yours really this and that do you think that daughter will come to pastor and says daddy this and that and he says this one they told me even the things you do are bad and I'm not giving you he will just say oh really sorry just get what is that he bypasses all is and sees the need. &gt;&gt; Don't be there and have a need and you think yourself not fit for that need and you think yourself not worthy for that promise. You are not worthy to begin with. What brought you in these promises to be partakers of them was God's grace. He saw my need. My sins are gone because progress provided a ransom. You may be the least of all, but don't despise yourself when no one expects anything good out of you. like Nazareus says, "Can anything good come out of Nazareus?" Says, "Can anything good come out of brother Elijah?" Would you have an Elijah here? God likes such kind of situations. He wants to use the unusual to do something unusual because God himself is unusual. Because God himself is unusual. Let us go to Matthew chapter 2 verse 6. Oh, all right. Let me say Micah chapter 5 here says Micah 5:2 But thou Betham a flatter thou thou though be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that's to be ruler in Israel whose going forth have been from old from of old from everlasting. Matthew 2:6 says, "And thou Betham in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Israel, for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." He says, "Beth of Judah, are you not the least? Bethlehem was the least, but it says out of you shall come a governor. &gt;&gt; I'm saying you might be the least, but that's God's grace. &gt;&gt; God is favor magnifies little people. &gt;&gt; He said he told David, I have made you a name like one of the great men of the earth. That was a God's grace. Now you that one someone to have a great name in the earth it should not st anyone God does God himself says he made David a great name like one of the great men of the earth you each one of you you like it I like it too like it too sincere you like it but God's grace is what does it &gt;&gt; and for a good purpose then he says It's that kind of grace that rewrites our story. &gt;&gt; Our calling and our election is greater than the number of your years on the earth. So it can't come to a point whereby it is like as if your your the answer to your problem is older than your problem. Shall we stand on our feet? Unmmerited favor. You you there is this song which says here the song says, "What a gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer." Shall we sing it together? Someone who knows it. What a gift of grace. Awesome. There is no more for heaven now to give. He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom. You know it. My st You have it. My deep and boundless peace. &gt;&gt; To this I hope my hope is only Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my life is holy but to him. Oh, how strange and divine I can see. All is mine, yet no one but through Christ in me. &gt;&gt; The night is done, but I am not forsaken. For by the Messiah, the Savior here we live our own in weakness and rejoiceing for in my need. His power is his plain. Oh, I own my sheer will defend me through the deepest valley. All the us through Christ. No faith I dread. I know I am forgiving. a future. The price he has been paid for Jesus bled and suffered for my battle. And he was ready to open the door again to his home. I hope my sin has been defeated. Oh Jesus now the is my chain are released. I can sing I am free yet with every breath with every breath. I long to follow Jesus for he has said that he will bring me home and day by day I know he will renew me until I stand with joy. before to this I hope to this I hope my hope is on the Jesus. All thy glory ever to the grace is coming still my name shall not through Christ in me. No. Good. Could you say no? No. So a full one say Oh my god. No Oh god. Oh, no. Oh, sorry. God for the same. What can wash away my sin? Everybody, I want you to this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, it's not your works. It is his grace. &gt;&gt; And make me nothing but love.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. We may ang Oh, you know, as we sing this song, friends, we are preparing our hearts for what we're just about to do. You know the Bible says Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me." Every time we come at the communion table, we don't want to come lightly, but we want to come remembering his death, remembering his resurrection, remembering the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, what he has done for us. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Hallelujah. Montana Come on. Come on. Mang come Amen. Hallelujah. If brother Henry can come and help me in this second session. Amen. You may be seated maybe for just a moment. just the pianist. &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many are happy to be here today? Amen. speaking of communion and while I'm speaking these deacons can make themselves ready to please come. &gt;&gt; Brother Julius has preached a masterpiece on grace. That's why we are here because of his grace. And in a message communion, brother Bam says it is not given for the purpose that many people think it is. Some denominations do it as they call it the last rights. You know when someone is going is about to die they quickly call for you know they call the last rights I don't know what is that and so it's taught by some denomination you know that it pertains to salvation Communion does not pertain to salvation. Communion does not I think in fact you can call it a messa instead of communion does not give you salvation whether you take it in your death or what it does not have nothing to do with your salvation. It is a commemoration. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Jesus said in in the gospel he said this do in remembrance of me. Not not it leaning or pointing to salvation but it's in commemoration of a finished work that has already been done in you. What we have already heard brother Julius preaching it's already done in you by the Holy Spirit. It's a commemoration. So you're not saved because you're a good person. You're saved because Christ chose you. No man seeks God. God seeks man. See Jesus said, "No man can come to me except my father draws him first." And if we could stop for a few moments and realize the great importance of that one thing, that it was God who chose you, not willing that you should perish, but give to you the opportunity and called you and elected you to be his servant. What could be more precious than that? Without you having a choice, it would be a total totally impossible for any man to seek God. For he is by nature is a sinner man. And he has nothing within him to give a desire to serve God. And a sinner is satisfied as a sinner. because his nature is to be a sinner. So we are all born in sin, shaped iniquity, we come to the world speaking lies by nature, children of disobedience, without God, without a hope, the wrath of God are binding on us. And by the loving grace of Christ, God in his sovereign grace and his omnipotence knocks at the at your heart and gives you the blessed opportunity. Amen. And how did he knock? By the preaching of the word and turned you around and said sent you up on the road. How could you turn that down? It changes your whole desire, turns you around and starts you the other way. Oh, you will be silly to the world, but you will be blessed and in the sight of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that do hung and thirst for righteousness. for they shall be filled. Amen. God by his amazing grace. Not as it was God who called you, you had no will to call. You could have had no desire to call because your nature was completely contrary to it. So then how does God call you? God calls you by election. When does he elect or choose you? This is the amazing part. God chooses you or God elected you or chose you. In him before there was anything. So if there was nothing, what did he choose from? There was only him to choose from. So he chose a part of him. Hallelujah. That's why brother Julius as he was preaching he said he read this scripture very powerful scripture and let me just remind you of it. Amen. Praise God. Isn't the Lord good friend? Listen. He read this scripture. And it says this. I just quoted it here. By for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not of works. Meaning we are not saved by our works. Otherwise we should be boasting that I am better than so and so and so. &gt;&gt; So you should never look at your brother Jesus and think that you are better than them. We are all bad. We are all the same. But there's only one worthy and that is Jesus Christ. And so it's not of our works, lest any man should boss for we are his workmanship created in Hallelujah. Created in Christ Jesus. Meaning what we are was created where in Christ so that when he died we died too. When he rose we rose too. That's why we keep taking communion to remember we are a part of him. We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus, not in our mother's womb. In Christ because you see, we were lost. Christ redeemed us. And so in him we were created. So now we are a new creation. And now he says, "We were created in him in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in those good works." So there is no nothing can hinder us to walk in those good works. of faith. That's why brother brother I love the sermon he preached &gt;&gt; when he reached that part where brother was saying there's something upsetting you this and that this and that he said leave it alone forget about it I've tried to do this I'm trying stop trying because already you are ordained to walk in those good works whether you want it or not. So you just keep stop trying. Come hear the word. If you could change yourself, why are you here to begin with? No one can change ourel but the word can change us. So keep coming and hear the word. Amen. All of a sudden something will happen. Amen. So we are ordained to walk in those good works. Say I am ordained to walk in those good works. Amen. Praise God. So many of the churches has closed they have closed communion. That is just to their own church when they have their communion. but here we are not a denomination. We have an open communion for all. Of course, when we say all, we mean those who are who are believers, baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in much water, filled with the Holy Ghost. Those are the only ones that should partake of the Amen. And so, so all of them. All of them. For we believe that every believer has a right to the table of the Lord, to fellowship around the good things of God with every believer. Amen. Regardless of creed, color, or whatever he may be. that all have been made to drink of the selfs same blessing Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I saw you know deacons you know I don't know whether you noticed last time you know please keep the children little children away from this let let it be done by people who are like I said you know born again and believers 1 Corinthians 11:23 says, &gt;&gt; "For I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you." That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks, he broke it and he said, "Take it and this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." Is that a man? After the same manner also you took the cup which when he had sapped, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, we do show the Lord is death till he come. That's why we should not do this thing just just for the sake of doing. You have to you have to be consecrated. Do it reverently. I remember I think it was brother who told a story some you know boys who went and made fun and you know took some uh whatever it is and um some beers or whatever and then went up in in a certain hotel and they said they're taking communion and and you know they were struck so you don't play around with the word of God. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the of the Lord. But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eatth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's book. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep. So you see he tells you what happens if you drink unworthily because you know many become weak and others die. But the opposite is true. You examined yourself and you take it then it's going to be healing for you. If you're weak, you it's going to be strength for you. Remember the the children of Israel took it when they were going to to to go through the uh the desert, going to the promised land. And the Bible says, not even one of them, you know, um Shuh became old. We don't see them. Of course, they had no factories in the desert 40 years. No cloth was changed. Imagine that was supernatural, supernatural. You see, they took communion before that. So the opposite is also true. Healing and strength and and and and and good life. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chestned of the Lord and we should not be condemned with the with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, t one for the other for another. And if any man hunger, let him if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation, He did not come to quench your hunger. If you are hungry, wait until you go home. But we have just come to do this in commemoration for our Lord Jesus. When he come together, when therefore my brethren, when you come together to eat, t one for another. If any man hunger, let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest I will set in order when I come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can have one of the my brother Enoch, if you can uh you know pray over the bread as they're preparing to break it. Crystalchech. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; As the deacons are breaking the bread, let us sing worthy is the lamb. Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb that was slain. Worthy, worthy. Worthy is the lamb that was slain. Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb that will save. worthy.
