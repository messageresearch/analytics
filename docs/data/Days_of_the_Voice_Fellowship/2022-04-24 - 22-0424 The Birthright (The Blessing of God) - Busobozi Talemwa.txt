why didn't you why didn't hallelujah a.m and this was one of the emails i was writing as mission reports uh this was our second trip into ethiopia again against them ethiopia and i usually write those emails whenever i go out hey everybody company paul and i travel to the city of nazareth on saturday evening we had one question in our mind could something good could something good really come out of nazareth now i will suppose a bit and remind you to those who do not remember and we were ministering to a group of young people [Music] who was one of the first believers and so sister she tried to tell us a few universities that she knew of in the country university area [Music] and so i i i nothing clicked in my heart as she was mentioning the names of this universe but then she mentioned one university university emoji are what does a dharma mean uh she said uh it means nazareth i told her we are going back today that same of nazareth we went to a university called adama university university but we were not allowed to enter the campus because there was a political situation that because of the political situation that was in the area university yeah we met and witnessed to a few people but it wasn't long until we had to switch to the nights until we had to switch to the night of rest at night i the lord was trying to plan things i could take a cable and i did not even have an idea so i narrated a dream to my brethren so we went on to the streets on sunday morning and sister yoda suggested we sit around a certain coffee place i want to have a new to meet and interact with the students since the restaurant was just closed by the campus grounds was closed by the country to the campus so i continue to write the story is very long but the little i can testify next gonna change that julia because we really had a wonderful time with nursing to the fresh fish from the waters of adama university area a young man 21 years old was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ brother baby got a very good revelation of the word now there are many things i told like i wrote in this email i said that the story is very long but you know i realized when the apostles wrote the episodes are the two men with that one they come about work they did not write every little detail they wanted that happened so as i read this i realized oh there is after i had answered by the word he told me can you wait for me for just uh like 30 minutes can you wait here so you rushed to the university hallelujah mother baby has graduated from adaba university organ

neighbor the birthright overseeker you want to do that one more time that's what we're speaking about and so jacob came jacob and jacob was a very wise man it was nice and it was a portage of lentils and uh i want to tell you that this footage of lentils represents all the things that we think we want in this world we are not successful [Applause] longer than usual [Music] the holy spirit we do not tend to see the value of the blessing that we have foreign chapter 21 verse 15. but the mafia will give it to me on the screen if a man have two [Music] his sons to inherit that which he has interviewed that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated move you need to read that out of your bible because that was not a correct translation i'll read verse 16 again then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he has that he may not make the first the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn read versus [Music] [Music] but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated of for the first born by giving him a double portion of all that he has for he is the beginning of his strength and the right of his and the right of the first born is his hallelujah now i know we will go a bit slow in the beginning because i want to teach something very chicken [Applause] [Music] and then he has another child with this one the birthright still remains with the one the child the child of the hatted one the [Music] hallelujah instead of his father when his father is dead oh [Applause] as we will find out later that uh roman numerals was the firstborn child of the children of jacob and he was supposed the priesthood was supposed to be from him i know sometimes when we have to go deep and study the bible some people go off so i want to remember [Music] we as the children of god thank god another cartoon we are actually first born amazing now the prophet says but now japan [Music] we are first born today into the kingdom by the holy ghost now remember that we have read in revelation and zechariah must come right after the tribulation the church of the first born does not go through the tribulation there are coming times if he said that he didn't end up when there will be a tribulation on earth where the beast will control the world she cannot say no there will be a one world order and there will be a new system in the world what you're better when coding in cameroon see there will be a new world order in p.m you know new world financial system new world religion spiritual system new world political system a new world order um makes them feel comfortable in the world that tells them if they prosper and get riches and if they are [Music] this is because they have no understanding [Applause] they can share true church economy true bride of christ we will not go through the tribulation the true bride of christ it it is he that was he that he is and he that is to come back [Music] the resurrection is not a story don't hear it as a story it's going to happen hallelujah amen why do you think we get excited when we hear the word because our inner mind is calling for that supernatural bodies it's not a [Music] hallelujah that body is there the bible says when our bodies are dissolved there is another one waiting there is another body waiting all children of god amen i am when we jesus [Applause] for the coming of the lord praise the name of the lord come here and i will see that the bride oh my god the church of the first born they can't say you're already ever here the firstborn child will not go through the tribulation hallelujah amen but there will be one that will go through the tribulation but i'm glad i'm one of them going in the rapture from them [Music] [Music] the physical and spiritual blessing of our fathers follows us let me tell you church you're hearing me today you lose [Applause] and you have to give them [Music] you buy me tweet that you will not fail why why because we have an anointing as the sons having the best you have been baptized [Applause] it follows you cannot fail [Music] don't see what you're going through now but you know democracy you're not even you barely have money for transport to church listen to the creator mechanism they can feed your family you can't even take care of yourself very well now we're just going to create a video others are giving servants and others millions to the work of god to congratulate me for yourself [Applause] my all look at that [Music] look at them yes is not
