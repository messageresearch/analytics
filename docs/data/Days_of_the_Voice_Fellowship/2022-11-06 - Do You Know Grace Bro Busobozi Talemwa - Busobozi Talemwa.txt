[Music] hands walls alone [Music] I was blind by now I see [Music] yeah it's Jesus foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] Jesus this morning we are thinking about the grace that has saved us and the grace that has made us who we are enjoy [Music] to hide your people and I'm talking about it you had your people that are people that we are called by your name [Music] but by Grace we have been grafted are you rich [Music] Israel was the original yesterday [Music] and now we can stand and say boldly we are children foreign [Music] [Music] and bind us with the courts of the Holy Ghost this morning thank you for the song service thank you Lord foreign [Music] foreign [Music] for this I could not exactly remember the book that it's in and I'm sure that um one of the books I read on Mr Moody do I eat moody in Chicago and he says that Modi that Mr Modi after reading Romans 7 again he ran into the streets he ran into the streets and the first man he met he said to him do you know Grace and the man replied Grace who integration me and so Mr Modi said the grace of God so it's really him when he's seen that how Grace had separated us from the Lord praise the name of the Lord Amazing Grace how sweet that sounds and we will take a reading from The Book of Genesis chapter 22 verse 15. and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I'll blessed thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and the seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and indeed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice foreign [Music] praise the Lord you may be seated amen so um in Genesis and and you know these words that um Dwight Moody we've read about what Modi said to somebody he had read in the Bible and after reading that then he came to somebody on the street randomly and they asked them they don't interpret number so he said do you know Grace do you know Grace Gracie foreign and so this man asked somebody do you know Grace do you mean grace [Music] and so um we've been able to find that this man was not meaning Grace as in Grace somebody he was speaking of the grace of God and so I ask you do you know Grace of money can you ask somebody do you know Grace do you know Grace Grace have you ever met Grace do you know Grace Grace of money praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so the blood on the sound you really have to give me good sound so that we can uh bring forth the word and if you need somebody to help you then call them up so I would like to uh dwell much on the promise that God gave uh Ibrahim Abraham being being a man that God chose in a country that was not perfect at the time that the whole world was in sin against the wrath of God had come up to destroy the world can you remember it was at this same time that God came down and um with you know with two angels and they visited Abraham in the plains of mamrix some place and his wife was inside and so one of the Angels Came and spoke to him and of course we know that this was America and so it was God himself can you imagine God walking into your attention can you imagine that and so God walked to Abraham's 10. recognized who God was spoke I mean God spoke to Abraham and told him that he would have uh the promise that God that he had given him and so Abraham did not doubt Ibrahimovic this Angel spoke to Abraham and Sarah did not agree and you know Sarah said Sarah laughed in her heart with me at my age [Music] I want you to see that Abraham was as a sinner just like the rest of them initially and he and his father and his cousins and everybody else was a sinner yes I promise just like the rest of them but God by his election by his love and grace he came to Abram and it and you know Abraham was unlike his brothers he was born but still God came to him [Music] so there is nothing that is going to keep God in your life and that's why I wanted you to ask yourself that question this morning do you know Grace he told him leave your people believe everything that you have here I want you to go to our land which I will show you and there I will make you a great nation so God gave Abraham promises a God he had never seen your body [Music] that is why is God our father in the face because for him yeah he believed god without even sensing anything he believed God it was counted to him praise the name of the Lord and the age of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time foreign by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and that's not withheld thy son only son of course this is many uh years afterwards because when God called Abraham Abraham fought the voice because we know the journey how Abraham brought lot with him and you know until that Lord dies in your life sometimes you may not receive the blessings that God has planned for you sometimes people come to the Lord and they answer the call but they come with Lords Lord is certain things that you are not give up what are some of those things that you love and cherish so much that you are you can do anything to retain them and I'm telling you you cannot walk into your full promise until you let the Lord God Amen maybe your neighbor is losing slap them and tell them let Lord go now come on come on tell your neighbor Amen Let let's go again praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen and Lord luti was an encumbrance for God to be able to meet but you see when it reached some place Abraham came back to his mind and he realized he needed to let Lord go not again and Lord was his cousin the Lord was related to Abrams and the father of Lord had died was just being a good man to bring a long Lord so that Lord can may be for adventure be a part of his Blessing but I'm speaking to you this morning what I'm saying to you Lord cannot be a part of your blessings never walk in the fullness of the blessing of God for your life and this one morning foreign [Music] [Applause] so that day when Lord decided to make a decision Lord did not decide to go to the desert with Abram again Abraham was destined destined for the desert but Lord did not love the desert Lord did not love hardships Lord did not love to go through the you know the the straight not away that was only happy when he went to sodomy but at least if he did not go to Sodom he would go to government but you see with Abraham was already developed big big they had all the pumps they had all the they had all the clubs they had all everything you would want to have they had all the betting houses you know that would dress bikinis and go out on the streets they had everything that you would think of in the world they had even the powerful universities they had you know great big buildings beautiful streets even big churches where they will come and sing and dance developed and civilized and Lord his heart was connected to that you know there are some people who are connected to some you know powerful things whereby when you see something beginning and young and you know not looking so nice oh you are not attracted some people are connected to what we call classes you know this is how Cain was in a beautiful things you know you know fruits things that don't have blood things which are not you know like you know shopping you know things gets gets you into get you involved I got to win you get him you know but you see up there on the country like Abraham Ibrahim he was he was ready in his heart to go for hardships listen to me we have to see seeds in the world the seed of God and the seed of the devil anyway the seed of God is ready to suffer from the sake of Christ they say the seed of God is rather to be trained by God they can get the blessing of God and the blessing of God women will always make them Rich whereby no matter what you try to give them they can never be satisfied what satisfies them is the pure [Music] because I were decided to choose that narrow and straight away I can say I know Grace is the ability Amen to to for you to understand that God has loved you so much and has called you for a greater purpose foreign [Music] [Music] straight is the gate and narrows away can you go listen to righteousness whatever you do no problem do what you do no problems [Music] is straight and narrow can you go this one is hard but whoever goes through that way hallelujah amen and here is now what I wanted to say you don't even have to worry the moment you choose to walk into the narrow way you are not on your own [Music] that is what usually consoles me you are not on your own because when God called Abraham he told him this by myself I have sworn hallelujah amen God put his word amen on the line here God put his reputation Hallelujah God did not swear by the Vatican cartoon he did not swear by the pope or the Catholic church God swore by himself his reputation is at stage meaning if he does not fulfill his promise because you have done this thing amen because Abraham decided to take the narrow away Ibrahim is not always full of suffering and tears it is full of sad things let me tell you something you have a promise God has sworn by himself that is what do you see [Music] hallelujah amen it might be difficult even in your marriage you have a promise foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I'd like you to stay here foreign [Music] foreign it must have been tough it must have been difficult he bow on the hands of the boys I'm sorry the boy was well taught that moment I am the sacrifice he said to God if you're going to sacrifice me I Give Myself Away hallelujah amen sometimes you may think God has wiped all your dreams away no he has not can never beat you no he cannot that's all the picture God is Not ruthless hallelujah amen he can never wipe your future [Music] because he didn't want the boys come on let me not give him to you as he told me [Music] I'm sure God was just there laughing yeah hallelujah amen look at my son look at her he must have called the Angels McCain come and see hallelujah hallelujah he must have called Gabriel come and see praise the name of the Lord don't worry about her that is Joy the joy of Salvation Angels who will believe me regardless of what he or she is going through and the angels stared at America they said what are we say is he going to kill them hallelujah amen Gabriel must stop saying here is the ship in the casino you can't see it don't do anything don't worry leave that for me sometimes you pray almost around you want to go to show you something just show you what God has prepared you want to dream a dream but God will present nothing to you because he himself and to prove himself to be the god of Grace hallelujah amen because anything about Grace and at that moment there was a ship One Way trigger so Abraham brain turn your side nachuka right there that's the sacrifice amen the promise keeper oh yeah and his name is Jesus Christ he will keep all the promises he has made to him oh my this will make a child of God shall dance hallelujah amen this excites me and I'm not sorry hallelujah hallelujah amen out today are they excited they go in their dance halls is hallelujah hallelujah and God kept his promise because you have not withheld yourself because you have not you have done this any blessing um [Music] Ibrahim [Applause] that Israeli and read Genesis 26 1 to 5. Genesis 26 6 God promises this boy who was going to be killed comes down he gives him the same promise two he says and the Lord appeared unto him unto Isaac go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell you in this land listen and I will be with you and I will bless you foreign and I will make thy City to multiply at the start of heaven give unto thy seed all these countries shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because Abraham obeyed my voice and he confirmed the Covenant foreign one thing about our God our God does not forget Hallelujah Amina Our God does not forget if you believe him he will never forget if you make a decision he will never forget he's right on time even he will never delay he comes right he is a faithful God he's a god of Grace for God to bring down the confidence the promise was there [Applause] that day that's why you murdered you better train your children amen what God told you pass it down to them pass it down today if God made a covenant with you he's a God that follows the seeds and some of you that your parents had wrong confidence with some demons and spirits you must not allow it to follow your life hallelujah amen the moment to meet this man call the grace hallelujah amen God promises they cannot follow your life anymore hallelujah amen hallelujah amen we have seen people who had AIDS [Music] the only thing is unfaith God can do the impossible if my father was a thief if my father was a witch doctor if my father was a very undoubted all those demons why does it follow righteously because you have not cleaned your Consciousness because the mind of Christ is not in you know that this might be in you know questions let the mind of course be in you amen soon you realize that in our family all the firstborn die no magical because in my family all the firstborns lived when I go to Egypt my name is I see in my family all the firstborns live when the end of this game all the firstborns it was in the families of Egypt and then I come to the New Destiny in my family the first born amen hallelujah amen I'm verified no reason in my own natural family my first point will lead our boys and girls you know sometimes you have to behave and act strange to the extent the Devil Himself cannot understand what exactly you're planning to navigate praise the name of the Lord from Abraham and in Genesis set up on earth and the top of it reached to Heaven Guru and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it [Applause] to be great I will give it same same thing foreign it is going to end up with somebody here [Applause] do you know Grace and I see it shall be as the dust of the earth Thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South until I have done that which I have spoken to the Earth amen God will not leave me now let me talk about myself you can talk about yourself as long as it does not happen God cannot leave me [Music] the god of abrahamas continually the promise but this was the natural state of Abraham I mean this was only the natural City let me tell you some news this is this is greater than any trivia pay attention here is the news all those promises where to the Natural seeds all those we have seen we are only the natural seeds and was only a shadow the reality was yet to come there is always amen he does not share blood with abrahamas but it says amen hallelujah and the prophet of God here says something says when we know this the only thing we have to do is promises is to stay put on God's word he perfectly taped Abraham and his seed after him and I'm going to follow the Junctions of Abraham's life and then follow the Junctions of Abraham and you will see if God kept his word letter by letter and it says you can follow me as I'm reading here he says we know he says we know that there is only one way that we can be saved and that is Hallelujah I want you to see this here is something that happened was Jesus Christ Hallelujah not Christ Cristo is the Royal Seed of Abraham yesterday out of Abraham come is Israel as we know Joseph and so forth [Music] finally the Royal seed was born which is was Christ I mean made Abraham the father of all Nations [Music] and listen this is my favorite part that is given to the people unconditionally he said Abraham Ibrahim absent to you by myself by myself what did Abraham do nothing what was the sacred Grace then unto Isaac what did Abraham do how did Isaac do nothing what was the secretary Grace because he was a Seed of Abraham by foreign now Jesus yes was the royal Seed of Abraham who would possess the Gate of the enemies Hallelujah brother Fred did he possess the guests do we say nothing oh yes we do he came from Heaven to us to show the way from the Earth to the cross [Music] from the cross to the ground from the grave to the sky Lord I Lift Your Name when he came from Heaven he came because when he came to Africa he was beaten he was smitten he was laughed and the Bible says he was full of grace and truth and Jesus he said if you be the son of God do this connection make this transferred foreign you'll be the Son of God I'm checking one two one in every answer of Jesus hallelujah amen and the devil was confused on Earth because Jesus was beaten and he did not beat them back he possessed Jesus yes was sent to God before Pontius spoiler pirate spirit and before the others they put a crown of phones think about it a crown of thorns on his bro and he did nothing he possessed and then when he went to the cross the devil thought you would have him one last time the devil came in this man and the man told Jesus if you be the Son of God do you think this was the man speaking this was the same devil speaking serve us and save yourself protesters but he did not realize that again that Jesus was on the cross yes to possess the Gate of death he possessed it he saved the one who was supposed to be saved you will be with me in paradise and when Jesus gave up the ghost yes and he died he went straight to hell yeah and when he went to hell we had to come again the very first stop where a circle was hell itself he did not go as a gentleman this time listen church but if you want the seed or is it of Abraham what is that in Abraham he was the city and was supposed to possess the Gate of Hell and he already know Korea this was going to hell to be captured he went to hell to possession and Jesus yes went to hell that's a good summer oh yeah Jesus went to heaven yes I said Jesus Amen Let The Devil hear it because whenever he hears it he remembers the experience and the Jesus went to yesterday foreign he was used to those who were crying and screaming but this time it was someone who was knocking not knocking as though he was begging to be up and fall but he was knocking as though to surprise them and then they realized it was somebody strange freely foreign [Music] I'm sure that all these demons the devil had met Jesus a few days ago matter of fact how was ago hey that is standing at them again and he called all the demons I don't know how he called them maybe they have their own vocabulary all you in here [Music] I have been there on the cross and I saw him I even lost at him and I told him if you be the Son of God save yourself on us [Laughter] do not save himself but I was scanning enough today I even made a man to be as his side he did not know the devil was oh my goodness Hallelujah I never did not know he was helping God to fulfill prophecy by piercing the sight of Jesus what came out [Applause] because of the sight of Jesus foreign [Music] random [Applause] they must have jumped you know all the kind of dancers [Applause] in front of his followers and he realized not again this is the same man on the cross and if the devil said yesterday because [Music] and Jesus yes to kick the devil massage and Jesus yes took the case Swagger amen that is our Jesus yes that is our Jesus and before you left here he brought into some little corner Paradise where there was some believers who had been kept there all right [Music] said I'm here he didn't even need to introduce himself when he comes down one day when it comes down one day we shall recognize because we will be like hallelujah amen because we have known Grace I tell you the moment you believed in Jesus Christ you have met Grace foreign [Applause] really for Israel they are Israeli look at Malachi chapter four verse 5-6 who have to believe in this message for years after what we have seen after our private studies in the Bible we have realized that Elijah the prophet is only to Israel why is not the Gentiles no Rachel we the Gentiles they don't know Grace and I'll prove that to you in a moment before I conclude here when Elijah came the first time he was too yeah is that right when they come he came the second time in Elijah he was two yes when he came the third time now he is coming again hallelujah amen in Revelation 11 3. Elijah is coming again and he's coming to foreign before the last portion of the 70 weeks ends there is a you know after the death of Jesus from that time from there is a space that is not known at all to the Jews in Romans chapter 11. the Bible says the Jews are actually blinded and I've lived in Ethiopia and I've met Jews they don't know Jesus foreign foreign and everything that was of the Jews that was remaining for the Jews fast should first go to the Gentile Church Elijah to the judge to the Jews first so he must first come to the judgmental child again [Music] and God told him not to go to Israel because if he had gone to Israel he had everything that that Elijah will have for Israel and it was not yet the time for the Jews and so God told him no that's not your part he will stand around he only stopped in Egypt and he met King Arafat and he never went to Israel and God stopped him because it wasn't the time for the Israel again God had to complete with the Jew the Gentiles wouldn't then become an Elijah to the Gentiles by Grace we did not deserve it was not our portion was not meant to be the child foreign [Music] I agree yes we know our system too many employers cannot take us to Heaven our Doctrine cannot take us to Heaven only one thing that is the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord what has happened to us we have been grafted in and now we can say we know Grace tell somebody do you know Grace and if you have realized it just tell them I found Grace come on tell somebody [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the Lord is
