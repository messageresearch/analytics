[0:20] of heart and in uprightness to do
[0:23] according to all that i have commanded
[0:25] thee and with that and will keep my
[0:28] statutes and my judgments that i will
[0:31] establish the k the throne of thy
[0:33] kingdom upon israel forever as i
[0:35] promised to david
[0:37] thy father saying there shall not
[0:42] they shall not fail thee a man upon the
[0:45] throne of israel
[0:56] nobody
[1:24] all right let us read verse six and
[1:26] seven
[1:27] but if you shall
[1:29] at all turn from following me
[1:32] ye or your children
[1:34] and will not keep my commandments and my
[1:36] statutes which i have set before you
[1:39] but go and serve other gods and worship
[1:41] them
[1:43] then will i cut off israel out of their
[1:45] land which i have given them and this
[1:48] house which i have allowed for my name
[1:51] will i cast out of my sight and israel
[1:54] shall be a proverb under by word among
[1:57] all people
[2:05] obama
[2:34] may the lord blessings upon his word he
[2:36] may have you see my command
[2:41] i just want to greet each and every one
[2:43] of you in the precious name of jesus
[2:49] and we want to thank him for
[2:51] yet an opportunity has given us
[2:57] to be able to gather in his house this
[2:59] evening
[3:15] i'll just go straight to the message
[3:19] amen i mean
[3:21] this evening i'm going to share on
[3:22] something very very important
[3:31] i want to welcome you back
[3:36] happy to see you
[3:38] although you disappeared without
[3:39] informing us and the church where you
[3:41] are gone
[3:51] so tonight i'm going to share on the in
[3:54] on integrity of heart
[4:00] everybody say it integrity of heart
[4:02] integrity of a heart away symbol
[4:06] and um i take that from verses three
[4:10] four actually
[4:14] brother give me that verse again first
[4:15] kings 9 3 he says and the lord said unto
[4:18] him i have had a prayer and this
[4:20] application that thou hast made before
[4:22] me
[4:23] i have allowed this house which thou
[4:25] hast viewed to put my name there are
[4:27] there forever and my eyes and my heart
[4:30] shall be there perpetually
[4:39] no questions
[4:55] so god that uh um solomon had built a
[4:57] house for the lord sure
[5:00] and god told him
[5:03] i have had your prayer i'm pretty dope
[5:05] and i've had this application no
[5:07] question
[5:08] that you have made before me your cousin
[5:10] and therefore i have allowed this house
[5:15] which thou has built
[5:17] to put my name there foreign
[5:30] there is one thing built in the lord our
[5:32] house and another thing the lord
[5:34] receiving that house with your mind
[6:04] many times people serve god but when it
[6:06] is in his permissive world
[6:10] [Music]
[6:14] but the reason is
[6:15] they don't go to the lord in prayer they
[6:17] don't seek the face of god or the mind
[6:19] of god about what they want to do for
[6:20] him
[6:25] [Music]
[6:27] their heart is not following the
[6:29] leadership of the lord but their heart
[6:31] is following their own desires and it
[6:34] has on their own objectives and and and
[6:36] things that they have and they want to
[6:38] achieve
[6:40] it
[6:47] many times we do serve the lord when our
[6:49] motives and our objectives are not right
[6:57] and this evening by the grace of god
[7:15] and so david had wanted to build a a
[7:18] house for the lord
[7:21] before he did he inquired of the lord to
[7:23] see the mind of god
[7:28] and the lord told him no david as much
[7:31] as you were man after my heart i do not
[7:33] allow it
[7:38] that you could not build a house for me
[7:40] put your guns in bill and you because
[7:41] your hands are full of blood
[7:57] become an accountant and accepted it a
[7:59] new manager
[8:01] and he said i've heard even your prayer
[8:02] now my name is don't do what it does and
[8:05] even i have accepted to come and dwell
[8:07] in this house
[8:10] and they said i'll be
[8:38] several months ago i did speak on
[8:42] uh
[8:43] you know the a relationship having a
[8:45] relationship with god
[8:51] a person of god
[9:04] [Music]
[9:11] [Music]
[9:20] if isaac would accept also to have a
[9:23] personal relationship with god
[9:28] then now he would become the god of
[9:29] isaac
[9:31] so you see it goes on and on and on
[10:02] keeping the startups and the judgments
[10:09] with god in doing the in the
[10:11] commandments
[10:15] and david walked in the integrity of his
[10:18] heart
[10:23] now god has visited now solomon
[10:28] is telling him if you solomon era
[10:49] [Music]
[10:58] if you walk with me like this single
[11:00] tumblr
[11:01] then i will establish your throne amen
[11:04] of thy kingdom upon israel forever
[11:11] as i promised your father david saying
[11:13] they shall not fill their mind upon the
[11:16] throne of israel
[11:24] you can walk with god like david walked
[11:27] with god
[11:31] you are bound to receive the blessings
[11:33] that david received when he walked with
[11:34] god
[11:40] god favored solomon because solomon also
[11:42] walked with god
[11:46] solomon was a king
[11:49] he walked with god like solomon who
[11:51] walked with god
[12:09] come to solomon
[12:12] you have spoken to him the second time
[12:14] like as he did at gibbons
[12:20] telling him he's giving him several ways
[12:23] he can be able to walk with god
[12:29] one of those ways
[12:31] to walk with god
[12:34] in the integrity of hearts
[13:11] integrity is the quality of being honest
[13:14] and fair away
[13:33] [Applause]
[13:49] [Music]
[14:10] [Music]
[14:10] [Applause]
[14:29] the quality of being honest
[14:36] integrity is a matter of the heart away
[14:41] integrity is not land somewhere
[14:46] integrity is a matter of the heart
[14:49] symbol
[14:51] this is something that originates from
[14:53] the from the from the type from the
[14:55] nature of the heart
[15:10] they never tried we are born without
[15:12] integrity of heart trans everybody now
[15:14] we are a symbol because we are born with
[15:17] bitterness
[15:19] you're born with selfishness
[15:21] come to the world speaking lies
[15:41] we were born in sin and therefore we are
[15:44] born sinners
[15:47] towards our liberty but when we receive
[15:50] christ
[15:51] there is something that he cherishes
[15:56] that is something he's looking for in
[15:58] each of you
[16:01] and that is integrity of her
[16:03] channel
[16:06] and by the time of the end of the
[16:07] service probably the lord willing we
[16:09] shall have you know covered a few things
[16:11] about this
[16:13] [Music]
[16:15] you will get yourself
[16:16] very carefully cut
[16:18] on your more your god bless david's
[16:20] throne catherine
[16:49] [Music]
[17:02] [Music]
[17:52] the bible says in the book of ezekiel
[17:53] that we even god will give you what fast
[17:57] the first thing he gives you is a
[18:07] [Applause]
[18:08] [Music]
[18:26] he
[18:27] [Applause]
[18:41] he gives god his guidelines here
[18:42] uprightness
[18:46] uprightness
[18:49] keeping the statutes and judgments
[18:53] doing god's commandments
[18:57] and then four walking in integrity of
[18:59] heart
[19:03] many people today in this long distance
[19:36] very many people there they don't have
[19:38] the integrity capital business
[19:40] advantages
[19:41] [Music]
[19:43] in day-to-day lives
[19:45] children are not having integrity
[19:49] parents sometimes they don't have
[19:51] integrity or is that the rumor
[19:53] symbol people around about us our
[19:55] communities our societies no integrity
[19:59] moving forward
[20:01] people do not fear to speak
[20:04] alive you as a christian someone asks
[20:07] you and you you are very careless to
[20:10] speak in life
[20:16] if you are a liar you are a bad witness
[20:20] [Music]
[20:31] the bible says you deliver souls
[20:36] because you are a faithful witness
[20:40] and jesus christ
[20:42] tells us he is a faithful and true
[20:45] witness
[20:46] of
[20:57] [Applause]
[21:12] [Music]
[21:18] who can tell me that i have not
[21:20] faithfully abided with every oh moved or
[21:23] been faithful in every word that was
[21:25] written about me
[21:30] [Music]
[21:57] right i'm requesting that we go a little
[21:58] bit faster so that we can be able to
[22:00] cover all these things
[22:08] he chose david also his servant and took
[22:10] him from the sheep folds
[22:16] from following the use gret with young
[22:19] he brought him to feed jack of his
[22:22] people
[22:37] amen out of those ships which were
[22:39] feeding their younger ones
[22:43] who took him from there
[22:45] so that he can feed it jack of his
[22:48] people
[22:49] could he say a couple of months so that
[22:51] he can feed jack of his inheritance
[22:55] is the lady of chicago the inheritance
[22:58] of god wakatonda so he fed them
[23:01] according to the integrity of his heart
[23:06] okay
[23:20] something
[23:42] [Music]
[23:48] foreign
[24:03] [Music]
[24:13] [Music]
[24:15] he was already trained by the sheep
[24:20] because remember sheep has a nature
[24:24] and the nature of the sheep is after the
[24:26] shepherds
[24:29] and so we notice that david was already
[24:31] a shepherd
[24:36] means the one
[24:38] who fits the
[24:42] means listen to me the one who
[24:44] guides
[24:59] looking for
[25:01] god was looking for a pastor after his
[25:03] own heart
[25:07] what type of heart
[25:10] imaging
[25:12] integrity
[25:38] no matter how much he tries he cannot
[25:39] help you since
[25:55] god you
[25:56] do not have confidence in him
[26:00] i cannot help you
[26:02] so what
[26:03] does that do
[26:05] you know the word of god is a two-edged
[26:07] sword oh my god
[26:16] [Music]
[26:50] the
[27:04] together
[27:06] and then speak with each of them now
[27:08] you'll get a number one b without taking
[27:10] any sides
[27:12] and then ending and end the whole thing
[27:14] by bringing it back into sweetness
[27:39] and so the bible tells me here i believe
[27:43] and israel all right he says so god
[27:46] brought him to feed them
[27:52] israel the people of god
[27:55] according to the integrity of
[27:57] of his heart
[27:59] [Music]
[28:40] the bible tells us so david fed them
[28:42] according to the integrity of his heart
[28:51] this young man here
[28:55] is our pastor yeah
[29:24] type of a man who was david
[29:28] said he was a man who was close to god
[29:31] that would be animal said yeah are you a
[29:32] company
[29:33] hear the voice of god
[29:37] relationship with god
[30:00] even the pastors themselves they kind of
[30:02] do those worldly styles
[30:06] as
[30:46] but i want to thank god
[31:42] by the word of god
[31:58] our pastors
[32:00] are only chamberlain
[32:03] do you know who are you is
[32:06] he has no seed to give you omula
[32:10] of himself
[32:12] but he's only giving you a seed of his
[32:14] mask
[32:17] we do not want to get the character and
[32:19] the nature of our leaders
[32:25] to get the character and the nature of
[32:27] the one that sent our leaders
[32:34] david in many ways is a type of jesus
[32:37] christ
[32:40] so that's why the bible says that he
[32:42] amen he fed the people according to the
[32:45] integrity of his heart
[32:49] [Music]
[32:52] he guided them by the skillfulness of
[32:56] his hands
[33:01] hallelujah
[33:06] samuel chapter 13 verse 14. somewhere

[33:52] oh how i love it
[33:55] jesus yes he's the one who introduces
[33:58] the mind to the ministry

[1:12:25] [Music]
[1:12:37] a good man out of the good treasure of

[1:12:41] good and an evil man out of the evil
[1:12:43] treasure of his heart bring it forth
[1:12:45] that which is evil for of the abundance
[1:12:48] of the heart his mouth speaketh
[1:12:55] [Music]

[1:13:33] treasure of his heart bring his first
[1:13:35] thought which is good again

[1:13:43] of his heart bring his fourth
[1:13:58] what
[1:14:12] sometimes
[1:14:53] the holy spirit

[1:15:24] enjoyed today
[1:15:28] one young man could be a testament today
[1:15:29] that i really enjoyed it

[1:17:27] me not wander from thy commandments thy
[1:17:30] word have i hid in my heart that i might
[1:17:33] not see against thing
[1:17:45] here is how david was able to maintain
[1:17:48] the integrity of his heart
[1:17:52] always simple to make
[1:17:54] the word of god in his heart
[1:18:18] do you have a desire in your heart for
[1:18:21] moral purity
[1:18:38] 15
[1:18:48] at the mouth goes into the belly and is
[1:18:51] cast out into the drought

[1:18:56] the mouth
[1:18:57] come
[1:18:58] from the heart
[1:18:59] and they defile the man
[1:19:02] matayo coming up
[1:19:21] from the mouth really comes out from the
[1:19:24] heart
[1:19:29] like the words of my mouth
