Uh we shall read the first verse and then we shall jump to to vers 9. Okay. Roman for Continue. to send. Amen. Precious Lord Jesus, we thank you for the word which we have read and we ask you to add your blessings upon your word. May the Holy Spirit, Father, who wrote this word because the Bible tells us that men of all who are inspired or moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the scripture. Heaven Father, may the same anointing, may the same Holy Spirit, take this word this morning and break it to us, Lord, in Christ Jesus. Amen. Amen. You may have your seat. Amen. Praise be to God. This morning, Uh, I want us to I want to preach about the coming judgment. Praise be to God. Uh, many times preach this kind of sermon outside evangelism. Amen. But today I felt led that we talk remind oursel about the coming judgment. Praise be to God. And I will call it judgment is coming because I wanted to sound more uh serious, quick. Praise be to God. The prophet preached someone alongside that line. There's a sermon called the oncoming storm. Praise be to God. And in that sermon he remind us about the oncoming storm and tells that there is a storm coming and that storm is going to hit each one of us. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But before the storm comes always there is a place of refuge. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I remember that time when uh brother Julius was preaching about the refuge and I was uh I had the same thought and I remember I told brother Dan that hey the brother is preaching my sermon. Praise be to God. Amen. We are living in a very dangerous time. The world has come to the end of [Music] everything. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And many times as Christian we forget about this. Praise be to God. But today I want us to take a different angle and we talk about the judgment which is coming. God is going to judge this world someday and each one of us we will be there. Praise be to God. Amen. And we must prepare for the judgment. In whatever we are doing, we should not forget that there is a judgment coming and God is judgment is coming and you need to prepare yourself. Praise be to God. That judgment will not find you unaware. You are prepared. But when you are not prepared, brother, sister, you'll be caught unaware. Praise be to God. Amen. The prophet tells us every time we see a major prophet. That is a sign of God's judgment. It's a warning that the judgment is coming. Are you ready? Are you prepared this afternoon? Amen. Praise be to God. Amen. In a message the oncoming storm butam says always there have to be a preparation. Amen. We are lucky and we are blessed that we are living in a country where we don't have earthquake.

Are you ready for the coming judgment? Have you passed the judgment to life? [Music] Are you in Christ Jesus? Amen. Because all in Christ Jesus, there's the only place of refuge. Because the Bible says, "Therefore, there's no condemnation. To those who are in Christ Jesus, praise the Lord." Are you in Christ this morning? Are you sure you are born again? Have you received the Holy Ghost? Have you received the message of the hour? Have you recognized your messenger and his message? Do you know what the message of the hour is? Praise be to God.

Jesus said in book of John 5:24, whosoever hears my word and believe in amen on him that sent me have everlasting life and will not come until judgment. Praise be to God. There are two group of people here. Those who are coming in the judgment, those who already judge, they already passed judgment. But they will also appear. But the advantage is they'll be on the judging side. Praise be to God. Because they were judged on us, they took he of the judgment, they repented of their sins. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And because they repented of their sins, there's no condemnation. You cannot be judged with tri. Praise the Lord. Amen. On this day, where John saw and Sarah saw the great and the small.

But there is a coming judgment where the righteous judge of the judge is going to judge this world. and everybody, every minister minister of the government, every minister of the gospel, every member of parliament, members of Congress, they will appear before the judge and they will be judged. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. But always there is a warning before the judgment. And the reason I asked why you are here this morning is because you heard the gospel and the minister told you. We are living in the end time and you went and believe the end time message. Praise be to God. But what have you done? Many message believers are so comforted. We are in the message. We are in the bride. Are you sure? Do you have the blood tag? talking applied there. It is true we are in the end time. But are you ready or it has become a slogan or a dogma in the message? There they say, "Hail Mary, mother of Jesus. Pray for us sinners." We are in the message. I'm the bride. We are in the message of the hour. I'm a message believer. My holy Mary, mother of Christ, pray for us like the other people.

Wherever you go, whatever you do, whatever you say, there is a recorder. God is recording you. Praise be to God. God must have enough evidence. Amen. He won't just judge you anyhow. I saw that kind of [Music] judge. The judges who receive a call and they twist the case. I remember one time my uncle was knocked around.

Praise the Lord. But there's a day coming they will give an account unless they repent. Those are the very men whom you find out there trying to arrest preachers. You are ching noise pollution. Noise pollution. But let me tell you, there's crying in hell. There was no noise pollution. You better listen to the voice of the preacher. Amen. And repent. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
