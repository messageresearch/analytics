Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth shall be losed in heaven for amen is that amen amen let us pray once again father Lord we want to uh now come into your presence and we ask that you give us a good atmosphere Lord that we might be able to hear from above we want to be connected to you you've laid something on my heart for the church this evening may you just now give me utterance and also give them reception they shall be able to receive what you have prepared for us Grant it Lord in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated please there's more I wanted to say but I think we can I can keep that for Sunday amen we have issues with our generator and U I understand it was affecting online service a little bit here but nevertheless that's why we we should always come to church physically never stay at at home and say I will stream that day God visits the church you who has been at home streaming you miss out you remember in the Youth Camp how some people missed out there were many streaming there but for some good time many missed out so always come to church when you come uh unless if you are de if you cannot or if you really B come to church so this evening I just want to I have a little thought on more than a movement more than a denomination tell your neighbor more than a movement more than a denomination [Music] this is what this what we believe is this is what we are we are more than a movement we are more than a denomination you see we are not a religion we are not a denomination we are not just a movement We Are The Church of Jesus Christ we are the people that God is preparing for the coming for his coming he has a people on earth in every generation that he has been preparing I believe we are one of those in our generation that God is preparing for his coming I have um really some things deep on my heart this evening I hope that the Lord will help me to give me utterance to uh speak those things to you you see here in the Book of Matthew 16 you know Jesus was asking the disciples who he was first of all he asked them who the people said he was and uh you know they said some say you are Isaiah Jeremiah you ofet and so then he said but how about you who do you say that I am then Peter by Revelation notice by revelation he said Thou Art Jesus Christ the son of the Living God and uh then Jesus answered and said unto him blessed thou Simon Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto you you who has received that Revelation that you are p and Upon This Rock I will build my church I will build my what my denomination my movement My Religion he said my what my church I will build my church Christ cannot be defeated if I am the church I know the devil will fight me but he cannot defeat me because I am amen I am built upon a rock and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against me and he says I give you the keys but before we get into that I want to read you a quote here in the message the revelation of Jesus Christ he says the importance of Revelation by the spirit Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I am not talking about this book of Revelation and you I am talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church and then he says do you remember in Matthew 16 where we have just read where Jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some said that thou John the Baptist some elas and others Jeremiah oh one of the prophets but he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed thou Simon B for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto you that thou Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against you and so now here the prophet says these words the Roman Catholics say that the church is built upon Peter now that is really can how could God build the church Upon A man so unstable that he denied the Lord Jesus and cast while doing it God cannot build his church upon any man born in sin the Church of Jesus is not built upon the foundation of any man it's not buil upon any man brother it's not built upon Peter it's not built upon John he not built upon Paul are you hearing me he's not even B buil upon brother bham the Church of Jesus is not built upon any man but I want I want you to continue here and say he says um God can build his church upon any man born in sin you see many denominations many of them have a foundation of a man but this message we preach is not built upon any man and it wasn't some rock lying there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't the Protestants as the protests say as the Protestants say that the church is built upon Jesus was the one that the church was built upon no it was the Revelation and he said read it the way it is written not you know headed by a man the Church of Jesus is not does not have a system of governance on Earth the Church of Jesus is headquartered in heaven and the foundation of it is re who received that Revelation is part of that church amen I became part of that church when I Reed the spiritual revelation of the word and um and uh let let us look at spiritual Revelation how did Abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to God how did AB know how to offer a spiritual sacrifice a spiritual proper Sacrifice by Faith by faith he received the revelation of the blood Kan did not get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he could not offer the right sacrifice it was a the Seminary teaches and though it might be told to you with eloquence listen church until God reveals to you you you that Jesus is the Christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that God is your savior until God comes down by the way Revelation comes from Heaven re it is the spiritual Revelation that does it hallelujah amen you can come to church and here are preaching here are preaching every service and you never understand it and you never come to that Revelation until you yield yourself well enough that's why I always say when a preacher is preaching don't hear the the preacher's words and hear from another word and hear another voice and hear a different sound that's why many times you find people shouting why that person has connected to another sound he has received personal Revelation it is beyond what the preacher is saying that's why some people can even shout and they even stop hearing what the preacher is saying and some people are offended they're saying they're even making me not here why because this person something that makes you understand things without even hearing what a man is saying something which makes you see yourself as a spirit not a not not a flesh am I communicating to someone this evening something which makes you say a when you the more you keep coming to church amen because you see Revelation is Faith and it comes by hearing the word it comes by hearing the word the more you hear the word the more faith is building up and one of these days while you are seated right there in your seat you will hear the word and you will hear your name being called and it will become a personal experience that is what we call a personal experience Hallelujah and this message is not a set of teachings this message is more than teachings is more than Church order more than rules the Church of Jesus is in the Homeland Hallelujah and today we'll talk a little bit about the homeland of the church it is more than movement tell your neighbor is more than a movement it's more than an organization it is more than an organized group God is not in any of those systems God is in the Homeland what is the homeland of a Believer it is the Holy Ghost men have tried to make this message all things you know they have tried to build up personality CS where some of them have made brother Bram this message are you hearing me can you say Amen to what I'm saying they have made our Prophet the message they have come up with all sorts of private and personal Revelations of the message listen they buil camps and camps and camps you know they have this Holy Ghost Camp thund come return Ministry come you know we already in the Millennium come they have son of man come you find another compy of NOS for us we don't quot the prophet and then you find another of and find another for us we only listen to the TS you know they say if you are not in our group you are lost that is how you know that is a false count this Bible is true but people over they are they have made CS out of this Bible even was a he made it out of the Bible but the Bible is true the Bible is the word of God so the message is true the message is the word of God people have made personality C you know how do you know there are Ault when they when they become indifferent and they draw a circle and draw everybody out and they say if you are not in our group you are lost you cannot marry out of this group you cannot you cannot associate with others even if they say they believe the message but they are lost because they don't see the way we see it we are the only right Church in Camp we are the only right Church in in Uganda we the only right church here then you know that that is a personality C they have made themselves a denomination the true Holy Ghost can never denominate amen he will be full of love and he will brace the Brethren if you ever attend any church and after attending you feel you know you are now more spiritual than other brothers you now feel the others are back you are the only one who is on the right track there is a big problem that is a sign and symptom you are following a personality C but I am so glad because this message makes you love everybody it will be so full of love you will embrace your brothers and sisters this message is more than a movement it's not just a movement following William it is more than a movement it is more than a denomination our message is not to tell the world that God sent a prophet our message we have is to tell the world we have received a message by a prophet that called us back into our homeland amen did someone get it or you miss our message is not God Center Prophet that is not our message are you hearing me come on shout amen that is not our message did God send a prophet yes is that our message to the world no but our message to the world is to tell them we have received a message by a prophet that has called us back into our homeland back into our homeland what is our homeland our homeland is Revival our homeland is the holy spirit our homeland is the teachings of the Apostles our homeland is Holiness our homeland is a surrendered life to God in the Holy Ghost what is our homeland is the power of God that comes and manifests in SS and wonders and God moves and heals the SE and Makes Miracles that is our homeland it is more than a church it is more than a movement it is more than a denomination our Salvation is not tied to one Fellowship it is tied to Christ it is tied to the world it's not tied to one p it is tied to Christ come on now you all to shout amen I am so glad this message Set Me Free from the bondage of denomination denomination says when you leave you are lost but the word of God says when you are in Christ you are in your homand amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I'm so glad I am like a bir that has been released out of prison I can now fellowship with my brother no matter where they are brother bam said when they draw a circle and they draw you out what do you do you draw a bigger Circle and you bring all of them Hallelujah that is what this message has done for the Believers all over the world Hallelujah we have been restored back to our homeland Gabriel's instruction to Daniel Gabriel instruction to Daniel says it's the way it was in Egypt and God never did deal with Israel till she come to her Homeland and then he said hear me thus say the Lord God will not deal with his church till she comes back to the Homeland till she comes back to the Homeland and then he says the message of the hour the message of the hour is the Hallelujah and then he says come back to the original get away from your Methodist prian ideas you P assem one three five whatever it is Church of God naar pgri Hol Church of Christ all are anti Christ movements we might as well add other names dvf SBT whatever name you want to call you are lost then dvf has become an antichrist movement DF has no heaven for you [Music] dvf is not your Homeland your Homeland is the Holy Ghost your Homeland is the message of the your Homeland the world they are all wrong all of the devil oh my there is Godly men in every one of [Music] them there is godly people in every one of them organization in itself the organization in itself it is not of God and God will never bless it he never has done it do you understand we must always take our names our eyes beyond our church name beyond our pastor we must always put our eyes on the word on the message of the hour on the holy spirit because if you put it on me I may backslide I may fall away if you put it on our church something might happen if you put it on some preacher something might happen you're putting it on shifting signs of man's Wisdom but I will tell you something that can never Decay something that is trusted something that has been proven over the years that is Christ of all ages Amen in him we put our trust in him we put our confidence I don't care if all men fall away I know where I am standing I am standing Christ the solid rock God will never bless the organization God has never blessed it he has never done it and he says I ask you I ask any historian to write me and tell me whenever whenever and tell me whenever the church organized if God didn't lay it on the shelf and never dealt with it no more tell me where he ever raised up Luan again Methodist pentec never did and now right now in the Pentecostal and and some of these denominations they are praying oh God send Revival Revival they will never get again you need to understand Revival has moved Revival is the pillar of cloud Revival is a pill of fire and it is gone and he moves with those who are moving with it and where is Revival now is with the bride of Christ who has understood who she is and the how she's leaving in amen waiting for the rapture Revival is going to culminate into the Rapture the change of our bodies that organization laid there and conquered and rotten God took individuals and tried to point the people back to the Homeland and then the individual so weak and sified with some kind of a degree until they organized another organization they made it a twofold child more overh than it was but somewhere that he can put his hands upon who will not compromise with the ungodly organization who will swing the people back to the Rock back to Christ Jesus back to the original Pentecost back to the original Holy Ghost with original signs and original wonders surely God has got one somewhere who will not break down under any kind of persecution who will not run out who will not cancel out or fall out anything they will stay with it brother bam said these words in 1961 I believe at this time he was speaking of his message said God has someone even if all the others have denominated but God has someone who will swing people back to back to Christ Jesus back to the original P back to the original Holy Ghost signs and wonders that's what brother bam did he never swung people to himself people misunderstand this message is not William BR it is more than a man it is more than a church amen it is the Church of Jesus Christ is the restoration back to the Homeland God never blesses Israel till she gets to her home and it says God will never bless you a Methodist Baptist cathol he will never bless you that way come back to the Homeland I met a young man from Guru while we were in L and you know they've been writing me for a while now on my email and so when I called him and then I notic that is in G University so he came down and he met with me and I was with pastor jofrey and you know he sat through the Sunday morning service some of his brothers talked to him Jeffrey talked to him and then I got to talk to him last because I was busy the whole time now he was already feeling on your set go because the things he had had it was so heavy for him he's from Christ Embassy Embassy it was so heavy for him so heavy for him it was like everything were saying was strange to him we talked about women makup what baptism in the name of talk about you know a messenger to Our Last Days CH ages talked about women preachers so I sat down with him and you know he told me you know I said which church do you come from I said I said I'm a Christian he said I'm a Christian he said I'm non denomination I said that's very good I'm like you and then he realized now I'm going to trap him so he changed quickly he said I'm from Christ Embassy EMB I said is that not a denomination he said no I said what to you is a denomination and then he said I don't understand what is a denomination and I told him a denomination is a church that has its own set of uh uh doctrines whether or not they in the Bible but they believe it as gospel truth and it is the basis of their Christianity I said so would you then categorize your church as a denomination and like I said let me give you a little more a denomination will also have a man and a system that they r that they rever they reverse more than the Bible I gave him the example of the Catholic Church how they have the pope whatever he says is Gospel truth whether is in the Bible or not I said they have system preachers the fire preachers and I gave him all examples and then he said uh well according to your explanation then you would be a denomination I said thank you for accepting now can we begin talking do you believe in what your denomination says what the Bible say he said what do you mean I said I can give you example let us begin with women preachers I said did you know that according to the Bible women were not supposed to be pastors of preachers I read him first Timothy 2 and chapter 3 and and and he W stood up he said I'm I'm not ready for this he was sweating pting like a I said I'm not ready for this I'm not ready for this I want to go I what was binding this man something was binding him his denomination his organization I felt so sorry for him I felt too much love for him I looked at him I said oh denomination can make someone like this come back to the Homeland I wish this young man come back to the Homeland the homeland of scripture whereby you can sit down with him and share the word as long as is the word anyone will believe tell me any religion in this world that is like that apart from this message of Amen it is only the message where you can sit down with anyone who claims to believe whether you have ever met him or you just meetting him the first time you will sit down you will take your Bible they will take their Bible and they will agree 100% why because we have come to our homeland we have come to our homeland the Bible is our homeland the Holy Ghost is our hom and by the message of the hour God has brought us back to the Homeland come to the Homeland to the beginning amen when you come to the Homeland you will be back to the Pentecostal your experience it doesn't matter what has been defeating you in your life you can't overcome it by putting many rules around yourself get into prayer seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and when you are filled when you are filled something happens he says back to the Pentecostal experience like it happened on the day of Pentecost when the power somebody say the power come on shout it the power hallelu the power of the Living God what is the Holy Ghost is the power of the Living God where it change thousands of people oh my good Lord and he said their hearts are flame with the fire of God Amen that show genuine not impersonated signs not some made up telepathy some mockery and got into a r like we got in America what does it he says say who has the biggest tent who can have the biggest crowd we see it even here in Uganda they go on social media pastors they fighting who has the biggests if the Believers of the message wanted to number not even half of the districts of ug I believe the believer who are in number amen so we are not into our address of of who has the most people which church has the big biggest it is not about the biggest church it's not about the biggest crowd he says and we got our R running what a disgrace to see if we can add a thousand more to our organization it is a disgrace he wants us back to the truth back to the spirit back to the right light back to a highway in Christ back to the truth how can he ever bless us the way we go he want if you don't change he won't bless you you have to get back to the home he never blessed Israel until they come back to the promised land and when they got back in the promised land sign and wonders begin to happen he sent a man right down among them he s a man right among them and his name was Moses what did Moses come down with a polished up theology did he come down with a bachelor of art degree did he come down with an lld PhD he come down with the power of Jehovah and with a message return from this land to the Homeland return all dispers to your praise God in the message the says he won't recognize nothing but but that Covenant that convenant of the Holy Spirit and you cannot receive that Covenant unless you are saved Sanctified and baptized in to the you might have an impersonation you might feel good and jump up and down speak with t dance in the spirit dance in the spirit that doesn't have one thing to do with it hear it in the name of the Lord I'm a scholar I do this and that or the other you don't care how much scholar you are the devil is too he only recognizes the token that is the message of the hour that is the message of this day that is the message of this time in the name of Jesus Christ receive it hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah when you receive the message of the hour both The Works Will Follow The Works Will Follow You Will shout you will jum you speak in Tong you be Happ why because you have received the message of you'll be changed you'll be so happy you will love everybody so excited you will dance in the church you will speak in Tong you will walk away from your sins come on Church why because you have come to your Homeland Let Us return to our home this is what this message is it is more than a movement it is more than a denomination more than a church Hallelujah I wish we can say it amen and I want to finish with this quote Amen in a message trying to do God a service without being God's will now he reveals this things by his for knowledge to those who he has ordained to these things otherwise they don't see it stand right there looking right at it and they can't see it how many ever seen that picture of a cow in the bush that you just have to look and look you look and look you're looking at a painting of a cow in a bush look did you ever see that oh you have have you ever seen the picture of Christ in a bush or in the sky in the that painter has got that Stu fixed up until you have to look at it just in a certain way well then when you once see it when you once see it when you see you look at that picture and they tell you that's Christ and a painting and you can't see you are seeing just clouds so you look and then when you once see it you can't see nothing else but that how many have you ever seen such paintings and every time you look there it is how many ever seen those pictures well that's the way Christ is himself the gospel the message when you want see the message of amen amen amen amen you can't see anything oh I feel like talking in t Oh Glory to God let me tell you once you see the message you cannot un see it once you have received the Holy Ghost and you have been in that experience you cannot unsee it every time you look you see just that again amen that's where the message is everything else is gone the rest is just a filler see when you once see the message that was in Noah's time when they saw the message nothing else matter when mes group saw it nothing else matter when John's group saw it nothing else matter when Jesus group saw it nothing else matter when the apost group saw it nothing else matter when group saw nothing else matter where this group Pentecostal group they pull away from everything by by his for knowledge he predestinated that this things to happen by his for knowledge he predestinated that you will see the message amen hallelujah and now that you have seen the message you cannot see anything else you cannot see anglicanism you cannot see Catholicism you cannot see Pentecostalism you cannot see baptism you cannot see any other now that you saw the Holy Ghost you cannot go back to the hog of see what you used to see as bu now you see as ugly what he used to see as ugly now you see it beautiful your eyes have been washed with eyes s you now can see something happened to you hallelujah what happened you have been built upon the rock Christ Jesus is the rock of when you buil there you now know I'm in a more than a movement I'm in a more than a denomination more than a church I see beyond my pastor I see beyond my church building I see beyond rules ands and don't I see God himself revealed to me come on shout hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord a clap of Praise come on stand up and
