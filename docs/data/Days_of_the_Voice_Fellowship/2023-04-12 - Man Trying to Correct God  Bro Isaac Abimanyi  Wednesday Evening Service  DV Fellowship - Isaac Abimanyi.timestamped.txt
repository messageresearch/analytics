[11:29] on revive Moses
[11:30] has he not spoken also by us and the
[11:34] Lord had it
[11:35] now the man Moses was very Meek above

[20:30] little background of what we want to
[20:31] talk about this evening
[20:34] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[20:36] Christ so Moses was called by God
[20:41] he grew up in the hands of his mother
[20:46] in an indirect way

[20:55] this child telling him
[20:59] we are born for a purpose
[21:02] we are born to redeem Israel

[21:09] knew about
[21:10] because when you read in chapter one
[21:14] hallelujah amen actually chapter two the
[21:18] first one
[21:19] that is where the story is found
[21:22] Moses his mother had to put him on a
[21:27] certain liver to spare him from the
[21:30] persecution
[21:34] of Jesus Christ that is why that is
[21:38] a daughter fellow came and picked this
[21:42] Moses
[21:43] and owned him and took him in the Paris
[21:49] Hallelujah man but then she had because
[21:52] she had no blessed to Bliss feed him
[21:57] she had no mirror to breastfeed
[22:01] what she did she had to find a certain
[22:03] woman
[22:06] who had lost a baby because I told you
[22:10] they were killing the little boys by
[22:11] that time
[22:13] so she wanted to
[23:14] [Applause]

[23:26] and he was expected to be the next
[23:29] Fellowship
[23:31] he had got training
[23:34] of the the trainings of the Egyptians
[23:37] and he was well equipped
[23:43] but he was told by his mom
[23:46] that you are not an Egyptian
[23:49] you are an Israelite one for a purpose
[23:53] so one day as Moses was walking
[23:56] and he found
[23:59] he phoned an Egyptian now saying to
[24:01] fight with an Israelites
[24:05] because inside him he knew he was a
[24:08] redeemer
[24:10] and he had hopes that maybe he can start
[24:14] his Redemption plan
[24:18] or maybe he can start redeeming his
[24:21] rights from that time
[24:24] what he did
[24:28] the Egyptians
[24:30] to serve the Israelites

[31:44] he was imparting in him his wisdom
[31:48] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[31:50] Christ

[37:36] [Music]
[37:46] [Applause]
[38:13] you could not find in any man in
[38:20] Moses to be so humble
[38:25] because in Egypt Moses grew up as a
[38:29] place
[38:31] and he knew it was the next fellow
[38:35] and all Egypt knew that Moses was next

[40:26] trained in the wilderness had to be
[40:29] molded
[40:30] and no man was murdered like Moses
[40:35] Meek like Moses
[40:39] no man was humble like Moses
[40:44] Hallelujah man
[40:47] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[40:48] Christ
[40:51] after giving excuses
[40:54] and then God persisted
[40:57] insisted on him and told him you have to
[41:00] go in here
[41:04] Egypt
[41:07] hallelujah amen and when he reached
[41:10] there he performed with whatever God
[41:12] told him to perform
[41:15] finally got him out
[41:18] hallelujah amen and then they eat they
[41:21] entered the Wilderness
[41:23] where once Moses was

[41:30] now the children of Israel Israeli

[41:39] that is when the troubles started
[41:43] Hallelujah in Egypt in this city they
[41:46] were slaves

[43:29] for them Hallelujah
[43:34] as they wanted to approach it
[43:37] Hallelujah man when they looked behind
[43:40] imagine because their minds wanted to go
[43:42] back in Egypt
[43:45] because they thought they had to cross
[43:48] this uh they had to to uh to go into
[43:51] this water and maybe swim battles
[43:55] because they were there were no ships
[44:01] ever you can think of they could travel
[44:04] by on water
[44:07] so their minds now I wanted to go back
[44:10] in Egypt
[44:12] Hallelujah things he now start to become
[44:14] worse
[44:16] and when they looked behind America
[44:19] Hallelujah thinking of going back
[44:21] they show fellow coming with his
[44:24] chariots
[44:27] first of Egypt was coming after them

[44:36] when they looked on the other side maybe
[44:39] to free to the other side
[44:41] the Bible says
[44:49] not free from that side
[44:51] maybe they say that that's free from
[44:55] when they look there Hallelujah there
[44:59] was also a high look high mountain
[45:01] and they were in between there
[45:04] influence is the Red Sea and the high

[45:30] they started to murmur against Moses
[45:34] started to revile at Moses
[45:37] Hallelujah but Moses was so Meek he was
[45:42] so humble why because of the training he
[45:45] had in the wilderness
[45:48] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[45:50] Christ whenever they could revile
[45:53] against Moses
[45:55] Hallelujah Moses could look at the Lord
[45:58] called upon the name of the Lord come
[46:01] and he called upon the Lord the Lord
[46:04] could provide a solution
[46:06] Hallelujah that is when the Lord told
[46:08] him
[46:09] don't to cry but to speak he told Moses
[46:13] not to cry but to speak
[46:15] hallelujah praise The Wonderful Name of
[46:18] Jesus Christ and that is when the world

[46:30] following them
[46:32] Hallelujah as they reach the reddish
[46:36] even entered the Regency to to maybe to
[46:40] get the Israelites

[51:57] mouthpiece of God
[51:59] the Bible says
[52:04] Moses Eye to Eye
[52:07] could speak mouth to mouth
[52:10] Hallelujah so Moses was a holy man
[52:16] was God his chosen man yeah
[52:20] [Applause]
[52:40] [Applause]
[52:45] it means God could first go to Moses
[52:50] and then Moses could bring the
[52:52] information to the children of Israel
[52:56] could speak to Moses Eye to Eye
[52:59] Hallelujah face to face
[53:01] hallelujah hallelujah man praise God
[53:05] hallelujah now let us get in the Numbers
[53:10] Chapter 12 where we started from
[53:13] that has been the background I've been
[53:16] giving such as you understand
[53:22] this evening
[53:24] foreign
[53:33] [Music]
[53:50] [Music]
[54:07] Hallelujah
[54:37] [Applause]
[54:56] [Applause]
[55:07] event was called the tent of
[55:08] congregation
[55:09] [Music]
[55:11] that is the tent where they could uh
[55:14] worship God from uh
[55:18] Hallelujah man and that tent had three
[55:21] divisions
[55:25] the first place was to cut the holy
[55:29] place
[55:30] and then the holy of holies
[55:34] so there was a tent that was separating
[55:37] the first place to the holy place
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:47] yes and the holy place now let me assume
[55:50] this is the first place
[55:52] Hallelujah man now here was a big
[55:55] cutting cutting
[55:56] that was separating this first place
[56:01] with this next place called The Holy
[56:03] place
[56:05] and when they it reached
[56:13] [Applause]
[56:16] [Music]
[56:18] [Applause]
[56:25] [Applause]
[56:58] because it was a holy place for God
[57:04] for we know God is Holy
[57:07] that is why we are saying Moses was a
[57:10] holy man
[57:12] hallelujah praise God and when Moses
[57:15] died sorry the high priests
[57:19] are performed on that law of Moses
[57:25] himself
[57:27] enter into the Hall of holies
[57:30] God speak to him
[57:32] Hallelujah he could enter when he's
[57:36] having even elope a long Lopez
[57:41] having Bells
[57:43] every day the moment they could spend
[57:46] their days without maybe coming back
[57:52] [Applause]
[57:53] Hallelujah
[58:02] he understood all is he still alive
[58:06] yeah the moment he went there when he
[58:09] had not cleansed himself
[58:11] to die from there that only of holies
[58:16] Hallelujah
[58:24] they could understand this man maybe
[58:27] he's dead
[58:31] themselves
[58:33] [Applause]
[58:34] so in other words it was a holiest place
[58:39] Hallelujah man but by then it was only
[58:42] Moses that could go there
[58:45] again Hallelujah man praise God now when
[58:50] we go when we uh when we get into
[58:53] chapter 12 of numbers
[58:59] here they were still in the wilderness
[59:02] traveling to the promise
[59:05] Hallelujah because they spent in the
[59:08] wilderness for 40 years
[59:12] you can just imagine
[59:14] and before even that is
[59:20] according to the pro to the map
[59:30] Egypt was somewhere here
[59:34] hallelujah hallelujah Egypt was
[59:37] somewhere here and then the promised
[59:39] land was somewhere here
[59:42] they could take for some few days
[59:49] not even three weeks
[59:52] but because God saw their hearts
[59:58] what did he do instead of letting them
[1:00:01] just cross over
[1:00:04] for 14 days 13 days
[1:00:11] [Applause]
[1:00:13] rotating better already
[1:00:16] Hallelujah for 40 years such that he
[1:00:20] might get out the hardiness out of their
[1:00:22] hearts
[1:00:24] [Applause]
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:35] just to bring us here on Earth it would
[1:00:39] be easy for God
[1:00:41] to bring us here on Earth they will
[1:00:45] spend like one week to my whole weekend
[1:00:47] Hallelujah and then we go back home
[1:00:49] today hallelujah amen he has to hear to
[1:00:53] take us through this Wilderness
[1:00:55] for years and years
[1:00:58] take away the hardiness of the hearts
[1:01:02] to take away all the unbelief out of us
[1:01:06] hallelujah man so that's why I tell you
[1:01:09] we are here for a certain impact
[1:01:12] what you have to do is to identify that
[1:01:15] purpose
[1:01:17] then you live according to that purpose
[1:01:23] knowing in your heart
[1:01:26] Second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10
[1:01:29] says
[1:01:30] one day you're going to stand before the
[1:01:33] Lord and then give an accountant
[1:01:44] is on you can put foreign

[1:03:18] Hallelujah yes it says we are going to
[1:03:22] come back for we must all appear before
[1:03:24] the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:03:30] that everyone may receive the things
[1:03:33] done in his body Buddhism
[1:03:38] whether it be good or bad
[1:03:43] Hallelujah just keep that in your mind
[1:03:48] we have to fail to appear before the
[1:03:51] Lord One Day
[1:03:53] by that day we shall be giving an
[1:03:55] accountability the purpose
[1:04:02] so it depends whether you serve the
[1:04:05] purpose or you reject and then you will
[1:04:08] have to give an accountability
[1:04:13] Hallelujah so I was telling you now we
[1:04:16] are in numbers 12. Hallelujah

[1:05:24] and they were singing We are serving the
[1:05:27] lord
[1:05:28] Hallelujah but Hallelujah are we
[1:05:31] together to defend they just now go to
[1:05:33] let us follow on as we are reading
[1:05:35] together
[1:05:37] Moses
[1:05:40] because of the Ethiopian woman
[1:05:43] whom he had married
[1:05:45] so he had married an Ethiopian woman
[1:05:50] they just stopped there for a little
[1:05:52] while don't put it off now
[1:05:55] as I told you when Moses free uh freed
[1:05:59] in the wilderness
[1:06:05] and he was good to that man again
[1:06:10] yes and that man gave him his daughter
[1:06:13] called The Zipper your name
[1:06:16] who was a black woman
[1:06:19] who was an Ethiopian
[1:06:21] Hallelujah man and now okay
[1:06:25] uh they had a child
[1:06:28] called
[1:06:30] praise God and when God met Moses
[1:06:35] during that experience of the burning
[1:06:38] bush in the wilderness
[1:06:41] and then he told him to go in Egypt
[1:06:45] Moses had to go with his wife and his
[1:06:48] son
[1:06:51] to go in there in Egypt deliver the
[1:06:54] children of Israel but the name is
[1:06:55] but as they were traveling again I want
[1:07:00] you to notice something
[1:07:02] very important here
[1:07:04] hallelujah man there is something I want
[1:07:07] to bring to your attention
[1:07:09] Hallelujah man as they were traveling
[1:07:12] praise The Wonderful Name of Jesus
[1:07:14] Christ
[1:07:16] and the Lord wanted to kill Moses
[1:07:22] imagine the man he called
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:21] it was a physical Church
[1:08:25] we are typing a spiritual church that
[1:08:27] was coming
[1:08:30] we are the spiritual church
[1:08:33] are you getting it Hallelujah we are the
[1:08:37] physical children of God
[1:08:39] and we are the spiritual
[1:08:43] they were Israelites in physical
[1:08:46] and we are the Israelites spirituality
[1:08:50] Hallelujah so now uh are they alive
[1:08:54] whatever they went through your neighbor
[1:08:57] item is
[1:09:02] never to go by the ways they went today
[1:09:13] that's why we are reading that Old
[1:09:15] Testament again now it says and it came
[1:09:18] to pass by the way
[1:09:20] that the Lord met him and sought to kill
[1:09:24] him
[1:09:27] Hallelujah man
[1:09:29] then zipporah took a sharp Stone and cut
[1:09:33] off the foreskin over her son I was put
[1:09:36] on natural ginger salad
[1:09:39] and he cast it at his feet
[1:09:43] and he said surely a bloody husband at
[1:09:47] thou to me
[1:09:53] so he let him go America then she said a
[1:09:59] bloody husband Thou Art
[1:10:01] because of the circumcision
[1:10:05] Hallelujah man now when God made Abraham
[1:10:09] Ibrahim he made a covenant with Abraham
[1:10:14] Hallelujah man he made a covenant with
[1:10:17] Abraham
[1:10:18] and then told him that whenever you will
[1:10:22] have a son
[1:10:24] when he makes seven days
[1:10:27] was it seven I
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:10:42] [Applause]
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:11:03] so now
[1:11:05] Moses was also a Jew
[1:11:08] but now here he had he he had a son
[1:11:12] but this son had yet not God circumcised
[1:11:18] and yet God had made a covenant with
[1:11:20] Abraham
[1:11:23] so when as God was looking at Moses
[1:11:27] he was looking at a disobedient person
[1:11:31] because God doesn't change with his wife
[1:11:34] in his word or his work
[1:11:38] his word is ever true
[1:11:41] when he says
[1:11:44] that is
[1:11:45] all sufficient no one can change it
[1:11:49] Hallelujah so God wanted to kill Moses
[1:11:54] are disobeyed in other words
[1:11:57] to circumcise the little boys
[1:12:02] Hallelujah but then this you woman who
[1:12:06] was despised a Baraka woman
[1:12:12] Ethiopian woman
[1:12:15] gave him yes in the wilderness
[1:12:21] [Applause]
[1:12:24] that if you don't circumcise this boy
[1:12:27] your husband is going to be killed again
[1:12:30] Hallelujah Moses was saved
[1:12:34] because of the revelation of zipporah
[1:12:39] he put a sharp Stone and circumcised the
[1:12:42] boy
[1:12:45] Hallelujah man are you seeing how people
[1:12:48] how what people call the mistake
[1:12:53] salvation
[1:12:54] to Moses because surely the Lord was
[1:12:58] going to kill Moses
[1:13:00] if it wasn't for zippers Hallelujah
[1:13:05] now let us proceed in the numbers fear
[1:13:08] of category today

[1:13:43] of Jesus Christ
[1:13:59] as you know Ethiopians
[1:14:10] [Music]

[1:14:30] of this woman
[1:14:32] and they say they hash the Lord indeed
[1:14:35] is spoken only by Moses

[1:31:56] spit in her face should should she not
[1:31:59] be ashamed even
[1:32:03] uh Hashem the seven days
[1:32:06] you can read
[1:32:07] um
[1:32:18] let her be shut out from the camp seven
[1:32:22] days and after that let her be received
[1:32:25] in again
[1:32:32] was shot out from the camp seven days
[1:32:35] and the people Janet known till Miriam
[1:32:38] was brought in again
[1:32:51] Hallelujah man so because of this
[1:32:54] liprised case
[1:32:57] Miriam was closed outside the camp
[1:33:00] Miriam
[1:33:01] we are supposed to travel by that time I
[1:33:04] go to another place
[1:33:06] but because of this situation they
[1:33:10] charity for other 70 days
[1:33:12] when she was outside remember she was an
[1:33:16] example of a person
[1:33:57] she tried to advise God in other words
[1:34:03] that the wife you gave to Moses
[1:34:09] Hallelujah in other words she was trying
[1:34:12] to advise God
[1:34:15] because we saw
[1:34:18] that God gave our Moses this wife for a
[1:34:22] purpose
[1:34:24] and we saw today if it wasn't for this
[1:34:29] woman
[1:34:33] Hallelujah man so that is what we
[1:34:36] started with in Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:34:38] 28.
[1:34:40] all things worketh together for goodness
[1:34:46] Hallelujah when you see something is
[1:34:49] lacking with that passion
[1:34:51] the best thing you can do is to pray for
[1:34:53] him
[1:34:56] Hallelujah otherwise criticizing might
[1:34:59] cause problems to you
[1:35:02] later it might bring lip process to you
[1:35:06] it is not going to be a physically plus
[1:35:09] the way it was to Miriam
[1:35:12] but this time it is going to be a
[1:35:15] spiritually
[1:35:16] because they told you God foreign
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:36:06] [Applause]
[1:36:23] [Applause]
[1:36:37] [Applause]
[1:36:42] yeah maybe maybe you wanted to mean this
[1:36:45] is hallelujah and in that they are they
[1:36:49] are getting together
[1:36:51] they are bringing a cast to themselves
[1:36:54] upon themselves I mean Hallelujah when
[1:36:58] someone makes a mistake in a church
[1:37:01] they tend to criticize him
[1:37:04] hallelujah praise God when a pastor does
[1:37:07] something wrong
[1:37:08] because they criticize when any Minister
[1:37:12] make something wrong
[1:37:15] but just get to know
[1:37:19] your way
[1:37:21] if you do search
[1:37:24] Hallelujah because I told you Israel is
[1:37:27] our mirror is
[1:37:34] hallelujah I think you know that
[1:37:36] so whichever they went through
[1:37:40] the very same things we are going
[1:37:43] through but Hallelujah
[1:37:56] Hallelujah man so God requires you
[1:38:01] if you see anything wrong
[1:38:04] again I mean about a pastor
[1:38:09] or any of your brothers
[1:38:12] just put him in prayer commit to God In
[1:38:16] Prayer
[1:38:17] instead of criticizing that person
[1:38:20] Hallelujah instead of reviling
[1:38:24] Hallelujah just put it in prayer that is
[1:38:28] the meekness that the Lord wants
[1:38:31] in us the humble is he wants in us
[1:38:36] that to an extent that when some person
[1:38:39] does something wrong to you
[1:38:43] you just commit him in prayer
[1:38:46] if they are deployed
[1:38:49] because they were spiritual people the
[1:38:52] other one was a hype list
[1:38:54] and minimum was a prophet
[1:39:54] Moses to this woman
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:55] foreign by to bring to you more troubles
[1:40:58] more than you think
[1:41:00] that's why you see many people are under
[1:41:03] bondage today
[1:41:06] asking why people are watching because
[1:41:09] of the little things they think that are
[1:41:10] little even before God
[1:41:15] bite others
[1:41:17] to discuss the pasta to discuss the
[1:41:21] church
[1:41:23] Hallelujah it is better we take examples
[1:41:26] of them
[1:41:27] because whichever happened to them was
[1:41:30] our example was our examples
[1:41:33] you might take them never to error in
[1:41:36] the same way
[1:41:40] Hallelujah man let me read this quotas
[1:41:43] I'm winding up
[1:41:44] in a message
[1:41:48] as I was with Moses
[1:41:51] in 1960
[1:41:55] September 11th
[1:41:57] it says
[1:42:00] hallelujah hallelujah he says now no
[1:42:04] matter what Moses done
[1:42:07] it was Moses's office that God respected
[1:42:11] yes
[1:42:17] it was really more than a prophet yeah
[1:42:22] it was more than any Prophet they had
[1:42:24] yeah
[1:42:26] when his own sister laughed at him for
[1:42:30] marrying an Ethiopian girl
[1:42:33] called them together and he said don't
[1:42:36] you fear God
[1:42:39] hallelujah man see that's not a good
[1:42:42] thing to Trump upon goddess people
[1:42:46] you hurt him when you do so
[1:42:51] God had commissioned Moses
[1:42:54] he's very has made nothing
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:03] Hallelujah so this person you're
[1:43:06] criticizing
[1:43:12] knows his weakness
[1:43:14] he knows your weakness
[1:43:17] so better commit it to God In Prayer
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:37] Hallelujah man praise God
[1:43:40] in the message respects
[1:44:08] [Music]

[1:45:54] she directly proced that does not come
[1:45:56] to you
[1:45:58] because the Lord doesn't change what he
[1:46:02] did then he's going to do it even now
[1:46:05] Hallelujah is the same God
[1:46:08] hallelujah you just go down pray for
[1:46:12] that person

[1:46:17] she wouldn't have came on her Channel
