see you today and I'm happy to uh see your brother over here uh God bless you thank you for coming and uh my my sister Sarah God bless you nice to see you I'm happy to see Sister Sarah God bless you amen it's been a while we've been still for a long time amen I just lost track of the name there is a sister who called me from is she here okay I'm so sorry I did not grab the name so I'm not sure whether she's here so uh we would like to thank God for all the uh you know the collections as you've been hearing being announced by and you know God is good and we know um if there is one thing we believe here we believe that God is a God that can do Miracles I know that the money we are looking for to buy our land we shall find it it will be a day like this and we shall announce to you that we now have the to to buy the land and it will be a day like this when we shall announce that now we have found a land and we have paid for it and we are moving to how many believe that well if you believe it you should continue on collecting keep the faith don't lose the fire don't be discouraged because is taking longer than you thought you and then if you you pass the test God will surely bless you because one thing I was telling someone one thing I know about God he does not borrow and when you serve him it means you're working for him he pays you he always pays you can you can never work for God and say he never rewarded no matter what you do for him he pays and yesterday I was giving an example to my young people at home um I I've spent uh about two two three weeks with with my bag the one I used to put in my iPad my Bible and my laptop the B I put my laptop and all other things and it it is a good leather bag but it disappointed me because it broke we put on another zip it also broke and so I I I was fed up now I said I don't even have the money because all the money have been given to the land fund I'm spending it on others that I thought needed it more than I did and so I could not I I could not prioritize buying that bag language I could not afford to buy that bag to buy another good nice bag and so uh yesterday we were invited by a sister uh they were celebrating their 20 years anniversary and they invited U my myself and my family to go and be a part of it because their children have been coming to our youth meetings and so they thought we should also go somehow we've been a part of their family and while there I was surprised when the sister stood up to appreciate people with her husband so she stood up and I'm taking a moment to give this testimony because I believe it will be a blessing to someone and she said there is someone else she called a pastor another Pastor other family people father and then she said there's another person I'd like to call he called him he's the pastor of all young people in and he is he's been doing these youth meetings and they have been a blessing to our children and she said that we should do you do them twice a week and she said we can't wait for January said but there is a token of appreciation that I would like to and theyve been a blessing to our children and she's said that we should do you do them twice a week year and she said we can't wait for January and said but there is a token of appreciation that I would like to give and so if you could please come past so I went with my wife we picked it we a few words we went back to our seat so when I arrived home is when I checked and I found inside there was a little not saying the same word she had said and I found a bag a laptop bag exactly what I needed I gave my money to the church land fund how could they think about giving me a laptop back of all things I was like is it a school bag and then I realized it is a laptop and a very nice one which I can carry so friends God is concerned even about the small things and if you serve him he sees where you have need and he provides so should men and women of Faith don't lose your hope if things are not working for you keep giving to the land fun to the land fund keep giving you will see God opening your doors amen there's a sister who called me this week she said I've been collecting money for he said I've been collecting money for something and it's the money is not is not becoming enough and I've been doing it for years said God has dealt with me I resisted I resisted I resisted until Pastor now I'm calling you because I have decided to submit to what the Lord is telling me in my heart to do and she's just a young sister but she gave 550,000 just this week to the land fund now I want you to tell me how can God not bless such a person God would be a liar and he cannot be a liar if you serve him if you sacrifice I mean it's a sacrifice none of us here those of you who are giving can say that you are giving because you have too much who is giving because they have too much none of us it's a sacrifice let us keep sacrificing because it is a noble cause I understand there are people who have been also sending pledges to the team leaders and then they do not fulfill them and the team leaders announce and then they realize that they the I mean the chairman here announces and then he realiz the team leaders don't have the money [Music] it goes back again to sacrifice you pledge because you want to give so fulfill your pledge and even do it more than what you pledge you need something and what you have is not enough they say eat that money but we say give it to the land and God will open doors you shout big amen amen amen so we should um step up our giving so that we leave this place so fast as I'm speaking right now we have um our rent which is due uh as of of the month of June which means next week we need to pay maybe six more months which is a bit a lot of money 4.2 million so we need to give it or take it from the church [Music] land I've made the announcement after the service if you don't do that we shall get the money from Land fund now you see 42 4 million 200,000 if it goes it will take us a little bit behind that is why we need to give when we have really left everything else so that we can get the money we need to get the land I don't know what about I'm tired of [Music] renting who is still having renting I'm tired of renting until when you're tired you cannot give when you feel in your heart that this is God's work I'm going to give unto his work the Lord will account it for you may we stand up and read the scripture this this tomorrow I'm going to ask you to pray for us tomorrow myself and a few brothers are going to L uh where there's a sister from Norway um she she's been contacting me for a while uh she's originally from from L but uh she has a she lives in Norway and some of our family actually has son-in-law in Canada connected me to [Music] her so now she she has a family and they they have a few issues there they feel that we should go and you know have some time with them in prayer and you know take the message to the family so if you please remember me in prayer I'll be traveling on Monday uh with some few Brothers Brother Martin maybe three or four more Brothers for us to go and hold a prayer meeting there so will you please remember us in also we I will need fuel I will need funds for accommodation there for one day so that is I say that to give you an opportunity if you want to be a part of it God will bless you we have a youth service right after the service I think we'll just basically do a question and answer because I know there are some who are running to school so uh we will not take long I'll just you write the questions and then we will uh do the the question the Q and A for about one hour all the young people the youth praise God Amen so because of time let's just go straight away to the scriptures uh had quite a lot of announcements there but I will ready for the word that's 10 not even 10% are we ready for the word all right that's wonderful we are going to the book of Ephesians chapter 2 Sister PE uh is in speckled B going to announce their engagement she informed me and uh chapter 5 chapter 2 verse 5 I would like you today to give me your undivided attention there is a subject I want to deal with a real important subject I'm going to be talking about um the subject will be basting in his work and that the subject but I'm going to be talking about Works Faith [Music] Grace and many times we confuse thinking that what we do is what makes us makes God love us we think that what we do is going to take us to heaven and sometimes we think it is very important to the extent that we don't even think ever think about faith and Grace and others they think that what they do does not matter at all they can live like the rest of the world but today I want us to delve into that subject and may God give us Grace we reading from vers five God bless you musicians that's the singing we will do even when we were dead in sins has he even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus uh unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in flesh in the flesh who are called un circumcision by that which is called a circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world the last verse we shall read verse 13 but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ we'll just pray first and then you'll read when we we are seated let us pray father Lord we want to thank you for the portion of scripture we have read today Lord we have heard it being read and many here have read it from their Bibles father as you know I laed to hear from you and you gave me this inspiration and now ask that you will take me out of the way I am totally nothing Lord in myself I realize that I'm a sinner only saved by grace I pray that you would help me and my brother here Lord inter and may what we speak be un inspired words from you may we all hear from heaven today you may be seated as my brother is reading [Music] for for for amen are we following please let us be sober and follow because as much as I might I don't know I don't know how the Holy Spirit lead but as much might preach I want to teach amen are we following please let us be sober and follow because as much as I might I don't know I don't know how the Holy Spirit lead but as much as I might preach I want to teach and so please give me your undivided attention so that we can learn the word of God together Amen Let us also read Galatians chapter 6 verse 14 for God forbid that I should Glory serving the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world now how many here are believers if you believe in in the message you believe in Jesus Christ did you notice that some people are not sure how many here Believers okay now I see I have many Believers because they say they are believers what if somebody asks you what do you boast in what makes you feel you are special many times we have said even while we are preaching that we are a special people are we special because we claim that we are believers or are we special because we do things [Music] different what makes us special what makes us boss where is our boasting so I want you to pay attention and may God make this real to us today now I'd like us to see here that God created Man In His Image but in the beginning man fell from this place because man was the perfect image of God and God is a perfect God he's a God who was not a sinner of course and a God who could not sin and so man was also in the same way perfect he was like God he was not a sinner and he could not sin he was created in the image and in the likeness of God so when we talk about man being created and F in the image of God we are not really talking about this flesh this is not what we're talking about if you go back to Genesis chapter 1 the Bible explains male and female created he them so but you could not see them it was in chapter two that he went and now molded man out of the ground and then breathed into his nostr the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so in other words man was already created before he was formed how many understand that he was created already before he was form and Hallelujah and that man who was created was the man in the image of God not this one here all right but now we see that something happened when man was formed and Man became a living Soul you know he now fell from the place where God had placed him he man of course I'm trying my thoughts are running here and there trying to see a lot of things and I'm trying to yield to the Holy Spirit to see where which direction to take you know when when you're listening and you going to the word the word is very rich and there are many roads you can take you can drive your faith will drive me today which direction I will take so don't wor you can say Amen from to time so we see that man at the beginning he fell from that place now no matter what man did after the fall no matter what he in himself what he could do nothing could restore him to his original place so man could was Fallen nothing to restore him the relationship was gone and man was eternally separated from God tell someone death is separation so man died in the face of God man could no longer be in relationship with the father nothing you could do that could save and in the Book of Ezekiel 18:4 the scripture says behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is the soul that sinth it shall die so man as a living Soul he sinned and he fell from Grace let me not use what that word yet he fell from his place he fell from the place of perfection are you following he fell from the place of perfection and Man became insuff now listen from that moment anyone that was born out of that lineage was born a sinner and I will stop right there for a moment and I will say this did you know that whatever your father did and he did not overcome it was passed down onto you many times we fight against things we fight against feeling we fight against spirits but you find down the line the thing came from behind there what your father never overcame if your father did not overcome adultery imal living you find all through your family that thing is following you you find that it's the same demons that come and begin to press on you if there was if your father was a good liar you will find that you also you somehow become a good Li if your father was a very angry man you also find you are a very angry man some of you are seed here and behaving as if you don't know what I'm talking about but I know you are understanding it because you are struggling with things that your fathers did not overcome and that is why it is very important for us as Believers to overcome these things because if we cannot overcome them then it will be passed on down to our generation so you see we are people who now should realize who we were before we came into the world our genealogy should go beyond our natural fathers because you cannot be able to understand you know if I tell you that you are not supposed to be a sinner when your body is telling you otherwise how can you be able to understand but let me tell you that you had a life before this life and that life is a real life is is the life before the fall and whoever was a seed of God was there in the mind of God before the fall but now after the fall we were all born according to the last of the flesh according into the natural birth of of our fathers and that is after Adam that is after Adam you understand Abra Adam God gave birth to the first child and the first child was born under perversion he was born in sin he was born defeated and his son gave birth to his to another son and his son gave birth to another son now it doesn't matter which race we are from we are really all from Adam can I have more sound brother my voice was a bit affected so we notice here that we are all from One race and that is the human race and sister fortunate the whole human race is a sinful race there is no one that is Holy why not because they have done good or bad but because they are born in sin you didn't get it we are sinners not because we sin but because we were born in a nature that is all the children of Adam which we are we were born Fallen we were born like him fallen from our original position but if you were are sons of God there is a jam of Life somewhere in us which keeps calling to that other life that's why when we hear the word we respond to that now let us look at this a little more now so the soul that sins that Soul shall die that was from the mouth of God what death is he talking about death is separation so when he says the soul that sins it shall die is meaning it will be eternally separated from God all right I want you to look at Genesis chapter 2 ver 16 all right I told you we shall have a little study this morning so I would like us to take our time and go through the scriptures and the Lord God formed the man saying of every tree now this is Genesis 2 of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shal not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die Genesis 2:16 and 17 Genesis 25 16 16 all right are you following me I need your amens yes yes keep them coming so we can move deeper into the scrip all right so now we we notice here that now God now in the beginning when he had formed man he created man and then he formed him after he formed him out of the Dust of the ground and Man became a living Soul he told him of every tree you can eat but there is one tree which you cannot eat and that's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil let me first talk about that in a moment there were three categories of trees in the garden there are the first category was the was the trees that were good for food like for example like what mangoes PE apples come on keep them coming jul I don't know how they call jambul in English jack fruit and all these so those were trees in the garden and they were good for food but now there was this other category of these trees now these ones they were in the middle of the garden now these were not physical trees this this was just Bible language but it is meaning something else the first category the first category in ones of the the ones which were in the middle it was the tree of life now the tree of life was not a physical tree this word tree here it is a symbol it means person God always in the Bible in in Bible language always God uses the word tree to mean person or to mean man for example you remember in the Book of Psalms when I mentioned these verses Brothers you should pull it up Psalms chapter 1 the Bible talks about a man it says blessed is the man who walks not in the councel of the ungod how many remember that and then he continues on to say but you know he meditates in the law of God both day and night he says he shall be like a what like a tree now the ones who are not who don't read bibles are wondering where is that one coming from how many love the Bible amen you should read the Bible he shall be like a what like a tree brother Marin there some people who don't read the Bible they're waiting for you to put they shall be like a he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water amen now is referring to a man who walks not after the C of the ungodly he says he is like a tree and we know that also in other parts of scripture he refers to Israel as trees aloy trees he refers to Christ as a to Israel as fig trees and then he refers to Christ as an olive tree and how the Israel they are the branches Romans 11 so in other words we see all through scripture that the word tree means a person and so who is the Tree of Life in The Book of Revelation he says to him that overcometh I will give to him to eat of the tree of life so how will they eat the Tree of Life this tree of life is not eaten like you eat aus no how do you eat of it you eat of it by hearing and believing because this tree is not a physical tree this tree is a man this tree is a person and and he came here on Earth and he declared himself when he walked in the streets of Jerusalem and he said I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man come to the father but by me now Jesus declared he was the tree of life so he's the man of life so it's the tree which was in the middle of the Garden in Genesis that Adam and Eve were eating from how the Bible says he came every evening he came every evening and they would eat from him and they would eat from him and they would eat from him they could never die they were Eternal they were perfect they were sinless as long as they were eating from the Tree of Life Hallelujah but that was before the fall and then he said but the man that shall see that man shall die meaning that man will be separated from me forever all right so now in Genesis he now tells them what will kill them he says you can eat of all the trees you can eat the Trees of the trees good for food you can also eat of the Tree of Life which I am the one but but there is one tree which they were forbidden to eat over and that was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil what was that tree if the tree of life was a man the person of Life the tree of knowledge was also a person a person it was not a physical tree oh my I wish I had the time but I'll just rehearse it and I will not go into the scriptures to read because we need to finish what the thought I have for so when you go to the Book of Ezekiel in chapter 28 how many are following in the Book of Ezekiel 28 he talks about the the the king of TI tius I think and he says that this was perfect was perfect until evil was found in him the Bible says he was created but then again the Bible says he was an angel that covered who was he he was an angel in heaven and in the book of Isaiah he talks about what his name was says his name was Lucifer now that Lucifer what did he do in the Book of Revelation he speaks about him when he says there was war in heaven and and the dragon fought and his angels and and he says who was that dragon that Dragon was Satan that old Ser he calls him that the dragon he was Lucifer as an angel but when as the Bible describes in the book of Isaiah he lifted himself and he wanted to be above the stars of God and he was so proud of how beautiful he was the Bible in the Book of Ezekiel speaks of his pipes his voices he was a good singer he was an angel in heaven not just an angel he was the angel that cover the angel that cover means he was the one that had more than two Wings he was always around the presence of God he was not just any normal Angel he was one of the captains among the angels of God and so when he fell he did not fall alone he F he was able to convince many angels in heaven to agree with him that he can actually take the Throne of God that's why if you want to know that the devil is in someone they will be very proud that's why the Bible says Pride precedes a fall you have to be humble the Way Up Is Down and the way down is up if you want to be anything in life humble yourself we hear so much about a super rest some people they think their tribes are higher than others we are all seeing by gra there is no tribe that is special only Israel only Israel and we the Christians are the spiritual Israel all right so we see that this angel fell from heaven the B says and when they fought Michael fought with the dragon and and Michael defeated the dragon and the dragon his place was no longer fall in and he was cast out out of heaven and where did he go he came down to the Earth and in the book of of Ezekiel 28 he tells us where exactly he went he says Thou was in heaven give me the scripture Brother come on you were in heaven brother in Eden thou was in Eden the Garden of God when he was cast out from Heaven he went to Eden are you hearing me Satan went to Eden but where in Eden was he because remember Satan is a spirit he's not flesh and blood he was a spirit like all the others Angels They Are Spiritual Beings are you following me so far I don't want to go so fast so I lose keep keep saying amen so we know this here that when he went down to Eden he had a mission when he fa yeah right there when he failed in heaven he decided to come and try on Earth he came down to Adam because he knew Adam was the son of God and he came down to try down here on Earth well that's why the Bible says who unto the inhabit of the Earth because he came down with a a mission to defeat Adam and take his place so now when he came down into Eden he was a spirit now people stop there and that's why we need a prophet that's why we need a prophet that's why we need a prophet that's why God uses prophets because there are sudden things other ministers cannot understand that theology cannot understand and it takes a prophetic eye to see in the past and in the future to be able to tell you the mind of God and that's when a prophet came and told us that when the devil came down in the garden of Aiden he went straight for the woman but how did he do that because he was a spirit and and the woman was a body was a flesh that the devil found one of the beasts not just any Beast he found the best the one which was the wisest of all the Beast that the Lord God had made some people think that God made a snake God did not create a snake it is a snake as a result of a cur are you hearing me the Beast that the devil went to could talk could reason could think and furthermore that Beast had a seed and that seed of all the beasts of the ground that seed was the only seed which could mingle with the human race to bring forth a child and the devil knew that that's why he came to this and he did not need permission because animals are not free moral agents you remember when God Amen in Jesus Christ he went to that tombs of GAD and he found this demon possessed SM you know the demons began shouting have you come to take us and kill us before our time and then they baded please send us to the pig and Jesus did like this and they all went to the pig now the the pigs were now demon possessed now they began running shouting with a loud sound it was not the big shouting it was a demon shouting in the pigs and when the when the pigs went in the water they drowned the pigs died but the demons never die those demons are here today and if you remember those demons that made that man naked he was no longer dressing but when they left him he started dressing so we have many people who don't want to dress because they demon possessed but let me tell you if those demons can leave them they will amen get shame and they will be able to dress up they will cover themselves you find women Min you know they want to you know take and cover you know wrong Spirit among the young men among the young women until the minds of the people this generation is completely rotten why because of what they see oh young sister don't let the devil use you amen you should be a different person but we shall come back to that so we find when those demons left and they went into the pigs the pigs died but the demons are still alive today those demons are here in Camp those demons are here even inong they all over the world and they undressing women and they have even started addressing the men all right I will not go into that direction let me not go that way I want to keep the thought here but I was being tempted to go there all right listen are you following me we find that now this these demons did not die but they used the pigs so the pigs were victims of circumstances and by the way those pigs died so don't say that pigs have demons the pigs that got demon possess they die so the demons the pigs we have today don't have demons so you can enjoy a por meal it has no demons in it all right so we see that you know when these demons left the pigs the pigs died you would feel sorry for those pigs because they were victims they were caught in the Cross Fire they were just there and then demons enter because they did not have an authority to reject in the same way in the garden of aen when that old serpent the devil he came down in the garden and he found a beast he found a beast called the Bible calls it in lug know it but it was a beast Hallelujah this Beast was like me having hands and having legs and having a mouth and having eyes and having even ears and a nose and it could talk and it could reason the only thing it did not have was a SW that is the only difference between us and that be that one was the only spe which was closest to the human race and it was living in the garden of Ed when the devil came he knew this Beast can be able to I can be able to borrow the body of this beast and then inject my seed into the human [Music] race and this Beast had a seed and the devil wanted to borrow that seed and teach the human rest something new ince something and that's exactly what happened the Beast was just there in the garden and then it felt something coming what's that and then it felt you know when demons come in in a creature become very strong you've seen people who are demon possess they're very strong if they would punch you you may even lose all your tooth they start walking is the the Bible did not say it was craing you see those things those pictures the ones you saw when you were a child a snake cing and then coming in the tree and then the Snak speaking did God say if snakes can talk why are they no longer talking now snakes cannot talk that one was a beast that image you have in your head is not bibical remove it right now trash it it was a beast that could walk and talk and when it came down it spoke to Adam to e and he said did God said you cannot eat of the trees if said no God did not God said we could eat but he said there is one tree we cannot eat of is the tree of knowledge that one he said we shouldn't even touch it now she added on the word by saying we should not touch it because she was very excited and then she added and when she added the serpent was Happ no you will not die you also took away from now listen listen carefully that serpent the Bible says beg the woman how many are 18 years and above you you know what the word beg is when you beg somebody you are enticing them to accept what you are saying so that you can do something with them are you following me that's what the Bible says the serpent beg the woman and the woman was convinced now the Bible stops there and it simply says she at all right now if you don't understand that's Bible language but what is the eating remember this the tree of knowledge do we know do you know right now you are eating do you know you eating you eat by hearing and accepting so the woman by hearing and accepting what the serent said but remember this eating when she was convinced when she accepted she took of the fruit of the and of it so there was an action in and later on we find out later on that when Adam comes the Bible says she also introduced to the man and together with her they did it and that was the original what was it now now now this is very don't don't miss this one don't miss this one what was the original the original happened between The Serpent and the woman are you following it did not happen between Adam and it was between The Serpent and the woman first Timothy chter 2 it is just right in there I want you to look at it quickly now I wish you had given me the verse here I would just Contin all right right what does it say verse 14 Adam was not deceived everybody say that verse Adam do we believe this to be the word of God Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so what did she do she committed adultery it was a sin of adultery but remember sin was already done before even had doubted what is the sin sin was unbelief the moment she believed the serpent she had unbelieved God and she had sinned and she was a separ from and this adultery was only the fruit of the tree it was the outcome because you reject the word you tell the lie because you reject the word you go and do wrong actions but the sin is unbelief and that's what happened and then adultery came as a result and the serpent injected his seed into the womb of the woman and he brought forth Cain was not a son of Adam never the Bible proves it I only don't have the time today but if you ask me in a youth meeting I'll give you the verses listen we find out all that when when Cain came into the world he was of another nature his nature was not the nature of Adam his nature was the nature of the serpent now now now listen when the serpent used when the devil used the serpent he came out and and and and Adam he himself together with his wife after both of them had SE now when God comes down he asks Adam where are you he says I'm hiding here because I'm naked said who told you you are naked he said have you eaten of the tree have you taken the fruit of the tree that I told you not to eat was the tree of knowledge the tree of knowledge was Satan he has both good and evil in him praise God praise God and we notice Adam says yes I have done it and then he adds but it was the woman it was the woman you gave me she's the one who introduced this thing to me God said all right woman why have you done this God Papa God it is also not me it was the Ser who beged me he enticed me until I accepted and God said that's what you have done because you have done this you are going to suffer whenever you are giving back to these children who are in your you have to read the Bible with understanding and until today there is pain and suffering when women are giving back even when they Believers because that was added because of the law it was added because they accepted to give birth this way not in the will of God it's a permissive will and that's why it has pain on it but God promised the Believers those who believe he will save them in that per and give them salvation out of that that child back meaning they will be saved they not die they will not die when giving birth they will not lose their children they will not die why it is the grace of God all right now follow me closely here now the woman she was that transgression that thing was added upon her because of the sin to the man he said you because you have done this from today you are going to suffer you are going to T the ground and you will sweat you will work that's why I believe it is the duty of a man to work and sweat for his family it is not your wife's duty to work for you can I have the man shouting a man listen listen I am not preaching to you what you want to hear I am telling you what the Bible says so you will excuse me if you don't like what I'm saying it is a man's duty to work to sweat to labor and provide for his wife and children if he can't do it the Bible says is even worse than unid infid yes it is not a duty of a woman to go out there and labor and suffer and provide for his house for her house no it is a man's responsibility and that is why if your wife doesn't have to work you don't have to force her but these days it is no longer men forcing women to work women who have refused their position and their place in the home in the family may God give us more women with a backbone to raise their children to raise their family in the fear of God the reason why we have amen child deliquency is because we have parent delen parents are no longer parents children are raising themselves they don't have a father they don't have a mother and that's why their eyes are all out doing everything they want to do because they are not raised you need to understand a child must be raised by a parent who is God Called to be a mother or a father is a calling Hallelujah but they have rejected it why because they rebellious but we as Believers we have been told where we understand we are not saying a woman cannot work all right the Bible talks about her in Proverbs a woman who supports her husband she's a virtuous woman why it's not easy to give birth to Children raise them and then on top of it support your husband it is not easy women who do it they need to be respected but they must do it with agreement of their husband that's what the Bible tells us and I'm preaching to you the message of the hour hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord all right so now go then came to the serpent when he came to the serpent he didn't even have any words to ask him serpent why did you do this I will tell you today why God never asked the serpent the reason is the serpent was only a victim it was the devil but the serpent was you used his body was used his mouth was used his brains was used his seed was used and because of that God could not ask it because he didn't have free wasn't a free AG but God made sure that that will never happen again how did he do it he told you Ser because you have accepted to be used from today you will no longer have legs from today you will no longer have hands you will no longer eat like human beings eat I'm removing your mouth I'm even going to make you it dust and even you will crowl on your belly and the moment God say those words a power came on the it became a snake a snake we see today is because it was cast but remember this Beast was the most handsome and most wise of all Beasts of the ground even today in its cast form it is very wise the moment a snake comes out of the egg it can eat it can bite very wise to the extent the Bible says be wise as serp but Harless as DS why because a serpent was wise when it was a beast even now to the Snake Still wise still beautiful on the outside see the snake skin very beautiful they make shoes and other things out of it very beautiful and the devil likes beautiful things I'm sorry if you're beautiful today the devil ask beautiful things you got to all the prostitutes the devil will never pick ugly he will pick the beautiful yes he will pick the beautiful ones you look at all the homosexuals he will not pick ugly boys they are those ones who look so handsome they are the ones he will use because the devil likes beautiful things but why are we here we are here to give notice to the kingdom of darkness that this beauty is given to us by God there are still a people that can live for God and use their beauty to serve the Lord and to show that God still has a generation that will serve him that will live for him that's why the bride is on Earth to prove to the devil the beauty wasn't meant for you no the reason I'm beautiful is not to go on Tik Tok and share how my lips are very juicy that's not why I'm beautiful I am not going to do that TR believers don't do that trash stay away from that trash when others are using social media to display their beauty as a bunch of tomatoes and [Music] mangoes the bride of Christ will not do that they will keep their beauty for their husband they will keep their beauty for the Lord they will use their body to serve God why because our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost amen praise the name of the Lord now the denominational people they don't like these things I'm saying but what I'm saying are facts and you find younger girls and these days even younger boys take the smartphones and they go there you find them posting on their status and there is a music in the back of the world even if it has Jesus in it the songs because they have filthy spirits on them we can see it by what you doing you can't put a spiritual song in the background you put that F the song and then you post on your may God have Mery may God have mercy young people of DVS don't be entailed in that trash stay away from it stay clear from it why because you are special we are not like them no no no no no we have to be different and I'm I'm I'm I'm going in the beginning to show you how everything started so now we find that the serpent was cast Never Again to have a child in the human race but the effects of that we can still feel it everyone that is born is born in a way of perers you know when job was suffering he shouted meaning he was trying to say it was not job the flesh shouting it was that soul in him crying out said oh God in sin did my mother consider I'm only trapped here Lord but I don't belong here we have a body a body that is not sin all the children of God and when you born the moment you're born that body is right in the presence of God that body but the more sins you do that body begins moving towards hell but that's why even children children you should be careful how you treat them do you know you can speak certain words to that child and it can take them to hell don't just cuss children speak sharp words speak vgar words they are little angels don't just show them anger don't provoke them why because they Angel what is it is a theop body is before the presence of God and don't grieve them even he says the kingdom of God will be like the little children children don't go to hell they go to heaven why because the theop is right they many things we can talk about but I want to follow the we should know who we [Music] are see we all have that body which is sinless and it's a the body now when you hear the word of and you accept it you are connecting with that the praise God there are many many things I promise you not to to be so long so let me follow the thought here are you still following now the tree of knowledge good and evil was Satan and Eve and Adam ate from him and when they did they died did you hear what I said they died when did they die as soon as they at death is what separation from God that's why no man has ever lived for one day the day you eat of in that day you eat thereof you will die you will die within that day you can't go beyond that day one day to God is a thousand years no man has ever lived for 1,000 years no man since Adam meth lived 969 has ever lived longest and that's why today we die at 78 it is going on reducing red because we cannot live for one day but brother sister when we go into our real bodies we shall live for more than one day because we shall have a millennium a millennium is one full day 1,000 years we will be eternal like he is but Adam died Adam was eternally separated from and there is nothing Adam could do that could save him and that's the part I want us to look at Genesis 3 6 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did itat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they solded fig leaves together and made themselves up now are you following me CH back there are you following I want you to see this when they sinned Adam took his wife we have now sinned we are now naked what are we going to do they went and they began their Works tell your neighbor they began their works good works right they were were naked and they wanted to cover their naked was that a bad work they were good works all right they began their works Adam we are sinners yes yes my wife we are sinners so what are we going to do let us dress properly because now we have seed let us get the cloes cover yourself cover where are you going to cover now I have these breasts okay okay I'll cover those breasts and also now because now we are sinners their works we are good but never good enough no amount of works you can do that will be good enough there are many Believers of this message who think they works is giving them a ticket to the rapture oh you know I'm doing my hair certain way oh you know me I dress like this there are many people who dress so well but when they are very big Sinners you can agree with me if you believe what I'm saying dressing so well talking so well does not take you to heaven and I'm not going to add anything on it that is the truth you know me I'm cutting my hair a certain there are many people who are very judgmental they will be the ones to to tell anybody and everyone that they are going to hell because they cutting a certain St brother how can you make your hair like this you're going to H unless you repent sister oh how can you dress like this you're going to hell unless you repent now Pastor are you saying works are not good works are good but I'm saying our works that we do within ourselves because of necessity are never good enough they are never good enough to buy you salvation Salvation is not up for sale you cannot bribe God some of you think you're going to go out there and do your things and then you come here dress well and that's where God will take you to heaven you can never blve God your Works cannot be a ticket to heaven the works that you do Adam sold fig leaves with his wife and they hid themselves they say now we are comfortable we have now done so well when God comes he will surely be happy with us we have many believers who are like that and maybe some of them are here you think because you go to a a message church and you don't wear earrings and you don't use makeup and you don't wear Min SC and and you don't wear those high heel you think you are going to heaven I am sorry you are not going because of that you are you are not going because of that none of what you have done none of what you are going to do will be the basis of you being a Rapture material my daughters are you hearing are you hearing don't you think that because you call yourself a message believer and you dress well you don't use makeup that now you going to theup when we talk about I'm thinking about the Rapture you even be so happy brother don't you see how I'm blessed me when I dress I dress very well even my dress can sweep the ground I'm thinking about the I feel like I'm already sorry you may be surprised to remain that's why I told you today I was teaching because I don't want us to think we can bra God I want us to understand what salvation is I want us to understand what the message is I want us to understand what is it that we believe some people have made this message A bunch of Dos and Dons this message let me tell you this message is beyond dos and don'ts it is beyond that much beyond that if you give me a few more moments I'll will prove that to you praise the name of the Lord so they so fig leaves together they met Hallelujah they made themselves aons they made themselves good works brother because I do this is that one a Believer no he's not a Believer can't you see he's having an earring can't you see having a Min we as human beings we determine Believers like that but God goes beyond he goes beyond your works now are you fighting against good works at all if you give me time by the end of it all you will be satisfied in the message power of transformation but don't wait until you understand to say Amen just say Amen now in God aen they were naked and they did not know it and now now today in Satan be it by science and education they are naked again and they don't know it what a perversion look at today look at man trying to wear his wife's underneath clothes and she's trying to wear his cles man in a sh which a woman is supposed to put on inside you find him putting on walking inket you are naked and you don't know it you are putting on a short clothes your wife is supposed to put on find a woman putting on a man put on a Je and he's trying to let his hair grow like hers and she's cutting hers off like Jes oh oh oh my man trying to be a woman women trying to be a man what a perversion that's the same thing in the church is doing the same thing today church are you listening church are you still listening the reason that they didn't know they were naked in the beginning there was a holy spirit Veil which veiled them from nakedness hallelujah amen tell your neighbor Holy Spirit In the Beginning they had it on their eyes but theend that's why they not know they were naked so don't don't say me I am naked like like no there is another Veil on you now after the fall there is another Veil at first the Holy Spirit was over their eyes they see nothing but their brother and sister the holy they didn't know they were naked but now everybody said now the spirit of unholiness the speed of unlean and last has veiled them education and science at first when you would see a sister when Adam saw Eve he was not he was okay even now you can't understand it because there's another Veil on you now the veil of last unlean and unholiness that one cannot make you understand what we it's Avail on the people now the moment they look even a man of God he looked go bring another Veil why it is scientific they say wear shorts it is cooler the Indians teach you better than that they wrap up in a blanket to be air condition education has absolutely come back to a Time the very thing that they think that brought them our culture and civilization it has put them back again in ignorance again was they were in the first place when man realized he was naked he took upon himself to dress to dress with a leaves Aron this was man's Wisdom and Science by man was very wise he became so wise do you remember what the devil told them if you eat of this tree God is lying you are going to become wise you will be like him indeed go they become wise but their wisdom what did it tell them their wisdom told them to make Leaves and make up and they thought they can cover themselves were wise because that's what they they needed to do but they did it wrongly you will be wise in your own concept by knowing that you need to dress women today are wise they know they need to dress but they not doing it correctly because there is a wrong Spirit on them this wisdom it was agreeable to man so today you find people who believe it does not matter what you why they have a veil on them they claim God looks at our hearts only and not our clothes they have a veil on them you also find those who believe that you wear what you wear makes you a Believer both of them are wrong so you find people who are very good at gossiping but they busting about how good their dress code is very Immortal people but very proud on how they look s and then you have on the other side those ones who say it doesn't matter what I dress it doesn't matter God looks at the god they are they are blinded see both sides are wrong are you hearing me both sides are wrong if you think what you wear serves you you are wrong if you think what you wear doesn't matter you are wrong both of you are having a wrong of fa it is none of these that qualify you before God oh praise God the Bible in the book of Isaiah 646 he says that we we all are as unlean thing and all our righte as filthy rugs all our righteousness tell your neighbor all my righteousness is as a filthy RS oh my good Lord our righteousness is filthy rugs brother we cannot boast in any good thing that we have done or in any good thing we can do that's what Adam fa to understand and when God came down what did he do did he clap thank you my son oh you're wise you have dressed yourself God was angry what do you think you're doing and God went this is what I want to get to youday God went and this is the only thing that can save us and take us to the god went looking at the condition of his son and he went to his ship and took one squeezed it squeezed it cut the ne blood SP blood went all over and then he began skinning it must have been a great work it must have been a great work peeled and when he brought it he dressed you it was still dripping with blood and he dressed him he Adam I want you to dress this one yes you were wise you have to dress but not your own righteousness not your Works my work not yours my work and that's what God is saying to us today many people are doing their Works God wants his work to be reflected in [Music] us as I'm continuing let us read the scripture we read and and you see what I was talking about it says for by Grace Hallelujah my M this powerful for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves everybody said not of myself it is the gift of God and he says not of Works L any man should BST hallelujah amen not of works there is nothing I've done please open your mind and understand what I'm saying there is nothing I can do that can save me oh Wretched Man that I am but then here he say we are his workmanship we are his workmanship meaning he has a work if you understand that say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah Jesus Christ God himself has done a work and he says we his workmanship created in Christ Jesus and you didn't get it what we are created brother what whose works we are created un good works you didn't understand you would be shouting now so let me explain now when he did his work he's saying we became his workmanship Hallelujah and then he says we were actually ordained that none of our works can do it but it says here we were created in who who is your father now remember each of you has a father and I was and I was born in him born out of him and as born out of him all my works are trash but then he says oh my this is so sweet I wish you could get he says now we we are his work okay let me say this way now right now as I'm speaking in this flesh I am the workmanship of my father pet [Music] you are the workmansh of yourbody speak the name of your father father's name father come here who is your father Francis Francis who is your father who is your father who is yours who is yours some people can't dare say don't you worry if you're not proud of of your father you have another father because me with my lies with my theft with my lust with my immorality with my weaknesses I am a workmanship of my physical father but but I've been born again I have another father am and the Bible says I am a workmanship amen of my father created not not born in flesh but created in Christ Jesus and what un what unto good works is saying I was created to do good works the only works you can do Hallelujah and there will be acceptable to God is those ones that come out of Christ you've heard the word you've been gripped you've been convicted and then you're like oh God forgive me for wearing us have mercy on me it comes from the Holy Ghost sister you say I will never do that thing again because feel I'm Different what is that that you're feeling you are the workmanship of your new father you canot that's why we say the things I used to do I do them no more you have good works that come out of your father your real father you can no longer smoke you can no longer drink you can no longer commit imortal but not because you are waiting for someone to see you you find them coming to church and they wonder they waiting let me see what would say and Pastor looks at you and then you keep quiet and then when he keeps quiet you go back home you see even P never said anything about me it means I'm dressed properly you I manip of your biological father but if you workmanship of Christ you not going to wait for your pastor to commment for your mother to commment for your father to commment for your sister to commment you are going to want to know what will God command me Hallelujah okay give me a few more moments and I will try to find a place where we can suit but I feel we still need a little more doors here listen listen so they made themselves arons and we find here is none of these things that you qualify before go that you do in your own you have been forced to do things because they want you to behave like that you know let me show you something all of you open Matthew 19 open Matthew 19 chapter 16 please and I beh and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may be I may have eternal life and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou Willl enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which which Jesus said Thou shalt not murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and mother and thou shall not shall love thy neighbor as thyself the younger man said unto him oh this things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet and Jesus said unto him if thou Willl be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions listen in no way is Jesus saying Good Works can save us [Music] s please stay with your stay with me stay with me for a few more don't get tired in your mind amen now here Jesus I feel what I'm teaching today is going to help a lot of people and that's why I'm taking my time and I want you to follow me Clos Jesus is here speaking to a man who has come to him asking what he can do that will give him etal life and Jesus answered the man he said you know the works of the Lord God do them now I know we have talked about this many times but today as I was studying it there's another touch to it and I wanted to follow Clos and and the man said I've done all these Works loving God with all my heart oh I've done that one loving my neighbor I that one listen in the man's [Music] lens he was perfect he had seen that his works we and he had given himself tick tick and he had told God that is Jesus Christ I am good I am perfect and and remember when he first came he told him good master and Jesus said what why do you call me good only God is good to try to show him there is no one who is good no human being that is good only God is good but here he was also saying something that some of you did not see he was telling him I am God you didn't get it cuz he was telling him he called him good Master why do you call me good only God is good but he did not say I am not good the word of God is so delicious I tell you he's trying to tell you I am if you're calling me good that means I am godu praise the name Lord the man claimed to have all the Commandments Jesus exposed the GRE in this man he exposed he didn't love God or his neighbor with all his heart because with the law of Works none of us can ever match up with God's standard of [Music] righteousness God has standard but many times we we measure God according to our standard tell your neighbor God has a standard God has a standard tell someone behind you there do tell them God has a stand God has a standard brother can you tell brother samel slap him and tell him God oh this one is just touching him is your big brother you give him a him God stand praise the name of the Lord how many enjoying the word I tell you the word is so delicious amen right now we are eating we are eating and we are growing so here God's standard is righteousness and but Adam was below God stand because he only covered here and when God came he covered everywhere that was God standard but Adam could not do God's standard on his own needed a supernatural hand now you see why you need to be filled with the Holy Spirit if you're not filled with the Holy Spirit you will never make it to the rapture the reason is you will do good works but you will never fit God's standard this man was good in all his Works he said I've loved my neighbor I've Loved God with all it's all right here you called me God so let me tell you you have riches go sell everything and give the money to the god tested him on two occasion scenarios number one sell everything give to the poor the poor is who your neighbor remember the law was saying love your neighb with all your heart right and also love God with all your mind all your heart so now you called me God and you said you love your neighbor all right sell what you have give to your neighbor and then come follow me I am God right you said I'm good I told you only God is good all right so since I'm good then I am God come follow me the man right there he began shaking all my riches I cannot sell all my riches and and give to the poor why did they work for themselves he the man didn't love his neighbor as himself many of you say you you doing good things when God puts you on his on his balance you realize you are naked he the man didn't actually love his neighbor as himself the man was selfish he wanted to have his riches for himself so you he couldn't measure up to the righteousness of God but he thought he loved his neighbor because he used to throw something to them but that was his righteousness but God is righteousness give all he said no and then I follow you you you who has nothing but Jesus was like I thought you called me God who do you call God do you realize you love God with all your heart you have to forsake all so if you can't forsake all for this truth then you don't love God with all you and many of you say a Believer but the moment you have a V at home you won't even show up in church you love God believe sincere if you are truly convinced you going to be concerned you are my mother you my friend you my whatever you found me going to church let us go together because you want them to love the god you love you want them receive what you have received but you find believer staying at home I had a v God have mercy do you love God with all your heart are you willing to sacrifice everything for this truth what truth God is truth now this man was wide on the balance and he was found lucky the law proved that man was a sinner and needed a Sav you didn't get it again I don't know whether you're tired or what you didn't get it this man had done everything the Lord said but he never mashed up to God's righteousness so what did the Lord do what did the Lord do the LA only proved he was a sinner do this don't do that do this do that there are many believers who do those things and who don't do things but the only thing they have proved to God is their Sinners it does the same thing today what we need is not our works what we need is his work we need a savioru in his work we can burst in our wordss we cannot bust but we can burst in his finished let me read this for you there he hangs on the cross you will never have to stand the Judgment God judged your sins in him God judged him and he took your place there is something I'm trying to come to to conclude now God took his your place in him we were guilty eared from God without hope without Mercy we were Gentiles away to D Idols alens from God and Christ brother Enoch Christ took our place and you notice Abraham slept and everybody slept but Christ died separated in his death God wasn't with him he had to suffer the absence of God in his death that we would have the presence of in our death did you know that we were supposed to die with the absence of [Music] God but right now Sister Grace you can never die with the absence of God it doesn't matter what takes your body because he died because he gave himself because he shed his blood his work alone took our place and he suffered the absence so that we can be in the presence and that is our judgment God struck upon him our judgment Hallelujah some many sins go before them and some other men's sins follow them you didn't get it so many sins go before [Music] them and others many sins go uh follow them now let's confess ours now so it will go before us and Christ met our judgment and God In The Garden of Aiden when he pronounced death on the human race the day you eat thereof the day you shall die every human being and death means separation that's the reason we call it death for one another we just separate from one another now what happened on the cross let me tell you what happened on the cross what happened on the cross is that our sins actually went before us you will Now understand the scripture that says they that are born of God cannot s your sins have gone before you cannot sin again it is impossible because you already judged that's why you cannot even come in the Judgment because you already judge when he was struck you were judg right there when he was crying on the cross what was that it was you crying you see you were being judged alone without God and today we cannot boast in the work he has done for us hallelujah hallelujah amen all we need today is Faith tell someone all we need today Faith all we need is faith in the finished work Romans 1116 for I am not ashamed of the Gospel the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God and to Salvation to everyone that what believe do you believe the message of the hour to all of you who believe hallelujah hallelujah for oh my God oh my God oh my God Amen it says for therein oh you didn't get brother if you get it the people will get it I'm not ashamed of what of the Gospel everybody say the gospel all right you you might as well say the message of the now you not ashamed of it for there is where in the message the the word in the gospel is the righteous of God Ral the righteousness of God is now revealed it is revealed where in the gospel in the message in the word it is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith the gospel the message is he died he was buried and he rose again he is alive and he wants to live in you he wants to come in your life and to change your nature that is the gospel the gospel is the power of the Holy Ghost of the Risen Savior coming in your soul by the way if you don't receive the Holy Spirit you can never please God why because your Works will never be enough you will be like Adam you will not please God but when you accept his work which is finished the blood which is shed and then you believe in it and then you accepting it remember life is in the blood what can wash away my sin nothing blood you can't overcome those things which you inherited from your until you accept this with all your heart but you see to accept it there is something you need to do you need to sell everything El the problem with Christians many of them are not willing to do that they're not willing to forsake things they keep things in their life you keep that little boyfriend that girlfriend in your life that habit in your life and the more you keep it in to yourself you don't surrender it you will never find his work and you will never be able to attain his rightous everything you're doing is just laws but you will not attained to the level of his righteousness so he wants you to come in the place where his life can come in your life and then his nature will brood up in you now at that moment you don't need to struggle you know I would never want to wear this I feel I want a trouser don't worry where are your trouser so we can see that you not Chang but the moment you are Chang did you know when someone changes because of laws they will go back again to their V how many have seen such always go back but if you change because your Nature has you can never go back you can never go back you get totally changed from within because of his work you can never tell a lie again and you're struggling with lies God for God this mouth I'm giving to take away all the spirit of life it will not go do one thing sell everything you have surrender your life it is so simple but we complicate it the only thing you need to do is to surrender yourself to Jesus Christ now I understand us doing it here in the church but it can never be enough get time yourself I wonder how many he have ever done it you go somewhere remember we used to do it when you first you go in a bush somewhere and you kneel down no one is seeing you kneeing it's just you and God you know you're struggling with a spirit with a demon maybe you have lost or something you want to overcome you can't overcome by saying from to down what do again you can't you can't you will keep going back again but when you tap on his work you come you surrender to him alone with him God I'm burdened I cannot overcome without you I need you fill me with the Holy Spirit and determine in yourself not to leave that place until you filled with H do you know you will be filled with the Holy Spirit do you know it is possible do you know he promise it in his word it is not a struggling thing you you will come and pray and pray and PR and kick the devil and you go back and do the same same thing until you do what I told break in his presence humble yourself in in his presence you and him alone find time surrender yourself to his finished work because you can burst in that the moment you get an experience of the Holy Spirit you can never be the same again your nature will change because when he come and is in you he is greater than all he is greater than Temptations He is greater than your failures even greater than your flesh greater than your flesh greater than your sins greater than your weaknesses he is great actually he is greater than you even you his work on the cross made this possible and in this we boast PA said I don't in any other I bust in him and that's why when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost you no longer bust on anything you can do you know for you to live it is Christ your life is his you not struggling with things but you've yielded your life to him and is leading you a new nature is born in you when you receive that new nature you never want the world again no you can never go back in those things because Christ has visited please allow me to finish with this turn to to your Bible Romans 3:21 but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon them that believe for there is no difference for all have seen and have come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus who God has sent set forth to be appropriation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness oh my God for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus it is all by faith now the people you see it's your faith it is never your feeling it is nothing whether is so if it's if it's my hand isn't straight that doesn't have one thing to do with it if you you still have a problem in your life it has nothing to do with it it is my faith that does that right before us we see the image of a perfect healed person by faith your hand may be like this but if you believe in his word you see yourself perfectly and then we just make step by step till we step right into that person and just walk right on with what does it your faith not your feelings not your feelings your faith does and I'm concluding with these few comments it is not your feelings I feel like a sinner today I feel very holy spiritual your feelings will light it's not your feelings you may feel awful but if you have faith in his [Music] word he showed you there a man that is perfect and you are here the way you are I believe God is speaking to someone and you're like I feel this way I feel awful I feel this I feel that but it say it's not your feelings it is your faith now what what are you going to do you may go and pray and it may not work the first time second time the third time don't give up you understand don't give up keep walking step by step I know I'm going to go in the rupture and I know I'm going to be perfect I'm without spot I'm the bride of Christ the devil will tell you all sorts of things what about this you are lying yourself what about but you are walking step by step you you keep moving and I was telling someone the other day don't listen to your feelings your feelings will betray you you run if you can't run walk but if you can't walk at least you crawl but keep moving in the right direction you push yourself step by step and one of these days Brothers we are going to walk into this perfect when we walk in to that other body and all the Temptations weaknesses trials fail it will all be behind us and that's why in him before we reach where we are going we can boast already and say we are perfect am We Are Holy we are the bright you understand we can Bo already before even we we reach there we can burst because it is a finished stand up on your feet now to some of you the devil has been talking to telling you how much your burden how you can't make it how the Christian journey is very difficult I tell you what that's your chance to walk step by step and keep marching forward no matter what it is if the musicians can please come praise the name of the Lord I'm bursting in his work tell your neighbor I'm bursting in his work I'm busting in his work it is a finished work it's a holy ghost building and that's why we worship by the way we praise we do everything because it is a finished work I wanted to think about those things I know I've gone a little longer than usual but I know this will stick with you because that's what I meant it to be amen if you can close our eyes for just a moment and then we close so we can go to the youth meeting hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus we cannot B in ourselves we can only Bo in your finished work the work of your cross this message of you've sent to us perfect us it is your work Lord not
