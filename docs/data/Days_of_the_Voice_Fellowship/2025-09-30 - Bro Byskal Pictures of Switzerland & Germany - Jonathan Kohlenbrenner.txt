TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] One day you're going to leave this world. And I say with the songwriter, what then? And I'm not preaching for time. I'm not preaching for this life. I'm not even here for this life. I feel very connected to another world and I feel like I'm a representative of that world. That's where God is. Heavenly Father, we've come to the closing moments of this time and we feel very connected to the eternal. You are our father. &gt;&gt; All things are uh within your hands and you just deal with us so tenderly. You show us your will. You tell us we shall fulfill it all. We shall do it, oh God. And we're so thankful you've allowed us to have this piece of eternity here in this time. And you've allowed this message to cause us to be merged with the eternal realm. Oh God, may the people see it. Father, may they go out of here walking knowing that they are eternal sons and daughters of the living God. Yes, we're here for a very short time, but we are eternal beings. We're eternal sons and daughters. Lord, when we greet one another, let it be a full understanding that comes our way in Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now. we pray to be witnesses of the eternal realm in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Just want to sing till we meet. Till we meet at Jesus feet. Okay. [Music] Till we meet. Till we at Jesus. Till we [Music] go be with you till we meet again.
