[1:08:36] how he has kept us,
[1:08:39] how he has guided us,
[1:08:42] how he has provided.
[1:08:44] Many are not alive to testify to him.
[1:08:48] But how many times did you think you
[1:08:50] reached your end,
[1:08:53] but God came through for you?
[1:08:56] So you have a reason to worship him,
[1:09:00] a reason to glorify him because indeed
[1:09:03] he's great in our life.
[1:09:05] Has he been great in your life?
[1:09:08] Well, if he has been great in your life,
[1:09:11] I want you to join me this morning.
[1:09:14] We're not just singing to, you know, be
[1:09:16] seen or be heard.
[1:09:20] You know, singing is a cry of our heart.
[1:09:24] a heart filled with gratitude
[1:09:28] for what the Lord has done for you.
[1:09:31] So I want you to loosen up yourself.

[1:10:34] to raise us up, to encourage us, to
[1:10:38] bring us into an atmosphere
[1:10:41] of where all things are possible.
[1:10:46] An atmosphere
[1:10:49] which will
[1:10:51] make us realize
[1:10:54] that our God is great
[1:10:56] and is in our midst
[1:10:58] and he never fails.

[1:19:24] But uh it was what what I can tell you
[1:19:27] even now it's like I'm still flying in
[1:19:28] in the head.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; It was quite a long long trip.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to uh show you a few
[1:19:39] pictures.
[1:19:42] Brothers, if you can dim this light
[1:19:47] so that uh people can see the pictures.
[1:19:51] Um,
[1:19:53] you know, it was a long trip
[1:19:58] and um
[1:20:00] and um you know this u I want you to
[1:20:04] pray for me this morning
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:10] I'll be in the same frequency with the
[1:20:11] Holy Spirit
[1:20:16] because to be frank I'm tired. My wife
[1:20:19] was telling me, "Is it a must for you to
[1:20:20] preach?"
[1:20:26] And uh so well to me it's a duty.
[1:20:41] And and really even the reason why we
[1:20:43] travel
[1:20:46] is why brothers travel and they come all
[1:20:49] the way thousands of kilometers
[1:20:54] and why we travel thousands of miles to
[1:20:56] where they are
[1:20:58] because of the gospel.
[1:21:01] There is no other reason.
[1:21:04] And um you know if you're called to
[1:21:06] minister,
[1:21:07] you are not called to one little place.
[1:21:11] The gift that God gave you
[1:21:14] is for the entire body of Christ.
[1:21:17] And this is all over the world.
[1:21:20] We believe that for Jesus said go
[1:21:25] only to
[1:21:27] preach the gospel.
[1:21:29] What did he say?
[1:21:32] all the world
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and and so you should be proud to have a
[1:21:37] pastor that is fulfilling that commit
[1:21:40] that command that the Lord gave you.
[1:21:45] But I want I want to tell it's just the
[1:21:47] grace of God.
[1:21:50] So um brother can you give me the next
[1:21:52] slide?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. So when I I went
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; um I arrived uh in Toronto
[1:22:03] Toronto
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; over there down there
[1:22:07] and um I I I had to take after there I
[1:22:12] had to take another flight
[1:22:17] to Vancouver which is about 5 hours.
[1:22:20] Vancouver,
[1:22:22] Toronto is like the east
[1:22:27] of Canada. So then you have travel again
[1:22:29] all the way west
[1:22:34] to Vancouver
[1:22:36] and um give me the next slide
[1:22:39] there. Brother brother Michael received
[1:22:42] me
[1:22:44] and I was happy to see him.
[1:22:47] You know, I've always received him on
[1:22:49] this side.
[1:22:52] For the first time, he received me on
[1:22:53] this side.
[1:22:56] Um, give me the next slide.
[1:22:59] Um, there's a lot of pictures and a lot
[1:23:01] of things I would have showed you,
[1:23:05] but I have a reason for everything I
[1:23:06] show you.
[1:23:09] Now, many places I've gone to,
[1:23:11] but uh, you know, this place was a bit
[1:23:15] special for me.
[1:23:17] Because whatever the Lord did in this
[1:23:19] place
[1:23:21] through the ministry by the Edis
[1:23:25] has really affected many ministries all
[1:23:28] over the world.
[1:23:32] Actually I was in Zimbabwe when we were
[1:23:34] dedicating um when we were at the
[1:23:36] dedication of uh Pastor Chikos's church
[1:23:42] in Har.
[1:23:44] shocked
[1:23:45] when I heard him as he was giving or
[1:23:48] reading out his testimony
[1:23:51] and he said that brother Eddie Biscal uh
[1:23:53] uh ordained him in the ministry
[1:23:59] and you know brother Chikosi is one of
[1:24:01] the elders I can say in Africa.
[1:24:06] So you can see that brother Edbel's
[1:24:09] ministry has had a great impact
[1:24:14] I was one of the very last to be
[1:24:16] impacted by this.
[1:24:21] Um you know this is a man that whose
[1:24:23] ministry impacted was impacted by the
[1:24:26] life and ministry of brother directly.
[1:24:32] And so you see this house.
[1:24:36] I hope brother Isaac we are also having
[1:24:38] these pictures online for us.
[1:24:43] So this house
[1:24:46] I was able to see it actually but the
[1:24:48] Michael showed it to me.
[1:24:50] Uh but it was called by they called it
[1:24:52] Bible way house
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Bible way house. It was the the place
[1:24:56] where the the church started
[1:25:00] and you know they were staying uh you
[1:25:03] know and you know they were many
[1:25:05] students were coming in
[1:25:08] and you know hearing the message. It
[1:25:10] made me feel like at DVF
[1:25:16] because we have a lot of students, young
[1:25:19] ones, they all started as young people.
[1:25:23] But of course, this is this is in the
[1:25:25] 70s
[1:25:28] and now many years later when you see
[1:25:29] what the Lord has done all over the
[1:25:30] world through the ministry there
[1:25:35] really it it shows you that Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] never fails.
[1:25:40] And when he sets out to do a work,
[1:25:43] he accomplishes it.
[1:25:45] Give me the next slide. And uh that
[1:25:48] that's brother Ed there.
[1:25:51] And you know, I've placed my picture on
[1:25:54] the side
[1:25:56] and I wanted to tell you I I felt when I
[1:26:00] was there, I felt deeply honored
[1:26:05] to finally stand on the platform
[1:26:08] of a person that I've taken as my mentor
[1:26:14] in this ministry of the
[1:26:18] um also
[1:26:21] you know As I as we were entering the
[1:26:23] building,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; you know, as I was entering, brother
[1:26:27] Michael was taking me, you know, before
[1:26:30] the service.
[1:26:33] It was a very, very emotional time for
[1:26:36] me.
[1:26:38] You know, brother Isaac and saw it
[1:26:41] later, but others who saw me earlier,
[1:26:43] you know, know that I was listening
[1:26:45] service after service after service that
[1:26:47] was preached in this place.
[1:26:53] Just give me I I have a lot to say but
[1:26:55] you know we don't have the whole day but
[1:26:57] let's go to
[1:27:01] uh this brother this uh I I thought I he
[1:27:04] asked me to greet the church
[1:27:07] and uh brother his name is brother
[1:27:09] Jonathan Jonathan
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; you know at that time he was um you know
[1:27:14] uh in school
[1:27:17] and he came and he attended my wedding.
[1:27:19] He was one of those attended my way
[1:27:22] and so I was happy to see him after all
[1:27:24] these years.
[1:27:27] He's now married with a with a child
[1:27:30] and so that is his family right there.
[1:27:34] Give me the next slide
[1:27:36] and uh sister Lisa and her family asked
[1:27:39] me to greet you as well.
[1:27:43] You know, uh, some some people are
[1:27:46] wondering how come you made, you know,
[1:27:48] the white brethren to sing a Luganda
[1:27:51] song.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; How many were able to watch to see that
[1:27:57] song?
[1:27:59] Actually, it was not me who made them
[1:28:01] sing.
[1:28:03] It was them who made me sing it.
[1:28:06] So, they they requested that if we could
[1:28:08] sing the song and you know, they watch
[1:28:10] most of our services here.
[1:28:14] So, and I was surprised that they could
[1:28:17] sing it.
[1:28:19] So, I I told, "Are you sure? ARE YOU
[1:28:20] READY?" SAY, "YEAH, YEAH." And uh it
[1:28:23] really went. Did it not go so well?
[1:28:26] That was really nice. So, that was
[1:28:28] brother Jeremiah over there
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; and and his uh wife. I think the next
[1:28:34] one there right there,
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Sister Anna Hope.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Sister Anna Hope is a daughter to Sister
[1:28:40] Liisa right there.
[1:28:44] Now, Sister Lisa is not a new name here
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; because I think in our second youth
[1:28:51] camp,
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; you remember the Bibles we distributed.
[1:28:58] She just had a burden and she wrote me
[1:29:00] and said, "Look, I have a burden to give
[1:29:01] to the young people Bibles for those who
[1:29:03] don't have Bibles.
[1:29:07] They don't have very much." But you know
[1:29:09] she struggled and and made it possible
[1:29:11] to make to to distribute all those
[1:29:14] Bibles.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And so they sent greetings to you.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide.
[1:29:24] Uh this is a brother.
[1:29:27] He's a senior brother there in the
[1:29:28] church.
[1:29:31] Um
[1:29:32] uh is originally from Nigeria.
[1:29:35] Nigeria.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; You you will remember brother Victor who
[1:29:39] Victor
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; who came and ministered. How many
[1:29:41] remember? Brother Victor.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is the father to brother
[1:29:45] Victor.
[1:29:47] Victor.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; So he's also called Victor. Brother
[1:29:49] Victor.
[1:29:51] Victor.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; So he um he was the when I was
[1:29:54] contacting brother Ed in the early
[1:29:56] years,
[1:30:00] he was the brother that brother Ed Bis
[1:30:02] asked to contact me and to find out what
[1:30:04] type of person I was.
[1:30:12] and uh I think he gave a good report.
[1:30:16] So he's a he's a nice brother and we we
[1:30:18] had some little nice fellowship and it
[1:30:20] was a wonderful time
[1:30:23] and um I'll give you the next slide
[1:30:25] there. Yeah. So that those are are the
[1:30:30] um
[1:30:32] children of brother Tom
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; you know brother Michael
[1:30:38] who has ministered for us here several
[1:30:39] times
[1:30:42] and by the way I'm of the understanding
[1:30:44] he's going to be coming to u uh I had
[1:30:47] invited him to come and preach in our
[1:30:48] youth camp
[1:30:52] and because they were coming so he
[1:30:54] wasn't too sure whether he would be able
[1:30:55] to come back so soon
[1:31:00] so um but um then things happen and
[1:31:04] there's a some projects we are working
[1:31:05] on of of translation of the audio
[1:31:08] message.
[1:31:12] So he thought and then he got another
[1:31:14] invitation from brother Steven to come
[1:31:16] and take the youth cup. I think he in
[1:31:18] campala of lifeboat.
[1:31:23] So I'm of the understanding he he might
[1:31:26] actually come for that youth camp
[1:31:31] and he we shall also have him maybe for
[1:31:32] a service or so.
[1:31:36] Um, so you don't want to miss that youth
[1:31:39] camp
[1:31:41] because one of our very own will be
[1:31:43] there and he's a very good minister.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so um I really had some
[1:31:49] wonderful wonderful fellowship
[1:31:54] with the with the family and you know
[1:31:56] brother Tom's family
[1:31:58] extended family.
[1:32:03] I wish I could but I some pictures I've
[1:32:06] withheld
[1:32:08] but I was very glad to you know meet
[1:32:10] sister Ruth also
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; you know and she told me a few words and
[1:32:16] how thought of me and things like that
[1:32:19] which meant very much to us.
[1:32:22] Uh those saints asked me to greet the
[1:32:24] church
[1:32:27] and uh so as many of you already saw we
[1:32:30] took a service there.
[1:32:33] We we took a service there
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; and uh the Lord was gracious.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; So um that was my first leg
[1:32:43] and uh give me the next slide. So from
[1:32:46] from Vancouver right here.
[1:32:49] We now had to fly back all the way to
[1:32:52] Toronto
[1:32:54] Toronto. And actually now the next phase
[1:32:56] that the pictures I'm going to show you
[1:33:00] I can tell you was the main reason of my
[1:33:04] original plans to go to Canada.
[1:33:10] Um
[1:33:12] because
[1:33:15] you give me the next slide.
[1:33:19] If you see brother Hapto there received
[1:33:21] me
[1:33:24] and for the first time someone gave me a
[1:33:25] flower
[1:33:29] and I thought he was amazing.
[1:33:31] He was so happy and there's quite a lot
[1:33:35] I can say but I want to say this
[1:33:38] invitation by brother Hapto
[1:33:42] all goes back give me the next slide to
[1:33:45] the wedding
[1:33:48] preparations of brother Giri and sister
[1:33:52] Yodit
[1:33:56] you know brother Gir sister Yodit as you
[1:33:58] know was the very first uh was the
[1:34:00] second person actually the very first
[1:34:02] woman, but the first um the the second
[1:34:05] but the very first sister to be baptized
[1:34:13] and um now through her.
[1:34:17] We started reaching out to very many
[1:34:19] people,
[1:34:22] many of the others who actually believed
[1:34:26] was because of this
[1:34:29] including
[1:34:33] her husband,
[1:34:36] brother Giri.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I remember the first time brother Giri
[1:34:40] heard of the message.
[1:34:43] You know, sister Yod introduced her to
[1:34:45] us.
[1:34:48] So she came,
[1:34:50] brother, he came to meet me and we
[1:34:51] talked and talked
[1:34:54] and then he he told me, "Where is this
[1:34:57] message that you're talking about?
[1:35:00] I told him well I have it. He said um he
[1:35:03] brought his laptop and he told me can
[1:35:05] you pack it all here?
[1:35:08] So we loaded it on the laptop
[1:35:11] and he went away for one month
[1:35:14] and he came back after one month with
[1:35:18] red eyes and he was seriously studying
[1:35:21] the message.
[1:35:23] I can tell you he's one of the brothers
[1:35:25] that really believe the message after
[1:35:27] understanding the message very well.
[1:35:32] He told me now I'm ready for baptism.
[1:35:36] And so I've never shared brother's
[1:35:38] testimony. That's
[1:35:41] so brother Gai
[1:35:43] of course had been in the trintarians
[1:35:46] the one
[1:35:48] the apostolic church.
[1:35:52] So now when he was going to get engaged
[1:35:55] with uh sister Yodi, the day they were
[1:35:57] going to get engaged,
[1:36:00] the day they were going to announce
[1:36:01] their engagement in the church.
[1:36:03] So brother Gurimai um brought some of
[1:36:06] his friends
[1:36:09] and one of them happened to be brother
[1:36:11] Habton.
[1:36:13] That's why when you are going to have a
[1:36:15] wedding
[1:36:17] or if you're going to have uh announce
[1:36:20] your engagement,
[1:36:23] invite your friends who are
[1:36:24] non-believers
[1:36:27] because that's an opportunity for them
[1:36:28] to hear the message.
[1:36:30] You don't know what God is planning
[1:36:31] after that.
[1:36:34] So he invited up brother Hapto.
[1:36:37] So, Habtom came and uh he heard what we
[1:36:40] had to say and he was impressed.
[1:36:44] So, he came and sat down with me and we
[1:36:48] talked and talked and talked and talked
[1:36:50] and he he saw the message. The hand of
[1:36:53] the Lord was revealed for him
[1:36:56] and give me the next slide
[1:36:58] and he was baptized in the name of our
[1:37:01] Lord Jesus.
[1:37:03] And uh this was on 4th November 2016.
[1:37:09] That the water you seen up there that
[1:37:12] that was really very cold.
[1:37:17] That's the coldest I've ever placed in.
[1:37:21] And so give me the next slide. You can
[1:37:23] see those some of those pictures.
[1:37:26] Uh if you see that man in the blue suit,
[1:37:33] that's brother Habtom.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And um you know this is the wedding. Now
[1:37:39] uh he was the best man.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; And if you notice he was baptized. He
[1:37:46] came he came for the how do you call the
[1:37:48] the announcing of the engagement
[1:37:51] engagement as a nonbeliever.
[1:37:55] and uh on 4th November he's baptized
[1:37:59] on 12th November
[1:38:02] he's coming back as a believer now
[1:38:06] to be the best man of the of the brother
[1:38:08] at his wedding
[1:38:11] if he want it may God also do it for
[1:38:16] I thought that was a a blessing
[1:38:19] amen and give me the next slide
[1:38:22] and on 6th December His
[1:38:26] wife was also baptized
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; by brother Paul,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; a friend of mine that had come in at
[1:38:32] that time I was in in the north doing
[1:38:41] but uh you know but she kept on coming
[1:38:44] to here and we would meet her several
[1:38:45] times
[1:38:47] then finally she accepted and believed
[1:38:50] and was baptized on 6th December 2016.
[1:38:53] December.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide. January 7th,
[1:38:57] 2017,
[1:39:01] they do their wedding.
[1:39:04] And that happened to be the second
[1:39:05] wedding in the church.
[1:39:09] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:12] Give me the next slide.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:39:17] yeah, September we recently when I was
[1:39:19] in Ethiopia, I meet with brother Habam
[1:39:21] again. Of
[1:39:25] course, he had told me that uh they they
[1:39:28] he had moved to Canada
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; and I had already connected him with
[1:39:33] pastor John there.
[1:39:37] So he was going to church
[1:39:39] but you know when I met him he told me I
[1:39:42] have this burden
[1:39:44] to reach out to my people there.
[1:39:49] Brother HTM is
[1:39:53] But he he has also lived in Ethiopia for
[1:39:56] many years
[1:39:59] and and and so it tells me I have this
[1:40:01] burden to reach the people in um in
[1:40:05] Canada
[1:40:09] and he asks me says pastor can you come
[1:40:12] and help me to to speak to some of them
[1:40:15] and so that's one of the reasons why we
[1:40:17] wanted to go
[1:40:21] give me The next slide. We met several
[1:40:23] brethren.
[1:40:25] This is one of them
[1:40:27] and I wanted to show you this so that
[1:40:29] you can pray.
[1:40:31] He's a minister of the gospel.
[1:40:34] He's called pastor Ephraim.
[1:40:37] Please remember that name in prayer.
[1:40:41] I believe that that brother will receive
[1:40:42] this message.
[1:40:45] Give me the next slide.
[1:40:47] Uh okay. That's one of the churches I uh
[1:40:50] in this place Kitchen called Kitchen is
[1:40:52] a is a the pastor there is brother
[1:40:55] Joseph
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and so they also sent their greetings.
[1:41:02] Next slide.
[1:41:05] I think brother Joseph by the way has
[1:41:07] been to Uganda.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. This is uh another now the church
[1:41:14] of pastor John in
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; in Toronto Toronto
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; and um uh we were we also visited there
[1:41:23] and ministered three services.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Give me the next slide. Uh okay. So
[1:41:30] right there I want to show you
[1:41:34] uh okay I'm trying to look at the
[1:41:36] pictures here to see who is who. So I
[1:41:38] can say now if you see the picture on
[1:41:43] the right
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; that is brother
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Habton
[1:41:50] and the pastor John
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; pastor Johnny's wife
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; brother Alan one of the associate
[1:41:56] ministers and his wife
[1:41:59] and myself but if you look to the this
[1:42:03] picture
[1:42:05] to the left
[1:42:07] brother,
[1:42:09] a brother called brother Calbal.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; This is one of the brothers that we have
[1:42:16] really spent time with
[1:42:18] quality quality time with
[1:42:22] and he came with us um you know after
[1:42:24] you know all the time we spent with him.
[1:42:25] So of course he's still in the
[1:42:27] denominations
[1:42:29] but um he came and uh by God's grace we
[1:42:32] were able to um be with him at the
[1:42:35] church.
[1:42:38] And um he wanted also his wife to come
[1:42:42] and pastor John was very very gracious.
[1:42:47] In the next service we were going to
[1:42:48] preach there
[1:42:51] uh because I was leaving in in a place
[1:42:53] called Kitchener
[1:42:56] and the church is in Toronto
[1:42:59] that's about 1 hour away.
[1:43:03] Pastor John was able to, you know, find
[1:43:05] a hotel room for them
[1:43:10] and for myself
[1:43:13] close so that we can, you know, have
[1:43:16] some time more in the word.
[1:43:19] Give me the next slide. So, uh,
[1:43:23] so that's pastor John. It
[1:43:28] is not a young man. He's preached this
[1:43:30] message for more than 50 years.
[1:43:33] He's originally from Ghana. I tell you,
[1:43:36] he's done a great work in that.
[1:43:40] And so that's his wife. And this is the
[1:43:43] brother I'm talking to you about,
[1:43:44] brother Calb. And his wife Luna, Sister
[1:43:49] Luna, uh, you know, Sister Luna was
[1:43:52] imprisoned for four years.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Sister
[1:43:56] in it
[1:43:58] because of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:01] She could have come out if she had
[1:44:03] recounted,
[1:44:07] but she did not because that's how much
[1:44:11] she loves Jesus.
[1:44:13] I felt and you know when when as I was
[1:44:15] sharing with them
[1:44:18] I felt like this is she's another
[1:44:23] oh man she she's just on you know she
[1:44:26] loves the work you go in.
[1:44:29] So her and her husband I believe they
[1:44:30] would really be a great support brother.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And so um and the good news is
[1:44:39] after all the conversations we have
[1:44:42] you know brother brother Calb made a
[1:44:45] decision to be baptized
[1:44:48] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:44:51] his wife is not yet there yet
[1:44:55] but probably brother Calb might be
[1:44:56] baptized this Sunday.
[1:45:00] When I hear the testimonies I'll share
[1:45:02] with you,
[1:45:04] I remember they're just a lovely, lovely
[1:45:06] couple.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; They've recently come into Canada as
[1:45:10] well,
[1:45:13] and so please remember them in prayer
[1:45:15] with
[1:45:17] Amen. And then we also had, give me the
[1:45:19] next slide, another uh time in another
[1:45:22] church, the last service minister
[1:45:28] Pastor Gerald who is seated right right
[1:45:30] here
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; and they also sent greetings.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Well, I think you you now at least have
[1:45:42] in your mind a little bit of brother
[1:45:44] just hold it there a moment. You have a
[1:45:45] little bit in your mind
[1:45:50] uh what um happened when I was in
[1:45:57] and thank you for praying.
[1:46:02] Um,
[1:46:04] I want to show you this next slide
[1:46:07] because it inspired what I'm going to
[1:46:10] speak this morning.
[1:46:16] Three little monkeys.
[1:46:20] So, when I was at the church in Ker
[1:46:25] uh at Pastor Jose's church.
[1:46:29] I saw these three little monkeys
[1:46:33] on his desk.
[1:46:38] And for some reason, I had never read
[1:46:40] what Brother Bam said about it.
[1:46:49] And this is what he said. I'm going to
[1:46:51] read for you.
[1:46:54] and then we shall stand and read the
[1:46:56] scripture.
[1:46:59] So give me a moment. Let me find a
[1:47:05] good little thing you ought to set
[1:47:06] around on your desk.
[1:47:10] It's a little thing I had seen down in
[1:47:12] Florida not long ago.
[1:47:16] It was three little monkeys
[1:47:21] and one of them had his hands
[1:47:24] over his eyes
[1:47:28] and said, "See no evil,
[1:47:33] and the other had one hand
[1:47:37] his fingers on his ears,
[1:47:44] said, "Hear no evil.
[1:47:47] And the other one had his fingers in his
[1:47:49] ears.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, and the other on on his
[1:48:01] mouth
[1:48:03] he said speak not.
[1:48:06] I think that's a good thing. Don't you?
[1:48:11] That's a very good thing.
[1:48:14] And I thought I should also show you
[1:48:16] where I got that inspiration.
[1:48:21] And today I will be speaking on keep
[1:48:22] your mind pure on Christ.
[1:48:30] But before we go into the reading of the
[1:48:32] word,
[1:48:34] I'd like to invite um uh it's um brother
[1:48:39] Steven told me about this um
[1:48:43] sister
[1:48:46] Olivia rather
[1:48:52] she would like to dedicate a child
[1:48:57] Is she here?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Can the musicians play for us? Bring
[1:49:02] them in.
[1:49:06] And then we shall stand and read the
[1:49:07] scripture afterwards.
[1:49:09] Bring them in.
[1:49:13] Bring them in.
[1:49:18] Bring bring them in from the field
[1:49:23] of sin.
[1:49:25] Oh, bring
[1:49:27] them in.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Bring them in.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says that all life comes
[1:49:51] from God.
[1:49:55] And so the mother is is the father of
[1:49:57] the child here?
[1:50:00] No.
[1:50:02] Okay.
[1:50:07] So we are going the child is called
[1:50:09] Christian.
[1:50:12] And so let us bow our heads and
[1:50:18] our heavenly father
[1:50:21] we have come here before your presence.
[1:50:26] Lord, we know that all life comes from
[1:50:28] you.
[1:50:30] And Lord, this couple has desired to
[1:50:32] dedicate this child
[1:50:36] because they recognize
[1:50:39] this child is not their own making.
[1:50:43] But it's a life from you,
[1:50:47] Father. We want to also receive this
[1:50:50] child on your behalf,
[1:50:52] and we want to dedicate him to you,
[1:50:54] Lord.
[1:50:56] And we want to pray that is her life
[1:51:00] will be a life of service unto Jesus
[1:51:02] Christ.
[1:51:04] The Lord you'll preserve this child
[1:51:07] from all the powers of darkness
[1:51:10] you'll keep her Lord from whatever that
[1:51:13] the enemy might want to to to do in her
[1:51:16] life.
[1:51:18] And Lord, whatever that might even have
[1:51:19] been go uh that might have gone through
[1:51:22] uh the blood of our parents in the past
[1:51:27] that has not been good. Father Lord, I
[1:51:30] pray that you will save her from all
[1:51:32] that nothing will follow her that's not
[1:51:35] of God.
[1:51:37] And Lord, I pray as I dedicate this
[1:51:39] child unto you, oh God, that you
[1:51:42] preserve this life and it will be a life
[1:51:45] of a testimony.
[1:51:47] Lord, we know that except you use a
[1:51:50] person or dear father,
[1:51:52] the enemy will always come and try to
[1:51:55] possess them. But Lord, you're
[1:51:57] possessing this child at a very young
[1:52:00] age right now. Lord, I pray that you
[1:52:03] will use her and Lord, you provide even
[1:52:06] for the parents who take care of her. I
[1:52:09] also pray Lord Jesus that you preserve
[1:52:12] her from sickness. You preserve her from
[1:52:14] everything that the the enemy might want
[1:52:16] to throw in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:52:19] Christ. Father, in the name of Jesus, we
[1:52:22] dedicate Christian unto you, Lord, for
[1:52:26] the glory of God.
[1:52:28] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] Wow.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand?
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; We have a visitor also. I'm told brother
[1:52:48] John
[1:52:52] from
[1:52:54] God bless you.
[1:52:57] Thank you for coming my brother.
[1:52:59] We are happy to have you.
[1:53:03] We are going to read from the book of
[1:53:04] Titus.
[1:53:14] I will not be very long this morning.
[1:53:20] So I just want you to stay with me and
[1:53:25] be in the same spirit
[1:53:28] as we try to see what the Holy Spirit
[1:53:30] will speak to will speak to us today.
[1:53:35] We are reading verses 15.
[1:53:40] Let us first pray.
[1:53:43] My heavenly father Lord I come before
[1:53:44] you this morning
[1:53:47] Lord just reporting to duty
[1:53:50] knowing Lord that I have nothing good in
[1:53:52] myself.
[1:53:54] I have no abilities Lord. I'm even weary
[1:53:56] in the body. But Father, I ask that you
[1:53:59] may come and have your way.
[1:54:01] May may your word go. May your words of
[1:54:03] life go through these lips
[1:54:06] and even through the brother who is
[1:54:08] going to interpret. And may everyone
[1:54:10] Lord get connected
[1:54:12] to the supernatural God who does the
[1:54:15] supernatural things. And may you bring
[1:54:17] to us the supernatural word this morning
[1:54:20] which will encourage us in our future.
[1:54:23] Father we love you. We give you praise.
[1:54:25] We give you honor in the name of Jesus
[1:54:28] Christ.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] We are reading verses 15.
[1:54:38] Unto the pure all things are pure, but
[1:54:42] unto them that are defiled and
[1:54:44] unbelieving is nothing pure. But even
[1:54:47] their mind and conscience is defiled.
[1:55:10] Amen. You may be seated.
[1:55:19] I have greetings here.
[1:55:23] Brother Ken asked me to greet you this
[1:55:25] morning.
[1:55:27] How many we are blessed by that service?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and also pastor Cece from the USA.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Actually the place where he was the
[1:55:39] place where he was in Toronto is not far
[1:55:40] away.
[1:55:44] Pastor Cis is going to be here
[1:55:48] this coming month
[1:55:50] and we will be going with him to
[1:55:52] Karamoja.
[1:55:55] they have a convention there
[1:55:58] and they ask me to to come and you know
[1:56:00] usually if I'm invited to Karamoja I
[1:56:03] always desire to take you know other
[1:56:05] ministry which I know will be a blessing
[1:56:06] there
[1:56:12] and uh so I would like you to to
[1:56:13] remember that in prayers
[1:56:16] uh so pastor sister will be here with us
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; in the month of December
[1:56:25] Um, I'll also pray for the Kamoja
[1:56:27] meetings.
[1:56:30] There's quite a lot. You know, November
[1:56:32] and December is filled with weddings,
[1:56:35] introduction ceremonies, and you know,
[1:56:38] meetings and so it's quite a lot going
[1:56:41] on.
[1:56:43] But you know, we are going to go through
[1:56:44] it today.
[1:56:46] So if someone is having a wedding or
[1:56:48] something,
[1:56:50] stand with them. You know, together we
[1:56:52] are strong.
[1:56:54] But if you are we are isolated
[1:56:56] then we cannot be strong.
[1:56:59] Pastor Tom Ray sent his greetings
[1:57:02] and brother Michael
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; and also pastor John Dana
[1:57:08] pastor Jose already told you from
[1:57:11] they sent their greetings
[1:57:14] and I just wanted to make sure I don't
[1:57:15] forget them.
[1:57:18] So are we ready for the word this
[1:57:20] morning?
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:24] Ask your neighbor, are you ready for the
[1:57:25] work?
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Unto the pure,
[1:57:39] all things are,
[1:57:44] but unto them that are defiled,
[1:57:47] and unbelieving
[1:57:49] is nothing pure.
[1:57:52] I kind of feel I might not do justice to
[1:57:54] this subject today.
[1:57:59] Uh but if that is the case then we will
[1:58:01] continue
[1:58:04] in another service. But for this service
[1:58:07] I I just want maybe to give it an
[1:58:09] introduction.
[1:58:12] Keep your mind pure on Christ.
[1:58:17] There are many there are three things
[1:58:18] three major things they talk about.
[1:58:22] your mind,
[1:58:23] purity
[1:58:25] and Christ. So I may not cover all of
[1:58:28] them. I'm trying to say, you know,
[1:58:31] someone might quickly think that we are
[1:58:32] speaking of meats,
[1:58:37] meats, meats,
[1:58:39] you know, when you talk about things
[1:58:41] that are pure and things that are
[1:58:43] defiled.
[1:58:48] But you see this scripture is very rich.
[1:58:52] It goes way beyond that
[1:58:55] and it speaks of one's mind and one's
[1:58:59] conscious.
[1:59:03] But before we get into that, let's also
[1:59:05] examine a little bit about on this issue
[1:59:07] of meat.
[1:59:12] Romans chapter 14
[1:59:14] vers 13. Let us not therefore judge one
[1:59:18] another anymore, but judge this rather,
[1:59:21] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[1:59:24] occasion to fall in his brother's way.
[1:59:40] And I would like you to follow me
[1:59:41] closely
[1:59:44] and help me to preach to you because I
[1:59:45] am weary in the body.
[1:59:48] I've been preaching service after
[1:59:50] service
[1:59:52] plus traveling and you know there's a
[1:59:54] big time difference.
[1:59:58] So that brings what maybe they called
[2:00:00] jet lag or whatever but so you feel like
[2:00:02] you're floating, you're tired, you you
[2:00:04] know you
[2:00:11] just help me to preach to you this
[2:00:12] morning.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[2:00:23] if you look in the New Testament,
[2:00:27] the Bible speaks so much or rather God
[2:00:30] has a concern
[2:00:34] about his elect,
[2:00:36] about his children, about his seed.
[2:00:40] Remember this inspiration came from
[2:00:44] see no evil,
[2:00:47] hear no evil,
[2:00:50] speak no evil.
[2:00:54] If all of us practiced it,
[2:00:57] we will be the representatives of Jesus
[2:01:00] on earth.
[2:01:03] Our conscience is means so much.
[2:01:10] And God also minds about uh your
[2:01:13] brother's conscience,
[2:01:19] your brother's mind,
[2:01:22] you know. And the Bible even goes ahead
[2:01:24] to say, "Let us therefore judge one
[2:01:26] another. Let us not judge one another
[2:01:29] anymore.
[2:01:32] But judge this rather
[2:01:34] that no man put a stumbling block or an
[2:01:38] occasion to fall in his brother's way.
[2:01:46] There there's a lot I'm going to talk
[2:01:47] about this morning.
[2:01:50] Do you know conscious
[2:01:53] is a very important thing
[2:01:56] that someone you know you may be seeing
[2:01:59] someone as an angel
[2:02:02] and someone tell you something bad about
[2:02:05] them
[2:02:09] and from that moment onwards
[2:02:12] your conscience will be defiled
[2:02:18] and your attitude You will be SPOILED
[2:02:22] and your words will be bad
[2:02:28] simply you had because you had evil.
[2:02:33] But the Bible says, "LET NO MAN put a
[2:02:37] stumbling block
[2:02:40] or AN OCCASION
[2:02:43] TO fall in his brother's way."
[2:02:47] And he says, "I KNOW
[2:02:49] AND I'M PERSUADED BY the Lord Jesus
[2:02:53] that there is nothing unclean of itself.
[2:03:01] Now here of course is going into meats
[2:03:03] as I told you, but to him that esteemth
[2:03:07] anything to be unclean.
[2:03:13] Tell your neighbor to the pure
[2:03:17] all things are pure.
[2:03:19] Hallelujah.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; SO THERE is nothing unclean
[2:03:26] but to him that it is unclean.
[2:03:34] But if you esteem something to be
[2:03:35] unclean,
[2:03:38] then to you it is unclean.
[2:03:54] I'll give you an example.
[2:03:56] Okay, here he's going to talk about
[2:03:57] meats.
[2:04:00] But even other things,
[2:04:04] for example, like a like a necklace,
[2:04:09] a a nice little simple necklace.
[2:04:14] You will find
[2:04:16] some people especially those who go the
[2:04:18] direction of legalism
[2:04:22] will tell you oh it is SATANIC
[2:04:25] but you see it's not biblical for you to
[2:04:28] say satanic
[2:04:32] it is not unclean
[2:04:34] it is not against the scripture
[2:04:38] but if you wearing it
[2:04:42] is going to stumble your brother or your
[2:04:44] sister,
[2:04:49] then you better not wear it.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; I'll come to that. I'll come to that.
[2:04:55] BUT IF YOUR BROTHER BE GRIEVED WITH THY
[2:04:57] MEAT,
[2:05:01] now thou not charitably.
[2:05:18] Torture.
[2:05:30] If your brother is is grieved,
[2:05:34] listen, interpret this. If your brother
[2:05:36] is grieved because of what you are
[2:05:38] eating,
[2:05:40] AND YOU YOU INSIST
[2:05:42] TO ME it is okay
[2:05:45] and you you eat it in his face.
[2:05:49] It means YOU DON'T HAVE LOVE.
[2:05:51] YOU ARE NOT WALKING in love.
[2:05:54] And yet the Bible instructs us to walk
[2:05:56] in love.
[2:05:58] BUT IF YOU LOVE HIM, IF YOU LOVE HER,
[2:06:02] YOU WILL NOT DO CERTAIN THINGS.
[2:06:05] YOU WILL NOT EAT CERTAIN THINGS
[2:06:08] before your brother who is weak.
[2:06:12] LET US CONTINUE. DESTROY NOT HIM WITH
[2:06:15] thy mate
[2:06:19] FOR WHOM CHRIST DIED.
[2:06:23] MEANING YOU CAN DESTROY SOMEONE
[2:06:27] BY HOW YOU BEHAVE,
[2:06:30] BY WHAT YOU DO, EVEN IF IT IS NOT EVIL.
[2:06:35] EVEN if it is not unclean,
[2:06:38] but you enjoying it and using it before
[2:06:40] them
[2:06:44] will destroy them. And yet Christ died
[2:06:47] for them.
[2:06:51] You know,
[2:06:55] we have what we call naughtiness, being
[2:06:58] not.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether that's the word,
[2:07:00] but you know, but
[2:07:06] Some parents they really treat their
[2:07:08] children in a naughty way.
[2:07:25] Don't do that. DON'T MAKE THEM. DID YOU
[2:07:27] KNOW THAT'S HOW GOD ALSO LOOKS AT HIS
[2:07:30] CHURCH?
[2:07:32] HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE GRIEVING HIS
[2:07:34] CHURCH SON OR DAUGHTER.
[2:07:37] WHY? Because you I AM THE PURCHASE OF
[2:07:40] THE BLOOD.
[2:07:44] HE WANTS US TO BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME.
[2:07:48] HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO OFFEND US.
[2:07:51] HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO LAY A
[2:07:53] STUMBLING BLOCK FOR US.
[2:07:56] SO I want TO SHOW YOU CHURCH HOW DO WE
[2:07:59] LIVE as believers
[2:08:02] as a body
[2:08:04] in unity in love. IT MEANS WE HAVE TO
[2:08:09] TAKE CARE of one another.
[2:08:14] Okay. Let not then your good be evil
[2:08:17] spoken of.
[2:08:22] For the kingdom OF GOD IS NOT MEAT AND
[2:08:24] DRINK.
[2:08:28] OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:31] HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is not meat and
[2:08:34] drink.
[2:08:36] The kingdom of God is not dos and
[2:08:38] don'ts.
[2:08:41] Are you hearing me? THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:08:43] IS not laws and rules.
[2:08:47] THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:08:49] IS RIGHTEOUSNESS,
[2:08:52] IS PEACE, AND JOY IN THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:08:56] NOW, I'm going to break it down for you
[2:08:57] later.
[2:08:59] FOR HE THAT FOR HE THAT IN these things
[2:09:03] serve Christ is acceptable TO GOD.
[2:09:08] AND approved of men.
[2:09:11] Let us therefore follow after these
[2:09:13] things which make for peace
[2:09:18] and the things wherewith one may edify
[2:09:20] another
[2:09:25] FOR IT DESTROY NOT THE WORK OF GOD.
[2:09:34] All things indeed are pure,
[2:09:38] but it is evil for that for that man who
[2:09:40] eateth with offense.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; It is good neither to eat flesh nor TO
[2:09:52] DRINK WINE, NOR ANYTHING WHEREBY THY
[2:09:55] BROTHER STUMBLE.
[2:10:05] or is offended
[2:10:08] or is made weak.
[2:10:11] That's why believers we live the way we
[2:10:13] live.
[2:10:16] That's why we dress THE WAY WE DRESS.
[2:10:19] THAT'S WHY WE EAT WHAT WE EAT. NOT
[2:10:22] BECAUSE IF WE DO WHAT WHAT THEY DO, WE
[2:10:24] WILL GO TO HELL. NO.
[2:10:28] BUT BECAUSE WE ARE AVOIDING STUMBLING
[2:10:31] ONE ANOTHER,
[2:10:34] WE WANT OUR BROTHER NOT TO BE STUMBLED.
[2:10:38] You know the ones in the world don't
[2:10:40] care what anybody thinks.
[2:10:52] Okay, you don't need to interpret that.
[2:10:55] But you see, SO THEY DO THINGS THEY
[2:10:58] DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY.
[2:11:06] SPEAK.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; You see, it means you do not have the
[2:11:09] spirit of Christ in your heart.
[2:11:13] But if you have the spirit of Christ,
[2:11:16] you you mind how your brother feels.
[2:11:20] YOU MIND HOW YOUR BROTHER THINKS ABOUT
[2:11:22] YOU.
[2:11:24] YOU YOU ARE CAREFUL,
[2:11:26] NOT to hurt them, NOT TO MAKE THEM WEAK
[2:11:30] NOT TO OFFEND THEM, NOT TO STUMBLE THEM.
[2:11:34] THAT'S HOW THE SPIRIT OF Christ is,
[2:11:36] friends.
[2:11:38] But but but now HE GOES AHEAD TO SAY,
[2:11:42] but the kingdom of God,
[2:11:45] I hope that today you'll be able to see
[2:11:47] something. The kingdom of God
[2:11:51] is not meat and drink. AND HERE HE
[2:11:53] ADDED, "OH, ANYTHING
[2:11:56] that stumbles your brother,
[2:11:59] wine or something that offends them
[2:12:03] or something that makes them weak."
[2:12:06] It doesn't have to be foods only.
[2:12:09] What What is it trying to say? Rules,
[2:12:14] regulations,
[2:12:17] dawn.
[2:12:20] And it has come to a place where many
[2:12:23] believers
[2:12:25] actually think that this message is
[2:12:27] ruled.
[2:12:30] This the message is dos and don'ts.
[2:12:34] And they know for as long as I do this
[2:12:36] and I do that,
[2:12:38] I'm going to heaven. The one who doesn't
[2:12:42] that is not going. And you find when
[2:12:44] someone comes in the church
[2:12:48] not doing what they're doing,
[2:12:52] people will be offended.
[2:12:56] They will look at him with those
[2:12:57] judgment eyes.
[2:13:00] You don't belong here.
[2:13:03] And the person will feel it.
[2:13:06] AND THE person will go away not desiring
[2:13:09] to come back again. He didn't see love
[2:13:11] in your heart.
[2:13:14] How many of you have non-believers as
[2:13:16] friends
[2:13:18] and you have even failed to invite them
[2:13:20] to church
[2:13:22] or you fear to invite them to church
[2:13:25] because you don't want them to be judged
[2:13:29] or you don't want to judge them
[2:13:32] or sometimes you can tell your friend
[2:13:35] come to my church BUT BEFORE YOU COME
[2:13:37] MAKE sure you dress this way make sure
[2:13:39] you dress that way make sure you dress
[2:13:41] this way are Are you following me? You
[2:13:44] know you are killing that person
[2:13:49] because he is not of your tribe yet.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YOUR LANGUAGE.
[2:13:56] IT IS a believer who must take care of
[2:13:58] the weaker believer. Hallelujah.
[2:14:05] But a strong believer
[2:14:07] MUST GIVE GRACE
[2:14:10] TO THE ONE WHO HAS NO REVELATION.
[2:14:15] YOU MUST GIVE GRACE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS
[2:14:18] NOT SEEN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN
[2:14:21] to someone WHO HAS NOT REACHED YOUR
[2:14:23] LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD.
[2:14:29] If she's a LADY AND SHE'S WEARING PANTS,
[2:14:34] WE CALL THEM TROUSERS,
[2:14:37] YOU KNOW. DON'T JUDGE HER.
[2:14:40] BRING INVITE HER TO CHURCH.
[2:14:42] IF SHE'S WEARING MAKEUP AND EARRINGS and
[2:14:44] everything,
[2:14:48] DON'T LOOK AT THAT.
[2:14:50] IF YOU TELL HER TO REMOVE THEM,
[2:14:54] SHE WILL REMOVE THEM. BUT IT DOESN'T
[2:14:56] MEAN SHE HAS CHANGED.
[2:14:59] SHE'S STILL THE WAY SHE WAS.
[2:15:02] WHEN SHE SHE REMOVES THEM, SOME OF THEM
[2:15:04] REMOVE them when THEY'RE COMING TO
[2:15:05] CHURCH.
[2:15:07] WHEN THEY GO BACK, THEY THEY PUT IT ON.
[2:15:10] SOME OF THEM DRESS VERY WELL WHEN THEY
[2:15:13] COMING HERE. WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOLS,
[2:15:16] THEY DRESS LIKE
[2:15:19] WHY? BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THAT
[2:15:21] GRACE
[2:15:23] AND THAT REVELATION TO UNDERSTAND THE
[2:15:26] WORD.
[2:15:28] YOU SEE, SO THE CHANGE IS COMING FROM
[2:15:30] THE OUTSIDE.
[2:15:33] BUT THE CHANGE MUST NEVER COME FROM THE
[2:15:34] OUTSIDE.
[2:15:36] THE CHANGE MUST COME FROM THE INSIDE.
[2:15:40] WHAT I'M SAYING, STOP PRETENDING.
[2:15:44] HAVE A PURE MIND.
[2:15:46] HAVE A PURE HEART.
[2:15:49] GOD WILL BE PLEASED.
[2:15:51] WHEN YOU COME BEFORE HIM PURE,
[2:15:55] THE BIBLE SAYS TO THE PURE ALL THINGS
[2:15:56] ARE PURE.
[2:15:59] AMEN. LET HER DRESS UP PURELY.
[2:16:07] BUT WHEN SHE HEARS the word,
[2:16:10] oh, are you following me, Brother Ivan?
[2:16:12] WHEN SHE HEARS THE WORD,
[2:16:16] YOU KNOW what the word does? The word
[2:16:19] convicts.
[2:16:22] The word touches.
[2:16:27] How many of you can say I've ever been
[2:16:28] convicted by the word? You see what I'm
[2:16:31] saying? The word when you hear the word,
[2:16:35] YOU WILL TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM IT.
[2:16:37] YOU WILL TRY TO REASON WITH IT. YOU WILL
[2:16:40] TRY ALL THINGS. BUT IF YOU A SIN OF GOD,
[2:16:43] YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY FROM THE WORD.
[2:16:46] ONE OF THE DAYS, THE WORD WILL GRIP YOU.
[2:16:50] THE WORLD WILL ARREST YOU AND YOU WILL
[2:16:52] HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN. BUT YOU SAY, "LORD,
[2:16:55] I'M SORRY.
[2:16:57] I AM READY TO CHANGE. I'M READY TO DO
[2:17:00] YOUR WILL.
[2:17:02] LET ME TELL YOU, I I LOVE A CHURCH
[2:17:06] THAT IS OF A PEOPLE WITH A PURE MIND.
[2:17:11] If you don't have a pure mind,
[2:17:14] you cannot serve your brothers. You
[2:17:16] cannot serve your sisters. who cannot
[2:17:18] serve God.
[2:17:22] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:17:25] Let not then your good be evil spoken
[2:17:28] of.
[2:17:31] FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:17:34] IS not meat and drink.
[2:17:38] THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NOT rules
[2:17:42] of don't EAT THIS, DON'T DRINK THAT,
[2:17:45] DON'T DO THIS, DON'T DO THAT. BUT WHAT'S
[2:17:47] THE KINGDOM OF GOD? THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:17:50] is righteousness.
[2:17:53] Everybody say righteousness.
[2:17:56] Now, WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS?
[2:17:59] That's a good one. You would think that
[2:18:01] righteousness
[2:18:04] is actually um you know doing good
[2:18:07] things.
[2:18:11] But what does the Bible say? THAT YOUR
[2:18:13] WORKS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
[2:18:16] ARE WHAT?
[2:18:18] Filthy rags before God.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; I don't eat pork.
[2:18:30] I don't eat what? Which other things
[2:18:32] don't they eat?
[2:18:36] I don't eat.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; I don't drink alcohol.
[2:18:43] me. I don't put on short clothes. I
[2:18:45] don't do this. I don't do that. I don't
[2:18:48] do this.
[2:18:50] I am
[2:18:54] me.
[2:18:55] I am not like them.
[2:18:58] That is legalism.
[2:19:02] You are under the spirit of legalism.
[2:19:06] You've not found the righteousness of
[2:19:07] God,
[2:19:10] but you have your own righteousness
[2:19:14] and you are actually selfrighteous.
[2:19:18] What am I trying to say? Because you
[2:19:20] look at them and you compare yourself
[2:19:23] with them and you say they are they have
[2:19:26] not reached my level.
[2:19:28] Look at them. see how they address
[2:19:34] and they calling themselves believers.
[2:19:36] Which heaven are they going to? Those
[2:19:39] ones are chicken. For me, I'm the ego.
[2:19:42] It is self-righteousness
[2:19:45] and IT IS A SIN.
[2:19:48] If if you it means you you are not pure.
[2:19:50] Some
[2:19:53] of these people are doing these things
[2:19:54] when they are pure.
[2:19:57] They don't know. Their mind is not yet
[2:19:59] clean.
[2:20:02] But you see, just let them come under
[2:20:04] the word.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; You know, when they receive the word,
[2:20:08] they'll receive another mind. THE MIND
[2:20:11] OF CHRIST WHICH WILL GIVE THEM ANOTHER
[2:20:14] PURITY.
[2:20:16] AMEN. AND WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS
[2:20:18] RIGHTEOUSNESS,
[2:20:20] HOW DO YOU RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS?
[2:20:22] YOU DON'T RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS
[2:20:25] BY DOING ANYTHING.
[2:20:28] YOU RECEIVE Oh my. Are you FOLLOWING ME?
[2:20:30] YOU RECEIVE THIS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[2:20:33] AMEN. BY BELIEVING THE WORD.
[2:20:36] THE BIBLE SAYS ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD AND
[2:20:40] IT WAS COUNTED UNTO HIM
[2:20:44] FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[2:20:47] SO WHAT DID ABRAHAM DO TO BE COUNTED AS
[2:20:50] A RIGHTEOUS MAN?
[2:20:52] HE BELIEVED GOD. HE BELIEVED THE WORD.
[2:20:56] GOD IS THE WORD.
[2:20:58] WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD and you BELIEVE
[2:21:01] THE WORD, THEN GOD WILL SAY, "YOU ARE
[2:21:04] RIGHTEOUS."
[2:21:06] HALLELUJAH. You are righteous.
[2:21:09] Amen. THIS IS THE KIND THAT COMETH NOT
[2:21:12] BY YOUR WORKS,
[2:21:15] BUT BY FAITH IN A FINISHED WORK OF
[2:21:19] CHRIST.
[2:21:20] YOU SEE, FAITH IN THE FINISHED WORK OF
[2:21:23] CHRIST
[2:21:26] produces the works.
[2:21:32] Now, Abraham did not go and say
[2:21:37] you see I'm better than all others.
[2:21:41] I'm even sacrificing my boy.
[2:21:44] Who has ever DONE THAT?
[2:21:47] WHO IN THE WORLD HAS EVER DONE THAT?
[2:21:49] I AM BETTER THAN ALL OF THEM.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; NO, that's not the attitude.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; What was What did Abraham do?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Abraham only heard the word. THE WORD
[2:22:01] SAID, ABRAHAM, GO AND SACRIFICE YOUR SON
[2:22:04] TO HIM.
[2:22:06] Go and sacrifice yourself. All right, my
[2:22:09] Lord. No questioning, no doubting. HIS
[2:22:13] HEART WAS FIXED
[2:22:15] ON HEARING, BELIEVING AND DOING THE
[2:22:18] WORK.
[2:22:21] AMEN. Praise God. So if you A BELIEVER
[2:22:24] LIKE THAT,
[2:22:26] YOU WILL HAVE simple faith,
[2:22:29] you read in the scriptures WHERE IT SAYS
[2:22:32] AND YOU know we have always talked about
[2:22:34] it
[2:22:36] but let us read it
[2:22:40] in the Old Testament.
[2:22:44] is I think I've never read it for you
[2:22:46] here. Right.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Theonomy
[2:22:52] 22.
[2:23:06] I want you to see something perhaps in a
[2:23:08] different way than you have ever seen
[2:23:10] it.
[2:23:15] The woman shall not wear that which
[2:23:16] pertainth unto a man.
[2:23:20] Neither shall a man put on a woman's
[2:23:22] garment.
[2:23:24] For all that do so
[2:23:27] abomination
[2:23:30] what
[2:23:34] others are not accepting.
[2:23:37] A WHAT?
[2:23:39] Unto who?
[2:23:41] unto the Lord thy God.
[2:23:43] So now you are not going to debate with
[2:23:45] THE WORD.
[2:23:47] ACCORDING to God, there are women
[2:23:49] clothes
[2:23:51] and there are men's clothes. Is that a
[2:23:54] man? So now you as a child of God who
[2:23:57] has the Holy Ghost. YOU ARE GOING TO
[2:23:59] HAVE ONE QUESTION in your heart.
[2:24:02] You're going to have one question in
[2:24:03] your heart.
[2:24:08] You're going to have one question in
[2:24:09] your heart.
[2:24:12] What is a man's cloth? What is a woman's
[2:24:14] clothes?
[2:24:17] Lord, what is YOUR WILL FOR ME?
[2:24:21] WHAT you know, a a child of God that is
[2:24:23] filled with the SPIRIT
[2:24:26] desires to please God.
[2:24:30] But the BIBLE SAYS WITHOUT WHAT? FAITH.
[2:24:34] You can never PLEASE GOD. SO FAITH, WHAT
[2:24:37] IS FAITH?
[2:24:39] FAITH IS A SUBSTANCE OF THINGS hoped
[2:24:41] for,
[2:24:44] an evidence of things NOT SEEN.
[2:24:47] BUT THEN BROTHER BHAM COMES AND HE TELLS
[2:24:50] US FAITH IS A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF
[2:24:52] GOD.
[2:24:56] SO NOW WHAT IF YOU HAVE THE REVELATION
[2:25:00] OF THE WILL OF GOD THEN YOU WILL DO IT
[2:25:02] without question.
[2:25:06] So you know, oh there's a woman's
[2:25:08] CLOTHES OR THERE'S A MAN'S cloth
[2:25:11] and then you read in the in the New
[2:25:13] Testament
[2:25:15] and you see the Bible saying uh first
[2:25:19] Timothy 2:9
[2:25:22] in like manner also that women adorn
[2:25:24] themselves in modest apparel with
[2:25:26] shamefacedness and so not with hair or
[2:25:28] god of ps or costly array.
[2:25:39] Read, read, read, read. Because that is
[2:25:41] a very good interpretation, but you have
[2:25:42] to make sure it is perfect.
[2:25:45] Amen. 1 Timothy 2:9.
[2:26:00] Praise God.
[2:26:03] Oh my. Are you sober? Ask your neighbor,
[2:26:05] are you sober?
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, let us learn something here.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with sound, come
[2:26:16] close.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; You'll feel it. You'll hear it. Now,
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; let us learn something here.
[2:26:24] I want our church. this little assembly
[2:26:27] here
[2:26:30] to know the message not as a law
[2:26:35] but to have the right approach to it.
[2:26:41] You see here now when Paul comes
[2:26:44] of course this is under grace
[2:26:47] he doesn't even bring thou shalt not
[2:26:52] but then what he says that in like
[2:26:54] manner also that women
[2:26:57] Let them adorn themselves
[2:26:59] in modest upper.
[2:27:02] Now, now tell me which one is modest and
[2:27:05] which one is not.
[2:27:10] Do you know
[2:27:12] which one is not modest?
[2:27:16] Who makes the judgment?
[2:27:24] And that's the problem
[2:27:28] that many times you make the judgment.
[2:27:34] But you cannot make a judgment
[2:27:38] for the law of God.
[2:27:41] The law of God is perfect
[2:27:44] and you don't need to add your mind.
[2:27:47] So what you need is faith
[2:27:51] to fulfill it.
[2:27:53] Faith is a revelation
[2:27:56] from God. God will REVEAL TO YOU HOW by
[2:28:01] his spirit.
[2:28:03] THAT'S WHY it is a must for each of us
[2:28:05] to be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
[2:28:09] Then the the works that we do
[2:28:13] will be coming out of the revelation by
[2:28:15] the spirit.
[2:28:18] So then you can know the MODEST APPAREL.
[2:28:23] HE SAYS NOT with braided hair or gold or
[2:28:25] pearls or costly array.
[2:28:29] So then someone said oh the Bible says
[2:28:31] they should not braid hair
[2:28:34] but then also says that you should not
[2:28:35] have costly arly clothes.
[2:28:40] So which which one is expensive and
[2:28:41] which one is not?
[2:28:44] Are we going to have deacons
[2:28:46] that will always be on the door
[2:28:49] when a SISTER COMES IN?
[2:28:52] AH SISTER, how much is this one?
[2:28:54] Are you sure you have you are not buying
[2:28:58] you? You can go you. But you
[2:29:03] the way I'm seeing isn't this 5 million.
[2:29:09] So how are you going to judge those
[2:29:10] things?
[2:29:12] But to a TO A MIND
[2:29:15] THAT DOES NOT ALL THAT IS NOT PURE
[2:29:19] IS NOT LED BY THE HOLY GHOST. THEY WILL
[2:29:22] PUT A LAW.
[2:29:26] ALL SISTERS HAIR MUST LOOK like this.
[2:29:31] All of THEM SHOULD DRESS CLOTHES like
[2:29:33] this.
[2:29:36] They should be this long.
[2:29:40] THEY MUST BE. SO BECAUSE YOU SEE THEY DO
[2:29:42] NOT HAVE THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST.
[2:29:45] THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST IS THE ONE THAT
[2:29:47] MUST GUIDE YOU AND TEACH YOU AND REMIND
[2:29:50] YOU THE LAWS OF GOD
[2:29:55] BECAUSE THE LAWS OF GOD ARE RIGHTEOUS
[2:29:57] AND ARE PERFECT.
[2:30:00] BUT IN OURSELVES
[2:30:02] WE CANNOT ATTAIN THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[2:30:07] SO THEN WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO? WE NEED
[2:30:10] TO HAVE FAITH IN GOD.
[2:30:12] BUT FAITH COMES BY REVELATION.
[2:30:16] As you hear the word, then revelation
[2:30:19] strikes you. And you know, you cannot
[2:30:22] even understand it unless you born
[2:30:24] again.
[2:30:27] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[2:30:30] unto him for righteousness.
[2:30:33] Praise God. You know if someone is
[2:30:36] filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:30:38] and one is not you tell him a sister
[2:30:42] today you're really dressing a very
[2:30:43] short dress
[2:30:45] and a sister who is not food with all of
[2:30:47] us will tell you ah
[2:30:51] it is okay
[2:30:54] I don't see a problem
[2:30:57] and then you if you don't have a pure
[2:31:01] mind
[2:31:02] then you'll begin talking about her
[2:31:07] Did you see how she was raised? Did you
[2:31:09] see how he was? And then people's minds
[2:31:14] is no longer on Christ,
[2:31:18] but it becomes, you know, defiled.
[2:31:23] It's all about what to eat, what do
[2:31:28] But you see, Abraham simply believed
[2:31:30] God.
[2:31:32] And God said, "You are righteous.
[2:31:34] When it came to sacrificing his son, it
[2:31:37] was not a problem because Abraham was A
[2:31:40] BELIEVER. WHATEVER GOD SAID, HE WAS
[2:31:43] WILLING TO DO. AMEN. And that kind of um
[2:31:47] uh faith produces works.
[2:31:51] He says the kingdom of God is
[2:31:52] righteousness
[2:31:54] and peace. He says, "Peace I leave with
[2:31:58] you. My peace I GIVE UNTO YOU.
[2:32:02] NOT AS THE WORLD GIVES,
[2:32:06] but let not your HEART BE TROUBLED.
[2:32:09] Neither let LET IT BE AFRAID.
[2:32:13] SO IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU ARE IN
[2:32:15] CHRIST, YOU ARE ALWAYS AT PEACE.
[2:32:19] AMEN. YOU ARE NOT SEEKING FOR PEACE.
[2:32:22] PEACE IS A PART OF YOUR LIFE.
[2:32:25] SISTER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY
[2:32:27] SPIRIT,
[2:32:28] YOU ARE MISSING A LOT. BECAUSE IF YOU
[2:32:32] RECEIVE THE SPIRIT, THEN YOU WILL ALWAYS
[2:32:34] BE AT PEACE.
[2:32:37] AND THE PEACE OF GOD WHICH PASSES ALL
[2:32:41] UNDERSTANDING
[2:32:43] SHALL KEEP YOUR HEART
[2:32:46] AND KEEP YOUR MIND
[2:32:49] THROUGH Christ Jesus.
[2:32:52] THIS PEACE PASSES ALL UNDERSTAND.
[2:32:56] Praise God.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, even when you ARE IN
[2:33:00] DEEP TROUBLE,
[2:33:02] EVEN WHEN YOU ARE GOING THROUGH
[2:33:03] SOMETHING HARD AND TERRIBLE,
[2:33:06] THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A
[2:33:08] CERTAIN PEACE.
[2:33:11] You know why? BECAUSE A BELIEVER MUST
[2:33:14] ALWAYS BE AT PEACE,
[2:33:17] BROTHER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEACE IN YOUR
[2:33:20] HEART, YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:33:24] NO MATTER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN YOUR
[2:33:26] LIFE,
[2:33:27] YOU MUST ALWAYS BE AT PEACE.
[2:33:30] LET YOUR HEART NOT BE TROUBLED.
[2:33:34] AMEN. FOR THE PEACE THAT PASSES ALL
[2:33:36] UNDERSTANDING
[2:33:39] SHALL ALWAYS KEEP YOUR HEART. AMEN. AND
[2:33:42] MIND
[2:33:44] THAT the key mind
[2:33:47] through Christ Jesus
[2:33:50] we are coming back to this. I'm just
[2:33:51] giving you foundation here now. joy and
[2:33:53] he says also the kingdom of God is joy
[2:33:54] IN THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:33:57] YOU SEE THIS IS THE KIND OF JOY THAT
[2:33:59] DOES NOT go away
[2:34:02] even in the midst of sufferings
[2:34:06] in the midst of trials
[2:34:08] and much tribulations
[2:34:10] after Paul and Barnabas WERE REJECTED.
[2:34:14] The scripture in Acts 13:52,
[2:34:18] you know, it says that the disciples
[2:34:19] were filled
[2:34:21] WITH JOY
[2:34:24] AND WITH THE Holy Ghost. THEY REJECTED
[2:34:28] BUT ARE FILLED WITH JOY. OF COURSE, WHEN
[2:34:30] THEY REJECTED THEM, they they they dust
[2:34:33] off their
[2:34:36] dust on their feet. To them, IT WAS A
[2:34:38] CURSE.
[2:34:40] BUT THE believers did not go away sad.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; No one is believing our message.
[2:34:47] They were FILLED WITH JOY.
[2:34:50] AMEN. AND WITH THE HOLY GHOST, LET ME
[2:34:53] TELL YOU, BROTHER, EVEN WHEN YOU ARE
[2:34:54] REJECTED,
[2:34:56] EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL YOU NOT RECEIVED
[2:34:58] THAT, PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE
[2:34:59] YOU.
[2:35:01] AMEN. AMEN. EVEN WHEN YOU FEEL THINGS
[2:35:03] ARE NOT WORKING OUT FOR YOU.
[2:35:07] AMEN. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE THIS JOY.
[2:35:10] YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
[2:35:12] BECAUSE HE WILL KEEP YOUR SOUL ON FIRE.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SONG WHICH SAYS,
[2:35:19] "THIS JOY THAT I HAVE, THE DEVIL NEVER
[2:35:22] GAVE IT TO ME. THIS JOY THAT I HAVE, THE
[2:35:25] DEVIL NEVER GAVE IT TO ME AND THE DEVIL
[2:35:27] CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY."
[2:35:30] COME ON CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY
[2:35:32] WHENEVER WE COME HERE AND WE ARE
[2:35:34] PREACHING THE WORD OR WE ARE SINGING OR
[2:35:36] WE ARE IN CHURCH, WE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY.
[2:35:40] AND THERE IS ANOTHER SONG WHICH SAYS,
[2:35:42] "OH, WHEN I GET HAPPY, I SING AND I
[2:35:44] SHOUT. THE DEVIL DOESN'T BELIEVE IT. I
[2:35:47] SING. WHY? I'M FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[2:35:50] GHOST. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AND
[2:35:53] THAT IS WHAT THE MATTER WITH ME. THIS IS
[2:35:56] LIKE HEAVEN TO ME.
[2:35:58] I'VE CROSSED FROM JORDAN TO CAN LAND.
[2:36:02] LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE
[2:36:04] WORD AND GOD FILLED YOU WITH THE HOLY
[2:36:07] GHOST, YOU ARE ALWAYS HAPPY.
[2:36:11] YOU YOU ALWAYS HAVE JOY.
[2:36:13] BY THE WAY, JOY IS DIFFERENT FROM
[2:36:15] HAPPINESS.
[2:36:19] Oh my God. You may not be happy.
[2:36:22] YOU MAY BE SAD, BUT YOU HAVE THIS JOY IN
[2:36:25] YOUR HEART.
[2:36:28] OH MY MY MY MY
[2:36:31] MAY GOD REVEAL IT TO YOU.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:36:36] AMEN.
[2:36:42] AMEN. YOU KNOW, HAVE YOU EVER FELT IT
[2:36:46] WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL? WHEN YOU
[2:36:48] ARE CONFUSED, WHEN YOU HAVE LOSSES, WHEN
[2:36:51] YOU HAVE REJECTIONS, WHEN YOU HAVE
[2:36:53] SADNESS, BUT SOMEHOW YOU HAVE A JOY YOU
[2:36:57] CAN'T UNDERSTAND.
[2:36:59] WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? IT DOESN'T COME
[2:37:02] FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. IT DOESN'T
[2:37:04] COME FROM MONEY. IT DOESN'T COME FROM
[2:37:06] FRIENDS. IT DOESN'T COME FROM ANYTHING.
[2:37:09] IT COMES FROM CHRIST.
[2:37:11] HALLELUJAH. THAT JOY WE HAVE RECEIVED
[2:37:15] WHEN WE RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:37:18] SO I TELL YOU BROTHER, SISTER, YOU
[2:37:20] SHOULD ALWAYS BE JOYFUL.
[2:37:23] NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH,
[2:37:25] WHEN YOU HAVE LITTLE SALARY, BE JOYFUL.
[2:37:29] WHEN YOU HAVE NO JOB, BE
[2:37:36] SINGING, DON'T SING AS IF YOU WANT A
[2:37:39] FUNERAL.
[2:37:41] THIS IS NOT A FUNERAL.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is A LABOR WORD.
[2:37:47] WHERE THERE SHOULD BE CRIES AND SHOUTING
[2:37:49] AND JOY.
[2:37:51] DID YOU realize the devil had all
[2:37:57] but silence?
[2:38:08] YOU GET THE POINT?
[2:38:10] IN THE LABOR WORLD, YOU WILL HAVE JOY.
[2:38:14] YOU WILL HAVE SHOUTING. YOU WILL HAVE
[2:38:15] GROANINGS. YOU WOULD HAVE CRYING. YOU
[2:38:18] WOULD HAVE ALL THE THINGS AND CLAPPING
[2:38:20] THE HANDS AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW STOMPING
[2:38:22] THE FEET AND
[2:38:24] AND ALL THE CONFUSIONS AND FALLING DOWN
[2:38:27] AND YOU KNOW BUT SILENCE HAS NO PLACE
[2:38:31] THERE.
[2:38:34] SILENCE IS IN ANOTHER PART OF THE
[2:38:36] HOSPITAL.
[2:38:38] SILENCE IS ALWAYS IN A MURERY.
[2:38:45] WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIFE.
[2:38:49] AMEN. EVEN THEY TELL YOU THEY PUT A POST
[2:38:52] WHATEVER IT IS. PLEASE RESPECT THAT DAY.
[2:38:58] SO EVERYBODY THAT WALKS IN THERE,
[2:39:02] YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR A NEEDLE FALLING.
[2:39:06] WHY? THERE IS DEAD SILENCE.
[2:39:10] IT MEANS THERE'S NO LIGHT.
[2:39:13] BROTHER, WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WRONG OR
[2:39:15] BAD OR WHATEVER, BEGIN SINGING.
[2:39:18] DON'T BE SILENT. THAT'S WHY I LOVE THAT
[2:39:21] SONG. I WILL NOT BE SILENT. I WILL
[2:39:24] ALWAYS WORSHIP YOU. IN GOOD TIMES, I
[2:39:28] WILL WORSHIP YOU. IN BAD TIMES, I WILL
[2:39:30] WORSHIP YOU. WHEN I'M HAPPY, I WILL
[2:39:33] WORSHIP YOU. SOMETIMES I WILL SING
[2:39:36] SONGS. AMEN. THAT WILL MAKE ME WORSHIP
[2:39:39] HIM. OTHER TIMES I WILL SING SONGS THAT
[2:39:42] WILL MAKE ME JUMP AND DANCE.
[2:39:45] BUT I WILL SING.
[2:39:48] Sometimes I WILL SING A GROANING SONG.
[2:39:51] SOMETIMES I WOULD SING A BABLING SONG.
[2:39:55] SOMETIMES I WILL SING. YOU YOU DEPENDS
[2:39:58] ON THE SITUATION I AM IN. IT DEPENDS HOW
[2:40:00] I'M FEELING. WHEN I HEAR OF A TESTIMONY
[2:40:04] OF A MIRACLE, I WILL SING GLORY, GLORY,
[2:40:07] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. WHEN I HEAR OF A
[2:40:09] TEST OF A BAD TESTIMONY OF A LOSS, I
[2:40:13] WILL SAY MUST JESUS BEAR DISGRACE ALONE.
[2:40:18] BUT I WILL SING THERE. NEVER BE SILENT.
[2:40:21] BROTHER
[2:40:23] EVEN WHEN YOU THINK THE DEVIL HAS GOT
[2:40:24] YOU SOMEWHERE
[2:40:27] brother sing.
[2:40:30] YOU KNOW WE HAVE SONGS FOR EVERY
[2:40:32] SITUATION.
[2:40:38] HALLELUJAH.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SONG FOR YOUR
[2:40:42] SITUATION,
[2:40:44] MAKE ONE
[2:40:48] BECAUSE ALL THE SONGS WE SING,
[2:40:50] THERE WAS SOMEONE IN A SITUATION
[2:40:54] AND THEY CAME OUT OF THE B AND BEGAN
[2:40:56] SINGING A SONG.
[2:40:58] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; I MUST TELL JESUS. I MUST TELL JESUS. I
[2:41:04] CANNOT BEAR MY TROULES ALONE.
[2:41:08] IN MY DISTRESS, he will kindly help me.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, if you're in distress, sing
[2:41:16] that one.
[2:41:21] BUT AGAIN, SOMETHING GETS TO HAPPEN TO
[2:41:23] YOU. WELL, I HAVE JOY
[2:41:28] JOY JOY.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAS DONE
[2:41:32] SOMETHING FOR ME. HE HAS DONE SO MUCH
[2:41:34] FOR ME. AND I CANNOT TELL YOU, YOU KNOW,
[2:41:38] YOU CAN'T SING THAT WHEN YOU ARE SAD.
[2:41:44] BUT WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY AND A MESSAGE
[2:41:47] COMES through
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; and you know they have given you
[2:41:53] your prayer request
[2:41:58] maybe an upgrade or maybe something is
[2:42:01] approved or maybe you had a testimony
[2:42:04] sister saying she got a job she always
[2:42:06] dreamt for
[2:42:09] you know I don't think sister Shamina
[2:42:11] Shina
[2:42:13] is now singing
[2:42:16] You must tell Jesus.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.
[2:42:22] I I I THINK SHE HAS A NEW SONG.
[2:42:25] WHICH SONG DO YOU THINK she's singing?
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; OH YES.
[2:42:32] VICTORY IS MINE. VICTORY IS MINE. WHY?
[2:42:37] YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SING THAT SONG WHEN
[2:42:38] YOU ARE SAD.
[2:42:40] Imagine victory is mine.
[2:42:43] Victory is mine.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; No, someone say, "What's wrong with
[2:42:47] you?"
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; But you know, SHE'S SING A SONG BUBBLING
[2:42:53] WITH SO MUCH JOY
[2:42:55] BECAUSE OF WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE. HE
[2:42:58] HAS DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. I CANNOT TELL
[2:43:01] IT ALL. I cannot TELL IT ALL. I CANNOT
[2:43:04] TELL IT ALL. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU SING A
[2:43:07] SAD SONG,
[2:43:09] YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE PUTTING THE
[2:43:10] DEVIL ON NOTICE.
[2:43:13] SATAN, I'M COMING SOON.
[2:43:15] I'M COMING FOR YOU. I'M COMING TO GET
[2:43:18] YOU AFTER I'M DONE WITH HIS SONG. THE
[2:43:22] BIBLE SAYS HE GIVES ME A NEW SONG.
[2:43:26] I HAVE A NEW SONG TO SING. I CAN ONLY
[2:43:29] ALWAYS SING THIS ONE SONG. GOD ALWAYS
[2:43:32] GIVES YOU A NEW SONG.
[2:43:35] BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THAT'S WHY WE NEED
[2:43:37] TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
[2:43:40] BECAUSE IF you you're filled with joy
[2:43:44] and the Holy Ghost, you cannot accept
[2:43:46] the devil to cast you down.
[2:43:52] PRAISE GOD.
[2:43:54] SO NOW 1 TIMOTHY 4, THE BIBLE SAYS um um
[2:43:59] vers one, now the spirit speaketh
[2:44:01] expressly
[2:44:04] that in the latter days shall some shall
[2:44:06] depart from the faith,
[2:44:09] giving heed to seducing spirits and
[2:44:11] doctrine of devils,
[2:44:14] speaking lies in hypocrisy,
[2:44:17] HAVING THEIR CONSCIENCE THEIR CONSCIENCE
[2:44:19] SEE IT with a hot iron.
[2:44:23] forbidding to marry.
[2:44:26] Amen. Brother Julius,
[2:44:29] they're telling you to be a priest.
[2:44:32] WHO SHOULD NOT MARRY?
[2:44:34] WHAT WOULD sister faith have done?
[2:44:38] You can imagine
[2:44:42] and commanding TO ABSTAIN
[2:44:45] FROM MEATS.
[2:44:47] DON'T EAT PORK. Don't eat this. After
[2:44:50] this service, if there is something you
[2:44:52] don't eat because when you eat, you get
[2:44:53] sick. I'm going to set you free.
[2:44:57] Go and eat it.
[2:45:03] GOD HAS CREATED IT TO BE RECEIVED
[2:45:07] WITH THANKSGIVING OF THEM
[2:45:10] WHICH BELIEVE,
[2:45:13] NOT TO EVERYBODY, TO THEM WHICH BELIEVE.
[2:45:19] AND KNOW THE TRUTH.
[2:45:25] FOR EVERY CREATURE OF GOD IS GOOD
[2:45:30] and nothing to BE REFUSED.
[2:45:33] AMEN. AMEN. FOR IF IT BE RECEIVED WITH
[2:45:36] THANKSGIVING
[2:45:39] FOR IT IS SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD OF GOD
[2:45:41] and prayer.
[2:45:45] Because remember, you know, it's all
[2:45:47] about the mind.
[2:45:50] If your mind is not pure,
[2:45:53] you will think something is evil,
[2:45:55] SOMETHING IS HOLY.
[2:45:57] THERE'S NOTHING EVIL AND THERE'S NOTHING
[2:45:58] HOLY.
[2:46:00] IT'S ONLY A HOLY GOD.
[2:46:03] AND IF THAT HOLY GOD IS IN YOUR HEART,
[2:46:06] HE WILL ALWAYS LEAD YOU TO ALL TRUTH.
[2:46:10] DO YOU KNOW EVEN WHEN YOU GO TO THE
[2:46:11] MARKET
[2:46:13] HE WILL TELL YOU DON'T BUY THIS CLOTHES
[2:46:16] but what do you do you send a picture
[2:46:20] send to YOUR FRIEND WHAT DO YOU THINK
[2:46:22] ABOUT THIS DRESS
[2:46:25] it's good you buy
[2:46:29] you are led by man and by feelings and
[2:46:33] by your mind
[2:46:36] it's not the MIND OF CHRIST LET US LEARN
[2:46:39] TO ASK THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:46:42] Imagine you brother buying a a a VERY
[2:46:45] BIG JUMP OR JACKET OR SHIRT
[2:46:49] that has blasphemous word to IT
[2:46:55] or blasphemous images.
[2:46:58] When you read it, you automatically feel
[2:47:01] the chills of the devil over YOU
[2:47:06] and you go and buy it. YOU ARE NOT LED
[2:47:08] BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:47:10] YOU MUST BE LED BY THE HOLY Ghost
[2:47:14] on all these things.
[2:47:17] You see, YOUR MIND MUST BE CENTERED on
[2:47:21] Christ.
[2:47:25] NOT ON PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE,
[2:47:30] PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE ON PEOPLE.
[2:47:34] WE you you should always come as an
[2:47:36] individual to God.
[2:47:40] The Bible SAYS WHEN YOU COME TO GOD,
[2:47:43] YOU MUST BELIEVE THAT HE IS AND HE IS A
[2:47:46] REWARDER
[2:47:48] OF THEM THAT DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM.
[2:47:52] HOW ARE YOU SEEKING HIM?
[2:47:54] YOU KNOW LIKE DAVID SANG YOU SEE AS A AS
[2:47:56] A DEER PANTTH AFTER THE WATERS
[2:48:00] SO DOES MY SOUL LONG AFTER
[2:48:04] YOU KNOW HE WAS LONGING FOR WATER.
[2:48:07] HE WAS LONGING FOR THE HOLY GHOST. HE
[2:48:10] WAS LONGING FOR HIS LEADERSHIP.
[2:48:13] YOUR MIND MUST BE CENTERED ON HIM AND
[2:48:15] HIM ALONE.
[2:48:20] DON'T LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER. DON'T LOOK
[2:48:22] AT YOUR SISTER.
[2:48:24] MAYBE THEY ARE WEAK. MAYBE THEY'RE
[2:48:26] YOUNGER BELIEVERS. MAYBE THEY DON'T KNOW
[2:48:28] WHAT THEY'RE DOING. LOOK AT HIM. HIM
[2:48:31] THAT DIED FOR YOU. AND ALWAYS ENSURE YOU
[2:48:35] PLEASE HIM. HOW DO YOU PLEASE HIM? BY
[2:48:38] HAVING FAITH. THE BIBLE SAYS WITHOUT
[2:48:42] FAITH. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM.
[2:48:46] AND HOW DO YOU HAVE FAITH? YOU HAVE
[2:48:49] FAITH. BY HEARING THE WORD. BY HEARING
[2:48:52] THE WORD, YOU RECEIVE THE WORD AND THEN
[2:48:55] HE REVEALS to you what to do.
[2:49:00] Paul sorting the believers and actually
[2:49:01] asking them to keep their mind centered
[2:49:04] on Christ.
[2:49:10] WHO IS CHRIST?
[2:49:12] CHRIST IS THE WORD.
[2:49:15] NOT LEGALISM,
[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; NOT A SET OF RULES.
[2:49:24] The word is a thought
[2:49:27] of God expressed.
[2:49:31] Let me first pause there a moment.
[2:49:34] I have seen
[2:49:37] for a long time. It's different here at
[2:49:39] DV
[2:49:43] because we have a mixed crowd.
[2:49:48] Some believe from here. Others came from
[2:49:50] other churches and the churches you came
[2:49:52] from, you know, approached the word
[2:49:54] differently.
[2:49:56] Each of them, not to say they're
[2:49:58] preaching wrong, but I'm talking about
[2:50:01] the approach of
[2:50:05] a little bit leaning towards a
[2:50:07] direction.
[2:50:09] And so then, you know, then we get this
[2:50:12] mixed and differences
[2:50:17] in Ethiopia.
[2:50:19] where we had the grace and opportunity
[2:50:21] to start from scratch.
[2:50:25] We would have a church and a place which
[2:50:29] was just a Bible church
[2:50:32] and we would have an opportunity to
[2:50:34] invite young people
[2:50:36] to invite older ones alike.
[2:50:39] Told everybody invite your friends come.
[2:50:42] Let me tell you they came with lipstick.
[2:50:48] They came with earrings.
[2:50:51] They came with painted nails.
[2:50:53] They came with long pants. The women,
[2:50:56] the boys, the shorts.
[2:51:02] Are you getting my point?
[2:51:04] They came.
[2:51:06] But right now,
[2:51:09] there's no one the way they were.
[2:51:15] Some left
[2:51:17] as they were hearing the word.
[2:51:22] This is not mine.
[2:51:25] They go back.
[2:51:27] And then Paul says, THEY WENT OUT FROM
[2:51:29] US BECAUSE they not a part of us. If
[2:51:32] they were a part of us, THEY WOULD HAVE
[2:51:34] STAYED. HOW DO YOU KNOW THE SEED OF GOD
[2:51:38] AND THE ONE WHO IS NOT?
[2:51:42] How do you know your word and the one
[2:51:44] which you never said?
[2:51:48] People speak words and they forget.
[2:51:51] But I don't believe they forget.
[2:51:54] You can never forget your words.
[2:51:57] I'm going to prove it in a moment.
[2:52:00] I don't remember I said that. Did I? No,
[2:52:02] you are lying. Be sincere
[2:52:06] because me, I may not remember that I
[2:52:09] said it like this. Like this.
[2:52:12] But if you say it the way I said it, I
[2:52:15] will remember.
[2:52:18] Because my word and I are not two
[2:52:20] different people.
[2:52:25] Let me let me prove it.
[2:52:28] I know brother
[2:52:30] um Samuel here.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; I know him and I know brother Julius.
[2:52:38] Now in the evening that that brother
[2:52:40] Shalom comes to me
[2:52:43] and tells me that brother Samuel
[2:52:46] said ABCD
[2:52:49] and brother Julia SAID ABCD
[2:52:52] AND I know them.
[2:52:54] I know how they talk.
[2:52:56] I will not accept
[2:52:59] because I know them.
[2:53:03] I forget ABOUT YOU
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; SO AND SO TO SAY LIKE THAT you are lying
[2:53:08] &gt;&gt; but there are certain words that they
[2:53:10] may say so and so say this
[2:53:13] you will say for sure that I don't even
[2:53:15] need to ask
[2:53:17] I know I know that person who talks like
[2:53:19] that
[2:53:22] you understand because the words of a
[2:53:24] person are his thoughts EXPERIENCE
[2:53:30] each of us here has a WAY THEY THINK
[2:53:35] THE WAY YOU THINK IS NOT THE WAY I
[2:53:36] THINK.
[2:53:37] THE WAY YOU THINK is not the way I
[2:53:39] think. And that makes you you. It makes
[2:53:41] me me.
[2:53:44] The way we think is different.
[2:53:47] We are made different to accomplish a
[2:53:49] different purpose.
[2:53:54] Praise God. SO NOW GOD IN THE SAME WAY.
[2:53:59] YOU SEE WHEN I say the word or CHRIST IS
[2:54:01] THE WORD.
[2:54:03] THE WORD IS A THOUGHT OF GOD.
[2:54:07] BEFORE IT IS A WORD, IT IS A PART OF
[2:54:10] GOD.
[2:54:12] AND NOW GOD EXPRESSES.
[2:54:17] AMEN. SO THE WORD IS A THOUGHT OF GOD
[2:54:20] EXPRESSED.
[2:54:23] BEFORE IT CAN BE A WORD,
[2:54:26] IT MUST BE A PART OF GOD'S FAITH.
[2:54:30] THAT'S WHY HE SAID IN JOHN 1:1,
[2:54:33] "IN THE BEGINNING WAS
[2:54:37] THE WORD AND THE WORD WAS
[2:54:41] WITH GOD." HOW WAS IT WITH GOD? IT WAS
[2:54:45] WITH GOD AS A THOUGHT.
[2:54:48] IT WAS WITH HIM AS AN ATTRIBUTE.
[2:54:52] IT WAS WITH HIM AS A PART OF HIM.
[2:54:56] AND THEN IN VERSE 14, HE SAYS,
[2:54:59] "AND THE WORD WAS MADE MANIFEST
[2:55:03] IN FLESH." SO THE WORD THAT WAS WITH GOD
[2:55:08] AS A PART OF GOD, AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF
[2:55:11] GOD,
[2:55:13] WAS NOW SPOKEN
[2:55:15] INTO MANIFESTATION.
[2:55:18] AMEN. AMEN. WHEN THE ANGEL CAME DOWN TO
[2:55:20] MARY, HE SAID, "I SHALL HAVE A SON." HE
[2:55:23] SAID, "HOW SHALL THESE THINGS BE?" HE
[2:55:25] SAYS, "THE POWER OF THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[2:55:27] OVERTAKE YOU, WILL OVERSHADOW YOU, AND
[2:55:30] YOU WILL HAVE A SON." SHE SAID, "BE IT
[2:55:33] UNTO ME ACCORDING TO
[2:55:38] YOU.
[2:55:40] BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD."
[2:55:42] AND AS SOON AS SHE SAID THAT,
[2:55:46] &gt;&gt; SHE BECAME PREGNANT.
[2:55:48] AMEN. SHE WAS PREGNANTED BY THE WORD.
[2:55:56] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[2:55:59] HALLELUJAH.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GETTING IT? MARY WAS A VIRGIN,
[2:56:05] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE WAS PREGNANTED
[2:56:08] BY THE WORD.
[2:56:11] NOW, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. AMEN.
[2:56:14] YOU MAY BE VIRGIN TO THE WORD.
[2:56:17] AND DEFILED BY THE WORLD.
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; You may be virgin to the word but
[2:56:23] defiled by the world.
[2:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD CAN DEFILE YOU.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; NO. ENTER INTO what I'm saying, the
[2:56:35] spirit of what I'm saying, my brother,
[2:56:36] or else I tell you to sit down in A
[2:56:38] MOMENT. LISTEN. DON'T be defiled by the
[2:56:41] world.
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; But many times we are defiled by the
[2:56:45] world.
[2:56:46] SO YOU CAN BE DEFILED BY THE wire
[2:56:50] and virgin TO THE WORD.
[2:56:53] YOU DON'T KNOW THE WORD. YOU ARE NOT
[2:56:55] CHANGED. YOU DRESS THE WAY YOU DRESS.
[2:56:58] YOU TALK THE WAY YOU TALK. YOU BEHAVE
[2:56:59] THE WAY YOU YOU BEHAVE. BUT WE DON'T
[2:57:02] CARE ABOUT HOW YOU BEHAVE.
[2:57:04] OUR MIND IS PURE.
[2:57:06] AMEN. AND YOUR MIND AS A BELIEVER SHOULD
[2:57:08] ALWAYS BE PURE
[2:57:10] ABOUT NEW PEOPLE THAT COME IN.
[2:57:14] BE PURE ABOUT THEM.
[2:57:16] BE PURE ABOUT THEM. I SAID BE PURE ABOUT
[2:57:19] THEM. LET THE LOVE OF JESUS
[2:57:23] OUT OF YOUR HEART. EMBRACE THEM.
[2:57:27] AMEN. AND SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
[2:57:30] LET THEM SIT UNDER THE PREACHING OF THE
[2:57:32] WORD.
[2:57:34] AMEN. IF THEY ARE A SEED OF GOD, YOU
[2:57:38] KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE OLD
[2:57:40] TESTAMENT, A VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE
[2:57:43] AND BRING FORTH A SON.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; A WHAT? A virgin.
[2:57:49] WHICH VIRGIN? WE DON'T KNOW. But there
[2:57:52] MUST BE A VIRGIN. SO WE DON'T KNOW. HOW
[2:57:55] ARE WE GOING TO KNOW? THERE IS SOMETHING
[2:57:57] IN THAT PARTICULAR VIRGIN
[2:58:01] THAT WE RECOGNIZE
[2:58:03] WHEN THE WORD COMES AND WE RECEIVE IT.
[2:58:07] PERHAPS IN THE DAYS OF OF THAT TIME
[2:58:12] THERE WERE OTHER VIRGINS
[2:58:15] prepared
[2:58:16] by the church that they are going to be
[2:58:19] pregnant by the world
[2:58:23] because they thought God ONLY COME
[2:58:25] THROUGH THEM.
[2:58:27] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT,
[2:58:30] even today we have denominations
[2:58:33] who have thought for a long time that
[2:58:35] they are the ones the word of God come
[2:58:37] through.
[2:58:39] They thought they speak on behalf of
[2:58:40] God.
[2:58:43] They they think they thought that they
[2:58:45] were speaking on behalf of God.
[2:58:49] But God,
[2:58:52] oh I pray that God gives you this
[2:58:53] revelation.
[2:58:55] But God left them long ago.
[2:59:00] The Pharisees and they said, "You see,
[2:59:02] sister,
[2:59:04] they thought God was going to use them
[2:59:08] to fulfill that scripture."
[2:59:12] So you know they were the keepers of the
[2:59:13] law for a long time.
[2:59:16] So who do you think God was going to use
[2:59:18] to fulfill the law? They thought of
[2:59:21] course us. How can God bypass our
[2:59:26] but God had left them?
[2:59:33] Oh, let me say something RIGHT HERE.
[2:59:35] TODAY, GOD IS no longer IN THE
[2:59:37] DENOMINATIONS.
[2:59:39] GOD IS NO LONGER in the big
[2:59:40] denominations.
[2:59:43] Are you hearing me?
[2:59:45] Oh, you are not getting it yet. But
[2:59:47] don't worry, you're going to get IT IN A
[2:59:48] MOMENT.
[2:59:50] GOD HAS COME DOWN THROUGH AN ANGEL
[2:59:55] MESSENGER IN OUR GENERATION
[2:59:59] AND HE HAS SPOKEN HIS WORD.
[3:00:05] AND HE HAS SPOKEN HIS WORD.
[3:00:09] THE ANGEL CAME DOWN, ANGEL GABRIEL, AND
[3:00:13] GOD BYPASSED THE BIG DENOMINATIONS
[3:00:17] AND HE SPOKE TO THIS LITTLE WOMAN
[3:00:21] WHO WAS DESPISED
[3:00:23] AND SHE SAID, "Be it unto me ACCORDING
[3:00:28] TO THY WORD." WHY DID THE ANGEL COME TO
[3:00:30] HER? BECAUSE SHE WAS PREDESTINATED
[3:00:36] TO BE THE ONE THAT WILL FULFILL THAT
[3:00:39] SCRIPTURE.
[3:00:41] SHE WAS PREDESTINATED
[3:00:43] TO BE CONFORMED
[3:00:45] TO THE image which she was supposed to
[3:00:47] be in at the moment,
[3:00:50] nine months pregnant
[3:00:55] of the God of heaven and earth.
[3:01:02] Try to run it through your mind.
[3:01:05] Does your mind understand it?
[3:01:09] &gt;&gt; God
[3:01:10] of heaven and earth
[3:01:13] in a womb
[3:01:15] of a younger girl,
[3:01:18] 9 months
[3:01:20] down.
[3:01:22] And then she started pushing.
[3:01:27] Who is she pushing?
[3:01:30] God.
[3:01:33] How does she receive him?
[3:01:36] By accepting the word.
[3:01:39] How does she manifest him?
[3:01:47] By receiving that word,
[3:01:51] she begins to push out. Push out. Push
[3:01:54] out. She can't give birth to any other
[3:01:57] character or nature.
[3:02:00] But God himself
[3:02:04] now that is history.
[3:02:06] But let me come down here.
[3:02:09] We have received a word by an angel.
[3:02:13] God has come in our generation and
[3:02:16] spoken to us my brother.
[3:02:18] MALACHI, IF you don't know what I'm
[3:02:19] talking about, Malachi 4.
[3:02:22] MALACHI 4,
[3:02:24] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I send you a legend,
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL TURN THE HEARTS OF THE
[3:02:30] FATHERS OF THE CHILDREN AND THE HEARTS
[3:02:33] OF THE CHILDREN TO THE FATHER.
[3:02:35] I WANT TO SAY to you, CHURCH, ELIJAH IS
[3:02:38] COME. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, ELIJAH IS
[3:02:40] COME. ELIJAH IS COME. ELIJAH IS COME.
[3:02:46] WHO IS THIS ELIJAH? THE THE ANGEL THAT
[3:02:49] GOD PROMISED YOU WOULD SAY
[3:02:52] IS THE SEVENTH ANGEL. HIS MESSAGE WOULD
[3:02:56] DO WHAT? HIS MESSAGE WOULD BATH THE WORD
[3:02:59] IN US.
[3:03:05] UNDERSTAND THIS ANGEL GABRIEL
[3:03:07] HIS MESSAGE BIRTH THE WORD IN MARY.
[3:03:12] AMEN. GOD HAS SENT A PROPHET MESSENGER
[3:03:15] IN OUR GENERATION. HE CAME TO BRING US
[3:03:18] BACK TO THE WORD,
[3:03:20] BACK TO THE ABSOLUTE,
[3:03:23] BACK TO SHALOM. SHALOM. AMEN. WE ARE
[3:03:26] BACK TO THE PEACE OF GOD THAT PASSES ALL
[3:03:29] WE UNDERSTAND.
[3:03:32] I TELL YOU SAINTS, WHAT WE HAVE HAD IN
[3:03:34] OUR GENERATION IS THUS SAYETH THE LORD.
[3:03:39] WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AMEN. WHEN I
[3:03:41] WAS IN CANADA, I HAVE MET A GROUP OF
[3:03:44] THEM. I WAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. I MET A
[3:03:47] GROUP OF THEM. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE
[3:03:49] WORLD.
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IS SOMEONE CATCHING THIS
[3:03:55] REVELATION? THEY ARE ALL OVER THIS WORLD
[3:03:58] AND THEY HAVE HEARD THIS MESSAGE AND
[3:04:01] THEY BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. WHAT IS IT?
[3:04:04] CHRIST. THE WORD IS B INTO THEIR LIFE.
[3:04:10] AMEN.
[3:04:13] &gt;&gt; Our mind
[3:04:15] should be stayed on Christ.
[3:04:20] &gt;&gt; Quit seeing this one, that one, this
[3:04:22] one, that one.
[3:04:24] Start seeing Christ.
[3:04:33] But you see, before it was a word,
[3:04:37] it was a part of God.
[3:04:40] I feel that some of us are not getting
[3:04:41] it.
[3:04:43] It was a part of God.
[3:04:45] So when the spirit of God comes in you
[3:04:48] by the word of God, you it don't doesn't
[3:04:51] stop there. You begin to birth out.
[3:04:56] Begin to birth. It's not easy. Bathing
[3:04:58] is not easy.
[3:05:02] Those who have ever given birth, you
[3:05:04] know what I'm talking about.
[3:05:08] The toothache can make you shout.
[3:05:11] &gt;&gt; What about the birth pains?
[3:05:14] It's not easy.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; Push.
[3:05:18] Push.
[3:05:24] Pushing a baby.
[3:05:27] That's what we are doing. Friends,
[3:05:29] it's not easy when you receive the word.
[3:05:33] You know, he says it was sweet in my
[3:05:36] mouth,
[3:05:38] but when it gone down to my belly,
[3:05:41] give me Revelation 7 at 10.
[3:05:45] Hallelujah.
[3:05:47] Got into my belly, which was bitter.
[3:05:51] Why? Because you have to birth it. You
[3:05:54] have to manifest that Christ
[3:05:57] OF THE WORD. And that's the hard part.
[3:06:00] Every day you push out.
[3:06:02] You have to be like Jesus.
[3:06:10] Pray to die.
[3:06:14] You think it is easy.
[3:06:16] All bad maners have to die.
[3:06:20] Fnication.
[3:06:23] There are some people are pushing
[3:06:24] fornication.
[3:06:28] What are you doing? YOU ARE MANIF THAT
[3:06:30] LIFE THAT CAME IN YOU BY THE POWER OF
[3:06:35] THE SPOKEN WORD.
[3:06:37] IT MUST COME OUT.
[3:06:41] And I took the little BOOK OUT OF THE
[3:06:42] ANGEL'S HAND
[3:06:45] and ate it up. What is the book?
[3:06:48] Remember the book is a book of
[3:06:49] redemption.
[3:06:52] AMEN. REMEMBER THIS BOOK. I TOLD YOU IT
[3:06:55] HAS YOUR IDENTITY.
[3:06:59] REVELATION 10:7, HE SAYS, "IN THE DAYS
[3:07:01] OF THE VOICE OF THE SEVENTH ANGEL, WHEN
[3:07:05] THIS ANGEL BEGINS TO SOUND," AMEN. THE
[3:07:08] MYSTERY OF GOD
[3:07:10] WOULD BE FURNISHED. AND I TOLD YOU WHAT
[3:07:13] THIS MYSTERY IS. AMEN. IS CHRIST BEING
[3:07:15] REVEALED THROUGH THE BRIDE, THE BODY OF
[3:07:17] BELIEVERS.
[3:07:21] AFTER WE HAVE KNOWN HIM AS DEITY,
[3:07:24] IT DOESN'T STOP WITH JESUS. HE COMES
[3:07:27] DOWN TO THE BODY TO THE CHURCH.
[3:07:30] AMEN. WHEN HE COMES DOWN, THEN HE SAYS,
[3:07:34] you know, now the church gets to know
[3:07:36] who she is
[3:07:38] and what she stands for. THEN SHE
[3:07:41] BECOMES AN ARMY
[3:07:43] WHICH THE DEVIL CANNOT DEFEAT.
[3:07:46] YOU BECOME AN ARMY. YOU BECOME AN ARMY
[3:07:50] WHICH THE DEVIL CANNOT DEFEAT.
[3:07:54] WHY IS THE DEVIL DEFEATING ME OF YOU IN
[3:07:57] your mind?
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; SAYS I'M RUNNING CRAZY. I'M LOSING MY
[3:08:00] MIND.
[3:08:02] WHY, BROTHER? LET CHRIST COME IN YOUR
[3:08:04] MIND. HE WILL GIVE YOU A PEACE
[3:08:08] THAT PASSES ALL THAT YOU UNDERSTAND.
[3:08:12] AMEN. And when he comes IN YOUR HEART,
[3:08:15] YOU KNOW WHAT? You know who you are. I'm
[3:08:17] a son OF GOD. I'M A SON OF GOD. I MUST
[3:08:21] BRING FORTH THE LIFE OF CHRIST. HIS
[3:08:25] NATURE, HIS ABILITY MUST COME OUT OF ME.
[3:08:29] I HAVE A RIVER OF LIFE FLOWING OUT OF
[3:08:31] ME. I HAVE A RIVER OF LIFE. IT BECOMES
[3:08:34] AS A revelation
[3:08:38] to a lesson. the things you're
[3:08:40] struggling with,
[3:08:42] it comes to a time.
[3:08:47] As you push out,
[3:08:50] you know, pain is there for as long as
[3:08:52] you giving birth, but when you are done,
[3:08:56] you don't remember it no more.
[3:08:59] You Oh,
[3:09:01] see. That's why he says we don't know
[3:09:05] how we shall be but when he comes
[3:09:09] we
[3:09:11] &gt;&gt; shall be like him.
[3:09:13] &gt;&gt; What happened? WE JUST BIRTHED HIM. WE
[3:09:17] BECAME HIM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND I TOOK
[3:09:21] THE LITTLE BOOK. REMEMBER THE BOOK WAS
[3:09:23] CLOSED.
[3:09:25] AMEN. BUT NOW THE BOOK IS OPEN. WHY?
[3:09:28] BECAUSE THE LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH
[3:09:30] PREVAILED.
[3:09:32] WHAT IS THE LIE OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH?
[3:09:34] WE FOUND OUT THAT GOD HIDING HIMSELF IN
[3:09:37] SIMPLICITY.
[3:09:39] HE CAME BY THE WAY OF THE LAMB.
[3:09:43] THE LAMB AS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[3:09:45] OF THE WORLD
[3:09:47] AND HAD PREVAILED to take the book.
[3:09:50] He died for you, for me. We are the
[3:09:53] purchase of his blood.
[3:09:59] We are the PURCHASE OF HIS BLOOD.
[3:10:02] AND NOW YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO be like him.
[3:10:05] So when when if we are the purchase of
[3:10:07] his blood,
[3:10:10] which one is more important? The blood
[3:10:12] or you?
[3:10:19] The blood is the cost is the PRICE
[3:10:23] is the price to pay
[3:10:28] for what is going to be redeemed.
[3:10:30] So you are the redeemed.
[3:10:34] You are not the blood but you are the
[3:10:36] redeemed. So which one is more
[3:10:38] important?
[3:10:41] If you have 1 MILLION
[3:10:44] AND SOMEONE tells you to buy my house,
[3:10:47] you need to give ME 2 MILLION. You will
[3:10:49] look for it and you will waste it. Throw
[3:10:52] it away. Give it to them. Say, I don't
[3:10:55] want my money.
[3:10:57] I want my house.
[3:11:00] My house is more valued than the money.
[3:11:02] In other words, THE BLOOD WAS GIVEN TO
[3:11:06] PURCHASE YOU
[3:11:08] TO PURCHASE ME.
[3:11:11] AMEN. WHICH MEANS I AM THE VALUE OF THE
[3:11:15] BLOOD.
[3:11:30] WITHOUT
[3:11:32] ME THERE IS NO VALUE FOR THE BLOOD.
[3:11:36] WITHOUT ME
[3:11:38] BLOOD
[3:11:42] because I was VAL
[3:11:49] AND GIVE OUT HIS BLOOD
[3:11:52] THAT HE MAY REDEEM ME
[3:11:55] THAT I AM THE REDEEMED. I AM THE
[3:11:57] REDEEMED WHICH MEANS I AM THE POWER OF
[3:12:00] THE BLOOD.
[3:12:02] HOW CAN I BE LOST?
[3:12:07] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[3:12:10] And that's why he says
[3:12:13] well now after the book has been opened
[3:12:16] everything that was Adam
[3:12:19] and Adam himself and everything that was
[3:12:21] his that had fallen
[3:12:25] was now redeemed.
[3:12:27] brought back again.
[3:12:29] Do you know why?
[3:12:31] Because it has always been a part of
[3:12:33] God.
[3:12:36] We were we were at the thought of God.
[3:12:40] You see now why we are the
[3:12:44] we are the um the u the value of the
[3:12:48] blood.
[3:12:56] because
[3:12:58] we were a part of him.
[3:13:02] &gt;&gt; Maybe for you to understand it, it's
[3:13:05] like if you lose your hand,
[3:13:09] what would you do to get it back?
[3:13:14] What would you do?
[3:13:16] Tell me. Would you be willing to do
[3:13:19] anything
[3:13:21] if you can get back the hand?
[3:13:25] God was willing to do anything
[3:13:29] to get you back. Hallelujah. He wasn't
[3:13:32] buying you a new.
[3:13:36] He was bringing you back because you
[3:13:39] have always been a part of you.
[3:13:42] And now after knowing who you are,
[3:13:46] now he says take the book. You've
[3:13:49] received the revelation, but you need to
[3:13:51] go through the process.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Eat the book. I took the book and I ate
[3:13:57] and I ate the book and
[3:14:00] it was my mouth sweet as honey
[3:14:02] and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly
[3:14:05] was bitter.
[3:14:07] And then he says,
[3:14:10] "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[3:14:15] unto many pe uh before again before man,
[3:14:18] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[3:14:20] kings.
[3:14:24] Praise God. We must birth this life."
[3:14:29] When we prophesy again,
[3:14:32] what does it mean? We're going to speak
[3:14:34] again the word. Cuz
[3:14:38] remember our mind
[3:14:40] after we are redeemed and his mind is
[3:14:44] the same. Hallelujah. So now whatever we
[3:14:48] see in ourselves that's not of God.
[3:14:53] It has to go. It has to go. But you see
[3:14:57] it cannot go without the power of
[3:15:00] creation. And the power of creation is
[3:15:03] now in us. So we have to prophesy. So we
[3:15:07] have to speak again like it was in the
[3:15:09] beginning when God said let there be. SO
[3:15:12] WE BEGIN SPEAKING.
[3:15:14] AMEN. AND that's the groaning. That
[3:15:16] that's the bitterness
[3:15:19] cuz you have to die. Unless something be
[3:15:22] born again
[3:15:26] before it can be word.
[3:15:29] It has to be a part of God.
[3:15:31] In s we would see Jesus. You say there
[3:15:34] is nothing wrong.
[3:15:36] Everything is going to turn out all
[3:15:38] right.
[3:15:40] Don't be scared. Tell that to your
[3:15:42] friend. Don't be scared.
[3:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's big time piece is sticking
[3:15:48] right along.
[3:15:52] It will have a church without spot
[3:15:53] wrinkle.
[3:15:56] IT WAS HIS THINKING.
[3:15:58] THE THING OF IT IS, AM I IN THERE? ARE
[3:16:02] YOU IN THERE
[3:16:06] in his thinking?
[3:16:08] Are you want to SAY YES I AM?
[3:16:11] &gt;&gt; YES I AM. AND HERE HE WAS ETERNAL
[3:16:15] THOUGHTS OF GOD
[3:16:18] EXPRESSED INTO SUNSHIP.
[3:16:20] OH MY. THERE WAS GOD
[3:16:24] EMMANUEL. NOTICE THAT HE HE WAS THE
[3:16:27] WORD.
[3:16:29] You see, don't let anyone spoil you
[3:16:32] after anything.
[3:16:35] Philosophy, vanty, tradition of men,
[3:16:37] rootments of the world, not after
[3:16:39] Christ.
[3:16:42] Christ is the image of the invisible
[3:16:44] God.
[3:16:46] The firstborn of every creature.
[3:16:50] God powered himself in Christ.
[3:16:53] Christ powered himself where?
[3:16:59] You know, sometimes when I preach or
[3:17:01] when people preach,
[3:17:03] we think we preach so hard.
[3:17:06] &gt;&gt; And sometimes as a preacher, you wonder,
[3:17:07] are the people getting it?
[3:17:10] But I tell you what, we we don't get it
[3:17:14] by our five senses.
[3:17:18] We get it by the sixth sense.
[3:17:25] And you don't know you have it until you
[3:17:27] are in danger.
[3:17:33] Some of you don't know you can fly until
[3:17:35] a lion comes to you.
[3:17:39] That's when you realize you can actually
[3:17:41] fly.
[3:17:45] What happened?
[3:17:47] You had it in you.
[3:17:49] But if someone tell you hey jump
[3:17:52] I have no strength.
[3:17:55] But let the lion come.
[3:17:57] You will not even know where the power
[3:17:59] the strength and everything comes from.
[3:18:03] You will not only jump.
[3:18:06] You will fly.
[3:18:08] I don't even know how I I but I found
[3:18:10] myself outside.
[3:18:15] It is in you.
[3:18:17] So the word is actually being formed in
[3:18:19] you.
[3:18:23] Give me 10 minutes. I'll finish. SO GOD
[3:18:25] POWERED HIMSELF in Christ.
[3:18:28] Christ powered himself in us.
[3:18:32] SO WE TODAY WE ARE THE EXPRESS IMAGE of
[3:18:36] Christ on earth.
[3:18:41] Christ wants to be
[3:18:44] all in all.
[3:18:50] to
[3:18:56] live our life.
[3:18:59] You know
[3:19:02] is not no longer our life but he wants
[3:19:04] to live his life
[3:19:07] in us
[3:19:11] through us.
[3:19:17] listen to this. The indictment HE SAYS
[3:19:19] THE HOLY GHOST TODAY, today not
[3:19:23] yesterday, today is not the third
[3:19:25] person. It is God himself
[3:19:30] manifested
[3:19:31] in human flesh.
[3:19:36] The Holy Ghost is he himself
[3:19:40] manifested in human flesh by what? The
[3:19:44] blood of Jesus to sanctify A LIFE THAT
[3:19:49] HE MIGHT REFLECT himself through.
[3:19:54] AMEN. I AM THE REFLECTION
[3:19:58] OF THE LIFE OF CHRIST.
[3:20:01] HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEY AND THEY CRUCIFY THAT
[3:20:04] SAME WORD MADE MANIFEST
[3:20:18] AND THEY ARE CRUCIFYING THAT SAME WORD
[3:20:20] MADE FRESH TODAY.
[3:20:24] AMEN.
[3:20:25] &gt;&gt; YES.
[3:20:27] HALLELUJAH.
[3:20:30] &gt;&gt; Now listen when when when God
[3:20:32] was made manifest.
[3:20:35] &gt;&gt; If you get it, say amen. That means
[3:20:37] this.
[3:20:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Joseph, are you getting it? When
[3:20:41] God was made manifest
[3:20:43] in Christ, they did what? To him?
[3:20:48] They crucified him. They did not know.
[3:20:51] They were crucifying the word man.
[3:20:55] AND NOW
[3:20:57] WHEN THE WORK TODAY
[3:21:00] IS GOD HIMSELF
[3:21:02] MANIFESTED IN human flesh by the blood
[3:21:05] of JESUS CHRIST TO SANCTIFY A life that
[3:21:08] he might reflect himself THROUGH
[3:21:12] that's me. If you are the one just say
[3:21:15] that's me.
[3:21:17] Amen. He wants to manifest his life oh
[3:21:19] God through me.
[3:21:22] and they crucify that same word made
[3:21:24] man.
[3:21:27] You find people crucifying you for
[3:21:30] believing what you believe, for refusing
[3:21:33] their ways, for doing WHAT YOU DO. THEY
[3:21:36] DON'T KNOW BUT THEY ARE CRUCIFYING THAT
[3:21:39] CHRIST.
[3:21:41] The crucifixion of Christ today
[3:21:44] is the people who will deny the
[3:21:46] vindicated and manifested son of God
[3:21:49] among the people.
[3:21:57] his things that he said he would take
[3:21:59] place
[3:22:01] in this day by his word.
[3:22:04] Have you ever heard of this song?
[3:22:07] We are the word made flesh today.
[3:22:11] Give me the song if you have it. Some of
[3:22:14] these things we sing it but we don't
[3:22:15] understand it.
[3:22:18] Brothers and sisters, we need to come to
[3:22:20] maturity.
[3:22:23] &gt;&gt; Many believers are still living in the
[3:22:26] in the realms of legalism.
[3:22:32] The message is not that
[3:22:36] come up higher.
[3:22:41] We are the word made flesh today.
[3:22:45] This is what the scripture said
[3:22:48] and our names are seen within in the
[3:22:51] book redeemed and perfect without sin.
[3:22:57] We are anointed
[3:23:00] and inspired by our God
[3:23:05] who is the original life
[3:23:09] redeemed.
[3:23:10] I've already talked about that. Perfect.
[3:23:14] HEY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
[3:23:17] WITHOUT SIN?
[3:23:19] Do you EVEN GET IT?
[3:23:21] THEY THAT ARE BORN OF GOD CANNOT SIN.
[3:23:26] SO I AM REDEEMED. I AM PERFECT. I AM THE
[3:23:30] WORD MADE FLESH TODAY. I AM THE REDEEMED
[3:23:34] OF THE LORD.
[3:23:36] AMEN. I AM INSPIRED.
[3:23:40] AMEN.
[3:23:42] &gt;&gt; But if you say to the person, you say,
[3:23:44] "What are you talking about?"
[3:23:47] Are you making yourself God?
[3:23:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you know that I'm a part of God?
[3:23:55] Don't you know that the bride is a part
[3:23:57] of him? Don't you know he's the head, WE
[3:24:01] ARE THE BODY. SO WE ARE HIM.
[3:24:05] M
[3:24:07] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY REJECT YOUR LIFE,
[3:24:12] they reject Christ.
[3:24:14] It's not I'm don't not talking about the
[3:24:15] WORKS OF YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[3:24:17] I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORK OF CHRIST
[3:24:20] THROUGH YOU.
[3:24:22] AND THEY SAY she's pretending. He's
[3:24:23] pretending.
[3:24:27] THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
[3:24:28] ABOUT. THAT IS CHRIST IN YOU. AND THEY
[3:24:32] ARE PERSECUTING HIM. THEY'RE TRYING TO
[3:24:34] KILL HIM. THEY'RE TALKING AGAINST HIM.
[3:24:37] YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD NOT SEE
[3:24:39] ANY EVIL, NOT THINK ANY EVIL, NOT SAY
[3:24:41] ANY EVIL. WHY? BECAUSE THAT IS A
[3:24:43] BROTHER, IS A SISTER, IS A WORD MADE
[3:24:46] FLESH TODAY.
[3:24:57] EVEN THE MYSTERY WHICH HAS BEEN HID FROM
[3:25:00] AGES
[3:25:02] AND GENERATIONS,
[3:25:04] BUT NOW, TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, BUT NOW.
[3:25:07] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW, NOT YESTERDAY. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[3:25:11] BUT NOW IS MADE WHAT?
[3:25:17] &gt;&gt; Manifest
[3:25:20] unveiled.
[3:25:23] To who? To everyone?
[3:25:26] To who?
[3:25:28] To his saints.
[3:25:32] to whom God would make known what is the
[3:25:34] riches of the glory of this mystery.
[3:25:41] Christ in you.
[3:25:47] Now there is a part you have not seen
[3:25:48] before.
[3:25:50] You have always read it but I want you
[3:25:53] to see it and it will blow your mind.
[3:25:58] What do we preach?
[3:26:00] We preach the word.
[3:26:03] But remember I said after you eat the
[3:26:04] book,
[3:26:07] prophesy again, speak the word. Why?
[3:26:12] Because we are preaching the word. It's
[3:26:14] the word that gives life. The word is a
[3:26:16] thought of God. Is a thought before it
[3:26:19] is the word. And then is expressed. But
[3:26:22] then here he says to whom he says to
[3:26:25] whom God would make known what is the
[3:26:27] riches of the glory of this mystery.
[3:26:30] among the Gentiles, which is
[3:26:34] which is
[3:26:36] Christ.
[3:26:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, say it.
[3:26:40] &gt;&gt; I want to say those ones with
[3:26:41] revelation. Say it.
[3:26:46] &gt;&gt; What? Say it again.
[3:26:50] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[3:26:51] &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS YOU. NOT CHRIST IN YOU, BUT
[3:26:54] CHRIST IN ME.
[3:26:57] THE HOPE OF GLORY.
[3:26:59] &gt;&gt; SO IN OTHER WORDS, THIS CHRIST IS THE
[3:27:02] MYSTERY WHICH WAS HID FROM AGES AND
[3:27:06] GENERATIONS. THIS CHRIST, BUT WHERE IS
[3:27:09] HE?
[3:27:11] &gt;&gt; IN ME.
[3:27:14] AMEN. AMEN.
[3:27:15] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. H LOOK AT THIS.
[3:27:19] TO WHOM?
[3:27:21] &gt;&gt; TO WHOM
[3:27:24] &gt;&gt; WHOM WE PREACH. NO, NO. VERSES 28, WHOM
[3:27:26] WE PREACH,
[3:27:28] WARNING EVERY MAN, TEACHING EVERY MAN IN
[3:27:32] ALL WISDOM, THAT WE MAY PRESENT EVERY
[3:27:35] MAN
[3:27:37] perfect
[3:27:39] in this Christ Jesus. SO WHO DO WE
[3:27:42] PREACH? WE PREACH CHRIST. HE'S THE WORD.
[3:27:46] BUT WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN ME. SO WHO AM I
[3:27:49] PREACHING? I'M PREACHING CHRIST. I AM
[3:27:52] NOT JUST PREACHING, BROTHER. I AM
[3:27:54] SPEAKING THE WORD.
[3:27:59] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH.
[3:28:01] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE LIVING THE LIFE OF THE
[3:28:06] WORD BY LIVING THE LIFE OF THE WORD IN
[3:28:09] US.
[3:28:11] We are manifesting Christ.
[3:28:14] We are preaching Christ.
[3:28:16] But the bam says instead of preaching
[3:28:18] someone leave me one.
[3:28:25] There are many people. Oh yes,
[3:28:28] THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE who can preach
[3:28:30] maybe better than us believers.
[3:28:33] I can tell YOU THAT. I CAN TELL YOU
[3:28:35] THAT. They can. They're so eloquent.
[3:28:39] They can talk so well. But there's one
[3:28:42] area they lack and they can never get is
[3:28:46] the life.
[3:28:48] Why? They know how to talk
[3:28:52] but they have rejected the word of the
[3:28:53] hour.
[3:28:55] It's only the bride in this hour that
[3:28:58] can manifest the life of the world.
[3:29:02] So don't you worry. Whatever you're
[3:29:03] going through,
[3:29:05] the hardships you're finding, the
[3:29:07] temptations and sin that easily beset
[3:29:09] you. Keep pushing. Keep pushing. THAT
[3:29:13] LIFE MUST COME OUT. IT'S LIKE A WOMAN
[3:29:15] WHO IS PREGNANT. YOU GIVE BIRTH OR YOU
[3:29:18] DIE.
[3:29:20] EVEN THOUGH YOU DIE. AMEN. BUT I WANT TO
[3:29:23] BE like one of those THAT WOULD SAY I
[3:29:25] CANNOT DIE. I WILL LIVE. AMEN. What am I
[3:29:30] going to do? I must give BIRTH TO THIS
[3:29:32] CHILD. I I MUST PUT TO BED. HEY, I MUST
[3:29:36] BRING FORTH THIS CHILD. I MUST BRING
[3:29:38] FORTH HIS LIFE. I CANNOT ALLOW THE FEAR
[3:29:42] TO DESTROY ME. I CANNOT ALLOW LUST TO
[3:29:45] KILL ME. I CANNOT ALLOW ALL THESE THINGS
[3:29:47] THAT ARE AROUND ME TO DESTROY MY NATURE.
[3:29:51] I HAVE SOMETHING IN ME. THE LIFE OF
[3:29:53] JESUS, I MUST B IT. I MUST BRING FORTH
[3:29:58] THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[3:30:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's the cry of the bride in
[3:30:03] this hour.
[3:30:06] And I finish with a quote I started
[3:30:08] with.
[3:30:10] And I think a good little thing you
[3:30:11] ought to set around on your desk. It's a
[3:30:12] little thing I sat down on in Florida
[3:30:14] not long ago. It was three little
[3:30:15] monkeys.
[3:30:17] Put up that picture, brother.
[3:30:24] Three little monkeys.
[3:30:26] One of them had in his hand over his
[3:30:28] eyes and they said, "See no evil."
[3:30:32] And the other one had in his fingers, in
[3:30:34] his ears, he said, "No evil. Hear no
[3:30:36] evil."
[3:30:38] And the other one had in his hand over
[3:30:40] his mouth, he said, "Speak no evil.
[3:30:44] And then brother Bam CONTINUES AND SAYS
[3:30:47] JUST KEEP YOUR MIND PURE ON CHRIST.
[3:30:54] KEEP YOUR MIND PURE ON CHRIST.
[3:30:57] WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN YOUR BROTHER. HE'S
[3:31:00] IN YOUR SISTER.
[3:31:02] AMEN. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
[3:31:05] YOU ARE SEEING IN AROUND ME.
[3:31:09] &gt;&gt; NO BROTHER, I DIDN'T SAY THAT. THERE ARE
[3:31:10] MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING AROUND ME.
[3:31:14] THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING
[3:31:16] AROUND LANGA.
[3:31:18] THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU ARE SEEING
[3:31:19] AROUND YOUR BROTHER.
[3:31:21] BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT DEFINES THEM.
[3:31:26] THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THIS FLESH.
[3:31:30] THEY ARE IN THIS HOUSE. BUT I HAVE A
[3:31:32] MESSAGE FOR YOU THIS MORNING. THIS HOUSE
[3:31:35] OF GRACE
[3:31:37] ONE DAY IS GOING TO BUST WIDE OPEN.
[3:31:41] AMEN. AND THE REAL WILL COME.
[3:31:46] AMEN. AND WILL COME IN A REAL BODY
[3:31:51] IN THE THEOPHONY.
[3:31:53] AMEN. THAT'S WHY WHEN I HEAR THE WORD
[3:32:03] CONNECT, CONNECTION, CONNECT,
[3:32:04] CONNECTION, CONNECT.
[3:32:06] HOW MANY ARE FEELING THE CONNECTION?
[3:32:09] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE NOT DEFINED
[3:32:13] BY YOUR TRIALS.
[3:32:18] You are not defined
[3:32:20] by your weaknesses.
[3:32:23] Can I come down to you? You are not
[3:32:26] defined by your weakness.
[3:32:31] The thing that makes you want to lose
[3:32:32] your mind
[3:32:35] is not what defines you.
[3:32:38] You remember the thing you said you went
[3:32:39] and pray God if you don't take this AWAY
[3:32:44] stop praying like that
[3:32:48] because it's not God to take it away. It
[3:32:52] is you to birth that life.
[3:32:57] So what is your work?
[3:32:59] Keep eating the word.
[3:33:02] The more you eat the word,
[3:33:04] the more life comes out.
[3:33:07] The more life comes out. And one of
[3:33:10] these days, friends,
[3:33:12] we are going to manifest that life in
[3:33:14] fullness,
[3:33:17] in completeness
[3:33:20] and in joy.
[3:33:25] And now he says,
[3:33:27] just keep your mind pure on Christ.
[3:33:32] You can't just say well now see if you
[3:33:34] don't watch well you will get yourself
[3:33:36] over into a place if you can't keep on
[3:33:37] thinking that I don't think that you
[3:33:39] have you you can't leave so perfect till
[3:33:41] you don't make that mistake now now
[3:33:43] don't you think you will ever get that
[3:33:45] way cuz you won't no sir you are not
[3:33:48] sinless and you will suddenly get off on
[3:33:50] their track on this side and on that
[3:33:53] side what he's saying is that we are not
[3:33:55] going to live perfect in the sense that
[3:33:57] we are not going to make mistakes
[3:34:06] We will make those mistakes.
[3:34:08] But you see,
[3:34:12] that doesn't define you.
[3:34:16] Keep your eyes and your mind on Christ.
[3:34:23] But a man that's once knocked down, if
[3:34:26] he's a real soldier,
[3:34:30] He will rise up again.
[3:34:32] Lord, let me rise and try it again.
[3:34:36] But a coward as soon as he sees he makes
[3:34:39] his first little mistake.
[3:34:42] Just like I said this morning, the bug
[3:34:44] in the in the water spider will crawl
[3:34:47] right back in the water again.
[3:34:56] so refuse all the old prophet bubbling
[3:35:01] and carrying on and talking. Bubbling
[3:35:03] means confusion.
[3:35:06] The Bible said mark those who cause
[3:35:08] contentions among you.
[3:35:13] Brother, give me that picture if you
[3:35:15] have it that I I shared with you.
[3:35:20] the other picture.
[3:35:22] Um, if you have it, I want us to just
[3:35:26] see a little bit about the mind as I as
[3:35:28] I close.
[3:35:31] And as he's getting it, he says, "Let me
[3:35:33] go in your office
[3:35:36] and you tell me you are a Christian
[3:35:38] and let me hear you turn on your radio
[3:35:40] when I'm in there
[3:35:43] and you are listening to those some kind
[3:35:45] of old bogy music
[3:35:49] and let me see that half dressed women
[3:35:53] and pinups all on the side of your wall.
[3:35:57] I don't care what you say.
[3:35:59] I know what your spirit is feeding on.
[3:36:06] &gt;&gt; You You check it. Check the the DVF
[3:36:08] media. It should be there. And uh then
[3:36:11] it says, "And you people that you know
[3:36:15] here is speaking of the people that uh
[3:36:17] feed on on stuff
[3:36:22] cuz I want to show you the the picture
[3:36:23] on the uh on the mind and um and and on
[3:36:27] the spirit and body.
[3:36:33] And uh this is very important friends
[3:36:36] and maybe if he doesn't get a picture
[3:36:38] just speak it.
[3:36:41] You know I want to show you that we have
[3:36:44] we are we are a triune being.
[3:36:49] We are soul, body, spirit.
[3:36:53] And you see in our senses
[3:36:57] in the body, these are the senses we use
[3:37:00] to contact the earth.
[3:37:03] See, hear, feel, taste, smell.
[3:37:08] But but you know those are the doors
[3:37:13] through the body that if you open those
[3:37:17] doors
[3:37:19] something will come in your spirit
[3:37:23] which is your mind
[3:37:27] and many times we see wrong things
[3:37:32] we hear wrong things
[3:37:35] we we we we test wrong things and smell
[3:37:38] and feel wrong things
[3:37:42] and and and speak wrong things.
[3:37:45] And when we open those doors,
[3:37:49] the devil defiles our mind.
[3:37:57] You may be the best person of the best
[3:37:59] character,
[3:38:02] but if someone meets someone and talks
[3:38:04] them against you,
[3:38:08] that person or that someone will see you
[3:38:10] in a different light.
[3:38:16] Why? Because they open their their
[3:38:18] hearing
[3:38:21] and they cannot hear what they have
[3:38:23] heard.
[3:38:27] So then their mind,
[3:38:31] what's the mind? The mind is your
[3:38:33] memory.
[3:38:37] You remember everything that you you you
[3:38:39] had
[3:38:41] your conscience,
[3:38:44] your affection,
[3:38:46] your imagination,
[3:38:50] your reasoning.
[3:38:52] This is all your mind
[3:38:55] is your intelligence.
[3:38:57] As long as you open those five senses of
[3:39:00] the body,
[3:39:02] it comes and affects your mind.
[3:39:06] And that you find that your mind is not
[3:39:07] focused on Christ,
[3:39:11] but it's focused on everything else but
[3:39:14] Christ.
[3:39:25] um quote he says, "And you people with
[3:39:27] these soul blade tempers
[3:39:32] that's always spouting off in the mouth
[3:39:34] at somebody.
[3:39:37] You know, someone just grieves you
[3:39:40] and you don't have self-control.
[3:39:43] Some people don't have self-control."
[3:39:46] Let me tell you, you should always have
[3:39:48] self-control.
[3:39:52] Don't answer somebody when you are
[3:39:53] angry.
[3:39:56] Be it a husband or wife,
[3:39:59] daughter,
[3:40:01] whatever it is,
[3:40:03] don't answer anybody when you are angry.
[3:40:07] The Holy Spirit in you should give you
[3:40:10] self-control
[3:40:12] that you have heard things and it has
[3:40:15] made you angry. So you have this TEMPER
[3:40:21] and you go back, oh, I shouldn't have
[3:40:22] done that.
[3:40:25] I shouldn't have said that. Instead of
[3:40:28] doing that,
[3:40:31] always remember when you are angry,
[3:40:34] the Holy Spirit should give you enough
[3:40:37] character
[3:40:39] to stay calm.
[3:40:43] You feel the devil through the flesh
[3:40:46] pressuring you. SAY SOMETHING.
[3:40:50] DO SOMETHING.
[3:40:53] refuse
[3:40:56] no
[3:40:57] &gt;&gt; I will do nothing
[3:40:59] I will hear nothing I will say nothing
[3:41:04] I'm put now that's another level of
[3:41:07] self-control
[3:41:10] and then when you are calm
[3:41:12] come back and have a discussion
[3:41:15] you'll always realize
[3:41:17] you on top of the
[3:41:21] can't put up on things like that.
[3:41:24] If you always have this sole tempers,
[3:41:29] be careful.
[3:41:32] You are guilty if you speak a word
[3:41:35] against your brother.
[3:41:40] That is not right.
[3:41:43] That's not just
[3:41:46] you. go around and tear down.
[3:41:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stick a knife in a
[3:41:53] man's back to kill him.
[3:41:59] You can break his character and kill
[3:42:00] him.
[3:42:04] You can kill his influence.
[3:42:08] Speak against your pastor here.
[3:42:11] Say something about him.
[3:42:13] you just might as well as shot him,
[3:42:18] told something that wasn't right about
[3:42:20] him.
[3:42:22] &gt;&gt; Well, it will kill his influence with
[3:42:23] the people
[3:42:26] and things like that AND YOU ARE GUILTY
[3:42:27] OF IT.
[3:42:30] SO, how then should we leave?
[3:42:34] Don't let temper control you.
[3:42:38] If you have temper, don't say a word.
[3:42:42] Give me that picture again.
[3:42:45] &gt;&gt; I want us to look at it again.
[3:42:48] Hear no nothing.
[3:42:51] &gt;&gt; Say no evil.
[3:42:53] &gt;&gt; Think no evil.
[3:42:55] &gt;&gt; See Christ in your brother.
[3:43:01] I CAN'T LOVE THEM.
[3:43:04] THEY DID THIS TO ME.
[3:43:06] &gt;&gt; IN THE present water, present ever
[3:43:09] present water from the rock. It says,
[3:43:10] "And what we love each other is not
[3:43:14] because that we are somebody,
[3:43:18] but it is the Christ in one ANOTHER
[3:43:25] that we love."
[3:43:31] Hallelujah.
[3:43:33] It's the God that is in our beings that
[3:43:35] we love.
[3:43:39] Hallelujah.
[3:43:40] This man has done a lot of bad things to
[3:43:42] me.
[3:43:44] But I love him dear.
[3:43:48] Why? I love Christ in him.
[3:43:51] Pastor, you mean someone can have Christ
[3:43:54] in THEM AND DO SOMEBODY STOPPING? Oh
[3:43:58] yes. Because they still have the flesh.
[3:44:02] So then you look beyond the flesh.
[3:44:07] Jesus was God and yet he still wept.
[3:44:13] He thought he's God.
[3:44:17] He was sleeping, tired,
[3:44:19] but yet God,
[3:44:22] you have Christ in you.
[3:44:24] But remember
[3:44:26] that brother is the same. That sister is
[3:44:28] the same. See Christ in one of you.
[3:44:33] Turn around. Check your brother, sisters
[3:44:35] and tell them I love you. Love you.
[3:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[3:45:15] I don't know. Does somebody know the
[3:45:17] song? Maybe a sister or something that
[3:45:19] can help us sing it.
[3:45:43] You know, we should love one another.

[3:45:49] always love your brother.

[4:00:07] Amen.
[4:00:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want us to close the
[4:00:10] service. Before we do,
[4:00:14] I have to remind you that uh
[4:00:17] this next coming Saturday
[4:00:20] is brother Mar's wedding.
[4:00:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he can't wait for next Saturday.
[4:00:28] I I'm sure I did not see you when we
[4:00:31] were singing the song, but I don't know
[4:00:32] whether you sang it because you know we
[4:00:35] always say when a person is going to the
[4:00:36] wedding said let rapture rapture can
[4:00:38] wait after my wedding.
[4:00:47] But we are waiting for the resurrection
[4:00:48] morning.
[4:00:51] That's our priority.
[4:00:54] Praise God. So please um I think brother
[4:00:57] Martin will come and say a few words
[4:00:59] perhaps too about the contributions and
[4:01:01] all that.
[4:01:04] Uh but I also wanted to say to you,
[4:01:08] we are doing well
[4:01:11] as far as our land fund is concerned,
[4:01:15] but we are not yet there. And I want to
[4:01:18] thank really from my heart sincerely
[4:01:20] thank those who have really fulfilled
[4:01:23] and are fulfilling their commitments.
[4:01:29] God richly bless you.
[4:01:32] There's no other way we are going to do
[4:01:33] this.
[4:01:35] I tell you the truth.
[4:01:38] God is going to accomplish this through
[4:01:40] us.
[4:01:42] We are people of faith. We expect
[4:01:44] results.
[4:01:46] We expect miracles.
[4:01:48] But we don't want to live by them.
[4:01:52] We want to live by faith.
[4:01:55] And if and if by faith faith without
[4:01:58] works is dead
[4:02:00] do something or not.
[4:02:03] If you you know I'm seeing God blessing
[4:02:05] people simple people
[4:02:09] with jobs and let me tell you if you're
[4:02:12] faithful on the work of God
[4:02:14] he will bless you. I was surprised when
[4:02:17] I heard her sister. I know she has been
[4:02:19] working
[4:02:22] but I know she's one of those faithful
[4:02:24] givers
[4:02:27] and you know I was speaking with one of
[4:02:28] the brothers I think was it in Canada
[4:02:31] and I think I find it to be true
[4:02:34] anywhere
[4:02:36] that sometimes people you expect to give
[4:02:41] they don't.
[4:02:42] And sometimes those you expect not to
[4:02:44] give much,
[4:02:46] they surprise you. They give a lot and
[4:02:50] God blesses them in return.
[4:02:55] It's a program of God. It's not our
[4:02:56] program.
[4:02:59] It is a program of God. Let's do it
[4:03:02] friends. So we need 10 more millions.
[4:03:05] And by the way, not to mention we used 4
[4:03:07] something. How much was it, brother?
[4:03:09] Someone tell me on the rent.
[4:03:14] So that 20 is not all there.
[4:03:18] So but generally I would want to say we
[4:03:22] need 10 more millions
[4:03:27] by tomorrow
[4:03:30] because we need to to pay
[4:03:33] this gentleman the 30 millions which is
[4:03:35] the first phase. We need to pay 30
[4:03:38] millions four times
[4:03:41] to be able to now fully occupy our
[4:03:45] lives.
[4:03:47] So those are the targets.
[4:03:50] So if you have pledged and you're not
[4:03:53] fulfilling,
[4:03:54] you're putting us behind.
[4:03:57] Don't wait for the big big blessing.
[4:04:01] Give the little you can afford
[4:04:05] every week and God will bless you
[4:04:09] according
[4:04:12] accordingly rather.
[4:04:16] God could not give that widow
[4:04:20] more oil
[4:04:22] than the vessel she broke.
[4:04:27] Right?
[4:04:29] So
[4:04:31] God has a lot
[4:04:34] but the see the principle is you sow and
[4:04:38] you reap. If you sow sparingly
[4:04:42] you reap sparingly.
[4:04:45] I'm not hearing any amen.
[4:04:47] So let us sow.
[4:04:50] I'm an example.
[4:04:52] I truly give
[4:04:55] and I know many here who also
[4:04:59] I if I mention names I'll leave out some
[4:05:02] but those of you have been faithful I
[4:05:05] want to say God bless your faithfulness
[4:05:08] and to those of you who sincerely have
[4:05:10] nothing to give.
[4:05:13] We pray that God will provide for you,
[4:05:16] that you will give. And those who maybe
[4:05:19] feel that
[4:05:21] they don't have what to give yet they
[4:05:23] do.
[4:05:27] May God give you revelation
[4:05:29] that you may be able to know.
[4:05:32] God bless you saints.
[4:05:34] I'll ask you maybe to sit for a minute,
[4:05:38] but the service is dismissed.
[4:05:41] meet see you on Wednesday. Pray for me.
[4:05:44] Potentially I'll be going to West Nile.
[4:05:50] &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord willing on Tuesday
[4:05:54] for a few days.
[4:05:56] We need to meet the pastors there
[4:06:00] and uh to help them get started with the
[4:06:02] translation
[4:06:05] and to try and put a team together to to
[4:06:07] start that translation.
[4:06:12] So pray pray pray for that God will give
[4:06:14] us grace. God bless you all. You can
[4:06:17] greet one another and tell your brother
[4:06:19] sister God bless you.
[4:06:38] God bless you saints.
[4:06:41] Amen.
[4:07:47] Good, good, good. I feel good,
[4:07:50] wonderful, good.
[4:07:56] &gt;&gt; Sorry. So before you go, sorry. Uh,
