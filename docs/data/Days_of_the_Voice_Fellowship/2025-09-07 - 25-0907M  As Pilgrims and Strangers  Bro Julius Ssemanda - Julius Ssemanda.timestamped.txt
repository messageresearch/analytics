[1:13:36] Sometimes we feel like Peter.
[1:13:41] We feel like Peter when you came to him
[1:13:46] and he said go away from me Lord
[1:13:50] for I am a sinful man.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; But you said come
[1:13:55] and follow me. I'll make thee fishermen.
[1:14:02] Dear God Almighty,
[1:14:05] as David said, if you would number all
[1:14:07] my iniquities,
[1:14:12] I could not stand.
[1:14:15] But blessed is that man
[1:14:19] whom the Lord does not impute in
[1:14:23] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] that was shed on Calvary.
[1:14:30] Father, we are so thankful.
[1:14:33] It means so much to us.
[1:14:37] It has brought us together.
[1:14:40] in fellowship with your holiness
[1:14:44] and with your righteousness
[1:14:46] and with your promises.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Dear God Almighty,
[1:14:51] I ask for your grace.
[1:14:54] As the song s was sung,
[1:14:58] I thought of myself as a mighty
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; that I can do a lot on my own,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; but I can't even walk
[1:15:10] without you holding on.
[1:15:14] Precious Jesus,
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; lover of my soul,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; savior of the universe,
[1:15:22] come Lord in our ministry

[1:15:36] today,
[1:15:38] not to hear from me, Lord, but to hear
[1:15:41] from you. He can minister to them
[1:15:45] something that will help them
[1:15:48] to bring them closer to thee
[1:15:51] because Lord you are all that matters.
[1:15:56] For these people Lord
[1:15:59] and needy and helpless.

[1:18:53] spirituality
[1:18:57] that you can still have some space
[1:19:02] and I was wondering
[1:19:04] I said the people too satisfied
[1:19:07] what am I going to tell them
[1:19:11] because the they are in the convention
[1:19:17] what now will what more do I have
[1:19:22] I believe they are satisfied.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; But uh
[1:19:28] perhaps there's something small
[1:19:31] that God would have us to hear
[1:19:35] this morning.
[1:19:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:19:46] Thank you once again for making it
[1:19:47] church today.
[1:19:51] It's a sacrifice to come to church every
[1:19:54] time
[1:19:58] and uh we find many people
[1:20:03] who seem not to understand us
[1:20:07] I was coming to church I think two weeks
[1:20:09] back
[1:20:12] I met there was a man in the taxi
[1:20:17] he was event, seventh advent
[1:20:23] and I'm he was really waiting for me to
[1:20:25] come
[1:20:26] [Music]
[1:20:30] to he was waiting for me to come
[1:20:34] because they had booked a seat for me
[1:20:38] there was I was seated the daughter of
[1:20:41] brother Martin
[1:20:44] he was really on fire for his doctrine
[1:20:49] He told me I wanted to talk to this
[1:20:51] young girl
[1:20:54] about it.
[1:20:56] You know they are the day they keep
[1:20:59] things like that.
[1:21:03] But I said let me wait for the pastor.
[1:21:06] I said I'm not a pastor. I'm just a
[1:21:08] Christian
[1:21:10] and oh you are going to church
[1:21:13] and things like that. They started in
[1:21:14] his dock.
[1:21:17] He said, "I've been waiting for you."
[1:21:20] I said, "Oh, I'm here."
[1:21:23] Said, "But why are you going too far?
[1:21:29] Why your pastor? There are no churches."
[1:21:32] I said, "I told him they are there.
[1:21:36] But God has called us to serve him.
[1:21:40] That's why we are going there.
[1:21:44] said all right.
[1:21:46] So why we make it here?
[1:21:49] It's not because it is easy.
[1:21:52] Sometimes we have to spend all our
[1:21:54] living
[1:21:58] all your living
[1:22:01] to make it here
[1:22:04] because you know
[1:22:06] this is more than that money.
[1:22:10] I know many of you do that.
[1:22:13] It's not in vain.
[1:22:16] God will surely bless you.
[1:22:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand on our feet?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, something in my heart like a stream
[1:22:29] running down. It makes me feel so happy
[1:22:34] as happy heart can be.
[1:22:38] When I think of Jesus and what he has
[1:22:42] done for me, there is something
[1:22:45] more than God in my soul. There is
[1:22:50] something
[1:22:52] more than God.
[1:22:57] Something in my heart like a stream
[1:23:00] running down.
[1:23:02] It makes me feel so happy as happy heart
[1:23:07] can be.
[1:23:09] When I think of Jesus and what he has
[1:23:13] done for me, there is something
[1:23:17] more than God.
[1:23:23] Amen. Amen. First Peter chapter 2
[1:23:30] verse 9 to 12.
[1:23:34] It says,
[1:23:37] "But ye are a chosen generation,
[1:23:41] a royal priesthood,
[1:23:44] any holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[1:23:48] you should show forth the praises of him
[1:23:50] who has called you out of darkness into
[1:23:53] his marvelous light, which in time past
[1:23:56] were not a people, but are now the
[1:23:58] people of God,
[1:24:00] which had not obtained mercy, but now
[1:24:03] have obtained mercy. Dearly beloved, I
[1:24:06] beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims,
[1:24:09] abstain from fleshly lusts which war
[1:24:13] against the soul, having your
[1:24:15] conversation honesty among the Gentiles,
[1:24:18] that well, as they speak against you as
[1:24:21] evildoers, they may by your good works
[1:24:24] which they shall behold, glorify God in
[1:24:26] the day of visitation. Amen.
[1:24:30] Soch.
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:30] Amen. Amen. Let me take your seats,
[1:25:32] please.
[1:25:36] Shall we bow our heads in a word of
[1:25:37] prayer? Kind
[1:25:40] heavenly father
[1:25:42] we have read out of your word
[1:25:45] but you said it is given by inspiration.
[1:25:51] May your holy spirit take the word.
[1:25:54] Open the hearts of the people.
[1:25:57] Bless from me and my brother here.
[1:26:02] Bless us and all the entire congregation
[1:26:06] and add a blessing to your word.
[1:26:10] that we may all go back testifying.
[1:26:14] The Lord I thank you
[1:26:17] for what you have done
[1:26:19] in Jesus Christ name.
[1:26:22] Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you once again.
[1:26:36] God bless you once again.
[1:26:42] Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; As pilgrims and strangers,
[1:26:49] that's my subject.
[1:26:53] As pilgrims and strangers,
[1:26:58] the scripture says,
[1:27:01] "But you are a chosen generation.
[1:27:06] and
[1:27:08] a chosen generation,
[1:27:12] a royal priesthood.
[1:27:16] Ye are bru
[1:27:21] of us together.
[1:27:23] He says we are one generation
[1:27:26] and that's a chosen generation.
[1:27:29] And he says all of us together, we are a
[1:27:32] royal priesthood.
[1:27:34] We are an holy nation.
[1:27:37] Remember God told the children of
[1:27:38] Israel,
[1:27:40] "The kingdom of God shall be taken from
[1:27:42] you
[1:27:44] and be given to a nation
[1:27:47] bringing forth the fruits thereof.
[1:27:50] That nation you are." Then he says,
[1:27:54] "It's unholy nation.
[1:27:58] It doesn't matter. It's not about you.
[1:28:02] It's about God. He says you are unholy
[1:28:05] nation a vul
[1:28:09] that you should show forth the praises
[1:28:12] of him
[1:28:14] who has called you out of darkness into
[1:28:18] his marvelous light
[1:28:21] which in time passed
[1:28:24] were not a people but are now the people
[1:28:27] of God.
[1:28:29] does not say in time past you are a
[1:28:33] people of some other sort. He says you
[1:28:37] are not even a people at all
[1:28:41] because man without the spirit of God is
[1:28:45] just a beast. He says in time past you
[1:28:49] are not a people but now now are the
[1:28:53] people of God. God has a people and
[1:28:57] those people you are which had not
[1:29:01] obtained mercy.
[1:29:04] You had not obtained mercy you are
[1:29:08] regarded as Gentiles
[1:29:10] in the flesh but now I've obtained
[1:29:14] mercy.
[1:29:16] He says now, "Dear beloved,
[1:29:20] he's speaking to a people." Look, he
[1:29:24] first he talks about who they are.
[1:29:27] He declares to them who they are. Then
[1:29:30] he says, "Dearly beloved,
[1:29:33] dearly beloved,
[1:29:36] I beseech you.
[1:29:39] I beseech you, as strangers and
[1:29:42] pilgrims,
[1:29:44] Abstain
[1:29:47] from fleshly lust
[1:29:52] which war against the soul.
[1:29:56] There is a battle.
[1:29:58] There is a war and that's within you.
[1:30:03] Brother says this brother says that
[1:30:07] there is two dogs within me.
[1:30:11] They are fighting each other.
[1:30:13] One is dark, another one is white.
[1:30:16] One is evil, another one is good, which
[1:30:20] means
[1:30:21] the one you feed the most. He says there
[1:30:24] is war
[1:30:26] within you, the flesh against the soul,
[1:30:31] the lusts of the flesh against the soul.
[1:30:36] The flesh can't be saved.
[1:30:41] That's why he says flesh and blood
[1:30:45] not inherit the kingdom of God. Look
[1:30:49] brother, if God will make you an angel
[1:30:54] and on the outside
[1:30:57] still have this flesh, you will still
[1:30:59] remain a sinner.
[1:31:02] Look brother,
[1:31:04] it is about the change of the inner man.
[1:31:07] After the change of the inner man, the
[1:31:11] outward man will be consumed.
[1:31:16] If that spirit that was in Christ,
[1:31:20] it will quicken your mortal body.
[1:31:23] But for now, there is war within you,
[1:31:27] fighting within you.
[1:31:30] He says, I abstain
[1:31:34] from fleshly lust.
[1:31:39] Because the flesh
[1:31:41] was against the soul
[1:31:45] having your conversation honestly
[1:31:48] among the Gentiles.
[1:31:52] Sometimes you may think people are not
[1:31:55] seeing
[1:31:57] but they are saying
[1:31:59] I was surprised.
[1:32:02] This woman says
[1:32:06] I was surprised.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; I said all along she she said
[1:32:13] where do you fellowship from?
[1:32:16] I said days of the voice fellowship days
[1:32:18] of the voice fellowship. She said,
[1:32:22] "Where is it?" I said, "I'm
[1:32:27] going."
[1:32:29] I said, "Yes."
[1:32:35] Then she said, "This is the only person
[1:32:41] that I've ever seen and admired."
[1:32:45] You know what I felt? I felt ashamed of
[1:32:51] to God.
[1:32:53] I said, "God, me a sinner
[1:32:59] with all weaknesses."
[1:33:02] You hear what this woman is saying?
[1:33:04] Look, brother,
[1:33:06] this little light of mine,
[1:33:10] it's light
[1:33:12] in darkness.
[1:33:14] Hallelujah.
[1:33:16] She was a Muslim brother.
[1:33:19] And I was shocked because she wasn't my
[1:33:22] friend. She was far above me in
[1:33:25] position.
[1:33:29] What am I saying? These people are
[1:33:32] watching you even without your words. So
[1:33:36] he says, "Having your conversation
[1:33:38] honest
[1:33:40] among the Gentiles
[1:33:42] that they speak against you
[1:33:46] as evildoers,
[1:33:49] They may by your good works
[1:33:52] which they shall behold
[1:33:55] glorify God
[1:33:57] in the day of visitation
[1:34:00] surely
[1:34:02] that was a Christian
[1:34:07] brother sister.
[1:34:10] He says not only beloved
[1:34:13] but dearly beloved.
[1:34:18] So dearly beloved,
[1:34:21] he says I beseech you.
[1:34:24] I beg you. I encourage you. I strengthen
[1:34:29] you. I comfort you as a pilgrims and
[1:34:33] strength.
[1:34:37] A stranger
[1:34:39] is one who comes from a foreign country
[1:34:44] into a country or city
[1:34:47] or a land to live there
[1:34:51] temporarily
[1:34:54] amidst the the natives of the land.
[1:34:58] He is there temporarily
[1:35:01] and he is recognized
[1:35:05] separated.
[1:35:07] by his character
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:14] is known
[1:35:16] separated from the net
[1:35:19] by his character.
[1:35:22] This one is different. It doesn't act
[1:35:25] like a Uganda. His character is
[1:35:28] different.
[1:35:30] Brother is separated,
[1:35:33] by his characture,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; by his language,
[1:35:37] [Music]
[1:35:39] by the manner of life that he lives,
[1:35:45] by his or her addressing
[1:35:49] the you know you dress
[1:35:52] the way you want to be addressed.
[1:35:57] So the way you dress
[1:36:00] shows who you are. He says, "Oh, I'm
[1:36:03] saying that a pilgrim, a stranger
[1:36:09] is separated by the man of life they
[1:36:12] live,
[1:36:15] separated by their dress code.
[1:36:18] They are separated by what they eat."
[1:36:23] True, brother.
[1:36:25] You can't go to a strange country
[1:36:28] and you just start to eat what they eat
[1:36:30] all over.
[1:36:32] No, you will first look for the food you
[1:36:33] are used to.
[1:36:35] They separated by what they eat
[1:36:41] and by their behavior.
[1:36:45] Then when they see such a one
[1:36:48] this guy, this brother, this man, this
[1:36:51] woman,
[1:36:54] their cultures are different from ours.
[1:36:58] Their language is different from our
[1:37:01] man of life they live is different from
[1:37:03] ours.
[1:37:05] The way they dress is different from
[1:37:07] ours.
[1:37:08] What they eat is different from ours.
[1:37:11] Their behaviors are different.
[1:37:14] This is a stranger.
[1:37:17] You can't hide it brother because you
[1:37:19] are different.
[1:37:21] Then they say this one is different.
[1:37:25] But the moment
[1:37:29] the moment
[1:37:31] the moment he or she
[1:37:35] adopts to the characters of that
[1:37:37] friendship.
[1:37:43] Aha. And they adopt to eat and learn it
[1:37:46] and live do exactly
[1:37:50] that
[1:37:54] and and they adopt the language
[1:37:58] and the man of life
[1:38:01] and the dressing
[1:38:03] and the way the people behave.
[1:38:07] They cease to be a stranger.
[1:38:11] No one will recognize them as a stranger
[1:38:14] because they are just the same as the
[1:38:16] native.
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:19] They become one like the natives of the
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:24] so they are no longer strange.
[1:38:27] Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[1:38:30] pilgrims and strangers.
[1:38:33] He says pilgrims and strangers you are.
[1:38:39] Therefore remain
[1:38:42] Brother, the Lord,
[1:38:46] the Lord lived in Sodom.
[1:38:50] He was a petty.
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:53] He was purposed in his heart.
[1:38:57] There was something kind of different.
[1:39:01] I know he didn't have much of
[1:39:03] revelation,
[1:39:05] but there was something different
[1:39:07] that differentiated him.
[1:39:10] from the sodomite.
[1:39:12] Look brother Genesis 19 1-9 says
[1:39:20] it says here
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:24] and there came two angels to Sodom at
[1:39:27] evening.
[1:39:30] Lot sat in the gate of Sodom.
[1:39:34] And Lot seeing them rose up to meet them
[1:39:38] and he bowed himself with his face
[1:39:40] towards the ground.
[1:39:42] And he said, "Behold now my Lord,
[1:39:46] turn in I pray you into your servant's
[1:39:49] house
[1:39:51] and all night
[1:39:54] and wash your feet."
[1:39:56] It says two angels.
[1:39:58] Remember the the Lord
[1:40:01] had remained with Abraham.
[1:40:03] To Abraham they were three
[1:40:06] and Abraham said, "My Lord is so one and
[1:40:11] not they come two.
[1:40:14] These were loss
[1:40:16] standing. I pray you eat your servants
[1:40:18] house and all night wash your feet and
[1:40:23] you shall rise up early. Go on your
[1:40:26] way." They said,
[1:40:30] But we will abide in the street.
[1:40:32] And he pressed upon them.
[1:40:35] They turned in unto him.
[1:40:38] Normally when someone tells me,
[1:40:42] will you eat?
[1:40:44] I tell them, no.
[1:40:47] But when they come to me, I
[1:40:52] know we are serving you. Here is your
[1:40:54] food. I don't move.
[1:40:58] But when they say will you eat
[1:41:01] I said no I'm really well
[1:41:06] I won't tell you the reason
[1:41:09] but the the reason it being that they
[1:41:12] asked me
[1:41:16] whether I will eat
[1:41:19] I presume
[1:41:21] it was not planned
[1:41:25] I do not want to interfere.
[1:41:29] Will you do this?
[1:41:32] I always say no. But it's just
[1:41:36] my mother taught me that.
[1:41:40] But I find it so true.
[1:41:43] If I should I give you? No. I said no.
[1:41:48] It's good to always just give.
[1:41:51] If God put someone on your heart,
[1:41:54] you text them and say, "Brother, sister,
[1:41:57] are you okay? What what
[1:42:00] they tell you, I'm okay.
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:03] This this is God. That was not God.
[1:42:12] No, just sin.
[1:42:18] Just give
[1:42:21] Then they will tell you, "Oh brother,
[1:42:24] you know what? I was really
[1:42:28] I was in a fixed
[1:42:32] but you start to ask
[1:42:35] you are not willing."
[1:42:38] It says he pressed upon them.
[1:42:44] don't go
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; because he loved to eat
[1:42:48] turned unto him and entered into his
[1:42:51] house. He made them a feast and he did
[1:42:55] break bread
[1:42:57] and they did eat. But
[1:43:01] they were not willing to start fasting.
[1:43:06] But before they lay down,
[1:43:09] the men of the city, even the men of
[1:43:10] Sodom, compass
[1:43:12] compassed the house
[1:43:15] around both old and young
[1:43:18] all the people from every quarter.
[1:43:23] These people are the same.
[1:43:25] All of them old and young from every
[1:43:27] quarter.
[1:43:30] He called unto Lot and said unto him,
[1:43:33] "Were the men which came into the earth,
[1:43:38] bring them unto us that them,
[1:43:42] Lord went out at the door unto them and
[1:43:45] shut the door after him and said, I pray
[1:43:49] you, brethren,
[1:43:51] do not sow wickedly.
[1:43:53] Behold, now I have two daughters which
[1:43:56] have not known man. Let me I pray you
[1:43:59] bring them out unto you and do to them
[1:44:02] as is good in your eyes. Only to these
[1:44:05] men do nothing.
[1:44:07] For therefore came they under the shadow
[1:44:12] and they said
[1:44:14] stand back the bur. And they said again
[1:44:18] this pharaoh
[1:44:21] this one pharaoh
[1:44:24] This one pharaoh
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; came into
[1:44:32] came into
[1:44:39] and he will needs to be a judge.
[1:44:45] Now we will deal worse with thee
[1:44:51] with than than with them.
[1:44:55] And they pressed saw upon the man
[1:44:59] even Lord and came near to break the
[1:45:02] door.
[1:45:03] Look the Bible says this one fellow came
[1:45:06] into.
[1:45:10] He came he was just a sjanna
[1:45:14] but he landed in sodom.
[1:45:17] But we see
[1:45:19] is way of behavior
[1:45:23] brother. It was different
[1:45:25] from the natives of sodomy.
[1:45:29] It was recognizable
[1:45:31] that he was just a saranic
[1:45:34] to the extent that Peter said in second
[1:45:40] Peter 26.
[1:45:43] It says
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; and turning the cities of Sodom and
[1:45:46] Gomorrah
[1:45:48] into ashes
[1:45:53] condemned them with an overthrow
[1:45:57] making them an example unto those that
[1:46:00] after should live ungodly.
[1:46:13] and delivered just Lord
[1:46:17] vexed with a filthy conversation of the
[1:46:20] wicked.
[1:46:25] Lot was so vexed.
[1:46:29] says, "For that righteous man,
[1:46:33] dwelling among them
[1:46:36] dwelling among them
[1:46:40] in seeing and hearing
[1:46:44] vex his righteous soul
[1:46:48] from day to day with their unlawful
[1:46:52] deeds.
[1:46:57] If sin no longer grieves you,
[1:47:02] you are under sin.
[1:47:07] He was so vexed
[1:47:10] in his righteous soul.
[1:47:14] But he says in his righteous soul.
[1:47:19] If there is any righteousness in your
[1:47:21] soul,
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:26] Sin will make you grieve. It will relax
[1:47:29] your soul.
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister,
[1:47:35] it really doesn't matter
[1:47:38] where you go, where you are or where you
[1:47:42] live, whatever it might be, how far you
[1:47:46] are you are from the church,
[1:47:51] God still wants to use you.
[1:47:55] for a testimony
[1:47:58] that surely there is a power in the
[1:48:01] blood of the lamb
[1:48:04] in the message
[1:48:06] the beginning and ending of the gentile
[1:48:08] dispensation
[1:48:12] paragraph 30 the prophet says now we
[1:48:16] find out
[1:48:18] that Daniel
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; became an instrument
[1:48:23] in the hand of God
[1:48:26] while he was away from his own people
[1:48:31] out of his own city,
[1:48:34] away from his own church
[1:48:37] in a strange land. God used him.
[1:48:44] There are people
[1:48:46] brother
[1:48:48] that God can't let you lose
[1:48:52] because you are going to go astray.
[1:48:57] The moment he lets you loose,
[1:49:00] you are going to go astray.
[1:49:03] But the prophet says sometimes God lets
[1:49:08] you lose
[1:49:09] to see who you are.
[1:49:15] He lets you loose. You know when you
[1:49:18] have just come to Christ,
[1:49:21] God holds you in such a way that
[1:49:25] brother, you are just like over walking
[1:49:27] in the air. You don't understand.
[1:49:30] You are just floating through.
[1:49:34] And there is comes a time
[1:49:36] he lets you lose and if you go back
[1:49:41] then that's who you are brother
[1:49:48] until you are subjected to a test
[1:49:52] says in a message I believe the god of
[1:49:56] the evil age it has come to a time but
[1:50:00] it is hard for a Christian
[1:50:03] get out of the house
[1:50:07] because all they are going to see
[1:50:10] is a filth.
[1:50:12] But unless you are you go out,
[1:50:17] you won't know whether you're Christian
[1:50:18] or not.
[1:50:21] If you can stand in the midst of
[1:50:24] wickedness
[1:50:26] and hold the testimony of the Lord
[1:50:28] Jesus, our application,
[1:50:32] he says, God used him
[1:50:36] out of his own city
[1:50:39] in in in a strange land
[1:50:41] away from his own church.
[1:50:49] Now you can be away from whatever you
[1:50:51] may be.
[1:50:54] You can be away from all your loved ones
[1:50:58] or you can be away from your church.
[1:51:02] But you can still be
[1:51:06] an instrument
[1:51:08] hands of God.
[1:51:11] God can use you for testimony
[1:51:15] or anything.
[1:51:17] that he wishes to you
[1:51:22] brother
[1:51:24] that's as real as real can be
[1:51:29] God has not called you to be a Christian
[1:51:32] here
[1:51:34] no brother he has called you to be a
[1:51:37] Christian out here
[1:51:40] a Christian at home a Christian as a
[1:51:43] husband a Christian wife a worker.
[1:51:48] Whatever it might be, God wants you to
[1:51:51] be a Christian,
[1:51:54] anywhere, any place.
[1:51:56] Look, brother,
[1:52:00] he was an instrument
[1:52:03] in the hand of God.
[1:52:08] A pilgrim
[1:52:11] is a stranger
[1:52:14] passing through a certain foreign land.
[1:52:19] He or she is on the move.
[1:52:25] He is on the move.
[1:52:28] He isn't yet where he is going
[1:52:33] and but he isn't where he started.
[1:52:41] is just on the move.
[1:52:44] You may not be where you out to be.
[1:52:49] I know you know where you want to be.
[1:52:53] You are not yet what you want to be
[1:52:57] and you are not what you ought to be
[1:53:01] but you are not what you used to be.
[1:53:04] You are on the journey progressing
[1:53:07] daily.
[1:53:09] Step one step at a time.
[1:53:13] Not turning back.
[1:53:15] Daily progressing
[1:53:17] towards that final destiny.
[1:53:22] Look brother,
[1:53:24] show me a man that will stand
[1:53:29] and say, "I'm now adopted.
[1:53:33] Yesterday
[1:53:35] I was adopted.
[1:53:40] Have you had any money?
[1:53:44] Come and say
[1:53:46] you will come and say brother yesterday
[1:53:50] at 2 a.m.
[1:53:53] I received the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:55] Spirit.
[1:53:58] But not even Paul,
[1:54:00] not even Peter stood and said yesterday
[1:54:05] I was adopted
[1:54:08] because an adopted son or daughter of
[1:54:11] God
[1:54:14] always
[1:54:15] is seeking for higher things.
[1:54:19] If you are adopted, you are known like
[1:54:21] that. Remember he says that not as
[1:54:26] though I had attained.
[1:54:29] A thou already perfect
[1:54:32] but I follow after
[1:54:34] if that I may apprehend
[1:54:37] that for which also I am apprehended of
[1:54:39] Christ.
[1:54:43] He says, "Brethren, I count not myself
[1:54:46] to have apprehended,
[1:54:50] but this one thing I do,
[1:54:53] this one thing I do,
[1:54:56] forgetting those things which are
[1:54:57] before,
[1:54:59] reaching forth unto the things which are
[1:55:01] before,
[1:55:03] I press toward the mark of the price,
[1:55:06] the calling of God."
[1:55:10] Brothers and sisters, there is no lower
[1:55:13] calling,
[1:55:16] each one of us that has been called has
[1:55:20] been called for a higher calling
[1:55:25] in Christ Jesus.
[1:55:27] Let us therefore
[1:55:30] as many as be perfect,
[1:55:33] as many as be adopted,
[1:55:36] be thus minded.
[1:55:44] You come from somewhere.
[1:55:47] You are going somewhere.
[1:55:49] You if you're pilgrim and a stranger,
[1:55:53] you know where you came from.
[1:55:59] You are not walking aimlessly.
[1:56:04] You are not walking without a purpose.
[1:56:09] You don't do things just to do things.
[1:56:14] You do things for a divine purpose.
[1:56:18] Knowing this one thing, you are just a
[1:56:21] man, but a man with a divine commission.
[1:56:28] So you are not walking aimless,
[1:56:31] but you walk and live with purpose.
[1:56:35] You are striving.
[1:56:38] not to entangle yourself
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; with the fallen things of the land
[1:56:44] that you are passing through.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; A pilgrim is always sriving
[1:56:53] fighting day after day, not to become a
[1:56:57] part of the things of the land
[1:57:00] that they are passing through.
[1:57:03] This world is not my home.
[1:57:06] I'm just passing through
[1:57:09] my treasures up above in heaven.
[1:57:12] Brother, sister, he says, for where your
[1:57:14] treasure is, there shall your heart be.
[1:57:18] He says, store up there for treasures in
[1:57:21] heaven, you are a pilgrim.
[1:57:25] Look brother
[1:57:28] in Deuteronomy chapter 12
[1:57:31] the Bible says
[1:57:35] verse 29-32
[1:57:39] when the Lord thy God shall cut off the
[1:57:41] nations from before thee
[1:57:44] whether thou goest to possess them and
[1:57:48] thou succeed them and dwellest in their
[1:57:56] Verse 29.
[1:58:12] Take heed to thy soul
[1:58:15] that thou be not snared by the by
[1:58:17] following them
[1:58:21] after that they be destroyed from before
[1:58:24] thee
[1:58:28] that thou and that thou inquire not
[1:58:30] after their gods
[1:58:35] saying
[1:58:37] how did these nations
[1:58:40] serve their gods.
[1:58:44] Even so will I do likewise,
[1:58:48] thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy
[1:58:52] God.
[1:58:54] For every abomination to the Lord,
[1:58:58] which he
[1:59:01] have they done unto their gods,
[1:59:05] for even their sons and their daughters,
[1:59:09] burnt in the fire to their gods,
[1:59:13] what thingsoever I command you,
[1:59:16] observe to do it,
[1:59:20] thou shalt not add there
[1:59:23] in order diminish from
[1:59:28] God was giving them an instruction
[1:59:31] and telling them look brother you look
[1:59:34] here children you are pilgrims and
[1:59:36] strangers
[1:59:39] therefore after you have possessed the
[1:59:42] land
[1:59:44] don't behave like genetics
[1:59:49] a pilgrim and a stranger
[1:59:52] He is under instruction.
[1:59:55] There is something within them
[1:59:58] calling for home.
[2:00:01] There is a voice brother that speaks
[2:00:05] unto them. He says stand this way. Turn
[2:00:08] that way. Turn that way. There still
[2:00:12] voice of God.
[2:00:15] came within.
[2:00:17] God demanded them.
[2:00:21] You know, each one of us
[2:00:25] the the the voice of God always is
[2:00:27] speaking.
[2:00:29] Turn this way, turn that way, turn this
[2:00:33] way. But there's a lot that we are
[2:00:37] listening to
[2:00:39] uncertain sounds
[2:00:43] that cover the voice of God.
[2:00:53] God demanded them to remain separated
[2:00:58] because they were pilgrims and saints.
[2:01:02] They had a different food.
[2:01:05] It was mana from heaven.
[2:01:08] They had different water.
[2:01:11] It was water from the rock. They had a
[2:01:15] different leadership.
[2:01:17] The pill of fire and the pill of the
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:23] proved that they were pilgrims and
[2:01:26] strangers.
[2:01:28] They had a unique God
[2:01:31] of
[2:01:33] unique ways.
[2:01:37] And that's exactly who we are.
[2:01:40] We have a different leaders,
[2:01:43] the pill of fire, the spirit of Christ.
[2:01:47] We have a different water, the waters of
[2:01:50] the spirit.
[2:01:52] Lord, we have a different food. The word
[2:01:56] of God.
[2:01:58] Therefore, we have a unique God
[2:02:02] of unique ways.
[2:02:08] We can't serve God
[2:02:11] the way the rest of them serve him.
[2:02:14] He says serve God with reverence and
[2:02:18] godly fear.
[2:02:20] Then he says, "Serve God in a way that's
[2:02:24] acceptable.
[2:02:28] God is a spirit. They that worship him
[2:02:32] must worship him
[2:02:34] and truth.
[2:02:36] Brother, we can't serve God
[2:02:40] in a religious way. We can't serve God
[2:02:44] in a denominational way. We can't serve
[2:02:47] God.
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:52] We can't serve God like the way the rest
[2:02:55] of them are doing.
[2:02:57] We serve God
[2:02:59] wisdom with the knowledge of the truth.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm serving.
[2:03:11] I'm doing all I can. I'm doing all I
[2:03:14] can. Going here, going there, going
[2:03:17] here, going there. preaching, preaching
[2:03:19] here, doing this thing. But are you
[2:03:23] doing it right,
[2:03:27] brother sister? It's not about what you
[2:03:29] do.
[2:03:31] Not how sincere you are.
[2:03:34] No. No. No. No. Not how sincere you are.
[2:03:38] Is it acceptable?
[2:03:42] And is God pleased?
[2:03:46] Look brother, you may not do much. You
[2:03:49] may have too much. You may be so
[2:03:51] righteous in yourself.
[2:03:54] But having done all,
[2:03:57] ask yourself, is God pleased?
[2:04:02] Look, brother, before
[2:04:05] was translated,
[2:04:07] had a testimony
[2:04:09] that he had pleased the Lord.
[2:04:13] And we have this confidence that
[2:04:16] whatever we ask of the Lord, we receive
[2:04:20] because we do those things that are
[2:04:22] pleasing.
[2:04:26] There is no rupture
[2:04:29] unless you please the Lord.
[2:04:33] He had this testimony.
[2:04:37] He was a pilgrim and a stranger.
[2:04:41] Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; We sing the song.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary,
[2:04:51] pure and holy,
[2:04:54] right and true
[2:04:57] with all thanksgiving.
[2:04:59] I'll be a living sanctuary.
[2:05:04] It says
[2:05:06] in 2 Corinthians 6
[2:05:10] 14, be not equally together with
[2:05:12] unbelievers.
[2:05:16] What fellowship as righteousness with
[2:05:18] unrighteousness?
[2:05:21] What communion as light with darkness?
[2:05:26] What concord as Christ with burial?
[2:05:30] Or what part that believes with an
[2:05:38] And what agreement has the temple of God
[2:05:40] with idols?
[2:05:44] For you are the temple of the living
[2:05:45] God.
[2:05:47] As God has said, I will dwell in them.
[2:05:52] I will walk in them
[2:05:55] and will be in the will be their God.
[2:05:58] They shall be my people.
[2:06:02] Wherefore come out from among them, and
[2:06:05] be ye separate,
[2:06:07] say the Lord, touch not the unclean
[2:06:10] thing,
[2:06:12] and I will receive you, and you will be
[2:06:15] a father unto you. You shall be my son,
[2:06:19] says the Lord Almighty.
[2:06:23] Brother, sister,
[2:06:26] it's a daily fight.
[2:06:29] is day by day dying to yourself to your
[2:06:33] desire to your thinking to your will to
[2:06:38] do the will of God
[2:06:41] the life of Christ a life worthy of the
[2:06:44] gospel
[2:06:47] brother
[2:06:51] it says Revelation 18 1-5
[2:06:56] after these things I saw another angel
[2:06:58] coming
[2:07:01] having great power.
[2:07:04] And the earth was lightened with his
[2:07:06] glory.
[2:07:09] And he cried mighty
[2:07:11] with a strong voice, saying,
[2:07:15] Babylon the great is fallen,
[2:07:18] is fallen, and is become the habitation
[2:07:22] of death
[2:07:25] and hold of every foul spirit.
[2:07:30] and a cage of every unclean and hatful
[2:07:33] body.
[2:07:37] For all nations
[2:07:40] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[2:07:42] our fornication
[2:07:45] and the kings of the earth
[2:07:48] have committed fornication with her. And
[2:07:51] the merchants of the earth
[2:07:54] are waxed rich through the abundance of
[2:08:00] And I heard another voice from heaven
[2:08:04] saying, "Come out of her my people.
[2:08:09] There is a judgment has been passed
[2:08:13] by an angel from heaven." Then there is
[2:08:16] another voice from heaven. It says,
[2:08:18] "Before judgment, sit right,
[2:08:21] come out of our seat
[2:08:24] that you be not partakers of
[2:08:27] and he received not of her bless
[2:08:32] sister.
[2:08:34] That's the kind of people that we are
[2:08:38] called
[2:08:40] out
[2:08:42] and separated
[2:08:48] pilgrims and strangers
[2:08:52] together with Christ.
[2:08:56] The world is falling.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Religions are falling
[2:09:01] and we are not of this world.
[2:09:04] We are pilgrims and strangers.
[2:09:07] We are not a denomination.
[2:09:10] We are Christians.
[2:09:12] We have one language,
[2:09:14] the Bible language, the word of God. We
[2:09:19] have one culture,
[2:09:21] the heavenly culture.
[2:09:23] We have one nature,
[2:09:26] which is of Christ. We have one leader,
[2:09:30] the Holy Ghost. We have no love but
[2:09:33] love. We have no
[2:09:36] but Christ. We have no book but the
[2:09:40] Bible. We are not membership here. We
[2:09:43] have no membership here but fellowship
[2:09:47] because we are pilgrim
[2:09:49] taking a city to God.
[2:09:51] Our spirit is different.
[2:09:55] The test of this world
[2:09:58] is rotteness with voodoo to our soul
[2:10:03] because we have a different spirit.
[2:10:07] We have the spirit of Christ
[2:10:11] and the Bible says that here we have no
[2:10:15] continuing
[2:10:18] but we seek one to come.
[2:10:22] Christ himself
[2:10:25] suffered without the gate.
[2:10:28] Therefore, let us go to him
[2:10:30] without reproach.
[2:10:33] Bearing his reproach,
[2:10:36] let us go to him, bearing his reproach.
[2:10:41] For here we have no continuity,
[2:10:45] but we seek.
[2:10:48] Look brother, the things of this world
[2:10:52] are going to be shaken and moved.
[2:10:59] They are going to pass away.
[2:11:01] All of them will be shaken.
[2:11:04] The Bible says, but that which can't be
[2:11:07] shaken
[2:11:09] shall remain.
[2:11:11] And we receive a kingdom
[2:11:14] that can't be shaken.
[2:11:16] Therefore, as Christ can't be shaken
[2:11:21] shone
[2:11:26] of my beast,
[2:11:28] I'm not of this world. Say no.
[2:11:31] Hallelujah. Whether peace,
[2:11:34] the world is passing away. Whether chaos
[2:11:38] the world is passing, whether unity, it
[2:11:42] is still passing,
[2:11:45] we are not of this world.
[2:11:47] We are seeking a city to God whose make
[2:11:51] and build is God.
[2:11:53] Therefore, we are pilgrims and
[2:11:57] something in me is longing for
[2:12:03] I want to go.
[2:12:05] I'm longing for home. I want to be where
[2:12:10] fellowship brother. I want to go there
[2:12:14] where Jesus is the light. It shall be
[2:12:16] one day without a night there. No
[2:12:20] sorrow, no weeping,
[2:12:23] no fears, no sickness,
[2:12:25] no death. There brother
[2:12:28] that time.
[2:12:30] Until that time, we are pilgrims and
[2:12:33] strangers.
[2:12:36] Brother, nothing here will continue.
[2:12:41] No, no, nothing.
[2:12:44] You come here on the earth. You come
[2:12:47] naked.
[2:12:50] Naked came out of my
[2:12:55] naked shall I return
[2:12:58] but with your character.
[2:13:01] You are going to go with what you did,
[2:13:03] brother.
[2:13:05] Therefore make right
[2:13:08] when there is a still time
[2:13:10] is now rest is now and therefore in the
[2:13:15] fear of God until that time now you can
[2:13:21] make it better.
[2:13:25] The time is now and time is no more. We
[2:13:29] have lived on the earth until we have
[2:13:33] forgotten that we are soon moving.
[2:13:37] Look brother.
[2:13:38] time now the church of Christ that the
[2:13:42] bride of Christ gets to a point whereby
[2:13:47] we stand and say I pledge allegiance to
[2:13:51] the Lord
[2:13:53] with all my soul and with all that I am
[2:13:57] I will seek to honor
[2:13:59] command I pledge allegiance unto the
[2:14:03] lamb of God
[2:14:07] I pledge alleg
[2:14:09] to the lamb of God.
[2:14:11] Brother, sister, the world is passing
[2:14:14] away.
[2:14:16] Politics is passing away. Education is
[2:14:19] passing away.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; We need all these things,
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; but it's not what we need the most.
[2:14:34] It is all passing away.
[2:14:36] If it won't do me any good, help me to
[2:14:40] serve the Lord.
[2:14:45] If they want to help me to serve God,
[2:14:48] I don't need them. Why? Because I know
[2:14:54] I'm just a pilgrim.
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:14:58] Look, brother, marriages
[2:15:01] will pass away. It is for the earth,
[2:15:04] brother.
[2:15:05] is not eternal.
[2:15:08] It will go.
[2:15:11] You have got to understand. If God gives
[2:15:14] it to you, it just has got to serve a
[2:15:16] heavenly purpose.
[2:15:19] If not, then it is of no good
[2:15:23] all the foods.
[2:15:25] It is a pleasure to eat
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; but it will pass away and to the
[2:15:30] heavenly
[2:15:32] to get the heavenly
[2:15:36] all these foods of the world
[2:15:39] because they are for this body
[2:15:42] they will pass away. But I read in the
[2:15:45] scripture I read in the scripture.
[2:15:49] I read in the scripture
[2:15:51] that men ate angels food.
[2:15:54] [Music]
[2:15:57] Angels food.
[2:15:59] Men ate angels. There is food in heaven.
[2:16:02] Brother.
[2:16:04] Ah. You don't believe it. I believe it.
[2:16:08] Because men ate angels food.
[2:16:12] Physically they ate it
[2:16:15] and spiritual it is the word
[2:16:17] but physically
[2:16:21] there is a supper brother
[2:16:23] and there is eating and drinking.
[2:16:27] Oh brother nothing here will continue.
[2:16:32] It will all give away to something
[2:16:35] that's eternal.
[2:16:37] This immortality
[2:16:43] will give out to immortality.
[2:16:48] Nothing here
[2:16:50] can sustain a believer
[2:16:54] completeness
[2:16:56] and satisfaction.
[2:16:59] There is nothing on the earth
[2:17:02] that can make me desire
[2:17:05] to stay here
[2:17:07] today.
[2:17:12] Listen brother, even if I engage today,
[2:17:18] I engage today
[2:17:21] to stay at the next.
[2:17:23] If it is the rapture,
[2:17:26] let it come. Brother, it is better.
[2:17:29] But look brother,
[2:17:31] [Music]
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; there is nothing here.
[2:17:38] I mean it from my heart. There is
[2:17:41] nothing here can make me to desire.
[2:17:47] next day
[2:17:51] I'm only here because God is purpose
[2:17:57] my coming here is not yet fully no is
[2:18:02] not yet fully
[2:18:04] fulfilled
[2:18:13] surely but there is nothing here
[2:18:17] that can stop you
[2:18:20] from serving God. There is nothing
[2:18:24] should hold you back. There is nothing
[2:18:27] between me and my savior.
[2:18:30] Take the blood of Jesus. Take the blood
[2:18:33] of Jesus and put a full stop
[2:18:37] all your bondages.
[2:18:39] Look brother, if I live a holy life,
[2:18:43] shine the wrong and do right, I know
[2:18:46] myself there will make a way.
[2:18:48] Not only for the things of the world,
[2:18:51] you will make me aware for me to go out
[2:18:54] of this earth. There is no sin should
[2:18:58] overtake you. There is no sin should
[2:19:02] overtake you. There is no man should
[2:19:05] hold you into their obedience
[2:19:09] if they contrary to the Bible.
[2:19:16] No brother, you are no more slaves to
[2:19:18] it.
[2:19:20] So do not go for it.
[2:19:23] Look, sin is pleasurable.
[2:19:26] In the beginning, it is such a pleasure.
[2:19:29] It will make you feel that you are on
[2:19:31] high in heaven.
[2:19:34] But you down there below
[2:19:38] it will sting you
[2:19:41] an immoral woman.
[2:19:43] The Bible says her is sweet and
[2:19:48] slippery.
[2:19:49] But in the end
[2:19:52] she will sting like an
[2:19:55] why
[2:19:57] is the way to hell.
[2:20:00] Look brother, don't turn your eyes to
[2:20:02] that. Keep your eyes on Jesus
[2:20:06] upon the word of God. I understand I
[2:20:09] understand that the temptations today
[2:20:13] are far more than what our fathers
[2:20:14] receive
[2:20:16] than what brother received than what the
[2:20:19] apostles went through.
[2:20:22] He gives you grace sufficient for the
[2:20:25] time.
[2:20:27] When the enemy rises against you like
[2:20:31] the flood, God raises a stand. He raises
[2:20:35] a standard for a given age
[2:20:39] for the people of the age.
[2:20:42] There is no man, no woman is a standard.
[2:20:51] The people have a say
[2:20:54] I used to hear sisters say
[2:21:00] wife used to dress
[2:21:02] you mine also you see a picture
[2:21:10] is not the standard
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:14] but the spirit on you what does it tell
[2:21:16] you
[2:21:18] know brother Julia starts like
[2:21:22] does like this brother.
[2:21:28] The word is the standard.
[2:21:31] Do what the word is saying.
[2:21:33] Oh brother, that's the standard.
[2:21:37] The word
[2:21:39] stand the test of Jes
[2:21:46] and prove it. is victorious
[2:21:50] brother that God is worthy
[2:21:57] anywhere any place any time and all
[2:22:01] conditions and circumstances
[2:22:05] take the word of God
[2:22:08] the sword of the spirit
[2:22:11] oh brother it says be sober be vigilant
[2:22:18] Because you devil
[2:22:22] moves around like a rolling.
[2:22:25] It's so sad. We forget brother
[2:22:29] fighting a spiritual battle.
[2:22:31] Yes sir.
[2:22:35] You say brother I fall.
[2:22:38] I to fall many times but I rise brother.
[2:22:42] Said brother I feel I can't go anymore.
[2:22:46] I come to those moments too.
[2:22:49] You say, "Brother, I don't feel like
[2:22:51] saved.
[2:22:53] I don't feel like I'm saved."
[2:22:56] The prophet says, "I'm not saved."
[2:23:00] Because I feel I'm saved
[2:23:03] because a lot of time
[2:23:06] I don't feel that way.
[2:23:10] But I'm saved because I did what God
[2:23:13] said to do.
[2:23:16] That's all. That's all
[2:23:20] that I have hope and faith in it.
[2:23:23] I don't feel it. Sometimes
[2:23:26] sometimes I feel I'm a rich brother.
[2:23:29] Sometimes I feel I need serving God
[2:23:32] and other times I feel I'm a brother.
[2:23:35] I'm a god or not. Other times I'm cast
[2:23:38] it out. and I rise. And I say it's my
[2:23:43] faith.
[2:23:44] It's my faith. I fulfilled the word.
[2:23:49] I did what he said to do.
[2:23:52] Look, brother,
[2:23:54] sin
[2:23:59] will sting you
[2:24:03] and rob you
[2:24:06] of all your confidence.
[2:24:10] as a son or daughter of God,
[2:24:14] it will take it away.
[2:24:18] You remain a son and daughter of God,
[2:24:22] but it will sin robs you the confidence.
[2:24:30] It is so attractive.
[2:24:34] It looks so nice,
[2:24:36] so beautiful.
[2:24:39] But on the inside,
[2:24:43] it's all packaged with hair.
[2:24:46] [Music]
[2:24:47] It will dry your spirit,
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:52] silence your testimony.
[2:24:57] When it gets inside,
[2:25:00] it will start eating
[2:25:03] and eating.
[2:25:06] It will be eating.
[2:25:08] Look here
[2:25:10] 137
[2:25:12] by the rivers of Babylon.
[2:25:16] There we sat down.
[2:25:19] Yeah, we wept. When we remember desired,
[2:25:23] when we remembered our testimony,
[2:25:26] but now in captivity
[2:25:28] because of their sin, he says, "Yeah, we
[2:25:31] sat down and wept."
[2:25:34] Look brother, we hanged our hops upon
[2:25:37] the willows
[2:25:40] in the midst thereof.
[2:25:41] [Music]
[2:25:43] For there they carried us our captive
[2:25:47] required of us a song
[2:25:50] and they that wasted us
[2:25:54] required us nothing
[2:25:58] saying sing us one of the songs of Zion.
[2:26:03] But how shall we sing the Lord's song in
[2:26:09] look brother they could no more
[2:26:13] stand and sing praises
[2:26:17] and worship the Lord and glorify the
[2:26:20] Lord because of captivity
[2:26:25] but sin let them touch
[2:26:28] by the rivers of Babylon
[2:26:31] by the rivers of sin
[2:26:33] They sat down and wept.
[2:26:38] Sin will put off the fire
[2:26:41] in the church, in your life, in your
[2:26:45] family. It will silence everything.
[2:26:49] It will cover everything.
[2:26:52] Brother, sister, sin will take you
[2:26:55] farther
[2:26:57] than you want to go.
[2:26:59] Sin will hold you too long
[2:27:02] than you want to stay.
[2:27:05] Sin will cost you more
[2:27:08] than you are willing to pay.
[2:27:10] Sin is cruel.
[2:27:14] If you put condemnation
[2:27:17] and guilt
[2:27:19] and makes you feel ashamed,
[2:27:24] brother,
[2:27:26] sin,
[2:27:28] flee
[2:27:29] all manner of evil.
[2:27:33] Sin takes away the joy of your soul.
[2:27:39] It creates a bad atmosphere
[2:27:43] around you.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; It's always there and someone comes to
[2:27:50] you.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[2:27:54] There's something about you
[2:27:57] that is attractive.
[2:28:00] It's a spirit of God, a right
[2:28:02] atmosphere.
[2:28:03] And when s comes in, it takes away that
[2:28:07] atmosphere.
[2:28:09] You start to behave in a certain way
[2:28:12] that you wouldn't want to
[2:28:16] be around you
[2:28:19] is
[2:28:20] it repel. It repels.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; This has no limit. It has no boundaries.
[2:28:33] It's not just similarity. This and it's
[2:28:35] it's all sin, brother.
[2:28:39] You get entangled in something
[2:28:42] that will makes you prisoner
[2:28:44] and we are able to see
[2:28:47] because the atmosphere around
[2:28:50] it comes too bad.
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; I always pray and ask God
[2:29:01] create around me
[2:29:04] a friendly atmosphere.
[2:29:07] [Music]
[2:29:10] Brother,
[2:29:13] sin eats your spiritual.
[2:29:19] Remember
[2:29:21] this
[2:29:23] whatever
[2:29:27] they come.
[2:29:29] This is sin, brother. It's a sin. It's a
[2:29:33] sin.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; It eats your faith.
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:37] It eats your virtue.
[2:29:42] It eats your knowledge.
[2:29:44] It takes away your temperance
[2:29:48] and you temper.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:51] It takes away your patience
[2:29:54] and you become so impatient.
[2:29:58] It takes away your godliness
[2:30:01] and ungodliness comes around you.
[2:30:05] It takes a brotherly kindness from you.
[2:30:10] You don't like brotherly.
[2:30:13] You don't like fellowship.
[2:30:15] It is a sin. It is a sin. It is a sin.
[2:30:20] Something around you
[2:30:23] and you not it
[2:30:27] in trouble.
[2:30:29] It is a sin.
[2:30:33] Work upon it. Work upon it.
[2:30:38] Don't think I'm like that. I'm like
[2:30:39] that.
[2:30:42] Christian is
[2:30:44] I'm like that. I'm like that.
[2:30:46] I don't know how you are. I don't agree.
[2:30:51] I don't agree. I don't agree. There is
[2:30:54] something wrong about you. An evil
[2:30:57] spirit surrounded you with the wrong
[2:31:01] atmosphere.
[2:31:04] You want to be indifferent.
[2:31:07] You want to make
[2:31:10] decisions here and there. This and that.
[2:31:14] Contrary and that
[2:31:17] something about you.
[2:31:20] Work upon it brother.
[2:31:22] It is your love.
[2:31:25] It is a sin. It's
[2:31:28] It hates it.
[2:31:31] It eats your prayer life.
[2:31:34] You can pray
[2:31:36] a sinning man who pray
[2:31:40] and a praying man will stop
[2:31:44] but sin eats that love.
[2:31:46] It eats it away. It takes it away. And
[2:31:51] when it comes in the church, brother, we
[2:31:53] don't want it.
[2:31:55] We don't want it.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; We don't want it. We don't want it. Walk
[2:32:01] upon it.
[2:32:03] God be merciful to me.
[2:32:06] Brother, the other part of it,
[2:32:09] the other part of sin,
[2:32:11] it's the consequences.
[2:32:14] The consequences of sin
[2:32:17] are far too hard than you can bear.
[2:32:23] Sin is forgivable.
[2:32:26] You can be forgiven.
[2:32:28] But the consequences
[2:32:32] will remain
[2:32:35] [Music]
[2:32:36] some remove all days of your life.
[2:32:41] Others for a time.
[2:32:48] M
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; And I know
[2:32:57] always comes last.
[2:33:00] God can take our sin.
[2:33:03] God can forgive you of sin.
[2:33:06] But the consequences
[2:33:09] he won't reverse.
[2:33:12] God won't abort your pregnancy
[2:33:16] because you fornicated.
[2:33:18] forgiveness
[2:33:22] because there is another principle
[2:33:25] the seed has to bring forth.
[2:33:30] I'm saying
[2:33:34] you can be forgiven
[2:33:36] but the consequences
[2:33:40] you may fight with them for a time
[2:33:45] sometimes all days of your life.
[2:33:52] We are called to live above all sin.
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:33:57] controls this world
[2:33:59] but we are not of this world
[2:34:03] was talking with his wife
[2:34:06] and she said
[2:34:08] honey
[2:34:10] we haven't seen any Christian woman
[2:34:18] why don't we dress like them also
[2:34:22] where we are all Americans
[2:34:26] And he said,
[2:34:31] "We are not of this world."
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; It's because for us we come from above.
[2:34:40] [Music]
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; That's why we are not like them.
[2:34:47] A deceived church by the world.
[2:34:51] But coming to a conclusion, he says,
[2:34:55] Paragraph 40.
[2:35:05] Uh,
[2:35:08] I want to read a quotation here.
[2:35:11] Amen.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; A man or woman. A man or a woman in
[2:35:15] Italy,
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; in France,
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; in Africa,
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; in any other nation
[2:35:28] that's ever born again of the Holy
[2:35:31] Ghost,
[2:35:34] don't do those things.
[2:35:39] Yes,
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; they won't wear those clothing.
[2:35:43] They won't act like that
[2:35:46] because they are of another
[2:35:50] whose ruler and maker is God.
[2:35:54] We are from heaven.
[2:35:56] The spirit that's within you motivates
[2:36:00] your life.
[2:36:06] If you are unamerican,
[2:36:08] you will do as the Americans do.
[2:36:12] If you are French, you will do as the
[2:36:15] French
[2:36:17] and criticize the other one.
[2:36:20] But if you are of God,
[2:36:23] you will do the way they do in heaven.
[2:36:27] Because your spirit comes from above, it
[2:36:31] controls you.
[2:36:33] A little something you might look at
[2:36:37] in the scripture. Those who sought this
[2:36:40] new city
[2:36:43] acted different. They professed that
[2:36:46] they were pilgrims and slaves.
[2:36:49] But on the side of
[2:36:51] they become fugitives and renegades.
[2:36:56] You know Christians were pilgrims and
[2:36:58] strangers.
[2:37:01] A fugitive has no home
[2:37:05] but a pilgrim.
[2:37:08] He says a fugitive has no home.
[2:37:11] A renegade is a horrible person
[2:37:15] but a pilgrim is something real
[2:37:20] and from a real land in another nation
[2:37:25] trying to find his way home.
[2:37:29] professing by his living
[2:37:34] that he has something
[2:37:37] that he is from another country.
[2:37:41] There is the reason
[2:37:45] brother. It's not that the world is
[2:37:48] wrong.
[2:37:51] No, the world has set its things
[2:37:58] in the exact way
[2:38:01] that's right and good for the world.
[2:38:04] [Music]
[2:38:11] The way they have prepared this world,
[2:38:14] this is how it is supposed to be because
[2:38:17] it is the world.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with it.
[2:38:21] But it is that why we condemn the world
[2:38:26] is and it all looks wrong
[2:38:30] because we are living in a wrong place.
[2:38:35] The world is not wrong. It's us in the
[2:38:38] wrong place brother
[2:38:40] because we are
[2:38:43] that is it.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; We are pilgrims and strangers.
[2:38:49] The world that's the world.
[2:38:53] We are in a wrong place.
[2:38:56] The world does look wrong.
[2:39:01] To us the world is wrong.
[2:39:05] And to us
[2:39:08] before to the world we are wrong.
[2:39:14] And when we look at the world we say
[2:39:16] they are wrong.
[2:39:18] They look at us, we say we you are
[2:39:21] wrong. We tell them the world is wrong.
[2:39:25] Is because it is a crash
[2:39:31] two nations.
[2:39:34] One from above, one from
[2:39:38] the spiritual.
[2:39:44] I just want to get a point to finish
[2:39:46] this.
[2:39:49] just a little bit.
[2:39:53] Paragraph 42 says
[2:40:01] here some time ago down in the south.
[2:40:13] The Germans or the Dutch brought over
[2:40:15] the Dutch colonies.
[2:40:20] brought over to American negroes out of
[2:40:22] African soil
[2:40:27] in the southern states for slaves.
[2:40:31] They became personal property to the
[2:40:33] slave owner.
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:38] They worked at the toils of the day
[2:40:43] and their scars over them from weeps.
[2:40:46] [Music]
[2:40:50] sometimes unkind masters
[2:40:53] and they were burdened and away from
[2:40:55] home.
[2:40:58] Many times they wouldn't want to work
[2:41:02] and they would make them and force them
[2:41:04] to work.
[2:41:07] And on a certain plantation there was a
[2:41:09] great owner who owned many
[2:41:15] two or 300 slaves on the great
[2:41:17] plantation.
[2:41:20] We would buy and swap slaves.
[2:41:29] And one day a buyer came and he said
[2:41:33] I would like to buy from you that
[2:41:35] certain
[2:41:38] said, "I have watched him.
[2:41:40] [Music]
[2:41:42] He walks straight.
[2:41:45] He never have to whip him.
[2:41:48] He's always willing and standing
[2:41:52] rather to do anything.
[2:41:54] He seems to be such a gallant person.
[2:41:59] Perhaps you made him the boss."
[2:42:04] He said, "No, he's just a slave. Maybe
[2:42:07] you feed him a little better."
[2:42:09] And what what makes him act different?
[2:42:13] Said, "No, it's with the rest of them.
[2:42:17] What makes him act different?"
[2:42:20] Here it is.
[2:42:23] No. I wondered myself what made him
[2:42:28] with his chin up,
[2:42:31] chest out, ready, ready any time.
[2:42:36] Never drop,
[2:42:39] never mopy
[2:42:43] that he is the son of the king.
[2:42:49] Though he is an alien,
[2:42:51] he is away from home
[2:42:54] still conducts himself.
[2:42:57] Knowing this that he's a son of the
[2:42:58] king,
[2:43:01] he keeps the morale of the rest of them.
[2:43:06] [Music]
[2:43:07] He keeps their morale high
[2:43:10] that ought to be a Christian.
[2:43:14] Brother, sister, they were persuaded of
[2:43:17] something.
[2:43:18] [Music]
[2:43:19] They were persuaded of something.
[2:43:22] They saw the promises.
[2:43:25] They looked to them a far off and they
[2:43:27] were persuaded of them
[2:43:30] and they condemned the world.
[2:43:36] It's not that
[2:43:38] you won't do mistakes.
[2:43:41] You are bound to do mistakes,
[2:43:45] but you are still a son and daughter.
[2:43:49] And as long as you have the Holy Spirit,
[2:43:53] he will set you down and make you to
[2:43:56] think on your ways.
[2:43:59] David said, "I thought on my ways. I
[2:44:04] turned my feet your testimony.
[2:44:07] God will always make you to think on
[2:44:12] says in a message it shall be as it was
[2:44:14] told me.
[2:44:17] There's many times that I know that I
[2:44:18] make so many mistakes
[2:44:22] and I fail in so many things that I am
[2:44:24] ashamed of myself.
[2:44:28] But in my heart, I am trying all that I
[2:44:30] know how.
[2:44:33] I'm just doing all that I know how.
[2:44:36] That is confession.
[2:44:39] He says, "I made many mistakes.
[2:44:42] Still make them
[2:44:44] and you will always make them." In a
[2:44:47] message, law of grace.
[2:44:49] I made many mistakes.
[2:44:52] Still make them. We always make them.
[2:45:00] I didn't want to read you. Read that
[2:45:02] quotation.
[2:45:07] Let me read it just
[2:45:12] says
[2:45:17] uh law of grace paragraph 135.
[2:45:31] I made many mistakes
[2:45:33] to make them.
[2:45:35] will always make them. But when I make
[2:45:38] them, the Holy Spirit tells me that it's
[2:45:41] wrong.
[2:45:45] Then I repent right there.
[2:45:48] I say, "Lord, forgive me. I didn't mean
[2:45:51] to do it.
[2:45:53] You help me now." And I walk right on.
[2:45:58] I walk right on the same thing
[2:46:04] because just no sooner than it goes from
[2:46:06] my lips.
[2:46:08] If we confess our sins
[2:46:11] is just to forgive them.
[2:46:14] Is that right? The devil say you know
[2:46:16] that you know what I will tell you. You
[2:46:20] were supposed to go and do a certain
[2:46:21] thing you didn't do it. You sinned. I
[2:46:25] say I confessed it.
[2:46:29] Don't talk to me about that.
[2:46:32] You see,
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; so he says you will make mistakes.
[2:46:37] You always will,
[2:46:39] but the Holy Spirit will tell you touch.
[2:46:45] How many knows brother Ben?
[2:46:48] How many believes him to be God's
[2:46:49] servant?
[2:46:52] He says that this brother makes many
[2:46:54] mistakes.
[2:46:56] But the good thing about him when he
[2:46:59] makes them, he's always ready to crown
[2:47:02] them
[2:47:05] and make it right.
[2:47:08] A real man of God,
[2:47:10] they know that they are not infallible,
[2:47:14] but their confidence is in the
[2:47:16] infallibility of God.
[2:47:22] We therefore do not focus on each
[2:47:24] other's mistakes.
[2:47:28] or on our own mistakes.
[2:47:31] My mistakes
[2:47:32] should never be a stumbling block to you
[2:47:36] and your mistakes should never be a
[2:47:39] stumbling block to me.
[2:47:42] But stepping stones
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:45] that that that will help me
[2:47:49] to get closer to Jesus.
[2:47:52] We should all look to Jesus and focus on
[2:47:55] him, the author and the finisher of our
[2:47:58] faith
[2:48:01] as we stand on our feet.
[2:48:03] says in a message my life start
[2:48:08] now it was given out
[2:48:11] that today I was to kind of talk to you
[2:48:15] a while
[2:48:18] on my life story
[2:48:21] that's a hard thing for me
[2:48:25] this will be the first time
[2:48:29] I have tried to approach it for many
[2:48:33] and I would do not have time to go in
[2:48:35] detail
[2:48:38] but just part of it.
[2:48:41] Now listen, it says and in here
[2:48:46] in here in life story.
[2:48:50] I have made many mistakes.
[2:48:59] [Music]
[2:49:01] done many things
[2:49:04] that was wrong.
[2:49:09] And I will desire
[2:49:11] [Music]
[2:49:12] that you in the radio land
[2:49:15] and you that are present that you will
[2:49:18] not take my mistakes
[2:49:21] to be stumbling stones
[2:49:24] but stepping stones
[2:49:27] to bring you closer to the Lord Jesus.
[2:49:31] I'm done here.
[2:49:33] Pilgrims and strangers
[2:49:36] upon each other's mistakes.
[2:49:39] This one, this one, that one, that one
[2:49:42] will look to Jesus.
[2:49:45] [Music]
[2:49:50] Any mistake
[2:49:52] of anyone
[2:49:54] should draw you closer to Christ,
[2:49:58] be a stepping stone to you.
[2:50:02] until the Lord comes.
[2:50:05] Till that time, we are pilgrims and
[2:50:08] strangers.
[2:50:10] Keep your eyes on Jesus.
[2:50:16] There's a song which says,
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; "Ton
[2:50:25] [Music]
[2:50:27] shalom.
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; You come and sing with me this song.
[2:50:32] I am

[2:50:55] reputation

[2:53:15] then my time

[2:56:10] I am
[2:56:13] I know
[2:56:15] is mine.
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; Why don't you take this moment and go
[2:56:21] before the Lord?
[2:56:25] Yeah, we are still in his presence.
[2:56:28] The Bible tells us not to hurry to leave
[2:56:30] the king.
[2:56:34] We have heard the word.
[2:56:37] The word has been spoken.
[2:56:40] The Lord has corrected us.
[2:56:44] He has warned us. Personally has spoken
[2:56:47] to me.
[2:56:49] Just take this little moment
[2:56:51] and pour your heart before the Lord.
[2:56:55] I believe he is here.
[2:56:57] His concern about our life.
[2:57:00] That's why he has spoken to us today. He
[2:57:03] save those whom we love. He corrects
[2:57:06] them and he rebukes them. Precious
[2:57:10] father in the name of Jesus. Father, we
[2:57:13] come before you Lord God of glory. We
[2:57:16] love you Lord Jesus, we bless your dear
[2:57:19] name Lord God. You've sent your word our
[2:57:23] savior. You say that when you send your
[2:57:25] word, it will not turn to fire Lord
[2:57:28] Jesus. The word has gone forth out of
[2:57:31] your mouth in righteousness Lord. And
[2:57:33] Lord, we are here siring our heart to
[2:57:36] you, Lord. We surrender our will to you
[2:57:39] Lord Jesus. We are ashamed of oursel. We
[2:57:43] are sorry Lord Jesus where things have
[2:57:46] gone wrong in our life. Oh God. Father
[2:57:49] we are coming in the name of the Lord
[2:57:52] Jesus Christ. Through the door of the

[2:58:52] upon our weaknesses. Father, how much
[2:58:55] must upon our ways? Oh God, our soul, oh

[2:59:13] thirst after God. Precious father, this
[2:59:17] afternoon we ask you, Lord Jesus,
[2:59:20] release your presence in our meetings.
[2:59:23] Have mercy upon us, Lord. Forgive our
[2:59:26] iniquities, Lord. Our sins of omission
[2:59:30] and commission, Jehovah God, where we
[2:59:33] have let you down, Lord. We are just
[2:59:36] mortal being, Lord Jesus. But we thank
[2:59:39] you because you are concerned about our
[2:59:41] situation. You know our condition, Lord.
[2:59:44] You know our fears and our worries, Lord
[2:59:47] Jesus. May you be merciful unto us this
[2:59:50] afternoon. May the precious blood of
[2:59:53] Jesus turn the wrath of the Lord from
[2:59:55] us. Lord Jesus, have mercy upon us,
[2:59:59] Lord. Have mercy upon our soul.

[3:00:27] Jesus. You know us in and out. Oh God,

[3:00:34] our failures, Lord Jesus. But we pray
[3:00:37] that Lord, you'll be merciful. You'll
[3:00:40] help us. You'll wash us, Lord Jesus.
[3:00:44] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus
[3:00:46] Christ, for your mercies and your grace.
[3:00:51] Yes, Lord Jesus.

[3:02:28] [Music]
[3:02:31] He's the redeemer of our soul. Brother,
[3:02:34] sister.
[3:02:35] [Music]
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[3:02:43] &gt;&gt; He loves
[3:02:46] [Music]
[3:02:51] to me.
[3:02:56] I will love
[3:02:59] him more
[3:03:02] because
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; it's because he first loved us.
[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; He has given us life.
[3:03:15] to me.
[3:03:18] [Music]
[3:03:23] We were nothing and
[3:03:25] &gt;&gt; done
[3:03:28] [Music]
[3:03:40] to me.
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I will trust him.
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; I will trust.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; I will trust the Lord.
[3:03:51] Because he

[3:03:58] &gt;&gt; he has
[3:04:05] to me.
[3:04:07] [Music]
[3:04:10] &gt;&gt; I was nothing
[3:04:14] [Music]
[3:04:16] until it found me.
[3:04:20] [Music]
[3:04:30] Oh, I will seek him. I will seek
[3:04:38] you because he loves me.
[3:04:46] He has given
[3:04:50] life
[3:04:53] to me.
[3:04:57] &gt;&gt; I was nothing.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; I was nothing, Lord. until he
[3:05:04] &gt;&gt; until you fall as Lord
[3:05:15] to me.
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I will serve him.
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; I will serve him
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; because
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; because he loves
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; because he loves me.
[3:05:31] We are
[3:05:34] in love.
[3:05:39] [Music]
[3:05:42] I was nothing
[3:05:44] [Applause]
[3:05:47] until he found me.
[3:05:53] He
[3:05:56] will light
[3:05:59] to me.
[3:06:04] Yeah, we pray. If you have any need this
[3:06:08] afternoon,
[3:06:09] maybe you are sick and afflicted and you
[3:06:11] want the Lord to touch you. Maybe you
[3:06:15] are troubled in your soul. Maybe the
[3:06:18] water has fallen. You've been weighed on
[3:06:20] scale and found yourself uh less. One
[3:06:23] thing I'm sure of that the grace of God
[3:06:25] is still here. Like the singer say that
[3:06:28] as long as the church of God is here,
[3:06:31] there are some churches here, his blood
[3:06:33] will never lose its power. I just want
[3:06:36] you to raise your hand this afternoon
[3:06:38] and we are going to pray together
[3:06:40] believing that the Lord will answer your
[3:06:43] prayer. Precious Father, in the name of
[3:06:46] the Lord Jesus Christ, Father, we humble
[3:06:49] our soul before thy throne of grace.
[3:06:51] Lord, you are our refuge, Lord. The
[3:06:54] Bible tells us that your present hope in
[3:06:56] time of trouble. Even this afternoon,
[3:06:59] Lord Jesus, you have spoken to us, Lord.
[3:07:03] For we know that you spake this very
[3:07:05] word in the beginning and the world,
[3:07:07] Father, came into existence. You have
[3:07:10] spoken again, Lord. You have reched the
[3:07:13] word again this afternoon Lord Jesus and
[3:07:16] we believe Lord your word. We ask you to
[3:07:18] forgive us where we are strayed. And
[3:07:21] this afternoon Lord we surrender
[3:07:23] ourself. We are forsaking our ways and
