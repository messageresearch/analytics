[1:13:53] Ethiopia uh uh God bless you so much the
[1:13:57] I was able by God's grace to give a
[1:13:59] report on Sunday uh on Wednesday last
[1:14:02] Wednesday so if you missed it you might
[1:14:04] want to go and check it
[1:14:06] out you might want to go and uh check it
[1:14:09] out on U on the on the
[1:14:16] YouTube so how many were able to watch
[1:14:20] the service those who are not here
[1:14:25] I see a few were able to watch
[1:14:28] that although it's been watched by many
[1:14:31] around the
[1:14:33] world but I encourage you to go and
[1:14:36] listen you know if I'm a part of a
[1:14:39] church I really want to know what God is
[1:14:42] doing I don't want to take the back
[1:14:45] bench I want to be on the
[1:14:48] Forefront when support is needed I want
[1:14:50] to give
[1:14:52] it in form of Prayer in the form of
[1:14:56] encouragement in form of um you know um
[1:15:00] money whatever it is I want to be
[1:15:03] there I would like to thank you all who
[1:15:05] have prayed for
[1:15:07] us some who sent us some messages
[1:15:11] encouragement some who you know have
[1:15:14] been you know supportive in other
[1:15:19] means the Lord has been good we had a
[1:15:22] very successful trip in Ethiopia
[1:15:26] amen and uh meanwhile we would like to
[1:15:29] bring greetings to you from Sister
[1:15:34] Dina uh from
[1:15:36] Boston part of this church team the
[1:15:41] services I believe she's even on
[1:15:43] now she has need for prayer she has I
[1:15:47] think a migrain or a
[1:15:50] headache needs go to visit her this
[1:15:55] several needs for prayers here also the
[1:15:57] sister
[1:15:58] Fe who is not here with us this
[1:16:01] morning uh she's
[1:16:05] um under expectation for a
[1:16:09] baby so let us remember I mean parents
[1:16:12] you
[1:16:12] know during this time it is a a very
[1:16:15] sensitive
[1:16:17] moment for both the mother the father
[1:16:20] and the whole
[1:16:22] family because you know giving birth is
[1:16:25] not
[1:16:27] easy it's a life and death
[1:16:30] situation so whenever we have a mother
[1:16:33] giving
[1:16:34] birth we usually want to cover them with
[1:16:37] our prayers as a
[1:16:39] church so whenever you really hear
[1:16:42] someone needs prayer
[1:16:44] please pray for them pray for them don't
[1:16:48] just take it serious and pray for
[1:16:50] them I know because I've gone through
[1:16:53] that
[1:16:55] with my wife and it has always been a
[1:16:57] very sensitive
[1:17:00] moment amen and also there's need for
[1:17:02] sister Esther who is also not here this
[1:17:05] morning she has need for prayer with her
[1:17:10] mother her mother is
[1:17:13] ill you know she lost her father not
[1:17:15] long
[1:17:17] ago and her mother has also been
[1:17:20] sick for a season and at this time I
[1:17:24] understand she's a bit
[1:17:26] e so let us remember Sister
[1:17:29] Esther and our mother in
[1:17:31] prayer amen so those are the prayer
[1:17:34] requests we we are going to pray for
[1:17:35] before we go to the
[1:17:37] word but I also have some good
[1:17:41] news sister Angela who is one of us
[1:17:44] here I think she's not been able to come
[1:17:47] to church
[1:17:49] yet God blessed her with a baby
[1:17:53] boy and uh
[1:17:56] she had a normal
[1:17:57] delivery and we really really thank God
[1:17:59] for
[1:18:01] that so if you know usually I want it to
[1:18:05] be the custom of the
[1:18:07] church whenever someone gives
[1:18:10] birth like sister phib
[1:18:13] here who recently gave birth who else
[1:18:15] gave birth
[1:18:18] recently there's I think another
[1:18:21] sister I don't see her here what's her
[1:18:24] name sister
[1:18:26] Sister Sister
[1:18:28] Linda Oh Sister
[1:18:31] Anita so she's not here I think right
[1:18:35] she recently gave
[1:18:37] birth
[1:18:38] uh my sister here gave birth before all
[1:18:41] of
[1:18:44] them so sister omet Ruth omet so I'm
[1:18:48] requesting whenever you hear mother's
[1:18:49] giving
[1:18:50] bir what you do I will tell you let us
[1:18:54] our
[1:18:56] custom get a gift and take it
[1:18:59] to if you can't go there at least send
[1:19:02] it you know show them
[1:19:04] love those are good things gifts from
[1:19:07] the Lord you know when Jesus was born
[1:19:10] they brought give

[1:23:15] for uh this coming
[1:23:19] Saturday I've heard rumors that they
[1:23:21] might want to change the dees
[1:23:26] but I think until it is confirmed we
[1:23:28] will be able to make the
[1:23:33] announcement amen but we are so
[1:23:37] thankful to what the Lord can
[1:23:39] do and I think there is no reason why

[1:25:46] days I I said someone saying sure I
[1:25:48] think they'll sponsor
[1:25:52] us God bless you Matthew

[1:26:02] 31 it's a long reading so we shall read
[1:26:04] a few verses and then
[1:26:10] sit let us first
[1:26:12] pray Lord
[1:26:14] Jesus we know how to read and we can
[1:26:16] read this uh
[1:26:19] text but we we do not know how to bring
[1:26:22] it to your people
[1:26:25] in a way that it can bring life to
[1:26:28] them I pray that you will Quicken our
[1:26:31] words and also our thoughts let it be
[1:26:34] your thoughts and your
[1:26:37] words Grant it I pray in
[1:26:40] Jesus amen amen then sayith Jesus unto
[1:26:44] them all ye shall be offended because of
[1:26:47] me this night for it is written I will
[1:26:50] Smite the shepherd and the she sheep of
[1:26:53] the flock shall be scattered abroad but
[1:26:56] after I am risen again I will go before
[1:26:59] you into
[1:27:20] Galilee okay uh Jesus um Peter answered
[1:27:23] and said unto him though all men shall
[1:27:26] be offended because of thee yet will I
[1:27:28] not be
[1:27:38] offended Jesus said unto him verily I
[1:27:40] say unto thee that this night before the
[1:27:44] craw thou shal deny me Thrice
[1:27:57] Peter said unto him though I should die
[1:27:59] with thee yet will I not deny thee
[1:28:03] likewise also said all the
[1:28:16] disciples amen we are going to read up
[1:28:19] to
[1:28:21] 75 we will do that when you are seated
[1:28:25] you can be
[1:28:26] seated but sh if you can give me a
[1:28:30] little more sound i' appreciate
[1:28:33] that you know I was speaking to a
[1:28:37] brother and he was saying even if it is
[1:28:40] not taken as an important
[1:28:44] thing but it is important for pastors to
[1:28:48] rest said because you cannot power out
[1:28:51] of an empty picture
[1:28:56] you occasionally need to rest a
[1:28:58] while just like you work in a day you
[1:29:01] work work work
[1:29:02] work and then you feel totally broken
[1:29:05] down you can't walk anymore so you want
[1:29:09] to go sleep when you wake up you feel
[1:29:12] energized again and you begin working in
[1:29:14] the next day so the same way uh we we
[1:29:17] always need to take some rest on and
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:22] off especially when you burn
[1:29:26] out I can assure you if your preacher is
[1:29:28] very active and not burn out he can be
[1:29:30] more
[1:29:37] productive so I was meaning it when I
[1:29:39] said I'm planning to take some little
[1:29:42] rest so pray for me that that will be
[1:29:46] possible amen so this morning I want to
[1:29:49] speak on a subject a man under pressure
[1:30:04] I have always talked about this I
[1:30:07] usually have something here but I think
[1:30:09] dur
[1:30:13] theth
[1:30:15] um first of all before we go to the word
[1:30:17] I want to appreciate the brothers that
[1:30:18] ministered while I was away
[1:30:24] bless
[1:30:25] you uh we really appreciate you and you
[1:30:28] know being able to take to put your
[1:30:30] shoulders to the
[1:30:34] wheel amen all from the
[1:30:37] minister to the song leaders
[1:30:40] musicians you are all
[1:30:42] appreciated amen and to the people that
[1:30:45] supported the ministry as
[1:30:48] well you know friends we are not
[1:30:50] building a
[1:30:52] wall we are building a
[1:30:55] house and this house is going to be
[1:30:58] finished and we shall live in
[1:31:01] it amen both
[1:31:04] spiritually and physically yeah we are
[1:31:07] going somewhere we a Ministry that has a
[1:31:11] vision we are not just doing things
[1:31:13] because we
[1:31:15] believe we are doing things because we
[1:31:17] have a
[1:31:19] commission and we know where we are
[1:31:21] headed we headed to the rapture
[1:31:24] and we know while we are still
[1:31:27] here what we ought to do have many
[1:31:30] programs coming this but I'm just
[1:31:33] encouraging you that we should remain
[1:31:36] focused we should be focused to whatever
[1:31:39] we are doing brother I'm happy to see
[1:31:42] you brother Baka SE with your
[1:31:46] wife that is so
[1:31:48] lovely God bless you amen and so uh this
[1:31:53] subject is very important one to
[1:31:55] me and I believe it will be to
[1:31:58] you if the Holy Spirit can help us to
[1:32:01] get into the depth of
[1:32:03] it a man under
[1:32:07] pressure now um I have taken this text
[1:32:11] out of the Book of
[1:32:13] Matthew because this Book of Matthew
[1:32:16] here in this portion of it talks about
[1:32:19] you know the time when Jesus was going
[1:32:22] to H be killed
[1:32:28] it was a very wonderful moment when he
[1:32:30] was still picking his
[1:32:34] disciples it was a wonderful time when
[1:32:36] he was you know going around and
[1:32:38] preaching with
[1:32:40] them they saw the
[1:32:42] Miracles they saw the power the Saints
[1:32:44] and the
[1:32:46] Wonders and you know the ministry of
[1:32:48] Jesus was
[1:32:50] powerful how many agree with me that
[1:32:53] also the disciples he
[1:32:56] picked he picked those he knew he was
[1:32:58] picking for a
[1:33:01] purpose is that right you know did you
[1:33:05] even believe can you even believe that
[1:33:06] even Judas was picked for a
[1:33:10] purpose if Jesus picked
[1:33:13] you he picked you for a
[1:33:15] purpose but I want to be picked for a
[1:33:18] good
[1:33:19] purpose I don't want to be a
[1:33:21] Judas I want to be a Peter
[1:33:24] but even Peter had his ups and
[1:33:27] downs but I want us to examine the
[1:33:30] ministry and the life of Peter under
[1:33:35] pressure and also we look at the life
[1:33:37] and Ministry of Jesus under
[1:33:42] pressure and then we look at
[1:33:45] us under
[1:33:47] pressure when we are done with that then
[1:33:50] the service will be over
[1:33:52] go praise the name of the Lord
[1:33:54] and so we are now going to continue
[1:33:56] reading if you brother you can brother M
[1:33:57] if you can put it up for us here the
[1:33:59] scripture that be
[1:34:01] nice I'd like us to continue reading on
[1:34:04] up to vers
[1:34:06] 75 okay uh where did we stop do anybody
[1:34:13] remember
[1:34:14] 35 okay now shall we continue to
[1:34:19] 36 all right then cometh Jesus with them
[1:34:22] unto a place called now here we have
[1:34:25] seen you know Peter making a
[1:34:29] promise he said even if everybody
[1:34:31] forsakes you and they get offended at
[1:34:35] you you can count on
[1:34:37] me Peter be his CH said
[1:34:44] You I Will I Am with You amen and many
[1:34:48] of us can say the same about this
[1:34:51] message we can say the same about
[1:34:54] chist we can say the same about the
[1:34:57] convictions we have about
[1:35:00] life that's okay but wait when pressure
[1:35:05] comes that's when we can know what is
[1:35:09] happening all right I I I I want us to
[1:35:12] be ready for these things
[1:35:14] today because um you know um I'm going
[1:35:19] to talk about real
[1:35:21] things okay I don't want to talk about
[1:35:23] things which are in
[1:35:25] heaven when we are still on
[1:35:27] Earth so can we be real this morning
[1:35:31] church amen all right shall we continue
[1:35:35] now so then cometh Jesus with them unto
[1:35:38] a place called Gethsemane and sayith
[1:35:40] unto the disciples sit ye here while I
[1:35:42] go and pray Yonder and he took now I
[1:35:44] think it it will be okay shall we okay
[1:35:48] maybe I can just read in English because
[1:35:49] of time and then you will because we
[1:35:52] shall go through it again afterwards and
[1:35:54] he took him with him just read follow
[1:35:56] along there with me while I
[1:35:59] read and he took with him Peter and the
[1:36:02] two sons of zebede and began to be
[1:36:05] sorrowful and very heavy very heavy he
[1:36:09] was very
[1:36:11] heavy then said why was he
[1:36:14] heavy why was he
[1:36:16] heavy how ever felt heavy in their
[1:36:20] life you feel heavy you you are cut it's
[1:36:24] like as if you're cutting a heavy
[1:36:26] Lord you are under
[1:36:28] pressure you feel things are difficult
[1:36:32] you feel you cannot
[1:36:34] continue you feel if it is possible the
[1:36:37] ground should open up and swallow
[1:36:39] you you feel things are tough you are
[1:36:44] heavy okay this is Jesus has been there
[1:36:47] before are you not so glad we serve a
[1:36:51] God who has been in our
[1:36:55] situation and he knows what we feel and
[1:36:59] he feels what you feel and he says I
[1:37:02] understand so someone who understands is
[1:37:06] someone who can offer a
[1:37:09] solution a working
[1:37:11] solution because he has experienced
[1:37:14] everything we
[1:37:16] experience there is nothing no
[1:37:19] temptation that is higher that he has
[1:37:21] never experienced
[1:37:24] he he felt very heavy then he said unto
[1:37:28] them my soul is exceeding
[1:37:31] sorrowful even unto
[1:37:35] death I'm so sorrowful to
[1:37:38] death
[1:37:41] imagine imagine that Jesus we worship
[1:37:44] once he was like that not because he was
[1:37:47] beaten not because anything had happened
[1:37:49] to
[1:37:50] him no but because something was about
[1:37:54] to
[1:37:55] happen and he did not know how to go
[1:37:58] through
[1:37:59] it he was under
[1:38:02] pressure and therefore he became so
[1:38:06] sorrowful he was very
[1:38:09] heavy he felt like
[1:38:12] dying I want you to imagine that Jesus
[1:38:15] felt like
[1:38:17] dying have you ever felt like
[1:38:20] that well don't lift up your hands some
[1:38:23] people
[1:38:25] but Jesus felt like
[1:38:28] dying in other words in our normal
[1:38:36] language I feel I'm sick and
[1:38:39] tired sick and
[1:38:41] tired just want to die and Away Jesus
[1:38:44] felt like
[1:38:48] that and so he told his
[1:38:51] disciples here and watch with
[1:38:56] me stand with me stand with me I can't
[1:39:01] be
[1:39:03] alone the savior of the
[1:39:05] world he felt he needed
[1:39:08] help he need people to stand with
[1:39:12] him stand with
[1:39:15] him even Jesus needed
[1:39:21] enage amen have you ever been in that
[1:39:25] condition where you feel you don't need
[1:39:29] criticism but you need encourag
[1:39:32] us at this time he left all the other
[1:39:37] disciples he took only the ones you
[1:39:39] could
[1:39:41] trust that these ones are not
[1:39:44] judgmental these ones can
[1:39:46] understand and can stand with
[1:39:50] me this is a realistic point of view
[1:39:55] here and he went a little further and he
[1:39:59] fell on his face and prayed saying oh my
[1:40:02] father for it be possible let disc
[1:40:04] compass from me nevertheless not as I
[1:40:07] will but as thou will he prayed and he
[1:40:09] cometh unto the disciples and he find
[1:40:11] them asleep and said unto Peter what
[1:40:14] could you not watch with me one hour he
[1:40:16] found a disciples
[1:40:19] sleeping the ones he expected he will
[1:40:21] confide in
[1:40:25] by the way don't over spiritualize
[1:40:27] this Jesus was a man like
[1:40:31] you 100% not 99% not 50%
[1:40:37] 100% thank and this is how he
[1:40:41] fa he took some
[1:40:43] brothers his brothers to stand with him
[1:40:47] and instead of praying with
[1:40:49] him help Jesus help our brother streng
[1:40:54] him they went to
[1:40:56] bed and they slept so woke up out of
[1:41:01] prayer what you couldn't even watch with
[1:41:04] me pray with me for even one
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:10] hour very discouraging isn't
[1:41:13] it you know at a time when the pressure
[1:41:16] is
[1:41:17] up that's when everything will
[1:41:20] discourage you
[1:41:23] that's when you feel everybody is seeing
[1:41:25] you as a useless
[1:41:29] person am I talking to rocks or you ever
[1:41:33] been have you ever been in that
[1:41:35] situation where you feel you need to be
[1:41:39] massaged
[1:41:41] encourage someone who should come and
[1:41:43] say brother
[1:41:44] you but everybody who comes what is
[1:41:47] wrong with you you have a
[1:41:50] problem this is how Jesus felt now you
[1:41:53] say let me go to fasting and prayer let
[1:41:56] me take brother Di and brother Julius to
[1:41:58] help you reach
[1:42:02] Church they they sleeping see brother
[1:42:07] you can't stand with
[1:42:10] me the situation was very
[1:42:13] intense he was under
[1:42:17] pressure watch and pray that ye enter
[1:42:20] not into temptation the spirit indeed is
[1:42:21] willing but the flesh is willing
[1:42:24] he went away again the second time and
[1:42:26] prayed saying oh my father if th if this
[1:42:28] cup may not pass if this cup may not
[1:42:31] pass away from me except I drink it thy
[1:42:35] will be done and he came and found them
[1:42:37] asleep
[1:42:39] again for their eyes were
[1:42:42] heavy when you are under
[1:42:46] pressure that's when even your eyes will
[1:42:49] become heaven
[1:42:53] the eyes of those who are supposed to
[1:42:54] help you will become
[1:42:59] heavy can't see that I need
[1:43:02] help you can't see that I need
[1:43:05] encouragement but they don't see
[1:43:09] you and he left them he left them and
[1:43:13] went away again and prayed a third time
[1:43:17] saying the same words amen then cometh
[1:43:20] he to his disciples and said unto them
[1:43:22] sleep sleep on now sleep on now the
[1:43:25] third time when he came back he told
[1:43:26] them now continue
[1:43:31] sleeping sleep on now brother I don't
[1:43:35] know what's happening to this uh speaker
[1:43:37] you will have to work on it all right
[1:43:38] thank you he says sleep on now and take
[1:43:41] your rest behold the hour is at hand and
[1:43:44] the son of man is betrayed into the
[1:43:47] hands of the
[1:43:48] Sinners Brethren
[1:43:50] usually you don't pray when you are
[1:43:53] going through a
[1:43:57] problem you should pray before the
[1:43:59] problem
[1:44:00] comes you should always have a
[1:44:04] vision see what is coming and prepare
[1:44:08] yourself for it before it
[1:44:10] comes because after it has
[1:44:13] come that what you think is prayer is
[1:44:15] not
[1:44:16] prayer it is just
[1:44:19] desperation but you see real prayer
[1:44:21] comes before
[1:44:24] the
[1:44:24] problem the problem should come after
[1:44:29] prayer and here Jesus was
[1:44:32] praying and you know because he knew
[1:44:34] what was
[1:44:35] coming he was under intense
[1:44:39] pressure come let us
[1:44:41] pray wake up let us pray wake up don't
[1:44:45] enter
[1:44:46] Temptation and then what happened they
[1:44:48] just slept they just slept the second
[1:44:51] time so after he knew it had been
[1:44:55] done he told him now continue
[1:44:57] sleeping don't need to pray the thing
[1:45:00] has already been
[1:45:02] done rise let us be going behold he is
[1:45:07] at hand that do betray me and while he
[1:45:10] yet spake L Judas one of the 12 came and
[1:45:14] with him a great multitude with swords
[1:45:16] and staves from the chief priests and
[1:45:18] Elders of the people now he that
[1:45:21] betrayed him gave them a sign saying
[1:45:23] whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he
[1:45:26] hold fast and forth with he came to
[1:45:29] Jesus and said hail master and kissed
[1:45:32] him and Jesus said unto him friend
[1:45:35] whereof Thou come then came they and
[1:45:38] laid hands on Jesus and took him and
[1:45:41] behold one of them which were with Jesus
[1:45:44] stretched out his hand and Drew his
[1:45:46] sword and struck a servant of the
[1:45:48] highest Priestess and smart of his ear
[1:45:51] then said Jesus unto him
[1:45:53] put up again thy sword into his place
[1:45:56] for all they that take the sword Shall
[1:45:59] Perish with the sword thinkest thou that
[1:46:01] I cannot now pray to my father and he
[1:46:05] shall presently give me more than 12
[1:46:07] Legions of
[1:46:11] angels some people have missed this
[1:46:16] portion Jesus was under what
[1:46:24] that is 10% of you Jesus was under what
[1:46:28] Breen
[1:46:30] pressure and then a brother you know
[1:46:34] sometimes when you are under
[1:46:35] pressure and you have a huge
[1:46:38] problem some people think they actually
[1:46:40] helping
[1:46:42] you but by helping you they actually
[1:46:44] destroying
[1:46:47] you here a brother pulls out a SW and
[1:46:51] cuts off the ear of the enemies but
[1:46:54] Jesus said no no no no no no take back
[1:46:57] your
[1:46:58] sword don't you know that my father is
[1:47:03] able oh my God may God reveal this to us
[1:47:06] today my father is able to send Legions
[1:47:10] of
[1:47:13] angels more than 12
[1:47:17] Legions he is able to send them now to
[1:47:21] come and fight for me
[1:47:23] but why did he
[1:47:24] send because God wanted Jesus to be
[1:47:28] under
[1:47:31] pressure because he wanted him to be
[1:47:34] tested he wanted him to be
[1:47:36] tried because he was beating him out so
[1:47:40] that character can come
[1:47:42] out sometimes God let things happen to
[1:47:45] us not because is not able to help us
[1:47:49] God is more than
[1:47:50] able God is more than
[1:47:54] there is nothing he cannot do he watches
[1:47:57] every time he sees what happens to you
[1:48:01] he knows what happens to you during day
[1:48:05] during night during every time when you
[1:48:08] are in your Valley when you are in your
[1:48:10] mountain when you are
[1:48:13] anywhere knows and our God sees but why
[1:48:17] does he watch because he wanted that
[1:48:20] pressure to come
[1:48:24] that pressure must
[1:48:25] be it is his
[1:48:30] will but he's
[1:48:32] able that one comforts
[1:48:34] me Jesus
[1:48:37] knew he was not
[1:48:43] presuming he was not spiritualizing the
[1:48:46] situation he knew my father
[1:48:50] is by let me tell you brethren
[1:48:53] no matter what situations we go on in
[1:48:55] life we must always have that
[1:48:59] attitude that God is able to do the
[1:49:05] import hallelujah amen God is able to do
[1:49:09] the God has never been
[1:49:13] unable He's
[1:49:15] Able He's Able there is nothing he can
[1:49:19] fail to
[1:49:20] do he can do anything he can do
[1:49:23] everything but why is it that sometimes
[1:49:26] he doesn't do
[1:49:28] it it is his
[1:49:33] will amen after all the
[1:49:36] prayers stand still because when you
[1:49:39] stand still you are showing you know who
[1:49:42] your father
[1:49:44] is if you know the will of
[1:49:47] God for anything in your life don't let
[1:49:51] anyone talk you out of
[1:49:56] am I preaching to
[1:49:58] someone don't let anyone talk you out of
[1:50:00] the will of
[1:50:03] God there is the will of man there is
[1:50:06] the will of God the will of man shall
[1:50:10] fail the ways of man shall
[1:50:12] fail but the will of God is
[1:50:15] permanent and can never
[1:50:18] fail sometimes the will of God does not
[1:50:21] look like the will of God
[1:50:24] because the will of God is harder the
[1:50:28] will of God is difficult the will of God
[1:50:32] is usually very very difficult to go
[1:50:36] through but to a
[1:50:38] Believer I said who a
[1:50:42] belever we are believers in we are
[1:50:46] believers anyway no matter what happens
[1:50:50] we are believers we are called to
[1:50:52] believe
[1:50:53] that our father is
[1:50:55] able to send
[1:50:57] angels to come and take us out of this
[1:51:00] situation SRA M
[1:51:04] and they knew the will of
[1:51:06] God the will of God
[1:51:08] was do not bow do not bath no matter how
[1:51:14] hot the fire is
[1:51:22] it was the will of
[1:51:24] God didn't they know
[1:51:26] it they knew it
[1:51:29] but when the fire becames
[1:51:33] hotter they even gave them another
[1:51:35] chance they said okay maybe it was a
[1:51:39] mistake for you to disobey the words of
[1:51:41] the let us give you another chance when
[1:51:44] you hear the drums and you hear the
[1:51:46] music and you hear the timbr and
[1:51:50] everything bow
[1:51:52] and that music was not the music
[1:51:55] Believers are supposed to
[1:51:58] hear we should different oh my god
[1:52:01] listen church we must
[1:52:04] differentiate loud
[1:52:06] sounds with the music of the Holy
[1:52:09] Ghost the music of the Holy
[1:52:12] Ghost always agrees with the
[1:52:15] word but loud
[1:52:17] sound come from the devil and his
[1:52:20] associates discourage
[1:52:23] from going into the will of
[1:52:25] God and they beat all the music and the
[1:52:27] sound and everything and then you see
[1:52:30] people many of them were
[1:52:33] Believers by the way many of them were
[1:52:36] Believers of them were believer who were
[1:52:39] now in
[1:52:41] Babylon you see but now when they other
[1:52:44] the
[1:52:45] music all of them began
[1:52:49] dancing you are poor you accept it yes
[1:52:53] you are nothing you accept yes you
[1:52:56] cannot do it you accept
[1:52:59] yes you are like the rest of them
[1:53:01] you yes no matter what God say but you
[1:53:05] look at the life the things of life you
[1:53:09] accept it yes and they
[1:53:14] bowed so what are you going to do
[1:53:17] everyone does what everyone
[1:53:20] borrows I'll borrow
[1:53:23] everyone sells what they have to get
[1:53:26] what they need I also do what are they
[1:53:30] doing they dancing to the
[1:53:32] tune of the devil's
[1:53:34] music because everyone sees it that
[1:53:38] way everyone believes it that their eyes
[1:53:42] are
[1:53:43] fixated on the so called realities of
[1:53:49] life but a Believer has a different
[1:53:55] reality a Believer listens to a
[1:53:57] different
[1:53:59] sound the sound of the promises of God
[1:54:03] word the sound of the
[1:54:06] word what what God
[1:54:08] says that will always be the
[1:54:13] truth let every man's word be a
[1:54:16] li let God his word be
[1:54:19] the what did God say you are the heads
[1:54:23] not the
[1:54:24] Tails so I am not poor don't you see the
[1:54:28] reality no I'm not
[1:54:30] dance we have to come to that place
[1:54:33] where we will tell the devil we will not
[1:54:36] dance we will not dance

[1:54:41] tune don't you see you are
[1:54:45] sick sister Diana don't you see you're
[1:54:48] blind you tell the devil I will not
[1:54:50] dance

[1:54:56] reality no I will not

[1:55:13] can't get a husband no I will not dance
[1:55:17] I am hearing a different
[1:55:19] sound these brothers they knew something
[1:55:22] the devil did not
[1:55:24] know brother Marvin these brothers had
[1:55:28] met God they had character they knew
[1:55:33] that they knew God is faithful even if
[1:55:37] the fire burns
[1:55:38] there they knew still he is
[1:55:43] faithful they were ready to
[1:55:46] die a Believer is like a mad
[1:55:50] person you are ready to die
[1:55:53] you do things which are Beyond
[1:55:57] Reason now you know why brother Bram
[1:56:02] said they will call you
[1:56:04] a they will call you a nut they will
[1:56:07] call you
[1:56:08] AUD they will call you you know what is

[1:56:12] word you know like you you're so
[1:56:15] you that's a very good they call you a
[1:56:19] fanatic you know someone who is
[1:56:20] fanatical

[1:56:56] to
[1:56:57] burn if you not ready to
[1:57:00] burn you are not a True
[1:57:04] Believer a True Believer should be ready
[1:57:06] to
[1:57:07] [Applause]
[1:57:09] burn order to stand with
[1:57:13] God meaning a True Believer believes the
[1:57:17] word regardless of the
[1:57:21] situation a True Believer stands with
[1:57:23] God's
[1:57:24] word regardless of the
[1:57:28] circumstances what is God's word God's
[1:57:32] word is the
[1:57:33] truth God's word is the will of God when
[1:57:37] you know the will of God you don't care
[1:57:39] about what anyone else is
[1:57:42] saying am I preaching to a Believer
[1:57:45] today you stand with God's
[1:57:48] word if you don't sign here
[1:57:52] never get a job if the Holy Spirit and
[1:57:55] the conviction of God in you says
[1:57:59] no stand with your
[1:58:02] conv everybody does it I will have you
[1:58:06] no
[1:58:06] friends I am not everyone I am not
[1:58:10] everybody I Will Not Bow I will not Bend
[1:58:14] I will believe in
[1:58:19] that I know he's able to send Legions
[1:58:23] Jesus said like that so Jesus knew the
[1:58:26] three Hebrew
[1:58:27] children knew not they
[1:58:31] presumed they thought they knew God is
[1:58:34] able to
[1:58:35] save but there is something a
[1:58:39] Believer there is something you get
[1:58:41] within
[1:58:42] you that gives you listen a
[1:58:48] piece Beyond Reasonable Doubt
[1:58:55] that God is
[1:58:57] faithful now when you have that
[1:59:00] piece it is
[1:59:03] tangible no one can see it you two can
[1:59:07] see it but you can feel
[1:59:09] it it's a
[1:59:12] conviction that's why faith is
[1:59:15] personal we cannot have Collective
[1:59:18] Faith you must have faith
[1:59:22] to believe in in God for your desires
[1:59:26] you as an
[1:59:31] individual
[1:59:33] Jesus said he's able my father is able
[1:59:35] to
[1:59:38] present
[1:59:40] presently not in the future now
[1:59:44] present is able to give me more than 12
[1:59:49] Legions but how then shall the scripture
[1:59:52] be
[1:59:54] fulfilled that thus it must
[1:59:58] be in that same hour Jesus said to the
[2:00:03] multitudes are ye come out as against a
[2:00:05] thief with swords and with stabes and
[2:00:07] for to take me I sat daily with you
[2:00:09] teaching in the temple and he laid no
[2:00:11] hold on me but but all this was done
[2:00:14] that the scriptures of the prophets
[2:00:16] might be fulfilled that that then all
[2:00:18] the disciples forsook him and fled amen
[2:00:25] what I'm
[2:00:27] hearing I feel that when I speak them
[2:00:30] they don't come out listen care I'm not
[2:00:33] saying I know you are listening with
[2:00:34] your ear but I want you to open your
[2:00:39] spiritual listen this was done that the
[2:00:43] scriptures might be
[2:00:47] fulfilled the disciples they couldn't
[2:00:51] understand
[2:00:52] why
[2:00:53] Jesus had to
[2:00:57] accept I believe most of them
[2:01:00] believe that is powerful and indeed he
[2:01:03] was they believed
[2:01:07] Supernatural they had seen certain
[2:01:09] things in his
[2:01:11] ministry they had seen him heal the sick
[2:01:14] they had seen him deliver the
[2:01:16] bound you know the lamb would
[2:01:19] walk you know the Sinners were for
[2:01:22] they had seen lives
[2:01:25] change they had seen the Mad people
[2:01:29] coming now these people came listen
[2:01:31] Church they came to a
[2:01:34] place whereby they now believe this man
[2:01:37] can do
[2:01:42] anything
[2:01:44] anything they had seen they had tested
[2:01:48] and they knew that the
[2:01:49] Lord they never
[2:01:53] expected him to
[2:01:55] submit to this
[2:01:58] problem told it is the will of
[2:02:01] God and they that had laid hold on Jesus
[2:02:04] led him away that's why when they saw
[2:02:06] this they ran away they took
[2:02:10] off they took
[2:02:12] off but remember there is one who had
[2:02:14] promised he will be with
[2:02:18] him praise the name of the Lord we shall
[2:02:22] see also about
[2:02:23] him where Brethren follow

[2:03:19] but Peter followed him a far off unto
[2:03:22] the high priest's Palace and went in and
[2:03:24] sat with the servants to see the end now
[2:03:27] the chief priests and elders and all the
[2:03:29] councel sld false witness against Jesus

[2:07:14] pressure and then Peter before and
[2:07:16] during the
[2:07:19] pressure brother B the
[2:07:23] church he said as job said he put
[2:07:26] strength in
[2:07:29] US you see he himself
[2:07:32] suffered he learned obedience by the
[2:07:35] things which he had
[2:07:38] suffered he's talking about Jesus he was
[2:07:41] actually made perfect by the things
[2:07:43] which he
[2:07:46] suffered Hebrews
[2:07:48] 58 though he were a son
[2:07:52] yet he learned obedience by the things
[2:07:54] which he
[2:07:56] suffer and being made
[2:08:00] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[2:08:06] salvation and to all of them that obey
[2:08:11] him that's why according to what I
[2:08:13] preach on
[2:08:15] Wednesday the Believers of this message
[2:08:18] don't follow a man or man
[2:08:22] we follow the word and the Holy
[2:08:24] Ghost we obey the word the man is
[2:08:28] speaking according to the word obey
[2:08:33] him if the man is speaking according to
[2:08:36] his
[2:08:37] ideas then you know what to
[2:08:40] follow follow the word follow the Holy
[2:08:44] Ghost because the Holy Spirit cannot say
[2:08:46] anything away from the
[2:08:50] word praise the the name of the Lord in
[2:08:53] a plain
[2:08:55] language the very character of
[2:08:59] Jesus was perfected by
[2:09:03] suffering
[2:09:05] amen and according to Paul he was left
[2:09:10] he has left his
[2:09:13] church a measure of
[2:09:17] suffering that they they too
[2:09:21] by their faith in
[2:09:25] God while suffering for
[2:09:28] him would come to a place of
[2:09:36] perfection why did he want
[2:09:39] this James 1:2 my brethren count it all
[2:09:46] joy when you fall into diverse
[2:09:50] tempations no

[2:10:32] it's going to be
[2:10:34] easy he a
[2:10:37] liar that's why there are songs we don't
[2:10:39] sing as
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:46] Believers going to heaven have you heard
[2:10:48] of that song
[2:10:49] before we don't sing that song
[2:10:52] is a lie of the
[2:10:55] devil that's why they tell them if
[2:10:58] you're poor it means you're
[2:11:00] C if things are not wealth means
[2:11:03] you that's a lie of the
[2:11:05] devil you can be very

[2:13:46] it as if it's meaning money
[2:13:49] no someone can be totally poor but yet
[2:13:52] having the riches in
[2:13:55] Christ and to be poor is a
[2:13:58] choice it's not that God made you to be

[2:14:30] millionaire and I think I'm Sher than
[2:14:32] most of
[2:14:34] them I'm looking at that because my mom

[2:14:38] there but but we chose to serve God some
[2:14:45] of us we decided to go into Ministry
[2:14:49] fully but also minist we are
[2:14:53] successful we are not failur no we are
[2:14:56] not amen so whatever you decide to
[2:15:00] do with all

[2:15:11] refusing you just want to always be
[2:15:13] there pitting
[2:15:16] yourself God wants you to
[2:15:18] prosper accept it of you must leave this
[2:15:22] church Sunday morning you go look for
[2:15:27] job how can you be
[2:15:29] 25 and you are still asking food from
[2:15:32] your
[2:15:32] father from your mother it is a
[2:15:38] shame it's a
[2:15:40] shame it is a
[2:15:45] shame my mother is say if I she will
[2:15:48] lift up a hand
[2:15:51] I left a house when I was 13
[2:15:54] years 13 10 +
[2:15:58] 3 and I started Living with the bishop I
[2:16:01] left him when I was
[2:16:03] 15 I started Living with Pastor Le I
[2:16:08] left I left his house when I was 16
[2:16:11] 17 and from 17 years I have lived on my
[2:16:16] own and I never
[2:16:18] fornicated and I never stole
[2:16:21] and I never
[2:16:23] beg but I used to work with my
[2:16:26] hands using the
[2:16:28] head the Mind God gave
[2:16:31] me until later on goded me and called me
[2:16:34] to
[2:16:36] Ministry what I'm saying there is
[2:16:39] nothing impossible to a
[2:16:44] Believer but now no matter your
[2:16:47] situation God has said count it all
[2:16:53] Jo when you enter into diverse
[2:16:58] Temptation knowing this the trying of
[2:17:00] your
[2:17:03] faith work
[2:17:06] patience let patience have her perfect
[2:17:12] work so you see all of us shall be
[2:17:16] tried but this is not equals to poverty
[2:17:23] someone can be very rich and
[2:17:26] tried in other
[2:17:29] areas although here in Africa when we
[2:17:31] talk about suffering we always think
[2:17:33] about
[2:17:36] poverty but here God is Not meaning
[2:17:40] poverty someone it may be
[2:17:43] sickness and it is a big problem
[2:17:46] to someone it might be you know
[2:17:49] something else
[2:17:51] family problem maybe it's your cross to
[2:17:55] carry maybe your parents abandon when
[2:17:57] you're so
[2:17:58] young and it's a cross to
[2:18:00] carry to some of you it's something
[2:18:03] else but each of us has a cross to
[2:18:08] car that's why he says carry your
[2:18:11] cross and follow Christ why does it take
[2:18:15] away all the
[2:18:16] problems he lets the pressure
[2:18:19] come so can reveal what man of person
[2:18:22] you
[2:18:25] are you see he wants to mold a certain
[2:18:28] character out of
[2:18:32] us and listen without being born
[2:18:36] again without being filled with the Holy
[2:18:39] Ghost it is impossible for you to take
[2:18:42] that trial and testing positive
[2:18:52] you'll just dismiss yourself and dismiss
[2:18:54] God and say I think God doesn't love
[2:18:58] me he has not blessed me like so and
[2:19:01] so you know but but if you born again
[2:19:05] and you are in the middle of your
[2:19:07] fire you will know that you know that
[2:19:10] you
[2:19:11] know the Holy Ghost gives you this
[2:19:16] understanding that I know who I
[2:19:19] am when you know who you are when you
[2:19:22] know you are
[2:19:23] born you are a son of God then you
[2:19:27] understand and accept
[2:19:32] correction you accept
[2:19:34] correction you accept test and
[2:19:37] tri and you go through them
[2:19:42] joyfully without without weing in your
[2:19:49] faith we want to buy our church
[2:19:52] land since we
[2:19:54] started doing the pledges doing this
[2:19:56] doing that they have come
[2:20:00] hiccups downs and ups but we know as a
[2:20:05] church colle we know if the
[2:20:08] lordes we must buy it let me tell you
[2:20:12] there is nothing that will
[2:20:14] happen that will make me shift my mind
[2:20:19] on nothing
[2:20:22] even if the Bank closed and all the
[2:20:25] money we have is
[2:20:27] lost start over what I'm trying to say
[2:20:31] if you know that you know this is the
[2:20:33] vision the goal God has given to you to
[2:20:38] accomplish another person will not help
[2:20:40] you to achieve
[2:20:42] it it is you the owner of that
[2:20:46] Vision you as a man as an
[2:20:49] individual you have to take
[2:20:53] initiative to
[2:20:54] stand and to believe you have to have a
[2:20:59] backbone amen when
[2:21:03] when had a
[2:21:06] back says Adam knew what he was
[2:21:10] doing what did he do he ran to
[2:21:14] her yet you would have just run away
[2:21:16] from
[2:21:18] her you would have said that's what you
[2:21:19] have done
[2:21:21] okay that's up to you me I am a right
[2:21:25] Son of God I will not engage in this but
[2:21:29] he said my wife I am your
[2:21:32] savior oh Hallelujah the Bible says
[2:21:35] Jesus he is the savior of the
[2:21:39] body he is Our
[2:21:41] Redeemer he is our savior that's why in
[2:21:45] the same way a man redeems his wife
[2:21:51] you know says in one
[2:21:53] part that you man has you know
[2:21:57] Mercy on the woman and chooses her for
[2:22:03] wife just like Jesus had mercy on
[2:22:07] us if a man finds a man playing around
[2:22:11] with his
[2:22:12] wife he just give him a knock out
[2:22:15] punch says leave my wife alone are you
[2:22:19] hearing what I'm saying if you want to
[2:22:21] test me try it on my wife that's when
[2:22:25] you will
[2:22:27] know okay let me leave that
[2:22:29] area what I'm saying in the same way
[2:22:33] Jesus fights for
[2:22:35] his the savior of of praise the name of
[2:22:39] the Lord so what am I
[2:22:42] saying are you following
[2:22:45] me you have to know who you are
[2:22:50] regardless of the
[2:22:53] pressure a man's character is known by
[2:22:56] his
[2:22:58] works in the infalible word of God a
[2:23:02] prophet says and a man's
[2:23:04] character is shown in his
[2:23:08] works his character by his
[2:23:11] works we know that just like a
[2:23:15] contractor shows what he is by his work
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:22] for
[2:23:23] instance if we was going to have a great
[2:23:26] building built here in the city of
[2:23:33] Chicago the first thing the officials of
[2:23:35] the City Board would
[2:23:38] do they would try to select a
[2:23:41] contractor just not anyone that run in
[2:23:44] and said well I can do the job all
[2:23:48] right they're going to get a contract
[2:23:50] that's got a
[2:23:53] reputation and now because if they
[2:23:56] didn't maybe another contractor would
[2:23:59] underbid that
[2:24:03] contractor but he would put it in the
[2:24:05] building and bad material and perhaps he
[2:24:07] would build it thousands of dollars less
[2:24:09] another
[2:24:13] one and then we could come to find out
[2:24:16] that the building collapsed
[2:24:21] the first storm hit it it went
[2:24:26] down the storm the
[2:24:29] storm what do you think the city would
[2:24:31] think about that
[2:24:35] contract it would ruin his reputation
[2:24:41] over it would ruin his reputation he
[2:24:43] says
[2:24:46] forever are you following me how do you
[2:24:49] know a man
[2:24:51] by his
[2:24:53] what by his
[2:24:55] what praise the name of the Lord there's
[2:24:58] something I did not put up in my notes
[2:25:00] but I felt like reading it to
[2:25:05] you and I think that every Christian
[2:25:07] ought to take the same
[2:25:11] attitude we want to know where we are
[2:25:14] standing we don't want our Eternal
[2:25:16] destination built upon the shifting sons
[2:25:17] of some church
[2:25:25] but on the etal word of the
[2:25:27] living because remember every one of you
[2:25:29] sitting here
[2:25:31] tonight so many times is going
[2:25:35] to that building you are
[2:25:38] setting death is going to
[2:25:40] strike You' better know what kind of sun
[2:25:43] it is built
[2:25:45] upon oh what kind of foundation it
[2:25:48] has God building the
[2:25:51] Foundation he would not put nothing else
[2:25:54] but the best that there
[2:25:58] is because God is thoughtful of his
[2:26:03] reputation he's a god of
[2:26:06] Eternity he's a god of heavens and
[2:26:09] earth he will never put nothing in his
[2:26:12] act
[2:26:15] plan but what will stand the test of
[2:26:18] time for eternity
[2:26:24] we would praise the name of the Lord now
[2:26:28] what building has it
[2:26:29] built what building has it built am I
[2:26:32] preaching to
[2:26:34] people I am that building everybody say
[2:26:38] I am that
[2:26:40] building Say by Revelation now church I
[2:26:43] believe I am that
[2:26:45] building and if I'm not
[2:26:47] building God is building me and he built
[2:26:50] me from before the foundation of the
[2:26:52] world and he laid the foundation
[2:26:57] properly let me say this God doesn't
[2:27:00] start to
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:10] fail that's that's that was
[2:27:15] striking God doesn't start to fail
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:22] he's the he's the
[2:27:25] Alpha and
[2:27:29] Omega when he
[2:27:32] starts he does
[2:27:36] what who am I I'm a building of
[2:27:41] God I may not be perfect
[2:27:44] yet he is working on
[2:27:48] me but he's not going to f
[2:27:51] the moment he
[2:27:56] started he started on
[2:27:58] me he must
[2:28:01] accomplish everything I was meant to
[2:28:05] be but I will tell you what I was not
[2:28:07] meant to be I was not meant to be a
[2:28:11] failure I was not meant to be a
[2:28:14] beggar I was not meant to be you know
[2:28:17] one of these cheap people
[2:28:20] let me announce to you I am not cheap
[2:28:23] you are not cheap no you are not
[2:28:27] whatever God Invision you to
[2:28:29] be is what you are not what somebody
[2:28:34] else said you would be but what God
[2:28:37] said that's why when Temptation comes to
[2:28:40] me I jack up my head I say I am not that
[2:28:45] I cannot stoop so long I Am What God
[2:28:49] envisioned me to be
[2:28:51] whatever you envision me that I must be
[2:28:56] because God is a god of
[2:29:00] Eternity amen hallelujah hallelujah I am
[2:29:04] not preaching about someone
[2:29:06] else I'm preaching about you I'm
[2:29:09] preaching about
[2:29:14] me praise God a man's character is shown
[2:29:19] in his works
[2:29:23] God is
[2:29:26] character God character he shown his
[2:29:31] work I am the work of
[2:29:35] God you got it I am the work of God and
[2:29:40] the way I'm going to end
[2:29:42] up will show God his
[2:29:45] character but I'll tell you what God is
[2:29:49] God is not a failure
[2:29:51] God is all
[2:29:52] powerful God does the
[2:29:55] impossible God is
[2:29:57] faithful God never
[2:29:59] fails God is ever present in the time of
[2:30:04] trouble God knows my
[2:30:06] needs when everybody fails to understand
[2:30:10] God understands me that's what my God is
[2:30:14] and because I know I am a work of
[2:30:17] God all those character istics of
[2:30:22] God must be revealed through
[2:30:25] me the word should see me and say you
[2:30:29] are a
[2:30:30] citizen of another
[2:30:32] country you are doing things
[2:30:35] differently how did you do it the way
[2:30:38] believers do our
[2:30:40] businesses must be
[2:30:43] different everybody does
[2:30:45] witchcraft to make it work I believe
[2:30:48] praise
[2:30:50] and pays their TI and it
[2:30:55] works the way we do our
[2:30:57] weddings everybody says can you have a
[2:31:00] wedding without dancing
[2:31:03] music but a Believer does
[2:31:06] it is
[2:31:10] different is
[2:31:12] different why because we are the
[2:31:17] character of God
[2:31:22] now let me take it now as we begin to
[2:31:28] descend in church
[2:31:31] age why does he stand by God stands by
[2:31:34] when he sees a
[2:31:38] suffer he leaves us in our
[2:31:40] pressure and he stands by and
[2:31:42] watches Romans
[2:31:45] 8:17 he says this and if children
[2:31:50] then we are
[2:31:52] hairs I am an
[2:31:55] hair hairs of
[2:31:59] God joint ha with
[2:32:02] Christ if so be that we suffer with
[2:32:08] him that we may also be glorified
[2:32:12] together for I Rec that the
[2:32:18] sufferings the suffer
[2:32:21] of this present
[2:32:25] time are not
[2:32:27] worthy to be
[2:32:29] compared with the glory which shall be
[2:32:34] revealed in
[2:32:37] US unless we suffer with
[2:32:41] him we cannot reain with
[2:32:46] him you have to suffer to rain
[2:32:52] tell that to your neighbor you have to
[2:32:54] suffer to
[2:32:58] rain you have to suffer to
[2:33:01] rain the reason for
[2:33:04] this is that character simply is never
[2:33:08] made without
[2:33:16] suffering have you got it that's why God
[2:33:19] allows us to
[2:33:21] suffer is molding a
[2:33:27] character if you ask you said Daddy I
[2:33:30] want a
[2:33:33] phone Daddy I want a
[2:33:36] phone Daddy I want a
[2:33:41] Bible before you even
[2:33:43] finish Daddy I want something
[2:33:47] else because you know whenever I ask
[2:33:51] he
[2:33:53] provid you even sing songs about it
[2:33:59] Jehovah so we
[2:34:01] believe whenever we
[2:34:03] ask now what the mentality you
[2:34:06] have is the mentality of the
[2:34:09] [Music]
[2:34:13] Millennium and it's
[2:34:16] okay but you have to understand
[2:34:20] while you are still here on Earth there
[2:34:22] is another
[2:34:24] aspect why we to be like that in the
[2:34:28] Millennium because we already have
[2:34:32] character we will be asking for the
[2:34:33] right
[2:34:37] things but
[2:34:39] here we are all sort of we have
[2:34:42] foolishness in our
[2:34:44] head the Bible says foolishness is bound
[2:34:46] up in the heart of a child
[2:34:50] the road of
[2:34:53] Correction will drive it
[2:34:55] out so now we are who children
[2:35:01] foolishness is bound up in the of our
[2:35:04] child so we are children being that we
[2:35:07] are children yes of course we are hairs
[2:35:11] but before we
[2:35:13] become you have to be
[2:35:16] corrected you have to be child trained
[2:35:23] if child of
[2:35:26] God
[2:35:28] be from every now and
[2:35:32] then you will let those things happen to
[2:35:36] you tough
[2:35:38] situation and pressure builds
[2:35:43] up what can I do can I
[2:35:46] disappear imagine if you had the power
[2:35:48] you're going to have in the
[2:35:52] and when you see a
[2:35:54] problem
[2:35:57] disappear and you
[2:36:00] disappear because we shall be appearing
[2:36:02] and
[2:36:05] disappear so God knows if we have that
[2:36:08] here now many of you will not receive
[2:36:11] this
[2:36:13] character many of us so you would say
[2:36:18] father I need a
[2:36:20] you pull out your
[2:36:22] hand you be I need a
[2:36:26] phone I
[2:36:27] need Jesus prayed how many
[2:36:30] times three
[2:36:32] times was his prayer
[2:36:40] answer three times and the B says each
[2:36:44] time he pray the same
[2:36:47] words because the need was the same
[2:36:53] and each time it was not
[2:36:58] answered and after he
[2:37:01] prayed then the
[2:37:03] need was not
[2:37:05] granted but I'll tell you something
[2:37:07] else his will God's
[2:37:10] will was being
[2:37:13] done and as God he was able to
[2:37:17] know as as a man
[2:37:20] listen church as a man listen listen as
[2:37:24] a man he was here
[2:37:30] praying But as God he was seeing what
[2:37:33] where Judas
[2:37:35] is and then after praying three times as
[2:37:38] a
[2:37:39] man as God is so now my will is
[2:37:43] done they are coming told them get up
[2:37:46] get up get
[2:37:47] get now if you want you can
[2:37:50] sleep stop praying let us go because
[2:37:54] they think the time is now that was not
[2:37:57] a man speaking that was God speaking and
[2:38:00] all of us have a man part and a god
[2:38:06] [Applause]
[2:38:11] part all of us because we are Sons like
[2:38:14] he is a
[2:38:16] son we are hairs like he is a hair
[2:38:20] we are joint hairs with
[2:38:23] Jesus and if he
[2:38:25] suffered we have to suffer if we prayed
[2:38:29] and answered prayers we would have some
[2:38:32] of them
[2:38:34] too he was under pressure he felt like
[2:38:38] dying he felt like flying away we will
[2:38:41] feel the same way through it all like he
[2:38:45] was we should be standing firm
[2:38:50] in the promises of God knowing is
[2:38:55] faithful
[2:38:58] amenu and here you see unless we suffer
[2:39:02] with
[2:39:03] him we cannot re with
[2:39:05] him you have to rain to suffer you have
[2:39:08] to suffer to
[2:39:11] rain the reason for this is that
[2:39:15] character
[2:39:16] simply is never made without suffering
[2:39:23] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:39:25] hallelujah I said
[2:39:27] Hallelujah when I was getting
[2:39:30] married I told my mother I was
[2:39:34] 19 I was in
[2:39:37] university and I felt like I want to get
[2:39:41] married and go into
[2:39:43] Ministry it was a difficult decision to
[2:39:46] me I prayed and prayed and prayed and
[2:39:50] God made me know I had to do it you see
[2:39:53] when you have a conviction a personal
[2:39:55] conviction from
[2:39:57] God it's the leadership of the
[2:40:00] spirit you don't care what anybody
[2:40:04] says that's why I understand some of you
[2:40:06] say Pastor that is your
[2:40:08] story we also have
[2:40:10] ours it is true each of us have our own
[2:40:14] story and each of us has our own
[2:40:17] personal relationship and walk with the
[2:40:18] Lord
[2:40:24] we are not here to become like your
[2:40:27] pastor like our Prophet we are here to
[2:40:31] become like
[2:40:33] Jesus praise God at least each of us can
[2:40:36] identify our situations in the life and
[2:40:38] Ministry of
[2:40:44] Jesus and my mother said
[2:40:49] I will put you down and you she's here
[2:40:52] she
[2:40:55] said I was so
[2:40:57] sad that she could not see what I was
[2:41:00] saying but that was my personal
[2:41:03] walk she's a good mother she raised us
[2:41:06] to be responsible C go to school finish
[2:41:09] school get a
[2:41:11] job but
[2:41:14] somehow I was seeing something else and
[2:41:18] I had to own
[2:41:19] [Music]
[2:41:22] you have to see or rather have a vision
[2:41:26] for your life as an
[2:41:32] individual God used your mother and your
[2:41:35] father to get into this world but they
[2:41:38] can never take care of you
[2:41:40] forever they can never lead you
[2:41:43] forever they guide you
[2:41:46] forever they are there to help raise
[2:41:50] you and a child can a parent can raise a
[2:41:55] child maybe for the first Maximum 20
[2:41:58] years of their
[2:42:01] life after that you are someone's
[2:42:05] background you are someone's
[2:42:09] background that's the truth then you
[2:42:11] have to for your own
[2:42:14] life if you read the life story of
[2:42:16] brother
[2:42:18] Bram parents were so
[2:42:20] young Ella and whoever and and you know
[2:42:24] they they they were I think 16 and
[2:42:28] 17 and they had about you know more than
[2:42:31] I think seven
[2:42:35] children a big number there and U and um
[2:42:39] these children all were raised by these
[2:42:42] young
[2:42:43] people and their mother their father
[2:42:46] their father was his father was a
[2:42:47] drunker
[2:42:50] and he Wasing
[2:42:52] alcohol so he was Raising that of
[2:42:57] family but when he became of age when
[2:43:00] did he become of age for God to be able
[2:43:03] to trust
[2:43:05] him anyone knows the
[2:43:10] age
[2:43:12] seven how old are
[2:43:15] you do you know the vision of God for
[2:43:17] your life
[2:43:21] but got to know his
[2:43:24] vision received it at s years that's
[2:43:28] when the angel of the Lord
[2:43:30] came and told him the purpose why he was
[2:43:34] born Never Smoke never drink never
[2:43:38] defile your body in any way there is a
[2:43:41] work for you to
[2:43:42] do when you get
[2:43:45] older from that age he had a sudden
[2:43:49] relationship with
[2:43:52] God 10 20 he grew he went on he even
[2:43:57] join a
[2:43:59] denomination Baptist Church but right
[2:44:02] there God will still meet him he himself
[2:44:06] had to make his
[2:44:08] choice to either stand the Baptist
[2:44:11] Church God never came down and told him
[2:44:16] hey move away from here
[2:44:19] no God never does things like
[2:44:22] that do you know why there some people
[2:44:25] have
[2:44:26] met who have wrong
[2:44:29] Spirits thinking they have a spirit of
[2:44:32] God it's um religious
[2:44:36] Spirits enticing
[2:44:38] Spirits they said they don't do anything
[2:44:40] unless God tells
[2:44:43] them they think it's a spirit of God but
[2:44:46] it is not these are people
[2:44:50] brother would you please come and we
[2:44:52] have a Bible
[2:44:54] study I have to first listen
[2:44:58] to the other day I gave one of them a
[2:45:01] book a message book told them brother CU
[2:45:06] I felt they needed
[2:45:08] it said go read
[2:45:10] it he said after a while he called
[2:45:14] me now the Holy
[2:45:16] Spirit has told me not to read it
[2:45:21] he has told me only to stick and read
[2:45:23] the
[2:45:24] [Music]
[2:45:30] Bible yes think about it it's not the
[2:45:33] holy spirit it's an enticing
[2:45:38] Spirit which think makes You Think You
[2:45:40] Are
[2:45:41] Holy you don't need to hear from God on
[2:45:44] everything you do
[2:45:52] if that is
[2:45:54] so then we are
[2:46:00] dummies it doesn't have its own
[2:46:03] will it goes whever the owner takes
[2:46:07] it we are not that way God created us to
[2:46:12] be another
[2:46:14] God like
[2:46:17] him to have our own
[2:46:20] will no creature is like
[2:46:23] us we have the power of fre
[2:46:28] [Music]
[2:46:30] agency no one should dictate your
[2:46:36] life gave you the testimon
[2:46:39] EP against everyone's
[2:46:44] advice even me I could not sincerely
[2:46:47] advise him to do what he did
[2:46:51] because I know the Holy Spirit sometimes
[2:46:52] leads people differently I did not
[2:46:54] advise him against
[2:47:00] it he made up his
[2:47:03] mind to move from his the comfort of his
[2:47:06] home man about
[2:47:09] 1920 leave his parents leave a place
[2:47:13] where he could get a good job and earn
[2:47:14] good
[2:47:17] money go all the way
[2:47:20] into another city which is Lesser City
[2:47:23] of the
[2:47:26] other he cannot get a good
[2:47:28] job but he said
[2:47:31] apparently that God had laid him
[2:47:34] there to do the work of the
[2:47:38] ministry so he called me up he said
[2:47:40] pastor do you support
[2:47:44] me I said I have to bring it in such a
[2:47:46] way
[2:47:49] it doesn't come out as if I'm the one
[2:47:51] who told him to
[2:47:55] go but I also have to bring it in such a
[2:47:59] way that I'm not I'm not
[2:48:04] unsupportive so I told him is God
[2:48:07] leading you to
[2:48:09] go said oh yes spoke a few word there I
[2:48:13] said one more
[2:48:15] question I
[2:48:17] said is it your your
[2:48:20] choice or someone is
[2:48:22] pushing he said it's my
[2:48:24] choice God is leading me to do it I said
[2:48:28] then I'm 100%
[2:48:30] behind you saw on
[2:48:32] Wednesday how much I I I I nearly
[2:48:37] cried when I saw orders about more than
[2:48:40] 10
[2:48:43] preachers some old enough to be his
[2:48:45] grandfather
[2:48:49] some are
[2:48:51] Bishops in the denominational
[2:48:53] church he the young man
[2:48:59] baptized why and he has several
[2:49:03] churches all under his
[2:49:07] ministry I couldn't believe my
[2:49:10] eyes
[2:49:14] like I couldn't believe my
[2:49:16] eyes but where did this come
[2:49:19] from from a
[2:49:21] choice from a
[2:49:25] decision friends we are independent
[2:49:29] human
[2:49:33] beings that God has to independently
[2:49:37] work on our
[2:49:43] character to mold us but even then we
[2:49:47] are supposed to make decisions
[2:49:48] [Music]
[2:49:51] about our
[2:49:54] life using the power of free moral
[2:50:00] agents turn to your neighbor tell them
[2:50:02] you must be a decision
[2:50:08] maker some people fear making
[2:50:11] decisions because they fear the
[2:50:13] outcome I don't fear outcomes of my
[2:50:17] decision even in decision has
[2:50:22] outcomes so make a decision on how you
[2:50:26] want your life to be or where you want
[2:50:29] to go never allow anyone to make a
[2:50:32] decision for
[2:50:36] you and especially when you are under
[2:50:40] pressure because you see
[2:50:42] pressure many times will make you make
[2:50:45] wrong
[2:50:47] decisions sometimes you
[2:51:01] angry I shouldn't have bat
[2:51:07] him I'm
[2:51:09] sorry the damage has already been
[2:51:14] C am I preaching to someone
[2:51:20] I will finish now but give me 20 more
[2:51:25] minutes you have to suffer to
[2:51:28] rain the reason for this is that
[2:51:31] character simply is never made without
[2:51:36] suffering character is a victory not a
[2:51:41] gift a man without character can't rain
[2:51:44] because power apart from character is
[2:51:47] satanic
[2:51:58] power apart from character is satanic
[2:52:02] power apart from character is
[2:52:06] satanic a man without
[2:52:08] character is not fit to rain but yet we
[2:52:12] are
[2:52:13] created to be
[2:52:15] what God bless you Kings and Priests
[2:52:19] I am a
[2:52:21] king king over what king in my own
[2:52:25] territory I rule over
[2:52:27] demons I rule over spirits and I rule
[2:52:30] over my life I do not allow the enemy to
[2:52:34] take me where I don't want to
[2:52:37] go you know brother brother Gary had an
[2:52:41] accident and you know he
[2:52:44] lims so we were
[2:52:47] somewhere and uh you know there were two
[2:52:50] options I told him brother let us go to
[2:52:52] the
[2:52:54] escalator no he said no no no I have to
[2:52:57] use the
[2:52:58] stairs and I said why he said because I
[2:53:01] have to tell this
[2:53:03] body who is in
[2:53:06] control brethren we have to tell the
[2:53:09] devil who is in
[2:53:11] control we have to tell ourselves who is
[2:53:14] in
[2:53:14] control do not allow the devil and the
[2:53:17] body to dictate what you should
[2:53:22] do sometimes you are under
[2:53:24] pressure from your body to do
[2:53:27] something but you have to tell your body
[2:53:29] look I am a king I have to rule over you
[2:53:34] but you cannot do that without
[2:53:38] character to get character you cannot
[2:53:42] pray oh God give me
[2:53:44] character God gives you character
[2:53:46] through suffering
[2:53:50] if you're suffering with something right
[2:53:53] now God is going to lift you
[2:53:57] up God is going to promote
[2:53:59] you why promotion comes through
[2:54:10] suffering power with character is fit to
[2:54:14] rule
[2:54:19] and since we he wants us to share even
[2:54:22] his throne on the same basis that he
[2:54:28] overcame and he sat down in his father's
[2:54:32] Throne then we have to
[2:54:34] overcome to sit with
[2:54:37] him what is to overcome to overcome is
[2:54:41] to suffer and then leave after the
[2:54:43] suffering
[2:54:56] some of you your sufferings are more
[2:54:58] than
[2:55:01] others sometimes you even wonder who
[2:55:04] chicken
[2:55:05] I am I suffering
[2:55:08] more don't
[2:55:11] brother is preparing something for
[2:55:14] you the you suffer
[2:55:18] God lifts you
[2:55:20] up because after
[2:55:23] suffering there is
[2:55:25] raining hallelujah amen oh
[2:55:31] my listen
[2:55:34] church he wants us to sit with
[2:55:37] him and a little temporary
[2:55:41] suffering we got through
[2:55:44] now is not worth to be compared to the
[2:55:47] trem Glory that will be revealed in us
[2:55:51] when he
[2:55:58] comes oh what Treasures are laid
[2:56:02] up oh the treasure that are laid up for
[2:56:05] those who are willing to enter into the
[2:56:07] his kingdom through much
[2:56:13] tribulation think it not strange
[2:56:15] concerning the fear Tri that are to try
[2:56:17] you
[2:56:21] that is what Peter
[2:56:23] said is it
[2:56:25] strange that God wants to us to develop
[2:56:27] a Christlike character that come through
[2:56:33] suffering no it is not and we all have
[2:56:37] trials the one who doesn't have trials
[2:56:39] lift up
[2:56:42] your sometimes you can even say God let
[2:56:46] this thing go
[2:56:48] and God said no not
[2:56:53] yet oh
[2:56:55] God I do I thought I was filled with the
[2:56:58] Holy
[2:56:59] Ghost yes you are filled with the Holy
[2:57:02] Ghost and actually after being filled

[2:59:28] time I told my mom when she said those
[2:59:32] words pressure came over
[2:59:35] me but I I kept on
[2:59:38] pushing I don't know what made her but
[2:59:41] later on she is one of the persons that
[2:59:44] really supported me more than anyone
[2:59:49] she ried her
[2:59:51] people because all her relatives have
[2:59:54] some
[2:59:55] money so we came together
[2:59:58] and gave me
[3:00:00] money and I had my
[3:00:04] ceremony and for 12 years I've been
[3:00:07] enjoying life with my precious
[3:00:09] [Music]
[3:00:11] wife but if I had submitted under that
[3:00:16] pressure Where is the
[3:00:21] Elizabeth set
[3:00:23] up she will not be
[3:00:29] here
[3:00:31] pressure a man
[3:00:38] pressure the display of character and
[3:00:46] pressure when
[3:00:48] we I've seen several scenarios of
[3:00:50] pressure God has given me the grace to
[3:00:51] see
[3:00:52] [Music]
[3:00:56] them but I I'll give you three of
[3:01:01] them in this few remaining
[3:01:04] Mees you don't mind this do you is that
[3:01:08] okay
[3:01:12] now Steven is one of them
[3:01:18] Steven the B I'll read portion for you
[3:01:21] here when they heard these things they
[3:01:23] were cut to their heart and they nashed
[3:01:25] on him with their teeth but he being
[3:01:27] full of the Holy Ghost looked up
[3:01:29] steadfastly into heaven and saw the
[3:01:32] glory of God and Jesus standing on the
[3:01:34] right hand of God and said behold I see
[3:01:37] the heavens opened and the son of man
[3:01:39] standing on the right hand of God then
[3:01:41] they cried then then they cried out with
[3:01:43] a loud voice and stopped their eyes and
[3:01:46] ran over him with one Accord and cast
[3:01:48] him in out of the city and stuned him
[3:01:50] and the witnesses laid down their
[3:01:51] clothes at a young man's feet whose name
[3:01:53] was Saul and they stuned steeven calling
[3:01:56] upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my
[3:01:59] spirit and he kneel down and cried with
[3:02:01] a loud voice Lord let not this sin to
[3:02:05] the church and when he had when he had
[3:02:08] said
[3:02:09] this he fell asleep now this portion is
[3:02:12] very
[3:02:13] interesting this is a man who had
[3:02:16] character
[3:02:18] this man had gone through it he suffered
[3:02:21] for the cause of Christ and he reached
[3:02:23] this moment when they're going to kill
[3:02:26] him and you know what he accepted to be
[3:02:30] stoned he not fight them he accepted it
[3:02:34] he said but I know the will of God I
[3:02:36] rather die
[3:02:39] for and you know when he he
[3:02:42] saw he saw what they could not
[3:02:46] see Hallelujah amen I'll tell you what
[3:02:49] he saw he saw God
[3:02:53] standing the son of man standing on the
[3:02:55] right hand of God let me tell you this
[3:02:57] in all these other scriptures the Bible
[3:02:59] shows him
[3:03:02] sitting by did you ever realized
[3:03:05] that
[3:03:08] s but
[3:03:11] here he saw him
[3:03:13] standing what do you think he was
[3:03:15] standing
[3:03:18] he was
[3:03:19] standing because of what his son was
[3:03:23] doing he had submitted
[3:03:26] himself for the cause of Christ and
[3:03:29] accepted to
[3:03:31] suffer for the cause of
[3:03:34] Christ so much that Christ was so
[3:03:38] moved and he got up from wherever he was
[3:03:41] sitting and he stood up
[3:03:52] you know what they call
[3:03:55] standing when does
[3:03:58] something is notal stand God stood
[3:04:02] up because a son had accepted to suffer
[3:04:07] for the cause of
[3:04:09] Christ God stood
[3:04:12] up Steven
[3:04:14] accepted to go under through the the
[3:04:16] pressure
[3:04:18] and his reaction to this
[3:04:21] pressure was very very
[3:04:24] excellent ask you what's your reaction
[3:04:27] to your
[3:04:30] pressure you know I was I read this for
[3:04:33] brother W some years
[3:04:36] ago and whenever I talk about it he
[3:04:39] laughs so I hope he doesn't laugh
[3:04:42] today you know brother bam say something
[3:04:45] very interesting
[3:04:48] Hallelujah in the message of the mighty
[3:04:51] conqueror if if there is anything that
[3:04:54] makes a Christian
[3:04:56] lazy is when you are on a flowered bed
[3:04:58] of
[3:05:01] EAS we don't want it persecution
[3:05:05] enough we don't have it hard
[3:05:08] enough always at the chain is the
[3:05:10] strongest at it we weakest link
[3:05:17] listen to this here it is a man under
[3:05:23] pressure is what he is when he is under
[3:05:35] pressure God bless you
[3:05:38] brother but let pressure
[3:05:43] come now we have known
[3:05:46] you now we have known his real true
[3:05:50] characteristics will show when he is
[3:05:53] under
[3:05:58] pressure get him all Reed and stand
[3:06:03] up then you will see the real man
[3:06:08] [Music]
[3:06:11] coming and I'm preaching to you
[3:06:15] [Music]
[3:06:17] and I've not ended my sermon

[3:06:33] anyhow get him ready
[3:06:37] up get him St up then he will see the
[3:06:41] man
[3:06:42] come you know you see some Believers so
[3:06:45] Believers having disappointments
[3:06:48] disagreements
[3:06:50] rather that's when you you get to see
[3:06:52] people and say are
[3:06:54] believers you see someone becoming very
[3:06:59] no no no no we are not going to be
[3:07:00] played
[3:07:03] with we have to show
[3:07:08] you and shs will be
[3:07:11] all and they will begin bringing f
[3:07:18] the truth I'm talking the
[3:07:35] [Music]
[3:07:40] truth baranda
[3:08:16] praise God
[3:08:18] simply
[3:08:21] because people had
[3:08:26] misunderstandings people don't
[3:08:28] agree and then you show the colors of
[3:08:31] the person coming
[3:08:35] out I want to nail this properly and
[3:08:38] finish
[3:08:40] with we don't want to see you as a
[3:08:42] brother when everything is okay
[3:08:48] maybe before someone is
[3:08:51] annoyed I don't know
[3:08:54] them but when pressure comes on
[3:08:57] them then I've beg to know
[3:09:00] them I watch how you
[3:09:06] react when you begin removing the
[3:09:09] clothes they are red
[3:09:12] eyes the
[3:09:15] fists then I know
[3:09:18] oh a man under
[3:09:23] pressure Jesus was under
[3:09:26] pressure he felt everything we
[3:09:28] feel what did he do he
[3:09:32] prayed that's what a Believer oughts to
[3:09:36] do when your back is against the wall
[3:09:39] when you are confused when you heart
[3:09:42] broken when you under immen pressure
[3:09:45] when you feel like dying go in
[3:09:50] prayer someone writes you a
[3:09:52] message you look like a
[3:09:56] God let me show
[3:10:00] them
[3:10:01] pray I assure you by the time you come
[3:10:04] out of that prayer you will not answer
[3:10:07] him or you look like a
[3:10:12] sheep some say sheep ship is ship we are
[3:10:15] all sh it's
[3:10:18] no if you call him a sheep when he's a
[3:10:20] person is an abuse
[3:10:25] also if he's got
[3:10:28] temper it will show itself if he's meak
[3:10:32] and
[3:10:33] gentle it will show itself put him under
[3:10:37] pressure
[3:10:39] once and God puts his children under
[3:10:42] test to see whether there is any flows
[3:10:45] in them
[3:10:56] pressure are you one of
[3:11:00] them so happy and but let pressure
[3:11:08] come what are you say me I don't know
[3:11:12] the
[3:11:13] man
[3:11:15] brother we saw you
[3:11:19] I swear I don't know the man leave me
[3:11:22] alone but
[3:11:25] Peter your speech betrays
[3:11:29] you you speak like
[3:11:31] them okay let
[3:11:35] me I told
[3:11:37] you
[3:11:41] know leave me alone and they speak all
[3:11:44] bad
[3:11:45] words maybe it's not
[3:11:47] is right
[3:11:55] right
[3:11:57] pressure pressure without the Holy Ghost
[3:12:02] you canot submit to pressure the right
[3:12:09] way and Peter was like that but when he
[3:12:13] met him amen he was
[3:12:16] molded he got
[3:12:18] character next time they came and they
[3:12:21] said you guys are
[3:12:23] drunk Peter get up he said no we are not
[3:12:28] drunk with wine in excess but we are
[3:12:31] filled with the Holy Ghost where did the
[3:12:33] boldness come
[3:12:35] from to stand for the truth brother
[3:12:39] stand for the truth even when you are
[3:12:42] under
[3:12:43] pressure stand for your
[3:12:45] convictions even when you are Under
[3:12:47] Pressure stand for what you
[3:12:51] believe even when you are under pressure
[3:12:54] and God will always bless
[3:12:57] you if you are under pressure and for
[3:12:59] what you
[3:13:01] believe let off that
[3:13:04] pressure everybody is guilty of
[3:13:07] it says I'm guilty
[3:13:09] also you all guilty we do things under
[3:13:15] pressure we wouldn't do do
[3:13:20] otherwise your wife your husband angers
[3:13:24] you just bring out
[3:13:29] something and many of us don't even have
[3:13:31] that nature of going to say I'm
[3:13:35] [Music]
[3:13:37] sorry a man under pressure is who he
[3:13:44] is whatever is in there will come out
[3:13:49] and that's why God let pressure
[3:13:53] happen separate young men from big men
[3:13:57] who is going to
[3:13:59] stand who is going to accept
[3:14:02] pressure and accept to be
[3:14:06] molded David under went the same
[3:14:10] pressure I will not qu
[3:14:12] any
[3:14:14] inel talks about him
[3:14:17] David you know the he was hiding
[3:14:21] somewhere in the
[3:14:23] cave and the man of sa told him oh we
[3:14:26] know where your
[3:14:27] enemies so they came to hunt for
[3:14:30] David and also the men of David told him
[3:14:34] oh David the scriptures
[3:14:36] fulfilled where God said he will put
[3:14:38] your enemy in your
[3:14:41] hands it has been fulfilled your enemy
[3:14:44] soul is
[3:14:46] coming so when he did like this he saw
[3:14:51] him he picked out his
[3:14:59] knife some piece of the
[3:15:01] SK and David I mean s did not even
[3:15:04] know he Hur his
[3:15:07] [Music]
[3:15:10] enemy but after he did it because he was
[3:15:13] a man of
[3:15:15] character he felt
[3:15:17] [Music]
[3:15:19] said God I'm
[3:15:21] sorry who am I to do this to your
[3:15:25] anointed you know the spirit of rumor
[3:15:28] mongering
[3:15:30] rumors and um and you know speaking
[3:15:33] things about
[3:15:35] others
[3:15:37] gossip works the same way if you don't
[3:15:40] have character you participate in
[3:15:45] Gossip because you don't have
[3:15:47] character if you have
[3:15:49] character the spirit of God will
[3:15:52] SM oh I'm
[3:15:54] sorry because you have
[3:15:56] character that's why God allows us to go
[3:15:59] through the things we
[3:16:01] go to mold that
[3:16:04] character in
[3:16:05] us I could preach for more one more hour

[3:23:14] strength I have no strength like no one
[3:23:18] [Music]
[3:23:20] help me Lord
[3:23:22] Jesus maybe wherever you
[3:23:24] are just lift your hand we pray to
[3:23:29] God lord
[3:23:32] Jesus we have seen many examples in your
[3:23:36] word many of your children who were
[3:23:38] under
[3:23:40] pressure
[3:23:43] Peter Paul
[3:23:50] and we have also talked about the three
[3:23:52] Hebrew
[3:23:55] children
[3:23:56] David many of these examples we have
[3:23:59] before
[3:24:01] us some of them and many of them did not
[3:24:04] manage pressure
[3:24:08] well but Lord we have learned today
[3:24:11] about
[3:24:13] Jesus how is a man under pressure
[3:24:17] he was able to be in
[3:24:20] control he was in control of his
[3:24:23] flesh he was control of his
[3:24:25] ego he was
[3:24:28] control even as he said my father is
[3:24:30] able to send a legion 12 Legion from
[3:24:32] Heaven
[3:24:34] ofel oh how Lord we know that you can
[3:24:37] help us in an En lightening
[3:24:40] fles and you send a legion of angels
[3:24:43] from heaven
[3:24:47] but many times you don't do
[3:24:49] that because you want to see our
[3:24:52] reaction like you spoke to the
[3:24:55] prophet you said son of man can these
[3:24:59] bones live
[3:25:00] again you wanted what he had to say
[3:25:04] about you want what we have to say about
[3:25:07] it our reaction to the
[3:25:11] action are we strong enough to believe
[3:25:14] you do we believe believe what you have
[3:25:17] said in your
[3:25:18] word are we going to be men enough to
[3:25:21] take
[3:25:22] it if you said your mother able to take
[3:25:25] us
[3:25:26] through and you have shown us your
[3:25:29] will help us not to worry about our
[3:25:33] lives help us not to let pressure
[3:25:35] consume
[3:25:37] us let us not be consumed by it Lord but
[3:25:41] may we be men and women in
[3:25:44] control because he that is in
[3:25:46] us is greater than he that is in the
[3:25:49] world you would like us Lord to exercise
[3:25:52] the authority of
[3:25:55] son like you were on Earth as a son you
[3:25:58] said peace be
[3:26:00] [Music]
[3:26:02] still that's the same
[3:26:04] Authority that I have that my brothers
[3:26:10] have the authority that makes impossible
[3:26:13] things
[3:26:16] become
[3:26:17] possible that's what we
[3:26:20] have help us Lord not to
[3:26:23] complain but to believe for that's what
[3:26:26] we are
[3:26:27] believ we give you praise and
[3:26:30] honor be with your children Lord as
