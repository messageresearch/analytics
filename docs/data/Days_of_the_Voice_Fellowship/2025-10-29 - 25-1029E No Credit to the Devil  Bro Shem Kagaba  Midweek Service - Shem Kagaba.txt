Oh Lord dear heaven father king of glory this evening father everything in your hands come and take full control father bless each one of us that has ende to come and may our coming not be our hearts burn within us father in the precious name Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. &gt;&gt; Happy to see each one of you. &gt;&gt; As we are still standing, let's open the book of Isaiah chapter 14. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14:24 The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought, so shall it come to pass, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand." Hallelujah. You may be seated. [snorts] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray again. Lord, heavenly father, we approach your throne of grace humbly in your presence. May you father hear our needs. Each one of us has come with their needs. May Lord speak to our hearts. May you design our hearts father and Lord we pray that may you strengthen us. Use me Lord. I'm just a vessel in the in the precious name of Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As you're seated, you can open the book of Romans chapter 8. &gt;&gt; Romans 8, chapter 28. It says that and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God. to them who are are the called according to his purpose. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once again, I'm happy to be here. Thank you for those that pray for the ministers because it's not easy when you're going to minister. get something to talk about. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love you each one of you. I request for your uned attention please as you know I go slow that we get something that the Lord is. So today I'm going to talk about uh no credit to the devil or I don't know if that's the right to the devil any glory for him. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once again we can read that book of Isaiah to me. What would &gt;&gt; the Lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I've purposed so shall it stand. Hallelujah. [snorts] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know it's a blessing always to minister in any way as I always say whether playing any instrument in any way as you still alive it's a blessing and I thank pastor who gave me this opportunity also to stand and pray for me that the Lord will bring out what he what he gave me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we have seen Isaiah here is saying that the Lord has thought something. So shall it come to pass regardless what may come. Do you believe the word of God? Hallelujah. As long as God has thought about it in the beginning can stop it. And then he goes ahead and he said, "And as I have purposed, so shall it stand." And the prophet say that there is no enough demons in hell wherever that can stand before the purpose of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But now remember there is something that I want us to see here that this Bible it is not written for everyone. Every scripture that we read is not for everyone. So this prophecy goes to a specific category of people and that's we see that's the seed of Abraham. Hallelujah. Are you one of them? &gt;&gt; The Bible says by faith we are made &gt;&gt; the children of Abra. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, Romans 8:2 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God." So, here also Paul is addressing to that category of people. He's saying that that to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose. Before the time began, God of glory Jehovah had a great purpose, a very big purpose. But this purpose it is there are people who are attached to that purpose. Hallelujah. When when brother Brham was preaching from his ministry throughout Hebrews 138 was his theme. Jesus Christ the same yesterday today. Why? Because that was the great purpose of God that he had even before the time began. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ the same yesterday that is uh Jesus Christ. the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then today the prophet say that in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. The prophet says that today he's in the bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yesterday Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Today the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow. or forever. &gt;&gt; It is the marriage that [snorts] mean that yesterday it was the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Today it's the New Testament and then tomorrow the Old Testament is getting married to the New Testament. So there is that great purpose that God had and as you have seen that purpose cannot be fulfilled. Unless there is this certain group of people that has come in the picture. Hallelujah. That's why the Bible is written not for everyone but though many read it but it is for that specific group. It's a mystery that God The great Jehovah &gt;&gt; is seeking for a wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of which the wife is already there because the wife she hath made herself ready. So my heading say that no credit to the devil and this and this spec this specifically goes to that group of people of which I believe we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to first see the the position of of this these people. So in the church ages, the sadistician church age say that they already have eternal life and cannot come into the judgment. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you had already have a turn? Amen. 2 Corinthians 5: For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in heaven. I wish I had time to go in detail. Because this goes back to the tabernacle of Moses. Tabernacle Moses, the temple of Solomon, tabernacle of David. And then God promised to restore the tabernacle of David. I wish I had time. But here Paul is saying that there is another house in heaven. eternal in the heaven. The prophet say that something eternal, it is something that has no beginning and has no end. So we the children of God here, the seed of Abraham, our hope is that house that we're talking about. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if that that house and then the prophecy that that house is the real me you &gt;&gt; the real you &gt;&gt; because here we are negatives in the shadows of ourselves. Yeah. Pastor preached about the the the true our true origin. Hallelujah. And and here if if these bodies or if these tabernacles are eternal, it means that the bride of Jesus Christ is eternal. Meaning we have no beginning. Amen. Neither do we have an end. So there are only two things that have no beginning. That is God and his bride. They have no beginning and they have no end which make one. So the devil has a beginning and he has an end because the Bible says that he has but a short time. mainly in this age that we are living in. That's why this age is called uh it's called the evil age. And that's why the devil has become the god of it. Why? Because he knows he has but a short. And the Bible says that all hell powered out. There's no demon in hell doing what? They don't have any time. They are right here. Right here where we are. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They don't have time to sleep. They know they have but a short time. I want God to give me grace this evening. I expose the devil. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. See something. But now this message goes exactly that group of Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's open Romans chapter 9 verse 11. It says that for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, &gt;&gt; not of works, but of him that calleth. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we see here that Paul is saying that before the children being yet born having done any good or evil mean that the child can be born they can do good and evil. Hallelujah. Now here specifically specific he was talking about Jacob and Hallelujah and if the bride of Jesus Christ she's eternal meaning she has no beginning there is somewhere where she come from you see so it means that God now that's when our predestination comes in that God prepared predestinated and he has a movie of this person not for everyone but of this specific he has everything Okay, because this is his bride. First of all, you have to understand the position of this person. You know what is giving us a hard time, it is because we have not yet understood who we are. That's why the Bible say that if the bride understands who she is, my my my can finish the but here I want us to look at Jacob and Esau like Jeremiah before you were born before you even formed I knew you. So meaning it goes way back even the marriage of the of his parents even the marriage of the grandmothers. So God had everything pre-planned. He thought about everything and he hath swn and passed for it to stand that it shall pass. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why actually when it comes to marriage, things become tight. God is serious about it and the devil is also fighting. But it is a great thing than than we think. It's a very big thing because but now it's a big thing mainly only to that group of people. That's why the Bible say that he that obtainth he that findeth a good wife obtainth favor of the Lord. Not everyone. It is only to the bride. The rest you can marry the way you want. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want us first understand the position of of this bride then we can continue. If you look carefully, Jacob was a very good boy at home. Was a worker hardworking than sorry rather than Jacob is the one that could take care of his father. Do this and that. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jacob to begin with, even his name was a bad one. &gt;&gt; To begin with, Esau came first. Meaning he was leading. He was taking a lead. Meaning that the birthight is his. Okay. But how did it end? We see that Jacob took over the end. Why? &gt;&gt; Because God had a movie, God had planned. Hallelujah. Regardless whether Jacob had had done wrong or he had sinned to what extent, but is he of that seed? Is he of that group? That's what matters. Regardless of what, regardless of how many demons that comes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The purpose of God shall stand. Amen. Let's take a look at a priest. Meaning to be a high priest means you have to be a very godly man, a good person, a good person in the society, a person that does good things. And I want us to type with the thief on the cross. The thief on the cross. God had his movie. Why? Not because he was good, but because he was a tongue. He came from somewhere. He's a part of the great purpose of God. So regardless of what you have done, first stop there. Romans 8. 28 say, "And we know all things work together for good them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So everything works together for good. Even if it's bad, how how much ugly it looks But if you are of th those people, God turns it. There is a filter that whether good or bad. It will have to be good. And let me tell you this bride, God trusts her a lot. &gt;&gt; And we are in the age where she's coming to the full adoption meaning she can have the same authority as the son. Hallelujah. Because these two people they are eternal. They came from somewhere. You you you didn't just come to existence when you were born. You were there before time began. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Only that like how Haga says that we are sealed in these houses. We are sealed. So sometimes it's hard to, you know, it's like a baby in the mother's womb. She's sealed within that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So at some point she can see some light through and see and see as if there is a world somewhere that is better than where I am. So even if you send preachers there in the womb and they preach this baby from morning to evening that there is a world where you can run and no sleep where you can stretch and it takes faith for this child to believe. [laughter] Are you for real that world? [clears throat] So do you believe that we in the womb? That's what hagger says. We are sealed in these houses in this tabernacle. So at some point sometimes God gives us grace and you see through just a small light. and you can penetrate and see. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so everything works together for good. So, this thief on the cross, he had to be a thief for him to be saved. Hallelujah. We had to break people's houses, people's homes regardless, &gt;&gt; but nothing was shocking God. Hey, God had a film already. And let me tell you this, God watched your movie. He first played it very well and he watched it even before he created Adam. Hallelujah. So we see that if if this thief didn't go and steal and do these wrong things, he would have missed the cross. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you understand that when the scripture say that everything works together and is for a certain group of people because we see that there was another thief on the cross. There was another thief. So whatever befall him, God doesn't care. God only cares for his own. Hallelujah. That's why the book of Revelation says that four angels stretching forth the corners of the of the of the world holding the winds. Why? Because of the elect. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But once the elect is out, Whatever happens to them, God doesn't care. Okay? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now you understand why the prophet says that a man that is not born again. There's not any difference with the beast. Why? Why did he say the beast? Because of the serpent. The serpent was the beast. Okay. So the only hope that we have what excites our heart it is because we didn't just start from Edel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Way back. Hallelujah. Amen. And he he was a good person but he missed it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All things works together for good. &gt;&gt; Let us first look at Rachel's trouble. Rachel, Jacob's Jacob's wife. He said that Genesis chapter 20 29 years Verse 31, &gt;&gt; it says that and when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know the story very well. Rachel is not that Jacob beloved. She was the wife. So Leah was by the way. That's why you see even later on the prophet comes and say that there is a voice in Rama, a cry, &gt;&gt; lamentation. Rachel weeping for her children, not Leah. Okay. Now, I want you to see here something that Rachel, he was, let's say, like her future was bright. Okay. M &gt;&gt; because they are married even if they are two she's loved and she's a woman with the right hallelujah her husband but now there's something here that happened all of a sudden she became barren and Leah was giving birth So who made her bar? Who has her movie? Is someone with her movie? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand because now for them it was another day. But for us, we have the light of the message. We are the final people. We are you know the union of the bride. Hallelujah. So for us we are expected to see beyond Rachel to see beyond her. But I want you to imagine just bring it to the normal way of life. First imagine what was going in between those people. You know the Bible says that they they strove they [clears throat] were against each other. Why? Because Leah was giving birth son after son and is not giving birth. So maybe as we're going to see here She was like, "God has forsaken me." But I want to see something. God was watching. And regardless whether good or bad, it has to come out when it's good. How much ugly it is. So Leah went on gave birth to Rob. She was happy. She gave birth to Simeon Judah and so on and all the maids were giving birth when is not giving birth. What is the reason behind it? Because now he we at the opening of the seals we can see what the reason that was behind it. Who closed her womb? Was it God? Genesis 30 verse one. Say that. And when Rachel saw that she she bear Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob, "Give me children or else I die." &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; This is a very good type. &gt;&gt; I believe you have ever been in a situation or maybe there is someone that is going through a situation. Have you ever been somewhere and you feel like I wish I can leave this world? I wish I can just rest. Because you see when everything is just against you, I want to understand what Rachel was facing. It was something that you can't just handle. It was something that you can't just handle. First of all, she was embarrassed before people. She was losing her husband. Maybe maybe she was going through depression, maybe people talking about her until she had to face Jacob, her pastor, telling him that if I don't see the fruits or else I die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen what Jacob replied. And Jacob's anger was kind of against Rachel. And he said, "A mine God stayed hath withheld from thee the fruit of of the womb." So Jacob as a prophet he could see that this is God's doing. Hallelujah. So it it is God from the beginning that closed. So everything there is a reason behind it to them that accord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So she stressed the man of God until the man of God of God became angry. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Maybe some situation has happened in your life and maybe pastor pastor something is not going well. Something is not moving. Something's not happening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you the seed of Abraham? Someone has your movie. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's someone having your movie. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh let's first look at this God's great purpose. You can jump the same chapter 30 to 22nd verse. Now and God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her. and opened H. So he's the one that closed it. Why is he opening this? And the Bible say that God unto Rachel. It means that Rachel was crying day and night. She was on her knees crying. I want us first understand these times and season when God opened her womb. This is when Jacob had 10 sons. It's funny when you can't ask any denomination why did God close riches womb and they answer you but because of the opening of the se and the precious message that we have received we can run through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll give you the reason here. &gt;&gt; Uh 37 chapter 37:3 says that now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of this old age. and he made him a court of many colors. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the Bible is saying the reason why Jacob loved Jacob more than all of them. It is because Jacob was of old age. So there is a hidden love in Jacob, a different kind of love that had to be expressed at his audience. So when you look at the scenario of Rachel and Leah, it looks like Leah was winning and Rachel everything is fake. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But because she was the seed of God, &gt;&gt; because she's the people that I'm talking about, everything had to come out good. So I want you to imagine if Joseph came first in the position of Robin. meaning that the father would have not loved him to this extent and also meaning that they would have not sold him. Okay. And this is part of God's great purpose. My brother can give me this. So Joseph was the 11th, &gt;&gt; okay? &gt;&gt; At the time when his father was old and for for this kind of love that was hidden in Jacob to be expressed and I I think now you can see where I'm going, right? Hallelujah. Are we together? Hallelujah. Are we together? Are we there? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; Joseph was the 11th &gt;&gt; from Robin. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the time when God opened the womb of Rachel, &gt;&gt; this is the time when Jacob was of old age. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he has gray white hair. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a such kind of love that was hidden that was to be expressed at the 11th son. Praise the Lord. So here here the prophet comes and says we the bride the bride age here we are the 11th hour bride. And you see Jesus gave this parable in Matthew of the workers that were working in the vine. And when he came to the 11th hour workers They came and they worked just for one house. Hallelujah. Just one house. And then the prophet in the opening, I mean in the preaching of church ages, he says. Uh he says that is the shortest time is the shortest work. Quick work. just one hour. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here the Bible says in the book of Matthew 24, you read that they all receive the same pay, even those that were hit by the heat of the day since morning. And then this the 11th hour worker came in and they just finished. They finish with the cap stone. Praise the Lord. Amen. And they were given the same. And then the prophet says because the Bible says that they were given the same penny. And the prophet say this penny it is the same Holy Ghost. It is the same salvation. And that's why we need to be restored back. And that's why we need the prophet. This is Revelation 10. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where the night angels descended. The seven angels in constellation and they formed this. Okay. It's a it's a supernatural image testifying the reason why God closed the womb of such that Joseph had to come to at a specific time at an evening hour where this love perfect love the capstone will be expressed. for us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now we see also that because that his father loved him so much he gave him coat of many colors. And this quot of many colors well I will not go there. Let me just my line here. It was meaning something. Now let us look at something here in the message the masterpiece uh paragraph 62 and now Abraham was the foundation of faith let's say it had four foundations the foundation of faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac. The foundation of grace was Jacob. God's grace to Jacob. Anyone knows that. But in Joseph was perfection. Joseph was perfection. Hallelujah. [snorts] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Joseph was typing Christ. Do you believe that he was typing Christ? John 12:24. He said that Jesus is the corn of wheat. He is that corn of wheat. Say that verily verily I say except a corn of wheat fall into the ground it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit. So Jesus who is Joseph he is that corner of it. So he had to fall down in the [clears throat] intera meaning that Jesus is that corn of wheat. So is the bride. She's also a wheat. Okay. Song of Solomon chapter 4 verse seven. Thou at all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee. You see, Joseph was perfect. Perfection. And here God is telling her bride that she she's perfect. And the Bible says that God is taking a church without spot or ring. Without spot or wrinkle does not mean a righteous bunch of people who have done nothing wrong. No, it means the people that existed before time began. It means the people of his name. It means the people whom God have their movie. So if God has your moving, you are lucky because everything that happen in your life, whether good or bad, it has to come out good. Hallelujah. Now never give the devil a credit at any point. Never regret of what you have gone through. This is God speaking to you. Here is saying in first Corinthians chapter 2 verse seven. But we speak the wisdom of God mystery. Even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world our glory which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So this movie It is only God that has it. And there's a way how he plays his game and he hides it. So it looks like as if this is going to happen when it is completely different. And the reason why he hides it because we have our enemy, the adversary. No, it's okay. We have the enemy of our adversary, the devil. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, here is saying that we speak the wisdom of God in the mystery, even the hidden wisdom. So behind every happening in your life, there is a wisdom of God behind someone. In other words, God has a part in it. However, ugly ital which God ordained before the world and to our glory. So this wisdom was there even before the world began behind everything that is going to happen. Okay. Which none of the priests of this world knew? For had they known, &gt;&gt; they would not have crucified the Lord. Amen. So it looked like as if Jesus's ministry has fallen to the extent even the disciples themselves, they lost hope. like as if everything now is gone. But I tell you what, this evening, never give the devil any credit because he has no Isaiah said that since from the time he fought in heaven, he was thrown down. &gt;&gt; Not only down, but in the pits of hell. Meaning that he has no single glory. He has no credit at all. So the prophet say that now he becomes our worker. He's working for us. My brother over there, you can stand. I don't want you to miss this one. I don't have to miss this one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the devil is our worker. That's what the prophet say. He's our worker. Why? Because already God designed it. That everything that comes in bad comes out good. Good good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now here after understanding this what about when people gossip about me? What about when you hurt people hurt you? What about they do you really bad? Would you praise God? Because now remember our difference now with Rachel for us the seals are open. We are the 11th hour bride. The omega bread. Meaning for us we can see beyond her. How about when people hurt you? When people talk ill about you? What will you do? What will you do? Will you go to WhatsApp status and express your feeling? Will you fight back? Will you go on Facebook and post them? Listen closely. If you do such a thing, it means that you are young as a baby, you don't even understand that everything works together. In other words, it is hard to do. That's why we need we need perfect love. But it's hard to do in such circumstances. Then you praise the Lord. Because you be putting more cos of fire on the devil. Actually these things they be pushing you to that great purpose because everything you have to know if it happens. Have they gossiped about me? My brother has hurt me. First ask yourself, &gt;&gt; are you the seed of Abraham? Then if you're the seed of Abraham, then start singing. I'm rejoicing night and day. As I walk, the comforter abides with you. Hallelujah. because he said that I will never leave you &gt;&gt; regardless even when you at the lowest there is a time when it reaches you feel you are cano you feel you are discouraged even in that state he's there he's there watching Lord Now the devil is powerless. It's people that gives him power. &gt;&gt; But I wish you can know the guy we are dealing with. Hallelujah. Well, Isaiah 14:16, they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee that they not even looking at. [laughter] He say that saying is this the man Oh no, you know that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdom. Is this the guy? I can't even see him. Hallelujah. So this shows us that the devil is powerless. Hallelujah. So the prophet says that God would have finished Lucifer in heaven, &gt;&gt; but he didn't. He threw him in the pits of hell. Pits, the lowest estate. He is the guy in the lowest estate ever. than even animals than even animal. And that's why he he has tried his level best to pervert the love of God. And the more he perverts, it goes into filthy. Hallelujah. Because he's in the pits of hell. He's in the lowest estate area. So God didn't even waste his time because he knew he had he has the 11th hour bride and he's going to give him the last. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of course it's it is hard. It is hard because people think naturally we think that the devil is a big guy. But he is nothing. He's completely nothing. I wish God can open our eyes. Hallelujah. You cannot worry again. And after knowing that you are the seed of Abraham, my goodness. Hallelujah. Is this the guy? That made me tremble, that made me miss the service, that made me fornicate. Really, you cannot even identify yourself with him. Hallelujah. The Bible says that the devil is a thief. The thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. Hallelujah. That is the target of the devil. He comes to kill, to destroy, to frustrate everyone. But look, he has no power to destroy. He has no power to kill. Okay, you have known that &gt;&gt; it is you that gives him that power and gives him the chair to sit. But look here if you know the tactics there is there is a brother &gt;&gt; who preached that sermon I think in brother Tim's church if you can see it when men goes to battle before you go to battle you first understand the tactics you understand your enemy. If not, then you're going to be killed anytime you're a dead man. So you first understand the enemy, the tactics. &gt;&gt; When Joshua was leading the children of Israel to go around Jericho, he had to first meet the angel and then the angel gave him the tactics. And Joshua, &gt;&gt; he thought maybe it's u it's the pill of fire because that's what has been leading them. And then he looked he was looking for the pill of fire. He saw the man. He saw the angel of God. Hallelujah. It is this angel that gave him the tactics. of the war. Have we received an angel of God? Have we received the seventh angel? Hallelujah. So let me tell you, it seems you have not known, how much or the level of the message where it is, the position of the message in the bottom. When I talk about the message, I'm not meaning a church. I'm the voice of God. Through the angel. Hallelujah. Amen. But if God can give us grace and then we understand, then we can be able to overcome this command here. Praise the Lord. That's why we need to feed on the message. That's why we need to know if it is the invisible union of the bride what is God's mind about if it is the going beyond the curtain of time. What is God talking about? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you can know all this by listening to what the angel is saying. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If God allows, I will give you the details on that. May the Lord bless you. [applause] As the musicians come, &gt;&gt; brother shalom, you can come and shalom. Let's pray. &gt;&gt; If you have any need, you can just humbly bow your head down. How many believe that Jehovah is here? He is going to answer your needs and heal your diseases. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, dear heavenly father, king of thank you this evening for speaking to us, for speaking to our hearts. Thank you for using me, Lord. We believe that you have tried your best to expose this enemy, this devil, this guy that is giving this headache. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord heaven father, I pray. May you come in the heart of each and every may our hearts burn within Lord. May we get more fire and more zeal to read the word to read the word of God. I pray Lord that may you reveal yourself each day in our life. There is no inner credit to the devil. There's no inner glory. Whether bad or good that we are going through it will come out good good. Nothing catches you surprised. You know better. You have our movie. You watched it even before Adam and you know everything that has happened. Oh Lord, how much more should we trust in you?
