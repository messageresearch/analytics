in the precious name of jesus are you happy yes to be here this evening amen we are going to continue with our segment today and so today i thought i should do a check do a quick check excuse me on each of you to find out where you have reached and what you are reading and what you are understanding and without wasting much time we are going to begin from the brother who is playing the is it a piano or a keyboard uh brother someone rotate that camera and let us have you brother before while you are there or you're running from there so probably just remain there and tell us wherever you are just tell us what you've read so far what is it that has been a blessing to you where you have reached and also those who are online they're coming to you so i think i have not checked i've not done a check of recent to check and see whether everybody's reading we need to know and uh please each of you when i mention you you have one minute just one minute tell us what your right where you are so no nothing like checking and you know no no because of time okay brother take it away right where have you read that brother from the church from from the parliament church age or the you're already in sardis okay fine but tell us from the church edge which we are discussing today only the one we are discussing today today we are still on pegamos so discuss for us from pegamos not from the other ages that are much ahead i think you can have problems yes brother okay from there we go to sister sir lucas can you move that okay one one minute make it count brethren since from the beginning is page okay he was the first and [Music] heart believe supreme supreme eternal invisible who by the way for all things and that's his character he was he was lovely yes whatever he okay so that that's very good sister so you're trying to demonstrate to us that uh you know all people you know what moved you was that in the earth at one time everybody believed in one god another babylonian kind of uh teaching or religion of politics of many gods and that's very true and i indeed that i can see answer your question okay i'll pick you at random sister peace go ahead 191 okay go ahead oh okay even if you don't read you can just tell us what you learned did you say the false act where is that uh this is there anything like force elect can you read that portion hmm so your point is well there's something that i wanted to correct there there is nothing like a forced elect if you are an elect you are an elect if you are a fourth vine you are forced vine therefore the fourth vine is the one who is not the elect when we say elect can you translate elect in your language you cannot brother can you translate in your language what is it do you understand that do you understand about the polycarp now you understand and you say that again you know what it means it means what in another language which is not english and organic this economy but that's english can you explain it in your language if you explain it in your language that is the translation but can you explain who the elect is brother can you tell us what elect is in your language go ahead can you translate first before you explain in your language but you have explained it i wanted you to just give us one word for elect in your language like you speak the same language it's all a tessa okay now can you explain it in your language a bit louder uh okay can you tell us what a elect is in swahili yes what is it of course media means uh the bride but that is another translation but what is elect when you say elect because it can be something you know suddenly elected [Laughter] can you explain can you tell us in your language also yes so can you explain in your language sister what is elect in your language yeah go ahead my sister you can't understand it but you understand why but you don't understand if you don't understand the new language then you know it understood it you know where as you're reading this church age book you must be able to in to understand it in your own language some words which you do not put it if you can't put it in your language it means you've not just not clicked and you must write it as a question that's why i always receive questions because i believe that certain things you come across and you can't understand so an elect ah sister dr have you ever bought um like bananas or tomatoes in the market do you buy everything in the market what do you do you take what you want and finish the statement and and you leave what you do not want you take what you want and you leave what you do not want now what you want can i say that it is the erect you have elected it you want to elect our leader meaning you want to choose from among many you choose one in that way like someone will um you know go in the market choose something leave the others that is how god has elected us before the foundation of the world so we are the elect so sister in that way can you say false elect you can't because how can you be an elite again your fault it is impossible so if you are elect you are chosen from among the many and you are special because you are loved and you are taken hallelujah okay who else am i trying to sample uh brother you you are cheating you are very busy reading again i want people to tell me by volunteering what they read and they want to share with us from the pagan church age that they thought was so outstanding i think there's no one who has told me something again what were you sharing about oh no yes that was a very good one yeah people who used to believe in one god and then uh people who used you used to believe in one word but then later on the other religions came you know but uh somewhere it's about the kingdoms from then okay that a and which kingdom is that brother the roman empire is seen as which made you iron was the roman empire and now the iron and clay means what at first now we want to read the question for us the roman empire of iron was one of his heads appeared actually um is same spirit because to the church all right now you're already leaving your point can you go back to your afraid enough that you you have got the information now remember you're explaining it to someone who doesn't know what you're talking about and you need to make them [Music] make someone here know what you're the kingdom of iron okay fine i think brother from what you are you are saying i am understanding that you understood that you you always saw that there were four kingdoms and that you saw what was the first material by the way before we even continue some of you may not even know what you're talking about what are you not talking about we're talking about a dream of who nervousness what did nebuchadnezzar dream he dreamt a dream and he couldn't interpret it and these ways men couldn't interpret it and then he told them that they should interpret it they wouldn't and daniel was the only one who could be interpreted because he had forgotten it then for the one who was going to interpret it to first dream it then interpret it imagine someone comes to you says i've dreamt a dream it's troubling me the whole night but i can't remember it but i need its interpretation so surely you cannot you cannot interpret it before dreaming it you have to dream it and then interpret it so then i told him okay give me i think a few hours a day or so i'll come back in the morning he came back in the morning after dreaming the dream and receiving the interpretation that is how god got it god godly prophets operate hallelujah amen and that's why dreams they need divine interpretation don't just dream a dream you can dream a dream when you are seeing a brother buddy having a panga running after you then from that day you hate brother buddy you say this brother he is not a good person but that's a dream maybe the devil was the only person himself so don't always take dreams the way you see it and until god has interpreted it for you through his bible ways of interpreting dreams now the man dreamt a dream and danielle dreamt it also and he interpreted it for him and the dream was you saw one giant um what statues one giant statue and in that statue he saw that it had different elements major elements the head was the head of what gold the is the chest was the chest of what what silver then the thighs were thighs of what brass don't call it the brush it was brass then the legs were the legs of what iron the fate were the feet of what mixture of iron and clay it sounds like five kingdoms because each of that element was symbolizing a kingdom and the man of god say that oh king the dream your dream it is talking about the four kingdoms that are going to rule the world before the end the kingdoms of man and of course there he also saw one stone which was cut out of a big rock but that big rock that stone was cut out of the big rock without a hand but it was cut out and that stone came really [Music] they started went into smoldering ring and it was ashes so the man of god daniel said okay what you have seen is a great thing it is talk about the great kings and kingdoms that are going to be on this earth those kingdoms that's the dog and those kingdoms are going to rule the world in great power until the end and then the end will come when this stone comes and hits the stone which comes and it's this statue of these kingdoms of the world means the kingdom that is the kingdom of our god i think there is even a way called the kingdom of the son of god something like that three oh please forgive us our network went down we are now back okay so are we back now can you here so uh my back there all right so i was talking about uh what was i talking about no no yeah and here's the interesting part that i wanted you to hear it's very very interesting brother sam can you imagine that after nebuchadnezzar saw that he was so happy and excited that he said i have now an idea since this is god speaking to me in this dream sending is a prophet to to me also to interpret this dream now that said i've got an idea i've picked up an idea from all this thing and you know the idea which he picked up he said that i think this thing which i saw this vision in my vision i should do make it i should make it and they build this big image by my builders they are here they can build it and fashion it whatever the way it was with the head of gold and i know that the head is me so no problem and uh and then my kickoff so since this is my kingdom everyone in my kingdom must worship this netherlands or me must worship this image so he put up that image and he told everybody to bow down until worship said and we're not just going to worship it we are going to wash this image in style it will not just be a worship like kawaiita yeah it will be a very special wash you know how we say he said we are going to have all the musicians come all the ones that are banging the words the drums all the ones that having a keyboard yeah i don't know if they were skipping at that time all the ones having the apps other ones having the guitars all the ones are having they are doing all the ones having that they should all come together and they will play a very good melody [Music] now as you are hearing it when you hear that kind of thing all of you just bowed down in that style you know it was really amazing you know and it sounds like the music is of god it sounds like the images of god because god has the support you understand so let us worship the moment but there were some three people who said for us we shall not bow down you can buy but for us we shall not bow we shall not bow we shall not bend we only bow to the lord we only worship the lord god that's right hallelujah amen i love that kind of result amen there were young people and as he as young people in this generation we can also make that result that we shall only bow that we shall only worship we shall not worship money yes won't worship money women will not worship popularity we will not worship men those of you sisters will not worship these things of the world but we will worship the lord but there are some people when they smell money just as making of money oh my good lord you just know that they they've really felt it you know you will tell them to do anything and they will do it for you unless i mean as long as you talk about money you know man is involved you know they will they can even read this book in the in two hours if you tell them it is mine you know as long as it is fitting within their their desires you know some people have those kind of gifts [Music] gifts of love of money i don't know whether i should go to gifts but i think it's a spirit a very bad spirit yes very bad spirit if you have it here may it die in jesus name let us give you one more chance to bow down [Music] [Music] but for them they remain standing let me tell you even if the whole world about them for something you remain standing hallelujah having done all stand stand if you can't stand you do not deserve to be called a believer that's right if you can't stand you do not deserve to be called a child of god if you can't stand you do not deserve to be called the bride of christ you're not even you don't even deserve to be called a nomination a passion person you only deserve to be called i don't know someone has a name what are you going to gain from the world the world is only for a little time only a little season and then we fly away so don't let the world take you stand it's my mother hallelujah stand still stand still and see the salvation of the lord and so brother the the kingdoms you saw the last kingdom there was the first thing that was the one of nebuchadnezzar the second kingdom was the kingdom of the the the persians yes the the third kingdom do you remember the kingdom of the persians is the one we read of in the book of esther huh yeah king answers and the rest of them yeah then the greek empire the one of alexander the great you remember that was one of the greatest rulers that the world has ever seen then he was a very young man but he conquered the world you know but you see that they already knew known about it and then there was uh another one that is the roman empire you know all the the emperors of rome that have ruled this entire entire world at one time rome had the whole world in his hands but you see it it was it became as if it was destroyed and it was ruined but you see one of his head was wounded but he said that he did not die he did not die he came back again but as a divine empire how rome is still ruling now the whole world how not as rome but a divided empire romanism and protestantism did you know that the clay is protestatism whereas the iron is the roman romanism you know that was religious power today it is now not the rome the other room with the iron whatever feast that is the rome that is the religious rome today it is operating and ruling the world wild and the rabbi said it is seated upon many waters every nation you go to you find wrong even in when the pope was going to the the arab country here he still had very many members many people came to see the rome even the muslims so the rome has the whole world but you see now it looks like the other denominations are taking over but actually those denominations don't worry about them they are proxies of wrong their denominations they are declared and it sounds it looks like divided but actually those ones are all reconciling back with rome it is those that are going to betray you know the church it is those that are going to the devil is going to use to persecute the the foolish divided into those that the the angry the protestants they are the pentecostals or what they get those ones so we find ourselves in a position where we are not among them that's why the word of god says come out of harmony people do not be a partaker of her sin you see what we talk about the mark of the beast the map of that beast is going to be in operation at that time when rome takes over rome is going to take over again in this end time but it takes at this time it does not come in as in wrong it comes through the cancer of churches the cast of churches is going to be its image the bible calls it the image and like unto the beast it should have the same power like that of the beast like wrong it will be speaking on behalf of rome it will be operating on behalf of rome it will have that same power and that's the world power the last world power then the lord will come so you can see the world power is not america it is wrong even america is the best the bible speaks of america in chapter 13 of the book of revelation but still she also operates on behalf of rome because remember america is the one representing protestantism you know you know all they are they religious revivals of being in america you know and from america going to the rest of the world you know they pay the person for the move of god it seems but all these are going to be proxies of wrong you know that's why even brother banham says that the last pope who will be the beast the devil incarnate who will be an american somewhere he says that and also he says that it will be an american pope you know an american group and that surely you see it closing and actually the current bishop today uh the current pope today is a is from from south america such as from he is from america also so maybe it is him maybe it is another coming we do not know but what we did we see surely we know that everything is working towards the end it's working towards the end christ is fixing to come for his bride and i believe that you are ready are you ready can we now do a little readings from the church edge book uh the figure man church age and once we had i think today whether we finished it or not we are going to complete conclude i will start in the pigment church age today i think i'll take time when the churches open up if they open up and that i will be able to take time and teach on the church ages as well with the whole church i know that many have not have a bit before so we have been enjoying it here haven't we so let us just check and read as much as we can and if you can't i believe that each of you have read it if you have a question from apartment which are not rigged you ask you only have one hour now and so we are going to use it to do that and uh if you don't ask then i'll know that everything is okay you of understood so uh let us get i don't know whether you stop at last time just a subtitle will be fine let's talk about crystal against the church i know that what do we read on the salutation but for this one okay we're about to finish the citation i think there's one part that i want to talk about in the sanitation so i will begin with that one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit can i have that pick up my pen and write as i grasp the pen to write his spirit gave me a map oh yes let me project that for the ones who are on uh what you're going to hear is one of the very very important portions which you should not miss if you miss it you have missed everything oh i need to be sure that the others will hear the audio let me do this again one night as i was seeking the lord the holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write as i grasped a pen to write his spirit gave me a message for the church i want to bring it to you it has to do with the word and the bride this is the message that god gave by the banham direct for the church call it a prophecy if you like and i want you to listen to it very very well okay can you put the screen so that everybody can see uh well i know that you have your books but in case you want to follow this as well here is what i am trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each specie brings forth after its own kind even according to genesis 1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so whatever life was in the seed came forth into a plant and bent into fruit the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bride church christ's seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image this is in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denominations cannot produce this wrong seed they will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the word this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid product the first son adam was the spoken seed word of god he was given a bride to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another son of god but she fell she fell by hybridization she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he could marry her she also had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god and live or doubt the word and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of the true seed of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man-made creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of promise came to the virgin mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest god was made manifest he himself acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin it was an angel that had brought her the message but the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time now let us stand like joshua and caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now joshua means jehovah's savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as paul came as the original leader caleb represents those that stayed true with joshua remember god had started israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church notice how god did not move israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on joshua their leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it joshua you are all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from god and know the will of god and act quickly something is wrong with you but joshua was a god sent prophet and he knew the promises of god so he waited for them he waited for a clear-cut decision from god and when the time came to move god placed the full leadership in joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word god could trust joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this end day the same problem the same pressures take the example we see in moses this mighty anointed prophet of god had a peculiar birth being born at the right time for the deliverance of abraham's seed from egypt he never stayed in egypt to argue scripture with them nor fuss at the priests he went to the wilderness until the people were ready to receive him god called moses to the wilderness the waiting was not on moses part but because of the people who were not ready to receive him moses thought the people would understand but they did not then there is elijah to whom the word of the lord came when he got through preaching the truth and that group back there that is the forerunner of the american jezebel group would not receive the word god called him off the field and plagued that generation for rejecting the prophet and the message that god had given god called him to the wilderness and he would not come out even for the king those who tried to persuade him to do so died but god spoke to his faithful prophet by vision out of hiding he came and brought back the word to israel then came john the baptist christ's faithful forerunner the mighty prophet for his day he did not go to his father's school nor the school of the pharisees he went to no denomination but out to the wilderness called there by god there he stayed until the lord sent him out with the message crying the messiah is at hand now let us take a scriptural warning here was it not in the days of moses whom god had vindicated that korah rose up and withstood that mighty prophet he disputed with moses and claimed that he had as much from god to lead the people and that others shared in the divine revelation as well as did moses he denied the authority of moses now the people back there after they had heard the true word and were well acquainted with the fact that a true prophet was vindicated of god i say those people fell for korra and his gain sayings quran was not a scriptural prophet but the people in great numbers with their leaders went for him how like the evangelists today with their golden calf schemes like korras they look good to the people as cora looked good then they have blood on their foreheads oil on their hands and balls of fire on the platform they allow women preachers let women cut their hair wear slacks and shorts and bypass the word of god for their own creeds and dogmas that shows what kind of seed is in them but not all the people turned on moses and left the word of god no the elect stayed with him the same is happening again today many are leaving the word but some are staying with it but remember the tears have to be bundled for burning these apostate churches are getting bound closer and closer together ready for the fires of god's judgment but the wheat is going to be gathered to the master now i want you to be very careful here and see this god has promised that at the end time malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled it has to be for it is the spirit quickened word of god spoken by the prophet malachi jesus referred to it it is just before christ comes the second time by the time jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled the gentile dispensation will be in its last church age when that messenger of malachi comes he will be right with the word he will take the whole bible from genesis to revelation he will start at the serpent's seat and carry on to the messenger in the latter reign but he will be rejected by the denominations he has to be for that is history repeating itself from the time of ahab israel's history under ahab is happening right here in america where the prophet of malachi appears as israel left egypt to worship in freedom pushed out the natives raised up a nation with great leaders like david etcetera and then put an ahab on the throne with a jezebel behind him to direct so have we done the very same in america our forefathers left for this land to worship and live in freedom they pushed back the natives and took over the land mighty men like washington and lincoln were raised up but after a while other men of such poor caliber succeeded these worthy men that soon and ahab was set in the presidential chair with a jezebel behind him to direct him it is at such a time as this that the messenger of malachi must come isn't this happening in america right now where king ahab is set in the presentation chair with a woman president jezebel behind him to leave you he's right here right here i have not seen it right there look at it there's soon ana set in the presentation chair he doesn't know it's no longer soon that one has now come to pass would sit in a presidential chair with a jezebel right behind him to direct you actually they're saying many people are ready that it is kamala harris that is actually doing the things but not by then because biden is an old man and he's all slow and sluggish and he forgets so easily so people are saying that i actually this camera has the vice president who is behind him doing everything directing him directing the country and the prophet says it's at such a time it is in that generation where malacca must come where the prophet the messenger of malachi elijah must come and you remember that also prophesied that there will be um a a a woman president you see and he said you young people write it down because he knew it will happen in our time because we the young people of that time would still live in this same generation where elijah has come can't you see these things are in prophecy if you people want to play christianity and to joke around continue but as for me i'm going to be serious with my god because if you are serious with god you are rest assured that this when he when he comes he will find you ready when the rapture comes you will be prepared do you know what it means to know this message and you're not going to rapture let me tell you it is the most terrible thing that can ever happen to you because you have had everything you know everything which means you are the person who is not going to take the mark of the beast because you know how can you take the mark of the best when you know joining their systems is giving you the knock of the business and you are left behind and you are forced to go and join their systems actually bottom says it would even come down to where people had to buy or sell goods physical goods you know if you don't have uh this mark but you see the mark of course you get by joining their systems by joining that but then if you're not joining their systems then you'll be kicked out from the uh from being able to sell or to buy even even physical as much as it applies spiritually but also even physically so it's coming to a time whereby the squeeze is coming in but of course it is going to be at the same time when the bride will go and then those who will remain will think it is a it is a you know domino thing that's when they realize things are tough unless you subscribe to be a part of either the roman catholic church or to be a a an affiliate of those that have joined it the council of churches you are going to be tormented and and you you will suffer to the extent that you cannot join because you're not to join it is to go into the lake of fire and bloomstone so you will say well to you your options you'll not be trying to assess your options what options do i have lord and you'll only have two options either you join them and you go into the lack of fire brimstone oh you don't and they kill you they die you die they make you suffer you think you just put a blood through your head no you will die by suffering you will go through a very big time of suffering let me tell you it is good for someone to just kill you and you die immediately but for someone subjected to suffering and torture what would be the purpose for them to subject with suffering and pressure don't say it has never happened it has happened before it happened during the time of the that again we ready didn't we where the women were being thrown into the lions coming together and some sometimes they would they cut and rip their stomach open with their babies inside and they leave them there they have not killed their heart they have not killed anything they might have left them there for the blood to completely get out of them and they die out of what praying and suffering because the point here is we are leaving you here for as long as you have not recounted your christianity maybe when you recount we can run come put it together and take you for sahaja yoga so you will be there once you're suffering you're suffering until the last moment then they they realize that that one is going to die after all then they just said please let their lives just come and eat you up when you have not died but when you are almost dead ah just eat you like that now it might not be done the same way but what will be done in our generation will be worse than what was done because the demons that are losed out of here the demons that are losed out of the river frontless are here on earth and there are very many i'm telling you they're just roaming around waiting whom they will develop but they are going to devote those who will let me left here during the the tribulation the tribulation is not a time for you to be in i'm not trying to make you get scared so you can leave your sin if you want to continue wallowing in your sin but let me tell you if it was me if i were you i would run away from all these things that easily be said to me and i commit my life to alcohol i commit you know some of you say well i've not committed my life to christ i'm not committing my life to anything right now i want to be free don't deceive yourself each of you here and those of you online have committed your life to something yes you have committed your life to something no one can live in this world without committing his life to something no one if you're not committed to christ then you have committed into something and i will tell you if you have not committed it to christ you have committed it to sinking son if it is education it is seeking sin if it is married it is seeking son if it is the worldly pleasure they are saving son if it is those those other things they are seeking sun the only thing that is not seeking sun is christ christ is not shaking it's not a seeking sun christ is permanent are you hearing me christ is permanent his word is permanent his life is permanent in you in me will be real and therefore to you who have refused to commit your life to christ then let me tell you to make it like summarized for you you have a community because if you commit your life to christ you can have education you can have a house you can have a car you can have everything you need for his save christ that he will provide to you everything that you need whatsoever that you desire but the thing that you must do is to do what is to do what how do you do that he said he said believe in jesus christ and accepting all these righteousness committing yourself with you like your life you know whatever you say from today the number one in my life is jesus if i'm going to be involved in anything in this world the question is i'll ask i will ask a question the very first thing that i will do i'll ask a question is it pleasing to my jesus if it is not pleasing to him then i will not be engaged in it that is how you commit your life to him you be like lord i'm going to live for you and let me tell you i'm not telling you what i did do i did this about 15 years ago now and let me tell you god must bless you if you commit your life to him your life to the rest will even be a mystery they can't understand nothing about you because you are living in another world you are a citizen of another world if you say if a citizen of america a citizen of great britain a citizen of these first one countries is highly respected let me tell you an african moving or traveling from one african country to another african country with an african passport will not be respected but if i i i i even if you are not an african it doesn't matter your race doesn't matter your skin care but if you have a passport from america or a passport from great britain and you travel some of these african countries the everybody will just give you that special kind of treatment as if you're coming from man why because to them to be a citizen of that country it means you're a great man a great woman it means that that possible to have that passport you are having it in the name of your country and in the name of your president or your leader so anyone who does anything back to you is doing it not to you but it's doing it to your country did you know that that's why a passport is such a very respected and a very big thing for you to have a passport is accepted internationally wherever you go if you have a passport and you go into a country and you lose your passport you are going nowhere you have lost your identity you you can't even deport you to any many many years ago when they do not have thumb print and things which they can use to check person to check you just go somewhere you know some of these people they will just go go into america go to some of these countries and they ask them where are you from you know they lose their their passport they just flourish in a trailer or something and then they just come up i don't know where i came from what is your name i forgot what the name of your parents i don't know are you married i i don't remember they behave crazy they behave crazy that they don't remember where they came from they don't remember you know even how they came where they are and then eventually they become citizens of the u.s but of course these days they will actually just take you to a by force and then you know take a thumb break off of you and you know facial recognition or whatever they say yeah we got you they just deported back to your country one of these young men that they went to they went to what what country was it this athlete you know was it germany i think it was one of those european countries huh or something i think they eat a lady more for something so it's hard to disappear into the country but of course technology is quite high these days so they called him and they brought him back home they brought him back home so what are we talking about a passport is a very good thing if a country can be respected because of your passport that you have you are representing that country you what's your passport what is it reading what is it reading your passport your passport must be the passport of heaven in the name you know like you'd write the passport you see in the name of the queen of england respect so and so a citizen of this country you know in the name of the king of heaven respect so and so grant him all his desires because the citizen of heaven that's what god does to all of his children if you commit your life to him fully unresolvedly hallelujah he he is in charge of your life he is not only in charge of your life he is in charge of everything about you why because you are a citizen of his country like right now people are locked up and they and they are locked up in afghanistan and because of the taliban taking over power but every country is not fighting for the country of another for the citizens of another country you know i say that the citizens of great britain already many of them already taken out so the americans are yelling and you know there's a lot of shouting in america no let the president you know how can you we should be impeached many of them have been on tv you should be impeached you know removing you from office how dare he leave the citizens of this country behind the enemy lines how dare you do that why are they speaking with all that people because they are also citizens of the same country let me tell you if you're a citizen of heaven even when god does nothing to save you amen the whole angelic realm will be there hallelujah you know and he was crying and that he was going to be hungry than that you know he was crying there you know but i'm saying that jesus being the lord of weather he should have called and enjoy the course just say michael come down with all your battalion let me come and show these people some fire but they never did that all angels could have come down when he was on the cross but about him said that the father looked the other side maybe the angels came to the father said father let us go down and save him your son is dying and he was like i don't want to hear nothing now let me ask you a question if god was so mindful of jesus christ do you think that jesus christ would go through anything without a good reason whatever he went through was for a good reason he suffered so that you can be he suffers but you can be saved therefore if you suffer and you a child of god your suffering will be there but you are suffering for right causes right purpose but what i'm saying my brother and sister give your life live your life for a cause a right cause the cause of the gospel leave for it i think that by the end in the last meeting that we are going to have i think we are going to have to have some of you really make a commitment really make a commitment on living for the cause of christ you know a commitment and i don't think you should wait until then you can do it now amen and make that commitment so i'm going to live for christ the whole world is sinking sound all at the ground is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh may god help us to do that i tell you if you do that you never regret in this life you will watch over every state that you take then in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word john was the forerunner of malachi 3. he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown the second forerunner of christ will sow for the latter reign jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first showdown was mount carmel the second was the mount transfiguration and the third will be mount zion behind the enemy lines oh do you have to shut them into that hallelujah hallelujah [Music] the strange behavior of moses elijah and john withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their messages had been rejected but the seed had been sown the planting was over judgment was next they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so judgment was next i believe according to revelation 13 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead if permission to preach be granted denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot now remember that moses was born for a certain work but he could then lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side all the hosts of heaven will our same body oh it will be our glorious sight oh the saints in spotless white jesus oh i think we should say that again oh the lamb will take his bride glorious [Music] preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and drag the great heart but down there he also up there he also said that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or in the forehead if permission is to be granted hallelujah the reason why i returned back from ethiopia having gone to ethiopia and fully forgotten about uganda but i decided to come back was because they say the government it passed a new regulation and said that if you're going to be a pastor within the country of ethiopia you must have certain requirements that are known as the basic requirements and one of the basic requirements was that you must have at least a training from a theological college and so is there no other way because at first i was using my certificate the ordination certificate but they said no you have to have a training from a theological college and with theological college it means that i have to either join a roman catholic college a seminary at a roman catholic seminary or pentecostal theological college or some of those colleges of course you know that the message uh believers we are not a denomination therefore we cannot have any of those organizational staff because we are called out of those things into a higher place therefore we chose not to be trained by men but like paul we chose to be trained by god himself and by the holy ghost and so and and so they told us that that's what i had to do so i i told that brother they said i'm sorry i'm not gonna do this. so they thought i was joking maybe others are maybe you can just simply go and get by people outside but that is corruption then if i'm going to stay in the country preach because i'm being corrupt on the basis of corruption then my god cannot move i'd rather go back and preach in the country as a visitor than to stay in the country and preach as a corrupt official spiritual official and so i had to leave i couldn't preach so i couldn't stay and preach simply because i don't have the requirement and the prophet is prophesying here by the way these are the things that the spirit of god told him take a pen and what right that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in their hand or in the forehead information is to be granted and how will you get that mark by just joining their things and doing what they want you to do but if you can compromise just a small thing now what is wrong with getting a paper from them you know it's just like going to any university it seems but it is not it is a deception of the devil man he wants to take your soul he's interested in your soul and some of you he will have to find a way to capture you he tried to capture me and i escaped i refuse to accept and time is coming where it is going to be the same thing in every nation here in uganda they also passed a law number one for a church to be recognized at church it must be seated on one acre of land number two the pastor the pastor the one who is a senior pastor must have theological training number three there are many many things there must be a dismember of the association or whatever and these requirements are all going to thin out the bride whereby you will find people and i'm telling you because most of you are young and you will say these things if the lord carries whereby pastors in the message will say it is okay no problem to register and be a member of you know the association of pastors what is wrong with it we still preach the message we still believe the message we still you know so what is wrong with it it seems as if there is nothing wrong with it but has already been prophesied but i'm prophesied about the the wildcats of churches before it even became the world cup of churches he prophesied that there will be one organization which will come up and all the denominations will join it and by joining it by subjoining it by so doing they receive the mark of the beast and he said all of them would join it and when it started the other side which are not judged but they joined it now so time will come when even so-called messenger preachers will do it we'll change such things we're going to to get bible purpose theological papers from those seminaries in order to continue preaching they say we want to continue preaching the message but actually the thing will not be that the thing will be they want to continue to be relevant and they want to continue receiving the money they want to continue because by that time they will have you know you know especially those pastors with very huge charges and you know getting bigger incomes you know it's very difficult to leave such a thing you feel like oh no surely good government you will see them starting ask yourself why is it not starting it now why are those bible colleges not starting right now in the message do we need them why have they not studied why does anyone know why because we believe that god calls a man god equips the man god fills the man with the holy ghost and the man goes to prison that's what we believe that's pentecostal that is apostolic but what is going to happen is time will come when the love of many shall work what is wrong what is your if they want their bible what is wrong with having a bible they will do a bible college it was center of the message yeah they were saying we are going to take the chat ages and we are going to teach you know we shall have our own curriculum in the church ages and then we shall have some it means that we have to have a man on the top right the one who is called the chancellor and then that man will have to be one of the pastors not so so then everybody will have to get a certificate from him don't deceive yourself you're already denomination also by the time you organize that way you already have become a denomination and there is no way you will survive the mark of the beast because you have to also join their associations hallelujah so friends what is it this we are living in a time that is prophesied to come we are living in prophetic times and we have to know what we believe each of you each of us have to know what we believe we have to stand for what we believe we have to fight for what we believe hallelujah amen at least someone young like he would say me i don't care about all the rest me i'm a believer as me we are not going to go to heaven as churches we are going to go to heaven as individuals the bible will not devour did not say that oh now the bunch of the believers will be in one place and then they will all be chained and raptured together they're going to meet the lord in the air they ask about the bottom is he should we gather in jackson or should we come in arizona or in jeffersonville should we should we shift and stay there because when the rapture comes we need to be ready he said no ah god has shown me a place where you should gather get my book hallelujah god has shown me a place where you should gather it was revealed to him by prophecy there is a song here i want to see if i if i i'll get that song by the beauty paul i really doubt whether you can play this song because it is quite a bit it's quite a bit hard but if i get it here in this big song brother brother charlo if you know the song number please help me please help me and say that song number it says that shall we gather something like that huh no no no not that one not that one you see people thought that they can gather in one place where the rapture will find them okay we okay i can't find it but it goes on that line shall we gather intact song oh in jeffersonville [Music] say the bride asked a question you know something like that and said that said the lord has told me where you should gather just gather in christ the lord hallelujah that is why we should gather yes we should gather in christ and where is christ christ is here christ is in his word crisis in your heart christ hallelujah is everywhere among those that believe and fear his name hallelujah so time is coming where believers will try to make themselves our denomination well of course not believers but those who are the shack because the bible well abandoned preached a message and said they're shocked the bride will not be here with a shark yes so the witch cannot be here with the shark it has to be separated as much as you wrap your maize and you know your wrist cannot grow without the shark okay but when it grows up there you have to remove the shark and everything else throw it down in the fire and you take your meat so god is coming back for seed not the sun the sheep the seed will not be here with their shark so that would be the time when they were just gone organized just to continue to be to preach it looks sounds good and looks good we would have to continue preaching this for the fact that preaching you know people say people still need to get saved but by that time time is over racism over mass is over it's his time now to just come and collect his remnant to come and collect his bride do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work he had to go out in the desert and wait there god had an appointed time there was to be a certain pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before god could send him back this is true for our day but what do we have in this our day multitudes are working signs until we have a generation of sign seekers that know little or nothing about the word or a true move of the spirit of god if they see blood oil and fire they are happy it matters not what is in the word they will support any sign even on scriptural ones but god has warned us about that he said in matthew 24 that in the last days the two spirits would be so close together that only the very elect could tell them apart for they alone would not be deceived how can you tell the spirits apart just give them the word test if they don't speak that word they are of the evil one hallelujah i said hallelujah i said hallelujah give them a what now of course we have seen all through we believe in miracles we believe in sins and ones actually we talked about it too as the evil one deceived the first two brides the true bride of jesus christ the true church the first thing that we saw was what they had the pure word of god and then the second thing we saw was the manifestation of the power of god right yes through the gifts and there and all that now without that we know that sure that's not the true church but also we have seen that the signs will deep in plenty and it will even be impossible to differentiate which is which but there's only one group of people but it will not be deceived men and that group of people is the bride the rest make no mistake about it will be deceived yeah but that church is good they will be deceived but they also dress almost like us they'll be deceived only the bride will not be deceived before it is impossible to receive the elect yes and this speech will be so close you remember the other man that brother banham saw in a vision after he had they interviewed them after the anointing had come down one was speaking in tongues another one was interpreting and then he interviewed them each of them as we were speaking to each of them and so one was the pagan almost another other believer you know but today what are we going to do we don't have a gift like that right each of us but what we can do is we have a way we can also design those scripts we give them our wordpress so if someone claims to be a believer give them a what i want to put their lives through the world test them by the world just take that by the word hallelujah is it in order is it according to the word huh let it be he will try to deceive the bride of this last day by trying to get her to hybridize herself through creeds or just plainly turning from the word to any sign that suits her but god never placed signs ahead of the word signs follow the word as when elijah told the woman to bake a cake for him first according to the word of the lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the spirit how can any messenger sent from god believe only a part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of god in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him his words may be as harsh as john the baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture the royal seed of abraham with like faith as abraham's will hold to the word with him for they are predestinated together the last day messenger will appear in god's appointed time it is the end time now as all know for israel is in the homeland anytime now he will come according to malachi when we see him he will be dedicated to the word he will be indicated pointed out in the word revelations 10 7 and god will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as did elijah and be ready for the mount zion showdown many will misunderstand him because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth when he comes against that they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called god's truth by deceivers but this prophet will come and as the forerunner to the first coming cried behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sin of the world even so will he no doubt cry out behold the lamb of god coming in glory he will do this for even as john was the messenger of truth to the elect so is this one the last messenger to the elect and word born bride christ eulogizes the church revelation 2 13 i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth i know thy works these are the identical words uttered to each of the seven messengers relative to the people of god in each age as they are spoken to the two vines true and false they will bring joy and gladness to the hearts of one group but they ought to strike terror in the hearts of the other for though we are saved by grace apart from works true salvation will bring forth works or deeds that will please god first john 3 7 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth worketh righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is james 3 11 dot the fountain sent forth at the same place sweet water and bitter romans 6 2 how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein matthew 12 33-35 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things now if a man is born of the word being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever first peter 1 23 he will produce the word the fruit or works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed of life that is in him his works therefore will be scriptural oh what an indictment this truth is going to be against the pergamian age there stands that matchless one and in his hand the sharp sword with the two edges the word of god and that word will judge us in the last day in fact the word is judging even now for it is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it cuts us under the carnal from the spiritual it makes us living epistles read and known of all men to the glory of god i know thy works if a man fears that he might not please god then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear those words well done good and faithful servant let him fulfill the word of god in his life and assuredly he will hear those words of praise the word of truth was the criterion then it is the criterion now there isn't another standard there isn't another plumb line as the world is going to be judged by one christ jesus even so it is going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he is making out let him do as james suggested look into the mirror of god's word i know thy works as he stood there with the word examining their lives and the light of the blueprint he had laid out for them he must have been pleased in a goodly measure for they like the others who had gone on before were enduring the persecution of the unjust and still joyfully cleaving unto the lord okay so we're going to skip here and go and go to where he says that doesn't denied my faith um [Music] in acts 3 16 when peter was asked how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his jesus name through faith in his jesus name have made this man former strong yea the faith which is by from him jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is jesus name and jesus faith brought about the miracle peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name he's how many things brought forth the miracle come on so what is in which right here and it's jesus and his name meaning jesus name through faith in his name has made this man from a strong and by the ban and then submerges that to say see here it is jesus name and jesus faith wrote about the miracle amen it's not your intellectual conception of the word that brings forth the miracle it is your faith in christ it's your faith in jesus christ and it is the name of jesus christ two things did you know the name of jesus has power yes how many know that the name of jesus has power you know so let me tell you the name of jesus has power never ever use his name in vain some people sometimes say jesus oh jesus please stop using that name like that it's true that is like you know almost like cassie some of you think that it makes you more spiritual it is bad it's bad for example here in uganda here in uganda we have a king his name is donald i'm sure he's already offended how dare he call the name of my king like that if i go on tv like and i say yeah like uh mr ronaldo our king like that they want me to call him his other names his other titles that makes his name so huge and so big and so far lion they have other men named eh all sorts of names martin why are you quiet give us those names yes he has many names right very many names i'm sorry if i offended the brother but i'm sure you're in another family now so even our jesus we shouldn't just recall that name without a reason a cause it has been to an accident even when we go for prayer maybe pray for a sick person they don't get well because they don't have faith in that name anymore how can you have faith if you know that the name is so powerful when it is mentioned something happens but if you just use it every every anyhow that you want time comes when you call when you speak it doesn't make any more sense it doesn't it doesn't bring faith it doesn't click it doesn't raise faith in you then the ministers become so common to you at this time that name by the way was rejected by the denominations they would arrest the believers and send them and they said but as you are going make sure you don't speak that name again because that name threatened the establishment at that time they thought maybe because there was many many stories about that name jesus is not dead and i said no he rose we saw him they tried as much as possible to suppress that thing that he he rose they even had some people there to say no you know he actually the disciples came and stole him from there how can they steal someone who has been in a place where there is even a roman ceremony impossible it was the angel michael who came and removed the stone and the christ came out of the grave hallelujah that presence removed the stone it was christ to remove the stone but they thought that if that name will be spoken people will continue becoming fanatics believing and following up a a man they don't even know exists and if they follow him and they have all their allegiance to him maybe our king may you know that time when you mentioned the head of herod everybody would shake so they did not want another name which is bigger than the name of the kingdom of that plane but that name is still more powerful even today that name is more powerful than any name [Music] the president of the most greatest country that you know oh that name is more powerful that name is even powerful more powerful than any name that you know of called cancer called malaria called a typhoid called all those diseases right those are names coronavirus his name jesus is more powerful at the mention of the name of jesus can you hear that yes affirmation of the name of shall confess that jesus christ is lord so tell for that name is a powerful name and if you have ever if you will ever be prayed for someone touch you and pray and sanction that name is not simply speaking he is calling upon everything that is behind that name and let me tell you all the bank of heaven so the other says we cannot get salvation in any other name but in the name of jesus christ because that name of jesus is a powerful name hallelujah amen let me tell you someone can come to attack me and i simply speak jesus and the person can fall down that's her you people believe it if you don't believe it you're not christians that's what makes us christians they say that they have faith in the name and also they have they have faith in jesus hallelujah in his name and in him hallelujah it is now and in him in his name and in him well of course you have to have faith in him but not in him alone also in his name yes hallelujah because his name is powerful whatever condition is troubling you are rebuking that name use that man hallelujah say the name of jesus i denounced my life i command you out never in the name of jesus he will go when the conscience of evil have been using that darkness better than believers because they are trained to believe and and believers are still just meandering around believing in their pastors more than the name it's good to have a pastor to respect him as a man of god the bible says if you are sick you go there you know pray for you but he's going to pray for you in that name that name is powerful that if i have faith in things that's up to you but here is what he's saying have faith in that name and in him the person oh my i can preach about this for two hours this is so powerful and so rich the name of jesus said that jesus name used in the faith which is from jesus performed that great work this faith is what the lord was speaking about in revelation 2 13. it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the believers romans 12 3 according as god hath dealt to every man according to verse 1 the men are brethren the measure of faith ephesians 2 8 by grace are you saved through faith and that faith not of yourself it is a gift of god and it also says in james 2 1 my brethren notice he too is talking to brethren have not the faith of not in our lord jesus christ with respect of persons in this pergamine age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the lord having cast aside the doctrine of election and opened wide the church door and their fellowship to any and all who subscribe to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of that faith of our lord jesus christ and not only used that faith in acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of god apart from the measure of the faith of the lord jesus himself as today's church is filled with mental believers who endorse the virgin birth the shed blood going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith i live by the faith of the son of god paul did not say that he lived by faith in the son of god it was the faith of the son of god that had given him life and kept him living in christian victory no they had not denied that salvation was supernatural from start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name and his faith and they were blessed by the lord and accounted worthy of him and to pass my faithful martyr there is no other record in the word or in any profane history concerning this brother but surely there need not be it is more than enough that he was for known and known of the lord it is more than enough to see his faithfulness unto the lord recorded in the living word he was a christian he had the name of jesus he had the faith of our lord jesus christ and he was amongst those who lived by it he had responded to the words of james have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons full of the holy ghost and faith as was stephen he respected no one he feared no one and when death was pronounced upon all who would take that name and walk in the faith of jesus christ he took his stand with those who would not turn back yes he died but like abel he obtained a witness from god his name is written in the word and though dead his voice still speaks in the pages of god's divine record another faithful martyr was carried to his rest but satan did not triumph then even as he did not triumph when he killed the prince of peace for as satan was despoiled at the cross even so now will the blood of antipas cry out to hundreds more who will take up their crosses and follow him where satan's seat is the reason that this is part of the eulogy of the spirit is because these brave soldiers of the cross were overcoming satan right in the midst of his own throne room they were winning the battle through the name and faith of jesus right in the camp of the leaders of darkness what a tremendous commendation like the mighty men of david who invaded the camp of the enemy to bring david thirst quenching water so these giants of faith invaded the realm of satan's earthly stronghold and by preaching and exhorting brought the water of salvation to those who lived under the shadow of death now as much as these words concerning the throne and realm of satan are a part of god's praise for his elect they actually set the stage for the denouncement of the evil that has gained supremacy in the church pergamus satan's throne and dwelling place to many these phrases have been merely pictorial rather than truly historical but they are surely real and history bears that out pergamos was indeed the throne and dwelling place of satan it happened on this wise pergamos was not originally the place where satan as concerning human affairs dwelt babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters it was in the city of babylon that satanic worship had its origin genesis 10 8-10 and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and iraq and akhad and kauna in the land of shiner genesis 11 1-9 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plane in the land of shiner and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they had for mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and there confound their language but they may not understand one another's speech so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth babel is the original name for babylon it means confusion it was literally started by cush the son of ham but was brought to a kingdom of power and grandeur under his son nimrod the mighty hunter nimrod according to the genesis 11 account and also according to profane history set out to accomplish three things he wanted to build a strong nation which he did he wanted to propagate his own religion which he did he wanted to make a name for himself which he also accomplished his accomplishments were so monumental that the kingdom of babylon was called the head of gold amongst all world governments that his religion gained prominence is proven by the fact that scripture identifies it with satan completely in isaiah chapter 14 and in revelation chapter 17 through 18. and by history we can prove that it invaded the whole world and is the basis for every system of idolatry and the theme of mythology though the names of the gods differ in various sections of the land according to the language of the people that he made a name for himself and his followers goes without saying for as long as this present age goes on until jesus reveals himself to his brethren he will be worshipped and honored though under a different name from nimrod and in a temple slightly different from the one in which he was originally adored since the bible does not deal in the histories of other nations in detail it will be necessary to search the ancient profane records to find our answer as to how pergamos became the seat of the satanic religion of babylon the major sources of information will be in records of egyptian and grecian culture the reason for this is that egypt received her science and mathematics from the chaldeans and in turn greece received them from egypt now since the priests were in charge of teaching these sciences and since these sciences were used as a part of religion we already know the key as to how the babylonish religion gained its strength in these two countries it is also true that whenever a nation was able to overcome another nation in due time the religion of the subduer became the religion of the subdued it is well known that the greeks had the very same signs of the zodiac as did the babylonians and it has been found in the ancient egyptian records that the egyptians gave the greeks their knowledge of polytheism thus the mysteries of babylon spread from nation to nation until it appeared in rome in china india and even in both north and south america we find the very same basic worship the ancient histories agree with the bible that this babylonish religion was most certainly not the original religion of earth's early peoples it was the first to drift away from the original faith but it was not itself the original one historians such as wilkinson and mallet have proven conclusively from the ancient documents that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one god supreme eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving and good and just but as satan will always corrupt whatever he can we find him corrupting the minds and hearts of men so that they reject the truth as he has always attempted to receive worship as though he were god and not the servant and creation of god he drew worship away from god to the end that he might draw it unto himself and so be exalted he certainly did accomplish his desire to spread his religion throughout the whole world this is authenticated by god in the book of romans when they knew god they glorified him not as god until they became vain in their imaginations and through darkness of heart accepted a corrupted religion to the extent that they worshipped creatures and not the creator remember satan was a creature of god son of the morning thus we find that where once truth was disseminated amongst men and all hell to that one truth there later came a day when a vast group turned from god and spread a diabolical form of worship around the world history bears it out that those of the tribe of shem that stood with the unchanging truth were in solid opposition to those of ham who turned away from truth to the devil's lie there is no time to engage in a discussion of this it is merely introduced that you may see there were two religions and two only and the evil one became worldwide monotheism turned to polytheism in babylon the devil's lie and the devil's mysteries rose up against the truth of god and the mysteries of god in that city satan truly became the god of this world and exacted worship from those that he had duped causing them to believe that he was truly the lord the polytheistic religion of the enemy began with the trinitarian doctrine it was way back there in antiquity that the one god in three persons idea came into existence how strange that our modern theologians have not spotted this but evidently just as duped by satan as their forebears were they still believe in three persons in the godhead let us be shown just one place in scripture where there is any authority for that doctrine is it not strange that while the descendants of ham went on their way in satanic worship which involved a basic concept of three gods that there is not one trace of the descendants of shem believing such a thing or having any ceremonial worship that involved even a type of it it is not strange that the hebrews believed hero israel the lord thy god is one god if there were three persons in the godhead abraham the descendant of shem in genesis 18 saw only one god with two angels now how was this trinity expressed it was expressed by an equilateral triangle even as it is expressed in rome today strange the hebrews did not have such a concept now who is right is it the hebrews or the babylonians in asia the polytheistic idea of three gods in one came out in an image with three heads on one body he is expressed as three intelligences in india they it in their hearts to express him as one god in three forms now that really is good modern day theology in japan there is a great buddha with three heads like the one we previously described but the most revealing of all is that which sets forth the trinitarian concept of god in a triune form of one the head of an old man symbolizing god the father two a circle which in the mysteries signified seed which in turn means the sun three the wings and tail of a bird dove here was the doctrine of father son and holy ghost three persons in the godhead the veritable trinity you can see the same thing in rome now let me ask once again is it not strange that the devil and his worshipers actually had more truth revealed than the father of faith abraham and his descendants is it not strange that the worshipers of satan knew more about god than the children of god now that is what modern theologians try to tell us when they talk about a trinity just remember this one thing from now on these records are facts and this is a fact satan is a liar and the father of lies and whenever he comes with any light it is still a lie he is a murderer and his doctrine of the trinity has destroyed the multitudes and will destroy until jesus comes according to history it did not take long for a change to be made in this concept of a father and a son and the holy ghost satan took them a step at a time away from the truth the evolved concept of deity was now one the eternal father to the spirit of god incarnate in a human mother does that make you think three a divine son the fruit of that incarnation woman's seed but the devil is not content he hasn't achieved worship of himself yet except in an indirect way so he takes the people away from the truth still further through his mysteries he reveals to the people that since the great invisible father god does not concern himself in the affairs of men but remain silent relative to them then it follows that he may well be worshipped in silence actually it means to ignore him as much as possible if not altogether this doctrine spread around the world also and right today in india you can see that temples to the great creator the silent god are strikingly few in number since it was not necessary to worship the creator father it was only natural that worship swung to the mother and child as the objects of adoration in egypt there was the same combination of mother and son called isis and osiris in india it was ishai and ishwara note the similarity of names even in asia it was civilly and the oes in rome and in greece it followed suit and in china well imagine the surprise of some roman catholic missionaries as they entered china and found their a madonna and child with rays of light emanating from the head of the babe the image could well have been exchanged for one in the vatican except for the difference of certain facial features it now behooves us to discover the original mother and child the original goddess mother of babylon was samiramus who was called rhea in the eastern countries in her arms she held a son who though a babe was described as tall strong handsome and especially captivating to the women in ezekiel 8 14 he was called tamus among classical writers he was called bacchus to the babylonians he was ninus what accounts for the fact that he is represented as a babe in arms and yet described as a great and mighty man is that he is known as the husband son one of his titles was husband of the mother and in india where the two are known as ishwara and ishai he the husband is represented as the babe at the breast of his own wife that this ninus is the nimrod of the bible we can affirm by comparing history with the genesis account pompeo said nina's king of assyria changed the ancient moderate ways of life by the desire for conquest he was the first who carried war against his neighbors he conquered all nations from assyria to libya as these men knew not the arts of war diadorus says ninas was the most ancient of assyrian kings mentioned in history being of warlike disposition he trained many young men rigorously in the arts of war he brought babylonia under him while yet there was no city of babylon thus we see this niners started to become great in babylon built babel and took over assyria becoming its king and then proceeded to devour other vast territories where the people were unskilled in war and lived in a moderate way as said pompeus now in genesis 10 speaking of the kingdom of nimrod it says and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and iraq and akhad and khalna in the land of china out of that land went forth asar and builded nineveh and kayla etc but the translators made a mistake in translating asser as a noun for it is a verb and in the chaldee means to make strong thus it is nimrod who having been made strong he established his kingdom by building the world's first army which he trained by drilling and through the rigors of hunting went beyond shinar with his strong army and subdued nations and built such cities as nineveh which was named after him for even today a chief part of the ruins of that city is called nimrod since we have discovered who ninus was it is now necessary to discover who his father was according to history it was bell the founder of babylon now it is to be noted here that bell founded it in the sense that he started this whole move but it was the sun ninus that established it and was the first king etc but according to the scripture the father of nimrod was kush and kush begat nimrod not only is this so but we find that ham begat cush now in the egyptian culture bell was called hermes and hermes means the son of ham according to history hermes was the great prophet of idolatry he was the interpreter of the gods another name by which he was called was mercury read acts fourteen eleven through twelve hygienist says this about that god who was known variously as bell hermes mercury etc for many ages men lived under the government of job not the roman job but jehovah of the hebrews who predates roman history without cities and without laws and all speaking one language but after that mercury bell interpreted the speeches of men whence an interpreter is called hermeneuties the same individual distributed the nations then discord began it is seen from this that bell or kush the father of nimrod originally was the ringleader that led the people away from the true god and encouraged the people as the interpreter of the gods to take another form of religion he encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built this encouragement is what brought the confusion and the division of men so that he was both interpreter and confuser push then was the father of the polytheistic system and when men were deified by men he of course became the father of the gods now cush was called bell and bell in roman mythology was janus he is pictured as having two faces and he carried a club by which he confounded and scattered the people avid writes that jaina said concerning himself the ancients called me chaos thus we find that the kush of the bible the original rebel against monotheism was called bell bellis hermes janus etc amongst the ancient peoples he purported to bring revelations and interpretations from the gods to the people in so doing he caused the wrath of god to scatter the people bringing division and confusion now up to this point we have seen whence polytheism or the worship of many gods came but did you notice that we also found a mention of a man named cush who was given a title of the father of the gods did you notice here the old theme of ancient mythologies that gods identify themselves with men that is where ancestor worship comes from so we might just examine history to find out about ancestor worship well it was brought out that cush introduced a three god worship of father son and spirit three gods who were all equal but he knew about the seed of the woman coming so there would have to be a woman and her seed come into the picture this was brought to pass when nimrod died his wife semiramis deified him and thus made herself the mother of the son and also the mother of the gods just exactly as the roman church has deified mary they claim she was without sin and was the mother of god which means the woman's promised seed but it wasn't too long until the woman began to attract more attention than the sun and soon she was the one who was depicted as trampling underfoot the serpent they called her the queen of the heaven and made her divine how like today were in mary the mother of jesus had been elevated to immortality and right now as of september 1964 the vatican council is attempting to give equality to mary she does not possess for they would like to call her marry the mediatrix mary the mother of all believers or mother of the church if there was ever babylonish ancestor worship in a religion it is the religion of the church of rome not only was ancestor worship originated in babylon but so also was the worship of nature it was in babylon the gods were identified with the sun and moon etc the chief object in nature was the sun which has light giving and heat giving properties and appears to man as a ball of fire in the heavens thus the chief god would be the sun god whom they called baal often the sun was depicted as a circle of flame and soon around that flame there appeared a serpent it wasn't long until the serpent became a symbol of the sun and consequently worshiped thus the desire of satan's heart became full-fledged he was worshiped as god his throne was established his slaves bowed to him there in pergamos in the form of a living serpent he was worshiped the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now symbolized in the form of a living serpent had not only seduced eve but the majority of mankind but how did pergamos become the seed of satan if babylon was the seat the answer again is in history when babylon fell to the medes and persians the priest king atlas fled the city and went to pergamos with his priests and sacred mysteries there he set up his kingdom outside the roman empire and thrived under the care of the devil this has been a very short resume of the history of the babylonish religion and its advent to pergamos many questions are no doubt left unanswered and much more no doubt could have been said to enlighten us but this is not intended to be a study of history rather it is intended to be a help to the study of the i i word love the way but the banana keeps putting it uh as he's taking us into the history then he comes out after a few pages well where will i stop this old history stuff this is not intended to teach you history it's intended to teach you the word yes but you see the reason why he goes ahead and puts these portions and i left you to listen to all that and maybe someone was also following online i wanted to listen to all that to be uninterrupted so that you can be able to see the history of the bible babylonish religion and you see how it came to pergamos and the connection it has with pegamos and you see how pegamos then becomes the seat and throne of saturn and actually like i told you that in the year 325 that was like he started here where this politicism it is it was established properly in vegamas when they started the reduction of the trinity it was established properly during this time and you usually will find out that uh the police kind of view has never been and will never be a billion teaching because the bible was compiled a few years ago but here we have been able to find out that this kind of belief of many gods came much much later in the beginning there was no belief or worship of many gods in the beginning they used to worship one god they believed there was one god they didn't know much that we know today but they just believed there was one god some way and of course from the line of shame and we found out that even when you go down the line of shame he realized that they all worshipped one god until the time that nimrod started his worship of many gods can you imagine that these [Music] people uh as you have seen from every nation china uh what else india whatever [Music] japan india you know or even in south america all these nations all over the world they worship they have their form of forms of worship of very many gods he said all that but also again in africa but i think most of what we have had in africa is we've had people who believe there is a god up there but they also believe there are many small spirits and there is a god who is above there up there you know oh yeah you are going so they kind of believed in monotheism but in a way politicism in all over the world you will go by the way when you travel you see when i was in china i where did they get these things from when i come and read the church book the answers are right here the answers are right here let me tell you this message answers all the questions that we have all the questions in our generations are right here if you meet people who say that is not god bring them here show them where they begin with it always that's why it is good you encourage not don't just read read and share huh please share when you have friends that you are not sharing this with them you are joking you're not even i have not believed it you're just joking around you're just receiving us but if you really believe this message you're going to share it with your friends how can you claim that this is all enjoyable wow and then you don't share you just keep it to yourself it is impossible i tell it is impossible yeah it means you have not believed it but if you have surely believed that brother you're going to be on fire to share with somebody give it to somebody give it to somebody there's someone here there's someone also they let their eyes open and of course that is if your eyes are open you shall be saying you are there all by yourself and you figure out this person let me begin to see is with the battle for others this one has had an experience we'll cover the main main main parts of course there was one thing that i wanted to cover down here in the next subtropic he does talk about what happened in india or in this year the denunciation but i have a few things against me because that you have them that hold a doctrine of balance you know this is a very good one but we're not going to look at it now it talks about what takes place uh during that time those who are holding adoption obama then uh he also talks about the doctrine of the neurologist remember the doctrines the doctrine of the nicolaitan was initially uh it's a deed but then it has become a doctrine and then talks about adoption of balaam maybe maybe we'll address this in the church because of our time having been that our time is done here so then it talks about the warnings and then the rewards of what is the reward in every age for the overcomers of that age so i think for these two parts the doctrine of balance and the adoption of the nephilims you might the lord willing go through this in the church uh just pray and see how the lord will lead us god bless you any question on this chapter because we are not going back into it anyone with a question oh you're like oh yeah let me read and see when i will finish oh i see brother charles network is very low but well i'm sure that uh you'll get your potion and you've got a new question okay no one with a question some questions you have provided to me but i've been so busy i never got a chance to look at it have you read through them the bible clearly states about that you will be jacked those are the even the first people to be that you profess the wrath of god false prophet then i wanted also to look at your question was it one how many are they these are you are here you mean you cannot speak them you don't even remember them can you read page 208 the why there is going to be a millennium but while that is going on you won't be in it you will be somewhere else hallelujah oh okay i think the bible mentions where he will be he says that uh where's my life he talks about the judgment yes okay just started in the book of revelation revelation 20 10 and the devil that deceived them was accustomed to the lack of fire and brimstone where the beast and and yeah that have it in your bible where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever hallelujah now remember this this one here is in revelation 20 and by the time he's speaking this it is after the millennium it's after the millennium but uh the bible says but i'm actually saying that the rest of the dead leave the north for a thousand years let me pick and see where there's another scripture that i wanted to read okay yeah revelation 19 20. and that this was taken and with him the first prophet that wrote miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and then them that worshipped his image never worshipped his image and these both were cast alive into the lake of fire with the brimstone and the remnant we are slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which one proceeded out of his mouth and all the flowers were filled with their flesh my good lord it's gonna be quite a bad difficult time for them for the first profit and the beast as well what's the other question 177 okay which question which question is yes yes it means yes we are saved by grace it's not the worst that we do if you dress properly that doesn't save you but that's not what i saved you but the salvation that you have received will make you dress proper if you don't dress properly it's a clear sign you have no faith and you are not believed but if you believe and you love jesus it will make you do the right thing you understand the works we do are not the reason why we are saved i preached that many times because i'm not smoking it doesn't mean that because i left smoking it means i'm safe because i don't drink alcohol i'm sick why are you safe i don't drink alcohol i don't you know for the kids i don't smoke i don't say satisfy yourself yes sorry there are people who don't do it as their own decisions yet they are not saved so you are served by grace through faith by grace through faith in christ alone and that grace will take you away from the things of the world that faith will mold you into the nature of jesus christ that faith will bring the works james says show me your faith without your works because of course you say faith you don't need wax eh so show it to me can you show it to me without your but i will show you my faith by my words it's only by our faith by our works people can see our faith but if you don't have wax if you don't have good works as a christian then your faith can be saved but the banh said you might be calling yourself a christian but if i come in your house and i hear that book you will give music going on forget about your testimony i don't want to hear it your life is shouting too loud but i can't see your testimony call yourself a christian and you dress a mini scarf your testimony your character your works is shouting that even when you talk i can't hear the the watch is too loud you get a point so please you call yourself a christian brother and then you you marry a girl like that you marry a girl who is a you know like you know even if she's calling herself a christian but today the believers will know who she is you know because of the way she's acting they they the character is not of christ their life is not a price she loves the world she goes into this kind of music and stuff like that and then she's all you know because you've married her because of beauty or because of the sex queen and stuff like that let me tell you you do that but i'm saying no matter what you think you are no matter what you say you are i don't see what you say you are i don't hear it because your testimony has already showed it by what you married hallelujah if i was very busy here preaching do you say i mean this message is true but actually i married in the message and the woman i married is not serving god it's not believing god is not giving respect to this message it shows you what i am it says that doesn't allow me to deceive you to choose what i am i thank god of course my wife shows christ yes i should talk about it or else she may ask me after the service my wife serves god i also leave the message and i character at least i believe i don't care your testimony i can work i can describe her a character manifest christ hallelujah amen at one time my daughter said yeah can i buy you a necklace she said no i said well i said well i was never raised with those things and i have no desire for them i said praise god that's right hallelujah and actually i was telling how can i buy you justice but if she said yes i would surely buy it for her but i'm glad she said she is not interested in cycling and any child of god will not be interested in such things any child of god will be interested in that character of christ not the say out what things you find even people call themselves believers younger gods they call themselves believers they don't wear necklace they don't wear your hand yeah they look again they don't have necklaces they don't wear nothing no makeup they come in the church they look holy all they dress properly on their wedding they look like yes let me tell you that's a clear sign that person has never been loved i know when people are getting married they have very many people around them even those who are not believers but my wife she was not my wife was not blessed by what by a believer even my own sister not a believer she paints herself but my wife did not accept those things he said i will not wear them they told her but you can wear something from here you know no i can't amen hallelujah they made me breathe you paint yourself and wear these kind of stuff it shows who you are shows what character in you you show the works that are your words show your testimony hallelujah no matter what you say you are i'm a believer for what that's not the kind of belief that the bible is talking about you watch your character you are test your works declare your testimony hallelujah you see then you go there and you begin putting stuff you never usually put on you are behaving like catholics who go to church and they never dress trousers and then when they come out they will dress naked but in the church you think that's our that's our religion this little religion this message religion that's why many people get out of it ah the standards are so high for you because you're trying to do it by your own words but if christ is in your heart he will change you you'll give you a new desire he will give you a new desire whereby your desire will will be there but you know he will suppress it and he his desire his will shall be that in your life you know don't think that because people dress things that are wrong it means they're fooled so it means they're not educated don't deceive yourself i've shown you videos here of believers even in other countries first world countries white people who don't dress short things who don't dress they don't understand things and they have all the money so it's not like they've lost their money and it's not like it is easy for them to get those long things it's not easy i've hosted some of them in my house and they give us that testimony it's not easy for them to get long things in their countries their country's gone down judged by god you know they can't get those good clothes that you see the ones that we can easily go at the shop there and you buy fifteen thousand twenty five thousand and you get a very beautiful dress their country is gone done you know they saw those things by themselves many of them make with their own hands in their own homes they saw they have their own sewing machine because they can't get it so they will do it by themselves man so what excuse do you have to say as i believe i can't get something wrong i can't get it means it is your appetite you you are the one with the problem if others can get it and you can't get it what is wrong with you you are the one with the wrong desire you have almost eyes because you do not have the desire to be like like like uh to manifest the life of christ but you want to manifest your desires let me tell you each of us have a desire to do things even younger men you know the things they are doing today the way they are putting their hair like lightening you know the way they are you know getting their trousers all it's like as if their thought is in there for whatever you know just touching them like that and then you know then they begin working like girls let me tell you these things what are you going to say when another one is getting a very good one you are getting that kind of thing you know it means it's your desire it is in you already you know but if you're a child of god you will be different your works will show what you believe me all through my life from since i was a teenager people used to say i look like old if you see the if you see the pictures i used to dress i i rather the crowd that i used to dress if you see in my old picture you wonder you'll be like ah and you know i was okay i was you know i can't say that i was really a villager no i had been out had well traveled and all that i was living with big people you know we had the money but something in me that you know now say oh i usually get something you know presentable at that time but you know i kind of loved you know to be different and you know i i would get those uh course you need to see some of those girls i used to wear you know like i would be like a child in that country because i didn't have the manager at that time to buy a very good quality of my size up just to go get you know someone would give me something and then i would change a little bit and then i just put myself myself in it it would look like a wrapping cloth inside but i was happy i was happy i was having god i was happy and yeah i would show you those pictures you know so but i i was never regretting you know i just loved god i served him and that when you asked me people asked me at that time how old was i and that was about 15 years ago if people asked you you would really say that i was 30 then or 40. so then by now you exam 60. but it's simply because of the way i was dressing when i saw my wife the first time i didn't really recognize her one of the reasons was the way she was dressed okay because she wasn't just too impressed okay she was dressed to be in the uh this the spirit and anointing about because we first met at a convention you know so talk about sisters who's good i don't want the bright side to deceive me there's a problem with him the problem with you people got the conversion but they yes but she had dressed like a mother's union you know my mother's union you don't know you don't know you know grows up yeah even she told me she had brought up with me you know yeah she apparently from a bigger woman you know [Music] we want to serve god and god help us also to serve one another so if you go in a convention to serve you know you know a brother or a sister to see you they will never see you you will be the one to go in the conversation every time you know it will be seen you are asked to present yourself as a child of god hallelujah because a true man the way you present yourself will attract that kind of man with that kind of if you present yourself with short stuff with a you know paintings and stuff like that don't forget you those who have affected those things but if you present yourself like a daughter of god you will get a son of god okay imagine the whole country believes the message who would lead us because we still need order and why does god hate politics thank you and i'll answer your question straight the world country can never believe the message it is impossible if it were to be possible there is no reason for us to preach the reason why we preach because there is something sick and when there was a time when the serpentine seed was not on earth god was the ruler he did not need man to rule god was the ruler of heaven and man was the ruler of earth so man himself was the ruler of earth and man was divine he did not need another man to lead him there was only one man ruling over the animals and the creation so look at it this way before city came into the world we never needed man to lead man we never did a man to rule man because man was ruling over the creation man was ruling over the world was ruling over the fish of the sea the vibes of the air the the animals the beasts of the field you understand man was controlling he was the one controlling them but today is man controlling them no you see so man is not doing he's a good given right man as a man has been overturned to rule man instead yet man was not supposed to rule my mind was supposed to rule the creatures even that's what the bible says that all the creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god the animals are waiting that's why it happens sometimes you see some people they are gifted somehow to be able to control lions some people are gifted to control crocodiles yeah find them on youtube there that shows you that that's how man is supposed to be you know you know men control snakes you know the issue is that's how it is supposed to be mind is supposed to rule over the creatures but the creatures fear the man because man went out of his position so man does not have the glory that he used he used to have and he instead began to rule over another man it has never been the intention of god god intended for himself to be the king over the man and then man to be the king of other christians and and i can prove that to you when when god had chosen moses and he made moses the king um rather sorry but he met he church moses and adam moses um you know uh came out you know very mean actually meant to say abraham with moses out of abraham came out of nation a nation of israel then many years down the road they might apply and when they get uh very many people then they say well they see the nations around them of course at that time it was god ruling over them and he only had a prophet who was speaking the word of god it wasn't reading over everybody or anybody someone would simply come and say that's the other blah blah blah correct it or leave it if you connect it you get the blessings if you leave it god will rebuke you god not the prophet okay the work of the prophet is to speak the word of god and leave the same not to cause law and order it was god himself doing the law and the law and order okay so god speaks the word they don't really do it you come with your cows things come and then you have to repent then it becomes fine so god was the direct ruler of these people and then when people saw that the people around them and everybody was doing good oh we want to really be like them look at this they have a king oh look at how good he's gay their king looks like oh it's rich and they all they the prestige at all that country's respect but look at us we are farmers we are we don't even have anyone rooting over us we're just coming here and then disappearing going back to the woods ah it's so boring it looks so so you know so bad and you know they were like we also need that king we also need that kingdom somewhere we are telling that kind of thing you just come what is this then god told him don't you worry somewhere they have not rejected you they have rejected you see so that's why in the true chat of the living god it's not the man that ruled the child it is the holy ghost that ruled the church through those men those men ruled by the holy ghost and the word you see just like it used to be the oldest amen now when they rejected god he told them those people who have rejected me they have accepted people to rule over them and indeed the people shall rule over them but they will make them suffer they will be the lord their lords they will make them you understand yes show them fine let them and indeed that's what happened the kings killed the people the things persuaded the people the things stole from the people they can't destroy their wives they can you understand that's what kings do when a man rules over another man is cruel man is rude man is bad but god is a god of mercy god is a god of peace god is a god of judgment god is a god he is a god who doesn't judge without um uh huh yeah without first warning you and so god is a good is a he's a good god but you see so my sister god hates politics because politics is not from god politics is from the devil hallelujah and so i'll tell you that right if you've been thinking of going into politics run away from politics don't do that because politics is of the devil okay go into something which will make the people see the kingdom of god even these other casual jobs do you want to be what an engineer do you want to be what builder okay do you want to be white agriculturalist do you want to be one now whatever you want to be in this room you want to be a doctor oh i have a doctor here an engineer here in the making everywhere you are those departments are ruled and controlled by the devil did you know that but those industries you at the time of work and go there very simply get money to sustain your family and also to live an input of a child of god brother martin was telling me the other day that he was having his uh father and his father is a police officer one of the high ranking but not up there but he's really high ranking also he's been in the fossil for a very long time but where he is at the moment he suffered very many things many problems out of those people because he has refused he has hindered them to get to be corrupt and so they have tried even to make him look as if he was the one who is corrupt because to remove him from the system but god has always been with him even recently the case that he put on him god removed it from me so when you're a child of god you're going in a field you walk faithfully but don't you dare stand for you know elected politics that's not your place because surely it is rotten to the car it is brought into the call i'll tell you that the bible says we are to give attention a tenth of our saturday for offertory what if now let me first put that correct you do not give a tenth for all factory no a tenth is the same as a tax and a tenth is ten percent of your earnings but remember when you walked who blessed you gosh so the money of what whose is it some someone said it is mine now i will tell you that man is not yours it is god who has given it to you if you have got a hundred thousand it's not yours it is god who has given it to you you might say for my strength it is he will give you strength for my reason it is him who gave you wisdom so it is god who gives you that money now that you get 100 000 don't say it's all my money no it's god is money but it's always testing you this is just like you like you would give something to a child and then you say give me back give me something and i shall say that's how people are you god gives you he says give me something small let me let me also eat you or many times you say god let me hear this is all mine imagine looks foolish doesn't it that is how it is when god says fair ties to me and then you'll be like ah money i've studied for money i've even suffered to ask you to give it to me imagine tithe is not yours just like even the other money which you have all your money is not yours it is goddess but tithe is meant to test you and see where is your faith is your faith in god do you believe he is your provider if you indeed believe is your provider then you will give back to his giving back it is he is saying do you believe i'm gonna give it to you you say yes lord i believe oh if you believe i am the one who gave it to you give me a piece of it to prove it that's all he's saying give me a piece of it to prove it that it is a new giving he doesn't need your money does god need our money does god need it where does he receive it from he doesn't need it right especially if you look at it surely that's good need money so we're not trying to say that god the pastors collect that man somewhere and then they forward it to god somewhere okay no god doesn't need your money okay god needs your heart and in a bid of getting your heart he is saying i need to test you to see whether your heart has faith in me whether your heart believes in my hand of provision and for you to prove that you need to take a piece of what i've given you and give it to the priesthood as a sign that you've given back to me because the priesthood would remember he said that this priesthood is mine there were 12 tribes but one of them is at the top of levi he said this one is mine the rest had the inheritance in the land but this one did not the rest were working and having jobs this one did not because they committed themselves to serve god all the rest of their life these ones they are not receiving the piece of land in the announcement of land they that will be known so god said don't worry about this one this one is mine but then it comes back to this and it says okay as these ones are serving me i i using i'm using them to serve you now you you're going to work on the switch and then i'll bring back attendance to these ones these ones they'll receive it as their income and they will live on it and therefore preachers and pastors are really actually supposed to live on life but that's none of your business your business is to understand and acknowledge that god is the one who provided to you so if you so believe that god provided for you then you give back to him a tenth of your income that is mandatory to every professing christian and a christian who doesn't pay tithe they can never prospect financially take that for me they can never prosper and i mean a christian i'm not saying the lady i mean a christian including pastors everyone must pay right that's right okay i'm not teaching titan videos i'm just answering a question here and if there is more questions on this then maybe i can have a service on it the bible says we are giving a tenth of our salary for offertory no it's not for offertory there is tithe that's ten percent then offertory that is the offering free will the other one he told he just said you said give me ten percent it is you have one hundred thousand oh give me the ten thousand on his mind he said it is mine if you don't give it to me you've robbed me that is mine i gave it to you but i want it back so prove to me that you believe i'm done will give you and i can give you more then you give you say ah now you are now you i can prove to you i will give you more already first fish so when you pay the type that is god is he says it is mine he himself is what he says it is mine that have a proof may and safe i will not bless you with more it is in malachi 3 okay we'll read it later then he says if you give that one then now now also you can give what you want to do from what you are meaning are you heading after you paid that one let me tell you whether you are received from a gift or from a friend or from salary some people thought that they were currently peptides when they are earning salary as long as it is money which you are going to control and it doesn't have to be money only it can be anything you know you can save your land a piece of wheat is tight you you you can have 10 goats one god is death you can you understand so whatever it is that you you receive you must i feel as a christian and this principle is what personally since i knew about it i have lived in amen for about 16 years now and god has been faithful it's a principle that a christian every creature must do it and don't ever feel that i'm giving my time no that's just i'm giving back to god it is not yours it is god is he says he is therefore if you have a budget and your income is thousand and you're making a budget make a budget for 90 000 and in that budget friendly have an include offering because offering is according to what you desire maybe i would give god one i remember i'm receiving a hundred thousand what is going to be my uh what will i give to the work of the lord you know okay i'll give that a thought did you see the bible says god love that generous giver if you give generosity god will give you generous now your title is how much 10 000 but your offering was how much thirty thousand so some people they think when i pay tight i'm done now i can move around as a christian when you pay your tithe you have just started yes that is not even yours you need to give you yourself you didn't give anything you yourself didn't give anything as a matter of fact many times i have even too i will not say this on there on the youtube so you yourself give me you must give something as a christian you must give hallelujah okay now that that is according to what you desire according to on your own discretion right when they bring when they pass the bible to you don't say i already paid my judges pass no pick out from what you have and don't even just decide there you have to be prepared when i go to church today i'll give the lord this much ah you people seem not to know anything about this i think i have to make an extension teaching on this with with the scriptures what if you get money but use it for god is work like visit the sick remember that is like uncertainty like unplanned for it just comes and the rest you use it for home things and you find money is done will it be will it be a cast to you yes it will be a cast to you if you do not pay your time life must never be negotiated now you have received don't plan to pay your tithe me whenever i receive anything in my hands the first thing i do before i think of all the needs i have is time that's the first thing first things first my hands are crossed i receive how much one million okay one million how much is goodies i put it in me i never even don't even have a second thought of it i don't even have anything in my mind that maybe i can even borrow me completely not i know that one i don't even count it it's a goddess hallelujah and i've always used it for the lord now i can plan with a 900 and that would mean that i cannot plan maybe to give god something maybe also to you know those things you're talking about they will come in with that yeah yeah maybe oh they are now because they wanted more money i did not plan but it's okay i can use some of this then they also have the sick person okay you understand whatever you want to do after that use it from that other remainder that you have because you actually actually have 905 and you don't have one you actually have 99 so if you don't pay your tithe you are under a cash a financial curse where you cannot be blessed no matter how much you work where your money will just disappear where the bible says you put in your pocket it will just disappear it will go through your pocket will have holes where you you put it to a business investment and everything just goes everything will at the others they will prosper yours if they are crops they will dry if their crops it is there's no storm which will come to you once if it is a something it is i mean problems will come to you at least people get sick and like you are saying problems will come because you don't pay your time and whatever you touch will not be blessed and now as i summarize this question answer to this question we do not pay our tithe to become rich we pay our tithe as a an act of faith everything as a christian we do it as an act of faith you do not dress properly to go to heaven right but you do it as an act of faith so you don't pay your tithe to become rich if you do that for that purpose you will never become rich actually you remain the way you are because you have the wrong intention your giving is not having the right requirement you must give you the right way also it's just like if you know someone is in need then you just tell them okay everybody this man you see him he's suffering will come here recording me from today you're not going to suffer anymore i'm giving you this heaven how much do you need 2 million don't want me to give a gift i think your blessing is finished you have given very big but your blessing is finished by those people clapping for you and seeing you and enjoying your giving but when you want if you want the lord to bless you give in secret if you want to help someone give him secret don't blow your own trumpet giving secret and don't talk about it say you know i gave him a second but that's why you brother i know you will talk to you you're not giving the other brother you know that's where i'm the one who gave it to me no please don't do that if you do that it won't take you to hell but your blessings are done so if you want to work in a life of prosperity in the life of blessings be a practicing christian pay your tithe give your offerings support the calls now you're about to begin collecting church building funds you people believe all of you are going to collect very big big sounds of money hallelujah yes all of you are going to collect in fact you should begin correctly maybe even after this we should do yeah we should have already okay out of this youtube meeting we should maybe uh leave with some money you know yes for the youth building project yes not the beauty buddy we need to first buy land eh yeah did you tell them yes we are already looking so please when we start that project you give and don't tell anybody that you get some people when you come in the chat and you say okay we are now collecting uh-huh you 5000 ah let me now give more than him you a hundred thousand okay that one should give more than me you 500 everybody will say [Music] you yeah yeah yeah i will pledge you later because you are fearing so there are it shows you that they have got a revolution of what giving so maybe one of these days we shall preach on that seriously brother you had a question yes yes which is one million okay what's the type of 10 million 1 million let me ask you a question is there anyone who will ever receive money that is enough for them no one earns money that is enough for them brother billy paul i want you to know it from today you can never earn the money that you need all that you want all right so that's why we have what we call budgets do you know what a budget is what is a budget yes even if you earn 20 million and you don't have a budget you can spend it all and you remain with a very big a very big one a very big one we don't have business people you said you wanted to be in business you can't even give me the right words deficit thank you because a deficit means the money that you were supposed to find your budget with but you've not received it so you still need it so that's why we buy it why do we budget so that we can prioritize those things that we need and we leave those things that we want other things which we can do later yes yes but the lord is money tithe not even ever risen reasoning is out okay someone said what if i have a alone or someone is demanding me money even if someone is demanding you before you think of paying them first to pay your time then now you can come to england that is the law of god and christians all over the world black white green yellow if they are there also they practice it and god blesses them very far i think i've answered your question brother yes okay it is good to give a testimony but also a testimony of pride you can differentiate it from a testimony that is you don't need to blow your own trap let them be the one to give that testimony usually that's what i do i've helped many people in this life but i never do really talk about it what is there what is there to eat let them talk for me if they talk for me no problem but if i talk for myself what i've done for them is like broke my own trumpet the other person never said why should i if they thought it should be a secret fight if they're not grateful fine i don't do it for them for them to blow my trumpet i did it for them for the glory of god that if i don't need to blow my trumpet yes i've seen people would do that but i don't really quite like that spirit also why why would you i've helped brother son so you know this younger man i picked him up when he couldn't even you know he didn't have shoes in his feet what what what well it depends on the circumstance and the atmosphere yes yes yes when your tithe is received for on the on the total sum your your type you give your tithe on a total sum of income whenever no matter if you if you receive 10th of a hundred thousand every week then you should give ten thousand every week if you receive one thousand every month then you should give i mean if you receive a hundred thousand every month then you should give ten thousand every man ten percent is out of the total earning whenever you earn and the offering is unlimited you can even give everything in remember nothing you have testimonies of people who have got a stolen give everything you have they gave yes and god bless them yes of course the pentecostals preach it well by the way but they have a wrong intention behind it so that makes it right wrong yes okay that is your time yes but the whole man you must keep giving will never you you because god keeps supplying right then you must keep giving but not giving tight if you had a hundred thousand you are paying tight on you are a hundred thousand don't pay it again on that 100 you give offerings that is according to what you want to give you can give five percent two percent one percent zero point five percent depending it's not a percentage it is any that you want to give but whenever even if you you earned more money than you expected don't say i'm now that way my soul is supposed to be a hundred thousand and today i'm receiving two hundred thousand i will not give you the other hundred thousand you always give or up ten percent out of every earning yes yes thank you hey look it is not right me some people use that language but i actually feel offended in my speech when someone tells me that they spent money and when they begin to tell me what they spent it on they begin to tell me that they also spectrum type it wasn't your expenditure it wasn't your expansion if you if i give you my money to keep for you i mean if you give if you give me your money to keep for you huh and then i give it back to you can i even talk about it is it even right that i even spent on brother nani did i spend on me i kept for you and now i was returning how can i even talk about it i shouldn't even talk about it at all whatsoever because it's a dramatic that i would i should return your money therefore if you are giving accountability for the moneys unless it wasn't your money but if it's your money actually you shouldn't even pay tighter on the money which is not yours you better even what do you owe you yours and and once you have paid tight don't if your mom sends you to the market say somebody go to the market and they buy you know tomatoes then their houses have received it that infrastructure you know so it's not yours yeah if they give you my preschool phrase don't touch it okay but if they give you your pocket money type that one that one is your money right you can use it the way you want so you must take that one so you taste your income and what was your question all right so then we don't need to talk really about it as well if it is a fundraising for the wedding and quantity okay you can talk about it i will tell you what if you are married then that also goes back to who have you married my wife can never ask me such questions do you know why we plan together we plan together yeah what are we going to do this month abcd this is what we need that is what we have always let me tell you you people you're gonna get there always you have you have less than what you need to spend just know that but while we are planning we don't budget i told you if we see one million we don't buy it for one million we bought it from 900 pounds that's why and she knows it i know it because both of us should pay right but it doesn't mean that it is one million now we are paying one hundred thousand should also put another no it's our income you pay the same and it is not right to talk about i paid the time i even did this did you pay it wasn't yours to begin with so how can you even discuss it yes you pay your time to the loan no you pay it to your past you know but i'm saying is that every month every person must have a church remember i even preached about it the other day you know it's not good for christians to be flying everywhere today you are here i got away from you're flying around no you must have a church home where you go where you attend where you hear the word from where you're feeding from actually your home church is where you eat from if someone comes to me and i'm not feeding them any spiritual food and they take me i will not receive because not their pastor but if someone takes to me then i must ensure they are fed spiritually you understand yeah i must assure they are fed maybe my minister has been a blessing to them and they say well from today you're my pastor then i can receive their type understand uh but also some people you they can come for example they can go and visit in a chat somewhere and then they maybe they they visit there they they live there for one year two years and then they still say that you might want to charge me you know and then they test the other place when again they are feeding from that's not also right i believe you must say where is your home church your own church is where you eat from where you feel from that is pain to a person not to the church why because tithe is not the farms used for church building tight is not used for innovation of the church is not used for uh helping the the you know you know the needy you know stuff like that life is supposed the person who chooses what to use tight for is the past whether it is 1000 or 1000 million okay that's why churches that have bigger congregations do like the past i can feel laid spend some of the money on humanitarian works or on helping ministers and stuff things like that because they can't use all that money for themselves they pay the costs they decide to buy private jets because they have very many members and all they are paying their taxes they have a lot of money they buy private jets that shows you the difference between the messaging ministers believers and and the denominations but tight is paid to your pastor your pastor and of course you can give it when you are giving tithing out an offering back just throw it there unless it has written only tight and we haven't you know you can just put a level of some very well and you know put tight or your name on it or whatever you throw it there why so that when the person receives it he knows oh it's brother son okay then i'll pray for the son but if he receives it no name on it okay fine i'll pray for whoever gave whichever yes if you want to just drop it fine yes okay if someone pays their tithe in the church without knowing that means that person is not is not around enough he's not even a believer in the message because all believers of the message no they pay their tithe to their masters yes yes that's not your business yeah but i pay my type first of all where do you put your tithe no no where do you put your tie to the lord okay you must have that intention that mindset i pay i entice the lord but i give it to the pastor where the pastor takes it but the bible says however however uses it that's planning your business but you have taken to the lord actually when it seems that he must pray for you must pray and receive it in the name of the lord right these are bible principles like i said we're going to have a service and we shall preach on this the pastors also type they they show thanks to the lord just like you ties to the lord okay so thank you like i said i will have an exposition on this preaching on this and talk about all those areas that i know of concern but the the type money must be for the work of the ministry for the minister why to the pastor because your pastor passes on who feeds you spiritual food spiritual manner that are far you paint him but pastor doesn't walk alone usually he has other ministers right in the chat so if they are not working or how do they live there you just come and join the weather man and then you go how are they living so then the pastor also usually supports them so but like i said we will go we're going to have this exposition in this i'm realizing there are many questions on trans i didn't know i didn't expect that so we need to talk about that we need to talk about still something okay um hmm whoever is um yes how did they was william branham only from where was william bannon from where was martin from where was uh iranians from where was paul from where where was martin luther from yes and where was uh uh huh where where is it from weasley wesley was from europe was from uk england yeah now did you see that all these messages came from different areas and yet their message was able to move because you see god begins like like you can you you start a fire here about fire but it goes i don't have to start in every spot at bushfire the one who suddenly hears that which goes all across the field so when god sets a message that's why it takes a time a period of time because it has to move to everyday everyone has to receive that message of that generation who was intended to have this eternal life so that's what happened at that time and that's what will happen even in our time the message the message moves sometimes it's not packed off by of course the revelation of the word is packed up by a man but the holy spirit fires still are lit in all those areas somehow for people to receive a revival of the world in their time yes i hope that will be the last one you wanted to be a politician i have been a prefect i was a religious prefect twice in high school and higher school i was a religious prefect i believe on those things you should pray for them because in such a level i don't think it would be harmful why because i don't think it can uh it will influence you away from the world but i believe it can give you a position of influence over the students to give them the word like i did with me it also depends on your intentions what you do with it me when i was a religious prefect i was first of all there was nothing that why don't why do we say this kind of believers from going into politics because by the ban i'm saying it is rotten his point is at school also rotten no i never bribed students to elect me no but if you go to university politics it becomes something else you see universal politics is rotten almost like they are the rest of it you know most of the those guild presidents you find that uh they are also connected to a political party and you know they have you know really rotten so it depends on the circumstances but the bottom line is what is your intention in it number two is it a law that believers don't do politics no it is not three is it a sin no it is not many things are not seen although because support says all things are not lawful to me but all things are not expedient so it's not a sin for you but will it keep you connected serving christ the way you are will it keep you close to the lord will it will it compromise you or not with the other questions you have to ask yourself and then you pray about it and let the horse be designed that in you so that's what i would say and i think that summarizes it you have been a joke yes it was that thus saith the lord god says god judges his own prophets you dare know that the prophet of god god told jose expressly as a prophet don't come and tell us god told you because you're not a prophet you understand so god and it was implicating the condition of israel how israel was that's how also that woman was a prostitute israel had become a prostitute maybe preach about that also one day so you're not a prophet like hosea number one number two got all hosea number three it was for the purpose of the it was i had a message for israel and many other reasons but also i'll tell you another person who married a prostitute that was king ahab was god happy with him so so you said the outcome of it when he married jezebel jesus became a destruction actually the prophet of god rebuked her he said you referred to the dogs so that's not a standard that you want to use to say that a son was that a jew must marry a jew a christian must marry yeah so he doesn't actually jose did you unreally didn't want it he said oh god why certainly do it so that's not what he was he wasn't a prostitute he was god it was god telling me praise the lord amen let us pray precious loving jesus we thank you so much for the time you have given to us to share your work today we give you praise one and glory further some questions that i've been asked and shared here i pray oh god that your word will be able to sink into our hearts we shall be able to know you more that shall be close to you father that we shall overcome especially these young really want to people they want to be close to you they want to see you and to know that you are really real lord father i pray that you like reveal yourself to each and every one of them father help them lord even as they want to do the principles of their gospel that you have them to live for your god and most importantly that you will help them to have a resolve to live for you and to give their entire lives to you lord jesus father i pray over that you will keep all of us under the blood of jesus and will help us that we will be there where the devil can do us father we give you praise one and glory until we meet again in jesus name oh i'm walking right under i'm walking right under the block oh i'm walking right under [Music] right [Music] i'm living right under [Music] [Music] [Music] oh
