[Music] who [Music] are you coming [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] is [Music] just take this moment and worship the lord [Music] surrender our souls our jesus for the bible saying that when peter was still still speaking the holy ghost fell upon them lord god yesterday today and forever difference [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] in the book of matthew amos let us first read matthew chapter 5 verses 5. and seeing the multitude went up into the mountain and when he was set his disciple came unto him and opened his mouth and told them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for there is the king there is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the me for the blessed are they which do hunger and thus after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful but he shall obtain mercy now yes naturally [Music] [Music] we are reading almost hamas yeah almost chapter eight versus eleven emma c behold that they come says the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread noro a thirst for water part of hearing the word of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and they shall not find it in that they shall have fear they shall the fair fightings and the young men faint for thirst [Music] father we thank you lord for the reading of the word it's my desire that you come and break this water to us take my knowledge aside and may the holy spirit speak through me tonight in jesus name amen i mean maybe city [Music] that has given me an opportunity to stand before the bride of christ standing here it's never been easy and there's no way you can get used to [Music] that so just pray for me because god knows what is in your heart and this is the only way god speaks to us amen one brother gave a prophecy and then another one interprets or when prophecy is given but when the word is preached and this evening i want to talk i'm going to share about hungering for more of god hungering for god here this word came from jesus himself from his own lips it says that blessing and they wish to hunger and thrust after righteousness paul they shall be filled blessed blessed are those who hunger joel i request you to try to open that amen nina so jesus himself one of yesterday in this chapter the bible tells us when the bible is saying that the multitude uh seeing the multitude he went up into um he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciple came unto him and he opened his mouth and told them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven [Music] uh things that started changing now the direction i started going different directions there is no life in you you go i want us to look at hungering for god we are living in the chase and we believe the [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] yeah you mean he's dead while you're living blessed by the name of the lord amen of god he gives the definition of thus [Applause] just imagine you have that painful desire to hear the for the word of god [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] amen how can i get anger for god for god do you know what you need to do you know you have to form to the world amen and this evening for you [Applause] what are [Applause] [Applause] now listen the message you wanted the bombs of the holy spirit the box of the spirit and you are hunger and you and you hungered for it now the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you were hungering for it for righteousness [Applause] [Applause] somewhere that [Music] quench that fact [Applause] [Applause] keep going but there is a promise to you because that tells me and you there's a promise telling us to stay aside everywhere where company would you ever see that will be said to protect happening around us amen he says he shall be filled i remember we were with brother peter the other day truly tried no organ or peter and we met a brother that sentiment believe in fasting but when i was reading this quote [Applause] [Applause] and spend their days shaking [Applause] is answer that question and waiting on hello deep into the water [Music] and waiting [Applause] and waiting and strike their souls with the power of the resurrection [Music] [Applause] hallelujah mean when they are getting scared of fasting now the prophet fasted for them i want to tell you something amen blessed be the name of the lord cast out the demons [Applause] this jesus had a reason why that devil refused to [Applause] the disciple used to run away when jesus fasted from what the day is the righteous receiving never but jesus was churching yesterday because the bible says every night they could go in the mountains [Music] [Applause] [Applause] the name right from the beginning is for waterproof oh they you find whether you can even hardly speak over song to get superior to become a fat no sir it's not wrong you may be got a big but when in spanish whether you're a fireball let's say the name of the lord it's their stomach more than the word of god [Music] christ somewhere let's keep on feeding on the world [Music] not be a government that is clear the first let us try to god settle for less blessings he says if you just get so hungry for god questions and answers shouting will take place if you got so in the name of the lord you keep hungry it will set your heart on fire and you will feel that jumping in your heart bring your opponent close to you he said the name we is teaching us how to match with jesus with jesus [Applause] [Music] yes sir if you even don't know how to work on this world so jesus christ himself being the light yes blessed said with the name of the lord let us hunger for this god to everything is just called the two cabinets let's say the name of the lord amen one day we had oppression when we were at santa romo and one brother brought a prayer request but the world will see christina that our life will be a stepping stone [Music] where others will step on to seek christ i'm hungry for anything no [Applause] [Applause] [Music] now as long as you are waiting and hungering to get back to god there is a god calling somewhere according to you every time one time jacob's [Music] [Music] [Applause] this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there was a city of god the only god spoke to him and told him there is something that you need one way chinese he started developing that anger injury amen said god has not even intended to do this you spoke about this that night when he was hungering the name of the lord jacob had strength to wrestle with god and defeat god jacob had a portion of god in him yeah that was catholic [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] for this evening thank you very much in jesus name amen amen amen there is going to be a will of god somewhere okay god wants to come down and make love to you okay speaking the thirsting and the hungering trying to get to some of your stretch your heart to make love to you yes sir sometimes very breakthrough he said this woman is stubborn [Applause] [Applause] calling him daddy amen blessing with the name of the lord come here so what we need hungering for god again let god give us that hunger cut [Applause] [Applause] the devil is going to show you plenty to precise sit down if you come to find the fault let me go in that small church there is [Applause] [Music] because that's what you came to see amen man you cannot come listen forth and see something good we can see those women who dress in long skirts like all the people somebody [Music] [Applause] of the lord amen when god created the universe and said this is good oh brother we collapsed in god this is the prophet amen so they are older than [Music] look god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] then they took photos oh myself [Music] [Applause] i [Applause] the spirit is going on jesus said we shall be filled yes let us keep on casting christian thoughts who is this allah in our hearts on the younger in germany [Music] in the time when people are running here and there is nothing that is a man close the the name of the lord because where the holy ghost is come amen he will reveal this thing to us but when i'm saying revelation cannot be over emphasized to believer it cannot be over emphasis like emphasize to a believer blessed be the name of the lord coming so we need that hunger in our amen for the world what's wrong in the country challenge and praise yourself to come when the church is open go away [Music] when the church is open there is something wrong with that spirit will be agreed to kill this again amen mean meaning that each one of us it is our duty only just speak words anyhow as the pastor usually tells us they speak anyhow blessed is the name of the lord amen neighborhood is a symbol priests speak with the honor begin the result they take care well my word if they are quoting wrong you cannot be better than unless your father is the devil [Applause] time is at hand we should love and we should love one another more than we ever did in all our lives [Applause] [Music] to one another it should be a love of failure when jesus rose from the dead yesterday number four the bible says and that's what the prophet said and as much as i long to go hunting and fishing in the uh in the in the outdoors yet my heart is more hungering to get on top of that mountain and talk to god than anything i know of hungering for the word of god [Music] to use that opportunity every time he went into the mountains he said he was hungering to do it again to talk go get him and anything he so that's what we need to create under two engines good to give us such a hunger for you that we will hunger and thirst for him day and night may god bless you okay amen blessed father [Music] it is our desire tonight lord i believe that you have spoken to some of us [Applause] lord we cannot have that hang unless you become that hunger in us and thirst in us lord jesus look at my ears too give us the grace to wake sir
