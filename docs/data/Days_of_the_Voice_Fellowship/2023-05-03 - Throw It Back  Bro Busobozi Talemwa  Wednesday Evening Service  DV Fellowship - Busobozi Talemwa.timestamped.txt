[42:23] trying to say he was trying to throw
[42:26] back in prayer
[42:28] whatever the devil had thrown to him
[42:32] because the purpose of the devil should
[42:34] destroy us
[42:36] to discourage us to make us feel
[42:39] discouraged to make us
[42:43] but I tell you I am one of those this
[42:46] evening

[42:52] time the devil throws something
[42:55] I am determined to throw it back
[42:59] Hallelujah man you see let me tell you
[43:02] whenever the the devil does something
[43:07] sometimes the Lord just looks on

[43:14] about his enemy foreign

[43:32] [Music]
[43:49] [Applause]
[43:57] so if you are here in the church this
[43:59] evening
[44:01] and the devil is not fighting you in any
[44:03] way
[44:05] that's the clear sign that you are
[45:06] to talk about foreign
[46:07] feel like you know you you were you were
[46:10] useless
[46:11] and and you you feel depressed
[46:17] I feel sad you know you have more
[46:20] strings
[46:26] sometimes the Devil comes and takes away
[46:29] your joy of Salvation and throws you
[46:33] sadness and then you begin to be there
[46:36] when you feel in your heart you have an
[46:40] empty vacuum
[46:41] and you see because you are under a
[46:45] storm
[46:46] because the devil has put you another
[46:49] storm to understand
[46:50] sometimes do these other things it is
[46:54] sickness what day sometimes it is
[46:56] because you are poor you have no money
[46:59] and you're trying to work but things are
[47:02] not working
[47:03] and you want to give up sometimes
[47:06] let me tell you
[47:26] and you throw it back foreign
[47:32] [Music]
[48:06] the devil there to cut off the very
[48:09] program of God
[48:13] God has a program with you
[48:17] Hallelujah man today I'm preaching to
[48:20] people who have come to China
[48:22] have you come to church I said have you
[48:26] come to church
[48:27] amen one sister there two sister you
[48:30] have come to church you have you come to
[48:32] church when I was there yes and I'm
[48:35] preaching to you today and I'm telling
[48:37] you right in the very first chapter
[48:39] um
[48:43] we find a devil there to cut off the
[48:45] very program of God
[48:49] you see there is a program of God with
[48:51] you
[48:52] God has a program with you
[48:55] and the purpose of the devil is to cut
[48:58] it off
[48:59] the first thing was the issue made by
[49:02] Pharaoh
[49:05] but they would throw all the children
[49:07] male children born of the Hebrews
[49:12] in the river and drowned them
[49:15] think of it that same lizard eyed devil
[49:20] oh yes
[49:23] how about back there in the beginning
[49:29] as soon as sudden sin that through that
[49:32] righteous seat sit down anyway
[49:35] through Abel was going to come out of
[49:38] the to come out of the redeemerable
[49:44] quickly he went to work to destroy that
[49:47] person
[49:50] too that God was going to use
[49:57] have you heard what I was saying
[50:00] whenever the devil says
[50:06] that God is going to use
[50:09] from the moment when they are babies
[50:12] it never begins to try and cut off the
[50:16] program of God
[50:27] it is
[50:38] the one who was trying to kill Moses the
[50:42] one who was trying to drown him
[50:44] why because you've seen the program of
[50:47] God
[50:48] with the life of Moses in the same way
[50:52] not families that died
[50:55] he was in the beginning
[50:59] he saw the plugin of God and now the
[51:03] Redeemer was going to come through
[51:07] immediately
[51:14] that God was going to use
[51:19] it no wonder your life
[51:23] Hallelujah man I wanted to remember
[51:25] about your life
[51:26] from the time you were a baby
[51:29] the devil has been at your case
[51:35] some of you even had ever tried
[51:37] witchcraft
[51:56] and he will try something to take away
[52:00] the joy of the Lord out of your life
[52:02] and he will throw things at you to try
[52:06] and kill you but let me tell you church
[52:09] when God has a program
[52:12] God thinks a program
