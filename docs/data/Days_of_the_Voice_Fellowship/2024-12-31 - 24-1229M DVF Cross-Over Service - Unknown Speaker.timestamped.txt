[2:05:52] Brother
[2:05:54] Martin I just wanted to come and say a
[2:05:56] few a few
[2:06:00] comments being that this is the end of
[2:06:02] the
[2:06:03] year I hope you don't mind standing for
[2:06:05] a
[2:06:06] minute uh just to change the
[2:06:10] position uh since Brother Martin joined
[2:06:13] uh the the fellowship
[2:06:16] here he found when we had um had we
[2:06:21] already moved where is Brother
[2:06:23] Martin had we moved to the other
[2:06:28] place yeah I think um he used to visit
[2:06:31] us when we were still in the home
[2:06:33] fellowship and then uh he was praying
[2:06:36] about that time he was praying about
[2:06:41] joining then the Lord spoke to
[2:06:44] him I'm so glad that most of the people
[2:06:47] that came from other fellowships to come
[2:06:49] and join the work here and support the
[2:06:57] God spoke to
[2:06:59] them and um that's a very good thing
[2:07:02] because I don't believe in in poring
[2:07:04] from other
[2:07:08] churches I believe in you know God doing
[2:07:11] his own work his own
[2:07:14] way and so Brother Martin came and
[2:07:17] joined us with his
[2:07:19] wife sister Winnie

[2:08:18] all his heart

[3:13:17] I used to play
[3:13:26] in the evening that even when during
[3:13:29] Wednesdays and
[3:13:32] Fridays the point that I would have a
[3:13:36] little bit of debate in my mind whether
[3:13:38] I should I should leave church
[3:13:42] [Music]
[3:13:43] and but sometimes I would do it I
[3:13:47] said let me go and
[3:13:51] play many times I would come to church
[3:13:54] because of social
[3:14:01] pressure was
[3:14:04] slave sometimes many times at
[3:14:07] home during the evening
[3:14:11] altar we are praying but say let us pray
[3:14:17] immediately they say let us
[3:14:21] pray my mind turns off turns off to like

[3:14:47] go
[3:14:50] completely what would remind me to come
[3:14:52] back is amen
[3:14:55] amen Disturbed me I wondered so much
[3:15:00] sometimes it
[3:15:01] wasn't but other pictures which
[3:15:04] come pict which come to my
[3:15:09] mind Disturbed me overnight
[3:15:14] but until I almost owned it but I didn't
[3:15:17] own
[3:15:19] it but I
[3:15:21] thank I thank God when I entered
[3:15:26] 2024 I I
[3:15:32] it right now I'm not a slave to
[3:15:37] football yes another thing that I'm
[3:15:39] thankful to God that I finished
[3:15:45] my I
[3:15:47] this
[3:15:48] year but the journey it has all been by
[3:15:51] the of
[3:15:54] God began inor
[3:15:56] one getting just aancy at school
[3:16:02] was thousands apply for that
[3:16:12] SCH parents normally sit sleep they
[3:16:15] don't go back home they sit
[3:16:21] straight to the pement
[3:16:26] the
[3:16:30] night for to come and open
[3:16:35] the just came came with
[3:16:39] momm didn't take more
[3:16:45] minutes Senor 2 yes it was in senior one
[3:16:48] when I was baptized I was
[3:17:03] going you normally sit in
[3:17:07] groups you sit in groups of
[3:17:11] like discuss resarch you come and
[3:17:14] present as a
[3:17:17] so the group I was
[3:17:20] in my life was deading
[3:17:25] massively was really
[3:17:28] deading as a Christian I knew if
[3:17:38] I that group was second it was near the
[3:17:42] chard you
[3:17:45] could so I told myself that the sake of
[3:17:50] God let me go and sit
[3:17:54] behind a group behind
[3:17:56] there actually when when I realiz my
[3:18:00] life was
[3:18:03] degrading just leave it just leave the
[3:18:06] group it was hard
[3:18:10] to but I
[3:18:13] left someone that
[3:18:20] David who had
[3:18:23] Fighters but many of them when
[3:18:28] the many of
[3:18:32] them only three
[3:18:34] Remain the one who amazed me was the
[3:18:36] last
[3:18:39] one he knew the Philistines are coming
[3:18:42] to
[3:18:45] attack but what he did he rushed to
[3:18:49] where they are immediately and killed
[3:18:50] all of
[3:18:54] them killed
[3:18:58] thousands my point is that you should
[3:19:01] act when God speaks you act before
[3:19:06] they the spirit of philes is a
[3:19:12] devil who comes to the mind
[3:19:14] that's that's the greatest ever
[3:19:19] I want
[3:19:21] for I acted
[3:19:25] immediately I left there
[3:19:27] I and moving isn't
[3:19:32] easy what because the truth was
[3:19:41] mying at the back seat I couldn't even
[3:19:43] see properly
[3:19:47] and I said to myself let me
[3:19:50] first said the next time I come come and
[3:19:54] sit in
[3:19:58] front the people of this previous
[3:20:04] group they at me but had to that

[3:37:03] um
[3:37:04] even before the year

[3:37:14] were when we
[3:37:16] I and sister when we were
[3:37:19] trying in these occasions where I went
[3:37:21] to meet
[3:37:23] Pastor when we were planning for the
[3:37:27] wedding and the
[3:37:29] introduction so one time we went to see
[3:37:33] p and sister reached
[3:37:37] late she reached
[3:37:41] around around 8
[3:37:45] and our our appointment was supposed to
[3:37:48] be at
[3:37:53] 6 I think if I'm don't I think we found
[3:37:58] Pastor there waiting for
[3:38:01] us I don't recall very
[3:38:04] well so we had that
[3:38:07] meeting we finished that meeting
[3:38:12] lat around 10
[3:38:17] and uh I was supposed to
[3:38:21] ride sister back to
[3:38:26] where
[3:38:29] motorcycle but it was
[3:38:33] far
[3:38:35] and I just recall that scenario when I
[3:38:39] was
[3:38:40] coming actually it's what forced me to
[3:38:42] come and give this testimony
[3:38:46] then Pastor told
[3:38:48] us that after the wedding very soon God
[3:38:52] will bless you with

[3:39:06] Lord I want to be sincere to
[3:39:10] you me I did not see it coming at that
[3:39:13] time

[5:45:34] Bear my name before the Gentiles
[5:45:37] and Kings and the children of
[5:45:42] [Music]
[5:45:53] Israel for I will show him how great
[5:45:57] things he must suffer for my name's sake
[5:46:08] amen let's have a word of prayer
[5:46:11] precious Ling
[5:46:12] father thank you precious Ling
[5:46:15] father for your presence
[5:46:17] Lord God which we have heard even
[5:46:21] before before the service has ended
[5:46:24] Lord we know your presence
[5:46:27] is reading of your word
[5:46:30] Lord I ask that you come
[5:46:33] Lord and break it down to your people
[5:46:37] speak to them
[5:46:39] personally Jesus and
[5:46:41] fulfill purpose which Lord you want
[5:46:51] to bless you
[5:46:54] Saints amen happy New
[5:46:58] Year amen amen today I want to speak
[5:47:02] about a very short topic
[5:47:07] it says for his name's
[5:47:10] sake for his name
[5:47:12] sake hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so
[5:47:17] you see in
[5:47:18] life many people do
[5:47:22] things for certain
[5:47:25] reason amen
[5:47:27] amen men get married
[5:47:32] mared amen for certain
[5:47:35] purposes amen amen a man marries because
[5:47:40] he wants to to bring forth
[5:47:44] his he want to extend his his his
[5:47:49] seed amen amen so a man would
[5:47:55] marry when a man
[5:47:57] marries when they get married to a woman
[5:48:00] that woman gets the name of
[5:48:04] that amen woman becomes part of
[5:48:09] that
[5:48:11] amen so there there are three three ways
[5:48:14] you can enter into a family of a
[5:48:20] man legally here in the
[5:48:23] earth amen one of it is getting married
[5:48:27] if you're a
[5:48:29] woman when you get married to that man
[5:48:33] you receive your his
[5:48:34] name amen amen for example
[5:48:39] brother his wife
[5:48:44] amen before she came she was not
[5:48:48] sister but when she got married
[5:48:51] to she obtain the name
[5:48:54] of there's another way of getting
[5:48:57] joining in a family of a
[5:49:00] man the second the second way is by
[5:49:05] adoption
[5:49:08] amen I can enter into
[5:49:12] brother if he adts
[5:49:16] me and he gives me his name I
[5:49:21] become because he has given me the other
[5:49:25] way is being
[5:49:26] born
[5:49:28] naturally amen when you are born
[5:49:30] naturally
[5:49:32] father
[5:49:35] automatically you have the
[5:49:38] amen so
[5:49:41] God all the time wanted to have
[5:49:45] people who are called by his he wanted
[5:49:48] to have a wife who is called by his he
[5:49:52] wanted to have children who are called
[5:49:55] by
[5:49:56] his and he wanted to adopt
[5:49:59] children and he gives them his name
[5:50:02] hallelujah hallelujah I mean I I want to
[5:50:05] give another background
[5:50:11] of
[5:50:12] recent the in USA they were having
[5:50:16] election amen and the president who was
[5:50:21] elected his theme
[5:50:24] was that to make America
[5:50:28] greater amen he say that the name of
[5:50:32] America is no longer
[5:50:34] feared we are being laughed at
[5:50:37] yet we we had
[5:50:39] power we were powerful amen so he said
[5:50:43] I'm going give me your
[5:50:45] voice I'm going to make America
[5:50:49] great hallelujah amen that is a man
[5:50:53] and he loved his country he loved the
[5:50:57] name of his country Hallelujah and even
[5:51:01] us in our
[5:51:03] walk our God wants his name to be
[5:51:08] great amen and for his name to be great
[5:51:12] can't be great when you who are called
[5:51:15] by his name you are not great when he
[5:51:19] for him to be great you have to be
[5:51:23] great because you are called by
[5:51:25] his Hallelujah and there are certain
[5:51:28] things which he does
[5:51:33] because you are called by his
[5:51:35] name examp the Bible tells us when the
[5:51:39] children of
[5:51:40] [Music]
[5:51:42] isra
[5:51:43] Amen when they were coming from Egypt
[5:51:47] amen God wanted to
[5:51:50] destroy amen but Moses reasoned
[5:51:54] with he told God these are your people
[5:51:58] they are called
[5:51:59] by amen and God
[5:52:03] changed he said now I'm not going to
[5:52:05] destroy
[5:52:07] but I'm going to leave them to
[5:52:09] die and their children will be the ones
[5:52:12] to
[5:52:13] enter in the promised land why because
[5:52:17] he never wanted his
[5:52:18] name to be laughed upon his name to be
[5:52:23] sa upon the
[5:52:25] Heathen these people were woring a
[5:52:29] certain
[5:52:31] God he told them he's going to get them
[5:52:33] from
[5:52:34] EGP to the promised land
[5:52:37] but he failed
[5:52:38] them amen so he said I'm not going to
[5:52:43] let my
[5:52:45] name be be left upon amen amen so as I
[5:52:51] told you human beings we are
[5:52:55] born in this human flesh amen we are not
[5:53:00] born as children
[5:53:02] of as I told there are three
[5:53:04] ways you can become a
[5:53:07] you can get that name
[5:53:09] of Amen being born you should be born
[5:53:12] with the
[5:53:13] spirit hallelujah or you have to get
[5:53:17] married you receive his name amen Pastor
[5:53:22] the other time was preaching to
[5:53:23] us about the
[5:53:27] king the
[5:53:31] king amen uh the the the the the queen
[5:53:36] who was who rejected the call of the of
[5:53:39] the
[5:53:42] king the king had married
[5:53:44] her amen she had the name of the
[5:53:49] king and she rejected to
[5:53:52] obey the call of the king so when these
[5:53:55] men came to the
[5:53:56] king told the king
[5:53:59] this has said she has her own part amen
[5:54:04] so these men told him
[5:54:06] can it be
[5:54:07] hard throughout all the
[5:54:12] proves that the queen that you
[5:54:15] married called her and she
[5:54:20] rejected amen amen the men the wives of
[5:54:24] the Men start disobeying
[5:54:28] them and the people will
[5:54:32] start disobeying you they will not
[5:54:34] respect your name
[5:54:37] amen so the king decided to get a
[5:54:42] queen because he wanted his name don't
[5:54:46] to be
[5:54:47] ashamed my brother my sister if you
[5:54:50] received the holy
[5:54:51] spirit amen God has given you his
[5:54:54] name you have his name
[5:54:57] in amen and whatever you are going
[5:55:00] through whatever you went through last
[5:55:03] year amen you had that that that the
[5:55:07] other name your natural name you
[5:55:13] are but now he has given you
[5:55:16] his Amen Let us let us open the uh
[5:55:20] Psalms
[5:55:32] 251
[5:55:34] amen it says what for thy name's sake oh
[5:55:38] Lord pardon my iniquity for it is
[5:55:53] great David wrote
[5:55:55] thiss it was a time of
[5:55:57] Tri it was a time of
[5:56:00] test amen when his enemies had had risen
[5:56:04] upon Hallelujah so he made a prayer and
[5:56:08] say name
[5:56:10] s Lord my iniquity for it is
[5:56:15] great amen what did David Point God
[5:56:19] at he pointed God at
[5:56:22] his amen he said that pardon my
[5:56:27] in Amen in Psalms 23
[5:56:31] three he says he Resto my soul he leadth
[5:56:37] me in the paths of righteousness for his
[5:56:40] name
[5:56:41] sake amen God leads
[5:56:44] us the
[5:56:46] of for his name s David being a king
[5:56:51] upon many
[5:56:52] men and
[5:56:54] Nations God LED his
[5:56:58] Paths of right because the people would
[5:57:03] recognize his great name
[5:57:07] amen God
[5:57:10] purposed to make David walk in the paths
[5:57:15] of why because David was called by the
[5:57:18] name
[5:57:19] of Amen David when he was
[5:57:23] anointed he was anointed to be a
[5:57:27] king a physical King on behal of
[5:57:31] God Amen so he was a representative of
[5:57:35] God
[5:57:36] amen so he was standing there
[5:57:40] representing the name
[5:57:42] ofj God make sure he had to
[5:57:46] walk
[5:57:48] of Hallelujah Hallelujah for his name
[5:57:51] sake amen Amen brother Dan
[5:57:55] preached he read in
[5:57:59] acts when Paul met the pillar of
[5:58:03] fire amen and I read here as I read let
[5:58:07] me read
[5:58:09] again I want to show you something
[5:58:13] there
[5:58:15] amen acts
[5:58:19] 9:15 this is
[5:58:21] God now he
[5:58:24] speaking uh okay let me start from verse
[5:58:28] 12
[5:58:30] 16 he said and he has seen in a vision a
[5:58:34] man named ananas coming in and putting
[5:58:38] his hand on
[5:58:44] him that he may receive his
[5:58:48] sight then ananas answered
[5:58:51] Lord I have heard by many of this man
[5:58:55] how much evil he hath done to thy Saints
[5:58:58] at Jerusalem
[5:59:06] [Music]
[5:59:11] [Music]
[5:59:14] amen and here he had Authority from the
[5:59:17] chief chief priests to bind all that
[5:59:20] call on
[5:59:24] [Music]
[5:59:29] thy amen but the Lord said unto
[5:59:32] him go thy way for he is a
[5:59:38] chosen unto me to Bear My
[5:59:43] Name the
[5:59:45] Gentiles KS and the children for I will
[5:59:48] show him how great things he must suffer
[5:59:53] for my
[5:59:57] name amen so Paul the Bible tells us
[6:00:02] that we were chosen before the
[6:00:04] foundation of the
[6:00:06] amen so so Paul before even he was born
[6:00:11] he was already
[6:00:13] chosen amen before you were
[6:00:16] born before you were
[6:00:18] born when you come to this
[6:00:21] earth you come already having a
[6:00:24] father amen
[6:00:30] amen
[6:00:32] before brother and sister
[6:00:37] amen amen they they came here amen they
[6:00:41] never had
[6:00:43] Israel amen were two isra was not in
[6:00:49] the amen so when he was
[6:00:52] born
[6:00:54] already already him being
[6:00:57] born already he had a father
[6:01:06] amen so before Paul even before he was
[6:01:10] born
[6:01:13] already amen he had already hallelujah
[6:01:16] hallelujah so he he just
[6:01:18] needed
[6:01:20] preached a point
[6:01:23] of to
[6:01:25] recognize his father amen it didn't
[6:01:29] matter whatever he
[6:01:31] did you know when when you when you
[6:01:34] believe the devil lik pointing you to
[6:01:38] your
[6:01:39] mistakes before you you
[6:01:42] believe and you become you become
[6:01:46] chained amen amen but but here the Bible
[6:01:50] is telling
[6:01:51] us that this man
[6:01:54] sa even you see as God was speaking
[6:01:59] to anas told him that this man has been
[6:02:07] amen he has been
[6:02:09] pers but what did God say God I chose
[6:02:14] him amen hallelujah it doesn't matter
[6:02:19] whatever he did I chose him amen bear my
[6:02:24] name upon the
[6:02:27] Gentiles hallelujah hallelujah and in
[6:02:30] this age my brother my sister we are
[6:02:34] called to Bear the name of
[6:02:37] to declare
[6:02:40] the as I told you that the the other way
[6:02:45] of being
[6:02:47] born
[6:02:50] adoption we are given the spirit of
[6:02:54] God which is the spirit of
[6:02:58] AD amen so when you are given the spirit
[6:03:01] of
[6:03:02] God you have Beed his name
[6:03:07] because you you have the name of your
[6:03:11] father amen amen that's how you
[6:03:14] bear the name of the Lord hallelujah
[6:03:19] amen so there are certain things which
[6:03:20] will
[6:03:22] happen when you bear the name
[6:03:24] of sometimes you be in this life and
[6:03:28] you'll be
[6:03:29] afflicted you will be uh having needs
[6:03:32] here and
[6:03:34] there amen
[6:03:36] amen and often
[6:03:39] times you get weak in your
[6:03:41] faith Hallelujah you get weak in
[6:03:45] your amen the Bible tells
[6:03:48] us amen that whatever we shall
[6:03:53] ask shall do it am sometimes you
[6:03:58] fear you have a
[6:04:00] faith of believing that your
[6:04:04] level you are
[6:04:06] working is
[6:04:09] 500,000 amen that is your level
[6:04:15] of Amen the Bible says that whatever
[6:04:20] shall ask
[6:04:21] the
[6:04:23] whatever
[6:04:25] whatever amen I shall give it unto you
[6:04:29] amen if you pray in my name amen and the
[6:04:33] prophet tells us amen that you ask for
[6:04:36] big
[6:04:38] things amen ask for big things
[6:04:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[6:04:46] imagine

[6:04:54] rejecting
[6:04:55] uh uh to to use the cow
[6:05:02] brother amen oh sister
[6:05:08] refusing to drive the
[6:05:12] car
[6:05:14] brother amen yet he's
[6:05:18] married whatever he has she
[6:05:22] has amen whatever God has we have
[6:05:28] whatever belongs to him it belongs to us
[6:05:32] Amen brother Mar was preaching
[6:05:35] about our
[6:05:36] inheritance amen let me tell you my
[6:05:40] brother you have his
[6:05:43] name let me tell you something the B
[6:05:46] tell that the people if the people who
[6:05:49] are called by my

[6:06:07] hears last year many people were in
[6:06:11] churches they were calling upon

[6:38:59] all have learned to depend upon his
[6:39:07] word
[6:39:09] hallelujah they have given me 10 minutes
[6:39:12] and now I have five I think or
[6:39:15] four I want to begin by reading a
[6:39:20] scripture in the book of
[6:39:24] [Music]
[6:39:26] ecclesiast chter
[6:39:30] 9 amen amen I have a luganda Bible I
[6:39:34] don't have English I don't know somebody
[6:39:39] canuga uh ecclesiast chapter
[6:39:44] 9 God bless you my
[6:39:46] brother are you happy to be in the year
[6:39:51] 2025 Give the Lord a mighty hand of
[6:39:54] praise for the
[6:39:58] opportunity one day one preacher said
[6:40:03] every time God gives you a new
[6:40:09] year he is giving you a new
[6:40:13] opportunity to make things
[6:40:16] right to do things
[6:40:18] better to fight in a better
[6:40:22] way so a new
[6:40:25] year in other
[6:40:27] words is a new
[6:40:29] opportunity I want to thank God for the
[6:40:32] decision we made with my family four
[6:40:35] years
[6:40:40] ago we were living in a very big
[6:40:45] church and the Lord spoke to
[6:40:48] us to come and be a part of
[6:40:53] dvf fellow and and we thought it was our
[6:40:57] ego our
[6:41:01] thought and uh and then we told the we
[6:41:04] told the pastor we were
[6:41:08] with and you know I've realized
[6:41:11] something about
[6:41:14] myself nobody can be with me and want to
[6:41:17] part with
[6:41:21] me amen I've seen it through through my
[6:41:25] lifetime when I stay with people they
[6:41:27] don't want me to
[6:41:32] go learned something when I was
[6:41:36] growing that if I choose to do
[6:41:39] something I do it the best way I
[6:41:44] can so sometimes it makes people I live
[6:41:47] with it makes it hard for them to get
[6:41:50] rid of
[6:41:52] me so it was such a big a big big
[6:41:58] battle but we made a
[6:42:02] decision and ever since we made that
[6:42:05] decision we have never
[6:42:08] regretted we have seen troubles and
[6:42:12] tears but God has stood with
[6:42:16] us and we are on the winning
[6:42:19] side when I was
[6:42:22] growing I was a person who never waited
[6:42:25] to be told to do
[6:42:28] something I could do everything which I
[6:42:31] see needs to be done
[6:42:35] and when I joined my
[6:42:38] pastor he has been an immen blessing in
[6:42:42] my
[6:42:45] life let me speak this from the bottom
[6:42:47] of my
[6:42:50] heart take it the way it
[6:42:53] is one day Paul said it is me not the
[6:42:59] Lord so it ising
[6:43:03] before I met
[6:43:06] Pastor I was living a very bad
[6:43:09] life which I didn't
[6:43:12] like I was sleeping
[6:43:15] bad my life was not good by the
[6:43:18] way but ever since God you know the
[6:43:21] preacher talked about and encounter
[6:43:23] something that there are people you meet
[6:43:26] in this life and their Destiny
[6:43:31] Chang ever since my life and my family
[6:43:34] we
[6:43:37] met let me tell you we have had our best
[6:43:42] times in
[6:43:45] life I never knew that somebody can love
[6:43:48] you with all your
[6:43:52] we
[6:43:58] that I am a weird man
[6:44:03] me I can't sleep angry if I know can
[6:44:07] give
[6:44:12] me I tell pastor today this morning we
[6:44:16] are waking up there is no food in the
[6:44:21] house and Pastor hased
[6:44:26] us hased
[6:44:29] us has been a
[6:44:31] blessing and we have been doing all God
[6:44:35] has given us power to
[6:44:40] do I want to thank God for dvf
[6:44:47] Ministry some of you are thinking
[6:44:49] brother is speaking as if he's Bing
[6:44:54] fwell I'm not going anywhere
[6:45:03] to call me to a different place he
[6:45:04] doesn't he's not AF Fe going he doesn't
[6:45:07] Fe leaving I have left for him a lot of
[6:45:09] sons
[6:45:13] here but God has given us Grace to stand
[6:45:16] in the Sunday
[6:45:20] School I've realized one thing in this
[6:45:23] life you cannot do
[6:45:28] everything and you cannot do
[6:45:31] anything it is very good to find your
[6:45:39] purpose and then you stick to eat
[6:45:43] whatsoever
[6:45:48] what ecclesiast chapter 9 as I
[6:45:53] finish I'm starting from vers
[6:45:57] 8 let thy garments be always White and
[6:46:03] let thy head lack no
[6:46:18] ointment it is not
[6:46:22] [Music]
[6:46:26] aall that you're going to cross from one
[6:46:28] side of the wall and go the the other
[6:46:30] side of the wall you're going to remain
[6:46:31] the same you
[6:46:34] everything about you your head your ears
[6:46:37] everything you're going to remain the
[6:46:40] same
[6:46:41] you but what makes it a new
[6:46:46] year to brother Dan who is coming in my
[6:46:49] feet what makes it a new
[6:46:55] ministry it is not if you
[6:47:00] don't if you don't understand the
[6:47:03] the the reality of something
[6:47:08] [Music]
[6:47:09] new you are going to remain the same as
[6:47:12] you have always remained the
[6:47:17] same if you remain with the same
[6:47:22] thoughts same
[6:47:24] problems same
[6:47:27] house same
[6:47:31] attitude same
[6:47:34] friends same same
[6:47:37] everything might be
[6:47:40] new but you remain
[6:47:46] old
[6:47:49] brother now the Bible says let thy Gars
[6:47:53] be always
[6:47:56] white if your garments in the last new
[6:47:59] were not white let this year keep your
[6:48:02] garment
[6:48:09] and let head lack no
[6:48:16] ointment you will need another anointing
[6:48:19] to make something new in this another
[6:48:22] year
[6:48:39] the very same way that you have been all
[6:48:41] the past years amen amen you will need a
[6:48:44] new
[6:48:48] anointment the Bible says that live
[6:48:50] joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest
[6:48:53] all the days of your life
[6:49:12] all the single here the male you should
[6:49:14] Mar one of my greatest strength in my
[6:49:17] journey of ministry and life is my
[6:49:25] marriage
[6:49:27] amen when we fall we fall together
[6:49:32] the damage is not
[6:49:35] big very many times we have
[6:49:39] failed we
[6:49:48] have but our Union and Oneness of
[6:49:52] Purpose with my wife has been my
[6:49:55] greatest strength
[6:50:04] I want to thank you my
[6:50:25] wife brother you people are always
[6:50:28] boting about or about cannot be the
[6:50:31] brother when I don't have sleep she's my

[6:50:38] food when I don't when I can't walk she
[6:50:41] becomes my legs to
[6:50:51] walk
[6:50:58] bless the brother and the sister the
[6:51:00] brother says that the Lord rather take
[6:51:12] marry and get a child that you may learn
[6:51:14] how to handle children when you have
[6:51:16] your
[6:51:27] own this is the verse I'm giving to you

[6:52:38] praise the
[6:52:40] Lord thank you for those words brother
[6:52:45] Henry I know I remember when I was uh I
[6:52:51] I know what brother Dan must be
[6:52:58] feeling when I first started preaching
[6:53:03] I was 13 years
[6:53:05] old who is 1 years old
[6:53:10] here please lift up your hand let me
[6:53:13] see
[6:53:18] old 12 year
[6:53:22] old
[6:53:26] 14 ah okay you
[6:53:29] come ah you look big
[6:53:35] ah God bless
[6:53:37] you you a little older than I
[6:53:41] was
[6:53:44] was when I
[6:53:47] preaching and it was in the Anglican
[6:53:50] Church standing before more than 300
[6:53:55] people the first time my feet was
[6:53:59] shaking beating against each other
[6:54:02] because of fear and
[6:54:05] anxiety but when the spirit of God would
[6:54:07] come upon
[6:54:09] me I become so bold and I cease to
[6:54:14] fear ah I was
[6:54:17] small but God used
[6:54:20] me so the Bible
[6:54:23] says let no
[6:54:28] man desp your youth
[6:54:32] I also agree with brother
[6:54:35] Henry brother Dan will marry at the
[6:54:38] right
[6:54:40] time but if God calls
[6:54:44] you what did the scripture
[6:54:46] say whatsoever God bless you whatsoever
[6:54:49] your hand finds to
[6:54:53] do do it with all thy
[6:54:57] mind with all thy
[6:55:00] might I've been an evangelist traveling
[6:55:02] on the
[6:55:04] road I've been a pastor several
[6:55:07] times others regard me as an apostle
[6:55:11] whatever sometime I was a song

[7:05:33] news which seemed to be
[7:05:36] impossible praise the Lord and Sarah had
[7:05:40] lost
[7:05:42] hope she was
[7:05:44] baren

[7:05:49] about
[7:05:50] it such a long
[7:05:53] time to have a
[7:05:55] son and at this old
[7:05:58] age she had lost hope
[7:06:02] praise the
[7:06:03] Lord she knew it is
[7:06:06] impossible she was even
[7:06:09] old then how can this man say that he's

[7:06:18] heart praise the Lord let us continue
[7:06:25] here
[7:06:27] amen verse
[7:06:29] 13 and the Lord said unto to
[7:06:33] Abraham where far did Sarah laugh saying
[7:06:37] shall I of sure shall I
[7:06:43] of sure bear a child which I'm
[7:07:00] old is anything too hard for the
[7:07:06] Lord at the time appointed I'll return
[7:07:10] unto thee according to the time of life
[7:07:13] and Sarah shall have a son
[7:07:26] amen then s night saying I laugh not for

[7:43:37] to go with this
[7:43:42] year it is not call it as if it
[7:43:49] is well you've believed your
[7:43:53] healing but you're not yet
[7:43:56] healed but you believe you are healed so
[7:43:59] you should confess you are
[7:44:01] here you remember that
[7:44:05] testimony and I always um uh if you can
[7:44:08] tell deacons if you can bring in
[7:44:10] everybody who is
[7:44:12] outside we want to now finish our our
[7:44:16] service you know I I I've shared this
[7:44:19] with um sister Diana many
[7:44:24] times
[7:44:26] that the testimony of the man who was
[7:44:31] blind he came in a prayer
[7:44:34] line andam prayed over him but before he
[7:44:38] prayed for him he asked him do you
[7:44:41] believe me to be God's
[7:44:45] prophet he said yes you believe if I
[7:44:48] pray for you God will make you
[7:44:51] all he said yes he said okay let us pray
[7:44:56] so he prayed and after he said
[7:44:59] amen he opened his eyes he said I can't
[7:45:04] see he said go on your way
[7:45:07] believing God will heal you so the man
[7:45:11] went and after a while he realized he
[7:45:14] was not
[7:45:15] seeing he came back again in the prayer
[7:45:18] line and many of us do that mistake many
[7:45:22] times we come we pray over the same
[7:45:25] matter over and over and over and over
[7:45:29] but we need to believe and start
[7:45:33] confessing and then brother bam told
[7:45:35] this
[7:45:37] man uh when he came back in the prayer
[7:45:40] line you said the man said to him you
[7:45:44] told me that I was
[7:45:48] healed but I'm still
[7:45:50] blind he said but you told me you
[7:45:52] believed
[7:45:55] me said yes I believed
[7:45:57] you if believed me go your way you are
[7:46:02] healed not you will be
[7:46:05] healed you are healed you are seeing and
[7:46:10] yet the man was still
[7:46:12] blind but the prophet was telling him
[7:46:14] you are seeing you
[7:46:18] are and then when he left he was told to
[7:46:23] keep saying these words by his stripes
[7:46:26] I'm Healed by his stripes I'm heal
[7:46:29] tell your neighbor by his stripes I'm
[7:46:32] Healed by his stripes I'm
[7:46:35] Healed and the man kept on saying
[7:46:38] that he kept on
[7:46:40] confessing saying those things which
[7:46:42] were
[7:46:43] not as if they were out and then one day
[7:46:48] his eyes
[7:46:49] boom opened up praise the name of the
[7:46:53] Lord so also our sister Diana's
[7:46:57] eyes listen ch
[7:46:59] are you hearing God is able to open
[7:47:05] them you people don't believe that do
[7:47:07] you believe that God is able to open
[7:47:11] them
[7:47:12] amen amen and we are able to call those
[7:47:16] things which are
[7:47:17] not as if they they are praise the name
[7:47:21] of the Lord if the Lord can do for that
[7:47:24] for us that year that thing this
[7:47:27] year oh we can be is so
[7:47:30] happy praise the name of the Lord you
[7:47:34] want some miracles for this
[7:47:35] year God is able to do miracles for this
[7:47:38] year to do the impossible things and the
[7:47:42] one thing that touched me as the brother
[7:47:43] was
[7:47:45] preaching do you think there were not
[7:47:49] many roads that would have made them go
[7:47:52] to the promised
[7:47:56] land and were many but God left all of
[7:48:00] them and he took them in the impossible
[7:48:05] one the Red Sea because he
[7:48:10] specializes in things thought
[7:48:14] impossible praise the Lord hallelujah
