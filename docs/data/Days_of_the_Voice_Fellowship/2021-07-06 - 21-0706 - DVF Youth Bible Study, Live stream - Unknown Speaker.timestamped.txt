[27:36] i'm not here today
[27:46] which
[28:00] uh
[28:14] foreign
[28:20] what the devil will do is try to heal
[28:22] the young people
[28:23] to serve the lord but i just love it
[28:26] when young people say no
[28:27] i will serve a lot
[28:42] sister sarah i don't i don't know if
[28:46] she's on youtube
[28:48] is she a part of this meeting
[28:53] okay i am wondering how people can be
[28:57] alleged even for online meetings where
[29:00] the meetings are where the other changes
[29:01] are where they are but they're still
[29:03] late for reach
[29:04] it is really absurd you know it's always
[29:06] good for us as soon as young people
[29:08] to always be punctual it's always good
[29:11] to be punctual
[29:12] those who have come a bit early god
[29:14] bless god bless each of you
[29:16] and we have a wonderful time so we have
[29:20] questions and also we have
[29:24] a chapter to cover today we may
[29:27] not of course finish the whole chapter
[29:29] but at least we will uh we will be able
[29:31] to cover
[29:32] as much as we can be able to come for
[29:34] today praise the lord
[29:36] so how many have finished the batman's
[29:38] vision
[29:42] but you've not finished yet who hasn't
[29:45] finished the partner's vision
[29:47] where's your almost finishing
[29:52] okay only two are bad things why are you
[29:54] not proof
[30:03] okay but have you finished why are we
[30:05] not finished
[30:20] did you find a problem what happened
[30:30] really if you've not finished the fast
[30:33] motivation then it should happen
[30:38] [Music]
[30:59] [Music]
[31:02] um
[31:06] [Music]
[31:58] uh
[32:26] um
[32:37] [Music]
[32:40] uh
[32:58] [Music]
[33:36] uh
[35:18] they say that jesus is
[35:31] [Music]
[35:43] [Music]
[35:51] [Music]
[35:56] uh
[36:01] [Music]
[36:16] [Music]
[36:38] brother
[36:43] [Music]
[36:52] okay
[37:19] is better now
[37:25] maybe somebody can try to get it
[37:40] is that better
[38:19] it will continue growing that's being
[38:22] produced apples instead
[38:25] but if the vine
[38:28] was a branch for his own it will produce
[38:31] oranges meaning that
[38:35] it was like jesus is defined and
[38:38] many other other patients have come
[38:42] and have been grafted and they think
[38:56] [Music]
[38:59] but if that that way
[39:02] produces a branch of its own it will
[39:05] produce
[39:06] we can produce oranges that is
[39:12] that with jesus if jesus
[39:16] can produce you can produce
[39:20] the original you can be an original
[39:24] christian like the christians
[39:27] and also i learned about
[39:30] the lonely day i like that the last day
[39:34] is
[39:36] the day of
[39:40] the day of
[39:53] okay so the first question where is your
[39:56] book do you want to
[39:57] show us where you read the first
[39:58] question that you've been trying to
[39:59] explain about the vines and the original
[40:01] branches and all that
[43:13] when those other branches were grafted
[43:15] in all they would do
[43:18] all they would do was bear their own
[43:20] food
[43:21] for they were not born of that veil
[43:24] they don't know about that original life
[43:28] and origin they don't know about that
[43:31] original life and original fruit
[43:33] they cannot know for they were not born
[43:36] in it
[43:37] but if they have been born in it the
[43:39] same life
[43:40] that was in the original stem jesus
[43:43] would have come to them
[43:44] and manifested through them john 14
[43:47] john 14 12 says very literally i say and
[43:52] he has been
[43:53] [Music]
[44:04] the works that i do shall keep also and
[44:08] greater works than his shall he do
[44:10] because i go unto my father
[44:13] denominations which are man directed
[44:15] cannot be born of god
[44:17] for it is the spirit not man that gives
[44:19] life
[44:21] feeling is how clearly it is between
[44:25] all those seven livestreams
[44:29] let's see so i think uh
[44:32] i've been trying to look for my
[44:34] earphones so i can be able to monitor
[44:36] the sound but for some reason i'm not
[44:38] seeing them
[44:39] but from what the brother has been
[44:43] reading
[44:44] it is i don't know if others understand
[44:46] what he was trying to explain
[44:48] that he understands do you understand is
[44:50] there someone who doesn't understand
[44:52] why the brother was reading
[44:55] yes okay brother
[44:58] brother before what do you understand
[45:01] from what he was reading
[45:07] [Music]
[45:17] that the foreign
[45:42] but if another tree matches up
[45:58] we're talking about the original life
[46:01] you know there's a song we're seeing the
[46:02] original line
[46:04] the only genesis can you give us that
[46:06] song the original
[46:08] what is what i believe
[46:12] the son of man is revealed the seventh
[46:16] scene
[46:17] is unveiled the original
[46:20] the original sea that original life
[46:24] which was in the beginning
[46:25] it is the same life that we have today
[46:28] and
[46:28] it's the attributes of god manifested
[46:31] over time
[46:32] you know it's the same you know we last
[46:34] night we were trying to
[46:36] share with the on the video on the
[46:38] recording
[46:40] uh we we were recording those videos
[46:44] which we shall be sharing in the coming
[46:47] uh few days
[46:48] and we were talking on the about the
[46:50] original life coming
[46:51] from the very first age to the last age
[46:54] so we see that
[46:54] even today that original life of jesus
[46:57] christ
[46:59] can still be dressed and found how do
[47:01] you trust it
[47:02] by the attributes give me the first
[47:04] stanza by the
[47:06] by the attributes can you minimize that
[47:08] by the attributes it says that the
[47:10] attributes
[47:11] of god which were manifested to the
[47:15] bride
[47:15] in this day when you catch the diversion
[47:19] of this message
[47:20] then you know who you are and what you
[47:23] raised up for
[47:24] then you you know indeed that you have
[47:26] that right
[47:28] that original life that original world
[47:30] which is the original life not just
[47:32] accepting it
[47:33] but then you begin to see the life of
[47:35] jesus christ actually
[47:37] you know coming through your life so
[47:40] that's
[47:40] that was a very good highlight brother
[47:42] brother sam and god bless you for that
[47:45] uh we want brother you you want to say
[47:48] something
[47:49] okay
[48:44] 24 24 10 hours
[48:48] and still would not die
[48:55] they sent him
[48:58] he gave him as someone who was which was
[49:01] a witch
[49:02] because because why when was he
[49:06] naughty when was he not attacked when he
[49:08] was
[49:09] [Music]
[49:14] born
[49:28] silicone
[49:38] [Music]
[49:40] that's what i imagined
[49:44] so yes
[49:56] the
[50:08] yeah can you read that question
[50:14] you'll notice that jonas has
[50:17] addressed their christians as a brother
[50:20] in the foundation
[50:22] who's understood
[50:35] but the people themselves
[50:53] and the testimony of jesus christ
[50:56] when arrested they tried to
[50:59] prove to kill him by boiling
[51:03] him in oil for 24 hours
[51:16] and powerless officials
[51:19] they sentenced him in the button was
[51:23] that's a witch but god was
[51:26] with him and and he was
[51:30] scared to leave
[51:33] the island and
[51:40] until this time
[51:45] until until until until the
[51:48] time of this death
[51:55] so mainly what's the lessons large here
[52:11] uh what i learned in this
[52:16] in this small question and ready that as
[52:19] a christian loving just started
[52:21] and even when when jesus was going back
[52:23] he told his disciples
[52:25] they would be persecuted but they
[52:28] shouldn't
[52:28] give up so i also see that
[52:33] john was they tried him in well and
[52:36] failed
[52:36] certainly that god they're very good who
[52:39] said
[52:40] john still capable of taking us
[52:43] through all this and then also
[52:47] him going to the island of patmos that
[52:50] actually forgot to use him
[52:52] so i also learned that even in our
[52:55] hardest trials
[52:57] everything works for the goods for
[53:01] and also really to know that uh god
[53:04] yes when we become uh when we become a
[53:08] child of god or
[53:09] become believers persecution is going to
[53:12] come yes
[53:14] persecution must come to a believer if
[53:17] you are a believer if you're a child of
[53:18] god if you're a christian
[53:20] you will always be persecuted in one way
[53:22] or the other
[53:23] so you just have to know who you are
[53:26] and what you stand for and then also god
[53:29] stands for you
[53:30] but if you don't know who you are and
[53:31] what you stand before when persecution
[53:33] comes
[53:34] you just require giving up well give up
[53:37] but to a child of god they will never
[53:40] give up
[53:42] come on you say that very slowly
[53:45] you can't give up no matter what
[53:47] persecution comes to you
[53:49] you stay you keep keeping on until you
[53:52] overcome
[53:53] praise the lord amen that was quite a
[53:56] very outstanding another outstanding
[54:01] highlight now brother
[54:05] marvin i know that you have also learned
[54:07] a lot and there's
[54:08] quite a lot that you would love to share
[54:09] with us please would you

[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:24] [Applause]
[1:03:28] uh
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:42] because
[1:03:56] uh

[1:04:10] um
[1:04:41] [Music]

[1:05:20] um
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:34] hello
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:48] oh
[1:06:02] oh
[1:06:12] [Music]
[1:06:16] oh
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:30] oh
[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:58] up
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:25] that is hidden from him that the lord
[1:07:28] did not know
[1:07:30] so i understand that
[1:07:35] now because john for him he
[1:07:38] went into the lord's day
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:53] but now the lord is still masterful
[1:07:58] he's still masterful do you mind reading
[1:08:00] for us that portion
[1:08:21] which person are you looking for maybe
[1:08:22] someone can help you get it
[1:08:41] says that those
[1:08:45] very flaming eyes of that of the judge
[1:08:48] are even now recording the lives of all
[1:08:51] the flesh
[1:08:52] running to and from throughout the earth
[1:08:55] there is nothing he does not know
[1:08:58] he knows the desires of the heart and
[1:09:00] what
[1:09:01] each one intends to do there is nothing
[1:09:04] hidden
[1:09:05] that shall not be revealed for all
[1:09:08] things are
[1:09:09] naked before hearing with whom
[1:09:13] we have to do
[1:09:16] with whom we have to think of it
[1:09:20] he knows even now what you are thinking
[1:09:24] yes there he stands as a judge with a
[1:09:27] flaming eyes
[1:09:29] made out the judgment the day of the
[1:09:32] mercy
[1:09:32] is over all that men may
[1:09:35] bend and seek his face
[1:09:39] in his radius where there is yet time
[1:09:43] that they may make his bosom their
[1:09:46] pillar
[1:09:49] the world dissolves in the fire praise
[1:09:52] the lord
[1:09:54] so here it shows us that when
[1:09:57] we are seeing the days of man but
[1:10:00] after the days of man we are going to
[1:10:02] get into the lord's day
[1:10:04] and in that lord's day our god will not
[1:10:07] be
[1:10:07] will not be having any mercy or any
[1:10:11] compassion
[1:10:12] to the sinners praise the lord will be
[1:10:15] judging the heart
[1:10:16] he'll be judging us
[1:10:19] i'm not me judging the sinners praise
[1:10:22] the lord
[1:10:24] so here the prophet tells us that we
[1:10:27] should
[1:10:28] repent when there is when they still
[1:10:31] must
[1:10:32] we should seek him when he still when he
[1:10:35] can be found
[1:10:36] praise the lord because the time is
[1:10:38] coming
[1:10:40] when his eyes will ideally the flames of
[1:10:43] fire
[1:10:44] will not be had any compassion on each
[1:10:47] one
[1:10:47] of us if we we don't take the warning of
[1:10:51] the lord
[1:10:52] so we should do whatever it is needed
[1:10:54] when we are still having pain
[1:10:59] amen praise the lord now
[1:11:03] uh i appreciate you brother
[1:11:06] we have brought a very good point a
[1:11:09] point that
[1:11:10] uh we all need to look at actually
[1:11:14] you know when you excuse me
[1:11:20] in the seventh grade for glory
[1:11:23] of the person of christ
[1:11:26] we see yes he comes his air as well as
[1:11:29] snow
[1:11:31] his eyes has fire and the brother is
[1:11:32] trying to highlight
[1:11:34] his eyes as fire do you know
[1:11:37] that jesus the same jesus that came down
[1:11:40] on this earth
[1:11:42] and died and saved man from sin
[1:11:46] is the same one going to judge yes
[1:11:49] so but right now he is not yet a judge
[1:11:52] he is seated
[1:11:55] on the master seat oh you want to call
[1:11:58] the throne of mass
[1:12:00] whatever happens in your life now all
[1:12:02] you need to do is to go before him and
[1:12:06] repent so ask him for forgiveness
[1:12:10] ask his blood to wash your sins away and
[1:12:13] your sins will just disappear
[1:12:16] just like that did you hear
[1:12:19] it's like that to the extent that you
[1:12:21] won't remember them
[1:12:23] anymore for it will make us in the sea
[1:12:25] of
[1:12:26] forgetfulness but that same god
[1:12:31] his eyes now we see
[1:12:34] are shown as the eyes of fire
[1:12:38] yes this is now as a judge
[1:12:42] and uh on friday we are going to go
[1:12:44] through the seven-fold glory
[1:12:46] of his person and one by one and we'll
[1:12:48] be able to
[1:12:50] because it's very important for us to
[1:12:51] get to know but we will be able to find
[1:12:54] out
[1:12:54] he he is the same he was the savior man
[1:12:57] who came on earth
[1:12:58] and today he is the son of god we always
[1:13:02] pray to him to
[1:13:03] forgive ourselves but he's going to also
[1:13:05] come as a judge
[1:13:07] but may god have mercy so that by the
[1:13:08] time he comes he will come when we are
[1:13:11] ready
[1:13:12] and when we have accepted the benefit of
[1:13:14] his blood
[1:13:15] you know not because you are worthy but
[1:13:17] because you have accepted the benefit
[1:13:20] of this blood that makes you holy even
[1:13:22] as he
[1:13:24] is all right god bless you brother
[1:13:31] and please try to use uh a kind of
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:35] a bigger voice so that everybody can be
[1:13:37] able to get in
[1:13:38] god bless you what's what's really
[1:13:40] touched me also
[1:13:43] in this chapter that atmosphere
[1:13:49] first of all uh his hair
[1:13:54] talks about his hair here he's as white
[1:13:57] as snow
[1:14:00] uh this
[1:14:04] all this was said by john
[1:14:07] when he had the voice and he looked
[1:14:12] again
[1:14:14] and you saw
[1:14:35] which is that
[1:14:54] watching
[1:15:02] thank you
[1:15:10] okay revelation
[1:15:14] chapter 1 verse 14 16 which which page
[1:15:18] page 53 okay
[1:15:21] now also you're speaking to some people
[1:15:24] near you you have to be at the cloud
[1:15:26] page 53 the second paragraph
[1:15:29] okay revelation chapter 1 verse 14 16.
[1:15:33] he said and his ears are white like wool
[1:15:37] as white as snow and his eyes are as a
[1:15:39] flame of fire
[1:15:40] and his feet like control the fires as
[1:15:42] if they burned in a furnace
[1:15:44] and his voice or the sound of many
[1:15:46] waters
[1:15:47] and he had that in his right hand seven
[1:15:48] stars and out of his mouth went that
[1:15:51] sharp great swag
[1:15:53] and he spoke and his conscience was as
[1:15:55] the sun shining
[1:15:56] mystery amen
[1:15:59] so now uh
[1:16:03] this chapter helped me to understand
[1:16:06] what actually this has this what it has
[1:16:08] mean
[1:16:11] this is the white hair means wisdom
[1:16:14] just as even as the human nature
[1:16:17] when many people believe that when you
[1:16:20] grow old you become weights and you get
[1:16:22] white hair so
[1:16:26] what will come in all wisdom
[1:16:31] uh it says the brilliant the white hair
[1:16:34] does not signify
[1:16:35] age but experience
[1:16:38] maturity and wisdom the eternal one does
[1:16:41] not age
[1:16:44] i mean so what is happening all wisdom
[1:16:48] of everything to judge the world
[1:16:51] then it also talks about his either the
[1:16:53] flame unfair
[1:16:55] as well explained uh there will no
[1:16:57] longer be any mercy
[1:17:00] it will just be judgment of the sinners
[1:17:04] his feet like to find
[1:17:07] like a two fine brush as if they burned
[1:17:11] in a furnace uh when we look
[1:17:14] at at his feet here it says
[1:17:19] in page 55
[1:17:22] the fourth paragraph
[1:17:25] i say its brush is knotted for its
[1:17:28] remarkable hardness there's nothing that
[1:17:30] is known
[1:17:31] that you can put it in to temper it
[1:17:37] and also down here it says fine brush
[1:17:40] signifies divine judgments a judgment
[1:17:44] that god will decree
[1:17:46] and grow to pass
[1:17:50] i mean so we'll be coming with divine
[1:17:56] judgment
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:00] then he talked about his voice his voice
[1:18:04] will be like like
[1:18:07] like the waters what it means
[1:18:12] actually that voice will be like
[1:18:16] the voice of the many prophets and the
[1:18:19] people
[1:18:20] jesus used the inside so there will be
[1:18:23] nothing to control yourself with
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:37] you'll be judged by that
[1:18:51] god bless you for that and like i said
[1:18:54] we are going to speak more about the
[1:18:57] seven-fold glory of his person
[1:19:02] when we meet again on friday
[1:19:05] but here is one thing that i also wanted
[1:19:07] to speak on from what you just said by
[1:19:09] the follicle
[1:19:10] you know envy whatever singular
[1:19:16] gray hair is seen as a sign of age
[1:19:20] yes so now someone will say oh yeah what
[1:19:22] do you say that this one is the hd one
[1:19:24] the the very old one that's why some of
[1:19:27] them have the idea
[1:19:28] but there is god the father who is there
[1:19:31] with a lot of beers
[1:19:34] and then there who is a bit young again
[1:19:36] but by now if it is this
[1:19:37] if that is the case by now even the son
[1:19:39] is very old and maybe the father is
[1:19:41] about to die
[1:19:43] because for him at all now and then the
[1:19:46] son who is enough for him
[1:19:47] everywhere that's not right why
[1:19:51] because they
[1:19:54] go god according to john chapter 1 4
[1:19:57] verse what
[1:19:59] 24 he says what john 4 24 what does it
[1:20:02] say
[1:20:17] got to worship he must watch him in the
[1:20:19] spirit
[1:20:20] and eat truth so
[1:20:23] god is not a man that ages
[1:20:27] with the time with a god there is no
[1:20:30] time how can something that happens we
[1:20:33] didn't
[1:20:34] be constrained by time god is the
[1:20:37] eternal one what is the word
[1:20:39] who is the eternal one what does it mean
[1:20:44] no beginning end that's why when we get
[1:20:46] into the spirit
[1:20:49] sometimes you worship and worship and
[1:20:50] feel like you don't want to leave that
[1:20:52] place
[1:20:54] you know what is happening around that
[1:20:56] same time
[1:20:58] you are you are entering into
[1:21:02] uh what i will call like eternity
[1:21:06] you are entering a little bit
[1:21:09] into eternity you are testing a little
[1:21:12] bit
[1:21:13] of eternity you feel like worshiping i
[1:21:15] don't know if you have ever prayed if
[1:21:16] you have never
[1:21:17] been in that um in that time or in that
[1:21:20] atmosphere then you've missed out much
[1:21:24] wherever you've been in a moment in a
[1:21:25] time where you worship and feel so
[1:21:27] straight
[1:21:28] you just say you know like that's that
[1:21:30] man what the song oh it is so sweet to
[1:21:32] trust in jesus
[1:21:33] you know you worship and pray and pray
[1:21:36] and if you're like oh i'm constrained by
[1:21:38] time i have to stop
[1:21:39] and then as you want to stop another
[1:21:42] inspiration
[1:21:43] comes you pray and pray and pray and
[1:21:46] pray when you are about to stop you do
[1:21:49] what
[1:21:50] you pray and pray and you understand
[1:21:54] if it has never happened to you seek for
[1:21:56] it you will enjoy it i tell you
[1:21:58] you know is when you are entering a
[1:22:01] little bit
[1:22:01] into living living
[1:22:05] time you know i would go outside
[1:22:08] supersonic speed
[1:22:12] leaving time and entering a little bit
[1:22:15] into eternity
[1:22:17] when you reach that you know when this
[1:22:18] man reached there
[1:22:20] hey john and i think peter they said you
[1:22:22] know what let us remain
[1:22:24] here please let us be on three days
[1:22:28] one for you one for your agent and one
[1:22:31] for moses
[1:22:32] and let us dwell here
[1:22:35] when you reach into the presence of god
[1:22:37] don't want to live you don't want to get
[1:22:39] out of it
[1:22:40] the other day all of us slept over why
[1:22:44] what happened did it wasn't planned
[1:22:47] what happened we entered in
[1:22:50] when you enter into the kind of glory
[1:22:52] into the presence of god into the holy
[1:22:54] of holies
[1:22:55] you feel like you are closing with god
[1:22:57] you are chatting with god
[1:22:58] you don't want to leave and now here we
[1:23:01] notice that
[1:23:02] white was not a symbol of age
[1:23:05] but it was a symbol which is a symbol of
[1:23:08] wisdom
[1:23:09] it's a symbol because it's remember it's
[1:23:11] coming as a judge now
[1:23:13] you know the right the judges wear the
[1:23:15] right wig
[1:23:17] what does it show
[1:23:21] it shows wisdom it shows that this is a
[1:23:24] you know even yeah you're gonna be where
[1:23:27] are they yeah
[1:23:28] yes there is a portion
[1:23:31] it says it's just experience maturity
[1:23:35] and wisdom it's just they know what
[1:23:37] they're doing they're not guessing at it
[1:23:39] they know what they're what they are
[1:23:41] doing so that's what it means
[1:23:43] you know and we will get deeper into
[1:23:47] that one man
[1:23:50] on friday okay brother
[1:23:53] okay god bless you all right please can
[1:23:57] you take it up now
[1:24:01] your sound your sound your sound sister
[1:24:04] blessings
[1:24:04] i don't know who is his blessings god
[1:24:06] bless you i see you are here on zoom
[1:24:09] if you put on your video that is nice i
[1:24:12] learned something
[1:24:13] from this vision
[1:24:29] this first you can know
[1:24:33] someone who has gotten distressed
[1:24:36] how can you know this person first of
[1:24:39] all
[1:24:42] specific
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:56] subjects
[1:25:10] a little bit you will portray the nature
[1:25:13] of what people want
[1:25:18] then if you come out of that face you're
[1:25:21] also going to portray
[1:25:22] an age of someone who's interested
[1:25:38] is
[1:25:52] but one was arrested when provoking
[1:25:57] slow you will be strong
[1:26:02] just be you know take things easy
[1:26:07] then you can know that this person is
[1:26:09] understood
[1:26:11] to me that it's something that you need
[1:26:14] to live
[1:26:16] not only for a day or two
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] this is what i learned from this
[1:26:22] scripture
[1:26:23] there are so many things i learned
[1:26:24] because of time
[1:26:27] i can read that why then back up
[1:26:32] by reading it
[1:26:48] pages
[1:27:02] let's see what the bible teaches us
[1:27:04] about this about first
[1:27:06] for he that is entered into his
[1:27:08] restaurant
[1:27:12] he is not only entering in
[1:27:15] but remaining in
[1:27:30] we don't get out yes it's not like
[1:27:34] a day that you would do every into a day
[1:27:37] and saturday suffer now i've got out of
[1:27:40] this down
[1:27:41] in another day now tomorrow will be
[1:27:43] seven when you enter
[1:27:50] of course you know it has to be your sin
[1:27:55] yes you're seen by the holy spirit so
[1:27:58] it's
[1:28:13] i cannot say it's a ceiling i can say it
[1:28:16] is a
[1:28:18] well you may use that i don't know how
[1:28:21] someone will understand
[1:28:22] it but
[1:28:25] well if you're still it means that
[1:28:28] you've been
[1:28:29] you know you've been sheltered from
[1:28:31] other things yes
[1:28:33] so which means you're putting rest at
[1:28:34] that yes you're in there so you're
[1:28:37] sealed
[1:28:38] you are sealed away from some things yes
[1:28:41] so
[1:28:42] i can say that the sabbath is really
[1:28:45] a place you enter in and you are still
[1:28:47] away from the rest of the world
[1:28:49] that's right praise the lord that's
[1:28:52] about powerful revelation
[1:28:53] ages okay
[1:29:05] is completion eight is the first
[1:29:08] day again jesus resurrection was in the
[1:29:12] first day of the week
[1:29:13] giving us his eternal life and eternal
[1:29:16] service
[1:29:18] thus we see why god could not give us
[1:29:21] any one certain day
[1:29:30] which israel would not do having only a
[1:29:34] shadow of the true substance
[1:29:35] which we enjoy why go back to the shadow
[1:29:39] then
[1:29:40] you have reality so
[1:29:43] before you continue because these are
[1:29:44] very important points and these are some
[1:29:46] of the things i wanted to talk about
[1:29:48] also
[1:29:51] so in other words when you enter into
[1:29:53] this sum of rest
[1:29:55] you have entered in and you are sealed
[1:29:58] away from the world right
[1:29:59] you agreed on that now there is
[1:30:02] something that you read there
[1:30:04] can you read that token again
[1:30:08] from here that last bit
[1:30:12] this isn't the last paragraph for page
[1:30:14] four we have
[1:30:16] entered into and do remaining
[1:30:21] which israel could not do having only a
[1:30:24] shadow of the true substance
[1:30:27] in other words israel could not be able
[1:30:30] to enter in and remain in that rest
[1:30:34] because to them the rest was not
[1:30:38] the rest was not what was not
[1:30:41] entering in like we are entering in
[1:30:45] the rest to them was a specific day
[1:30:49] of the week a time
[1:30:53] but for us now he said we do what can
[1:30:56] you read that question again
[1:30:58] says that we have entered into and we
[1:31:00] remain
[1:31:12] having only a shadow of the true
[1:31:14] substance which we enjoy
[1:31:16] you see what they had was not false do
[1:31:19] not say that uh
[1:31:20] what the jews were teaching was wrong no
[1:31:22] it was the commandment of the lord right
[1:31:24] but remember that it was a shackle
[1:31:27] everybody said it was a shadow so that
[1:31:31] was a shadow
[1:31:32] of the good things to come so it was a
[1:31:35] good
[1:31:36] shadow because it pointed to our
[1:31:39] rest which we are going to enter in and
[1:31:42] remain
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:55] is the first day of the week
[1:31:57] today is the summer now tomorrow again
[1:31:59] we go
[1:32:00] you understand yes in and out in and out
[1:32:04] just like there are high priests
[1:32:05] hallelujah
[1:32:07] he will enter into the holy one once a
[1:32:10] year meaning everywhere
[1:32:13] this year you will end the evening
[1:32:22] he entered in once and
[1:32:30] is jesus christ amen why did he
[1:32:34] enter inward and throw into the holy
[1:32:36] bodies because he had now
[1:32:38] brought the real sabbath
[1:32:41] the other was a shadow of the real
[1:32:43] servant but jesus christ brought a
[1:32:45] real sabbath and he said come unto me
[1:32:48] all year that neighbor and
[1:32:49] i have been and i will give you servers
[1:32:54] and what is that rest what is that rest
[1:32:58] what is it being closed out from the
[1:33:00] world
[1:33:01] and being closed in with god and what is
[1:33:04] it
[1:33:05] is receiving the whole dogs you receive
[1:33:08] the holy spirit you are sealed away from
[1:33:10] the world you are corrupted with jesus
[1:33:12] christ
[1:33:12] and you are no longer out there
[1:33:14] struggling with sin and fighting with
[1:33:17] sin those are your words
[1:33:18] you are not crushed in with jesus christ
[1:33:21] and you are receiving you are arrest you
[1:33:22] have received your what
[1:33:24] rest you have received from the world
[1:33:27] that's what the bible says now even when
[1:33:28] you die you cannot die
[1:33:31] if anyone has been in the christ is a
[1:33:33] new creature of course being
[1:33:35] is receiving the holy ghost all the
[1:33:37] things those are the works that you used
[1:33:39] to do
[1:33:39] are passed away behold all things are
[1:33:43] new and uh that's why they put on the
[1:33:47] lord
[1:33:48] jesus christ so now he continues on to
[1:33:50] say here and this is there

[1:57:49] then

[1:58:50] john does not feel that intent to see
[1:58:52] the one whose voice
[1:58:53] he had but but he turns
[1:58:57] to see the voice oh i like that
[1:59:00] he turned to see the voice the voice and
[1:59:02] the person
[1:59:03] are one and the same jesus is the words
[1:59:06] john chapter one one two three
[1:59:10] things and the beginning was the word
[1:59:13] and the word was report and the word
[1:59:27] if you can ever get to really see the
[1:59:30] words
[1:59:31] you will be seeing jesus the judgment is
[1:59:34] on june 10th he saw several golden
[1:59:38] candlesticks
[1:59:39] actually they were lampstands
[1:59:56] the churches
[2:00:22] possess a lasting quality
[2:00:38] and
[2:01:06] thanks
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:35] what this is know
[2:01:38] my words then the answer is
[2:01:42] this is the word of the lord saying
[2:01:46] not by might not by power but my
[2:01:49] students save their notes
[2:01:51] meaning we can't do anything
[2:01:56] here i see we have the long stance
[2:02:00] where the canvas and the candles and the
[2:02:02] lampstands
[2:02:05] okay that's why you got the confusion
[2:02:07] yes okay so
[2:02:09] the issue is we have the candlesticks
[2:02:12] in the book of relation the bible calls
[2:02:15] them
[2:02:21] are you really sure are you really sure
[2:02:28] in the book of revelation the number
[2:02:29] calls them
[2:02:42] okay i did a series on this uh
[2:02:51] okay so um
[2:02:54] look at revelation chapter one
[2:03:00] um
[2:03:05] relation chapter one verses
[2:03:09] i think you can just be twenty
[2:03:15] are you tired no no no okay so
[2:03:18] vasquez says the mystery
[2:03:22] of the seven stars which that service in
[2:03:25] my
[2:03:26] right hand and the seven important
[2:03:28] candlesticks the seven stars
[2:03:31] are the engines of the seventh chart
[2:03:35] and the seven candlesticks which are
[2:03:36] serviced are
[2:03:39] okay so now the candlesticks here is
[2:03:42] what the bible calls it
[2:03:44] but then goes ahead and says well it's
[2:03:46] not really candlesticks
[2:03:49] it's lampstand because the candlesticks
[2:03:51] and lampstands are the same thing really
[2:03:53] okay the same thing in the perspective
[2:03:55] of what it does
[2:03:57] it gives light but it says if you want
[2:03:59] to see a clear picture
[2:04:01] of what this spirit is trying to project
[2:04:03] here
[2:04:04] go to the book of zechariah in zechariah
[2:04:07] that's the way it gives it up
[2:04:09] more clearly and he calls them lamp
[2:04:12] stands
[2:04:14] now those of us were in uganda may not
[2:04:16] know what a lampstand means
[2:04:17] or eats because
[2:04:21] we have not seen that much but in
[2:04:22] ethiopia they know them
[2:04:24] because many of them have been the
[2:04:25] orthodox churches and they use them
[2:04:27] even in catholic churches they use
[2:04:29] landscapes you know
[2:04:31] it is something like this with
[2:04:36] the culture here here's where it stands
[2:04:40] and then it has seven
[2:04:43] uh pipes like pipes
[2:04:47] where within it there is weak there is a
[2:04:51] weeks
[2:04:51] you know weeks and those weeks are the
[2:04:54] ones that stop
[2:04:55] are supposed to be suffering what are
[2:04:58] supposed to be sapping the oil
[2:05:00] so that the fire can be leaked on top of
[2:05:03] it
[2:05:03] so it is really supposed to be holding
[2:05:06] a light it is supposed to be meant
[2:05:10] to hold light but in there this last
[2:05:13] stand
[2:05:14] was in the right hand of him
[2:05:17] jesus christ the son of man then
[2:05:21] there was also what there was also
[2:05:24] stars now these stars
[2:05:28] are the seven angels the bible says
[2:05:30] messengers
[2:05:33] which means each star was going to each
[2:05:35] cut with
[2:05:36] to each lamp stand these seven lap
[2:05:39] stands
[2:05:40] made seven church churches they gentle
[2:05:43] seven charges of the same church of
[2:05:45] jesus christ okay yes
[2:05:47] quickly give me zachariah chapter four
[2:05:49] verse one to six seconds be able to
[2:05:51] identify this with you
[2:05:52] and be able to give you a clear picture
[2:05:54] to try to identify with their
[2:05:56] uh revelation zechariah four one to six
[2:06:00] uh here he says and the angel
[2:06:04] sorry
[2:06:07] is it no an angel that talked with me

[2:10:56] power not about my but by my
[2:10:58] spirit now the temple of the lord today
[2:11:01] is not the temple of solomon
[2:11:03] but it's it is you just said it's me
[2:11:08] you want a temple now you want the
[2:11:10] temple of what
[2:11:11] of the lord now let us go back here you
[2:11:14] saw this vision
[2:11:16] seven lap stands seven lamps on it then
[2:11:19] the two only trees that are bowed on top
[2:11:20] of it and then
[2:11:22] oh hallelujah
[2:11:32] it means god himself all right so we see
[2:11:35] one only three on the left another only
[2:11:38] three on the right
[2:11:39] one other three on the left symbolizing
[2:11:41] the old testament
[2:11:42] symbolizing the wrath of god that he has
[2:11:44] given through the prophets
[2:11:46] the bible says we are building the
[2:11:47] foundation of who the apostles are
[2:11:50] and the prophets the old testament
[2:11:53] prophets the ultimate messengers the old
[2:11:55] testament and then the new testament
[2:11:58] right
[2:11:58] so this is the jesus christ oh
[2:12:02] my my my man you look at this jesus
[2:12:05] christ
[2:12:07] is the one that the prophet spoke about
[2:12:10] the bible says so
[2:12:11] whatever prophets of the old testament
[2:12:14] ezekiel daniel
[2:12:16] mentioned them all of them off
[2:12:19] the bible says this is of whom all the
[2:12:22] prophets
[2:12:22] they speak about now
[2:12:26] the old testament is christ that's why
[2:12:28] brother bottom said if you read
[2:12:30] any fact in the bible you don't see
[2:12:32] jesus christ read again
[2:12:34] all right the only three the whole
[2:12:36] summit is the old tree uh
[2:12:38] sorry it's the only tree on the left the
[2:12:40] new testament is the only tree on the
[2:12:42] right
[2:12:42] on the right it is all the same thing it
[2:12:45] brings
[2:12:46] out the same trail remember all
[2:12:49] in the camera or the olive tree is meant
[2:12:52] to use to do what
[2:12:54] to light fire to bring forth light
[2:12:57] so when when he was bringing forth the
[2:12:59] prophets of the orchestra man
[2:13:01] he in other words they were coming to
[2:13:02] say bring forth life
[2:13:04] the preaching of our giving was a
[2:13:07] horrible speech
[2:13:08] it was my inspiration it was the fire
[2:13:10] and the power of god
[2:13:12] that attached them to bring forth that
[2:13:14] one the leaders comment apostles
[2:13:16] something is the same honor as fire
[2:13:19] it's the holy ghost and what and fire is
[2:13:22] the same word
[2:13:24] now when this word comes it doesn't come
[2:13:28] directly
[2:13:29] to what it doesn't come directly well
[2:13:34] come on now it hasn't come from the
[2:13:37] orange tree
[2:13:38] to the candlestick does it it doesn't
[2:13:41] why god is a god of honor he says true
[2:13:45] and the one god will do nothing but your
[2:13:46] word
[2:13:47] he will reveal his secrets to his
[2:13:49] servants
[2:13:51] he will do nothing the light will not
[2:13:54] shine
[2:13:56] what this candlestick needs in order to
[2:13:59] shine
[2:13:59] this light is the oil
[2:14:03] and when if there is no oil it means it
[2:14:06] will not work
[2:14:07] shine so it needs to receive the oil but
[2:14:11] the oil is not coming direct from the
[2:14:13] olive trees
[2:14:14] to the candlestick the oil is coming
[2:14:17] directly from the olive tree tower
[2:14:20] to where now to the power
[2:14:24] the bowel here i would say that it
[2:14:26] symbolizes
[2:14:28] it it symbolizes the uh
[2:14:31] the the the the the uh the spirit of god
[2:14:35] through the messengers as you would say
[2:14:39] and in every generation
[2:14:43] to to be able to bring forth the world
[2:14:45] of life
[2:14:46] today churches to their church ages
[2:14:51] the one comes from god comes on down to
[2:14:54] a prophet
[2:14:55] from the prophet is delivered to the
[2:14:56] church it has been so in the first
[2:14:59] chapter
[2:14:59] second chapter third fourth fifth until
[2:15:02] the
[2:15:03] seventh now when this one
[2:15:06] comes down the oil
[2:15:09] comes down from the bowel
[2:15:13] to where repetition comes to where
[2:15:16] from where the prophet from god
[2:15:19] to the prophet from regression 21
[2:15:23] to regression 10 7
[2:15:26] to revelation 10 8
[2:15:29] to 11. what does the russian chain one
[2:15:32] say
[2:15:34] i
[2:15:44] come on now revelation 21 says what
[2:15:52] raise up your hands can you bring the
[2:15:55] bibles
[2:15:55] gifts i have for them give them the
[2:15:57] bibles i don't want to see anybody with
[2:15:59] a phone
[2:16:02] where is your bible where
[2:16:07] oh now we are going to take it from you
[2:16:08] and give it to another one
[2:16:10] okay so can you give those
[2:16:14] the bibles the purpose of this bible
[2:16:17] whenever we come here we have the bibles
[2:16:19] and we can be able to study
[2:16:21] with our bibles not with your forms so i
[2:16:24] can't understand if someone says they
[2:16:26] receive the bible and then i
[2:16:27] left that home it's quite not
[2:16:30] understandable
[2:16:41] and his face was as it was a sun and his
[2:16:45] feet
[2:16:46] as fillers of fire so this is the one
[2:16:48] that we read about already
[2:16:50] okay and we have been able to see who is
[2:16:52] he
[2:16:54] jesus it is jesus christ so say it
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:12] of revelation 21 why is it jesus christ
[2:17:18] did you read about it
[2:17:22] so you've not finished the batman's
[2:17:23] vision
[2:17:25] so you never saw it but that's what
[2:17:28] we'll be talking about here
[2:17:30] the seventh glory of this of his passion
[2:17:34] okay look
[2:17:38] revelation 21 it is who jesus christ who
[2:17:42] is regression 27
[2:17:45] what does it say but in the days of the
[2:17:49] voice of the seventh
[2:17:50] angel when he shall begin the mystery of
[2:17:53] god should be finished as he
[2:18:08] go up here
[2:18:26] oh no okay now i hope everybody's there
[2:18:28] okay one two three start
[2:18:34] when you shall begin the
[2:19:21] [Applause]
[2:19:26] [Music]
[2:19:27] okay so what does it say there
[2:19:31] yes verse 8.
[2:19:44] so who opened
[2:19:48] 5 the lamb yes now the lamb
[2:19:51] it comes here in the form of an angel a
[2:19:54] mighty angel
[2:19:54] who is the same jesus christ and after
[2:19:58] he brings down this open book he came
[2:19:59] with a little book open
[2:20:21] now the seventh angel sounding is the
[2:20:23] prophetic ministry on art of a man and
[2:20:26] we know
[2:20:26] that is barabana in our generation then
[2:20:29] now after a prophet
[2:20:30] comes with that message what happens
[2:20:34] we just begin right now watching the
[2:20:36] prophet
[2:20:37] no hallelujah the prophet goes out on
[2:20:40] the scene
[2:20:41] you know hallelujah
[2:20:57] so the oil comes from there all
[2:20:59] increased so let's say that
[2:21:00] the oil comes from revelation 10 1 the
[2:21:03] open
[2:21:04] mood all right the revelation of jesus
[2:21:06] christ it comes
[2:21:08] from revelation 10 1 then on
[2:21:25] it goes to right there it's a pretty
[2:21:28] picture it goes where do that to the
[2:21:31] candlesticks or whatever
[2:21:32] the lampstand what the lampstand the
[2:21:35] lampstand is the church
[2:21:36] is the bride god bless you hallelujah so
[2:21:39] the oil comes from the olive trees goes
[2:21:41] to the power
[2:21:42] and on them there's a lot of stuff so
[2:21:44] the oil comes from revelation to anyone
[2:21:46] who's jesus christ one down to the
[2:21:48] prophet that's the
[2:21:49] the the seventh angel's messenger on
[2:21:52] down to the bride
[2:22:04] he said that the things i do you shall
[2:22:06] do also
[2:22:08] the seven power of the holy tree amen
[2:22:10] the centre of jesus christ with the
[2:22:12] center of the prophet is the
[2:22:14] center of the bride the seven of those
[2:22:17] that they fade on
[2:22:18] they sell history they receive is the
[2:22:20] same that we must receive today
[2:22:23] you see now and also there's another
[2:22:25] thing that you are about to see here
[2:22:26] there how many candlesticks so the same
[2:22:30] one
[2:22:31] hallelujah that was in the first church
[2:22:33] age
[2:22:34] will be in the second
[2:22:39] [Applause]
[2:22:51] you see jesus christ is the same
[2:22:53] yesterday today
[2:22:55] and forever so you see the seven holy
[2:22:57] spirit the same teachings that paul
[2:22:59] taught in the beginning
[2:23:00] is the same teachings we must teach
[2:23:02] today because
[2:23:03] [Applause]
[2:23:16] i think now you see it clearly you see
[2:23:19] that same holy ghost

[2:26:12] [Music]
[2:26:18] we have today oh my so you can see why
[2:26:22] why john had to go to patmos because he
[2:26:24] had to see this revelation the same
[2:26:26] revelations that zechariah saw
[2:26:28] the same references that daniel saw you
[2:26:30] know god
[2:26:31] always even showing himself through his
[2:26:34] prophets
[2:26:35] praise the name of the lord and then
[2:26:38] have two more sisters and then i think i
[2:26:39] will speak a few things with rose
[2:26:41] all right sister rachel god bless
[2:26:47] [Music]
[2:27:00] if
[2:27:10] [Music]
[2:27:14] i come here

[2:27:24] someone might wonder what you mean if
[2:27:26] you are this kind
[2:27:28] i keep
[2:27:32] okay which one did you read that from
[2:28:10] yes
[2:28:38] you
[2:28:46] so in other words you know we are all
[2:28:49] mixed up
[2:28:50] it doesn't matter we go back to you who
[2:28:52] is your mother who is your father we are
[2:28:53] all mixed up
[2:28:54] you cannot say this is the seed of god
[2:28:57] but the only
[2:28:58] thing that will show you who you are is
[2:29:00] the voice that you're following
[2:29:01] and if it's the voice of god then indeed
[2:29:04] you're
[2:29:05] gonna do it you'll recognize
[2:29:16] [Music]
[2:29:20] yes
[2:29:31] it was not feeling like it's right like
[2:29:34] it just has to
[2:29:34] scratch then push the turn when the mom
[2:29:39] came and said that you can't
[2:29:48] fly
[2:29:51] [Music]
[2:30:08] [Music]

[2:30:20] to the hand and the chicken and all the
[2:30:22] small ones that's danger that's what
[2:30:25] so when you are in your denomination or
[2:30:28] when you are among some people and then

[2:30:31] ruin your life today it is danger
[2:30:34] but when you hear the sound you hear a

[2:32:38] scratch from the ground yes
[2:32:40] do you know the four living creatures
[2:32:44] what's the fascinating creature
[2:32:47] the first the first one lying
[2:32:51] that's what god said in the first
[2:32:52] generations right what was it
[2:32:54] symbolizing
[2:32:58] not only brethren but also not but also
[2:33:01] that they were
[2:33:03] purity right they are true to themselves
[2:33:06] i mean evil is always true to itself
[2:33:08] i mean i mean a liar okay number one
[2:33:12] then the second living question yes
[2:33:19] okay oh okay let me bring a picture also
[2:33:22] here about the
[2:33:23] four living creatures
[2:33:28] that's not the second one
[2:33:44] okay let me get it for you here our
[2:33:46] project is for you as well
[2:33:49] okay i'm not getting a good picture but
[2:33:51] i just predict the one i'm saying here

[2:34:00] anyhow
[2:34:05] okay just give me a second i'll have it
[2:34:08] it's not a perfect one i would have
[2:34:10] wanted to project
[2:34:12] but it will do enough
[2:34:16] okay so
[2:34:23] i'm just getting before myself here
[2:34:27] okay do you see that yes
[2:34:31] they are not in order no problem the
[2:34:34] first
[2:34:35] the the first living creature to come
[2:34:41] was what a liar
[2:34:45] the second living creature to come was
[2:34:49] was
[2:34:50] [Music]
[2:34:53] and i'll show you to you later on how
[2:34:55] they came through generations
[2:34:58] the third living creature to come was
[2:35:02] what face of a man
[2:35:06] face of a man hallelujah and the last
[2:35:09] living creature to come was
[2:35:16] praise the name of the lord let me get a
[2:35:19] better picture here
[2:35:20] that i would that would depict the exact
[2:35:24] thing that i'm talking about
[2:35:26] i woke up i'm able to get it very fast
[2:35:28] for you
[2:35:30] so you can be blessed by it
[2:35:33] okay just give me a second here
[2:35:38] all right
[2:35:42] praise the lord
[2:35:48] okay just give me a moment
[2:35:51] i'll get it for you i don't know if you
[2:35:55] if i get a good resolution here i cannot
[2:35:57] find on my laptop
[2:35:59] but i'm going to try and get you
[2:36:04] the proper picture of
[2:36:07] okay this the one i'm looking for
[2:36:11] okay
[2:36:18] there you go
[2:36:28] okay that's the mess again
[2:36:48] okay
[2:36:55] can everybody see that
[2:37:07] do you see that now okay so
[2:37:11] uh i'll try to make this a bit
[2:37:14] bigger for you to be able to clear
[2:37:20] do you see the the line yes
[2:37:23] the lion came in that was the first
[2:37:26] living picture to come out
[2:37:27] revelation 4 7 and
[2:37:31] the lion was the anointing by all these
[2:37:35] four living creatures are the anointings
[2:37:37] of god
[2:37:37] that he powers out to human beings that
[2:37:40] are holding onto his word
[2:37:42] in the different generations over time
[2:37:45] so when we see the first church
[2:37:46] ephedras what powers out the first
[2:37:48] anointing which is the
[2:37:50] lion and this time they it symbolizes
[2:37:53] stands for purity
[2:37:54] and the power of the manifestation of
[2:37:56] the word of god at that time
[2:37:57] and god used saint paul as the messenger
[2:38:01] of that generation okay so you can see
[2:38:03] that very clearly now
[2:38:05] ephesians then comes mana pekomos and
[2:38:08] these three ages are the eight
[2:38:10] generations that were really
[2:38:12] uh which were persecuted because of
[2:38:15] their faith
[2:38:16] the faith they believed in and god gave
[2:38:19] them the anointing
[2:38:20] of a flying uh rather of a cow for the
[2:38:24] orcs
[2:38:25] now also represents the anointing spirit
[2:38:26] to sacrifice
[2:38:28] and to accept death you know rather than
[2:38:30] to accept doctrines of men they
[2:38:32] refuse to accept false doctrines and we
[2:38:35] you know
[2:38:36] remember that whenever
[2:38:39] the spirit of god comes down whenever
[2:38:41] the spirit of the devil
[2:38:43] comes in like a flood the spirit of
[2:38:45] jesus christ raises a lot
[2:38:47] a standard we see also the devil comes
[2:38:49] in with the
[2:38:50] anointings of the horse riders okay so
[2:38:54] the first horse rider
[2:38:55] was a white horse rider that was a
[2:38:57] deceiver coming into the first church
[2:38:59] aid to receive
[2:39:00] some denominations i feel like the sda
[2:39:02] speech that uh this was the jesus christ
[2:39:04] coming in
[2:39:05] you know kind of to conquer the world
[2:39:08] with righteousness but no
[2:39:09] because it is the white horse does not
[2:39:11] mean it is righteousness this is a
[2:39:12] deceiver because
[2:39:13] the prophet said he has a bow but he has
[2:39:15] no arrow so that's the devil the
[2:39:17] deceiver all right
[2:39:19] and uh then comes in the devil comes
[2:39:22] again of course when the devil came in
[2:39:23] as a deceiver you know
[2:39:25] through a white horse that the spirit of
[2:39:26] lord came upon the believers
[2:39:29] the devil came to deceive them the
[2:39:31] spirit of the campaign
[2:39:32] with the anointing of an ego uh we are
[2:39:35] not a meeting of a lion brother
[2:39:36] i'm
[2:39:44] [Applause]
[2:39:57] symbolize persecution you know the red
[2:40:00] horse rider
[2:40:01] has given the was given power to take
[2:40:03] peace from the earth
[2:40:05] he came in to kill he came in to destroy
[2:40:08] he came into possession
[2:40:09] we understand yes but the spirit of the
[2:40:12] lord through all these three churches
[2:40:16] amen he god began the believers they
[2:40:34] upon the believers of that generation do
[2:40:36] you know what the spirit of adults is
[2:40:37] yes to accept sacrifice
[2:40:41] rather than accepting we will not die
[2:40:46] we will stand for the truth regardless
[2:40:48] of what you do to us
[2:40:49] they gave themselves they would reap a
[2:40:50] woman is stomach and an adam gives a
[2:40:52] heart stomach wants to be ripped
[2:40:55] they will kill they will cut up their
[2:40:57] necks as if they are cutting off the
[2:40:59] necks of
[2:40:59] pigs they will kill them
[2:41:03] they will destroy them and persecute
[2:41:05] them but the more
[2:41:06] oh hallelujah the more they persecuted
[2:41:10] the church the more they are willing to
[2:41:11] give themselves to be persecuted
[2:41:13] can you imagine these people were as if
[2:41:15] they were bewitched
[2:41:17] but i'm glad they were wished by the
[2:41:18] power of the holy ghost hallelujah
[2:41:21] for the sake of the gospel you know when
[2:41:24] you are under the power of the holy
[2:41:25] ghost you are as if you are
[2:41:27] under a spell you don't care what nobody
[2:41:29] does to you
[2:41:30] you don't care what nobody does to you i
[2:41:32] preach this message i'm ready to die for
[2:41:34] it i tell you
[2:41:35] did you hear what i say i am ready and
[2:41:37] i'm not saying it because i don't
[2:41:39] believe it
[2:41:39] i believe i am ready to be imprisoned
[2:41:41] for it whatever they want to do they
[2:41:43] can't take it out of me
[2:41:45] the the faith i have they never never
[2:41:47] gave it to me so they never can't do one
[2:41:49] take it away so they they never could
[2:41:52] not take it away
[2:41:53] he persecuted them the more he
[2:41:54] persecuted the more they believed that
[2:41:56] was the second energy that got power
[2:41:58] down
[2:41:58] they never said oh okay you can also
[2:42:00] accept to die no problem no problem if
[2:42:02] you can accept that i will come again in
[2:42:04] another way
[2:42:05] the devil came in writing a black horse
[2:42:08] a black horse which imagines what
[2:42:10] framing
[2:42:12] fading of what not something of food and
[2:42:14] water the bible says saying it off
[2:42:16] the word of god so how in those
[2:42:19] generations during the days of martin
[2:42:21] luther
[2:42:21] with the wizarding 15 20 to around 1906
[2:42:25] you know the devil was taken out you
[2:42:27] know that the people were refused to
[2:42:29] read the bibles
[2:42:30] they don't like to refuse people to ask
[2:42:32] to read their bibles
[2:42:34] not reading the bible it is only for the
[2:42:36] priest if you read it
[2:42:37] your whole entire house will be filled
[2:42:39] with blood and many things like that
[2:42:43] if you are found reading the bible
[2:42:44] interpreting the bible or translating it
[2:42:45] in another language you'll be killed
[2:42:48] the man who translated this bible into
[2:42:50] into the
[2:42:51] common man's language which at that time
[2:42:53] was english was burnt on the stake
[2:42:56] his name is william kinder and many
[2:42:58] others were
[2:43:00] were killed john wickliffe and many
[2:43:02] others i tell you this gospel is
[2:43:04] dripping with black that's why we see
[2:43:06] that that song
[2:43:08] is dripping with blood oh yes it is
[2:43:09] bleeping with blood the blood of the
[2:43:11] people who died for the truth
[2:43:13] what about you who just has to walk a
[2:43:14] little bit and you know what's
[2:43:16] going on and just overcome a few
[2:43:18] temptations really really
[2:43:19] should you play around with this gospel
[2:43:22] never believe this gospel if you're
[2:43:23] going to play with it
[2:43:25] believe it if you're ready to stand for
[2:43:26] it
[2:43:28] the devil came in to do that to bring
[2:43:31] confusion and bring
[2:43:32] feminine feminine nowhere no people you
[2:43:35] know
[2:43:36] this man would translate the bible send
[2:43:38] it to people
[2:43:39] and the catholic church would buy those
[2:43:41] bibles
[2:43:42] after they buy them they would take them
[2:43:44] and abandon them
[2:43:46] it is said that the catholic church was
[2:43:47] the biggest customer of william jr
[2:43:50] but they would buy to burn but
[2:43:54] it is saying that young children would
[2:43:55] take that same money which they have
[2:43:57] paid him to to to buy those bibles to
[2:44:00] produce more bibles
[2:44:02] hallelujah
[2:44:08] and notice that same god gave another
[2:44:12] anointing to overcome that he said ah
[2:44:14] you are going to overcome many people
[2:44:16] with they
[2:44:17] bring them the family no no problem i
[2:44:19] will also use the face of man
[2:44:21] i will use man this space of mine
[2:44:24] represents the anointing
[2:44:25] amen and the american spirit who is
[2:44:28] smart
[2:44:28] cunning to defend the word of god right
[2:44:31] william jenner was one of them
[2:44:33] there was jerusalem all right there was
[2:44:36] a
[2:44:36] a martin luther there was this many were
[2:44:39] intelligent
[2:44:40] they could reason with bishops and one
[2:44:42] of them was a priest actually
[2:44:47] why because they were anointed by god to
[2:44:50] do those things
[2:44:51] do you know why william kinder it is
[2:44:53] said that he knew how malaria it is
[2:44:55] german
[2:44:56] english even italian target and many
[2:44:59] other languages
[2:45:00] how can one man know all those languages
[2:45:02] it was the indirect that god had given
[2:45:04] them
[2:45:05] where is the law now the devil said hey
[2:45:09] you can be able to be smart and coming
[2:45:11] no problem i will
[2:45:41] they are attacking us all together
[2:45:42] correctly so it means that
[2:45:44] whatever spirit of god is going to give
[2:45:46] us must be a higher spirit
[2:45:48] a higher anointing and of course this
[2:45:52] anointing of this uh uh
[2:45:56] perhaps right there of course the devil
[2:45:58] is going to use
[2:45:59] all avenues all up your spirituality
[2:46:03] he's going to use the religions he's
[2:46:04] going to use the economy he's going to
[2:46:06] use that
[2:46:07] or you know the three things that they
[2:46:09] never used in the
[2:46:10] name of jesus he used the religious
[2:46:12] leaders the
[2:46:13] political influence and use the economy
[2:46:16] to persecute the one
[2:46:17] the church to persecute jesus to do the
[2:46:20] same thing today
[2:46:22] but you see one thing that god is going
[2:46:24] to do for us
[2:46:25] the devil we know he's going to try and
[2:46:27] want to control the world
[2:46:29] completely with the economy with it
[2:46:32] right now look we are on lock or down
[2:46:35] they say you can't do this you can't buy
[2:46:36] you can't do
[2:46:50] god
[2:46:57] he has given us the anointing of the
[2:46:58] flying evil evil
[2:47:06] the ego represents the highest anointing
[2:47:09] the spirit
[2:47:10] that we have received is the anointing
[2:47:12] is the highest revelation
[2:47:13] from god and brought out what does it
[2:47:15] bring out
[2:47:16] back to the faith
[2:47:21] which god uses during the church ages
[2:47:23] amen
[2:47:24] in our time in our generation wealth is
[2:47:26] using that
[2:47:27] even all through but we know we see
[2:47:29] today in our time right now
[2:47:30] he's using that of the flying
[2:47:47] uses even the politicians that use it
[2:47:49] but look
[2:47:51] because when you see in the scripture it
[2:47:53] belongs to us
[2:47:54] when you say in the scripture it is the
[2:47:56] last anointing that god
[2:48:00] says
[2:48:02] the anointing of the ego
[2:48:08] praise the name of the lord amen
[2:48:12] amen i thought i should share that
[2:48:14] sister
[2:48:15] god bless you so much for that amen
[2:48:17] praise the lord
[2:48:18] hallelujah
[2:48:22] before we finish up sister peace and
[2:48:24] brother isaac those two are
[2:48:27] contributed and then we shall close it
[2:48:37] [Music]
[2:48:57] the bible okay it says in acts 2
[2:49:01] chapter 2 repent and be baptized
[2:49:04] every one of you in the name of jesus
[2:49:07] christ
[2:49:07] for the remission of sins you shall
[2:49:10] receive
[2:49:11] the gift of the holy spirit and just
[2:49:14] pass
[2:49:15] right on they shouldn't see it
[2:49:18] they don't see it if they certainly by
[2:49:21] getting
[2:49:22] the spirit they know that
[2:49:38] is
[2:49:52] regulations is
[2:50:20] amen can someone be baptized except they
[2:50:23] are prevented
[2:50:25] all right so uh here i want to ask a
[2:50:28] question
[2:50:30] is there someone here you know this or
[2:50:33] some people here
[2:50:34] that have been my place before the
[2:50:35] painting
[2:50:39] [Music]
[2:50:41] yes i don't want you to say no when
[2:50:44] you're singing for somebody i'll send
[2:50:45] them for you
[2:50:46] no okay all right you want to ask me
[2:51:01] then that means you are not baptized
[2:51:03] because if
[2:51:04] you have been baptized but you never
[2:51:06] believe fast is that baptism
[2:51:09] just like if i find a person there on
[2:51:11] the road and i'm like oh my friend come
[2:51:12] on
[2:51:13] let's go for what for baptism
[2:51:16] he says baptism i said yes and then he
[2:51:18] said what did you get for you
[2:51:20] praise me you will go to heaven okay
[2:51:21] let's go is that the opposite
[2:51:24] no you need to believe fast
[2:51:28] you need the mother did not say how old
[2:51:31] you should be no
[2:51:32] that's not the problem the problem is
[2:51:34] you must believe
[2:51:35] fast now can you believe unless you are
[2:51:38] what
[2:51:39] you have to hear who is who is speaking
[2:51:42] there
[2:51:44] you have to hear the gospel you have to
[2:51:46] believe the gospel
[2:51:48] then you confess it with your mouth then
[2:51:50] after that
[2:51:51] you get baptized in water and as the
[2:51:54] sisters say
[2:51:55] you should repent and you are pleasing
[2:51:56] the name of our lord jesus in the name
[2:51:57] of jesus christ for the remission of
[2:51:59] sins and ye shall receive a gift of
[2:52:00] there
[2:52:02] and just pass right some people just
[2:52:03] read and they pass or write on
[2:52:05] they don't say if they saw it by getting
[2:52:08] in the spirit
[2:52:10] they would know that if they want to
[2:52:11] receive the other girls
[2:52:13] they need to repent and be baptized in
[2:52:15] the name of their
[2:52:16] lord jesus and then what
[2:52:19] what will happen read with me god would
[2:52:22] be
[2:52:22] duty-bound to fulfill his wife by what
[2:52:33] so if you have believed and now you will
[2:52:36] not be baptized
[2:52:39] it's a very good opportunity for you
[2:52:41] right now right amen so how many
[2:52:43] have believed and i've never believed
[2:52:46] them before
[2:52:47] but right now they say now from what
[2:52:49] i've had really really in these meetings
[2:52:51] i have believed this message and now i
[2:52:53] want to give up your
[2:53:08] hallelujah
[2:53:23] uh uh somewhere here we have uh uh
[2:53:26] oh right there it's unfortunate oh stop
[2:53:28] oh god bless you
[2:53:29] then uh where else is there i don't see
[2:53:32] it oh
[2:53:33] situation is right there my my my mind
[2:53:36] and uh
[2:53:50] now
[2:54:04] why are you raising up your hand you
[2:54:07] want to be baptized
[2:54:08] yes why give me two reasons why you want
[2:54:10] to be baptized
[2:54:14] sorry because this told you
[2:54:27] how did they tell you
[2:54:32] oh
[2:54:38] did he tell you why okay now ask him
[2:54:42] why the day you know why you want to do
[2:54:44] that
[2:54:45] then we shall go baptizing so we have
[2:54:48] four
[2:54:48] is it for people four people one you got
[2:54:50] five
[2:54:51] i tell you four or five that's a
[2:54:54] wonderful thing
[2:54:56] amen we need to talk to the lord
[2:55:08] amen now uh can we have the last person
[2:55:12] to speak
[2:55:12] you all right can you put a camera right
[2:55:14] here so that he can also tell us what he
[2:55:17] learned and
[2:55:17] something that he'd like others to be
[2:55:20] blessed with
[2:55:24] most obviously they've shared it but
[2:55:26] also they shot most of the videos around
[2:55:28] so
[2:55:42] um
[2:55:44] [Music]
[2:56:18] [Music]
[2:56:24] um
[2:56:30] [Music]
[2:56:36] you see i think we have also discussed
[2:56:39] something like that which one are you
[2:56:40] reading
[2:56:45] [Music]
[2:56:52] um
[2:56:56] [Music]
[2:57:19] you will do better than both
[2:57:34] that you are going to do what god what
[2:57:36] jesus never did
[2:57:38] yes but he rather means you're going to
[2:57:40] do
[2:57:41] the things he did but in a multiplied
[2:57:44] way
[2:57:45] you're going to do more of it amen
[2:57:48] and so we see that uh actually how many
[2:57:51] did you just read from the day
[2:57:55] how many how many headed by the banana
[2:57:58] range from the day
[2:58:00] how many six my good lord how many
[2:58:04] five five people
[2:58:07] by the bottom of the day so you can see
[2:58:09] that in our generation you have had even
[2:58:11] a man raised more
[2:58:12] at a time so but that is not meant to
[2:58:15] say that is greater than jesus it was
[2:58:17] the promise of jesus
[2:58:19] more than one of them would work for
[2:58:20] faith hallelujah
[2:58:22] denominations which a man died cannot be
[2:58:24] born of god
[2:58:25] for it is the spirit not man that gives
[2:58:28] life
[2:58:29] and so we see that this word which we
[2:58:31] receive
[2:58:32] you can't fake it and like he said if
[2:58:35] you fake it surely you will manifest
[2:58:37] what you ask
[2:58:38] like uh when rain when the holocaust
[2:58:40] comes down
[2:58:41] and uh uh
[2:58:56] if it comes
[2:59:13] you know and kind of stick on you you
[2:59:16] know
[2:59:16] but those are weeds but when it when the
[2:59:20] rain comes down it feeds both the cocoa
[2:59:22] bars and
[2:59:22] also they look like
[2:59:26] the maize and the other syrians you
[2:59:28] understand
[2:59:29] so that the rain will not say ah i will
[2:59:31] only go to the maze
[2:59:33] also the coconuts same way but
[2:59:37] here is already what happens
[2:59:40] in the end everything we bring for the
[2:59:43] beads
[2:59:46] so whatever you have keep under the
[2:59:49] reign of the horrible skip under the
[2:59:51] world keep out of there
[2:59:53] the world is going to bring out who you
[2:59:54] are
[2:59:56] if you're a son of god then why will
[2:59:58] bring forth the best out of you
[3:00:00] amen you will grow and be nurtured
[3:00:04] in the knowledge of jesus christ and the
[3:00:07] power of his mind
[3:00:12] did you receive your bible and if indeed
[3:00:14] he received your bible were you blessed
[3:00:16] by it
[3:00:17] all right after that then do you have
[3:00:19] you been reading have you finished the
[3:00:20] practice vision can you unmute yourself
[3:00:23] so you can be able to speak to us we
[3:00:25] want to know what is it that you have
[3:00:26] read
[3:00:27] and uh we want to know uh how blessed
[3:00:31] it has been for you all right over to
[3:00:34] you
[3:00:34] uh sister jovanita
[3:00:50] god bless you all i received my bible
[3:00:53] and i'm very happy
[3:00:55] thank you pastor
[3:00:58] thank you all but i
[3:01:04] i finished doing the second chapter
[3:01:07] i i finished yesterday
[3:01:14] i mean now what part within the second
[3:01:17] chapter the fat most vision it really
[3:01:19] touched you and you would like
[3:01:20] you'd like to share with us
[3:01:27] yes pasta
[3:01:31] okay my question is what part did you
[3:01:35] read
[3:01:35] in the patmos vision that really touched
[3:01:37] you and you thought you should share it
[3:01:40] with us just like we have been doing
[3:01:41] here
[3:01:44] but it is on the questions
[3:02:13] it is on page 47
[3:02:17] you say that
[3:02:20] the whole
[3:02:22] [Music]
[3:02:24] took charge of their lives they entered
[3:02:27] interest there is your arrest
[3:02:30] that is your sabbath it is not a death
[3:02:33] naraya
[3:02:34] but the eternity of being filled and
[3:02:36] blessed in the holy
[3:02:37] spirit it is seizing and god doing
[3:02:41] and god doing it is good in you willing
[3:02:44] and doing
[3:02:45] of his good pleasure for me on my side i
[3:02:48] was thinking that
[3:02:49] saturday was the sabbath and it is that
[3:02:53] the one god rested
[3:02:55] but when i read i i got to know that
[3:03:00] every that sunday and saturday
[3:03:03] all these days we can pray there's no
[3:03:07] any day that
[3:03:09] all those days asked
[3:03:14] but sunday and saturday
[3:03:18] that's all i can even i don't want to be
[3:03:20] baptized but for me on my side
[3:03:22] i am already baptized that
[3:03:26] soul
[3:03:35] god bless you so much for that yeah we
[3:03:37] are good place
[3:03:38] yes you say and i want to also
[3:03:41] re-emphasize on the on this point of the
[3:03:43] summer
[3:03:44] like we would rather share it if you
[3:03:46] missed that part you can find on youtube
[3:03:48] but like what i was sharing with the
[3:03:50] believers
[3:03:52] this matters well and we really were did
[3:03:54] have a good time on it
[3:03:56] now we also found out from this variable
[3:03:59] you see
[3:04:00] that saturday
[3:04:03] sunday neither of these is our sabbath
[3:04:10] our sabbath is the holy ghost
[3:04:13] is the holy spirit where you enter in
[3:04:17] and you are sealed away from all your
[3:04:20] works
[3:04:22] we also read in the book of galatians
[3:04:24] chapter 5
[3:04:25] and we found out what our works are our
[3:04:28] works is not our day-to-day
[3:04:29] life our day-to-day things we do our
[3:04:32] work is the works of the flesh
[3:04:34] the scenes that so easily beset us those
[3:04:37] things
[3:04:38] is our work so we have to lay it aside
[3:04:41] and we enter into our rest which is
[3:04:44] christ the holy spirit
[3:04:46] then also the other thing we found out
[3:04:48] was that in the old testament they had a
[3:04:51] physical day which was saturday which
[3:04:53] was their summer
[3:04:54] but this was only a shovel a good shadow
[3:04:58] of the real sabbath which was to come by
[3:05:00] jesus christ
[3:05:01] now in the old testament they had their
[3:05:04] sabbath they had their
[3:05:06] their high priest who would enter into
[3:05:09] the earlier one is
[3:05:10] every year one time every year one time
[3:05:13] he kept on going into the holy bodies
[3:05:15] but with us we received our high priest
[3:05:18] which is jesus christ and he entered
[3:05:20] into the holy ghost
[3:05:22] one time one time everybody said one
[3:05:24] time
[3:05:25] one time he entered into the holy of
[3:05:27] holies one time
[3:05:28] and the moment he did that what happened
[3:05:31] with us
[3:05:32] we received the rest hallelujah also
[3:05:35] one time when he said rest how many
[3:05:37] times one time
[3:05:38] and so today we have rested from our
[3:05:42] rats the moment you are baptized you'll
[3:05:45] never follow up jesus christ
[3:05:46] you receive the forgiveness of sins you
[3:05:49] receive the holy cross
[3:05:50] when you receive all the ghosts you have
[3:05:52] entered your sabbath
[3:05:54] you can now say you are in the lord is
[3:05:56] that
[3:05:57] when the lord is you are in the spirit
[3:06:00] you are right
[3:06:02] god bless you so much everybody we've
[3:06:04] had a wonderful and productive
[3:06:05] day we have had five souls that are
[3:06:07] ready for baptism
