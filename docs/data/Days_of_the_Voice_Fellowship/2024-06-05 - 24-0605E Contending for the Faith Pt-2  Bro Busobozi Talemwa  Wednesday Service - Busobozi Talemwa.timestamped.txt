[38:03] Jude now we did uh read this on
[38:08] Sunday we did we read it on
[38:12] Sunday but um we are going to read
[38:17] again and and um then take on from where
[38:21] we
[38:23] stopped Jude is just the book before
[38:25] revelation
[38:30] so we are reading verses 3 to
[38:35] 4 amen beloved when I gave all diligence
[38:39] to write unto you of the common
[38:41] salvation it was needful to to write
[38:44] unto you and exalt you that you should
[38:47] honestly contend for the faith which was
[38:49] once delivered unto the Saints for there
[38:51] are certain men crept in and
[38:54] awar who were before of old ordained to
[38:57] this condemnation ungodly men turning
[38:59] the grace of our God into lasciviousness
[39:01] and denying the only Lord God and our
[39:04] Lord Jesus Christ
[39:23] [Music]
[39:31] [Music]
[39:44] amen you may be
[39:47] seated um speaking on contending for the
[39:50] faith Part
[39:55] Two for the saints that are with us on
[39:57] Zoom or hearing this for the first
[40:01] time on Sunday I was dealing with um
[40:04] with what our faith what the faith
[40:09] is and and I was I mentioned that there
[40:11] are many faiths on Earth
[40:15] today and many
[40:18] denominations but there is really One
[40:20] Faith one true
[40:23] faith and that's the the faith which was
[40:26] once delivered to the
[40:30] Saints by Jesus Christ when he was here
[40:34] on Earth and how from Jesus Christ on
[40:37] down to the
[40:40] disciples and from the disciples on down
[40:43] to the whole
[40:45] world but for the first 300
[40:49] years that Faith was almost
[40:54] pure until later on in 300 25
[41:01] ad when you know emperor
[41:05] Constantine
[41:08] R he helped sumon a
[41:11] meeting which was called n
[41:16] Council and that it was at a place
[41:18] called n
[41:21] or and um at that place there they
[41:24] agreed
[41:27] what should be the
[41:30] faith and they summarized and and the
[41:37] majority accepted to believe in in three
[41:43] persons that make one
[41:46] God and from that from that moment
[41:49] onwards they formed what they called the
[41:53] one the Catholic Church
[41:58] now Catholic means
[42:02] Universal Catholic means you know the
[42:06] Catholic Church means the universal
[42:09] church so then they would form a church
[42:12] which they believed to be the church the
[42:14] only church that held the true
[42:19] faith and later on they would go ahead
[42:22] to put a man to head that church
[42:27] and that man was called the
[42:29] pope now of course we know that that was
[42:31] not the true
[42:33] church and that what they had what they
[42:36] thought was not the true
[42:40] Faith but it was the Fulfillment of
[42:48] jude4 which says for there are certain
[42:50] men kept in
[42:54] unawares who were before of old ordained
[42:56] to this condemn
[42:59] and Godly men turning the grace of our
[43:00] God into
[43:04] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[43:09] God our Lord Jesus Christ so they denied
[43:12] him they rejected
[43:14] him and when they rejected him they
[43:16] formed their one one one world
[43:21] denomination and they wanted to bring
[43:23] the world into an order of of you know
[43:27] whereby they they believed in one
[43:32] religion so they turned the faith into a
[43:37] religion it was never a religion it was
[43:40] always the
[43:42] truth presented in the form of the of
[43:45] the
[43:47] scriptures which the disciples had
[43:50] written to different Believers in
[43:52] different
[43:54] places but this men when they came in
[43:58] they brought in their own dogmas and
[44:01] Creeds they brought in their own
[44:05] ideas and they began to teach it as the
[44:07] as the word of
[44:10] God when indeed it was not the word of
[44:13] God it was doctrines of
[44:17] men it was traditions of
[44:20] men so they replac the holy spirit with
[44:23] a
[44:25] man we see here then the B you know uh
[44:30] we I did read for you on
[44:33] Sunday where the Bible in the Book of
[44:35] Revelation speaks about the Deeds of the
[44:40] Nicol which later on became the
[44:43] doctrines of the
[44:46] nicolan so we see I read for you where
[44:48] the Prophet now goes ahead and expounds
[44:51] on what the the the deeds and the
[44:53] doctrine of the nians was
[45:00] this is where they it says N means to
[45:05] conquer and the latest meaning the
[45:08] people so the nian spirit was a
[45:12] spirit at a time that conquered or S to
[45:17] conquer the
[45:20] lady to rule over the
[45:23] people to rule over the church so now
[45:27] whereby God in his Sovereign
[45:31] wisdom had given the
[45:33] word and the Holy Spirit to lead the
[45:38] church but these men when they crept in
[45:43] they replace the Holy Spirit and the
[45:46] word with
[45:48] men with doctrines of men so now you had
[45:52] a holy
[45:53] [Music]
[45:54] priesthood instead of having a holy a
[45:57] holy
[45:58] nation so now you had a few men who were
[46:01] supposedly the ones who were
[46:05] holy the holy men whereby now the
[46:08] congregants came to them to confess
[46:10] their
[46:11] [Music]
[46:13] sins their word was
[46:15] law their word was the final
[46:19] Authority and ultimately the word of
[46:21] their leader the pope was the final
[46:23] final Authority
[46:28] so we see that that is a spirit of
[46:32] niolon and by the way that spirit is not
[46:35] dead it is still alive
[46:38] today whereby you find men you know
[46:41] submitting themselves to
[46:45] men rather than submitting themselves to
[46:48] the word and the Holy
[46:50] Spirit where they have replaced the
[46:52] leadership of the holy
[46:54] spirit with the leadership of men
[46:57] and I want to say thank God for the
[46:59] message of the
[47:00] hour because it has restored us back
[47:03] again to the leadership of the Holy
[47:06] Spirit to the leadership of the
[47:09] word Believers all around the
[47:12] world we are moved by the word and the
[47:14] Holy
[47:16] Ghost amen and the Holy Spirit will
[47:18] always agree with the
[47:21] word if it is the holy spirit leading
[47:25] you he canot to do anything that is out
[47:28] of the
[47:31] word if it is out of the word then that
[47:33] is not a holy
[47:35] spirit that is the spirit of the
[47:39] Antichrist praise the name of the Lord
[47:42] and so we notice now these men that
[47:43] crept in Una
[47:46] aware they came with the doctrine of the
[47:50] Nicol the word is not no longer continue
[47:53] to be the absolute
[47:58] and of course we know that that seed of
[48:00] the nians was sold in the
[48:05] beginning at Ephesus Church
[48:08] age at that time it was just a little
[48:12] seed a little baby
[48:15] Spirit which started out
[48:18] slowly and it started out eating up the
[48:22] church you know it was just a little
[48:25] deed
[48:27] which a few people
[48:29] practice trying to control the
[48:32] people trying to teach the people their
[48:34] own
[48:35] ideas trying to bring their ideas as if
[48:39] it is the gospel
[48:43] truth and let me tell you that same
[48:47] spirit that you know it comes in
[48:49] slowly you don't
[48:52] notice you don't
[48:54] notice and even in the in in the married
[48:57] couples
[48:58] meeting I spoke about that Spirit of
[49:02] nicolan really you know coming into the
[49:05] family you find that man well of course
[49:09] we know that the headship in the home or
[49:11] in the family is a man the
[49:14] husband and um but but you know not he
[49:17] not meaning the physical
[49:19] man because he says the head of every
[49:21] man is the wife the head of every woman
[49:24] is the
[49:25] man and the head of every man is
[49:29] Christ so even in the family when he
[49:32] says the head of the woman is the
[49:35] man it really means the headship is
[49:41] Christ not you the man the physical man
[49:45] because you two do not have your own
[49:48] head your head is Christ the
[49:50] word so that means every family every
[49:54] home must be laid by the word must be
[49:58] led by the Holy Spirit we must learn to
[50:01] do things after Consulting with
[50:05] God what what is God's will about
[50:09] this what does God intend to do but
[50:13] where you find a man saying me I have
[50:14] spoken I'm the
[50:17] man you must do as I've
[50:19] said no that's not the spirit of
[50:22] God you must consult with God you must
[50:26] know the will of
[50:27] what you're going to do in your home is
[50:29] it against the
[50:31] word does it agree with the mind of the
[50:33] holy
[50:35] spirit in the same way you also find in
[50:37] the
[50:39] family the spirit of
[50:41] Jezebel of that woman Jezebel who is not
[50:44] willing to submit herself to her
[50:48] husband and who is bringing foreign gods
[50:50] in in the home in the
[50:52] family because you see Jezebel was the
[50:55] spirit of Jezebel is a rebellious
[50:59] Spirit does not want to
[51:01] submit does not want to hear does not
[51:04] want to be
[51:05] corrected that's not want to be Tau
[51:08] that's the spirit of
[51:10] Jezebel it is attacking a
[51:12] generation but it's also attacking the
[51:15] family and God hurts those two
[51:18] Spirits the spirit of Jezebel and the
[51:21] spirit of
[51:24] the and now the message of the
[51:27] hour has come to restore us from these
[51:31] spirits of the age back again to the to
[51:35] the
[51:36] original back again to The Original
[51:38] Seed back again to the First
[51:42] Gospel back again to the faith which was
[51:45] delivered to the Saints and we today in
[51:48] this generation are contending for the
[51:51] original
[51:52] Faith which was once delivered to the
[51:55] Saints
[51:57] you find people have been over overcome
[51:59] by the spirit of
[52:01] Jezebel they they
[52:04] rebellious our generation is very
[52:07] rebellious people do not want to hear
[52:09] what the word of God
[52:11] says even when they hear they are not
[52:14] willing to soften their
[52:16] hearts they are not willing to hear and
[52:19] to break
[52:20] down the Bible says in the end time they
[52:23] will be
[52:25] he will be highminded
[52:27] lovers of
[52:29] pleasure more than lovers of God we are
[52:33] the ones living in this time do you know
[52:36] that people are like
[52:37] that people are
[52:41] he they high minded they love Pleasures
[52:45] more than they love
[52:47] God they love Pleasures more than they
[52:50] love the
[52:51] world but the restored bride loves the
[52:54] world more than she loves
[52:58] Pleasures amen we are containing for the
[53:01] faith we are restored back again to the
[53:04] beginning where the word is our portion
[53:09] where the love of Our Lives is the amen
[53:12] the word of God we are restored back
[53:15] again to the
[53:17] beginning praise God and we see that we
[53:20] are living in the
[53:22] time when these men that crept in
[53:24] unawares
[53:26] they have come and they have overtaken
[53:28] the
[53:29] church and theyve they've defiled
[53:33] it praise God so we looked at many
[53:37] things we also looked at the uh the a
[53:41] few things about the church
[53:44] ages and how it started in the
[53:47] beginning with the Ephesian Church
[53:50] age and church Ag and the others that
[53:53] came afterwards
[53:57] but you see that seed was
[53:59] growing we read about the
[54:02] S how he said leave them to grow
[54:06] together now two seeds in the framework
[54:10] of the Christian
[54:12] faith he said let them grow together the
[54:15] True Vine and the false
[54:17] Vine and he said but at the time of the
[54:21] Harvest we shall be able to
[54:23] separate the True Vine will go into the
[54:27] Ghana will be harvested the
[54:31] wheat but the
[54:33] tears will be packed for
[54:36] burning do you know we are in a
[54:39] generation where that prophecy is being
[54:43] fulfilled we are in a
[54:46] time
[54:48] when the True
[54:50] Vine which is the
[54:52] wheat being gathered up
[54:56] from all around the
[54:58] world from all tribes from all nations
[55:02] from all walks of life the wheat is
[55:05] being
[55:06] gathered the wheat is being gathered I
[55:09] feel like I am part of that
[55:11] whe I am
[55:13] gathered we are gathering around around
[55:17] Christ amen the prophet was asked a
[55:20] question where shall We Gather shall We
[55:24] Gather in TX or should we Gather in in
[55:28] Jefferson but then he said well it has
[55:31] been revealed to
[55:32] me where you should gather just gather
[55:35] in Christ the
[55:37] Lord hallelujah we are not having any
[55:40] denomination we don't have any
[55:42] headquarters together to we don't have
[55:44] any church together too if I tell it is
[55:47] days of the voice Fellowship I am a liar
[55:50] if I tell you is evening life I am a
[55:52] liar if I tell you it is this church or
[55:54] that church I am a liar we only have one
[55:57] place that place is not a church that
[56:00] place is not a denomination that place
[56:02] is the person of Jesus
[56:05] Christ that is why we must be filled
[56:07] with the Holy
[56:09] Ghost the Bride of Jesus Christ is being
[56:13] gathered by the voice of the
[56:15] bridegroom amen through the messenger of
[56:18] the last age and Gathering us back again
[56:23] to the foundations of our faith
[56:26] again to the Fai which was delivered to
[56:30] the Saints we are being gathered right
[56:33] there let others seek a home
[56:37] below I feel like traveling
[56:40] Oh amen this is where we want to be how
[56:44] many feel like traveling on
[56:47] tonight amen let me tell you brother
[56:50] sister if you are here joking
[56:53] around or playing
[56:55] around message preachers keep
[56:58] preaching and you you keep coming to
[57:00] church you hear a good someone you go
[57:03] back home you he a good someone you go
[57:06] back home but you are not willing for
[57:09] that word to change
[57:11] you one of these days you will be
[57:16] shocked you will be surprised when you
[57:19] come to church and you realize there is
[57:22] no one to receive
[57:24] you you there's no to preach to you and
[57:28] then you realize the raptures happened
[57:31] do you not to you called luk one message
[57:35] believer you are the first one going to
[57:38] know the Rapture has taken
[57:41] place when everybody else is still
[57:43] worshiping
[57:45] normally and then you will come to
[57:47] church you realize there is no one you
[57:50] will call the pastor he's not there you
[57:53] call the Deon he's not there you will
[57:55] call the sister not there and then you
[57:57] realize you are seeing someone
[58:00] else who was also not serious like
[58:04] you and you realize he also doesn't know
[58:07] what
[58:08] happened she realizes you are all
[58:13] stranded you look at yourself that
[58:15] morning or that it will be a morning you
[58:18] look at yourself and you realize it has
[58:23] happened imagine how you will look
[58:26] imagine how you will feel when you know
[58:28] the Rapture has taken place and you are
[58:32] left
[58:33] behind now you'll prepare
[58:36] yourself and of course you can't take
[58:38] your
[58:38] life if you take your life you go
[58:40] straight to
[58:41] hell so then you will know you have to
[58:45] wait for what comes
[58:46] next you have to be
[58:49] persecuted oh praise God because you are
[58:53] the foolish virgin
[58:56] you may realize you don't even fit among
[58:58] the foolish
[59:00] virgins because the
[59:02] foolish were
[59:07] virgins they were they had lived a
[59:11] life they were sincere
[59:13] Christians so to you message
[59:16] believer amen you cannot even be a
[59:19] foolish
[59:20] virgin
[59:22] because to be left for the rapture
[59:27] means you are not a serious
[59:29] Christian so what you have what you
[59:31] hearing today what you hearing every
[59:34] service take it
[59:37] serious and let it change your
[59:40] life amen praise the name of the Lord oh
[59:43] my I don't want to be left
[59:45] behind I don't want to be in the
[59:48] tribulation I want to go in the Rapture
[59:51] I want to go and be with the Lord and
[59:54] that's why we must contend for the faith
[59:57] today we must content for the faith
[1:00:01] today in what we do we must content for
[1:00:03] the
[1:00:04] faith in our life we must content for
[1:00:07] the
[1:00:09] faith our works must show what we
[1:00:13] believe our life must reflect what we
[1:00:15] claim to
[1:00:18] believe praise the name of the Lord and
[1:00:21] we see the Believers of every
[1:00:24] generation stood up for what they
[1:00:27] believed the Bible speaks of the seven
[1:00:29] Church
[1:00:31] agents right from
[1:00:34] Ephesus on down to the last
[1:00:36] one you know when you
[1:00:38] notice God came down in
[1:00:41] Ephesus and he used
[1:00:44] PO used Iranian P used
[1:00:49] maruse Kumba and then comes you know
[1:00:52] sadis then he uses Martin Luther Luther
[1:00:56] that was the time of the
[1:00:58] reformation and then comes
[1:01:00] Philadelphia this was a missionary
[1:01:03] age then God used John
[1:01:06] wisley amen and then we we we know we
[1:01:08] are living in the last
[1:01:12] age now this is the age of people's
[1:01:16] rights everybody claims they have their
[1:01:18] rights to do this to do
[1:01:20] that but this is the time God has sent a
[1:01:24] messenger
[1:01:26] William Bram with a message of
[1:01:29] restoration praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:32] this message is to restore us back again
[1:01:34] to the
[1:01:35] beginning back again to the foundations
[1:01:38] of the of our
[1:01:40] faith did you know that Paul was
[1:01:44] misunderstood by many but still Paul he
[1:01:48] laid the
[1:01:49] foundation but he was misunderstood by
[1:01:52] many but he laid the foundation of our
[1:01:55] faith
[1:01:57] and if you do not understand
[1:01:59] Paul you cannot understand William
[1:02:02] Bram if you can't believe Paul you can't
[1:02:05] believe William Bram if to you William
[1:02:08] Bram is a false
[1:02:10] prophet Paul will be a false prophet
[1:02:13] because William Bram had no other
[1:02:16] religion but Paul's
[1:02:19] religion bam did not teach another
[1:02:22] Revelation but he only restored what
[1:02:24] Paul preached
[1:02:26] he only Tau what Paul
[1:02:28] preached the message of William
[1:02:31] Bram is a message of
[1:02:35] restoration praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:38] Paul would say in the book of
[1:02:40] Galatians chter 1
[1:02:42] ver6 I Mar that ye are soon removed from
[1:02:45] him that called you into the grace of of
[1:02:47] Christ unto another
[1:02:54] gospel says which is not
[1:02:57] another but there be some that trouble
[1:03:01] you and would pervert the gospel of
[1:03:06] Christ so now this is Paul
[1:03:09] speaking and he says you
[1:03:12] removed from him that called
[1:03:15] you to the grace of
[1:03:17] Christ and you moved into another
[1:03:20] gospel but who are these that are
[1:03:23] bringing another gospel he is not
[1:03:26] another
[1:03:27] gospel but there remember he said Jude
[1:03:30] said certain men who crept in
[1:03:35] unawares and here Paul says it is not
[1:03:37] another
[1:03:39] gospel but there be some that trouble
[1:03:43] you and would perver the gospel of
[1:03:48] Christ but though we or an angel from
[1:03:52] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:03:55] than that which we have preached unto
[1:03:58] you he said let him be a cast as we said
[1:04:02] before so say I now
[1:04:04] again if any man preach any other
[1:04:07] gospel unto you than that he have
[1:04:11] received let him be a cast now Paul had
[1:04:15] the
[1:04:16] authority listen please he did not just
[1:04:19] say this
[1:04:20] words he was speaking it with what we
[1:04:22] call Apostolic Authority
[1:04:26] because he was the one that laid the
[1:04:29] foundation in 1 Corinthians 3:10 he
[1:04:32] says according to the grace of
[1:04:35] God which is given to me as a wise
[1:04:39] master
[1:04:40] builder I have laid a
[1:04:44] foundation praise God and another build
[1:04:48] there on but let every man take he how
[1:04:51] he build
[1:04:53] there for other Foundation can man
[1:04:58] lay than that is
[1:05:01] late which is Jesus Christ so now follow
[1:05:05] me closely here the
[1:05:08] foundation Paul claims to have
[1:05:12] L but then he goes ahead to say the
[1:05:15] foundation I have
[1:05:18] laid is Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ so now that means the teachings
[1:05:24] Paul told
[1:05:27] is Jesus Christ If any man deny If any
[1:05:32] man
[1:05:33] reject any of the teachings Paul
[1:05:36] told he is rejecting Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ it means he has a spirit of the
[1:05:43] Antichrist on
[1:05:47] him because Paul laid the foundation and
[1:05:51] the foundation was
[1:05:54] Christ praise the name of the Lord he
[1:05:56] says I've laid a foundation and that's
[1:05:59] why he could come up and say If any man
[1:06:02] preach to you another gospel than what
[1:06:05] we who the
[1:06:07] apostles has preached let him be a cast
[1:06:12] he says they won't preach another
[1:06:14] gospel they will be caring the same
[1:06:18] Bible but what they are preaching will
[1:06:21] be different from what Paul
[1:06:24] preached their results will be different
[1:06:28] from the results Paul
[1:06:31] had are you hearing me church so now he
[1:06:34] says those are already a
[1:06:39] cast praise the name of the Lord and
[1:06:42] then you ask me what did Paul
[1:06:45] teach Paul taught one
[1:06:49] Goden he said God is not a trinity of
[1:06:53] person today they preach the Trinity of
[1:06:57] they say there is God the
[1:06:59] Father God the son God the Holy Ghost
[1:07:03] and they say father is God son is God
[1:07:08] holy spirit is
[1:07:10] God but father is not the
[1:07:12] son and son is not the
[1:07:15] father and son and father is not the
[1:07:17] Holy
[1:07:19] Spirit each of them is not the
[1:07:22] other but each of them is God and each
[1:07:25] of them is
[1:07:27] separate but there one
[1:07:30] God that is a lie that's a lie help me
[1:07:35] and say that is a
[1:07:36] lie that's not the
[1:07:38] truth because they're trying to say God
[1:07:42] is like a bunch of
[1:07:45] grapes where you have several grapes on
[1:07:48] one on one on one
[1:07:52] branch God is not that way Bible says
[1:07:56] God is a
[1:07:58] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:08:00] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:08:03] praise the name of the Lord and in the
[1:08:06] book of First John you could put those
[1:08:07] verses there brothers first John
[1:08:11] 5:7 because I'm speaking fast and maybe
[1:08:13] people may want to see those
[1:08:15] verses and so you can just through it
[1:08:18] for them right there first John 57 it
[1:08:21] says there are three that that three in
[1:08:24] heaven
[1:08:25] there are three that that witness in
[1:08:28] heaven and he says one is the Father the
[1:08:32] word and the Holy Ghost and he says
[1:08:35] these three these
[1:08:38] three are one these three are one and
[1:08:43] then verse eight he says there are three
[1:08:47] that bear we record on
[1:08:49] Earth the the water the blood and the
[1:08:55] spirit and he says these three agree in
[1:09:00] one now listen the one that agree in
[1:09:05] one is because they are three distinct
[1:09:10] things you can have one without the
[1:09:16] other you can have the
[1:09:19] water which symbolize a
[1:09:22] justification without having the blood
[1:09:26] you understand you can be
[1:09:29] justified but not
[1:09:32] Sanctified you can be
[1:09:34] Sanctified but not filled with the Holy
[1:09:37] Ghost but
[1:09:39] justification and
[1:09:41] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:09:43] Ghost agrees in
[1:09:47] one
[1:09:48] salvation you understand me but here
[1:09:52] when he says the three that bear record
[1:09:54] in heaven
[1:09:57] the Father the word which is the Son and
[1:10:00] the Holy Ghost these
[1:10:03] three one not agree in
[1:10:07] one because you cannot have one without
[1:10:10] having the
[1:10:13] other why because they are the same
[1:10:17] person amen God the spirit condescended
[1:10:22] down and in the Book of John chapter one
[1:10:26] what does he say he says in the
[1:10:29] beginning in the beginning was the word
[1:10:32] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:10:36] was God Amen in verse 14 he says the
[1:10:40] word remember the word which was
[1:10:43] God the word which means God dwelt Among
[1:10:48] Us and we beheld his glory the only
[1:10:52] glory of the only begotten of the father
[1:10:55] full of grace and truth what does that
[1:10:58] mean amen the Jehovah of the Old
[1:11:01] Testament is the Jesus of the New
[1:11:04] Testament is the same God in the book of
[1:11:08] Isaiah 42 amen he says I am the Lord and
[1:11:12] that is my name and my praise I will not
[1:11:17] give to any
[1:11:20] grav which means he has a glory oh my
[1:11:24] follow me he has a glory and he cannot
[1:11:27] share his glory but then in
[1:11:30] Colossians 1 verse
[1:11:33] 267 he says there's a mystery there's a
[1:11:38] mystery which has been hidden for
[1:11:42] ages but now it has been revealed and he
[1:11:46] says this is the mystery Christ in
[1:11:49] you the hope of your
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:53] glory amen hallelujah amen now the glory
[1:11:56] of God which you would not
[1:11:59] share which you cannot share has come
[1:12:04] anded into a human
[1:12:06] being first in his son embodied in
[1:12:12] Jesus the son of God what was it he was
[1:12:17] Emmanuel walking down the streets of
[1:12:20] Jerusalem what was it God With Us
[1:12:25] God was above us now he became with
[1:12:29] us through
[1:12:31] Jesus on the streets of Jerusalem the
[1:12:34] disciples said we walked with him we ate
[1:12:38] with him we talked with him we saw him
[1:12:42] who was he amen when he was asked by the
[1:12:46] disciples he also asked he said who do
[1:12:49] you say that I am who do you say that I
[1:12:52] am and Peter by revelation he said you
[1:12:55] are Jesus the son of the Living God how
[1:13:00] could he be the Son of God if he was not
[1:13:04] God the son of a pig is a pig the son of
[1:13:08] a God is a God the son of a human being
[1:13:11] is a human being the Son of God is God
[1:13:16] himself Hallelujah when he said he was
[1:13:20] the Son of God the discip the Jews they
[1:13:24] wanted to kill him and his
[1:13:28] crime for calling himself God he never
[1:13:32] did say he was God he only said he was a
[1:13:35] Son of God but the Jews knew if you were
[1:13:38] a Son of God it means you are
[1:13:42] God and we find out later on that that
[1:13:46] Peter received that
[1:13:47] Revelation you are God In the Flesh and
[1:13:52] when and when Jesus heard that he told
[1:13:54] him
[1:13:55] Simon B for flesh and blood has not
[1:13:58] revealed this to you but my Father in
[1:14:00] heaven and upon this Revelation I will
[1:14:03] build my church and the Church of Jesus
[1:14:06] Christ has been built upon that
[1:14:10] revelation of who he
[1:14:13] is amen the Church of Jesus has been
[1:14:18] built upon the revelation of
[1:14:22] godliness upon the revelation of the
[1:14:24] godhead
[1:14:26] amen but they they have missed it they
[1:14:28] perverted it they T another Jesus they T
[1:14:32] another God but that same Jesus who was
[1:14:36] here on Earth is the same one who has
[1:14:40] come back again on the day of Pentecost
[1:14:44] the same Pillar of Fire which led the
[1:14:46] children of Israel in the desert is a
[1:14:50] same Pillar of Fire which came back
[1:14:52] again and when Paul saw it
[1:14:55] he said who are you my Lord my Lord
[1:14:59] because he knew this is the lord of the
[1:15:01] Old
[1:15:02] Testament and the voice out of it
[1:15:05] said I am
[1:15:08] Jesus in other words the Jehovah you
[1:15:11] know has become
[1:15:14] Jesus his name is now
[1:15:16] Jesus Oh My My My My that should make a
[1:15:20] True Believer to be
[1:15:21] excited amen the Jehovah of the Old
[1:15:23] Testament became the Jesus of the new
[1:15:27] and now we see that that same Jesus he
[1:15:31] came back
[1:15:33] again in the upper room in the form of
[1:15:36] another pill
[1:15:38] fire Hallelujah once again another P of
[1:15:42] fire and he divided himself into many
[1:15:46] pieces and he came in many
[1:15:49] disciples inside their hearts as the
[1:15:52] Holy Spirit and that's why he said
[1:15:55] the
[1:15:56] mystery which has been hidden for
[1:15:59] ages has now been
[1:16:01] revealed which is Christ in you the hope
[1:16:07] of your
[1:16:08] glory what is the holy spirit is the
[1:16:11] Lord Of Glory who is Jesus is Lord so
[1:16:16] the holy spirit is Lord Jesus is Lord so
[1:16:20] Jesus was the revelation of the glory of
[1:16:23] God and we have the full name of the
[1:16:27] father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] as the Lord Jesus Christ and this is
[1:16:32] what Paul taught this is what all the
[1:16:34] disciples stood for but when these men
[1:16:37] came in they came and and broke it
[1:16:42] feared it introduced the Trinity to
[1:16:45] deceive men who were
[1:16:49] unsuspecting and today billions of
[1:16:51] so-called
[1:16:53] Christians believe in the
[1:16:56] Trinity the Trinity is a Doctrine from
[1:16:59] her it is not a Doctrine from the
[1:17:02] Bible it is an antichrist
[1:17:05] spirit amen it's the spirit of
[1:17:08] niolon to come and rule over
[1:17:10] people yet it was never a Bible
[1:17:13] Doctrine it was never a
[1:17:17] teaching but today it has been restored
[1:17:20] back to
[1:17:21] us by the message of Our Generation
[1:17:24] amen why did Paul preach you say Paul
[1:17:27] preached water baptism in that name we
[1:17:30] just talked about the name above all
[1:17:32] names the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:35] did you actually know the Bible says I
[1:17:39] believe it is in the book of Colossians
[1:17:41] that whatsoever you do in word or In
[1:17:44] Deed do all in the name of the Lord
[1:17:49] Jesus giving thanks to the father by do
[1:17:53] all In The Name Of The Lord Lord
[1:17:55] Jesus why because the name of Jesus is a
[1:17:59] name above all
[1:18:01] names God has had many names in the Old
[1:18:05] Testament he's been called Gyra he's
[1:18:07] been called Shalom he's been called s
[1:18:11] it's been called many names it's been
[1:18:12] called Jehovah but in our time he has
[1:18:16] come to us amen with a name above all
[1:18:19] other names amen and that's the name of
[1:18:22] Jesus and that's the name that can save
[1:18:25] you from your sins and the Bible says At
[1:18:29] The Mention Of The Name of Jesus every
[1:18:31] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:18:35] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and
[1:18:39] that's the name and that's what Paul
[1:18:41] taugh Paul taugh the power of the
[1:18:45] name the Believers in the book of Acts
[1:18:48] they were
[1:18:49] persecuted because they Tau in the name
[1:18:52] and when they arrested them then they
[1:18:55] would tell them when they releasing them
[1:18:58] one time they told Paul you can go away
[1:19:02] but just be sure not to speak in that
[1:19:05] name
[1:19:06] again the devil feared that name because
[1:19:09] he knew the power of that name At The
[1:19:12] Mention Of that name amen the devil
[1:19:14] Shacks At The Mention Of that name amen
[1:19:18] the devil knows is The Only Name that
[1:19:22] can beat him when we are praying for the
[1:19:24] sick
[1:19:25] we pray through the name of Jesus Amen
[1:19:28] when we are chasing demons we Chas them
[1:19:30] in the name of Jesus Amen when we're
[1:19:32] praying for deliverance we pray in the
[1:19:34] name of Jesus and the devil knows is The
[1:19:38] Only Name that can defeat him because
[1:19:42] Jesus is the only one that could defeat
[1:19:45] him on the cross and because the devil
[1:19:48] knows that he has tried to take away the
[1:19:51] name from the lips of the people and
[1:19:55] when it came to water
[1:19:56] baptism he replaced it with
[1:19:59] titles of father son Holy Spirit they
[1:20:02] don't know those are titles but in the
[1:20:05] Book of Matthew
[1:20:06] 28:9 Jesus said baptize in the
[1:20:10] name the name of the father Son and Holy
[1:20:14] Ghost one name not names of but they
[1:20:19] name
[1:20:20] all and that name is the Lord Jesus
[1:20:23] Christ
[1:20:25] Hallelujah is the name above cancer it's
[1:20:28] the above witchcraft it's the above
[1:20:30] poverty it's the above your sickness is
[1:20:33] a above your problems it's a above every
[1:20:36] Mountain you have in your life if one
[1:20:39] day by
[1:20:40] Revelation you can simply call on the
[1:20:42] name of Jesus Christ you will notice
[1:20:44] your mountains can
[1:20:46] move the devil has been against that
[1:20:49] name that's why we should never take the
[1:20:52] name of the Lord in vain
[1:20:55] praise the name of the Lord and we see
[1:20:58] that
[1:20:59] baptism is Paul preached it should be in
[1:21:01] the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:21:03] Christ you know he also taugh the Holy
[1:21:05] Ghost
[1:21:07] baptism and he Tau it that it is a
[1:21:11] seal until
[1:21:13] Redemption and he said that every
[1:21:14] believer should receive
[1:21:16] the and and and apostles also Tau
[1:21:21] it they all believed that a man having
[1:21:25] believe must receive the Holy Spirit as
[1:21:28] a matter of fact in the book of Acts
[1:21:32] 19 Paul asked the Believers who had
[1:21:35] believed these were people who had been
[1:21:37] already
[1:21:39] baptized they had been baptized
[1:21:42] already and they were found at a place
[1:21:44] called
[1:21:46] Ephesus and they were Disciples of
[1:21:48] John and so Peter asked Paul asked them
[1:21:51] a question and what then were you B
[1:21:56] and he said baptized unto
[1:21:59] John well then he said well John bapt
[1:22:02] baptized un
[1:22:04] repentance and then he began to teach
[1:22:06] them about
[1:22:08] Christ and about the name of the Lord
[1:22:10] Jesus and the Bible says when they heard
[1:22:14] this they were all
[1:22:17] baptized now this is the second
[1:22:20] time it doesn't matter how many times
[1:22:23] you are baptized
[1:22:25] you may be baptized 1 million
[1:22:28] times I don't care if it is not in much
[1:22:33] water and in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ you have to do it over
[1:22:39] again you are not
[1:22:41] baptized and these people in the book of
[1:22:45] Acts chapter
[1:22:46] 19 they went back again to the water I
[1:22:50] found a preacher who told me you know
[1:22:53] those people did not baptize the second
[1:22:55] time they simply prayed for them to
[1:22:59] receive the Holy Ghost I said you are a
[1:23:01] li when you go to the Scripture it says
[1:23:04] they were
[1:23:05] baptized and when Paul had prayed over
[1:23:09] them they receed the Holy Ghost and they
[1:23:12] began to speak in tongues and to
[1:23:15] prophesy amen Paul Tau amen the baptism
[1:23:19] of the Holy Ghost but it is so sad today
[1:23:22] that even if find so-call believers
[1:23:25] they no longer believe in the baptism of
[1:23:27] the Holy
[1:23:28] Ghost you may have believed but if you
[1:23:31] have believed and you have not been
[1:23:34] filled you are a
[1:23:36] theologian but until you filled with the
[1:23:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you are
[1:23:43] just a
[1:23:45] theology but we find every believer that
[1:23:48] believed was filled was filled was
[1:23:52] filled with the power
[1:23:55] of the Holy Ghost amen that is the power
[1:23:57] to overcome that is the power to live a
[1:24:00] Christian Life that is the power to
[1:24:02] overcome the world no man can fill you
[1:24:05] with the Holy Ghost no man can give you
[1:24:08] the Holy Ghost Only God
[1:24:10] Can amen and you can only do it by
[1:24:15] asking by being under
[1:24:18] expectation he will fill you with the
[1:24:20] Holy
[1:24:21] Ghost amen some people thought when you
[1:24:23] receed the message
[1:24:26] you have received a full
[1:24:28] package which within it has the Holy
[1:24:32] Ghost when you receive the message
[1:24:35] you're just going to the Rapture you
[1:24:37] lying yourself wake up because even if
[1:24:41] you receive the message you have to
[1:24:43] receive the life of the
[1:24:45] message the message is one thing it is
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] mechanics by the Holy Ghost is the life
[1:24:52] that come to the mechanics
[1:24:55] and he gives it
[1:24:57] power praise the name of the Lord when
[1:25:00] he comes on that morning he's going to
[1:25:02] be looking for one
[1:25:05] thing the token the token is the holy
[1:25:08] spirit amen if you don't have it you may
[1:25:12] be in church you may claim to be a
[1:25:15] believer but your life will never match
[1:25:18] up to the
[1:25:19] word until you are filled with the Holy
[1:25:22] Ghost then and only then
[1:25:25] then and only then will you be able to
[1:25:27] live the life of a
[1:25:29] Believer and friend if you don't have
[1:25:31] the Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost you are not going to the
[1:25:35] Rapture amen you know the prophet would
[1:25:38] also
[1:25:39] say that you know one person told me you
[1:25:41] know brother bam said you can be
[1:25:43] baptized with the Holy
[1:25:45] Spirit every day of your
[1:25:47] life and go to hell I said well yeah
[1:25:51] that's true that's true he's talking
[1:25:53] about the
[1:25:55] anointing you know you can be you can be
[1:25:58] baptized into the anointing every
[1:26:01] day you know by the holy ghost coming
[1:26:05] upon your body and upon your spirit and
[1:26:09] then you have an emotional
[1:26:12] experience you may shout you may dance
[1:26:14] you may talk tongues and everything but
[1:26:17] if the life doesn't come out that means
[1:26:22] you only receive an emo
[1:26:25] experience in the Book of Ezekiel he go
[1:26:28] father to say amen he must receive a new
[1:26:32] heart a new spirit and his
[1:26:36] Spirit now many people receiveing new
[1:26:39] hearts and others receive a new spirit
[1:26:42] and they think they received the Holy
[1:26:43] Ghost no no no no sir praise the name of
[1:26:46] the Lord the Holy Ghost if he comes in
[1:26:49] your soul your life will change and when
[1:26:53] you receive him
[1:26:55] he abides in you he can never leave you
[1:26:59] until the day you go to
[1:27:01] Rapture there and is there to
[1:27:03] stay many Believers don't have the Holy
[1:27:06] Ghost and that's why it is hard for you
[1:27:09] to leave a Christian Life and how can
[1:27:12] you receive the Holy Ghost you only have
[1:27:14] to ask you have to believe for it you
[1:27:17] have to take time you can just come in
[1:27:21] church and have an emotional experience
[1:27:22] and say that's it
[1:27:24] no you have to seek after him you have
[1:27:28] to thirst after him unless you are
[1:27:30] hungry unless you are thirsting you
[1:27:33] cannot be
[1:27:35] filled and how can you claim you have
[1:27:38] the Holy Ghost when you still have anger
[1:27:41] when you still have lust after this
[1:27:44] after that after the other when you
[1:27:46] actually still are doing rumors all
[1:27:49] over passing this here passing that here
[1:27:52] passing it show you are not yet
[1:27:55] changed it show something in there is
[1:27:59] lacking you are the one falling from
[1:28:01] this fication into another
[1:28:03] another it means you are
[1:28:06] lacking you are
[1:28:08] lacking but unless you have the hunger
[1:28:11] for
[1:28:12] it you cannot be filled with him you
[1:28:16] have to have the hunger you have to have
[1:28:18] the thir and the Bible says blessed is
[1:28:22] he that hungers
[1:28:24] after righteousness blessed is he that
[1:28:27] thirst after righteousness they shall be
[1:28:31] filled but if you don't have the hunger
[1:28:33] for him the thirst for him you will not
[1:28:36] be filled
[1:28:38] friend and I'll be a liar to tell you
[1:28:40] you'll go to
[1:28:41] heaven praise the name of the Lord you
[1:28:44] know when he comes in your life he
[1:28:47] changes your entire
[1:28:48] nature really he is to change the
[1:28:53] nature natur the way it is cannot
[1:28:56] inherit eternal life we need a new
[1:29:00] nature and the Holy Spirit changes
[1:29:03] Natures praise the name of the Lord
[1:29:06] hallelujah hallelujah and you can
[1:29:08] receive the Holy Spirit no matter the
[1:29:10] age you
[1:29:12] have even if you are 9 10 years 8 years
[1:29:16] seven years 5 years as long as you have
[1:29:19] the thk for it and the hunger for it
[1:29:23] even if you 40
[1:29:25] you can receive the Holy Ghost you can
[1:29:27] have an experience which will change
[1:29:30] your life forever another say you you
[1:29:32] can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:35] silently you cannot receive the Holy
[1:29:37] Ghost
[1:29:38] silently because there is no one who has
[1:29:40] ever been born
[1:29:43] silently where you are there is but
[1:29:46] those who are born silently are all
[1:29:48] dead because if you had a still birth
[1:29:51] it's a dead birth
[1:29:54] yes if a child is born and is still it
[1:29:57] means he's
[1:29:59] dead and a prophet said some Christians
[1:30:02] who have got a still
[1:30:05] birth they have to receive some spanking
[1:30:08] of the
[1:30:09] gospel and then they will be born and
[1:30:12] then a cry will go out you know let me
[1:30:15] tell you you know our religion is not
[1:30:18] the Holy Ghost is not emotion no it's
[1:30:22] beyond emotion life is God
[1:30:27] himself but but when he comes it is an
[1:30:30] emotional
[1:30:32] experience amen hallelujah amen that
[1:30:35] crying you hear going
[1:30:38] out is not the
[1:30:40] life but that crying comes because the
[1:30:43] life has
[1:30:46] come amen so you can't tell me you
[1:30:50] receive the Holy
[1:30:51] Ghost without an experience
[1:30:54] you must have an experience you must
[1:30:57] have an experience something you can put
[1:30:59] your foot on and say that day that hour
[1:31:04] that minute God vised me and my
[1:31:09] life has never been the same
[1:31:12] again that is the
[1:31:14] faith and we are contending for that
[1:31:18] faith and I tell you friends that's what
[1:31:21] Paul
[1:31:21] preached Paul stood for it
[1:31:24] Paul believed in
[1:31:26] tongues in manifestation of tongues and
[1:31:29] interpretation of tongues
[1:31:31] and that's what he believed in and he
[1:31:34] find you know people who are against
[1:31:36] those
[1:31:37] things we are not against the
[1:31:39] manifestation of the Holy
[1:31:41] Ghost it doesn't
[1:31:43] prove it's not the absolute proof that
[1:31:46] someone is
[1:31:49] filled but it is the
[1:31:51] proof that the Holy Spirit has
[1:31:53] manifested
[1:31:57] so the person with the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:59] the one who who doesn't have
[1:32:03] him both can have the
[1:32:07] manifestation and that's a mystery
[1:32:10] because the prophet says that the the
[1:32:12] rain falls on the just and on the
[1:32:16] unjust and and and in the Bible he
[1:32:18] speaks of the latter Reign and the
[1:32:19] former
[1:32:21] rain and the prophet says the former r
[1:32:23] is the teaching
[1:32:26] rain the doctrines the pressing in order
[1:32:29] and everything but then the latter rain
[1:32:32] is the falling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:34] then we are in a generational time where
[1:32:37] he's giving us both the former oh my God
[1:32:40] he's giving us the former Reign and the
[1:32:42] later re at the same time in the same
[1:32:46] season here he he said ausa was not the
[1:32:51] was not the full restoration
[1:32:55] had a latter
[1:32:58] rain but they never had a former
[1:33:01] rain but you see it could not be the
[1:33:05] full
[1:33:06] restoration until the word has also been
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:10] restor so the
[1:33:12] Pentecostals are not wrong in that they
[1:33:15] have the
[1:33:16] gifts and manifestation of it because
[1:33:20] that is to be
[1:33:22] expected it was promised to be
[1:33:25] restored but only restored the former
[1:33:28] part of the latter rain
[1:33:30] rather the manifestation of the
[1:33:34] gifts and the power of God but you know
[1:33:37] they could not be the original
[1:33:40] bride that had the full
[1:33:43] faith until the full word was also
[1:33:47] restored to the
[1:33:49] church and guess when does the word when
[1:33:53] does the come into
[1:33:55] view the bride only comes into
[1:33:58] view when the
[1:34:00] word and the Holy Ghost has been
[1:34:03] restored to the
[1:34:05] church we are the
[1:34:07] generation we are the people amen
[1:34:10] because we are living in the
[1:34:12] time when
[1:34:14] Mal amen has been
[1:34:16] fulfilled because he said behold I send
[1:34:20] you Elijah the prophet what will he do
[1:34:24] he will turn the hearts of the children
[1:34:28] back to the fathers we are living in
[1:34:30] that time John the Baptist fulfill the
[1:34:34] first portion of the fathers of the
[1:34:36] children that is the fathers of the law
[1:34:40] to the wisdom of the J shall live by
[1:34:42] faith from the LA to Grace but the
[1:34:46] malach F the end time women would
[1:34:48] restore the hearts of the
[1:34:50] children the Gentile children the church
[1:34:55] would take their hearts by the teaching
[1:34:57] of the
[1:34:58] world and it would take us by this
[1:35:02] doctrines amen by all these doctrines of
[1:35:06] one God of water baptism in the name of
[1:35:09] our Lord Jesus Christ the manifestation
[1:35:11] of the gifts here as a woman is
[1:35:14] covering the second coming of our Lord
[1:35:17] Jesus talk about the
[1:35:19] tribulation the Rapture no women
[1:35:22] preacher no women preacher in the
[1:35:25] Bible he thought about all that deons
[1:35:29] pastors must all be married
[1:35:32] men or rather married to one wife I
[1:35:34] should
[1:35:35] say dress in modest
[1:35:37] clothing Grace not this
[1:35:41] Grace oh because we have Grace let us do
[1:35:43] what we want said no no no Grace
[1:35:47] means the Life of Christ gives you the
[1:35:50] righteousness of God and then you can
[1:35:53] leave the world
[1:35:55] not yours but
[1:35:57] his and you
[1:35:59] live that's the grace that he told
[1:36:02] modest clothing operations of church
[1:36:05] offices and
[1:36:08] Gifts Cain as a son of the wicked one
[1:36:12] these were all teachings taught by
[1:36:15] Paul Believers Maring
[1:36:17] Believers believer not not not
[1:36:20] fashioning after the
[1:36:21] world all this were doctrines and
[1:36:25] teachings taugh by Apostle Paul but the
[1:36:28] church lost it in the
[1:36:30] way but what did he say when Malachi 4
[1:36:34] comes on the
[1:36:36] scene Matthew
[1:36:38] 1711 he said and Jesus answered and said
[1:36:41] unto them Elias Elijah truly shall first
[1:36:46] come before Jesus comes and when he
[1:36:49] comes he will restore all things
[1:36:54] Hallelujah the former rain and the
[1:36:57] latter rain shall be
[1:36:59] restored in the same
[1:37:01] season amen the teaching of the word the
[1:37:05] full doctrines of the Bible everything
[1:37:08] Paul
[1:37:09] tgh everything the apostles
[1:37:12] belied together with the power of it
[1:37:15] together with the Holy Ghost together
[1:37:18] with the manifestation of it will all be
[1:37:21] restored again to the ch
[1:37:24] that's what he Tau and here we are we
[1:37:28] have been restored again back again to
[1:37:31] the beginning and this is the
[1:37:34] faith we are contending
[1:37:37] for praise the name of the Lord and I'll
[1:37:40] finish it off
[1:37:41] tonight with this
[1:37:44] quot praise God not for one moment
[1:37:47] brother bam
[1:37:48] says do I bring a message to the people
[1:37:51] that they may follow me
[1:37:55] or join my church or start some fell
[1:37:58] organization I have never done that and
[1:38:01] I'll will not do that now I have no
[1:38:03] interest in those things but I do have
[1:38:06] an interest in the things of
[1:38:08] God and the people and and if I can
[1:38:11] accomplish just one thing I will be
[1:38:15] satisfied that one
[1:38:17] thing is to see
[1:38:19] established a true spiritual
[1:38:21] relationship
[1:38:24] between God and
[1:38:27] Men wherein men become New Creations in
[1:38:33] Christ filled with his
[1:38:35] spirit and live according to his
[1:38:39] word I would invite and plead and warn
[1:38:42] all to hear his voice at this
[1:38:47] time and yield your lives completely to
[1:38:51] him and even as I trusted in my heart
[1:38:54] that I have given my all to
[1:38:57] him and he says God bless you and may
[1:38:59] his coming Rejoice your
[1:39:02] heart that is the message of the
[1:39:05] hour that is the anti message that's
[1:39:08] what we
