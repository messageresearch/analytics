========================================

and he gave some apostles and prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers to you as a gift i want to say accept the gift kid accept all that god has for you amen let's continue reading verse 12 why did these ministers come for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ [Music] because ministry is not supposed to preach against people ministry should not uh speak against a circumstance or uh something that's happening in the church [Music] and of the knowledge of the son of god unto [Music] have you ever made a mistake the problem is when you ask a minister if he makes a mistake in his personal life you notice how hard he'll get hard how hard he will get oh it is i'm going to tell you what that minister is dealing with or any of you are dealing with what you're dealing with any minister that is like that or a person that is like that where they harden their hearts they have pride how many want to be proud foreign [Music] i'm when you've received great revelation i mean i have your seats so this morning we want to speak on our christ centered absolutely question write it down and come talk to me afterwards so what i took from that under that ministry was that it's important to take notes do you want your children to have the life of jesus christ in them granada a living [Music] lifted up his message you cannot understand the imbalance is when we make this greater than the bible [Music] if you're taking notes this message that i'm going to preach came from 1962. [Music] 12 30 a.m [Music] and it was called the absolutely what's the five things denominations are preaching about right now brother tim anders has never gotten a message from the google uganda team andy stage [Applause] the only thing i need to read as a true minister god if a person ministry today the bride ministry should only be preaching the third pool for the timothy brothers when we preach the third pool will we have a big congregation never okay never again because what we have in the message of the hour people that preach the first pool and second point they want someone to come lay their hands on them and shout hallelujah see we have an hour we had an hour and a half of and today [Music] the and we preach the is not going to churches that are having hundreds of baptisms i'm not going to churches this is a citadel mechanism that are having hundreds of people baptized now listen very carefully baptism is an important and i said where are the people you baptized most of those people don't even have a bible and most of those same people do not read the message we're having this huge sweeping revival in uganda then why are there only 50 people here do you understand what i'm saying i'm not trying to attack anybody sitting they want to and that's to give all glory to jesus christ amen amen hallelujah just like a brother timothy could stand here when it seems brother bus is lifting him up brother is not lifting up him he's lifting up in timothy we're lifting up jesus in the brothers is if we compromise on the word of god only the true believer will stay this brother gave a testimony that god provided a job what if this brother though in his hour of need had texted me and 15 then he would have replaced jehovah jireh oh yeah is god gave him a greater job you need to stop i'm discerning spirits in africa a god called pastor must be set by god if you're cheating on your wife someone already knows money somebody already knows money someone already knows you committed adults he knows has been seared [Music] brothers but have somewhere that you go to somewhere you support the but don't never disfellowship that that is causing disunity in [Music] what do i need to do brother jim if i have hey repent tiffany it's done winning it when you repent but you might have to email them and when that and see if he has the same purpose in his heart you got fellowship one with another when when we're not when when will you have that fellowship when you discern his spirit when brother tim sits over here and i listen to a minister when brother tim sits over there oh look on that team but nevertheless and i listened to a minister or anywhere in the church i it i'm looking at his spirit i'm looking at what his motive and objective brother bus oh foreign gosh on the bus not because i think he has a great ministry not because i think he's a special man i came because the spirit in me is the same has been crucified by people i want you to be thinking about your pastor right now your pastor is not here right you all know 104. and bring it back he should be able to bring an argument back into sweetness he knows how to take care of things if they did you know that there is a big movement in the message of the hour oh she might if you receive tithes from people that don't go to your church you're a hypocrite do you understand what you're talking about ties are supposed to go as brother branham said to the local minister to the local church that you go you know what's happening right now what never changed when they started streaming [Music] service instead of two on saturday do you understand what's going on hypocrite liars taking the word of god and taking advantage of it brother and sister in the message i hope you're not serving the message for blessings brother tim does not serve jesus christ to be blessed the you desire to do good you must be given to hospital why do people believe it they can just drink wine you just disqualified yourself [Music] and you know what i'm lowering myself to oh my gosh [Applause] you say your bride but you live like the church how can you be bribed don't stop translating the message not every message is in your language right now uh we're talking about you can translate the message oh and all the brothers didn't like that go and look at thursday night at cloverdale by the way makes an announcement that a chinese sister is translating the service and he says something very profound you can do that so where in the message do we get it that men can only translate a lady is greater than a man my prophet said my wife is greater than me my wife is who i am if you you want harmony in your home if you want harmony in your life why don't you just try right saying sit down here's some ice cream you relax and i'll wash [Music] this is a hard thing but it's nothing but the truth you know how i can say that because the prophet for our day did the same thing yet people have asked the question how long should a sister wear a skirt um [Applause] but i saw the pastor's wife wearing tight skirts i saw the pastor's wife with a big split what yourself with a man i don't his can you please raise your hand someone in here that has never had a disagreement or argument it made a person seem like they were perfect use that [Applause] i know i just heard more sisters saying man than brother [Applause] [Music] when i read the messages [Music] you should be able to meet any person on this world god bless you how are you how have you been how is your family [Music] [Music] they accused [Music] the longer you're in the message the greater chance an entitlement spirit can rise yes entitlement spirit you're entitled as the only group okay the men that make themselves special are a denominational and he can do nothing wrong i'm sorry you're following a man i was in many churches as i said he was not your husband do you know why the rapture hasn't happened yet to test you ah if you'll continue loving jesus you know why the rapture didn't happen in 1977 [Music] [Music] her children need to look at her mommy and see jesus yeah but their children need to look at their mommy when i talk about sister rebecca i'm talking about the bride when you're gonna pick a man let's turn to first corinthians chapter one how many are loving the message hey man it's 12 30 we got about 10 more minutes is that right brother bus first corinthians chapter one you're all invited to come to the gideons and we're gonna preach there at three or three thirty i don't just preach with one brother i don't want to just preach with one brother continue the unity of the faith crystal that all of you be in full agreement in what you say and that there be no divisions [Music] he has a special gift of healing you try to tell you are guilty of denominational spirits 60 70 years old why are men not letting young men preach there's one reason why because brother in the back in the white house the bible i'm thankful for a grammar that believes the message i mean myself she transcribed the message i didn't get it brother she transcribed the message my grandma my grandpa for 36 years edited and made the message this little tiny piece of paper and now they have congregations that are thousands [Music] when you witness you're trying to get them to your church don't think you need prayer from your pastor you can speak the word and you can believe the word a close zakat god wants to be personal to you today who wants to serve of god of 2000 years ago the way dagger where is god when did you last listen to the message some of you haven't even you say you're ministers of the gospel but you go and talk to five ministers and get their thoughts i'm only 29 years old but i have a revelation [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] have mercy on our sisters [Applause] [Music] forgive our brothers that talk [Music] you are the same [Music] [Music] what did you see in 1963 i saw jesus [Music] how many see jesus in the message how many say lord forgive me of my wrongs forgive me of my sin lord jesus christ if i die today i want to go home i don't want to be found like abraham with isaac [Music] i want you to pray for your unsaved [Music] surgery [Music] you want to be a sweet young lady [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's who i am [Music] [Music] i mean [Music] when we praise god hallelujah means praise the prophet said in africa hallelujah means the same thing is that right amen hallelujah amen so we might speak different languages we have a language that is the same it's a heavenly language [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] we thank you and lord we thank you lord we [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] how many love the lord [Music] let your heart
