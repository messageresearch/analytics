use his voice this morning praise the name of Allah I want to say that I've been immensely blessed by Pastor said and even the few moments we've spent together sharing and hearing him speak he have ministered to me and I want to say are blessed you have a wonderful Ministry in the man of God and I was feeling while we were sharing a few things in my heart I was feeling like he needs to come all over our area and preach all over and I'm telling you what God has blessed you here amen we should appreciate the man of God amen and his wife oh yeah God bless you so much do you appreciate his wife let me tell you these sisters do a great work in the ministry to stand behind the man of God and and this song they are the family of the pastor sang Yesterday it really touched me and this morning as they sang it it really touched me even deeper I want to say what we were hearing were the gifts of the holy spirit amen hallelujah let us pray while we are still standing and then we shall read and then get seated Lord Jesus we want to take this moment once again this is the resurrection morning father we have sung We have had special singers sing and we have rejoiced Lord over what you did for us on the course of Calvary father Lord we realize that we are so undeserving Lord father Lord we we were not deserving of this but because of your grace and your mercy oh God you reach down your hand for us and you called us out of sin and you have come here Lord Jesus to him and resurrect us and oh father that you may amen conform us O Father transform us into your image oh God into your character that one of these days a dear father Lord when the trumpet of God shall sound oh Lord all those that have been transformed by Your Word oh Father they will have a transformation of their bodies amen and they will be out of here and they will go in the rapture we are looking forward to that father and even Lord one more time this morning we ask you to come and speak to us one more time this morning we ask you to come and sit free the captives one more time this morning we ask you to come and heal the sick one more time this morning we ask you to come and move in our souls father that we will leave this place oh God when our hearts abandoning within us saying that didn't he or our hearts they ban as he spoke to us that's my desire this morning Lord come and take me out of the way my brother who is going to interpret we have nothing Lord of ourselves but what we are relying on you just like Jesus said without him I can do nothing without him without you this morning we can do nothing father we ask you that you come and take over lord for you have called this meeting you have gathered us from near and far just to come and gather around your word we are confident that you will come and speak to us this morning Father we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ and everyone said amen amen I'll have you take your Bibles before you get seated there's a brother that sang I don't know where the pastor told me he has I asked her they said he has a few albums if a few songs he has recorded my what a gift we are really blessed with a lot of wonderful singers and musicians and I told the pastor I want to buy several of those albums so whoever you are you make sure you find me so I can buy some of those it's just wonderful hallelujah amen Luke chapter 22. I have this inspiration in my heart I might not have the voice but I have this inspiration in my heart and I believe if you pull on the gift then the holy spirit will give you what you need to hear this morning Luke chapter 22 39. and we're reading 39 to 44. 44. if you're there say amen amen and they came out and went as he was he was want to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray ye pray that ye enter not into temptation all right and he was withdrawn from them about the Stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou will if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in an Agony he prayed more honestly and his sweat was as it were a great drops of blood falling down to the ground it's all right okay now it's the same scripture but I'd like us also to read it in Matthew before we get seated Matthew chapter 26. and see let us see how Matthew reports about this Matthew 26 um Matthew 26 verses 36. then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto the disciples City here while I go and pray under foreign Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy okay [Music] then said he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death and watch with me foreign [Music] if it it is possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will okay foreign [Music] he may he may be seated God bless you and bless the reading of the word so this is our last service and so let us make use of it amen amen I told you if you preach with me then the holy spirit will use me and we won't have to worry about my Broken Voice The Way You Preach with me is if you hear the word just say amen amen foreign so this morning last night I just see past aside I came with a lot of preparations I had enough summons to preach but see everything I came with I preached nothing out of it and so what I'm going to preach to you today was an inspiration which came to me last night and our inspiration is always within the message we don't have another inspiration out of the message praise the name of the Lord and so I was thinking about Jesus you know how today is a resurrection morning and Jesus rose again but do you know when the battle gets the hottest just when Victory is about to come but where Victory is about to cast that's when the devil speaks louder and the devil doesn't speak from the outside but the devil begins to speak from the inside and there was but not because everything was lost because because there was something new going to come forward and Jesus yes I wondered why was he crying because he fear death Hallelujah let us not spiritualize [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] he moved away he did not want to die he feared he was a man just like and I believe at that moment many thoughts might have been going through it they never must have told him do you know what you can give this up you don't have to die how can you imagine think that you would die for the whole world so out of that okay [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise God let me tell you today Jesus Christ Jesus Christ another person samasa Jesus did not say it is finished even today there's only one thing in my mind foreign [Applause] foreign what do you think that Boaz felt this way Boaz was not yet married so when he had us I am Ruth you know sisters before they get married they don't talk with a very strong voice [Music] um my family [Applause] if I foreign um Hallelujah and she slept right back praise God and the whole night she was saying hallelujah hallelujah the morning is coming

hallelujah hallelujah everything is foreign [Applause] Hallelujah oh praise God I have a redeemer this morning in this channel to offer himself as a sacrifice thoughts to retreat but Jesus songs [Music] foreign foreign praise God the devil tried to convince us to surrender by giving him Victory without fighting by giving him the kingdom without the cross on three uh fronts listen carefully three fronts with the first front the last of the flesh Hallelujah distance Jesus Jesus was being tempted the other front was bride of Life the pride of life did you know you can fly you can fly so I'm telling you jump off he will send his angels [Applause] is it foreign Hallelujah he was trying to give him Kingdom without the cross now remember the whole time it was that Jesus was with the devil walking hand in hands it was in his mind so I'm telling you the devil was trying to convince Jesus oh [Applause] we have a reason to Rejoice he refused on the cross Sunday morning [Applause] Oh Glory to God I say he rose again Hallelujah [Applause] come on foreign she's going to remain dead [Music] Hallelujah praise God but Jesus when he died he could not corrupt he could not Decay the queen
