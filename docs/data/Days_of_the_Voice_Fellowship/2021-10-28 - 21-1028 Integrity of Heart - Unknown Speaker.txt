TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and if thou wilt walk before me as david i further walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and with that and will keep my statutes and my judgments that i will establish the k the throne of thy kingdom upon israel forever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not they shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel nobody all right let us read verse six and seven but if you shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them then will i cut off israel out of their land which i have given them and this house which i have allowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb under by word among all people obama may the lord blessings upon his word he may have you see my command i just want to greet each and every one of you in the precious name of jesus and we want to thank him for yet an opportunity has given us to be able to gather in his house this evening i'll just go straight to the message amen i mean this evening i'm going to share on something very very important i want to welcome you back happy to see you although you disappeared without informing us and the church where you are gone so tonight i'm going to share on the in on integrity of heart everybody say it integrity of heart integrity of a heart away symbol and um i take that from verses three four actually brother give me that verse again first kings 9 3 he says and the lord said unto him i have had a prayer and this application that thou hast made before me i have allowed this house which thou hast viewed to put my name there are there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually no questions so god that uh um solomon had built a house for the lord sure and god told him i have had your prayer i'm pretty dope and i've had this application no question that you have made before me your cousin and therefore i have allowed this house which thou has built to put my name there foreign there is one thing built in the lord our house and another thing the lord receiving that house with your mind many times people serve god but when it is in his permissive world [Music] but the reason is they don't go to the lord in prayer they don't seek the face of god or the mind of god about what they want to do for him [Music] their heart is not following the leadership of the lord but their heart is following their own desires and it has on their own objectives and and and things that they have and they want to achieve it many times we do serve the lord when our motives and our objectives are not right and this evening by the grace of god and so david had wanted to build a a house for the lord before he did he inquired of the lord to see the mind of god and the lord told him no david as much as you were man after my heart i do not allow it that you could not build a house for me put your guns in bill and you because your hands are full of blood become an accountant and accepted it a new manager and he said i've heard even your prayer now my name is don't do what it does and even i have accepted to come and dwell in this house and they said i'll be several months ago i did speak on uh you know the a relationship having a relationship with god a person of god [Music] [Music] if isaac would accept also to have a personal relationship with god then now he would become the god of isaac so you see it goes on and on and on keeping the startups and the judgments with god in doing the in the commandments and david walked in the integrity of his heart now god has visited now solomon is telling him if you solomon era [Music] if you walk with me like this single tumblr then i will establish your throne amen of thy kingdom upon israel forever as i promised your father david saying they shall not fill their mind upon the throne of israel you can walk with god like david walked with god you are bound to receive the blessings that david received when he walked with god god favored solomon because solomon also walked with god solomon was a king he walked with god like solomon who walked with god come to solomon you have spoken to him the second time like as he did at gibbons telling him he's giving him several ways he can be able to walk with god one of those ways to walk with god in the integrity of hearts integrity is the quality of being honest and fair away [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] the quality of being honest integrity is a matter of the heart away integrity is not land somewhere integrity is a matter of the heart symbol this is something that originates from the from the from the type from the nature of the heart they never tried we are born without integrity of heart trans everybody now we are a symbol because we are born with bitterness you're born with selfishness come to the world speaking lies we were born in sin and therefore we are born sinners towards our liberty but when we receive christ there is something that he cherishes that is something he's looking for in each of you and that is integrity of her channel and by the time of the end of the service probably the lord willing we shall have you know covered a few things about this [Music] you will get yourself very carefully cut on your more your god bless david's throne catherine [Music] [Music] the bible says in the book of ezekiel that we even god will give you what fast the first thing he gives you is a [Applause] [Music] he [Applause] he gives god his guidelines here uprightness uprightness keeping the statutes and judgments doing god's commandments and then four walking in integrity of heart many people today in this long distance very many people there they don't have the integrity capital business advantages [Music] in day-to-day lives children are not having integrity parents sometimes they don't have integrity or is that the rumor symbol people around about us our communities our societies no integrity moving forward people do not fear to speak alive you as a christian someone asks you and you you are very careless to speak in life if you are a liar you are a bad witness [Music] the bible says you deliver souls because you are a faithful witness and jesus christ tells us he is a faithful and true witness of [Applause] [Music] who can tell me that i have not faithfully abided with every oh moved or been faithful in every word that was written about me [Music] right i'm requesting that we go a little bit faster so that we can be able to cover all these things he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheep folds from following the use gret with young he brought him to feed jack of his people amen out of those ships which were feeding their younger ones who took him from there so that he can feed it jack of his people could he say a couple of months so that he can feed jack of his inheritance is the lady of chicago the inheritance of god wakatonda so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart okay something [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] he was already trained by the sheep because remember sheep has a nature and the nature of the sheep is after the shepherds and so we notice that david was already a shepherd means the one who fits the means listen to me the one who guides looking for god was looking for a pastor after his own heart what type of heart imaging integrity no matter how much he tries he cannot help you since god you do not have confidence in him i cannot help you so what does that do you know the word of god is a two-edged sword oh my god [Music] the together and then speak with each of them now you'll get a number one b without taking any sides and then ending and end the whole thing by bringing it back into sweetness and so the bible tells me here i believe and israel all right he says so god brought him to feed them israel the people of god according to the integrity of of his heart [Music] the bible tells us so david fed them according to the integrity of his heart this young man here is our pastor yeah type of a man who was david said he was a man who was close to god that would be animal said yeah are you a company hear the voice of god relationship with god even the pastors themselves they kind of do those worldly styles as but i want to thank god by the word of god our pastors are only chamberlain do you know who are you is he has no seed to give you omula of himself but he's only giving you a seed of his mask we do not want to get the character and the nature of our leaders to get the character and the nature of the one that sent our leaders david in many ways is a type of jesus christ so that's why the bible says that he amen he fed the people according to the integrity of his heart [Music] he guided them by the skillfulness of his hands hallelujah samuel chapter 13 verse 14. somewhere the lord because thou has not kept that which the [Music] him oh how i love it jesus yes he's the one who introduces the mind to the ministry i don't believe it is a man who calls another one into the ministry the secret is anti-monetary name of awareness for the church of mechanisms all the bible colleges god himself introduces a man into the ministry yeah yeah after oh god may you give a testimony about me may he give a testimony about you make a question where the devil will give his testimony and sit down in iowa i went over jerusalem ah as a matter of fact amazing therefore satan will give his testimony against you i come with you this way amen but the lord the name will come up is [Music] he did [Music] [Music] [Music] be passed and guess what who will be the judge i don't know what you will be shocked he hallelujah amen some people they say i don't um but if your attorney knows the judge just just know everything may go away the atom is the judge we stand free and forgiving so immediately we shall be forgiven forgiveness that we shall be set free through this we are already afraid there is no condemnation everybody comes to them that are in christ hallelujah hallelujah david his integrity of heart was god's testimony and the lack of integrity in his uh is in fact actually i want you to see this the lack of integrity is in is in fact first an issue of the heart if your heart is not right you cannot have integrity don't suffer with a symbol if my heart is right when you call me if my heart is right when it causes me if my heart is right when it comes me i'll be somewhere listening for my name if your heart is not right when he calls you nothing will happen but if your heart is right when he calls you boy you will hear your [Music] brings out words and so i want you to to the brother to project that for me in just a moment praise the name of the lord amen okay we can go now from verse one brother you can just interpret directly now abraham journeyed from there toward the towards the negev the south country even settled between kurdish and shu then he lived temporarily in iran [Music] i've been managed king of gerald's sent and took sarah into his harem when abraham saw that the let me tell you tell him only half truth she's my sister oh your money some people they don't want to lie but they want to tell half you know what you're supposed to say tell it all be honest is did you know there is a certain level of grace that god has given to his servants what a way to get you are abraham said again of sarah she is my sister ibrahimovic amen is were stealing sin what were your children he was with you now and the fact that he was with you erection in our way he brought you out yeah hallelujah amen you are here only as a testament god is a witness [Music] [Applause] a had not yet come near her so he said lord will you kill a people who are righteous and innocent and blameless regarding sarah arabic [Music] and the bible said that david had the integrity of his heart attack bible yeah you know where symbol material skillfulness of his hand nobody if you want me are you following me no doubt they have very many differences between him and david i have a reason why you should not kill me what i've done is wrong position but let me present this before you can't you take it let me present this before you can't do you do it out of the innocence of your hand sometimes you find believers i said believers let me do it okay let him feel it and he's a believer where is the integrity in your heart oh where is god cease [Music] then god said to him in the dream god speaks through even him yes we wow it was i said oh when i when i read this i shouted when i was at home i don't know if i'll be able to live with them but listen he said it was i who kept you back and spared you from sinning against me we find many times are some women who claim to be believers i say he raped me i was raped it can't happen to you he was the king sarah was there masala as in a woman is according to the scriptures i am the one who even kept you away from here situation maybe one time let me give you medicine that you can use amen i mean you may shout that no one may have gone on the only thing you have to do naturally what is happening amen amen [Music] for our people to pay back so that she can be released but she said she prayed yes let none of these men touch me the integrity of your heart always go when you are going there with that kind of heart bro nobody [Music] [Music] okay okay and why are you sleeping kept him back and god gave him sleep the bible says bible god gives his beloved sleep at this time he used the scripture for his beloved protect [Music] if god can spare the king young people who have given me testimonies when they were almost about to backslide but god did something miraculous and they came out protected you from sinai god is able to keep you from sin of course if those things happen in your past as i'm preaching to you now don't let the devil bring them back to you so now return the man his wife i didn't know zayama kaaba and before he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will leave but if you do not return her to him away know that you shall die you and and all who are yours all your households you shall die if you don't return her singer isn't it quite amazing how god works why was this man saved [Music] he was lied to the india he did not know and he did not have a wrong intention wrong motives his motives and intentions were clear evidence god knows whether what you do is from the integrity of your heart [Music] if you have integrity of hearts god will ensure you do not sing yes you'll be tempted but god will ensure [Music] but then i get up here and here is a big mountain and i say you know if i get over that mountain and save all those hundred people someday they will have a statue there and they write a big question brother branham the great missionary [Music] me [Music] as i read this quote for you while i was reading it i stopped and thought for several minutes oh that's why i prayed for that and god never did it but your followers heart is leading me [Music] and i can't get over the mountain and i can't get around the mountain and i [Music] [Music] let me do that and he turn that mountain mountain no seven o'clock move wow remember you have tried to go around okay let me speak and he says nothing may happen that moment uh [Applause] you may not have started yet to see but it is on its way going if you are standing right now and then he says i would stay right there again because god said so we are trying to collect money to buy a piece of land so we can fill a ship there it looks impossible it looks like a big mountain hey man i mean but let me tell you what we ought to do right [Music] [Music] a good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bring it forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh [Music] you the abundance of your heart [Music] goes he says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bring his first thought which is good again [Music] but an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bring his fourth what sometimes the holy spirit one young man gave me a testimony that i enjoyed today one young man could be a testament today that i really enjoyed it i was walking on the road i'm sorry to say this i hope you're not your friends as he was walking on the road he found this girl who was badly dressed everyone was looking at him and your hand but it's not right please stop it this young man you can say maybe he was so strong let's be a bit faster now then psalms 119 with my whole heart have i sold fee oh let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not see against thing here is how david was able to maintain the integrity of his heart always simple to make the word of god in his heart do you have a desire in your heart for moral purity 15 at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the drought but those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart and they defile the man matayo coming up from the mouth really comes out from the heart like the words of my mouth like the meditations of mine look for me against the power of sin in the last days [Music] we need to guide against the power of sin in this last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last testament out of faith where are they that you will take the people in just on probation or come in join the church and do this or have a little sensation or something mechanism to defy all the things of the world the bible says in revelation 10 8-11 thou must prophesy again so are we prophets pretty nappy amen amen where are those prophets that will dare to defy and defy all the things of the
