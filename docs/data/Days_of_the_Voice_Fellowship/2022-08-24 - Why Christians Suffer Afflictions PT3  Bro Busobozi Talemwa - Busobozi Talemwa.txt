give you the praise [Music] as you commit this service into your hands [Music] foreign I'd like us to go to the scripture [Music] Romans 8 28 is and as you open we can sing that chorus your love is like life to me your love is life to me [Music] oh my two as long ing my deepest knee without you one moment I don't know where I would be your love your love his life to me how many believe that tonight foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God them who are the called according to his purpose now is praise the name of the Lord Maybe okay my name is I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ why [Music] do Christians afflictions I've been blessed by this subject all right I can see that I've also been blessed and I think the Lord has a little more for us tonight amen I mean most of you already received motivated with how men already receive it is why do Christians suffer afflictions and I was taking a quote from the message the church age book and the message the judge age of small I believe it is I see this about on the projector if you can project that quote for us we're gonna project um and I just have a small portion that I wanted to read for you there it says here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of God you know these two is needful you know remember here demonished he said take not thought for the moral what you shall eat or what you shall put on come on your father knows knoweth the things you have need oh man I believe that tonight father knows everything we have needed amen Amina if you believe it well you might as well say Amen your father knows he who clothe us they really and feels the sparrow shall do much more for you oh yeah this physical things are not the true basic necessities of your life now let me ask you a question those of you who went to school I'm sure you will answer this question what are the basic necessities of life foreign Healthcare or medical or whatever it is now those are the basic needs but what does our Prophet said these physical things and intimidating what are the physical things a house to sleep in a walk Surah come on [Music] um oh I tell you I have drums and drums of what in my house I cannot I have a lot of food I have a garden of food some people in their house they think to be rich is to eat chicken and meat and their and fish every day but our Prophet has told us these are not the basic necessities of your life consists of the thief that's not a man's life does not consist of the things he possesses seek him first the kingdom of God and his righteousness it will be added unto you Hallelujah according to God all these material things of the world if he decides to give it to you praise God if he doesn't give it to you still love him it's not the proof of his love whether or not to give you the material things of the world those who have been following so far you have we have found out that the proof of God is love is elections raise the name of the Lord amen the proof of God is love is elections for him to prove that he loves you yeah he chose you in him before the foundation of the world but that's your proof right there so how many Allowed by God here hallelujah I mean if it is revealed to you in him before the foundation of the world that God loves you seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all material Necessities how many of us every day when you wake up in the morning you seek the kingdom of God and his righteous how what percentage of your life is filled with how you will be able to get the kingdom of God and his righteousness the reason why they are not blessed by God in their mind they are preoccupied with the with the with the uh with the material necessities this material Necessities as if it was the most important in your life all communities but I tell you we need to have a mindset change Karma Moody adrenal Jews and the words I have faith am I preaching to someone yes hallelujah hallelujah we need to have a mindset change to send the words I have faith do you agree with me brother Andrew okay brother Solomon you agree sorry we need to have a mindset change to choose them we need to stop seeking for this necessities of the world we need to stop seeking for material necessities this is not what I'm saying this is what God himself is saying [Music] fast kingdom of God and he is righteousness God can do many things that is everything he says in his word is to accomplish it he has to fulfill it is why we believe God condition testosterone 32 you will always fulfill his wife and here is what we are saying fast the kingdom of God hallelujah I mean let me find men and women younger men and ladies who are seeking for things in the world that's not bad [Music] for you know seek first the kingdom of God [Music] is going to give you food again he's going to give you clothes it's going to give you water it's going to give you a house you find someone who will always miss church service he's not there on Friday look down coming down most of us he come to anyone and when you ask him what is wrong with you brother the situation is not easy suffering seriously tell you things are very hard [Music] but let me tell you such a person seeking after the wrong thing to be Charmed and no matter how long it takes those things even when he attends them they will fly away God says the truth and if you want to attain we are going to be for now those things sick after the kingdom of God and he's right yes Hallelujah Amina that's what the Bible says one of the one of the of the Patrick said I've been young and I'm not old but I've never seen the righteous begging for breakfast the kingdom of God and his righteousness righteousness so if you find a brother sister who is after the righteousness of God if you receive the Revelation you just shout a man I mean praise the name of the Lord and then God peace there is no one who can ever serve him or live for him and claim that your time was wasted you can never waste your time with God other people can make you labor and they will not pay you your wages if you work for God if you live for God if you serve God God will always pay you your wages so why do Christians suffer Affliction sometimes they suffer afflictions because they do not prioritize God in their lives because the suffering of a Believers only for Hallelujah I mean praise the name of the Lord are you following me Church the Lord delivereth him out of them all so if you suffer afflictions and God does not deliver you out of them one month two months three one yeah [Music] it is a cross of any belief God promised he will deliver you out of your Africa will afflictions [Applause] we find that one of us after him did not have a child divided [Music] foreign son my daughter has to be delivered when sickness cannot remain there come the times when even death itself cannot stand before here come the time my brother poverty cannot smell on you anymore you cannot remain the same if you're being under the power of the Gods forever why do people why do Christians suffer foreign hallelujah amen I don't even see what they have they don't have visions things are difficult but whoever comes to the Lord they must suffer affliction are you following me now I hope that the Lord is working on your mind oh it's working on yours God bless you I mean but rather seeking first the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all the material Necessities will be added down to you know hmm the people of God are not Material minded they are christ-minded evidence hallelujah amen oh I said hallelujah hallelujah as I preach this I'm looking through my life as if I'm looking through a mirror listen there was a time that I could not even afford a bicycle one which said I couldn't afford a bicycle I have a bicycle to ride I was walking and sweating you remember those days and by the time you reach Church several kilometers and you go to church you just believe the message and you just want to serve God everything the only thing in your mind and your friends 16 years later they did sick and even I have much more than what they have amen it is going to come to you hallelujah amen you don't need to pray for materials you don't even need to believe for them it must be added to you you play the the rules hallelujah amen and the world can't understand how this works but the children of light understands hallelujah hallelujah the people of God are not Material minded around say our Christ's mind do you know that many people in the world they don't want to do anything unless they know how they benefit out of it one again what is the need for me after all it is a you know it's uh it's not my work let them those ones who can but yeah but it's so good you find I always see brothers who come here and they clean up the church I was thinking about you I was really thinking about you you know that is something that you cannot do unless you're moved in your heart let me tell you something there is nothing that goes and noticeable for God whatever you do for his kingdom it is you were on his list for the people he is going to add something amen hallelujah amen he said seek me and I would like [Music] if you're christ-minded she will give you the materials he will never give you anything material that is if you're his child but if you're not his child foreign [Music] so they do not seek the treasures that are below the Christians do not seek the treasures that are below amen amen it is absolutely true the majority of Christians are not worthy that's true not only because that God doesn't want them to be wealthy because they are seeking after the world I uh but but only if they were to seek after God I wanted to take your time if you don't have examples come to me in my private time I'll give you examples find Believers of this message in the things of in the material world moving and then look at their lives we look at it carefully you will notice they prioritize that's the first thing nothing comes before God that's what I've noticed their give us they give not only to the work of God they give the necessity of the Saints number three what are they made of that we are not made of good for thoughts right meaning so rather many Christians are on the Poor Side it was so in Jesus's day it was true in Paul's day and it should be true today oh it is not too true today for the Rhodesian Church age for the audition age is one of the vast wealth where often the Criterion of spirituality is an abundance of Earthly Goods um [Music] my how rich the church is the goods too but how poor in spirit blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it's not Material it is within us a rich man is rich in God's regions that somebody had in Christ even if you are a billionaire but if you do not have Christ you are poor neighborhood but even if you are poor and you have nothing but if you have Christ you are the richest hallelujah amen that's why I believe as we must always be contented you will not stand on the principles as a Christian the principles of the world because of the love of money you will forget the word of God because of the Love of Money Christians make many many mistakes in life because of the Love of Money [Music] that God wants us to have the money the Bible even said we should make ourselves friends of Mammon thereafter we have gone out of this you know world we shall be received in the Everlasting habitation it doesn't mean money will help us to go to heaven against actually sent us we will use it to serve the Lord because it's awareness we will use it as a means to live for Christ hallelujah amen money will not speak but Christ in us will speak and command all the material wealth of the world we should change our mindset to choose if you want to change your situation brother sister you must change your mind stop seeking after the worldly things speaking seeking after God it doesn't mean it should be lazy all in charge from Monday Saturday I actually do not believer the believer should be in the church from Sunday to Sunday he's a kind of situations and find time and come in the house that's why we have three services in a week and they are not like consecutive [Music] foreign even worse than an Infidel why would I do any movie never cat videos anything you can never go in the Rapture how can you be worse than an Infidel if you will go to the Rapture movie you may believe all the doctrines foreign [Music] [Applause] you can say well I'm working I'm too busy that I can't come to church you have a problem oh I'm too busy with God I can't go to work so you see how how the word of God balances you see that's why even the gospels of today have made it easier for those lazy people you don't need to work you find them moving with kids even no idea of finding a job or completely no business idea but he's possessing possessing what are you possessing that's not the kind of Christianity we've been given Christianity you see praise the name of the Lord now why do Christians suffer so that way he Christ can make known his attributes to our others through us I want to know Christ let's read second Corinthians chapter one verse 3. blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforteth Us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort where we we ourselves are comforted of God second Corinthians foreign foreign [Music] foreign if how many he have ever had a headacheco I mean I've never had headaches all of us have had a headache so if I tell you I'm feeling headache I'm handling a big headache can't remember immediately you remember what you went through or maybe toothache together Billy Paul have you ever had patience patience oh so all of you understand what to change you've never had tooth pain but you you've had bath pains so now I don't know so you see truth pain or toothache I remember one day I was in the others and uh you know throughout the week from Monday I had it but it was not so much and then you know it continues and then I I was taking painkillers and so when it goes I said I'll find out it will require a lot of money so one day at the end of the week in the night you know he started slowly slowly around uh 11 p.m so I said I'll just take some painkillers [Music] let me tell you I went on in every room of the house your blessing foreign you know let me tell you God allowed me go through that so that I may understand when someone else is going through it from That Time When someone tells me I have to speak I really take good care of them even when I'm praying remember I pray for my um because I know what it means hallelujah hallelujah now you understand what Jesus that yes how to come down on to the yard and where the body which we have I am I don't know every Temptation that we go through and go through the pain we go through it all right when we go through it you will say I understand money hallelujah amen that's why when he he told like we talked on Sunday when he told his videos he said I know what you're going through foreign foreign [Music] [Music] who got healed from cancer I don't know my wife what's up we have a list of believers who God has healed from HIV there is no sickness Our God cannot delivered and he says and the old man as he stood there I begin to feel sorry for him Old Rugged courtesy my shoulders up the side of his to see if my coat would fit here I looked at his feet on his feet that's the all the way up as far as you could see where his rugged trouser leg my shoe wasn't nothing like big enough for him and I begin to look and I thought oh that poor old man maybe never had a good meal in all his life even begin to think about that brother because he himself in his upbringing he had a rugged life himself so he can Now understand you see why you have to go through some things that you go through don't begin to beat yourself up for the things that have happened in your past God permits it to happen so that you can't Comfort others going through this um praise the name of the Lord and down here I'll read the story for you he says oh the economics of the of Mexico is very poor The Brick Mason gets about eight pesos a day and it takes about four days to get a good hard labor to buy himself a pair of shoes is what does Pedro do working for about 10 two pesos with six or eight children to race oh it's terrible and I thought after all that the devil has given him evil to Blind his poor old blinded eyes how cruel it was to him and I begin to enter into something [Music] his head over on my shoulders glorious meaning glory to God and a man could see as good as I could the people begin screaming everywhere was entering into that Fellowship of his suffering in his blindness charity [Music] you must do it before you pray for somebody you must enter into the fellowship of their suffering that's why even the bible say that Jesus is the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities let me tell you nobody May ever understand your situation all right now he says you see so in Hebrews 4 14. seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heaven Jesus the son of God let us hold first our profession you can read it actually because for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Anga is [Music] TV because he said in all points now let me read something from the message which would stop shock you come back in the message the deity of Jesus Christ he says listen God had to suffer Temptation he couldn't suffer temptation he had to suffer sexual temptation he had to suffer all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches and powers and dominions he had to suffer all of that you're not yeah in order to do it he couldn't be as God in spirit he had to be God in flesh [Music] but there is not nothing new on Earth the Bible says whatever is has already been yeah Hallelujah so whatever people are suffering today whatever whatever tricks and traps the devil is formulating today that's why he is our high priest while we are suffering through this temptation don't suffer they are silently telling you don't suffer silently don't be there alone and even fear to pray because you think you are a big time sinner let me tell you you must open up before the presence of God Amen whenever we have church here don't get closed in you open up brother sister needs to be with women and men crying and having tears amen of repentance and tears of asking for Mercy before God is knowing we are not coming before God who is in heaven with an iron road but you are coming before a high priest who understands because what you are going through he has gone through it before you two can overcome a recreation of Christianity is not one of sailing it is one of fighting every day we are fighting we are fighting against demons fighting against them let the principalities we have to fight until we overcome hallelujah amen until we said the very last drop of blood is let me tell you as long as I have some present me so we mentioned I am not going to allow the devil to have glory in my life I'm going to tell the devil every day you can send whatever you want to send to me I'm going to fight brother want to fight in Atlanta I don't care how much you come at me I'm trying to fight hallelujah amen because Jesus is my strength Jesus yes he is my hope yes my hope is not in myself it's not in my ability but he is we come without Assurance [Applause] because I trust in you my hope is in nothingness hallelujah amen let me tell you sometimes we need to preach to the devil God is looking for such man amen who will preach the devil yes why don't you stand on your feet right now sometimes you need to preach the devil let me tell you in prayer Masala I remember there was a time I was around 16 or 15 something like that was hiding at me with a lot of things turning and generating to me that made me think no I cannot proceed on this journey of salvation but I I still remember I stood in prayer asking God for mercy and Grace foreign and begin to speak into speaking to the devil or you're getting this done brother shouted up and he said he said when I fall and he said Rejoice not against me all my enemies when I sit in darkness and the Bible says rebuke the devil he told him he says may God rebuke him so sometimes we need to address Saturn himself I'm putting you on notice you have made me suffer I'm coming to you like David spoke to that Goliath spoke and he said yes you have come to me with a spear once again next time the sword nature I come to you in the name of the Lord hallelujah amen you have to address the Devil Himself the suffering that you've been going through and as you speak that whenever you get it you begin to enter Faith well I'm not waiting for music I just want to go in priority just enter into prayer and begin to just speak to your problems you can walk around feel free foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] victory [Music] my brother walk away we just see through tonight if you're sick speak to your sickness foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] we are receiving our victories low in our homes [Music] [Music] oh yes Lord Jesus because of your greatness and your faithfulness Blessed

tonight the Holy Spirit wants to your life and make things different and new in your life friends can't you see that God wants to want to cry again do something in your life one of his sons and these meetings we've had on suffering [Music] God trying to make himself real to us [Music] telling us that what we're going through them as individuals she knows themselves [Music] let's be quiet now listen to the voice of the spirit in your heart [Music] brother can you play that song I can hear my savior according slowly slowly you see throughout all these services [Music] the Holy Spirit tried to make himself known to us making himself known through his word he knows each individual here he knows each of our life he knows our past present in the future [Music] we don't know our future but our life is in his hands and through these Services [Music] can you trust me okay can you depend on me I know whatever you are going through I've gone through it before [Music] the Battle Is Mine to fight I'm going to fight each of your battles but can you serve me fast so come on you follow me fast can you put aside everything else all of the things in the world put us on the side between us I will add whatever I want to add in your life and I will do it but foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you are greater than you know he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world but he wants

because of you even will be my home [Music] and I'm glad to know because of you if there will be praise the Lord I just want to before we go to announce that this Friday I'm gonna turn again we are going to have a full day together in a youth a service service so everybody's welcome so this Friday we shall be here we'll have two sessions I wanted to do this for a long time only that I thought about getting it announced when it was already too late I do not exactly know when the holidays are nice and there's a minister I wanted to come from Nairobi but foreign I would like to say that we we're going to have a youth service in the morning to be preaching service at exactly 11. it's our Channel okay then yes so that uh so it's gonna be like a Sunday actually it will be more than a Sunday because we can have two sessions so we will have a morning session which will be a preaching service and in the afternoon session we will have a session of questions and answers so if you have any questions if you want to write them before we are going to be one nikanga Services can do that and uh can either give it to me or you can send them to me on Whatsapp WhatsApp feel free to send them whatever whichever way you want somebody but if you get a cheat and write your needs never enough that would be wonderful children engineer it's good if you put your name but even if you don't put your name really it doesn't matter what it was you but I will appreciate if you can include your name is and you feel like you have not said your name you can perfect amen so this this uh this youth meeting is going to be for this church but that does not mean that uh because we didn't make arrangements before and uh but it doesn't mean that you cannot invite any other friend of yours if they don't have such a program in their charges you want them to come and be benefited to be blessed please invite them uh will also be a friend who is not a belief of the message so we're going to
