[1:21:26] Kind precious heaven
[1:21:29] father, we want to thank you for this
[1:21:32] wonderful
[1:21:34] day. Indeed, it's a great
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] day and we are
[1:21:43] glad that we owe a debt we could not
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:51] pay. And you pay the debt you did not
[1:21:54] owe.
[1:21:58] But God, we needed somebody to wash our
[1:22:04] sin. But we want to thank you because
[1:22:06] there was one who was
[1:22:11] willing to die on the
[1:22:14] [Music]
[1:22:16] cross. Father, we thank you
[1:22:19] Lord because you carried our sin with
[1:22:22] you.
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:27] And we are the beneficiaries Lord of
[1:22:29] that which you did.
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:33] And that's why we are here Lord
[1:22:36] Jesus. For the Bible tells us in
[1:22:39] Romans that all of us we
[1:22:41] sin and we fell short of your
[1:22:45] glory. But father we thank you because
[1:22:49] you had a plan before the foundation of
[1:22:52] the world.
[1:22:54] Jesus, you took the lamb
[1:22:57] and the lamb was laid before the
[1:23:00] foundation and you wrote our names with
[1:23:02] the lambs father with precious
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:06] blood. Father, we thank you Lord Jesus
[1:23:10] and when we talk about
[1:23:12] Jesus, father we know what you are
[1:23:14] talking
[1:23:15] about. Heaven father even this morning
[1:23:19] release your presence in our meetings.
[1:23:21] May the Holy Ghost move in our midst,
[1:23:23] Lord Jesus. May you come and prove to us
[1:23:26] this day that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:23:30] yesterday, today and forever. Father,
[1:23:34] may you take me out of the
[1:23:36] way. May you sanctify me with my
[1:23:40] interpreter. May you cleanse the
[1:23:42] congregation this morning that you

[1:39:50] book of Matthew chapter
[1:39:55] 28? Amen.
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:12] We are reading from verse one say that
[1:40:14] in the end of Sabbath as it began to
[1:40:17] down toward the first day of the week
[1:40:20] came Mary Magdalene and other Mary to
[1:40:22] see uh the supplicer and behold there
[1:40:26] was a great earthquake for uh and behold
[1:40:29] there was a great earthquake for the
[1:40:31] angel of the Lord descended from heaven
[1:40:34] and came and rolled back the stone from
[1:40:37] the door and sat upon on it. His godness
[1:40:40] was like lightening and his remnant
[1:40:44] white as snow. And the fear of him, the
[1:40:48] fear of him the keeper did shake and
[1:40:51] became as dead men. And the angel
[1:40:54] answered and said unto the woman, "Fear
[1:40:56] not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus
[1:40:59] which was crucified." And he said, "Not
[1:41:02] here, for he is risen." And he said,
[1:41:06] "Come see the place where uh see the
[1:41:10] place where the Lord lay and go quickly
[1:41:13] and tell his disciples that he is risen
[1:41:16] from the dead. And behold, he goeth
[1:41:19] before you into Galilee. There shall ye
[1:41:22] see him. Lo, I have told
[1:41:26] you." And they departed quickly from the
[1:41:32] supplicer word. And as they went to tell
[1:41:35] his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
[1:41:38] saying, All hail. And they came and held
[1:41:41] him by the feet and worshiped him. Then
[1:41:45] said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid. Go
[1:41:49] tell my brethren that they go into
[1:41:53] Galilee, and there they shall see me.
[1:41:56] And now when they were going, behold,
[1:41:59] some of them
[1:42:01] watched, came into the city, and showed
[1:42:05] unto and showed unto the chief priest
[1:42:08] all the things that were done. And then
[1:42:11] they were assembled with the elders, and
[1:42:14] had taken counsel, and they gave large
[1:42:17] money unto the soldiers, saying, Say ye
[1:42:20] his disciple, came by night, and stole
[1:42:23] him away while we slept.

[1:45:12] Lord. You can see where corruption
[1:45:15] started.
[1:45:18] You can see where bribe started. Blessed
[1:45:20] be the name of the Lord.
[1:45:22] Are you happy this morning?
[1:45:25] I am glad to tell you that Jesus rose
[1:45:29] from the dead.
[1:45:32] Amen.
[1:45:33] The other day on Good
[1:45:35] Friday near my place
[1:45:39] there. There is a Pentecostal church
[1:45:42] there. And I was so shocked.
[1:45:46] I thought maybe uh they turn it into a a
[1:45:50] video hall.
[1:45:56] Then I came to
[1:45:58] realize uh that they were they had put I
[1:46:01] think the movie called Passion of
[1:46:06] Christ. Praise be to
[1:46:09] God. But I thank God
[1:46:11] that we know much better than
[1:46:15] that. Praise be to
[1:46:17] God. Amen. And people were holding on
[1:46:20] their
[1:46:22] cheek. Others were even
[1:46:25] crying. They beating
[1:46:27] him. God does not want us sympathize
[1:46:30] with him.
[1:46:34] Amen. Praise be to God. He never sent us
[1:46:38] to play those
[1:46:41] movies on Good
[1:46:43] Friday. But he told us to go and preach
[1:46:46] the gospel.
[1:46:49] guide therefore into the
[1:46:51] world preach the gospel. Whosoever
[1:46:54] believes and
[1:46:56] baptiz shall be
[1:46:59] saved.
[1:47:00] Amen. And this
[1:47:02] morning I want to talk about
[1:47:07] resurrection. Blessed be the name of the
[1:47:09] Lord. Thousands and millions of
[1:47:14] sermon have been preached about
[1:47:16] resurrection.
[1:47:18] And you know in such a day there are
[1:47:21] many things which comes in our
[1:47:24] mind. Praise be to God. The brother
[1:47:27] preached many
[1:47:29] sermons on this day like the Easter
[1:47:33] Seals the resurrection of
[1:47:36] Jesus among others. Blessed be the name
[1:47:39] of the Lord. But if you go reading
[1:47:41] through those
[1:47:43] messages it's like you speak about one
[1:47:45] thing.
[1:47:48] Amen. Praise the Lord. Talk of the
[1:47:51] mighty
[1:47:54] conqueror. Praise be to
[1:47:56] God. Amen. But say that resurrection
[1:48:03] uh you see that resurrection
[1:48:06] means to bring you back to what you
[1:48:09] were.
[1:48:14] When Jesus resurrected from the
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:18] dead, he did not become another human
[1:48:22] being, but was the same
[1:48:26] Jesus
[1:48:27] in in another
[1:48:30] form or in a real real
[1:48:35] form because remember where Jesus
[1:48:38] came. Jesus was the temple where God
[1:48:42] dwelt.
[1:48:44] and to cover the sins of the
[1:48:47] world. Amen. Remember the Bible tells us
[1:48:50] in John
[1:48:53] 4:24 that God is a
[1:48:55] spirit.
[1:48:59] Amen. God is a
[1:49:01] what? But when man
[1:49:03] sinned, we needed a kinsman's redeemer.
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] So that God put on
[1:49:11] flesh came and dwelt among
[1:49:14] us. The only we could pay for our
[1:49:17] sins was through him putting on flesh.
[1:49:22] Blessed be the name of the
[1:49:24] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:32] So
[1:49:33] Jesus carried our sins upon him.
[1:49:40] And he was rejected by
[1:49:43] God. And even the world itself rejected.
[1:49:47] And he was in he was crucified in
[1:49:49] between
[1:49:52] uh in between the heavens and the
[1:49:58] earth. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:50:01] And that's why you are seated here this
[1:50:04] morning because that's where our hope
[1:50:08] lies. If Jesus was not
[1:50:12] resurrected, ah that would be bad
[1:50:14] news. We not be here
[1:50:17] today. But when Jesus rose from the
[1:50:20] dead, he told them one time destroy this
[1:50:24] temple just in three days. I will bring
[1:50:28] it up again.
[1:50:30] And here.
[1:50:32] Amen. And today it was like
[1:50:36] today when Jesus proved that.
[1:50:42] Amen.
[1:50:44] Blessed be the name of the
[1:50:46] Lord. That Jesus was
[1:50:49] killed. He died on Good
[1:50:51] Friday. He was
[1:50:54] Saturday and on Sunday
[1:50:57] morning. Hallelujah. We are seeing these
[1:51:01] ladies
[1:51:03] Mary. They went to the tomb and when
[1:51:06] they reached there they found a young
[1:51:09] man. Amen. Seated on the
[1:51:14] tomb on that stone. The stone was rolled
[1:51:18] away and they asked
[1:51:21] him. No, he rather told
[1:51:24] them what they are do what they are
[1:51:26] seeking. He's not here. He said, "The
[1:51:30] Lord is
[1:51:33] risen." Praise be to God. And I'm here
[1:51:36] this morning to tell you that the Lord
[1:51:38] is
[1:51:40] risen. And that
[1:51:43] Jesus is not in heaven. He's dwelling in
[1:51:46] our hearts
[1:51:48] tonight because that's where God want to
[1:51:53] be. Blessed be the name of the
[1:51:56] Lord. One time David wanted to build uh
[1:51:59] God a
[1:52:01] house and the Lord told him, "Praise be
[1:52:05] to God." The Lord told him, "Heaven is
[1:52:08] my
[1:52:09] foottool, heaven is my
[1:52:11] throne and the earth is my
[1:52:14] foottool, which house will you build?"
[1:52:19] But thanks be to God, that same God
[1:52:23] whose earth is
[1:52:25] bestowed and heaven is strong.
[1:52:29] Amen. He has
[1:52:31] decided to dwell in our
[1:52:35] hearts. Amen. Oh, how mysterious is the
[1:52:38] heart of
[1:52:40] man that great
[1:52:43] God will come and dwell in our
[1:52:46] soul. Praise be to God.
[1:52:50] Amen. Amen. Resurrection means bring you
[1:52:54] back to what you are or what you was at
[1:53:01] birth. What was at
[1:53:05] birth? Not this physical
[1:53:08] birth, but there's what we were before
[1:53:10] the foundation of the world.
[1:53:14] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:53:17] that's why Jesus said,
[1:53:20] you must be born
[1:53:22] again because you bypassed your
[1:53:27] birth. And through new
[1:53:29] birth, we are restored
[1:53:32] back to the original
[1:53:35] birth. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:53:40] says that what is it? There's been a
[1:53:44] sentence
[1:53:47] claim and Easter
[1:53:50] claim the flower
[1:53:52] claims. It has a right to rise
[1:53:57] again. And God's law of nature pulls the
[1:54:01] earth around and make that law of God.
[1:54:09] in nature bring forth an
[1:54:14] Easter
[1:54:15] resurrection. It is
[1:54:18] beautifully. It's
[1:54:21] beautifully the return of the
[1:54:24] sun to restore what winter
[1:54:31] killed. what it was from. Oh, sorry.
[1:54:35] While it was from the
[1:54:38] earth, blessed be the name of God. That
[1:54:41] is the message, the resurrection of the
[1:54:45] bridegroom that during the
[1:54:48] winter. We know that uh trees will shed
[1:54:52] off their
[1:54:54] leaves because it's approaching winter
[1:54:58] time. The life will go back to the root.
[1:55:02] Blessed be the name of the Lord and that
[1:55:05] tree will
[1:55:07] die. But after the winter,
[1:55:13] Amen. praise be to
[1:55:16] God. During the spring time,
[1:55:20] now that tree will grow back
[1:55:25] again. Blessed be the name of God. You
[1:55:28] see, nature teaches us
[1:55:32] But say that when you look at the
[1:55:35] tree, the way the tree is
[1:55:38] toiling, the tree we are seeing
[1:55:41] today is the
[1:55:43] negative of the original
[1:55:48] tree. Amen. Do you know that there is a
[1:55:52] land whose tree does not shed in his
[1:55:56] leaves? There is a line where there is
[1:55:59] no
[1:56:00] son. It is son is the son of
[1:56:04] God. Praise be to God. And that is the
[1:56:07] land we are longing for. That is the
[1:56:12] city praying for. The Bible tells us
[1:56:16] that
[1:56:17] Abraham, Amen, the
[1:56:20] Bracks, they moved. They lived in ships
[1:56:24] came in the desert looking for a
[1:56:28] city builder and maker was God
[1:56:34] himself. Amen. Amen. When God called
[1:56:37] Abraham and gave a promise, a promise of
[1:56:41] of a promised
[1:56:42] land, praise be to God, inside Abraham,
[1:56:47] there was something
[1:56:50] longing. Amen. And that's why the Bible
[1:56:53] say they lived in sheep
[1:56:56] skin. They never mind about themselves.
[1:57:01] about that
[1:57:02] city whose
[1:57:04] builder and maker is
[1:57:07] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:57:10] And here comes the Lord
[1:57:12] Jesus. And he says, I am the way. I am
[1:57:17] the truth and the life. Nobody goes the
[1:57:21] father but by
[1:57:24] me. Praise be to God. When Jesus went to
[1:57:28] the grave,
[1:57:30] and rose
[1:57:31] again. When Jesus comes and preach
[1:57:35] resurrection there we know it is a sure
[1:57:39] deal he has
[1:57:41] tested he has shown us even when we
[1:57:45] die we shall rise
[1:57:48] again. Amen. Amen. And we are believers
[1:57:51] of
[1:57:53] resurrection. We are the candidates of
[1:57:56] resurrection because our
[1:57:59] Jesus died and rose again. Blessed be
[1:58:04] the name
[1:58:05] of amen. We have a better
[1:58:09] hope. Even that's why even when we are
[1:58:13] sick we pray and quote God in this word.
[1:58:18] what you say by your strength. I
[1:58:22] am and we believe in the word and I
[1:58:26] profess it. We walk by it. Our body
[1:58:31] respond because inside us we have a law
[1:58:35] of
[1:58:37] resurrection. Yes sir. Praise be to God.
[1:58:42] God has put that law in
[1:58:43] us. The law which defy the gravity
[1:58:51] Praise be to
[1:58:52] God.
[1:58:54] Amen. I read somewhere the prophet
[1:58:57] say that when God heals you from a
[1:59:00] certain
[1:59:02] disease, you cannot die of that same
[1:59:04] disease
[1:59:06] again. That is our God. You cannot be
[1:59:10] healed of
[1:59:11] cancer. And you believe God and God
[1:59:14] heals of cancer.
[1:59:19] That can
[1:59:20] happen. Praise be to God. The God we are
[1:59:24] serving. My my
[1:59:26] my praise be to
[1:59:29] God. Talk of that great
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:33] warrior. If you can just
[1:59:37] believe, if you can just look
[1:59:40] back, we are not here to
[1:59:43] sympathize. Start crying.
[1:59:47] He died.
[1:59:50] He even prayed and cried.
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:54] Do you know why he
[1:59:58] cried? Do you know why he
[2:00:00] cried? Let me tell you why Jesus
[2:00:03] cried. Praise be to God. When Jesus
[2:00:06] prayed in God's
[2:00:07] name until his sweat turn into
[2:00:11] blood and say,
[2:00:13] "Father, if it is possible,
[2:00:16] pass this cup away from
[2:00:19] me. It was
[2:00:23] in pain.
[2:00:25] You know why he cried? When he looked
[2:00:29] back and looked
[2:00:32] inongo and saw brother
[2:00:35] Matthew they struggling with
[2:00:38] sin struggling to do life and when he
[2:00:41] look back before the foundation of the
[2:00:43] world.
[2:00:45] Amen. Anywhere in the in the lamb's book
[2:00:48] of
[2:00:49] life, he realized my name
[2:00:52] was praise be to God. Amen. He was in
[2:00:56] between that
[2:00:58] decision either he he quit the
[2:01:01] cross or he take the but when he looked
[2:01:05] at
[2:01:06] you how you are struggling down there
[2:01:10] and saw where you
[2:01:11] are you are with him.
[2:01:15] of the
[2:01:16] world.
[2:01:18] Father will be
[2:01:21] done. Praise be to God. You are the will
[2:01:24] of
[2:01:28] God. Your will
[2:01:31] be the will of
[2:01:39] God. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. Is
[2:01:44] for us to be restored back.
[2:01:47] God is happy to see
[2:01:49] us. We are like Adam.
[2:01:52] Remember when God
[2:01:54] created creation, he never named
[2:01:58] them. We know their
[2:02:00] name. Praise be to God. But God had
[2:02:05] adopted who was just like him. Praise be
[2:02:09] to God. I believe before
[2:02:12] Adam before
[2:02:14] Adam looked at
[2:02:16] Adam's nose was like God's
[2:02:19] nose
[2:02:22] was
[2:02:25] his praise be to God and maybe that day
[2:02:30] he came with a
[2:02:32] challenge they said what are you seeing
[2:02:35] here I'm seeing the beauty of your
[2:02:38] creation what we little
[2:02:40] today I'm going to give you a task you
[2:02:44] are going to give them
[2:02:46] names he said glory glory
[2:02:50] hallelujah amen maybe Adam before that
[2:02:54] time the lion moving and he saw the way
[2:02:58] it is the
[2:03:02] way he was waiting for the right time
[2:03:05] and when that right time came
[2:03:09] What is that? You say that
[2:03:12] word. Hallelujah. Amen. That will be
[2:03:15] called a
[2:03:16] lion said, "Amen."
[2:03:20] Hallelujah. Praise be to God.
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:26] Elephant. This is not a
[2:03:29] cow. Still huge with a
[2:03:33] trunk with a big
[2:03:36] ears. You be called
[2:03:39] elephant and it was
[2:03:41] perfect. Try to call cow elephant and
[2:03:45] see there's not even
[2:03:48] much. Praise be to God. So we're in the
[2:03:51] mind of
[2:03:52] God before the foundation of the world
[2:03:56] and we found ourselves chained in
[2:03:58] sin and we had no way out.
[2:04:03] from the
[2:04:05] prophets. They hold them in
[2:04:09] prison. Hallelujah. Amen. We needed a
[2:04:13] redeemer. We needed a
[2:04:16] savior. We need a champion of the
[2:04:19] champion.
[2:04:21] Hallelujah. They search through the
[2:04:23] earth. There was not even
[2:04:27] one. that Adam
[2:04:30] fertain
[2:04:31] point Adam had to
[2:04:34] fail. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise be to
[2:04:40] God. Talk of the
[2:04:43] prophets. Amen. Even the prophets they
[2:04:48] fa.
[2:04:50] Amen. There are giants on
[2:04:54] earth. God never picked one.
[2:04:58] God had his
[2:05:00] giant and that giant called the
[2:05:03] lamb. He's the lion of the tribe
[2:05:05] of the pillar of
[2:05:08] fire and the morning
[2:05:10] star of the
[2:05:13] valley. Hallelujah. He was wrapped with
[2:05:19] everything. Amen. Amen. And when he was
[2:05:23] called out,
[2:05:25] it was the perfect match.
[2:05:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:05:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:37] Let the devil not
[2:05:39] lie. Yesterday uh one preacher was
[2:05:43] telling us how stinking the devil
[2:05:50] is. I I I felt the guy
[2:05:56] smelling but sometime is
[2:05:58] so really so
[2:06:01] hurting to see a
[2:06:04] believer in church like this in a
[2:06:08] service like this is if you know that
[2:06:11] the devil is smelling near brother or
[2:06:17] sister. You see that person ate that
[2:06:20] person.
[2:06:24] Oh, it's on WhatsApp.
[2:06:30] WhatsApp. So, you better
[2:06:37] wash. Praise be to
[2:06:39] God. Amen.
[2:06:42] Where we are right now, the devil has no
[2:06:46] right because we are having
[2:06:49] [Music]
[2:06:50] delegates. Amen. And God is speaking to
[2:06:55] us right now. He's giving assignment.
[2:06:59] He's something to
[2:07:01] accept. He's imunizing the
[2:07:04] sick. He's setting the captive
[2:07:07] free. You can already believe. I'm here
[2:07:11] just to remind
[2:07:12] you of this in your
[2:07:15] mind.
[2:07:17] Jesus all your
[2:07:22] sin is no longer stressing
[2:07:25] us. Amen. Amen. Are you battling with
[2:07:30] sin? Are you troubled by
[2:07:33] demons? I'm here to tell
[2:07:35] you I have a prescription for
[2:07:39] you. Amen.
[2:07:42] Amen. Amen. I have a prescription this
[2:07:46] morning.
[2:07:49] Jesus was on us.
[2:07:52] He was still he was he was carrying the
[2:07:57] test. Praise be to God. Amen. He was in
[2:08:01] his
[2:08:02] lab. He was carrying different test in
[2:08:05] the lab.
[2:08:09] How does hunger
[2:08:11] come? Really, you can get hungry. Praise
[2:08:14] be to God. Until one day, the devil saw
[2:08:18] Jesus was
[2:08:19] hungry. You know, hungry man cannot
[2:08:23] hide. Even if he use a bucket of
[2:08:26] Vaseline, you will look
[2:08:32] pale. Even when he's
[2:08:34] talking, it's like the breath is coming
[2:08:36] from the legs.
[2:08:40] God bless
[2:08:42] you. Brother, are you
[2:08:44] sick? I'll be
[2:08:49] fine. So the devil knew
[2:08:51] that. He came to
[2:08:54] Jesus. Say if you're the son of
[2:08:57] God, turn the stone into
[2:09:02] bread. You see that is the same mistake
[2:09:05] that ever even is doing today.
[2:09:08] The devil has no
[2:09:11] mandate to tell you if you are son of
[2:09:14] God. You mean you don't know your
[2:09:17] father. Brother Julius, you know your
[2:09:21] dad. It's like going and tell Joseph my
[2:09:25] son that if you are the son of your dad,
[2:09:29] you go and ask him for for ice
[2:09:31] cream. He will not even come and I say,
[2:09:34] "Daddy, daddy, I want ice cream. ice
[2:09:36] cream. Okay, let's go.
[2:09:39] Let's But because the devil is a doubter
[2:09:42] from the
[2:09:44] beginning, every time he come with if
[2:09:49] if he's not
[2:09:51] sure our God predestinated
[2:09:56] us before the foundation of the world,
[2:09:59] he tried all the
[2:10:02] test. He tried each and everything.
[2:10:06] before the foundation of the world. But
[2:10:09] the devil's
[2:10:10] stuff is not tried at
[2:10:16] all. Is a quack
[2:10:20] professor. Even simple
[2:10:23] formula is not
[2:10:25] sure. When you tell him 1 plus
[2:10:28] one, this can't be two.
[2:10:32] are mature enough to ask me
[2:10:35] that. Okay, let me just put
[2:10:39] 2211. Praise be to
[2:10:42] God. But when faith comes to my brother
[2:10:45] Julian and tells my brother
[2:10:48] here one, he will stand
[2:10:52] by. That's why the Bible
[2:10:55] says this
[2:10:57] gospel is it looks like a foolishness to
[2:11:00] the
[2:11:01] world to them that
[2:11:04] perish. How can you tell
[2:11:06] them that they just come and lay hands
[2:11:09] on
[2:11:10] you and then cancer is gone, TB is
[2:11:14] gone, is gone. That cannot
[2:11:20] happen. Praise be to God. Even when that
[2:11:23] miracle
[2:11:25] happens, the devil will still overload
[2:11:28] his guys in his
[2:11:34] lap. It is
[2:11:37] impossible impossible. Praise be to God.
[2:11:41] But when God
[2:11:42] comes, Hallelujah. Amen. He told
[2:11:46] Jeremiah before you were forming your
[2:11:48] mother's womb, I knew you. I your
[2:11:53] prophets.
[2:11:55] Amen. Before we came on this world, God
[2:11:58] renew us. He knows how many steps you're
[2:12:01] going to
[2:12:02] take until the
[2:12:05] rapture. Not until the grave, until the
[2:12:10] rapture. Because this
[2:12:12] generation that has seen the Jews back
[2:12:14] their
[2:12:16] homeland, it will not pass
[2:12:18] away. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:22] Praise be to God. So when you are
[2:12:24] hungry, Jesus knows what hunger
[2:12:28] means. Yes sir. One time certain lady
[2:12:32] saw
[2:12:33] Jesus. They say blessed are the blessed
[2:12:36] are the breast which thou
[2:12:39] s. Then I tried to look around
[2:12:43] there where the sermon had anything to
[2:12:46] do with a
[2:12:48] breast. the same devil.
[2:12:52] Praise be to God. Hallelujah. Amen. So
[2:12:57] Jesus tells us he passed through all the
[2:13:03] test. He was tested with
[2:13:06] women with
[2:13:08] anger with
[2:13:10] strictness because he was totally human.
[2:13:13] He was 100% man and 100% God.
[2:13:19] Yes sir. That's why the devil cannot
[2:13:22] understand the
[2:13:23] logic. How can you become a saint? How
[2:13:27] can you be a child of
[2:13:33] God? How can Jesus be a
[2:13:36] God? And at the same
[2:13:39] time, 100%
[2:13:41] God, 100%
[2:13:44] man. How can you be saint?
[2:13:49] 100%
[2:13:51] sinner, 100%
[2:13:57] sane. He doesn't understand that. And
[2:13:59] thanks be to God, he will never
[2:14:01] understand
[2:14:03] that until
[2:14:05] rapture. Praise be to God. And when the
[2:14:08] rapture will take place, the devil will
[2:14:11] be
[2:14:12] surprised. I thought this brother was
[2:14:14] not
[2:14:15] going. He will look for you. He will not
[2:14:19] find you anywhere because the grace of
[2:14:22] God for
[2:14:24] you. Hallelujah. Amen. He predestinated
[2:14:28] us
[2:14:29] before. He made the conclusion from the
[2:14:35] end. God already made a
[2:14:41] conclusion. the name of the Lord. So
[2:14:43] this
[2:14:45] resurrection is restore us back to what
[2:14:48] we were before birth.
[2:14:52] Amen. Praise be to God. That's why the
[2:14:56] Bible say those who have believed in
[2:14:58] him. He has given you power to become
[2:15:02] sons and daughters of
[2:15:06] God. Amen. And when you read these
[2:15:09] things, you realize it's us who are
[2:15:12] letting the
[2:15:14] devil plays with your
[2:15:18] feelings. One time I preached a sermon
[2:15:20] here. And I told you that Christian, we
[2:15:23] don't rely on our
[2:15:27] feelings. Amen. No
[2:15:30] sir.
[2:15:32] Amen. But we lie on
[2:15:36] faith. As long as faith is
[2:15:39] there, the anchor
[2:15:41] hold and that ship cannot
[2:15:45] move. The ship is
[2:15:47] battered. Faith holds on the
[2:15:52] word. Amen. Amen. Yes
[2:15:56] sir. Without faith is impossible to
[2:15:59] believe. Praise God.
[2:16:04] That's why even get me the get me the
[2:16:06] saintest person
[2:16:10] here. Let him start to to confess. I'm a
[2:16:14] sinner. I'm a thief. I'm a
[2:16:18] fornicator. I'm a
[2:16:21] robber. A week will not
[2:16:23] end. You find him in
[2:16:27] prison because that's what you are
[2:16:28] confessing.
[2:16:31] But let us confess
[2:16:34] positive. Amen. We are
[2:16:40] eag. And in the eyes of the
[2:16:43] storm, that's why the eagle
[2:16:46] pass through that
[2:16:49] storm. There's calmness behind the
[2:16:53] storm. Yes,
[2:16:56] sir. Don't allow the devil to play with
[2:16:59] your feelings.
[2:17:02] We are fighting with the devil every
[2:17:05] day. Brother been fighting him for I
[2:17:08] don't know for how many years
[2:17:11] now? 40
[2:17:13] years is fighting the
[2:17:16] devil. The devil is not ready to give
[2:17:20] up. Amen. Know your
[2:17:23] opponent. Know how he
[2:17:26] operates. Know how he works.
[2:17:29] Be aware of his of his
[2:17:33] leaks. Yes, sir.
[2:17:36] Jesus showed us the devil's.
[2:17:42] Praise be to God.
[2:17:44] Hallelujah.
[2:17:46] Amen. And that's why he came from the
[2:17:49] grave. He came out of the
[2:17:51] grave. And he not just stopped there.
[2:17:56] It was never for him to go
[2:17:59] there. And when he went
[2:18:02] there in the corridors of
[2:18:05] hell before those chain
[2:18:10] saints say that
[2:18:13] maybe saw
[2:18:15] him
[2:18:18] say this is the one who visited us. He's
[2:18:21] the one who gave us the
[2:18:23] promise. Blessed be the name of the
[2:18:25] Lord.
[2:18:26] and say may
[2:18:27] be also saw him. This is the ash of
[2:18:31] days. The one I saw in the wills of the
[2:18:35] wind. Praise be to God. The Bible say
[2:18:39] when we see
[2:18:41] him shall know him.
[2:18:44] Amen.
[2:18:45] Yes. Have you ever seen
[2:18:50] Jesus? No.
[2:18:53] I have seen his
[2:18:55] children.
[2:18:58] Yes. Praise be to God. When we look at
[2:19:02] their
[2:19:03] character, the way they love one
[2:19:05] another, the way they love God, the way
[2:19:09] they share one another, the way they are
[2:19:12] in the
[2:19:13] world, the way they live with one
[2:19:16] another, they
[2:19:19] associate when Jesus will
[2:19:22] appear. You will look at that from
[2:19:26] Jesus and you will
[2:19:29] know. Pastor to tell
[2:19:33] you Jesus.
[2:19:36] Hallelujah. Amen. Because you already
[2:19:38] have a portion of Jesus in
[2:19:42] you. That
[2:19:45] magnet, the small magnet in your soul,
[2:19:49] the seed of God in your
[2:19:50] soul, chaos in your soul. When the
[2:19:54] bigger one will
[2:19:56] come. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:19:59] Amen. Yes sir. This magnet is a special
[2:20:03] one. Is a spiritual
[2:20:06] magnet because when will
[2:20:09] appear the dead in Christ will
[2:20:13] rise. Hallelujah. Amen. Talk about those
[2:20:18] graves
[2:20:22] with Amen. My God. My God.
[2:20:27] They dig there. They will dig the the
[2:20:33] soil. After
[2:20:35] digging, they put your coffin
[2:20:38] there. They
[2:20:41] put Amen. They put Have you seen where
[2:20:45] they burning
[2:20:46] someone? They even put iron
[2:20:49] sheet. Then they bring
[2:20:51] water. way back to
[2:20:57] there. Praise be to
[2:20:59] God. And if I was a
[2:21:01] Catholic and I paid for for my and my
[2:21:06] people pay for my
[2:21:10] purgatory, I would come and strike
[2:21:13] back. Look at how you treating
[2:21:16] me. And yet you even bribe the
[2:21:20] priest. That's being
[2:21:23] unfair. Please, my people have bribed
[2:21:26] the what? They have paid the
[2:21:29] money. Treat this body with
[2:21:33] care. At least bury me with
[2:21:36] money, some nice
[2:21:39] mattress, some
[2:21:40] fumes. Put a
[2:21:43] glass. Put some nice light.
[2:21:50] say that when Jesus
[2:21:53] comes it will not take it not be hard
[2:21:56] for
[2:21:57] him he will also look at the way the
[2:22:02] things praise be to
[2:22:04] God but that
[2:22:07] God when he
[2:22:09] comes after putting the
[2:22:12] cement others they
[2:22:17] put amen but when the trouble of
[2:22:21] God. The Bible tells us the very
[2:22:28] Christ shall
[2:22:30] rise. Amen. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:35] Grace will be bursting like
[2:22:38] popcorns. Blessed be the name of the
[2:22:40] Lord.
[2:22:42] Amen. Yes, sir. That same
[2:22:46] earthquake which took place where Jesus
[2:22:48] gave up the
[2:22:50] ghost. That same earthquake
[2:22:53] will again
[2:22:56] thunder when Jesus
[2:22:59] comes one day the children of Israel
[2:23:02] told him they called Moses we want to
[2:23:06] see that
[2:23:07] God of you going there to talk to him
[2:23:10] this time around. We want to see that
[2:23:12] God.
[2:23:14] And Moses told them, "Prepare
[2:23:16] yourself." Oh yes. If you want to see
[2:23:18] him, he's going to
[2:23:20] come. Amen. I mean, they were there
[2:23:24] busy, rejoicing,
[2:23:26] waiting, God is coming. Hallelujah.
[2:23:29] Glory be to God. Today we are going to
[2:23:32] see that he has noted us what he did for
[2:23:36] us. How dare him before the red
[2:23:40] sea? What if the water had failed to
[2:23:44] separate? So let him
[2:23:48] come. He's going to
[2:23:52] explain. And again when we ask for
[2:23:55] quails, he gave us a
[2:23:57] lot and even wanted us maybe to commit
[2:24:01] sin. They were there
[2:24:04] waiting. Amen.
[2:24:08] When they are still
[2:24:09] waiting, they are
[2:24:12] thundering
[2:24:14] flashing. And maybe to Moses, what is
[2:24:18] going on? As you wanted to talk to him,
[2:24:21] let him go back. We no longer
[2:24:25] want. Praise be to God. When God comes
[2:24:28] in our
[2:24:30] life, there's still nothing that can
[2:24:32] hold us.
[2:24:35] Yes. Yes. Sometime we sing my chains are
[2:24:39] gone and yet we allow oursel to be in
[2:24:44] shame. My chains are
[2:24:48] gone. And some deacons sometimes even
[2:24:51] want maybe to give you
[2:25:01] water and even the song leader will
[2:25:03] wonder.
[2:25:08] Brother, I have a project in Buuku.
[2:25:13] The other
[2:25:14] day that friend of mine
[2:25:19] is raring Fian
[2:25:21] [Music]
[2:25:23] cows and they're in the
[2:25:27] house that day on
[2:25:31] Friday. So they wanted to slash outside
[2:25:34] the
[2:25:35] gate. They have some bigger land outside
[2:25:38] the
[2:25:39] gate and they said before we bring the
[2:25:42] slasher
[2:25:43] man this animal to go and feed on the
[2:25:46] fresh
[2:25:48] ground. Praise be to
[2:25:50] God. Hallelujah. Amen. That day I saw
[2:25:55] what freedom
[2:25:57] means. My good Lord.
[2:26:00] Amen.
[2:26:04] These are not
[2:26:05] [Music]
[2:26:07] calant cows.
[2:26:10] The moment they open the
[2:26:12] gate within the coat just the they
[2:26:15] remove those stick which
[2:26:19] she
[2:26:21] amen. The thing
[2:26:24] jumped. I nearly say that some assaulted
[2:26:26] like 100
[2:26:29] times. It jumped and ran going to knock
[2:26:34] the
[2:26:35] wall. Two double
[2:26:38] kick and
[2:26:41] more brother. I saw
[2:26:45] revival. Praise be to God. I saw what
[2:26:57] libert and I was like what is
[2:27:02] Praise be to God. When your chain is
[2:27:05] gone, brother, let your chain
[2:27:09] go. Be a free
[2:27:11] person. Let your devil know you are
[2:27:14] free. Let your know that you are
[2:27:18] free. There is something about liberty.
[2:27:22] If your animal can recognize their
[2:27:25] liberty, oh God, when I looked at that,
[2:27:30] I remembered way back when I was still
[2:27:32] in
[2:27:34] sin. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And when
[2:27:37] Jesus came to
[2:27:39] me, I realized I did not express enough
[2:27:42] joy.
[2:27:45] And what I
[2:27:46] did, I start I joined the
[2:27:49] party. I said,
[2:27:51] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise the
[2:27:54] Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:27:56] And then my friends, what's going on? I
[2:27:59] told them I I feel like preaching you
[2:28:01] are someone
[2:28:02] here. Hallelujah. I was
[2:28:06] charged. And when they opened those
[2:28:09] animals and they went outside the gate,
[2:28:12] my brother, 30 minutes of revival,
[2:28:17] praising and worshiping, dancing and
[2:28:20] singing,
[2:28:25] Praise be to God.
[2:28:28] Amen. Amen. When God sets you
[2:28:32] free, that is not
[2:28:34] enough. Amen. Amen. Because you have
[2:28:37] been in
[2:28:38] shame. For a long time, for many years,
[2:28:42] for many months. Hallelujah. Amen. But
[2:28:45] when Jesus
[2:28:47] comes, probably you are healed.
[2:28:50] Don't stop
[2:28:51] there. When they get called beautiful
[2:28:55] when he was healed, he never stopped
[2:28:59] there. This man came to him.
[2:29:02] Yes. Oh,
[2:29:04] very like me and brother. So you want to
[2:29:08] be brother Peter? Brother John. Brother
[2:29:10] John. Okay. So I'm brother Peter.
[2:29:12] Brother Peter. So you're coming. Young
[2:29:15] man come. My brother come. Praise be to
[2:29:17] God. Say this was the man at the gate of
[2:29:19] beauty.
[2:29:22] Yes. Say the
[2:29:27] Yes, my brother.
[2:29:30] Peter and John, the Bible says when they
[2:29:32] saw when they saw them coming,
[2:29:40] Uhhuh. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:29:43] Say, please give us
[2:29:45] something. You have forgotten that. give
[2:29:47] us something.
[2:29:49] Amen. When he looked at the suit,
[2:29:53] I just knew this
[2:29:55] guy
[2:29:58] loaded this one
[2:30:06] $50. I have them now say yes my
[2:30:10] brother was expecting. So maybe the man
[2:30:14] first sold the pocket is coming silver
[2:30:17] and
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:21] gold but what I
[2:30:24] have they have something
[2:30:27] else is what we give
[2:30:30] you. Arise and walk in his
[2:30:34] name. Amen. Amen. And the man, the Bible
[2:30:37] says in this
[2:30:39] first and then finally he went to the
[2:30:42] temple
[2:30:48] leaping because the near not gain
[2:30:52] enough but there is something
[2:30:55] there where he was healed
[2:30:59] from those were the leaks of the
[2:31:03] fire. So these guys
[2:31:06] They had to take the
[2:31:08] guy to where the real fire is.
[2:31:12] Hallelujah. Amen. So he came leaping.
[2:31:17] Amen. Amen. As he went on
[2:31:20] leaping the anchor
[2:31:24] hold that shine for the rest the whole
[2:31:27] of his
[2:31:28] life he had never experienced
[2:31:31] that. I believe that guy even if he had
[2:31:34] remained
[2:31:36] limping, he would have taken that as
[2:31:40] healing because he had never seen
[2:31:42] that. But our God, he does not give her
[2:31:48] redemption. He pays a full
[2:31:51] price. He does not give us a
[2:31:54] hope.
[2:31:56] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. I am here to
[2:31:59] inform you this
[2:32:00] morning Jesus has a check for
[2:32:03] you and that check is written the Lord
[2:32:07] Jesus
[2:32:09] Christ your check this
[2:32:13] afternoon brother
[2:32:15] check it may take
[2:32:18] days may take weeks may take years but
[2:32:23] one thing I know she is going to get
[2:32:26] mature one of his days. Hallelujah.
[2:32:30] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. There was a widow
[2:32:36] of Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:32:40] She went to ATM machine. Glory be to
[2:32:42] God.
[2:32:45] And when she checked their
[2:32:47] balance, she
[2:32:49] realized she had a meal for a
[2:32:52] day. She only had
[2:32:55] 2K in her account. And she was
[2:33:00] worried. And I believe that lady, she
[2:33:03] feared God. She loved the God in her
[2:33:06] heart. She know that there is a God in
[2:33:08] there, the God of Israel.
[2:33:12] He's the husband of the widow. He's the
[2:33:15] father of the
[2:33:17] fatherless.
[2:33:19] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Maybe that
[2:33:23] morning. She read a
[2:33:25] scroll. He is the husband of the
[2:33:30] widow. It is the father of the
[2:33:33] fatherless. She is a
[2:33:35] widow. Here is an
[2:33:37] offer a
[2:33:40] grandchild. Praise be to God. That very
[2:33:44] day, Elijah was also moving. He went to
[2:33:49] check whether the raven had brought the
[2:33:51] food in the
[2:33:52] house. He realized the brook dried last
[2:33:59] night and the raven never reported for
[2:34:03] duty. Praise be to God.
[2:34:06] And the man of God was standing in his
[2:34:09] bed. I think he said the Lord is my
[2:34:12] shepherd. I shall
[2:34:15] not shall supply my
[2:34:18] needs in
[2:34:20] glory when he was still there. The Lord
[2:34:24] spoke to him and told him, I have
[2:34:28] prepared
[2:34:30] a
[2:34:32] hallelujah. I prepared a food for
[2:34:34] himself.
[2:34:37] The lady checked her
[2:34:38] account. The account was empty. Nearly
[2:34:42] empty. The man of God
[2:34:44] came. He want to take the
[2:34:47] 2K. So many serving. Blessed be the name
[2:34:51] of the Lord.
[2:34:53] Hallelujah. But I believe she had
[2:34:56] prayed. Adam say that after you have
[2:34:59] prayed when you maybe from pray
[2:35:03] fasting things might become more
[2:35:06] tougher brother hold on be certain of
[2:35:11] God something happening in the
[2:35:14] background are knocking one
[2:35:17] another God what can we do
[2:35:22] hallelujah was
[2:35:24] on the bride himself
[2:35:27] Hallelujah. Amen. There's a preacher
[2:35:29] called Bill
[2:35:31] Sunday. They say that that day on every
[2:35:35] tree there were legion of angels
[2:35:42] every just we
[2:35:48] go. If we know our
[2:35:51] value, if we know what we
[2:35:53] are, if we know our
[2:35:56] worthiness, Amen. Those angels I
[2:36:01] believe they were
[2:36:07] saying and the whole thing
[2:36:10] is they knew what they
[2:36:13] are. They knew what they
[2:36:16] possess. They knew what it means to
[2:36:18] serve
[2:36:20] God. Surrender to God. The Bible tells
[2:36:24] us. Submit yourself to
[2:36:26] God. Amen. greatly get near to him, he
[2:36:31] will also draw nearer to you. After you
[2:36:34] have done
[2:36:35] that, you know what? Resist the devil.
[2:36:41] Amen. Amen. First join this
[2:36:44] link. This is God. This is
[2:36:47] me. To me, I near to you. Let us resist
[2:36:52] the devil. The devil cannot hit
[2:36:55] us. Amen. And when we know what we
[2:36:58] believe, when we know our authority that
[2:37:02] we are the children of God, the devil
[2:37:04] cannot defy
[2:37:07] us.
[2:37:09] Say that woman came before
[2:37:13] God and show
[2:37:15] them. God said
[2:37:24] no. Yes.
[2:37:34] because I'm going through something you
[2:37:36] have never
[2:37:38] seen. Praise be to
[2:37:40] God. God is only God who is not taken by
[2:37:47] surprise because he knows everything.
[2:37:50] Sometime believers we go through things
[2:37:54] and we think God does not know it. God
[2:37:57] knows you. Brother, sister, there's no
[2:38:01] scientist who knows the numbers of your
[2:38:06] head. God, he knows them one by
[2:38:10] one. Amen. Amen. The Bible say God call
[2:38:14] those stars by their
[2:38:17] name. Every star
[2:38:20] has a name. Every messenger, every
[2:38:24] church had a
[2:38:26] messenger had a star. And out of that
[2:38:29] star, every star had a name. When you
[2:38:34] were born, your star was put in the
[2:38:38] galaxy. Amen. It started to give
[2:38:42] life. and the star. It will only go off
[2:38:48] the day you have gone to rest as long as
[2:38:51] you are still alive and you're waiting
[2:38:53] for the
[2:38:54] rapture will always be
[2:38:59] there. Where were you when the sons of
[2:39:03] God
[2:39:05] shouted, "Hallelujah." Amen.
[2:39:08] Praise be to God. After the widow
[2:39:13] prayed, the man
[2:39:16] came. He came on the same
[2:39:20] angle. I'm so
[2:39:23] hungry. But I believe she never said but
[2:39:26] we just say that we just have a
[2:39:28] little bring me that one. Bring me
[2:39:33] that. Praise be to God. God always
[2:39:36] allows that moment of silence.
[2:39:41] to see how are you going to
[2:39:44] behave. The Bible say he made them to
[2:39:47] one in the
[2:39:48] wilderness because he wanted to know
[2:39:50] what was in
[2:39:54] there.
[2:39:56] Yes. Jesus is the ship
[2:40:01] captain. Yes sir. And he want to have
[2:40:04] real
[2:40:05] soldier. He does not employ
[2:40:09] SPC. SPC L they have no job in the
[2:40:14] Lord's
[2:40:18] army. They are just there without
[2:40:22] guns. They only follow laws and
[2:40:25] regulations just to hold you. Is the
[2:40:27] devil doing that work of
[2:40:29] SPC? SPC.
[2:40:34] is all the
[2:40:35] time. Yeah. You see, you
[2:40:39] see that's the work of the
[2:40:42] devil. Amen. But God test
[2:40:46] his throughout
[2:40:49] training. Yes sir. Recently I was
[2:40:53] watching a
[2:40:55] clip of air force people who train to
[2:40:59] become uh uh uh elite soldiers.
[2:41:09] Amen. The training they go
[2:41:12] through and there's a man who came with
[2:41:15] he really had
[2:41:16] a
[2:41:19] physique. So he said I want to challenge
[2:41:22] you people. Yeah. Let me also let me
[2:41:25] show you what I have. We body
[2:41:28] builders. We body builders. Yeah. we can
[2:41:32] uh we we can we can overtake
[2:41:37] soldiers. So they were they were the
[2:41:40] other one versus this
[2:41:42] one they told him the man really
[2:41:50] had praise be to
[2:41:53] God. There are some clips which are
[2:41:56] which are real. It's like a drama but
[2:41:58] they are real.
[2:42:01] That's why I saw somebody went and this
[2:42:04] guy came and slapped this guy his wife.
[2:42:07] So when the guy
[2:42:10] [Applause]
[2:42:13] [Music]
[2:42:17] was the
[2:42:19] husband said the husband could not
[2:42:21] revenge the husband the wife you know
[2:42:24] what you also that's how Jesus
[2:42:28] is Jesus is a
[2:42:31] giant when the devil turn like
[2:42:38] So this guy went for that. It was just a
[2:42:42] simple simple
[2:42:43] what? He never managed
[2:42:46] it. If the world
[2:42:48] government recruit the best of the
[2:42:52] best, what make you think that any
[2:42:56] government is going to recruit anyhow?
[2:43:01] Every time they just pull it to come to
[2:43:05] church. You only appear on
[2:43:09] parties,
[2:43:10] weddings,
[2:43:13] anniversaries, Christmas and Easter.
[2:43:22] Christmas. Praise be to God.
[2:43:27] God is looking for best of the
[2:43:29] best and is he making the best of the
[2:43:32] best out of
[2:43:36] them. He is the one who does that not
[2:43:39] any man. Every time you come, maybe it's
[2:43:44] service by the time you go back you made
[2:43:47] like 20
[2:43:51] push-ups. You come back, you top on that
[2:43:55] You come back. For those who have ever
[2:43:58] gone for
[2:44:00] tease, you
[2:44:03] realize today when you make like
[2:44:06] 10 make 15. When you made
[2:44:11] 15. When you keep moving, time will
[2:44:15] come. When you try to make this
[2:44:20] so you stop here. Every time you try
[2:44:25] Because by the time you are now flat why
[2:44:30] practice makes
[2:44:34] perfect. Every time you come in the
[2:44:37] service, God is doing
[2:44:39] something. You may not even feel
[2:44:42] it realizing
[2:44:44] it because growth is
[2:44:48] gradual. You will never see that tree
[2:44:51] growing.
[2:44:53] But one thing you are
[2:44:54] sure it is
[2:44:57] growing. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. And this
[2:45:00] is the bride
[2:45:02] tree is also
[2:45:04] growing. But the problem we have many
[2:45:07] times what is that we
[2:45:12] move is
[2:45:15] gradual. Eat the word. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:45:19] Just pray. Eat the word.
[2:45:22] Pray fast. Seek God. Listen to the
[2:45:26] message. Seek wisdom. Encourage
[2:45:30] yourself. Before you realize one day
[2:45:34] you'll be in your city, you will be
[2:45:37] praying. And before you realize you are
[2:45:40] in tong, before you realize, you are in
[2:45:44] prophet. Hallelujah.
[2:45:46] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. Because something
[2:45:50] has been happening in your life.
[2:45:54] Amen.
[2:45:56] [Music]
[2:45:57] Jesus is living in our
[2:45:59] soul. He want to do his
[2:46:01] work. That is the resurrection
[2:46:05] power. Power lies in our
[2:46:08] bride. Yes sir. We are the never die. We
[2:46:13] are not going to die. Even when we live.
[2:46:17] Hallelujah. Amen. When a great magnet
[2:46:20] will come.
[2:46:22] This congregate will mean
[2:46:26] nothing. This terror will also be
[2:46:30] surprised. How was this if escaped from
[2:46:35] us? Praise be to
[2:46:38] God. I know one time there's somebody
[2:46:40] who made a very he made a a
[2:46:44] statement which looked funny.
[2:46:49] He said that there are people who
[2:46:51] lie until even the devil of liar until
[2:46:55] even the lying spirit get
[2:47:01] surprised. We cannot reach that
[2:47:07] level. What am I trying to say? That God
[2:47:11] can do
[2:47:13] something until even the nature is
[2:47:15] surprised.
[2:47:18] Hallelujah. Yes
[2:47:20] sir. When Jesus resurrected,
[2:47:23] they were locked in the room, brother.
[2:47:26] Yes. They unlocked themselves in the
[2:47:29] room. Jesus appeared in their
[2:47:32] room. I believe the wall the wall got
[2:47:37] surprised. Even the door
[2:47:41] got passed.
[2:47:45] Praise be to God. That reception of
[2:47:49] God they go through
[2:47:52] fire until the world are
[2:47:55] surprised. How did she manage that
[2:47:59] situation? It is not you managing
[2:48:02] s is the grace of God. Why? Because
[2:48:06] Jesus is living in the th of
[2:48:10] my doing his word.
[2:48:13] just following the
[2:48:15] direction. Blessed be the name of the
[2:48:18] Lord. That's why Jesus rose from the
[2:48:21] dead. The resto.
[2:48:32] Amen. Praise be to
[2:48:39] God. We have a better hope.
[2:48:43] after this Bible, after this
[2:48:46] body. For the Bible says, "What eyes
[2:48:49] have not seen?"
[2:48:52] Brother, what have you
[2:48:57] seen? I know some of us we have seen a
[2:49:02] lot and even you have seen a
[2:49:06] lot good and
[2:49:08] bad and the baddest
[2:49:13] or
[2:49:15] worse. But the Bible say what eyes have
[2:49:20] lost. Look at the technology we have
[2:49:23] today where the science is with rockets
[2:49:28] with AI
[2:49:30] technology with robots mening
[2:49:37] robots. Robots serving in
[2:49:40] gardens, in
[2:49:42] [Music]
[2:49:43] wars until you
[2:49:46] wonder what technology has
[2:49:49] gone. But the Bible says what eyes have
[2:49:53] not
[2:49:54] seen. There is something which that eyes
[2:49:57] have
[2:49:58] not is what your ears have not seen.
[2:50:02] That is what God is
[2:50:04] preparing. Hallelujah.
[2:50:08] Glory be to God. That is what God is
[2:50:11] preparing for
[2:50:13] us. Let me give you an
[2:50:16] example. The prophet tells us Jesus said
[2:50:20] in my father in my father's place are
[2:50:22] many
[2:50:24] mansions. If if it was not so, I would
[2:50:27] have not told you so. I'm going to the
[2:50:30] father. I'm going to pay a place where I
[2:50:33] am. You also come and be with me.
[2:50:38] Amen. They said, "Amen." Can you say
[2:50:40] amen?
[2:50:43] Amen.
[2:50:45] And he left it
[2:50:48] there. Praise be to
[2:50:50] God. And when it was there for
[2:50:53] ages and for
[2:50:56] years, hallelujah. Amen. Here comes
[2:51:00] Malachi 4.
[2:51:03] behind Elijah the
[2:51:05] prophet. You know that scripture before
[2:51:08] the coming of the great and the
[2:51:12] dreadful of the Lord. And Revelation
[2:51:17] 10:7 and the taste of the voice of the
[2:51:21] seven shall
[2:51:24] begin the minister of
[2:51:26] God as he had declared
[2:51:29] some. Here comes the prophet.
[2:51:33] and say there you cannot say that in my
[2:51:36] father's house are many
[2:51:40] mansion manion in the
[2:51:45] house manion in the
[2:51:50] house then he gave an
[2:51:54] example with a great
[2:51:58] prein praise be to god but I'm not
[2:52:01] looking for that quote for
[2:52:03] us and the prophet goes ahead and tells
[2:52:07] him those
[2:52:09] mansions they are not physical
[2:52:12] man. No wonder the build of that
[2:52:16] city is
[2:52:18] God. God has not built with
[2:52:21] motor. Man build with
[2:52:25] motor. Yes sir. Here comes the
[2:52:29] prophet the son of the
[2:52:31] angel and he tells us the sm of
[2:52:38] the
[2:52:39] hallelujah but eyes have no
[2:52:45] s and it tells us that when the word is
[2:52:48] preached and someone is
[2:52:51] excited it's because it's
[2:52:54] theophile has come closer to him the You
[2:52:57] feel like you want to
[2:53:00] enter in one of his days. The preacher
[2:53:03] will be preaching here. Maybe pastor
[2:53:06] will be preaching. Oh, brother
[2:53:09] Paul. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:53:13] And you feel something
[2:53:15] unusual. You feel different
[2:53:18] anointing.
[2:53:20] Hallelujah. And all of a sudden,
[2:53:22] brother, you shall hear the
[2:53:25] call. He has
[2:53:27] come. Blessed be the name
[2:53:30] of
[2:53:32] amen. What eyes have not
[2:53:37] seen? These are the bodies that go
[2:53:40] through
[2:53:44] walls. You want to visit a sister in
[2:53:47] Toronto just
[2:53:49] within a space of thoughts.
[2:53:53] You're in Toronto. Say God bless you,
[2:53:55] brother.
[2:53:58] The prophet
[2:53:59] says when we are almost going.
[2:54:01] Hallelujah.
[2:54:03] Amen. Rapture is nearing. Amen. Amen.
[2:54:10] That is where we shall be the the
[2:54:12] righteous people. Amen.
[2:54:15] Amen. You will see
[2:54:18] John. John tell me how did things go? He
[2:54:23] will
[2:54:24] say that
[2:54:27] man even his leg was turned
[2:54:32] around and we just
[2:54:34] spoke and the leg came straight. I know
[2:54:38] the master of the
[2:54:40] sea of the rain. I know the master of
[2:54:44] the
[2:54:45] nature. God
[2:54:47] speaks. Nature
[2:54:49] obeys. Hallelujah. Amen. One time you
[2:54:52] had a jack
[2:54:54] fruit and that one could not bear
[2:55:01] fruit, year after
[2:55:04] year. But we prayed for the
[2:55:08] tree. We never cut it like it is say
[2:55:11] that if not bear you cut in a throat in
[2:55:13] the
[2:55:17] fire. Jack fruit had to bear
[2:55:20] fruit. The next season fruits were
[2:55:25] there. Who did that? The master of the
[2:55:31] nature. God does not contradict with
[2:55:34] nature. That's why even then your
[2:55:37] salvation is
[2:55:40] gradual. Yes, you are growing into the
[2:55:44] stretcher of the
[2:55:46] perfect. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen.
[2:55:53] Jesus is alive.
[2:55:56] Tell your neighbor, Jesus is
[2:55:58] [Music]
[2:55:59] dead. Hallelujah.
[2:56:02] He is alive.
[2:56:05] Is raining
[2:56:06] here. Every demon demon at this
[2:56:10] time is under your
[2:56:13] feet. Squeeze the
[2:56:16] neck. And the devil knows when I start
[2:56:19] hammering I hammer
[2:56:23] him. Praise be to
[2:56:25] God. You will now find a green fly where
[2:56:28] delegates are
[2:56:32] [Music]
[2:56:34] eating. There is that fly. It has a bad
[2:56:38] name. That green one which that green
[2:56:42] fly. The devil is a green fire.
[2:56:47] in your mess. Don't allow him to come
[2:56:49] with
[2:56:52] you. But sometime you find the believer
[2:56:54] is
[2:56:55] eating, chasing the
[2:57:01] flag. I already gave you the example if
[2:57:04] I not give it to you.
[2:57:07] Jesus gave us
[2:57:09] authority and his
[2:57:12] resurrection was a
[2:57:14] proof that our guy is now
[2:57:19] binding.
[2:57:21] Amen. Praise be to
[2:57:25] God. You need to be
[2:57:29] free. Walk like a free man.
[2:57:35] Every time you walk, you will never find
[2:57:37] me walking
[2:57:39] like no. Walk like a soldier because I'm
[2:57:43] a soldier. A soldier of the
[2:57:46] cross. Jesus sets me free. He gave my
[2:57:50] liberty. My freedom. The devil has no
[2:57:54] right. Stumble with my freedom. I am
[2:57:57] free
[2:57:59] man. Yes sir.
[2:58:03] One day I was preaching
[2:58:06] somewhere on the
[2:58:08] roadside and a certain guy came
[2:58:11] threatening because I told the
[2:58:13] police when I engage another gear I said
[2:58:18] even the government of Uganda cannot
[2:58:21] arrest me at this
[2:58:26] moment. Yes. There's whether you under
[2:58:31] anointing they have to wait for
[2:58:33] you. Let me tell
[2:58:35] you never dare to touch exop pipe when
[2:58:38] the motorbike is
[2:58:42] running. Even when they have just
[2:58:46] stopped will burn
[2:58:51] you. Praise be to God. No one can dare
[2:58:55] touch the
[2:58:57] exop. Amen. Amen. The minister is
[2:59:01] preaching. The anointing is
[2:59:04] boiling and then your car you come
[2:59:06] shouting shouting abusing and
[2:59:10] abusing. When I fall, when I I felt it
[2:59:12] was summer, it was too
[2:59:14] much. I made a prayer and say, "Oh God
[2:59:19] of
[2:59:20] heaven, have merc upon this guy's
[2:59:23] family. Do not put this upon
[2:59:26] them. I also pray for them. Forgive
[2:59:30] them." When I was still in the middle of
[2:59:33] prayer, I felt some cold thing touching
[2:59:35] my
[2:59:36] hand. That same guy was
[2:59:39] convicted. and bought a bott of
[2:59:42] water. He was he was saying like Simon
[2:59:44] the
[2:59:46] sorcerer. When he saw Peter preaching,
[2:59:50] the Holy Ghost falling anointing upon
[2:59:53] people, he was a sorcerer, he came and
[2:59:56] he also pretended to be
[2:59:58] saved. Ah, no. When he saw Philip in
[3:00:02] Samaria, Philip was my fellow
[3:00:05] deacon. Praise be to God. And I thank
[3:00:08] God that um yeah I'm not very far from
[3:00:12] Philip. He was a preacher
[3:00:15] that so when Philip
[3:00:17] preached and people were
[3:00:19] unan signs and wonders
[3:00:22] performed this man used to to life with
[3:00:26] with
[3:00:27] witchcraft. He came and
[3:00:30] repented and then he got
[3:00:32] saved but he did not he never departed
[3:00:35] or deviated from his what?
[3:00:39] I said you
[3:00:42] know you
[3:00:44] follow you must have something
[3:00:47] just back up even computers have back
[3:00:53] up. So he resolved this witchcraft in
[3:00:56] his
[3:00:57] back. When Philip
[3:00:59] preached they had to call she
[3:01:03] apostle the one Jesus gave the king.
[3:01:06] who got the
[3:01:08] revelation. He came and performed
[3:01:11] more and then this man came. Oh my
[3:01:15] brother Peter, God bless you. I'm
[3:01:19] also the same when we used
[3:01:25] to
[3:01:27] go. I'm now set free.
[3:01:31] Are you sure brother? Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:01:34] Then maybe Peter
[3:01:36] say was jumping. Glory to God. Glory to
[3:01:39] God. Hallelujah. Yes. Yes. I believe I
[3:01:42] receive glory. Hallelujah. I feel it.
[3:01:55] I think there they had already dealt
[3:01:56] with an
[3:01:58] Safia. That's right.
[3:02:01] Peter had tested that spirit
[3:02:06] before. Sister
[3:02:08] Safia maybe she came around 11
[3:02:10] there. You know when sisters delays they
[3:02:13] come around 11.
[3:02:16] 11
[3:02:19] there find out with the baby at the back
[3:02:22] in the
[3:02:24] back and sometime they also know that
[3:02:26] they
[3:02:27] late see her
[3:02:31] where he's facing this side let me go
[3:02:35] the other side I pass behind the flowers
[3:02:38] I come as if I was dropping
[3:02:45] So sister
[3:02:46] came remember they had sold a
[3:02:50] plot. Yeah. Cash was
[3:02:52] there. She had bought uh new
[3:02:56] shoes maybe and a nice
[3:03:00] bag. She had worked on herself.
[3:03:05] I know when she said everybody has to
[3:03:07] know
[3:03:08] that because if you look at the spirit
[3:03:10] they
[3:03:11] had it was not a good
[3:03:15] spirit. So maybe she bought tinkling
[3:03:20] shoes and that day brother had sat
[3:03:31] in she's spiritual even because by the
[3:03:35] way sometime when money
[3:03:37] comes become more spiritual.
[3:03:42] Yes Lord
[3:03:44] Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[3:03:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:03:55] God bless you,
[3:03:57] saints. I have a special
[3:04:01] song. There is a
[3:04:03] roof up above
[3:04:05] us. Have a good
[3:04:07] place. You stay.
[3:04:14] Can you remind me that
[3:04:16] song? Remind me that song. My
[3:04:22] brother
[3:04:27] and fridge was
[3:04:30] packed. That woman was prepared
[3:04:35] earlier. I need to ask our sister,
[3:04:42] you used to come
[3:04:45] early. Those days I used to come early.
[3:04:48] I could
[3:04:49] pray. But now I'm just thanking
[3:04:52] God, sister, why have you come
[3:04:55] late? You know what? You know, as you
[3:04:58] people say, we are selling our
[3:05:01] properties. We share it equally.
[3:05:06] So we have the reason why I have come
[3:05:09] late money was too
[3:05:12] much. We counted money after 4
[3:05:16] hours. So I just play for 2
[3:05:19] hours. I have to pray for my
[3:05:22] husband and
[3:05:24] brother was a very nice
[3:05:28] suit like this one of
[3:05:31] mine. Isn't it a nice
[3:05:33] suit? Praise be to God.
[3:05:38] Now she did not
[3:05:41] know. She thought the brother had gone
[3:05:44] for a short
[3:05:47] call. It was they had even they were
[3:05:49] even done
[3:05:51] with
[3:05:54] no
[3:05:57] the
[3:05:59] body. Ah, there's no wasting that money.
[3:06:02] We want money for the ministry.
[3:06:13] Sister, is this the only thing
[3:06:17] you
[3:06:19] [Music]
[3:06:20] pastor? You know, God does God always
[3:06:23] give you two to three some good number
[3:06:25] of
[3:06:27] chances. My sister.
[3:06:34] Yes,
[3:06:35] [Music]
[3:06:38] brother.
[3:06:46] Brotherh. She didn't know that was her
[3:06:51] death. She died at the pulpit.
[3:06:54] Hallelujah. Amen. So the man was
[3:06:56] standointed and he told him,
[3:06:59] "Suffer, you have not lied to me. You
[3:07:02] have lied the Holy Ghost. The bare feet
[3:07:05] which has taken your
[3:07:11] husband where the strong young
[3:07:14] men's the brother, the
[3:07:19] brother, where is my brother? My brother
[3:07:21] counled there and
[3:07:26] You will never read
[3:07:27] anywhere that they went to
[3:07:31] CPS and shifters of military
[3:07:33] intelligence came for
[3:07:36] investigation. Even the government
[3:07:40] feared. Remember the story of
[3:07:43] Elijah. Amen. I sent him 50.
[3:07:50] He told them, "If I'm a man of God, let
[3:07:52] fire come and consume
[3:07:56] you." And they were
[3:07:58] consumed. And then the last one cried
[3:08:01] for his
[3:08:04] life. Praise be to God. Peter had dealt
[3:08:08] with this spirit
[3:08:11] before. So when he saw the same in
[3:08:14] Simeon, he was not
[3:08:16] moved after jumping.
[3:08:19] Hallelujah. And everything like
[3:08:21] that. Praise be to God. So this man told
[3:08:25] him, so after he started praying for
[3:08:27] them and receiving the Holy Ghost, they
[3:08:30] received the Holy Ghost. So he came with
[3:08:32] the money, he said, my
[3:08:35] brother, you also give me this
[3:08:39] power that when I I will be able to
[3:08:42] impart anointing upon
[3:08:44] you. Oh, he pressed the wrong button.
[3:08:48] Peter told
[3:08:50] him, "You have no
[3:08:52] part things of
[3:08:56] God. You are
[3:09:02] very perish with your
[3:09:08] money. Please let those things have not
[3:09:13] fall." Praise be to God.
[3:09:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus
[3:09:19] gave us what no one else will ever give.
[3:09:26] He has blessed us so
[3:09:29] high in heavenly
[3:09:32] places. That's where men fed with
[3:09:38] angels. Heavenly places in
[3:09:41] Christ. We are in Christ Jesus.
[3:09:46] That is where you are
[3:09:48] seated. No matter what you are going
[3:09:51] through, you in Christ Jesus. You are in
[3:09:54] his palms. He cannot lose you. It is
[3:09:58] just for a
[3:10:00] season. But your time is coming, read
[3:10:03] your Bible, see men of old, prophets of
[3:10:07] old, men of God, what they went
[3:10:12] through, but in the right time.
[3:10:15] One day
[3:10:18] Goliath roared in the wrong
[3:10:23] season revival had taken place in the
[3:10:26] camp
[3:10:30] of Amen. Something had
[3:10:36] happened. So he thought as
[3:10:39] usual that is how the devil operates.
[3:10:43] Don't become the devil's usual
[3:10:48] business. Mind you, the devil is weak
[3:10:50] when it's not in the
[3:10:54] body. You'll never be there. Then you
[3:10:57] hear a voice from the air
[3:11:01] saying do
[3:11:03] this. No, you first give him room in
[3:11:06] your
[3:11:08] heart. And the devil is very good in
[3:11:11] playing with your
[3:11:14] feelings. In the message
[3:11:17] demonology, the prophet say that when
[3:11:19] you prayed
[3:11:22] for for the first is it 48
[3:11:27] hours that situation will be multiplied.
[3:11:30] I don't know how many
[3:11:34] times if you had just a minor
[3:11:39] headache, it will become terrible
[3:11:42] headache. If the eyes want to come
[3:11:45] out, the teeth are paining. If you ever
[3:11:49] had a tooth
[3:11:50] ache, there's when when you when a teeth
[3:11:53] will pain and will go
[3:11:56] crazy. One man told that he went to the
[3:11:58] dentist
[3:12:00] remove a tooth. And when they ask him
[3:12:04] because every every teeth they
[3:12:06] hit, he said, "Remove that one. Remove
[3:12:09] that one. Remove that one." And then the
[3:12:13] doctor said, "Now," he said, "Now remove
[3:12:18] everything." He felt all the teeth were
[3:12:23] paining. I've ever had that
[3:12:26] pain. I thought I was running mad.
[3:12:29] Blessed be the name of
[3:12:31] God. But the prophet
[3:12:33] says after 40 48
[3:12:37] hours when you keep
[3:12:40] believing keep
[3:12:42] confessing I am healed. I am healed. I
[3:12:46] am fine. Hallelujah. I'm
[3:12:50] okay. Praise be to
[3:12:53] God. Finally the devil will go.
[3:12:57] The devil will go.
[3:13:03] Not until you denounce the devil,
[3:13:07] I will never be a breeding ground for
[3:13:09] the devil.
[3:13:13] Amen.
[3:13:15] If I was to be the devil's
[3:13:21] spice,
[3:13:23] spices in the devil's food.
[3:13:31] I would be sulfuric
[3:13:37] acid. Praise be to God. Don't give the
[3:13:40] devil
[3:13:42] ground. Brother, sister, look at Jesus
[3:13:46] carrying the sins of the world on his
[3:13:50] shoulder. He's
[3:13:52] struggling. He's going with a cross.
[3:13:55] woman of sin has come. He's opening. He
[3:13:59] was
[3:14:00] beaten. Hallelujah.
[3:14:03] He was tortured. He was
[3:14:07] mocked. Yet he knew no
[3:14:10] sin. Because he wanted to have
[3:14:13] liberty, to be free, to be
[3:14:21] anything. Nobody could pay our price.
[3:14:25] Sin was so
[3:14:28] cruel. In the message that on Calvary,
[3:14:31] the
[3:14:32] prophec fell, it was like a black
[3:14:36] sheet covering the
[3:14:40] earth and the earth was
[3:14:43] paralyzed. Because of sin, trees
[3:14:47] developed
[3:14:48] thorns because of sin.
[3:14:52] B started eating each other because of
[3:14:56] sin. Animal became prayerful to one
[3:14:59] another. We also became a
[3:15:02] prey because of
[3:15:05] sin. That is the cruality of sin.
[3:15:10] Oh, in the message of
[3:15:13] sin and what it take to ride sin out of
[3:15:17] our
[3:15:19] life. He said our sin was so
[3:15:23] cruel. It had to take God
[3:15:26] himself to come and carry our
[3:15:30] sin. And here he
[3:15:32] comes paid for everything. I just tell
[3:15:36] you to
[3:15:37] believe and say it is
[3:15:40] impossible. God will never come to our
[3:15:47] understanding. We have to understand
[3:15:52] God. Praise be to
[3:15:54] God. God has a
[3:15:57] standard. He has a principle which every
[3:16:01] Christian must follow.
[3:16:05] Your mother will never give you that.
[3:16:08] Your father will never give you that.
[3:16:10] Your grandpappa will know. It's only
[3:16:15] God. And where is the principle?
[3:16:19] Whosoever comes to God must
[3:16:21] believe. Brother, you must believe.
[3:16:24] Sister, you must believe. But
[3:16:28] frustration is not greater than our God.
[3:16:32] our faith. Amen.
[3:16:37] The moment you limit
[3:16:40] God to your problem, you limit
[3:16:47] him, he will get angry with
[3:16:52] you. Praise be to
[3:16:57] God. He takes the glory alone.
[3:17:01] He does not share with you anything.
[3:17:04] Not even your husband, not even your
[3:17:07] wife, not even your children, not even
[3:17:09] your bishop, not even not even soal
[3:17:15] overseers. God takes the glory
[3:17:19] alone. One day there is a man who spoke
[3:17:22] in the Bible and people shouted and
[3:17:25] said, "He has spoken like God.
[3:17:30] Before he finished the
[3:17:32] statement, the angel of the Lord strike
[3:17:35] him and he wrote, he started rotting
[3:17:38] from
[3:17:39] there. He was a
[3:17:43] king. Another
[3:17:45] time the king went to the
[3:17:48] altar to burn the
[3:17:50] incense and the prophet warned him and
[3:17:54] when he wanted to slap the
[3:17:57] prophet the hand got
[3:18:00] stuck. That is the God we talking
[3:18:03] about. One day the ark of the
[3:18:07] covenant was taken out from Israel. The
[3:18:10] priest and took it and they brought
[3:18:13] their soal get
[3:18:16] dagen. They placed it before the ar of
[3:18:18] the
[3:18:19] covenant. In the morning the guy was
[3:18:22] bowing
[3:18:26] down his stubborn stubborn
[3:18:30] servants. They brought him
[3:18:33] back. The following day the head was
[3:18:36] chopped off.
[3:18:39] Amen. Thanks be to
[3:18:42] God. But I have a God who will show
[3:18:46] off the head of every demon in your
[3:18:51] life. The head is when the head is not
[3:18:56] there. The body cannot work. When God
[3:19:00] show the head of
[3:19:02] Dagon, they gain some
[3:19:05] senses. Let us take this God back.
[3:19:10] Praise be to God.
[3:19:13] Are you stressed this morning?
[3:19:16] Are you troubled this
[3:19:18] morning? Your problem this morning? Let
[3:19:21] the ark of the covenant enter
[3:19:24] there. Is going to take
[3:19:28] away every situation is powing now.
[3:19:36] He has exalted his word above his
[3:19:39] name. There is nothing that can
[3:19:41] challenge the word of
[3:19:43] God. When I was young, I used to have a
[3:19:47] stomach
[3:19:48] trouble. It troubled me a lot. I went
[3:19:53] to
[3:19:54] everywhere and the problem was not
[3:19:57] there. But the the the pain was too was
[3:20:02] tense.
[3:20:05] Praise be to God.
[3:20:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:20:10] But when Jesus found me,
[3:20:13] when I saw the light,
[3:20:16] Amen. that thing was still
[3:20:19] there. But as I was moving on, reading
[3:20:22] the Bible, I started exercising my
[3:20:27] faith. I forget my first Bible which I
[3:20:30] lost.
[3:20:35] I had read almost
[3:20:39] everything. Brethren, I just remembered
[3:20:42] maybe like I just remember like 10 years
[3:20:47] later that I used to have a very
[3:20:49] terrible
[3:20:54] traumatic I had a pimple. I don't know
[3:20:58] how they call it but that's thing. Do we
[3:21:02] have medical somebody? Brother Ivan.
[3:21:07] What? I had a what? Had a what?
[3:21:12] That's those are not the doctors.
[3:21:15] There were two here.
[3:21:18] That thing stay there for long. And I'm
[3:21:20] one person I hate seeing something on my
[3:21:23] body.
[3:21:25] I will battle with
[3:21:27] it. I could pierce it, pull it and the
[3:21:32] thing would come back. I bleed endure
[3:21:35] the
[3:21:37] pain. But when Jesus
[3:21:40] came, not even a
[3:21:45] trace. But brother Martin, that is
[3:21:47] something
[3:21:48] small. Our God does not use a fist to
[3:21:52] cast the devil.
[3:21:58] If he just does
[3:22:00] that, the devil can fall
[3:22:05] in.
[3:22:09] Hallelujah. God has no energy to waste
[3:22:12] to the devil.
[3:22:16] But
[3:22:18] believers if they allow to accommodate
[3:22:21] him Jesus leaves you until you get
[3:22:27] tired. You know the guy of
[3:22:29] Gada. That was his
[3:22:32] day. Praise be to God. I'm finishing
[3:22:36] brethren. That was his day. They saw
[3:22:39] Jesus from very
[3:22:41] fast. What have you come to do with us?
[3:22:45] Before our time, Jesus told the devil to
[3:22:49] keep his
[3:22:51] peace because they know that they are
[3:22:53] weak. They asked Jesus, "Have mercy on
[3:22:57] us. Let us go and occupy the
[3:23:01] [Music]
[3:23:02] pace." Those
[3:23:05] were those pigs. They had some common
[3:23:09] sense. They said to to hell with the
[3:23:12] devil.
[3:23:15] We rather go
[3:23:20] choke. If it
[3:23:25] means just imagine those businessmen the
[3:23:28] losses they
[3:23:32] made. But to God it was again because
[3:23:35] her soul was saved.
[3:23:39] If you save your
[3:23:40] soul will cause God to destroy all your
[3:23:43] enemies, he will do
[3:23:46] it. Our prophet tells us that soul is
[3:23:49] worth a thousand
[3:23:52] words. Just
[3:23:56] imagine that's why say no performed
[3:23:58] against each
[3:24:02] other. Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:24:09] I'm finishing with this quote in the
[3:24:11] message
[3:24:12] uh it's the rising of the
[3:24:16] sun
[3:24:20] 650418
[3:24:24] 65 in him we became part of
[3:24:28] him the
[3:24:32] Easter reveal they reveal sacred
[3:24:37] of God like it was
[3:24:41] then.
[3:24:44] Amen. Of life after
[3:24:48] death. That's when this secret was
[3:24:53] revealed. We are now
[3:24:56] alive. We were once dead in sins and
[3:24:59] trespasses.
[3:25:01] The true Easter Seal has
[3:25:04] broke from around
[3:25:08] me. True Easter Seal has broke
[3:25:13] death from
[3:25:17] around Hallelujah.
[3:25:22] That's
[3:25:24] why you find believer walking at night.
[3:25:31] Maybe the night dancer is following
[3:25:35] [Music]
[3:25:36] me. You feel some moving you
[3:25:41] run. Jesus takes away that
[3:25:46] fear. Fear creates what's not there.
[3:25:52] One minister one day was
[3:25:55] preaching and and he told us of a
[3:25:57] brother who feared electricity so
[3:26:04] much he
[3:26:06] knew
[3:26:13] electricity one day
[3:26:16] I'm not remembering it very well but
[3:26:18] it's like either the power was awful for
[3:26:21] some several
[3:26:23] days. So the brother came and grabbed
[3:26:25] that
[3:26:30] accidentally. I don't remember whether
[3:26:32] he even
[3:26:34] fainted but the power was not
[3:26:39] there but
[3:26:41] fear shocked the brother to death.
[3:26:48] Almost the heart was getting out. Don't
[3:26:50] fear.
[3:26:51] [Music]
[3:26:54] Don't fear.
[3:26:59] You see this witch, this uh witch
[3:27:03] doctors or sorcerers who come and preach
[3:27:07] you with a with a chicken
[3:27:12] head. They sprinkle some blood
[3:27:15] there with maybe some feathers of
[3:27:19] what? I always say, I wish they could
[3:27:22] leave their whole
[3:27:26] coke and you make a nice meal.
[3:27:34] rather than you've slaughtered a sheep.
[3:27:36] You have wasted it and you've come to
[3:27:39] waste
[3:27:43] also. Brother God, we don't we don't
[3:27:46] expect sister to call
[3:27:48] us. God bless you brother. Today in the
[3:27:52] morning I found the heart of a
[3:27:54] snake and a tail of
[3:27:57] lizard. They had mixed it in
[3:28:01] Vaseline. I even fear to open my
[3:28:04] shop. Sister, let me give you a
[3:28:09] prescription. Get a
[3:28:11] cane, a good one. Don't even waste your
[3:28:16] paraffin. Just give
[3:28:18] it in the name of Jesus. Kick it away.
[3:28:22] Open your
[3:28:25] business. And a few days down the road,
[3:28:27] someone will
[3:28:29] come and they come. Where do you walk
[3:28:37] now? For me, every Wednesday I go to
[3:28:40] church. That's not what I'm talking
[3:28:42] about. The
[3:28:43] other time I saw you kicking something
[3:28:45] here and there people said they were
[3:28:48] waiting for
[3:28:49] something whom I just know is the very
[3:28:53] person. That is the God we serve. The
[3:28:56] champion of the
[3:28:59] champion, the great
[3:29:01] warrior. Amen. He has fought our
[3:29:06] battles. We are walking above
[3:29:10] demon. Yes sir.
[3:29:13] We fear no evil. Shall we rise on our
[3:29:16] feet? We fear no
[3:29:18] evil. Jesus is risen from the
[3:29:21] dead. Praise be to God. I told you when
[3:29:25] the devil is to overcome
[3:29:27] you. He has to come. He has to come to
[3:29:31] church. Sit here. Hear the word. Ask the
[3:29:35] preacher. What shall we do?
[3:29:39] the preacher to command him. The devil
[3:29:42] repent beaptized in the name of Jesus
[3:29:45] Christ. But will the devil even
[3:29:47] believe to begin with the seed is not
[3:29:49] even
[3:29:50] there? That is too hard. How can I drop
[3:29:54] my tinkling
[3:29:55] [Music]
[3:29:57] shoes 21st
[3:30:06] century? Janet is not your role
[3:30:09] model. No sir is the fountain of
[3:30:15] honor. Janet is the fountain of honor's
[3:30:18] wife. Mr. He is the president.
[3:30:22] [Music]
[3:30:24] This is true.
[3:30:26] Sweetheart, Jesus is our role model.
[3:30:35] Yes, right now the tomb is
[3:30:39] empty. He never said us to vis.
[3:30:53] [Music]
[3:30:55] Catholics are keeping them because they
[3:30:58] are used every Sunday. I don't know what
[3:31:01] who has bewitched
[3:31:05] them. How come the nails are
[3:31:08] [Music]
[3:31:13] 13? When Jesus was going to
[3:31:15] heaven, he never told them to keep the
[3:31:18] nail.
[3:31:20] He never told brother
[3:31:22] Peter, "Therefore go into the
[3:31:26] well, photocopy the
[3:31:29] mail and give them the rosaries.
[3:31:35] [Music]
[3:31:39] He also
[3:31:41] believe and
[3:31:44] baptized shall be saved and
[3:31:48] this shall follow them that believe in
[3:31:52] my
[3:31:53] name. You shall cast out
[3:31:58] demon not in Mary's name. Mary never
[3:32:02] told them to cast demon in his name.
[3:32:06] She's our
[3:32:08] sister. For them, they are
[3:32:12] mother. Mary knows her
[3:32:15] children. James and
[3:32:18] others. Those are Mary's
[3:32:20] children and Joseph is their
[3:32:23] father. But we are the sons of
[3:32:27] God. Amen. Amen. We are the children of
[3:32:31] God and Mary is our sister because she's
[3:32:34] a daughter of
[3:32:37] God. She believed the word and the word
[3:32:42] became a womb in
[3:32:45] her and that word was
[3:32:49] Jesus. Praise be to God.
[3:32:52] I just
[3:32:54] wonder what do Catholics think when Mary
[3:32:57] was struggling on the day
[3:33:00] of she was filled with the Holy
[3:33:04] [Music]
[3:33:05] Ghost. May God have
[3:33:10] mercy. We praise the Lord. We thank God
[3:33:14] for the light he has
[3:33:16] given and we are glad to know that he is
[3:33:20] living. We walk with him every day. He's
[3:33:24] the one leading our
[3:33:25] path, guiding us every single
[3:33:28] day. And as long as the word is guiding
[3:33:31] us, we shall not
[3:33:34] stumble. We shall not
[3:33:36] fail. That is the true
[3:33:40] resurrection. Blessed be the name of the
[3:33:43] Lord. The Easter Seal at the beginning
[3:33:45] broke the seal of Roman seals. the
[3:33:47] Easter seal that was sealed up and men
[3:33:50] when they died was gone. But he broke
[3:33:52] the seal and revealed the secret. And
[3:33:55] now by the Holy
[3:33:58] Ghost has broke the seal from around our
[3:34:01] lives. And Christ is revealed as he
[3:34:04] lives in me. For now we are quickened
[3:34:08] with him. Hallelujah. Christ is now
[3:34:11] living.
[3:34:14] And if it's not there
[3:34:15] yet, this is your time. God bless
[3:34:22] [Applause]
[3:34:24] [Music]
[3:34:25] you. Oh, I will serve
[3:34:29] him because I love
[3:34:34] him. He has
[3:34:36] given
[3:34:38] life to me.
[3:34:42] Oh, I was
[3:34:45] nothing until he found
[3:34:49] me. He has
[3:34:52] given
[3:34:54] life to you. Join me and sing together.
[3:34:58] I
[3:34:59] will. You deserve it this
[3:35:02] morning this afternoon. brother.

[3:35:31] Hallelujah.
[3:35:33] [Music]
[3:35:35] Oh yes, he has
[3:35:38] gi
[3:35:39] life to
[3:35:42] me. Oh, I was nothing. We were nothing.

[3:35:51] Oh,
[3:35:55] even Oh, I will trust him. I will trust
[3:35:59] him because he loves me.

[3:36:12] I want you we were nothing.
[3:36:18] Oh yes.
[3:36:20] [Music]
[3:36:24] Oh, I will follow him.
[3:36:29] Why? Because I love He loves me.
[3:36:39] [Music]
[3:36:40] And I was I was nothing.
[3:36:46] Hallelujah.
[3:36:52] Oh, I will
[3:36:56] believe
[3:36:59] because that God
[3:37:05] to
[3:37:07] me. I was I was
[3:37:11] [Music]
[3:37:12] nothing.
[3:37:14] [Music]
[3:37:19] Hallelujah. Just go before the Lord and
[3:37:21] speak to him. I want to tell that Jesus
[3:37:24] paid it
[3:37:25] all. He rose from the dead for
[3:37:29] yourself. You are the perfect will of
[3:37:31] God.
[3:37:32] That is the purpose why Jesus came. He
[3:37:36] came to set the captive free. He came to
[3:37:39] heal the
[3:37:40] brokenhearted. He came to give sight to
[3:37:42] the blind. With his twice we are
[3:37:46] healed. Precious father in the name of
[3:37:48] Jesus. Father we thank you for this
[3:37:51] moment. Oh God we are here before thy
[3:37:54] throne of grace. We thank you for what
[3:37:57] you did at Calvary. You paid for our
[3:38:00] price. mighty savior. You are glorious
[3:38:03] God and mighty. You are worthy to be
[3:38:06] exalted Jehovah God. We just love you
[3:38:09] Lord Jesus Christ when remember what you
[3:38:12] did for us on Calvary. We are grateful
